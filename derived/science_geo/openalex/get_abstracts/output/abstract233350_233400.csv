https://openalex.org/W2068163719,"Under appropriate conditions, superconducting electronic circuits behave quantum mechanically, with properties that can be designed and controlled at will. We have realized an experiment in which a superconducting two-level system, playing the role of an artificial atom, is strongly coupled to a single photon stored in an on-chip cavity. We show that the atom-photon coupling in this circuit can be made strong enough for coherent effects to dominate over dissipation, even in a solid state environment. This new regime of matter light interaction in a circuit can be exploited for quantum information processing and quantum communication. It may also lead to new approaches for single photon generation and detection."

Of the various fuel cell types, solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) combine the benefits of environmentally benign power generation with fuel flexibility. However, the necessity for high operating temperatures (800-1,000 degrees C) has resulted in high costs and materials compatibility challenges. As a consequence, significant effort has been devoted to the development of intermediate-temperature (500-700 degrees C) SOFCs. A key obstacle to reduced-temperature operation of SOFCs is the poor activity of traditional cathode materials for electrochemical reduction of oxygen in this temperature regime. Here we present Ba(0.5)Sr(0.5)Co(0.8)Fe(0.2)O(3-delta)(BSCF) as a new cathode material for reduced-temperature SOFC operation. BSCF, incorporated into a thin-film doped ceria fuel cell, exhibits high power densities (1,010 mW cm(-2) and 402 mW cm(-2) at 600 degrees C and 500 degrees C, respectively) when operated with humidified hydrogen as the fuel and air as the cathode gas. We further demonstrate that BSCF is ideally suited to 'single-chamber' fuel-cell operation, where anode and cathode reactions take place within the same physical chamber. The high power output of BSCF cathodes results from the high rate of oxygen diffusion through the material. By enabling operation at reduced temperatures, BSCF cathodes may result in widespread practical implementation of SOFCs."
https://openalex.org/W1966282214,"Two deep ice cores from central Greenland, drilled in the 1990s, have played a key role in climate reconstructions of the Northern Hemisphere, but the oldest sections of the cores were disturbed in chronology owing to ice folding near the bedrock. Here we present an undisturbed climate record from a North Greenland ice core, which extends back to 123,000 years before the present, within the last interglacial period. The oxygen isotopes in the ice imply that climate was stable during the last interglacial period, with temperatures 5 °C warmer than today. We find unexpectedly large temperature differences between our new record from northern Greenland and the undisturbed sections of the cores from central Greenland, suggesting that the extent of ice in the Northern Hemisphere modulated the latitudinal temperature gradients in Greenland. This record shows a slow decline in temperatures that marked the initiation of the last glacial period. Our record reveals a hitherto unrecognized warm period initiated by an abrupt climate warming about 115,000 years ago, before glacial conditions were fully developed. This event does not appear to have an immediate Antarctic counterpart, suggesting that the climate see-saw between the hemispheres (which dominated the last glacial period) was not operating at this time."

https://openalex.org/W1969587259,"In the emerging field of quantum computation and quantum information, superconducting devices are promising candidates for the implementation of solid-state quantum bits or qubits. Single-qubit operations, direct coupling between two qubits, and the realization of a quantum gate have been reported. However, complex manipulation of entangled states - such as the coupling of a two-level system to a quantum harmonic oscillator, as demonstrated in ion/atom-trap experiments or cavity quantum electrodynamics - has yet to be achieved for superconducting devices. Here we demonstrate entanglement between a superconducting flux qubit (a two-level system) and a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). The latter provides the measurement system for detecting the quantum states; it is also an effective inductance that, in parallel with an external shunt capacitance, acts as a harmonic oscillator. We achieve generation and control of the entangled state by performing microwave spectroscopy and detecting the resultant Rabi oscillations of the coupled system."

We show that the endoplasmic reticulum-localized proNARC-1 to NARC-1 zymogen conversion is Ca2+-independent and that within the zymogen autocatalytic processing site SSVFAQ↓SIP Val at P4 and Pro at P3′ are critical. The S127R and D374Y mutations result in ∼50–60% and ≥98% decrease in zymogen processing, respectively. In contrast, the double [D374Y + N157K], F216L, and R218S natural mutants resulted in normal zymogen processing. The cell surface LDL receptor (LDLR) levels are reduced by 35% in lymphoblasts of S127R patients. The LDLR levels are also reduced in stable HepG2 cells overexpressing NARC-1 or its natural mutant S127R, and this reduction is abrogated in the presence of 5 mm ammonium chloride, suggesting that overexpression of NARC-1 increases the turnover rate of the LDLR. Adenoviral expression of wild type human NARC-1 in mice resulted in a maximal ∼9-fold increase in circulating LDL cholesterol, while in LDLR(–/–) mice a delayed ∼2-fold increase in LDL cholesterol was observed. In conclusion, NARC-1 seems to affect both the level of LDLR and that of circulating apoB-containing lipoproteins in an LDLR-dependent and -independent fashion.

The mammalian proprotein convertases constitute a family of 9 serine proteinases related to bacterial subtilisin.

The cDNA of the enzyme NARC-1 was cloned during pharmaceutical screening of mRNAs up-regulated following induction of neural apoptosis by serum withdrawal, and the encoded protein was called “neural apoptosis regulated convertase 1” (NARC-1) (11Naureckiene S.

Biophys. 2003; 420: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We characterized this enzyme, and we showed that it is highly expressed in liver and small intestine and that specific mutations in the prosegment of NARC-1 completely abrogated its autocatalytic processing (5Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Marcinkiewicz J. Jasmin S.B. Stifani S. Basak A. Prat A. Chretien M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). We further showed that overexpression of NARC-1 enhances neurogenesis of progenitor brain telencephalic cells. The sustained expression of NARC-1 in liver and small intestine and its transient expression in telencephalon, kidney, and cerebellum beg for the identification of its physiological substrates, which are still unknown. Human genetic point mutations resulting in pathology have been reported only for two of the proprotein convertases (PCs), namely PC1 (gene PCSK1) (12Jackson R.S. Creemers J.W. Ohagi S.

Two distinct missense mutations, one on each allele of PCSK1, are responsible for a recessive form of obesity (12Jackson R.S. Creemers J.W. Ohagi S. Raffin-Sanson M.L. Sanders L. Montague C.T.

Autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH) is a risk factor for coronary heart disease, which is characterized by an increase in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels that is associated with mutations in the genes LDLR or APOB (15Rader D.J. Cohen J. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Three single point mutations in PCSK9 causing amino acid changes were reported, each genetically linked to a third form of ADH. The mutations S127R or F216L were detected in different French families (14Abifadel M. Varret M. Rabes J.P. Allard D. Ouguerram K. Devillers M. Cruaud C. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Erlich D. Derre A. Villeger L. Farnier M. Beucler I. Bruckert E. Chambaz J. Chanu B. Lecerf J.M. Luc G. Moulin P. Weissenbach J. Prat A. Krempf M. Junien C. Seidah N.G. Boileau C. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar), the mutant D374Y in a large Utah pedigree (16Timms K.M. Wagner S. Samuels M.E. Forbey K. Goldfine H. Jammulapati S. Skolnick M.H. Hopkins P.N. Hunt S.C. Shattuck D.M. Hum. Genet. 2004; 114: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and in Norwegian subjects (17Leren T.P. Clin. Genet. 2004; 65: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the latter study, one patient exhibited a double mutation D374Y + N157K (17Leren T.P. Clin. Genet. 2004; 65: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), although it is not clear if both mutations are on the same allele. In all cases, the circulating levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were 2–6-fold higher than normal. Whereas mutations in the NARC-1 gene PCSK9 result in a hypercholesterolemic phenotype, nothing is known about the mechanism(s) behind this effect and whether such mutations affect the enzymatic activity of NARC-1 and/or are due to a gain of nonenzymatic function. Recently, the common polymorphic intron 1 (C(–161)T) and exon 9 (I474V) variants in PCSK9 gene (14Abifadel M. Varret M. Rabes J.P. Allard D. Ouguerram K. Devillers M. Cruaud C. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Erlich D. Derre A. Villeger L. Farnier M. Beucler I. Bruckert E. Chambaz J. Chanu B. Lecerf J.M. Luc G. Moulin P. Weissenbach J. Prat A. Krempf M. Junien C. Seidah N.G. Boileau C. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar) were shown to be significantly associated with increased total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels in the general population in Japan (18Shioji K. Mannami T. Kokubo Y. Inamoto N. Takagi S. Goto Y. Nonogi H. Iwai N. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 49: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Independently, two groups used microarray technology to study mRNAs that are regulated by cholesterol or the sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs), and came to the conclusion that NARC-1 is likely to be implicated in sterol/lipid metabolism (19Horton J.D. Shah N.A. Warrington J.A. Anderson N.N. Park S.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12027-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar, 20Maxwell K.N. Soccio R.E. Duncan E.M. Sehayek E. Breslow J.L. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2109-2119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent data from our group demonstrated that NARC-1 mRNA levels are up-regulated in hepatocyte-derived HepG2 cells by the hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors “statins.” This process can be reversed by mevalonate treatment, implicating SREBP-2 in the up-regulation of NARC-1 (21Dubuc G. Chamberland A. Wassef H. Davignon J. Seidah N.G. Bernier L. Prat A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1454-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). In contrast to NARC-1, the mRNA levels of SKI-1 are not sensitive to cholesterol, despite the fact that it is a key protease in the cleavage of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) (22Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5785-5793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 23Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Thus, NARC-1 and SKI-1 participate in the regulated response to intracellular cholesterol levels and LDL metabolism via different mechanisms. The zymogen proNARC-1 is autocatalytically processed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into NARC-1 that is secreted as a complex with its ∼14-kDa prosegment (5Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Marcinkiewicz J. Jasmin S.B. Stifani S. Basak A. Prat A. Chretien M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). The pro-form of NARC-1 (pro-NARC-1) is found predominantly in the ER (5Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Marcinkiewicz J. Jasmin S.B. Stifani S. Basak A. Prat A. Chretien M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). In this report we have focused on the zymogen processing of pro-NARC-1 and the secretion of mature NARC-1. This led us to demonstrate that the human natural mutations S127R and especially D374Y greatly reduce the extent of NARC-1 zymogen processing, whereas the F216L, R218S, N157K alone and the double D374Y + N157K mutations do not seem to significantly affect this process. We also show that although NARC-1 does not contain a P-domain, its C-terminal Cys/His-rich domain is important for efficient zymogen processing. Furthermore, we show that patients with the heterozygote S127R NARC-1 mutation exhibit 35% lower levels of LDLR at the surface of their lymphoblasts, a finding that was reproduced in HepG2 cells overexpressing this mutant, and reversed in the presence of the lysosomotrophic agent NH4Cl (24Bergeron E. Basak A. Decroly E. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Further proof that NARC-1 regulates LDL production comes from the fact that adenoviral expression of human NARC-1 in mice led to a very significant time-dependent increase in circulating LDL cholesterol even in the absence of LDLR. cDNAs and Cells—All NARC-1 and its mutants cDNAs were cloned in pIRES2-EGFP with a C-terminal V5 tag, as described (5Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Marcinkiewicz J. Jasmin S.B. Stifani S. Basak A. Prat A. Chretien M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Antibody to LRP1 (C-terminal Ab377) was a generous gift of J. Herz (University of Texas, Dallas). Stable transfectants of empty bicistronic pIRES2-EGFP vector, V5-tagged wild type NARC-1 and its mutants H226A, S127R, and D374Y were obtained in the human hepatocyte-derived cell line HepG2 following G418 selection and FACS purification of fluorescent cells (25Conesa M. Prat A. Mort J.S. Marvaldi J. Lissitzky J.C. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 703-711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfections and Biosynthetic Analyses—All transfections were done with 3 × 105 HEK293 cells using Effectene (Qiagen) and a total of 1–1.5 μg of cDNAs. Two days post-transfection, the cells were washed and then incubated for various times with either 250 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys or Na2[35SO4] (PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Analytical Sciences) or 400 μCi/ml [3H]Ile (Amersham Biosciences). Pulse-chase experiments with [35S]Met/Cys, in the absence or presence of A23187 (2 μm), brefeldin A (2.5 μg/ml), thapsigargin (300 nm), or nocodazole (66 nm), were carried out as described previously (3Seidah N.G.

The cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), after which the lysates and media were prepared for immunoprecipitations (26Benjannet S.

The antibodies used were the monoclonal V5-mAb (1:500; Invitrogen) and LDLR-C7-mAb (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and a rabbit antibody directed against amino acids 184–196 of human LDLR (1:400; Research Diagnostics Inc.). Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8% Tricine gels and autoradiographed. For Western blots, HepG2 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 5 mm NH4Cl overnight before cellular extraction in the above RIPA buffer lacking SDS. Most of these experiments were repeated at least three times. Quantitation was performed on a Storm Imager (Amersham Biosciences) by using the ImageQuant version 5.2 software. Subjects and FACS Analysis of Transformed Lymphoblasts—Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblasts (27Louie L.G. King M.C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 48: 637-638PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained for subjects either heterozygote for the S127R mutation in the PCSK9 gene or normolipidemic subjects (six of each) and a subject heterozygote for the P664L mutation in the LDLR gene. All subjects gave their informed consent. EBV-transformed lymphoblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (Biomedia), and 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma). Lymphoblasts were stained with the LDLR-C7-mAb for 30 min on ice. Cells were then stained with a goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to phycoerythrin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min on ice. Flow cytometry analysis was performed by using a FACScan Cytometer (BD Biosciences), and the data were analyzed using the CellQuest software package (BD Biosciences). For each sample, 10,000 live events were collected, and all results were confirmed by three independent experiments. Protein Solubilization, Western Blots, and LDLR and LRP1 Immunodetection—Cells in 60-mm plates were incubated for 24 h in MEM plus either 10% fetal bovine serum with no addition or 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum plus 50 μm compactin and 50 μm mevalonate as in Ref. 28Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar. The cells were washed, incubated for 10 min with 1.4% Triton X-100 buffer with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) on ice, and homogenized, and the lysate was clarified (29Yoshimura A. Yoshida T. Seguchi T. Waki M. Ono M. Kuwano M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13299-13308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fifty micrograms of proteins were analyzed by Western blot of LDLR (160 kDa) and LRP1 small subunit (85 kDa). The membranes were successively incubated with primary antibodies (1:400, LDLR; 1:3000, LRP1) and an appropriate secondary antibody and revealed using ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation was performed as above. LDL Isolation and 125I-Protein Labeling—Human normolipidemic plasma (Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) was supplemented with 0.3 mm EDTA, 3 mm sodium azide, 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μm Trolox before the isolation of lipoproteins, which was achieved by ultracentrifugation as described (30Hatch F.T. Adv. Lipid Res. 1968; 6: 1-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human LDL (d = 1.025–1.063 g/ml) were prepared as described (31Brissette L. Charest M.C. Falstrault L. Biochem.

The specific radioactivity was ∼1.5 × 105 cpm/μg of LDL or holotransferrin. 125I-LDL Degradation Assay—HepG2 cells in 6-well plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with 10 μg of 125I-LDL in a total volume of 500 μl containing 250 μl of MEM (2×) plus 4% BSA (MEM-BSA), pH 7.4, and the media were collected. The cells were washed once with 500 μl of PBS plus 0.2% BSA and twice with 1 ml of PBS. Incubation media plus the first wash were pooled and precipitated with 12% trichloroacetic acid. Cells incubated with 125I-LDL were homogenized in 1.5 ml of 0.2 n NaOH, and the protein content was assayed (33Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Degradation was estimated as μg of LDL protein/mg of cell protein. 125I-Holotransferrin Recycling Assay—To estimate the efficiency of iron-loaded holotransferrin (Sigma) recycling in HepG2 cells, cells in 12-well plates were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 0.5 μg of 125I-transferrin in 250 μl of MEM-BSA, pH 7.4 (pulse). Cell surface-bound 125I-transferrin was dissociated from the cells with three rapid washes with acetic saline (0.2 mm acetic acid and 500 mm NaCl, pH 2.5) on ice (34Hopkins C.R. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 508-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), followed by one wash with ice-cold PBS. Cells were re-fed with fresh MEM-BSA plus 50 μg/ml unlabeled transferrin, and the cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C (chase). Recycled 125I-transferrin was the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable fraction, whereas cell-associated (bound plus internalized) 125I-transferrin was measured by homogenizing the cells in 0.2 n NaOH. No degradation was detected during the chase phase. Microsequencing and Mass Spectrometry Analyses—Transfected HEK293 cells were pulse-labeled with 400 μCi/ml [3H]Ile. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with the V5-mAb, resolved by SDS-PAGE (8% Tricine gel), and blotted on an Immobilon PSQ membrane (Millipore) and autoradiographed. The identified radioactive NARC-1 protein was microsequenced as described previously (26Benjannet S. Elagoz A. Wickham L. Mamarbachi M. Munzer J.S. Basak A. Lazure C. Cromlish J.A. Sisodia S.

For cold sequencing, the secreted NARC-1 from the stable HepG2 transfectant was V5-immunoprecipitated, separated by SDS-PAGE (12% glycine gel), electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride, and the purified band microsequenced. For time-of-flight mass spectral analysis of immunocaptured V5-tagged NARC-1, 3 μl of 0.5 mg/ml protein A (in PBS, pH 8.2) was covalently bound to the spots of a pre-activated PS10 ProteinChip Array (Ciphergen Biosystems Inc., Palo Alto, CA) by incubation in a humid chamber at room temperature (RT) for 1 h. The protein A solution was removed, and residual pre-activated sites were blocked by incubation of the chip in 0.5 m ethanolamine in PBS (pH 8) for 15 min at room temperature. Following the blocking step, the chip was washed three times with PBS (pH 7.4) + 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. Cell lysates were prepared from stable HepG2 pools expressing V5-tagged NARC-1 or pIRES2-EGFP vector, grown in the absence or presence of 5 μg/ml tunicamycin for 18 h, and were preincubated with 1:1000 V5-mAb for 1 h at 4 °C and added to the spots containing protein A for 2 h at RT. Samples were removed, and the spots were sequentially washed at RT one time in PBS (pH 7.4) + 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min, three times in PBS (pH 7.4) for 15 min, and finally in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) for 1 min. The chip was allowed to dry at RT, and 1 μl of saturated sinapinic acid (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid; Sigma) in 50% acetonitrile + 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid was added to each spot. Mass spectral analysis was performed by surface-enhanced laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) in a Ciphergen Protein Biology System II (PBS II). Analyses represent an average of 100 shots, and masses were calibrated externally with All-in-1 Protein Standards (Ciphergen Biosystems Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Ribonucleic Acid Interference Knockdown of NARC-1 mRNA in HepG2 Cells—Three 19-mer double-stranded oligonucleotides were designed against different segments of human NARC-1 cDNA of the following sequences: 5′-AATGGTTCCGACTTGTCCTC-3′, 5′-AGCAAGTGTGACAGTCATGGC-3′, and 5′-AGGCATTCAATCCTCAGGTCT-3′. These were cloned into pRNA-U6.1 vector (GenScript), and hygromycin-resistant pools of stable HepG2 transfectants were used to isolate individual clones. Their level of human NARC-1 mRNA was estimated by Northern blotting by using a cDNA probe, spanning nucleotides 484–1059, as described (5Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Marcinkiewicz J. Jasmin S.B. Stifani S. Basak A. Prat A. Chretien M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Three selected clones, A, B, and C, were used to analyze the relative level of LDLR activity by fluorescent LDL uptake using FACS. The relative LDLR activity levels in the clones A–C were calculated with respect to the LDL uptake of control cells expressing the empty pRNA-U6.1 vector. In Vivo Expression of NARC-1 in Mice—Wild type female and LDLR(–/–) C57BL/6 mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle and fed a chow diet. Before each study, serum cholesterol levels were determined, and the mice were divided into two groups such that the mean plasma cholesterol levels in the groups were not different. Each group contained four mice. Statistical analyses were performed by Student's t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Mice were injected intravenously via the tail vein with 1 × 1011 particles of recombinant adenovirus on day 0 of the study. Blood was obtained from the retro-orbital plexus at various times before and after adenovirus injection. Mice were fasted 4 h before bleeding, and blood was always drawn at the same time of day. Aliquots of plasma were stored at –20 °C until analysis of lipids. Plasma cholesterol, HDL-C, and triglyceride levels were measured enzymatically on a Cobas Fara II (Roche Applied Science) using Sigma reagents. Non-HDL cholesterol levels were determined by subtracting HDL-C from the total cholesterol. Plasma samples (200 μl pooled from each group) were analyzed by FPLC (Amersham Biosciences) on Superose 6 columns in series as described previously (35Jin W. Millar J.S. Broedl U. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The cholesterol concentrations in the FPLC fractions were determined using an enzymatic assay (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Mutations Affecting the Zymogen Processing of NARC-1—We reported previously that the underlined residues in the prodomain sequence of proNARC-1, i.e. YVVVLKEETHL (where the underlined boldface L indicates the P1 cleavage position), play a critical role in the zymogen processing of pro-NARC-1 and concluded that Leu82↓ may represent the zymogen-processing site. This was also based on the microsequencing results of secreted [3H]Leu NARC-1 that showed a Leu at position 6 (see the above sequence KEETHL). However, this deduction was not consistent with the observed apparent molecular mass of ∼14 kDa on SDS-PAGE of the co-immunoprecipitating prosegment. It was indeed expected at ∼6 kDa if the segment composed amino acids 31–82, starting from the signal peptide cleavage site (position 30↓31) to the presumed zymogen-processing site (position 82↓83) (5Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Marcinkiewicz J. Jasmin S.B. Stifani S. Basak A. Prat A. Chretien M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Finally, N-terminal sequencing of NARC-1 by Edman's degradation was very inefficient and had to be repeated several times (5Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Marcinkiewicz J. Jasmin S.B. Stifani S. Basak A. Prat A. Chretien M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Thus, we have decided to reinvestigate the exact processing site of pro-NARC-1 by two complementary approaches. First, we prepared large batches of human NARC-1 secreted from HEK293 or HepG2 cells. Sequencing of secreted cold NARC-1 identified the first three N-terminal residues as Ser-Ile-Pro, and microsequencing of the [3H]Ile-labeled protein revealed an Ile at position 2. These data would predict that the zymogen-processing site is rather SSVFAQ↓SIPWNL158 (where Q indicates the P1 cleavage position). The presence of Leu158 at t"

In humans, signal detection techniques have been used to distinguish recollection and familiarity, respectively, in asymmetrical and curvilinear components of their receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, standard curves that represent item recognition across different levels of confidence or bias. To determine whether animals also employ multiple processes in recognition memory and to explore the anatomical basis of this distinction, we adapted these techniques to examine odour recognition memory in rats. Their ROC curve had asymmetrical and curvilinear components, indicating the existence of both recollection and familiarity in rats. Furthermore, following selective damage to the hippocampus the ROC curve became entirely symmetrical and remained curvilinear, supporting the view that the hippocampus specifically mediates the capacity for recollection."

Our findings reveal that the kidneys of males are much more susceptible to I/R than those of females. There is increased post-ischemic proximal tubule injury, apoptosis, and inflammation in males. This higher susceptibility in males is due more to the presence of testosterone than the absence of estrogen. Testosterone acts to inhibit NOS activation, Akt phosphorylation, and the post-ischemic increase in the ratio of extracellular signal related kinase (ERK) to c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, leading to greater inflammatory responses. The differences in ischemia susceptibility between male and female kidneys can be eliminated by castration of males or treatment of females with testosterone or dihydrotestosterone, which can not be aromatized to estrogen. The effects of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone are not inhibited by androgen receptor antagonists.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimal Preparation—Experiments were performed in age-matched (12Rabb H.

Differences were considered statistically significant at a p value of <0.05.RESULTSGender Differences on Renal Function and Morphology after Ischemia/Reperfusion—There were no significant changes of body weight after gonadectomy or treatment of BALB/c mice with hormones. Thirty minutes of kidney bilateral ischemia in male mice markedly reduced renal function as reflected by creatinine clearance (Fig. 1a, Ccr), fractional excretion of sodium (Fig. 1b, FENa), and plasma creatinine (Fig. 1c, Pcr), whereas this period of ischemia in females results in no measurable change in renal function (Fig. 1, a–c). Even when the ischemic time is extended to 45 min in females, there is only a small increase of Pcr (Fig. 1c). Consistent with the functional differences in Ccr and FENa, post-ischemic mortality is greater in males than in females exposed to 60 min of ischemia (Fig. 1d). Tubule damage is most severe in the outer medullary S3 segment of the proximal tubule (Fig. 1e) and much more severe in males than in females (Fig. 1, e and f). The gender differences in kidney ischemia are observed in a variety of mouse strains including C57BL/6, SV 129, and C57BL/6 + SV129 in addition to BALB/c (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Effect of mouse strain differences on ischemia-induced kidney injury. Various strains of mice were subjected to 30 min of bilateral ischemia at 36–38 °C. Plasma creatinine concentration was evaluated 24 h after bilateral ischemia. Results are the means ± S.E. *, p < 0.05 versus the respective control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Castration reduces plasma testosterone levels and daily testosterone administration (500 μg/kg of body weight) for 14 days to females significantly increases plasma testosterone levels to levels measured in intact male mice pretreated with vehicle (IMV) (Fig. 3a). Estrogen administration to males significantly increases the plasma estrogen levels to within the range measured in intact female mice pretreated with vehicle (IFV) plasma concentrations, and ovariectomy decreases the levels in females treated with vehicle (OFV) (Fig. 3b). There are no significant changes in plasma testosterone and estrogen after ischemia (Fig. 3, a and b).Fig. 3Effect of gender and hormonal modification on plasma testosterone (a) and estradiol (b) concentrations. Some BALB/c mice were subjected to gonadectomy on day 0. Mice were administered testosterone (500 μg/kg of BW), 17β-estradiol (40 μg/kg of BW), or vehicle (sesame oil) by subcutaneous injection daily for 14 days. Ischemia or sham surgery was performed on day 15. Plasma testosterone (a) and 17β-estradiol (b) concentrations were evaluated on day 16, 24 h after the last dose of estrogen, testosterone, or vehicle. Results are the means ± S.E. * and +, p < 0.05 versus respective controls of intact males (IMV) or intact females (IFV).

By contrast in ovariectomized females treated with vehicle (OFV), ischemia does not increase BUN and Pcr (Fig. 4, c and d). Thus increased plasma testosterone levels in females increases kidney susceptibility to ischemic injury whereas reduced estrogen levels in females does not enhance susceptibility to ischemia injury. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a non-aromatizable analogue of testosterone, administration to intact females results in an increase in Pcr 24 h after a 30-min period of ischemia (Fig. 4a). When tamoxifen, an antagonist of the estrogen receptor, is administrated to females, there is no increase in Pcr 24 h after 30 min of ischemia (Fig. 4b). Cyproterone, an antagonist of the androgen receptor, does not prevent the increased susceptibility to ischemia of testosterone-treated females (Fig. 4b) indicating that the effect of testosterone is not androgen receptor-mediated.Fig. 4Effect of hormonal modification on ischemia-induced kidney injury in female mice. Some BALB/c female mice were ovariectomized on day 0. Mice were administered testosterone (500 μg/kg of BW with the exception of the dose response in a), dihydrotestosterone (DHT, 500 μg/kg of BW), 17β-estradiol (40 μg/kg of BW), tamoxifen (5 mg/kg of BW), testosterone (500 μg/kg of BW) plus cytproterone (5 mg/kg of BW), or vehicle by subcutaneous injection daily for 14 days. On day 15 mice were subjected to 30 min of bilateral ischemia at 36–38 °C. Plasma creatinine (a–c) and BUN concentrations (d) were evaluated 24 h after 30 min of bilateral ischemia.

On day 15 mice were subjected to 30 min of bilateral ischemia at 36–38 °C. Plasma creatinine concentrations (a, c, and d) and BUN concentration (b) were evaluated 24 h after ischemia. Results are the means ± S.E. * and #, p < 0.05 versus control and ischemia of intact males pretreated with vehicle, respectively. E, 17β-estradioltreated; I, intact; T, testosterone-treated; V, vehicle-treated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In males, when testes are removed 15 days prior to ischemia, there is protection against ischemia with no increase observed in Pcr and BUN 24 h after I/R (Fig. 5, a and b). Testosterone treatment of castrated males restores susceptibility to I/R injury (Fig. 5, a and b). Estrogen treatment of intact males reduces the post-ischemic increase of Pcr and BUN compared with intact male mice pretreated with vehicle (Fig. 5, a–c) but not as much as what occurs with castration (Fig. 5, a and b). Neither treatment of males with cyproterone or flutamide, antagonists of the androgen receptor, affect the degree to which Pcr rises after ischemia (Fig. 5d). Tamoxifen, an antagonist of the estrogen receptor, does not prevent a beneficial effect of estrogen in males (Fig. 5d). Thus the presence of testosterone, rather than the absence of estrogen, appears to be more relevant to the increased susceptibility of males to I/R injury through non-genomic mechanisms, although pharmacological doses of estrogen have a protective effect in males.Tissue MPO Activity, RAW 264.7 Cell Trapping, and Expression of ICAM-1 as a Result of Ischemia/Reperfusion—Tissue MPO activity, an index of tissue leukocyte infiltration, is much greater in intact males after ischemia (IMV) than in females (IFV) (Fig. 6a). Gonadectomy reduces the post-ischemic MPO activity in males but not in females (Fig. 6a). Testosterone treatment of females results in increased post-ischemic MPO activity (Fig. 6a). When RAW 264.7 cells, a mouse monocyte/macrophage cell line, are injected intravenously into animals 30 min after ischemia, trapping is greater in males (IMV) than females (IFV) (Fig. 6b). Castration (CMV) decreases RAW cell trapping in males (Fig. 6b). Ischemia increases the expression of ICAM-1 to a greater extent in males than in females (Fig. 6c), and gonadectomy results in a diminished ICAM-1 response to ischemia in males and females (Fig. 6c). Thus increased postischemic MPO activity, RAW 264.7 cell trapping, and ICAM-1 expression are mitigated by castration in males (Fig. 6, a–c). Testosterone treatment of females potentiates ICAM-1 expression post-ischemia (Fig. 6c).Fig. 6Effect of gender and hormonal modification on ischemia-induced inflammatory responses. Some BALB/c mice were gonadectomized on day 0. Mice were administered testosterone (500 μg/kg of BW), 17β-estradiol (40 μg/kg of BW), or vehicle by subcutaneous injection daily for 14 days. On day 15, mice were subjected to 30 min of bilateral ischemia at 36–38 °C. a, tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was measured 4 h after 30 min of bilateral renal ischemia (n = 4–8). b, RAW 264.7 cells labeled with fluorescence microspheres were injected into the tail vein 30 min after 30 min of bilateral ischemia.

Castrated males (CMV) have no significant increase in base-line kidney cNOS activity but have a significant increase in post-ischemic cNOS activity when compared with post-ischemic activity in intact male kidneys (IMV) (Fig. 7a). By contrast, testosterone administration to females (IFT) inhibits the post-ischemic activation of kidney cNOS (Fig. 7a). Except for the IMV and IFT groups, ischemia resulted in increased kidney cNOS activity when compared with cNOS activity in their respective controls prior to ischemia (Fig. 7a). Castration significantly increases the basal activity of ciNOS, which is further increased with ischemia (Fig. 7b). Testosterone treatment of females inhibits the post-ischemic increase of ciNOS activity (Fig. 7b).Fig. 7Calcium-dependent (a) and calcium-independent (b) NOS activity in the mouse kidney.

Mice were administered testosterone (500 μg/kg of BW), 17β-estradiol (40 μg/kg of BW), or vehicle by subcutaneous injection daily for 14 days. On day 14 mice were subjected to 30 min of bilateral ischemia at 36–38 °C (a and b). Some mice (n = 4–12) are treated with l-arginine (Arg), l-NNA (NNA), or 0.9% NaCl (Veh, vehicle) 30 min before and after ischemia (d and e). Kidneys were harvested 30 min (a), 4 h (b), or 24 h (e) after ischemia to measure calcium-dependent (a) or calcium-independent (b) NOS activity and MPO (e) activity.

https://openalex.org/W2005786213,"A double null mouse line (2XENKO) lacking the xenobiotic receptors CAR (constitutive androstane receptor) (NR1I3) and PXR (pregnane X receptor) (NR1I2) was generated to study their functions in response to potentially toxic xenobiotic and endobiotic stimuli. Like the single knockouts, the 2XENKO mice are viable and fertile and show no overt phenotypes under normal conditions. As expected, they are completely insensitive to broad range xenobiotic inducers able to activate both receptors, such as clotrimazole and dieldrin. Comparisons of the single and double knockouts reveal specific roles for the two receptors. Thus, PXR does not contribute to the process of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity mediated by CAR, but both receptors contribute to the protective response to the hydrophobic bile acid lithocholic acid (LCA). As previously observed with PXR (Xie, W., Radominska-Pandya, A., Shi, Y., Simon, C. M., Nelson, M. C., Ong, E. S., Waxman, D. J., and Evans, R. M. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 98, 3375-3380), pharmacologic activation of CAR induces multiple LCA detoxifying enzymes and provides strong protection against LCA toxicity. Comparison of their responses to LCA treatment demonstrates that CAR predominantly mediates induction of the cytochrome p450 CYP3A11 and the multidrug resistance-associated protein 3 transporter, whereas PXR is the major regulator of the Na+-dependent organic anion transporter 2. These differential responses may account for the significant sensitivity of the CAR knockouts, but not the PXR knockouts, to an acute LCA dose. Because this sensitivity is not further increased in the 2XENKO mice, CAR may play a primary role in acute responses to this toxic endobiotic. These results define a central role for CAR in LCA detoxification and show that CAR and PXR function coordinately to regulate both xenobiotic and bile acid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2131148829,"Nerve impulses are propagated at nodes of Ranvier in the myelinated nerves of vertebrates. Internodal distances have been proposed to affect the velocity of nerve impulse conduction1; however, direct evidence is lacking, and the cellular mechanisms that might regulate the length of the myelinated segments are unknown. Ramón y Cajal described longitudinal and transverse bands of cytoplasm or trabeculae in internodal Schwann cells and suggested that they had a nutritive function2. Here we show that internodal growth in wild-type nerves is precisely matched to nerve extension, but disruption of the cytoplasmic bands in Periaxin-null mice impairs Schwann cell elongation during nerve growth. By contrast, myelination proceeds normally. The capacity of wild-type and mutant Schwann cells to elongate is cell-autonomous, indicating that passive stretching can account for the lengthening of the internode during limb growth. As predicted on theoretical grounds, decreased internodal distances strikingly decrease conduction velocities and so affect motor function. We propose that microtubule-based transport in the longitudinal bands of Cajal permits internodal Schwann cells to lengthen in response to axonal growth, thus ensuring rapid nerve impulse transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2171003478,"Receptors for the gaseous phytohormone ethylene show sequence similarity to bacterial two-component histidine kinases. These receptors are encoded by a multigene family that can be divided into subfamilies 1 and 2. It has been previously shown that a subfamily 1 Arabidopsis thaliana ethylene receptor, ETR1, autophosphorylates in vitro on a conserved histidine residue (1Gamble R.L. Coonfield M.L. Schaller G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7825-7829Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, sequence comparisons between the five ethylene receptor family members suggest that subfamily 2 members do not have all the motifs necessary for histidine kinase activity. Further, a tobacco subfamily 2 receptor, NTHK1, autophosphorylates on serines and threonines in vitro (2Xie C. Zhang J.S. Zhou H.L. Li J. Zhang Z.G. Wang D.W. Chen S.Y. Plant J. 2003; 33: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here we show that all five Arabidopsis ethylene receptor proteins autophosphorylate in vitro. We analyzed the nature of the phosphorylated amino acids by acid/base stability and bi-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis and demonstrated that unlike ETR1 all other ethylene receptors autophosphorylate predominantly on serine residues. ERS1, the only other subfamily 1 receptor, is able to phosphorylate on both histidine and serine residues in the presence of Mn2+. However, histidine autophosphorylation is lost when ERS1 is assayed in the presence of both Mg2+ and Mn2+, suggesting that this activity may not occur in vivo. Furthermore, mutation of the histidine residue conserved in two-component systems does not abolish serine autophosphorylation, eliminating the possibility of a histidine to serine phosphotransfer. Our biochemical observations complement the recently published genetic data that histidine kinase activity is not necessary for ethylene receptor function in plants and suggest that ethylene signal transduction does not occur through a phosphorelay mechanism.

Our biochemical observations complement the recently published genetic data that histidine kinase activity is not necessary for ethylene receptor function in plants and suggest that ethylene signal transduction does not occur through a phosphorelay mechanism. In bacteria, two-component signal transduction systems are involved in a variety of responses, including osmotic regulation, chemotaxis, and stress responses (reviewed in Ref. 3Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar). Canonical two-component signal transduction systems involve a sensor protein and a response regulator protein. In most cases the sensor consists of a variable amino-terminal domain located in the periplasm, two transmembrane regions, and a histidine kinase domain at the carboxyl terminus. The histidine kinase domain autophosphorylates in response to a given stimulus. The response regulator comprises a receiver domain and an effector domain. Following histidine autophosphorylation, the response regulator catalyzes the transfer of the phosphoryl group from the kinase domain of the sensor to an aspartate residue in its own receiver domain. The phosphorylation of the response regulator activates it, usually leading to a gain of DNA binding activity of its effector domain. Two-component proteins are also involved in more complex signaling pathways, termed phosphorelays. In these pathways the receptors are often hybrid proteins containing a receiver domain at the carboxyl terminus of their kinase domain. After autophosphorylation of the histidine residue in the kinase domain, the phosphoryl group is transferred intra-molecularly to the receiver domain. This phosphoryl group is subsequently transferred to a histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein and then to a response regulator protein, completing a phosphorelay (reviewed in Ref. 3Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar). Two-component and phosphorelay signaling systems exist in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for example, there is only one histidine kinase sensor protein, the osmolarity receptor SLN1 (4Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. Science. 1993; 262: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). SLN1 is a hybrid histidine kinase that transfers its phosphoryl group to a histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein, YPD1, which then transfers the phosphoryl group to the response regulator SSK1 (5Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, 6Maeda T. Takekawa M. Saito H. Science. 1995; 269: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). This phosphorelay signaling system has been shown to regulate the SSK2-PBS2-HOG1 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (7Posas F. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1385-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).

Ethylene gas functions as a hormone in plants, controlling many aspects of development and stress responses (15Abeles F.B. Morgan P.W. Saltveit M.E. Ethylene in Plant Biology. 2nd ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1992Google Scholar). There are five ethylene receptors in Arabidopsis thaliana, and genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that they are all active in ethylene signal transduction (16Hall A.E. Chen Q.H.G. Findell J.L. Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 17Hua J. Meyerowitz E.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 261-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). This receptor family can be further divided into two classes. ETR1 and ERS1 are sub-family 1 receptors and have all the conserved motifs necessary for histidine kinase activity (18Parkinson J.S. Kofoid E.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). The subfamily 2 class includes ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4. These proteins lack most of the motifs characteristic of histidine kinases, and EIN4 is the only one in this group containing the conserved histidine that is phosphorylated in two-component and phosphorelay systems. ETR1 autophosphorylates in vitro on this conserved histidine (1Gamble R.L. Coonfield M.L. Schaller G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7825-7829Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Like the yeast SLN1 signaling pathway, ethylene receptor signaling is thought to regulate the CTR1-SIMKK-SIMK/MMK3 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (19Ouaked F. Rozhon W. Lecourieux D. Hirt H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1282-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, because of the sequence divergence shown in Fig. 1A, it is doubtful that all the other family members can function as histidine kinases, even though they all function as ethylene receptors. Moreover, genetic data suggest that histidine autophosphorylation of ETR1 is not necessary for receptor function in ethylene signal transduction (20Chang C. Meyerowitz E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4129-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 21Wang W. Hall A.E. O'Malley R. Bleecker A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

There is significant evidence in the literature suggesting that histidine kinases can evolve into kinases that phosphorylate on serine residues. This phenomenon has been observed in the mitochondrial proteins branched chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (23Popov K.M. Zhao Y. Shimomura Y. Kuntz M.J. Harris R.A. J. Biol.

Chen S.Y. Plant J. 2003; 33: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here, we show that all five ethylene receptors autophosphorylate in vitro. However, ETR1 is the only family member that autophosphorylates exclusively on histidine residues. All other receptors show predominantly serine autophosphorylation under our assay conditions, and ERS1 autophosphorylates on both histidine and serine in the presence of Mn2+. However, histidine autophosphorylation is not observed when ERS1 is assayed in the presence of Mg2+ and Mn2+, suggesting that ERS1 might not have this activity in vivo unless a Mn2+ donor is present. Moreover, mutation studies show that the histidine residue conserved in histidine kinases is not required for the serine autophosphorylation of the ethylene receptors. Hence our results suggest that ethylene signal transduction in plants does not occur by a phosphorelay mechanism. Construction of Expression Plasmids—The soluble domains of the Arabidopsis thaliana ethylene receptors were amplified from cDNA clones with the following primers (engineered restriction sites are underlined): ETR1, 5′-AGCTCGGATCCGAAATGGGATTGATTCGAACTCA-3′ and 5′-ATCCAGGATCCTTACATGCCCTCGTACAGTACC-3′; ETR2, 5′-GAGCTTCCCGGGGAAGTTGGTTTGATTTTGATTAA-3′ and 5′-AGCCATCCCGGGTTAGAGAAGTTGGTCAGCTTGCAAC-3′; ETR-2ΔGAF, 5′-ATGGCGCCCGGGGACGCGTTGAGAGCGAGCCAAGC3′ and 5′-AGCCATCCCGGGTTAGAGAAGTTGGTCAGCTTGCAAC-3′; ERS1, 5′-AGTTAGGATCCGAAATGGGTCTTATTTTAACACA-3′ and 5′-TCCATGGATCCTCACCAGTTCCACGGTCTGGTTTGT-3′; ERS2, 5′-AGAGCTTAGATCTGAGGTTGGGATCATTATGAAGCA-3′ and 5′-CATGGATAGATCTTCAGTGGCTAGTAGACGGAGGAGTT-3′; and EIN4, 5′-AGCTTGGATCCGAGGTTGGATTGATGAAGAGGCA-3′ and 5′-AGGATGGATCCTCACTCGCTCGCGGTCTGCAAAGC-3′. ETR1, ERS1, and EIN4 PCR products were cut with BamHI and cloned into pESP-1 (Stratagene), ETR2 and ETR2-ΔGAF were cut with XmaI and cloned into pESP-1, and ERS2 was cut with BglII and cloned into the BamHI site of pESP-1. For the mutagenesis, we used the ExSite site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) on a BamHI-BamHI fragment containing receptor coding sequence cut from the previously described plasmids and cloned into pBSKS(+). The plasmids were methylated prior to mutagenesis. The primers used for the mutagenesis were as follows (nucleotide substitutions are underlined): ETR1-H, 5′-GAACACCGATGGCTGCGATTATTGCACT-3′ and 5′-GCATTTCAGCGTTCATAACCGCTAG-3′; ET-R2-H, 5′-CCTATGGCTTCGATACTCGGTCTTT-3′ and 5′-ACGCCTCATCCCTTCGCTCATCGTT-3′; ERS1-H, 5′-GGACACCGATGGCTGCCATCATCTCTCT-3′ and 5′-TCATCTCGGCGTTCATAACAGCTAG-3′; EI-N4-H, 5′-GGAGACCAATGGCCACAATTCTTGGTCT-3′ and 5′-TCATTCCAGCACTCATCACTTTCTG-3′; ETR1-G1, 5′-CAGCAGCAATAAATCCTCAAGAC-3′ and 5′-CAGAGTCTTTTACCTTCACTATA-3′; ERS1-G1, 5′-CGTGTGCAATTCACACACAAGAC-3′ and 5′-CTGTGTCCTTCACCTGCACAC-3′; ETR1-G2, 5′-ACTAGCACCGGAGCTTCTCGTCGCTAAAG-3′ and 5′-GCGCTTGCCCTCGCCATCTCCAAGA-3′; ERS1-G2, 5′-CAGCGGAATGGTTCCTCTGAGT-3′ and 5′-GAGCACTAGCGCTAGCTCTCTGTAAACGGTT-3′; ERS1-N1, 5′-TATGCTATTGTTAATCAGAAACGTCTGATGC-3′ and 5′-AGTTGGTAAGTCAGCAGACAGAATCAGATTCG-3′; ERS2-N1, 5′-AGGTCTTTCAAGCGATTTTGCACATGCTTGGGGTTC-3′ and 5′-TTCTATTATTACCTACGACGTAGTCAGGC-3′; ERS1-N2, 5′-CATCATGGCCAACGCTGTGAAGTTTACTAAGAAAGGCT-3′ and 5′-TTAAGAATTGTTTCCATCAGACGTTTCTCATCACC-3′; and ERS2-N2, 5′-TTGCACATGCTTGCGGTTCTAATGAATCGAAAGATC-3′ and 5′-AATCGCTTCAAAGACCTTCTTATCACCTACG-3′. The reverse primers were phosphorylated, and the cycle parameters for the mutagenesis followed the manufacturer's guidelines. Mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing and the mutated BamHI-BamHI fragment was returned to the expression vector. Expression of Recombinant Proteins—The recombinant constructs were transformed into Schizosaccharomyces pombe SP-Q01 (Stratagene) according to the ESP® yeast protein expression and purification system (Stratagene) protocol. Colonies that grew on agar plates of Edinburgh minimal media supplemented with thiamine were selected for screening. Colonies were grown in Edinburgh minimal media for 8 h and lysed with the Yeast-Buster kit (Novagen), according to manufacturer's protocol. Protein blots of total lysate with a goat anti-GST antibody (Amersham Biosciences) were used to determine expression levels of positive clones. Expressing clones were grown in 50 ml yeast extract supplemented media for 18 h (3.0 ≤ A600 ≤ 4.0) and were used to inoculate 50 ml of yeast extract supplemented media to an A600 of 0.4. After a 5-h growth period (A600 ≈ 1.0) the cells were washed twice with 50 ml of sterile water and resuspended in 500 ml of Edinburgh minimal media (A600 ≈ 0.1). The culture was incubated at 30 °C for 18–22 h (1.8 ≤ A600 ≤ 2.2). Proteins were extracted by vortexing at 4 °C with 1× PBST (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 1% (v/v) Triton® X-100) with glass beads (425–600 μm, Sigma) and protease inhibitors: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 1 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma), 1 μg/ml chymostatin (Sigma), 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture for fungal and yeast extracts (Sigma). Recombinant proteins were purified from clarified lysate on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) column, which was washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4). GST 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; Hsp, heat shock protein.-tagged proteins were eluted with elution solution (10 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20% (v/v) glycerol). For proteins purified without the GST tag, instead of elution solution columns were eluted with thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) in 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Eluted proteins were concentrated with Centriplus YM-50 (Amicon) and the buffer was exchanged for storage solution (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25% (v/v) glycerol). Purification of recombinant protein was confirmed by protein blot, using goat anti-GST (Amersham Biosciences) or mouse anti-FLAG® (Stratagene) antibodies. Proteins were aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. Autophosphorylation Assay—50 pmol of purified recombinant protein were assayed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2 (or MnCl2), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP (1 Ci/mmol ≈ 1500 cpm/pmol). The reaction buffer with both Mg2+ and Mn2+ contained 0.15 mm MnCl2 and 10 mm MgCl2+. Mg2+ and Mn2+ concentrations in solution were calculated using a BASIC version of the COMICS program by Perrin and Sayce (29Perrin D.D. Sayce I.G. Talanta. 1967; 14: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) using the stability constants described in Ref. 30O'Sullivan W.J. Smithers G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 294-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar. The reaction buffer for the autophosphorylation of calcium-dependant protein kinase α contained 0.12 mm CaCl2 and 10 mm MgCl2. Reactions were incubated for 60 min at 25 °C and stopped by adding 5× loading dye (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 500 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (w/v) SDS, 0.5% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 50% (v/v) glycerol) and boiling for 3 min. Reactions were run on 8% SDS-PAGE and blotted to PVDF membrane (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences) using a three-solution semidry protein blotting protocol for 30 min at 16 V optimized to a lower pH to avoid loss of phosphoester linkages. Following is the blotting setup in brief, from anode to cathode: one sheet of filter paper (Whatman) wet with anode 1 solution (300 mm Tris, pH 9.5, 10% (v/v) methanol), two sheets wet in anode 2 solution (25 mm Tris, pH 9.5, 10% (v/v) methanol), PVDF membrane, gel, and three sheets wet in cathode solution (25 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 20% (v/v) methanol, 0.3% (w/v) glycine). Phosphate incorporation was visualized by autoradiography. Acid/Base Stability Assay—Autophosphorylation reactions were performed as above in triplicate for each treatment. After blotting, PVDF membranes were incubated for 16 h at room temperature in 1 m HCl, 3 m NaOH, or 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Protein bands were cut from the membrane and counted in scintillation fluid. The average for the counts of the acid and base treatments was normalized with respect to the counts for the control treatment (Tris-HCl). Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Autophosphorylation reactions were performed in 50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2 (or MnCl2), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 μm [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol). After blotting, protein bands were cut from PVDF membranes and hydrolyzed in 100 μl 6 n HCl (Pierce) for 1 h at 110 °C. Membrane was removed and hydrolyzed amino acids were lyophilized and resuspended in pH 1.9 buffer (2.2% (v/v) formic acid, 7.8% (v/v) acetic acid) containing 100 μg/ml each phosphoamino acid standard (Ser-P, Thr-P, Tyr-P, Sigma). Bi-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis was performed as described in Liu et al. (31Liu G.Z. Pi L.Y. Walker J.C. Ronald P.C. Song W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20264-20269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and plates were visualized by autoradiography. All Five Ethylene Receptors Autophosphorylate in Vitro—The ethylene receptors show four distinct domains: a membrane spanning domain that is the ethylene binding site (32Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B. Science. 1995; 270: 1809-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), a GAF domain that is a secondary structure motif and putative binding site for small molecules (33Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), a kinase domain with sequence similarity to histidine kinases (Fig. 1), and a receiver domain as found in response regulator proteins (reviewed in Ref. 3Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar). The receiver domain is absent from two of the ethylene receptors, ERS1 and ERS2 (10Hua J. Chang C. Sun Q. Meyerowitz E.M. Science. 1995; 269: 1712-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 11Hua J. Sakai H. Nourizadeh S. Chen Q.H.G. Bleecker A.B. Ecker J.R. Meyerowitz E.M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). To produce proteins suitable for in vitro enzyme assays, the soluble domains of the Arabidopsis ethylene receptors were cloned into pESP1 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These constructs included the GAF domain, the kinase domain, and the receiver domain, when the latter was present in the native protein. The soluble domains of all five ethylene receptors were expressed in S. pombe, each with a GST tag attached to their amino terminus (Fig. 2A). A 75-kDa protein co-purified with most ethylene receptors and could not be removed even after extensive washes. Sequencing of the ETR2 75-kDa contaminating band determined that the co-purifying protein was the heat shock protein Hsp70 (data not shown). The molecular chaperone Hsp70 is usually removed by addition of Mg2+ and ATP to the column washes (34Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7249-7256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which could interfere with the in vitro autophosphorylation activity of the ethylene receptors. Because Hsp70 has not been shown to have kinase activity, it was not removed from the reaction mixture. Purified recombinant receptors were tested for autophosphorylation in vitro as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and results are shown in Fig. 2B. As previously reported (1Gamble R.L. Coonfield M.L. Schaller G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7825-7829Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), ETR1 required Mn2+ for autophosphorylation and did not function in the presence of Mg2+. ERS1 and ERS2 autophosphorylated in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+, whereas ETR2 and EIN4 had a higher activity in the presence of Mg2+. Elution of proteins from the Sepharose beads led to slight degradation of the purified proteins, which could be seen on a protein blot with antibodies against the GST tag (data not shown). Some of these degradation products also appeared as phosphorylated bands in the autophosphorylation assays (Fig. 2) either because of their retaining of autophosphorylation activity or as substrate to the full-length receptor. The recombinant EIN4 protein was very unstable and could not be purified in large quantities. Several independent EIN4 clones were tested with similar results in the autophosphorylation assay (data not shown). It is interesting to note that ERS2, ETR2, and EIN4 were able to phosphorylate Hsp70 in the presence of Mg2+ and to a lesser extent in the presence Mn2+. Hsp70 phosphorylation by the ethylene receptors might not be altogether circumstantial because Hsp70 has been shown to interact with receptors and kinases to activate stress responses in eukaryotes (reviewed in Ref. 35Nollen E.A. Morimoto R.I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, GST alone showed no phosphorylation in Mg2+, indicating that phosphorylation is dependent on the ethylene receptors being present in the reaction mixture. Trace levels of incorporation were observed for GST in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 2C), which are probably caused by nonspecific incorporation. As most of the receptors (except ETR1) show higher levels of incorporation in the presence of Mg2+, we do not think our results are caused by a contaminating kinase from yeast phosphorylating the GST tag. Moreover, autophosphorylation was also observed when ERS1 was purified without the GST tag (ERS1-GST(–), Fig. 2C), indicating that the site of phosphorylation is internal to the receptor. ERS1-GST(–) showed the same phosphorylation pattern discussed below for the fusion protein (data not shown). It should also be observed that no Hsp70 is phosphorylated in the ERS1-GST(–) lane. Hence the Hsp70 phosphorylation is also not caused by a contaminating kinase from yeast and is specific to subfamily 2 receptors. We also tested whether the GAF domain is required for autophosphorylation by using an ETR2 construct lacking this domain (ETR2-ΔGAF, Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, ETR2-ΔGAF showed the same autophosphorylation pattern as the full-length ETR2 construct. This result suggests that the GAF domain is not the site of autophosphorylation. Hence, the phosphorylated residue must reside in the kinase domain because ERS1 and ERS2 do not contain receiver domains (10Hua J. Chang C. Sun Q. Meyerowitz E.M. Science. 1995; 269: 1712-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 11Hua J. Sakai H. Nourizadeh S. Chen Q.H.G. Bleecker A.B. Ecker J.R. Meyerowitz E.M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Nature of Phosphorylated Amino Acid in Each Receptor—To determine the nature of the phosphorylated amino acid, autophosphorylated proteins were incubated in acid or base as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Phosphorylated histidine residues form phosphoamidate bonds that are sensitive to acid and resistant to base, whereas phosphorylations on serine or threonine produce phosphoester bonds that are acid-resistant and base-labile. Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation is resistant to both acid and base, whereas aspartate phosphorylation is labile in both acid and base (36Duclos B. Marcandier S. Cozzone A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). As has been previously reported (1Gamble R.L. Coonfield M.L. Schaller G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7825-7829Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), autophosphorylation of ETR1 in the presence of Mn2+ resulted in a base stable phosphorylated residue under our assay conditions consistent with histidine autophosphorylation (Fig. 3A). No incorporation was quantified from ETR1 reactions containing Mg2+. We used a calcium-dependent protein kinase as a positive control for acid stability because it autophosphorylates on serines and threonines in the presence of Mg2+ (37Putnam-Evans C.L. Harmon A.C. Cormier M.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2488-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and results are shown in Fig. 3A. As shown in Fig. 3A, phosphorylated ERS1, ETR2, EIN4, and ERS2 showed acid stability in the presence of Mg2+ indicating a phosphoester bond formation. In the presence of Mn2+, ERS1 showed partial resistance to both acid and base, suggesting that this protein can produce phosphoamidate and phosphoester linkages in the presence of this metal. The subfamily 2 class of ethylene receptors only produced phosphoester linkages independent of the metal present in the reaction mixture (Fig. 3A). Our cutoff value for the acid/base assay was 100 cpm; all of the values were obtained from triplicate reactions, and each recombinant protein was assayed at least twice. Low levels of incorporation (below the cutoff) were quantified from ETR2 reactions containing Mn2+, but ETR2-ΔGAF and EIN4 in the same buffer showed enough incorporation for quantification (Fig. 3A). Bi-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis was used to determine whether the phosphoester bond was formed on serines, threonines, tyrosines, or combinations thereof. As shown in Fig. 3B, ERS1 only autophosphorylated on serine residues in the presence of Mg2+. All receptors were tested in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+, and all except ETR1 autophosphorylated predominantly on serine residues (data not shown). ETR1 did not show any significant phosphorylation on serine, threonine, or tyrosine in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 3B), and Hsp70 phosphorylation also occurred predominantly on serine residues (data not shown). Faint traces of threonine phosphorylation were observed for ERS2 in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 3B). To address the biological relevance of the different autophosphorylated sites of ERS1 we tested for autophosphorylation in the presence of both Mg2+ and Mn2+. As the cellular concentration of Mg2+ is 50- to 100-fold higher than that of Mn2+ (reviewed in Ref. 38Mukhopadhyay M.J. Sharma A. Bot. Rev. 1991; 57: 117-149Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the autophosphorylation reaction was performed taking this ratio into account. Under the conditions used for the autophosphorylation reaction the calculated apparent concentrations of free Mg2+ and"
https://openalex.org/W1982072860,"The phytotoxin coronatine is a structural analog of octadecanoid signaling molecules, which are well known mediators of plant defense reactions. To isolate novel coronatine-regulated genes from Arabidopsis thaliana, differential mRNA display was performed. Transcript levels of CORI-7 (coronatine induced-7) were rapidly and transiently increased in coronatine-treated plants, and the corresponding cDNA was found to encode the sulfotransferase AtST5a. Likewise, upon wounding, an immediate and transient increase in AtST5a mRNA levels could be observed in both locally wounded and unwounded (systemic) leaves. Furthermore, application of octadecanoids and ethylene as compounds involved in plant wound defense reactions resulted in AtST5a gene activation, whereas pathogen defense-related signals (yeast elicitor and salicylic acid) were inactive. AtST5a and its close homologs AtST5b and AtST5c were purified as His6 -tagged proteins from Escherichia coli. The three enzymes were shown to catalyze the final step in the biosynthesis of the glucosinolate (GS) core structure, the sulfation of desulfoglucosinolates (dsGSs). They accept a broad range of dsGSs as substrates. However, in a competitive situation, AtST5a clearly prefers tryptophan- and phenylalanine-derived dsGSs, whereas long chain dsGSs derived from methionine are the preferred substrates of AtST5b and AtST5c. Treatment of Arabidopsis plants with low concentrations of coronatine resulted in an increase in the amounts of specific GSs, primarily glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin. Hence, it is suggested that AtST5a is the sulfotransferase responsible for the biosynthesis of tryptophan-derived GSs in vivo.

Compared with the animal cell, very little is known regarding the structural and regulatory roles of the sulfate group in plants.

Members of the superfamily of sulfotransferases are known in prokaryotes as well as eukaryotes; however, the study of enzymes that catalyze the sulfation reaction in plants considerably lags behind that in animal systems. Cytosolic sulfotransferases from plants have been characterized in some detail (Ref. 1Varin L. Marsolais F. Richard M. Rouleau M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar and references therein), and some cDNAs have been identified. These fall into three subgroups: the flavonol sulfotransferases described for Flaveria species (1Varin L. Marsolais F. Richard M. Rouleau M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the steroid sulfotransferases identified in Brassica napus (2Rouleau M. Marsolais F. Richard M. Nicolle L. Voigt B. Adam G.

Wasternack C. Varin L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17895-17900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). An additional sulfotransferase (RaR047, At2g03760) has been cloned from A. thaliana, and its mRNA level was found to be up-regulated by pathogens and salicylic acid; however, its physiological substrate is still unknown (5Lacomme C. Roby D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In plants, sulfate groups occur in a number of secondary metabolites, notably the sulfoflavonoids (6Barron D. Varin L. Ibrahim R.K. Harborne J.B. Williams C.A. Phytochemistry. 1988; 27: 2375-2395Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and the glucosinolates (7Halkier B.A. Du L.C. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 425-431Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Glucosinolates (GSs) are secondary compounds found in at least 16 different plant families, 15 of which belong to the order Capparales (for review, see Ref. 8Fahey J.W. Zalcmann A.T. Talalay P. Phytochemistry. 2001; 56: 5-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar). Within this order, much interest has been directed to the Brassicaceae family: the genus Brassica alone contains a large number of agriculturally important crops, including many vegetables (e.g. broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and cabbage) and one of the most important oilseed crops, oilseed rape (B. napus), the defatted seed meal of which is fed to animals. GSs in edible species or seed meal have attracted much attention because their breakdown products have been described to have anticancer but also goitrogenic and anti-nutritional activities. Although many functions such as sulfur and nitrogen storage have been assigned to GSs, defense against herbivores and pathogens seems to be their main function. Upon wounding, GSs are hydrolyzed by a thioglucosidase called myrosinase, and the released unstable aglycons rearrange to form isothiocyanates, thiocyanates, nitriles, and other compounds, the production of which depends on the GS itself, the reaction conditions, and the presence of certain cofactors (for review, see Ref. 9Rask L. Andreasson E. Ekbom B. Eriksson S. Pontoppidan B. Meijer J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 93-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). These compounds have antimicrobial activity and are toxic or deterrent to non-specialist herbivores. Much progress has been made recently in identifying the gene products involved in the biosynthesis of GSs (Fig. 1): aldoxime-forming and aldoxime-oxidizing cytochrome P450 enzymes characterized by different substrate specificities have been identified (10Mikkelsen M.D. Hansen C.H.

C-S lyase, the enzyme catalyzing the subsequent step in GS biosynthesis, was identified recently as the SUPERROOT1 gene product (SUR1) (20Mikkelsen M.D. Naur P. Halkier B.A. Plant J. 2004; 37: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and the gene encoding UDP-glucose:thiohydroximate glycosyltransferase was cloned from B. napus (21Marillia E.F. MacPherson J.M. Tsang E.W. Van Audenhove K. Keller W.A. GrootWassink J.W. Physiol. Plant. 2001; 113: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The final step in the biosynthesis of the GS core structure is catalyzed by a desulfoglucosinolate:PAPS sulfotransferase (dsGS-ST), transferring the sulfate moiety from PAPS to the desulfoglucosinolate (dsGS). The enzymatic activity of dsGS-STs has been analyzed in partially purified protein fractions from Brassica juncea and cress (Lepidium sativum) (22Glendening T.M. Poulton J.E. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Jain J.C. GrootWassink J. Kolenovsky A.D. Underhill E.W. Phytochemistry. 1990; 29: 1425-1428Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The enzymes have similar biochemical characteristics with respect to native molecular mass, isoelectric point, pH, and temperature optima as well as inhibition by various sulfhydryl group reagents. Furthermore, the enzyme from cress was found to prefer desulfobenzylglucosinolate over desulfosinigrin. However, the corresponding proteins have not been purified to homogeneity; and until now, genes encoding dsGS-STs have not been identified. Here, we report the cloning and functional expression of a small family of such desulfoglucosinolate-specific sulfotransferases from A. thaliana. Chemicals—High quality PAPS (95% minimum) was obtained from Prof. H. R. Glatt (German Institute of Human Nutrition, Berholz-Rehbruecke, Germany). 12-Hydroxyjasmonic acid was a kind gift from Dr. C. Wasternack (Institute of Plant Biochemistry, Halle an der Saale, Germany). 11-Hydroxyjasmonic acid was purified from suspension cultures of Eschscholtzia californica as described by Xia and Zenk (24Xia Z.-Q. Zenk M.H. Planta Med. 1993; 59: 575-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Synthesis of [13C2]Glucobrassicin was as described by Müller and Weiler (25Müller A. Weiler E.W. Planta. 2000; 211: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Sinigrin (allylglucosinolate) and benzylglucosinolate were obtained from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium) and Merck Biosciences (Schwalbach, Germany), respectively. Plant Material—A. thaliana ecotypes C24 and Col-0 were grown in a greenhouse. Prior to treatment, plants were transferred to a phytotron chamber (8-h photoperiod at 20 °C and 150 μmol of photons (400–700 nm) cm–2 s–1; 16 h of darkness at 18 °C; 70% relative humidity) for at least 3 days. Treatment of Plants—Wounding was done using a hemostat and crushing across ∼80–100% of the area of a specific leaf. The leaves of one-half of a rosette were treated in this way; the opposite half of the rosette was left undamaged to allow differentiation of local and systemic effects. Application of compounds dissolved in 40% (v/v) acetone and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 was performed by spraying plant rosettes until leaves were wet. Control plants were treated with the solvent alone. Plant material was frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after harvesting. General Molecular Biological and Biochemical Methods—If applicable, the standard protocols of Ausubel et al. (26Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2004Google Scholar) and Sambrook and Russell (27Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) were used. Plant RNA was prepared according to Barkan (28Barkan A. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Ten micrograms of total RNA were separated on formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred onto nylon membranes, and hybridized with a radiolabeled probe using standard laboratory procedures. The probe for AtST5a mRNA corresponded to nucleotides 22–470 of the AtST5a cDNA. cDNA synthesis, PCR amplification, and DNA restriction and ligation followed the manufacturers' protocols. Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Semiquantitative RT-PCR was done using the cMaster RTplus PCR system (Eppendorf, Wesseling-Berzdorf, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. Contaminating DNA in the RNA preparations was digested with the RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). This step was critical because the AtST5 genes contain no introns, and amplification could therefore result from genomic DNA. Absence of DNA after digestion was confirmed by PCR using the RNA as template. Specificities of AtST5 primers were tested using the respective plasmid DNA as template. RT-PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 5 min; 25–30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 60 s; followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. After electrophoretic separation, PCR products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and quantified using the TINA 2.0 program (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). The data were normalized to signals obtained by RT-PCR of the actin-1 gene. Cloning and Bacterial Expression of cDNAs Encoding Selected Sulfotransferases from Arabidopsis—The AtST1 cDNA (plasmid pRaR047) was kindly provided by Dr. D. Roby (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique/Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Castanet-Tolosan, France) (5Lacomme C. Roby D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The AtST5a gene was originally identified by differential mRNA display as a coronatine-induced gene (CORI-7) in A. thaliana (29Lopukhina A. Dettenberg M. Weiler E.W. Hollander-Czytko H. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1678-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragment obtained encompassed 514 bp and was identified to be part of the Arabidopsis expressed sequence tag clone OBO154 (GenBank™/EBI accession number F14418). Nevertheless, this 1165-bp expressed sequence tag clone still displayed an incomplete 5′-end. The missing sequence was generated by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends/PCR (30Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4333) Google Scholar) using cDNA from coronatine (5 μm, 2 h)-treated plants as template. Meanwhile, the corresponding genomic sequence of AtST5a (AGI code At1g74100) was obtained within the scope of the Arabidopsis Genome Project. For expression of Arabidopsis sulfotransferases as N-terminally RGS-His6-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli M15, the corresponding cDNA regions were amplified from plasmid templates (among others, the pUNI51 clones U50569 and U50309, containing the cDNAs encoding AtST5b and AtST5c, respectively) by PCR and cloned into pQE-30 (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) using the KpnI/PstI (AtST5a) and BamHI/SalI (AtST1, AtST5b, and AtST5c) restriction sites. 2Primer sequences are available upon request. The recombinant RGS-His6-tagged proteins were purified under native conditions using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose according to the manufacturer's protocol (QIAGEN). The eluted protein was immediately desalted using Sepharose G-25 (PD-10 columns, Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.0) and 1 mm dithiothreitol, shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Assay for Sulfotransferase Activity—Assays for sulfotransferase activity of the recombinant proteins were performed at 30 °C in a total volume of 100 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing PAPS (20–200 μm), substrate (20–200 μm dsGS), and purified protein (10 μg). dsGSs were extracted from the leaves and seeds of A. thaliana ecotypes Col-0 and C24 and purified by HPLC as described below. Controls were identical but contained no protein. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 300 μl of ice-cold methanol to precipitate the protein. At that point, protein was also added to the controls to ensure comparable conditions between samples and controls in the subsequent steps. After 2 h at –80 °C, the precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation, and the supernatant was taken to dryness and subsequently resuspended in 100 μl of water. Insoluble material was precipitated by an additional centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC. HPLC was performed on a Hyperclone 5μ BDS C18–1 (1 × 250 mm; Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany) using a LaChrom Elite HPLC workstation equipped with a diode array detector (VWR International, Darmstadt, Germany). HPLC conditions were as described elsewhere (31Petersen B.L. Chen S. Hansen C.H. Olsen C.E. Halkier B.A. Planta. 2002; 214: 562-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Preparation and Analysis of Glucosinolates in A. thaliana—Extraction of GSs from plant material and purification as dsGSs were performed as described by Brown et al. (32Brown P.D. Tokuhisa J.G. Reichelt M. Gershenzon J. Phytochemistry. 2003; 62 (J. G.): 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). For quantification, 1.25 μmol of benzylglucosinolate were added as an internal standard at the beginning of the extraction procedure. dsGSs were separated by HPLC as described (31Petersen B.L. Chen S. Hansen C.H. Olsen C.E. Halkier B.A. Planta. 2002; 214: 562-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Individual dsGSs were identified by their UV-visible spectra and quantified by comparison with the internal standard. These values were corrected for the response factors for the different dsGSs. A list of these response factors is given by Brown et al. (32Brown P.D. Tokuhisa J.G. Reichelt M. Gershenzon J. Phytochemistry. 2003; 62 (J. G.): 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Identification of a Coronatine-induced Sulfotransferase— The structure of the phytotoxin coronatine is comparable with those of the octadecanoids 12-oxophytodienoic acid and jasmonic acid (33Weiler E.W. Kutchan T.M. Gorba T. Brodschelm W. Niesel U. Bublitz F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Differential mRNA display (34Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4694) Google Scholar) was performed to identify novel coronatine-regulated genes in A. thaliana (29Lopukhina A. Dettenberg M. Weiler E.W. Hollander-Czytko H. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1678-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For this purpose, mRNA from coronatine (5 μm, 2 h)- or solvent-treated plants was applied. Eight differentially regulated genes were studied in more detail, and up-regulated genes were tentatively assigned as CORI (coronatine induced). The sequence of the amplified cDNA fragment of CORI-7 (514 bp) was identical to that of the A. thaliana At1g74100 gene, coding for a sulfotransferase family member. In A. thaliana, 18 genes for soluble sulfotransferases are known (Fig. 2) (35Klein M. Papenbrock J. J. Exp. Bot. 2004; 55: 1809-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). One gene, At3g51210 (omitted from Fig. 2), seems to represent a pseudogene encoding a polypeptide that consists simply of 67 amino acids corresponding to the C-terminal region of sulfotransferases; and up to now, no expressed sequence tag clone has been present in the data bases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that CORI-7 forms a small subfamily together with two other sulfotransferases encoded by the At1g18590 and At1g74090 genes (Fig. 2 and Table I). According to the nomenclature introduced by Marsolais et al. (3Marsolais F. Sebastia C.H. Rousseau A. Varin L. Plant Sci. 2004; 166: 1359-1370Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36Marsolais F. Gidda S.K. Boyd J. Varin L. Recent Adv. Phytochem. 2000; 34: 433-456Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar), these sulfotransferases are called AtST5a (CORI-7), AtST5b (At1g74090), and AtST5c (At1g18590). This small subfamily is orthologous to the flavonol sulfotransferase family known from two different Flaveria species (Fig. 2). The closest relatives to this subfamily in A. thaliana are AtST2a and AtST2b (encoded by the At5g07010 and At5g07000 genes, respectively). AtST2a has been identified recently as hydroxyjasmonate sulfotransferase, specifically sulfating 11- and 12-hydroxyjasmonate (4Gidda S.K. Miersch O. Levitin A. Schmidt J. Wasternack C. Varin L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17895-17900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, hydroxy-jasmonates are very unlikely substrates for the AtST5 subfamily of sulfotransferases since even AtST2b, the closest homolog of AtST2a, is not able to sulfate these compounds (4Gidda S.K.

The following phytohormones, when applied exogenously at 50 μm, did not significantly alter the CORI-7 transcript levels within 2 days: abscisic acid, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, gibberellin A3, kinetin, and salicylic acid (data not shown). However, its mRNA levels specifically and transiently increased upon application of coronatine (5 μm; positive control), jasmonic acid (50 μm), or the jasmonic acid precursor 12-oxophytodienoic acid (50 μm). In addition, the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (50 μm) induced a transient increase in the CORI-7 gene product (Fig. 3A). The increase in mRNA levels stimulated by coronatine, 12-oxophytodienoic acid, or 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid differed from that induced by jasmonic acid in that the latter was delayed. Whereas elevated mRNA levels could already be observed 1 h after coronatine, 12-oxophytodienoic acid, or 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid treatment, the effect of jasmonic acid was first detectable after 4 h. Wounding of leaves resulted in a rapid and transient local accumulation of CORI-7 mRNA and a comparable systemic effect, i.e. accumulation in unwounded leaves (Fig. 3B). Likewise, UV-C illumination induced a transient increase, whereas yeast elicitor (10 mg/ml) was ineffective (data not shown). Taken together, the levels of CORI-7 mRNA were strongly influenced by wounding and signaling compounds (octadecanoids and ethylene) mediating plant wound defense reactions, whereas pathogen defense-related signals (yeast elicitor and salicylic acid) were inactive. RT-PCR was used to analyze the expression of the other AtST5 genes after application of coronatine (5 μm) and jasmonic acid methyl ester (MeJA; 250 μm) (Fig. 3C). Plants were harvested 2 h after spraying. The AtST5a gene was up-regulated 2.4- and 1.8-fold by coronatine and MeJA, respectively. AtST5b was only slightly (if at all) induced by coronatine (1.3-fold) and was unchanged by MeJA, whereas AtST5c showed a 2.4-fold induction by coronatine and a negligible (1.2-fold) induction by MeJA. Enzymes of the AtST5 Subfamily Are Functional Desulfoglucosinolate Sulfotransferases—The cDNAs for the AtST5 enzymes were cloned into the pQE-30 vector for bacterial expression of N-terminally His6-tagged proteins. The proteins could be purified under native conditions by Ni2+ chelate affinity chromatography (Fig. 4). For comparison, the cDNA for AtST1 (RaR047, encoded by At2g03760), a sulfotransferase also described to be up-regulated by jasmonic acid (5Lacomme C. Roby D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), was cloned and expressed in the same manner. In initial experiments, a range of known sulfotransferase substrates were tested using recombinant AtST5a. However, sulfation of quercetin, 17β-estradiol, brassinolide, 24-epibrassinolide, castasterone, 24-epicastasterone, and 11- and 12-hydroxyjasmonic acid could not be observed. Thus, it was considered unlikely that these or structurally similar compounds are potential substrates in vivo. Since GS levels increase in members of the Brassicaceae family after wounding and jasmonate treatment (e.g. Refs. 37Bodnaryk R.P. Phytochemistry. 1992; 31: 2671-2677Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 38Bodnaryk R.P. Phytochemistry. 1994; 35: 301-305Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 39Doughty K.J. Kiddle G.A. Pye B.J. Wallsgrove R.M. Pickett J.A. Phytochemistry. 1995; 38: 347-350Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar) we considered dsGSs, the immediate precursors of GSs, as possible substrates. Upon incubation of the AtST5 enzymes with a mixture of several dsGSs (total amount of 14 nmol) in the presence of 2 nmol of PAPS, turnover of dsGSs was observed, while at the same time, the formation of new substances could be detected (Fig. 5A and Table II). To investigate whether these products are indeed GSs, the reaction product formed from indole-3-methyl (I3M)-dsGS (desulfoglucobrassicin) by AtST5a was purified by HPLC and further analyzed by electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The relative molecular mass of the product in negative ion mode was 447.0515, which is a deviation of 3.8 ppm from the expected relative"
https://openalex.org/W1986158733,"Diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) and the structurally related compound diphenyliodonium (DIP) are widely used as inhibitors of flavoenzymes, particularly NADPH oxidase. Here we report further evidence that DPI and DIP are not specific flavin binders. A 3-h incubation of N11 glial cells with DPI significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent way both the pentose phosphate pathway and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In parallel, we observed a dose-dependent increase of reactive oxygen species generation and lipoperoxidation and increased leakage of lactate dehydrogenase activity in the extracellular medium. The glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio decreased, whereas the efflux of glutathione out of the cells increased. This suggests that DPI causes an augmented oxidative stress and exerts a cytotoxic effect in N11 cells. Indeed, the cells were protected from these events when loaded with glutathione. Similar results were observed using DIP instead of DPI and also in other cell types. We suggest that the DPI-elicited inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle may be mediated by the blockade of several NAD(P)-dependent enzymes, such as glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and lactate dehydrogenase. In light of these results, we think that some effects of DPI or DIP in in vitro and in vivo experimental models should be interpreted with caution.

NADPH oxidases are a group of plasma membrane-associated enzymes found in a variety of cells of mesodermal origin. The most thoroughly studied is the leukocyte isoform, which catalyzes the production of superoxide (O2.¯) by the one-electron reduction of oxygen, using NADPH as the reducing agent (11Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The O2.¯ generated by NADPH oxidase serves as the starting material for the production of a vast assortment of reactive oxidants used by phagocytes to kill invading microorganisms or tumor cells (11Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A low activity NADPH oxidase is present in a variety of nonphagocytic cells, wherein this enzyme is a source of second messengers. It has been postulated, for instance, that the O2.¯ generated by the aorta functions as a blood pressure regulator by consuming nitric oxide, a well known hypotensive agent with which it reacts at a diffusion-limited rate, and NADPH oxidases have been suggested to serve as components of oxygen sensors in various tissues (11Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The large spectrum of physiopathological situations potentially involving the activation of NADPH oxidase accounts for the wide use of its inhibitors, in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. Although the effects of DPI and DIP are often accepted as evidence of NADPH oxidase inhibition, these compounds are nonspecific flavin binders. Moreover, experimental evidence suggests that the action of DPI and other iodonium-containing compounds is not restricted to flavoenzymes only. Indeed, DPI caused reversible blockade of K+ and Ca2+ currents in isolated type I carotid body cells (12Wyatt C.N. Weir E.K. Peers C. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 172: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and in pulmonary smooth muscle cells (13Weir E.K. Wyatt C.N. Reeve H.L. Huang J. Archer S.L. Peers C. J. Appl. Physiol. 1994; 76: 2611-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), indicating that DPI is a nonselective ion channel blocker. Both DPI and DIP have been found to be antagonists of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, through inhibition of opening processes of the ion channel (14Shuto M. Ogita K. Yoneda Y. Neurochem. Int. 1997; 31: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar); by this way, DIP protects neurons against glutamate toxicity (15Nakamura Y. Tsuji K. Shuto M. Ogita K. Yoneda Y. Shimamoto K. Shibata T. Kataoka K. Neuroscience. 1997; 76: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The above mentioned effects do not apparently involve the inhibition of flavoenzymes, such as NADPH oxidase or nitric-oxide synthase. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is a metabolic route operating in all tissues. Its first, oxidative phase converts glucose 6-phosphate into ribulose 5-phosphate and CO2, leading to the synthesis of NADPH, a redox cofactor for many antioxidant enzymes. The metabolic flux through the PPP is a sensitive index of the cell exposure to oxidant molecules since glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), which catalyzes the first step of the pathway, is activated by any oxidative stress, via a decrease of the NADPH/NADP+ ratio (16Luzzatto L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 146: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 17Eggleston L.V. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1974; 138: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). As the G6PD reaction is the rate-limiting step, the measurement of glucose flux through the PPP allows us to monitor the real levels of G6PD activity in whole cells (18Spolarics Z. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 534-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Starting from the observation in our laboratory that DPI inhibited the PPP in N11 glial cells, this work has been aimed to investigate the mechanism by which DPI exerts such a metabolic effect and to investigate whether this effect is associated with the occurrence of an oxidative stress. Cells and Reagents—The N11 mouse glial cell line was a gift from Dr. Marco Righi (CNR Institute of Neuroscience, Section of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, Milan, Italy). Cells were cultured up to the confluence in 100-(PPP and lipid peroxidation measurements) or 35-mm (other experiments) diameter Petri dishes with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and then incubated for 1–6 h in the absence or presence of DPI and other reagents, before or during the assays, as described in the following paragraphs. The protein content of cell monolayers or suspensions was assessed with the BCA kit from Pierce. When not differently indicated, reagents were from Sigma. Measurement of Glucose Flux through PPP and Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle—Cells were washed with fresh medium, detached with trypsin/EDTA (0.05/0.02% v/v), washed with PBS, and resuspended at 2 × 105 cells in 1 ml of Hepes buffer (in mm: 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgSO4, 10 Hepes sodium salt, 10 glucose, 1 CaCl2, pH 7.4, at 37 °C) containing 2 μCi of [1-14C]glucose or [6-14C]glucose (58 and 55 mCi/mmol, respectively; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cell suspensions were incubated in the absence or presence of DPI, menadione, and/or H2O2 at the concentrations and for the time periods indicated under “Results,” using a closed experimental system to trap the 14CO2 developed from [14C]glucose, as detailed previously (19Pescarmona G.P. Bosia A. Arese P. Sartori M.L. Ghigo D. Int. J. Biochem. 1982; 14: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 20Riganti C. Aldieri E. Bergandi L. Fenoglio I. Costamagna C. Fubini B. Bosia A. Ghigo D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 938-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). 14CO2 is released when [1-14C]glucose is metabolized either by the PPP or by the tricarboxylic acid cycle, whereas it is developed from [6-14C]glucose only via the tricarboxylic acid cycle (21Rieger D. Loskutoff N.M. Betteridge K.J. Reprod. Fertil. Dev. 1992; 4: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The amount of glucose transformed into CO2 through the PPP or tricarboxylic acid cycle was calculated as described (20Riganti C. Aldieri E. Bergandi L. Fenoglio I. Costamagna C. Fubini B. Bosia A. Ghigo D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 938-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21Rieger D. Loskutoff N.M. Betteridge K.J. Reprod. Fertil. Dev. 1992; 4: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and expressed as nmol CO2/h/mg of cell proteins. Measurement of GSH and GSSG—After having incubated the cells under the experimental conditions described under “Results,” intracellular and extracellular GSH and GSSG were measured spectrophotometrically as described (22Vandeputte C. Guizon I. Genestie-Denis I. Vannier B. Lorenzon G. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1994; 10: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and expressed as pmol/mg of cellular proteins. Measurement of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Production—After a 3-h incubation under the experimental conditions indicated under “Results,” cells were washed with fresh medium, detached with trypsin/EDTA, washed with PBS, and then checked for ROS generation by two different methods. (a) To quantify the ROS generation by luminol-amplified chemiluminescence (23Schwarzer E. Turrini F. Ulliers D. Giribaldi G. Ginsburg H. Arese P. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), cells were resuspended at 0.15 mg of cell proteins/ml into a luminometer cuvette containing Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer, supplemented with 5 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 μm luminol (total volume: 1 ml). The basal luminescence was recorded (Magic Lite Analyzer; Ciba Corning Diagnostic Corp.) for 30 min and expressed as cps/mg of cell proteins. To verify the contribution of superoxide to the luminol-dependent chemiluminescence, aliquots of cells were incubated with 300 units/ml superoxide dismutase (from bovine erythrocyte) during the 3 h of incubation and the subsequent 30 min during which luminescence was recorded. (b) To measure the H2O2 production, cells were resuspended in a quartz cuvette at 0.15 mg of cell proteins/ml in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (145 mm NaCl, 5.7 mm NaH2PO4, 0.54 mm CaCl2, 1.22 mm MgSO4, pH 7.35) containing 10 μmN-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (A12222; Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) (24Mohanty J.G. Jaffe J.S. Schulman E.S. Raible D.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) and 0.2 units/ml horseradish peroxidase type II (EC 1.11.1.7). The samples were warmed at 37 °C for 60 min, and cellular fluorescence was measured using a LS-5 spectrofluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Excitation and emission wavelengths were 590 and 645 nm, respectively. A standard curve was prepared with different amounts of H2O2, and results were expressed as pmol of H2O2/mg of cell proteins. Measurement of Lipid Peroxidation—Cells incubated under the experimental conditions described under “Results” were washed with fresh medium, detached with trypsin/EDTA, and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. Lipid peroxidation was detected measuring the intracellular level of malonyldialdehyde (MDA), the end product derived from the breakdown of polyunsaturated fatty acids and related esters (25Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar), with the lipid peroxidation assay kit (Oxford Biomedical Research, Oxford, MI), which uses the reaction of N-methyl-2-phenylindole with MDA in the presence of hydrochloric acid to yield a stable chromophore with maximal absorbance at 586 nm (26Gerard-Monnier D. Erdelmeier I. Regnard K. Moze-Henry N. Yadan J.C. Chaudiere J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 1176-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) Leakage—To check the cytotoxic effect of the different experimental conditions described under “Results,” LDH activity was measured on aliquots of culture supernatant at the end of the incubation time, as described previously (20Riganti C. Aldieri E. Bergandi L. Fenoglio I. Costamagna C. Fubini B. Bosia A. Ghigo D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 938-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Measurement of G6PD and 6PGD Activity—Cells were washed with fresh medium, detached with trypsin/EDTA, washed with PBS, resuspended at 0.1 × 106 cells/ml in 0.1 m Tris, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and sonicated on ice with two 10-s bursts. This cell lysate was supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2 and 0.25 mm NADP+, and each measurement was performed on 1 ml of this reaction mix. The reaction was started at 37 °C by adding 6-phosphogluconate (0.6 mm) with or without glucose 6-phosphate (0.6 mm) and measured in a Lambda 3 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as the increase of absorbance/min at 340 nm (27Beutler E. Red Cell Metabolism: A Manual of Biochemical Methods, Grune & Stratton, New York and London1975Google Scholar). The most commonly used assays for G6PD activity measure the rate of reduction of NADP+ to NADPH when a cell lysate is incubated with glucose 6-phosphate. However, the product of G6PD activity, 6-phosphogluconate, is largely oxidized further in the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) reaction so that more than 1 (nearly 2) mole of NADP+ is reduced per each mole of glucose 6-phosphate oxidized. The assay results can be corrected for the 6PGD-mediated oxidation as follows. A first measurement is performed by adding to the assay system a saturating amount of both 6-phosphogluconate and glucose 6-phosphate; the rate of NADP+ reduction is the result of both G6PD and 6PGD activities. A second assay is performed with 6-phosphogluconate only as a substrate; this procedure allows us to measure 6PGD activity alone. G6PD activity is obtained by subtracting the rate of the second assay from the rate of the first one (27Beutler E. Red Cell Metabolism: A Manual of Biochemical Methods, Grune & Stratton, New York and London1975Google Scholar). Each reaction kinetics was linear throughout the 20 min of observation. Enzymatic activity was expressed as pmol of NADP+ reduced/min/mg of cell proteins. Measurement of GAPDH and LDH Activity—Cells were washed with fresh medium, detached with trypsin/EDTA, washed with PBS, resuspended at 0.1 × 106 cells/ml in 82.3 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.6, and sonicated on ice with two 10-s bursts. Aliquots of cell lysate were supplemented with a reaction mixture for the measurement of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or LDH, as described previously (27Beutler E. Red Cell Metabolism: A Manual of Biochemical Methods, Grune & Stratton, New York and London1975Google Scholar). Enzymatic activities, measured spectrophotometrically as absorbance variation at 340 nm (37 °C), were expressed as μmol of NADH oxidized/min/mg of cell proteins. Statistical Analysis—All data in text and figures are provided as means ± S.E. The results were analyzed by a one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. A 3-h incubation of N11 cells with DPI caused a dose-dependent inhibition of both the PPP and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Fig. 1). The DPI-induced inhibition was also time-dependent. After an incubation with 100 μm DPI for 1, 3, and 6 h, the PPP was decreased, respectively, to 40.1 ± 3.86%, 20.42 ± 1.52%, and 10.06 ± 0.75% of control (n = 6, p < 0.001 at each point). The tricarboxylic acid cycle was 54.6 ± 2.62%, 22.96 ± 2.12%, and 4.38 ± 0.71% of control after the same incubation times (n = 6, p < 0.001 at each point). The oxidizing agents menadione and H2O2 doubled the rate of the PPP (Fig. 2). Also, these increases were significantly inhibited by the coincubation with 1 μm DPI. The G6PD inhibitor dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) markedly inhibited the PPP, both in resting conditions and after activation with H2O2 (Fig. 2). The tricarboxylic acid cycle was not significantly modified by menadione, H2O2, and DHEA (data not shown). The impairment of the PPP by DPI could result in a lowered content of GSH. Indeed, after a 3-h incubation, DPI dose-dependently induced in N11 cells a decrease of GSH, an increase of GSSG, and an increased efflux of both molecules (Fig. 3).Fig. 2Effect of DPI on PPP activity in N11 cells, during a 3-h incubation in the absence (ctrl) or presence of 100 μm menadione (men), 10 μm H2O2, 1 μm DPI, and 100 μm DHEA.

The G6PD inhibitor DHEA was able to induce in N11 cells a production of ROS superimposable to that obtained after incubation with DPI (Fig. 4). The increase of chemiluminescence induced by DPI was mainly dependent on superoxide production as it was markedly inhibited by the presence of the superoxide scavenger superoxide dismutase (Fig. 4). On the other hand, DPI did not evoke any increase of luminescence or fluorescence when added to the cell suspension immediately before the measurement (data not shown). A 3-h incubation with DPI also caused a dose-dependent increase of intracellular MDA and an increased leakage of LDH activity in the extracellular medium (Fig. 5). Incubating N11 cells with 1 mm GSH for 4 h, intracellular GSH doubled, increasing from 10.65 ± 0.64 (n = 6) to 23.54 ± 0.8 pmol/mg of cell proteins (n = 6; p < 0.001). A 3-h incubation of GSH-loaded cells with 100 μm DPI did not significantly increase the MDA level and LDH release (Fig. 5) and did not significantly decrease the high intracellular GSH level (22.03 ± 0.9 pmol/mg of cell proteins, n = 6). The protective role of GSH loading against the lipoperoxidative and cytotoxic effects of an oxidative stress in N11 cells was confirmed by using H2O2 as a positive control in the place of DPI (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Effect of DPI on the production of MDA and on the extracellular release of LDH in N11 cells. Cells were incubated for 1 h in the absence or presence of 1 mm GSH and then incubated for 3 h further in the absence (ctrl) or presence of 1, 10, or 100 μm DPI or 10 μm H2O2. After this time period, cells were checked for their MDA content, whereas LDH activity was measured on 100 μl of the supernatant, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are presented as means ± S.E.

A similar effect was observed when whole cells were incubated for 3 h in the absence or presence of DPI and then lysed and checked for the above mentioned enzyme activities (data not shown). When we measured the activity of the purified enzymes (G6PD, LDH, and GAPDH) in a cell-free system, the presence of DPI in the reaction mixture caused a dose-dependent inhibition of each enzyme as well (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Effect of DPI on the activity of purified G6PD, LDH, and GAPDH. The reaction mixtures (see “Experimental Procedures”) were checked for the above mentioned enzyme activities, in the absence (ctrl) or presence of 1, 10, or 100 μm DPI, added immediately before performing the measurement. Data are presented as means ± S.E. (n = 3) versus respective control (ctrl): *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since LDH catalyzes a reversible reaction and can use both NAD(H) and NADP(H) as redox cofactor, we investigated whether the DPI-induced inhibition could be influenced by the type of cofactor and by its redox state. At the lowest concentration, DPI appeared to inhibit more efficiently the LDH reaction in the presence of NADP+ or NADPH, but at higher concentrations, DPI exerted a similar inhibition of the enzyme activity in each reaction mixture (Fig. 8). In most experimental works of the past years, DPI and DIP have been used as inhibitors of NADPH oxidase. The Ki for inhibition of NADPH oxidase by DPI or DIP has been reported to vary, depending on the biological system investigated and the incubation time. The half-maximal inhibition of the enzyme has been obtained at DPI concentrations ranging from 0.1 μm in phorbol ester-stimulated human monocytes (28Li Y. Trush M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) to 5.6 μm in human neutrophils (9O'Donnell B.V. Tew D.G. Jones O.T. England P.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The Ki for DIP does not differ significantly from that of DPI (30Brandes R.P. Barton M. Philippens K.M. Schweitzer G. Mugge A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 500: 331-342Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To achieve a complete inhibition of NADPH oxidase, a concentration range of 1–100 μm DPI or DIP has been used in most past experimental works. Our data suggest that within this range, DPI and DIP may alter the redox metabolism in addition to the effect on NADPH oxidase. When N11 cells were incubated with 1–100 μm DPI, a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of both the PPP and the tricarboxylic acid cycle was observed. The flux of glucose through the PPP was higher than that through the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This may be due to the high proliferative rate of N11 cells as cell division needs huge amounts of NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate for nucleotide synthesis. The inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid cycle could be accounted for by the inhibitory effect of DPI on the cell respiration (2Gatley S.J. Sherratt S.A. Biochem. J. 1976; 158: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 3Ragan C.I. Bloxham D.P. Biochem. J. 1977; 163: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The inhibition of the PPP by DPI or DIP has been already observed in several cell types, such as hepatic endothelial cells (31Spolarics Z. Spitzer J.J. Hepatology. 1993; 17: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and Kupffer cells (32Spolarics Z. Bautista A.P. Spitzer J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) in rats treated with endotoxin in vivo and rat peritoneal macrophages stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (33Naftalin R.J. Rist R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1148: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This phenomenon has usually been thought to be the consequence of the reduced production of O2.¯ by NADPH oxidase. To check whether this mechanism was operating in N11 cells, we measured the PPP activity in cells stimulated with menadione (which exerts an oxidative stress by generating ROS through its redox cycling and by forming a conjugate with glutathione) (34Wefers H. Sies H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 224: 568-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) or with H2O2; in both conditions, the ROS synthesis was independent of NADPH oxidase activity. The coincubation with DPI significantly inhibited both basal and oxidative stress-stimulated PPP, ruling out that DPI inhibits the PPP activity by blocking NADPH oxidase and suggesting that such inhibition is exerted at a different level, more likely at the G6PD step. Indeed, DHEA, a potent uncompetitive inhibitor of G6PD (35Marks P.A. Banks J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1960; 46: 447-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Gordon G. Mackow M.C. Levy H.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), significantly inhibited the PPP and abolished its activation by H2O2, confirming that also in N11 cells, G6PD is the rate-limiting step in the PPP and that the PPP measurement is a useful tool to monitor the actual G6PD activity in whole cells (18Spolarics Z. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 534-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). GSH is the most important antioxidant agent in the cells, where it is present at mm concentrations. In the presence of oxidant agents, GSH is oxidized in the place of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids; its regeneration is obtained thanks to glutathione reductase, which uses the NADPH produced in the PPP as a reducing cofactor. A decrease of the PPP potential may impair the ability of the cell to oppose oxidative stress. As oxidant molecules are also produced relentlessly in physiological conditions, as a consequence of cell metabolic activity, the inhibition of the PPP by DPI may account for the dose-dependent decrease of GSH, increase of GSSG, and efflux of both molecules induced by DPI in N11 cells. Interestingly, it has recently been reported that DPI decreases intracellular GSH in T24 bladder carcinoma cells, and this effect has been suggested to account for the ability of DPI to sensitize T24 cells to Fas-mediated cell death (37Pullar J.M. Hampton M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19402-19407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); the decrease of GSH content was attributed to an augmented efflux of glutathione as the GSH/GSSG ratio did not change. Differently, we have observed that DPI, besides promoting the efflux of GSH, also elicits an increased oxidation of GSH into GSSG, leading to a change of GSH/GSSG ratio. This difference may be attributable to the different cell types investigated; T24 cells could be more efficient than N11 cells in extruding GSH before it is oxidized. Anyway, it is interesting that the effect of DPI on the intracellular level of GSH in the two cell types appears to be very similar. The inhibition of the PPP and the decrease of intracellular GSH are likely to favor the onset of a more oxidizing intracellular environment. If so, we could expect that cells incubated with DPI exhibit signs of increased oxidative stress and of cytotoxicity. Indeed, when N11 cells were incubated with DPI, a significant production of ROS was detected. The marked decrease of ROS generation observed with the chemiluminescence experiments in the presence of superoxide dismutase suggests that DPI induces the formation of the superoxide anion, which subsequently dismutates to hydrogen peroxide. Indeed, H2O2 production was augmented by the incubation with DPI. When DPI was added to the cells immediately before the measurement, no increase of ROS generation was observed; this suggests that the induction of ROS generation by DPI needs the time necessary for the PPP flux and GSH level to decrease significantly, thus leading to a progressive inability of the cell to counteract the ROS coming from cell metabolism. The G6PD inhibitor DHEA induced a ROS generation similar to that observed with DPI under the same experimental conditions, confirming that the inhibition of G6PD is sufficient per se to elicit an oxidative stress. DPI also increased the level of intracellular MDA, a lipid peroxidation marker, and the leakage of LDH activity in the extracellular medium, a sensitive index of the loss of cell membrane integrity. The preventive role played by GSH against DPI-elicited lipoperoxidation and cytotoxic effect was demonstrated by loading N11 cells with GSH. In GSH-loaded cells, the incubation with the highest concentration of DPI did not significantly increase the MDA level and LDH release; the cell loading with GSH also exerted a protective effect against the direct oxidative stress exerted by H2O2. The absence of DPI effects was in agreement with the inability of this compound to decrease significantly the intracellular GSH in GSH-loaded cells. This suggests that the effect of DPI on the intracellular level of GSH is not direct, but rather mediated by the blockade of the PPP, and that the inhibition of the PPP is harmful for the cells by depleting GSH. When the cells were provided with exogenous GSH, the inhibition of the PPP did not exert toxic effects. To clarify the mechanism by which DPI inhibits the metabolic activity in N11 cells, we measured the activity of some NADP- and NAD-dependent oxidoreductases in the lysate of N11 cells incubated with different concentrations of DPI; G6PD, LDH, and GAPDH were significantly inhibited by DPI. The same inhibitory effect was observed on the activity of purified G6PD, LDH, and GAPDH. These results suggest that DPI inhibits the PPP by blocking the activity of its regulatory enzyme, G6PD. Furthermore, NAD-dependent enzymes such as LDH and GAPDH are also inhibited. The subsequent blockade of glycolysis could, at least partly, account for the inhibition of glucose flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, in addition to the already described impairment of the cell respiratory activity (2Gatley S.J. Sherratt S.A. Biochem. J. 1976; 158: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 3Ragan C.I. Bloxham D.P. Biochem. J. 1977; 163: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The inhibition of LDH was observed in the presence of both NAD(H) and NADP(H). The above mentioned consequences of DPI incubation could be reproduced in N11 cells with DIP as well (data not shown), confirming that these two compounds share a common metabolic effect. Furthermore, we could reproduce the DPI-elicited inhibition of the PPP, production of MDA and ROS, and release of LDH in other cell types, i.e. murine alveolar macrophages MH-S, human monocyte-like U937 cells, and human erythrocytes (data not shown), thus confirming that these DPI effects are not restricted to N11 cells. Taken as a whole, our data suggest that DPI inhibits the cell metabolic activity not only by blocking the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase and other flavoenzymes but also by impairing the activity of NAD(P)-dependent enzymes. The concentration of DPI necessary to achieve the half-maximal inhibition of G6PD, LDH, and GAPDH appears to be around 10 μm, a concentration 2–10-fold higher than the Ki reported for NADPH oxidase but within the concentration range usually utilized in previous reports. A consequence of this effect is the inhibition of one of the main antioxidant pathways of the cells, i.e. the PPP, leading to the onset of an oxidative stress. This interference with redox metabolism poses serious caveats to the interpretation of results from experiments performed with DPI and its derivative DIP, in particular those aimed to investigate the role of NADPH oxidase in any in vivo and in vitro experimental system. Indeed, some effects of DPI are attributed to the reduced production of ROS via NADPH oxidase. When this enzyme is activated by several stimuli, such as bacterial endotoxin or phorbol esters, DPI has been found to be effective in inhibiting the NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS generation (11Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results provide a new mechanism by which DPI could inhibit the respiratory burst, i.e. by decreasing the availability of NADPH as a consequence of the PPP inhibition. On the other hand, by this mechanism, DPI is capable of decreasing intracellular GSH and increasing lipoperoxidation. This is not the only work suggesting that DPI elicits an oxidative stress. Recently, it has been observed that DPI can cause apoptosis in rat heart cultured cells via induction of mitochondrial superoxide production (38Li N. Ragheb K. Lawler G. Sturgis J. Rajwa B. Melendez J.A. Robinson J.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and induces in rat pulmonary aortic endothelial cells the transcription of heme oxygenase-1, a gene very sensitive not only to hypoxia but also to oxidative stress (39Ryter S.W. Xi S. Hartsfield C.L. Choi A.M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in porcine aortic endothelial cells DPI potentiated the generation of ROS, both basally and after stimulation with vascular endothelial growth factor (29Colavitti R. Pani G. Bedogni B. Anzevino R. Borrello S. Waltenberger J. Galeotti T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3101-3108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Our results could then provide an explanation to such observations, reporting a “paradoxical” induction of oxidative stress by DPI. It is likely that, in conditions wherein NADPH oxidase is not maximally activated, the prevailing effect of DPI is to stimulate, rather than to inhibit, ROS generation. For this reason, we think that other inhibitors than DPI and DIP should be used in experimental systems aimed to block the activity of NADPH oxidase and other flavoenzymes."

Current means of control for influenza are based on prophylaxis by vaccines and on treatment by the available specific influenza neuraminidase inhibitor drugs. The approach taken in the present study is to prevent and/or ameliorate influenza infection by site-specific blocking of the viral binding to host cell receptors.

It was constructed by screening a DNA library and processing by the selective evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) procedure. We show that this DNA aptamer is indeed capable of inhibiting the hemagglutinin capacity of the virus, as well as in the prevention of viral infectivity in vitro, in tissue culture. Furthermore, it inhibits viral infection by different influenza strains in an animal model, as manifested by 90-99% reduction of virus burden in the lungs of treated mice.

Influenza infections remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in the elderly population, and carry the risk of pandemics; they also impose a considerable economic burden worldwide. Present means of prevention and therapy are not entirely satisfactory, as the current vaccines do not provide a complete solution because of their limited efficacy and the frequent genetic variations of the virus, and anti-viral drugs are only marginally effective (1Demicheli V. Jefferson T. Rivetti D. Deeks J. Vaccine. 2000; 18: 957-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 2Couch R.B. N. Engl. J.

The more recently developed specific anti-influenza drugs consisting of neuraminidase inhibitors, comprising analogues of N-acetylneuraminic acid (e.g. oseltamivir and zanamivir), provide a limited beneficial effect, reducing the duration of infection by 1 day, from 7 to 6 days (2Couch R.B.

BMJ. 2003; 326: 1235-1241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The influenza virus envelope carries two major immunogenic surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (HA) 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; SELEX, selective evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HAU, hemagglutination units; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; SELEX, selective evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HAU, hemagglutination units; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. and neuraminidase. The HA plays a key role in initiating viral infection by binding to sialic acid-containing receptors on host cells and thus mediating the subsequent viral entry and membrane fusion (5Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 531-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar, 6Skehel J.J. Cross K. Steinhauer D. Wiley D.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 7Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). It exists in the viral membrane as homotrimeric spikes, each monomer containing a globular domain with a conserved sialic acid-binding pocket surrounded by antigenically variable antibody-binding sites (8Wilson I.A. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1981; 289: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar). The receptor-binding site within the HA is probably not exposed to the immune system because of the conformational restriction of the trimeric form of HA in native conditions. Nonetheless, as we recently demonstrated (9Jeon S.H. Arnon R. Viral Immunol. 2002; 15: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the recombinant globular region HA-(91-261) is capable of inducing both humoral and cellular immune responses against the intact virus, leading to a partial protection of the immunized mice against infection. This region includes one of the major conserved antigenic epitopes (HA-(91-108)) of all H3 strains (10Muller G.M. Shapira M. Arnon R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 11Arnon R. Horwitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), as well as the region of HA1 (HA-(116-261)) encompassing the receptor-binding pocket (8Wilson I.A. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1981; 289: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar). Because infection by the influenza virus is initiated by the binding of the virus to host cell receptors, the approach taken in the present study was to try and prevent infection by the blocking of this binding. Using the above mentioned conserved region of the HA molecule as a template, we designed a novel molecule aptamer, which would bind directly to the virus HA receptor-binding region and eventually prevent its interaction with the host cells.An aptamer is a DNA or RNA oligonucleotide that has been selected in vitro for specific binding to a target molecule. The process through which these molecules are isolated is called selective evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) (12Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (7823) Google Scholar). It starts with a pool of DNA oligonucleotides containing a region of randomized nucleotides (usually 30-100 nucleotides) flanked by conserved sequences that contain primer-binding sites for use in the PCR (polymerase chain reaction). An iterative process involving the binding of the DNA oligonucleotides to a target molecule, isolation of the tightest binders, followed by their PCR amplification is used to isolate those molecules that conform best to the selection criteria (13Klug S.J. Famulok M. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; 20: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In the past few years, aptamers have been evolved to bind proteins that are associated with a number of disease states (14Pan W. Craven R.C. Qiu Q. Wilson C.B. Wills J.W. Golovine S. Wang J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11509-11513Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Morris K.N. Jensen K.B. Julin C.M. Weil M. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 2002; 12: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), thus yielding powerful antagonists of such proteins. In the present study, using this SELEX procedure, an aptamer was selected for its binding to the globular region of influenza HA, HA-(91-261). We demonstrated that this aptamer was capable of blocking the binding of the virus to host cells and consequently preventing viral infection both in vitro and in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSELEX—Preparation and selection of the aptamer were performed by a modification of the method used by Morris et al. (15Morris K.N. Jensen K.B. Julin C.M. Weil M. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2902-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The aptamer library containing a central, randomized sequence of 30 nucleotides flanked by common primers 5′-AAT TAACCCTCACTAAAGGG-(N)30-TATGGTCGAATAAGTTAA-3′ was synthesized in a 380B DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems). The ssDNA aptamer library was denatured at 80 °C for 10 min and then cooled on ice for 10 min. For the selection process, 30 nmol of this product were mixed with 25 μg of the recombinant His-tagged HA-(91-261) peptide (9Jeon S.H. Arnon R. Viral Immunol. 2002; 15: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) in 500 μl of selection buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 μg tRNA, 0.2% bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C for 30 min. The bound aptamer·HA-(91-261) complex was purified by adding 25 μl of Ni-NTA superflow (Qiagen). After washing three times with 1 ml of selection buffer, the complex was resuspended in 40 μl of 10 mm Tris buffer and amplified by PCR using the above 5′ primer (denoted T3 primer) 5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG-3′ and the 3′ primer 5′-TTAACTTATTCGACCATA-3′ under the conditions of 70 pmol/primer, 2 μl of 10 mm deoxy-NTP, in a final volume 50 μl at 46 °C, for 30 cycles. After three repeats of this SELEX procedure, amplified nucleotides were cloned by inserting the PCR product into pGEM-T vector and transformed into Escherichia coli.Oligonucleotides—The three oligonucleotides used in this study, synthesized in the 380B DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) had the following sequences: A22, 5′AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGCTGAGTCTCAAAACCGCAATACACTGGTTGTATGGTCGAATAAGTTAA-3′; A21, 5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGCGCTTATTTGTTCAGGTTGGGTCTTCCTATTATGGTCGAATAAGTTAA-3′; and NP-(147-158), 5′-ACTTATCAGCGGACCCGTGCCTTTAGTTCGTACTGGTGAT-3′.Mice—BALB/c mice at the age of 10-12 weeks old were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Rehovot, Israel). In each experiment 5-10 mice were employed/group, and 2-3 repetitive experiments were conducted.Viruses—Influenza strains A/Port Chalmers/1/73 (H3N2), A/Texas/1/77 (H3N2), A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), and A/Japan/57 (H2N2) were grown in the allantoic cavity of 11-day-old embryonated hen eggs (Bar On Hatchery, Hod Hasharon, Israel). Virus growth and purification were performed according to standard methods as described by Barret and Inglis (30Barret T. Inglis S.C. Mahy W.J. Growth Purification and Titration Influenza Viruses in Virology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1985: 119-151Google Scholar). The titer of virus used for infection was evaluated by the infection of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (31Levi R. Beear-Tzahar T. Arnon R. J. Virol. Methods. 1995; 52: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and hence, virus titer was expressed as the tissue culture infective doses leading to 50% infected cells (TCID50).Cells—MDCK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum (Biological Industries). Chicken blood for red blood cell preparation was obtained from the Faculty of Agriculture, Hebrew University (Rehovot, Israel).Hemagglutination Assay—Chicken red blood cells were suspended in Alsever solution, and the concentration was brought to 0.5% in PBS. Assay was performed in micro-titer plates with 50 μl of sample containing the influenza virus and 50 μl of 0.5% chicken red blood cells. Wells were inspected for agglutination, and the results were evaluated as hemagglutination units (HAU). For hemagglutination inhibition assay, a serial dilution of either the aptamer or lung homogenate extracts were added to the virus prior to the addition of chicken red blood cells.Immunization of Mice with HA-(91-261) Peptide—The recombinant fragment HA-(91-261) was prepared as described previously (9Jeon S.H. Arnon R. Viral Immunol. 2002; 15: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA encoding the globular region of HA protein (91-261 amino acid residues) was expressed in E. coli and purified in Ni-NTA column (Qiagen, Beer-Sheva, Israel) using their N-terminal histidine tag. For the intranasal immunization, each mouse was administered with a droplet of 50 μl of recombinant peptide solution containing 1 μg/μl HA-(91-261) in PBS. The mice were boosted twice at 3-week intervals, using the same amount of antigen used for the initial immunization. The mice were bled 1 week after the last immunization.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—High binding capacity ELISA plates (Immunoplate, Nunc, Denmark) were coated with 100 μl of purified virus containing 100 HAU/ml of various influenza viral strains diluted in PBS by incubating at 4 °C overnight. After several washings, the wells were blocked with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 100 μl of serial-diluted serum samples were added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After washing five times with PBS-T (PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20), the bound antibodies were detected by peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG conjugates (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). Reaction was revealed by incubating with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine (Sigma) solution for 30 min at room temperature. After stopping the reaction with 50 μl of 2 m H2SO4, the plates were read with a multichannel ELISA reader (Titertek, Multiskan MCC/340 MK II; Helsinki, Finland) at 450 nm.Reverse Screening of Aptamer—Biotinylated ssDNA of each plasmid from individual clones was synthesized using the B-T3 20-mer, which has the same sequence as the 5′ primer (T3 primer) in the aptamer. The biotinylated 5′ primer, B-T3 20-mer, was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The solid phase ELISA plate was prepared by coating with 100 μl/well of 100 μg/ml streptavidin diluted in 0.1 m NaHCO3 and incubated overnight at 37 °C. After washing four times with PBS, the wells were blocked with 200 μl of PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin by incubating at room temperature for 2 h followed by washing three times with PBS-T. After washing, 100 μl of 2.5 pmol/100 μl of the individual biotinylated ssDNA (expectant oligonucleotides) and, as negative control, B-T3 primer were added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h followed by washing four times with PBS-T. After this step, 100 μl/well of 10 HAU/well virus or 2 μg/well histidine-labeled HA-(91-261) peptide were added and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After washing the wells four times with PBS-T, anti-His antibody or anti-virus serum were added to the corresponding wells. Reverse screening assay was completed by following the procedures of ELISA after this step.Viability of MDCK Cells (MTT Assay)—MDCK cells were laid on 96-well plates (7 × 104/well) 1 day before the experiments, as such or infected with influenza virus, in the presence or absence of aptamer. They were incubated in maintaining medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum) at 37 °C for 72 h. The viability assay was performed according to Levi et al. (31Levi R. Beear-Tzahar T. Arnon R. J. Virol. Methods. 1995; 52: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) by adding 4 mg/ml MTT (Sigma) dissolved in PBS to the cell cultures and incubating at 37 °C for 3 h. The plates were then centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were aspirated, and the formazan dye was dissolved in 150 μl/well isopropyl alcohol (Merck). The optical density values were quantitated using an ELISA reader at 540 nm.Immunostaining—For immunostaining, 5 × 105 MDCK cells were laid on glass coverslips. After 24 h, influenza virus (Port Chalmers/1/73, H3N2) was added with or without 1 h of preincubation with A22. After 48 h, the cells were permeabilized with 3% paraformaldehyde containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and subsequently, the cultures were fixed with freshly prepared 3% paraformaldehyde. Influenza surface antigen HA was detected by incubating the cultures with a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for influenza HA (diluted 1:100) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). All antibody incubations were carried out for 1 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber, followed by three washes in PBS. Primary antibodies were detected with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) secondary antibodies. Nuclei were visualized by staining with 2 μg/ml DAPI (Sigma). Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope. Photographs were taken using the Spot software program. Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA).Infection of Mice with Influenza Virus—The mice were inoculated intranasally with a sublethal dose of infectious allantoic fluid containing 2.5 × 103 TCID50. Preliminary experiments for the evaluation of this viral dose on BALB/c mice revealed that it is equivalent to 0.3 lethal doses 50 (LD50). The mice were sacrificed 6 days after the inoculation (the peak of virus titer), and the lungs were removed and homogenized in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (10% w/v). After homogenization, the samples were centrifuged to remove debris and stored at -70 °C. In the day of the assay, after thawing the lung homogenates (a process which releases the virus from the cells), they were injected (100 μl of 10-fold serial dilution) into the allantoic cavity of 9-11-day-old embryonated eggs. Following incubation for 48 h at 37 °C and overnight at 4 °C, allantoic fluid was removed, and virus presence was determined by hemagglutination assay as described above. The results of these assays were presented as log egg infection doses 50% (30Barret T. Inglis S.C. Mahy W.J. Growth Purification and Titration Influenza Viruses in Virology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1985: 119-151Google Scholar).Histology—For histological analysis of lungs, mice were sacrificed 6 days after infection, and pieces of the lungs were put into 10% neutral buffered formalin (pH 7.0), sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. All slides were analyzed and evaluated by a uninformed observer.Statistical Analysis—The p values were calculated by Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered significant according to the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 10.0 software program.RESULTSCross Reactivity of HA-(91-261) Fragment with Different Viral Strains—The globular region of HA has been chosen for the aptamer selection, because it encompasses the conserved receptor-binding site, which is not exposed in the intact HA molecule or in its trimeric spikes on the virus. Hence, antibodies induced by this globular region are expected to react with different strains that share this structure. To induce such antibodies, we have cloned the peptide comprising the HA-(91-261) region that includes the binding zone to the oligosaccharide receptor of target cells. We have shown previously (9Jeon S.H. Arnon R. Viral Immunol. 2002; 15: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) that this protein fragment (denoted HA-(91-261) peptide) induced significant levels of IgG antibodies that recognized and neutralized the intact influenza virus A/Texas/1/77 (H3N2). As shown in Fig. 1, A-D, these anti-HA-(91-261) antibodies react with different influenza viral strains, including H1N1 (A/PR/8/34) and H2N2 (A/Japan/57), at a comparable level to their reactivity with the H3N2 (A/Texas/1/77 and A/Port Chalmers/1/73) viruses. This is in contrast to the strain-specific immune response induced by the intact A/Texas/1/77 virus (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that the HA-(91-261) globular region of the HA molecule may lead to broad spectrum neutralizing activity.Selection and Construction of the Aptamer—Using this HA-(91-261) peptide, we attempted to design novel molecules that can bind directly to the virus HA and eventually prevent the interaction of the virus with the host cells. To this end, recourse was taken to the development of aptamers, namely oligonucleotides derived from an in vitro evolution process called SELEX, in which the peptide is used as a template. According to the described procedure (12Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (7823) Google Scholar), a nucleotide library was synthesized containing a random segment of 30 nucleotides flanked by 5′ and 3′ common primers as conserved linkers to amplify the selection process. This random library was hybridized with the HA-(91-261) peptide in a selection buffer and purified by Ni-NTA resin. After purification, the ssDNAs were amplified by PCR using the linker sequences. The SELEX process was repeated three times followed by the cloning of the final PCR product and transformation into E. coli. For the screening of oligonucleotides, biotinylated ssDNA from individual clones were screened by reverse ELISA for their binding to the HA-(91-261) fragment and the intact influenza virus, respectively. The two oligonucleotides with the highest binding activity were selected from the library and denoted “A21” and “A22,” respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, in their binding levels to the HA-(91-261) fragment, they were similar and showed highly significant differences from the control ssDNA (p = 0.042 and p = 0.0008, respectively). On the other hand, there was a significant difference between A21 and A22 in binding to the intact virus, where A22 showed higher binding than A21 (p = 0.017), and both showed significant binding compared with the control (Fig. 2B). The two oligonucleotides A21 and A22 were isolated and sequenced. Their sequences and the proposed secondary structures, as determined by using the DNA draw program (18Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10091) Google Scholar), are illustrated in Fig. 2, C and D. The secondary structure of an additional oligonucleotide, NP-(147-158), which served as a negative control in the in vivo experiments, is shown in Fig. 2E. The aptamers were then synthesized and evaluated as described in the following.Fig. 2Properties of aptamers.

The aptamer A22, which evinced the higher binding capacity to the virus, indeed demonstrated hemagglutination inhibition. Thus, at a 12.5-pmol concentration, it inhibited completely the hemagglutination by 4 HAU of the A/Texas/1/77 (H3N2) virus, and at a concentration of 20 pmol, it inhibited the hemagglutination by 10 HAU of influenza A/Japan/57 (H2N2) and 15 HAU of A/Port Chalmers/1/73 (H3N2), respectively. The capacity of A22 to inhibit viral infectivity was then investigated in vitro by measuring the viability of MDCK cells exposed to influenza virus (A/Port Chalmers/1/73, H3N2). Fig. 3A demonstrates the effect of A22 in preventing cell death and illustrates its dose-dependent nature. As shown, exposure of the MDCK cells to 5 × 102 TCID50 of the virus led to almost total cell death. The cell viability increased as a function of the concentration of the A22 added to the cell culture and reached its peak between 50 and 100 pmol of A22 (r = 0.972, p = 0.028). The slight decline in effectivity at the highest concentration is possibly because of some detrimental effect to the uninfected cells caused by high concentration of A22. Accordingly, a concentration of 50 pmol was selected to determine the effect of A22 on the infection of MDCK cells by another strain of influenza, A/Japan/57 (H2N2), in comparison to the inhibition of infection by the A/Port Chalmers/1/73 (H3N2) strain. The results (Fig. 3B) demonstrate that A22 had a comparable inhibitory effect on the MDCK death caused by the two viral strains. It led to a reduction of 80% in the cell mortality caused by A/Port Chalmers and 70% reduction of mortality caused by the A/Japan, two influenza strains that differ in their HA. Interestingly, as also shown in Fig. 3B, the less reactive aptamer A21 was also capable of reducing the in vitro infectivity of the viruses, although less effectively than A22. The inhibition of viral infectivity of the MDCK is specific, because a nonrelevant DNA (coding for the region NP-(147-158) of influenza nucleoprotein) did not lead to any change in cell mortality caused by the viral infection.Fig. 3The effect of A22 on the viability of MDCK cells infected by 5 × 102 TCID50 of influenza virus in tissue culture. The viability was measured by the MTT method in the presence ofincreasingconcentrationsofA22.A,dose-dependent inhibition of cell death caused by infection with the Port Chalmers strain of influenza. The highest protective effect was achieved by A22 at the concentration range of 50-100 pmol. B, comparison of the protective effect of A22 (50 pmol), A21 (50 pmol), and control DNA (NP-(147-158)) (50 pmol) in the prevention of MDCK cell death infected with two strains of influenza, Port Chalmers (H3N2) and Japan/57 (H2N2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The effect of A22 in preventing viral binding and entry to cells was demonstrated also by microscopic analysis. As seen in the upper part of Fig. 4, using light microscopy, the whole structure of the MDCK cells was damaged by the viral infection (Fig. 4A). In comparison, in the presence of A22, destruction was inhibited, and the cell structure was largely conserved (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the mere treatment with A22 did not affect the structure of the cells (Fig. 4C), indicating that the damage was caused only by the viral infection. These findings are corroborated in the fluorescence microscopy images in the lower part of Fig. 4. Here the presence of the virus was detected with Cy3-labeled specific anti-HA monoclonal antibodies. As shown, although viral presence is clearly manifested in the infected cells (Fig. 4D), it is almost entirely prevented by the addition of A22 (Fig. 4E). Untreated cells appeared identical to the cells treated with A22 (Fig. 4F).Fig. 4Microscopic analysis of the effect of A22 on influenza infection of cells.Upper panels, light microscope views of MDCK cells after infection with 5 × 102 TCID50 influenza virus (A) and after pre-treatment with 50 pmol A22, with (B) or without (C) infection. Lower panels, immunofluorescence images of MDCK cells after 2 days of incubation with influenza virus (D), with influenza virus and A22 (E), or treatment with A22 alone (F). The cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in paraformaldehyde containing 0.5% Triton X-100. The cells were immunostained for the presence of virus using mouse anti-HA antibodies and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Cy3 as a secondary antibody. Nuclei were visualized by staining with DAPI. HA and nuclei are shown in red and blue, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Mode of Action of A22 Evidence for Aptamer-Virus Interaction—To eliminate the possibility that the prevention of infection is due to binding of the aptamer to the target cells rather than to the virus, a pre-incubation experiment was performed. Before infection with 2.5 × 102 TCID50 of A/Port Chalmers/1/73 (H3N2) virus, the MDCK cells were incubated with 50 pmol of A22 for 30 or 60 min followed by repeated washing (twice) to remove unbound aptamer. Assessment of their viability (Fig. 5A) revealed no significant difference between the survival level of the nontreated and the A22-treated cells, nor any difference between the two times of exposure of the cells to A22. In all cases, cell survival is very low, because infection is not hindered. These results indicate that the effect of A22 in preventing the cell infection and mortality, as demonstrated in Fig. 3, is not by direct blocking of the sialic acid-containing receptors on host cells.Fig. 5Mode of action of the aptamer"
https://openalex.org/W1997659862,"The activity and structural integrity of the tumor suppressor protein p53 is of crucial importance for the prevention of cancer. p53 is a conformational flexible and labile protein, in which structured and unstructured regions function in a synergistic manner. The molecular chaperone Hsp90 is known to bind to mutant and wild type p53 in vivo. Using highly purified proteins we analyzed the interaction and the binding sites between both proteins in detail. Our results demonstrate that Hsp90 binds to a folded, native-like conformation of p53 in vitro with micromolar affinity. Specifically, the DNA-binding domain of p53 and the middle and carboxy-terminal domains of Hsp90 are responsible for this interaction, which is essential to stabilize p53 at physiological temperatures and to prevent it from irreversible thermal inactivation. Our results are in agreement with a model in which Hsp90 is required to maintain the folded, active state of p53 by a reversible interaction, thus introducing an additional level of regulation.

The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcription factor involved in cell cycle regulation and the initiation of apoptotic cell death (1Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B.

Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5850) Google Scholar). It can interact with and inactivate the protein from the wild type allele (7Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S.

Cell. 1991; 65: 765-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Wild type p53 is a labile protein with a high turnover rate; it is degraded rapidly via proteolysis and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (9Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar). Due to this high turnover only low concentrations of p53 reside usually in the cell. However, mutated p53 is not as strongly affected by proteolysis or ubiquitination and therefore accumulates in the cell (10Soussi T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 910: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). p53 consists of 393 residues that can be divided in four major functional domains (see Fig. 1A) (11Bargonetti J. Manfredi J.J.

As a transcription factor, p53 possesses an amino-terminal region (NTD, 1The abbreviations used are: NTD, amino-terminal domain of p53; DBD, DNA-binding domain of p53; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; FITC, fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate; hHsp90, human Hsp90; NiMB, nickel-chelating magnetic beads; RD, regulatory domain of p53; yHsp90, yeast Hsp90; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. residues 1–93) (14Fields S. Jang S.K. Science. 1990; 249: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), which contains a transcription activation domain and a proline-rich domain. Highly specific DNA binding is mediated by the core domain (DBD, residues 102–292) (15Kern S.E. Kinzler K.W. Bruskin A. Jarosz D. Friedman P. Prives C. Vogelstein B. Science. 1991; 252: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 16Klein C. Planker E. Diercks T. Kessler H. Kunkele K.P. Lang K. Hansen S. Schwaiger M. J. Biol.

Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). The high affinity binding of p53 to this sequence requires the tetrameric state of p53 (17el Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). The tetramerization domain (18Sturzbecher H.W. Brain R. Addison C. Rudge K. Remm M. Grimaldi M. Keenan E. Jenkins J.R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1513-1523PubMed Google Scholar), which is followed by a flexible regulatory domain (RD), is located within the carboxy-terminal domain (residues 320–393). Stress-mediated modifications in the regulatory domain, e.g. phosphorylation or binding of other proteins, transform p53 from the common inactive form to the activated form, which is able to induce the expression of target proteins or to mediate apoptosis (19Ahn J. Prives C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CD spectroscopy revealed that p53 contains large unstructured regions in its native state (12Bell S. Klein C. Muller L. Hansen S. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Further analysis using NMR spectroscopy in combination with p53 fragments showed that the NTD is natively unfolded (20Dawson R. Muller L. Dehner A. Klein C. Kessler H. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 1131-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thus, in p53 only the DBD and the tetramerization domain are highly structured (21Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar, 22Clore G.M. Ernst J. Clubb R. Omichinski J.G. Kennedy W.M. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This classifies p53 as a member of the growing class of proteins, in which structured and unstructured regions function in a synergistic manner (20Dawson R. Muller L. Dehner A. Klein C. Kessler H. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 1131-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). For p53 this allows the interaction with a multitude of regulators (2Hofseth L.J. Hussain S.P. Harris C.C.

It has been shown that mutated p53 interacts specifically with the molecular chaperone Hsp90 in vivo (25Blagosklonny M.V. Toretsky J. Bohen S. Neckers L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8379-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 26Whitesell L. Sutphin P.D. Pulcini E.J. Martinez J.D. Cook P.H. Mol. Cell.

Hsp90 is essential in eukaryotes (28Borkovich K.A. Farrelly F.W. Finkelstein D.B. Taulien J. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3919-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), and it is one of the most abundant proteins in unstressed cells (29Welch W.J. Feramisco J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14949-14959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lai B.T. Chin N.W. Stanek A.E. Keh W. Lanks K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2802-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). It exhibits high homology between higher and lower eukaryotes: e.g. yeast Hsp90 (yHsp90) is 60% identical to human Hsp90 (31Rebbe N.F. Ware J. Bertina R.M. Modrich P. Stafford D.W. Gene. 1987; 53: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the function of Hsp90 as a chaperone for a large number of client proteins, ranging from transcription factors to kinases, seems to be conserved between yeast and humans (32Wegele H. Muller L. Buchner J. Rev. Physiol Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 151: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The chaperone is an elongated dimer, which can be divided into three major domains (see Fig. 1B) (33Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 34Chadli A. Bouhouche I. Sullivan W. Stensgard B. McMahon N. Catelli M.G. Toft D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Biol. 1999; 285: 903-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain of Hsp90 contains the ATP binding pocket (35Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). This pocket also binds the Hsp90 drugs geldanamycin and radicicol (37Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A.

Pearl L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar), which block ATP binding and therefore inhibit the ATPase activity. Derivatives of these inhibitors show antitumor activity in various preclinical models (39Neckers L. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: S55-S61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The ATP-binding domain is connected to the remainder of the protein via a highly charged and protease-sensitive linker domain (Fig. 1B, CR) (40Louvion J.F. Warth R. Picard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13937-13942Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The function of the adjacent middle domain of Hsp90 is not completely understood. It has been reported that this domain is involved in the ATPase activity of Hsp90 (41Meyer P. Prodromou C. Hu B. Vaughan C. Roe S.M. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Mol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 39303-39310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The dimerization site is located in the carboxy-terminal region of the protein (34Chadli A. Bouhouche I. Sullivan W. Stensgard B. McMahon N. Catelli M.G. Toft D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12524-12529Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Additionally, the carboxy-terminal amino acids provide the binding site for partner proteins containing TPR domains (tetratricopeptide repeat). These TPR domains are a common feature of many Hsp90 cochaperones such as Hop (32Wegele H. Muller L. Buchner J. Rev. Physiol Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 151: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 43Owens-Grillo J.K. Czar M.J. Hutchison K.A. Hoffmann K. Perdew G.H. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

As mentioned above, Hsp90 binds tightly to mutated p53 (25Blagosklonny M.V. Toretsky J. Bohen S. Neckers L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 40583-40590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). NMR experiments suggest that the completely denatured DBD of p53 binds to Hsp90 (49Rudiger S. Freund S.M. Veprintsev D.B. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11085-11090Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Hsp90 also binds to wild type p53 (46King F.W. Wawrzynow A. Hohfeld J. Zylicz M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6297-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The binding to the wild type protein seems to be more transient compared with mutant proteins. There is also in vivo evidence that heat shock influences binding to Hsp90 (27Wang C. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2066-2071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this study we analyzed the interaction of p53 and Hsp90 in detail. We show that Hsp90 is vital for the stability and the DNA-binding ability of wild type p53 at physiological and heat shock temperatures. Protein Expression and Purification—Wild type p53 (residues 1–393), p53-core (residues 94–312), p53-C312 (residues 1–312), N93-p53 (residues 93–393), and p53-C93 (residues 1–93) were expressed and purified as described elsewhere (12Bell S. Klein C. Muller L. Hansen S. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 20Dawson R. Muller L. Dehner A. Klein C. Kessler H. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 1131-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The DNA sequences for amino acids 313–393 and 1–363 of human p53 were amplified from plasmid p11435 (12Bell S. Klein C. Muller L. Hansen S. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into the multiple cloning site of a pQE30 expression vector driven by the isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible T5 phage-promotor (Qiagen). The resulting plasmids, pTC and pDC, code for the last 81 or first 363 amino acids of the human p53 protein, respectively. An amino-terminal His6 tag was added to facilitate purification. The correct sequences of the inserts were verified by DNA sequencing. N313-p53 and p53-C363 were expressed as soluble protein in Escherichia coli HB101, transfected with the plasmid pTC or pDC, respectively, and the helper plasmid pUBS520 (50Brinkmann U. Mattes R.E. Buckel P. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 85: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown in Luria broth medium at 37 °C up to an optical density of 0.8 at 600 nm. After induction for 4 h with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 300 mm sodium chloride, complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science), and disrupted by high pressure dispersion. After lysis, the supernatant containing soluble p53-C363 was loaded onto a nickel-coated HiTrap Chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences). Bound p53-C363 was eluted with a linear imidazole gradient. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and purified to homogeneity by Heparin HiTrap HP affinity chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) and size exclusion chromatography on a High Load 16/60 Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. N313-p53 was loaded onto a nickel-coated HiTrap Chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a linear imidazole gradient. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and purified to homogeneity by size exclusion chromatography on a High Load 16/60 Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences). The purity of both proteins, p53-C363 and N313-p53, was >98% as determined by densitometry of Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels. Human Hsp90 (hHsp90) was purified as described from baculovirus-infected insect cells (51Buchner J. Bose S. Mayr C. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and dialyzed into 50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.5. Yeast Hsp90 (yHsp90) and fragments were purified from E. coli as described previously (42Wegele H. Muschler P. Bunck M. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39303-39310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Human Hsp70 was expressed in a DnaK– variant of the E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus (DE3) and purified as described elsewhere (52Schumacher R.J. Hansen W.J. Freeman B.C. Alnemri E. Litwack G. Toft D.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14889-14898Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Analytical Gel Filtration—Analytical gel filtration analysis was performed at 20 °C with a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min using a TSK2000SW (TosoHaas, Amsterdam, Netherlands) or a BioSep SEC-3000 (Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany) column attached to a high performance liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with sample buffer consisting of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 300 mm sodium chloride, 2 mm EDTA. Purified proteins with a concentration of ∼2.5 μm were injected in a total volume of 20 μl. Elution of proteins was monitored by fluorescence emission at 320 nm (excitation, 280 nm). FITC Labeling of Hsp90 —FITC (fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate) labeling of Hsp90 was performed using the FluoReporter® FITC Protein Labeling kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). 40 μl of a 1 m sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9, and 9 μl of a 10 mg/ml stock solution of reactive FITC dye in Me2SO were added to 400 μlofa24 μm solution of hHsp90. The reaction was protected from light and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Removal of free FITC dye was achieved by loading the reaction mixture on spin columns (provided with the kit) and centrifuging for 5 min at 1100 × g. The yield was a 17 μm solution of FITC-labeled hHsp90. The yHsp90 fragments were labeled accordingly. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—DNA binding activity was analyzed by EMSA as described with minor modifications (12Bell S. Klein C. Muller L. Hansen S. Buchner J. J. Mol.

The activating and supershifting antibody PAb421 (Oncogene, San Diego, CA) was added to a final concentration of 100 ng per reaction (25 μl). Protein concentrations were 50 ng of p53 and 500 ng of hHsp90, yHsp90 fragments, p53-core, N313-p53, Hsp70, Hdj1, GroEL/GroES, or Hsp27 per reaction. Samples were separated on 4% native polyacrylamide gels and quantified with a Typhoon 9200 Fluorescence Imager (Amersham Biosciences). Circular Dichroism—Far-UV CD spectra were recorded in a J-715 spectropolarimeter with a PTC343 Peltier unit (Jasco, Groβumstadt, Germany) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.5. The elipticity was recorded in 0.1-cm quartz cuvettes at 222 nm for 1 min to minimize signal noise. Thermal denaturation was followed via the change in elipticity at 222 nm from 10 °C to 90 °C with a rate of 20 °C/h. The spectra were corrected for buffer contributions. Cross-link—Cross-linking of Hsp90 and full-length p53 was achieved under native conditions by addition of the heterobifunctional zero-length cross-linker EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) (Pierce). In the respective experiments, p53 (1.5 μm) and EDC (5 mm) were incubated for 1 h at 22 °C in the presence or absence of hHsp90 (3 μm) in EDC reaction buffer (0.1 m MES, pH 5). The reaction was stopped by adding 10 mm ammonium acetate. Samples were separated on a 4–12% polyacrylamide gradient gel (Invitrogen) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitations were performed essentially as described (57Wegele H. Haslbeck M. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25970-25976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) with purified p53 and hHsp90 in a volume of 100 μl. The reactions were incubated at 20 °C for 1 h in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.5, in the presence of the antibody PAb421, PAb240, or PAB1620 (Oncogene). Immune complexes were recovered by binding to protein-A/G-Sepharose (Sigma). After three washes with 5 volumes of PBS buffer (4 mm potassium phosphate, 16 mm sodium phosphate, 120 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.4), the immunocomplexes were eluted with Laemmli SDS-loading buffer. For analysis, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Serva). Nickel-chelating Magnetic Beads Assay—For the qualitative analysis of the Hsp90-p53 interaction in solution, we used nickel-chelating magnetic beads (NiMB, Qiagen). 340 pmol of FITC-labeled hHsp90 and 150 pmol of His6-tagged p53 or p53 fragments were diluted at 4 °C in NiMB buffer containing 50 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, to yield a total volume of 180 μl. The mixture was preincubated for 30 min at 10 °C. Subsequently, 20 μl of nickel-chelating magnetic bead suspension was added, and the mixture was incubated for another 30 min at 10 °C. The beads were rinsed and vortexed three times with 500 μl of NiMB buffer. After resuspension in 100 μlof NiMB buffer they were analyzed with a Typhoon 9200 Fluorescence Imager (Amersham Biosciences, excitation 532 nm/emission 526 nm). The assay was carried out in the presence or absence of p53 and p53 fragments. Aggregation Assay—p53 aggregates spontaneously at elevated temperatures. p53 (1.5 μm) or p53-core (1.5 μm) was incubated at 45 °C in the presence and absence of 15 μm hHsp90 after preincubation at 4 °C for 1 h in reaction buffer (50 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5). Assays in the presence of bovine serum albumin served as a control for unspecific protein effects. To monitor the kinetics of thermal aggregation, light scattering was measured in a FluoroMax II (Spex, Edison) fluorescence spectrophotometer in thermostatted quartz cuvettes. During the measurements, both the excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 340 nm with a spectral bandwidth of 5 nm. ELISA Assay—For further analysis of the Hsp90-p53 binding we developed an ELISA-based protein interaction assay. 96-well high affinity ELISA plates (Greiner-BioOne, Kremsmuenster, Austria) were coated with 50 μl of a 5 μg/ml solution of antibody PAbDo1 (Oncogene) in PBS at 4 °C over night. PAbDo1 recognizes residues 21–25 of the NTD of p53 specifically. The wells were rinsed with PBS at 4 °C three times. Blocking was done with 5% (w/v) milk powder (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) in PBS at 4 °C for ∼4 h. Following the blocking step, the wells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). p53 (100 ng) or p53 fragments (100 ng), hHsp90 (200 ng), or yHsp90 fragments (100 ng) were diluted in 100 μl PBS, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.5% (w/v) milk powder in the respective experiments. Before adding to the wells, the reaction mixtures were preincubated for 10 min at 10 °C. After an incubation period of 90 min at 4 °C, the ELISA plates were repeatedly washed with PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20. The binding of FITC-labeled hHsp90 or yHsp90 fragments were visualized with a Typhoon 9200 Fluorescence Imager (Amersham Biosciences, excitation 532 nm/emission 526 nm). In an additional experiment 50 μl of p53-core (5 μm) or 50 μl of p53 (5 μm) was coated to the wells directly. Following the blocking step increasing concentrations (0.01–10 μm) of FITC-labeled hHsp90, yHsp90-N272, N527, or 529C in 100 μl of PBS, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.5% (w/v) milk powder were added to the wells. Washing and detection were performed as described above. To analyze the conformation of p53, p53 (5 μm) was immobilized on the wells. The conformation-specific antibodies PAb240 (Oncogene), specific for denatured p53 (58Gannon J.V. Greaves R. Iggo R. Lane D.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1595-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar), or PAb1620 (Oncogene), specific for natively folded wild type p53 (59Ball R.K. Siegl B. Quellhorst S. Brandner G. Braun D.G. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1485-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), were added after the blocking step. For detection a CY5-labeled anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was added. Fluorescence was detected with a Typhoon 9200 Fluorescence Imager (Amersham Biosciences). Data analysis for direct binding curves used the linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity (AU) and the amount of protein (c) bound to the chip. AUmax (Equation 1) is the maximum signal, at which all immobilized p53 or p53-core molecules are saturated with hHsp90 or yHsp90-N527. AU=AUmaxcc+KD Eq.1 Characterization of Wild Type p53, Hsp90, and Their Fragments—The tumor suppressor protein p53 consists of four functional domains (Fig. 1A). We constructed and purified six different p53 truncation fragments and the full-length protein to cover all domains of the human p53 protein in different combinations (Fig. 1A). The constructs correspond to the human wild type protein without mutations. The fragments p53-C363, p53-C312, N93-p53, and p53-core are able to bind specifically to the p21 DNA (data not shown). Size exclusion chromatography showed that wild type p53, p53-C363, N93-p53, and N313-p53 form tetramers, whereas the other fragments are in their monomeric state, due to the lacking tetramerization domain (data not shown). The correct secondary structure of all fragments was confirmed by CD spectroscopy (data not shown). In Fig. 1B human Hsp90 (hHsp90), yeast Hsp90 (yHsp90), and the fragments used in this study are depicted. The structures and stabilities of the proteins were analyzed by CD spectroscopy and urea-induced unfolding transitions (42Wegele H. Muschler P. Bunck M. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39303-39310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Temperature Dependence of the Stability and DNA-binding Activity of p53—Wild type p53 is a labile protein that is sensitive toward denaturation and aggregation. To analyze the correlation between the loss of secondary structure and the loss of DNA binding activity, we performed DNA binding assays (EMSAs) at increasing temperatures. The proteins were incubated for 15 min at the indicated temperature. Subsequently, the activating antibody PAb421 and p21 DNA were added at 4 °C (Fig. 2A). At incubation temperatures below 30 °C, identical results were obtained for the binding of p53 to p21 DNA. Above 30 °C, an irreversible loss of DNA binding activity was detectable, and the activity disappeared completely above 35 °C. At the physiological temperature of 37 °C, p53 was not able to bind to DNA any more. Activation of p53 by CKII-mediated phosphorylation of the RD gave similar results (data not shown). To analyze whether this loss in activity correlates with changes in the structure of p53, we monitored secondary structure by CD spectroscopy. These experiments showed that structural changes occur at temperatures above 25 °C, and a plateau was reached at 45 °C. The thermal unfolding of p53 is irreversible (data not shown). In Fig. 2B, the thermal denaturation of wild type p53, determined by CD spectroscopy, is compared with its DNA binding activity. These experiments showed that de"

We show that geldanamycin or radicicol, specific inhibitors of Hsp90, diminish specific wild-type p53 binding to the p21 promoter sequence. Consequently, these inhibitors decrease p21 mRNA levels, which lead to a reduction in cellular p21/Waf1 protein, known to induce cell cycle arrest. In control experiments, we show that neither geldanamycin nor radicicol affect p53 mRNA levels. A minor decrease in p53 protein level following the treatment of human fibroblasts with the inhibitors suggests the potential involvement of Hsp90 in the stabilization of wild-type p53. To support our in vivo findings, we used a reconstituted system with highly purified recombinant proteins to examine the effects of Hsp90 on wild-type p53 binding to the p21 promoter sequence. The human recombinant Hsp90 α-isoform as well as bovine brain Hsp90 were purified to homogeneity. Both of these molecular chaperones displayed ATPase activity and the ability to refold heat-inactivated luciferase in a geldanamycin- and radicicol-sensitive manner, suggesting that post-translational modifications are not involved in the modulation of Hsp90α activity. We show that the incubation of recombinant p53 at 37 °C decreases the level of its wild-type conformation and strongly inhibits the in vitro binding of p53 to the p21 promoter sequence. Interestingly, Hsp90 in an ATP-dependent manner can positively modulate p53 DNA binding after incubation at physiological temperature of 37 °C. Other recombinant human chaperones from Hsp70 and Hsp40 families were not able to efficiently substitute Hsp90 in this reaction. Consistent with our in vivo results, geldanamycin can suppress Hsp90 ability to regulate in vitro p53 DNA binding to the promoter sequence. In summary, the results presented in this article state that chaperone activity of Hsp90 is important for the transcriptional activity of genotypically wild-type p53.

In summary, the results presented in this article state that chaperone activity of Hsp90 is important for the transcriptional activity of genotypically wild-type p53. The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a transcription factor, which regulates cellular response to stress, abnormal cell proliferation, and DNA damage (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J.

More than 50% of human cancers possess the mutated p53 gene (3Hollstein M. Hergenhahn M. Yang Q. Bartsch H. Wang Z.Q. Hainaut P. Mutat.

Cell. 2003; 112: 29-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that p53 is transported in HEK cells to the nucleus along microtubular tracks by cytoplasmic dynein and the Hsp90 molecular chaperone (9Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. O'Hagen H.M.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2594-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Processes that inhibit p53 nuclear transport and proteolysis also lead to the inactivation of p53 protein (12Li M.

In the response to various stresses, such as ionizing radiation, UV and hypoxia, p53 is activated, stabilized, and imported into the nucleus, where it promotes transcription of several genes whose products induce cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis (14Balint E.E. Vousden K.H. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 85: 1813-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In a non-stress situation, the level of p53 in the cells is mainly regulated at the post-translational level by MDM2 (12Li M. Brooks C.L. Wu-Baer F. Chen D. Baer R. Gu W.

Additionally, Hsp90 regulates many signaling pathways. Hsp90 is found in a complex with several oncoproteins, including v-Src, c-Erb2, Raf-1, Akt, Bcr-Abl, and tumor suppressor p53 (18Young J.C. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 19Zylicz M. King F.W. Wawrzynow A.

The Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylaminogeldanamycin (17-AAG) is currently in phase II of clinical trials as a potential anti-tumor drug. Hsp90 inhibitors usually induce ubiquitination and degradation of Hsp90 client proteins (23Workman P. Cancer Lett. 2004; 206: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In tumor cells, Hsp90 exists in a functionally distinct conformational form that is much more efficiently recognized by 17-AAG. This form of Hsp90, which possesses elevated ATPase activity, is found in a multichaperone complex with cochaperones: p23, Hop, and probably others (24Kamal A. Thao L. Sensintaffar J. Zhang L. Boehm M.F. Fritz L.C. Burrows F.J. Nature. 2003; 425: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). It has been known for years that genotypically mutant p53 co-immunoprecipitates with members of the Hsp70 and Hsp90 families (19Zylicz M. King F.W. Wawrzynow A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4634-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Such interactions lead to the formation of a p53 multichaperone complex that is responsible for the stabilization and sequestration of p53 in the cytoplasm (25Sepehrnia B. Paz I.B. Dasgupta G.

Binding of molecular chaperones to mutant p53 inhibits the ability of MDM2 to promote p53 ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in the stabilization of both p53 and MDM2 (28Peng Y. Chen L. Li C. Lu W. Agrawal S. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6874-6878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Peng Y. Chen L. Li C. Lu W. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40583-40590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It also has been shown that Hsp90 directly associates with the MDM2 protein (30Burch L. Shimizu H. Smith A. Patterson C. Hupp T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Hsp90 inhibitors can partially disrupt these interactions, which results in the degradation of mutant p53 (31Whitesell L. Sutphin P. An W.G. Schulte T. Blagosklonny M.V. Neckers L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 32Whitesell L. Sutphin P.D. Pulcini E.J. Martinez J.D. Cook P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1517-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). With the use of highly purified proteins, we have identified intermediate reactions that lead to the assembly of molecular chaperone complex with p53 protein possessing wild-type or mutant sequence. The presence of Hsp90 in a complex with wt-p53 inhibits binding of Hsp40 and Hsc70 to p53. However, the conformational mutant of p53, which possesses low affinity toward Hsp90, can form a stable multichaperone complex in which Hsp90 is bound to mutant p53 indirectly (mut p53-Hsp40-Hsc70-Hop-Hsp90). Several independent methods, such as surface plasmon resonance, immunoprecipitation, ELISA, and cross-linking were used to demonstrate that Hsp90 directly, in the absence of any other co-chaperones, can associate with genotypically wt-p53 but not with mutant p53 protein (33King F.W. Wawrzynow A. Hohfeld J. Zylicz M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6297-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The accompanying article by Muller et al. (34Muller L. Schaupp A. Walerych D. Wegele H. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48846-48854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) supports our findings. Moreover, it has been shown by NMR that Hsp90 associates with a truncated version of wt-p53. It was suggested that the p53 core domain bound to Hsp90 is predominantly unfolded and lacking helical or sheet secondary structure (35Rudiger S. Freund S.M. Veprintsev D.B. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11085-11090Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Wild-type p53 is a structurally unstable protein, which undergoes conformational changes at elevated temperatures (36Bullock A.N. Henckel J. DeDecker B.S. Johnson C.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14338-14342Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 37Bell S. Klein C. Muller L. Hansen S. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We have proposed that during heat shock, cytoplasmic p53 possessing the wild-type sequence could temporarily adopt a mutant conformation, subsequently initiating the formation of a multichaperone complex that could partially stabilize wt-p53 (19Zylicz M. King F.W. Wawrzynow A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4634-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Results from a recently published article by Wang and Chen (38Wang C. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2066-2071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) support our hypothesis. They found that heat shock inhibited p53 ubiquitination and initiated the accumulation of p53 at the post-translational level. Two factors influence these events during heat stress: 1) ATM-dependent phosphorylation of p53 and 2) formation of the chaperone complex with genotypically wt-p53, which adopts a conformation characteristic to that of a mutant protein (38Wang C. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2066-2071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The evidence for Hsp90 binding to mutant p53 is conclusive, whereas the exact nature of cellular interactions between Hsp90 and genotypically wt-p53 possessing either wild-type or mutant conformation still remains to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that the chaperone activity of Hsp90 is required for wt-p53-dependent transcriptional activity. Specific Hsp90 inhibitors, geldanamycin and radicicol, inhibit p53 activity as the transcription factor by dissociation of p53 from its target DNA promoter sequence sites. Results from the reconstituted in vitro system clearly show that Hsp90 positively regulates p53 DNA binding to a specific promoter sequence after incubation at physiological temperature of 37 °C. Moreover, this Hsp90 activity is ATP-dependent and inhibited by geldanamycin. Cell Culture Experiments—K15, a line of human fibroblasts immortalized by stable expression of hTERT, was a kind gift from Prof. H. Kampinga. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, in Ham's F10 medium with 15% fetal bovine serum. For inhibition of topoisomerase I and activation of p53, 2 μm camptothecin (Sigma) were used. For inhibition of Hsp90, 3 μm geldanamycin (Sigma) or 3 μm radicicol (Sigma) were used. For Western blot, the cells were seeded at 50% confluence in Costar 6-well plates. At the indicated times, the cells were lysed directly on the plate in Laemmli sample buffer, and proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed using the following antibodies: p53, DO-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:6000; phospho-p53 (Ser-15), 9284 (Cell Signaling Technology), 1:1000; p21, sc-397 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:100; tubulin: Tub 2.1 (Sigma), 1:2000. Densitometry was performed using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Real-time RT-PCR—K15 cells were seeded in 60-mm plates, and total RNA was isolated using the Macherey-Nagel NucleoSpin kit. RNA was examined by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm equal amounts in all samples and lack of degradation. First-strand cDNA synthesis was done using the Fermentas RevertAid kit with oligo(dT) primers. Real-Time PCR was performed using LightCycler (Roche Applied Science) as follows: p53, RT-p53-U, ACCTACCAGGGCAGCTACGG, RT-p53-L, GCTGCACAGGGCAGGTCTTG, annealing temperature 55 °C, 1 mm MgCl2; p21, RT-p21-U, GGACCTGTCACTGTCTTGTA, RT-p21-L, GGCTTCCTCTTGGAGAAGAT, 53 °C, 1 mm MgCl2; GAPDH, RT-GAPDH-U, GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCA, RT-GAPDH-L, GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC, 51 °C, 2 mm MgCl2. Detection was performed using SYBR-Green. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assay was done as described in Ref. 39Willis A. Jung E.J. Wakefield T. Chen X. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2330-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar with minor modifications. Briefly, K15 cells were cultured in 100-mm plates. After the experimental treatment, the cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde and cross-linking was stopped by addition of glycine. The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and DNA was disrupted into pieces of 500–600 bp by sonication. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and protein A-Sepharose beads were added to the lysate together with 1 μl of anti-p53 antibody (DO-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed, cross-linking was reversed, and DNA was purified on silica gel columns (A&A Biotechnology). Real-time PCR was performed to detect the p21 promoter fragment using the following primers: p21-ChIP-U, GTGGCTCTGATTGGCTTTCTG, p21-ChIP-L, CTGAAAACAGGCAGCCCAAG, annealed at 55 °C with 1 mm MgCl2. Protein Purification—Human Hsp90α fused with MBP (plasmid pMALc2x-aHsp90, a kind gift from P. Csermely) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL 21 RIL DE3 strain at 37 °C for 3 h after induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Bacteria pellet was lysed in buffer A (40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme for 1 h at 4 °C with constant stirring, then the centrifugation proceeded for 1 h at 100,000 × g. Supernatant was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A and bound proteins eluted with linear gradient of 0–0.5 m KCl in buffer A. Fractions containing Hsp90 were salted out with 30% (NH4)2SO4 following centrifugation at 70,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a butyl-Sepharose column, which had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 30% (NH4)2SO4 and bound proteins were eluted with linear gradient from 30 to 0% (NH4)2SO4. Hsp90 α-MBP was applied onto amylose resin (NEB) and eluted with 10 mm maltose. MBP tag was cleaved with factor Xa protease (NEB) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Hsp90α protein of more than 95% purity was concentrated on a Resource Q FPLC column and dialyzed against buffer B: 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT. Bovine brain Hsp90 was purified as described (40Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Human recombinant Hsc70 (HSPA8), and Hdj1 were overexpressed and purified as described (33King F.W. Wawrzynow A. Hohfeld J. Zylicz M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6297-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Human recombinant Hsp70 (HSPA1A) was purified exactly as Hsc70, after overexpression in BL21 RIL E. coli strain from pET11b-Hsp70 construct, a kind gift from Prof. R. Morimoto. pMALc2x-hdj2 and pET30a-hdj3, constructs encoding human Hdj2 and Hdj3 were kind gift of Prof. K. Terada. Both proteins were purified from E. coli as previously described (41Terada K. Kanazawa M. Bukau B. Mori M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 42Terada K. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24728-24734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). All these chaperones tested positive for activity by the luciferase refolding assay (see below). p53 human recombinant protein was purified essentially as described (43Nichols N.M. Matthews K.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). ATPase Assay—ATPase activity was measured as previously described (44Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). 10 μm Hsp90 was incubated in 20 μl of buffer: 40 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/100 μl reaction buffer. Geldanamycin at a concentration of 500 μm was added where indicated, and the reaction was carried out at 37 °C. At time points 0–120 min, 1-μl samples were spotted on PEI-cellulose plates. Plates were resolved in 1 m LiCl: 1 m HCOOH, 1:1, dried and spots corresponding to non-hydrolyzed ATP and free phosphate were cut out, and radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Bioscience). All results were corrected to the spontaneous ATP hydrolysis. Luciferase Refolding Assay—Luciferase refolding assay was a modified version of the one described (45Minami Y. Minami M. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). 10 μm Hsp90 was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the buffer: 25 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 8 mm MgSO4, 1% BSA, 10% glycerol, 0.25% Triton X-100, containing 2 mm ATP or geldanamycin (concentration ranging from 0.0 to 100 μm). Luciferase (Promega, 12.66 mg/ml) was diluted 400 times in this mixture and incubated for 5 min at 50 °C. After cooling down the denatured luciferase mix was diluted 6-fold with a renaturation buffer: 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 8 mm CP, 0.02 u/μl CK, 2 mm ATP, 4 μm Hsc 70, 2.0 μm Hdj 1. Renaturation was carried out at room temperature. At time points 0-120 min, 5-μl aliquots were taken, and the activity of renatured luciferase was measured in a luminometer (BMG Labtechnologies) after addition of the Bright-Glo substrate (Promega). p53 DNA Binding Assay—The DNA binding activity of p53 was quantified by EMSA (gel-shift) assay. 50 ng of human recombinant p53 was diluted in the final volume of 5 μl of EMSA buffer: 50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT. Samples were supplemented optionally with up to 5 μg of Hsp90 (human recombinant α or from bovine brain), other chaperones (see Fig. 5C) or BSA and 0–20 mm ATP. Such 5-μl samples were then incubated at 4 or 37 °C for 1 h in a thermocycler. The activation step followed that included addition of 15 μl of mixture containing: 1× EMSA buffer, 0.2 Mdpm of 32P-labeled p21 sequence (below), 1 μg of nonspecific 44-bp dsDNA (sequence below, usage based on Ref. 46Anderson M.E. Woelker B. Reed M. Wang P. Tegtmeyer P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6255-6264Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and 100 ng of the antibody pAb421 (Ab-1; Oncogene). 20-μl samples with the specific p21 DNA were afterward incubated for 5–10 min at room temperature, loaded onto a 4% native polyacrylamide Tris borate gel and electrophoresed at 15 mA for 2 h at 4 °C. Gels were dried and exposed overnight to the Biomax MS-1 Kodak film (Sigma). For p53 activated by CKII, the activation mix was made, containing per every 4 μl of volume: 50 ng of p53, 7 units of CKII (Calbiochem), 0.3 units of creatine kinase, 150 mm of phosphocreatine (ATP regeneration system; Roche Applied Science), 1–5 mm of ATP and 1× EMSA buffer. CKII activation was done for 30 min at 25 °C, and then each 4 μl of CKII activation reaction were supplemented separately with Hsp90/BSA in 1× EMSA buffer up to 5 μl. Afterward, a 1-h incubation step either at 4 or 37 °C was performed, followed by addition of 15 μl of DNA mixture without the antibody. Electrophoresis was performed as described above. For testing the nonspecific p53 DNA binding activity, 0.2 Mdpm of nonspecific, radiolabeled 44-bp dsDNA (below) was used per sample instead of labeled p21 sequence in the activation step. The remaining part of the experiment was performed as described before for specific DNA but no additional unlabeled DNA, antibody, or CKII was used in this case. Best results with geldanamycin in the EMSA assay were obtained when prior to the addition of p53, Hsp90 was preincubated with 83–500 μm GA in the presence of 1× EMSA buffer for 30 min at room temperature. After the addition of p53 and ATP in 1× EMSA buffer, the final GA concentrations were 25–150 μm. Since the stock solution of GA contained 100% Me2SO, in GA titration experiments all samples were supplemented with the same amount of Me2SO as added with GA. Sequences used in EMSA: p21 promoter-derived sequences, 5′-TGGCCATCAGGAACATGTCCCAACATGTTGAGCTCTGGCA-3′ and 5′-TGCCAGAGCTCAACATGTTGGGACATGTTCCTGATGGCCA-3′; nonspecific 44-bp DNA, 5′-GCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGGCGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTGAGTTCCAAGGCCTCATTCGCCTCTCGGAACATCTCGAAGC-3′. Sequences were annealed to form double-stranded DNA in a thermocycler using the following program: 5 min 94 °C, 5 min. 50 °C, 4 °C. Presence of the dsDNA was tested with a 16% polyacrylamide Tris borate gel electrophoresis. Sequences used in the EMSA assay were labeled with the T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK; Fermentas) as described in the producer's manual. ELISA—Investigation of the p53 conformation was carried out using a two-site ELISA. First the wells were coated with wt-p53 conformation specific pAb1620 monoclonal antibody or DO-1 (both of mouse origin, Oncogene Science) at 50 ng per well in carbonate buffer pH 9.2 at 4 °C for 16 h. The wells were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 100 μl of blocking wash buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH pH 7.6, 5 mm DTT, 150 mm KCl, and 2 mg/ml BSA). This was followed by titration of increasing amounts of human recombinant p53, either kept at 4 °C or incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The p53 dilutions were done in ELISA reaction buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2 0.05% Triton X-100, 5 mm DTT, 150 mm KCl, 2 mg/ml BSA). Detection of p53 protein was carried out using the FL-393 antibody (rabbit origin, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h diluted in blocking wash buffer at room temperature. This was followed by addition of anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Analysis of bound antibodies was performed by colorimetric detection with the TMB peroxidase EIA substrate kit (Bio-Rad), followed by absorbance measurements with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad) at 450 nm. Inhibition of Hsp90 in Human Fibroblasts Decreases the Wild-type p53 Transcriptional Activity—To investigate the possible interaction of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone with wt-p53 in vivo, we used K15 human fibroblasts. K15 cells express genotypically wt-p53, which can be immunoprecipitated with wt-p53-specific pAb1620 antibody, but not with the mutant p53-specific pAb240 antibody (data not shown). This suggests that in K15 cells, p53 exists in a functional, wild-type conformation. The functionality of p53 in the K15 cells was further demonstrated by its ability to induce p21/Waf1 expression and cell cycle arrest upon camptothecin treatment or γ irradiation (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Treatment of K15 cells with 2 μm camptothecin (CPT), a drug which induces DNA damage by inhibition of topoisomerase I, results in a p53 up-regulation as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). When the camptothecin treatment was performed in the presence of specific Hsp90 inhibitors, geldanamycin or radicicol (3 μm), p53 was induced to somewhat lower levels, and the time course of the induction was slower (Fig. 1A and results not shown). Importantly, the relative amount of p53 phosphorylated at serine 15 was not affected by the Hsp90 inhibitors (Fig. 1A). This suggests that Hsp90 might act on p53 directly, rather than through ATR, DNA-PK, or ATM kinases, which are known to phosphorylate p53 at this position (47Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, 48Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Williams J.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cliby W.A. Shieh S.Y. Taya Y. Prives C. Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that the lower p53 levels were caused by a decrease of its transcription, we quantified p53 mRNA by real-time RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1B, treatment of cells with geldanamycin or radicicol did not significantly change the level of p53 transcripts, suggesting that those drugs down-regulate p53 at the protein level. By fluorescence microscopy and cellular fractionation we showed that geldanamycin or radicicol do not affect the nuclear localization of p53 (results not shown). These results indicate that Hsp90 might play a role in the stabilization of the wt-p53 protein. To test whether Hsp90 indeed can influence the transcriptional activity of p53, we analyzed the binding of p53 to the p21 promoter by ChIP. As shown in Fig. 1C, the"
https://openalex.org/W2147359941,"ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is a pivotal regulator of cholesterol efflux from cells to apolipoproteins, whereas sterol-responsive element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) is the key protein regulating cholesterol synthesis and uptake. We investigated the regulation of ABCA1 by SREBP2 in vascular endothelial cells (ECs). Our results showed that sterol depletion activated SREBP2 and increased its target, low density lipoprotein receptor mRNA, with a concurrent decrease in the ABCA1 mRNA. Transient transfection analysis revealed that sterol depletion decreased the ABCA1 promoter activity by 50%, but low density lipoprotein receptor promoter- and the sterol-responsive element-driven luciferase activities were increased. Overexpression of the N terminus of SREBP2 (SREBP2(N)), an active form of SREBP2, also inhibited the ABCA1 promoter activity. Functionally adenovirus-mediated SREBP2(N) expression increased cholesterol accumulation and decreased apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux. The conserved E-box motif was responsible for the SREBP2(N)-mediated inhibition since mutation of the E-box increased the basal activity of the ABCA1 promoter and abolished the inhibitory effect of SREBP2(N). Furthermore sterol depletion and SREBP2(N) overexpression induced the binding of SREBP2(N) to both consensus and ABCA1-specific E-box. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that serum starvation enhanced the association of SREBP2 and the ABCA1 promoter in ECs. To correlate this mechanism pathophysiologically, we found that oscillatory flow caused the activation of SREBP2 and therefore attenuated ABCA1 promoter activity in ECs. Thus, this SREBP-regulated mechanism may control the efflux of cholesterol, which is a newly defined function of SREBP2 in ECs in addition to its role in cholesterol uptake and biosynthesis.

Epidemiological studies have shown an inverse relationship between levels of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and risk of coronary artery disease. High density lipoprotein promotes reverse cholesterol transport by facilitating the transfer of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver for disposal (1Tall A.R. J. Clin.

The most studied transcriptional regulation of the ABCA1 gene is the binding of liver X receptor (LXR)/retinoic X receptor (RXR) heterodimers to an imperfect direct repeat spaced by four nucleotides (DR4) to up-regulates the gene (9Schwartz K. Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 794-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar).

A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar, 18Amemiya-Kudo M. Shimano H. Hasty A.H. Yahagi N. Yoshikawa T. Matsuzaka T. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Osuga J.

The vascular endothelium forms a barrier between the vessel wall and lipoproteins in the circulation. It plays an important role in maintaining vascular integrity. The disturbance or injury of endothelium can lead to cardiovascular impairments such as atherosclerosis. ABCA1 is expressed in vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and transcriptionally up-regulated by LDL and cholesterol, suggesting that ABCA1 in ECs plays an important role in cholesterol homeostasis in the vessel wall (19Liao H. Langmann T. Schmitz G. Zhu Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the regulation of ABCA1 and its role in lipid trafficking in ECs remain largely unknown. We previously reported that shear stress activated SREBPs and hence up-regulated their targeting genes in ECs (20Liu Y. Chen B.P. Lu M. Zhu Y. Stemerman M.B. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 21Lin T. Zeng L. Liu Y. DeFea K. Schwartz M.A. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 1296-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Given the important role of SREBP2 and ABCA1 in cholesterol homeostasis and the significance of cholesterol traffic in the vessel wall, we investigated the regulation of ABCA1 by SREBP2 in ECs. Our results showed that, by binding to the E-box, SREBP2 could inhibit ABCA1 transcription. Importantly oscillatory flow caused the activation of SREBP2 and inhibition of ABCA1 promoter activity in ECs. Thus, this SREBP-regulated mechanism controlling cholesterol efflux is a newly defined function of SREBP2 in the vascular wall. Reagents—Cholesterol was purchased from Avanti, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). [γ-32P]ATP, [α-32P]dCTP, and [3H]cholesterol were from MP Biomedicals (Irvine, CA). The DECApriming II DNA labeling kit was from Ambion (Austin, TX). All of the DNA-modifying enzymes and PCR enzymes were obtained from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). LXR agonist TO901317 was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Human apoA-I was from Biodesign International (Saco, ME). Anti-ABCA1 antibody was purchased from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO), and antibodies against SREBP2, upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF1), USF2, c-Myc, Max, HA tag, and α-tubulin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). LDL was isolated from non-frozen human plasma as described previously (19Liao H. Langmann T. Schmitz G. Zhu Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recombinant human fibroblast growth factor was a generous gift from Dr. J. A. Thompson at the University of Alabama. All other reagents, purchased from Invitrogen or Sigma, were all of tissue culture or molecular biology grade. Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated and maintained as described previously (22Zhu Y. Lin J.H. Liao H.L. Friedli O.J. Verna L. Marten N.W. Straus D.S. Stemerman M.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly HUVECs were maintained in medium 199 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor, and 90 μg/ml heparin (EC medium). In experiments involving serum-free treatment, human endothelial serum-free medium (basal growth medium, Invitrogen) supplemented with 5 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor (SFM), was used. Bovine aortic endothelial cells were cultured under standard culture conditions. All experiments were performed with HUVECs up to passage three, and all cells were cultured to confluence before treatment. Northern Blotting, Quantitative Real Time (RT)-PCR, and Western Blotting—Total RNA isolation and Northern blotting for hABCA1, LDL receptor (LDLR), and von Willebrand factor mRNA was carried out according to standard protocols. The cDNA probes for LDLR and hABCA1 were generated via RT-PCR, and the probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by DECApriming (Ambion). For quantitative RT-PCR, total RNA was converted into cDNA by using reverse transcriptase with oligo(dT) as the primer. The obtained cDNAs were then used as the templates for quantitative RT-PCR with the use of Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The relative amount of ABCA1 mRNAs was calculated using the comparative method with the β-actin mRNA as internal control. The nucleotide sequences of the primers were: hABCA1, 5′-GCTGCCTCCTCCACAA-AGAAAAC-3′ and 5′-GCTTTGCTGACCCGCTCCTGGATC-3′; β-actin, 5′-TGACCGGGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA-3′ and 5′-CTAGAA-GCATTTGCGGTGGACGATGGAGGG-3′. HUVECs were solubilized in a buffer containing detergent, and cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The Western blotting analysis was performed with antibodies against ABCA1, SREBP2, SREBP1, USF1, USF2, c-Myc, Max, HA, or α-tubulin. Plasmid Construction and Transient Transfection—Plasmid pABCA1(E-boxmut)-luc was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and pABCA1(–928)-luc construct (10Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar) as template. The mutagenic primer for E-box mutation was: 5′-G-GGCCCCGGCTCCACGgaCTTTCTGCTGAG-3′. The sequences underlined indicate the E-box motif, and the bases in small letters are the designated mutations. Mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. pCMV5-HA-SREBP2(N), the expression plasmid of the N terminus of human SREBP2, was generated as described previously (21Lin T. Zeng L. Liu Y. DeFea K. Schwartz M.A. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 1296-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For the promoter activation study, the reporter plasmids of the hABCA1 promoter, 4XSRE-luc, LDLR-luc, and SCAP-C (20Liu Y. Chen B.P. Lu M. Zhu Y. Stemerman M.B. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), were transiently transfected into HUVECs with the use of the Targefect F2 (Targeting Systems, San Diego, CA). pRSV-β-gal was co-transfected as a transfection control. Adenovirus Construction and Infection—Recombinant adenovirus encoding Ad-HA-SREBP2(N) was created, amplified, and titered as reported previously (23Zeng L. Lu M. Mori K. Luo S. Lee A.S. Zhu Y. Shyy J.Y. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). For adenovirus infection, the virus mixture with multiplicity of infection as indicated was added to confluent HUVECs in culture and incubated for 12 h. Ad-β-gal was used as an infection control. The infected cells were then incubated in fresh growth medium for 24 h followed by RNA or protein extraction. Assessment of Cholesterol Efflux—The cholesterol efflux was assessed as described previously (19Liao H. Langmann T. Schmitz G. Zhu Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with modification. Briefly HUVECs in 12-well plates were infected with Ad-HA-SREBP2(N) or control virus for 12 h. The cells were then treated with LXR agonist TO901317 (10 μm) in EC medium or SFM for 18 h and labeled with [3H]cholesterol (0.2 μCi/ml) for 6 h. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline-bovine serum albumin, the cells were incubated with fresh SFM with or without apoA-I (10 μg/ml) for 2 h. The aliquots of medium and cell lysates were assayed by liquid scintillation. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Confluent HUVECs were treated with EC medium or SFM for 6 h or infected with Ad-HA-SREBP2(N) for 24 h. The cells were then lysed, and nuclear extracts were prepared. Double strand oligonucleotides containing the divergent E-box sequence in the ABCA1 promoter (5′-GGGCCCCGGCTCCACG-AGCTTTCTGCTGAG-3′) or consensus E-box oligos (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (24Zhu Y. Liao H.L. Wang N. Yuan Y. Ma K.S. Verna L. Stemerman M.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2465-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To test the specificity of binding, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled ABCA1-E-box or irrelevant AP-1 and SP-1 probes were used for competition experiments. In supershift experiments, the nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-HA antibody for 3 h on ice before the addition of the labeled probes. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ChIP assays were performed as described previously (23Zeng L. Lu M. Mori K. Luo S. Lee A.S. Zhu Y. Shyy J.Y. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde and quenched prior to harvest and sonication. Goat anti-SREBP2 or normal goat IgG and single strand salmon sperm DNA saturated with Protein A-Sepharose 4B beads were added to sheared samples for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitates were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant of the control group was collected as an input control. The immunoprecipitates were eluted from Sepharose 4B beads, and proteinase K solution was added and incubated at 60 °C for 8 h. DNA was extracted, purified, and then used to amplify target sequences by PCR. The ABCA1 promoter containing the E-box element was amplified by use of primer set 5′-CTGCACCGAGC-GCAGAGGTTA-3′ and 5′-CAACTCCCTAGATGTGTCGTG-3′. Flow Experiments—The flow experiments were performed as described previously (25Chappell D.C. Varner S.E. Nerem R.M. Medford R.M. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In brief, ECs were seeded on glass until confluence. Cells were then subjected to a parallel plate flow channel to impose an oscillatory flow (mean shear stress, 0 dyne/cm2; amplitude of pulsatility, ±3 dyne/cm2; 1 Hz) or a steady laminar flow (12 dyne/cm2) for 12 h. The flow system was kept at 37 °C and ventilated with 95% humidified air with 5% CO2. Statistics—Quantitative data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance of the data was evaluated by analysis of variance or Student's t test. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. For nonquantitative data, results were representative from at least three independent experiments. The Reciprocal Response of ABCA1 and SREBP2 Transcripts to Serum Deprivation—To study the regulation of ABCA1 in ECs under serum-free condition, we cultured confluent HUVECs in SFM in the presence or absence of LDL for 24 h. Under this condition, HUVECs had normal morphology, and no cell death was detected. As shown in Fig. 1A, SFM greatly decreased ABCA1 mRNA in HUVECs, and the inclusion of LDL in SFM reversed such an inhibition. In control experiments, cells in EC medium containing 20% FBS were exposed to LDL or cholesterol. LDL and cholesterol increased the level of ABCA1 mRNA. The level of mRNA encoding LDLR, an SREBP2 target gene, was much lower in cells in FBS than those in SFM. Supplementing SFM with LDL inhibited the expression of LDLR mRNA. Consistent with the SFM-up-regulated LDLR, SREBP2 was activated as revealed by the increased SREBP2 cleavage at 6 h after exposure to SFM and the subsequent increase in both precursor and cleavage forms of SREBP2 (Fig. 1B). Furthermore results from transient transfection assays showed that SFM decreased the luciferase reporter driven by the ABCA1 promoter by 49 ± 6% compared with cells under 20% FBS (Fig. 1C). However, SFM increased the luciferase reporter driven by the LDLR promoter or SRE by 5–6 times. Thus, ABCA1 and SREBP2 transcripts in ECs responded reciprocally to SFM. SREBP2 Inhibits the Expression of ABCA1—To ascertain whether SREBP2 up-regulation inhibits the expression of ABCA1, we compared the level of ABCA1 protein in HUVECs infected with recombinant Ad-HA-SREBP2(N) encoding the N terminus of SREBP2 with those infected with Ad-β-gal. Western blotting analysis revealed that ABCA1 in HUVECs was decreased by SREBP2(N) overexpression. This inhibitory effect was similar to that by SFM (Fig. 2A). Because ABCA1 is a pivotal regulator of cholesterol efflux from cells to apolipoproteins such as apoA-I, we explored cholesterol efflux to apoA-I as a functional consequence of the SREBP2-suppressed ABCA1. Compared with the Ad-β-gal-infected controls, the infection of Ad-HA-SREBP2(N) increased the [3H]cholesterol uptake and/or accumulation by 20 ± 8% (Fig. 2B). Furthermore cholesterol efflux in the presence of apoA-I was significantly decreased in Ad-HA-SREBP2(N)-infected cells (Fig. 2C). As an LXR target gene, ABCA1 is up-regulated by TO901317, a selective LXR agonist (26Schultz J.R. Tu H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C. Li L. Schwendner S. Wang S. Thoolen M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Lustig K.D. Shan B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2831-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 27Repa J.J. Liang G. Ou J. Bashmakov Y. Lobaccaro J.M. Shimomura I. Shan B. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). Treating Ad-β-gal-infected HU-VECs with TO901317 promoted the apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux when the cholesterol accumulation was unchanged. SREBP2 Down-regulates the ABCA1 Transcription via E-box Motif—To study whether the inhibition of ABCA1 by serum starvation or SREBP2 is at the level of transcription and to determine the involved transcriptional element within the ABCA1 promoter, we performed transient transfection assays using ABCA1 promoter-driven reporter constructs. Fig. 3A shows that overexpression of SREBP2(N) by the co-transfected pCMV5-HA-SREBP2(N) decreased the activities of promoter constructs pABCA1(–928)-luc and pABCA1(–156)-luc by 50% compared with controls transfected with vector plasmid pCMV5. Further deletion of a segment between –156 and –116 containing the E-box site, a silencer of the ABCA1 promoter (28Langmann T. Porsch-Ozcurumez M. Heimerl S. Probst M. Moehle C. Taher M. Borsukova H.

Knapper C.L. Amar M.J. Remaley A. Brewer Jr., H.B. Santamarina-Fojo S. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), abolished the inhibitory effect of SREBP2(N). Indeed mutation of the E-box in pABCA1(–928 E-boxmut)-luc not only increased the basal activity but also reversed the inhibition of ABCA1 promoter by SREBP2(N). Furthermore we studied the effect of serum starvation on the ABCA1 promoter by incubating the various transfected HUVECs with SFM or 20% FBS. As shown in Fig. 3B, SFM and SREBP2(N) overexpression exhibited a similar pattern of regulation on ABCA1 promoter constructs. SREBP2(N) Binds to the E-box of the ABCA1 Promoter— Given the possibility that E-box is an SREBP-responsive element, which down-regulates the ABCA1 expression, we studied the binding of SRBEP2(N) to E-box by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. As shown in Fig. 4A, SREBP2(N) overexpression in ECs because of Ad-HA-SREBP2(N) infection increased the binding of nuclear extracts to the ABCA1-specific E-box compared with control cells infected with Ad-β-gal. The supershifted band that resulted from the inclusion of anti-HA antibody revealed the specific binding of SREBP2 to the ABCA1-E-box motif. Furthermore SFM treatment for 6 h increased the bindings of nuclear extracts to both consensus and ABCA1-specific E-box (Fig. 4B). Addition of LDL or cholesterol to SFM attenuated such a binding. We also performed ChIP assay to ascertain whether SREBP2(N) binds to the ABCA1 promoter in vivo. As shown in Fig. 4C, although SREBP2(N) associated with the ABCA1 promoter in cells in 20% FBS, SFM greatly enhanced the association. Thus, the inhibition of ABCA1 transcription by SREBP2(N) is most likely through the binding of SREBP2 to the E-box site in the ABCA1 promoter. Serum Starvation Does Not Increase Other E-box-related Transcription Factors—In addition to SREBPs, E-box element also binds to several other nuclear proteins, including c-Myc, Max, and c-Myc-related regulatory factors such as USF1 and USF2. To explore the possible regulation of these E-box-binding proteins, the induction of Myc, Max, USF1, and USF2 by SFM was detected in the nuclear extract. Western blotting showed that SFM increased SREBP1 and SREBP2. However, levels of nuclear c-Myc and USF2 were decreased, and those of Max and USF1 remained unchanged (Fig. 5). This result suggested that Myc, Max, or USFs were unlikely to be involved in the binding of the E-box of ABCA1 promoter, leading to the suppression of the ABCA1 in response to SFM. Flow Inhibits ABCA1 Promoter Activation in ECs—We previously reported that steady laminar flow caused a transient activation of the SREBP-regulated genes, whereas disturbed flow patterns caused a sustained activation of SREBPs and their targeting genes in ECs (20Liu Y. Chen B.P. Lu M. Zhu Y. Stemerman M.B. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To determine whether the oscillatory flow-activated SREBP2, like serum depletion, can down-regulate ABCA1, HUVECs were subjected to an oscillatory flow (0 ± 3 dyne/cm2), and the levels of ABCA1 mRNA were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 6A, oscillatory flow indeed decreased the level of ABCA1 mRNA compared with static controls or cells subjected to laminar flow. Furthermore ECs were transiently transfected with pABCA1(–156)-luc, and the transfected cells were then subjected to different patterns of flow for luciferase induction assays. As shown in Fig. 6B, oscillatory flow decreased the ABCA1 promoter activity compared with static controls or laminar flow. The oscillatory flow-decreased ABCA1 promoter activity was reversed if E-box site was mutated or by co-transfection with SCAP-C, which encodes a truncated C terminus of SCAP and has been shown to block SREBP translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi (Fig. 6C) (30DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Li W.P. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 1999; 99: 703-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). These data suggest that oscillatory flow down-regulates ABCA1 in ECs, which is mediated through the up-regulation of SREBP2. In the present study we reported that the binding of SREBP2(N) to E-box motif within the hABCA1 promoter is responsible for the repressive effect of serum deprivation and oscillatory flow on the expression of ABCA1 in ECs. Evidence supporting such a thesis includes the following. 1) The adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SREBP2(N) could bind to the E-box motif of the ABCA1 promoter, hence inhibiting its activity, and the mutation of the E-box abolished the inhibitory effect of SREBP2(N). 2) Electrophoretic mobility shift and ChIP assays showed the association of SREBP2 and the ABCA1 promoter in ECs. 3) Functionally the SREBP2-down-regulated ABCA1 increased cholesterol accumulation and decreased the apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux. 4) Pathophysiologically disturbed flow patterns caused sustained activation of SREBP2 (21Lin T. Zeng L. Liu Y. DeFea K. Schwartz M.A. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 1296-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with consequent decrease in ABCA1 expression in ECs. Thus, this SREBP-regulated mechanism controls the efflux of cholesterol, which is a newly defined function of SREBP2 in the vascular wall. Apparently ABCA1 plays an important role in reverse cholesterol transfer and atherogenic protection (2Tall A.R. Wang N. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1205-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Most in vitro experiments involving ABCA1 function and regulation have been performed with the use of cultured macrophages, fibroblasts, and hepatocytes. Because it is exposed to the lipoproteins in the circulation, the vascular endothelium plays an important role in maintaining vascular integrity. We and others reported that ABCA1 is expressed in human aortic ECs, HUVECs, porcine brain capillary ECs, and rat liver ECs (19Liao H. Langmann T. Schmitz G. Zhu Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 31Panzenboeck U. Balazs Z. Sovic A. Hrzenjak A. Levak-Frank S. Wintersperger A. Malle E. Sattler W. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 25448-25453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Although the dysfunction of lipid metabolism and the ensuing oxidation and deposition in vascular cells impose important pathophysiological consequences, there have been only a few documented reports on ABCA1 regulation in ECs. The most studied transcriptional regulation of ABCA1 is the binding of the LXR/RXR heterodimer to the DR4 site of the ABCA1 promoter to up-regulate the expression of the ABCA1 gene (9Schwartz K. Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 794-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Similar regulation has also been observed in ECs (19Liao H. Langmann T. Schmitz G. Zhu Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The E-box of the ABCA1 promoter has been reported to be a silencing regulatory element (12Santamarina-Fojo S. Peterson K. Knapper C. Qiu Y. Freeman L. Cheng J.F. Osorio J. Remaley A. Yang X.P. Haudenschild C. Prades C. Chimini G. Blackmon E. Francois T. Duverger N. Rubin E.M. Rosier M. Denefle P. Fredrickson D.S. Brewer H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 29Yang X.P. Freeman L.A. Knapper C.L. Amar M.J. Remaley A. Brewer Jr., H.B. Santamarina-Fojo S. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that binds to various transcription factors such as USF1, USF2, and Fra2 for the repression of the human ABCA1 promoter in murine RAW cells. However, overexpression of USF1 and USF2 enhanced activity of the wild-type proximal hABCA1 promoter. In addition, the bindings of USFs were not modulated by any known activators of ABCA1. In this report, we found that serum starvation activated SREBP2(N) bound to both consensus and the ABCA1-specific E-box. The mutation of the E-box abolished the inhibitory effect of SREBP2 in the transient transfection assay. Under the same condition, the levels of USF-1 showed little change, and USF-2 was down-regulated. Thus, SREBP-2, but not USFs, was most likely to be involved in the negative regulation of ABCA1 promoter activity in ECs. Since USFs can activate or inhibit transcription by competing with other transcriptional factors, repressors, or activators for the E-box, the possibility that SREBPs replace USFs bound to the E-box under serum-free condition could not be excluded. In sterol-depleted cells, SREBP(N) is released from membranes and then translocates into the nucleus where it binds to SREs in the promoters of multiple genes encoding enzymes for cholesterol biosynthesis, unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, triglyceride biosynthesis, and lipid uptake (for reviews, see Refs. 15Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar, 16Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 17Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). SREBPs can bind both the SRE sequence and E-box motif in the promoters of several genes (15Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). SREBP1 primarily activates the fatty acid triglyceride and phospholipid pathways, whereas SREBP2 is responsible for cholesterol synthesis and uptake. Since the major function of ABCA1 is to mediate intracellular free cholesterol efflux to apolipoproteins, we therefore focused on the regulation of ABCA1 by SREBP2. It was reported that LDL incubation decreases the expression of SREBP2 and its target genes in cultured ECs (33Rodriguez C. Raposo B. Martinez-Gonzalez J. Llorente-Cortes V. Vilahur G. Badimon L. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 58: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We found that sterol depletion activated SREBP2 with the concurrent increase in LDLR and decrease in ABCA1 at the transcription level. This regulation was mimicked by the SREBP2(N) overexpression, which inhibited ABCA1 at the protein level with ensuing increase in cholesterol accumulation and decrease in apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux. In peripheral cells, intracellular cholesterol homeostasis is exquisitely regulated and depends on the balance between cholesterol synthesis, degradation, cholesterol ester formation, influx, and efflux (34Hayden M.R. Clee S.M. Brooks-Wilson A. Genest J. Attie A. Kastelein J.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 35Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1503-1521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In principle, the sterol deprivation-activated SREBPs serve as transcriptional factors for lipid/cholesterol synthesis, uptake, and storage. But whether SREBPs also regulate genes governing cholesterol efflux is not clear. It was postulated that caveolin functions as a regulator of cellular free cholesterol homeostasis in quiescent peripheral cells in which caveolin mediated free cholesterol efflux. Previous study by others showed that SREBPs inhibited the expression of the caveolin gene, which is contradictory to its stimulating effect on other promoters (36Bist A. Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10693-10698Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Our result indicates that SREBP2 binds directly to the E-box of the ABCA1 promoter. Whether SREBP2 forms a complex with other transcriptional factors or the binding of SREBP2 recruits other repressors deserves further studies. Recently we found that endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced activating transcription factor 6 suppressed the SREBP-mediated transcription in glucose-deprived HepG2 cells. The attenuated transcriptional activity of SREBP was due to the recruitment of a repressor, histone deacetylase 1, to the ATF6-SREBP complex (23Zeng L. Lu M. Mori K. Luo S. Lee A.S. Zhu Y. Shyy J.Y. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 24Zhu Y. Liao H.L. Wang N. Yuan Y. Ma K.S. Verna L. Stemerman M.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2465-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Nevertheless ABCA1 down-regulation by SREBP2 is another example of the coordinated regulation of cholesterol synthesis, influx, and efflux. In vitro study suggested that SREBPs in peripheral cells were suppressed by high levels of serum or cholesterol (17Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The physiological implications of the SREBP2 activation and ABCA1 down-regulation in ECs by SFM would be plausible since endothelium is exposed to full blood in vivo. We observed that oscillatory flow activated SREBPs and up-regulated their targeting genes in ECs in the presence of high levels of LDL and 25-hydroxycholesterol, an agent that is commonly used to suppress SREBP activation (20Liu Y. Chen B.P. Lu M. Zhu Y. Stemerman M.B. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 21Lin T. Zeng L. Liu Y. DeFea K. Schwartz M.A. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 1296-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Consistently we demonstrated in this study that oscillatory flow inhibited the expression of ABCA1 and the ABCA1 promoter activities in ECs. The block of SREBP activation by SCAP-C was able to reverse such an inhibitory effect, indicating the involvement of SREBPs. Thus, the pathophysiological implication for this result is that disturbed flow patterns, causing sustained SREBP2 activation and ABCA1 suppression, may impair the lipid/cholesterol homeostasis in the curves or branches of the arterial tree, promoting atherogenesis."

Although much is known about the cellular targets of PBAN, identification and functional characterization of the PBAN receptor (PBANR) has proven to be elusive. Given the sequence similarity between the active C-terminal regions of PBAN and neuromedin U, it was hypothesized that their respective receptors might also be similar in structure (Park, Y., Kim, Y. J., and Adams, M. E. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.99, 11423-11428). Consequently, utilizing primers constructed from the conserved regions of insect neuromedin U receptor homologues, a full-length 2780-nucleotide clone encoding a 46-kDa G protein-coupled receptor was amplified from a Bombyx mori pheromone gland cDNA library. Tissue distribution analyses revealed that the receptor transcript is specific to the pheromone gland where it undergoes significant up-regulation in the day preceding eclosion. When transiently expressed in Sf9 cells, the B. mori PBANR responds to PBAN by mobilizing extracellular calcium in a dose-dependent manner. Confocal microscopic studies demonstrated the specificity of enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged B. mori PBANR for PBAN and showed that PBAN induces internalization of the PBANR·PBAN complex. The rapid onset of internalization is mediated by a 67-amino acid C-terminal extension absent in the cloned Helicoverpa zea PBANR, which suggests that receptor internalization in that species likely utilizes a different mechanism. From these results, we have concluded that the cloned receptor gene encodes the B. mori PBANR and that it is both structurally and functionally distinct from the H. zea PBANR.

For many lepidopteran insects (i.e. moths and butterflies), the successful propagation of individual species is dependent on the female's ability to attract conspecific males; an event mediated by species-specific blends of volatile compounds known as sex pheromones (1Roelofs W.L. Rooney A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9179-9184Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These sex pheromones are produced and released by a specialized gland, appropriately known as the pheromone gland (PG), 1The abbreviations used are: PG, pheromone gland; PBAN, pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; PBANR, PBAN receptor; NmU, neuromedin U; TM, transmembrane; NmUR, NmU receptor; RR-PBAN, Rhodamine Red-labeled PBAN; EGFP, enhanced GFP; PBANR-EGFP, EGFP-tagged PBANR; ΔC-PBANR, C-terminal-deleted PBANR; ΔC-PBANR-EGFP, EGFP-tagged ΔC-PBANR; GnRHRs, gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors; nt, nucleotide(s); ORF, open reading frame. located between the eighth and ninth abdominal segments of the female. A major class of pheromone components produced by female moths is the C10-C18 unsaturated, acyclic, aliphatic compounds that contain an oxygenated functional group such as aldehyde, alcohol, or acetate ester. They are synthesized de novo from acetyl-CoA through fatty acid synthesis, desaturation, and limited chain-shortening reactions followed by reductive modification of the acyl group (2Roelofs W.L.

In most Lepidoptera, pheromone biosynthesis is regulated by pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN), a 33-amino acid neuropeptide amidated at its C terminus that originates from the subesophageal ganglion (4Raina A.K. Menn J.J. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 22: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Initially isolated in 1989 from Helicoverpa zea (5Raina A. Jaffe K. Kempe T.G. Keim P.

Inoue T. Matsumoto S. Ando T. Suzuki A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), it has since been identified in a variety of species (7Rafaeli A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 213: 49-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Structure-function studies have determined that the C-terminal FSPRLamide is the minimal sequence necessary for pheromonotropic activity (7Rafaeli A. Int. Rev.

Although the PBAN signal transduction cascade is initiated by an influx of extracellular calcium (7Rafaeli A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 213: 49-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), both the site of PBAN regulation and the downstream effector molecules utilized appear to be species-dependent. In H. zea, an increase in intracellular cAMP levels is necessary (9Jurenka R.A. Jacquin E. Roelofs W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8621-8625Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) for PBAN regulation of the one or more enzymatic functions that occur at a step in or prior to fatty acid synthesis (10Jurenka R.A. Jacquin E. Roelofs W.L. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1991; 17: 81-91Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In B. mori, however, a similar rise in the levels of the second messenger is not required (11Matsumoto S. Recent Res. Devel. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1997; 1: 33-49Google Scholar) for PBAN-induced reduction of the fatty-acyl group (12Ozawa R.A. Ando T. Nagasawa H. Kataoka H. Suzuki A. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1993; 57: 2144-2147Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar), i.e. the final step in the B. mori pheromone biosynthetic pathway. These findings could be an indication that the PBAN receptors (PBANRs) of these two insect species are functionally different. PBAN actions had long been proposed to be mediated by the stimulation of a specific G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) located on the surface of pheromone-producing cells (7Rafaeli A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 213: 49-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although molecular elucidation of the PBANR lagged significantly behind identification of other proteins involved in the pheromone biosynthetic pathways, advances in insect genome projects, most notably the sequencing of the Drosophila and Anopheles genomes (13Adams M.D. Celniker S.E.

A 346-amino acid GPCR recently identified and characterized as the H. zea PBANR was homology-cloned based on sequence similarity with the receptor for the mammalian neuropeptide, neuromedin U (NmU) (15Choi M.Y. Fuerst E.J. Rafaeli A. Jurenka R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9721-9726Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Based on the sequence similarities between the C-terminal pentapeptide motifs necessary for biological activity in NmU, FRPRNamide (16Brighton P.J. Szekeres P.G. Willars G.B. Pharmacol. Rev. 2004; 56: 231-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and PBAN, FSPRLamide, it had been postulated that the respective receptors may likewise exhibit regions of similarity. In support of this hypothesis, Hewes and Taghert (17Hewes R.S. Taghert P.H. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1126-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) had earlier reported the presence of multiple GPCRs in the Drosophila genome homologous with the NmU/arginine vasopressin family of receptors specific for peptides containing the C-terminal PRXamide motif. Park et al. (18Park Y. Kim Y.J. Adams M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11423-11428Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) further elaborated on those findings by reporting that Drosophila GPCR CG8795 (GenBank™ accession no. AF522190), putatively identified as a PRXamide receptor, interacts with a number of C-terminal FXPRLamide peptides, including H. zea PBAN. In addition to promoting the coupling, and eventual activation, of the heterotrimeric G proteins necessary for promulgating the appropriate signal transduction cascade, ligand-receptor interactions also initiate the molecular events that lead to receptor desensitization. The current paradigm of receptor desensitization is a multistep, multicomponent process that includes: 1) uncoupling of the heterotrimeric G proteins in response to the phosphorylation of specific residues in the GPCR C terminus and/or intracellular loops, 2) endocytosis of the GPCR, and 3) recycling of the GPCR back to the cell surface following dephosphorylation, or targeting of the GPCR·ligand complex for degradation followed by down-regulation of the total cellular complement of the GPCR as result of decreased protein synthesis (19Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). An intriguing aspect of the desensitization process is the myriad of functions attributed to the GPCR C terminus, from harboring putative phosphorylation sites (19Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar), to containing both positive and negative regulators of the endocytotic machinery (19Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar), to serving as an anchor point upon which numerous protein-protein interactions can be built (20Bockaert J. Marin P. Dumuis A. Fagni L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 21Becamel C. Galeotti N. Poncet J. Jouin P. Dumuis A. Bockaert J. Marin P. Biol. Proced. Online. 2002; 4: 94-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Consequently, the functionality of the GPCR C-terminal tail has been greatly expanded in recent years to include a role in receptor trafficking (22Venkatesan S. Petrovic A. Locati M. Kim Y.O.

Life Sci. 2003; 73: 2263-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Given the relatively recent identification of the PBANR, nothing is known concerning the residues that comprise the PBAN binding pocket, the structural motifs utilized in heterotrimeric G protein coupling, or the functionality, if any, of the PBANR C terminus. In this report, we describe the cloning of a GPCR gene from a B. mori PG cDNA library that we have concluded, based on tissue and stage specificity, in conjunction with expression studies that demonstrate dose-dependent calcium mobilization, specific PBAN binding, and PBAN-induced cellular dynamics, encodes the B. mori PBANR. Although the cloned B. mori PBANR exhibits high homology with the H. zea PBANR throughout the transmembrane (TM) regions, the presence of a 67-amino acid C-terminal extension in the B. mori PBANR indicates that there is a significant structural difference between the two PBANRs. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that PBAN induces rapid internalization of the B. mori PBANR and that the C-terminal extension is essential for that internalization. Insects—B. mori eggs (Shuko × Ryuhaku) were purchased from Katakura Kogyo (Matsumoto, Japan) and larvae were raised on an artificial diet as described previously (28Fonagy A. Matsumoto S. Uchiumi K. Orikasa C. Mitsui T. J. Pest. Sci. 1992; 17: 47-54Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cloning of Receptor cDNA—mRNA was isolated from PGs of newly eclosed B. mori females with a Micro Fast Track Kit (Invitrogen) and used as a template for first strand cDNA synthesis employing random hexamers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). To amplify receptor DNA fragments, a set of degenerate primers were designed from the conserved sequences encoding the TMs of Drosophila GPCRs CG8795 and CG8784 (GenBank™ accession no. AF522189) and two Anopheles sequences (GenBank™ accession nos. BK0001383 and BK0001384). The primer set included the sense primers 5′-ATGCAYACIGCIACNAAY-3′ (corresponding to the second TM sequence -MHT-ATN-) and 5′-GCIAAYGCNACIGTNCTIAC-3′ (corresponding to the third TM sequence -ANATVLT-) and the antisense primers 5′-YTGIGCRTGRAAIGGIGCCCA-3′ (corresponding to the sixth TM sequence -WAPFHAQ-) and 5′-ICGRAAYTTRTGIGACAT-3′ (corresponding to the seventh TM sequence -MSHKFR-). Touchdown PCR amplification was performed using primers to the second and seventh TMs, the conditions consisted of 95 °C for 1 min then 22 cycles of 94 °C at 45 s, 52 °C for 45 s (lowered by 0.5 °C/cycle), 72 °C for 90 s followed by 20 cycles consisting of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, and ended at 72 °C for 5 min. These products then served as templates for amplification by means of nested PCR using primers to the third and sixth TMs, the conditions of which were 95 °C for 90 s followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 90 s, and ended at 72 °C for 10 min. Both amplifications were performed using LA Taq (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan). Products corresponding to the expected sizes were gel-excised, sub-cloned using the pGEM-T Easy vector system (Promega), and sequenced. Specific primers, 5′-TACTGACTATTACGGCATT-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATGAAAAACGACAGCG-3′ (antisense), were then designed and utilized in conjunction with T3 and T7 primers to amplify the 5′- and 3′-ends of the cDNA fragment from a p50 PG cDNA library (29Yoshiga T. Okano K. Mita K. Shimada T. Matsumoto S. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 246: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The resulting products were sub-cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector and sequenced. Primers corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ termini of the cDNA were used to amplify the full-length cDNA from the library, and the resulting product was sub-cloned, sequenced as before, and submitted to GenBank™. Northern Blot Hybridization—The Micro Fast Track kit was used to isolate mRNA from various tissues of adult (day 0) and fifth instar (day 3) B. mori larvae. After heat denaturation, 2 μg of mRNA from each tissue was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and then transferred to a Hybond-XL nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Pre-hybridization was performed for 1 h at 68 °C in Perfect Hybridization Plus buffer (Sigma). The [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probe was prepared from the receptor cDNA ORF (1239 bp) using a Random Primer DNA Labeling Kit Version 2 (Takara Bio) and purified with Probe Quant G50 Micro Columns (Amersham Biosciences). Probe hybridization was performed at 68 °C for 18 h at which point the blot was washed in an initial solution of 0.1% SDS/1 × SSC for 5 min at 68 °C and then transferred to 0.1% SDS/0.2 × SSC for two 5-min washes at 68 °C. The blot was exposed for 18 h at -80 °C to BioMax film (Kodak). For estimation of the relative abundance of B. mori PBANR transcripts, ratios of the relative blot intensities corresponding to B. mori PBANR mRNA and actin-3 mRNA were quantified with ImageGauge 4.0 software (Fuji PhotoFilm Co., Ltd.). The ratios were expressed in terms of arbitrary units and presented in histogram form. Construction and Transfection of Expression Plasmids—To obtain cells transiently expressing B. mori PBANR, the expression plasmid, pIB-PBANR, containing the 413-amino acid ORF behind the Opie-2 promoter was generated using the pIB/V5-His-TOPO TA Expression kit (Invitrogen). Gene-specific primers 5′-GAGCTCATATTCGAAATGATG-3′ (from -9, including an SacI site, referred to as PBANRSacF) and 5′-GAATTCCTATGGAGAGATCGC-3′ (plus stop codon and an EcoRI site) allowed PCR amplification of the receptor ORF using LA Taq. A second expression plasmid, pIB-ΔC-PBANR, encoding a copy of B. mori PBANR lacking the C-terminal extension, was generated using PBANRSacF and the antisense gene-specific primer 5′-CTAAGCCGCTAATGTCATCTT-3′ (including stop codon). The PCR products were cloned into the vector pIB/V5-His-TOPO and sequenced to confirm the presence and orientation of the inserts. Transfections were performed according to the Cellfectin (Invitrogen) transfection reagent protocol using adherent monolayer Sf9 cells and ∼1.5 μg of DNA/transfection. Twelve hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh media containing streptomycin/kanamycin, and cells were incubated for an additional 24-36 h at 27 °C. For confocal microscopic examination, we utilized overlap extension PCR to construct the chimeric receptor expression plasmid, pIB-PBANR-EGFP, by fusing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) coding sequence to the C terminus of B. mori PBANR. The first PCR entailed amplification of the complete coding region of the B. mori PBANR minus the stop codon from the plasmid, pIB-PBANR, by using the specific sense PBANR primer PBANRSacF and the chimeric antisense primer 5′-GCCCTTGCTCACCATTGGAGAGATCGCGAT-3′ and KOD-Plus- (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The second PCR amplification involved amplification of the EGFP coding sequence from pEGFP-1 (Clontech) using the antisense gene-specific primer 5′-CTTGTACAGCTCGTCC-3′ and the chimeric sense primer 5′-ATCGCGATCTCTCCAATGGTGAGCAAAGGGC-3′. Similarly, an EGFP-tagged version of the truncated receptor, pIB-ΔC-PBANR-EGFP, was constructed using PBANRSacF and the chimeric antisense primer 5′-GCCCTTGCTCACCATAGCCGCTAATGTCAT-3′. The second reaction using pEGFP-1 as a template was performed with the antisense gene-specific primer and the chimeric sense primer 5′-ATGACATTAGCGGCTATGGTGAGCAAGGGC-3′. The final reactions for each construct involved the products from the two previous reactions as templates and utilized the PBANR gene-specific sense primer and the EGFP-specific antisense primer. The resulting products were sub-cloned into the expression vector as described earlier and sequenced. A control expression plasmid, pIB/EGFP, was also constructed using the gene-specific primers 5′-ATGGTGAGCAAGGGCG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTGTACAGCTCGTCC-3′ (antisense) and pEGFP-1 as the PCR template. After ligation, the expression vector was likewise sequenced. Measurement of Calcium Influx—On the day of the experiment, Sf9 cells transiently expressing B. mori PBANR were harvested, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and suspended in a modified Ringer's buffer (15Choi M.Y. Fuerst E.J. Rafaeli A. Jurenka R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9721-9726Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) at ∼9 × 105 cells/ml. From this suspension, 150-μl aliquots were centrifuged (700 × g for 1 min), and the cells were re-suspended in 150 μl of buffer plus Fluo-4AM (Molecular Probes) at a final concentration of 2 μm. Cells were incubated at room temp for 40 min in the dark on a rotating shaker. After incubation, the cells were washed twice with buffer and placed in the dark for another 20 min to allow hydrolysis of the Fluo-4AM ester bond. Fluorescence was measured on a Wallac ARVO SX plate reader (Amersham Biosciences) using a 485-nm CW-lamp filter and a 535-nm emission filter. Fluorescence was monitored for 1 min prior to addition of samples and then every 10 s for 2 min following addition of samples (10 μl). Collected data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Preparation of a Fluorescent PBAN Analog—To prepare a fluorescent analog of synthetic B. mori PBAN (LSEDMPATPADQEMYQPDPEEMESRTRYFSPRLamide), we modified the N-terminal amino group with Rhodamine Red succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes). In a 50-μl reaction, 2.5 nmol of peptide, and 10 nmol of Rhodamine Red succinimidyl ester were added to 0.15 m sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.2) and stirred overnight at room temperature. The conjugated peptide, designated as Rhodamine Red-labeled PBAN (RR-PBAN), was purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography using a dual solvent system consisting of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and 80% CH3CN/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent B) on a Pegasil 300-C4 column (4.6 × 250 mm; Senshu Scientific Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with Nanospace SI-2 pumps (Shiseido Co., Ltd.) and the software package Chromquest. RR-PBAN was eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using a step-gradient that went from 1-10% B in 10 min, then to 40% B over the next 30 min, and concluded with a 10 min increase to 99% B. Absorbance was monitored at 220, 280, and 570 nm with a SpectraSystem UV6000LP detector (ThermoFinnigan). Pheromonotropic activity of RR-PBAN was confirmed using a B. mori in vivo assay (28Fonagy A. Matsumoto S. Uchiumi K. Orikasa C. Mitsui T. J. Pest. Sci. 1992; 17: 47-54Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and RR-PBAN was stored at 4 °C until needed. Confocal Microscopic Examination of PBANR-EGFP Expression—To examine the cellular localizations of EGFP-tagged PBANR (PBANR-EGFP) and RR-PBAN, confocal microscopy imaging analyses of both live and fixed cells were performed. Sf9 cells attached to 27-mm glass-bottom dishes (Matsunami, Tokyo, Japan) were transfected with ∼1.5 μg of plasmid DNA. Twelve hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh media containing streptomycin/kanamycin, and cells were incubated for an additional 24-36 h at 27 °C. For live cell imaging, cells were washed with fresh media and EGFP fluorescence imaged with a Leica TCS NT confocal system using a 488-nm laser line. To determine the degree of co-localization between PBANR-EGFP and RR-PBAN, transfected cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated in the presence of 50 nm RR-PBAN with or without 5 μm unlabeled B. mori PBAN or 5 μmB. mori adipokinetic hormone (Bachem, Budendorf, Switzerland) for 1 h at 4 °C. The low temperature was utilized to minimize loss of bound RR-PBAN from the cell surface by way of receptor internalization. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline to remove unbound label and fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. To examine internalization of the receptor/ligand complex, cells were treated as before and then incubated at 27 °C for 30 min prior to fixation. EGFP fluorescence was again imaged using a 488-nm laser line while Rhodamine Red was excited with a 568-nm laser line. For these experiments, only one laser line was used for single channel recordings to minimize cross-talk. Images were processed and merged using Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). To further evaluate receptor internalization, the fluorescence attributable to internalized RR-PBAN (i.e. 568-nm fluorescence) was measured following 30 min at 27 °C using the Leica LCS Lite 2.0 software package (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). Quantification was performed similar to Ref. 30Cornea A. Janovick J.A. Lin X. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4272-4280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Briefly, using the free-hand tool in the LCS Lite software package two regions of interest were selected on the image of a cell section: one region that contains the entire cell, and the other region comprising only the cell interior and excluding the plasma membrane. The fluorescence intensity of each region was calculated, adjusted for pixel number, and expressed as a ratio of the intracellular fluorescence (not including plasma membrane) to the total fluorescence of a cell (including the plasma membrane). Data were analyzed in GraphPad Prism 3.0 using a Student's t test. Isolation of B. mori PBANR cDNA Clone—Given the potential sequence similarities with neuromedin U receptors (NmURs) (17Hewes R.S. Taghert P.H. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1126-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 18Park Y. Kim Y.J. Adams M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11423-11428Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), we chose a homology-based molecular approach to identify the B. mori PBANR. A search of sequences in the Drosophila and Anopheles genomes exhibiting significant homology with the Drosophila receptor CG8795 identified three additional dipteran homologues, the Drosophila receptor CG8784, and two sequences from the Anopheles genome, BK001383 and BK001384, which have subsequently been putatively identi"

Typically there are 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in prokaryotes, one for each amino acid (1Carter Jr., C.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 715-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 2Martinis S.A. Schimmel P. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 887-901Google Scholar, 3Giegé R. Sissler M. Florentz C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5017-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 4Pelchat M. Lapointe J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 343-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, protein synthesis occurs not only in the cytoplasm but also in organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts (5Maréchal-Drouard L. Weil J.H. Dietrich A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 8: 115-131Google Scholar). Compartmentalization of the protein synthesis machinery within the cytoplasm and organelles of eukaryotes leads to isoaccepting tRNA species that are distinguished by nucleotide sequence, subcellular location, and enzyme specificity. Thus, eukaryotes such as yeast commonly have two genes that encode distinct sets of proteins for each aminoacylation activity, one localized to the cytoplasm and the other to the mitochondria. Each set aminoacylates the isoaccepting tRNAs within its respective cell compartment and is sequestered from isoacceptors found in other compartments. Except for some algae, all aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are encoded by nuclear genes regardless of the cell compartments to which they are confined. In contrast to most known tRNA synthetases, two Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes, HTS1 (the gene encoding histidyl-tRNA synthetase) (6Natsoulis G. Hilger F. Fink G.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 235-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and VAS1 (the gene encoding valyl-tRNA synthetase) (7Chatton B. Walter P. Ebel J.-P. Lacroute F. Fasiolo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 52-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), specify both the mitochondrial and cytosolic forms. Each of these genes encodes mRNAs with distinct 5′-ends. These mRNAs have two alternative in-frame initiation codons. The mitochondrial form of the enzyme is translated from the first AUG on the “long” message, whereas the cytosolic form is translated from the second in-frame AUG on the “short” message. As a consequence, the mitochondrial enzymes have the same polypeptide sequences as their cytosolic counterparts, except for a short amino-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. The transit peptide is subsequently cleaved away upon import into the mitochondria. Because the two isozymes are targeted to different compartments, the two isoforms of valyl-tRNA synthetase, for example, cannot substitute for each other in vivo (7Chatton B. Walter P. Ebel J.-P. Lacroute F. Fasiolo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 52-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar scenario has been observed for the genes that encode the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic forms of Arabidopsis thaliana alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS), 1The abbreviations used are: AlaRS, alanyl-tRNA synthetase; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; YPG, yeast extract peptone glycerol; RT, reverse transcription. threonyl-tRNA synthetase, and valyl-tRNA synthetase (8Souciet G. Menand B. Ovesna J. Cosset A. Dietrich A. Wintz H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Previous studies on CYC1 (9Sherman F. Stewart J.W. Schweingruber A.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 215-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and HIS4 (10Donahue T.F. Cigan A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2955-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) in S. cerevisiae suggested that AUG is the only codon recognized as the translational initiator and that the AUG codon nearest to the 5′-end of mRNA serves as the start site for translation. If the first AUG codon is mutated, then initiation can begin at the next available AUG from the 5′-end of the message. The same rules appear to apply to virtually all eukaryotes. However, there are many examples in higher eukaryotes where cellular and viral mRNAs can initiate from “non-AUG” codons that differ from AUG by just one nucleotide (11Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5073-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The relatively weak base-pairing between a non-AUG codon and the anticodon of initiator tRNA appears to be compensated for by interactions with nearby nucleotides, in particular a purine (A or G) in position –3 and a G in position +4 (12Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, mutations in the sequence surrounding the first AUG can lead to its inefficient utilization as initiator and subsequent use of an AUG at a downstream location. In addition to sequence context, a stable hairpin structure located 12–15 nucleotides downstream from the initiator can also facilitate recognition of a non-AUG codon by the 40 S ribosomal subunit (13Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8301-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In contrast, there seems to be little effect from sequence context in yeast (14Cigan A.M. Pabich E.K. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2964-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and consequently, yeast cannot efficiently use non-AUG codons as the translation start site (15Clements J.M. Laz T.M. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4533-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). So far only two yeast genes, GRS1 (one of the two glycyl-tRNA synthetase genes in S. cerevisiae) (16Chang K.J. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13778-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and CARP2A (the only gene coding for acidic ribosomal protein P2A in Candida albicans) (17Abramczyk D. Tchorzewski M. Grankowski N. Yeast. 2003; 20: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), have been reported to use naturally occurring non-AUG triplets as translation initiators. Although there are two homologous glycyl-tRNA synthetase genes, GRS1 and GRS2, in the yeast S. cerevisiae, only one, i.e. GRS1, is functional and provides both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial aminoacylation activities, whereas the other, i.e. GRS2, appears to be dispensable for growth (18Turner R.J. Lovato M. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27681-27688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Further studies by site-specific mutagenesis demonstrated that the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial glycyl-tRNA synthetase activities are in effect provided by two protein isoforms with distinct amino termini. A short form that is responsible for the cytoplasmic activity is translationally initiated from a classical AUG initiator, whereas a longer isoform that is responsible for the mitochondrial activity is initiated from an upstream inframe UUG codon (16Chang K.J. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13778-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These two isoforms function exclusively in their respective compartments and, thus, cannot substitute for each other under normal conditions. Because to date examples of native non-AUG initiation are still rare in low eukaryotes, we wondered whether GRS1 is just an exception in the yeast or if there are more examples elsewhere in the genome. Furthermore, the regulatory mechanism that enables non-AUG initiation to occur naturally in yeast remains elusive. To shed light on the control mechanism and advance our knowledge on the functional diversity of a single gene, we searched the yeast genome for genes that need to provide activities in two distinct subcellular compartments but do not have alternative AUG codons in the appropriate positions. We noted ALA1 (19Ripmaster T.L. Shiba K. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4932-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the only gene coding for alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) in the yeast genome, as a promising candidate. In the work described here we cloned the ALA1 gene in a low copy number vector and investigated its functional phenotype in relation to the mechanism of its transcriptional as well as translational control in vivo. Our experimental data suggested that ALA1 is a bifunctional gene that provides both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial activities. Further investigation showed that two distinct protein isoforms are generated from this gene through alternative transcription and translation. However, unlike the case of GRS1, where a single transcript serves as the template for synthesis of both isoforms, three overlapping transcripts with distinct 5′-ends are alternatively generated from this gene. Even more remarkable is the discovery that the mitochondrial form is translationally initiated from two inframe successive ACG triplets that are located 69 nucleotides upstream of the putative AUG initiator for the cytoplasmic form. Considering the fact that yeast ribosomes initiate poorly from a non-AUG triplet, we surmised that the second ACG triplet might serve as a remedial initiation site for the mitochondrial form in case of initiation failure at the first ACG. Construction of Plasmids—Cloning of ALA1 from S. cerevisiae followed standard protocols. The wild-type ALA1 sequence was cloned into the low copy number yeast shuttle vector pRS315 (20Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The clone consisted of a sequence extending from 250-bp upstream of the ALA1 open reading frame to 3-bp downstream of the stop codon. Various point mutations such as M1A (ATG1 to GCG) and I(–1)stop (ATA–1 to TAA) were subsequently introduced into the wild-type clone following standard protocols (the number –1 in I(–1)stop refers to the 1 codon triplet that precedes ATG1). For Western blot analysis of non-AUG-initiated protein synthesis, the open reading frame of lexA was first amplified by PCR as a NdeI-XhoI fragment and cloned into the high copy number yeast shuttle vector pADH, a derivative of pQB169 (Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Lexington, MA) with the addition of a short sequence coding for a His6 tag immediately after the multiple cloning site. The lexA construct was subsequently used as a template for construction of various ALA1-lexA fusions. A wild-type ALA1 presequence containing base pairs –105∼–1 relative to ATG1 was amplified by PCR as a PstI-NdeI fragment and cloned in-frame into the 5′-end of the lexA gene, resulting in ALA1-lexA. Various sense mutations, such as T(–25)N/T(–24)S and T(–25)M, were subsequently introduced into the ALA1 presequence in the ALA1-lexA fusion, where –24 and –25 refer to the 24 and 25 codon triplets preceding ATG1, respectively. To inactivate the native initiator ATG1 of lexA at the junction between the ALA1 and lexA sequences, a SpeI site (ACTAGT) was substituted for the NdeI site in the ALA1-lexA fusions, resulting in ALA1-lexA*, where the asterisk (*) denotes a mutation in ATG1 of lexA. These lexA fusions were then transformed into TRY11 (19Ripmaster T.L. Shiba K. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4932-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and tested for their expression patterns by Western blotting using anti-LexA antibody and standard protocols. These lexA constructs were expressed under the control of a constitutive ADH promoter (21Bennetzen J.L. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3018-3025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mapping the 5′-Ends of ALA1 Transcripts—Identification of the 5′-ends of ALA1 transcripts was carried out by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE, BD Biosciences). Briefly, poly(A)+ RNA was isolated by an oligo(dT) cellulose column (Invitrogen), and the 5′-terminal sequences of ALA1 mRNAs were transcribed with reverse transcriptase into first strand cDNAs using an antisense ALA1-specific primer that was annealed to a region 660-bp downstream of the initiator ATG1. The first-strand cDNA products were then amplified in a touchdown PCR reaction using Pfu DNA polymerase, with a universal primer (provided by the manufacturer) annealed to the upstream region and a nested ALA1-specific primer annealed 550-bp downstream of the initiator ATG1. After PCR-driven amplification, the double-stranded DNA products were cloned and sequenced. Complementation Assays for the Cytoplasmic Function of ALA1—The yeast ALA1 knockout strain TRY11 was as described (19Ripmaster T.L. Shiba K. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4932-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This strain is maintained by a plasmid encoding AlaRS and the URA3 marker. Complementation assays for the cytoplasmic function of plasmid-borne ALA1 and derivatives were carried out by introducing a test plasmid into TRY11 and determining the ability of transformants to grow in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA). The cultures were incubated at 30 °C for 3–5 days or until colonies appeared (photos for the complementation assays were taken at day 3 after incubation). The transformants evicted the maintenance plasmid with the URA3 marker in the presence of 5-FOA (19Ripmaster T.L. Shiba K. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4932-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, only an enzyme with the cytoplasmic AlaRS activity encoded by the second plasmid (with the LEU2 marker) could rescue the growth defect. Complementation Assays for the Mitochondrial Function of ALA1— Mitochondrial AlaRS activity of constructs expressing a functional cytoplasmic AlaRS was assayed by plating the transformants on YPG (yeast extract-peptone-glycerol) after selection on 5-FOA. However, assaying mitochondrial AlaRS activity of constructs that did not encode a functional cytoplasmic AlaRS required an additional plasmid to provide the essential cytoplasmic AlaRS activity (after eviction of the original maintenance plasmid on 5-FOA plates). To be consistent, assays of mitochondrial AlaRS activity were carried out for all constructs in the same manner irrespective of their potential to function as a cytoplasmic AlaRS. For this purpose we co-transformed TRY11 with a second maintenance plasmid that expresses a functional cytoplasmic AlaRS but is defective in mitochondrial AlaRS activity. The second maintenance plasmid (with a HIS3 marker) contained ALA1I(–1)stop cloned in pRS313 (20Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, TRY11 was co-transformed with the test plasmid (carrying a LEU2 marker) and the second maintenance plasmid. In the presence of 5-FOA, the first maintenance plasmid (containing a URA3 marker) was evicted from the co-transformants, whereas the second maintenance plasmid was retained. Thus, all co-transformants survived 5-FOA selections due to the presence of the cytoplasmic AlaRS derived from the second maintenance plasmid. The co-transformants were further tested on YPG plates for their mitochondrial phenotypes at 30 °C, with results documented at day 3 after plating. Because a yeast cell cannot survive on glycerol without functional mitochondria, the co-transformants do not grow on YPG plates unless a functional mitochondrial AlaRS is present. Western Blot—The protein expression patterns of the ALA1-lexA fusions were determined by a chemiluminescence-based Western blot analysis after standard protocols. The various ALA-lexA constructs were first transformed into INVSc1 (Novagen), and the transformants were subsequently grown in a selection medium without leucine. Total protein extracts were prepared from each of the transformants with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm EDTA, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 45 μg of the protein extracts were loaded onto a mini gel (size, 8 × 10 cm) containing 12% polyacrylamide and electrophoresed. Alternatively, the protein extracts were resolved in a gel of standard size (size: 18 × 20 cm) containing 15% polyacrylamide to enhance the resolution. After electrophoresis at 130 volts for 2∼6 h, the resolved proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry blotting device. The membrane was hybridized with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-LexA antibody (Invitrogen) and then exposed to x-ray film after the addition of the appropriate substrates. Transcripts of ALA1—Unlike most yeast tRNA synthetases that have two distinct nuclear genes (one coding for the cytoplasmic enzyme and the other for the mitochondrial counterpart), ALA1 is the only gene for AlaRS in the yeast genome (19Ripmaster T.L. Shiba K. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4932-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because we thought this gene might code for two distinct forms of the enzyme via alternative transcription and translation (as do VAS1 and HTS1), we scanned the 5′-terminal nucleotide sequences of ALA1 for alternative ATG codons (at the RNA level we commonly used AUG instead of ATG to describe the codon). Surprisingly, only one ATG codon, designated ATG1, was found at the 5′-end of the putative ALA1 open reading frame (Fig. 1A). The predicted protein showed sequence similarity to AlaRSs from human (cytoplasmic form), Escherichia coli, and A. thaliana (cytoplasmic form), especially when amino-terminal regions were compared (19Ripmaster T.L. Shiba K. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4932-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Additionally, no apparent mitochondrial targeting signals were found in the amino-terminal region of this predicted protein (Fig. 1B), suggesting that, like other cytoplasmic AlaRSs, the ATG1-initiated protein is a cytoplasmic enzyme. Because the Arabidopsis gene for AlaRS codes for both the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial forms through alternative use of two in-frame ATG codons (22Mireau H. Lancelin D. Small I.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we decided to test if yeast instead use a non-ATG codon to initiate the translation of its mitochondrial form of AlaRS. To determine whether two distinct forms of AlaRS were alternatively produced from ALA1, we first checked the transcription profiles of this gene in vivo. Transcription start sites and 5′-terminal nucleotide sequences of ALA1 transcripts were identified using 5′-RACE (23Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, three transcripts were identified with their 5′-ends mapped to positions –117, –105, and –54, respectively, relative to the A of ATG1 (Fig. 1C). Among the 3 transcripts, the longer two extended upstream of TAA–28 (nucleotides –84 to –82) and were considered to be the likely templates for the mitochondrial form. In contrast, the 5′-end of the short one mapped between TAA–28 and ATG1 and was considered to be the likely template for the cytoplasmic form. In addition, sequences of the cDNAs (∼600 bp determined) were identical to those of the genomic DNA (data not shown). Thus, alternative splicing at the 5′-end of ALA1 mRNAs and translation initiation from an AUG codon spliced from far were ruled out. Alternative Translation of ALA1—If the two forms of AlaRS were initiated at two distinct initiation sites, then a missense mutation at one initiator should impair synthesis (and function) of one form but not the other, whereas a nonsense mutation placed between the two sites should only affect synthesis of the protein from the upstream initiator. To test this hypothesis a missense mutation of Met1 to Ala (ATG1 to GCG) and a nonsense mutation of Ile–1 to a stop codon (ATA–1 to TAA) were introduced into separate ALA1 constructs and assayed for their effect on complementation of a yeast strain (TRY11) bearing a ΔALA1 mutation. As shown in Fig. 2, A–C, wild-type ALA1 encoded both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial AlaRS activities. When ATG1 was mutated to GCG to give ALA1M1A, colony-forming ability was lost on FOA (Fig. 2B). This mutant retained the mitochondrial function, as shown by the rescue of TRY11 growth on YPG (Fig. 2C). This observation suggested that ATG1 serves as the translation initiator for the cytoplasmic but not the mitochondrial form. In contrast, when ATA–1 was mutated to TAA, the resultant mutant (ALA1I(–1)stop) lost its mitochondrial (Fig. 2C) but not cytoplasmic function (Fig. 2B). Thus, translation of the mitochondrial form was initiated at a site upstream of ATA–1. Non-AUG Initiation—Because no alternative in-frame ATG codons are located between TAA–28 and ATG1 (Fig. 1A), the possibility that a non-ATG codon differing from ATG by a single nucleotide serves as the translation initiator for the mitochondrial form was investigated. There are 8 in-frame triplets that differ from ATG by one nucleotide between TAA–28 and ATG1, including AAG–26, ACG–25, ACG–24, AGG–18, TTG–16, AAG–11, AAG–10, and ATA–1 (Fig. 1A). To determine whether any of these could serve as the translation initiator for the mitochondrial form, a mutational analysis mapped the approximate location of the putative initiator codon. As summarized in Fig. 3A, a nonsense mutation at AAG–26 (resulting in ALA1K(–26)stop) had little effect on the mitochondrial activity of ALA1, whereas a nonsense mutation at TTG–16 (resulting in ALA1L(–16)stop) impaired mitochondrial activity. Neither mutation affected the cytoplasmic function of ALA1 (Fig. 3B). These results suggested that the translation initiator for the mitochondrial AlaRS was located somewhere between AAG–26 and TTG–16. Mutations at AGG–18 (resulting in ALA1R(–18)R and ACG–24 (resulting in ALA1T(–24)S) had little effect on the mitochondrial activity, i.e. transformants formed colonies after ∼2–3 days of growth on the YPG plate (Fig. 3C). In contrast, a mutation at ACG–25 (resulting in ALA1T(–25)N) significantly compromised mitochondrial activity, i.e. transformants did not appear until after ∼3–4 days of incubation on the YPG plate (Fig. 3C) and remained small even after 5 days of growth (data not shown). None of these mutations in the ALA1 presequence affected the cytoplasmic function of ALA1 (Fig. 3B). Because mutation at ACG–25 did not completely abolish the mitochondrial activity of ALA1, the possibility of a remedial initiator located within the region between AAG–26 and TTG–16 was further investigated. An obvious candidate was ACG–24, because this codon triplet has the same nucleotide sequence as ACG–25. A double mutation of these tandem non-ATG codons gave ALA1T(–25)N/T(–24)S. This construct was devoid of mitochondrial AlaRS activity, i.e. transformants did not grow after 3 days of incubation on the YPG plate (Fig. 3C). To check if the double mutation caused deleterious change in secondary structure of ALA1 mRNAs, an ATG codon was subsequently inserted between AAG–26 and the double mutation site and assayed for its effect on complementation. As expected, the inserted ATG codon restored the complementation activity of the double mutant (data not shown). In addition, when ACG–25 was mutated to a canonical initiator ATG, the resultant mutant ALA1T(–25)M retained both functions (Fig. 3). Furthermore, an RT-PCR experiment showed that wt ALA1 and ALA1T(–25)N/T(–24)S expressed a similar level of RNA (Fig. 3D), suggesting that it is the initiator activity and not RNA stability that was damaged by the T(–25)N/T(–24)S double mutation. These results demonstrate that ACG–25 and ACG–24 function redundantly. Either triplet can initiate translation of the mitochondrial form of AlaRS in the absence of the other (see ALA1T(–25)N and ALA1T(–24)S in Fig. 3C). Nevertheless, ACG–25 appeared to play a predominant role in initiation (mutation at this codon severely reduced growth of the transformants on YPG medium, whereas mutation at the second (ACG–24) had no detectable phenotype). Thus, the first of the two ACG codons is the more robust. Western Blot Analysis of Non-AUG-initiated Protein Translation—Because the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial isoforms are similar in size (107 versus 110 kDa) it is difficult to distinguish between the two by Western blots, especially after the processing of the mitochondrial precursors by mitochondrial matrix-processing peptidase. To demonstrate the initiating ability of the redundant ACG codons, various ALA1 presequences (containing base pairs –105 to –1 relative to ATG1) were fused in-frame to the 5′-end of a smaller gene, lexA, and the expression patterns of the resultant ALA1-lexA fusions were determined by a chemiluminescence-based Western blot analysis using anti-LexA antibody (Fig. 4) (these fusions each contain an in-frame ATG triplet at the junction between the ALA1 and lexA sequences and were expressed under the control"

To expand the knowledge of retinoid biochemistry in vertebrates, we studied the enzymes involved in plant metabolism of carotenoids, a related group of compounds. We identified a family of vertebrate enzymes that share significant similarity and a putative phytoene desaturase domain with a recently described plant carotenoid isomerase (CRTISO), which isomerizes prolycopene to all-trans-lycopene. Comparison of heterologously expressed mouse and plant enzymes indicates that unlike plant CRTISO, the CRTISO-related mouse enzyme is inactive toward prolycopene. Instead, the CRTISO-related mouse enzyme is a retinol saturase carrying out the saturation of the 13–14 double bond of all-trans-retinol to produce all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol. The product of mouse retinol saturase (RetSat) has a shifted UV absorbance maximum, λmax = 290 nm, compared with the parent compound, all-trans-retinol (λmax = 325 nm), and its MS analysis (m/z = 288) indicates saturation of a double bond. The product was further identified as all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol, since its characteristics were identical to those of a synthetic standard. Mouse RetSat is membrane-associated and expressed in many tissues, with the highest levels in liver, kidney, and intestine. All-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol was also detected in several tissues of animals maintained on a normal diet. Thus, saturation of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol by RetSat produces a new metabolite of yet unknown biological function.

Retinoids are essential for many important biological functions, such as development, immunity, cellular differentiation, and vision of vertebrates.

Given the low levels and labile nature of retinoids in biological systems and the incompletely understood mechanism of their biotransformations, many of the enzymes involved in retinoid metabolism remain to be discovered. In addition to dietary sources, retinoids are derived from the cleavage of C40 provitamin A carotenoids such as α- and β-carotene and cryptoxanthin to produce retinal, which can be converted to all-trans-retinol. Provitamin A carotenoids also represent a major storage form of retinoids in tissues, serum, and the vertebrate egg yolk. Only two enzymes involved in the metabolism of β-carotene in animals have been identified: β,β-carotene-15,15′-monooxygenase (BCO-I) (20von Lintig J. Dreher A. Kiefer C. Wernet M.F. Vogt K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1130-1135PubMed Google Scholar), which carries out the symmetric cleavage of β-carotene to produce retinal, and β,β-carotene-9′,10′-oxygenase (BCO-II), which carries out the asymmetric cleavage to generate β-ionone and β-apo-10′-carotenal (21Kiefer C.

BCO-I and -II have sequence similarity to VP14, the 9-cis-neoxanthin cleavage enzyme from Zea mais, and other carotenoid cleavage enzymes from plants (reviewed in Ref. 22Giuliano G. Al-Babili S. von Lintig J. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 145-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). BCO-I was first identified in flies based on its similarity to VP14 (20von Lintig J. Dreher A. Kiefer C. Wernet M.F. Vogt K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Other, more limited dietary sources of retinoids are all-trans-retinyl esters and free all-trans-retinol. In addition to β-carotene, retinal, and retinoic acid, animal tissues also retain considerable amounts of nonprovitamin A carotenoids such as lutein and zeaxanthin in the primate macula and lycopene in serum and most tissues. Nonprovitamin A carotenoids as well as uncleaved β-carotene have been implicated in the prevention of cancer, macular degeneration, and heart disease (reviewed in Refs. 25Snodderly D.M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1995; 62: 1448S-1461SCrossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar and 26Fraser P.D. Bramley P.M. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 228-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Despite this interest, the enzymes involved in the metabolism and physiology of carotenoids in animals await molecular identification. Powerful genetic approaches and readily identifiable phenotypes aided in the discovery of the biochemical pathways of carotenoid synthesis in plants and bacteria. These enzymes could serve as a model to uncover carotenoid or retinoid enzymes in vertebrates. Recently, the enzymes responsible for the isomerization of (7Z,9Z,9′Z,7′Z)-tetra-cis-lycopene (also known as prolycopene) to all-trans-lycopene in plants (27Park H. Kreunen S.S. Cuttriss A.J.

Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 427-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Tomato CRTISO mutants are known for their tangerine phenotype due to accumulation of (7Z,9Z,9′Z,7′Z)-tetra-cis-lycopene (32Zechmeister L. LeRosen A.L. Went F.W. Pauling L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1941; 21: 468-474Crossref Google Scholar). The protein sequences of CRTISO enzymes are similar to CrtI from nonphotosynthetic bacteria, an enzyme that catalyzes the direct conversion of phytoene into all-trans-lycopene (33Giuliano G. Pollock D. Scolnik P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12925-12929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It also bears resemblance to phytoene desaturase and ζ-carotene desaturase from plants, which each introduce two double bonds during the four desaturation steps from phytoene to (7Z,9Z,9′Z,7′Z)-tetra-cis-lycopene (trans-H elimination at 11,11′ by phytoene desaturase and cis-H elimination at 7,7′ by ζ-carotene desaturase) (reviewed in Ref. 34Sandmann G. Physiol. Plant. 2002; 116: 431-440Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Searching for homologous proteins using the protein sequences of plant CRTISO, we found similarities in a few hypothetical proteins predicted by the conceptual translation of expressed sequence tags and transcripts from vertebrates and nonvertebrates. Expression of the mouse CRTISO-like protein in transfected cells revealed that it catalyzes saturation of all-trans-retinol at the 13–14 double bond, and the mouse CRTISO-like protein was thus designated RetSat. This is in contrast to tomato CRTISO, which catalyzes cis-trans isomerization of lycopene and has no saturase activity versus all-trans-retinol. Moreover, the saturated product, all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol, is detected in several tissues of animals maintained on a diet containing normal levels of vitamin A. Cloning of Mouse and Monkey RetSat and Tomato CRTISO and Creation of Stable Cell Lines with Inducible Expression—RPE was microdissected from a C57/BL6 mouse or macaque crab-eating monkey (Macaca fascicularis). RNA from mouse or monkey RPE and from ripe, red tomato was isolated using the MicroAqueous RNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and reverse-transcribed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mouse RetSat cDNA was amplified using Hotstart Turbo Pfu Polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the primers 5′-ATGTGGATCACTGCTCTGCTGCTGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCTGGCTCTTCTCTGAACGGACTACATC-3′ (reverse); monkey RetSat was amplified with primers 5′-CAGTCGGAGCTGTCCCATTTACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAATTCCTCTGACTCCTCCCTGATG-3′ (reverse); tomato CRTISO was amplified using the primers 5′-CTTTCCAGGGAGCCCAAAAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACATCTAGATATCATGCTAGTGTCCTT-3′ (reverse). For expression of mouse RetSat, cDNA was amplified with the primers 5′-CCTCTAGAGCCACCATGTGGATCACTGCTCTGCTGCTGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACTAGTCTACATCTTCTTCTTTTGTGCCTTGACCTTTGA-3′ (reverse) and cloned into the tetracycline-inducible, eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen) using XbaI/SpeI, whereas tomato CRTISO was amplified using the primers 5′-TCTAGAAGGAGGACAGCAATGGTAGATGTAGACAAAAGAGTGGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACATCTAGATATCATGCTAGTGTCCTT-3′ (reverse) and cloned into the XbaI site of pcDNA4/TO. N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase I-negative HEK293S cells, obtained from Dr. G. Khorana (MIT, Boston, MA), were transfected with the tetR expression plasmid pcDNA6-TR(blaR), and blasticidin-resistant colonies were selected and cloned. A stable tetR-expressing clone of HEK-293S designated HEK-Khorana (HEKK) was then transfected with pcDNA4/TO (zeoR) containing either mouse RetSat or tomato CRTISO cDNA and selected with zeocin. All zeocin-resistant clones were pooled and used in activity assays. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum plus zeocin and blasticidin antibiotics and maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity. Inducible Expression of LRAT Protein in HEKK Cells—Mouse LRAT cDNA was cloned as described elsewhere (2Batten M.L. Imanishi Y. Maeda T. Tu D.C. Moise A.R. Bronson D. Possin D. Van Gelder R.N.

For expression, LRAT coding region was amplified using the primers 5′-GCCACCATGAAGAACCCAATGCTGGAAGCT-3′ and ACATACACGTTGACCTGTGGACTG. The PCR product was ligated into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into the EcoRI site of pcDNA4/TO. TetR-expressing HEKK cells were transfected with the pcDNA4/TO-LRAT construct and selected with zeocin. Stable clones were verified for expression of LRAT protein using the anti-LRAT monoclonal antibody described elsewhere (2Batten M.L. Imanishi Y. Maeda T. Tu D.C. Moise A.R. Bronson D. Possin D.

Purification of a Bacterially Expressed His-tagged Mouse RetSat Fragment, Polyclonal and Monoclonal Antibody Production—The NcoI fragment of RetSat cDNA, corresponding to nucleotides 440–1391 of mouse RetSat cDNA (coding for the 148MASPF... MTALVPM465 polypeptide fragment) was cloned into the NcoI site of the inducible bacterial expression vector pET30B (Invitrogen). This resulted in a recombinant protein tagged at both amino and carboxyl termini with hexahistidine tags. The plasmid was transformed into BL-21RP cells (Stratagene), and expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The double His6-tagged fragment of the mouse RetSat protein (40 kDa) was purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity using the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The purified protein was examined by gel electrophoresis. Following in-gel trypsin digestion, the eluted tryptic peptides were examined by microsequencing by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry to verify the identity of the recombinant RetSat fragment (not shown). The purified protein was used to immunize mice as described before (35Haeseleer F. Jang G.F. Imanishi Y. Driessen C.A. Matsumura M. Nelson P.S. Palczewski K. J. Biol.

Hargrave P.A. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1989; 25: 1141-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum was raised in collaboration with Cocalico Biologicals Inc. (Reamstown, PA). The sera and monoclonal antibody were tested for their specificity by immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting of RetSat-transfected versus untransfected cells. Anti-RetSat IgG was purified from the ascitic supernatant of RetSat-producing hybridoma cells using a HiTRAP protein G HP (Amersham Biosciences), using the manufacturer's protocol. The purified antibody was coupled with fluorophore using the Alexa Fluor 488 monoclonal antibody coupling kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Northern Blot Analysis of Mouse RetSat Transcripts—Northern blot analysis was performed using a commercially available premade blot containing 2 μg of poly(A) RNA from various mouse tissues per lane (FirstChoice Northern blot Mouse Blot I; Ambion) following the manufacturer's protocol. The α-32P-radiolabeled probe was constructed by run-off PCR of mouse RetSat cDNA using the 5′-TCTGGCTCTTCTCTGAACGGACTACATC-3′ reverse primer and the Strip-EZ probe synthesis kit from Ambion following the manufacturer's protocol. Alternatively, a radiolabeled antisense mouse beta-actin probe was constructed using the T7 primer and the pTRIamp18 β-actin template (Ambion). Immunoblotting and Immunohistochemistry Analysis of Mouse RetSat—To establish the membrane association of RetSat, mouse liver was homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) using a Dounce homogenizer. The nuclei and extracellular matrix were pelleted by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 × g and discarded. The high speed cytosolic supernatant and postnuclear membranes were separated by centrifugation at 145,000 × g for 90 min. Postnuclear membranes were homogenized in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein concentration was measured in whole cell lysate, high speed cytosolic supernatant, and postnuclear membrane fraction using the Bradford assay (37Bradford M.M. Anal.

Equal amounts of protein were resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-RetSat monoclonal antibody and 1:104 goat anti-mouse IgG (Fc) (Promega, Madison, WI). To examine tissue-specific expression of RetSat, various mouse tissues were dissected and homogenized with 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, with the aid of a Dounce homogenizer. The membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein (10 μg) from the membrane fraction of each tissue were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained by immunoblotting with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-RetSat polyclonal antiserum and alkaline phosphatase-coupled 1/104 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Fc) (Promega) secondary antibody. The mouse monoclonal anti-RetSat showed the same reactivity in the examined tissues as the polyclonal antiserum. Untransfected HEKK or HEKK-RetSat cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) on glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA). Expression of RetSat was induced by the addition of 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Cells were harvested after 48 h and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Fisher, Hampton, NH) in PBS (136 mm NaCl, 11.4 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) for 10 min and washed by PBS. To block nonspecific labeling, the cells were incubated in 1.5% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) in PBST (136 mm NaCl, 11.4 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C in Alexa 488-coupled anti-RetSat monoclonal IgG diluted with PBST. The sections were rinsed in PBST and mounted in 50 μl of 2% 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane (Sigma) in 90% glycerol to retard photobleaching. For confocal imaging, the cells were analyzed on a Zeiss LSM510 laser-scanning microscope. Retinol Isomer Purification and HPLC Analysis of Retinoids—All procedures involving retinoids were performed under dim red light unless otherwise specified. Retinoids were stored in N,N-dimethylformamide under argon at -80°C. All retinol and retinal substrates were purified by normal phase HPLC (Beckman Ultrasphere-Si, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) with 10% ethyl acetate, 90% hexane at a flow rate of 1.4 ml/min using an HP1100 high performance liquid chromatograph with a diode-array detector and HP Chemstation A 08.03 software. For all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol, we used an extinction coefficient ϵ = 16,500 at 290 nm. The following extinction coefficients were used for retinoids (in m-1 cm-1): all-trans-retinol, ϵ = 51,770 at 325 nm; 9-cis-retinol, ϵ = 42,300 at 323 nm; 11-cis-retinol, ϵ = 34,320 at 318 nm; 13-cis-retinol, ϵ = 48,305 at 328 nm; all-trans-retinal, ϵ = 48,000 at 368 nm in hexane (38Garwin G.G. Saari J.C. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 313-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and all-trans-retinoic acid, ϵ = 45,300 at 350 nm in ethanol. Retinoic acid was dissolved in ethanol and examined by a reverse-phase HPLC System II (Zorbax ODS, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm; Agilent, Foster City, CA) with an isocratic mobile phase of 70% acetonitrile, 29% water, 1% glacial acetic acid and flow rate of 1.4 ml/min. (7Z,9Z,9′Z,7′Z)-Tetra-cis-lycopene Purification and Reverse-phase HPLC Analysis of Carotenoids—Carotenoid extraction and analysis were performed under dim red light. One g from the fruit of a tangerine tomato was freeze-thawed three times and extracted with 2 ml of PBS, 2 ml of ethanol, and 6 ml of hexane with the aid of a Dounce homogenizer. The organic phase was dried and resuspended in ethanol/tetrahydrofuran (9:1) and examined by reverse-phase HPLC System I (Prontosil, 200-3-C30, 3 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm; Bischoff Chromatography, Leonberg, Germany) with a mobile phase of 75% tert-butyl methyl ether, 25% methanol and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. More than 90% of the extract consisted of (7Z,9Z,9′Z,7′Z)-tetra-cis-lycopene, which was identified based on its published UV-visible absorption spectrum in hexane (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) with the following characteristics: shoulder at λ = 417 nm, ϵ = 90,000 m-1 cm-1, λmax = 437 nm, ϵ = 105,000 m-1 cm-1, shoulder at λ = 461 nm, ϵ = 70,000 m-1 cm-1. Enzyme Assays of RetSat- and CRTISO-catalyzed Reactions—For enzyme assay, cells were seeded in 6-well plates, and expression of RetSat or CRTISO was induced with 1 μg/ml tetracycline 48 h prior to analysis. Substrate preparation and addition were conducted under dim red light. Retinoid substrates were purified by HPLC as described above and dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide to a final concentration of 4 mm. Organic extract of tangerine tomatoes was dried under a stream of argon and resuspended in N,N-dimethylformamide. The substrates were diluted in 300 μl of complete medium (tetracycline, 1 μg/ml) to a 40 μm final concentration, overlaid on cells, and incubated overnight in the dark at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 100% humidity. Media and cells were collected by scraping and mixed with an equal volume of methanol. For retinol and dihydroretinol analysis, the methanol/water mixture was extracted with two volumes of hexane, and then the organic phase was dried, resuspended in hexane, and analyzed by normal phase HPLC. Retinal and dihydroretinal analysis was performed by treatment of the methanol/water mixture with 12.5 mm hydroxylamine followed by organic extraction and normal phase HPLC. For carotenoid analysis, the organic phase was dried and resuspended in ethanol/tetrahydrofuran (9:1) and examined by reverse-phase HPLC System I. For retinoic acid analysis, the 1:1 methanol/water mixture was acidified with 0.1 volumes of 12 n HCl and extracted with 1 volume of chloroform, dried, and resuspended in ethanol and examined by reverse-phase HPLC System II. Chemical Synthesis of All-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol—All reagents were purchased from Sigma or Fluka and were used without additional purification. Solvents were dried under standard procedures prior to use. All operations with retinoids were performed under dim red light unless otherwise specified. β-Ionone was condensed with triethyl phosphonoacetate in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran in the presence of NaH to give ethyl trans-β-ionylideneacetate. This ester was then reduced with LiAlH4 to alcohol and reacted overnight with triphenylphosphine hydrobromide to give Wittig salt. Ethyl 4-oxo-3-methylcrotonate was hydrogenated in methanol with H2 using 10% palladium on carbon as a catalyst to yield ethyl 4-oxo-3-methylbutyrate, which was then reacted with Wittig salt using t-BuOK as a base in anhydrous CH2Cl2 in the presence of 18-crown-6. The obtained mixture of ethyl 11-cis- and all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinoates was reduced with LiAlH4 to 13,14-dihydroretinols, and all-trans-isomer was separated from 11-cis-dihydroretinol by flash chromatography of silica gel using 5% ethyl acetate in hexane. NMR data were recorded on a Bruker 500-MHz spectrometer using CDCl3 as an internal standard. 1H NMR analysis of synthetic all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol: NMR (CDCl3, δ, ppm) 6.41 (dd, 1H, H-12, J = 11.3, 14.75 Hz), 6.10–6.12 (m, 3H, H-7, H-8, H-10, J = 15.7 Hz), 5.6 (dd, 1H, H-11, J = 8.34, 14.95 Hz), 3.67 (m, 2H, CH2-15), 2.41 (m, 1H, H-13, J = 6.7 Hz), 1.96 (m, 2H, CH2-14), 1.90 (s, 3H, CH3-9), 1.69 (s, 3H, CH3-5), 1.46 (m, 2H, CH2-2), 1.6 (m, 4H, CH2-3, CH2-4), 1.06 (d, 3H, CH3-13 J = 6.7 Hz), 1.00 (s, 6H, 2× CH3-1). Isomerization and Electron Impact Mass Spectrometry Analysis of All-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol—Equal amounts (by UV absorbance) of the synthetic and biosynthetic compounds were resuspended in ethanol and exposed to sunlight for 30 min, followed by the addition of an equal volume of water and two volumes of hexane. The compounds were extracted, the organic phase was dried and resuspended in hexane, and the isomeric mixture was examined by normal phase HPLC. For MS analysis, the unknown biosynthetic metabolite and the chemically synthesized all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol were purified by normal phase HPLC and analyzed by electron impact mass spectrometry analysis using a JEOL HX-110 direct probe mass spectrometer. Some of the ions in the fragmentation patterns of both samples were as follows: 288 [M]+, 273 [M-CH3]+, 243 [M-CH2CH2OH]+, 215 [M-CH(Me)(CH2)2OH]+, 202, 187, 159.

The latter can be defined as death of cells containing autophagosomes, autophagic bodies, and/or vacuoles. Are autophagy and vacuolization causes, consequences, or side effects in cell death with autophagy? Would control of autophagy suffice to control this type of cell death? We disrupted the atg1 autophagy gene in Dictyostelium discoideum, a genetically tractable model for developmental autophagic vacuolar cell death. The procedure that induced autophagy, vacuolization, and death in wild-type cells led in atg1 mutant cells to impaired autophagy and to no vacuolization, demonstrating that atg1 is required for vacuolization. Unexpectedly, however, cell death still took place, with a non-vacuolar and centrally condensed morphology. Thus, a cell death mechanism that does not require vacuolization can operate in this cell death model showing conspicuous vacuolization. The revelation of non-vacuolar cell death in this protist by autophagy gene disruption is reminiscent of caspase inhibition revealing necrotic cell death in animal cells.

Three main forms of cell death have been described, caspase-dependent apoptosis, and caspase-independent necrosis autophagic/vacuolar cell death. The latter, also called Type II cell death, can be operationally defined as the death of cells containing autophagosomes, autophagic bodies, and/or vacuoles. Numerous instances of autophagic/vacuolar cell death have long been known (1Schweichel J.-U. Merker H.-J. Teratology. 1973; 7: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 2Clarke P.G.H. Anat.

Yoshimori T. Cell Struct. Funct. 2002; 27: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Outside the cell death field, autophagy is induced, for instance, by starvation (15Dunn Jr., W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1923-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 16Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 17Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar). Autophagy helps ensure, at least for some time, the survival of cells deprived of extracellular nutrients or encumbered with aggregates of polyglutamine proteins (18Ravikumar B. Vacher C. Berger Z. Davies J.E. Luo S. Oroz L.G. Scaravilli F. Easton D.F. Duden R. O'Kane C.J. Rubinsztein D.C. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar). The relationship between autophagy and autophagic/vacuolar cell death is not completely clear. How to reconcile the role of autophagy in ensuring cell survival and its apparent role within a mechanism of cell death? A possibility is that autophagy leads to the disappearance of crucial cellular organelles, resulting in death. Thus, when some cells were induced to undergo cell death in the presence of caspase inhibitors and then returned to normal conditions, they survived for several days, but during this period their mitochondria disappeared. Bcl2 overexpression blocked this removal of mitochondria (19Tolkovsky A.M. Xue L. Fletcher G.C. Borutaite V. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Perhaps related, autophagic stimulation of rat hepatocytes by serum deprivation and glucagon (1 m) caused an increase of spontaneously depolarizing mitochondria, which moved into acidic vacuoles (20Elmore S.P. Qian T. Grissom S.F. Lemasters J.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2286-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Alternatively, autophagy may be irrelevant to the mechanism of death proper but instead be a consequence, perhaps aiming at clearing dead cell remains as effected by engulfment in other circumstances. In short, it is often not clear whether autophagy is a cause, a consequence, or an irrelevant side effect of autophagic mammalian cell death. A point at stake is whether control of autophagy in cells would help control some types of programmed cell death, for instance in pathological circumstances. Although classical biological models of cell death have provided invaluable information, especially on mechanisms of apoptosis, alternative models might provide further information, in particular on non-apoptotic cell death mechanisms (21Golstein P. Aubry L. Levraud J.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 798-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Specifically, questions on autophagic/vacuolar cell death could be explored in Dictyostelium (22Levraud J.-P. Adam M. Luciani M.-F. De Chastellier C. Blanton R.L. Golstein P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or Podospora (23Pinan-Lucarre B. Paoletti M. Dementhon K. Coulary-Salin B. Clave C. Mol.

Cell. 2003; 2: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The Dictyostelium HMX44A cell line could be induced to undergo as a monolayer (25Kay R.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 433-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) autophagic vacuolar cell death (22Levraud J.-P. Adam M. Luciani M.-F. De Chastellier C. Blanton R.L. Golstein P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Cornillon S. Foa C. Davoust J. Buonavista N. Gross J.D. Golstein P. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2691-2704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a caspase- and paracaspase-independent manner (27Olie R.A. Durrieu F. Cornillon S. Loughran G. Gross J. Earnshaw W.C. Golstein P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 955-958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Roisin-Bouffay C. Luciani M.F. Klein G. Levraud J.P. Adam M. Golstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11489-11494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the course of this monolayer cell death, believed to mimic Dictyostelium developmental cell death (29Whittingham W.F. Raper K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1960; 46: 642-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cells undergo a paddle cell stage, round up through actin depolymerization while acquiring a cellulose shell, and develop a large vacuole that occupies most of the cell volume. Finally, their cytoplasmic membrane ruptures (22Levraud J.-P. Adam M. Luciani M.-F. De Chastellier C. Blanton R.L. Golstein P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Cornillon S. Foa C. Davoust J. Buonavista N. Gross J.D. Golstein P. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2691-2704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of Dictyostelium cell death in this monolayer system requires both starvation and addition of differentiation-inducing factor (DIF), 1The abbreviations used are: DIF, differentiation-inducing factor; atg1-, bearing a disruption of the autophagy gene 1; SB, Soerensen buffer; nt, nucleotide. a small dichlorinated molecule that is a main natural morphogen in Dictyostelium (25Kay R.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 433-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although other strains produce DIF upon starvation, HMX44A cells produce very little DIF and thus require addition of exogenous DIF for differentiation. Using this strain thus allows us to investigate the respective roles of starvation and DIF in cell death (25Kay R.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 433-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Adding only DIF, in rich medium, has no detectable effect. Applying only starvation does not lead to vacuolar cell death while triggering autophagy, showing that autophagy is not sufficient to lead to cell death in this system (26Cornillon S. Foa C. Davoust J. Buonavista N. Gross J.D. Golstein P. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2691-2704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of DIF, is starvation required because autophagy is required, or is starvation required for a reason other than autophagy? Is autophagy necessary at all in this autophagic vacuolar cell death? The occurrence and the course of autophagy are governed by a number of genes studied mostly in yeast but conserved throughout the eukaryotes (17Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D.

Shuman H.A. Kessin R.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These genes are now referred to as atg for autophagy-related genes (33Klionsky D.J. Cregg J.M. Dunn Jr., W.A. Emr S.D. Sakai Y. Sandoval I.V. Sibirny A. Subramani S. Thumm M. Veenhuis M. Ohsumi Y. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 539-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). In yeast, the protein kinase Atg1 is believed to play a role in early events of autophagosome formation (see Ref. 35Abeliovich H. Zhang C. Dunn Jr., W.A. Shokat K.M. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar and references therein). We inactivated by homologous recombination the atg1 gene in Dictyostelium strain HMX44A cells and studied the impact of this inactivation on the cell death process. We found that autophagy was decreased and vacuolization was suppressed, but unexpectedly cell death still took place, with a different, “centrally condensed” morphotype. This demonstrated the existence of a cell death mechanism in Dictyostelium that did not require vacuolization. Also, the autophagy gene inactivation leading to condensed cell death described in this report is curiously similar to the previously reported inhibition of apoptosis leading to necrotic cell death (36Vercammen D.

Cells, Cell Culture, and Microscopy—For cell death induction, unless stated otherwise Dictyostelium vegetative cells in growth phase were washed once and resuspended in HL5 medium at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml. One ml of this cell suspension was distributed in each well of Lab-Tek culture chambers (155380; Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL). After overnight incubation, HL5 was discarded, and each well received 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6.7 (Soerensen buffer, SB) containing 3 mm cAMP. After 8 h of incubation at 22 °C in SB and cAMP, cells were washed once in SB and incubated at 22 °C in either SB or SB in the presence of the differentiation factor DIF-1 (D-3450; Interchim, Montluçon, France) at a final concentration of 10-7m. Further details on Dictyostelium strains, culture, microscopy and image processing, double labeling with phalloidin and CMXRos, simple labeling with calcofluor, fluorescein diacetate, or propidium iodide, electron microscopy methods, and evaluation of cell regrowth have been previously described (22Levraud J.-P.

Cells were stained with 10 μg/ml acridine orange (A-6014; Sigma) or with 20 μg/ml Bodipy 493/503 (D-3922; Molecular Probes) for 30 min, washed, and left in SB for 30 min and then observed using a fluorescein filter, or with 40 nm Dioc6(3) (D273; Molecular Probes) for 15 min, washed, and then observed using a fluorescein filter, or with 2.5 μg/ml Nile Red (N-3013; Sigma) in buffer (50 mm trizma, pH 7.5, (T4628; Sigma), containing 20 mg/ml of polyvinylpyrrolidone, WT 40,000, (PVP-40; Sigma)) for 5 min, and observed using a fluorescein filter without removing the staining buffer, or with 10 μm Lysosensor Yellow/Blue (DND-160; Molecular Probes) for 3 min, washed in SB, and examined using a DAPI filter for a very short time because of marked cell destruction under fluorescent light. atg1 Gene Inactivation by Homologous Recombination—The homologous recombination constructs for the deletion allele atg1–2 included 5′ and 3′ arms obtained separately by PCR from genomic DNA. Restriction sites were generated at the ends of the PCR products by inclusion of appropriate sequences in the primers. For the atg1–2 deletion (302 bp), the 5′ arm (1082 bp) was from nt -673 to nt +409, and the 3′ arm (963 bp) from nt +712 to nt +1675 of the atg1 gene. The 5′ and 3′ arms were used as templates within the same PCR reactions to obtain a 2045-bp sequence. This sequence was ligated into pGEM-T Easy (Promega). The blasticidin resistance cassette was removed from pBSR519 with BamHI and cloned into the BamHI site of the above sequence. The resulting deletion construct and the previously obtained insertion construct (40Otto G.P. Wu M.Y. Kazgan N. Anderson O.R. Kessin R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15621-15629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) were used for electroporation. Transformants were cloned the next day and selected with blasticidin (10 μg/ml) in HL5 medium for 10 days. Transformants were screened by PCR for homologous recombination of the insertion or deletion constructs with the endogenous atg1 locus. For Northern blot analysis, cells were deposited on nitrocellulose filters under starvation conditions for development, and the filters were harvested after 8 h for RNA extraction. Total RNA (5 μg) of each cell type was size-fractionated on a 1.2% agarose gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and hybridized with a random primer-labeled DNA probe. Transfections for Complementation or Dominant Negative—The CFP-Atg1 expression vector was described previously (40Otto G.P. Wu M.Y. Kazgan N. Anderson O.R. Kessin R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15621-15629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For the Atg1 expression vector, the atg1 insert was extracted from pDXA-CFP-Atg1 with SacI and ligated into a SacI-digested pDneo2 vector. Expression of both CFP-Atg1 and Atg1 was driven by an actin 15 promoter. 20 μg of construct DNA was electroporated in HMX44A or HMX44A.atg1–1 cells. Selection was with neomycin (20–40 μg/ml). Insertional Disruption of the atg1 Gene in Dictyostelium HMX44A Cells Abolished Vacuolization, but Not Cell Death— When HMX44A cells were incubated in starvation medium, but in the absence of exogenous DIF, they flattened and did not die (Fig. 1A). If DIF was added, they underwent a programmed sequence of cell death events (22Levraud J.-P. Adam M. Luciani M.-F. De Chastellier C. Blanton R.L. Golstein P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Cornillon S. Foa C. Davoust J. Buonavista N. Gross J.D. Golstein P. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2691-2704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including differentiation into paddle cells (Fig. 1B, 16 h), rounding, vacuolization (Fig. 1B, 40–64 h), and membrane rupture (22Levraud J.-P.

We disrupted the atg1 autophagy gene in HMX44A cells using a previously described insertion construct (40Otto G.P. Wu M.Y. Kazgan N. Anderson O.R. Kessin R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15621-15629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The corresponding mutant cells are designated throughout as HMX44A.atg1–1 or atg1–1. Upon starvation without addition of exogenous DIF, HMX44A.atg1–1 cells adopted a round shape (Fig. 1D and Fig. 2) and showed the expected (40Otto G.P. Wu M.Y. Kazgan N. Anderson O.R. Kessin R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15621-15629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) impaired autophagy compared with HMX44A wild-type cells. The latter showed yellow-green dots when stained with Lysosensor Yellow Blue and bright orange dots when stained with acridine orange (Fig. 2, A and B), which are believed to represent acidic vacuoles (41Padh H. Lavasa M. Steck T.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 42Harris E. Wang N. Wu W. Weatherford A. De Lozanne A. Cardelli J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 656-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Also, upon staining with Bodipy 493/503 or with Nile Red, bright yellow dots could be seen (Fig. 2, C and D), which are believed to label lipidic bodies appearing upon stress (43Greenspan P. Mayer E.P. Fowler S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar, 44Al-Saffar N.M. Titley J.C. Robertson D. Clarke P.A. Jackson L.E. Leach M.O. Ronen S.M. Br. J. Cancer. 2002; 86: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). All of these stained small acidic vacuoles or lipidic bodies were less numerous in HMX44A.atg1–1 cells (Fig. 2, E–H). Also, most of the electron microscopy sections of starved cells showed at least one large autophagosome for HMX44A cells and none for HMX44A.atg1–1 cells (Fig. 2, I and J). Although these data show altered autophagy, it is difficult to assess whether in these cells autophagy is only partially or fully impaired. In the presence of DIF and in contrast to wild-type cells, the atg1–1 cells did not show any vacuolization (Fig. 1D) even after 96 h in DIF (not shown). We infer from these results that atg1 gene disruption suppresses vacuolization. We do not know whether this is through impaired autophagy. Although not vacuolizing, atg1–1 cells subjected to both starvation and DIF nevertheless died. Not only were they round, but they also showed central condensation (Fig. 1D), giving them a characteristic “fried egg” appearance. With time, these cells tended to swell, and finally their external membrane ruptured (Fig. 1D and not shown). To further study the relationships between atg1, vacuolization, and cell death, we created an atg1 deletion mutant in HMX44A cells that we call atg1–2 (Fig. 3A). This new mutant showed the same cell death mutant phenotype as did the original insertion mutant, with no vacuolization and with central condensation of organelles (Fig. 3C). The insertion is in the 9th of the 11 subdomains of the atg1 catalytic protein kinase domain as defined in the homologous yeast atg1 (45Matsuura A. Tsukada M. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Gene. 1997; 192: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The deletion removes three such subdomains, including two conserved residues whose mutation abolishes the protein kinase activity (45Matsuura A. Tsukada M. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Gene. 1997; 192: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The same non-vacuolar cell death pattern was also observed (not shown) in monolayer tests of the previously obtained atg1–1 insertion mutant in strain DH1 (40Otto G.P. Wu M.Y. Kazgan N. Anderson O.R. Kessin R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15621-15629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Non-vacuolar cell death was thus observed in two strain backgrounds and with two distinct atg1 inactivation constructs. In addition, transformation of HMX44A cells with the previously described CFP-Atg1 expression vector (40Otto G.P. Wu M.Y. Kazgan N. Anderson O.R. Kessin R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15621-15629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), but not with an Atg1 expression vector, led to a very similar phenotype of non-vacuolar cell death (Fig. 3C), most probably through a dominant negative effect of CFP-Atg1 in this case. These multiple independent instances of atg1 alteration abolishing vacuolization, but not cell death, strongly indicated an atg1 requirement for vacuolization. Furthermore, transformation with an Atg1 expression vector of the atg1–1 insertion mutant led to mutant complementation, namely recovery of the usual vacuolar pattern of Dictyostelium cell death (Fig. 3C). The identity of, in particular, the dominant negative and the complemented cells was counterchecked by PCR (Fig. 3D) and resistance to blasticidin and/or neomycin (not shown). Complementation formally demonstrated that atg1 is required for vacuolization. Importantly, in all these experiments DIF addition induced death of both wild-type and atg1 mutant starved cells. The state of atg1 affected the morphology (with vacuoles or with central condensation), not the occurrence, of this DIF-induced cell death. General Features of Non-vacuolar atg1–1 Mutant Cell Death—A closer examination of dying atg1–1 cells by differential interference contrast microscopy (Fig. 4A) and electron microscopy (Fig. 4B) showed that central condensation reflected clustering of cell organelles, including the nucleus, in the central region of cells. The nucleus did not show obvious condensation or fragmentation at these stages (Fig. 4, B and D). Staining with the mitochondrial stains CmxRos or Dioc6(3) further highlighted the concentration of organelles toward the center of cells (Fig. 4C). Perinuclear clustering of mitochondria has been reported in several instances of cell signaling often leading to death and/or involving alterations of the cytoskeleton (46De Vos K. Goossens V.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 5612-5620Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In many of these cells, peripheral staining with phalloidin was observed concentric to the central CmxRos-stained condensation, suggesting the presence of peripheral F-actin (Fig. 4C). Starvation conditions alone led to rupture of cytoplasmic membranes in a small proportion of cells (Fig. 1C). This occurred significantly earlier and at higher frequency in the presence of DIF (Fig. 1D), as confirmed by time lapse video microscopy (not shown). Although many cells with central condensation were initially viable as measured by fluorescein diacetate labeling, with time an increasing proportion of these cells showed nuclear staining by propidium iodide (Fig. 4D), indicative of membrane rupture. Some dying cells were calcofluor-positive (Fig. 4D), showing that atg1–1 cells could synthesize cellulose, but less efficiently than wild-type cells (22Levraud J.-P. Adam M. Luciani M.-F. De Chastellier C. Blanton R.L. Golstein P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Non-vacuolar cell death was quantified through 1) an increase in percentage of propidium iodide-positive cells (Table I), 2) a decrease in numbers of plaque-forming cells on bacterial lawns (not shown), 3) a decrease in cell numbers upon regrowth as cell populations in rich medium (Table II), and 4) a decrease in the numbers of clone-forming cells in limiting dilution tests in rich medium (not shown). Of note, in each of these tests using either cell membrane rupture or loss of clonogenicity as cell death criteria, DIF induced cell death in both starved wild-type cells with vacuolization and atg1–1 cells without vacuolization, and the proportions of dead cells were similar. Also, membrane permeabilization was similarly delayed compared with growth inhibition in both the vacuolar death of HMX44A cells (22Levraud J.-P. Adam M. Luciani M.-F. De Chastellier C. Blanton R.L.

The main difference between death of wild-type or atg1–1 cells was not the proportions or kinetics of cell death but vacuolar or condensed morphology of the dying cells.Table Iatg1–1 mutant cell death measured by membrane permeabilizationExperimentIncubationIncubation conditionsaHMX44A.atg1-1 mutant cells were subjected to starvation only (SB) or to starvation in the presence of the differentiation factor DIF (SB plus DIF).

https://openalex.org/W2139834186,"In this study we investigated the physiological role of the cardiac troponin T (cTnT) isoforms in the presence of human slow skeletal troponin I (ssTnI). ssTnI is the main troponin I isoform in the fetal human heart. In reconstituted fibers containing the cTnT isoforms in the presence of ssTnI, cTnT1-containing fibers showed increased Ca2+ sensitivity of force development compared with cTnT3- and cTnT4-containing fibers. The maximal force in reconstituted skinned fibers was significantly greater for the cTnT1 (predominant fetal cTnT isoform) when compared with cTnT3 (adult TnT isoform) in the presence of ssTnI. Troponin (Tn) complexes containing ssTnI and reconstituted with cTnT isoforms all yielded different maximal actomyosin ATPase activities. Tn complexes containing cTnT1 and cTnT4 (both fetal isoforms) had a reduced ability to inhibit actomyosin ATPase activity when compared with cTnT3 (adult isoform) in the presence of ssTnI. The rate at which Ca2+ was released from site II of cTnC in the cTnI·cTnC complex (122/s) was 12.5-fold faster than for the ssTnI·cTnC complex (9.8/s). Addition of cTnT3 to the cTnI·cTnC complex resulted in a 3.6-fold decrease in the Ca2+ dissociation rate from site II of cTnC. Addition of cTnT3 to the ssTnI·cTnC complex resulted in a 1.9-fold increase in the Ca2+ dissociation rate from site II of cTnC. The rate at which Ca2+ dissociated from site II of cTnC in Tn complexes also depended on the cTnT isoform present. However, the TnI isoforms had greater effects on the Ca2+ dissociation rate of site II than the cTnT isoforms. These results suggest that the different N-terminal TnT isoforms would produce distinct functional properties in the presence of ssTnI when compared with cTnI and that each isoform would have a specific physiological role in cardiac muscle.

The expression level of the main fetal isoform, TnT isoform 1 (cTnT1), decreases and the expression of TnT isoform 3 (cTnT3) increases until cTnT3 becomes the only TnT isoform in the normal adult heart. Because TnT is one of the major regulatory proteins in the thin filament (3Zot A.S. Potter J.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 16: 535-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), isoform switching of TnT during heart development may be important in the Ca2+ regulation of myocardial contraction. Recently, we have shown that the human cTnT isoforms affect the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development and their ability to inhibit actomyosin ATPase activity in the presence of human cardiac troponin I (cTnI) (4Gomes A.V. Guzman G. Zhao J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35341-35349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Other groups have also shown that TnT isoforms affect the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development and ATPase activity (5Tobacman L.S. Lee R. J. Biol.

These results all suggest that the N terminus of TnT affects the physiological function of troponin (Tn). However, TnI isoforms also switch during the period of TnT isoform changes. Slow skeletal TnI (ssTnI) is the predominant TnI isoform throughout fetal life and gradually decreases during the first few months of postnatal development (10Sasse S. Brand N.J. Kyprianou P. Dhoot G.K. Wade R. Arai M. Periasamy M. Yacoub M.H. Barton P.J. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 932-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Developmental down-regulation of ssTnI occurs even in the absence of cTnI. Mice lacking cTnI are born healthy, with normal heart and body weight, because ssTnI (the fetal troponin I isoform) compensates for the absence of cTnI until 15 days after birth when ssTnI expression declines steadily, resulting in TnI deficiency and death on day 18 (11Huang X. Pi Y. Lee K.J. Henkel A.S. Gregg R.G. Powers P.A. Walker J.W. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of cTnT isoforms in the human heart is still not well understood, and the physiological relevance of cTnT isoforms in fetal human cardiac Tn has not been investigated previously.Two recent reports (12Siedner S. Kruger M. Schroeter M. Metzler D. Roell W. Fleischmann B.K. Hescheler J. Pfitzer G. Stehle R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 548: 493-505Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 13Metzger J.M. Michele D.E.

Incorporation of embryonic/fetal isoforms of Tm, TnT, and TnI into the adult sarcomere by using gene transfer suggested that TnI, but not Tm or TnT embryonic isoforms, influenced calcium regulation of contraction (13Metzger J.M. Michele D.E. Rust E.M. Borton A.R. Westfall M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13118-13123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Another report (12Siedner S. Kruger M. Schroeter M. Metzler D. Roell W. Fleischmann B.K. Hescheler J. Pfitzer G. Stehle R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 548: 493-505Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar) correlated the switching of TnT and TnI isoforms with the Ca2+ sensitivity of force generation in mice and, based on these results, suggested that the change in Ca2+ sensitivity is mainly due to TnI isoform switching. The main goal of the present study was to gain insight into the effect of the N-terminal hypervariable region in cTnT in the presence of ssTnI (fetal TnI) on cardiac muscle contraction to determine whether the cTnT isoforms would still have a functional role in the presence of ssTnI.Three cTnT isoforms (Fig. 1) were investigated using several in vitro functional assays to determine whether any differences exist between the adult isoform (cTnT3) and the other isoforms of cTnT. In reconstituted fibers containing the cTnT isoforms in the presence of ssTnI, cTnT1 containing fibers showed increased Ca2+ sensitivity of force development (ΔpCa50 = +0.17) and maximal force compared with cTnT4 containing fibers. These results suggest that cTnT isoforms are able to modulate Ca2+ sensitivity even in the presence of ssTnI. The ability of Tn complexes to inhibit ATPase activity was significantly lower for all cTnT isoforms in the presence of ssTnI than in the presence of cTnI. The rate at which Ca2+ is released from site II of cTnC in Tn complexes was affected by both the cTnT and TnI isoforms present. cTnT had a greater effect on the kinetics of Ca2+ release from site II of cTnC in the presence of cTnI than in the presence of ssTnI. The N-terminal alternatively spliced region of cTnT also affected the solubility of cTnT. Our results suggest that this alternatively spliced N-terminal region of cTnT is an important modulator of the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development in both fetal and adult heart muscle and also affects the maximal force and the maximal and the minimal actomyosin ATPase activity. The results also suggest that the isoform of TnI present is important for some of the functional differences between the cTnT isoforms.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression and Purification of cTnT Isoforms—Human cTnT isoforms were made by using a sequential overlapping PCR method as described previously (14Ausubel F.M.

Briefly, bacterially expressed and extracted cTnTs were purified on a Fast Flow Q-Sepharose column. cTnT was eluted from this column with a NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m). The semi-purified cTnT was then further purified on a cTnC affinity column. cTnT was eluted from this column with a double gradient of urea and EDTA (0–6 m and 0–3 mm, respectively). All steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. The purity of the isolated cTnT isoforms (>95%) was determined by SDS-PAGE.Expression and Purification of ssTnI—ssTnI cDNA was cloned from a human library using standard techniques and verified by sequencing.

The semi-purified ssTnI was then further purified on a cTnC affinity column. ssTnI was eluted from this column with a double gradient of urea and EDTA (0–6 m and 0–3 mm, respectively).Formation of the Troponin Complex—Formation of the human cardiac Tn complexes containing human recombinant cTnT, cTnC, and TnI was carried by a modified method of the one recently described by Szczesna et al. (15Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Proteins were first dialyzed against a solution containing 3 m urea and 1 m KCl and then in solution containing 0 m urea and 1 m KCl. Complexes were formed in the presence of 0 m urea and 1 m KCl and then dialyzed against successively lower concentrations of KCl as described previously (15Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Proper stoichiometry was verified by SDS-PAGE. Although not done routinely, gel filtration of these formed Tn complexes showed that this reconstitution method resulted in a single species.Actin-Tm-activated Myosin-ATPase Assay—Porcine cardiac myosin, rabbit skeletal F-actin, porcine cardiac Tm, and recombinant human cardiac TnC were prepared as described previously (11Huang X. Pi Y. Lee K.J. Henkel A.S. Gregg R.G. Powers P.A. Walker J.W. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 12Siedner S. Kruger M. Schroeter M. Metzler D. Roell W.

The ATPase inhibitory assay was performed in a 1-ml reaction mixture of 100 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm ATP (Mg2+-ATP), 0.1 mm DTT, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7. The ATPase activation assay was carried out in the same 1-ml reaction mixture with 1 mm EGTA replaced with 0.5 mm CaCl2. F-actin (3.5 μm), myosin (0.6 μm), and Tm (1 μm) were homogenized and added to the reaction tube after the addition of buffer and Tn to the assay tube. Different Tn complexes were utilized including the following: complexes containing adult cTnT3 and cTnI (TnT3cIC), Tn containing cTnT1 and cTnI (TnT1cIC), Tn containing cTnT4 and cTnI (TnT4cIC), Tn containing cTnT1 and ssTnI (TnT1ssIC), Tn containing cTnT3 and ssTnI (TnT3ssIC), and Tn containing cTnT4 and ssTnI (TnT4ssIC). All Tn complexes contained cTnC. The ATPase reaction was initiated with the addition of ATP and stopped after 20 min with trichloroacetic acid (4% final concentration). After sedimenting the precipitate, the inorganic phosphate concentration in the supernatant was determined according to the method of Fiske and SubbaRow (16Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The ATPase rates were measured at 30 °C by single time points that were predetermined to be linear with time.Determination of the Ca2+Dependence of Force Development, Fiber Preparation—All skinned muscle experiments were performed with glycerinated porcine papillary muscle preparations. Hearts from newly slaughtered pigs were obtained from a nearby slaughterhouse. Strips of muscle, 3–5 millimeters (mm) in diameter and ∼5 mm in length were dissected from the papillary muscle of the left ventricle and skinned for 24 h in a 1% Triton X-100 (by volume) containing 49.5% pCa 8.0 relaxing solution (15Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Fibers were then transferred to a similar replacement solution without Triton X-100. The skinned cardiac muscle (∼120 μm in diameter) was mounted using stainless steel clips to a force transducer and immersed in a relaxation solution (pCa 8.0) containing 10–8m [Ca2+], 5 mm [Mg2+], 7 mm EGTA, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 5 mm [Mg2+-ATP], 15 mm creatine phosphate, and 20 units/ml phosphocreatine kinase and between 76 and 92 mm potassium propionate to achieve a constant ionic strength of 150 mm in all solutions (17Guth K. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13627-13635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The contraction solution (pCa 4.0) was the same composition as the pCa 8.0 solution except that the Ca2+ concentration was 10–4m and was used to measure the initial force. All fiber studies were carried out at room temperature (22 °C). To determine the dependence of force development, the contraction of skinned cardiac muscle was tested in solutions containing intermediate concentrations of Ca2+. The various pCa solutions were prepared by using the room temperature (22 °C) binding constants of Fabiato and Fabiato (18Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1978; 276: 233-255Crossref Scopus (827) Google Scholar).Treatment of the skinned fibers with 0.8 mg/ml of cTnT (isoforms 1, 3, or 4) for 2 h at room temperature (with fresh cTnT solution changed after 1 h of incubation) resulted in a loss of Ca2+ dependence of force, and the fibers became unregulated. The protein concentration of cTnT was adjusted to 0.8 mg/ml to obtain maximal displacement of Tn subunits and loss of Ca2+-regulated force. When these fibers were incubated with a preformed cTnI·cTnC or ssTnI·cTnC complex (30 μm), in relaxing solution (pCa 8), the fibers underwent a gradual relaxation as the Tn activity was reconstituted (4Gomes A.V. Guzman G. Zhao J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35341-35349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 15Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D.

Once fully relaxed (after1hof incubation with the TnI·cTnC complex), the force became entirely regulated by Ca2+.Determination of Ca2+Dissociation Rates—Ca2+ dissociation rates (koff) were measured using an Applied Photophysics Ltd. (Leatherhead, UK) model SX.18 MV stopped-flow instrument with a dead time of 1.4 ms at 15 °C. The Tn samples were excited using a 150-watt xenon arc source. koff was determined using the fluorescent Ca2+ chelator Quin-2 (19Tikunova S.B. Rall J.A. Davis J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6697-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Davis J.P. Rall J.A. Alionte C. Tikunova S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17348-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Quin-2 was excited at 330 nm with its emission monitored through a 510-nm broad bandpass interference filter (Oriel (Stratford, CT)). Each koff represents the mean of at least 21 traces fit with a single exponential, or a double exponential (variance <1.0 × 10–4) over multiple time windows leading to similar results to account for the fact that Quin-2 reports the rates of Ca2+ dissociation from both the N-(site II) and C-domain (sites III and IV) of cTnC in the TnI·cTnC and Tn complexes. The buffer used in all stopped-flow experiments was 10 mm MOPS, 195 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm Mg2+ at pH 7.0. The changes in Quin-2 fluorescence as it binds Ca2+ that dissociates from cTnC in isolation and the various complexes were converted to moles of Ca2+ dissociating from cTnC by mixing increasing concentrations of Ca2+ (0, 15, and 30 μm) with Quin-2 (21Johnson J.D. Snyder C. Walsh M. Flynn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 761-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Quin-2 fluorescence increased linearly as a function of increasing [Ca2+], allowing for a conversion of the change in Quin-2 fluorescence to the number of moles of Ca2+ dissociating per mol of cTnC. Calibration curves were performed at the end of an experiment using the same Quin-2 solutions and experimental conditions as used in the experiments. The amplitude of the change in Quin-2 fluorescence was extrapolated from the exponential fits of the data.No additional Ca2+ was added to the samples because there was enough contaminating Ca2+ in the buffers to nearly saturate the complexes. Addition of 15 or 30 μm Ca2+ to the various TnI·cTnC and Tn complexes prior to Quin-2 Ca2+ dissociation led to similar cTnC N-domain Ca2+ dissociation rates and stoichiometries. However, the addition of extra Ca2+ to the reactions abolished the ability of Quin-2 to remove Ca2+ from the C-terminal sites of cTnC in the various complexes.Solubility of cTnT Isoforms—cTnT1, cTnT3, or cTnT4 (1 ml each) at various concentrations (0.4, 0.25, and 0.1 mg/ml) were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm DTT and 1 m KCl. The cTnT isoforms were then successively dialyzed against the same buffer containing lower concentrations of KCl (0.7, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, and then 0.1 m KCl). After dialysis in buffer containing 0.1 m KCl, the cTnT isoforms were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 25 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. The total volume of the cTnT isoforms obtained after dialysis as well as the concentration of the cTnT isoforms in the supernatant after centrifugation were determined. The protein concentration was determined with the Coomassie Plus Bradford assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as standard.Data Analysis—Values are presented as mean ± S.D. The statistical significance of the differences between the mean values was analyzed by the Student's t test.RESULTSActomyosin ATPase Studies on Reconstituted Troponin Complexes Containing Different Troponin T and Troponin I Isoforms—The maximal ATPase activity for Tn complexes containing the different cTnT and cTnI isoforms in the presence of Ca2+ was similar for all the isoforms in the presence of cTnI but different in the presence of ssTnI (Fig. 2A). The myosin ATPase activity in the absence of Tn was considered to be 100% activity (0% inhibition). The ATPase activity results are presented as a bar chart so that the different cTnT and TnI combinations can be directly compared. In all experiments the amount of Tn required for maximal ATPase activation was 1 μm, which is consistent with a ratio of Tn:Tm of 1:1. The Tn complex containing cTnT3 and cTnI (TnT3cIC) showed slightly lower (but not statistically significant) maximal ATPase activity than the other Tn complexes (TnT1cIC or TnT4cIC), similar to what has been reported previously (4Gomes A.V. Guzman G. Zhao J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35341-35349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). However, a Tn complex containing cTnT1 and ssTnI (TnT1ssIC) showed a significantly higher maximal ATPase activity (175 ± 5.8%) than both TnT3ssIC (157 ± 3%) and TnT4ssIC (144 ± 5%). The maximal activity for TnT4ssIC was also significantly lower than the maximal activity of TnT4cIC (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Effect of the cTnT isoforms on the activation (+Ca2+) and inhibition (–Ca2+) of the actin-Tm-activated myosin-ATPase activity.A, activation of ATPase activity.

Although TnT3cIC and TnT4cIC were able to inhibit ATPase activity nearly fully in the presence of EGTA (∼92% at 2 μm TnT3cIC concentration), TnT1cIC was less effective at inhibiting actomyosin ATPase activity (∼ 80% at 2 μm Tn concentration), similar to what has been reported previously (Fig. 2B) (4Gomes A.V. Guzman G. Zhao J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35341-35349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of ssTnI, TnT4ssIC (47 ± 3% ATPase inhibition) was unable to inhibit the actin-Tm-activated myosin ATPase activity as well as TnT3ssIC (66 ± 1%). Complexes containing cTnI were all better at inhibiting ATPase activity than complexes containing ssTnI (Fig. 2B). cTnT4 had similar inhibitory properties to cTnT1 in the presence of ssTnI.Actomyosin ATPase assays were also carried out with equal amounts (50:50%) of different Tn complexes (Fig. 3, A and B). All assays in the presence of Ca2+ were carried out with a total Tn concentration of 1 μm. None of the cTnT isoforms showed a significant dominance over the other isoforms in the presence of ssTnI in affecting the maximal actomyosin ATPase activity (Fig. 3A). In the absence of Ca2+, 50:50% ratio of different Tn complexes (Fig. 3B) showed that cTnI was dominant over ssTnI for its ability to inhibit ATPase activity. 50:50% ratios of TnT1ssIC:TnT3ssIC showed a small preference for TnT1 over TnT3 with respect to the inhibition of ATPase activity (Fig. 3B). The results shown in Fig. 3B were all done at a total Tn concentration of 2 μm. However, similar assays done at 1 μm gave similar results (data not shown).Fig. 3Effect of the cTnT isoform mixtures on the activation (+Ca2+) or inhibition (–Ca2+) of the actin-Tm-activated myosin-ATPase activity.

Guzman G. Zhao J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35341-35349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).

Recent studies indicate that human colon adenomas and carcinomas lack retinol dehydrogenases (RDHs) and that APC regulates the expression of human RDHL. These data suggest a model wherein APC controls enterocyte differentiation by controlling retinoic acid production. However, the importance of APC and retinoic acid in mediating control of normal enterocyte development and differentiation remains unclear. To examine the relationship between APC and retinoic acid biosynthesis in normal enterocytes, we have identified two novel zebrafish retinol dehydrogenases, termed zRDHA and zRDHB, that show strong expression within the gut of developing zebrafish embryos. Morpholino knockdown of either APC or zRDHB in zebrafish embryos resulted in defects in structures known to require retinoic acid. These defects included cardiac abnormalities, pericardial edema, failed jaw and pectoral fin development, and the absence of differentiated endocrine and exocrine pancreas. In addition, APC or zRDHB morphant fish developed intestines that lacked columnar epithelial cells and failed to express the differentiation marker intestinal fatty acid-binding protein. Treatment of either APC or zRDHB morphant embryos with retinoic acid rescued the defective phenotypes. Downstream of retinoic acid production, we identified hoxc8 as a retinoic acid-induced gene that, when ectopically expressed, rescued phenotypes of APC- and zRDHB-deficient zebrafish.

These efforts have resulted in a model wherein APC plays a critical role in controlling colonocyte proliferation by regulating the WNT signaling pathway (1Polakis P. Curr. Opin. Genet.

In this model, APC serves as a cytoplasmic scaffolding molecule that permits assembly of a complex containing axin, glycogen synthase kinase-3β, and casein kinase Iϵ, which work together to target the transcriptional co-activator, β-catenin, for ubiquitin-mediated degradation (1Polakis P.

It is unclear, however, whether the tumor suppressor functions of APC are limited to its regulation of β-catenin and whether the loss of β-catenin control following APC mutation accounts fully for the clinical phenotypes following APC mutation (9Samowitz W.S.

Recent studies indicate that APC may promote colonocyte differentiation by stimulating the production of retinoic acid (RA), a biologically active lipid mediator with important roles controlling cell fate and differentiation (10Jette C. Peterson P.W. Sandoval I.T. Manos E.J. Hadley E. Ireland C.M. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34397-34405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Central to the ability of a cell to respond to retinoic acid is the requirement of first converting dietary retinol (vitamin A) into retinoic acid, a process that occurs via two enzymatic steps (11Duester G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4315-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The first step of this process converts retinol to retinal and is mediated by alcohol dehydrogenases and short chain dehydrogenases. The second step involves conversion of retinal into retinoic acid via aldehyde dehydrogenases (11Duester G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4315-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Given this required biosynthetic conversion, retinoic acid production is limited to cells harboring the necessary enzymes for conversion of vitamin A. We demonstrated previously that although colon adenomas and carcinomas have elevated β-catenin target genes, they also showed a deficiency of retinoic acid biosynthetic enzymes (10Jette C.

In establishing a link between APC and control of retinoic acid biosynthesis, introduction of APC into an APC mutant colon carcinoma cell line increased retinoic acid biosynthesis in parallel with the transcriptional induction of retinol dehydrogenase L (RDHL) (10Jette C.

Despite these observations, we currently lack evidence confirming a pivotal role for APC and retinoic acid in controlling enterocyte development and differentiation in vivo. We have utilized zebrafish to examine the relationship between APC, retinoic acid biosynthesis, and gut development. The data presented herein show that APC controls a retinoid and hox-dependent program of development and enterocyte differentiation in zebrafish. Key supporting evidence for this model comes from studies showing that morpholino knockdown of APC or the novel zebrafish retinol dehydrogenase zRDHB resulted in comparable defects in development including gut cell morphology and differentiation status. The phenotypes evoked by knockdown of either APC or zRDHB were rescued by the addition of exogenous retinoic acid or injection of hoxc8 mRNA. Embryo Culture and Zebrafish Stocks—Danio rerio (zebrafish) were maintained on a 14 h of light:10 h of dark cycle and maintained at 28.5 °C. Fertilized embryos were collected following natural spawnings, cultured, and staged by developmental time and morphological criteria as described previously (12Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book: A Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1995Google Scholar). Expression Analyses—Adult zebrafish tissues were dissected and then homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) using a Fastprep (Thermosavant) tissue homogenizer. Total RNA was then isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using Superscript III (Invitrogen). PCR primers used were as follows: zRDHA (tissue distribution): forward, 5′-CTCTTGGAGGAGCTTACTGCAT-3′, reverse, 5′-AATATCGTGTCCGAGGATGAAC-3′; zRDHA (developmental time course): forward, 5′-CTCTTGGAGGAGCTTACTGCAT-3′, reverse, 5′-AATATCGTGTCCGAGGATGAAC-3′; zRDHB (tissue distribution): forward, 5′-ACTGAAAACGCTCCAGCTCAAT-3′, reverse, 5′-ACACCAGTCAGATTCACATCCA-3′; zRDHB (developmental time course): forward, 5′-TGATTGAAGACGACCTGAAGAA-3′, reverse, 5′-ACCAGGGCATTAGTGAAGATGT-3′; cdx1: forward, 5′-TTGGAGAAAGAGGCAAGCAT-3′, reverse, 5′-TCGGATTTTCTTCTGATTGTGA-3′; hoxc8: forward, 5′-AAGCGCCGTATTGAAGTGTCCC-3′, reverse, 5′-TCACTCCTTGCTTTCCTCTTTCTC-3′; β-actin: forward 5′-GGTATGGGACAGAAAGACAG-3′, reverse, 5′-AGAGTCCATCACGATACCAG-3′. A template-free negative control was included in each experiment. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the Roche Light Cycler instrument and software, version 3.5 (Roche Applied Science). The primers used were as follows: cyclin D1: forward, 5′-GGAACTGCTGGCGCTAAATA-3′, reverse, 5′-GACTTGCGAGAGGAAGTTGG-3′; c-Myc: forward, 5′-TGACTGTGGAAAAGCGACAG-3′, reverse, 5′-GCTGCTGTTGATGCTGTGAT-3′; hoxc8a: forward, 5′-AAGCGCCGTATTGAAGTGTCCC-3′, reverse, 5′-TCACTCCTTGCTTTCCTCTTTCTC3′. PCRs were performed in duplicate using the LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science). PCR conditions were as follows: 35 cycles of amplification with 10 s of denaturation at 95 °C and 5 s of annealing at 57 °C. A template-free negative control was included in each experiment. Whole Mount in Situ Hybridizations—For whole mount in situ hybridizations, the embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in sucrose buffer, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, dehydrated in methanol, and stored at -20 °C. In situ hybridizations were carried out as described. Digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes were generated by linearization of pCRII (Invitrogen) containing zRDHA, zRDHB, i-FABP, insulin, trypsin, or hoxc8 cDNA followed by in vitro transcription with SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). The embryos were cleared in 70% glycerol/phosphate-buffered saline and photographed with a Leica MZ12 dissecting microscope (13Bisgrove B.W. Essner J.J. Yost H.J. Development. 2000; 127: 3567-3579PubMed Google Scholar). Morpholino and RNA Microinjections—Morpholino oligonucleotides were obtained from Gene Tools LLC. The zRDHB splicing blocking morpholino (5′-ATCCAAGTGGCACTCACCTTTCCCG-3′), APC morpholino (5′-TAGCATACTCTACCTGTGCTCTTCG-3′), and control morpholino (5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′) were solubilized to 1 mm in 1× Danieau buffer. For microinjections, 0.5 mm morpholino was injected into wild type embryos at the one to four cell stages (14Draper B.W. Morcos P.A. Kimmel C.B. Genesis. 2001; 30: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). For hoxc8 rescue experiments, full-length hoxc8 RNA was transcribed from a linearized pCRII/hoxc8 construct using mMessage mMachine (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For injections, 150 pg of capped and polyadenylated hoxc8 mRNA or 150 pg of capped and polyadenylated GFP mRNA was co-injected with a zRDHB MO or a standard control morpholino into oneor two-cell stage embryos. Retinoic Acid Treatments—To rescue zRDHB morphants by application of retinoic acid, the embryos were incubated in 1 μm all-trans retinoic acid in Me2SO at 50% epiboly for 1 h. The embryos were then washed in embryo water. RA treatments (20 nm) were repeated every 24 h for 1 h. Control embryos were treated over these periods with an equal volume of Me2SO (15Begemann G. Schilling T.F. Rauch G.J. Geisler R. Ingham P.W. Development. 2001; 128: 3081-3094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RA Extraction and HPLC Analysis—The cells were treated with 100 nmol ATROL at 80-90% confluence for 18 h. The medium was removed, and the cells were scraped into phosphate-buffered saline for protein or RNA quantification. After the addition of 100 nmol of internal standard TTNPB, the medium was acidified with 6 n HCl (0.03× volume) and extracted with equal volume of hexane containing 0.1 mg/ml butylated hydroxytoluene. The organic phase was transferred to a glass vial, dried under nitrogen, and reconstituted in 100 μl of 1:1 Me2SO/MeOH for HPLC analysis. Retinoid quantities were determined as described previously (16Blaner W.S. Piantedosi R. Sykes A. Vogel S. Nau H. Blaner W.S Retinoids: The Biochemical and Molecular Basis of Vitamin A and Retinoid Action. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1999: 117-144Google Scholar). Histological Analyses—The embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in sucrose buffer, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and embedded in paraffin. Six-micron sections were cut using a Leica microtome and stained in hematoxylin and eosin. The sections were analyzed using an Olympus compound microscope, and pictures were taken using a Zeiss Axiocam. Phenotypes of APC Knockdown Zebrafish Are Rescued by Retinoic Acid—To examine the hypothesis that APC facilitates enterocyte differentiation by regulating retinoic acid biosynthesis, we sought to knock down APC function and determine whether any resulting phenotypes were comparable with knockdown of retinoic acid biosynthetic enzymes. To accomplish this, we designed an APC-specific splicing blocking morpholino that targeted the splicing of APC between exon 15 and intron 15. Injection of this APC morpholino into wild type zebrafish embryos at the one- or two-cell stage resulted in the production of an intron-retained RNA transcript as verified by RT-PCR (Fig. 1A). This corresponded with a reduction in the level of the fully spliced APC transcripts. Analysis of mRNAs from embryos injected with a control morpholino demonstrated only fully spliced APC transcripts (Fig. 1A). To further validate APC knockdown, we measured the expression levels of c-myc (7He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4092) Google Scholar) and cyclin D1 (8Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3265) Google Scholar), which are reported β-catenin target genes and therefore should be up-regulated following APC knockdown. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed increased expression of these β-catenin target genes in the APC-deficient embryos (Fig. 1B). Having verified APC knockdown, we analyzed the resulting morphant embryos and observed a number of defects consistent with loss of retinoic acid including pericardial edema, failed cardiac looping, loss of jaw formation, and arrested pectoral fins (Fig. 1C) (15Begemann G. Schilling T.F. Rauch G.J. Geisler R. Ingham P.W. Development. 2001; 128: 3081-3094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Stafford D. Prince V.E. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1215-1220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 18Grandel H. Lun K. Rauch G.J. Rhinn M. Piotrowski T. Houart C. Sordino P. Kuchler A.M. Schulte-Merker S. Geisler R. Holder N. Wilson S.W. Brand M. Development. 2002; 129: 2851-2865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the morphant embryos showed reduced staining for the differentiated pancreas markers, insulin and trypsin, both known to require retinoic acid (Fig. 1D) (17Stafford D. Prince V.E. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1215-1220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). All of these phenotypes were strikingly similar to those reported for the zebrafish neckless mutant, which carries a mutation in the retinaldehyde dehydrogenase-2 gene and is defective in retinoic acid biosynthesis (15Begemann G. Schilling T.F. Rauch G.J. Geisler R. Ingham P.W. Development. 2001; 128: 3081-3094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the cardiac, jaw, and fin phenotypes present in the APC morphants are identical to those seen in a recently described APC mutant zebrafish (19Hurlstone A.F. Haramis A.P. Wienholds E. Begthel H. Korving J. Van Eeden F. Cuppen E. Zivkovic D. Plasterk R.H. Clevers H. Nature. 2003; 425: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). We attempted to rescue APC morphant phenotypes by application of exogenous retinoic acid. We found that treatment of morphant embryos with 1.0 μm RA once a day for 4 days rescued pectoral fin and jaw development in 65% (n = 117) of the APC morphant embryos (Fig. 1C). In addition, retinoic acid treatment rescued expression of the pancreatic markers trypsin and insulin in a similar proportion of animals (Fig. 1D). zRDHA and zRDHB Are Novel Zebrafish Retinol Dehydrogenases—Because retinoic acid treatment rescued APC morphant embryos and because APC induces the expression of human RDHL, we sought to identify zebrafish retinol dehydrogenases that might be downstream of APC. To accomplish this, we first used the human RDHL protein sequence to perform a tBLASTn search of all available zebrafish expressed sequence tags. This search identified two independent zebrafish genes that we termed zRDHA and zRDHB. We confirmed the presence of the predicted mRNAs for zRDHA and zRDHB in zebrafish tissues by designing primers that flanked the putative open reading frames and used these to amplify the corresponding cDNAs by RT-PCR. Using a pool of zebrafish gut mRNA, we amplified products of the predicted size for both zRDHA and zRDHB and confirmed the data base-derived sequence for each gene by standard sequence analysis (data not shown). The GenBank™ accession numbers of these corresponding cDNAs are NM_199609 and NM_198069 for zRDHA and zRDHB, respectively. Inspection of the protein alignments indicated that zRDHA and zRDHB were 47.0 and 45.5% identical to hRDHL, respectively, and that each displayed important structural features characteristic of known short chain fatty acid dehydrogenases/reductases (Fig. 2) (20Kallberg Y. Oppermann U. Jornvall H. Persson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4409-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). These features included a conserved cofactor binding site motif of GXXXGXG starting at Gly-36 in zRDHA and Gly-46 in zRDHB. In addition, each predicted protein also displayed an active site consensus sequence of YXXXK. The active site consensus sequence started at position Tyr-176 in zRDHA and Tyr-186 in zRDHB. Phylogenetic alignment of the predicted zRDHA and zRDHB proteins also suggested evolutionary conservation with retinol dehydrogenases (Fig 3A).Fig. 3zRDHA and zRDHB align with retinol dehydrogenases and facilitate conversion of retinol into retinoic acid. A, a phylogenetic analysis placed zRDHA and zRDHB within a larger family of known retinol dehydrogenases. GenBank™ accession numbers are provided for each aligned sequence. B, zRDHA and zRDHB were overexpressed with a N-terminal V5 tag in the human colon cell line, HCT116. Cells carrying empty vector (bar 1), V5-zRDHA (bar 2), or V5-zRDHB (bar 3) were incubated with 100 nmol of retinol for 18 h. The retinoids were then extracted from the culture medium using acidified hexane and separated by reverse phase HPLC. Retinoic acid levels were quantified by comparison with the internal extraction standard, TTNPB. The data shown are the means ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To validate zRDHA and zRDHB as enzymatically active retinol dehydrogenases, we overexpressed each protein fused to an N-terminal V5 tag in the human colon cell line, HCT116. Western blotting against the V5 tag confirmed protein expression and allowed optimization of protein expression prior to enzyme activity analysis (data not shown). To assess enzymatic activity, we incubated cells carrying empty vector, V5-zRDHA, or V5-zRDHB with 100 nmol retinol for 18 h and extracted retinoids from the culture medium using acidified hexane. Retinoid derivatives in the extracts were separated by reverse phase HPLC and retinoic acid levels quantified by comparison with the internal extraction standard, TTNPB. Fig. 3B shows that cells transfected with zRDHA or zRDHB produced ∼3.0-fold more retinoic acid than cells transfected with vector alone, thus confirming zRDHA and zRDHB as bona fide retinol dehydrogenases. Tissue Distribution of zRDHA and zRDHB—Sequence similarities within the short chain fatty acid dehydrogenase/reductase family make it difficult to precisely determine interspecies orthology based solely on protein alignments. We were unable, therefore, to determine whether zRDHA or zRDHB were direct orthologs of human RDHL. Previous studies, however, have shown that human RDHL is highly expressed in adult colon tissues, thus suggesting a specific functional role for RDHL in human gut (10Jette C. Peterson P.W. Sandoval I.T. Manos E.J. Hadley E. Ireland C.M. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34397-34405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Chetyrkin S.V. Belyaeva O.V. Gough W.H. Kedishvili N.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22278-22286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We, therefore, asked whether zRDHA or zRDHB showed gut-restricted expression in zebrafish. To accomplish this, we first examined whether expression of zRDHA and zRDHB paralleled embryologic development of the gut, which in zebrafish is histologically evident beginning at 21 hpf (22Wallace K.N. Pack M. Dev. Biol. 2003; 255: 12-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 23Pack M. Solnica-Krezel L. Malicki J. Neuhauss S.C. Schier A.F. Stemple D.L. Driever W. Fishman M.C. Development. 1996; 123: 321-328PubMed Google Scholar). RT-PCR analysis of zRDHA and zRDHB using RNA harvested from zebrafish embryos at various times between 0 and 120 hpf demonstrated expression of zRDHA in embryos by 6 hpf and remained strong at all time points examined through 120 hpf (Fig. 4A). zRDHB levels were very low and undetectable at time 0. By 6 h, however, the levels of zRDHB began to increase and reached maximal levels at ∼48 hpf. Expression of zRDHB remained robust through 120 hpf (Fig. 4A). Whole mount in situ hybridization analyses on embryos at 48 and 96 hpf showed specific embryonic structures expressing zRDHA and zRDHB. At 48 hpf, the expression patterns of zRDHA and zRDHB were very similar and evident in anterior portions of the fish including the brain, pectoral fins, and spine (Fig. 4B). At 48 h there was no apparent staining of zRDHA or zRDHB in the developing gut. By 96 hpf, however, the expression of the two RDHs was largely confined to the gut. This expression in the gut was confirmed by comparison with the expression of i-FABP (Fig. 4B), a known marker of mature gut epithelium (24Andre M. Ando S. Ballagny C. Durliat M. Poupard G. Briancon C. Babin P.J. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 44: 249-252PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, i-FABP transcripts were undetectable in 48-hpf embryos (Fig. 4B) but present within the gut at 96 h. Sectioning of the whole mount 96-hpf larvae showed that i-FABP, zRDHA, and zRDHB transcripts were localized to epithelial cells (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, zRDHA and zRDHB transcripts showed subcellular localization in the microvillus brush border region of the gut enterocytes. This finding is consistent with the subcellular localization of other transcripts within enterocyte brush border microvilli (25Houle V.M. Li W. Montgomery R.K. Grand R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G722-G727PubMed Google Scholar). We also performed RT-PCR analysis of zRDHA and zRDHB on RNA harvested from heart, skeletal muscle, eye, brain, fin, gut, and skin of 12-month-old wild type zebrafish. As a positive control for gut-specific expression, we monitored the expression of the caudal-related transcription factor cdx1 (26Traber P.G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 470: 1-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, cdx1 showed strong expression that was confined to gut tissues in adult zebrafish (Fig. 4C). The expression of zRDHB, for the most part, paralleled that of cdx1 and showed highest expression levels in gut (Fig. 4C). In contrast, zRDHA signals were detected in all tissues examined, including gut (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, a survey of adult zebrafish intestines that had been dissected into six segments along the anterior-posterior axis revealed zRDHB expression predominantly in the anterior intestine. This was unlike zRDHA expression, which appeared constant along the gut AP axis (Fig. 4C). Knockdown of zRDHB Phenocopies APC Knockdown—Because of the gut-restricted expression of zRDHB in adults, we sought to abrogate the production of zRDHB protein in an effort to determine whether it functions as an RDH in vivo, and if so, whether it plays a critical role downstream of APC. To this end, we designed a splice-blocking morpholino that efficiently reduced zRDHB splicing when injected into embryos at the one- or two-cell stage (Fig. 5A). The zRDHB morphant fish displayed a number of phenotypes that recapitulated the APC morphants and that were absent from control morpholino-injected fish. These phenotypes included pericardial edema (Fig. 5B), lack of jaw bone development (Fig. 5C), and failure to form pectoral fins (Fig. 5C). The penetrance of each of the observed phenotypes depended on the amount of zRDHB morpholino injected and reached ∼75% (n = 152) in embryos injected with 0.5 nl of 0.5 mm antisense oligonucleotide. Animals that received this injection amount retained at least 50% viability. Higher injection amounts increased phenotype penetrance but also caused severe mortality, suggesting that further knockdown of zRDHB was lethal (see Fig. 7E). This lethality was not observed in animals injected with identical amounts of a control morpholino. The similarities between phenotypes evoked by zRDHB knockdown and those reported for the zebrafish raldh2 genetic mutant known as neckless strongly support zRDHB as an in vivo retinol dehydrogenase (15Begemann G. Schilling T.F. Rauch G.J. Geisler R. Ingham P.W. Development. 2001; 128: 3081-3094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As seen with rescue of these structures in the APC morphants, we found that the addition of retinoic acid rescued both fin and jaw phenotypes following zRDHB knockdown. Pectoral fin development was restored in 80% (n = 92) of morphant embryos following retinoic acid treatment (Fig. 5C). Retinoic acid treatment partially rescued jaw formation in a similar proportion of zRDHB morphants as evidenced by alcian blue staining"
https://openalex.org/W1999575946,"We have used an isolated receptor, the leukotriene B4 receptor BLT1, to analyze the mechanism of receptor activation in a G-protein-coupled receptor dimer. The isolated receptor is essentially a dimer whether the agonist is present or not, provided the detergent used stabilizes the inactive dimeric assembly. We have produced a receptor mutant where Cys97 in the third transmembrane domain has been replaced by a serine. This mutation leads to an ∼100-fold decrease in the affinity for the agonist. 5-Hydroxytryptophan has then been introduced at position 234 in the C97A mutant sixth transmembrane domain. Agonist binding to the labeled receptor is associated with variations in the fluorescence properties of 5-hydroxytryptophan due to specific agonist-induced conformational changes. The C97A mutant labeled with 5-hydroxytryptophan has then been associated with a wild-type receptor in a dimeric complex that has been subsequently purified. The purified complex activates its G-protein partner in a similar manner as the wild-type homodimer. Due to the difference in the affinity for the agonist between the wild-type and mutant protomers in this dimer, we have been able to reach a state where one of the protomers, the mutant, is in its unliganded state, whereas the other, the wild type, is loaded with the agonist. We show that agonist binding to the wild-type receptor induces specific changes in the conformation of the unliganded protomer, as evidenced by the variations in the emission of the 5-hydroxytryptophan residue in the mutant receptor.

There is also evidence that receptor dimerization and activation are intricately associated. In this context, an interesting mechanism to consider is trans-activation. In this mechanism, ligand binding to one of the monomers in the dimeric assembly results in activation of the other receptor within the dimer. Trans-activation is well documented for class C GPCRs, in particular for the GABAB receptor. In this case, it is clearly demonstrated that one subunit, GB1, binds the agonist, whereas the other, GB2, activates the G-protein (14Galvez T. Duthey B. Kniazeff J. Blahos J. Rovelli G. Bettler B.

A. 2001; 98: 14649-14654Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The situation is not that clear for the other classes of receptors. In the case of the LH/CG receptor, co-expression of a mutant receptor defective in hormone binding and another mutant defective in signal generation rescued hormone-activated cAMP production (17Ji I. Lee C. Song Y. Conn P.M. Ji T.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1299-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 18Lee C. Ji I. Ryu K. Song Y. Conn P.M. Ji T.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 42578-42587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) have shown, using a series of Gα fusion proteins and specific mutant of the histamine H1 and α1b-adrenergic receptors, that co-expression of two nonfunctional but complementary fusion constructs reconstituted agonist-mediated signaling. All of these results point to the fact that dimers of these receptors could function via trans-activation. Finally, dimerization is also likely to be required for an efficient interaction with intracellular partners such as the G-protein (20Banères J.L. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and certainly plays a role in receptor internalization (21Perron A. Chen Z.G. Gingras D. Dupre D.J. Stankova J.

We have produced the leukotriene B4 receptor BLT1 as a functional protein isolated in a detergent medium (23Banères J.L. Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Binding of the agonist to the isolated receptor is associated with a series of specific conformational changes leading to the active state of the receptor (23Banères J.L. Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Isolated BLT1 therefore appears as a particularly convenient in vitro model system to analyze the relationship between dimerization and activation. By using a receptor dimer where one of the protomers displays a lower affinity for the agonist, we establish here that agonist-induced activation of one of the monomers in the dimeric assembly affects the conformation of the unliganded monomer. This clearly indicates that cooperative conformational changes occur in this GPCR dimer. Materials—The antagonist molecule 5bα, (1S*,3S*)-1-hydroxy-3-((3S*R*,E)-3-hydroxy-7-phenylhept-1-en-1-yl)cyclohexane-1-N,N-dimethyl acetamide, was synthesized as described by Poudrel et al. (24Poudrel J.-M. Hullot P. Vidal J.-P. Girard J.-P. Rossi J.-C. Muller A. Bonne C. Bezuglov V. Serkov I. Renard P. Pfeiffer B. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 5289-5310Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). LTB4 was purchased from BIOMOL Laboratories; 5HW and hexadecyl-β-d-maltoside were from Sigma. Alexa Fluor 350 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester and Alexa Fluor 488 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Buffer A contained 12.5 mm sodium borate, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm LDAO, pH 7.8. Buffer B contained 12.5 mm sodium borate, 50 mm KCl, 0.05 mm hexadecyl-β-d-maltoside, pH 7.8. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The C97A mutation was introduced in both the wild-type receptor and the W41L,W83L,W142L,W161L mutant by PCR-mediated mutagenesis using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and, as a template, either the wild-type BLT1 or the BLT1W41L,W83L,W142L,W161L constructs described by Banères et al. (23Banères J.L. Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. R·R0 Purification—We used here the wild-type BLT1 and BLT1W41L,W83L,C97A,W142L,W161L construct described previously (23Banères J.L. Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In both cases, a stop codon (TGA) was inserted by site-directed mutagenesis immediately after the sequence encoding the receptor to prevent expression of the His tag sequence at the receptor C terminus. We inserted an S tag encoding sequence (Novagen) at the 5′-end of the sequence encoding BLT1 and a hexahistidine encoding sequence at the 5′-end of the sequence encoding BLT1W41L,W83L,C97A,W142L,W161L. These two tags were inserted between the NdeI and BamHI sites in the pET21b-BLT1 vector (23Banères J.L. Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The BLT1 receptor was expressed and purified, under denaturing conditions, as previously described (23Banères J.L. Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), except that 1.25% (w/v) sarcosyl was added to the denaturing buffer to increase the solubilization ratios. 5HW was incorporated in BLT1W41L,W83L,C97A,W142L,W161L by using the CY(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli strain (20Banères J.L. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The 5HW-labeled protein was purified under denaturing conditions under the same conditions as the wild-type receptor (23Banères J.L. Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The wild-type (R) and mutant (R0) receptors were mixed in equimolecular amounts before refolding, and the protein was refolded as described in Banères et al. (23Banères J.L. Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Unfolded proteins were discarded as described in Banères et al. (23Banères J.L. Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and the functional receptor dimers were further purified on a 5–20% isokinetic sucrose gradient. The conformational features of the recovered protein were systematically checked by CD and shown to be similar to those previously reported (23Banères J.L. Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For R·R0 purification, the refolded proteins were first immobilized on an S-protein-agarose column (Novagen) previously equilibrated in buffer B. A first protein fraction (F1; see Fig. 4) eluted during washing with buffer B. The retained proteins were then eluted with buffer B containing 1 m MgCl2. The protein fraction recovered under these conditions was directly loaded on an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow column (Qiagen). A first protein fraction (F2; see Fig. 4) was eluted during the washing step with buffer B. Elution was then carried out with buffer B containing 100 mm imidazole to recover the last protein fraction (F3; see Fig. 4). F1, F2, and F3 were extensively dialyzed in buffer B. Ligand Binding Assays—LTB4 binding was assayed as previously described (20Banères J.L. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 23Banères J.L. Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The titration data were analyzed using the PRISM software (Graphpad Inc.) by considering a set of usual models for describing the ligand-receptor interactions. GTPγS Binding Assays—[35S]GTPγS binding assays were performed as previously described (20Banères J.L. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Data are presented as percentage of bound GTPγS normalized to the binding obtained with the LTB4-saturated R·R complex (20Banères J.L. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Alexa Fluor Labeling—The receptor purified in its unfolded state was extensively dialyzed in 12.5 mm sodium borate, pH 7.3, 1.25% (w/v) sarcosyl to remove urea while maintaining the receptor soluble. This pH value was determined from a series of labeling reactions carried out at different pH (ranging from 7 to 9) to define the optimal value for labeling only the protein N terminus and not the lysyl residues. The fluorescent probes were added to the protein solution (reactive reagent/protein molar ratio 10:1), and the reaction was carried out at room temperature for 5 h under constant stirring. The conjugate was separated from the unreacted labeling reagent on a Sephadex G-50 column (10 × 300 mm) equilibrated in 12.5 mm sodium borate, pH 7.8, 1.25% (w/v) sarcosyl. The relative efficiency of the labeling reaction was determined by measuring the absorbance of the protein at 276 nm (23Banères J.L. Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and that of the dye at its absorbance maximum (346 and 495 nm for Alexa Fluor 350 and 488, respectively). A ratio of 0.7–0.8 of fluorescent probe per receptor molecule was routinely found. The effectiveness of the N-terminal labeling was verified by proteolytic digestion of the receptor and N-terminal sequencing. Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at 20 °C on an Eclipse spectrofluorimeter (Cary) with an excitation wavelength of 315 nm (bandwidth 2 nm) for the 5HW fluorescence measurements and 350 nm (bandwidth 2 nm) for the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments. For the excitation spectra, the emission was collected at 340 nm. For the emission spectra of the agonist-loaded receptor, emission was recorded 30 min after adding the ligand. Protein concentrations in the 10–8 to 10–9m range were used. Buffer B was used in all measurements. Buffer contributions were subtracted under the same experimental conditions. BLT1 Dimerization—We previously showed that agonist-loaded BLT1 was essentially a dimer, whereas the free receptor corresponded to a mixture of monomer and dimer (20Banères J.L. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). As we previously discussed, this could be due to agonist-induced dimerization or could translate the fact that the unliganded dimer is less stable than the agonist-loaded one so that it partly dissociates in a detergent medium. To assess these different possibilities on an experimental basis, we explored the stability of the ligand-free BLT1 dimer in the presence of different detergents. The monomer/dimer ratio was defined by chemical cross-linking, as previously described (20Banères J.L. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The results obtained for some of these detergents are given in Fig. 1. The amount of receptor dimer in the absence of agonist is clearly dependent on the detergent used. Whereas, as previously reported (20Banères J.L. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), the agonist-free receptor corresponds to a mixture of monomer and dimer in the presence of LDAO or β-d-dodecyl maltoside, the unliganded receptor is essentially dimeric when reconstituted with detergents such as hexadecyl-β-d-maltoside (Fig. 1). BLT1 was also found to be dimeric when reconstituted in proteoliposomes (not shown). This indicates that BLT1 is likely to be essentially dimeric but that the unliganded dimer is less stable than the agonist-loaded one so that it dissociates depending on the detergent used (see “Discussion”). Hexadecyl-β-d-maltoside has the same head group as the widely used β-d-dodecyl maltoside detergent but displays a longer alkyl chain (16 and 12 atoms of carbon, respectively), and this may have an effect on dimer stability. Indeed, we previously showed that detergents with long hydrophobic chains stabilized the purified receptor better than detergents with short chain (23Banères J.L. Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We used in the following work hexadecyl-β-d-maltoside that allows a maximal stabilization of the receptor dimer, even in the absence of agonist. BLT1 C97A Mutant—We produced a receptor mutant where Cys97 in the third TM domain has been substituted by an alanine. Cys97 was identified on the basis of photolabeling experiments as being part of the receptor ligand-binding pocket and directly responsible for specific BLT1-LTB4 interactions. 2J.-L. Banères, manuscript in preparation. Substituting Cys97 for an alanine does not affect the structural features of the complex, as inferred from circular dichroism measurements (data not shown). However, as expected on the basis of the photolabeling data, the C97A mutant is characterized by an ∼100-fold decrease in the affinity for LTB4 (Kd = 2.4 × 10–7 and 1.8 × 10–9m for the mutant and wild-type receptors, respectively) (Fig. 2). We then analyzed the ability of the C97A mutant of BLT1 to be specifically activated by the agonist. We previously established that agonist binding to a receptor mutant where all of the tryptophan residues, besides Trp234 in TM6, had been replaced by leucines (W41L,W83L,W142L,W161L mutant) is associated with specific changes in the fluorescence emission spectrum of the receptor (23Banères J.L. Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These changes are probably due to a difference in the immediate environment of Trp234 between the inactive and active states of the receptor. We introduced here the C97A mutation in the W41L,W83L,W142L,W161L mutant of BLT1. We previously showed that all the Trp → Leu mutations, with the exception of W234L, resulted in no significant alteration of the Ka value of the receptor for its LTB4 agonist (23Banères J.L. Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The W41L,W83L,C97A,W142L,W161L mutant therefore displays the same affinity for LTB4 than the single C97A mutant. We then produced this mutant with 5HW instead of tryptophan at position 234 (see “Experimental Procedures”). As previously reported (20Banères J.L. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), the advantage of labeling the receptor with 5HW is that this residue can be selectively excited between 310 and 320 nm without affecting the other Trp residues (see excitation spectra of the unlabeled and labeled receptor in Fig. 3A). The 5HW-labeled W41L,W83L,C97A,W142L,W161L mutant has been systematically used throughout this work and is named R0, as opposed to the wild-type receptor that will be named R. We then recorded the fluorescence spectra of R0 upon specific excitation of the 5HW residue at 315 nm in the absence or presence of LTB4. As shown in Fig. 3B, agonist binding to R0 is associated with a significant increase in the fluorescence of the 5HW residue. The emission features observed upon binding of LTB4 to R0 are very similar to those we reported in the case of R (20Banères J.L. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), indicating that the same kind of agonist-induced conformational changes are likely to occur for the wild-type and mutant receptors. This effect is agonist-specific, since no significant change was observed upon binding of the 5bα antagonist (not shown). The changes in 5HW emission features induced by agonist binding therefore provide a convenient method for monitoring changes in R0 conformation. Finally, we analyzed the dimerization properties of R0 by chemical cross-linking, as described above for the wild-type receptor. No difference was observed between the mutant and wild-type receptor at the dimerization level: R0, when reconstituted in hexadecyl-β-d-maltoside, is essentially in a dimeric state in the absence or presence of its agonist (not shown). R0 therefore represents a receptor with the same properties than the wild-type receptor in terms of activation and dimerization but with a decreased affinity for its agonist. R·R0 Dimer—In order to produce a receptor dimer containing a single R0 molecule, we selectively labeled R and R0 with two different purification tags, namely an S tag and a His tag. Briefly stated (see “Experimental Procedures” for details), both receptors were mixed before refolding in equimolecular amounts and then refolded. Since R0 displays the same structural features and dimerization properties as the wild-type receptor (see above), one should expect, after refolding, a mixture of both R·R and R0·R0 homodimers as well as the R·R0 “heterodimer.” The latter was purified through two successive steps involving the two different affinity tags on R and R0 (Fig. 4). The protein complex obtained after the second purification step on the nickel column (F3; see Fig. 4 for the definition of the fractions) displays two classes of agonist binding sites (Fig. 5). One is of high affinity, identical to that of the wild-type receptor, and the other displays an affinity close to, although slightly higher than (see “Discussion”), that of the C97A mutant. A series of cross-linking experiments were also carried out to assess the stoichiometric features of the protein complex in the F3 fraction. As expected, a single species was observed after chemical cross-linking with an electrophoretic mobility compatible with that of a receptor dimer (see inset in Fig. 5A), indicating that the major species obtained under such conditions is the dimeric assembly. All of these data indicate that the protein complex purified under such conditions is the R·R0 “heterodimer.” The interesting feature with the R·R0 complex is that the difference in the affinity for LTB4 between R and R0 makes it possible to reach a state where only one of the protomers, R, is loaded with the agonist (see titration plot in Fig. 5). We confirmed R·R0 dimerization using FRET. For these measurements, R0 and R were labeled at their N terminus with a fluorescence donor (Alexa Fluor 350) and acceptor (Alexa Fluor 488) molecule, respectively. To label only the N terminus of the proteins, the labeling reaction was carried out in vitro at a pH value where only the N-terminal amine and not the lysil ϵ-amino group is protonated and therefore able to react with the probe (see “Experimental Procedures”). We then analyzed the fluorescence transfer properties of each of the protein complexes obtained from the two successive purification steps on the S-protein-agarose and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid columns (see Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 6, a significant energy transfer signal was observed only for the protein complex in the second peak eluted from the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (F3). This indicates that both the wild-type and the mutant receptor are associated in the dimeric complex, confirming the conclusion inferred from the ligand-binding data. G-protein Activation by the R·R0 Dimer—We then checked whether the mutation in the R·R0 complex affected the coupling to the G-protein. For this, we analyzed the ability of the heterodimer to catalyze GDT/GTP exchange at the level of Gαi2, as previously reported for the R·R homodimer (20Banères J.L. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, the nonhydrolyzable GTPγS analog does not significantly bind to Gαi2β1γ2 when the R·R0 heterodimer is devoid of its agonist. In contrast, saturating the ligand-binding sites of R·R0 with LTB4 leads to the binding of GTPγS to an amount comparable with that obtained with the wild-type homodimer (Fig. 7). As expected, no GTPγS binding occurred in the presence of the 5bα antagonist. Moreover, as previously reported in the case of the R·R homodimer, this is a specific effect, since nearly no G-protein activation was observed when Gαs was used instead of Gαi (not shown). As stated above, the GTPγS binding profiles are similar for the R·R and R·R0 complexes, indicating that the R·R0 heterodimer is able to activate the G-protein in the same way as the R·R homodimer does. Activation of R0 in the R·R0 Dimer—We then analyzed the activation of R0 in the R·R0 dimer at different LTB4 concentrations. As described above, in this “heterodimer,” only the R0 protomer includes a 5HW residue. Under such conditions, it is possible to selectively follow the conformational changes of R0 in the R·R0 complex by measuring the fluorescence variations upon specifically exciting the 5HW residue at 315 nm, with no contribution of the tryptophan residues in R. We therefore carried out a parallel titration experiment by measuring both LTB4 binding to R·R0 and the changes in the emission properties of 5HW in R0. As clearly shown in Fig. 8, filling the high affinity binding sites in R with LTB4 is associated with a significant increase in the emission of 5HW in R0. Fitting this fluorescence variation to a single-site hyperbolic function showed EC50 closely related to the affinity value determined for the high affinity sites in R from direct LTB4 binding measurement. This strongly indicates that the effects observed on the emission properties of 5HW in R0 are the direct consequence of the binding of LTB4 to R. It is to be noted that in this state, the R protomer is, as expected, in the active conformation (intrinsic fluorescence data with an R·R0 complex where only R contains 5HW; not shown). A subsequent change in the emission properties of 5HW, of lesser amplitude, was observed after loading the low affinity sites in R0 with LTB4, indicating that a subsequent conformational adaptation occurs after binding of the agonist to R0 in the R·R0 dimer. In contrast to what is observed with LTB4, no change in the emission properties of 5HW was observed upon binding of an antagonist molecule (5bα) to the R·R0 dimer (not shown), indicating that the effects observed above were specific to the agonist. All of these observations clearly sho"

Transfer RNA modification enzymes must distinguish specific tRNAs from the other RNA species as substrates and recognize the target site for modification. In general, tRNA modification enzymes act at a single specific site (4Björk G.R. Hatfield D.L. Lee B.J. Pirtle R.M. Transfer RNA in Protein Synthesis.

This modification is found in almost class I tRNAs that have the semi-conserved G46 residue (1McCloskey J.A. Crain P.F.

In addition, there are a limited number of examples where the m7G modification is found at other positions, for example, G34 in mitochondria tRNASer from starfish (36Matsuyama S. Ueda T. Crain P.F.

This enzymatic activity was first detected in a cell extract of Escherichia coli (39Hurwitz J. Gold M. Anders M. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the tRNA m7G46 modification activity has been detected in the crude extracts from higher eukaryotes (i.e. Xenopus laevis (43Koski R.A. Clarkson S.G. J. Biol.

Recently, it has been reported that yeast tRNA (m7G46) methyltransferase is composed of two protein subunits (Trm8 and Trm82), and their genes have been identified (46Alexandrov A. Martzen M.R. Phizicky E.M. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 1253-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an E. coli gene encoding a tRNA (m7G46) methyltransferase activity (yggH) has been reported (47De Bie L.G. Roovers M. Oudjama Y. Wattiez R. Tricot C. Stalon V. Droogmans L. Bujnicki J.M.

We independently identified yggH as a responsible gene for m7G46 modification in E. coli by using a systematic gene disruption system. 1Y. Ikeuchi, and T. Suzuki, T. manuscript in preparation.1Y.

We searched for yggH homologs in several genomes of thermophilic organisms, since proteins from these sources are generally more stable than their mesophilic counterparts (15Watanabe M. Nameki N.

A. aeolicus, which was isolated from a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park, can grow at nearly 95 °C (52Huber R. Wilharm T. Huber D. Trincone A. Burggraf S. Konig H. Rachel R. Rockinger I. Fricke H. Stetter K.O. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1992; 15: 340-351Crossref Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The 16 S rRNA gene of A. aeolicus has been analyzed from the perspective of molecular evolution, and it was suggested that this bacterium is the earliest diverging eubacterium (53Burggraf S. Olsen G.J. Stetter K.O. Woese C.R. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1992; 15: 353-356Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The complete genome sequence of this organism was determined in 1998 (54Deckert G. Warren P.V. Gaasterland T. Young W.G. Lenox A.L. Graham D.E. Overbeek R. Snead M.A. Keller M. Aujay M. Huber R. Feldman R.A. Short J.M. Olsen G.J. Swanson R.V. Nature. 1998; 392: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Characterization of the yggH homolog from A. aeolicus should help clarify the molecular evolution of m7G46 modification in tRNA.In this paper, we report that A. aeolicus open reading frame aq065, which shares relatively poor homology with E. coli yggH, encodes a tRNA (m7G46) methyltransferase. We have studied the substrate RNA recognition mechanism of the enzyme.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[Methyl-14C]AdoMet 2The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectroscopy. (1.95 GBq/mmol) and [methyl-3H]AdoMet (2.47 TBq/mmol) were purchased from ICN. Cold AdoMet was obtained from Sigma. DE52 was a product of Whatman. CM-Toyopearl 650M came from Tosoh, Japan. DNA oligomers were bought from Invitrogen, and T7 RNA polymerase was from Toyobo, Japan. Other chemical reagents were of analytical grade.Construction of A. aeolicus aq065 Protein Expression System in E. coli—The aq065 gene was amplified by PCR from A. aeolicus genomic DNA using following primers: AYGGHN, 5′-GGG GCA TAT GCT CTG TTA CGT AAA TTA CAA AAG -3′; AYGGHC, 5′- GGG GGT CGA CTT AAC TCA GCA ATT GAG CCA CCG TT-3′. The recognition sites of restriction enzymes NdeI and SalI are underlined. The amplified DNA was cloned into pET30a expression vector (Novagen) utilizing the restriction enzyme sites. The resulting expression construct, pET30a-AYGGH, was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3)-Codonplus-RIL strain (Stratagene) for expression.Expression and Purification of the aq065 Protein—The expression of the aq065 protein in E. coli cells was carried out according to the manufacturer's manual (Novagen). After the isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 6500 × g for 20 min, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until required. The cells (5 g) were suspended in 25 ml of the buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm KCl) and disrupted with an ultrasonic disruptor model UD-200 (Tomy, Japan). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (8000 × g, 20 min), and the supernatant fractions were heated at 70 °C for 30 min. The denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation (8000 × g, 30 min), and the supernatant fractions were applied onto a DE52 column (column volume, 10 ml). The column was washed with 35 ml of buffer A and then 40 ml of buffer A containing 150 mm KCl. The enzymatic activities were eluted by the addition of 40 ml of buffer A containing 200 mm KCl. The relevant fractions were pooled and then dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 6.8), 5 mm MgCl2, and 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The dialyzed sample was applied onto a CM-Toyopearl 650M column (column volume, 20 ml). The column was washed with 60 ml of buffer B and then 60 ml of buffer B containing 150 mm KCl. The enzyme was eluted by the addition of 60 ml of buffer B containing 300 mm KCl. The fractions were combined, dialyzed against the buffer A, and concentrated with Amicon ultra centrifugal filter device (10,000 Mr cut-off) (Millipore). Glycerol was added to the sample to give a final concentration of 50% v/v. Aliquots were then frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until required. Protein was quantified using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard.Measurements of the Enzymatic Activities—The standard assay for the purification was carried out by measuring the incorporation of a radiolabeled methyl group from [methyl-14C]AdoMet into yeast tRNAPhe transcript. The assay mixture (300 ng the protein, 13.5 μm transcript, and 38 μm [methyl-14C]AdoMet) in 30 μl of buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm KCl) was incubated for 5 min at 60 °C. An aliquot (20 μl) was then used for the conventional filter assay. The tRNA transcripts were prepared as reported previously (23Hori H. Kubota S. Watanabe K. Kim J.M. Ogasawara T. Sawasaki T. Endo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25081-25090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and purified by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7 m urea). Each transcript was annealed (cooling down from 80 to 40 °C for 40 min) in the buffer C before use. Apparent kinetic parameters, Km and Vmax, were determined from a Lineweaver-Burk plot of the methyl transfer reaction with [methyl-3H]AdoMet by the filter assay. Briefly, the wild-type transcript and tRNA precursor were assayed at 60 °C, and the other variants were assayed at 50 °C. Methyl transfer was visualized after gel electrophoresis using a Fuji Photo Film BAS2000 imaging analyzer system. A mixture of 100 ng of purified enzyme, 38 μm [methyl-14C]AdoMet, and 13.5 μm transcript in 30 μl of the buffer C was incubated at 30, 50, or 60 °C for 10 min. The relevant assay temperature of each experiment is stated in “Results.” The reaction mixture (5 μl) was then analyzed by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7 m urea). The gel was stained with methylene blue and dried. The incorporation of 14C methyl group was monitored with a Fuji Photo Film BAS2000 imaging analyzer system. Methyl transfer using poor substrates required an extended incubation period and a large amount of the enzyme. Specifically, the reaction mixture comprised 300 ng of enzyme, 38 μm [methyl-14C]AdoMet, and 13.5 μm transcript in 30 μl of the buffer C. The mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 30 min, and then the aliquot (5 μl) was loaded onto the gel for analysis.Mass Spectrometry—Yeast tRNAPhe (50 μg) was methylated with an excess amount of enzyme and cold AdoMet for 4 h at 60 °C in 100 μl of the buffer C. The RNA was extracted with phenol, recovered by ethanol precipitation, and loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel (7 m urea). After electrophoresis, the RNA was visualized by UV (254 nm) irradiation on a thin layer plate (Funacell P-254, Japan), excised, and extracted with 400 μl of gel elution buffer (0.5 m ammonium acetate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS). The extracted sample was passed through a Steradisc 13 filter unit (0.2 μm, Kurabo, Japan), and the RNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. For nucleoside analysis, the sample was completely digested with nuclease P1 and then treated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase. For fragment analysis, methylated or unmethylated control tRNA (25 μg of each) was digested with RNase T1 (2.5 unit) in 25 mm ammonium acetate (pH 5.3) at 37 °C for 1 h and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. Oligonucleotides produced by RNase T1 digestion were separated and analyzed by LC/MS in negative ion mode as described previously (49Hori H. Suzuki T. Sugawara K. Inoue Y. Shibata T. Kuramitsu S.

One candidate open reading frame, aq065, was found. The aq065 protein has three amino acid sequence motifs that resemble those of E. coli YggH (Fig. 1A). However, the N-terminal portion of aq065 protein is much shorter than E. coli YggH, and the C-terminal portion does not share homology (Fig. 1B). To characterize this protein, we cloned the target gene by PCR and engineered it for expression in E. coli BL21(DE3)-Codonplus-RIL strain/pET30a vector system as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified recombinant protein appeared to be homogeneous by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1C).The aq065 Protein Has a tRNA (m7G46) Methyltransferase Activity—We tested the methyl transfer activity of the purified recombinant protein using yeast tRNAPhe transcript by the conventional filter assay. The time-dependent experiment at 60 °C clearly showed that 14C methyl group was incorporated into the transcript (data not shown). The kinetic parameters for yeast tRNAPhe transcript were determined at 50 and 60 °C (Table I). The initial velocity of the enzyme is comparable with other tRNA methyltransferases from A. aeolicus, such as tRNA (Gm18) methyltransferase (23Hori H. Kubota S. Watanabe K. Kim J.M. Ogasawara T.

Ikeuchi, S. Yokobori, T. Oshima, T. Suzuki, Y. Endo, and H. Hori, manuscript in preparation. However, the kinetic analysis revealed that this enzyme has relatively small Km and Vmax values for this transcript. The small Km may suggest that many more amino acid residues are involved in the substrate RNA recognition as compared with the other tRNA methyltransferases. This assumption is in line with the results using the mutant RNA variants described in “Results.” Furthermore, the slow Vmax may be caused by the relatively poor reactivity of N7 atom of the guanine (6Garcia G.R. Goodenough-Lashhua D.M. Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.

Yeast tRNAPhe transcript was methylated by aq065 protein using unlabeled AdoMet at 60 °C for 4 h. For nucleoside analysis, the methylated transcript was completely digested with nuclease P1 and bacterial alkaline phosphatase and then subjected to mass spectrometric analysis as described previously (49Hori H.

As shown in Fig. 2, m7G nucleoside was eluted at 18.8 min by LC. Mass signals of the protonated molecule of the m7G nucleoside (m/z = 298) and the fragment ion derived from the base moiety (m/z = 166) were clearly detected. The position of the modified site was determined by RNase T1 fragment mapping (Fig. 3). The methylated RNA was completely digested with RNase T1 and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. The fragments were separated on LC (Fig. 3A, top). When the guanine base was modified to m7G, RNase T1 did not cleave the site. As shown in Fig. 3A, the methylated fragment m7GUCCUGp (fragment 11 at 31 min) was clearly identified as a triple-charged negative ion (m/z = 1944.2). Fragment 11 corresponds to the nucleotides at positions 46–51 in the transcript (Fig. 3B). We also detected trace amounts of the unmodified fragment UCCUGp (fragment 9 at 30 min), indicating an incomplete m7G46 modification of the substrate tRNA (Fig. 3A). The methylation efficiency was estimated to be around 90% in this experiment. Furthermore, all other fragments derived from yeast tRNAPhe were analyzed (Fig. 3B), and no m7G modification was detected in any of them. Based on these results, we concluded that the aq065 protein has a tRNA (m7G46) methyltransferase activity. According to the nomenclature established for the E. coli gene encoding tRNA (m7G46) methyltransferase, we tentatively renamed aq065 as A. aeolicus yggH (accession number AB167817), although there is still some debate concerning the gene name of the E. coli enzyme as described by De Bie et al. (47De Bie L.G. Roovers M. Oudjama Y. Wattiez R. Tricot C. Stalon V. Droogmans L. Bujnicki J.M. J.

Carbon J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5542-5555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). First, we tested the effect of these RNAs on A. aeolicus YggH activity. We chose E. coli tRNAThr (GGU) precursor as a model because m7G46 modification of this precursor in living E. coli cells has been reported (57Chang S. Carbon J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5542-5555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We prepared E. coli tRNAThr precursor and the mature size transcript; a CCA sequence was added at 3′-end of the mature size transcript instead of the 3′-trailer sequence (Fig. 4A). The methyl transfer activities to them were compared with each other. As shown in Fig. 4B, both RNAs were efficiently methylated, and kinetic parameters for them were determined by the filter assay (Table II). Although the initial velocity for the precursor was slightly slower due to an increase in Km, it was not significantly different. The increase of Km for the precursor may be caused by nonspecific interaction of the enzyme with the 5′-leader and/or 3′-trailer RNAs. Thus, our results demonstrate that the 5′-leader and 3′-trailer RNAs are not required for substrate recognition of A. aeolicus YggH. Nevertheless, this modification to the precursor RNA probably occurs in vivo.Fig. 4Methyl transfer to E. coli tRNAThr precursor.

By using glutathione S-transferase pull-down techniques, we found that the β1AR carboxyl terminus directly interacts with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-associated ligand (CAL; also known as PIST, GOPC, and FIG), a protein known to be primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus. CAL contains two predicted coiled-coil domains and one PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1 homology (PDZ) domain. The β1AR carboxyl terminus (CT) binds to the PDZ domain of CAL, with the last few amino acids (ESKV) of the β1AR-CT being the key determinants for the interaction. Mutation of the terminal valine residue resulted in markedly reduced association of the β1AR-CT with CAL. Numerous other mutations to the ESKV motif also impaired the β1AR-CT/CAL interaction, suggesting that this motif is close to optimal for association with the CAL PDZ domain. In cells, full-length β1AR robustly associates with CAL, and this interaction is abolished by mutation of the terminal valine to alanine of the receptor (V477A), as determined by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and immunofluorescence co-localization studies. Consistent with observations that CAL is a Golgi-associated protein, overexpression of CAL reduces surface expression of β1AR. Interaction with CAL promotes retention of β1AR within the cell, whereas PSD-95, another β1AR-associated PDZ domain-containing protein, competitively blocks β1AR association with CAL and promotes receptor trafficking to the cell surface. These data reveal that CAL, a novel β1AR-binding partner, modulates β1AR intracellular trafficking, thereby revealing a new mechanism of regulation for β1AR anterograde trafficking through the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi complex to the plasma membrane.

Neither norepinephrine nor epinephrine can easily cross the plasma membrane; thus, β1AR must be localized at the cell surface in order to be activated by its ligands. The regulation of the trafficking and surface expression of β1AR and other GPCRs is therefore a topic of considerable physiological importance. Intracellular trafficking of GPCRs has been extensively studied, with most of this work focused on the events involved in receptor internalization and recycling. Within seconds or minutes of agonist stimulation, βARs are phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases and cAMP-dependent protein kinases (10Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 11Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Subsequently, in the cases of β1AR and β2AR, this phosphorylation promotes the binding of the cytosolic protein β-arrestin, which inhibits the ability of the βARs to couple to G proteins and targets the phosphorylated receptors to clathrin-coated pits for endocytosis. In the cytoplasm, the internalized receptors are first accumulated in early endosomes, dephosphorylated, and subsequently recycled back via a perinuclear compartment to the plasma membrane in a fully resensitized state (10Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 11Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). PDZ domain-containing scaffold proteins have recently been shown to modulate βAR intracellular trafficking via specific interactions with the carboxyl termini of β1AR and β2AR (12Hall R.A.

PDZ domains are named for the first three proteins in which they were identified (the post-synaptic density protein PSD-95, the Drosophila tumor suppressor protein Dlg, and the tight junction protein ZO-1), and are known to bind to their target proteins through specific carboxyl-terminal motifs (17Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF-1), a PDZ domain-containing protein, is known to associate with the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) to control β2AR-mediated regulation of Na+/H+ exchange (12Hall R.A.

Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). β1AR does not interact with NHERF-1 but rather associates with other PDZ proteins such as PSD-95, MAGI-2, GIPC, and CNrasGEF to regulate its intracellular trafficking and functional activity (14Hu L.A.

MAGI-2 and PSD-95 are structurally related PDZ proteins of the MAGUK subfamily, but nonetheless they exhibit diametrically opposing effects on agonist-induced β1AR internalization; MAGI-2 strongly promotes β1AR internalization (15Xu J.

Most studies on βAR trafficking have focused on the events involved in receptor internalization, recycling, and degradation (11Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), with much less attention devoted to how βARs are processed through post-ER pathways after their synthesis. A novel Golgi-associated PDZ protein termed CAL (for CFTR-associated ligand) has recently been found to modulate post-synthetic trafficking of CFTR (20Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J.

Most interestingly, CFTR exhibits a carboxyl-terminal motif similar to that of β1AR and β2AR (D/E(S/T)X(L/V)-COOH), and in fact CFTR and β2AR have both been found to associate avidly with NHERF-1 via this motif (12Hall R.A.

Given the similarity between the CFTR and βAR carboxyl termini, we considered the possibility that CAL might interact with one or both of the βARs to regulate the post-synthetic trafficking of the receptors. This idea was tested in the experiments described in the present report. Preparation of Plasmids and Fusion Proteins—HA-tagged CAL was kindly provided by William B. Guggino (The Johns Hopkins University). The hexahistidine- and S-tagged PDZ domains of CAL and PSD-95 PDZ3 were created via insertion of PCR products derived from a human CAL cDNA (encoding amino acids 270–455) and mouse PSD-95 cDNA (encoding amino acids 307–446) into pET-30A, respectively (Novagen), followed by expression and purification. NHERF-1 fusion proteins and FLAG-β1AR were made by the methods described previously (24He J. Lau A.G. Yaffe M.B. Hall R.A. J. Biol.

The β1AR carboxyl terminus (the last 30 amino acids of the human β1-adrenergic receptor, β1AR-CT) and β2AR carboxyl terminus (the last 90 amino acids of the human β2-adrenergic receptor, β2AR-CT) were amplified by PCR and then subcloned into pGEX-4T-1. Point mutations of both β1AR-CT and full-length FLAG-β1AR construct (V477A) were introduced by PCR and verified by sequencing. The myc-PSD-95 plasmid was a generous gift from Morgan Sheng (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Cell Culture and Transfection—All tissue culture medium and related reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. HEK-293 and COS-7 cells were maintained in complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. To express receptors in the absence or presence of PDZ proteins, 1 μg of total DNA was mixed with LipofectAMINE 2000 (15 μl) (Invitrogen) and added to 5 ml of complete medium in 10-cm tissue culture plates containing cells at ∼50–80% confluency. Following 4 h of incubation, fetal bovine serum was added to the medium to 10%, and cells were then harvested after 48 h. Western Blotting—Samples (30 μg per lane) were run on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 150 V and then transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were blocked in “blot buffer” (2% non-fat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) for at least 30 min and then incubated with primary antibody in blot buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed three times with 10 ml of blot buffer each and were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) in blot buffer. Finally, the blots were washed three more times with 10 ml of blot buffer each and were visualized via enzyme-linked chemiluminescence using the ECL kit (Pierce). GST Fusion Protein Pull-down Assay—GST fusion proteins were purified from bacteria using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma), according to the manufacturer's protocol, and were resuspended in PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors. Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins (conjugated on beads) were incubated with 1 ml of clarified whole cell extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with HACAL. After incubation at 4 °C with gentle rotation for 4 h, the beads were extensively washed with ice-cold PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Proteins were eluted from beads with SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. CAL was detected via Western blotting with the monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5, 1:3000) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:2000). Bands were visualized via chemiluminescence using the ECL kit (Pierce). Overlay Assay—The binding of receptor carboxyl-terminal GST fusion proteins to hexahistidine-tagged/S-tagged PDZ domain fusion proteins was assayed via a blot overlay technique. The receptor CT-GST fusion proteins (1 μg/lane) were run on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (NOVEX, San Diego), blotted, and overlaid with the hexahistidine-tagged/S-tagged PDZ domains (50 nm final concentration) in a buffer consisting of 2% milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (blot buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed three times with blot buffer, incubated with S-protein horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Novagen, 1:4000) for 1 h at room temperature, and visualized via chemiluminescence as described above. Immunoprecipitation—The method used for immunoprecipitation has been described previously (26He J. Xu J. Xu X.X. Hall R.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4524-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5% Triton X-100). After the lysate was solubilized and clarified, it was incubated with 30 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) for 2 h with end-over-end rotation at 4 °C. After washing three times, the immunoprecipitated proteins were visualized by Western blot analysis with antibodies to the FLAG epitope (anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody from Sigma) and/or antibodies to the HA epitope (anti-HA monoclonal antibody, 12CA5 from Roche Applied Science). Receptor Cell Surface Expression Assay—Transfected cells were grown in 35-mm dishes and incubated in the absence and presence of agonist. The cells were then rinsed in PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, and then rinsed three more times in PBS and blocked with blocking buffer (2% non-fat dry milk in PBS) for at least 30 min. The fixed cells were then incubated with primary antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The dishes were subsequently washed three times with 2 ml of blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in blocking buffer. Finally, the dishes were washed three times with 2 ml of blocking buffer and one time with 2 ml of PBS and incubated with 2 ml of ECL reagent (Pierce) for exactly 15 s. The luminescence, which corresponds to the amount of receptor on the cell surface, was determined by using a TD 20/20 luminometer (27He J. Xu J. Castleberry A.M. Lau A.G. Hall R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). CAL Is Identified as a Novel Binding Partner of β1AR-CT—β2AR and CFTR possess very similar carboxyl-terminal motifs (Fig. 1A) and are known to associate via these motifs with some of the same PDZ proteins, such as NHERF-1/EBP50 and NHERF-2/NHE3 kinase A regulatory protein (12Hall R.A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 3520-3529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) that CFTR can interact via its carboxyl-terminal motif with another PDZ protein, CAL, it seemed a reasonable possibility that β2AR might also associate with CAL. To test this hypothesis, we employed a fusion protein pull-down approach. The carboxyl termini of the human β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR-CT) and human β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR-CT) were prepared as GST fusion proteins. Equal amounts of these GST fusion proteins, along with GST alone, were adsorbed onto glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with cell extracts from COS-7 cells that had been transfected with HA-tagged CAL. As shown in Fig. 1B, GST-β2AR-CT did not detectably bind to CAL. Surprisingly, GST-β1AR-CT, which possesses a PDZ interaction motif less similar to that of CFTR, was found to robustly pull down CAL from the cell lysates under the same conditions. Thus, these studies revealed that β1AR-CT, but not β2AR-CT, can associate with CAL. The Carboxyl-terminal ESKV Motif of β1-AR Is Close to the Optimal Binding Sequence for the CAL PDZ Domain—We next explored the structural determinants of the β1AR-CT/CAL association. First, we individually mutated the last four residues of β1AR-CT to alanine and expressed these mutants as GST fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 2A, three of the four mutations, including Val at position 0, Ser at the -2 position, and Glu at the -3 position, resulted in almost complete elimination of β1AR-CT binding to CAL. Mutation of Lys at the -1 position to Ala also resulted in a markedly reduced β1AR/CAL interaction. Because little is presently known about the target binding specificity of the CAL PDZ domain, we further prepared a number of additional β1AR-CT point mutations. As shown in Fig. 2B, most of the mutations examined resulted in sharp reductions in the amount of CAL pulled down by the β1AR-CT. The conservative mutation of Ser at the -2 position to Thr was an exception, having only a modest effect on the interaction, but even this change resulted in a slight but consistent reduction in CAL pull-down by β1AR-CT. Mutation of Val at position 0 to either Phe or Leu also strongly reduced the β1AR-CT/CAL association. These results demonstrate that the last four residues of β1AR-CT are critical determinants for association with CAL, with the ESKV motif most likely being close to an ideal binding motif for the CAL PDZ domain. In addition to the fusion protein pull-down experiments, we also examined the interaction between β1AR-CT and CAL via a second technique, a blot overlay. A representative experiment of this type, examining more extensive mutations to the terminal amino acid of the β1AR-CT, is shown in Fig. 2C. Consistent with the GST pull-down results, overlaid fusion proteins corresponding to the CAL PDZ domain bound very well to blotted wild-type β1AR-CT, with mutation of the terminal Val to structurally similar amino acids such as Met, Ile, Leu, and Ala resulting in strong reductions in CAL binding to the β1AR-CT. In matching experiments, we also overlaid the blots with a fusion protein corresponding to NHERF-1, a PDZ protein that strongly prefers to bind to carboxyl-terminal motifs terminating in leucine (12Hall R.A.

As expected, NHERF-1 did not detectably associate with wild-type GST-β1AR-CT, but interestingly it robustly associated with the β1AR-CT mutant that had its terminal Val changed to Leu (ESKL). These data confirmed the specificity of the interactions of the CAL versus NHERF-1 PDZ domains with particular carboxyl-terminal motifs, and further established that CAL had a strong preference for binding to carboxyl termini such as β1AR-CT that terminate in Val. To assess the affinity of the β1AR/CAL interaction, saturation binding studies were performed (Fig. 2D). The binding affinity of CAL PDZ and β1AR-CT was estimated at 35 nm, revealing that this interaction is of relatively high affinity. β1AR Associates with CAL in Cells—To determine whether full-length β1AR might associate with CAL in a cellular context, COS-7 cells were co-transected with HA-CAL and FLAG-β1AR. Immunoprecipitation of β1AR followed by Western blotting for CAL revealed robust co-immunoprecipitation of a CAL-β1AR complex (Fig. 3A). Following a10-min stimulation with the selective β-adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol, the amount of co-immunoprecipitated CAL was not found to be significantly altered (Fig. 3A). The GST pull-down and blot overlay results indicated that Val-477, the last amino acid of the β1AR polypeptide, is a critical determinant of the CAL/β1AR association. To examine whether or not this was also the case in cells, we prepared the same mutation in the context of full-length β1AR, and we performed further co-immunoprecipitation experiments. As shown in Fig. 3B, the V477A mutation sharply reduced the ability of the receptor to co-immunoprecipitate CAL from cells. To explore whether the CAL/β1AR interaction could still be detected at endogenous levels of CAL expression, the experiments were repeated using the lysates from COS-7 cells that were transfected only with FLAG-β1AR. Endogenous CAL was detected using a commercially available anti-CAL antibody. As shown in Fig. 3C, endogenous CAL expression was detected in COS-7 cells, consistent with previous reports (29Yao R. Maeda T. Takada S. Noda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Wild-type β1AR was able to co-immunoprecipitate endogenous CAL, but the V477A mutant was not, indicating that the wild-type receptor but not the mutant associated with endogenous CAL in COS-7 cells. Moreover, Western blots of the post-immunoprecipitation lysates (not shown) revealed a significant depletion of CAL following immunoprecipitation of wild-type β1AR, indicating that a substantial fraction of cellular CAL was associated with β1AR in these studies. CAL Promotes Intracellular Retention of β1AR—To examine the subcellular localization of β1AR and CAL, fluorescence confocal microscopy studies were performed on HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with FLAG-β1AR and/or HA-CAL. In cells transfected with β1-adrenergic receptors alone, the receptors were located exclusively in the plasma membrane, as expected, forming a smooth rim around the cell (Fig. 4A). When HA-tagged CAL was expressed alone, it was observed predominantly in the cytoplasm as multiple spots (Fig. 4B), overlapping with the expression of the Golgi-associated protein GM 130 (data not shown). These data are consistent with observations reported previously (20Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E. Cutting G.R. Li M. Stanton B.A. Guggino W.B. J. Biol.

When β1AR was coexpressed with CAL, a significant fraction of total β1AR was retained in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4C), where it exhibited excellent co-localization with CAL (Fig. 4E). Conversely, when the β1AR V477A mutant was co-expressed with CAL, the mutant receptors remained almost exclusively distributed along the cell surface (Fig. 4F), exhibiting little overlap with CAL immunolabeling (Fig. 4H). Thus, CAL did not exhibit significant colocalization with the β1AR V477A mutant. To study the effects of CAL on β1AR trafficking to the plasma membrane in a more quantitative fashion, we transfected FLAG-β1AR in the absence and presence of HA-CAL into COS-7 cells, and we examined β1AR surface expression using a luminometer-based assay, which has been described previously (27He J. Xu J. Castleberry A.M. Lau A.G. Hall R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, β1AR surface expression was reduced by more than 60% upon co-expression with CAL, suggesting that the interaction between CAL and β1AR promotes retention of β1AR within the cell. Surface expression of the V477A β1AR mutant, in contrast, was not significantly reduced by co-expression with CAL. Most interestingly, surface expression of the V477A mutant alone was significantly higher than surface expression of the wil"

Aequorin, a jellyfish photoprotein with Ca2+-dependent luminescence, measures [Ca2+] in specific subcellular compartments wherein proteins with organelle-specific trafficking domains are fused in-frame to aequorin. Because of the presence of vesicular trafficking domain within CgA we engineered sorting of an expressed human CgA-Aequorin fusion protein (hCgA-Aeq) into the vesicle compartment as confirmed by sucrose density gradients and confocal immunofluorescent co-localization studies. hCgA-Aeq and cytoplasmic aequorin (Cyto-Aeq) luminescence displayed linear functions of [Ca2+] in vitro, over >5 log10 orders of magnitude (r > 0.99), and down to at least 10–7m sensitivity. Calibrating the pH dependence of hCgA-Aeq luminescence allowed estimation of [Ca2+]ves at granule interior pH (∼5.5).

The hCgA-Aeq chimera determined vesicular free [Ca2+]ves = 1.4 ± 0.3 μm under basal conditions indicating that >99% of granule total Ca2+ is in a “bound” state. The basal free [Ca2+]ves/[Ca2+]cyto ratio was thus ∼10.8-fold, indicating active, dynamic Ca2+ uptake from cytosol into the granules. Stimulation of exocytotic secretion revealed prompt, dynamic increases in both [Ca2+]ves and [Ca2+]cyto, and an exponential relation between the two (y = 0.99 × e(1.53x), r = 0.99), reflecting a persistent [Ca2+]ves/[Ca2+]cyto gradient, even during sharp increments of both values.

Catecholamine storage vesicles (chromaffin granules) contain quite substantial concentrations of catecholamines (∼0.6 m), adenosine triphosphate (ATP, ∼150 mm), Ca2+ (∼20–40 mm), and chromogranins (∼2–4 mm) in their soluble cores (1Winkler H.

The granule accumulation of Ca2+, at ∼20–40 mm total concentration, is in striking contrast to the ∼100 nm Ca2+ concentration in the cytosol, suggesting that a Ca2+ concentration gradient of up to ∼105-fold might occur across the granule membrane. However, little is known about the processes that might underlie Ca2+ accumulation in secretory granules, the fraction of granule Ca2+, which is free (versus bound) is not well understood, and no tools currently exist to measure [Ca2+] in situ within chromaffin granules in living cells. An increment in cytosolic [Ca2+] is a prerequisite for exocytotic secretion of catecholamines (4Douglas W.W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1968; 34: 453-474Crossref Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 5Mahata S.K.

The jellyfish photoprotein apoaequorin (∼21–22 kDa) forms a complex with its cofactor coelenterazine and molecular oxygen; binding of calcium at three specific aequorin sites permits oxidation of colenterazine to coelenteramide, yielding a photon at ∼466 nm by luminescence (20Chiesa A.

Such targeted recombinant aequorins provide the most specific means of monitoring free [Ca2+] in particular subcellular compartments.

Therefore, we reasoned that a CgA-Aequorin chimera would be trafficked to the chromaffin granules by using the N-terminal targeting information of CgA, and could then monitor free vesicular [Ca2+] under basal or secretion-stimulated conditions. Such a CgA-Aequorin chimera should be useful to probe questions about chromaffin cell Ca2+ that have remained elusive for decades, such as: (i) What is the free [Ca2+] in the core of chromaffin granules? (ii) Are chromaffin granule Ca2+ stores predominantly free or bound? (iii) How do chromaffin granule Ca2+ stores respond to secretory stimuli? (iv) What transporters underlie the accumulation of granular Ca2+? Our studies suggest that chromaffin granules actively accumulate Ca2+ against a substantial concentration gradient (vesicle/cytosol), that >99% of Ca2+ inside the vesicle remains in bound form, that vesicular [Ca2+] changes promptly in response to secretory stimulation, and that several discrete ion transporters in the granule membrane mediate these processes.

The aequorin-coding region (588 bp) was also amplified by PCR from the Cyto-Aeq plasmid using these forward (5′-CGGGGTACCTATGACCAGCGAACAATACTCAGTC-3′, containing the underlined KpnI site) and backward (5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGC GAGTTTCTTAGGGGACAGCTCCACCGTA-3′, containing the underlined NotI site) primers. Following digestion with EcoRI and KpnI, the hCgA PCR product was subcloned between the EcoRI and KpnI sites of the eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-N1 (containing the CMV immediate-early gene promoter; Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The KpnI/NotI-digested aequorin PCR product was subsequently ligated between the KpnI and NotI sites of the pEGFP-N1/hCgA plasmid, thereby replacing EGFP, resulting in the hCgA-Aeq plasmid wherein the human CMV promoter drives expression of the fused/in-frame hCgA-Aequorin chimera, with hCgA at the N terminus and aequorin at the C terminus. The correct in-frame fusion of aequorin at the downstream end of hCgA (hCgA-Aeq) was confirmed by sequencing the plasmid construct. Plasmids were grown in Escherichia coli, and supercoiled plasmid DNA molecules were purified using Qiagen columns (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA).

In brief, PC12 cells labeled with 1 μCi of l-[3H]norepinephrine for 3 h at 37 °C, washed twice with release buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES pH 7), and incubated for 20 min (at 37 or 8 °C) in release buffer with or without a secretagogue (60 μm nicotine, 100 μm ATP, 1 μm ionomycin, 2 mm BaCl2 or 55 mm KCl). In depolarization experiments, the secretion buffer contained 55 mm KCl and 100 mm NaCl. Precooled (8 °C) release buffer with or without secretagogue was used in low temperature experiments. In some experiments, the release buffer was supplemented with 400 mm sucrose. Supernatant was collected 20 min after treatment, and then the cells were exposed to lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES pH 7, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100). Release medium and cell lysates were assayed for [3H]norepinephrine by liquid scintillation counting, and results were expressed as % secretion: (amount released/(amount released + amount in cell lysate)) × 100. Net secretion is secretagogue-stimulated release minus basal release. For in vivo experiments, Cyto-Aeq or hCgA-Aeq -transfected PC12 cells were incubated with 5 μm coelenterazine for 1 h in growth medium at 37 °C for aequorin reconstitution (the process of conversion of apoaequorin into the active photoprotein aequorin via formation of a complex with the luminophore coelenterazine). Cells were washed thrice (5 min each) with modified Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB; 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na3PO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), scraped gently and suspended in the same KRB. In some experiments, transfected PC12 cells were incubated with coelenterazine in calcium-free KRB (125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na3PO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA) at 37 °C, washed, scraped gently, and suspended in the same calcium-free KRB. Cell suspensions in clear plastic polystyrene 12 × 47 mm tubes were treated with NH4Cl (1 mm), tyramine (1 mm), bafilomycin A1 (10 nm), thapsigargin (10 μm), amiloride (1 mm), ethyl isopropyl amiloride (10 μm), or KB-R7943 (10 μm) for 20 min at room temperature. The luminescence from Cyto-Aeq or hCgA-Aeq-transfected live cell suspension (mock versus treatment) was measured in the 37 °C-heated chamber of an ultra-sensitive, low noise luminometer with a 12W Peltier-cooled (8 °C) photomultiplier tube (PMT), a dark count rate of <100 cps (even at 20 °C), spectral sensitivity of 390–620 nm, 20 ns resolution, and quantum efficiency of 24% (AutoLumat LB 953, EG&G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany), with AutoLumat-PC-Control software in a desktop computer running DOS on an Intel Celeron RAM chip. The cells received secretagogues (60 μm nicotine, 60 mm KCl, 100 μm ATP, or 1 μm ionomycin) in KRB or calcium-free KRB through software-controlled injector ports. For measurement of aequorin luminescence under basal conditions KRB only was injected to the cell suspension. In experiments to inhibit exocytosis by low temperature, coelenterazine-reconstituted hCgA-Aeq-expressing PC12 cells were precooled to 8 °C before secretagogue exposure. In experiments to inhibit exocytosis by hyperosmolarity, hCgA-Aeq-expressing PC12 cells were exposed to secretagogues in KRB buffer supplemented with 400 mm sucrose. Luminescence before and after injection of a secretagogue was recorded by the PMT and saved in a Kaleidagraph spreadsheet. At the conclusion of the experiment, activated (unoxidized) aequorin still remaining inside the cells was determined by cell lysis in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2 and 0.05% Triton X-100. For in vitro calibration of aequorin luminescence with respect to free [Ca2+], Cyto-Aeq- or hCgA-Aeq-expressing PC12 cells were reconstituted with coelenterazine (5 μm) in calcium-free KRB, washed with calcium-free KRB, and lysed in calcium-free KRB with 0.05% Triton X-100. The cell lysates (100 μl) were mixed with 100 μl of EGTA-buffered Ca2+ solutions (using the on-line MaxChelator program www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/maxc.html), to achieve a range of specific, free [Ca2+] in the final solution), followed by recording of the light emission. The rate of light emission (photon counts per second) was recorded just after addition of a Ca2+ buffer (L). After 1 min, the cell lysate was exposed to a saturating calcium solution (10 mm CaCl2 in 0.05% Triton X-100) and the recording was continued until the light emission returned to baseline. The luminescence signal at each point of the experiment was normalized by Lmax, the integral of photon counts from that point to the end of the experiment (32Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). For in vitro calibration of aequorin luminescence with respect to pH, hCgA-Aeq transfected PC12 cell lysate (100 μl) was mixed with 100 μl of 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, and one of the following non-calcium-interacting buffers at 25 mm: MES, pH 5.4; MOPS, pH 6.0; HEPES, pH 7.2, Tris, pH 8.2; glycine, pH 9.6, containing either 0.2 mm or 10 mm CaCl2, followed by recording of luminescence. Indo-1/AM loading solution was freshly prepared as follows: A 50-μg aliquot of Indo-1/AM (Molecular Probes) was mixed with 1.5 μl of a 20% (w/v) Pluronic® F127 solution (low toxicity dispersing agent; Molecular Probes) and 14.5 μl of Me2SO, yielding a 3 mm solution of Indo-1/AM. This was diluted 1:1000 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To load the cells with Indo-1, PC12 cells grown on LabTek 4-chamber slides having 1 German borosilicate cover glass floor (Nunc) were incubated with 500 μl of loading solution per well at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 30 min. After rinsing the cells with KRB, the LabTek chamber was mounted on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot microscope that was interfaced to a Solamere Technologies dual emission photometry system. Excitation was provided by a 100 W mercury lamp and an Indo-1 excitation filter set from Chroma, which features an excitation filter centered at λex = 365 nm with a band-pass of 5 nm. A 380 nm dichroic long-pass beam splitter was used under the nose cone of the microscope to separate the excitation and emission fluorescence light pathways. The emission path was split and monitored using separate photomultiplier tubes with band pass emission filters centered at λem = 405/30 nm or λem = 485/25, for channel 1 or channel 2, respectively. Data were collected at room temperature at an acquisition rate of 4 Hz with equal gain settings on each channel via a MacLab interface and Power MacIntosh computer using Chart 3.5 software. For typical experimental runs, the cells were placed in 300 μl of buffer per well. Basal recordings of Indo-1 fluorescence were made from the field of view afforded by a 100× oil-immersion objective. The fields were ∼50% confluent and the signals corresponded to data obtained simultaneously from several cells (∼20 to 40 per field). Chemicals (e.g. nicotine, ATP) were typically added as 300 μl of a 2× stock solution. Following determinations of basal and secretagogue-induced changes in Indo-1 fluorescence, the cells were placed in buffer containing no added calcium with 3 mm EGTA. After ∼3 min, this was replaced with a buffer containing no added calcium, with 3 mm EGTA and 10 μm ionomycin. Stable Rmin values (Indo-1 emission signals at 405 and 485 nm) were obtained within 20 min. During the equilibration with 3 mm EGTA and ionomycin, excitation was intermittent to prevent excessive photo-bleaching. This buffer was then replaced by a buffer containing 10 mm calcium and 10 μm ionomycin to achieve the Rmax (equilibration with this buffer was typically achieved within 2 min). Following determination of Rmin and Rmax, the buffer was replaced by a buffer containing 10 mm MnCl2, which quenches all Indo-1 fluorescence, resulting in a determination of autofluorescence and background illumination for the field; photomultiplier outputs in the presence of MnCl2 were subtracted from the previously obtained data for each run, post-hoc. The fluorescence emission (F405/F485) Indo-1 ratio was calibrated to [Ca2+]cyto by the equation: [Ca2+]i = Kdβ(R – Rmin)/(Rmax – R), where the Kd of Indo-1 for calcium was assumed to be 250 nm on the basis of several published reports documenting identical or quite similar Kd values in physiological buffers having ionic strength of ∼150 mm and pH of ∼7.0 (33Grynkiewicz G.

https://openalex.org/W2067552563,"Fibrillar collagens are involved in the formation of striated fibrils and are present from the first multicellular animals, sponges, to humans. Recently, a new evolutionary model for fibrillar collagens has been suggested (Boot-Handford, R. P., Tuckwell, D. S., Plumb, D. A., Farrington Rock, C., and Poulsom, R. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 31067–31077). In this model, a rare genomic event leads to the formation of the founder vertebrate fibrillar collagen gene prior to the early vertebrate genome duplications and the radiation of the vertebrate fibrillar collagen clades (A, B, and C). Here, we present the modular structure of the fibrillar collagen chains present in different invertebrates from the protostome Anopheles gambiae to the chordate Ciona intestinalis. From their modular structure and the use of a triple helix instead of C-propeptide sequences in phylogenetic analyses, we were able to show that the divergence of A and B clades arose early during evolution because α chains related to these clades are present in protostomes. Moreover, the event leading to the divergence of B and C clades from a founder gene arose before the appearance of vertebrates; altogether these data contradict the Boot-Handford model. Moreover, they indicate that all the key steps required for the formation of fibrils of variable structure and functionality arose step by step during invertebrate evolution. Fibrillar collagens are involved in the formation of striated fibrils and are present from the first multicellular animals, sponges, to humans. Recently, a new evolutionary model for fibrillar collagens has been suggested (Boot-Handford, R. P., Tuckwell, D. S., Plumb, D. A., Farrington Rock, C., and Poulsom, R. (2003) J. Biol.

Moreover, they indicate that all the key steps required for the formation of fibrils of variable structure and functionality arose step by step during invertebrate evolution. Fibrillar collagens are present from sponges to humans and are the primary component of striated fibrils (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 2Exposito J.Y. Cluzel C. Garrone R. Lethias C. Anat. Rec. 2002; 268: 302-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A fibrillar procollagen molecule is made of three identical or different pro-α chains. Each pro-α chain contains a central triple helix made of ∼338 Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplets flanked by non-collagenous telopeptide regions, which in turn are flanked by the N- and C-propeptides. The C-propeptide is known to contain the most conserved regions of the fibrillar α chains. This domain is involved in α chain recognition and in the registration of the major triple helical domain, an important step preceding elongation of the triple helix from the carboxyl to the amino terminus. In vertebrates, a short region of the C-propeptide appears to be involved in chain recognition (3Lees J.F. Tasab M. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Recently, Boot-Handford and Tuckwell (4Boot-Handford R.P. Tuckwell D.S. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) indicated that most of this recognition sequence is absent in all invertebrate fibrillar chains characterized to date. During the extracellular maturation of procollagen molecules, the propeptides are generally removed by specific proteinases. The resultant collagen molecules participate in fibril formation.In humans, fibrillar collagens are subdivided quantitatively into major (types I-III) and minor (types V/XI) collagens. According to the collagen types incorporated into the fibrils and their ratio, the partial processing of the N-propeptide, and interactions with other extracellular matrix components, the shape and functional properties of the fibrils can vary. The importance of quantitatively minor collagens in the regulation of fibril diameter has been pointed out in several studies (5Birk D.E. Fitch J.M. Babiarz J.P. Doane K.J. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 649-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Linsenmayer T.F. Gibney E. Igoe F. Gordon M.K. Fitch J.M. Fessler L.I. Birk D.E. J.

Fessler L.I. Birk D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), the retention of the type V N-propeptide at the surface of types I/V heterotypic fibrils is one of the key elements regulating the diameter of these fibrils.From phylogenetic studies and the exon/intron organization, it has been shown that vertebrate fibrillar collagens can be divided into two clades (8Takahara K. Hoffman G.G. Greenspan D.S. Genomics. 1995; 29: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Sicot F.X. Exposito J.Y. Masselot M. Garrone R. Deutsch J. Gaill F. Eur. J.

Moreover, the α chains of the A and B clades possess a vWc 1The abbreviations used are: vWc, von Willebrand factor-type C; TSPN, thrombospondin amino-terminal-like domain; contig, group of overlapping clones; EST, expressed sequence tag.1The abbreviations used are: vWc, von Willebrand factor-type C; TSPN, thrombospondin amino-terminal-like domain; contig, group of overlapping clones; EST, expressed sequence tag. and a TSPN module in their N-propeptide, respectively, in addition to a minor triple helix. It should be noted that the A clade pro-α2(I) chain presents a short N-propeptide reduced to the minor triple helix.Recently, COL24A1 and COL27A1 have been characterized (11Koch M. Laub F. Zhou P.

Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These two genes encode collagen chains belonging to a new fibrillar collagen group, the C clade. They contain a C-propeptide, a major triple helix, and an N-propeptide including a TSPN module but not a minor triple helix. Moreover, the major triple helix is shorter than that of classical fibrillar collagens and presents several imperfections in the Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplet repeat. It has been suggested that vertebrate fibrillar collagens share a single common ancestor that arose at the very dawn of the vertebrate world and prior to the genome duplication events (4Boot-Handford R.P. Tuckwell D.S. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 12Boot-Handford R.P. Tuckwell D.S. Plumb D.A. Rock C.F. Poulsom R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31067-31077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). From invertebrate data, these authors have argued that this ancestor possesses a vWc module in its N-propeptide, a major triple helix, and a C-propeptide lacking most of the elongated chain selection sequence. The founder vertebrate fibrillar would have acquired this sequence and the characteristics of A clade members. Duplication of this gene and the swapping of the exon encoding the vWc module for that encoding a TSPN domain would permit the formation of the B clade. The most recent clade, the C, would then have arisen from the B clade after the deletion of the elongated chain selection sequence. This model is clearly distinct from our previous studies indicating that some invertebrate collagens are more closely related to B clade than A clade collagens (14Exposito J.Y. Garrone R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6669-6673Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Exposito J.Y. van der Rest M. Garrone R. J. Mol.

Moreover, it is difficult to understand how a sequence can be gained from invertebrates to vertebrates and then be lost during the divergence of the C clade from the B clade. One explanation for this conundrum is that almost all the invertebrate fibrillar chains described to date are quantitatively major ones and that, like their vertebrate counterparts, they possess a vWc module in their N-propeptide. However, we have recently shown that sea urchin also possesses a quantitatively minor fibrillar collagen chain (17Cluzel C. Lethias C. Garrone R. Exposito J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9811-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).In this study, we present evidence arguing against the Boot-Handford et al. model (4Boot-Handford R.P. Tuckwell D.S. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 12Boot-Handford R.P. Tuckwell D.S. Plumb D.A. Rock C.F. Poulsom R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31067-31077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and indicating that the A and B/C clades arose early during evolution. These data suggest that the diversity of the vertebrate fibrillar collagens and subsequently fibril diversity are due not to a rare genomic event but instead to a step-by-step evolutionary process from the most primitive animal to humans, which corresponds to the maximum parsimony hypothesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGenomic Cloning and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR of Paracentrotus lividus Sequences Encoding Fibrillar Collagens—A search of sea urchin genes encoding fibrillar collagen α chains was conducted at the Human Genome Sequencing Center Web site (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) using the C-propeptide sequence from the Strongylocentrotus purpuratus 1α chain (18Exposito J.Y. D'Alessio M. Solursh M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15559-15562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The URL of this center is www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu. From this analysis, we were able to discover two regions of the S. purpuratus genome encoding the C terminus of a classical C-propeptide distinct from the three previously characterized sea urchin fibrillar collagen chains (17Cluzel C. Lethias C. Garrone R. Exposito J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9811-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 18Exposito J.Y. D'Alessio M. Solursh M. Ramirez F. J. Biol.

The two sequence files corresponded to Contig18666 and Contig84214 and encoded part of the fibrillar collagens termed 6α and 7α, respectively, in this study. To characterize the ortholog genes in the sea urchin P. lividus, we first amplified by PCR (30 cycles) the most 3′-exon of these two genes using 500 ng of S. purpuratus genomic DNA and the Taq Expand polymerase kit (Roche Applied Science). The oligonucleotides used for this amplification (6α sense primer GCATCGTCCAACTGACGTTC, 6α antisense primer GACTCTTAGGTTGATAGAGG, 7α sense primer GTCCATTTTCACTCTGAGGTCC, and 7α antisense primer GGTCCATAGTGACCTTGCTC) were synthesized by Sigma Genosys. The two amplified fragments were used to screen 80,000 genomic clones from P. lividus at moderate stringency as described previously (20Cluzel C. Lethias C. Humbert F. Garrone R. Exposito J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18108-18114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Shotgun sequencing of positive genomic clones for each PCR probe used permitted us to obtain sequences encoding the last Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplets and the C terminus of the P. lividus 6α and 7α chains. At this point, reverse transcriptase-PCR was conducted using total RNA extracted from peristome tissues. For the 6α chain, a 1206-bp fragment product was amplified with sense primer CTGAAGGACCACGTGGTGTAATG and antisense primer CGCGACTGATTCGACCTTACTG. For the 7α chain, sense primer GGTTCAGCTGGTGCAAAAGGACAAAG and antisense primer GAGTCGTTCATATTCTTCTAGCACG permitted a 1034-bp fragment to be generated. PCR conditions, purification, cloning, and sequencing of PCR fragments were carried out as described previously (20Cluzel C. Lethias C. Humbert F. Garrone R. Exposito J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18108-18114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Searches of S. purpuratus genomic sequences were also conducted using the TSPN sequence from the human pro-α1(V) chain. This led to the identification of two contigs (Contig3949 and Contig50826) that might encode two TSPN modules related to fibrillar collagens of the B/C clade as suggested from Blast analysis. EST analysis using the human pro-α1(V) TSPN module was conducted using another sea urchin Web server (goblet.molgen.mpg.de/cgi-bin/blast-seaurchin.cgi?db=urchibase) at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics (Berlin, Germany). This analysis led to the identification of an EST (StrPu691.007800) encoding a TSPN module, which gives the best score with human α1(IX) collagen during Blast analysis.Accession Numbers—Protein sequences of fibrillar collagens were obtained from the European Bioinformatics Institute (www.ebi.ac.uk/).

Overlapping ESTs covering the complete coding sequence were available for ci0100150759 (cilv051j16, citb048m08, citb058a23, citb059g23, citb066c17, citb073c06, citb075p17, citb077j05, citb100l05, and citb41d02) and ci0100154301 (ciad097j13, ciad101m17, ciad19b03, ciad20c22, cicl062k24, ciht038b02, cilv063m20, citb046p23, citb087a11, and rcitb081p22). Several ESTs covering part of the coding region were obtained for ci0100131606 (rcilv051d20, rciad06f06, citb10e10, citb066j05, citb048f05, and cigd010e18) and ci0100144916 (rcitb31h13, rcitb064m18, ciad68o20, and ciht012m05). The coding regions of ci0100131606 and ci0100144916 that were not confirmed by ESTs were deduced by their similarity to comparable regions of fibrillar collagens characterized to date and from similarities to Ciona savignyi ortholog genes. For this purpose, sequences from these two C. intestinalis genes were used to investigate the C. savignyi genome at NCBI. For A. gambiae, two fibrillar collagen genes were identified, namely ENSANGT00000019179 and ENSANGP00000021001. For A. mellifera, two fibrillar collagen genes were also found by Blast searches at NCBI and named in this study: Api-1 and Api-2. Accession numbers of the genomic contigs including Api-1 and Api-2 are AADG02012353 and AADG030117591 (for Api-1) and AADG02005865 (for Api-2).

Ungapped alignments were computed to derive trees according to neighbor joining and maximum parsimony methods using the Phylo win program (23Galtier N. Gouy M. Gautier C. Comput. Appl.

Lethias C. Garrone R. Exposito J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9811-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 18Exposito J.Y. D'Alessio M. Solursh M. Ramirez F. J. Biol.

They can be divided quantitatively into major (1α and 2α) and minor (5α) collagen chains (17Cluzel C. Lethias C. Garrone R. Exposito J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9811-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Blast searching of the S. purpuratus genome resources using a sequence encoding the 1α C-propeptide allowed us to identify two genomic sequences encoding the C-terminal part of the C-propeptides unrelated to those of the three known sea urchin fibrillar collagens. Using these sequences, we have been able to determine the last Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplets and the complete C-propeptide sequences of two fibrillar-like α chains (6α and 7α) in the sea urchin P. lividus (see “Experimental Procedures”). The unique feature of these two C-propeptides is their unusual length (344 and 308 residues for 6α and 7α, respectively), with the additional sequence located between the end of the triple helix and the most amino-terminal cysteine residue (number 1) of the C-propeptide (data not shown).B Clade Fibrillar Collagen Is Present in ProtostomesTo investigate invertebrate fibrillar collagen chains, we used C-propeptide sequences from human pro-α1(I), pro-α1(V), and pro-α1(XXVII) chains to analyze the genome of three invertebrates. Two of them are the protostomes A. gambiae and A. mellifera, whereas the third is an invertebrate chordate, the ascidian C. intestinalis. For the two protostomes and the ascidian, two and four fibrillar α chains were deduced respectively from genomic data. The schematic structures of the A. gambiae and C. intestinalis α chains in addition to other invertebrate α chains and members of the three vertebrate clades are presented in Fig. 1.In the protostome A. gambiae, the two genes encoding the fibrillar α chains have been named AgFα1 and AgFα2 (Table I). As shown in Fig. 1, the modular structures of the AgFα1 and AgFα2 chains are similar to those of vertebrate A and B clades, respectively. Hence, AgFα1 encodes an N-propeptide including a vWc module, whereas AgFα2 encodes an N-propeptide including a TSPN module and a minor triple helix. Moreover, the most C-terminal cysteine residue (cysteine 8) of the AgFα2 C-propeptide is followed by three amino acids as in the fibrillar α chains of the B clade. As in mosquito, two fibrillar collagen genes are present in the honeybee A. mellifera (Api-1 and Api-2). One of them (Api-2) encodes an α chain including a TSPN module and a minor triple helix in its N-propeptide (not shown). These results indicated that the formation of the B clade arose early during evolution.The four C. intestinalis genes encoding fibrillar α chains have been named Ci759, Ci301, Ci606, and Ci916 (Table I). As shown in Fig. 1 and as in protostomes, C. intestinalis possesses two fibrillar α chains similar in their modular structure to vertebrate A and B clades, encoded by Ci759 and Ci301, respectively. These similarities were also observed for the exon/intron organization of the genomic region encoding the major triple helix (Fig. 2A). Hence, the Ci759 exon-intron organization is more closely related to the A clade than the B–C clades, whereas that of Ci301 has closer similarity to the B clade. One special feature of Ci759 is the presence of two exons of 100 and 62 bp in length corresponding to a 162-bp exon in the A clade. Insertion of an intronic sequence between the two first bases of a glycine codon in a 162-bp exon might explain this special feature (Fig. 2A). EST (citb100l05) covering these exons confirms the splice junctions. A special feature of Ci301 is the presence of two 54-bp exons separated by an intervening sequence of 37 bp. Several ESTs (cilv063m20, citb072k01 and ciad11e06) covering this region indicated a mutual alternative use of these exons leading to the potential production of two α chain isoforms, including a 1014 amino acid triple helix.Fig. 2Exon/intron organization of collagen genes.A, alignment of the genomic region encoding the major triple helix of C. intestinalis, A. gambiae, and prototype members of α chains of the A–C vertebrate clades. The putative structure of an ancestral fibrillar collagen gene is also presented. At the top the triple helical sequences chosen for the phylogenetic studies are indicated. Our first choice was to use the most conserved and specific pattern of exons between all the aligned genes (white box). A multiple alignment of all the complete major triple helix confirmed the relationships between these chains in this region. Moreover, this multiple alignment permits us to extend the sequence in 5′ and 3′ of our first choice (thick black line). B, the exon/intron organization of A. mellifera collagen genes is aligned with a prototype gene of the B clade. The gene names are indicated at the right of their exon/intron organization. Arabic numbers indicate the length of the exons in bp. For the exon junctions, the length of the sequence coding for the triple helix is followed by a plus. G/GX represents exons beginning with the second base of a glycine codon. The exons discussed in the text are lightly shaded. Boxes that are shaded darkly indicate similar exon-intron organization between genes discussed in the text.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The third C. intestinalis gene, Ci606, encodes an α chain sharing several features of the vertebrate α chains of the C clade. Hence, the N-propeptide of Ci606 contains a TSPN module but not a minor triple helix. Moreover, the major triple helix of Ci606 is composed of 990 residues and presents several imperfections (Fig. 1). Finally, the exon/intron organization of the region encoding the major triple helix of Ci606 is closely related to the C clade (Fig. 2A). However, the Ci606 exon/intron organization also reminds the B clade. For the last C. intestinalis α chain, Ci916, we have not been able to identify the primary structure of the N-propeptide. The major triple helix is shorter, 996 residues in length, and contains two Gly-Xaa-Yaa-Xaa-Yaa and one Gly-Xaa imperfections, but also five glycine substitutions (Fig. 1).Phylogenetic StudiesHuman Fibrillar Collagens—Previous studies clearly indicated that human collagens could be divided into three clades (9Sicot F.X.

Poulsom R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31067-31077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The A and B clades are linked to the HOX and Notch paralogons, respectively (2Exposito J.Y. Cluzel C. Garrone R. Lethias C. Anat. Rec. 2002; 268: 302-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 24Bailey W.J. Kim J. Wagner G.P. Ruddle F.H. Mol. Biol.

From their exon/intron organizations, the presence of a TSPN module in their N-propeptide and phylogenetic analyses, the C clade is more closely related to the B clade than the A clade (11Koch M. Laub F. Zhou P. Hahn R.A. Tanaka S. Burgeson R.E. Gerecke D.R. Ramirez F. Gordon M.K. J. Biol.

This relationship is confirmed at the genomic level because COL24A1 and COL27A1 belong to the NOTCH or 1/9/19p paralogon (26Popovici C. Leveugle M. Birnbaum D. Coulier F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 362-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Use of Triple Helix Instead of C-propeptide in Phylogenetic Analyses—Most of the phylogenic studies done on fibrillar collagens have used the C-propeptide sequences and more often the conserved regions of this domain (9Sicot F.X. Exposito J.Y. Masselot M. Garrone R. Deutsch J. Gaill F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 12Boot-Handford R.P. Tuckwell D.S. Plumb D.A. Rock C.F. Poulsom R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31067-31077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Until now, the C-propeptide domain has been defined as the most conserved region of fibrillar collagens. However, with the increase in invertebrate data, the robustness of this definition is less convincing. Hence, except for short regions of conserved sequences around the cysteine residues, the C-propeptide contains long stretches of poorly conserved sequences, especially in the region that contains the chain recognition sequence (see Fig. 3A). Moreover, the size of this domain is very variable (Fig. 1). For this reason, we decided to use in our phylogenetic analyses the major triple helical sequences in addition to the C-propeptide domain. Fig. 2 illustrates the correspondence between the exons encoding the major triple helix of human and invertebrate fibrillar α chains. With the exception of the 5′- and 3′-genomic regions, a perfect alignment can be made between them. In the case of the honeybee genes (Fig. 2B), the discrepancies arise probably from the insertion of new introns, as suggested by the presence of introns between the first two bases of the Gly codons.Fig. 3Multiple alignment of the C-propeptide.A, part of the C-propeptide alignment obtained using human, sea urchin, ascidian, lugworm, and mosquito sequences.

To elucidate the molecular mechanism for this dual effect, we expressed the DAT and selected mutants in Xenopus laevis oocytes and applied the two-electrode voltage clamp technique together with substrate flux studies employing radiolabeled tracers. Under voltage clamp conditions we found that Zn2+ (10 μm) enhanced the current induced by both DA and amphetamine. This was not accompanied by a change in the uptake rate but by a marked increase in the charge/DA flux coupling ratio as assessed from concomitant measurements of [3H]DA uptake and currents in voltage-clamped oocytes. These data suggest that Zn2+ facilitates an uncoupled ion conductance mediated by DAT. Whereas this required substrate in the wild type (WT), we observed that Zn2+ by itself activated such a conductance in a previously described mutant (Y335A). This signifies that the conductance is not strictly dependent on an active transport process. Ion substitution experiments in Y335A, as well as in WT, indicated that the uncoupled conductance activated by Zn2+ was mainly carried by Cl–. Experiments in oocytes under non-voltage-clamped conditions revealed furthermore that Zn2+ could enhance the depolarizing effect of substrates in oocytes expressing WT. The data suggest that by potentiating an uncoupled Cl– conductance, Zn2+ is capable of modulating the membrane potential of cells expressing DAT and as a result cause simultaneous inhibition of uptake and enhancement of efflux.

The dopamine transporter (DAT) 1The abbreviations used are: DAT, human dopamine transporter; WT, wild type; DA, dopamine; AMPH, amphetamine; TM, transmembrane segment(s); MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. belongs to the family of Na+/Cl–-coupled transporters and plays a key role in termination of dopaminergic signaling by mediating reuptake of dopamine (DA) released into the synaptic cleft (1Norregaard L.

Neurosci. 2003; 4: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar), amphetamines are substrates that are actively transported by the DAT (5Wall S.C. Gu H. Rudnick G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 544-550PubMed Google Scholar, 6Sitte H.H. Huck S. Reither H. Boehm S. Singer E.A. Pifl C. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Interestingly, DAT is capable not only of Na+-dependent transmembrane uptake but also of mediating dopamine efflux (7Pifl C. Drobny H. Reither H. Hornykiewicz O. Singer E.A. Mol.

This can be observed under membrane depolarizing conditions or it can be elicited by extracellular substrates (7Pifl C. Drobny H. Reither H. Hornykiewicz O. Singer E.A. Mol.

The latter has been suggested to play a significant role for the addictive and reinforcing properties of amphetamine derivatives (9Attwell D. Barbour B. Szatkowski M.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1979-1986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has moreover been suggested that reverse transport of DA via the DAT is responsible for nonexocytotic, Ca2+-independent release of DA in the substantia nigra upon excitation of glutaminergic neurons projecting from the subthalamic nucleus (11Falkenburger B.H. Barstow K.L. Mintz I.M. Science. 2001; 293: 2465-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Transport of substrate by DAT is an electrogenic process involving co-transport of two Na+ and one Cl– (12Gu H. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. J. Biol.

Accordingly, several groups have described DAT-mediated currents in heterologous expression systems (6Sitte H.H. Huck S. Reither H. Boehm S. Singer E.A. Pifl C. J.

Interestingly, the electrophysiological analyses have revealed several conducting states in the DAT. These include, in addition to the substrate-transport coupled current, a substrate-dependent uncoupled conductance and a tonic leak that is blocked by cocaine (14Sonders M.S. Zhu S.J. Zahniser N.R.

Altogether, the electrophysiological studies have challenged the classical alternating access model (26Jardetzky O. Nature. 1966; 211: 969-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar) for the function of this class of transporters, and other models have consequently been proposed emphasizing a possible similarity between Na+-coupled transporters and ion channels (27DeFelice L.J. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 352-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the DAT we have previously identified an extracellular high affinity Zn2+-binding site (28Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36928-36934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Because the extracellular concentration of free Zn2+ in the brain can raise to 10–30 μm upon neuronal stimulation (30Vogt K. Mellor J. Tong G. Nicoll R.

Its existence was deduced from the observation that Zn2+ is a potent noncompetitive inhibitor of [3H]DA uptake both in synaptosomes (33Richfield E.K. Mol.

We reasoned that Zn2+ upon binding to the DAT imposed a conformational constraint on the transporter that blocked conformational changes critical for the translocation process (28Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Recent studies have, however, suggested a more complex action of Zn2+ at the DAT. In contrast to our expectations, we found that Zn2+ did not slow efflux but rather enhanced AMPH-induced efflux of the substrate MPP+ (methyl-phenyl-pyridinium) both in transfected cells and in striatal slices (34Scholze P. Norregaard L. Singer E.A. Freissmuth M. Gether U. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21505-21513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This identified Zn2+ as the first known modulator of DAT that differentially modulates inward and outward transport; nonetheless, the underlying molecular mechanism remained elusive. Pifl et al. (35Pifl C. Rebernik P. Kattinger A. Reither H. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 46: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have recently corroborated our observations and moreover observed that Zn2+ unexpectedly enhanced the substrate-induced current in HEK-293 cells expressing the DAT (35Pifl C. Rebernik P. Kattinger A. Reither H. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 46: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Here we further explore the effects of Zn2+ on the DAT by application of the two-electrode voltage clamp method in Xenopus laevis oocytes. We provide evidence that, in the presence of substrates, Zn2+ potentiates an uncoupled Cl– conductance mediated by DAT that enhances substrate-dependent membrane depolarization. We propose that potentiation of the uncoupled Cl– conductance is critical for Zn2+-induced inhibition of DA uptake and Zn2+-induced enhancement of carrier-mediated substrate efflux. Altogether, the data support a new principle for modulation of a Na+/Cl–-coupled transporter; hence, Zn2+ is the first example of an allosteric modulator that can regulate transporter function by potentiating a specific uncoupled ion conductance. Molecular Biology and Expression in Xenopus leavis Oocytes—The cDNA of the human DAT (WT) and the mutants H193A (28Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), Y335A, and H193A/Y335A (36Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Litman T. Gether U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) were cloned into the oocyte expression vector pNB1, a vector optimized for oocyte expression (37MacAulay N. Bendahan A. Loland C.J. Zeuthen T. Kanner B.I. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40476-40485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were linearized downstream of the poly(A) segment and in vitro transcribed with the T7 RNA polymerase using the mCAP mRNA capping kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (37MacAulay N.

The resulting cRNA (50 ng/oocyte) was injected into defoliculated stage VI X. laevis oocytes. After incubation in Kulori medium (90 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for 6–9 days at 21 °C, experiments were performed (38Meinild A.K. Loo D.D. Hirayama B.A. Gallardo E. Wright E.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11897-11904Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Electrophysiology—The two-microelectrode voltage clamp method was used for recording of whole cell currents in oocytes essentially as described (38Meinild A.K. Loo D.D. Hirayama B.A. Gallardo E. Wright E.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11897-11904Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The CA-1B high performance oocyte clamp (Dagan Corporation) interfaced to an IBM-compatible PC via a DigiData 1200 A/D converter and pCLAMP 8.0/9.0 (Axon Instruments) were used to control the membrane potential and other parameters. Electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries to a resistance of 0.5–2 MΩ and were filled with 2 m KCl. For the experiments, the oocyte was impaled with the two electrodes, the membrane potential (Vhold) was clamped to –40 mV, and the experimental chamber was continuously perfused with the NaCl buffer (see below) until a stable base-line current was obtained. For continuous holding current measurements, the membrane potential was held at –60 mV or as otherwise stated, and currents were low pass-filtered at 1 Hz and sampled at 10 Hz. Steady-state current/voltage (I-V) relations were obtained by a pulse protocol of 100-ms voltage jumps from the holding potential (Vhold of –40 mV) to a series of test potentials from +60 to –140 mV in steps of 20 mV. The currents were low pass-filtered at 500 Hz and sampled at 10 kHz. The steady-state current was the average of 3 runs from 50 to 100 ms. The steady-state substrate-induced current was defined as the current measured in the presence of substrate minus the current measured in the corresponding control buffer (Isubstrate – Icontrol). The NaCl buffer contained 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. In experiments with low [Cl–], NaCl was exchanged by NaMES or sodium glucuronate, and the reference electrode was connected to the experimental chamber through an agar bridge (3% of agar in 3 m KCl). In the nitrate exchange experiments, 50 mm of the NaCl was exchanged with 50 mm of NaNO3. In Na+-free buffer, NaCl was exchanged by 100 mm choline-Cl or by N-methyl-glucosamine. [3H]DA Uptake Experiments—Uptake experiments were performed in 24-well plates using a concentration of 1.25 μm DA ([3H]DA, 16.8 μCi/well; specific activity, 5.8 Ci/mmol Amersham) added to a total of 400 μl NaCl buffer and various concentrations of Zn2+. The oocytes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, washed three times in 1 ml of ChoCl buffer, and dissolved in 200 μl of 10% SDS. The content of DA in each oocyte was obtained by standard scintillation counting. For DA uptake under voltage-clamped conditions, the membrane potential was held at –60 mV (or what otherwise stated), and the holding current was continuously monitored. The oocytes were initially perfused in the NaCl (or NaMES) buffer, until a stable base line was established. DA (10 μm) and [3H]DA (67 nm) were added to the NaCl (or NaMES) buffer for 10 min. DA was removed from the perfusion solution (holding current returning to base-line level), and the oocytes were removed from the experimental chamber. Determination of DA content was carried out as described above. The net inward charge was obtained from the time integral of the DA-evoked net inward current and correlated with the [3H]DA uptake in the same cell. Calculations—The data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) or Clampfit 8.0/9.0 (Axon Instruments Inc., Union City, CA). All of the numbers are given as the means ± S.E., and n equals the number of oocytes tested unless otherwise stated. The unpaired t test was used for statistical calculations. Zn2+Enhances Substrate-induced Currents in the DAT—Fig. 1A shows a representative current trace from an oocyte expressing the wild type DAT (WT). Application of DA or AMPH (10 μm) induced inwardly directed currents in agreement with published results (6Sitte H.H. Huck S. Reither H. Boehm S. Singer E.A. Pifl C. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 14Sonders M.S. Zhu S.J. Zahniser N.R. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 960-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In further agreement with described data, cocaine (100 μm) induced an apparent outwardly directed current most likely as the consequence of inhibition of an inwardly directed tonic leak (14Sonders M.S. Zhu S.J. Zahniser N.R. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 960-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Co-application of 10 μm Zn2+ with either DA or AMPH led to an enhancement of the inwardly directed currents. Application of Zn2+ alone did not, however, induce any current (Fig. 1, A and B). Substrates, cocaine, or Zn2+ did not evoke any response in noninjected oocytes (data not shown). The substrate-induced currents mediated by the WT were voltage-dependent both in the absence and in the presence of Zn2+ (Fig. 1B). At potentials more negative than –20 mV, the presence of Zn2+ significantly enhanced the inwardly directed current (Fig. 1B). For example, at –140 mV IAMPH was 161 ± 7% of that observed in the absence of Zn2+, and at –40 mV it was 144 ± 5% (means ± S.E., n = 9, p < 0.001). The same effect of Zn2+ was observed with respect to DA-induced currents (data not shown). At potentials more positive than –20 mV, the negative slope of the I-V curve observed in the absence of Zn2+ represented the substrate-mediated inhibition of the tonic leak reported by Sonders et al. (14Sonders M.S. Zhu S.J. Zahniser N.R. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 960-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Zn2+ shifted this part of the I-V curve upwards, consistent with stimulation by Zn2+ of an outwardly directed current. To visualize the Zn2+-specific current, we subtracted IAMPH from IAMPH+Zn2+. This showed a voltage-dependent current that reversed at –10 mV (Fig. 1C). To verify the specificity of the Zn2+ effect in DAT, we expressed a mutant in which one of the Zn2+ coordinating residues was mutated to lysine (H193K) to eliminate high affinity Zn2+ binding (28Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As evident from Fig. 1D, AMPH (as well as DA; data not shown) induced currents in oocytes expressing this mutant that were comparable with those observed in oocytes expressing the WT; however, the ability of Zn2+ to enhance the substrate-induced current was abolished (Fig. 1D). Rather, we observed a slight, but insignificant, reduction in current at the more hyperpolarizing potentials (Vhold < –80 mV). Overall, these results corroborate the recent finding by Pifl et al. (35Pifl C. Rebernik P. Kattinger A. Reither H. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 46: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), showing that Zn2+ under voltage-clamped conditions is capable of altering the electrogenic properties of the DAT by interacting with the previously described endogenous Zn2+-binding site (28Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). [3H]DA Uptake Experiments—To further explore the unexpected finding that Zn2+ enhanced the substrate-induced currents, we performed [3H]DA uptake experiments in voltage-clamped oocytes to correlate the net influx of charge to transported DA molecules in the absence and presence of Zn2+ (representative current traces are shown in Fig. 2A). Upon application of substrate, the number of charges translocated across the membrane was calculated from the time integral of the holding current. In parallel, we determined the number of transported radiolabeled DA molecules. The uptake rate of [3H]DA under voltage clamp was not affected by Zn2+ (Fig. 2B), and accordingly we observed a clear increase of the net charge-flux ratio upon co-application of Zn2+ (Fig. 2C). Thus, the net charge/DA (charge/DA ratio) was significantly higher in the presence of Zn2+ than in its absence (10.6 ± 0.8 versus 4.9 ± 0.4 charges/DA, respectively, n = 6, p < 0.0001; Fig. 2C). We also tested the voltage dependence of the coupling and uptake. In agreement with Sonders et al. (14Sonders M.S. Zhu S.J. Zahniser N.R. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 960-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found a considerable increase in the coupling ratio at the more hyper- and depolarizing potentials (i.e. –80 and 0 mV) (Fig. 2D). This dependence of the coupling ratio on the membrane potential supports the existence of ion fluxes, stoichiometrically uncoupled from DA uptake (39Sonders M.S. Amara S.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In the presence of Zn2+, the amount of charges/DA was not increased by a fixed number of charges but rather elevated in a voltage-dependent manner with an approximate doubling of the charge/DA ratio at the given potentials (Fig. 2D). This suggests that Zn2+ affects uncoupled ion fluxes through the DAT and not the magnitude of the stoichiometrically coupled current. Effects of Zn2+on the Membrane Potential—Because we previously observed that Zn2+ inhibits the net DA uptake in non-voltage-clamped mammalian cell lines, such as COS-7 cells or HEK-293 cells heterologously expressing the DAT (28Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 34Scholze P. Norregaard L. Singer E.A. Freissmuth M. Gether U. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21505-21513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we also measured [3H]DA accumulation in non-voltage-clamped oocytes expressing the DAT. In full agreement with our observations in mammalian cell lines, Zn2+ inhibited [3H]DA uptake in the oocytes in a biphasic, concentration-dependent manner (Fig 3A). The IC50 value was 1.5 ± 0.7 μm for the high affinity phase and 1.1 mm ± 0.2 for the low affinity phase (n = 3) and thus essentially identical to those observed in mammalian cells (28Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 34Scholze P. Norregaard L. Singer E.A. Freissmuth M. Gether U. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21505-21513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Based on this and on the above findings, it is tempting to suggest that the functional effects of Zn2+ at DAT are related to the ability of Zn2+ to potentiate an inwardly directed current associated with DA uptake. Under voltage-clamped conditions this might result in an increase in charge/DA ratio with no change in uptake rate, whereas under non-voltage-clamped conditions it might result in enhanced depolarization of the cell membrane and consequently in attenuation of DA uptake. To test this hypothesis we assessed the effect of substrate on the membrane potential in the absence and presence of Zn2+ under non-voltage-clamped conditions. The application of DA (1 μm) caused a marked depolarization of the oocyte membrane consistent with an active transport process (Fig. 3B). Importantly, co-application of Zn2+ (10 μm) increased this depolarization as would be predicted from the proposed hypothesis (Fig. 3B). In four separate experiments the depolarization over 1 min in the presence of Zn2+ and 1 μm DA was on average 30 ± 10% (p < 0.03) larger than in the absence of Zn2+. Analysis of the Y335A Mutant—Recently, we reported that mutation of Tyr335 in the third intracellular loop to alanine (Y335A) switched the effect of Zn2+ in transfected COS-7 cells from inhibition to activation of transport (36Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Litman T. Gether U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This was likely the result of an altered equilibrium between distinct conformational states in the transport cycle (36Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Litman T. Gether U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 40Loland C.J. Granas C. Javitch J.A. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3228-3238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We decided to test this mutant as a putative tool to further address the effect of Zn2+ on DAT currents. Application under voltage clamp conditions of AMPH (Fig. 4A) or DA (not shown) alone to oocytes expressing Y335A failed to induce detectable currents. Application of Zn2+alone, however, induced a voltage-dependent current that reversed at approximately –20 mV (Fig. 4A) and was sensitive to 1 mm cocaine (data not shown). Co-application of AMPH or DA together with Zn2+ did not further enhance the Zn2+-induced current (Fig. 4A). The effect of Zn2+ was concentration-dependent and resulted in a bell-shaped relationship with the most effective concentrations at 10–30 μm (Fig. 4B). The effect of Zn2+ was also dependent on the holding potential; at a Vhold of –20 mV we did not detect a net current, whereas at more hyper- and depolarizing potentials Zn2+ activated a net current, which was largest at the extremes (Fig. 4B). Thus, whereas Zn2+ enhances substrate-associated currents in the WT, Zn2+ by itself induces a current in Y335A. Ion Substitution Experiments in Y335A—Assessment of the Zn2+-induced current with respect to ion selectivity was difficult in the WT because of the concomitant Na+/Cl–-dependent substrate-induced current. Therefore, we took advantage of the properties of DAT-Y335A, in which Zn2+ by itself elicits a current and performed ion substitution experiments in oocytes expressing this mutant (Fig. 4C). Replacement of Na+ with either choline or N-methyl-glucosamine (not shown) did not change the amplitude of the Zn2+-induced current (Fig. 4C). In contrast, reduction of Cl– from 104 to 4 mm resulted in a substantial inhibition of the Zn2+-induced current at depolarizing potentials (Vhold > –20 mV) (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, the reversal potential for the current did not change upon removal of Na+ but shifted from –20 to +10 mV upon Cl– substitution with MES (Fig. 4C) or glucuronate (not shown). The shift toward more positive potential from a reversal potential of –20 mV is consistent with Cl– carrying the ion flux induced by Zn2+ in DAT-Y335A. Note that we verified a reversal potential of –20 mV for Cl– in our oocyte set-up by expressing cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (41Schwiebert E.M. Benos D.J. Egan M.E. Stutts M.J. Guggino W.B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S145-S166Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and analyzing the Cl– conductance mediated by this protein (data not shown). We further characterized the Zn2+-activated current in DAT-Y335A by substituting extracellular Cl– with the more permeable anion, nitrate. Substituting Cl– (104 mm) with"

We reported previously that Ca2+ binds to the regulatory C2 domain that occurs in the N terminus of the Ca2+-requiring PLDs. Using Arabidopsis thaliana PLDβ and C2-deleted PLDβ (PLDβcat), we now show that Ca2+ also interacts with the catalytic regions of PLD. PLDβcat exhibited Ca2+-dependent activity, was much less active, and required a higher level of Ca2+ than the full-length PLDβ. Ca2+ binding of the proteins was stimulated by phospholipids; phosphatidylserine was the most effective among those tested. Scatchard plot analysis of Ca2+ binding data yielded an estimate of 3.6 high affinity (Kd = 29 μm) binding sites on PLDβ. The Ca2+-PLDβcat interaction increased the affinity of the protein for the activator, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, but not for the substrate, phosphatidylcholine. This is in contrast to the effect of Ca2+ binding to the C2 domain, which stimulates phosphatidylcholine binding but inhibits phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate binding of the domain. These results demonstrate the contrasting and complementary effects of the Ca2+- and lipid-binding properties of the C2 and catalytic domains of plant PLD and provide insight into the mechanism by which Ca2+ regulates PLD activity.

However, regulation of plant PLD by Ca2+ has been a source of debate because the common plant PLD requires millimolar amounts of Ca2+ for activity in vitro (1Heller M. Adv.

Recent characterization of multiple plant PLDs has made it clear that most plant PLDs are capable of significant enzymatic activity at micromolar levels of Ca2+ near those encountered in the cell (3Pappan K.

Arabidopsis thaliana has 12 PLDs that are grouped into PLDα, -β, -γ, -δ, and -ζ according to the sequence similarities, gene architectures, and domain structures (8Qin C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Except for PLDζ, all other PLDs characterized to date in A. thaliana require Ca2+ for activity. PLDβ, -γ, and -δ are active in micromolar ranges of Ca2+ (6Qin W. Pappan K. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28267-28273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 7Wang C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1102-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and PLDα, which gives rise to the common plant PLD activity, is active at micromolar levels of Ca2+ under acidic conditions with mixed lipid vesicles (5Pappan K. Wang X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Ca2+ increases the membrane association of PLD, which has been suggested as a mechanism for rapid activation of PLD in plant wound response (9Ryu S.B. Wang X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A positive correlation between increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels and increased PLD activity was indicated when the Ca2+ levels of carnation petals were perturbed using various Ca2+-ATPase inhibitors and calmodulin antagonists (10de Vrije T. Munnik T. J. Exp. Bot. 1997; 48: 1631-1637Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recent studies have provided more insight into the mechanism of Ca2+ regulation of PLD activity. Amino acid sequence analysis indicates that most PLDs contain a C2 domain in their N-terminal regulatory regions, except for PLDζ, which has the pleckstrin homology (PH) and phox homology (PX) domains (8Qin C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). C2 domains are Ca2+/phospholipid binding folds that consist of ∼130 amino acid residues (11Ponting C.P. Parker P.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 12Shao X. Davletov B.A. Sutton R.B. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Science. 1996; 273: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). C2 domains have been identified in a number of proteins involved in signal transduction or membrane trafficking, and these domains often mediate a Ca2+-dependent binding of proteins to phospholipids (13Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 14Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32407-32410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The binding of Ca2+ to plant PLD C2 domains has been demonstrated with isolated C2 domains from A. thaliana PLDβ and PLDα (15Zheng L. Krishnamoorthi R. Zolkiewski M. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19700-19706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). That study also showed that the Ca2+ binding induced conformational changes of the C2 domain and promoted the binding of the C2 domain to PC. Thus, Ca2+-binding of the C2 domain underlies, at least in part, the biochemical basis of Ca2+-dependent PLD activity. PLDβ requires both Ca2+ and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) for activity (3Pappan K. Qin W. Dyer J.H. Zheng L. Wang X. J. Biol.

Thus, the inverse relationship between Ca2+- and PIP2-binding of the C2 domain suggests a complex, multi-step process of PLD activation. Further work has identified another PIP2-binding region in the PLD catalytic fold (16Zheng L. Shan J. Krishnamoorthi R. Wang X. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which consists of two duplicated HxKxxxxD motifs and which lies in the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein (6Qin W. Pappan K. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28267-28273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 17Pointing C.P. Kerr I.D.

A. 1998; 95: 9202-9207Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The PIP2-bound catalytic domain increases the enzyme's affinity for its substrate PC, and Ca2+ stimulates the PLDβ-PIP2 interaction (15Zheng L. Krishnamoorthi R. Zolkiewski M. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19700-19706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 16Zheng L. Shan J. Krishnamoorthi R. Wang X. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Ca2+ probably interacts with the catalytic region. The present study explores the potential interaction of Ca2+ with the catalytic regions. We have determined that the C2-deleted PLDβ (PLDβcat) binds Ca2+ but is less activated than the full-length enzyme. Furthermore, Ca2+ stimulates PIP2- but not PC-binding of PLDβcat, properties that both complement and contrast with the lipid binding properties of the C2 domain. Construction of GST-PLDβ and GST-PLDβcat and GST-βC2 Proteins—Three GST fusion proteins GST-PLDβ, GST-PLDβcat, and GST-PLDβC2 (Fig. 1) were used in this study. To construct the C2-deleted PLDβcat, a DNA fragment encompassing the catalytic domain of PLDβ (amino acid residues 158–829) was generated by PCR using the PLDβ cDNA in pBluescript SK as a DNA template, T7 primer as 3′ primer, and a synthetic olignucleotide as 5′ primer, which included an EcoRI restriction site at its 5′ end. The PCR-amplified DNA fragment was digested with EcoRI restriction enzyme and ligated directly into the pGEX-2T vector (Pharmacia). The creation of the GST-PLDβC2 construct has been described previously (15Zheng L. Krishnamoorthi R. Zolkiewski M. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19700-19706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). All of the constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 for protein expression. Expression and Purification of Fusion Proteins in E. coli—Protein expression for each of the constructs was induced by adding 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to log phase (A600 = 0.6–1.0) bacterial cultures and then incubating overnight at 25 °C. For activity assay, cells were collected by centrifugation at 6,000g for 5 min and then rinsed three times with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA). The final rinsed pellet was resuspended in buffer A that contained 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme and was incubated on ice for 15 min. Dithiothreitol was added to 5 mm and the cells were briefly sonicated. Cellular debris were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000g for 5 min. The supernatant was either used immediately or stored at –80 °C. The purification of GST fusion proteins was performed using a modified version of a previously reported procedure (19Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The bacteria pellet was resuspended in STE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) containing 200 μg/ml lysozyme. The suspension was left on ice for 30 min. Dithiothreitol and N-laurylsarcosine (Sarkosyl) were then added to a final concentration of 5 mm and 1.5% (w/v), respectively. The samples were vortexed, sonicated on ice for 1 min, and then centrifuged at 27,000g for 15 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 4% (v/v). The solution containing GST fusion proteins was mixed with glutathione-agarose beads (50%, w/v) at 25 °C for 1 h. The GST fusion proteins bound to agarose beads were washed with 20 bed volumes of STE buffer. At every stage, GST activity was measured and was expressed as ΔA340/min/ml. The amount of purified GST fusion protein bound to the glutathione-agarose was estimated by eluting the GST fusion protein with 8 m urea in STE buffer followed by measuring the protein concentration of the eluate with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). 45Ca2+Gel Overlay—Affinity-purified GST-PLDβ and GST-PLDβcat were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and allowed to renature overnight at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl as described previously (20Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The blots were incubated with 10 μCi of 45Ca2+ and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in the presence or absence of 1 mm PS that was added from a concentrated stock solution that was sonicated before use. The membrane was incubated at room temperature for 2 h with gentle rocking, after which it was rinsed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA. The dried blot was exposed to film. 45Ca2+Binding Assay—45Ca2+ binding of the engineered GST-PLDβ proteins and GST was evaluated using a described method with some modifications (21Luo J.H. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23580-23584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Luo J.H. Kahn S. O'Driscoll K. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3715-3719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty microliters (wet volume) of purified GST-PLDβ, GST-PLDβcat, GST-PLDβC2, or GST attached to glutathione agarose beads was incubated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 μm unlabeled Ca2+ and 1 μCi of 45Ca2+ (specific activity, 5 μCi/μg Ca2+) as tracer in a final volume of 100 μl. To test the effect of phospholipid type and concentration on Ca2+ binding, various phospholipids were sonicated just before use and added to the incubations as specified in the text. To obtain quantitative Ca2+ binding data, GST-PLDβ was incubated in the presence of 1 mm PS, 1 μCi of 45Ca2+, and varying amounts of unlabeled Ca2+, and 45Ca2+ binding after rinsing was measured. Total calcium binding was calculated by multiplying the ratio of 45Ca2+ CPMrecovered/45Ca2+ CPMtotal by the concentration of non-radiolabeled calcium present. Before performing competitive binding experiments, it was established that 1 μCi of 45Ca2+ was sufficient to saturate all GST-PLDβ Ca2+ sites (data not shown). Binding experiments typically contained 0.5–5 μg of purified GST fusion proteins. After incubation at 25 °C for 15 min with moderate shaking, 45Ca2+ bound to fusion proteins was pelleted with the affinity beads by centrifugation at 2,000g for 1 min. The pellet was washed three times with 1 ml of a rinsing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). All buffer solutions were prepared with Chelex-100-treated H2O. 45Ca2+ bound to the fusion proteins was measured by scintillation counting, and the counts were normalized to the picomolar amount of GST fusion proteins used on the basis of the following molecular masses: 103 kDa (GST-PLDβcat), 119 kDa (GST-PLDβ), 42 kDa (GST-PLDβC2), and 26 kDa (GST). Analysis of Ca2+Binding Data—The competitive binding experimental data were fit to two ligand binding models (23Norby J.G. Ottolenghi P. Jensen J. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar): a single class of independent, non-interacting sites or two classes of independent, noninteracting sites, according to the following equations: for a single class of sites, ν = nK[L]/(1+K[L]); or for two classes of sites, ν = n1K1[L]/(1+K1[L]) + n2K2[L]/(1+K2[L]). In these equations, ν is the ratio of Ca2+ bound (micromoles) to micromoles of fusion protein, n refers to the number of binding sites, K is the equilibrium association constant, and [L] is the free Ca2+ concentration. The data were analyzed by both equations using a non-linear least squares fitting program in PSI Plot (Poly Software International, Pearl River, NY), which yielded estimates for n and K. The equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, was calculated as 1/K and values for n and Kd were reported as the value ± S.D. of the estimate. PLD Activity Assay—PLD activity was determined as described previously (2Wang X. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 211-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture included 100 mm MES, pH 7.0, 100 μm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, 0.4 mm lipid vesicles, and 2–10 μg of protein in a total volume of 100 μl. The lipid vesicles were made of PE/PIP2/PC in a ratio of 87.5:7.5:5 mol %. The PLD-mediated hydrolysis of PC was measured using dipalmitoylglycerol-3-phospho[methyl-3H]choline. Release of [3H]choline into the aqueous phase was quantified by scintillation counting. Phospholipid Binding Assays—The same procedure employed previously for assaying phospholipid binding to PLD C2s (15Zheng L. Krishnamoorthi R. Zolkiewski M. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19700-19706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 16Zheng L. Shan J. Krishnamoorthi R. Wang X. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was used to quantify phospholipid binding to PLDβ and its deletion mutants. In brief, in the PC binding assay, 50 μl of phospholipid stock consisting of 250 μg/ml PC (egg yolk), 100 μg/ml PS (egg yolk), and 2 μCi/ml of 3H-labeled PC (dipalmitoyl-glycero-3-P-[methyl-3H]-choline) were mixed with GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads (20 μl wet volume) suspended in a binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, and varying concentrations of Ca2+ in a final volume of 100 μl. The buffered Ca2+ solutions were made by appropriate dilution of the standard Ca2+ solution (Orion Ca2+-sensitive electrode standard solution, Fisher) with Chelex 100-treated buffer. The mixture was then incubated at 23 °C for 30 min with shaking. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of the binding buffer containing the test concentration of Ca2+. PC bound to the protein-agarose beads was quantified by scintillation counting. GST bound to glutathione-agarose beads was used to determine background phospholipid binding. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Binding activity was expressed as counts per minute per picomole of protein. To determine PC (or PIP2) binding as a function of Ca2+ concentration, a similar procedure was employed using lipid dispersions made up of 400 μg of PC (or PIP2) mixed with 0.4 μCi of 3H-labeled PC (or PIP2 using dipalmitoyl-glycero-3-P-[inositol-2-3H]inositol 4,5-bisphosphate) in a final volume of 100 μl. C2-deleted PLDβ Is Catalytically Active and Requires High Levels of Ca2+—The A. thaliana full-length PLDβ and the C2-deleted mutant PLDβcat were expressed as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1A). The purified GST-PLDβ and GST-PLDβcat had molecular masses of ∼119 and 103 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1B). The GST-fused PLDβ catalyzed PC hydrolysis. Its activity was stimulated by Ca2+ and reached a plateau at 50 μm (Fig. 2), a Ca2+ level similar to that required for PLDβ in plants and for PLDβ expressed without the GST fusion tag (4Pappan K. Zheng S. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7048-7054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Qin W. Pappan K. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28267-28273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The GST-fused PLDβcat also hydrolyzed PC, but at a significantly reduced rate. The maximal activation of PLDβcat represented only approximately 10% of the maximal activity of PLDβ. Furthermore, optimal activity of PLDβcat occurred at millimolar levels of Ca2+ (Fig. 2). Finally, the failure of PLDβC2 to hydrolyze PC under any conditions indicates that the low level of activity associated with PLDβcat is bona fide PLD activity. These results establish that PLDβcat, which lacks the C2 domain, contains necessary and sufficient amino acid residues to perform PC hydrolysis but requires much higher levels of Ca2+ for activity. Ca2+Binds to C2-deleted PLDβ—Ca2+-binding of PLDβ and PLDβcat were initially determined by a 45Ca2+ gel overlay technique. PLDβ and PLDβcat demonstrated a marked ability to bind Ca2+ in the presence of phosphatidylserine (Fig. 1C) but not in its absence (data not shown). To obtain quantitative information about the Ca2+ binding exhibited by PLDβ, affinity pull-down binding experiments were performed in the presence of various concentrations of unlabeled Ca2+ and PLDβ fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads. Ca2+ binding by PLDβ was saturable (Fig. 3, inset), and Scatchard analysis (Fig. 3) revealed an upward curvature that was suggestive of two classes of independent and non-interacting binding sites (23Norby J.G. Ottolenghi P. Jensen J. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Of the two modeling equations (i.e. one class of binding sites or two), the PLDβ Ca2+ binding data fit best in the two classes model with 3.6 ± 0.6 high affinity (Kd = 29 ± 6 μm) and 20 ± 4 low affinity (Kd = 1.4 ± 0.7 mm) binding sites. Phospholipids Affect Ca2+Binding by PLDβ—Ca2+ binding by some proteins, such as protein kinase C, is stimulated by acidic phospholipids (21Luo J.H. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23580-23584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Luo J.H. Kahn S. O'Driscoll K. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3715-3719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25959-25967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and our 45Ca2+ gel overlay experiments demonstrated a similar phospholipid dependence for Ca2+ binding. To characterize the effect of lipids on Ca2+ binding, glutathione-agarose bound GST-PLDβ fusion proteins were incubated with 100 μm Ca2+ and various concentrations of PS (Fig. 4). In the absence of PS, PLDβcat barely bound Ca2+. The presence of PS increased the affinity of PLDβcat for Ca2+ in a concentration-dependent fashion. Ca2+ bound to PLDβ, PLDβcat, and PLDβC2 in a saturable manner, and half-saturation occurred at about 200 μm PS for each of these fusion proteins (Fig. 4). The Ca2+-binding process seemed to be most cooperative for PLDβcat. In addition, in the presence of PS, PLDβcat bound more than twice as much Ca2+ as did PLDβC2. PLDβ was found to have the highest Ca2+-binding capacity in the presence of PS. The fusion proteins were incubated with several different phospholipids to determine whether or not other phospholipids besides PS could stimulate Ca2+ binding (Fig. 5). The GST-PLDβ fusion proteins exhibited less Ca2+ binding when PC or PG were substituted for PS, at a 1 mm concentration, in the binding assays. PG stimulated PLDβcat binding to Ca2+ to about 25% of the level observed using PS, whereas PC stimulated much less Ca2+ binding. Various phospholipid mixtures were also used to evaluate the effect of vesicle composition on Ca2+ binding by the GST-PLDβ fusion proteins. Although the phospholipid mixtures had no effect on Ca2+ binding to PLDβC2, they did display considerable stimulatory effects on Ca2+ binding by PLDβ and PLDβcat. For PLDβcat, this represents about 50% of the Ca2+ binding level observed using PS alone. The Ca2+ binding to PLDβ promoted by these phospholipids mixtures is of great interest because they resemble the lipid composition required for PLDβ activity whereas PS is a minor substrate of this enzyme (26Pappan K. Austin-Brown S. Chapman K.D. Wang X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The finding that different phospholipid mixtures enhance Ca2+ binding by PLDβcat suggests that biological membranes might influence Ca2+ interaction with PLDβ. Ca2+Binding Differentially Modulates the Interaction of PLDβcat and PLDβC2 with Phospholipids—One possible function for Ca2+ binding to membrane proteins is to modulate the interaction of such proteins and phospholipids. Previous studies have shown that association of PLDβC2 with Ca2+ enhances PC binding of the C2 domain but inhibits binding of PIP2, a critical activator of PLDβ (15Zheng L. Krishnamoorthi R. Zolkiewski M. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19700-19706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In this study, the effect of Ca2+ on the interaction of PC and PIP2 with PLDβ, PLDβcat, and PLDβC2 were compared directly (Fig. 6). In the absence of Ca2+, PLDβ, PLDβcat, and PLDβC2 bound PC at a low level. As the Ca2+ concentration reached 100 μm, the amount of PC bound to PLDβ and PLDβC2 increased considerably, but no increase was noted for PLDβcat. Only at millimolar levels did Ca2+ slightly stimulate PLDβcat binding to PC (Fig. 6A). The decreased PC binding might partly account for the much reduced catalytic activity and the increased Ca2+ requirement of C2-deficient PLDβcat. PLDβ, PLDβcat, and PLDβC2 all bound PIP2 at comparable levels in the presence of 1 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 6B). Increases in Ca2+ concentration above 10 μm inhibited PIP2 binding of PLDβC2. In contrast, PIP2 binding by PLDβ increased with Ca2+ levels up to 100 μm concentrations of the cation (Fig. 6B). Further increases in Ca2+ concentration sharply diminished the amount of PIP2 bound to PLDβ. PLDβcat displayed a similar pattern but with a smaller magnitude (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that the catalytic region is primarily responsible for the enhanced binding of PIP2 by PLD, and Ca2+ regulates this binding in a concentration dependent manner. PLD plays important, multifaceted roles in cellular metabolism and regulation (27Wang X. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 28Nozawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 29Exton J.H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 1-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PLD family in plants is much more diverse than that in other organisms. The A. thaliana PLD family has 12 PLD genes (8Qin C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 27Wang X. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), whereas only two PLD genes are known in mammals and one in yeast (29Exton J.H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 1-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sciorra V.A. Rudge S.A. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5911-5921Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 10 of the 12 A. thaliana PLDs contain the C2 domain, which are unique to plant PLDs. The remaining two A. thaliana PLDs have PH/PX domains that are also found in mammalian PLDs. All of the C2-containing plant PLDs studied required Ca2+ for activity, whereas the activity of PH/PX-containing A. thaliana PLDζ1 is independent of Ca2+. The present study shows that A. thaliana PLDβ has multiple Ca2+ binding regions, the C2 domain and the C-terminal catalytic region. Ca2+ binding to the catalytic region improves interaction of PLD with the activator, PIP2, which is required for PLDβ activity (3Pappan K. Qin W. Dyer J.H. Zheng L. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our previous work has revealed that PIP2 binding to the catalytic region enhances the enzyme's affinity for the substrate, PC (16Zheng L. Shan J. Krishnamoorthi R. Wang X. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31Qin C. Wang C. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49685-49690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, Ca2+ interaction with the catalytic region is likely to be coupled with enzyme-substrate binding and lipid hydrolysis. The finding that Ca2+ is needed to promote PIP2 binding explains, at least in part, why Ca2+ is required for the activity of the C2-containing PLDs but not the PX/PH-containing PLDs. PIP2 stimulates the activity of all other A. thaliana PLDs examined (6Qin W. Pappan K. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28267-28273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 7Wang C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1102-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 8Qin C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and also mammalian and yeast PLDs (29Exton J.H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 1-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sciorra V.A. Rudge S.A. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5911-5921Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Both PH and PX domains are known to interact with polyphosphoinositides. In addition, a PIP2 binding motif has been identified in the catalytic region of the mammalian and yeast PLDs (30Sciorra V.A. Rudge S.A. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5911-5921Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This motif is required for the animal PLD activity (30Sciorra V.A. Rudge S.A. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5911-5921Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and is conserved in the PH/PX-containing A. thaliana PLDζ (8Qin C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). However, PLDβ and other Ca2+-dependent PLDs miss two of the core basic amino acid residues involved in PIP2 binding (16Zheng L. Shan J. Krishnamoorthi R. Wang X. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Instead, these PLDs use Ca2+ to augment the binding of PIP2 to the PLD catalytic fold, as shown in our previous (16Zheng L. Shan J. Krishnamoorthi R. Wang X. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and present results. The C2-deficient PLDβcat exhibited a much lower catalytic activity and needed a much higher concentration of Ca2+ to reach maximal activation compared with the whole enzyme. In addition, PC binding by PLDβcat was diminished. Thus, the reduced catalytic activity of PLDβcat probably results from an inefficient binding of substrate vesicles caused by the absence of the C2 domain. The present results also suggest that Ca2+ binding by the C2 domain facilitates the binding of PLDβ to its substrate in membranes, as proposed for cytosolic phospholipase A2 (32Nalefski E.A. Sultzman L.A. Martin D.M. Kriz R.W. Towler P.S. Knopf J.L. Clark J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18239-18249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A truncated cytosolic phospholipase A2 that lacked the C2 domain failed to associate with membranes and had no hydrolytic activity toward PC presented in liposomes; however, it could hydrolyze monomeric PC as efficiently as the full-length cytosolic phospholipase A2 (32Nalefski E.A. Sultzman L.A. Martin D.M. Kriz R.W. Towler P.S. Knopf J.L. Clark J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18239-18249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ binds to PLDβ in a phospholipid-dependent manner; in the absence of phospholipids, Ca2+ binding is much reduced. Different phospholipids promote Ca2+ binding to different extents. By far, PS seems to be most effective, but PG and phospholipid mixtures also seem to influence Ca2+ binding. This phenomenon may be explained by the ability of these acidic phospholipids, via their net negative charge at physiological pH, to attract Ca2+ ions. Similar phospholipid-dependent Ca2+ binding has been reported for several other proteins (24Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25959-25967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 33Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7624-7630Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 34Evans T.C. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13231-13238Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For example, protein kinase C and annexin each bind 8–12 Ca2+ ions in the presence of acidic phospholipids but almost none in their absence (24Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7624-7630Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Association of these proteins with membranes depends on membrane composition, which has an effect on the amount of Ca2+ required for optimal lipid-protein interaction (24Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A binding model has been proposed to describe the Ca2+-dependent binding of protein kinase C βII to membranes and its subsequent Ca2+-dependent activation (25Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25959-25967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). According to this model, low levels of Ca2+ promote a weak interaction between protein kinase C and membranes, whereas higher Ca2+ concentrations activate the enzyme. Both high and low affinity Ca2+ interactions trigger conformational changes in protein kinase C βII. Findings reported in this and other studies (15Zheng L. Krishnamoorthi R. Zolkiewski M. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19700-19706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 16Zheng L. Shan J. Krishnamoorthi R. Wang X. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) suggest a similar two-stage membrane-binding and enzyme activation model for PLDβ. The present study establishes that Ca2+ has differential effects on phospholipid binding to the C2 domain and the catalytic region. At elevated levels, Ca2+ inhibits PLDβC2 binding to PIP2. At near physiological levels, Ca2+ stimulates PLDβcat binding to PIP2 but, as it approaches millimolar levels, Ca2+ dramatically reduces PIP2 binding (Fig. 6B). Ca2+ has a similar but greater effect on PIP2 binding to the whole enzyme (Fig. 6B), with the maximal value being attained at about 100 μm Ca2+, a pattern resembling the Ca2+-dependence of PLDβ activity (Fig. 2). Millimolar level Ca2+ inhibited PIP2 binding by PLDβ but caused only a mild reduction PLDβ activity. On the other hand, millimolar Ca2+ inhibited both the activity and PIP2 binding of PLDβcat. Ca2+ binding by the C2-domain of PLDβ causes a conformational change (15Zheng L. Krishnamoorthi R. Zolkiewski M. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19700-19706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) that may lead to the optimal positioning of basic amino acid residues of the PIP2 binding region flanking the active site (16Zheng L. Shan J. Krishnamoorthi R. Wang X. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the significant stimulation of PIP2-PLDβcat binding by Ca2+ suggests that this cation acts directly within the catalytic domain to promote PIP2 binding. Inhibition of this protein-phosphoinositide interaction by high concentrations of Ca2+ probably reflects competition between the Ca2+ and the acidic residues of the PIP2 binding region for binding to negatively charged PIP2. Because PLDβ, but not PLDβcat, can efficiently bind PC through its C2-domain, its activity toward mixed PE/PC/PIP2 vesicles is less reduced at millimolar Ca2+ levels. Although there are clear limitations to extrapolating the data from these in vitro studies to the ligand binding and regulation of PLDβ in vivo, there is a reason to believe that these studies are relevant to the activation and regulation of plant PLDβ in vivo. For instance, it is known that steady state cytosolic concentrations of Ca2+ up to 1 μm can be elicited after applying an external stimulus, such as cold stress or wounding. Even so, the capacity of the plant cytosol to buffer Ca2+ is substantially greater (estimates range from 0.1 to 1 mm), strongly suggesting that the influx of Ca2+ after stimulation leads to transient local Ca2+ elevations in the range over which Ca2+-mediated increases in PIP2 binding and PLDβ activity are observed. These local dramatic increases of Ca2+ are expected to activate enzymes associated with Ca2+ channels or those tethered nearby on the membrane (35White P.J. Broadley M.R. Ann. Bot. 2003; 92: 487-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar) and this is in agreement with our model of Ca2+-induced PLDβ activity (Fig. 7). In this model (Fig. 7), the C2 domain binds the membrane in a different orientation with and without Ca2+, and this is in agreement with our previous observation that Ca2+ alters the conformation of the C2 domain (15Zheng L. Krishnamoorthi R. Zolkiewski M. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19700-19706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Without Ca2+, it binds the membrane with its cationic residues interacting with anionic lipids, including PIP2, whereas with Ca2+, it binds the membrane with its calcium binding loop partially penetrating the membrane (Fig. 7). The binding and release of membrane phospholipids by the C2 and catalytic regions occur alternately to produce enzyme movement over the membrane surface without complete detachment. At resting Ca2+, PLDβ interacts with PIP2 through the C2 domain and/or the PIP2 binding region to remain attached to the membrane in an inactive state. With increased Ca2+ concentration (and PIP2 concentration; see below), PIP2 binding affinity of the C2 domain decreases, whereas that of the catalytic region increases. Although Fig. 2 suggests that PLDβ is active at resting Ca2+ levels, this is unlikely to be the case in vivo, where PIP2 levels are lower than those present in the substrate vesicles used for our in vitro activity assay (36Drobak B.K. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our previous studies clearly demonstrate the concentration-dependent activation of PLDβ by PIP or PIP2 (3Pappan K. Qin W. Dyer J.H. Zheng L. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 4Pappan K. Zheng S. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7048-7054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16Zheng L. Shan J. Krishnamoorthi R. Wang X. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and, like Ca2+, cellular levels of these signaling molecules increase in response to external stimuli and stress (37Shank K.J. Su P. Brglez I. Boss W.F. Dewey R.E. Boston R.S. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, although increased PIP2 levels increase the binding of PLDβcat to PC, PLDβ-C2 domain binding to PC is not stimulated by PIP2 at any concentration (16Zheng L. Shan J. Krishnamoorthi R. Wang X. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, dynamic changes in the concentrations of Ca2+ and PIP2 in response to external stimuli and stress can coordinately increase the binding of both activator (i.e. PIP2) and substrate (i.e. PC) to the catalytic domain of PLDβ and increase its activity (Fig. 7). This mechanism underlies a basis for posttranslational regulation of PLD activity, which is suggested to occur under different conditions, such as oxidative assaults (38Zhang W. Wang C. Qin C. Wood T. Olafsdottir G. Wang X. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2285-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), temperature stress (39Li W. Li M. Zhang W. Welti R. Wang X. Nat. Biotech. 2004; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and in response to a plant hormone (40Zhang W. Qin C. Zhao J. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9508-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Both Ca2+ and PIP2 function as cellular messengers in various cellular processes, and characterization of their direct interaction with PLD thus provides insights into the in vivo activation and function of Ca2+-dependent PLDs."

Because both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms play central roles in modulating developmental protein levels, we have analyzed the 3′-untranslated region (3′UTR) of the Bmp 2 gene. This 3′UTR is unusually long and is alternatively polyadenylated. Mouse, human, and dog mRNAs are 83–87% identical within this region. A 265-nucleotide sequence, conserved between mammals, birds, frogs, and fish, is present in Bmp2 but not Bmp4. The ability of AmphiBMP2/4, a chordate ortholog to Bmp2 and Bmp4, to align with this sequence suggests that its function may have been lost in Bmp4. Activation of reporter genes by the conserved region acts by a post-transcriptional mechanism. Mouse, human, chick, and zebrafish Bmp2 synthetic RNAs decay rapidly in extracts from cells not expressing Bmp2. In contrast, these RNAs are relatively stable in extracts from Bmp2-expressing cells. Thus, Bmp2 RNA half-lives in vitro correlate with natural Bmp2 mRNA levels. The fact that non-murine RNAs interact appropriately with the mouse decay machinery suggests that the function of these cis-regulatory regions has been conserved for 450 million years since the fish and tetrapod lineages diverged.

The phenotypes of these mutants prove that BMP signaling is required for vital developmental processes. The evolutionary conservation of the BMP2 and BMP4 proteins is remarkable. Except for nematode BMPs, the amino acid sequences of invertebrate BMPs are 70–87% identical to human BMP2 (22Lelong C. Mathieu M. Favrel P. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83 (and references therein): 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The Drosophila protein Decapentaplegic (DPP), which is 71% identical to human BMP2, is functionally interchangeable with mammalian BMPs in a mammalian bone induction assay (23Sampath T.K. Rashka K.E. Doctor J.S. Tucker R.F. Hoffmann F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6004-6008Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Conversely, the closely related mammalian BMP4 rescues the axis defects of Drosophila lacking DPP function (24Padgett R.W. Wozney J.M. Gelbart W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2905-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Indeed, the entire BMP signaling pathways are conserved. For example, BMPs and their antagonists appear to play analogous, although inverted, roles in dorso-ventral axis formation in vertebrates and invertebrates (25Hogan B. Nature. 1995; 376: 210-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although the BMP2 and BMP4 amino acid sequences are 91% identical and the proteins function similarly in most assays, the embryonic lethal phenotypes of null mutations proved that both genes are indispensable. The inability of BMP2 and BMP4 to compensate for each other is probably because of their distinct patterns of expression. Elucidating Bmp2 gene regulatory mechanisms is thus fundamental to understanding this crucial gene. Both Bmp2 in mouse and dpp in Drosophila are expressed in highly tissue- and stage-specific patterns. Multiple promoters and alternative splicing produce a variety of dpp transcripts in Drosophila (26St. Johnston R.D. Hoffmann F.M. Blackman R.K. Segal D. Grimaila R. Padgett R.W. Irick H.A. Gelbart W.M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1114-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Like Bmp2, the dpp mRNA has an unusually long 3′-untranslated region (3′UTR) with highly conserved regions (27Newfeld S.J. Padgett R.W. Findley S.D. Richter B.G. Sanicola M. de Cuevas M. Gelbart W.M.

The vitamin A-derivative retinoic acid (RA) strongly induces the Bmp2 gene in F9 embryonal carcinoma cells stimulated to differentiate with RA (36Rogers M.B. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Gudas L.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). F9 cells lacking retinoic acid receptor-γ fail to express Bmp2 in response to RA (37Boylan J. Lufkin T. Achkar C. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 843-851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RA also induces the Bmp2 gene in the developing chick limb (38Francis P.H. Richardson M.K. Brickell P.M. Tickle C. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 209-218PubMed Google Scholar) and in medulloblastoma cells (39Hallahan A.R. Pritchard J.I. Chandraratna R.A. Ellenbogen R.G. Geyer J.R. Overland R.P. Strand A.D. Tapscott S.J. Olson J.M. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Many Bmp2-expressing tissues (e.g. heart and cardiovasculature, limbs, central nervous system, craniofacial structures, and vertebrae) develop abnormally in vitamin A-deficient embryos or after exposure to high levels of vitamin A or other retinoids (4Hogan B. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar, 40Zile M. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: S455-S458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bmp2 is expressed at three distinct levels in F9 cells. Undetectable in undifferentiated stem cells, the Bmp2 transcript is detected readily in RA-treated cells. The combination of elevated cyclic AMP levels and RA induces the Bmp2 transcript 5–6-fold more than RA alone. Cyclic AMP elevation alone induces neither differentiation nor Bmp2 expression (36Rogers M.B. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Gudas L.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 41Rogers M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 115-122PubMed Google Scholar). The highly reproducible, differential expression of Bmp2 in F9 cells is an excellent tool for elucidating the molecular determinants controlling RA-induced Bmp2 expression. By using the F9 cell model system, we previously demonstrated that promoter function is conserved between primates and mouse (29Abrams K.L. Xu J. Nativelle-Serpentini C. Dabirshahsahebi S.

Unless otherwise indicated, nucleotide positions have been provided with respect to the murine distal Bmp2 promoter that is 2,201 nt upstream of the initiator codon (ATG). All restriction and modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Human—To generate an antisense probe spanning the 389 nt upstream to 146 nt downstream of the stop codon, EST clone accession number AI569017 was linearized with MscI and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase. For the probe spanning the downstream poly(A) sites (nt 597–1,226 downstream of the Bmp2 stop codon, accession number NT_011387), a 630-bp DNA fragment was generated from genomic DNA by PCR and inserted into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of the pBluescript II KS vector (Stratagene). The sequences of the primers are as follows: HindIII-Forward, 5′CAGGAAGCTTGCAGAGTGATTGTCC3′; EcoRI-Reverse, 5′GCGAATTCAAGGTCATCATTGTAAGCG3′. This plasmid (pBShB2-3′UTR-pA2-3) was linearized with XhoI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase to generate antisense RNA probes. Mouse—For the mouse-specific probe spanning the stop codon and the first putative polyadenylation site, a SacI (blunted with T4 DNA polymerase) and PstI fragment was subcloned into the EcoRV and PstI site of pBluescript II KS to generate pBSB2-3′UTR-SacPst (nt 9,397–10,204). After mutating the vector AccI site, the AccI/PstI fragment spanning nt 9938–10,204 was removed; the remaining plasmid was blunted with T4 DNA polymerase and religated to generate pBSB2-3′UTR-SacI-AccI (nt 9,397–9,938). This plasmid was linearized with HindIII and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase to generate antisense probe or with XbaI and T3 RNA polymerase to generate sense probe. For the probe spanning the downstream poly(A) sites (nt 10,202–10,781 relative to the distal promoter), a PstI/EcoRI fragment was excised from pPGLB2-3′UTR and inserted into the PstI and EcoRI sites of the pBluescript II KS vector. This plasmid (pBSB2-3′UTR-PA1-2) was linearized with XbaI and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase to generate antisense probe and HindIII and T7 RNA polymerase to generate sense probe.

Briefly, radiolabeled RNA probe, total HeLa or F9 cell RNA, and yeast tRNA were co-precipitated with ethanol, denatured at 80 °C for 10 min, and hybridized overnight at 45 °C. After 20 min of RNase A/T1 digestion at 30 °C, reactions were inactivated with SDS and proteinase K, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction. Subsequently, RNAs were ethanol-precipitated, dissolved in 15 μl of gel loading buffer, and electrophoresed on denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels (8 m urea; 37.5:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide). Protected RNAs were visualized by using autoradiography and quantified using an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. Genomic clones were obtained by PCR using a forward primer to a region just upstream of the stop codon that is identical or nearly identical in all vertebrates (5′CAGGACATGGTGGTGGAGGG3′) and species-specific reverse primers. The mammalian and chick products used a primer identical to the chick sequence (5′GCACTTTGCCATAGTAACCTTCC3′). The zebrafish primer was 5′GCCTTCAGCATGTTATATCATGAC3′). PCRs contained 1 unit of Taq recombinant DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science), 100 ng of genomic DNA, 50 pmol of each primer, 0.25 mm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and buffer conditions as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). 100-μl reactions were incubated as follows in a Mastercycler gradient PCR machine (Eppendorf): denature 97 °C/5 min, anneal 47 °C/30 s (53 °C zebrafish), extend 72 °C/3 min followed by 35 cycles using a 94 °C denaturation. The PCR products were separated by PAGE (37.5:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide), visualized by ethidium bromide staining, and confirmed by Southern blotting (42Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E.

PCR fragments (∼500 bp) were purified by gel electrophoresis, passively eluted from a gel slice, and cloned into the pCRII TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clones from all species were subcloned into the EcoRI site pGEM-4 (Promega) for in vitro transcript synthesis. The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey Medical School Molecular Resource Facility (Newark, NJ) sequenced each plasmid by using T7 and Sp6 primers.

The Bmp2 promoter fragment from construct A was inserted upstream of luciferase as described for construct B. pGemB2-KA (nt 9,455–9,938) and plasmids containing the homologous region from human, chick, and zebrafish were synthesized by PCR as described above and linearized with BamHI. SacI/PstI (nt 9,397–10,202) or PvuII/PstI (9,574–10,202) fragments obtained from pBS-3′UTR were cloned into SacI/PstI or SmaI/PstI-digested pGem4 to make pGBmp2-SacPst and pGBmp2-PvuIIPst, respectively.

All linearized plasmid templates were transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase F9 embryonal carcinoma cells were plated on dishes pre-coated with 1% gelatin and incubated at 37 °C with 10% CO2. The culture media consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. The cells were induced to differentiate into parietal endoderm by adding 1 μm all-trans-retinoic acid, 250 μm Bt2cAMP, and 500 μm theophylline (RACT). Undifferentiated control cells were treated with 250 μm Bt2cAMP and 500 μm theophylline (CT). Transfections were performed essentially as described by Vasios et al. (45Vasios G.W. Gold J.D.

Briefly, for 96-h drug treatments, F9 cells were plated at 1 × 106 or 0.3 × 106 (CT only) cells per 100-cm dish (Nunc) for 12 h, drugged for 48 h with CT or RACT, transfected by overnight calcium phosphate precipitation, and then cultured for an additional 24–48 h with drugs.

Cells were extracted, and luciferase activity was determined by using the Promega Luciferase Assay System and a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytic Luminescence Laboratory). Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency by dividing the raw luciferase value by the units of β-galactosidase activity (1 unit = A1 420·μl–1·h–). Sequences were subcloned into the pGEM4 (Promega) polylinker downstream of the SP6 promoter and upstream of the HindIII site. After HindIII digestion, plasmids were transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase with 7MeGpppG and [α-32P]UTP. The design of these transcripts mimics that of transcripts used extensively for this purpose (44Mukherjee D. Gao M. O'Connor J.P. Raijmakers R. Pruijn G. Lutz C.S. Wilusz J.

The Bmp2 3′UTR Is Unusually Conserved—Surveys of conserved regions in 3′UTRs defined “highly conserved” as sequences of >100 nt with 70% identity conserved for 300 million years of evolution (50Duret L. Dorkeld F. Gautier C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2315-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 51Shabalina S.A. Ogurtsov A.Y. Lipman D.J. Kondrashov A.S.

Biol. 1998; 18: 7371-7382Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because 265 nt of the Bmp2 3′UTR is 73% conserved between mammals and fish (450 million years of separation), this region fits within this class (Fig. 1) (29Abrams K.L. Xu J. Nativelle-Serpentini C. Dabirshahsahebi S. Rogers M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15916-15928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For brevity, we have termed the Bmp2 highly conserved noncoding sequence the “HCNS.” A more comprehensive analysis of Bmp2 3′UTRs from more evolutionarily separated mammals indicates that the entire 3′UTR including the polyadenylation (poly(A)) signals is unusually conserved. To analyze the rest of the 3′UTR, we aligned Bmp2 sequences from our PCR-generated clones and newly deposited GenBank™ sequences from additional mammals using the MultiPipMaker global sequence alignment program (see site bio.cse.psu.edu/pipmaker/) (Fig. 1). The 3′UTRs of the human and dog Bmp2 transcripts are 86% identical over 1,217 nt and 83% identical over 1,088 nt, respectively, to the mouse transcript. Between Bmp2 genes from four mammalian orders (Rodentia, Primates, Carnivores, and Artiodactyls), the highly conserved block is 95% identical over 370 nt. Furthermore, the striking conservation of the entire 3′UTR between several rodents, humans, and chimpanzees and dog, deer, and cow implies vital post-transcriptional regulatory functions for the whole 3′UTR. The Bmp2 and Bmp4 3′UTRs Differ—The BMP2 and BMP4 proteins are 91% identical and have similar biological activities but are expressed in different patterns (4Hogan B. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar, 53Lyons K.M. Pelton R.W. Hogan B.L.M. Devlelopment (Camb.). 1990; 109: 833-844PubMed Google Scholar, 54Lyons K. Pelton R.

Our analyses of ESTs and mRNA sequences indicate that human and mouse Bmp4 mRNAs end at a single poly(A) signal resulting in 293 or 336 nt 3′UTRs, respectively. We attempted to align Bmp2 and Bmp4 3′UTR sequences from many species; however, the Bmp2 HCNS is clearly absent in all Bmp4 genes (see Ref. 29Abrams K.L. Xu J. Nativelle-Serpentini C.

We also attempted to align vertebrate Bmp4 3′UTRs to themselves, but Bmp4 3′UTRs are poorly conserved relative to the coding region. BMP2 and BMP4 form a subgroup with the invertebrate DPP protein. Protostomes and other deuterostomes such as cephalochordates, hemichordates, urochordates, and echinoderms appear to have only one Bmp2/4/dpp-like gene (22Lelong C. Mathieu M. Favrel P.

Domain c-(463–491), containing 18 acidic residues, is an interesting and important C-terminal extension of PDI. In this study, the PDI mutant abb′a′, in which domain c is truncated, was used to investigate the relationship between the C-terminal structure and chaperone function. Reactivation and light-scattering experiments show that both wild-type PDI and abb′a′ interact with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, EC 1.1.1.27), which tends to self-aggregate during reactivation. The interaction enhances reactivation of LDH and reduces aggregation. According to these results, it seems as if domain c might be dispensable to the chaperone function of PDI. However, abb′a′ is prone to self-aggregation and causes increased aggregation of LDH during thermal denaturation. In contrast, wild-type PDI remains active as a chaperone under these conditions and prevents self-aggregation of LDH. Furthermore, measurements of intrinsic fluorescence and difference absorbance during denaturation show that abb′a′ is much more labile to heat or guanidine hydrochloride denaturation than wild-type PDI.

As an enzyme, it catalyzes the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds during oxidative protein folding. As a chaperone, PDI inhibits aggregation of the denatured protein and assists the refolding. The substrates of PDI can be proteins with or without disulfide bonds, such as d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (3Cai H. Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24550-24552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rhodanese (4Song J.L. Wang C.C. Eur. J.

Under certain circumstances, PDI shows a so-called anti-chaperone effect in which substoichiometric concentrations of PDI facilitate aggregation and inhibit reactivation of denatured proteins (7Song J.L. Quan H. Wang C.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), presumably by interacting and stabilizing the aggregates (8Edman J.C. Ellis L. Blacher R.W. Roth R.A.

Domains a and a′ are similar to thioredoxin, and each contains the sequence CGHC, forming two independently acting catalytic sites (8Edman J.C. Ellis L. Blacher R.W. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J.

Domains b and b′ show low homology with domain a and have little sequence similarity to any member of the thioredoxin family but also adopt a thioredoxin fold (9Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Domain c, also termed the C-terminal extension (residues 463–491), represents a putative Ca2+-binding region (11Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have investigated the function of the PDI domain c using different mutants of PDI with deletions in the C-terminal sequence. They found that under routine conditions, domain c plays no significant role in the chaperone and disulfide isomerase activities of PDI. In contrast, Noiva et al. (2Noiva R. Onodera S. Schwaller M.D. Irwin W.A. Guzman N.A. Prolyl 4-Hydroxylase, Protein Disulfide Isomerase and Other Structurally Related Proteins. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997: 369-397Google Scholar) have hypothesized that domain c is vital for PDI to function as a chaperone. Whether domain c is involved in the chaperone function of PDI is an interesting problem worthy of investigation. The data presented in this study indicate that domain c plays a critical role in stabilization of the functional conformation of PDI and in preventing its self-aggregation under extreme conditions, although the deletion of the entire C-terminal extension (463–491) does not suppress chaperone activity toward guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-denatured lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, EC 1.1.1.27). Thus, our results provide a unifying picture of the functional role of PDI domain c. Materials—Full-length human PDI cDNA was provided by Prof. K. Kivirikko, University of Oulu, Finland. The cDNA was inserted into the plasmid pUC19. Ni2+ chelating Sepharose™ Fast Flow resin was from Amersham Biosciences. Q-Sepharose™ Fast Flow resin and NADH were from Amersham Biosciences. pQE-30 and Escherichia coli M15 (pREP4) were from Qiagen. GdnHCl, dithiothreitol (DTT), EDTA, and bovine serum albumin (BSA, fraction V) came from Sigma. Other reagents were analytical grade and used without further purification. Rabbit muscle LDH was also from Sigma. The enzyme showed a single band on SDS-PAGE with a specific activity of ∼1000 units. The protein concentration was determined using an absorption coefficient ϵ280 = 1.40 ± 0.02 cm2/mg (13Jaenicke R. Koberstein R. Teuscher B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 23: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To avoid the interaction of disulfide bonds of PDI and LDH, a reducing buffer (0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm DTT) was used for all experiments, unless otherwise stated. Absorbance was measured on a Hitachi VIS/UV 2010 spectrophotometer. 90° light scattering and fluorescence were measured on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The theoretical pIs of abb′a′ and PDI were calculated by the ExPASy-Compute pI/Mw tool online. Expression and Purification of Wild-type abb′a′ and PDI—The coding regions of PDI and abb′a′ were amplified by PCR from the pUC19-PDI construct (10Koivunen P. Pirneskoski A. Karvonen P. Ljung J.

The PCR products (BamH/HindIII) were ligated into pQE-30 to generate an N-terminal extension including a His6 tag (MRGSHHHHHHGS). To overexpress the two resultant proteins, E. coli M15 (pREP4) was transformed with either the pQE-30-PDI or the pQE-30-abb′a′ construct. Transformed cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin. An overnight culture, produced from a single colony, was diluted 100-fold and grown to an absorbance (600 nm) of 0.8–1.0 and then induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration, 1 mm). The culture was incubated for another 4 h, and then the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (6500 rpm, 4 °C, 30 min) and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole). The bacteria were lysed by sonication before centrifugation (6500 rpm, 4 °C, 30 min). The supernatant was transferred to the Ni2+ chelating Sepharose™ Fast Flow column, which had been pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was continuously washed with buffer A until the absorbance at 280 nm reached a baseline, and then buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 500 mm NaCl and 50 mm imidazole) was used to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. The resulting protein was eluted with buffer C (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 500 mm NaCl and 250 mm imidazole). Eluted protein was dialyzed extensively against 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at 4 °C. Then it was applied to a Q-Sepharose™ Fast Flow column (15 × 1.5 cm), which had been pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0). A linear gradient (0–1 m NaCl) was adopted to allow further purification (total volume, 250 ml). Fractions containing the protein of interest were identified by SDS-PAGE and dialyzed extensively against distilled water at 4 °C. Finally, the protein was lyophilized and stored at –20 °C. Reactivation of GdnHCl-denatured LDH in the Presence of abb′a′ or PDI—Enzyme concentrations are stated in terms of monomers, and a stoichiometry of 1:1 was used although PDI is most active in its dimeric form (15Yu X.C. Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1207: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). LDH (50 μm) was denatured completely by incubation in 3 m GdnHCl at 4 °C overnight (16Ma Y.Z. Tsou C.L. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Reactivation was initiated by a 50-fold dilution of the denatured enzyme into phosphate buffer containing different concentrations of PDI (or abb′a′) and 10 mm DTT (17Rudolph R. Zettlmeissl G.

The reactivation mixture was kept at 4 °C for 30 min and then at 25 °C for 2 h before an aliquot of 50 μl was taken for activity assay at 25 °C. The enzymatic assay was carried out in phosphate buffer (containing 0.72 mm pyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA) by monitoring the absorbance at 334 nm at 25 °C, unless otherwise stated. For assay of chaperone activity after GdnHCl incubation, PDI or abb′a′ (final concentration, 100 μm) was incubated at 37 °C overnight in phosphate buffer containing different concentrations of GdnHCl. The LDH reactivation process and conditions were as described above, except that the GdnHCl-incubated PDI or abb′a′ was added at a molar ratio [chaperone]:[LDH] of 10:1, and the reactivation mixtures were kept at 25 °C for 2 h before the assays. Aggregation of GdnHCl-denatured LDH Monitored by Light Scattering in the Presence of abb′a′ or PDI—The conditions used were the same as above, except that 90° light scattering (slit widths: Ex = Em = 500 nm) was monitored after a 50-fold dilution of the denatured LDH (17Rudolph R.

Delayed Addition of abb′a′ or PDI during Reactivation of GdnHCl-denatured LDH—LDH (50 μm) was incubated in 3 m GdnHCl overnight at 4 °C to allow complete denaturation, and then the mixture was diluted 50-fold into phosphate buffer containing 10 mm DTT at 25 °C (3Cai H.

The reactivation mixture was kept at 4 °C for 30 min and then at 25 °C for 2 h before an aliquot (50 μl) was taken for activity assay at 25 °C. Effects of abb′a′ or PDI on Aggregation of Thermally Denatured LDH Monitored by Light Scattering—LDH (0.2 μm) in the presence of PDI (or abb′a′) at different molar ratios ([chaperone]/[LDH] = 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, or 16) was incubated at 80 °C in phosphate buffer (18Dams T.

The Time Course of Light-scattering Changes of abb′a′ Incubated at 80 °C—Conditions were the same as stated above, except that abb′a′ alone (0.2, 0.8, or 2 μm) was incubated in phosphate buffer at 80 °C, and the light-scattering intensity was measured. Measurements of Emission Fluorescence of abb′a′ and PDI during GdnHCl Denaturation—PDI or abb′a′ (final concentration, 0.3 μm) was incubated in different concentrations of GdnHCl for 12 h to reach equilibrium, and then intrinsic fluorescence was measured by excitation at 295 nm (slit widths: Ex = Em = 5 nm) at 37 °C. The fluorescence intensities of PDI or abb′a′ alone at 338 nm, measured under the same conditions, were taken as 100%. Kinetic measurements were carried out at 37 °C. PDI or abb′a′ was added into 0.5 m GdnHCl solution, and the intrinsic fluorescence was measured at different time intervals. Absorbance of abb′a′ or PDI at Different Temperatures—PDI or abb′a′ (final concentration, 1 μm) was incubated in phosphate buffer at different temperatures, and the absorbance at 280 nm was measured until no further changes were observed. The difference absorbance value was obtained by subtracting the value measured at 25 °C. Effects of abb′a′ and PDI on Reactivation and Aggregation of GdnHCl-denatured LDH—The protein abb′a′ is a mutant of PDI, which lacks domain c, as illustrated in Fig. 1A. Domain c has 29 residues and is rich in negatively charged amino acids, including 8 Glu and 10 Asp residues. After expression and purification, PDI and abb′a′ each appear as a single band by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). The concentrations of PDI and abb′a′ were determined as described by Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). The CD spectra of wild-type PDI and abb′a′ are essentially identical, as reported (10Koivunen P. Pirneskoski A. Karvonen P. Ljung J. Helaakoski T. Notbohm H. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that the effects of PDI and abb′a′ at different molar ratios ([chaperone]/[LDH]) on the reactivation of GdnHCl-denatured LDH after dilution in the presence of 10 mm DTT. The presence of wild-type PDI or abb′a′ results in an increase in the reactivation yield. The reactivation yield of LDH with wild-type PDI (at a molar ratio [chaperone]:[LDH] of 30) is ∼41%, and that with abb′a′ is slightly higher (∼46%). The spontaneous reactivation yield of LDH alone, or in the presence of BSA, is significantly lower (∼19%). The intensity of intrinsic fluorescence of abb′a′ at 350 nm is slightly (10.3 ± 1.8%) higher than that of wild-type PDI under the same conditions (see Fig. 6, A and B). The higher level of intrinsic fluorescence suggests a slight difference in the microenvironment around Trp residues, implying that the lack of the acidic domain c causes slight alteration of the hydrophobic packing as compared with wild-type PDI. Furthermore, the theoretical pI of abb′a′ (5.03) is slightly higher than that of PDI (4.69). The slightly higher yield of reactivation for abb′a′ as compared with wild-type PDI may result from the difference in packing and/or from the reduced charge of the mutant. Under the same conditions, BSA shows only a slight effect on the LDH reactivation yield, much lower than either abb′a′ or PDI. Thus, abb′a′ maintains chaperone function toward LDH, although domain c is truncated.Fig. 6Effects of GdnHCl on the fluorescence of PDI or abb′a′. PDI or abb′a′ (final concentration, 0.3 μm) was incubated in the desired concentration of GdnHCl for 12 h to reach equilibrium followed by measurement of intrinsic fluorescence by excitation at 295 nm (slit widths: Ex = Em = 5 nm) at 37 °C.

Fig. 2, B and C, show changes in the light-scattering intensity of GdnHCl-denatured LDH in the presence of PDI and abb′a′, respectively. For LDH alone, the intensity increases markedly within 5 min after dilution and reaches a plateau after about 25 min. LDH in the presence of wild-type PDI (Fig. 2B) or abb′a′ (Fig. 2C) displays a clear decrease in the light-scattering intensity under the same conditions. With increasing concentrations of abb′a′ or PDI (Fig. 2D), both the rates and the extents of aggregation decrease markedly until the molar ratio of [chaperone]/[LDH] reaches about 15. BSA, as a control, causes no significant difference in the scattering intensity, as compared with LDH alone. This suggests that aggregation of LDH molecules competes with correct folding and thus leads to the low spontaneous reactivation yield. PDI and abb′a′ repress self-aggregation of LDH and promote its reactivation during refolding in reducing buffer. This suggests that PDI and abb′a′ exert this effect by binding to the exposed hydrophobic regions of non-native LDH, preventing self-aggregation of the GdnHCl-denatured enzyme, rather than by involvement in formation or breaking of covalent bonds. Effects of Delayed Addition of abb′a′ or PDI on GdnHCl-denatured LDH Reactivation—The effects of the delayed addition of PDI or abb′a′ on enzymatic reactivation after the dilution of denatured LDH are shown in Fig. 3. The reactivation of LDH (final concentration, 1 μm) drops sharply when the delay in the addition of abb′a′ (or PDI) after dilution is increased, reaching the spontaneous reactivation yield after a delay of around 1 h. This suggests that both abb′a′ and PDI assist the refolding of LDH to the active state by interacting with the aggregation-prone species of LDH and thus suppress its self-aggregation. This then strongly supports that abb′a′ and PDI act as chaperones toward LDH in vitro. As the effect of PDI and abb′a′ is similar, this implies that domain c-(463–491) is dispensable to the chaperone function of PDI during reactivation of GdnHCl-denatured LDH at room temperature. Effects of abb′a′ or PDI on Aggregation of Thermally Denatured LDH—To further investigate the role of domain c in PDI structure and function, we investigated the ability of PDI and abb′a′ to prevent aggregation of LDH during thermal denaturation. 80 °C is a commonly used temperature to study non-native LDH aggregation (17Rudolph R. Zettlmeissl G. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5572-5575Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows changes in the light scattering of thermally denatured LDH in the presence of wild-type PDI at different molar ratios. For LDH alone, the scattering intensity rapidly increases with time and approaches a constant value within 4 min. Wild-type PDI, however, markedly reduces the light-scattering intensity of LDH when the molar ratio of [PDI]/[LDH] is increased to 16, indicating that LDH aggregation can be almost completely blocked under these conditions. In contrast, for abb′a′ (Fig. 4B), the intensity of light scattering of LDH increases markedly as the concentration of abb′a′ is increased, and the rate of the lightscattering change also increases with the abb′a′ concentration. At a molar ratio [abb′a′]/[LDH] of 4 or above, the light-scattering intensity reaches a maximum, decreases, and then reaches a plateau. The eventual decrease in the light-scattering intensity can be accounted for by the precipitation of aggregated-LDH and abb′a′ from solution. Thus, abb′a′ actually promotes thermally induced aggregation of the substrate protein. The higher the concentration of abb′a′, the more the LDH molecules tend to aggregate. Furthermore, the lag time becomes shorter and the rate of change in the light-scattering intensity becomes faster as the abb′a′ concentration is increased (Table I and Fig. 4, C and D). For LDH alone, the aggregation rate is slower than for LDH with abb′a′ but faster than in the presence of PDI. In contrast, Fig. 4C shows clearly that the intensity of light scattering decreases as the concentration of PDI increases. BSA as a control has no noticeable effect on the aggregation of LDH. This indicates that wild-type PDI binds to LDH under thermally denaturing conditions and suppresses aggregation; thus, it maintains its function as a chaperone under these conditions. In contrast, abb′a′ loses its chaperone function under thermally denaturing conditions.Table IFirst order rate constants for lag time and changes in light scattering of LDH in the presence of PDI or abb′a′ during 80 °C thermal denaturationMolar ratio ([chaperone]/[LDH])PDIabb′a′1Lag timeFast phaseLag timeFast phasesec×10-3 s-1sec×10-3 s-10170 ± 122.63 ± 0.99170 ± 122.63 ± 0.991192 ± 101.67 ± 0.61152 ± 185.25 ± 2.114202 ± 8.01.21 ± 0.30106 ± 157.28 ± 2.3810210 ± 120.08 ± 0.02105 ± 2119.2 ± 5.18 Open table in a new tab The light-scattering intensity of abb′a′ alone increases with increasing concentration under these conditions (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that abb′a′ is denatured and aggregated at temperatures at which PDI is still stable. It appears that aggregated abb′a′ induces more aggregation of LDH, leading to the increase in the light scattering. Eventually, the deposits of LDH and abb′a′ precipitate, which results in the decrease of the light scattering after reaching the maximum value. It is clear that abb′a′ loses the protective effect toward LDH and promotes its aggregation under thermally denaturing conditions. This suggests that domain c plays an important role in preventing PDI from self-aggregation during thermal denaturation. Changes in Conformations of abb′a′ and PDI during GdnHCl and Thermal Denaturation—Intrinsic fluorescence of abb′a′ and PDI is mainly due to the contribution of Trp residues (Trp-35, Trp-111, Trp-341, Trp-379, and Trp-390) (22Pihlajaniemi T. Helaakoski T. Tasanen K. Myllylä R. Huhtala M.L. Koivu J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 6, A–D, the emission intensities of both PDI and abb′a′ show a clear red shift as reported previously (23Churchich J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 1999; 261: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The red shift in the emission maximum for abb′a′ is slightly larger than for PDI (Fig. 6D). As seen in Fig. 6, E and F, the kinetics of unfolding is significantly faster for abb′a′ than for PDI. The decrease in fluorescence for PDI is a biphasic process, showing a fast and a slow phase (Table II), whereas for abb′a′, the decrease in fluorescence is on a single fast phase that can be detected. The first order rate constant for the single phase observed for abb′a′ is over five times larger than that of the fast phase for PDI. This indicates that abb′a′ is significantly more labile than PDI in 0.5 m GdnHCl. Furthermore, changes in the difference absorbance at 280 nm of abb′a′ as compared with the value at ambient temperature are marked when the temperature is increased above 60 °C, in contrast to PDI (Fig. 7). This indicates that abb′a′ is likewise much less stable than PDI to thermal denaturation.Table IIFirst order rate constants for changes in intrinsic fluorescence of PDI or abb′a′ in 0.5 m GdnHCl solutionIntrinsic fluorescenceFast phaseSlow phase×10-5 s-1×10-5 s-1PDI14.4 ± 2.024.46 ± 0.92abb′a′82.7 ± 9.57 Open table in a new tab Fig. 8 illustrates the effects of GdnHCl-incubated abb′a′ or PDI on reactivation of LDH. Spontaneous reactivation of LDH is only about 10% under these conditions. After GdnHCl incubation (0–1 m), PDI still exhibits chaperone function toward LDH. The maximum reactivation yield of LDH is ∼2.5-fold higher than the spontaneous reactivation yield. Under the same conditions, however, the chaperone activity of abb′a′ decreases sharply when the denaturant concentration is higher than 0.3 m and is completely lost in 1 m GdnHCl solution. This further demonstrates that the structure required for chaperone function toward LDH is more labile in the mutant abb′a′, as compared with PDI. This indicates a role of domain c in stabilization of the functional conformation of PDI. Protein disulfide isomerase is an abundant protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (24Noiva R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 481-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar); the concentration of PDI in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen is estimated to be 100–200 μm, a level comparable (or in excess of) that of newly synthesized proteins (24Noiva R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 481-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 25Freedman R.B. Bulleid N.J. Hawkins H.C. Paver J.L. Biochem. Soc.

Coexpression of PDI with human lysozyme in yeast results in an increase in the yield of native lysozyme produced (27Hayano T. Hirose M. Kikuchi M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 377: 505-511Google Scholar). This indicates that PDI is a catalyst of intracellular protein folding. In this case, the secretion of lysozyme increases even when the isomerase activity of PDI is disrupted, suggesting that the effect is related to a function of PDI other than catalysis of disulfide bond formation. This finding demonstrates that PDI lacking isomerase activity assists protein folding in vivo. LDH is an important cytoplasmic enzyme in carbohydrate metabolism (28Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure. IRL Press, Oxford1990: 191-223Google Scholar) and is commonly used as a substrate for chaperone-assisted folding in vitro. The role of domain c in the chaperone activity of PDI has been a matter of debate for some years. In 1997, Noiva et al. (2Noiva R. Onodera S. Schwaller M.D. Irwin W.A. Guzman N.A. Prolyl 4-Hydroxylase, Protein Disulfide Isomerase and Other Structurally Related Proteins. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997: 369-397Google Scholar) hypothesized that the C-terminal region could be important for the chaperone activity of PDI. Two years later, Koivunen et al. (10Koivunen P. Pirneskoski A. Karvonen P. Ljung J. Helaakoski T. Notbohm H. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) constructed 17 PDI mutants, including the mutant with residues 463–491 truncated (abb′a′). They found this mutant to be fully active as a chaperone and a disulfide isomerase, suggesting that domain c did not have a significant role in the chaperone or isomerase activities of PDI. To further investigate the function of the C-terminal region, Wang and co-workers (4Song J.L. Wang C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 29Dai Y. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27572-27576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) constructed a mutant of PDI (ABB′A′), truncated after residue 440. The mutant ABB′A′ displays isomerase activity similar to that of the intact molecule but does not show chaperone activity in assisting refolding of denatured d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The mutant abb′a′ differs from ABB′A′ in containing an additional stretch of 22 amino acid residues in the C-terminal region (441–462, Fig. 1). The mutant abb′a′ has both the chaperone and the isomerase activities of wild-type PDI, suggesting that this 22-residue region is involved in the chaperone function of PDI. Koivunen et al. (10Koivunen P. Pirneskoski A. Karvonen P. Ljung J. Helaakoski T. Notbohm H. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) reported that abb′a′ has chaperone activity of about 91% as compared with PDI. In our experiments, similar results were obtained for the reactivation and aggregation of GdnHCl-denatured LDH. Under these conditions, the functional conformation of both PDI and abb′a′ is maintained. These results then support the conclusion of Koivunen et al. (10Koivunen P. Pirneskoski A. Karvonen P. Ljung J. Helaakoski T. Notbohm H. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) that the acidic domain c is not critical for chaperone function of PDI. However, the results we obtained from thermal denaturation support the hypothesis proposed by Noiva et al. (2Noiva R. Onodera S. Schwaller M.D. Irwin W.A. Guzman N.A. Prolyl 4-Hydroxylase, Protein Disulfide Isomerase and Other Structurally Related Proteins. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997: 369-397Google Scholar). The mutant abb′a′ is prone to self-aggregation and causes increased aggregation of LDH during thermal denaturation, whereas PDI is stable. It is possible that the self-aggregation of abb′a′ induces LDH molecules to aggregate by noncovalent interaction of the aggregates, which then co-precipitate. The rapid formation of aggregates followed by sedimentation of the precipitates leads to the observed increase in the intensity of the light scattering followed by a decrease with time (Fig. 4B). This then suggests that domain c is indispensable for maintenance of the native state of PDI under thermal denaturation conditions, and this native structure must be maintained to preserve the chaperone activity of PDI toward LDH. The increased stability of wild-type PDI as compared with abb′a′ toward denaturation by GdnHCl (Fig. 6) or temperature (Fig. 7) supports this conclusion. The increased effect of GdnHCl on abb′a′ as compared with PDI when monitoring reactivation of LDH (Fig. 8) further demonstrates this point. Thus, the data presented here suggest that domain c is critical for PDI chaperone function, due to its role in stabilization of the functional conformation under extreme conditions. We are sincerely grateful to Dr. Chih-Chen Wang for the valuable suggestions regarding this work and to Dr. S. Perrett for editing this study. We thank Ya-Qun Zhang for technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2160927383,"Depressed sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca-cycling is a hallmark of human and experimental heart failure. Strategies to improve this impairment by either increasing SERCA2a levels or decreasing phospholamban (PLN) activity have been suggested as promising therapeutic targets. Indeed, ablation of PLN gene in mice was associated with greatly enhanced cardiac Ca-cycling and performance. Intriguingly, this hyperdynamic cardiac function was maintained throughout the lifetime of the mouse without observable pathological consequences. To determine the cellular alterations in the expression or modification of myocardial proteins, which are associated with the enhanced cardiac contractility, we performed a proteomics-based analysis of PLN knockout (PLN-KO) hearts in comparison to isogenic wild-types. By use of 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), approximately 3300 distinct protein spots were detected in either wild-type or PLN-KO ventricles. Protein spots observed to be altered between PLN-KO and wild-type hearts were subjected to tryptic peptide mass fingerprinting for identification by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in combination with LC/MS/MS analysis. In addition, two-dimensional 32P-autoradiography was performed to analyze the phosphorylation profiles of PLN-KO cardiomyocytes. We identified alterations in the expression level of more than 100 ventricular proteins, along with changes in phosphorylation status of important regulatory proteins in the PLN-KO. These protein changes were observed mainly in two subcellular compartments: the cardiac contractile apparatus, and metabolism/energetics. Our findings suggest that numerous alterations in protein expression and phosphorylation state occurred upon ablation of PLN and that a complex functional relationship among proteins involved in calcium handling, myofibrils, and energy production may exist to coordinately maintain the hyperdynamic cardiac contractile performance of the PLN-KO mouse in the long term."

Despite extensive studies, it currently remains unclear how Bcd activates transcription and what proteins participate in its activation process. In this report, we describe experiments to analyze the role of the Drosophila co-activator dCBP in Bcd-mediated activation. In Drosophila S2 cells, the Bcd activity is increased by the co-transfection of plasmids expressing dCBP and reduced by double-stranded RNA-mediated interference against dCBP. We further show that Bcd and dCBP can interact with each other and that Bcd-interacting domains of dCBP can cause dominant negative effects on Bcd activity in S2 cells. Our comparison of two Bcd-responsive enhancers, hunchback (hb) and knirps (kni), reveals a differential role of dCBP in facilitating Bcd activation. A dCBP mutant defective in its histone acetyltransferase activity exhibits a reduced, but not abolished, co-activator function for Bcd. Our chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments show that dCBP can increase not only the occupancy of Bcd itself at the enhancers but also the recruitment of general transcription factors to the promoter.

Transcription activation is an important and highly coordinated process requiring the actions of both gene-specific activators and co-activators (1Kadonaga J.T.

Transcriptional activators, upon binding to their target gene enhancers, are thought to achieve their activation function either by directly interacting with general transcription factors (GTFs) 1The abbreviations used are: GTF, general transcription factor; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; IP, immunoprecipitation; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; HA, hemagglutinin; RNAi, RNA interference; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA. or by interacting with co-activators. One of the well documented co-activators is CREB-binding protein (CBP), which has been shown to interact with many gene-specific activators as well as GTFs (5Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar, 6Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One function of CBP that has drawn significant attention in recent years is its ability to acetylate histones through its histone acetyltransferase (HAT) enzymatic activity. It is suggested that activator-recruited CBP can influence local chromatin structure by acetylating histones, thus enhancing promoter accessibility for GTFs. CBP and the related protein p300 can also achieve their co-activator function in a HAT-independent manner (7Zeng X. Lee H. Zhang Q. Lu H. J. Biol.

The experiments described in this report analyze the role of dCBP in transcriptional activation by the Drosophila morphogenetic protein Bicoid (Bcd). Bcd, a homeodomain protein, is required for instructing embryonic patterning of the anterior structures, including the head and thorax (9Ephrussi A. Johnston D.S. Cell. 2004; 116: 143-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 10Driever W. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 1221-1250Google Scholar). It achieves its morphogenetic activity by activating its direct target genes in early Drosophila embryos (11Rivera-Pomar R. Jackle H.

Despite its critical biological role and extensive previous studies, it remains unclear how Bcd activates transcription and what other factors participate in the activation process (15Sauer F. Hansen S.K. Tjian R. Science. 1995; 270: 1825-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Schaeffer V. Janody F. Loss C. Desplan C. Wimmer E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4461-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Another important issue on Bcd as a molecular morphogen relates to its special ability to activate different target genes in distinctive manners (13Driever W. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Nature. 1989; 337: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 17Rivera-Pomar R. Lu X. Taubert H. Perrimon N. Jackle H.

Nüsslein-Volhard C. Nature. 1989; 340: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Only recent studies have begun to shed light on this important issue, suggesting that enhancer architecture can influence how Bcd binds DNA and activates transcription (20Fu D. Zhao C. Ma J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4439-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Enhancer- and promoter-specific actions of transcription factors represent a fundamental issue because many factors including the tumor suppressor protein p53 can often function as both activators and repressors in a context-dependent manner (21Ho J. Benchimol S. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 22Thomas M.J. Seto E. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 236: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The precise mechanisms governing these switches are not well understood, but, similar to Bcd, enhancer characteristics may play an important role (23Lee K.C. Crowe A.J. Barton M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 24Johnson R.A. Ince T.A. Scotto K.W. J. Biol.

In this report, we describe experiments demonstrating that activation by Bcd in Drosophila S2 cells is dependent on dCBP and that these two proteins physically interact with each other. Activation by Bcd from the enhancer elements of two different target genes of Bcd, hunchback (hb) and knirps (kni), is differentially affected by dCBP, and functional interactions on these enhancers are dependent on distinct Bcd and dCBP domains. A HAT-deficient mutant of dCBP remains its ability, although with a reduced efficiency, to increase the Bcd activity in S2 cells. Our chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis further demonstrates that dCBP can increase the occupancy of Bcd at target enhancers in cells. In addition, dCBP can increase the histone acetylation status and facilitate the recruitment of GTFs to the reporter promoter. These results suggest that dCBP participates in the activation process of Bcd through multiple mechanisms and contributes to enhancer-specific activities of Bcd. Plasmid Construction—Plasmids used in this study and their sources are listed in Table I. Effector plasmids for Bcd and dCBP derivatives generated in this study are based on the pAc5.1/V5-His vector (Invitrogen) and encode an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag for each protein. To construct pFY408 and pFY409, bcd coding sequences, generated as PCR products, were first cloned into the NdeI-XbaI sites of the pGEM3-based vector pFY441 (26Zhao C. Dave V. Yang F. Scarborough T. Ma J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8112-8123Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The HindIII-XbaI fragments were then isolated and cloned into the expression vector pFY442 (26Zhao C. Dave V. Yang F. Scarborough T. Ma J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8112-8123Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The GST-Bcd fusion plasmid pDF364 was generated by cloning appropriate PCR product into the EcoRI-XbaI sites of the pGEX-KG-based vector pAY564 (27Zhao C. Fu D. Dave V. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43901-43909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The plasmids for in vitro synthesis of dCBP fragments (pDF370, pDF371, and pDF373) were generated by cloning the appropriate PCR products into the NdeI-XbaI sites of pFY441 (26Zhao C. Dave V. Yang F. Scarborough T. Ma J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8112-8123Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The HindIII-XbaI fragments from pDF370, pDF371, and pDF373 were then cloned into pFY442 to generate the S2 cell expression plasmids pDF376, pDF377, and pDF378, respectively. To generate pDF536, a PCR product of dCBP sequence (bp 583–1463) (28Akimaru H. Chen Y. Dai P. Hou D.X. Nonaka M. Smolik S.M. Armstrong S. Goodman R.H. Ishii S.

Zhao C. Ma J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4439-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA in each transfection was 10 μg as adjusted by salmon sperm DNA. Both CAT assays and Western blotting analyses were normalized according to the transfection efficiency monitored by β-galactosidase activity from the control plasmid pCopia-lacZ. CAT activity was measured as previously described (26Zhao C. Dave V. Yang F. Scarborough T. Ma J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8112-8123Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and expressed as -fold activation over the activity obtained without effector plasmids. GST Pull-down—Expression of GST fusion proteins in bacteria was carried out according to Zhao et al. (27Zhao C. Fu D. Dave V. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43901-43909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of GST or GST-Bcd derivatives were coupled to a 50-μl slurry (1:1 v/v) of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with the binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1× proteinase inhibitor mixture) and used to pull down in vitro translated and 35S-labeled dCBP fragments in 200 μl of binding buffer. After being washed three times with 500 μl of binding buffer, the precipitated products were resolved by SDS-PAGE (7.5%) and analyzed on an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP)—Nuclear extracts were prepared from S2 cells transfected with appropriate effector plasmids according to Ausubel et al. (30Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994Google Scholar). 40-μl nuclear extracts were then diluted with the IP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 160 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) to a final volume of 200 μl and incubated with 8 μl of anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) at 4 °C for 1 h. 50 μl of Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added and further incubated at 4 °C overnight. After being washed three times with the IP buffer, the precipitated products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot using an anti-HA antibody (1:500 finial dilution, Babco). All experiments were conducted in duplicates with similar results. RNA Interference (RNAi)—Double-stranded dCBP RNA (dsRNA) was generated according to Pile et al. (31Pile L.A. Spellman P.T. Katzenberger R.J. Wassarman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37840-37848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of linear template DNA (pDF536) was used to synthesize two opposite strands of RNA using the MEGAscript T3/T7 kit (Ambion). Equal amounts of sense and antisense RNAs were annealed in a buffer (5 mm KCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4) by heating to 95 °C for 10 min and slowly cooling to room temperature. RNAi in S2 cells was carried out as described by Clemens et al. (32Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemmings B.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼1 × 106 S2 cells were seeded in a 60-mm tissue culture dish and set for about 1 h. Then the culture media were removed and replaced by 2 ml of serum-free medium. 25 μgof dCBP dsRNAs was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. 4 ml of medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) were then added to the culture dish and incubated 24 h prior to transient transfection. The cells were harvested within 4 days for CAT assays. ChIP—Antibodies against acetylated histones H3 (K18) and H4 (K5, K8, K12, and K16) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), anti-HA antibody was from Babco, and antibodies against Drosophila TBP and TFIIB were kindly provided by Dr. Jim Kadonaga. ChIP assays were performed according to Chen et al. (33Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) and Upstate Biotechnology. PCR primers used to detect the presence of the precipitated DNA sequences were as follows: hb-E5 (5′-GTCGACTCCTGACCAACGTAAT) and hb-E3 (5′-AGAGGTGACGGGAAGTCAGGTA) for the hb enhancer; hb-Core5 (5′-GTCACCTCTGCCCATCTAATCC) and hb-CAT3 (5′-CATTGGGATATATCAACGGTGG) for the E1b core promoter of the hb-CAT reporter gene; and kni-E5 (5′-CTAGGATAATCTGCAGCTTAGG) and kni-E3 (5′-TGTTCTTTACGATGCCATTGGG) for the kni enhancer/promoter region. In addition to the input control shown in the figures, another internal control (using a DNA template exogenously added prior to ethanol precipitation) was included to ensure comparable efficiency for steps such as ethanol precipitation, PCR, and gel loading (not shown). Bcd Activity Is Regulated by dCBP in S2 Cells—dCBP, encoded by nejire (nej), is a co-activator for several activators including Dorsal (Dl) (34Akimaru H. Hou D.X. Ishii S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), Cubitus interruptus (Ci) (28Akimaru H. Chen Y. Dai P. Hou D.X. Nonaka M. Smolik S.M. Armstrong S. Goodman R.H. Ishii S. Nature. 1997; 386: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), Mad (35Waltzer L. Bienz M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1630-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and Deformed (Dfd) (36Florence B. McGinnis W. Genetics. 1998; 150: 1497-1511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our analysis of early even-skipped (eve) expression revealed that a fraction of the embryos (∼30%) from nej3/FM7c females had weaker expression for several stripes, including stripe 2 (data not shown). Since eve stripe 2 is activated by both Bcd and Hb (37Small S. Kraut R. Hoey T. Warrior R. Levine M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), it is possible that dCBP may play a role in activation by either Bcd or Hb or both. To directly analyze the role of dCBP in Bcd-mediated activation, we conducted a co-transfection analysis in Drosophila S2 cells. We used an hb-CAT reporter gene, which contained the 250-bp Bcd-responsive hb enhancer element (13Driever W. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Nature. 1989; 337: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) upstream of the bacterial reporter gene CAT, to measure the activation function of Bcd. We co-transfected into S2 cells the hb-CAT reporter gene and an effector plasmid (at different concentrations) expressing full-length Bcd, with or without another effector plasmid expressing full-length dCBP. As shown in Fig. 1A, the dCBP-expressing plasmid increased the CAT reporter activity by 5–19-fold depending on Bcd concentrations. The most robust effect of dCBP was observed at low concentrations of Bcd (lanes 3–6); due to this observation, all of our subsequent co-activation assays in S2 cells were carried out at low Bcd concentrations. Transfected dCBP did not increase reporter activity in the absence of Bcd (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2), indicating that the effect of dCBP is Bcd-dependent. In addition, transfected dCBP did not increase the accumulated cellular levels of Bcd (Fig. 1B), suggesting a direct effect on Bcd function. To determine the role of endogenous dCBP on Bcd function in S2 cells, we used the double-stranded RNAi technique to inhibit endogenous dCBP expression. In this analysis, dCBP dsRNA was transfected into S2 cells prior to the transfection of the hb-CAT reporter and Bcd effector plasmids. Our experiments showed that dCBP RNAi treatment reduced the CAT reporter activity at all Bcd concentrations tested (Fig. 1C). The observed effect of dCBP RNAi treatment on reporter activity is direct and Bcd-dependent: the RNAi treatment did not alter reporter activity in the absence of Bcd (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 2) and had no adverse effect on the accumulated cellular levels of Bcd (Fig. 1D). In addition, dsRNA sequences that were unrelated to dCBP did not affect Bcd-induced reporter activity (Fig. 1C, inset). Together, these experiments suggest that dCBP plays a co-activator role for Bcd, directly increasing its ability to activate transcription from the hb-CAT reporter gene in S2 cells. Bcd and dCBP Interact with Each Other—To determine whether Bcd and dCBP can interact with each other, we carried out a co-IP analysis. Nuclear extracts were prepared from S2 cells that had been transfected with plasmids expressing both HA-tagged full-length Bcd and V5-tagged full-length dCBP. The extracts were subjected to co-IP using an antibody against the V5 tag, and the precipitated products were analyzed in a Western blot using an anti-HA antibody. Our results showed that Bcd was co-precipitated efficiently by dCBP (Fig. 2A, lane 7). Under the same conditions, Bcd was also co-precipitated efficiently by a full-length dCBP mutant (Fig. 2A, lane 8; also see below), which is defective in its HAT enzymatic activity (29Ludlam W.H. Taylor M.H. Tanner K.G. Denu J.M. Goodman R.H. Smolik S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3832-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To further analyze the interaction between Bcd and dCBP, we carried out a GST pull-down analysis. Full-length Bcd was expressed as a GST fusion protein in bacteria and used to pull down in vitro synthesized and radioactive labeled fragments of dCBP. Our results showed that Bcd could pull down efficiently all three dCBP fragments tested (Fig. 2B, lane 3): 383–1090, 1677–2608, and 2040–3190 (see Fig. 2C for diagrams of dCBP derivatives). GST alone failed to pull down efficiently any of these dCBP fragments (Fig. 2B, lane 2), indicating that the detected interaction is Bcd-specific. Our deletion analysis of Bcd further revealed that the homeodomain alone was insufficient to interact with these dCBP fragments (data not shown), suggesting that Bcd protein sequences outside its homeodomain are required for efficient interaction with dCBP in vitro. Differential Effect of dCBP on the hb and kni Enhancer Elements—Our recent experiments have shown that Bcd can exhibit distinctive behaviors on different enhancer elements (20Fu D. Zhao C. Ma J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4439-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To determine whether dCBP may participate in enhancer-specific activities of Bcd, we took advantage of another reporter gene, kni-CAT, which contains the 64-bp Bcd-responsive kni enhancer element (17Rivera-Pomar R. Lu X. Taubert H. Perrimon N. Jackle H. Nature. 1995; 376: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Our co-transfection experiments showed that, whereas dCBP increased the activity of Bcd on hb-CAT reporter by 19 fold (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2), the co-activation role of dCBP on the kni-CAT reporter was only 3-fold (lanes 3 and 4). Our experiments with dCBP RNAi further confirmed that the Bcd activity on the hb-CAT reporter was more dependent on endogenous dCBP than on the kni-CAT reporter (Fig. 3B). Neither dCBP transfection nor RNAi treatment altered the reporter activities in the absence of Bcd (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Together, these results suggest that Bcd can differentially respond to the co-activator function of dCBP on different enhancers. Distinct Bcd and dCBP Domains Are Engaged in Functional Interactions on hb and kni Enhancer Elements—To define Bcd domains mediating the dCBP co-activation function, we analyzed different Bcd deletion derivatives in co-activation assays (see Fig. 4C for schematic diagrams of the derivatives). We also compared the behaviors of these derivatives on hb-CAT and kni-CAT reporter genes. Whereas the entire C-terminal portion of Bcd (residues 152–489) was important in responding to dCBP on both hb-CAT and kni-CAT reporters (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 5–8), subdomains within this portion appeared to play different roles on these two reporters. For example, Bcd-(1–246) responded to dCBP as efficiently as WT Bcd did on kni-CAT, but such response was reduced on hb-CAT (Fig. 4, A and B, compare lanes 9 and 10 with lanes 1 and 2). The N terminus of Bcd (residues 1–91) also exhibited different roles on these two reporters. Whereas the removal of this domain had little effect on the hb-CAT reporter (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4), it significantly reduced both the activity of Bcd and its responsiveness to dCBP on the kni-CAT reporter (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). Further analysis suggested that residues 42–91 of Bcd were important for mediating the dCBP co-activation function on the kni-CAT reporter (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 13 and 14 with lanes 3 and 4). Together, these results suggest that different Bcd domains are differentially utilized to respond to dCBP on hb-CAT and kni-CAT reporters. Our GST pull-down experiments described above showed that multiple dCBP domains can interact with Bcd in vitro (Fig. 2B). To determine whether individual Bcd-interacting domains of dCBP may cause dominant negative effects in S2 cells, we conducted co-transfection experiments using dCBP fragments (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 5A, the dCBP-(1677–2608) fragment reduced the Bcd activity on the hb-CAT reporter gene in a concentration-dependent manner, up to nearly 6-fold (lane 5). In the absence of Bcd, dCBP-(1677–2608) had no effect on reporter activity (data not shown). A comparison of such dominant negative effect of three dCBP fragments revealed significant differences on hb-CAT and kni-CAT reporters (Fig. 5, B and C). Together, these experiments suggest that Bcd and dCBP may use different interaction modes on the hb and kni enhancer elements, relying on distinct Bcd and dCBP domains. Enhancer Characteristics Influence the Role of dCBP on Bcd Activity—Both hb and kni enhancer elements contain six Bcd binding sites, but these sites are arranged differently (Fig. 6B). Whereas all of the Bcd binding sites in the kni enhancer element are arranged in symmetric pairs separated by short spacing (17Rivera-Pomar R. Lu X. Taubert H. Perrimon N. Jackle H.

https://openalex.org/W1989847145,"In this paper we show that DNA polymerase lambda (pol lambda) interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in vivo in human cells. Moreover, by using recombinant mutated PCNA, we could demonstrate that pol lambda interacts with both the interdomain-connecting loop and the nearby hydrophobic pocket on the anterior of PCNA and that critical residues within a helix-hairpin-helix domain of pol lambda, important for proper DNA primer binding, are also involved in the enzyme's interaction with PCNA. Finally, we show that the tumor suppressor protein p21(WAF1/CIP1) can efficiently compete in vitro with pol lambda for binding to PCNA. Given the high rate of frameshift mutations induced by pol lambda and its ability to bypass abasic sites, accurate regulation of pol lambda activity by PCNA and p21 concerted action might be important for preventing genetic instability."
https://openalex.org/W2020591137,"Dosage compensation is a process that equalizes transcription activity between the sexes. In Drosophila, two non-coding RNA, roX1 and roX2, and at least six protein regulators, MSL-1, MSL-2, MSL-3, MLE, MOF, and JIL-1, have been identified as essential for dosage compensation. Although there is accumulating evidence of the intricate functional and physical interactions between protein and RNA regulators, little is known about how roX RNA expression and function are modulated in coordination with protein regulators. In this report, we have found that a relatively short (about 350 bp) upstream genomic region of the roX2 gene, Prox2, harbors an activity that drives transcription of the downstream gene. Our study has shown that MLE can stimulate the transcription activity of Prox2 and that MLE associates with Prox2 through direct interaction with a newly identified 54-bp repeat, Prox. Our observations suggest a novel mechanism by which roX2 RNA is regulated at the transcriptional level. Dosage compensation is a process that equalizes transcription activity between the sexes.

The transcription activity of the X chromosome must be equalized between the sexes during development, and any failure in this process leads to embryonic lethality (1Pannuti A. Lucchesi J.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 2Park Y. Kuroda M.I. Science. 2001; 293: 1083-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Diverse mechanisms have evolved to reconcile the differences in X chromosome dosage. Eutherian mammals suppress the transcription activity of one of their two X chromosomes in females (3Brockdorff N.

On the other hand, Drosophila males (XO) double the transcription activity of their single X chromosome (7Kelley R.L. Kuroda M.I.

In humans and Drosophila, dosage compensation is achieved by opposite processes, i.e. by transcriptional repression and activation, respectively. Despite this difference, it is intriguing to find that both processes involve non-coding RNAs that associate with the X chromosome. In humans, XIST (Xinactivation-specific transcript), synthesized from the inactive X chromosome, physically coats the entire inactive X chromosome, conferring an inactive status (10Hong Y.K.

In contrast, in Drosophila, roX1 and roX2, two RNAs originating from the male X chromosome, associate with hundreds of sites on the X chromosome, making it transcriptionally hyperactive (13Meller V.H.

To date, genetic analysis has identified eight transacting factors that are necessary for the onset or maintenance of dosage compensation in Drosophila. Based on observations that loss of their functional allele leads to a male-specific lethal phenotype, these factors are named the MSL 1The abbreviations used are: MSL, male-specific lethal; MLE, maleless; MOF, male-absent on the first; dsDNA, double strand DNA; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Prox2, the upstream promoter of the roX2 gene; roX, RNA on the X; S2, Schneider 2; WCE, whole cell extract. (male-specific lethal) proteins. They include MSL1 (15Palmer M.J. Mergner V.A. Richman R. Manning J.E. Kuroda M.I. Lucchesi J.C.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1005-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that dosage compensation occurs in several discernible steps, starting with the targeted association of roX RNAs and MSL complex with the X chromosome. Upon the expression of MSL2 protein, MSL proteins assemble a complex on ∼35 sites of the X chromosome, called “chromatin entry sites” (22Kageyama Y. Mengus G. Gilfillan G. Kennedy H.G. Stuckenholz C. Kelley R.L. Becker P.B. Kuroda M.I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2236-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 23Kelley R.L. Meller V.H. Gordadze P.R. Roman G. Davis R.L. Kuroda M.I.

Biol. 2000; 10: 136-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Once the chromatin entry sites are fully occupied with the MSL complex in the presence of MLE, the flanking chromatin region becomes competent in binding the MSL complex. This “spreading” or “nucleation” process appears to require the histone acetyltransferase activity of MOF (25Gu W. Wei X. Pannuti A. Lucchesi J.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5202-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We previously reported that mleGET, a mutant MLE defective in ATPase activity, led to poor association of the MSL complex with the male X chromosome and to lethality of male embryos (26Lee C.G. Chang K.A. Kuroda M.I. Hurwitz J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the expression of mleGET in place of the wild type MLE resulted in the formation of the MSL complex devoid of roX2 RNA (25Gu W. Wei X. Pannuti A. Lucchesi J.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5202-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Mof, which lacks histone acetyltransferase activity, was unable to support the spreading of MSL complexes on the X chromosome and also drastically reduced the association of MLE with the X chromosome (25Gu W. Wei X. Pannuti A. Lucchesi J.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5202-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, lack of histone acetyltransferase activity did not influence the association of MSL complex with roX RNAs in nucleoplasm and with the chromatin entry sites. Although the underlying mechanism remains unknown, it is likely that MLE plays a critical role in determining the intracellular level of roX2 RNA or its interaction with MSL complexes or the chromatin entry sites. In this report, we have provided evidence indicating that MLE regulates roX2 RNA at the transcriptional level. Genomic Cloning of Prox2 and Construction of a Reporter Plasmid, Prox2-luciferase—About 1 × 104 of Schneider 2 (S2) cells, grown in a serum-free medium (Invitrogen), were re-suspended in 200 μl of a solution consisting of Tween 20 (0.5%) and proteinase K (60 μg/ml) and incubated at 56 °C for 4 h and then at 95 °C for 30 min. Using an aliquot of lysate (5 μl) as template, genomic PCR was performed in a mixture (50 μl) containing 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1× PCR buffer II (PerkinElmer), 0.25 mm dNTP, AmpliTaq polymerase (5 units; PerkinElmer), and a pair of primers, Prox2–5 and Prox2–3 (for sequences, see Fig. 1B). Reaction condition was as follows: 4 min at 95 °C, 35 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 57 °C, 1 min at 67 °C, and 7 min at 72 °C. PCR product, purified by spin column (Qiagen), was digested by HindIII and NheI, and subcloned into pGL3-basic (Promega). Three independent positive clones, all containing a 0.5-kb insert (Fig. 1C), were confirmed by DNA sequencing and named Prox2-luciferase. Transient Transfection Assay—A construct pMt/Hy-MSL2-HA, expressing HA-tagged MSL2 upon copper sulfate treatment, was kindly provided by Dr. J. Lucchesi. pMT-MLE and pMT-MSL1, expressing FLAG-tagged proteins, were constructed as follows. Full-length cDNAs, coding for MLE and MSL1, were PCR-amplified using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and inserted into pMT/V5 vector (Invitrogen). Detailed procedures are available upon request. S2 cells grown in 6-well culture plates at ∼20% confluence were transfected with 1 μg of Prox2-luciferase, 20 ng of pMT/V5-β-galactosidase (Invitrogen), and varying amounts (0.4–1.2 μg) of the indicated pMT construct (Fig. 5A) using the standard calcium phosphate method. After 24 h of incubation, cells were supplied with fresh media (Drosophila-SFM; Invitrogen) containing 0.5 mm copper sulfate. On the following day, cells were harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (1× PBS) and resuspended in 200 μl of a lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 2 mm DTT. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured as described previously (27Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. Parvin J.D. Montminy M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Isolation of FLAG-tagged MSL1—For experiments with FLAG-tagged MSL1 protein (Fig. 3), S2 cells seeded on 10 culture plates (90 mm) at a density of 1 × 106 cells/plate, were transfected with 4 μg of pMT-MSL1. The total amount of DNA was kept constant (10 μg) using empty pMT vector. On the following day, cells were supplied with 0.5 mm copper sulfate. After 48 h of incubation, cells were harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (1× PBS) and resuspended in two packed-cell volumes of lysis buffer consisting of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm DTT. Cell lysate was sonicated for 5 s, centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and then mixed with 1/10 volume of 10× PBS and 100 μl of M2 affinity gel (Sigma). After 4 h of incubation on a nutator at 4 °C, followed by washing four times with 1× PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (1× PBST), M2 affinity gel was packed into a 1-ml pipette tip, and bound proteins were eluted with 1× PBST containing the FLAG peptide (200 μg/ml; Sigma) at a rate of 150 μl/fraction. This procedure yielded about 30 μg of FLAG-tagged MSL1, measured using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay—Two complementary primers, Prox-A and Prox-B, were synthesized to contain a 6-nucleotide overhang at the 5′-end upon their annealing. Their sequences are 5′-TTGGAATCCCGCTATTTTCGGATTC ATGCAGTTCCCATTATATTTTATTCGGTA-3′ and 5′-TACCGAATAAAATATAAT GGGAACTGCATGAATCCGAAAATAGCGGGA-3′. Annealing of Prox-A (20 pmol) and Prox-B (25 pmol) was performed in a solution (34 μl) containing 5 μl of 10× NEB buffer I (0.1 m Bis Tris propane-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 m MgCl2, 10 mm DTT) by incubating at 94 °C for 5 min, 63 °C for 8 h, followed by slowly cooling down to 25 °C. Subsequently, primer mixture was provided with 2 μl of 2 mm dATP/dGTP/dTTP, 1 μl of 0.1 mm dCTP, 10 μl of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 1 μl of 0.1 m DTT, and Klenow fragment (10 units; New England Biolabs). After 30 min of incubation at 25 °C, 2 μlof0.5 m EDTA was added to the above mixture. An aliquot (0.5 μl) was subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation to measure specific radioactivity of annealed Prox probe. The rest was loaded onto a G50 column (5 ml) equilibrated with 1× TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA). When eluted at a rate of 200 μl/fraction, annealed Prox probe was recovered in fractions 9–11. Unless otherwise described, electrophoresis mobility shift assay was performed in a mixture (10 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 7 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.25 μg of a 1-kb DNA ladder (Invitrogen), and 50 fmol of annealed Prox probe. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, reaction mixtures were resolved by electrophoresis for 90 min at 19 mA on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel (30:1) containing 5% glycerol and 0.5× TBE. Complexes formed with Prox were visualized by autoradiography. RT-PCR Analysis—S2 cells were transfected with the indicated pMT/V5 construct (5 μg) as described above. On the following day, cells were provided with 0.5 mm copper sulfate and incubated for an additional 48 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min, washed with ice-cold 1× PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of Ultraspec reagent (Biotecx). Total RNA, isolated by the recommended procedure, was dissolved in 85 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated distilled water and mixed with 10 μl of 10× DNase I buffer and 5 μl of RNase-free DNase I (Promega). After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, RNA was repurified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. About 85–100 μg of RNA was obtained from 1 × 107 S2 cells. Primary cDNA was prepared with an aliquot (1 μg) of total RNA using Superscript RT II (Invitrogen) following the recommended procedure. An aliquot of cDNA (1 μl) was added in a mixture (50 μl) containing 1× Advantage II PCR buffer, 0.25 mm dNTP mix, 30 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, Advantage II polymerase (Clontech), and a mixture of four PCR primer sets (10 pmol/primer): MSL1–5, 5′-GAAGATCTATGAGCG CCA-3′, and MSL1–3, 5′-CTGCTTTAATTCCTCATTCTGCG-3′; dSRP-K1–5, 5′-GATGAA TGCAACGTCCACGTAAAG-3′, and dSRPK1–3, 5′-CATCCTTTTGCGACCACTCGTAC T-3′; MLE-5, 5′-CAAAACCTCGGTGAATTGCAGCAA-3′, and MLE-3, 5′-CTGATCCTC TATTGCTTTCAAATG-3′; roX2–5, 5′-TTGGCATTTTGCTCTTGTTTTTCTC-3′, and ro-X2–3, 5′-CGTTACTCTTGCTTCATTTTGCTTCG-3′. PCR was performed as follows: 1 min at 95 °C, 25 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 1.5 min at 68 °C, and 7 min at 68 °C. PCR products were purified using a spin column (Qiagen), and aliquots (10%, 2.5 μl) were resolved on a 2% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE. PCR products were visualized by ethidium staining and autoradiography and quantified by Instant β-Imager (Packard). Identification of the Upstream Genomic Sequence of the roX2 Gene—When ectopically expressed, MSL2 induces dosage compensation even in female flies (17Kelley R.L. Solovyeva I. Lyman L.M. Richman R. Solovyev V. Kuroda M.I. Cell. 1995; 81: 867-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 28Copps K. Richman R. Lyman L.M. Chang K.A. Rampersad-Ammons J. Kuroda M.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5409-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because roX RNAs are critical for dosage compensation, transcription of the corresponding genes, which are suppressed in female flies, must be activated in these transgenic female flies expressing MSL2. To understand the mechanism underlying transcription activation of the roX2 gene, we attempted to identify an upstream genomic region potentially important for transcriptional regulation of the roX2 gene. The 14-kb chromosomal region containing the roX2 gene is depicted in Fig. 1A. Five genes, including A, B, C, roX2, and nod, are identified in the sense template, and two genes, D and E, are in the antisense template. A 350-bp intergenic region, which we title Prox2, is present between CG11695 and the roX2 gene and contains a T-rich region at position –331 to –150 and a 54-bp repeated sequence at position –261 to –154. To confirm the above sequence information obtained from the fly genome data base, we performed PCR using two primers, Prox2–5 and Prox2–3, and genomic DNA isolated from S2 cells as a template. PCR primers were designed to contain restriction enzyme cleavage sites, NheI and HindIII (Fig. 1B). The PCR product was subsequently treated with NheI and HindIII, reisolated (Fig. 1C, lane 2), and inserted into pGL3-basic that was precleaved with BamH1 and HindIII (Fig. 1C, lane 1). Three independent clones, containing 0.5-kb inserts, were sequenced, which verified the identified sequence presented in Fig. 1A, including the 54-bp repeat present within the upstream region of the roX2 gene. We named this newly identified 54-bp repeat Prox. Detection of Prox Binding Activity in S2 Cell Extracts—The 54-bp repeat (Prox) present in the intergenic region upstream of the roX2 gene prompted us to determine whether it serves as a cis-acting element for transacting factors. We tested this possibility, employing electrophoresis mobility shift assay using whole cell extracts (WCE) prepared from S2 cells and 32P-labeled Prox as probe. Indeed, WCE of S2 cells exhibited an ability to form stable complexes with 32P-labeled Prox in the presence of 200-fold molar excess of nonspecific dsDNA competitor (Fig. 2A, lane 2). To further explore the specificity of Prox-protein complexes, we supplemented the electrophoresis mobility shift assay reactions with 25- and 100-fold molar excess of dsDNA competitors, as shown in Fig. 2B, in addition to 250 ng of nonspecific DNA. A drastic reduction in the complex formation was observed with Prox (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). XorP, a 54-bp synthetic dsDNA containing the reverse sequence of Prox, was less efficient in competing with 32P-labeled Prox (lanes 5 and 6). Because the (A + T) sequence accounts for about 64% of Prox, we also tested whether the (A + T)-richness is an important sequence feature for the formation of Prox-protein complexes. For this purpose, a 24-bp dsDNA, TA:AT, containing solely the (A + T) sequence was synthesized and compared with Prox. As shown in Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8, TA:AT only weakly influenced the formation of Prox-protein complexes. These results indicate that S2 cells contain a factor that specifically recognizes and associates with Prox. A Direct Interaction of MLE with Prox in Vitro—Among all known transacting factors involved in dosage compensation, MLE is the only protein that possesses demonstrated DNA binding activity (26Lee C.G. Chang K.A. Kuroda M.I. Hurwitz J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 29Zhou K. Choe K.T. Zaidi Z. Wang Q. Mathews M.B. Lee C.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2253-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, MSL1 contains an acidic domain that is often found among proteins possessing DNA binding activity (15Palmer M.J. Mergner V.A. Richman R. Manning J.E. Kuroda M.I. Lucchesi J.C. Genetics. 1993; 134: 545-557PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether any of these factors are capable of interacting with Prox, we expressed and purified MSL1 and MLE. A detailed procedure for the purification of recombinant MLE was described previously (26Lee C.G. Chang K.A. Kuroda M.I. Hurwitz J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). MSL1 was overexpressed in S2 cells using pMT/V5 vector (Invitrogen) (Fig. 3). Expression of either FLAG-tagged MLE (lane 2) or FLAG-tagged MSL1 (lane 4) in S2 cells upon treatment of copper sulfate was confirmed by Western blot analysis, as summarized in Fig. 3A. It should be noted that although the estimated molecular mass of MSL1 is 105 kDa, it migrates more slowly than predicted on SDS-PAGE (lane 4, asterisk), as reported previously (17Kelley R.L. Solovyeva I. Lyman L.M. Richman R. Solovyev V. Kuroda M.I. Cell. 1995; 81: 867-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 30Chang K.A. Kuroda M.I.

Employing M2-affinity chromatography, MSL1 was successfully isolated from whole cell extracts (Fig. 3B). An additional protein of about 55 kDa is believed to be a major degradation product of MSL1 because it cross-reacts with anti-MSL1 antibodies (data not shown). To compare their ability to interact with Prox, either MSL1 (120 ng) or MLE (65 ng) was incubated in a reaction mixture containing 50 fmol (∼1.8 ng) of 32P-labeled Prox and 250 ng of nonspecific dsDNA in the presence or absence of ATP and were subsequently analyzed on native gel. As shown in Fig. 3C, MLE, but not MSL1, exhibited an ability to form complexes with Prox in an ATP-independent manner. MSL1 did not react with Prox even in the absence of nonspecific DNA competitor (data not shown). Our results indicate that at least MLE is capable of interacting with Prox in a sequence-specific fashion. Interaction of Prox and roX2-DHS with MLE in Vitro—It is generally accepted that MSL proteins assemble a complex on the male X chromosome in a sequence-specific manner, including ∼35 sites of X chromosome called “chromatin entry sites” (22Kageyama Y.

Because there is no apparent sequence similarity between Prox and roX-DHS, we tested whether roX2-DHS, a consensus MSL binding site identified within the coding sequence of the roX2 gene (32Park Y.

For this purpose, 135 bp of roX2-DHS was amplified by PCR in the presence or absence of [α-32P]dCTP and used as competitor or probe in reactions containing 65 ng of MLE. As shown in Fig. 4A, molar excess (4- or 20-fold) of unlabeled Prox efficiently competed with Prox for MLE (compare lane 2 with lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, poor competition was observed with either roX2-DHS (lanes 3 and 4), TA:AT (lanes 7 and 8), or xorP (data not shown). In addition, when incubated in the presence of only 250 ng of nonspecific DNA competitor, roX2-DHS was not able to form complexes with MLE (Fig. 4B, lane 2). Essentially the same results were obtained with a 143-bp DNA containing a full 54-bp repeat sequence. These results support a sequence-specific interaction between MLE and Prox. Activation of Prox2-driven Transcription by MLE, MSL1, and MSL2—Considering that induction of dosage compensation in female flies by ectopic expression of MSL2 should be accompanied with transcription activation of the roX genes (17Kelley R.L. Solovyeva I. Lyman L.M. Richman R. Solovyev V. Kuroda M.I. Cell. 1995; 81: 867-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), it is tempting to posit that more than one cis-acting element is involved in the process of dosage compensation or that MLS2, and perhaps MSL1, executes its function to initiate roX2 transcription through the activation of MLE (see “Discussion”). Taking the above possibilities into consideration, we examined whether the interaction between MLE and Prox influences the transcription activity of Prox2 and whether MSL1 or MSL2 also alters the transcription activity of Prox2. For this purpose, 1 μg of Prox2-luciferase construct (Fig. 1D) was co-transfected with increasing amounts (0.4–1.2 μg) of pMT/V5 construct expressing MLE, MSL1, or MSL2. The presence of Prox per se increased luciferase activity up to 4-fold (data not shown). This result indicates that Prox functions as a cis-acting element and transcriptionally activates downstream genes such as luciferase. Although it appears that transacting factors reacting with Prox are not limited in S2 cells, ectopic expression of MLE further stimulated transcription activity of Prox about 2-fold (Fig. 5A, lanes 2 and 3). Though slightly less efficient, similar results were obtained with MSL1 and MSL2 (lanes 4–7). Interestingly, it appears that the extent of transcription activation is proportional to intracellular levels of ectopically expressed MLE, MSL1, and MSL2 in S2 cells (compare Figs. 3A and 5A). We next examined whether exogenously expressed MLE or MSL proteins influence the endogenous roX2 gene. Considering that intracellular levels of endogenous MLE and MSL proteins are sufficiently high to support Prox-driven transcription, we anticipated only marginal change, if any, in the expression of the roX2 gene by exogenous MLE or MSL proteins. For this purpose, we employed transient transfection assays coupled with semi-quantitative RT-PCR. In brief, total RNAs were isolated from S2 cells transfected with pMT/V5 construct expressing MLE, MSL1, or MSL2. Subsequently, RT-PCR was performed in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP and four pairs of PCR primers specific for MLE, MSL1, roX2, and SRPK1. Under optimized conditions, the PCR reaction containing all four pairs of primers (Fig. 5B, lane 5), performed either for 25 or 30 cycles, produced a mixture of products whose overall yield was seemingly comparable with a PCR reaction performed with only a pair of cognate primers (compare lanes 1–4 with lane 5). Treatment of total RNA with DNase I was essential for the reproducibility of semiquantitative RT-PCR containing a mixture of primers (data not shown). The two PCR products for roX2, obtained with pre-mRNA containing an intron and a mature mRNA (24Meller V.H. Gordadze P.R. Park Y. Chu X. Stuckenholz C. Kelley R.L. Kuroda M.I. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 136-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), are presented as roX2–1 and roX2–2, respectively. PCR reactions were performed for 25 cycles using total RNAs isolated from S2 cells expressing the indicated protein as template in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. Aliquots (2 μl) were analyzed on 2% agarose gel. Subsequent to staining with ethidium bromide, PCR products were visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 5C), which shows that the mRNA level for MLE (lane 2) or MSL1 (lane 3) was increased in S2 cells transfected with a cognate pMT/V5 construct. To determine the effect of increased MLE, MSL1, or MSL2 on roX2 expression, PCR products were quantified by Instant β-Imager, normalized to the level of SRPK1 mRNA, and compared with those obtained with total RNAs isolated from S2 cells transfected with empty pMT/V5 vector. As summarized in Fig. 5D, transfection of S2 cells with pMT-MLE or pMT-MSL1 led to increases in their own mRNA levels of about 2-fold (lanes 2 and 3). In addition, overexpression of MLE or MSL1 caused noticeable changes in roX2 mRNA levels, with an ∼12.5 or 11% increase, respectively (Fig. 5D, lanes 2 and 3, filled bars). Although far less efficient than those obtained with a reporter construct (Fig. 5A), the effect of MLE or MSL1 on the endogenous roX2 gene was reproducible. Interestingly, a much broader impact was observed with MSL2. Overexpression of MSL2 (see Fig. 3A, lane 6) increased both MSL1 and roX2 mRNAs about 20 and 4%, respectively but decreased MLE mRNA about 25% (Fig. 5D, lane 4). It is intriguing to note that the relative extent of increase in endogenous roX2 gene expression by MLE, MSL1, or MSL2 is proportional to that of luciferase expression driven by Prox (compare Fig. 5, A and D). These results suggest that the activation of Prox-driven transcription in either a reporter construct or in a chromosomal context might be mechanistically similar and that MLE plays an active role in that process as a transacting factor specific for Prox. Two X-linked genes, roX1 and roX2, encode non-coding RNAs (13Meller V.H. Wu K.H. Roman G. Kuroda M.I. Davis R.L. Cell. 1997; 88: 445-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 14Amrein H. Axel R. Cell. 1997; 88: 459-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that roX1 and roX2 RNAs exert their function through interaction with MLE and MSL proteins. Although earlier studies employing embryos lacking roX1, roX2, or both genes show that they are functionally redundant (14Amrein H. Axel R. Cell. 1997; 88: 459-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 33Franke A. Baker B.S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 117-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 34Meller V.H. Rattner B.P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1084-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), at least two lines of evidence support their independent functions. First, in the absence of MSL3 protein roX2 RNA, but not roX1, spreads to other sites on the X chromosome, a cytological indicator of normal dosage compensation (34Meller V.H. Rattner B.P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1084-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Second, in embryos roX1 RNA is transcribed in both sexes in the absence of MSL2, whereas transcription of roX2 RNA is preceded by MSL2 expression in males and activated by exogenous expression of MSL2 in females (35Meller V.H. Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the roX1 and roX2 genes are differentially regulated at the transcription level during development and that MSL proteins play active roles in transcription of the roX2 gene, but not the roX1 gene. At present, the molecular mechanisms underlying roX gene transcription remain unknown. It has been shown that mutant embryos, lacking MLE, normally synthesize roX1 RNA, but roX1 RNA appears to be concentrated at its site of synthesis (35Meller V.H. Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, it has been proposed that MLE is required for the stability of roX1 RNA and its movement from the transcription site, but not for its synthesis. MLE has also been implicated in stable maintenance of the steady-state level of roX2 RNA. Expression of mleGET in place of the wild type MLE results in drastic reduction in the roX2 RNA level and formation of the MSL complex devoid of roX2 RNA (25Gu W. Wei X. Pannuti A. Lucchesi J.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5202-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition to this post-transcriptional function, the present study suggests a direct involvement of MLE in transcription regulation of the roX2 gene. First, MLE interacts with the upstream promoter region (i.e. Prox2) of the roX2 gene through association with a 54-bp repeat, Prox. Second, overexpression of MLE activates transcription driven by Prox2 either in a reporter construct or a chromosomal context. Our study has shown that ATP is not essential for the interaction of MLE with Prox. In addition, MLE ATPase activity is dispensable for transcriptional activation supported by Prox2 (data not shown). These results are consistent with the findings that MLE retains X chromosome binding ability despite various mutations introduced in the ATPase motifs (26Lee C.G. Chang K.A. Kuroda M.I. Hurwitz J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 36Richter L. Bone J.R. Kuroda M.I. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and that ATPase activity is dispensable for transcriptional activation of the X-linked genes (37Chiang P.W. Kurnit D.M. Genetics. 2003; 165: 1167-1181PubMed Google Scholar). Because mutations in the ATPase motifs of MLE affect the viability of male flies, the ATPase activity seems to be required for normal development of male flies (36Richter L. Bone J.R. Kuroda M.I. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Then, by what mechanism does the ATPase activity of MLE influence dosage compensation? Based on poor binding of roX1 RNA to the X chromosome in flies expressing mleGET, Kuroda and coworkers (36Richter L. Bone J.R. Kuroda M.I. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) propose that MLE ATPase activity plays an early role, perhaps in packaging roX2 RNA into growing MSL complexes. In support of this hypothesis, a recent study shows that in the absence of an ATP-dependent function of MLE, MSL complex can be assembled but is devoid of roX RNA (25Gu W. Wei X. Pannuti A. Lucchesi J.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5202-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that in addition to transcriptional regulation by an ATP-independent function of MLE, roX2 RNA is post-transcriptionally regulated through association with MLS proteins, which require an ATP-dependent function of MLE.

Lucchesi for providing expression vector for MSL2 and antibodies to MSL1 and MSL2, Dr. Maxwell S. Scott for the FLAG-MSL1 construct, and Dr. Hubert Amrein for roX2 cDNA."
https://openalex.org/W1999974293,"Two related 18-amino acid, class A, amphipathic helical peptides termed 3F-2 and 3F14 were chosen for this study. Although they have identical amino acid compositions and many similar biophysical properties, 3F-2 is more potent than 3F14 as an apolipoprotein AI mimetic peptide. The two peptides exhibit similar gross conformational properties, forming structures of high helical content on a membrane surface. However, the thermal denaturation transition of 3F-2 is more cooperative, suggesting a higher degree of oligomerization on the membrane. Both 3F-2 and 3F14 promote the segregation of cholesterol in membranes containing phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol, but 3F-2 exhibits a greater selectivity for partitioning into cholesterol-depleted regions of the membrane. Magic angle spinning/NMR studies indicate that the aromatic residues of 3F-2 are stacked in the presence of lipid. The aromatic side chains of this peptide also penetrate more deeply into membranes of phosphatidylcholine with cholesterol compared with 3F14. Using the fluorescent probe, 1,3-dipyrenylpropane, we monitored the properties of the lipid hydrocarbon environment. 3F-2 had a greater effect in altering the properties of the hydrocarbon region of the membrane.

Preliminary studies also suggest that oral administration of D-4F to LDL receptor null and apo E null mice causes the rapid formation and clearance of small high density lipoprotein-like particles containing peptide, cholesterol, apo A-I and paraoxonase, an enzyme capable of converting pro-inflammatory high density lipoprotein into anti-inflammatory high density lipoprotein (4Navab M.

The peptide 4F has also been tested in vitro and shown to effectively inhibit lytic peptide-induced hemolysis, inhibit oxidized phospholipid-induced monocyte chemotaxis, scavenge lipid hydroperoxides from LDL (5Datta G.

To study the relationship of peptide structure to anti-atherosclerogenic potency, we studied the properties of four related 18-amino acid, class A amphipathic helical peptides (5Datta G. Epand R.F. Epand R.M. Chaddha M. Kirksey M.A. Garber D.W. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Hama S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Biol.

All of these peptides had identical amino acid compositions and very similar physical properties, yet two of these peptides, 3F-1 and 3F-2, were more potent in inhibiting lytic peptide-induced hemolysis, inhibiting oxidized phospholipid-induced monocyte chemotaxis, and scavenging lipid hydroperoxides from LDL compared with the analogs 3F3 and 3F14 (5Datta G.

In the present work we compare the interaction with phospholipid bilayers with and without cholesterol, of the most potent peptide of this series, 3F-2 (Ac-DKWKAVYDKFAEAFKEFL-NH2), and the least potent among these peptides, 3F14 (Ac-DWLKAFYDKVAEKFKEAF-NH2) (Fig. 1). We have previously shown that the potent analog 4F that has four, rather than three Phe, is capable of forming cholesterol-rich domains by preferentially interacting with regions of the membrane that are depleted of cholesterol (7Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Sayer B.G. Melacini G. Palgulachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5073-5083Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 3F-2 exhibits similar biological potency to 4F but has somewhat less activity in inhibiting oxidized phospholipid-induced monocyte chemotaxis, about the same activity in scavenging lipid hydroperoxides from LDL and greater activity in inhibiting lytic peptide-induced hemolysis (5Datta G. Epand R.F. Epand R.M. Chaddha M. Kirksey M.A. Garber D.W. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Hama S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Biol.

In contrast, although 3F14 is a class A amphipathic helical peptide with some anti-atherosclerogenic activity, it has a much weaker potency than either 3F-2 or 4F in the activities mentioned. This difference in potency is reflected in differences in the red edge effect in Trp emission from the peptide and in the quenching of 2-(3 (diphenylhexatrienyl)-propanoyl)-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (5Datta G.

In this study we further evaluate the interaction of 3F-2 and 3F14 with model membranes using NMR, DSC, CD, and fluorescence. Lipids—The lipids used in this study were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The purity of the phospholipids was verified by measuring the cooperativity and temperature of the phase transition using DSC. Peptide Synthesis—The peptides were synthesized by the solid phase method with a Protein Technologies PS-3 automatic peptide synthesizer using the procedures described previously (2Garber D.W. Datta G. Chaddha M. Palgunachari M.N. Hama S.Y. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J.

The peptides were purified using a preparative HPLC system (Beckman Gold), and the purity of the peptides was ascertained by mass spectral analysis and analytical HPLC. Concentrations of Peptide and Lipid—The concentrations of peptide solutions in buffer were determined spectrophotometrically using the absorbance at 280 nm and an extinction coefficient of 6970 cm-1m-1, calculated from the Tyr and Trp content. Phospholipid concentration was determined by phosphate analysis (9Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3000) Google Scholar). Preparation of Samples for DSC and NMR Experiments—Phospholipid and cholesterol were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v). For samples containing peptide, an aliquot of a solution of the peptide in methanol was added to the lipid solution in chloroform/methanol. The solvent was then evaporated under a stream of nitrogen with constant rotation of a test tube so as to deposit a uniform film of lipid over the bottom third of the tube. The last traces of solvent were removed by placing the tube under high vacuum for at least 2 h. The lipid film was then hydrated with 20 mm PIPES, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl with 0.002% NaN3, pH 7.40, and suspended by intermittent vortexing and heating to 50 °C for 2 min under argon. The samples used for NMR analysis were hydrated with the same buffer made in 2H2O adjusted to a pH meter reading of 7.0 (pD = 7.4). The samples used for NMR were incubated 24 h at 4 °C to allow conversion of anhydrous cholesterol crystals to the monohydrate form. For the NMR measurements, the samples were spun in an Eppendorf centrifuge at room temperature. The resulting hydrated pellet was transferred to a 12-μl capacity Kel-F spherical insert of an 18 × 4-mm ZrO2 rotor, attempting to pack the maximal amount of lipid into the rotor while maintaining it wet. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—Measurements were made immediately after sample preparation using a Nano Differential Scanning Calorimeter (Calorimetry Sciences Corporation, American Fork, UT). The scan rate was 2 °C/min, and there was a delay of 5 min between sequential scans in a series to allow for thermal equilibration. DSC curves were analyzed by using the fitting program, DA-2, provided by Microcal Inc. (Northampton, MA) and plotted with Origin, version 5.0. Centrifugation Assay for Membrane Binding of 3F Peptides—The fraction of peptide bound to the lipid after three heating and cooling cycles between 0 and 100 °C was determined by separating the free peptide by centrifugation. The vesicles with bound protein were pelleted at 200,000 × g for 90 min at 25 °C. A clear supernatant was separated from the solid pellet and assayed for protein by absorption at 278 nm. The absorption of a blank was subtracted, and a base line, set at 350 nm for each sample, was used to correct for residual scattering. In addition, the amount of lipid in both pellet and supernatant fractions was determined by phosphate analysis. Cholesterol concentration was determined by a modified version of the procedure of Zlatkis et al. (10Zlatkis A. Zak B. Boyle A.J. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1953; 41: 486-492PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after extraction with chloroform, the organic phase was dried under nitrogen and then placed under vacuum to completely remove the solvent. To the dried samples or to the dry cholesterol standards, glacial acetic acid was added, followed by a reagent composed of FeCl3 and 85% H3PO4 in sulfuric acid. The samples were placed in a boiling water bath for 3 min to develop a purple color. After cooling the absorbance was read at 550 nm. To test for the presence of lipoprotein particles in the supernatant, it was analyzed by nondenaturing PAGE using the method of Laemmli (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). An aliquot of the supernatant containing 3 μg of peptide was loaded on a 4–20% gel and run under native conditions for 20 h. The gel was then stained with colloidal blue and destained with water. Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were recorded on an AVIV model 215 spectropolarimeter using a quartz cell with a 0.1-cm path length. The cuvette was placed in a jacketed cell holder maintained at the desired temperature with circulating thermostatic fluid. The lipid was solubilized by incubation with the peptide followed by sonication to ensure minimal effects of light scattering. Temperature heating or cooling scans were performed at a rate of 2 °C/min, with a 30-s equilibration pause at each point for thermal equilibration. Ellipticity at 222 nm was measured as a function of temperature between 25 and 95 °C and then cooling back to 25 °C to assess the reversibility of denaturation. Large Unilamellar Vesicles (LUVs)—Lipid films were made by dissolving appropriate amounts of lipid in a mixture of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v) and dried in a test tube under nitrogen to deposit the lipid as a thin film on the wall of the tube. Final traces of solvent were removed in a vacuum chamber attached to a liquid nitrogen trap for 2–3 h. Dried films were kept under argon gas at -30 °C if not used immediately. The films were hydrated with buffer, vortexed extensively at room temperature, and then subjected to five cycles of freezing and thawing. The homogeneous lipid suspensions were then further processed by 10 passes through two stacked 0.1-μm polycarbonate filters (Nucleopore Filtration Products, Pleasanton, CA) in a barrel extruder (Lipex Biomembranes, Vancouver, Canada), at room temperature. LUVs were kept on ice and used within a few hours of preparation. Tryptophan Fluorescence—Fluorescence emission spectra of the peptides in the presence and absence of LUVs were measured at 25 °C using an SLM Aminco Series II luminescence spectrometer. The excitation wavelength was varied between 280 and 310 nm. The emission scans were recorded and then corrected for inner filter and instrumental effects. Excimer Formation in the Fluorescent Probe PC3P—The physical properties of the hydrophobic region of the membrane and the effects of the 3F peptides were monitored by measuring the fluorescent emission of PC3P (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). It has been shown that the ratio of the intensities of excimer and monomer emission is sensitive to the “fluidity” of the membrane interior (12Melnick R.L. Haspel H.C. Goldenberg M. Greenbaum L.M. Weinstein S. Biophys. J. 1981; 34: 499-515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). LUVs were prepared containing lipids and PC3P at a 100:1 molar ratio in Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, 0.14 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Florescence measurements were made in 1 × 1-cm-square quartz cuvettes containing 2 ml of Hepes buffer at room temperature. The excitation wavelength was 344 nm using slits with 4-nm band pass in both emission and excitation. Emission scans were made between 360 and 550 nm before and after the addition of peptide. The results are summarized as the ratio of the intensity of excimer emission at 476 nm to that of monomer emission at 389 nm (Ie/Im). The experiments were repeated twice with two independent preparations. The error in Ie/Im for duplicate measurements with the same preparations was between 1 and 2%, but between independently prepared samples the absolute value of the ratios varied between 5 and 10%; however, they always exhibited similar relative values with and without either of the two peptides. 1H NOESY MAS NMR—High resolution MAS spectra were acquired using a spinning rate of 4 kHz in a Bruker DRX 500 NMR spectrometer. Probe temperature was 24 ± 1 °C. The two-dimensional NOESY spectra were obtained using mixing times of 50 and 300 ms. The resonances were assigned based on their close similarity to literature values for phosphatidylcholine (13Forbes J. Bowers J. Shan X. Moran L. Oldfield E. Moscarello M.A. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Transactions. 1988; 84: 3821-3849Crossref Google Scholar), cholesterol (14Guo W. Hamilton J.A. Biophys.

Chem. 2002; 96: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). DSC—Lipid mixtures of SOPC containing 0, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 mol fractions cholesterol were analyzed by DSC in the presence of 0, 5, 10, and 15 mol % 3F-2 or 3F14. As examples, we present the results from mixtures containing 0 or 15 mol % of each of the peptides (Fig. 2). The DSC curves are presented as the excess heat capacity/mol cholesterol as in our earlier paper on 4F (7Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Sayer B.G. Melacini G. Palgulachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5073-5083Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Both peptides clearly promote the separation of cholesterol into crystalline domains at higher mol fractions of cholesterol and of peptide (Table I). The cholesterol crystals formed are in a metastable state and disappear after sequential heating and cooling scans between 0 and 100 °C (Fig. 2). This has been found previously, albeit to a lesser extent, with the peptide 4F (7Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Sayer B.G. Melacini G. Palgulachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5073-5083Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Scanning only up to 50 °C can eliminate much of this loss (16Epand R.M. Sayer B.G. Epand R.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14677-14689Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but the higher temperatures are required to observe the unfolding transition of the peptide. 3F14 causes separation of cholesterol crystals at lower mol fractions of cholesterol and peptide than is required with 3F-2. A more marked difference is observed in the peak at the lowest transition temperature that is ascribed to the gel to liquid crystalline transition of SOPC. The enthalpy of this transition can be reasonably estimated from cooling scans. For pure SOPC (data not shown), the transition occurs at 5.5 °C on cooling at 2 K/min with a transition enthalpy of 4 kcal/mol (16Epand R.M. Sayer B.G. Epand R.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14677-14689Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). With pure SOPC without cholesterol, the addition of 15 mol % 3F-2 lowers the enthalpy to 2.2 kcal/mol and to 2.4 kcal/mol with 3F14 (data not shown). With mixtures of cholesterol and SOPC the addition of increasing concentrations of 3F-2 eliminates this transition, whereas with 3F14 the enthalpy of this transition is slightly increased (Table II).Table IEnthalpy of the polymorphic transition of anhydrous cholesterol crystals The values are in cal/mol cholesterol determined from areas under the transitions at ∼36 °C on the first DSC heating scan.Cholesterol in SOPC3F-23F14510155101530%000008540%017055559516050%250225400200200225 Open table in a new tab Table IIEnthalpy of the chain melting transition of SOPC The values are in cal/mol SOPC determined from the average area under the transitions at ∼6 °C on the DSC cooling scans.Cholesterol in SOPC3F-23F14051015510150%4000NDaND, not determinedND2200NDND240030%50080034527851551553040%35000047057026550%210000300220200a ND, not determined Open table in a new tab The highest temperature transition observed in the DSC scans corresponds to that of the unfolding of the peptide. It occurs at about 65 °C for both peptides; with 3F14 the transition is readily observed only with SOPC in the absence of cholesterol (not shown), but the transition is quite prominent in scans with 3F-2 (Fig. 2). The transition temperature is slightly lower on cooling than on heating. CD—The CD spectra in buffer of both 3F-2 and 3F14 exhibit some dependence on peptide concentration (5Datta G. Epand R.F. Epand R.M. Chaddha M. Kirksey M.A. Garber D.W. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Hama S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26509-26517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The addition of SOPC or SOPC:cholesterol (1:1) to 3F-2 at 100 μm peptide results in little change in the secondary structure of 3F-2 (Fig. 3) but slightly increases the magnitude of the CD for 3F14 (Fig. 3). The temperature dependence of the spectrum shows a substantial loss of secondary structure on heating to 95 °C with both 3F-2 and with 3F14 (Fig. 4). The thermal transition is broad with some hysteresis on heating and cooling.Fig. 4Temperature dependence of the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm of 3F-2 (left) or 3F14 (right) in buffer and in the presence of lipid as indicated.

In the presence of peptide, lipid is partially solubilized (Fig. 5). A larger fraction of cholesterol is solubilized, compared with SOPC in samples containing 0.3 mol fraction cholesterol. It was confirmed by PAGE that lipoprotein particles were formed after either a mixture of SOPC and cholesterol at a molar ratio of 1:1 or 7:3 and also containing 15 mol % of 3F-2 or 3F14 was incubated at room temperature for 3 h and then centrifuged. Particles of ∼100 Å size were seen (Fig. 6), confirming that soluble lipoprotein particles were formed with both peptides. The fact that the major fraction of both lipid and peptide is in the insoluble fraction at the low concentrations used for DSC indicates that in the case of the much higher concentrations used for NMR, the major fraction of peptide and lipid are found in the pellet and not in solubilized micellar form. This is in agreement with our finding of a bilayer shaped static 31P NMR powder pattern for this lipid mixture (see below).Fig. 6PAGE of supernatant fractions after centrifugation of mixtures of cholesterol, SOPC, and peptide that had been incubated three h at room temperature. 3 μg were loaded on a 4–20% gel (PAGE) and run under native conditions for 20 h.

The emission maximum of 3F-2 in buffer is 336 nm compared with 338 nm for 3F14 in buffer. In the presence of lipid, either with or without cholesterol, the emission is close to 333 nm. The results indicate that the Trp residue inserts into the bilayer. These values are somewhat blue-shifted compared with our previous study, but in a different lipid system and at a somewhat higher peptide concentration. In addition, there may be some time-dependent changes accounting for part of the difference. There is an ∼2-fold increase in the emission intensity of 3F-2 in the presence of SOPC without cholesterol, which is smaller in the presence of 1:1 SOPC:cholesterol. This could be a result of 3F-2 inserting more deeply into bilayers not containing cholesterol, but there may also be contributions from scattering or small differences in peptide concentration (Fig. 7). Trp emission maximum is not sensitive to the presence of cholesterol, indicating that the polarity of the Trp environment is not greatly altered. This behavior is quite similar to that found with 4F (7Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Sayer B.G. Melacini G. Palgulachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5073-5083Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 3F14 has almost identical emission intensity in the presence of SOPC either with or without cholesterol (Fig. 7), suggesting that this peptide does not preferentially interact with cholesterol-depleted domains. The blue shift caused by the addition of the lipid is somewhat greater with 3F14 than with 3F-2, suggesting that the Trp of the former peptide is more deeply buried in the membrane. We have also determined the effect of cholesterol on the red edge excitation shift. In accord with our previous findings (5Datta G. Epand R.F. Epand R.M. Chaddha M. Kirksey M.A. Garber D.W. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Hama S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26509-26517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), there is no red edge excitation shift with 3F-2, but there is with 3F14, indicating that Trp residues are more rigid with 3F-2 in presence of cholesterol containing membranes compared with 3F14. It should be noted that 3F-2 has Trp at the center of the nonpolar face, whereas Leu appears at the center of the nonpolar face of in 3F14. This could be interpreted as a consequence of Trp tending to push the peptide up toward the lipid water interface, whereas Leu at the center of the nonpolar face increases interaction with the lipid acyl chain and hence results in a deeper penetration into phospholipid bilayer. Cholesterol has no effect on this phenomenon (Fig. 8). Excimer Formation in the Fluorescent Probe PC3P—The Ie/Im ratio of PC3P (1% of lipid) was determined in LUVs of POPC and POPC:cholesterol (1:1) with and without the addition of 3F-2 or 3F14 at a 10:1 lipid to peptide ratio (Fig. 9). In agreement with previous results (12Melnick R.L. Haspel H.C. Goldenberg M. Greenbaum L.M. Weinstein S. Biophys. J. 1981; 34: 499-515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), in the present work we also find that cholesterol markedly lowers the Ie/Im ratio. This is likely a consequence of the lower rate and extent of molecular motion in the presence of cholesterol decreasing the rate of conformational change in the fluorescent probe. The effect of the peptide is smaller and tends to increase with higher concentrations of probe, suggesting that there are both inter- and intra-molecular formation of excimers. This ratio is insensitive to the presence of 3F14 but is affected by 3F-2, indicating that 3F-2 has a greater effect on hydrocarbon packing and/or dynamics. 1H NOESY MAS NMR—Slices from the two-dimensional NOESY spectrum of 3F-2 in the presence of POPC, at a 1:10 peptide to lipid ratio, are presented for the spectral region of the aromatic side chain resonances using 50- or 300-ms mixing times (Fig. 10). The 31P NMR powder pattern demonstrated that the major fraction of the lipid was in a bilayer arrangement, although there was a significant isotropic component in the spectra of both peptides in the presence of POPC. There are cross-peaks between the aromatic resonance and the protons from the lipid, particularly those of the CH2 protons, indicating insertion of the peptide into pure POPC membranes. The sign of the nuclear Overhauser enhancement with 50-ms mixing time is negative, corresponding to rapid molecular motion, on this time scale, between the peptide and lipid. In addition, for several of the slices, peaks in the aromatic region, in add"
https://openalex.org/W2109551242,"We demonstrate the migration of antigen presenting cells (APCs), macrophages, and dendritic cells from the subcutaneous site to the peritoneum after they have picked up the antigen, using cell tracking dye. The migration of the APCs is more universal as it was also observed after injection of MethA tumor, DH-5alpha cells, and leishmania parasites, in addition to AK-5 tumor cells. Cellular migration is mediated by several chemokines and cytokines that also induce heavy influx of immune cells into the peritoneum. MIP-3beta secreted by the mesothelial cells is involved in the cellular influx into the peritoneum, whereas IL-12 and IFN-gamma produced by the APCs induced activation of immune cells in the peritoneum. Our results suggest an antigen presentation function for the APCs in the peritoneum as studied by lymphoproliferation assays. These studies indicate antigen presentation function of the activated migratory APCs from the distant subcutaneous site to the peritoneum, suggesting it acts as an important lymphoid organ involved in the enhancement of effector cell function."
