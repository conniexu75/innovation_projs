https://openalex.org/W2995703197,"The bone marrow constitutes the primary site for life-long blood production and skeletal regeneration. However, its cellular and spatial organization remains controversial. Here, we combine single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics to systematically map the molecular, cellular and spatial composition of distinct bone marrow niches. This allowed us to transcriptionally profile all major bone-marrow-resident cell types, determine their localization and clarify sources of pro-haematopoietic factors. Our data demonstrate that Cxcl12-abundant-reticular (CAR) cell subsets (Adipo-CAR and Osteo-CAR) differentially localize to sinusoidal and arteriolar surfaces, act locally as 'professional cytokine-secreting cells' and thereby establish peri-vascular micro-niches. Importantly, the three-dimensional bone-marrow organization can be accurately inferred from single-cell transcriptome data using the RNA-Magnet algorithm described here. Together, our study reveals the cellular and spatial organization of bone marrow niches and offers a systematic approach to dissect the complex organization of whole organs."

https://openalex.org/W2995393135,"Health literacy(HL) has recently been proposed as a potential mediator in the pathway through which socio-economic status(SES) affects health. However, empirical research investigating the contribution of HL in this relationship remains scarce. This study investigated whether functional HL mediates the association between SES and self-reported health(SRH) in an adult population-based sample.The study adopted a cross-sectional design. Education level and financial status were used as measures of SES, while functional HL was assessed with the Newest Vital Sign. Moderated mediation analyses were conducted using SES variables as independent variables, SRH as dependent variable and functional HL as mediator variable. Furthermore, age, sex and chronic diseases were tested as moderators of the effect mediated by functional HL.452 subjects completed the study (58,8% female; mean age 53,25±11,7). Results showed that functional HL mediates on average 18.5% of the association between education and SRH (p = 0.02) and 12.9% (p = 0.01) of the association between financial status and SRH. Furthermore, the proportion of effect mediated by functional HL was found to be higher in lower socio-economic classes for both SES variables considered. No significant moderation effects of age, sex or chronic diseases were observed for both SES variables.Findings suggest that functional HL may serve as a pathway by which SES affects health status, especially in lower SES groups. HL may be a valuable and actionable intermediate target for addressing health inequalities. However, further studies are needed to better define the mediating role of HL across socio-economic classes."

Analysis of a 96-plex perturbation experiment revealed changes in cell population structure and transcriptional states that cannot be discerned from bulk measurements, establishing an efficient method for surveying cell populations from large experiments or clinical samples with the depth and resolution of single-cell RNA sequencing. Single-cell RNA sequencing is readily multiplexed by labeling cells with ClickTags."
https://openalex.org/W2996255187,"Sex is a key modifier of neurological disease outcomes. Microglia are implicated in neurological diseases and modulated by microRNAs, but it is unknown whether microglial microRNAs have sex-specific influences on disease. We show in mice that microglial microRNA expression differs in males and females and that loss of microRNAs leads to sex-specific changes in the microglial transcriptome and tau pathology. These findings suggest that microglial microRNAs influence tau pathogenesis in a sex-specific manner. Kodama et al. show that microglia from male and female adult mice have distinct microRNA profiles and that loss of microglial microRNAs leads to sex-specific changes in the microglial transcriptome and tau pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2994758158,"Structural variation (SV), involving deletions, duplications, inversions and translocations of DNA segments, is a major source of genetic variability in somatic cells and can dysregulate cancer-related pathways. However, discovering somatic SVs in single cells has been challenging, with copy-number-neutral and complex variants typically escaping detection. Here we describe single-cell tri-channel processing (scTRIP), a computational framework that integrates read depth, template strand and haplotype phase to comprehensively discover SVs in individual cells. We surveyed SV landscapes of 565 single cells, including transformed epithelial cells and patient-derived leukemic samples, to discover abundant SV classes, including inversions, translocations and complex DNA rearrangements. Analysis of the leukemic samples revealed four times more somatic SVs than cytogenetic karyotyping, submicroscopic copy-number alterations, oncogenic copy-neutral rearrangements and a subclonal chromothripsis event. Advancing current methods, single-cell tri-channel processing can directly measure SV mutational processes in individual cells, such as breakage-fusion-bridge cycles, facilitating studies of clonal evolution, genetic mosaicism and SV formation mechanisms, which could improve disease classification for precision medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2996373122,"Widespread use of gene therapy technologies is limited in part by the lack of small genetic switches with wide dynamic ranges that control transgene expression without the requirement of additional protein components1–5. In this study, we engineered a class of type III hammerhead ribozymes to develop RNA switches that are highly efficient at cis-cleaving mammalian mRNAs and showed that they can be tightly regulated by a steric-blocking antisense oligonucleotide. Our variant ribozymes enabled in vivo regulation of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-delivered transgenes, allowing dose-dependent and up to 223-fold regulation of protein expression over at least 43 weeks. To test the potential of these reversible on-switches in gene therapy for anemia of chronic kidney disease6, we demonstrated regulated expression of physiological levels of erythropoietin with a well-tolerated dose of the inducer oligonucleotide. These small, modular and efficient RNA switches may improve the safety and efficacy of gene therapies and broaden their use. In vivo control of expression levels of AAV-delivered genes is enabled by an engineered RNA switch."

https://openalex.org/W2994658578,"Online product reviews underpin nearly all e-shopping activities. The high volume of data, as well as various online review quality, puts growing pressure on automated approaches for informative content prioritization. Despite a substantial body of literature on review helpfulness prediction, the rationale behind specific feature selection is largely under-studied. Also, the current works tend to concentrate on domain- and/or platform-dependent feature curation, lacking wider generalization. Moreover, the issue of result comparability and reproducibility occurs due to frequent data and source code unavailability. This study addresses the gaps through the most comprehensive feature identification, evaluation, and selection. To this end, the 30 most frequently used content-based features are first identified from 149 relevant research papers and grouped into five coherent categories. The features are then selected to perform helpfulness prediction on six domains of the largest publicly available Amazon 5-core dataset. Three scenarios for feature selection are considered: (i) individual features, (ii) features within each category, and (iii) all features. Empirical results demonstrate that semantics plays a dominant role in predicting informative reviews, followed by sentiment, and other features. Finally, feature combination patterns and selection guidelines across domains are summarized to enhance customer experience in today's prevalent e-commerce environment. The computational framework for helpfulness prediction used in the study have been released to facilitate result comparability and reproducibility."
https://openalex.org/W2995372527,"Investigating approach-avoidance behavior regarding affective stimuli is important in broadening the understanding of one of the most common psychiatric disorders, social anxiety disorder. Many studies in this field rely on approach-avoidance tasks, which mainly assess hand movements, or interpersonal distance measures, which return inconsistent results and lack ecological validity. Therefore, the present study introduces a virtual reality task, looking at avoidance parameters (movement time and speed, distance to social stimulus, gaze behavior) during whole-body movements. These complex movements represent the most ecologically valid form of approach and avoidance behavior. These are at the core of complex and natural social behavior. With this newly developed task, the present study examined whether high socially anxious individuals differ in avoidance behavior when bypassing another person, here virtual humans with neutral and angry facial expressions. Results showed that virtual bystanders displaying angry facial expressions were generally avoided by all participants. In addition, high socially anxious participants generally displayed enhanced avoidance behavior towards virtual people, but no specifically exaggerated avoidance behavior towards virtual people with a negative facial expression. The newly developed virtual reality task proved to be an ecological valid tool for research on complex approach-avoidance behavior in social situations. The first results revealed that whole body approach-avoidance behavior relative to passive bystanders is modulated by their emotional facial expressions and that social anxiety generally amplifies such avoidance."
https://openalex.org/W2998350284,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) affects blood pressure. In addition, ACE overexpression in myeloid cells increases their immune function. Using MS and chemical analysis, we identified marked changes of intermediate metabolites in ACE-overexpressing macrophages and neutrophils, with increased cellular ATP (1.7–3.0-fold) and Krebs cycle intermediates, including citrate, isocitrate, succinate, and malate (1.4–3.9-fold). Increased ATP is due to ACE C-domain catalytic activity; it is reversed by an ACE inhibitor but not by an angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonist. In contrast, macrophages from ACE knockout (null) mice averaged only 28% of the ATP levels found in WT mice. ACE overexpression does not change cell or mitochondrial size or number. However, expression levels of the electron transport chain proteins NDUFB8 (complex I), ATP5A, and ATP5β (complex V) are significantly increased in macrophages and neutrophils, and COX1 and COX2 (complex IV) are increased in macrophages overexpressing ACE. Macrophages overexpressing ACE have increased mitochondrial membrane potential (24% higher), ATP production rates (29% higher), and maximal respiratory rates (37% higher) compared with WT cells. Increased cellular ATP underpins increased myeloid cell superoxide production and phagocytosis associated with increased ACE expression. Myeloid cells overexpressing ACE indicate the existence of a novel pathway in which myeloid cell function can be enhanced, with a key feature being increased cellular ATP."
https://openalex.org/W2996405642,We have identified a molecular interaction between the reversibly oxidized form of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and 14-3-3ζ that regulates PTP1B activity. Destabilizing the transient interaction between 14-3-3ζ and PTP1B prevented PTP1B inactivation by reactive oxygen species and decreased epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation. Our data suggest that destabilizing the interaction between 14-3-3ζ and the reversibly oxidized and inactive form of PTP1B may establish a path to PTP1B activation in cells.
https://openalex.org/W2995588863,"This study investigated the correlations between firefighters’ occupational stress and cardiorespiratory fitness, arterial stiffness, heart rate variability, and sleep quality. We examined 705 male firefighters aged 40–50 years in Seoul City, Korea from November 2016–December 2017. The Occupational stress scale was used to evaluate occupational stress; an exercise stress test was administered to measure participants’ maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max); brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity was used to measure firefighters’ arterial stiffness; their autonomic nervous system activities were analyzed to determine heart rate variability (HRR); and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to assess their sleep quality. We divided the sample population into tertile groups per their occupational stress scores; i.e., low-stress group (n = 233), medium-stress group (n = 237), and high-stress group (n = 235). They were compared per each indicator and correlations were examined. There was a significant difference in VO2max (p < .01), and arterial stiffness (p < .001) according to occupational stress levels. Occupational stress was significantly correlated with cardiorespiratory fitness (r = -.820, p < .05), arterial stiffness (r = .085, p < .05), and sleep quality (r = .276, p < .001), but not HRR. In conclusion, Firefighters’ occupational stress is a key factor behind their elevated risk of cardiovascular diseases; therefore, we recommend programs aimed at reducing their occupational stress and preventing cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2996225385,"Soil salinity is a major abiotic stress factor that limits cotton production worldwide. To improve salt tolerance in cotton, an in-depth understanding of ionic balance is needed. In this study, a pot experiment using three levels of soil salinity (0%, 0.2%, and 0.4%, represented as CK, SL, and SH, respectively) and two cotton genotypes (salt-tolerant genotype: L24; salt-sensitive genotype: X45) was employed to investigate how sodium chloride (NaCl) stress effects cotton growth, ion distribution, and transport, as well as to explore the related mechanism. The results showed that SL treatment mainly inhibited shoot growth, while SH treatment caused more extensive impairment to roots and shoots. The growth inhibition ratio of NaCl stress on X45 was more marked than that of L24. Under NaCl stress, the Na concentration in the roots, stems and leaves significantly increased, whereas the K, Cu, B, and Mo concentration in roots, as well as Mg and S concentrations in the leaves, significantly decreased. Under salt stress conditions, salt-tolerant cotton plants can store Na in the leaves, and as a result, a larger amount of minerals (e.g., Cu, Mo, Si, P, and B) tend to transport to the leaves. By contrast, salt-sensitive varieties tend to accumulate certain minerals (e.g., Ca, P, Mg, S, Mn, Fe, Cu, B, Mo, and Si) in the roots. Most genes related to ion transport and homeostasis were upregulated in L24, but not in X45. The expression level of GhSOS1 in X45 was higher than L24, but GhNHX1 in L24 was higher than X45. Our findings suggest that the two varieties response to salt stress differently; for X45 (salt-sensitive), the response is predominantly governed by Na+ efflux, whereas for L24 (salt-tolerant), vacuolar sequestration of Na+ is the major mechanism. The expression changes of the genes encoding the ion transporters may partially explain the genotypic difference in leaf ion accumulation under salt stress conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2996454446,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by recurrent mutations that affect normal hematopoiesis. The analysis of human AMLs has mostly been performed using end-point materials, such as cell lines and patient derived AMLs that also carry additional contributing mutations. The molecular effects of a single oncogenic hit, such as expression of the AML associated oncoprotein AML1-ETO on hematopoietic development and transformation into a (pre-) leukemic state still needs further investigation. Here we describe the development and characterization of an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) system that allows in vitro differentiation towards different mature myeloid cell types such as monocytes and granulocytes. During in vitro differentiation we expressed the AML1-ETO fusion protein and examined the effects of the oncoprotein on differentiation and the underlying alterations in the gene program at 8 different time points. Our analysis revealed that AML1-ETO as a single oncogenic hit in a non-mutated background blocks granulocytic differentiation, deregulates the gene program via altering the acetylome of the differentiating granulocytic cells, and induces t(8;21) AML associated leukemic characteristics. Together, these results reveal that inducible oncogene expression during in vitro differentiation of iPS cells provides a valuable platform for analysis of aberrant regulation in disease."
https://openalex.org/W2997532199,"The genomes of most cellulolytic clostridia do not contain genes annotated as transaldolase. Therefore, for assimilating pentose sugars or for generating C5 precursors (such as ribose) during growth on other (non-C5) substrates, they must possess a pathway that connects pentose metabolism with the rest of metabolism. Here we provide evidence that for this connection cellulolytic clostridia rely on the sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphate (SBP) pathway, using pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase (PPi-PFK) instead of transaldolase. In this reversible pathway, PFK converts sedoheptulose 7-phosphate (S7P) to SBP, after which fructose-bisphosphate aldolase cleaves SBP into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and erythrose 4-phosphate. We show that PPi-PFKs of Clostridium thermosuccinogenes and Clostridium thermocellum indeed can convert S7P to SBP, and have similar affinities for S7P and the canonical substrate fructose 6-phosphate (F6P). By contrast, (ATP-dependent) PfkA of Escherichia coli, which does rely on transaldolase, had a very poor affinity for S7P. This indicates that the PPi-PFK of cellulolytic clostridia has evolved the use of S7P. We further show that C. thermosuccinogenes contains a significant SBP pool, an unusual metabolite that is elevated during growth on xylose, demonstrating its relevance for pentose assimilation. Last, we demonstrate that a second PFK of C. thermosuccinogenes that operates with ATP and GTP exhibits unusual kinetics toward F6P, as it appears to have an extremely high degree of cooperative binding, resulting in a virtual on/off switch for substrate concentrations near its K½ value. In summary, our results confirm the existence of an SBP pathway for pentose assimilation in cellulolytic clostridia.

https://openalex.org/W2995272832,"The cognitive-motor interference (CMI) produced by simultaneous performance of a cognitive and a motor task has been proposed as a marker of real-life impairment of people with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS), yet there is no consensus on the dual task (DT) procedure. This study aimed to compare DT performance of pwMS and healthy controls (HC) under different instructions and to examine its association with neuropsychological and clinical variables. PwMS (N = 23; relapsing-remitting course) and HC (N = 24) completed the cognitive (Verbal Fluency) and motor (walking) tasks under three conditions: independently or as single task (ST), both tasks simultaneously at best capacity or double prioritization (DT-DP), and only the cognitive task at best capacity while walking at preferred speed or cognitive prioritization (DT-CP). Compared to HC, pwMS walked significantly slower and produced less correct words under all conditions. The distance walked by pwMS and HC significantly differed between conditions (DT-CP< DT-DP< ST). PwMS produced more words during ST respective to DT-DP and DT-CP, with no difference between both DT conditions. HC showed no differences in cognitive performance between conditions. Motor and cognitive dual-task costs (DTC) were similar between groups. Only in pwMS, the cognitive DTC of DT-DP was different from zero. CMI measures correlated with neuropsychological, symptomatic, physiological (cognitive event-related potentials) and clinical variables. These results suggest that cognitive performance while walking is impaired in pwMS, but not in HC. CMI over cognitive performance might be a potential early marker of cognitive decline in pwMS, which may be enhanced by the instruction to prioritize both tasks in DT."
https://openalex.org/W2996113044,"Neutrophilia is a feature of sickle cell disease (SCD) that has been consistently correlated with clinical severity and has been shown to remain highly activated even at steady state. In addition to induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), hydroxyurea (HU) leads to reduction in neutrophil count and their adhesion properties, which contributes to the clinical efficacy of HU in SCD. Although HU reduces the frequency and severity of acute vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) and chest syndrome, HU therapy does not abolish these acute clinical events. In this study we investigated whether neutrophils in SCD patients whilst on HU therapy retained features of detrimental pro-inflammatory activity. Freshly isolated neutrophils from SCD patients on HU therapy at steady state and from ethnic-matched healthy controls were evaluated ex vivo for their degranulation response and production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Unstimulated SCD patient neutrophils already produced NETs within 30 minutes, compared to none for healthy neutrophils, and by 4 hours, these neutrophils produced significantly more NETs than the control neutrophils (P = 0.0079**). Higher numbers of neutrophils from SCD patients also showed higher degree of degranulation-related intracellular features compared to healthy neutrophils, including rough-textured cellular membranes (P = 0.03*), double-positivity for F-Actin and CD63 (P = 0.02*) and re-located CD63 within cytoplasm more efficiently than their healthy counterparts (P = 0.02*). The neutrophils from SCD donors released more myeloperoxidase (P = 0.02*) in the absence of any trigger. Our data showed that neutrophils from patients with SCD at steady state remained active during hydroxyurea treatment and are likely to be able to contribute to the SCD pro-inflammatory environment."
https://openalex.org/W2997827788,"Pain is a significant public health burden in the United States, and current treatment approaches rely heavily on opioids, which often have limited efficacy and can lead to addiction. In humans, functional loss of the voltage-gated sodium channel Na v 1.7 leads to pain insensitivity without deficits in the central nervous system. Accordingly, discovery of a selective Na v 1.7 antagonist should provide an analgesic without abuse liability and an improved side-effect profile. Huwentoxin-IV, a component of tarantula venom, potently blocks sodium channels and is an attractive scaffold for engineering a Na v 1.7-selective molecule. To define the functional impact of alterations in huwentoxin-IV sequence, we produced a library of 373 point mutants and tested them for Na v 1.7 and Na v 1.2 activity. We then combined favorable individual changes to produce combinatorial mutants that showed further improvements in Na v 1.7 potency (E1N, E4D, Y33W, Q34S–Na v 1.7 pIC 50 = 8.1 ± 0.08) and increased selectivity over other Na v isoforms (E1N, R26K, Q34S, G36I, Na v 1.7 pIC 50 = 7.2 ± 0.1, Na v 1.2 pIC 50 = 6.1 ± 0.18, Na v 1.3 pIC 50 = 6.4 ± 1.0), Na v 1.4 is inactive at 3 μ m , and Na v 1.5 is inactive at 10 μ m . We also substituted noncoded amino acids at select positions in huwentoxin-IV. Based on these results, we identify key determinants of huwentoxin's Na v 1.7 inhibition and propose a model for huwentoxin-IV's interaction with Na v 1.7. These findings uncover fundamental features of huwentoxin involved in Na v 1.7 blockade, provide a foundation for additional optimization of this molecule, and offer a basis for the development of a safe and effective analgesic."
https://openalex.org/W2994777531,"Objective Prostate lesions detected with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) are classified for their malignant potential according to the Prostate Imaging-Reporting And Data System (PI-RADS™2). In this study, we evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the mpMRI with and without gadolinium, with emphasis on the added diagnostic value of the dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE). Materials and methods The study was retrospective for 286 prostate lesions / 213 eligible patients, n = 116/170, and 49/59% malignant for the peripheral (Pz) and transitional zone (Tz), respectively. A stereotactic MRI-guided prostate biopsy served as the histological ground truth. All patients received a mpMRI with DCE. The influence of DCE in the prediction of malignancy was analyzed by blinded assessment of the imaging protocol without DCE and the DCE separately. Results Significant (CSPca) and insignificant (IPca) prostate cancers were evaluated separately to enhance the potential effects of the DCE in the detection of CSPca. The Receiver Operating Characteristics Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC), sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Spe) of PIRADS-without-DCE in the Pz was 0.70/0.47/0.86 for all cancers (IPca and CSPca merged) and 0.73/0.54/0.82 for CSPca. PIRADS-with-DCE for the same patients showed ROC-AUC/Se/Spe of 0.70/0.49/0.86 for all Pz cancers and 0.69/0.54/0.81 for CSPca in the Pz, respectively, p>0.05 chi-squared test. Similar results for the Tz, AUC/Se/Spe for PIRADS-without-DCE was 0.75/0.61/0.79 all cancers and 0.67/0.54/0.71 for CSPca, not influenced by DCE (0.66/0.47/0.81 for all Tz cancers and 0.61/0.39/0.75 for CSPca in Tz). The added Se and Spe of DCE for the detection of CSPca was 88/34% and 78/33% in the Pz and Tz, respectively. Conclusion DCE showed no significant added diagnostic value and lower specificity for the prediction of CSPca compared to the non-enhanced sequences. Our results support that gadolinium might be omitted without mitigating the diagnostic accuracy of the mpMRI for prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2995771717,"Stress is a major risk factor for depression and anxiety. One of the effects of stress is the (over-) activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the release of stress hormones such as glucocorticoids (GCs). Chronically increased stress hormone levels have been shown to have detrimental effects on neuronal networks by inhibiting neurotrophic processes particularly in the hippocampus proper. Centrally, GCs modulate metabolic as well as behavioural processes by activating two classes of corticoid receptors, high-affinity mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) and low-affinity glucocorticoid receptors (GR). Upon activation, GR can modulate gene transcription either as a monomeric protein, or as a dimer interacting directly with DNA. GR can also modulate cellular processes via non-genomic mechanisms, for example via a GPCR-protein interaction. We evaluated the behavioral phenotype in mice with a targeted mutation in the GR in a FVB/NJ background. In GRdim/dim mice, GR proteins form poor homodimers, while the GR monomer remains intact. We evaluated the effect of poor GR dimerization on hippocampus-dependent cognition as well as on exploration and emotional behavior under baseline and chronically increased stress hormone levels. We found that GRdim/dim mice did not behave differently from GRwt/wt littermates under baseline conditions. However, after chronic elevation of stress hormone levels, GRdim/dim mice displayed a significant impairment in hippocampus-dependent memory compared to GRwt/wt mice, which correlated with differential expression of hippocampal Bdnf/TrkB and Fkbp5."
https://openalex.org/W2994734109,"Smallholders throughout sub-Saharan Africa produce legume crops as sources of food, fodder, and cash income, as well as to improve soil fertility. Ethiopian farmers have developed diverse legume varieties that enable adaptation to changing agroecological and sociocultural conditions. However, over the past several decades, as farm sizes declined and extension services promoted new varieties developed by plant breeders, changes in legume diversity have not been monitored. Based on interviews with smallholder farmers (n = 1296), we investigated the status of inter- and intraspecific legume diversity in major production areas of Ethiopia for five food legumes: common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), field pea (Pisum sativum L.), faba bean (Vicia faba L.), groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.). Legume species richness increased with altitude, relative household wealth, and land area planted to legumes. The highest numbers of varieties were found for common bean, followed by field pea, faba bean, groundnut and fenugreek. The average number of varieties planted per household was low (ranging from 1 to 2) and often much lower than the number reported in the same community or zone, which ranged from 2 to 18. For three out of the five species, the number of varieties significantly increased with total land area planted to legumes. Most varieties were rare, planted by less than 1/3 of farmers; however, informants accurately named varieties planted by others in the same community, demonstrating awareness of legume diversity at the community level. Given that the ability to plant multiple legume varieties is limited by land size, policies need to strengthen community-level conservation based on the diverse interests and needs of individual households."

We focus on the role of extreme weather events in the distribution of toxic substances within and between residential communities in the largest cities in the United States (US). We explore the impact of projected inland and coastal flooding on the redistribution of toxicity from known contaminated sites, and how patterns of toxic flow change the total population and social demographics of the population at risk from toxic materials. We use the Urban Adaptation Assessment and data on toxic site locations from the US government to evaluate risk of toxin dispersion from flooding in cities and down to the census tract level for the period 2021–2061. We demonstrate that future climate conditions significantly increase the risk of the dispersion of toxins from contaminated sites by 2041."
https://openalex.org/W2994917639,"The main policy thrust in many sub-Saharan Africa countries' aim at addressing maternal mortality is the elimination of the user fee for maternal healthcare services. While several studies have documented the effect of the user fee removal policy on the use of maternal health care services, the experiences of women seeking care in facilities offering free obstetrics services, their level of satisfaction and reasons for satisfaction or dissatisfaction are poorly understood.This study adopted a mixed study design involving a population survey of 1227 women of reproductive age who gave birth in the last five years preceding the study (2011-2015), 68 in-depth interviews, and six focus group discussions. Simple descriptive statistics were performed on 407 women who benefitted from the user fee removal policy, while the qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis.The overall level of satisfaction with care received was remarkably high (97.1%), with birth outcomes being the central reason for their satisfaction. Participants were also satisfied with both the process aspect of care (which includes health workers' attitude and privacy) and the structural dimension of care (such as, the cleanliness of health care facilities and availability of and access to medicine). From the qualitative analysis, prolonged waiting-time, the limited scope of coverage, mistreatment, disrespect and abuse, inadequate infrastructure and bed space were the main reasons why a few women were dissatisfied with care under free maternal health care.The findings establish a high level of beneficiaries' satisfaction with care under free maternal health policy in Nigeria, raising the need for sustaining the policy in expanding access to maternal health services for the poor. Nevertheless, issues relating to prolonged waiting-time, the limited scope of coverage, mistreatment, disrespect and abuse, inadequate infrastructure and bed space require attention from policymakers."
https://openalex.org/W2995176016,"Grey matter volume (GMV) decline is a frequent finding in multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common chronic neurological disease in young adults. Increases of GMV were detected in language related brain regions following second language (L2) learning in healthy adults. Effects of L2 learning in people with MS (pwMS) have not been investigated so far.This study prospectively evaluated the potential of an eight-week L2 training on grey matter plasticity measured by 3T-MRI, L2 proficiency and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in people with relapsing-remitting MS (pwMS, n = 11) and healthy, sex- and age-matched controls (HCs; n = 12).Categorical voxel-based analysis revealed significantly less GMV bilaterally of the insula extending to the temporal pole in pwMS at baseline. Following L2 training, significant increases of GMV were evident in the right hippocampus, parahippocampus and putamen of pwMS and in the left insula of HCs. L2 training resulted in significant improvements of listening comprehension, speaking fluency and vocabulary knowledge in both pwMS and HCs. GMV increases of right hippocampus and parahippocampus significantly correlated with vocabulary knowledge gain and L2 learning was associated with a significant increase of HRQoL in pwMS.Our findings demonstrate distinct patterns of GMV increases of language related brain regions in pwMS and HCs and indicate disease-related compensatory cortical and subcortical plasticity to acquire L2 proficiency in pwMS."
https://openalex.org/W2996343784,"Background In recent decades, hypertension has become a popular public health problem in China. In 2017, a cross-sectional survey about hypertension and sodium intake measured by 24-hour (24-h) urine was launched in Zhejiang Province, to provide the basis of the Chinese population to develop a salt reduction intervention and prevention of hypertension strategy. Methods Cross-sectional data were obtained from 7512 participants aged 18 to 69 years in Zhejiang Province of China by complex, multistage sampling methods. The survey included face-to-face questionnaires and physical examination among all participants. Blood pressures and the use of anti-hypertension medications were used to determine hypertension. One thousand five hundred participants of them were asked to collect 24-h urine to measure sodium and potassium levels to assess intake. All rates and means were weighted by sampling weight and population structure of the province. Results The weighted means of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were 127.78 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI], 127.21–128.36) and 79.40 mm Hg (95%CI, 79.04–79.76). The weighted hypertension prevalence was 30.41% (95%CI, 28.91–31.91). Among those classified as having hypertension, 43.55% (95%CI, 40.77–46.34) were aware of the fact that they were suffering from hypertension, 32.05% (95%CI, 29.49–34.61) of them reported taking anti-hypertension medications, only 14.48% (95%CI, 12.54–16.42) had their blood pressure controlled. The weighted means of 24-h urinary sodium was 165.52 mmol (standard deviation [SD], 2.92), representing that the mean intake of sodium chloride was 9.68g (SD, 0.17) through conversion. Conclusion These cross-sectional survey results show that hypertension and excessive sodium intake in adults are prevalent in Zhejiang Province, China. Salt reduction and prevention of hypertension is still an urgent public health work."
https://openalex.org/W2997460069,"At present, there is a lack of systematic investigation into intra- and inter-task consistency effects in older adults, when investigating lateralised spatial attention. In young adults, spatial attention typically manifests itself in a processing advantage for the left side of space (pseudoneglect), whereas older adults have been reported to display no strongly lateralised bias, or a preference towards the right side. Building on our earlier study in young adults, we investigated older adults, aged between 60 to 86 years, on five commonly used spatial attention tasks (line bisection, landmark, grey and grating scales and lateralised visual detection). Results confirmed a stable test-retest reliability for each of the five spatial tasks across two testing days. However, contrary to our expectations of a consistent lack in bias or a rightward bias, two tasks elicited significant left spatial biases in our sample of older participants, in accordance with pseudoneglect (namely the line bisection and greyscales tasks), while the other three tasks (landmark, grating scales, and lateralised visual detection tasks) showed no significant biases to either side of space. This lack of inter-task correlations replicates recent findings in young adults. Comparing the two age groups revealed that only the landmark task was age sensitive, with a leftward bias in young adults and an eliminated bias in older adults. In view of these findings of no significant inter-task correlations, as well as the inconsistent directions of the observed spatial biases for the older adults across the five tested tasks, we argue that pseudoneglect is a multi-component phenomenon and highly task sensitive. Each task may engage slightly distinct neural mechanisms, likely to be impacted differently by age. This complicates generalisation and comparability of pseudoneglect effects across different tasks, age-groups and hence studies."
https://openalex.org/W2995475312,"The aim of this study was to construct the spleen differential genes library of broilers fed with probiotic Bacillus cereus PAS38 by suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) and screen the immune-related genes. Sixty seven-day-old broilers were randomly divided into two groups. The control group was fed with basal diet, and the treated group was fed with basal diet containing Bacillus cereus PAS38 1×106 CFU/g. Spleen tissues were taken and extracted its total RNA at 42 days old, then SSH was used to construct differential gene library and screen immune-related genes. A total of 119 differentially expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were isolated by SSH and 9 immune-related genes were screened out by Gene ontology analysis. Nine differentially expressed genes were identified by qRT-PCR. JCHAIN, FTH1, P2RX7, TLR7, IGF1R, SMAD7, and SLC7A6 were found to be significantly up-regulated in the treated group. Which was consistent with the results of SSH. These findings imply that probiotic Bacillus cereus PAS38-induced differentially expressed genes in spleen might play an important role in the improvement of immunity for broilers, which provided useful information for further understanding of the molecular mechanism of probiotics responsible to affect the poultry immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2995708081,"Wild edible mycorrhizal mushrooms are among the most appreciated and prized mushrooms in the world. Despite the cultivation of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) mushrooms has been a growing subject of study worldwide, it has been hampered by the mutualistic lifestyle of the fungi. Although not being obligate symbionts, most of the species of ECM mushrooms only produce fruit bodies in association with trees or shrubs. In the present study, we aimed at understanding certain aspects of the ecology of four different edible ECM fungi: Lactarius deliciosus, Tricholoma equestre, T. portentosum and Boletus fragrans. Despite having a broad distribution worldwide, these fungi inhabit also Mediterranean habitats with understories typically dominated by rockroses (Cistaceae). Studying the ecology of these mutualistic fungi as well as the interaction with these species of shrubs is not only scientifically relevant but also pivotal for the discovery of profitable cultivation protocols. We evaluated the compatibility of these ECM species with five species within Cistaceae family - Cistus ladanifer, C. psilosepalus, C. salviifolius, Halimium halimifolium and Tuberaria lignosa. Each species of fungi proved to be able to establish mycorrhizas with at least 2 different plants species but varied in their host range of the tested Cistaceae. The dissimilarity in terms of host specificity between some fungal species seemed to be connected with the phylogenetic distances of the fungi. A correlation between the colonization percentage of the root systems and the mycelial growth rates in pure culture was found. The connection of these traits might be an important key to understanding the ecological competitor-colonizer tradeoffs of these ECM fungal species. Altogether, our study reports unknown plant-fungi combinations with economical relevance and also adds new insights about the ecology of these species of ECM fungi."
https://openalex.org/W2996181164,"Obesity has increased worldwide. Although the visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio (VS ratio) is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease, its clinical impact on the long-term prognosis of patients with acute aortic dissection (AAD) remains unclear.This retrospective study included 111 patients with AAD admitted to our hospital from 2013 to 2016. Patients who died during hospitalization, and those diagnosed with Marfan's syndrome were excluded. Visceral and subcutaneous fat accumulation (VFA, SFA) at umbilical level were calculated on a dedicated workstation. Major Adverse Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Events (MACCE) and worsening renal function (WRF) at 3 years were evaluated.Patient characteristics were as below: age, 73 ± 13; male, 55%; Stanford type A, 53%. Average VFA, SFA, and VS ratio on admission were 98 (52-145) cm2, 141 (90-185) cm2, and 0.75 (0.47-0.97), respectively. VFA was higher in male than in female (male, 134 [84-179] cm2; female, 71 [46-99] cm2; p < 0.001), whereas SFA was similar (male, 141 [91-174] cm2: female, 134 [90-205] cm2; p = 0.687). VS ratio was also higher in male (male, 0.88 [0.75-1.17]; female, 0.49 [0.39-0.65]; p < 0.001). Both MACCE and WRF at 3 years were observed in 17 (15%) and 32 (29%) patients, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that VS ratio tended to be associated with the 3-year MACCE (HR for an increase of 0.5 unit, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.99-2.24; p = 0.056). This result persisted in male (HR for an increase of 0.5 unit, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.96-2.48; p = 0.073) but not female. The VS ratio was not related to the 3-year WRF.The VS ratio tends to be associated with the 3-year MACCE in patients with AAD. This finding is inconclusive owing to a small sample and low incidence of adverse events. Further studies with larger samples are needed to confirm the clinical significance of VS ratio."
https://openalex.org/W2996289765,"Persuasion research often focuses on how source characteristics affect attitude change in response to a message; however, message characteristics may also alter perceptions of the source. The Message-Based Impression Formation effect (M-BIF) suggests that perceivers use features of messages to infer characteristics of the source, and that such inferences may have a variety of consequential outcomes. In particular, the choice of narrative versus statistical evidence may have implications for the perceived warmth and competence of a source. In five experiments, narrative arguments led to greater perceptions of source warmth and statistical arguments led to greater perceptions of source competence. Across the two behavioral studies, a matching effect emerged: participants preferred to work on cooperative tasks with partners who had provided narratives, and competitive tasks with partners who had provided statistical evidence. These results suggest that the evidence type chosen for everyday communications may affect person perception and interpersonal interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2997825929,"Gap wind jets (Tehuano winds) trigger supersquirts of colder water and mesoscale asymmetric dipoles in the Gulf of Tehuantepec (GT). However, the effects of successive gap wind jets on dipoles and their effects inside eddies have not yet been studied. Based on the wind fields, geostrophic currents, and surface drifter dispersion, this research documented three dipoles triggered and modified by Tehuano winds. Once a dipole develops, successive gap wind jets strengthen the vortices, and the anticyclonic eddy migrates southwestward while the cyclonic eddy is maintained on the east side of the GT. During the wind relaxation stage, the cyclonic eddy may propagate westward, but due to the subsequent re-intensification of the Tehuano winds, the vortex could break down, as was suggested by surface drifter dispersion pattern and geostrophic field data. The effect of the Tehuano winds was evaluating via eddy-Ekman pumping. Under Tehuano wind conditions, Ekman downwelling (upwelling) inside the anticyclonic (cyclonic) eddies may reach ~ -2.0 (0.5) m d-1 and decrease as the wind weakens. In the absence of Tehuano winds, Ekman downwelling inside the anticyclonic eddy was ~ 0.1 (-0.1) m d-1. The asymmetry of downwelling and upwelling inside eddies during Tehuano wind events may be associated with Tehuano wind forcing."
https://openalex.org/W2996379166,"Cassava production in Africa is constrained by cassava mosaic disease (CMD) that is caused by the Cassava mosaic virus (CMV). The aim of this study was to evaluate the responses of a range of commonly cultivated West African cassava cultivars to varying inoculum doses of African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV). We grafted 10 cultivars of cassava plants with different inoculum doses of CMV (namely two, four, or six CMD-infected buds) when the experimental plants were 8, 10, or 12 weeks old, using non-inoculated plants as controls. Three cultivars showed disease symptoms when grafted with two buds, and four cultivars showed disease symptoms when grafted with four or six buds. Most cultivars became symptomatic six weeks after inoculation, but one ('TMS92/0326') was symptomatic two weeks after inoculation, and two ('Ntollo' and 'Excel') were symptomatic after four weeks. Root weight tended to be lower in the six-bud than in the two-bud dose, and disease severity varied with plant age at inoculation. These results indicate that the level of CMD resistance in cassava cultivars varies with inoculum dose and timing of infection. This will allow appropriate cultivars to be deployed in each production zone of Africa in accordance with the prevalence of CMD."
https://openalex.org/W2995114472,"Proteins are diverse with their sequences, structures and functions, it is important to study the relations between the sequences, structures and functions. In this paper, we conduct a study that surveying the relations between the protein sequences and their structures. In this study, we use the natural vector (NV) and the averaged property factor (APF) features to represent protein sequences into feature vectors, and use the multi-class MSE and the convex hull methods to separate proteins of different structural classes into different regions. We found that proteins from different structural classes are separable by hyper-planes and convex hulls in the natural vector feature space, where the feature vectors of different structural classes are separated into disjoint regions or convex hulls in the high dimensional feature spaces. The natural vector outperforms the averaged property factor method in identifying the structures, and the convex hull method outperforms the multi-class MSE in separating the feature points. These outcomes convince the strong connections between the protein sequences and their structures, and may imply that the amino acids composition and their sequence arrangements represented by the natural vectors have greater influences to the structures than the averaged physical property factors of the amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W2995736763,"Physical space, clonal fragmentation and nutrient availability can each affect the growth of clonal plants, but their interactive effect has been little studied. We grew un-fragmented (connected) and fragmented (disconnected) ramet pairs of the floating, clonal plant Salvinia natans in cylindrical containers with different diameters and heights (volumes) filled with solutions of two nutrient levels (high vs. low). To simulate competition environments that are commonly confronted by S. natans, we also added two ramets of another floating plants Spirodela polyrrhiza in each container. Biomass (total biomass, floating biomass and submerged biomass) and number of ramets of S. salvinia were higher in the containers with a larger diameter. Compared to the low nutrient level, the high nutrient level increased number of ramets, and altered submerged to floating mass ratio of S. salvinia. The impacts of physical space on floating mass and number of ramets were stronger under the high than under the low nutrient level. Clonal fragmentation positively affected biomass in the containers with a smaller volume (a smaller height and diameter), but had little impact in the containers with a larger volume (a larger height or diameter). Our results suggest that physical space can interact with nutrients and clonal fragmentation to affect the performance of S. salvinia under competition."
https://openalex.org/W2997474800,"The glutaminase C (GAC) isoform of mitochondrial glutaminase is overexpressed in many cancer cells and therefore represents a potential therapeutic target. Understanding the regulation of GAC activity has been guided by the development of spectroscopic approaches that measure glutaminase activity in real time. Previously, we engineered a GAC protein (GAC(F327W)) in which a tryptophan residue is substituted for phenylalanine in an activation loop to explore the role of this loop in enzyme activity. We showed that the fluorescence emission of Trp-327 is enhanced in response to activator binding, but quenched by inhibitors of the BPTES class that bind to the GAC tetramer and contact the activation loop, thereby constraining it in an inactive conformation. In the present work, we took advantage of a tryptophan substitution at position 471, proximal to the GAC catalytic site, to examine the conformational coupling between the activation loop and the substrate-binding cleft, separated by ∼16 Å. Comparison of glutamine binding in the presence or absence of the BPTES analog CB-839 revealed a reciprocal relationship between the constraints imposed on the activation loop position and the affinity of GAC for substrate. Binding of the inhibitor weakened the affinity of GAC for glutamine, whereas activating anions such as P i increased this affinity. These results indicate that the conformations of the activation loop and the substrate-binding cleft in GAC are allosterically coupled and that this coupling determines substrate affinity and enzymatic activity and explains the activities of CB-839, which is currently in clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2998225586,"Flight loss has evolved independently in numerous island bird lineages worldwide, and particularly in rails (Rallidae). The Aldabra white-throated rail (Dryolimnas [cuvieri] aldabranus) is the last surviving flightless bird in the western Indian Ocean, and the only living flightless subspecies within Dryolimnas cuvieri, which is otherwise volant across its extant range. Such a difference in flight capacity among populations of a single species is unusual, and could be due to rapid evolution of flight loss, or greater evolutionary divergence than can readily be detected by traditional taxonomic approaches. Here we used genetic and morphological analyses to investigate evolutionary trajectories of living and extinct Dryolimnas cuvieri subspecies. Our data places D. [c.] aldabranus among the most rapid documented avian flight loss cases (within an estimated maximum of 80,000–130,000 years). However, the unusual intraspecific variability in flight capacity within D. cuvieri is best explained by levels of genetic divergence, which exceed those documented between other volant taxa versus flightless close relatives, all of which have full species status. Our results also support consideration of Dryolimnas [cuvieri] aldabranus as sufficiently evolutionary distinct from D. c. cuvieri to warrant management as an evolutionary significant unit. Trait variability among closely related lineages should be considered when assessing conservation status, particularly for traits known to influence vulnerability to extinction (e.g. flightlessness)."
https://openalex.org/W2998469526,"Aim To explore the barriers and facilitators perceived by home caregivers regarding their involvement in the home care of people with pressure injuries. Background Although home caregivers are key in the process of caring for people with pressure injuries, little is known about their perceptions regarding their involvement in the same. Methods A qualitative study based on grounded theory involving a theoretical sample of 15 home caregivers of people with pressure injuries within the health district of Puertollano, Spain. Results This study identified three barriers (feminization of care, necessary life adaptations as a home caregiver, and the organization of health services) and three facilitators (the perceived family duty for caring, willingness to provide care, and satisfaction with the care received on behalf of primary care services) associated with caregiver involvement in the home care of pressure injuries. Conclusions The care of a person with pressure injuries is perceived as a duty and requires important adaptations affecting the home caregiver’s personal, social and work life. The emotional closeness and trust that develops between a patient and the primary care staff equals an involvement which, in turn, also has positive results for both the home caregiver and the patient."
https://openalex.org/W2994790483,"Among the initial responses to skin injury, triggering inflammatory mediators and modifying oxidative status provide the necessary temple for the subsequent output of a new functional barrier, fibroplasia and collagen deposition, modulated by NF-κB and TGF-β1 expressions. Hence, the current study aimed to investigate the effect of local application of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) on cutaneous wound healing induced in Swiss mice. Wound contraction progression was monitored by daily photographing the wounds. Enhanced fibroblast cell migration was observed after incubation with UDCA. Topical application of UDCA (500 μM) cream on excised wounds significantly enhanced wound contraction and improved morphometric scores. In addition, UDCA ameliorated the unbalanced oxidative status of granulated skin tissues. Interestingly, it showed increased expression of TGF-β1 and MMP-2 with decreased expression of NF-κB. On the other hand, UDCA significantly increased collagen fibers deposition and hydroxyproline content and enhanced re-epithelization. UDCA also modified the mitochondrial function throughout the healing process, marked by lower consumption rates of mitochondrial ATP, complex I contents as well as intracellular NAD+ contents accompanied by elevated levels of nicotinamide compared to the untreated controls. In chronic gamma-irradiated (6Gy) model, the illustrated data showed enhanced wound contraction via increased TGF-β1/MMP-2 and collagen deposition incurred by topical application of UDCA without effect on NF-κB level. In sum, the present findings suggest that UDCA may accelerate wound healing by regulating TGF-β1 and MMP-2 and fibroplasia/collagen deposition in either the two wound healing models."
https://openalex.org/W2994869956,"In this study, possible hybridization between two allopatric species, Cornus controversa and Cornus alternifolia, was explored using molecular and morphological approaches. Scanning electron microscope analyses of the adaxial and the abaxial leaf surfaces yielded a few new not yet described characters typical for the particular species and intermediate for hybrids. With the use of 14 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA and 5 Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism primer combinations, 44 fragments species specific to C. controversa and 51 species specific to C. alternifolia were obtained. Most of these bands were also found in putative hybrids. All clustering analyses based on binary data combined from both methods confirmed a separate and intermediate status of the hybrids. Hybrid index estimates for hybrids C1-C5 indicated that all were the first generation of offspring (F1). Chloroplast intergenic spacers (trnF-trnL and psbC-trnS) were used to infer the hybridization direction. Based on the assumption of maternal inheritance of chloroplast DNA, C. controversa seems to be the maternal parent of the hybrid. Internal transcribed spacer sequences of the five hybrids analyzed here indicated higher similarity with the sequences of C. controversa (all shared the majority of its single nucleotide polymorphisms). Sequence analysis of PI-like genes fully confirmed the hybrid origin of C1-C5 hybrids. Our results also showed that two specimens in the C. alternifolia group, A1 and A3, are not free of introgression. They are probably repeated backcrosses toward C. alternifolia. Furthermore, molecular data seem to point not only to unidirectional introgression toward C. controversa (the presence of hybrids) but to bidirectional introgression as well, since the presence of markers specific for C. controversa in the profiles of C. alternifolia specimen A3 was observed."
https://openalex.org/W2995076397,"Parallel to establishment of diagnostic surveillance protocols for detection of prostatic diseases, novel treatment strategies should be developed. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility and possible side effects of transrectal, MRI-targeted intraprostatic steam application in dogs as an established large animal translational model for prostatic diseases in humans. Twelve healthy experimental, intact, male beagle dogs without evidence of prostatic pathology were recruited. An initial MRI examination was performed, and MRI-targeted steam was applied intraprostatically immediately thereafter. Serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), clinical and ultrasonographic examinations were performed periodically following the procedure to assess treatment effect. Four weeks after treatment, all dogs underwent follow-up MRI examinations and three needle-core biopsies were obtained from each prostatic lobe. Descriptive statistics were performed. MRI-guided intraprostatic steam application was successfully performed in the study population. The first day after steam application, 7/12 dogs had minimal signs of discomfort (grade 1/24 evaluated with the short-form Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale) and no dogs showed any sign of discomfort by day 6. CRP elevations were detected in 9/12 dogs during the first week post steam application. Mild to moderate T2 hyperintense intraparenchymal lesions were identified during follow-up MRI in 11/12 dogs four weeks post procedure. Ten of these lesions enhanced mild to moderately after contrast administration. Coagulative necrosis or associated chronic inflammatory response was detected in 80.6% (58/72) of the samples obtained. MRI-targeted intraprostatic steam application is a feasible technique and displays minimal side effects in healthy dogs as translational model for human prostatic diseases. This opens the possibility of minimally invasive novel treatment strategies for intraprostatic lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2996849558,"During nightly foraging activity, echolocating bats drink by flying low over the water surface and dipping the lower jaw while avoiding further bodily contact with the water. This task poses different sensorimotor challenges than flying in the open to forage for insects. Of interest is how bats adjust the timing of their echolocation pulses to accommodate the surrounding scene, from the progressively nearer water surface itself to objects at longer distances. Drinking behavior has been described in only a few of the roughly 1,000 echolocating bat species, and in none of the 110 species in the Indian subcontinent. Here, we describe how bats emitting frequency-modulated (FM) echolocation pulses behaved while drinking from a swimming pool in urban northeast India. At least two different bat species were present, using 1st-harmonic frequencies sweeping down to about 35 Hz (""low frequency"") and down to about 50 kHz (""high frequency""), separable at a 40 kHz boundary. Over entire drinking maneuvers, intervals between broadcast pulses accommodate both the proximate task of registering the water surface while drinking and registering echoes from the farther reaches of the scene. During approach to the water, both low and high frequency bats emit longer, more stable interpulse intervals that matched the time interval covering echo arrival-times out to the frequency-dependent maximum operating range. High frequency bats use shorter interpulse intervals than low frequency bats, consistent with the shorter operating range at higher frequencies. Bats then accelerate their pulse rate to guide the dive down to drinking, with low frequency bats continuing to decrease pulse intervals and high frequency bats maintaining a more steady interval during the drinking buzz. The circumstance that both groups were engaged in the same task made this a natural experiment on the behavior during approach."

We compare priming effects for inflected and derived morphologically related prime-target pairs versus otherwise matched, purely orthographically related pairs. The results show morphological priming effects in both the L1 and L2 group, with no significant difference between inflection and derivation. However, L2 speakers, but not L1 speakers, also showed significant priming for orthographically related pairs. Our results support the claim that L2 speakers focus more on surface-level information such as orthography during visual word recognition. This can cause orthographic priming effects in morphologically related prime-target pairs, which may conceal L1-L2 differences in morphological processing."
https://openalex.org/W2997080129,"β1-chimaerin belongs to the chimaerin family of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and is encoded by the CHN2 gene, which also encodes the β2- and β3-chimaerin isoforms. All chimaerin isoforms have a C1 domain that binds diacylglycerol as well as tumor-promoting phorbol esters and a catalytic GAP domain that inactivates the small GTPase Rac. Nuclear Rac has emerged as a key regulator of various cell functions, including cell division, and has a pathological role by promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, how nuclear Rac is regulated has not been fully addressed. Here, using several approaches, including siRNA-mediated gene silencing, confocal microscopy, and subcellular fractionation, we identified a nuclear variant of β1-chimaerin, β1-Δ7p-chimaerin, that participates in the regulation of nuclear Rac1. We show that β1-Δ7p-chimaerin is a truncated variant generated by alternative splicing at a cryptic splice site in exon 7. We found that, unlike other chimaerin isoforms, β1-Δ7p-chimaerin lacks a functional C1 domain and is not regulated by diacylglycerol. We found that β1-Δ7p-chimaerin localizes to the nucleus via a nuclear localization signal in its N terminus. We also identified a key nuclear export signal in β1-chimaerin that is absent in β1-Δ7p-chimaerin, causing nuclear retention of this truncated variant. Functionally analyses revealed that β1-Δ7p-chimaerin inactivates nuclear Rac and negatively regulates the cell cycle. Our results provide important insights into the diversity of chimaerin Rac-GAP regulation and function and highlight a potential mechanism of nuclear Rac inactivation that may play significant roles in pathologies such as cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2995567186,"Animal groups often represent nonrandom subsets of individuals, and increasing evidence indicates that individuals may sort among groups based on their personalities. The size of a group can predict its personality composition in some species due to differential suitability of a personality for groups of certain sizes, and the group itself may function more effectively if particular personality types are present. We quantified cliff swallow (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) behavioral measures using linear and generalized linear mixed models to identify whether they: (1) varied among individuals within colonies and among colonies, (2) were related to reproductive success, and (3) predicted levels of parental care. Significant among-individual and among-colony site variation in a cliff swallow's latency to enter its nest when presented with a novel stimulus was revealed. We also found significant among-individual variation in the number of attacks directed toward a novel stimulus at the nest and in the response to broadcast of a cliff swallow alarm call recording, but among site variation in these measures was not significant. We did not find evidence for behavioral syndromes linking the personalities measured. Differences among individuals in latency to enter the nest and the number of attacks were not significantly related to reproductive success or to the extent to which birds fed their nestlings. However, extent of nestling feeding was significantly predicted by the number of mist net captures. The limited evidence in general of systematic variation in the behavior we measured among cliff swallow colonies may reflect the different and sometimes opposing selection pressures on behavior in different social environments. Future work should perhaps examine variation in other behavioral traits, such as foraging, in cliff swallow colonies of different sizes."

However, this association has not been specifically evaluated among incident dialysis patients.Among 1,380 Japanese patients who initiated dialysis, we quantified the association of pre-dialysis dipstick proteinuria (negative/trace, 1+, 2+, and ≥3+) with mortality using Cox models adjusting for potential confounders, such as age, gender, clinical history of hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.Mean age of study participants was 67.4 (SD 13.0) years, and 67.6% were men. The most common dipstick proteinuria category was ≥3+ (55.4%), followed by 2+ (31.2%), 1+ (9.9%), and negative or trace (3.5%). Patients with lower proteinuria level were older than those with higher proteinuria. Lower proteinuria was significantly associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality, even after accounting for potential confounders (p for trend <0.001). In those with negative/trace dipstick proteinuria compared to those with dipstick proteinuria ≥3+, the adjusted hazard ratio was 2.60 [95% CI: 1.62-4.17] in the fully adjusted model. Similar findings were observed when analyses were restricted to patients older than 70 years, and when cardiovascular mortality and non-cardiovascular mortality were analyzed separately.In incident dialysis patients, pre-dialysis proteinuria was inversely associated with mortality risk. Although future studies are needed to identify mechanisms, our findings suggest the need to carefully interpret proteinuria in patients with incident dialysis."
https://openalex.org/W2994727253,"Krabbe disease, also known as globoid cell leukodystrophy, is a rare genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by a deficiency of the galactocerebrosidase enzyme. To understand the association status of human beta-galactocerebrosidase (hGALC) in solution, we employed analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). Our AUC results show that hGALC has a tendency for reversible self-association. Self-association decreases as the concentration of sodium chloride increases from 50 to 500 mM. This indicates that ionic interactions are involved in the association. The association is also dependent on pH, and high order oligomerization decreases as the pH increases from 4.5 to 7.5. Taken together, our results indicate that hGALC has the highest tendency for oligomerization at physiological ionic strength and pH (lysosomal lumen). This is the first report describing the self-associating property of hGALC in solution."
