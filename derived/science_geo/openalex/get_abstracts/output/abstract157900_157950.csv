https://openalex.org/W2099630522,"Firing patterns of hippocampal complex-spike neurons were examined for the capacity to encode information important to the memory demands of a task even when the overt behavior and location of the animal are held constant. Neuronal activity was recorded as rats continuously alternated left and right turns from the central stem of a modified T maze. Two-thirds of the cells fired differentially as the rat traversed the common stem on left-turn and right-turn trials, even when potentially confounding variations in running speed, heading, and position on the stem were taken into account. Other cells fired differentially on the two trial types in combination with behavioral and spatial factors or appeared to fire similarly on both trial types. This pattern of results suggests that hippocampal representations encode some of the information necessary for representing specific memory episodes."

Here, we show that S opsin transcription is higher than that of M opsin, which supports ultraviolet (UV) sensitivity greater than midwavelength sensitivity. Surprisingly, most cones coexpress both S and M opsins in a common cone cell type throughout the retina. All cones express M opsin, but the levels are graded from dorsal to ventral. The levels of S opsin are relatively constant. However, in the far dorsal retina, S opsin is repressed stochastically, such that some cones express M opsin only. These observations indicate that two different mechanisms control M and S opsin expression. We suggest that a common cone type is patterned across the retinal surface to produce phenotypic cone subtypes."

https://openalex.org/W2074942478,"The response of a cortical cell to a repeated stimulus can be highly variable from one trial to the next. Much lower variability has been reported of retinal cells. We recorded visual responses simultaneously from three successive stages of the cat visual system: retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), thalamic (LGN) relay cells, and simple cells in layer 4 of primary visual cortex. Spike count variability was lower than that of a Poisson process at all three stages but increased at each stage. Absolute and relative refractory periods largely accounted for the reliability at all three stages. Our results show that cortical responses can be more reliable than previously thought. The differences in reliability in retina, LGN, and cortex can be explained by (1) decreasing firing rates and (2) decreasing absolute and relative refractory periods."
https://openalex.org/W2028130617,"We have identified and characterized two vesicle recycling pathways in frog motor nerve terminals. We exploited the differential staining properties of FM dyes of varying hydrophobicity to label selectively two different vesicle pools, using optical imaging and electron microscopy of photoconverted dyes. During a 1 min tetanus, a rapidly recycling route places vesicles selectively into a small readily releasable pool comprising about 20% of vesicles. After the tetanus, a much slower pathway (from which FM2-10 but not FM1-43 can be rinsed) delivers vesicles via infoldings and cisternae selectively to a reserve pool with a halftime of about 8 min. Mixing between the two pools is slow. During stimulation at 30 Hz, 10-15 s is required to mobilize and release dye from the reserve pool."
https://openalex.org/W2076474317,"We studied a novel function of the presenilins (PS1 and PS2) in governing capacitative calcium entry (CCE), a refilling mechanism for depleted intracellular calcium stores. Abrogation of functional PS1, by either knocking out PS1 or expressing inactive PS1, markedly potentiated CCE, suggesting a role for PS1 in the modulation of CCE. In contrast, familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD)–linked mutant PS1 or PS2 significantly attenuated CCE and store depletion–activated currents. While inhibition of CCE selectively increased the amyloidogenic amyloid β peptide (Aβ42), increased accumulation of the peptide had no effect on CCE. Thus, reduced CCE is most likely an early cellular event leading to increased Aβ42 generation associated with FAD mutant presenilins. Our data indicate that the CCE pathway is a novel therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2016979915,"Depolymerization of actin by latrunculin A transiently promotes neurotransmitter release. The mean rate of mEPSCs increases by a Ca2+-independent process, without a concomitant change in the mean amplitude. The readily releasable vesicle pool size and the rate of refilling of the readily releasable pool remain unaltered by latrunculin treatment. Evoked neurotransmitter release also increases in a manner consistent with an increase in vesicle release probability. The observed enhancement of neurotransmitter release is specific to actin depolymerization mediated by latrunculin A and is not caused by cytochalasin D. Our findings indicate that actin participates in a regulatory mechanism that restrains fusion of synaptic vesicles at the active zone."

Both proteins are released from the cytosol by unknown pathway(s). To better characterize the release pathway(s) for IL-1β and IL-18 we evaluated the role of lipopolysaccharide priming, of interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE) inhibition, of human purinergic receptor (P2X7) function, and of signaling pathways in human monocytes induced by ATP.

In this context, recent studies show that this release pathway can be rapidly induced by stimulation with exogenous ATP (15Ferrari D. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Dal Susino M. Melchiorri L. Baricordi O.R.

In macrophages, exogenous ATP works via the recently cloned P2X7 receptor, a member of the P2X family of nucleotide-gated channels that are activated by extracellular ATP (19Nuttle L.C. Dubyak G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13988-13996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has been suggested that monocytes do not express P2X7 receptors (20Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J.

Invest. 1995; 95: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). P2X7 is a 595-amino acid polypeptide with two membrane-spanning domains and intracellular N- and C-terminal domains (22Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar, 23Rassendren F. Buell G.N. Virginio C. Collo G. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5482-5486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). P2X7receptor is the only pore-forming P2X family member, and its activation results in the opening of a cationic channel with increased permeability to calcium and intracellular depolarization (20Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present work focuses on release mechanisms by taking advantage of the dramatic ability of ATP to telescope the processing and release down to a 15–30-min interval while enhancing the overall release signal (15Ferrari D. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Dal Susino M. Melchiorri L. Baricordi O.R. Di Virgilio F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1451-1458PubMed Google Scholar). In this report we examine the mechanism of ATP-induced release of IL-18 and compare it to IL-1β in human monocytes. We show that fresh monocytes express functional P2X7 receptors that modulate IL-1β and IL-18 processing and release in response to ATP. Of note, our data suggest that ATP stimulation alone is insufficient to trigger IL-18 processing and release, since priming with LPS was shown to be necessary. Additionally, the ATP effect on release does not require functional caspase-1, confirming for IL-18 what has been previously shown for IL-1β, i.e. precursor cleavage is not required for release. Finally, attempts to characterize the signaling pathway involved in the ATP effect show that a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG126, can potently block activation of caspase-1 and IL-1β/IL-18 release events, whereas mitogen-activated protein kinase, PKC and PKA inhibitors do not. ProIL-1β-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody (amino acids, 3–21) was developed in our laboratory. Human recombinant IL-1β, biotinylated IL-18, anti-human monoclonal IL-1β antibody (clone 8516), and IL-18 ELISA kit were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Mature IL-1β and precursor IL-1β-specific ELISA were from our own laboratory. Polyclonal anti-human P2X7antibody was from Alamone Laboratories (Jerusalem, Israel), and monoclonal antibody to P2X7 was a gift from Dr. Ian Chessell (University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK). Recombinant caspase-1 (ICE) and caspase-1 antibody were gifts from Dr. Nancy Thornberry and Dr. Doug Miller (Merck). Herbimycin A, caspase-1 inhibitor (Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethyl ketone (YVAD-cmk)), and tyrphostins and other protein kinase inhibitors were obtained from Calbiochem. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide, Escherichia coli strain 0127:B8, Westphal preparation, was from Difco. LNAME was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Phospho-ERK antibody was obtained from New England Biolab (Plymouth Meeting, PA), and total ERK antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). RPMI 1640 and phosphate-buffered saline were purchased from Biowhittaker Inc. (Walkersville, MD), and fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Human peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from the heparinized blood of normal donor using histopaque density gradient followed by a monocyte clumping method as described (24Marsh C.B. Pomerantz R.P. Parker J.M. Winnard A.V. Mazzaferri E.L.J. Moldovan N. Kelley T.W. Beck E. Wewers M.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6217-6225PubMed Google Scholar). This method yields about 65–75% pure monocytes. Isolated monocytes were cultured at 106/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in humidified incubator. Some cells were cultured for 3 h in the presence of LPS (1 ng/ml) and in the presence or absence of caspase-1 (ICE) inhibitor YVAD-cmk (100 μm). Where indicated, LPS-primed human monocytes were challenged with 5 mm ATP and incubated for an additional 30 min. Culture media was removed from the cells and centrifuged at 800 ×g for 5 min, and the supernatants and cell pellets were collected. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40) containing 2 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, chymostatin, pepstatin, antipain, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 μm N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val chloromethyl ketone. The cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min. For the analysis of phospho-ERK in cell lysates of monocytes, 1 mmNa3VO4 and 50 mm NaF were included in lysis buffer. The protein concentration in cell lysates was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Nonspecific sites on nitrocellulose membrane were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk (Carnation) in TBST (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH-7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 3 h at room temperature. For immunoblotting with phospho-ERK antibody, the membrane was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST. The membranes were then probed with primary antibodies as indicated followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Isolated monocytes were cultured in complete media alone or in complete media containing LPS (1 ng/ml) for 3 h or overnight in LPS (1 μg/ml). For flow cytometric analysis, cells were stained with monoclonal antibody to P2X7 essentially as described (25Buell G. Chessell I.P. Michel A.D. Collo G. Salazzo M. Herren S. Gretener D. Grahames C. Kaur R. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Humphrey P.P.A. Blood. 1998; 92: 3521-3528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were pelleted, washed twice with wash buffer (1% bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline), and incubated in wash buffer containing 4 μg/ml monoclonal P2X7 or an isotype (IgG2b) control antibody for 30 min at 4 °C followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled or rhodamine-labeled rat anti-mouse IgG-specific F(ab′)2 fragments (Jackson Immunoresearch laboratories, Westgrove, PA). Some cells were also stained for CD14. For the analysis of P2X7 receptor expression, monocytes were gated for CD14 fluorescence. Flow cytometric analysis was performed using Becton Dickinson FACS Calibur. Sandwich ELISAs were developed in our laboratory to detect pro- and mature IL-1β as described (13Wewers M.D. Dare H.A. Winnard A.V. Parker J.M. Miller D.K. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5964-5972PubMed Google Scholar). The coating antibody has been modified since the previous description. Briefly, anti-human mouse monoclonal IL-1β antibody (clone 8516, R&D Systems) was used as a coating antibody, and rabbit polyclonal proIL-1β-specific peptide antibody generated against amino acids 3–21 was used to sandwich the antigen. Horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was used as a developing antibody. The mature IL-1β ELISA used monoclonal antibody clone 8516 and a rabbit polyclonal mature IL-1β antibody (raised against entire 17-kDa mature IL-1β) as coating and sandwich antibodies, respectively. For the measurement of IL-18, ELISA kits were purchased from R&D Systems, and cell associated and released IL-18 contents were determined per manufacturer instructions. Data are presented as the means ± S.E. of the mean from at least three independent experiments. Simple comparisons were done by paired t test, withp < 0.05 considered to represent statistical significance. To establish the optimum timing for future analyses of IL-1β processing, we initially examined the kinetics of ATP-induced IL-1β release from LPS-primed human peripheral blood monocytes (Fig. 1). After 3 h of LPS (1 ng/ml), monocytes contained high levels of intracellular IL-1β with only minimal release. However, ATP (5 mm) induced a dramatic release of mature IL-1β, most pronounced between 15–20 min, that began to level off after 30 min of ATP. The accumulation of IL-1β in culture medium correlated with a decrease in cell-associated IL-1β. In all subsequent experiments, ATP treatment was standardized at 30 min. Having established the kinetics of the ATP effect on IL-1β, we next compared the related cytokine IL-18 to IL-1β for ATP-mediated release. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, the LPS priming induced a dramatic release of both IL-1β and IL-18 at 30 min after ATP treatment. However, there were significant differences in the ability of LPS to induce IL-1β compared with IL-18. Whereas unprimed monocytes contained very little IL-1β intracellularly (Fig. 2 C) (2.2 ± 1.5 ng/106 cells), low dose LPS induced a dramatic induction of intracellular proIL-1β (30.2 ± 12.1 ng/106 cells). In contrast, there was no difference between unprimed and LPS-primed monocytes for the presence of intracellular IL-18 (Fig. 2 D) (378 ± 22 versus 409 ± 5 pg/106cells, p = not significant). The constitutive presence of IL-18 in unprimed monocytes provided a unique opportunity to determine whether monocyte IL-18 processing and release induced by ATP requires a priming signal. Of particular note, despite the constitutive presence of intracellular IL-18 in the unprimed monocytes, ATP alone had no effect on inducing its release (Fig. 2 B) (control, 54 ± 19 versus ATP, 67 ± 28 pg/106 cells). However, after priming with LPS, ATP-induced IL-18 release increased 4-fold (215 ± 60 pg/106 cells; p < 0.05 compared with control). Our data thus demonstrate that ATP-stimulated release of IL-18 requires priming by LPS. Caspase-1, which is critical for processing IL-1β and IL-18, has been variably linked to the release pathway for these cytokines. It has been shown for example that caspase-1 −/− macrophages are impaired for IL-1β release (26Li P. Allen H. Banerjee S. Franklin S. Herzog L. Johnston C. McDowell J. Paskind M. Rodman L. Salfeld J. Towne E. Tracey D. Wardwell S. Wei F.-Y. Wong W. Kamen R. Seshadri T. Cell. 1995; 80: 401-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). To investigate the requirement for caspase-1 function in ATP-induced IL-1β and IL-18 release, we inhibited caspase-1 with the tetrapeptide, YVAD-cmk (100 μm). We analyzed IL-1β and IL-18 release with ELISAs able to detect both cytokines in the precursor form (13Wewers M.D. Dare H.A. Winnard A.V. Parker J.M. Miller D.K. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5964-5972PubMed Google Scholar). Human monocytes were cultured with YVAD and LPS in varying combinations (Fig.3). As we and others have previously shown (13Wewers M.D. Dare H.A. Winnard A.V. Parker J.M. Miller D.K. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5964-5972PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sanz J.M. Di Virgilio F. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4893-4898Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), the presence of an ICE inhibitor prevented mature IL-1β release from LPS-primed, ATP-stimulated, monocytes (data not shown). Importantly, however, a significant quantity of proIL-1β was detected in supernatants using a proIL-1β-specific ELISA (Fig. 3,A and C). As was shown for IL-1β, after LPS priming, ATP induced monocytes to release IL-18 (Fig. 3, B and D). Although ATP alone did not stimulate the release of IL-18 from cells treated with caspase-1 inhibitor, ICE inhibition did not prevent IL-18 release from LPS-primed, ATP-stimulated monocytes (Fig. 3, B andD). These data suggest that release of IL-1β and IL-18 does not require active ICE. Therefore, as has been shown for IL-1β, the processing of IL-18 is not required for its externalization. To confirm that the ATP treatment not only induces release but also promotes processing of IL-1β and IL-18, monocyte samples were also assayed by immunoblots (Figs. 4,A and B). We assessed the effects of ATP on the processing of IL-18 and IL-1β in untreated monocytes or in monocytes treated with YVAD or LPS alone or combined LPS and YVAD. Only the 24-kDa precursor form of IL-18 and the 31-kDa form of IL-1β were detectable in cell lysates. In cell supernatants of unstimulated or LPS-primed cells, no IL-1β was detected; however, low levels of the precursor form of IL-18 were detectable. In LPS-primed, ATP-stimulated monocyte supernatants, a large amount of 18-kDa IL-18 was detected. In the same supernatants, the 31-kDa form of proIL-1β was not observed, but a large amount of mature 17-kDa IL-1β was detected. In the presence of YVAD-cmk, only precursor forms of IL-18 and IL-1β were detected in supernatants of LPS-primed, ATP-treated monocytes (Fig. 4, A and B). There was no obvious difference in the amount of secreted IL-18 and IL-1β in the presence or absence of YVAD. These observations show that YVAD blocks maturation of proIL-1β and IL-18 but does not block the release. Thus, both IL-18 and IL-1β require functional caspase-1 for processing during export. It has been reported that prolonged ATP treatment (3 h) activates caspase-1 in LPS-primed human monocytes (28Laliberte R.E. Eggler J. Gabel C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36944-36951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the short exposure to ATP (30 min) in our experimental system also activates ICE in LPS-primed human monocytes. Therefore, we examined the effect of ATP and YVAD on activation of ICE by immunoblot analysis (Fig.5 A). Monocytes were cultured in the presence or absence of LPS and with or without YVAD for 3 h. ATP (5 mm) was then added where indicated, and cells were incubated for an additional 30 min. In control and LPS-primed cells, the 45-kDa precursor and intermediate forms of ICE were detected, but very little 20-kDa (active form of ICE) was seen. However, LPS-primed monocytes treated with ATP generated a significantly higher level of mature subunits (p20 and p10) of ICE, which was blocked by the presence of YVAD-cmk. Since, in the absence of LPS priming, ATP alone had no effect on IL-18 processing and release, it was important to determine whether ATP alone could activate ICE. As shown in Fig. 5 B, ATP without LPS activated ICE to the p20 form in both LPS-primed and unprimed monocytes. Thus, the data from ELISA and immunoblots, taken together with the evidence of ICE activation, show that ATP not only activates ICE but also the processing and release of IL-1β and IL-18. Although YVAD-cmk blocks the activation of ICE and the maturation of these precursor cytokines, it fails to inhibit the release of proIL-1β and proIL-18. Conversely, in the absence of LPS priming, ATP-induced ICE activation does not induce processing and release. Thus, although ATP induces ICE activation, it requires an additional signal to induce processing and release of IL-1β and IL-18. A number of reports to date suggest that ATP-induced release of IL-1β in LPS-primed monocytes occurs via P2X7 receptors (15Ferrari D. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Dal Susino M. Melchiorri L. Baricordi O.R.

Human monocytes cultured for 1–3 days in the presence of LPS or monocytes cultured overnight in the absence of any stimulus contain P2X7 receptors (25Buell G. Chessell I.P. Michel A.D. Collo G.

However, it is not yet clear if fresh human monocytes cultured for 3 h with or without LPS express P2X7 receptors. To address this question, we analyzed human monocytes cultured in the presence or absence of LPS for 3 h for the expression of P2X7 receptors by flow cytometry and immunoblot analysis. By flow cytometry, a significant signal for P2X7 receptor was observed in human monocytes when compared with the isotype control. Importantly, the reactivity with P2X7 antibody was only minimally enhanced in cells cultured in the presence of LPS for 3 h (Fig.6). Immunoblot analysis confirmed the results of flow cytometry. A 55-kDa band was detected in LPS-stimulated and unstimulated monocyte lysates that was competed away with the immunizing peptide (Fig. 7). These data confirm that fresh monocytes express P2X7 receptors that are only minimally increased by LPS.Figure 7Immunoblot of P2X7 receptor expression on human monocytes. Cells lysates from LPS-primed or unprimed monocytes were subjected to 10–20% gradient SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with polyclonal anti-P2X7 receptor antibody (Alamone Laboratories) as described.

Therefore, we attempted to determine if the P2X7 receptor antagonist, oxidized ATP, and a P2X7-specific antibody prevents the ATP-stimulated release of IL-1β in LPS-primed human monocytes. Pretreatment with 300 μm oxidized ATP for 30 min completely abolished the ATP-induced release of IL-1β in human monocytes (Fig. 8). Pretreatment with P2X7-specific monoclonal antibody also blocked the ATP-stimulated release of IL-1β but to a lesser extent (Fig. 8). The data suggest that the P2X7 receptor is responsible for the ATP effects. We hypothesized that protein kinases may play a significant role in the release of IL-18 and IL-1β from LPS-primed human monocytes. Initially, we compared the effects of various inhibitors of protein-tyrosine kinases, protein kinase C, and protein kinase A on release of IL-1β from LPS-primed human monocytes (TableI). Whereas platelet-derived growth factor (AG1296) and epidermal growth factor (AG1478) receptor kinase inhibitors and PKA or PKC pathway inhibitors had no effect, tyrphostin AG126, a PTK inhibitor, prevented ATP-induced release of IL-1β from LPS-primed monocytes (∼80% inhibition). The effect was dose-dependent and not cytotoxic to the cells in the concentrations used in the experiment. It therefore appears that ATP-stimulated IL-1β release is mediated by an AG126-sensitive tyrosine kinase(s).Table IEffect of protein kinase inhibitors on ATP mediated release of IL-1β from LPS-primed monocytesStimulator/InhibitorConcentration of inhibitors% Inhibition1-aCells were stimulated with 1 ng/ml LPS for 3 h, treated with inhibitors as indicated for 15 min, and then challenged with ATP for 30 min.

Open table in a new tab AG126 is a potent inhibitor of PTK and inhibits NO production and ERK activation while protecting mice from LPS-induced septic shock (30Spitzer J.A. Zhang P. Shock. 1996; 6: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 31Novogrodsky A. Vanichkin A. Patya M. Gazit A. Osherov N. Levitzki A. Science. 1994; 264: 1319-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether the AG126 effect on monocyte IL-1β and IL-18 release is due to the block in NO production or inhibition of ERK activation. Using ELISA detection, we first assessed the effects of PTK inhibitors herbimycin A and AG126, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors UO126 and PD98059, and nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor LNAME on ATP-induced release of IL-1β in LPS-primed monocytes (Fig.9 A). Again, AG126 inhibited IL-1β release in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the other PTK inhibitor herbimycin A and the MEK inhibitors UO126 and PD98059 did not inhibit ATP induced IL-1β release (Fig.9 A). To examine whether the AG126 effect was due to the inhibition of NO production, we analyzed ATP-induced IL-1β release in the presence of LNAME, a nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor. Interestingly, instead of the inhibition of release, LNAME enhanced IL-1β release by 2–3-fold. Of note, AG126 totally abolished the LNAME activated release of IL-1β (Fig. 9 A). We then evaluated whether AG126 inhibits ATP-induced ERK phosphorylation (Fig.9 B). Whereas the classic MEK inhibitors, UO126 and PD98059, prevented ERK phosphorylation, AG126 did not. In contrast, the MEK inhibitors did not prevent IL-1β and IL-18 release, but AG126 did. Therefore, the results indicate that the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is not essential for ATP-induced IL-1β release from LPS-primed monocytes. It is possible that the tyrosine kinase activity inhibited by AG126 regulates caspase-1 activation. We therefore asked if the inhibition of ATP-stimulated release of cytokines by AG126 is mediated by the inactivation of ICE. To accomplish this we examined the ATP-induced processing and release of IL-1β and IL-18 in the presence of kinase inhibitors. Western blot analysis of the cell supernatants for IL-1β (Fig.10 A) and IL-18 (Fig.10 B) confirmed the ELISA (Fig. 9) results. As it did for IL-1β, AG126 inhibited the processing and release of IL-18. The MEK inhibitors, herbimycin A and the nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor LNAME, did not affect ATP-induced processing and release of the cytokines. Finally, we examined the effect of AG126 on caspase-1 activation by Western blot analysis. Interestingly, AG126 also inhibited the ICE activation, as the 20-kDa active form of ICE was not detected; whereas, herbimycin A, MEK, and nitric-oxide synthase inhibitors had no effect on ATP-induced activation of ICE (Fig. 10 C). Thus the inhibition of IL-1β release by AG126 correlates with the inhibition of ATP-induced ICE activation, and the processing of ICE appears to be"

The hypoxia response elements (HREs) of these genes have in common one or more binding sites for hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). HIF-1 was originally reported by Semenza and Wang (2Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar) as a nuclear factor that was induced by hypoxia and bound to the HRE in the EPO gene. HIF-1 is a heterodimer composed of HIF-1α and HIF-1β (aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator, ARNT) subunits, both of which belong to the basic helix-loop-helix-per-arnt-sim family, and its activity is tightly regulated by cellular oxygen tension (12Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21513-21518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF is a hypoxia-inducible gene whose regulation and function have been studied extensively. VEGF plays a key role in physiological angiogenesis, as observed in tissue regeneration, and in pathophysiological angiogenesis, as observed in wound healing, tumor growth, metastasis, psoriasis, and diabetic retinopathy (13Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). VEGF expression is regulated by a variety of stimuli including hypoxia, cobaltous ion, nitric oxide (NO), growth factors, and cytokines (14Klagsbrun M. D'Amore P.A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Although hypoxia is regarded as the most potent regulator of this gene, NO has drawn a great deal of attention recently as a regulator of the VEGF gene. However, the role of NO in VEGF expression remains inconclusive. There are some observations that NO down-regulates the expression of VEGF in vascular smooth muscle cells and hepatoma cells (15Sogawa K. Numayama-Tsuruta K. Ema M. Abe M. Abe H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9038-9044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In contrast, our previous studies report that NO induces VEGF gene transcription in glioblastoma and hepatoma cells (18Chin K. Kurashima Y. Ogura T. Tajiri H. Yoshida S. Esumi H. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 19Kimura H. Weisz A. Kurashima Y. Hashimoto K. Ogura T. D'Acquisto F. Addeo R. Makuuchi M. Esumi H. Blood. 2000; 95: 189-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Dulak et al. (20Dulak J. Jozkowicz A. Dembinska-Kiec A. Guevara I. Zdzienicka A. Zmudzinska-Grochot D. Florek I. Wojtowicz A. Szuba A. Cooke J.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) demonstrated that endogenous NO enhances VEGF synthesis in rat vascular smooth muscle cells. Analysis of the VEGF promoter has uncovered that one HIF-1 binding site (HBS) in its 5′-flanking region functions as a cis-element regulating the hypoxic induction of VEGF. Liu et al. (3Liu Y. Cox S.R. Morita T. Kourembanas S. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) suggest that not only this HBS, but also an adjacent sequence located immediately downstream within the HRE, is essential for the hypoxic activation of this promoter. We demonstrated that both elements are indispensable to the transcriptional activation of the VEGF gene by NO and hypoxia (19Kimura H. Weisz A. Kurashima Y. Hashimoto K. Ogura T. D'Acquisto F. Addeo R. Makuuchi M. Esumi H. Blood. 2000; 95: 189-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no further structural or functional analyses of this downstream sequence have been performed. In this study, we demonstrate that this adjacent HIF-1 ancillary sequence (HAS) is a novel cis-element for VEGF gene induction by NO and hypoxia and that protein complexes constitutively bind to the HAS in several cell lines. In addition, we show that a common structure of the HRE, consisting of the HBS and the HAS, is widely seen among hypoxia-inducible genes including VEGF and EPO genes and some glycolytic enzyme genes. The sequence of pHRE contains the 5′-flanking sequence of the human VEGF gene between positions −1014 and −903 relative to the transcription start site. This segment, which contains the HRE, was prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification with primers 5′-CGTGGATCCAGCTGCCTCCCCCTTTG-3′ (sense strand) and 5′-GCCTCGAGGAGAACGGGAAGCTGTGTGG-3′ (antisense strand) and inserted between BamHI and XhoI of pT81luc0 (19Kimura H. Weisz A. Kurashima Y. Hashimoto K. Ogura T. D'Acquisto F. Addeo R. Makuuchi M. Esumi H. Blood. 2000; 95: 189-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reporter pT81luc0 contains the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter, upstream of the luciferase-coding sequence. A series of pHRE-related mutants were prepared by cloning polymerase chain reaction-amplified segments, which contained substituted, deleted, or inserted sequences within the HRE, into the same site of pT81luc0. A SV40-driven plasmid pSV-nlsLacZ, containing the β-galactosidase gene, was utilized for normalization of luciferase activity of the reporter plasmids (19Kimura H. Weisz A. Kurashima Y. Hashimoto K. Ogura T. D'Acquisto F. Addeo R. Makuuchi M. Esumi H. Blood. 2000; 95: 189-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A reporter plasmid pHREepo and its related mutants were prepared by cloning a segment of the 3′-flanking sequence of the human EPO gene (positions 3061 and 3116), including either the wild-type HRE or a mutated HBS (TACGTG→TACtgt) or a mutated HAS (ACACAG→AacaAG), into the same site of pT81luc0 as pHRE. Human glioblastoma A172, hepatoma Hep3B, cervical carcinoma Hela, and green monkey kidney COS-1 cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, at 37 °C in humidified incubators. Five μg of reporter plasmid and 1 μg of pSV-nlsLacZ were transfected into A172 cells in 10-cm dishes using 20 μl of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in serum-free Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). After incubation for 15 h, the medium was replaced with the regular culture medium. The cells were harvested 36 h after medium replacement and dissolved in 0.25 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. Prior to harvest, the cells were exposed either to normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2) or to 0.5 mm S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine (SNAP) (dissolved in 0.1% Me2SO) or 0.1% Me2SO for 12 h. Cell lysis was performed by four freeze-thaw cycles. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed as described before (19Kimura H. Weisz A. Kurashima Y. Hashimoto K. Ogura T. D'Acquisto F. Addeo R. Makuuchi M. Esumi H. Blood. 2000; 95: 189-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The relative luciferase activity was calculated as luciferase activity divided by β-galactosidase activity. Fold induction was expressed as ratios of relative luciferase activity of either SNAP/Me2SO or hypoxia/normoxia cells. Protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad protein assays (Bio-Rad). The sense strands of oligonucleotides used in EMSA are as follows: wt HBS, 5′-CAGTGCATACGTGGGCTCCA-3′; wt HBS + HAS, 5′- CAGTGCATACGTGGGCTCCAACAGGTCCTCTTCC-3′; wt HAS, 5′-GCTCCAACAGGTCCTCTTCC-3′; mutant HAS, 5′-GCTCCAAactcaCCTCTTCC-3′. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (21Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). In brief, A172, Hela, and COS-1 cell extracts were harvested either 3 h after Me2SO (0.1%) or SNAP (0.5 mm in 0.1% Me2SO) exposure or 8 h after normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (1% O2) exposure. Hep3B cell extracts were harvested either 8 h after Me2SO or SNAP exposure or 12 h after normoxic or hypoxic exposure. The collected cells were centrifuged at 270 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A (10mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1.5 mm MgCl2 10 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3 VO4, and 2 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, leupeptin, and antipain) and kept on ice for 10 min. The cell solution was then homogenized by pipetting more than five times with a syringe, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in ice-cold buffer C (0.42 m KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 20% glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 2 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, leupeptin, and antipain) and rotated slowly at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was stored at −70 °C for EMSA. Nuclear protein (5 μg) was incubated with 3 × 104cpm of 32P-labeled double-stranded probes and 0.1 μg of calf thymus DNA in modified buffer Z+ (25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 80 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.2 mmNa3VO4, and 3 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, leupeptin, and antipain) for 30 min at room temperature (22Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3217) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was performed on 5% nondenaturing acrylamide gels at 25 mA at 4 °C. The gels were dried, and the radioactivity was localized with a Bioimage Analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). In competition assays, excessive amounts of unlabeled competitors were added 5 min prior to addition of the labeled probe. With the aid of GenBankTM, we obtained the sequences of the HRE in hypoxia-inducible genes and compared these to the core sequences of the HBS and their ancillary sequences. The results are shown as the means ± S.E. The statistical significance was assumed at a value of p < 0.05 by the use of the unpaired Student'st test. The protein complexes containing a heterodimer of HIF-1α and HIF-1β were found to bind to the HBS in the VEGF promoter. The HBSs are located in the promoter or enhancer regions of several hypoxia-inducible genes, and the consensus sequence was described as either 5′-(G/C/T)ACGTGC(G/C)-3′ (3Liu Y. Cox S.R. Morita T. Kourembanas S. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) or 5′-RCGTG-3′ (23Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar). To determine the exact extent of the HBS in the human VEGF gene, a series of pHRE mutants with 1–3 nucleotide (nt) exchanges (pHREm1a–pHREm1k) were synthesized, and their reporter expression was compared with that of the wild type (pHRE) after NO and hypoxic treatments. The pHRE mutants pHREm1b, 1c, 1e, 1f, and 1g, which encompass the substitution of a 6-nt sequence, lost their response to both 0.5 mm SNAP and hypoxia (1% O2) (Fig.1, A and B). Therefore, the 6-nt sequence, TACGTG, contains the core of the HBS. In addition, a mutation at the last G (pHREm1i) of this sequence eliminated its response to both stimuli, whereas a mutation at T, the first nucleotide of TACGTG (pHREm1h), partially attenuated the activity of the luciferase reporter (Fig. 1 B). Thus, at least, the sequence ACGTG is required for the HBS to function. To clarify the importance of the initial T within the sequence, TACGTG, we substituted the T with an A, C, or G and tested the reporter activity of the resultant constructs. Fig. 1 C shows that the promoter responded better to NO and hypoxia if the first nucleotide was a T or G rather than an A or C (p < 0.05). A compilation of HBSs (24Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 609-616PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the HRE contains a sequence (T/G)ACGTG as a functional HBS in many hypoxia-inducible genes, whereas A or C in the first nucleotide of this sequence is found in only a few genes. This finding is consistent with our result that the sequence (A/C)ACGTG was less functional (Fig. 1 C). Together, our findings suggest that a 6-nt sequence, TACGTG, is the core motif of the HBS in the VEGF promoter. Previously, we demonstrated that not only the HBS, but also its downstream HAS, is essential for NO and hypoxic induction of the VEGF reporter gene (19Kimura H. Weisz A. Kurashima Y. Hashimoto K.

To identify the extent of the HAS, located downstream of the HBS, we tested the response of pHRE and its related mutants (pHREm2a–pHREm2k) to NO and hypoxia. Fig.2, A and B, illustrates the results of the mutation analysis of the HAS. Because pHREm2b, 2c, and 2d lost NO- and hypoxia-induced luciferase activity (Fig. 2 A), a 9-nt sequence, AACAGGTCC, was found to contain the core of the HAS. Further analysis of the sequence requirement (Fig.2 B) revealed that a 2-base pair mutation within ACAGGT (pHREm2g, 2h, and 2i) resulted in the loss of response, but a mutation at the first A (pHREm2k) did not abrogate luciferase activity. A mutation at TCC (pHREm2d), but not at CC (pHREm2j), within the sequence ACAGGTCC attenuated the reporter activity. Thus, any substitution within CAGGT eliminated the promoter response to either stimulus. This result suggests that these 5 nt constitute the HAS, and the strict sequence requirement might be indicative of the binding of some factor to the HAS. These experiments indicate that NO and hypoxia similarly enhance the VEGF promoter activity, and both the HBS and the HAS are required as cis-elements for the activation of VEGF by these stimuli. The sequences ACGTG, within the HBS, and CAGGT, the core sequence of the HAS, form an imperfect inverted repeat. This raises a question whether a secondary or tertiary structure formed by the above two elements is critical. Therefore we prepared mutants containing either an inverted (pHREm3a) or direct (pHREm3b) repeat of the HBS of the VEGF gene, whose spacer is identical to that of the wild type (Fig.3 A). A pHRE mutant, with a perfect inverted repeat of the HBS (pHREm3a), had a 2-fold greater activity than that of the wild type (pHRE) (p < 0.01). In contrast, a direct repeat of the HBS (pHREm3b) lost its responsiveness to both stimuli (p < 0.01). The same experiments were performed using mutants containing either an inverted (pHREm3c) or direct (pHREm3d) repeat of the HAS of the VEGF gene. Both mutants were found to be unresponsive to either stimulus. These results suggest that a secondary structure of the HRE may be critical for the promoter activity and that the HAS cannot compensate for the HBS. The HBS and the HAS are located adjacent to each other. To investigate whether these two elements function interdependently, we constructed pHRE mutants, with either a 2-nt deletion within (pHREm3e), or a 5-nt insertion (pHREm3f) into, the spacer and tested the reporter activity after NO and hypoxic treatments. As shown in Fig. 3 B, either mutation resulted in a loss of reporter activation, suggesting that the spacing between these motifs is crucial for the promoter activity. This result raises the possibility that some putative factor, what we call an HIF-1 ancillary factor (HAF), may bind to the HAS and interact with HIF-1 for VEGF gene induction. Hypoxia-induced HIF-1 activity mediates transcriptional activation of the VEGF gene. HIF-1 forms DNA-binding complexes containing the p300/ cAMP-response element-binding protein when bound to its target HBS under hypoxic conditions (25Arany Z. Huang L.E. Eckner R. Bhattacharya S. Jiang C. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12969-12973Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). However, no previous study has described binding factor(s) to the adjacent HAS. To identify proteins that bind to the HAS of the VEGF gene, we analyzed, in vitro, the binding of nuclear proteins to three kinds of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the HBS (wt HBS), the HAS (wt HAS), and both elements (wt HBS + HAS) in NO- or hypoxia-treated cells. Nuclear proteins were extracted from A172 cells cultured under 1% O2 for 8 h or 0.5 mm SNAP for 3 h or respective control cells. The extracts were incubated with labeled probes for 30 min at room temperature in the binding buffer Z+, and the mixtures were electrophoresed on nondenaturing acrylamide gels. As shown in Fig. 4 A, EMSA revealed that DNA-protein complexes (C1) were always present when either wt HBS or wt HBS + HAS was used as a probe. These bands were observed with probes reproducing the HBS of VEGF (3Liu Y. Cox S.R. Morita T. Kourembanas S. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 22Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3217) Google Scholar) and represent constitutive binding protein complexes. Doublet bands of less mobility (Fig. 4 A, H1 and H2) appeared only when nuclear extracts from the NO- or hypoxia-treated cells were used. These bands include an HIF-1 heterodimer, which was assessed by supershift assays using antiserum against either HIF-1α or HIF1β (ARNT) (19Kimura H. Weisz A. Kurashima Y. Hashimoto K. Ogura T. D'Acquisto F. Addeo R. Makuuchi M. Esumi H. Blood. 2000; 95: 189-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar patterns of H1 and H2 bands were observed when nuclear extracts from the NO- or hypoxia-treated cells were used with wt HBS and wt HBS + HAS probes. In competition assays, using wt HBS as a labeled probe, HIF-1 bands induced by SNAP (Fig. 4 B, H1 and H2) were displaced by excessive unlabeled wt HBS oligonucleotides but not by wt HAS. This result suggests that these bands are specific for the HBS, but the HAS is not a candidate for the binding site of HIF-1. The same result was obtained with hypoxia-treated extracts (data not shown). Fig. 4 A also reveals the presence of constitutive bands (C2) distinct from C1 when wt HBS + HAS or wt HAS was used as a probe. Another EMSA (Fig. 4 C) shows that mutated HAS did not form C2 protein bands, and these bands were displaced only by excessive unlabeled wt HAS oligonucleotides. These results demonstrate that protein complexes that represent C2 bands specifically bind to the HAS of the human VEGF gene. Furthermore, this C2 band was not supershifted by antibodies against HIF-1α, HIF-1β, or CBP/p300 (data not shown), suggesting that the C2 band is irrelevant to these transcriptional factors. Our mutational analysis of the VEGF promoter suggests a possible interaction of HIF-1 and the HAS-binding factor for the VEGF gene induction. To test if this HAS factor is present in cell lines where HIF-1 is activated under hypoxic conditions, we performed EMSA by using nuclear extract from A172, Hep3B, Hela, and COS-1 cells after normoxic or hypoxic exposure. Fig. 4, A and D shows that the HIF-1 band is induced only in NO or hypoxic nuclear extracts, whereas the HAS-binding complex is always visible and inhibited in part by hypoxia and NO in all analyzed cell lines. To analyze the influence of the HAS on HIF-1 binding activity to the HBS, we performed another EMSA by using wt HBS as a labeled probe and either wt HBS or wt HBS + HAS as competitors. As shown in Fig.5, excessive unlabeled wt HBS and wt HBS + HAS similarly displaced NO-induced HIF-1 bands (H1 and H2) and constitutive bands (C1), suggesting that the HAS does not significantly influence the binding affinity of HIF-1 to the HBS. This is also the case when using nuclear extracts from the hypoxia-treated cells (data not shown). Hypoxia induces a number of genes whose promoter or enhancer region contains one or more HBSs. They include aldolase A, enolase 1, glucose transporter 1, LDHA, phosphofructokinase L, inducible nitric-oxide synthase, phosphoglycerate kinase 1, heme oxygenase 1, EPO, transferrin, and VEGF genes. Most of them have (T/G)ACGTG as a consensus sequence for the HBS, although HBSs in glucose transporter 1 (GGCGTG) and enolase 1 (TGCGTG) do not meet this consensus sequence perfectly (24Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 609-616PubMed Google Scholar). We have determined the exact extents of the HBS and the HAS in VEGF and found that both elements form an imperfect inverted repeat. Moreover, the spacing of 8 nt in the VEGF gene is crucial. Surprisingly, analysis of the HREs of the above genes revealed that the HREs in 7 of 11 hypoxia-inducible genes form an imperfect inverted repeat and that the spacing is 8 nt in 6 genes and 9 nt in the rest (Fig.6). These data suggest that a novel common mechanism may exist, where a putative HAF has a pivotal role for induction of these genes. We have demonstrated that the HAS is essential for VEGF gene induction and that it is present in several hypoxia-inducible genes. To test whether NO up-regulates the promoter function of other hypoxia-inducible genes and whether the HAS functions as a cis-element in these genes, we prepared reporter plasmids containing a wild-type HRE (pHREepo), a mutated HBS (pHREepom1), and a mutated HAS (pHREepom2) of the EPO gene upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. These constructs were transfected into A172 cells, and the luciferase activity of the extracts was assayed. After treatments of either SNAP or hypoxia for 12 h, pHREepo was induced 10- and ∼40-fold, respectively, when compared with their respective controls. However, a mutation in either the HBS or the HAS almost completely abolished the response to either stimulus (Fig. 7), indicating that NO up-regulates EPO transcription and that the HAS functions as a cis-element in the EPO gene. Previously, we demonstrated that NO and hypoxia up-regulate transcription of the VEGF gene by enhancing HIF-1 binding activity (19Kimura H. Weisz A. Kurashima Y. Hashimoto K. Ogura T. D'Acquisto F. Addeo R. Makuuchi M. Esumi H. Blood. 2000; 95: 189-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the mechanisms of VEGF gene induction by these stimuli share common features and that HIF-1 has a central role in the transcriptional activation. Analysis of the VEGF promoter reveals that deletion of the HRE completely abolishes VEGF induction by NO and hypoxia. A further analysis of the HRE shows that not only the HBS, but also its downstream HAS, is essential for induction by these stimuli and that the AP-1 site is required for its optimal response (19Kimura H. Weisz A. Kurashima Y. Hashimoto K. Ogura T. D'Acquisto F. Addeo R. Makuuchi M. Esumi H. Blood. 2000; 95: 189-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar cooperativity among several domains within the HRE was also reported in the EPO and LDHA genes. In the case of the human EPO gene, the HBS, its adjacent sequence CACAG, and the binding site for hepatic nuclear factor 4 are crucial for the enhancer activity, and a mutation of either site abolished its hypoxic response (2Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar, 26Galson D.L. Tsuchiya T. Tendler D.S. Huang L.E. Ren Y. Ogura T. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2135-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The promoter analysis of the human LDHA gene revealed that a mutation in the HBS entirely abrogated the response to hypoxia, and mutation in either its upstream ACGT or its downstream cyclic AMP response element significantly, but not completely, reduced the promoter activity (11Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21021-21027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). These data indicate that multiple factors mediate transcriptional regulation of these genes through a complex interaction among these factors. An inverted repeat of half-sites spaced by some nucleotides is recognized as a common structure of the response elements for nuclear receptors. In principle, nuclear receptors dimerize in solution and bind to their response elements as dimers, although they can interact with and bind to the half-sites independently as monomers (27Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar). The dimerization often enhances the binding of receptors to their response elements by stabilization of the receptor-DNA complex rather than by an increase in the association rate (28Kuntz M.A. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27949-27956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In these cases, a spacing between the half-sites does not usually affect its function (28Kuntz M.A. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27949-27956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Kato S. Sasaki H. Suzawa M. Masushige S. Tora L. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5858-5867Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Our EMSA result revealed that HIF-1 can bind to its response element in the absence of the HAS. In addition, unlike nuclear receptors, positive cooperativity in HIF-1 binding between the HBS and the HAS was not observed. Our mutational analysis of the VEGF promoter revealed that the core sequences of the HBS and the HAS form an imperfect inverted repeat with a spacing of 8 nt. This observation suggested that HAF, a putative protein that binds to the HAS, might be identical or similar to HIF-1. Although mutations that increase stability of an inverted repeat enhance the reporter activity (Fig. 3 A), changes in spacing between half-sites abolished the activity (Fig.3 B). Thus, the geometry of these motifs might be more important than the secondary structure. A strict requirement of the HAS sequence and precise spacing between the two motifs indicate that a putative HAF might interact with the HIF-1 heterodimer as a novel transcriptional factor in NO- and hypoxia-induced VEGF expression. We demonstrated specific protein binding to the HAS of the VEGF gene in EMSA for the first time. These specific DNA-protein complexes are present in either normoxic or hypoxic nuclear extracts from A172, Hep3B, Hela, and COS-1 cells, but they are inhibited in part by hypoxia and NO (Fig. 4, A and D). It may be that part of the HAS-binding factors form protein complexes with HIF-1 under NO and hypoxic conditions, whereas the rest constitute attenuated C2 bands. The HAS-specific C2 complexes do not contain HIF-1 or CBP/p300, both of which are known to be essential for VEGF gene induction. These findings suggest that an unknown HAS-binding protein may function as a basic transcriptional factor in a wide range of tissues and organs, in contrast with tissue-specific regulation of hepatic nuclear factor 4 in the Epo gene (26Galson D.L. Tsuchiya T. Tendler D.S. Huang L.E. Ren Y. Ogura T. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2135-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although we have no information concerning the identity of the HAS-binding factor in the DNA-protein complex, its characterization is now in progress. The HAS-specific complex is more visible the lower the concentration of potassium in the binding reaction in A172 cells. 2H. Kimura, A. Weisz, T. Ogura, Y. Hitomi, Y. Kurashima, K. Hashimoto, F. D'Acquisto, M. Makuuchi, and H. Esumi, unpublished data. Even 250 times excess of unlabeled wt HAS could not displace this band completely (Fig.4 C). Therefore, it is possible that the HAS-specific complex may bind to its target DNA with relatively lower affinity, and the amount of these proteins may be abundant, as compared with competitors. A comparison of sequences of HREs (Fig. 6) shows that a similar structure, where the HBS and the HAS form an imperfect repeat, is seen among several hypoxia-inducible genes and that these motifs are spaced, most commonly, by 8 nt. Given that CACGT instead of CAGGT in the HAS of the VEGF gene functions as a cis-element for the promoter activity, all the HASs can be described as either CACG(T/C) or CACA(G/T) sequences (Fig. 6). In mutational analysis of the HAS of VEGF, pHREm3a, which contains an inverted repeat of the wild-type HBS (CAGGTC′CACGTA), had a 2-fold greater activity as compared with pHRE (Fig. 3 A), and a pHRE-related mutant containing the HAS of LDHA or heme oxygenase 1 (CAGGT′CACGT) had an identical response to pHREm3a. In contrast, an exchange of CAGGT (the HAS of VEGF) with CACAG(the HAS of EPO) in the VEGF promoter abrogated induction by NO and hypoxia.2 These results indicate that the effect on increasing inducibility of the reporter gene by hypoxia and NO is mediated by a gene-specific inverted HBS rather than by a consensus HAS sequence. The C2 complex, as seen in Fig. 4, could not be detected in EMSA by using probes that contained the HAS of LDHA and EPO.2 These findings suggest that HAS-binding factors of VEGF may be distinct from those of LDHA and EPO. All of these HASs share a common sequence, CAC, except for the VEGF gene. CAC in the sense or GTG in the antisense strand is a recognition site of ARNT, as seen in the HBS ((T/G)ACGTG). ARNT is known as the central dimerization partner for basic helix-loop-helix-per-arnt-sim family transcription factors including HIF-1α, endothelial per-arnt-simhomology domain protein 1, arylhydrocarbon receptor, and Sim (30Long W.P. Chen X. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12391-12400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is possible that ARNT dimerizes with a member of theper-arnt-sim homology family and binds to its target HAS. Taken together, these results suggest that a common mechanism, other than an HIF-1-mediated pathway, may exist for NO- and hypoxia-induced expression of the hypoxia-inducible genes. In summary, a detailed analysis of the VEGF gene promoter reveals that the sequences TACGTG and CAGGT are the cores of the HBS and the HAS, respectively, and that both sites are essential for the up-regulation of VEGF expression by NO and hypoxia. We also show that the constitutive protein complex binds to the HAS of VEGF. A similar structure of the HRE is seen among several hypoxia-inducible genes, indicating that a common mechanism may exist in which an HAF-mediated pathway positively regulates the transcription of these genes. We could not identify HAF in this study, but it may interact with, or rather collaborate with, HIF-1 for the promoter activation. VEGF plays a central role in tumor growth, progression, and metastasis by enhancing its angiogenesis and vascular permeability. If the HAF of VEGF is unique and distinct from that of other genes, inhibition of HAF function would be able to suppress VEGF induction without affecting expression of other hypoxia-inducible genes."

We discuss possible physiological implications of the junction for stalled replication in vivo. linking twist writhe kilobase(s) scanning force microscopy base pair(s) Unwinding of the parental strands by helicases during replication allows DNA polymerases access to their template for the synthesis of complementary strands. This unwinding behind the replication fork will cause an overwinding of the parental duplex in front of the fork. The paths of the DNA strands are best described in terms of the concept of linking number (Lk).1 Lk is a measure of the net number of crossings of the two strands of a topologically closed molecule of DNA. It is the sum of twist (Tw), or crossings in the double helix itself, and writhe (Wr), which results from one section of double helix crossing over another section of the same molecule (1Cozzarelli N.R. Boles T.C. White J.H. Cozzarelli N.R. Wang J.C. DNA Topology and Its Biological Effects. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 139-184Google Scholar). It can only be changed by breaking and resealing DNA strands. ΔLk is the difference between the Lk of a molecule and that of the same molecule in an unconstrained, relaxed state (Lk0). ΔLk can be either (+) or (−). During replication, ΔLk increases even though Lk remains the same, because separation of the parental strands lowers the value of Lk0. The ΔLk of replication increases by about one for every 10 base pairs of DNA that are replicated. The Tw of the DNA is converted to Wr when the strands are separated, which in turn must be removed to relax the DNA. Topoisomerases relieve this strain by catalyzing DNA passages, allowing the fork to move unhindered. In Escherichia coli, the most important such topoisomerase is DNA gyrase, which removes (+)-ΔLk by introducing (−)-ΔLK (2Marians K.J. Ikeda J.E. Schlagman S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1965-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 3Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The new winding of the parental and daughter strands introduced during replication do not contribute to DNA topology because the daughter strands are not topologically closed. Determination of the conformation of replication intermediates in response to a (+)-ΔLk is crucial to understanding DNA unlinking during replication. These conformations dictate the actual substrates for topoisomerases in replication. In a previous study of replication intermediates, we used partially replicated E. coli plasmids that had been stalled at a termination site, Ter (5Peter B.J. Ullsperger C. Hiasa H. Marians K.J. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 819-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These DNA molecules have a homogeneous structure, are relatively easy to prepare, and model a replicating chromosomal domain. When these intermediates are isolated from cells or are formed in an in vitro replication reaction containing DNA gyrase, they have a (−)-ΔLk due to the activity of gyrase, perhaps, after replication halted. The (−)-ΔLk equilibrates between two forms. One has (−) supercoils ahead of the replication fork. The other, called precatenanes, has (−) crossings between the replicated DNA arms (Fig.1 A). Precatenanes were originally postulated by Champoux and Been (6Champoux J.J. Been M.D. Alberts B. Mechanistic Studies of DNA Replication and Genetic Recombination: ICN-UCLA Symposia on Molecular and Cellular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., New York1980: 809-815Crossref Google Scholar) and were subsequently analyzed theoretically (7Ullsperger C.J.V. Vologodskii A.V. Cozzarelli N.R. Nucleic Acids Mol. Biol. 1995; 9: 115-142Crossref Google Scholar). Additional studies have also presented evidence that precatenanes are a potentially important structure during replication (8Hiasa H. Digate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2093-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

The conformation of partially replicated molecules with a (+)-ΔLk had not yet been examined, although this is thought to be the physiologically important form. We anticipated that partially replicated molecules with a (+)-ΔLk would look just like those with a (−)-ΔLk, except that the supercoils and precatenanes would have the opposite handedness (Fig. 1 B). To generate a (+)-ΔLk replication intermediate, we added intercalating agents to unwind the parental strands of the partially replicated molecules described above. To our surprise, they contained no supercoils or precatenanes. Instead, the (+)-topological stress is relieved exclusively by a retreat of the replication fork and reannealing of parental strands. Any (+)-supercoil and precatenane links are thereby converted into an increased Tw of the parental strands. The displaced nascent strands subsequently base pair to form a four-way junction at the replication fork, producing the structure shown in Fig. 1 C. We call this structure the “chickenfoot.” Such a structure had been proposed by several authors to explain findings of daughter-daughter duplex DNA as detected by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation in eukaryotes (12Wanka F.

Bidnenko V. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. Cell. 1998; 95: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 16Louarn J.M. Louarn J. Francois V. Patte J. J.

This four-way junction previously has been called a reversed replication fork (18Viguera E. Hernandez P. Krimer D.B. Lurz R. Schvartzman J.B.

We provide proof of the structure of this intermediate, and that it is promoted at a replication fork by a (+)-ΔLk. Our structural evidence combined with these in vivo studies suggests that the chickenfoot structure may be important when replication forks pause. This conclusion gains added significance from the recent realization that replication forks stall normally in aerobically growing cells (20Cox M. Goodman M. Kreuzer K. Sherratt D. Sandler S. Marians K. Nature. 2000; 404: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar), presumably from damage to the chromosomes. Plasmids pREP83 and pREP48 have been described previously (5Peter B.J.

The 5.8-kb, pBR322-based pREP48 was used to generate intermediates in vivo, and contains the unidirectional pUC origin of replication followed by one Ter site after 2.8 kb. pTus (5Peter B.J.

This protein blocks replication forks atTer sites. In vitro and in vivoreplication was as described previously (5Peter B.J. Ullsperger C. Hiasa H. Marians K.J. Cozzarelli N.R.

Plasmid DNA was extracted from cells using a variation of the neutral extraction method (22Horiuchi T. Hidaka M. Akiyama M. Nishitani H. Sekiguchi M. Mol. Gen.

One-dimensional 0.9% agarose gels were run in TAE buffer with or without 5 μg/ml chloroquine to compare the (−)-ΔLk partially replicated molecules to those with a (+)-ΔLk. For two-dimensional gels, DNA was first run in 0.9 or 1% agarose gels in TAE buffer at 79 V h/cm. The gels were soaked for 3 h in TAE plus 10 or 11 μg/ml chloroquine, turned 90°, and run in the second dimension in buffer containing chloroquine at an additional 113 V h/cm. The gels were then Southern blotted and probed with pBR322. DNA was relaxed with 20 units of wheat germ topoisomerase I (23Dynan W.S. Jendrisak J.J. Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5860-5865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) per 0.2–1 μg of partially replicated plasmid DNA in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 2.5 mmEDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7). DNA was nicked with DNase I in a final concentration of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, and 360 μg/ml ethidium bromide. In restriction endonuclease reactions, 20–50 ng of DNA was preincubated in 10 mm Tris-HCl with or without 5 μm ethidium bromide for 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions (New England Biolabs), containing 3 units of SapI or 15 units of PvuII in a total volume of 20 μl, were for 10 min at 37 °C. DNA bands were excised from a 1% agarose gel in TAE and extracted using the Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The DNA was precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in 50 mN NaOH and 1 mm EDTA, and run in a 1% agarose gel in 50 mN NaOH, 1 mm EDTA at 4 °C at 23 V h/cm. Partially replicated plasmid DNA (2.5–3 ng) in 5 μm ethidium bromide was incubated for 10 min at room temperature. It was then brought to 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, and 4 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and the DNA was deposited onto freshly cleaved mica (24Rivetti C. Guthold M. Bustamante C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). After 2–5 min, it was washed with 3–5 ml of EM grade distilled water. The samples were then briefly dried with nitrogen prior to imaging. All SFM images were obtained in air at room temperature with a Nanoscope III microscope (Digital Instruments Inc., Santa Barbara, CA) operating in the tapping mode. Commercial diving board silicon tips (Nanosensor, Digital Instruments) with a force constant of 40 nN/nm and a 250–300 kHz resonance frequency were used. An E type scanner (12 × 12 μm) was used for all imaging. Images were collected with a scan size between 1 and 4 μm at a scan rate of 1.9 Hz. Images were processed with a standard flatten filter using Nanoscope software. We showed previously that partially replicated plasmids with a (−)-ΔLk have both a (−)-supercoiled unreplicated region and a (−)-precatenated replicated region as diagrammed in Fig.1 A (5Peter B.J. Ullsperger C. Hiasa H. Marians K.J. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 819-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, the actual substrate for topoisomerases during replication is thought to have (+), not (−), ΔLk. We prepared a (+)-ΔLk intermediate by adding intercalating dyes such as chloroquine or ethidium bromide to (−)-ΔLk forms. These dyes increase ΔLk by unwinding the parental strands, increasing Wr. Our first experiments used electrophoretic mobility to study the structure of the replication intermediates. Because Wr, composed of supercoiling and precatenanes, compacts DNA molecules, DNA with a higher Wr runs faster on an agarose gel than DNA with a lower Wr . Our first experiments used pREP83 DNA replicated in vitro in the presence of Tus protein to halt synthesis at the Tersites (25Hill T.M. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2481-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The control reactions contained gyrase, which is known to introduce a (−)-ΔLk in the replication intermediates (lanes 1 and 3). The gyrase reaction gave the expected distribution of replication intermediate topoisomers, with different numbers of supercoils and precatenanes (see bands marked RI, lane 1). A second set of reactions contained topoisomerase (Topo) IV as the sole topoisomerase (lanes 2 and 4). Because this enzyme removes both (+)- and (−)-supercoils, we expected the replication intermediates to be relaxed. The Topo IV reaction, however, yielded a single band (labeled RI) that comigrated with nicked replication intermediates rather than the expected ladder of relaxed topoisomers (lane 2). In an attempt to resolve these topoisomers, we increased the ΔLk of these DNA molecules by running the reaction mixtures on a gel containing 5 μg/ml chloroquine (lanes 3 and 4). This amount of chloroquine reduced the (−)-ΔLk of the partially replicated molecules from the gyrase reaction and thereby their electrophoretic mobility (lane 3), but the intermediates from the Topo IV replication reaction (lane 4) remained unresolved and migrated at the same rate as in the absence of chloroquine (lane 2). The unexpected electrophoretic mobility of the intermediates is not due to nicking by Topo IV because unreplicated plasmid DNA in these reactions ran as the covalently closed relaxed topoisomers (bands marked RC in lane 4). We concluded that the (+)-ΔLk intermediates exist in some form other than supercoiled topoisomers or precatenanes. A definitive test of this conclusion employed two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis, in which the second dimension contained chloroquine (Fig. 3). Plasmid DNA, as opposed to partially replicated DNA, with a (−)-ΔLk forms an arc on the two-dimensional gel, as diagrammed in Fig. 3 A. In the first dimension, run in the absence of chloroquine, topoisomers with a more negative ΔLk migrate faster. Chloroquine, in the second dimension, introduces a (+)-ΔLk. Topoisomers that still have a (−)-ΔLk (labeled “(−)” in Fig. 3 A) form the lower portion of the arc. Topoisomers relaxed in chloroquine migrate at the center of the arc (Rel). Topoisomers with less (−)-ΔLk than the relaxed topoisomers become (+)-supercoiled by chloroquine (labeled “(+)” in Fig. 3 A) and form the upper part of the arc. The two-dimensional gel of pREP83 partially replicated in vitro with DNA gyrase (Fig. 3 B) has a strikingly different pattern. Fourteen topoisomers are resolved and have a (−)-ΔLk in the first dimension. The chloroquine in the second dimension is sufficient to relax the sixth slowest topoisomer. The (−)-ΔLk arc is clearly present, but a straight line with the mobility of the relaxed topoisomer replaces the (+)-ΔLk arc. We obtained the same results with a partially replicated plasmid generated in vivo. pREP48 replicated from the unidirectional pUC origin of replication toward a single Ter site was run on a two-dimensional gel (Fig. 3 C). These molecules have a (−)-ΔLk to begin. Once again, the (−)-ΔLk arc is present, but the (+)-ΔLk topoisomers migrate with the same mobility as relaxed partially replicated DNA. We conclude that partially replicated molecules produced both in vitro from a bidirectional origin and in vivo from a unidirectional origin do not have (+)-Wr even though they have a (+)-ΔLk. Since Wr = 0, partially replicated molecules with a (+)-ΔLk must have a (+)-ΔTw. The most likely cause of the (+)-ΔTw is that the molecules compensate for the (+)-ΔLk by rewinding the parental strands. This necessarily requires a concomitant unwinding of the most recently replicated DNA. The energy of base pairing would be conserved, however, if the displaced nascent strands of the unwound replicated DNA anneal to each other to generate a four-way junction at the fork (Fig. 1 C). We named this four-way junction the chickenfoot, because of an obvious resemblance to the fowl appendage. If the chickenfoot model is correct, increase in ΔLk from intercalating dyes will cause a linear duplex, resulting from the nascent-nascent pairing, to extrude from the replication fork. Cleavage with a restriction enzyme of a site in the replicated region provides a strong test of this model, as diagrammed in Fig. 4 A. Because the site is in the replicated region, two double-strand cuts will be made. If no chickenfoot forms, these cleavages will result in a single product: a molecule with two forks of different sizes (Fig. 4 A, left side). The pair of cleavages of a molecule with a chickenfoot will result in two products: a short linear duplex, the amputated middle toe of the chickenfoot, and, after branch migration, a molecule with a single fork (Fig. 4 A, right side). Because the second cleavage in the parental-parental duplex removes the topological constraint in these molecules, the chickenfoot is no longer the lowest energy form of the molecule. Branch migration of the forks occurs readily in the absence of magnesium (26Panyutin I.G. Hsieh P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2021-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and this will cause absorption of the middle toe. Once this three-way junction is formed it will be a branch migration “sink,” and reformation of the four-way junction will be unfavorable. A possible path is shown in Fig.4 A. The double-forked structure should migrate more slowly on an agarose gel than the single-forked structure. Two restriction enzymes were used: PvuII, which cuts 366 base pairs (bp) from the Ter site in the replicated region, and SapI, which cleaves 184 bp from the pUC19 origin of replication in the replicated region. In this way, we studied the structure at the terminus and origin independently. From the unwinding angle of ethidium bromide (27Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 89: 783-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and an average ΔLk for pREP48 replication intermediates of −17 (Form I) (5Peter B.J. Ullsperger C. Hiasa H. Marians K.J. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 819-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), we expect the average length of the extruded toe to be about 470 bp/molecule, which could potentially come from a single middle toe or two per molecule. We also relaxed the partially replicated molecules with wheat germ Topo I before adding dye (Form IV), which should increase the toe length per molecule to about 700 bp. After cleavage with either restriction enzyme, two closely spaced low-mobility bands were detected (Fig. 4 B). The bottom of these two bands predominated in the presence of ethidium bromide, while the top band predominated in its absence. It seemed likely that the bottom band is the single-forked structure predicted by the chickenfoot model, and that the top is the double-forked structure derived from the usual three-way replication fork. Two experiments proved these assignations. First, we extracted these two bands from PvuII-treated, relaxed replication intermediates and analyzed them on an alkaline denaturing agarose gel (Fig. 4 C). The bottom band (B) yielded only the two single-stranded products expected from the single-forked structure generated from the chickenfoot-containing molecule, corresponding to the 2.4-kb daughter strand from the long arm and the 5.8-kb parental strand. As predicted if the top band (T) is the double forked structure (see Fig. 4 A), three fragments were detected corresponding to the 366 base daughter strand of the short arm, the 2.4-kb daughter strand of the long arm and the 5.8-kb parental strand. Second, the small fragment released from the middle toe of the chickenfoot by restriction digestion was visible on a 2% agarose gel run for 24 h (data not shown). Its intensity correlated with the amount of the bottom band; i.e. it predominated when ethidium bromide was present. As expected, this high-mobility fragment comigrated with a 200-bp marker when the partially replicated DNA was cleaved with SapI and with a 370-bp marker when cleaved withPvuII. Because the same amount, about 50%, of each partially replicated DNA was cleaved to form the bottom band indicative of the chickenfoot (Fig.4 D), we conclude that a chickenfoot was equally likely to be at the origin as at the terminus. Relaxation did not change the results, implying that the chickenfoot distribution did not change with increased middle toe length. To make sure that the effect of ethidium bromide was due to an increase in ΔLk rather than unrelated chemical effects of the dye, we performed a control using nicked replication intermediates (Form II). There was no difference between restriction reactions with and without ethidium bromide for these molecules (Fig. 4 B). We visualized the chickenfoot directly by SFM. Partially replicated pREP48 molecules were incubated with ethidium bromide, deposited onto cleaved mica, and imaged by SFM using the tapping mode in air. Typical molecules are shown in Fig. 5, A-F. For 70% of topologically closed molecules, a chickenfoot was clearly evidenced by one or two long linear duplexes emerging from a three-way junction. This linear duplex does not appear without incubation in ethidium bromide, nor does it appear in plasmid DNA incubated in ethidium bromide (data not shown). The mean total middle toe length per molecule is 472 bp (TableI). We expect the middle toes to equal 470 bp. This quantitative agreement is probably fortuitous, because there is a large variation in middle toe lengths as deposition of the molecules onto mica traps them in a single conformation of a dynamic structure.Table ISFM studies on chickenfeet.

This confirms the restriction results that the chickenfoot can form at either the origin or the terminus. Unexpectedly, the molecules with chickenfeet appear supercoiled. Because the electrophoresis results showed clearly that the partially replicated molecules are not supercoiled, we believe this is an artifact of the deposition procedure for SFM. It is possible that the magnesium necessary for deposition on the mica displaced ethidium ions from the DNA (28Waring M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 269-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). The chickenfoot may not have been re-absorbed because of the slow rate of branch migration in ethidium and magnesium (26Panyutin I.G. Hsieh P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2021-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 29Mulrooney S.B. Fishel R.A. Hejna J.A. Warner R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9648-9659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), but the DNA could have become supercoiled before deposition. We showed that a (+)-ΔLk provokes the formation of a four-way junction at a replication fork in vitro. The result is a molecule without Wr, in which the (+)-ΔLk is taken up by an unwinding of parental DNA and a concomitant formation of a fourth arm of the junction. The evidence is: 1) gel electrophoresis indicates that partially replicated plasmids with a (+)-ΔLk are neither (+)-supercoiled nor precatenated and comigrate with relaxed replication intermediates; 2) a DNA duplex can be extruded from a junction by addition of ethidium bromide and detected by restriction enzyme digestion; and 3) the four-way junctions can be visualized by scanning force microscopy. This is the first definite proof of the structure of a (+)-ΔLk replication intermediate. We discuss next the energetics of chickenfoot formation, previous evidence for its occurrence in vivo, and the circumstances whereby a (+)-ΔLk may build up around a replication fork and favor chickenfoot formation. Formation of alternative DNA structures under the action of a (−)-ΔLk is a well known phenomenon (30Lilley D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6468-6472Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). These alternative structures have a higher free energy than the regular double helix, but their formation reduces the total free energy of supercoiled DNA by diminishing superhelical stress (see Ref. 31Wang J.C. Semlyen J.A. Cyclic Polymers. Elsevier Applied Science Publishers Ltd., Essex, England1986: 225-260Crossref Google Scholar, for example). Chickenfoot formation in (+)-ΔLk replication intermediates is no exception. The chickenfoot has a junction of four double helices, and thus resembles the cruciform structure, which is formed in palindromes of (−)-supercoiled DNA, but it should form much more readily. Hairpin loops with unpaired bases in the cruciform contribute to the large free energy difference between the cruciform and linear structures. These hairpin loops, however, are absent in the chickenfoot structure. Another difference is that a cruciform forms from a linear DNA, whereas the chickenfoot is formed from a three-arm junction. Thus, very little additional irregularity is associated with chickenfoot formation, as opposed to cruciform extrusion. For cruciform extrusion the free energy cost is 20–28 kcal/mol (32Vologodskaia M.Y. Vologodskii A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 851-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), depending on ionic conditions. We expect that chickenfoot formation would be associated with only about 5 kcal/mol free energy change and thus can be formed at relatively low torsional stress in comparison with cruciform extrusion, as observed. Moreover, cruciforms form slowly due to the necessity of forming a large open region in the double helix as an intermediate (33Courey A.J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1983; 33: 817-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 34Gellert M. O'Dea M.H. Mizuuchi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 35Panyutin I. Klishko V. Lyamichev V. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1984; 1: 1311-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Nothing like this is needed to form the chickenfoot, and thus there is a much smaller kinetic barrier to the transition. Indeed, only a ΔLk of (+)-1 extrudes the chickenfoot (see Fig. 3). The ease of chickenfoot formation is probably due to the entropic gain resulting from the increased number of possible conformations of the four-way junction. Our SFM and enzymatic results show that either one or two chickenfeet can form on a partially replicated plasmid. A single chickenfoot at either the origin or the terminus is enthalpically favored because there is one rather than two junction penalties. A chickenfoot at each junction, on the other hand, would be entropically favored by the increased number of possible conformations. There is an additional factor that influences whether one or two chickenfeet are formed. In molecules with fully ligated daughter strands, two chickenfeet would result in the replication bubble becoming a second topological domain, that would become (+)-supercoiled as the first domain, composed of parental strands, relaxed. The cleavage data indicate that there is no preference for chickenfoot formation at the origin or terminus. This is interesting because the two three-way junctions have different properties, due to potentially incomplete Okazaki fragments near the terminus and RNA primers at the origin. The chickenfoot was first postulated in 1976 by Higgins et al. (14Higgins N.P. Kato K. Strauss B. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 101: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) who were studying human cells treated with methyl methanesulfonate. These authors proposed that the four-way junction allowed the repair of a methyl methanesulfonate-induced lesion on the leading strand template, as shown in Fig. 6 A. Soon afterward, other researchers found similar evidence for mutagen-induced nascent-nascent duplex at replication forks (12Wanka F. Brouns R.M. Aelen J.M. Eygensteyn A. Eygensteyn J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 2083-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 13Nilsen T. Baglioni C. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 133: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Chickenfeet have also been observed in replicating DNA isolated from the eggs ofDrosophila melanogaster (36Inman R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 783: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It has more recently been proposed that the chickenfoot may play a role any time the replication fork stalls. In E. coli cells, the chickenfoot may emerge at replication forks stalled at the replication terminus (16Louarn J.M. Louarn J. Francois V. Patte J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5097-5104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), at a stalled RNA polymerase (17McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Cell. 2000; 101: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), or due to a mutant replicative helicase (15Seigneur M. Bidnenko V. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. Cell. 1998; 95: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 19Michel B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 173-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been postulated that the chickenfoot forms in yeast cells at replication fork blocks in ribosomal DNA (37Defossez P.A. Prusty R. Kaeberlein M. Lin S.J. Ferrigno P. Silver P.A. Keil R.L. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 447-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Several ways that a stalled fork can be restarted are illustrated in Fig. 6 B. It is possible that the three-way junction itself breaks without the intermediary of a chickenfoot, creating a substrate for RecBCD, the recombinogenic exonuclease (38Horiuchi T. Fujimura Y. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as shown in Fig.6 B, left. Recombination ensues with the sister arm, and a new replication fork is formed. In Fig. 6 B, middle, is shown the regression of the replication fork to form the chickenfoot. This nascent-nascent duplex itself can be chewed back entirely by RecBCD, resulting in a reformed replication fork (15Seigneur M. Bidnenko V. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. Cell. 1998; 95: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Formation of a four-way junction at replication forks may be a method by which the cells create a recombinogenic end from a three-way junction, because a four-way junction is a natural intermediate in recombination. The four-way junction of the chickenfoot may be resolved by the Holliday junction processing proteins RuvA, -B, and -C (15Seigneur M. Bidnenko V. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. Cell. 1998; 95: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 B, right). This cleavage will result in a severed replicated arm, which can then become a substrate for recombination and replication restart much like the example on the far left. The role of recombination in replication restart has recently been extensively reviewed (20Cox M. Goodman M. Kreuzer K. Sherratt D. Sandler S. Marians K. Nature. 2000; 404: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 39Cox M.M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This paper demonstrates that the chickenfoot forms spontaneously in DNA free of proteins. We find that it is stabilized by a (+)-ΔLk, but will also form at a low level in the absence of positive superhelical strain. About 10% of partially replicated molecules with a (−)-ΔLk formed a chickenfoot, and this number increased slightly if the molecules were nicked (Fig. 4 B). Low levels of chickenfoot formation due to branch migration in vitro have been seen in molecules without a (+)-ΔLk (18Viguera E. Hernandez P. Krimer D.B. Lurz R. Schvartzman J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). DNA replication causes a (+)-ΔLk in the domain surrounding the replication fork. If this (+)-ΔLk remains after a replication fork pauses, the chickenfoot would be a favored outcome. We believe that the domain surrounding the fork will have a (+)-ΔLk in all organisms, but certainly in eukaryotes and archaea which have no DNA gyrase. Thus, there will be constant pressure to form a chickenfoot when replication stops. In addition, (+)-ΔLk will build up fastest when two replication forks move toward each other (Fig. 6 C, top), as at the terminus of chromosomal replication. Louarn et al.(16Louarn J.M. Louarn J. Francois V. Patte J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5097-5104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that superhelical stress at the terminus may force a four-way junction to form at one of the replication forks. In eukaryotes, replication forks move toward each other much more frequently, whenever two adjacent domains of replication are completed. (+)-ΔLk may also build up if a replication fork is moving in the direction opposite to an RNA polymerase. Simultaneous and oppositely oriented replication and transcription leads to pausing of the replication fork (40Liu B. Alberts B.M. Science. 1995; 267: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and these pauses may allow for chickenfoot formation (Fig. 6 C, bottom). Thus, chickenfoot formation due to a (+)-ΔLk may be important during replication in the cell. We thank K. Marians and H. Hiasa for sharingin vitro partially replicated plasmids, and B. Peter for experimental help. We also thank S. Wickner, J. Mitchell, and C. T. Fink for helpful discussions, and N. P. Higgins, K. Kreuzer, and M. Cox for comments on the manuscript."

https://openalex.org/W2009259360,"We have resolved a central and long-standing paradox in understanding the amplification of rod phototransduction by making direct measurements of the gains of the underlying enzymatic amplifiers. We find that under optimized conditions a single photoisomerized rhodopsin activates transducin molecules and phosphodiesterase (PDE) catalytic subunits at rates of 120-150/s, much lower than indirect estimates from light-scattering experiments. Further, we measure the Michaelis constant, Km, of the rod PDE activated by transducin to be 10 microM, at least 10-fold lower than published estimates. Thus, the gain of cGMP hydrolysis (determined by kcat/Km) is at least 10-fold higher than reported in the literature. Accordingly, our results now provide a quantitative account of the overall gain of the rod cascade in terms of directly measured factors."

These enzymes initiate the biodegradation of some of the most recalcitrant aromatic compounds that enter the environment from both natural and industrial sources, making their study of great importance for progress in bioremediation practices (5Timmis K.N. Pieper D.H. Trends Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 201-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 6Lau P.C.K. De Lorenzo V. Environ. Sci. Technol. 1999; 33: 124A-128ACrossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the inherent enantio- and regiospecificity of these enzymes make them useful for synthetic applications (7Hudlicky T. Gonzalez D. Gibson D.T. Aldrichimica Acta. 1999; 32: 35-62Google Scholar, 8Boyd D.R. Sheldrake G.N. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1998; 15: 309-324Crossref Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Several of these multicomponent dioxygenases are known that differ in the number of components and the number and type of subunits in the oxygenase component that contains the active site. However, all of the enzyme systems share the common features of a reductase component that can accept and pass on two electrons from reduced pyridine nucleotide, an electron transport system that may be encompassed into the reductase, and an oxygenase that has both Rieske [2Fe-2S] clusters and mononuclear iron centers. One of the most thoroughly studied of the Rieske nonheme iron dioxygenases is naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase (NDOS)1 isolated fromPseudomonas sp. NCIB 9816-4, which catalyzes the reaction shown in Scheme FS1 to yield (+)-cis-(1R,2S)-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene (9Resnick S.M. Lee K. Gibson D.T. J. Ind. Microb. 1996; 17: 438-457Crossref Google Scholar). The complete NDOS consists of three protein components: the 36-kDa reductase protein (NDR) that contains a FAD molecule and a plant-type [2Fe-2S] cluster, the 14-kDa ferredoxin electron transfer protein (NDF) that contains a [2Fe-2S] Rieske cluster, and the 210-kDa α3β3 oxygenase component (NDO) that contains the Rieske and mononuclear iron centers essential to catalysis. Recently, the crystal structure of NDO was solved, representing the first structure from this enzyme class (10Kauppi B. Lee K. Carredano E. Parales R.E. Gibson D.T. Eklund H. Ramaswamy S. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 571-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). It showed that even though both the Rieske and mononuclear iron centers are bound in the α subunit, they reside in widely separated sites (44 Å). However, the quaternary structure of the protein places each Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster within 12 Å of the mononuclear iron site in the adjacent α subunit. Experimental evidence suggests that it is these pairs of sites that interact during catalysis via a conserved Asp residue that couples the centers (10Kauppi B. Lee K. Carredano E. Parales R.E. Gibson D.T. Eklund H. Ramaswamy S. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 571-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 11Parales R.E. Parales J.V. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1831-1837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure also showed that the alternative NDO substrate indole binds near the mononuclear iron, suggesting that this is the oxygen-activating site (12Carredano E. Karlsson A. Kauppi B. Choudhury D. Parales R.E. Parales J.V. Lee K. Gibson D.T. Eklund H. Ramaswamy S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 701-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In support of this proposal, site-directed mutagenesis studies on NDO demonstrated that substitution of the hydrophobic residues lining the substrate binding pocket alter both the stereo- and regioselectivity of NDO (13Parales R.E. Lee K. Resnick S.M. Jiang H.Y. Lessner D.J. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1641-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Also, the ligands of the mononuclear iron are one solvent, two histidines and one bidentate aspartic acid forming a 2-His 1-carboxylate “facial triad,” as observed in many other O2-activating iron-containing enzymes (14Hegg E.L. Que L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 15Que L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 182-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This coordination potentially allows one or two exogenous ligands to bind. Accordingly, it has been observed for the phthalate dioxygenase (PDOS) that small molecules mimicking oxygen binding, such as N3−, can bind to the mononuclear iron and form binary enzyme-N3− and ternary enzyme-substrate-N3− complexes (16Gassner G.T. Ballou D.P. Landrum G.A. Whittaker J.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4820-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,17Pavel E.G. Martins L.J. Ellis Jr., W.R. Solomon E.I. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1994; 1: 173-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Taken together, the data provide a good structural model for how Rieske nonheme iron dioxygenases bind substrates in the oxygenase component. However, the chemistries of O2 activation and substrate hydroxylation are less well understood. Indeed, to date essentially all mechanistic hypotheses have been based on diagnostic chemistry rather than kinetic analysis or direct observation of intermediates with the consequence that no consensus mechanism has emerged. An essential step in the search for intermediates in the mechanism of cis-diol formation is to determine which protein components are essential for the reaction and what redox state of each of the enzyme cofactors yields a catalytically competent entity. Scheme FS1 shows that the balanced chemical equation requires two electrons for substrate hydroxylation. However, little is known about where these electrons must reside at the onset of catalysis or the pathway of electron transfer during O2 activation. Previously, a mechanism was proposed whereby an essential complex forms between the phthalate dioxygenase reductase and oxygenase components during O2binding/activation (18Batie C.J. LaHaie E. Ballou D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1510-1518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ballou D. Batie C. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1988; 274: 211-226PubMed Google Scholar, 20Batie C.J. Ballou D.P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 188: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The authors suggest that the electron transfer component is required for efficient catalysis as a direct source of electrons for oxygen activation and possibly as an effector to tune the structure of the oxygenase for catalysis. Similar roles for essential effector proteins have been proposed for several other oxygenases. For example, putidaredoxin in the P450camsystem and component B in the MMO system are thought to assume essential roles as effectors during the catalytic cycle of these monooxygenases (21Tyson C.A. Lipscomb J.D. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5777-5784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lipscomb J.D. Sligar S.G. Namtvedt M.J. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol.

Rev. 1996; 96: 2625-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). In the past, we have been able to resolve questions related to the component and reactant requirements for efficient catalysis in systems such as P450cam and MMO by studying single turnover reactions (21Tyson C.A. Lipscomb J.D. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5777-5784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wallar B.J. Lipscomb J.D. Chem.

Here we employ this strategy to determine the requirements for protein component interactions and electron transfer processes for catalysis by NDOS. By combining the techniques of product analysis, transient kinetics, and spectroscopy, it is shown that reduced NDO is capable of carrying out all aspects of the chemical reaction catalyzed by NDOS without the other two components. Moreover, the full rate of the reconstituted system is attained by NDO alone. This work provides a new protocol for the study of this enzyme class as well as insight into the intermediates of the catalytic sequence. All chemicals were purchased from either Sigma, Aldrich, or Matheson and used without purification. (+)-cis-(1R,2S)-Dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene (naphthalene cis-dihydrodiol) was prepared as described previously (26Jeffrey A.M. Yeh H.J. Jerina D.M. Patel T.R. Davey J.F. Gibson D.T. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Water was distilled and further purified using a Millipore reverse osmosis system. All experiments were performed using NDO purified from either Pseudomonas sp. NCIB 9816–4 or from Escherichia coli JM109(DE3)(pDTG141) that contains the cloned genes for NDOS (27Suen W.C. Gene Expression of Naphthalene Dioxygenase from Pseudomonas sp. NCIB 9816-4 in E. coli.Ph.D. thesis. University of Iowa, 1991Google Scholar). NCIB 9816-4 was grown on naphthalene (0.075 g/liter) in mineral salts base medium (28Cohen-Bazire G. Sistrom W.R. Stanier R.Y. J. Cell. Comp. Physiol. 1957; 49: 25-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar) as described previously (29Ensley B.D. Gibson D.T. Laborde A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 948-954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the addition of 5 mmsalicylate to yield ∼600 g of wet cell paste from 240 liters of culture. Growth of E. coli and induction were performed as described previously (30Lee K. Resnick S.M. Gibson D.T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2067-2070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NDR and NDF were purified as described previously (31Lee K. Biochemical Studies on Toluene and Naphthalene Dioxygenases.Ph.D. thesis. University of Iowa, 1995Google Scholar). NDO was purified from both NCIB 9816-4 and E. coli using the procedure described previously (32Lee K. Kauppi B. Parales R.E. Gibson D.T. Ramaswamy S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with the omission of the final S-300 size exclusion column. NDO activity was routinely assayed polarographically at 23 °C by monitoring O2 consumption with a Clark-type electrode as described previously (33Whittaker J.W. Orville A.M. Lipscomb J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 188: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained air-saturated 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, 300 μm NADH, and ∼250 μm naphthalene. NDOS components were added to concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0 μm for NDR and NDF, respectively, whereas NDO was maintained below 50 nm. Enzyme concentrations were routinely determined by UV absorption with extinction coefficients we have determined from purified protein and the Bradford assay (NDR ε280 ∼ 86.0 mm−1cm−1; NDF ε276 ∼ 16.1 mm−1cm−1; NDO ε280 ∼ 129 mm (αβ)−1cm−1). Iron was added to the assay as Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O to a final concentration of 100 μm where indicated. One unit of NDO activity is defined as the amount of NDO required to consume 1 μmol of O2 per min. The concentration of iron in NDO samples was determined either by the method of Fish (34Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 54: 357-364Crossref Scopus (535) Google Scholar) or by atomic absorption spectroscopy using a Varian SpectAA 100 system. The mononuclear iron occupancy was determined by subtracting the Rieske iron content determined by EPR spectroscopy (each S = 1/2 spin = 2.0 Fe) from the total iron. For example, the enzyme used for the experiments described in Table I contained 0.95 spin/mol and 2.7 Fe/mol to yield 0.8 mononuclear iron per αβ. However, for NDO preparations containing less than 1 Rieske cluster/αβ, it is likely that some mononuclear iron occupies sites that do not contain intact Rieske cluster.Table ISingle turnover of Pseudomonas sp.

Open table in a new tab Turnover experiments were conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures” with a ratio of naphthalene:NDO αβ = 4:1 and NDO αβ to NDF or NDR ratios of 1:1 where indicated. All samples were allowed to incubate for 1 h at 23 °C. The reactions were terminated by heat-denaturing the enzyme, which allows the release of any products that may be tightly bound in the active site. Each reaction condition was completed 3–8 times with a S.E. less than 10%. Single turnover reactions were completed in either a quartz cuvette equipped with a mixing chamber and Teflon-sealed cap, a Teflon-sealed reaction vial, a stopped-flow instrument, or a septum-sealed EPR tube as appropriate. Enzyme component(s) were made anaerobic in 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.8, in a septum-sealed vial and transferred to the appropriate reaction vessel with a gas-tight syringe. The reduction/oxidation states of the components were monitored using a Hewlett Packard 8453 diode-array spectrophotometer. For product analysis, each reaction contained ∼25 nmol of NDO active sites (αβ) and/or ∼25 nmol of NDF or NDR where indicated. The reaction was initiated by the addition of an equal volume of buffer saturated with naphthalene (∼250 μm) and O2(∼1.4 mm). Each reaction was performed in a volume that maintained the naphthalene/active site ratio at no less than 1 (typically 4). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 23 °C for the times indicated. The reaction was quenched by transferring the mixture to an Eppendorf tube, which was then heated by immersion in a 90 °C water bath for 2 min. This method completely denatured the protein, as judged by a complete loss of the characteristic red-brown color of the enzyme(s) and total loss of activity. Control reactions using authentic naphthalene cis-dihydrodiol verified that no breakdown of product occurs during heat quenching. Samples were vortexed briefly and frozen in liquid N2 before HPLC analysis. For rapid chemical quench analysis of product formation, the enzyme solution was anaerobically transferred to one syringe of a chemical quench instrument (Update Instruments, Inc.), and the other syringe was loaded with O2- and naphthalene-saturated buffer. After rapid mixing, the solutions were passed through calibrated aging tubing and then sprayed into an equal volume of 6 n NaOH. The estimated dead time of the experiment was 10 ms. Loss of product under the chemical quench conditions was reduced by immediately neutralizing the solution by the addition of equal volumes of 3n HCl and 0.5 m MES, pH 6.8. A small amount of product decay is seen during chemical quench experiments; therefore, the standard curve was generated using naphthalenecis-dihydrodiol treated in the same manner as the chemical quench of NDO turnover. Reactions monitored by EPR spectroscopy were performed in sealed reaction vials. After initiation of the reaction, the mixture was rapidly transferred to an EPR tube and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Single turnover reactions performed for the determination of reoxidation rates were completed using an Applied Photophysics (model SX.18MV) stopped-flow instrument. The syringes were loaded with solutions as described above (with or without naphthalene), but the reaction was monitored with a diode array detector or a single wavelength detector at 464 nm. Diode array data was analyzed using Pro-K software supplied by Applied Photophysics, whereas single wavelength data was fit using the program KFIT supplied by Neil C. Millar (King's College London, UK). The reduction of protein components was completed by the addition of buffered sodium dithionite to the enzyme solution in the presence of methyl viologen (5 μm) until a slight residual color from reduced methyl viologen was observed. For reactions that used both oxidized and reduced components, the oxidized protein was loaded into the syringe containing O2 and naphthalene. Before HPLC analysis, each sample was centrifuged to pellet precipitated protein and filtered through a 0.2-μm Nylon syringe filter (Gelman). Chromatography was performed using a Beckman Gold HPLC system. The sample was injected onto a Beckman Ultrasphere ODS C18 reversed-phase column (4.6 mm × 25 cm) equilibrated in 20% methanol in H2O. Two min after injection, a linear gradient of methanol (20–100%) was applied over 20 min. Absorption was monitored at 262 nm (naphthalenecis-dihydrodiol product: ε264 = 8.11 mm−1cm−1). One product peak was identified as naphthalene cis-dihydrodiol and quantified by comparison to authentic standard. X-band EPR spectra were collected on a Bruker E500 spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR-10 liquid helium cryostat. The nitrosyl complexes of NDO were prepared by briefly bubbling the enzyme solution with nitric oxide (NO) passed through 6 n NaOH. EPR spectra of spin S = 3/2, and spin 5/2 complexes were analyzed according to the following spin Hamiltonian equations, respectively. H^e=goβeS→H→+D[SZ2−5/4+E/D(SX2−SY2)]Equation 1 H^e=goβeS→H→+D[SZ2−35/12+E/D(SX2−SY2)]Equation 2 where D and E/D are zero field-splitting parameters, and the other parameters have their usual definitions. The term E/D is a measure of the departure of the electronic environment of the iron from axial symmetry. E/D values were determined for this study using the software program RHOMBO, which was provided by Wilfred Hagen (Department of Biotechnology, Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands). Spin quantitation was completed as described by Aasa and Vänngård (35Aasa R. Vänngård T. J. Magn. Reson. 1975; 19: 308-315Google Scholar) using 1 mm CuClO4, 1 mm Fe3+-EDTA, or 1 mmFe2+-EDTA-NO as standards (35Aasa R. Vänngård T. J. Magn. Reson. 1975; 19: 308-315Google Scholar). Spin quantitation of theg = 4.3 species formed during single turnover was performed by using the Fe3+-EDTA standard and collecting both the experimental and standard spectra at 20 K. At this temperature, for S = 5/2 species with E/D = 1/3 and −1< D < 1, the middle Kramer's doublet (MS = ±3/2) is approximately maximally occupied. Under these conditions, theg = 4.3 species represents ∼1/3 of the total spins. D for Fe3+-EDTA was taken as 0.83 cm−1 (36Aasa R.J. J. Chem. Phys. 1970; 52: 3919-3930Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Using the temperature dependence of the g = 4.3 species of the NDO single turnover, we have determined D to be 0.76 ± 0.02 cm−1. As purified, resting NDO contains a nearly fully occupied oxidized Rieske cluster and a partially occupied reduced (Fe2+) mononuclear center (see below) in each αβ protomer. This form of the enzyme also has a small amount of the naphthalene cis-dihydrodiol product (<6% of active sites) associated with it (Table I). The concentration of product observed is within the error of the measurement and does not change with incubation of the resting enzyme with O2 and naphthalene for up to 1 h. Furthermore, the addition of Fe2+ to this reaction mixture to increase the population of the mononuclear iron site results in no increase in the amount of product observed within experimental error. Thus, despite having nearly fully occupied metal sites and high concentrations of the two substrates naphthalene and O2, resting NDO does not appear to catalyze substrate dioxygenation. Treatment of NDO with a stoichiometric (1 electron per αβ subunit) amount of dithionite results in the one-electron reduction of the Rieske cluster (see below). Because this form of NDO differs from resting NDO primarily by the reduction of the Rieske cluster, we will refer to it as reduced NDO. Table I shows that the addition of naphthalene and O2 to reduced NDO results in the formation of ∼0.7 eq of the stereo- and regiochemically correct product per αβ active site at the conclusion of the reaction. We have found that the method of analysis is important for these reactions. If the product yield was assessed by ultrafiltration of the reaction mixture rather than complete denaturation of the enzyme, more than 80% of the product remained bound to the enzyme. The addition of Fe2+ to the steady state reaction of NDO and other Rieske nonheme iron oxygenases increases activity (18Batie C.J. LaHaie E. Ballou D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1510-1518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Suen W.C. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5877-5881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,38Bernhardt F.H. Meisch H.U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 93: 1247-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Likewise, the addition of 100 μm ferrous ion to the single turnover reaction increases the product yield, as shown in TableI, suggesting that some of the added iron is incorporated into unoccupied sites. These data indicate for the first time that NDO in which both the Rieske and mononuclear iron centers are reduced is capable of converting naphthalene to its cis-dihydrodiol in high yield in the absence of NDOS components NDF and NDR. The addition of 1 eq of reduced NDF (one NDF/NDO αβ) to the single turnover reaction increases the amount of product formed by 56% (TableI), consistent with NDF transferring its electron to the active site of the oxygenase. Since two electrons are required per product formed and each reduced NDF carries one electron, a maximum increase of 50% would be expected. However, ∼30% of reduced NDO Rieske clusters have not reacted to yield product after an initial single turnover (see Table I, reduced NDO turnover). Thus, it appears that a portion of the electrons in unreacted NDO Rieske clusters are used to form additional product. Support for this conclusion is seen in the reaction of reduced NDO with oxidized NDF, naphthalene, and O2. As shown in Table I, the addition of oxidized NDF increases the amount of product formed, yet the yield does not exceed that expected based on the total number of electrons initially present in the Rieske and mononuclear iron centers of NDO, suggesting that the oxidized NDF facilitates the utilization of these electrons. This can be explored more explicitly using spectroscopic approaches as shown below. In contrast, it appears that neither oxidized nor reduced NDR increases the yield of NDO turnover, indicating that NDR is incapable of transferring electrons to NDO or transferring electrons between oxygenase active sites in the absence of NDF. This observation is consistent with the proposed role of NDF in coupling electron transfer from NADH-reduced NDR to NDO (39Haigler B.E. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 465-468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Haigler B.E. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 457-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

The consequences of this deletion were assessed by expressing wild-type and the Del301–303 receptors in Chinese hamster ovary and COS cells. Ligand binding was not affected, although a small decrease in coupling efficiency to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase was observed with the mutant. The deletion occurs within a stretch of acidic residues that is thought to establish the milieu for agonist-promoted phosphorylation and desensitization of the receptor by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). Agonist-promoted phosphorylation studies carried out in cells coexpressing the α2BARs and GRK2 revealed that the Del301–303 receptor displayed ∼56% of wild-type phosphorylation. Furthermore, the depressed phosphorylation imposed by the deletion was found to result in a complete loss of short term agonist-promoted receptor desensitization. Thus the major phenotype of the Del301–303 α2BAR is one of impaired phosphorylation and desensitization by GRKs, and thus the polymorphisms renders the receptor incapable of modulation by this key mechanism of dynamic regulation.

Agonist-promoted phosphorylation studies carried out in cells coexpressing the α2BARs and GRK2 revealed that the Del301–303 receptor displayed ∼56% of wild-type phosphorylation. Furthermore, the depressed phosphorylation imposed by the deletion was found to result in a complete loss of short term agonist-promoted receptor desensitization. Thus the major phenotype of the Del301–303 α2BAR is one of impaired phosphorylation and desensitization by GRKs, and thus the polymorphisms renders the receptor incapable of modulation by this key mechanism of dynamic regulation. adrenergic receptor(s) G protein-coupled receptor kinase polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) Chinese hamster ovary α2-Adrenergic receptors (α2AR)1 are cell surface receptors for catecholamines that bind to the Gi/Go family of G proteins, coupling to multiple effector systems including inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity (1Limbird L.E. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2686-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). α2AR are widely expressed within the central and peripheral nervous system (2Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. Mol.

The α2BAR has a distinct pattern of expression within the brain, liver, lung, and kidney, and recent studies using gene knockouts in mice have shown that disruption of this receptor effects mouse viability (13Link R.E.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25473-25479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This desensitization is due to phosphorylation of the receptor, which evokes a partial uncoupling of the receptor from functional interaction with Gi/Go (18Jewell-Motz, E. A., and Liggett, S. B. (1953) (1995)Biochemistry34, 11946–1Google Scholar, 19Kurose H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10093-10099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such phosphorylation appears to be due to G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), a family of serine/threonine kinases that phosphorylate the agonist-occupied conformations of many G protein-coupled receptors (20Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). The process serves to finely regulate receptor function providing for rapid adaptation of the cell to its environment. Desensitization may also limit the therapeutic effectiveness of administered agonists. For the α2BAR, phosphorylation of serines/threonines in the third intracellular loop of the receptor is dependent on the presence of a stretch of acidic residues in the loop that appears to establish the milieu for GRK function (18Jewell-Motz, E. A., and Liggett, S. B. (1953) (1995)Biochemistry34, 11946–1Google Scholar). In this report we delineate the phenotype of a common polymorphism of the α2BAR (21Heinonen P. Koulu M. Pesonen U.

Hypertens. 1999; 12: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which consists of a deletion of three glutamic acid residues in this region; such a variation has a pronounced effect on receptor phosphorylation leading to a loss of agonist-promoted desensitization. The sequence encoding the third intracellular loop of the human α2BAR (GenBankTM accession number AF005900) was examined for polymorphic variation by performing polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) to amplify this portion of the cDNA from genomic DNA derived from blood samples. In this paper the adenine of the initiator ATG codon of the open reading frame of the receptor is designated as nucleotide 1, and amino acid 1 is the encoded methionine. The human receptor consists of 450 amino acids. For initial examination, DNA from 39 normal individuals was utilized. Two overlapping fragments encompassing the third intracellular loop region were generated using the following primer pairs: fragment 1 (534 bp), 5′-GCTCATCATCCCTTTCTCGCT (sense) and 5′-AAAGCCCCACCATGGTCGGGT (antisense) and fragment 2 (588 bp), 5′-CTGATCGCCAAACGAGCAAC (sense) and 5′-AAAAACGCCAATGACCACAG (antisense). The 5′ end of each sense and antisense primer also contained sequences corresponding to the M13 forward (5′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT) and M13 reverse (5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC) universal sequencing primers, respectively. The PCR reactions consisted of ∼100 ng of genomic DNA, 5 pmol of each primer, 0.8 mmdNTPs, 10% Me2SO, 2.5 units of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), 20 μl of 5× buffer J (Invitrogen) in a 100-μl reaction volume. Reactions were started by an initial incubation at 94 °C for 4 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C (fragment 1) or 60 °C (fragment 2) for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. PCR reactions were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification system (Qiagen), and automated sequencing of both strands of each PCR product was performed using Applied Biosystems 370 sequencer using dye primer methods. As discussed below, a 9 bp in-frame deletion beginning at nucleotide 901 was detected that resulted in a loss of three glutamic acid residues at amino acid positions 301–303. Thus, this polymorphism was denoted Del301–303. No other nonsynonymous or synonymous polymorphisms were identified. PCR amplification of 209- and 200-bp fragments encompassing this polymorphic region allowed screening of additional DNA samples whose genotypes were distinguished by size when run on 4% Nuseive agarose gels. PCR conditions were the same as described above except that buffer F was used with the following primers: 5′-AGAAGGAGGGTGTTTGTGGGG (sense) and 5′-ACCTATAGCACCCACGCCCCT (antisense). To create the polymorphic α2BAR construct, a 1585-bp PCR product encompassing the α2BAR gene was amplified from a homozygous deletion individual using the following primers: 5′-GGCCGACGCTCTTGTCTAGCC (sense) and 5′-CAAGGGGTTCCTAAGATGAG. This fragment was digested and subcloned into the Xcm I and Bam HI sites of the wild-type α2BAR sequence in the expression vector pBC12BI (17Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25473-25479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The integrity of the construct was verified by sequencing. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) were stably transfected by a calcium phosphate precipitation technique as described previously using 30 μg of each receptor construct and 0.5 μg of pSV2neo to provide for G418 resistance (23Eason M.G. Jacinto M.T. Liggett S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 696-702PubMed Google Scholar). Selection of positive clones was carried out in 1.0 mg/ml G418, and expression of the α2BAR from individual clonal lines was determined by radioligand binding as described below. Several clonal lines with matched expression levels between 500 and 1000 fmol/mg were utilized as indicated. Cells were grown in monolayers in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 80 μg/ml G418 (to maintain selection pressure) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For phosphorylation experiments, receptors were epitope tagged with the influenza hemagglutinin nonopeptide (YPYDVPDYA) at the amino terminus. This was accomplished by constructing vectors using the above constructs with insertions of in-frame sequence encoding the peptide using PCRs essentially as described previously (24Jewell-Motz E.A. Small K.M. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28989-28993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Tagged receptors were expressed at ∼15 pmol/mg, along with GRK2 (βARK1), in COS-7 cells using a DEAE Dextran technique as described (16Eason M.G. Moreira S.P. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4681-4688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). α2AR inhibition of adenylyl cyclase was determined in membrane preparations from CHO cells stably expressing the two receptors using methods similar to those described previously (25Small K.M. Forbes S.L. Rahman F.F. Bridges K.M. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23059-23064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell membranes (∼20 μg) were incubated with 27 μm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.6 μm GTP, 0.1 mm cAMP, 0.12 mm ATP, 50 μg/ml myokinase, 0.05 mm ascorbic acid, and 2 μCi of [α-32P]ATP in a buffer containing 40 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 1.6 mm MgCl2, and 0.8 mm EDTA for 30 min at 37 °C. Activities were measured in the presence of water (basal), 5 μm forskolin, and 5 μm forskolin with the indicated concentrations of agonists. Reactions were terminated by the addition of a stop solution containing excess ATP and cAMP and ∼100,000 dpm of [3H]cAMP. Labeled cAMP was isolated by gravity chromatography over alumina columns with [3H]cAMP used to quantitate column recovery. Results are expressed as percentages of inhibition of forskolin-stimulated activity. For desensitization experiments, cells were pretreated for 30 min at 37 °C with medium alone or with medium containing 10 μm norepinephrine, placed on ice, and washed five times with cold phosphate-buffered saline prior to membrane preparation. Desensitization of α2BAR is manifested by a shift to the right in the dose-response curve for the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (i.e. increase in EC50) without a significant change in the maximal response (17Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25473-25479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Jewell-Motz, E. A., and Liggett, S. B.

To quantitate the magnitude of this desensitization, the inhibitory response under control conditions at a submaximal concentration of agonist (the EC50) in the assay was determined from the curve and compared with the response to this same concentration from membranes derived from cells exposed to norepinephrine. This method has been previously validated (26Hausdorff W.P. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Irons G.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12657-12665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in several G protein-coupled receptor systems. Expression of mutant and wild-type α2BAR was determined using saturation binding assays as described (25Small K.M. Forbes S.L. Rahman F.F. Bridges K.M. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23059-23064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 27Baron B.M. Siegel B.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 348-356PubMed Google Scholar) with [3H]yohimbine or [125I]aminoclonidine with 10 μmphentolamine or 10 μm yohimbine, respectively, used to define nonspecific binding. For competition studies, membranes were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgSO4, 0.5 mm EDTA with 2.0 nm[3H]yohimbine and 16 concentrations of the indicated competitor in the absence or presence of guanine nucleotide for 30 min at 25 °C. Reactions for the above radioligand binding studies were terminated by dilution with 4 volumes of ice-cold 10 mmTris-HCl pH 7.4 buffer and vacuum filtration over Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters. Transiently transfected COS-7 cells expressing equivalent levels of each receptor were grown to confluence and incubated with [32P]orthophosphate (∼4 mCi/100-mm plate) for 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were then incubated in the presence or absence of 100 μmnorepinephrine for 15 min, washed five times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and solubilized in 1 ml of a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA in phosphate-buffered saline, by rotation in a microcentrifuge tube for 2 h at 4 °C. This and all subsequent steps included the protease inhibitors benzamidine (10 μg/ml), soybean trypsin inhibitor (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 mg/ml), and leupeptin (5 μg/ml) and the phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride (10 mm) and sodium pyrophosphate (10 mm). (A separate flask was scraped in 5 mm Tris/2 mmEDTA, and the membranes were prepared for radioligand binding as described above.) Unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The hemagglutinin epitope tagged α2BARs were immunoprecipitated using an anti-hemagglutinin high affinity monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (24Jewell-Motz E.A. Small K.M. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28989-28993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, solubilized material was preincubated for 2 h at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose beads to remove nonspecific binding. The supernatant was then incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads and a 1:200 dilution of antibody for 18 h at 4 °C. Following immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed three times by centrifugation and resuspension and then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in SDS sample buffer. Proteins in the supernatant were then fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel with equal amounts of receptor (based on radioligand binding) loaded in each lane. Signals were visualized and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager with ImageQuant Software. Protein determinations were by the copper bicinchoninic acid method (28Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar). Data from adenylyl cyclase and radioligand binding assays were analyzed by iterative least square techniques using Prizm software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Agreement between genotypes observed and those predicted by the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was assessed by a Chi-squared test with one degree of freedom. Genotype comparisons were by Fisher's exact test. Comparisons of results from biochemical studies were by t tests, and significance was considered when p < 0.05. Data are provided as the means ± S.E. Sequence analysis of the third intracellular loop of the α2BAR gene from 78 chromosomes revealed a single sequence variant. This consisted of an in-frame 9-bp deletion (GAAGAGGAG) beginning at nucleotide 901 (Fig.1 A) that results in loss of three glutamic acid residues at amino acid positions 301–303 of the third intracellular loop of the receptor (Fig.2). Using the rapid detection method (Fig. 1 B), allele frequencies were determined in a larger population. The frequencies of the wild-type and the Del301–303 polymorphic α2BAR are shown in TableI. The deletion polymorphism is more common in Caucasians than African-Americans, with allele frequencies of 0.31 and 0.12, respectively. The distribution of homozygous and heterozygous alleles in either population was not different than that predicted from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p > 0.8).Figure 2Localization of the α2BAR polymorphism.

Saturation radioligand binding studies revealed a small but statistically significant lower affinity for the α2AR antagonist [3H]yohimbine for Del301–303 compared with the wild-type receptor (K d= 5.1 ± 0.2 versus 3.8 ± 0.3 nm, respectively, n = 5, p < 0.05). Agonist (epinephrine) competition binding experiments carried out in the presence of quanosine 5′(β-α-imido)triphosphate revealed a small increase in the K i for the polymorphic receptor (285 ± 8.7 versus 376 ± 66 nm, n = 5, p < 0.05). In similar studies carried out in the absence of guanine nucleotide, two-site fits were obtained for both receptors with no differences in the K L or the percentage of receptors in the high affinity state (R H; Table II). However, a trend toward an increased K H was observed with the Del301–303 mutant. These results prompted additional studies with the partial agonist radioligand [125I]aminoclonidine. Saturation binding studies (in the absence of quanosine 5′(β-α-imido)triphosphate) with concentrations of the ligand from 0.2 to 4 nm revealed a single site with aK d of ∼1 nm as reported by others (27Baron B.M. Siegel B.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 348-356PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the wild-type α2BAR and the Del301–303 receptor revealed essentially identical Kdvalues for [125I]aminoclonidine (1.33 ± 0.12versus 1.22 ± 0.07 nm, respectively). Taken together, the data suggest that there is little, if any, effect of the deletion in the third intracellular loop on the conformation of the ligand binding pocket within the transmembrane spanning domains.Table IILigand binding properties of wild-type and Del301–303 α2BAR expressed in CHO cellsReceptor[3H]Yohimbine[125I]AminoclonidineSaturation bindingEpinephrine competitionSaturation bindingB maxK DK iK HK LR HB maxK Dfmol/mgnmnmnm%fmol/mgnmWild type671 ± 563.8 ± 0.3285 ± 8.72.9 ± 0.8346 ± 11141 ± 4118 ± 271.33 ± 0.12Del301–303538 ± 795.1 ± 0.22-ap < 0.05 compared with wild-type α2BAR.376 ± 662-ap < 0.05 compared with wild-type α2BAR.4.1 ± 1.2357 ± 13542 ± 5106 ± 201.22 ± 0.07Saturation binding isotherms and competition studies were carried out with membranes from CHO cells expressing equivalent levels of receptor.2-a p < 0.05 compared with wild-type α2BAR. Open table in a new tab Saturation binding isotherms and competition studies were carried out with membranes from CHO cells expressing equivalent levels of receptor. To address the functional consequences of the mutation, studies examining agonist-promoted inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities were carried out in lines expressing the wild-type α2BAR and the Del301–303 receptor at densities of 626 ± 54 and 520 ± 82 fmol/mg (n = 7,p > 0.05). The results of these studies are shown in Table III. As can be seen, the Del301–303 receptor displayed less inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (23.4 ± 2.2%) compared with wild-type α2BAR (28.5 ± 1.6%, p < 0.05). Furthermore, the polymorphic receptor had a greater EC50 (19.6 ± 5.5versus 7.9 ± 2.1 μm, p< 0.01). Thus, the loss of the three glutamic acids in the third intracellular loop, which is known to contain regions important for G protein coupling, results in a modest decrease in agonist-mediated receptor function.Table IIIAdenylyl cyclase activities of the wild-type and Del301–303 α2BAR expressed in CHO cellsBasalForskolinMax Inhibition (%)EC50 (μm)Submax inhibitionDesensitizationCtrlNEpmol/min/mgpmol/min/mg%%Wild type2.0 ± 0.215.1 ± 0.928.5 ± 1.67.9 ± 2.116.5 ± 3.97.6 ± 2.33-ap < 0.05 compared with control.54Del301–3031.2 ± 0.13-bp < 0.05 compared with wild-type α2BAR.11.9 ± 0.93-bp < 0.05 compared with wild-type α2BAR.23.4 ± 2.23-bp < 0.05 compared with wild-type α2BAR.19.6 ± 5.53-bp < 0.05 compared with wild-type α2BAR.17.1 ± 3.015.9 ± 1.73-bp < 0.05 compared with wild-type α2BAR.7Adenylyl cyclase activities were determined in membranes in response to forskolin (5 μm) and forskolin plus various concentrations of norepinephrine.

Open table in a new tab Adenylyl cyclase activities were determined in membranes in response to forskolin (5 μm) and forskolin plus various concentrations of norepinephrine. See also Fig. 3. The deletion polymorphism occurs in a highly acidic stretch of amino acids (EDEAEEEEEEEEEEEE) within the third intracellular loop of α2BAR (Fig. 2). The structural importance of this region has been previously assessed and shown to be critical for short term agonist-promoted receptor phosphorylation leading to desensitization (18Jewell-Motz, E. A., and Liggett, S. B. (1953) (1995)Biochemistry34, 11946–1Google Scholar). These data and reports by others (29Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) suggest that this acidic environment is necessary for receptor phosphorylation by GRKs. Therefore, to investigate the consequences of this deletion polymorphism on receptor desensitization, agonist-promoted inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity was determined in membranes from CHO cells expressing the wild-type and Del301–303 receptor after pretreatment with norepinephrine. In these experiments, cells were incubated with medium alone or medium containing agonist (10 μmnorepinephrine) for 30 min at 37 °C and subsequently extensively washed at 4 °C; membranes were prepared, and agonist-mediated inhibition of forskolin stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was determined. As described previously (17Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25473-25479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and shown in Fig.3 and Table II, desensitization of wild-type α2BAR expressed in CHO cells is manifested by an increase in the EC50 for agonist-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Analysis of composite curves derived from four independent experiments shows an increase from 7.4 to 29.4 μm for the wild-type α2BAR. In contrast, there was no change in the EC50 for the deletion receptor following agonist pretreatment (29.5 μm versus 31.2 μm). Desensitization was quantitated by examining adenylyl cyclase activities at a submaximal concentration of agonist (the EC50 for the control condition). At this concentration, wild-type α2BAR inhibited adenylyl cyclase activity by 16.5 ± 3.9%; with agonist pre-exposure, inhibition at this same concentration of agonist was 7.6 ± 2.3% (n = 4, p < 0.05, Fig. 3 C), amounting to ∼54% desensitization of receptor function. Submaximal inhibition of adenylyl cyclase for the Del301–303 receptor, however, was not different between control and agonist-treated cells (17.1 ± 3.0% versus 15.9 ± 1.7%, n = 4, p = ns). In another two cell lines with matched expression of ∼600 fmol/mg, the same desensitization phenotypes for wild-type and the Del301–303 polymorphic receptor were observed (data not shown). We next performed whole cell phosphorylation studies of the wild-type and polymorphic α2BAR under the same conditions used for desensitization. We hypothesized that agonist-promoted phosphorylation would be decreased in the polymorphic receptor. However, given that this receptor displays rightward-shifted dose-response curves for inhibition of adenylyl cyclase at base line, we also considered the possibility that the receptor is significantly phosphorylated in the basal state. Studies were carried out in cells cotransfected with the receptor and GRK2 (βARK1), a strategy that we have previously shown to be useful in identifying receptor-GRK interactions (30Jewell-Motz E.A.

The wild-type α2BAR underwent a 5.84 ± 0.49-fold increase in phosphorylation with agonist exposure. In contrast, although the Del301–303 receptor displayed some degree of agonist-promoted phosphorylation, the extent was clearly less (3.28 ± 0.24-fold,p < 0.05 compared with wild type). Basal phosphorylation was equivalent between the two receptors. It is interesting to note that this partial loss of phosphorylation results in a receptor that fails to undergo any degree of functional desensitization. Although it might seem reasonable to assume that such phosphorylation would be associated with some degree of desensitization, several previous studies with the α2AAR and α2BAR subtypes indicate that full (i.e. wild type) phosphorylation is necessary for the desensitization process (16Eason M.G. Moreira S.P. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4681-4688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18Jewell-Motz, E. A., and Liggett, S. B.

Chem. 2000; 275: 28989-28993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For the α2AAR, we have shown that four serines in the third intracellular loop are phosphorylated after agonist exposure (16Eason M.G. Moreira S.P. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4681-4688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Removal of serines by alanine substitution mutagenesis results in a proportional decrease in phosphorylation. Such partial phosphorylation (compared with wild type), however, was found to be insufficient to cause any detectable desensitization. In a previous study of the α2BAR, we deleted and substituted the entire aforementioned acidic region (18Jewell-Motz, E. A., and Liggett, S. B. (1953) (1995)Biochemistry34, 11946–1Google Scholar). Agonist-promoted phosphorylation was reduced by ∼50% in this mutant, and desensitization was ablated. These results are entirely consistent with the current work, where a restricted deletion resulted in a decrease in phosphorylation and a complete loss of desensitization. Finally, we have also recently shown that a chimeric α2A/α2CAR, which undergoes agonist-promoted phosphorylation, fails to exhibit desensitization (24Jewell-Motz E.A. Small K.M. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28989-28993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Taken together with our current work, these results indicate that the conformation of the third loop evoked by GRK mediated phosphorylation which provides for the binding of arrestins (which is the ultimate step that imparts uncoupling) is highly specific. Thus, a precise phosphorylation-dependent conformation is apparently required for arrestin binding to α2AR and subsequent functional desensitization. Perturbations of the milieu can thus have significant functional consequences, as occurs with the Del301–303 polymorphic α2BAR. Thus, the major signaling phenotype of the α2BAR Del301–303 polymorphism is one of decreased agonist-promoted phosphorylation that results in a complete loss of the ability for the receptor to undergo agonist-promoted desensitization. In addition, the polymorphism imposes a small decrease in receptor coupling. The potential physiologic consequences of the polymorphism could be related to either or both of the above phenotypes. A receptor that fails to undergo desensitization would be manifested as static signaling despite continued activation of the receptor by endogenous or exogenous agonist. Such a lack of regulation by agonist may perturb the dynamic relationship between incoming signals and receptor responsiveness that maintains homeostasis under normal or pathologic conditions. Recently, Gavras and colleagues (14Makaritsis K.P. Handy D.E. Johns C. Kobilka B. Gavras I. Gavras H. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 14-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) have shown that α2B −/+ mice fail to display a hypertensive response to salt loading after subtotal nephrectomy. Thus, a polymorphic α2BAR that fails to desensitize (i.e. does not display regulatable function) may predispose to salt-sensitive hypertension. Regarding the therapeutic response to α2AR agonists, the phenotype of the Del301–303 receptor indicates that individuals with this polymorphism would display little tachyphylaxis to continued administration of agonists. In addition, the initial response to agonist might also be reduced based on the somewhat depressed coupling of the Del301–303 receptor. Until recently, it has been difficult to differentiate α2BAR function from the other two subtypes in physiologic studies. With the development of knockout mice lacking each α2AR subtype (5Hein L. Limbird L.E. Eglen R.M. Kobilka B.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 881: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 6Rohrer D.K. Kobilka B.K. Physiol.

Science. 1996; 273: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), certain functions can now be definitively attributed to specific subtypes. Characterization of the α2BAR knockout mouse has indicated that the α2BAR subtype is expressed on vascular smooth muscle and is responsible for the hypertensive response to α2AR agonists (13Link R.E. Desai K. Hein L. Stevens M.E. Chruscinski A. Bernstein D. Barsh G.S. Kobilka B.K. Science. 1996; 273: 803-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). This indicates that vascular α2BAR contribute to overall vascular tone and thus participate in systemic blood pressure regulation. This role may be more important, however, during adaptive conditions, such as salt loading, because resting blood pressure is normal in the heterozygous α2B −/+ mice (14Makaritsis K.P. Handy D.E. Johns C. Kobilka B. Gavras I. Gavras H. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 14-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Whether the α2B −/− mice have altered resting blood pressures has not been studied in detail because of high perinatal lethality of the homozygous knockout (13Link R.E. Desai K. Hein L. Stevens M.E. Chruscinski A. Bernstein D. Barsh G.S. Kobilka B.K. Science. 1996; 273: 803-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). However, neither the region of chromosome 2 near the α2BAR coding sequence nor the deletion polymorphism has been linked or associated with hypertension (21Heinonen P. Koulu M. Pesonen U. Karvonen M.K. Rissanen A. Laakso M. Valve R. Uusitupa M. Scheinin M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 2429-2433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Baldwin C.T. Schwartz F. Baima J. Burzstyn M.

However, no studies have assessed whether the polymorphism is associated with salt-sensitive hypertension or other phenotypes, or the response to α2AR agonist. In summary, we have delineated the signaling phenotype of a polymorphism of the α2BAR that results in a deletion of three glutamic acids in the third intracellular loop of the receptor. The polymorphism is prevalent in the human population, with a frequency that is ∼2-fold greater in Caucasians as compared with African-Americans. The polymorphic receptor displays wild-type agonist binding affinity but a small decrease in function in the resting state. However, the major phenotype is a significant decrease in agonist-promoted phosphorylation by GRKs, which results in a receptor that fails to display agonist-promoted desensitization. To our knowledge this is the first polymorphism of any G protein-coupled receptor to affect GRK-mediated phosphorylation. We thank Esther Getz for manuscript preparation."
https://openalex.org/W1963906952,"A recent hypothesis suggests that neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) and the parietal reach region (PRR) encode movement plans in a common eye-centered reference frame. To test this hypothesis further, we examined how PRR neurons encode reach plans to auditory stimuli. We found that PRR activity was affected by eye and initial hand position. Population analyses, however, indicated that PRR neurons were affected more strongly by eye position than by initial hand position. These eye position effects were appropriate to maintain coding in eye coordinates. Indeed, a significant population of PRR neurons encoded reaches to auditory stimuli in an eye-centered reference frame. These results extend the hypothesis that, regardless of the modality of the sensory input or the eventual action, PRR and LIP neurons represent movement plans in a common, eye-centered representation."

This adaptive process obeys anti-Hebbian rules and appears to be mediated by associative depression at the synapses between parallel fibers and Purkinje-like cells of ELL. We show here that there is also a nonassociative potentiation at this synapse that depends only on the repeated occurrence of the EPSP. The depression can be reversed by the potentiation and vice versa. Finally, we show that the associative depression requires NMDA receptor activation, changes in postsynaptic calcium, and the occurrence of a postsynaptic dendritic spike within a few milliseconds following EPSP onset."
https://openalex.org/W2014764993,"The recent findings of sphingolipids as potential mediators of yeast heat stress responses led us to investigate their possible role in the heat-induced cell cycle arrest and subsequent recovery. The sphingolipid-deficient yeast strain 7R4 was found to lack the cell cycle arrest seen in the isogenic wild type. Furthermore, strain lcb1-100, which harbors a temperature-sensitive serine palmitoyltransferase, lacked increased de novogenerated sphingoid bases upon heat stress. Importantly, this strain was found to lack the transient heat-induced G0/G1 arrest. These results indicate a role for sphingolipids and specifically those generated in the de novo pathway in the cell cycle arrest response to heat. To determine the bioactive sphingolipid regulating this response, an analysis of key mutants in the sphingolipid biosynthetic and degradation pathways was performed. Strains deleted in sphingoid base kinases, sphingoid phosphate phosphatase, lyase, or dihydrosphingosine hydroxylase were found to display the cell cycle arrest. Also, the knockout of a fatty acyl elongation enzyme, which severely attenuates ceramide production, displayed the arrest. These experiments suggested that the active species for cell cycle arrest were the sphingoid bases. In further support of these findings, exogenous phytosphingosine (10 μm) was found to induce transient arrest. Stearylamine did not induce an arrest, demonstrating chemical specificity, andl-erythro- was not as potent asd-erythro-dihydrosphingosine showing stereospecificity. To investigate a possible arrest mechanism, we studied the hyperstable Cln3 (Cln3–1) strain LDW6A that has been previously shown to be resistant to heat stress-induced cell cycle arrest. The strain containing Cln3–1 was found to be resistant to cell cycle arrest induced by exogenous phytosphingosine, indicating that Cln3 acts downstream of the sphingoid bases in this response. Interestingly, cell cycle recovery from the transient arrest was found to be dependent upon the sphingoid base kinases (LCB4,LCB5). Overall, this combination of genetic and pharmacologic results demonstrates a role for de novosphingoid base biosynthesis by serine palmitoyltransferase in the transient G0/G1 arrest mediated through Cln3 via a novel mechanism.

Holland M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15019-15072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Miller M.J. Xuong N.H. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5222-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which involves two phases. The initial phase is the gaining of thermotolerance through an accumulation of trehalose (3Wiemken A. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 1990; 58: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), an induction of the heat shock proteins (4Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar), and a transient arrest of the cells in the G0/G1phase of the cell cycle (5Shin D.Y. Matsumoto K. Iida H. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The transient cell cycle arrest is characterized as a decrease in budding after 1 h of heat stress (6Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 178: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The decrease in budding has been shown to be blocked by expression of a hyperstable Cln3, indicating a role for G1 cyclins in this response (7Rowley A. Johnston G.C. Butler B. Werner-Washburne M. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1034-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, G1 cyclins are regulators of entry into S phase at the point known as START, and, upon heat stress, transcript levels of Cln1 and Cln2 are decreased (7Rowley A. Johnston G.C. Butler B. Werner-Washburne M. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1034-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A decrease in available G1 cyclins induces a G0/G1 arrest. After thermotolerance has been achieved, the second phase of the heat stress response is characterized by a resumption of normal growth at the elevated temperature. This phase is marked by a HSP-70-dependent process of trehalose degradation (8Hottiger T. De Virgilio C. Bell W. Boller T. Wiemken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and resumption of a normal cell cycle as seen by a recovery of budding by 2 h of heat stress (6Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 178: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The mechanisms involved in regulating the cell cycle response to heat are not yet defined. Examination of suppressor mutants of the lethal deletion of serine palmitoyltransferase subunit (LCB1) has begun to shed light on the roles of sphingolipids in the yeast heat stress response (9Jenkins G.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7235-7243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The suppressor makes novel inositol glycerolipids that mimic the inositol phosphoceramides, thus allowing for growth under normal conditions (12Dickson R.C. Wells G.B. Schmidt A. Lester R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2176-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Lester R.L. Wells G.B. Oxford G. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 845-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, under heat stress and other stress conditions, the suppressor mutants were found to be defective in growth as compared with the isogenic wild type yeast strain (14Patton J.L. Srinivasan B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7180-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, the study of these mutants resulted in the finding that sphingolipids are necessary for the yeast heat stress response (9Jenkins G.M. Richards A. Wahl T. Mao C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32566-32572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 11Wells G.B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7235-7243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The induction of de novo synthesis of free sphingoid bases and yeast ceramides upon heat stress have suggested a role for these lipids as possible signaling moieties. Already, two such functions have been attributed to sphingolipids in the yeast heat stress response. First, addition of exogenous sphingolipids was shown to induce a reporter gene attached to a stress response element (10Dickson R.C. Nagiec E.E. Skrzypek M. Tillman P. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30196-30200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Second, it was shown that sphingoid bases mediate a ubiquitin-dependent degradation of nutrient permeases in response to heat stress (15Chung N. Jenkins G. Hannun Y.A. Heitman J. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17229-17232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The current study examines the role of sphingolipids in the heat-induced transient cell cycle arrest. An initial role for sphingolipids was disclosed by experiments on the sphingolipid deficient strain 7R4. Also, the temperature-sensitive serine palmitoyltransferase strain lcb1-100 was found to be defective in the transient cell cycle arrest, indicating a requirement for de novo generated sphingolipids in this effect. The role of specific sphingolipids in the cell cycle arrest was investigated using knockouts of sphingolipid enzymes, and these results implicate the free sphingoid bases as the bioactive species. A yeast strain containing the hyperstable Cln3–1 showed this cyclin to act downstream of the sphingoid base-induced arrest. Finally, a role of the sphingoid base kinases in cell cycle recovery was determined, and is suggested to likely be through clearance of the sphingoid bases rather than the formation of the phosphorylated sphingoid bases per se. These data show that de novo synthesis of sphingoid base is involved in the transient cell cycle arrest likely through Cln3 and that recovery from the cell cycle arrest is partially mediated by the sphingoid base kinases. d-erythro-Sphingosine, phytosphingosine, RNase, proteinase K, and stearylamine were obtained from Sigma.

Cells were rested for 6 h to allow for growth to mid log phase and then grown at 30 or 39 °C. At the given time points, cells were pelleted at 4 °C and resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold water. The resuspended cells were then put on microscope slides and imaged. Representative fields were photographed at 100× magnification, and photographs were subsequently scored for budding. Protein was extracted from a 5-ml mid log phase culture. The cells were pelleted, washed in ice-cold water, and repelleted. Cells were then resuspended in ∼0.5 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and a 5 μg/ml concentration of chymotrypsin, leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin). Glass beads were added and cells lysed by ten cycles of vortexing for 30 s. Beads and large cellular debris were pelleted, and the supernatant was recovered. An aliquot was used for the Bio-Rad Bradford protein determination with bovine serum albumin as standard. Serine palmitoyltransferase activity of the protein samples was measured under the following conditions. The reaction buffer consisted of 0.1 m HEPES, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EDTA (pH7.4), 50 μmpyridoxal 5′-phosphate, 0.2 mm palmitoyl-CoA, 5 mm serine, and 200 μg of protein. The reaction was started with the addition of tritiated palmitoyl-CoA (with 0.2 mm cold as carrier) and run for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped with 1.5 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:2, v/v). Dihydrosphingosine (50 μg) was added as carrier. To induce the phase break, 1 ml of chloroform and 1 ml of 0.5 n ammonia hydroxide were added and the solution was vortexed. The aqueous phase was discarded, and the organic phase was dried down. The organic extract was then resuspended in chloroform, spotted on a plate for thin layer chromatography (TLC), and developed in a solvent system of chloroform:methanol:2 n ammonia hydroxide (40:10:1, v/v). The plate was then sprayed with EnHance and exposed to film. The spot comigrating with keto-dihydrosphingosine was scraped and counted. A blank of no protein was extracted as background. Two milliliters of YEPD media was seeded with 5 × 106 cells/ml and rested for 2 h. Tritiated palmitate (1 μCi/ml) was added, and the cells were incubated for 6 h. Cells were pelleted, washed with water, and extracted as described (17Mandala S.M. Thornton R.A. Frommer B.R. Curotto J.E. Rozdilsky W. Kurtz M.B. Giacobbe R.A. Bills G.F. Cabello M.A. Martin I. Pelaez F. Harris G.M. J Antibiot (Tokyo). 1995; 48: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The lipids were dried down and base-hydrolyzed as described previously (18Mao C. Wadleigh M.

The resulting lipids were dried down and resuspended in 75 μl of chloroform:methanol:water (1:2:0.1, v/v) and spotted onto a TLC. The TLC plate was developed in a solvent system of chloroform:methanol:4.2 n ammonia hydroxide (9:7:2, v/v). Results were imaged by spraying with ENHANCE and exposing to film for 3 days. A total of 2 × 109 cells were taken from an overnight YEPD culture. Extraction was done as described previously via a modified Bligh and Dyer extraction (9Jenkins G.M. Richards A. Wahl T. Mao C.

Lipids were then dried down, and two-thirds were used for sphingoid measurement with the other one-third used for organic phosphate measurement. The lipids for sphingoid base measurements were derivatized withortho-phthaldialdehyde and separated over a reverse phase C18 column with detection by a Shimadzu fluorescent detector essentially as described (20Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Jamison W.C. Nimkar S. Liotta D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Samples were compared by use of the nonendogenous sphingoid basel-threo-dihydrosphingosine as an internal standard added before the lipid extraction. Yeast cells were seeded at 5 × 105 to 2 × 106 cells/ml in YEPD media and rested 6–8 h at 30 °C. Yeast cells were then treated under the given conditions of temperature and or lipid treatment. At the given time points a control and treated sample were taken and centrifuged. The cell pellet was washed twice with ice cold water and then fixed in 1 ml of 70% ethanol, all at 4 °C. After fixing overnight, the cells were again pelleted, washed with 5 ml of 50 mm sodium citrate, and then resuspended in 1 ml of sodium citrate. RNase was then added and incubated for 1 h at 50 °C, and then proteinase K was added and incubated under the same conditions. Finally, 0.85 ml of sodium citrate and 0.15 ml of propidium iodide solutions were added. Cells were kept 24 or more h in the dark at 4 °C. Cells (15,000) were analyzed per histogram using a Becton Dickinson fluorescence-activated cell analyzer. Data were modeled using the program ModFit LT. The role of sphingolipids in the heat-induced transient cell cycle arrest was investigated in the sphingolipid-deficient strain, 7R4, and its isogenic wild type 7R4-LCB1. Strain 7R4-LCB1 showed the expected arrest at 1 h for 39 °C as evaluated by budding (Fig. 1 A). Budded 7R4-LCB1 cells decreased from 66% in the asynchronous samples to 24% at 1 h of heat stress and recovered to 62% budded by 2 h of heat stress. In contrast, the sphingolipid-deficient strain 7R4 did not arrest. Strain 7R4 had 58% budded cells in an asynchronous culture and upon 1 h at 39 °C maintained 60% budded cells, with 55% of cells still budded at 2 h (Fig. 1 B). Because the only difference between these two strains is the presence or absence of sphingolipids, these results show that lack of sphingolipids results in an inability to transiently arrest upon heat stress. To investigate the role ofde novo sphingolipid synthesis in the heat-induced arrest, strain lcb1-100 was characterized in terms of serine palmitoyltransferase activity, production of sphingolipids at 30 °C, and increased de novo synthesis of sphingoid bases upon heat stress. This temperature-sensitive strain, lcb1-100, was isolated as a secretory mutant (end8-1) containing a point mutation in theLCB1 gene (21Sutterlin C. Doering T.L. Schimmoller F. Schroder S. Riezman H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2703-2714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is a necessary component of serine palmitoyltransferase (22Pinto W.J. Wells G.W. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2575-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins from the strains lcb1-100, RH406, 7R4-LCB1, and 7R4 were extracted to compare the in vitro serine palmitoyltransferase activity. Protein extract from strain 7R4-LCB1 produced 2.88 nmol of keto-dihydrosphingosine per milligram of protein, and protein extract from strain RH406 produced 1.52 nmol of keto-dihydrosphingosine per milligram of protein (Fig.2 A). Protein extract from theLCB1 deletion strain 7R4 showed minimal activity (0.064 nmol/mg of protein), as did the lcb1-100 (0.082 nmol/mg of protein) protein extract (Fig. 2 A). Thus, protein extracted from lcb1-100 had minimal in vitro serine palmitoyltransferase activity compared with the wild type protein extracts. To determine ifin vitro inactivity of serine palmitoyltransferase from lcb1-100 affected the steady-state sphingolipid synthesis in vivo, we labeled both wild type and the lcb1-100 strains with tritiated palmitate for 6 h at 30 °C. Palmitate is converted to palmitoyl-CoA by the cells and then condensed with serine, by serine palmitoyltransferase, to form keto-dihydrosphingosine (Fig. 4). Keto-dihydrosphingosine is then further metabolized to the complex sphingolipids. The base-hydrolyzed organic extract of strain lcb1-100 had labeled bands corresponding to sphingoid bases and complex sphingolipids comparable to the levels seen in the RH406 extract (Fig. 2 B). Bands corresponding to dihydrosphingosine, phytosphingosine, inositol phosphoceramide, mannose inositol phosphoceramide, and mannose (inositol-phosphate)2 ceramide were present in both extracts (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, high pressure liquid chromatographic analysis of Bligh and Dyer extracts of the lcb1-100 strain were found to contain normal levels of the expected four species of sphingoid bases found in yeast (data not shown). Therefore, despite minimal in vitro enzyme activity, lcb1-100 was found able to produce sphingolipid levels comparable to those of the isogenic wild type at 30 °C. These results suggest that the point mutation in LCB1 renders the enzyme activity labile in cell extracts but normal function is maintained in vivo.Figure 4Representation of sphingolipid biosynthesis and breakdown in S. cerevisiae.

Therefore, the increased production of sphingoid bases upon heat stress was examined in the wild type yeast strain RH406 (Fig. 2 C) and heat-sensitive serine palmitoyltransferase strain lcb1-100 (Fig. 2 D). Lipid extracts from RH406 showed increases in C18 phytosphingosine (252%), C20 phytosphingosine (435%), C18 dihydrosphingosine (238%), and C20 dihydrosphingosine (289%) by 15 min at 39 °C. In contrast the lcb1-100 strain lipid extracts showed no increases in any of the four measured sphingoid bases (Fig. 2 D). Therefore, lcb1-100 yeast cells have normal steady-state levels of sphingolipids, but were unable to produce an increase of the sphingoid bases upon heat stress. Next strains lcb1-100 and RH406 were evaluated for the transient cell cycle arrest by both budding and cell cycle analysis. The RH406 cells showed a large arrest at 1 h of heat stress with only 24% of the cells budded compared with 64% of cells budded in the asynchronous culture. The cell cycle analysis of RH406 showed large G0/G1 and G2/M peaks with an intervening S phase area (Fig. 3) and some post G2/M cells. The cell cycle plot showed a significant loss of S phase area at the 1 h of 39 °C time point corresponding to the loss in budding. Therefore, the transient G0/G1 arrest seen at 1 h of heat stress by budding appeared as a loss of S phase area in the cell cycle analysis. In contrast to the RH406 budding loss, the percentage of budded lcb1-100 cells did not change with 1 h (67%) of heat stress as compared with asynchronous cells at 30 °C (67%). The cell cycle of lcb1-100 displayed a pre-G0/G1 peak of debris and then peaks for G0/G1 and G2/M with an intervening S phase area. The asynchronous cell cycle profile of lcb1-100 was maintained (Fig. 3) at 1 h of heat stress, corresponding to the lack of change in the percentage of budded cells. These data demonstrate a necessary role for the de novoinduction of sphingolipids via serine palmitoyltransferase activity in the heat-induced transient G0/G1 arrest. The recent cloning of many of the genes involved in the sphingolipid synthesis and breakdown pathways (Fig.4) now allows for the analysis of bioactive species by utilizing key mutants in these pathways. Production of sphingoid base phosphates has been shown to occur mainly through Lcb4 and minimally through Lcb5 (23Nagiec M.M. Skrzypek M. Nagiec E.E. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19437-19442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). TableII shows that each of these knockouts arrested and recovered upon heat stress as measured by the percentage of S phase. Moreover, the double-knockout of both LCB4 andLCB5 also arrested (S phase not detectable). However, the double deletion of LCB4 and LCB5 did not recover by 2 h of heat stress as shown by no detectable cells in the S phase area. The isogenic wild type strain JK93d showed no detectable cells S phase area at 1 h of 39 °C and recovered to 34% S phase by 2 h of 39 °C. These data show that the two sphingoid base kinases are not required for the transient arrest but are required for the recovery phase.Table IIHeat-induced transient cell cycle arrest analysis of sphingolipid mutantsStrain% S PhaseASY1 h 39 °C2 h 39 °CRH40615.730.0020.79Lcb1–10028.2922.7718.487R4-LCB129.380.2417.527R40.000.000.00JK93d26.730.0034.12Δlcb423.682.1928.63Δlcb520.682.0327.56Δlcb4, Δlcb523.620.000.06Δdpl119.364.1013.71Δelo224.990.2838.67Δysr223.102.0133.36W30323.400.1213.03Δsyr226.561.9013.03Log phase 7R4-LCB1 cells were fixed, stained with propidium iodide, and run on flow cytometry.

Data were analyzed by ModFit LT and the percentage of heat-stressed S phase at the given time points presented as compared to asynchronous (ASY) S phase. Ceramide production has been found to be greatly decreased in theELO2 deletion mutant, probably as a result of a deficiency in the very long chain fatty acids that are normally acylated at the amino group of the sphingoid bases (24Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The knockout ofELO2 was arrested (S phase not detectable) and recovered (38%) as well as the isogenic wild type JK93d. Therefore, ceramide production is not likely to play a role in the transient arrest induced at 39 °C. Also tested were the knockout of YSR2, a sphingoid base phosphate phosphatase (18Mao C.

First, it provides evidence for a secondary endosymbiotic event in apicomplexa whereby their common ancestor engulfed an algal organism, giving rise to the organelle's four membranes visible by electron microscopy (for review, see Ref. 3Roos D.S. Crawford M.J. Donald R.G. Kissinger J.C. Klimczak L.J. Striepen B. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis of apicoplast-encoded genes supports this hypothesis (5Kohler S. Delwiche C.F. Denny P.W. Tilney L.G. Webster P. Wilson R.J. Palmer J.D. Roos D.S. Science. 1997; 275: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Second, the plastid-like organelle offers a new and promising target for rational drug design, because it is assumed to contain a number of unique metabolic pathways not found in the mammalian hosts (7McFadden G.I. Roos D.S. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 328-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Recent reports have shown that at least the rationale of this approach is valid and that new drugs, which are urgently needed, especially for plasmodial infections, might be developed in the near future based on these targets (7McFadden G.I. Roos D.S. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 328-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 8Jomaa H. Wiesner J. Sanderbrand S. Altincicek B. Weidemeyer C. Hintz M. Turbachova I.

Science. 1999; 285: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar).The proteins encoded by the fully sequenced Plasmodium falciparum and T. gondii plastid genomes are either ribosomal proteins or proteins involved in the replication of the episomal genome (3Roos D.S.

Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), but are not sufficient to constitute the whole organelle and to provide insights into its experimentally proven essential function (9Fichera M.E. Roos D.S. Nature. 1997; 390: 407-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, obvious that nuclear-encoded genes must exist that code for apicoplast localized proteins, similar to the situation of chloroplasts and plants (10Martin W. Stoebe B. Goremykin V. Hansmann S. Hasegawa M. Kowallik K.V. Nature. 1998; 393: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar).In search for such proteins we describe in this report the cloning and functional expression of nuclear-encoded, but apicoplast-localized, ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR)1 from T. gondii and ferredoxin (Fd) from P. falciparum. This cellular redox system has been extensively studied for decades in photosynthetic organisms (11Carrillo N. Vallejos R.H. Barber J. The Light Reactions. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1987: 527-560Google Scholar) and is responsible for the electron transfer from photosystem I to NADP+ for the provision of reducing equivalents needed in the Calvin cycle for CO2fixation according to the following reaction: 2Fdred + NADP+ + H+ → 2Fdox + NADPH.In this reaction the small [2Fe-2S] protein ferredoxin donates its electron to the FAD cofactor of FNR, which pairs two electrons for the subsequent reduction of FNR-bound NADP+ to NADPH (11Carrillo N. Vallejos R.H. Barber J. The Light Reactions. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1987: 527-560Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of this redox pair in nonphotosynthetic apicomplexan parasites was unexpected at first. However, besides the light-dependent reaction, electron flow can also take place in the reverse direction in nonphotosynthetic plastids (e.g.from roots) from NADPH to Fd, which then serves as an important reductant for various plastid-localized enzymes like nitrite reductase, sulfite reductase, glutamate synthase, and lipid desaturases (12Knaff D.B. Hirasawa M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1056: 93-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 13Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

These plastids possess related, but distinct, FNR and Fd isoforms for this purpose (15Onda Y. Matsumura T. Kimata-Ariga Y. Sakakibara H. Sugiyama T. Hase T. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1037-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We provide phylogenetic data that imply thatT. gondii FNR and P. falciparum Fd are similar to nonphotosynthetic isoforms and that reduced Fd is the likely biosynthetic product of this interaction.DISCUSSIONWe have presented data that show that apicomplexan parasites possess genes for plant-type FNR as well as for its intimate redox partner, Fd. The rationale for the initial cloning of the gene corresponding to a T. gondii EST with similarity to the C terminus of plant-type FNRs was that in plants this enzyme is found exclusively in plastids. Thus, our assumption was that TgFNR should be localized in the apicoplast. Indeed, both TgFNR and PfFd possess a N-terminal bipartite targeting domain, a prerequisite for transporting a protein to the apicoplast (36Waller R.F. Keeling P.J. Donald R.G. Striepen B. Handman E. Lang-Unnasch N. Cowman A.F. Besra G.S. Roos D.S. McFadden G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12352-12357Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 45Waller R.F. Reed M.B. Cowman A.F.

Both TPS show an overall net positive charge and a high proportion of Ser and Thr. Enrichment for these residues is a consistent finding within plant TPS (46Cline K. Henry R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to T. gondii, the plasmodial proteins examined by Waller et al. (36Waller R.F. Keeling P.J. Donald R.G. Striepen B. Handman E. Lang-Unnasch N. Cowman A.F. Besra G.S. Roos D.S. McFadden G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12352-12357Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) did not show a high content of hydroxylated residues, and a recent study in P. falciparum confirmed that the only two Thr present in the TPS are dispensable for proper targeting of a FabH TPS-GFP fusion to the plastid of this parasite (45Waller R.F. Reed M.B. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1794-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). This contrasts with the Fd TPS, having 16% of Ser (9Fichera M.E. Roos D.S. Nature. 1997; 390: 407-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) and Thr (3Roos D.S. Crawford M.J. Donald R.G. Kissinger J.C. Klimczak L.J. Striepen B. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) residues and 18% of basic aa in its putative 76-aa transit peptide. Thus, despite overall functional similarity, which has been reported to allow experimental swapping of plastid-targeting domains between T. gondii and P. falciparum (3Roos D.S. Crawford M.J. Donald R.G. Kissinger J.C. Klimczak L.J. Striepen B. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), it is possible that “fine tuning” of the targeting or processing requires different physico-chemical properties of the transit peptide for different proteins in the two organisms.In contrast to P. falciparum Fd, which shows no unusual sequence features compared with plant-type Fds, the TgFNR sequence is distinct in several respects compared with all other known FNRs, possibly with functional consequences. The most prominent difference is the large insertion of 31 aa, located immediately N-terminal of the FAD binding site, and the replacement of the positively charged Lys75, which is conserved in all species except T. gondii, the green algal and the root isoforms. Lys75was shown by site-directed mutagenesis to be essential for Fd binding (37Martinez-Julvez M. Medina M. Hurley J.K. Hafezi R. Brodie T.B. Tollin G. Gomez-Moreno C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13604-13613Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereby neutral residues showed a 50–100-fold increase inK d for Fd, and charge reversal led to total loss of Fd binding. It is important to note that all of these studies were done with FNR and Fd isoproteins involved in the photochemical pathway (i.e oxidation of Fd) and that the isoforms from n-ps tissues also do not possess this Lys residue. Only recently has there been interest in the biochemical and structural differences between ps and n-ps FNR isoforms (15Onda Y. Matsumura T. Kimata-Ariga Y. Sakakibara H. Sugiyama T. Hase T. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1037-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 47Aliverti A. Feriola C. Spinola M. Raimondi D. Zanetti G. Finnerty C. Faber R. Karplus P.A. Gishla S. Kroneck P. Macheroux P. Sund H. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1999. R. Weber, Berlin1999: 265-268Google Scholar), and T. gondii, because of its ease of genetic manipulation (16Boothroyd J.C. Black M. Kim K. Pfefferkorn E.R. Seeber F. Sibley L.D. Soldati D. Adolph K. Methods in Molecular Genetics. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995: 3-29Google Scholar), might offer an attractive in vivo system to study the functional consequences of this and other crucial FNR residues by mutational analysis.Although in most computational phylogenetic analyses amino acid insertions or deletions (indels) are ignored, they can, on the other hand, be very informative provided they are flanked by conserved regions, thus ensuring that they are not alignment artifacts (for review, see Ref. 44Gupta R.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1435-1491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assuming that during evolution such “sequence signatures” are introduced only once and are unlikely the result of independent mutational events in already separated lineages, both the 31-aa insertion in TgFNR and the PfFNR-like protein, and the presumed remnants thereof in the green algal and root FNRs, as well as the 3-aa insertion at position 298 (Fig. 1) can be regarded as such sequence signatures, being remnants of a common ancestor. The differences in length for the 31-aa insertion between T. gondii (P. falciparum) and the others (31 versus 4 and 3 aa, respectively) might reflect the shaping of this region over time in the different organisms by adaptations of the enzymes to their physiological roles in the different plastids.Is the phylogenetic clustering of T. gondii, green algal, and root FNRs helpful for inferring the events leading to the diversification of ps and n-ps FNRs? It has been proposed that an ancient duplication event of the FNR gene prior to the separation of algal and plant groups, followed by the subsequent loss of the ps FNR in the algal lineage, led to the observed clustering (33Arakaki A.K. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Assuming that TgFNR is a single copy gene (see Fig. 2), either the ancestor giving rise to the apicoplast was an alga that had already lost its ps FNR gene, or ps FNR gene loss must have occurred twice independently. Both scenarios are possible, as evidence for independent gene loss during transfer of chloroplast genes to the nucleus has been provided (10Martin W. Stoebe B. Goremykin V. Hansmann S. Hasegawa M. Kowallik K.V. Nature. 1998; 393: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), and the debate about the nature of the secondary endosymbiont (red or green alga) giving rise to the apicoplast is still ongoing (3Roos D.S. Crawford M.J. Donald R.G. Kissinger J.C. Klimczak L.J. Striepen B. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,48Blanchard J.L. Hicks J.S. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1999; 46: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this regard cloning of more algal FNRs, especially from red algae for which no sequences are available yet, could be very informative.Plant-type FNRs/Fd are often referred to as the functional homologous of animal adrenodoxin reductases (AdxR) and adrenodoxin (Adx) (33Arakaki A.K. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and can even substitute them in some in vitro assays, albeit much less efficiently (49Jacquot J.P. Suzuki A. Peyre J.B. Peyronnet R. Miginiac-Maslow M. Gadal P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The P. falciparum data bases contain two sequences with significant homology to AdxR and Adx (data not shown). AdxRs are FAD-containing, NADPH-dependent enzymes intimately connected to the mitochondrial cytochrome P450 electron transfer systems and, in mammals, are involved in the biosynthesis of steroid hormones (50Kagawa, N., and Waterman, M. R. (1995) (Ortiz de Montellano, P. R., ed), 2nd Ed, pp. 419–442, Plenum Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Adxs are small Fd-related iron-sulfur proteins functioning as an electron carrier between AdxR and cytochromes P450 (51Grinberg A.V. Hannemann F. Schiffler B. Muller J. Heinemann U. Bernhardt R. Proteins. 2000; 40: 590-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Although the functionality of these two proteins in P. falciparum has still to be determined experimentally, it seems likely that in plants and apicomplexan parasites FNR/Fd and AdxR/Adx fulfill different tasks. This assumption is corroborated by the presence of homologues of both AdxR and Adx in the genome of Arabidopsis and the recent description of a yeast Adx (YAH1) being an essential component of the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster assembling machinery (52Lange H. Kaut A. Kispal G. Lill R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1050-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), implying that AdxR/Adx are vital proteins for all eukaryotes, but whose physiological function is distinct from that of FNR/Fd.Since there is no reason to believe that T. gondii or other apicomplexa have retained photosynthetic functions after acquiring the plastid precursor (3Roos D.S. Crawford M.J. Donald R.G. Kissinger J.C. Klimczak L.J. Striepen B. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and because of the close relationship between TgFNR and n-ps FNRs, it seems reasonable to suggest that the major physiological role of FNR in the apicoplast lies in the provision ofreduced Fd for processes yet to be defined. In this regard it is interesting to note that in addition to PfFd and the PfFNR-like sequence, the Plasmodium genome data bases contain additional sequences corresponding to proteins with functional relations to FNR/Fd: (i) a partial sequence for a Δ9-desaturase, although sequence information from the N terminus is not available yet to determine whether it contains a putative TPS, and Fd (as opposed to NADPH) dependence is hard to infer from sequence data alone (13Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), and (ii) a complete sequence for glutamate synthase (GenBankTM accession number Y17045). However, the encoded protein is clearly of the NADPH-dependent type, characterized by the lack of a 17-aa insertion typical for ferredoxin-dependent isoforms (53Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 617-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and it also contains no obvious TPS (data not shown). At present it is not known if an apicoplast-localized Fd-dependent glutamate synthase exists.In conclusion we have presented data that show that apicomplexa possess a plant-type FNR/Fd redox system with an N-terminal apicoplast-targeting domain. The exact biochemical role of this prototype of a plant electron transport system in protists needs to be determined. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to suggest, based on the presented data, that its main task lies in the provision of reduced Fd, whose most obvious function might be its involvement in fatty acid desaturation by Fd-dependent desaturases (54Schmidt H. Heinz E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9477-9480Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 55Wada H. Schmidt H. Heinz E. Murata N. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 544-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This would certainly be an essential function in the parasite, given the great number of membranes it has to build up and to maintain under different environmental conditions (vacuolar membrane, three-laminar cell membrane, various organellar membranes, plus the four plastid membranes), even considering only the tachyzoite stage. Because of its absence in the host, the apicomplexan FNR/Fd system offers an attractive target for the modeling of specific drugs against these parasites. This goal is facilitated by the already known three-dimensional structures of several plant FNRs and Fds (Ref. 56Bes M.T. Parisini E. Inda L.A. Saraiva L.M. Peleato M.L. Sheldrick G.M.

Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. Karplus P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar and references therein). Apicomplexan parasites are a large phylum of unicellular, obligate intracellular organisms, including such medically important members asPlasmodium spp., the causative agent of malaria (1Trigg P.I. Kondrachine A.V. Sherman I.W. Malaria: Parasite Biology, Pathogenesis and Protection. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 11-22Google Scholar), andToxoplasma gondii, an opportunistic pathogen of immunosuppressed individuals and a common cause of congenital disease (2Wong S.Y. Remington J.S. AIDS. 1993; 7: 299-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The recent description and sequencing of a circular 35-kilobase pair DNA element in several of these parasites, and its localization to a plastid-like organelle (3Roos D.S. Crawford M.J. Donald R.G.

Nature. 1996; 381: 482Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), called the apicoplast, has received great interest for at least two reasons. First, it provides evidence for a secondary endosymbiotic event in apicomplexa whereby their common ancestor engulfed an algal organism, giving rise to the organelle's four membranes visible by electron microscopy (for review, see Ref. 3Roos D.S. Crawford M.J. Donald R.G. Kissinger J.C. Klimczak L.J. Striepen B. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis of apicoplast-encoded genes supports this hypothesis (5Kohler S. Delwiche C.F. Denny P.W. Tilney L.G. Webster P. Wilson R.J. Palmer J.D. Roos D.S. Science. 1997; 275: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Second, the plastid-like organelle offers a new and promising target for rational drug design, because it is assumed to contain a number of unique metabolic pathways not found in the mammalian hosts (7McFadden G.I. Roos D.S. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 328-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Recent reports have shown that at least the rationale of this approach is valid and that new drugs, which are urgently needed, especially for plasmodial infections, might be developed in the near future based on these targets (7McFadden G.I. Roos D.S. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 328-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 8Jomaa H. Wiesner J. Sanderbrand S. Altincicek B. Weidemeyer C. Hintz M. Turbachova I. Eberl M. Zeidler J. Lichtenthaler H.K. Soldati D. Beck E. Science. 1999; 285: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). The proteins encoded by the fully sequenced Plasmodium falciparum and T. gondii plastid genomes are either ribosomal proteins or proteins involved in the replication of the episomal genome (3Roos D.S. Crawford M.J. Donald R.G. Kissinger J.C. Klimczak L.J. Striepen B. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 4Wilson R.J. Williamson D.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), but are not sufficient to constitute the whole organelle and to provide insights into its experimentally proven essential function (9Fichera M.E. Roos D.S. Nature. 1997; 390: 407-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, obvious that nuclear-encoded genes must exist that code for apicoplast localized proteins, similar to the situation of chloroplasts and plants (10Martin W. Stoebe B. Goremykin V. Hansmann S. Hasegawa M. Kowallik K.V. Nature. 1998; 393: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). In search for such proteins we describe in this report the cloning and functional expression of nuclear-encoded, but apicoplast-localized, ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR)1 from T. gondii and ferredoxin (Fd) from P. falciparum. This cellular redox system has been extensively studied for decades in photosynthetic organisms (11Carrillo N. Vallejos R.H. Barber J. The Light Reactions. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1987: 527-560Google Scholar) and is responsible for the electron transfer from photosystem I to NADP+ for the provision of reducing equivalents needed in the Calvin cycle for CO2fixation according to the following reaction: 2Fdred + NADP+ + H+ → 2Fdox + NADPH. In this reaction the small [2Fe-2S] protein ferredoxin donates its electron to the FAD cofactor of FNR, which pairs two electrons for the subsequent reduction of FNR-bound NADP+ to NADPH (11Carrillo N. Vallejos R.H. Barber J. The Light Reactions. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1987: 527-560Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of this redox pair in nonphotosynthetic apicomplexan parasites was unexpected at first. However, besides the light-dependent reaction, electron flow can also take place in the reverse direction in nonphotosynthetic plastids (e.g.from roots) from NADPH to Fd, which then serves as an important reductant for various plastid-localized enzymes like nitrite reductase, sulfite reductase, glutamate synthase, and lipid desaturases (12Knaff D.B. Hirasawa M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1056: 93-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 13Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

These plastids possess related, but distinct, FNR and Fd isoforms for this purpose (15Onda Y. Matsumura T. Kimata-Ariga Y. Sakakibara H. Sugiyama T. Hase T. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1037-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We provide phylogenetic data that imply thatT. gondii FNR and P. falciparum Fd are similar to nonphotosynthetic isoforms and that reduced Fd is the likely biosynthetic product of this interaction. DISCUSSIONWe have presented data that show that apicomplexan parasites possess genes for plant-type FNR as well as for its intimate redox partner, Fd. The rationale for the initial cloning of the gene corresponding to a T. gondii EST with similarity to the C terminus of plant-type FNRs was that in plants this enzyme is found exclusively in plastids. Thus, our assumption was that TgFNR should be localized in the apicoplast. Indeed, both TgFNR and PfFd possess a N-terminal bipartite targeting domain, a prerequisite for transporting a protein to the apicoplast (36Waller R.F. Keeling P.J. Donald R.G. Striepen B. Handman E. Lang-Unnasch N. Cowman A.F. Besra G.S. Roos D.S. McFadden G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12352-12357Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 45Waller R.F. Reed M.B. Cowman A.F.

We investigated the role of a conserved glutamate at the extracellular end of segment 5 (S5) in slow inactivation by mutating it to a cysteine (E418C in Shaker). We could lock the channel in two different conformations by disulfide-linking 418C to two different cysteines, introduced in the Pore-S6 (P-S6) loop. Our results suggest that E418 is normally stabilizing the open conformation of the slow inactivation gate by forming hydrogen bonds with the P-S6 loop. Breaking these bonds allows the P-S6 loop to rotate, which closes the slow inactivation gate. Our results also suggest a mechanism of how the movement of the voltage sensor can induce slow inactivation by destabilizing these bonds."

The inhibitory interneuron, which we have studied in the lateral geniculate nucleus, is important to this process. In addition to axonal outputs, these cells have dendritic terminals that are both presynaptic and postsynaptic. Even with action potentials blocked, activation of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors on these terminals increases their output, whereas activation of metabotropic (M2 muscarinic) but not nicotinic cholinergic receptors decreases their output. These actions can strongly affect retinogeniculate transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1982006408,"The bZip transcription factor Yap1p plays an important role in oxidative stress response and multidrug resistance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have previously demonstrated that the FLR1 gene, encoding a multidrug transporter of the major facilitator superfamily, is a transcriptional target of Yap1p. The FLR1 promoter contains three potential Yap1p response elements (YREs) at positions −148 (YRE1), −167 (YRE2), and −364 (YRE3). To address the function of these YREs, the three sites have been individually mutated and tested in transactivation assays. Our results show that (i) each of the three YREs is functional and important for the optimal transactivation of FLR1 by Yap1p and that (ii) the three YREs are not functionally equivalent, mutation of YRE3 being the most deleterious, followed by YRE2 and YRE1. Simultaneous mutation of the three YREs abolished transactivation of the promoter by Yap1p, demonstrating that the three sites are essential for the regulation of FLR1 by Yap1p. Gel retardation assays confirmed that Yap1p differentially binds to the three YREs (YRE3 > YRE2 > YRE1). We show that the transcription of FLR1 is induced upon cell treatment with the oxidizing agents diamide, diethylmaleate, hydrogen peroxide, and tert-butyl hydroperoxide, the antimitotic drug benomyl, and the alkylating agent methylmethane sulfonate and that this induction is mediated by Yap1p through the three YREs.

It thus appears that the consensus Yap1p response element (YRE) corresponds to the sequence 5′-TT/GAC/GTAA (2Toone W.M. Jones N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).The activity of Yap1p is predominantly regulated at the level of nuclear export. Under unstressed conditions, Yap1p shuttles between the cytosol and the nucleoplasm but is mainly cytosolic. It is actively exported from the nucleus by the exportin Crm1p, which interacts with the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of Yap1p (20Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 15151-15158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This domain contains a leucine-rich nuclear export sequence embedded within three cysteine residues invariably conserved among homologues of the Yap1p family (20Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 21Kuge S. Toda T. Iizuka N. Nomoto A. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 22Yan C.

Removal of the CRD, mutation of the nuclear export sequence or of the cysteines as well as treatment of the cells with oxidative agents such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), diamide (DA), or diethylmaleate (DEM) all disrupt the Crm1p/ nuclear export sequence interaction, resulting in the accumulation of Yap1p in the nucleus and Yap1p-dependent transcriptional activation (20Kuge S.

The CRD is thought to behave as a specialized export signal that is sensitive to the redox state of the cells, the oxidation status of the cysteines affecting the accessibility of the nuclear export sequence to Crm1p, thereby regulating Yap1p activity (21Kuge S. Toda T. Iizuka N. Nomoto A. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 22Yan C. Lee L.H. Davis L.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7416-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).The FLR1 gene (YBR008c) was predicted to code for an integral membrane protein with 12 transmembrane domains belonging to multidrug permease subfamily I (25Nelissen B. De Wachter R. Goffeau A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 113-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that FLR1 overexpression confers resistance to cycloheximide, 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide, and the azole derivative fluconazole, a drug widely used in antifungal therapy (hence FLR1, for fluconazole resistance1) (15Alarco A.M. Balan I. Talibi D. Mainville N. Raymond M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19304-19313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). FLR1 overexpression has also been shown to confer resistance to different toxic compounds including cerulenin, benomyl (BN), methotrexate, and diazaborine (26Oskouian B. Saba J.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 261: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 27Broco N. Tenreiro S. Viegas C.A. Sa-Correia I. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1595-1608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Jungwirth H. Wendler F. Platzer B. Bergler H. Hogenauer G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4809-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), further demonstrating its involvement in MDR. We have also demonstrated that FLR1 is a transcriptional target of Yap1p and that the FLR1 promoter contains three potential YREs, suggesting that the regulation of FLR1 expression by Yap1p could be mediated through these sequences (15Alarco A.M. Balan I. Talibi D. Mainville N. Raymond M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19304-19313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that the three elements are functional, although not equivalent, and important for the optimal transactivation of FLR1 by Yap1p in response to different classes of compounds, including drugs, oxidants, and alkylating agents. We also show that FLR1 overexpression confers resistance to DA, DEM, and menadione (MD) but hypersensitivity to H2O2, indicating that the Flr1p transporter, in addition to its role in MDR, also modulates oxidative stress response in S. cerevisiae.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have investigated the function of three potential YREs identified in the FLR1 promoter by computer-assisted sequence analysis with respect to their ability to mediate FLR1 regulation by Yap1p. Two independent pieces of evidence indicate that these three sequences are functional. First, mutation of any of the three YREs decreases the ability of overexpressed Yap1p to transactivate an FLR1promoter -lacZ fusion (Fig. 2), demonstrating that the three YREs are necessary to mediate optimal induction of FLR1 by Yap1p. Second, the EMSA performed with oligonucleotides overlapping each YRE demonstrates that endogenous as well as overexpressed Yap1p can bind to the three sites (Fig. 3). As simultaneous mutation of the three YREs completely abolishes the induction of the FLR1promoter by overexpressed Yap1p, we conclude that there is no other unidentified YRE in the FLR1 promoter.Our results also demonstrate that the three YREs are not functionally equivalent. Upon transactivation of the FLR1 promoter with overexpressed Yap1p, mutation of YRE3 has the most deleterious effect (90% decrease in transactivation), followed by YRE2 and YRE1 (75 and 40% decreases, respectively) (Fig. 2). Moreover, we show by EMSA that Yap1p, endogenous and overexpressed, binds more efficiently to YRE3 than to YRE2 and then to YRE1 (Figs. 3). These results suggest that the relative importance of the three YREs can potentially be attributed to differences in the binding affinity of Yap1p for each YRE. As previously mentioned, YRE3 matches the 5′-TTA(C/G)TAA sequence, whereas YRE1 and YRE2 correspond to the SV40 activator protein-1 recognition element 5′-TGACTAA shown to be less efficient than the palindromic site in mediating the in vivo activation of a reporter gene by Yap1p (19Fernandes L. Rodrigues-Pousada C. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6982-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). It is also possible that other factors such as the relative position of the YRE within the FLR1promoter, the sequence context of each YRE, or the proximity of binding sites for other regulators also modulate the ability of a YRE to mediate activation of FLR1 by Yap1p. The FLR1promoter contains consensus binding sequences for different transcription factors, including a TATA box at position 35 (5′-TATAAA), a stress response element at position 135 (5′-AGGGG) known to mediate transcriptional induction in response to different stresses, including oxidative stress (44Marchler G. Schuller C. Adam G. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), and a pleiotropic drug response element at position −439 (5′-TGCGCGGA) for binding of the two homologous transcription factors Pdr1p and Pdr3p involved in MDR (27Broco N. Tenreiro S. Viegas C.A. Sa-Correia I. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1595-1608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the functionality of these sequences has yet to be determined. Yap1p has also been shown to collaborate with the transcription factor Skn7p to regulate the expression of different target genes in response to H2O2 (8Morgan B.A. Banks G.R. Toone W.M. Raitt D. Kuge S. Johnston L.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 12Lee J. Spector D. Godon C. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4537-4544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A consensus DNA binding sequence has not been precisely defined for Skn7p; it is thus not possible to predict whether this protein can bind to the FLR1 promoter. Interestingly, we also found that the relative importance of the three YREs varies with the inducer. Induction of the FLR1 promoter by DEM and BN resulted in a relative importance of the three YREs similar to that observed upon YAP1 overexpression (YRE3 > YRE2 > YRE1) (Fig. 4). However, YRE2 was found to be more important than YRE3 for the induction of FLR1 by DA, H2O2, and t-BHP (YRE2 > YRE3 > YRE1), whereas the three YREs were similarly involved in the induction by MMS (YRE3 ≅ YRE2 ≅ YRE1). The molecular basis for these differences is unclear. It is possible that different posttranslational modifications of Yap1p and/or binding to the FLR1 promoter of additional regulatory factors underlie the relative importance of the three YREs in response to specific inducers.Taken together, our results demonstrate that (i) the FLR1promoter contains three functional YREs, (ii) the two types of YRE sequences (5′-TTA(C/G)TAA and 5′-TGACTAA) coexist and function within the same promoter, and (iii) YREs differentially mediate transcriptional induction by Yap1p in response to various inducers. Unlike other Yap1p target genes described so far, the FLR1promoter is the only one found to contain three YREs. The ATR1, YCF1, GSH1, and GLR1promoters contain a single YRE (6Wu A.L. Moye-Rowley W.S.

The TRX2promoter contains two YREs, but it is not known whether both YREs are functional and, if so, whether they are equally important for the transactivation of TRX2 by Yap1p (5Kuge S. Jones N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Interestingly, DNA microarray studies have identified an ORF (YKL071w) regulated by YAP1 and whose promoter is predicted to contain five YREs clustered within 60 base pairs (16DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3686) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to see whether these five YREs are functional and equivalent for the regulation of YKL071w by Yap1p.We show that FLR1 transcription is induced by Yap1p upon treatment of the cells with different oxidizing agents. FLR1transcription was induced by DA, DEM, H2O2, and t-BHP but not by MD, indicating that the induction of FLR1 is specific for certain oxidants. This induction pattern is similar to that reported for TRX2, which is also induced by DA, H2O2, and t-BHP but not by MD (5Kuge S. Jones N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 8Morgan B.A. Banks G.R. Toone W.M. Raitt D. Kuge S. Johnston L.H.

Microbiol. 1995; 16: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), suggesting that the two genes are regulated by similar mechanisms. However, the demonstration that GSH1, conversely to FLR1 and TRX2, can be induced by MD (46Stephen D.W. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) indicates that Yap1p targets are differentially regulated in response to specific oxidants. Again, it is possible that additional transcription factors bind to Yap1p-regulated promoters to confer oxidant-specific induction. Taken together, these results demonstrate that FLR1 belongs to the network of genes controlled by Yap1p in response to oxidative stress and that this network does not only consist of enzymes and molecules with antioxidant properties but also of transporters.It has been recently reported that yeast exposure to MMS results in increased levels of FLR1 transcripts (42Jelinsky S.A. Samson L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1486-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). We show here that this increase occurs at the transcriptional level, is mediated by Yap1p, and requires the three YREs (Fig. 4). The mechanisms by which Yap1p induces transcription in response to MMS are still unknown but appear to somehow differ from those involved in oxidative stress response. Transcriptional activation by Yap1p in response to oxidants has been shown to involve relocalization of Yap1p to the nucleus without affecting the levels of YAP1 expression (5Kuge S. Jones N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 20Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Unlike oxidants, however, MMS exposure increases by ∼6-fold the levels of YAP1 transcripts (42Jelinsky S.A. Samson L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1486-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In addition, we find that YRE1, which plays virtually no role in the activation of FLR1 by oxidants, is important for the induction of FLR1 by MMS (Fig. 4), uncovering further differences in the mechanism of induction by Yap1p in response to oxidants and alkylating agents. Whether MMS also affects the nuclear localization of Yap1p is under investigation.To evaluate the biological consequences of FLR1 induction by oxidants, we have used a panel of isogenic flr1Δ and FLR1 strains overexpressing or not YAP1. These strains have proven useful in addressing the role of Yap1p in the tolerance of cells to a given compound and evaluating the contribution of Flr1p to this tolerance (15Alarco A.M. Balan I. Talibi D. Mainville N. Raymond M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19304-19313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In parallel, we also tested a strain overexpressing the FLR1 ORF under the control of a strong constitutive promoter. Our results show that FLR1overexpression, achieved either from Yap1p overexpression or from the heterologous promoter, confers resistance to DA, MD, and to a lesser extent, DEM (Fig. 5). It had been shown that a yap1 deletion confers hypersensitivity to DA and MD and that YAP1overexpression confers resistance to DA (5Kuge S. Jones N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 45Stephen D.W. Rivers S.L. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), but the targets of Yap1p mediating these phenotypes were not known. The results presented here clearly demonstrate that FLR1 is the major target of Yap1p mediating resistance to both compounds in S. cerevisiae. Moreover, our results also show that YAP1overexpression confers resistance to DEM and that FLR1 is one of the Yap1p targets mediating this resistance. These results constitute, to our knowledge, the first demonstration that a major facilitator behaves as a determinant of resistance to oxidants. Whether Flr1p functions by mediating the direct extracellular transport of these compounds, either unmodified or coupled to glutathione (47Kosower N.S. Kosower E.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 48Zadzinski R. Fortuniak A. Bilinski T. Grey M. Bartosz G. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 44: 747-759PubMed Google Scholar, 49Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), by indirectly regulating the function of other proteins, including transporters, or by introducing changes in the plasma membrane properties affecting cell tolerance to these compounds remains to be elucidated.The ability of DA, DEM, MMS, and BN to induce FLR1transcription was found to correlate with the ability of the Flr1p transporter to protect the cells from the cytotoxic effects of these compounds (Fig. 5 and data not shown) (27Broco N. Tenreiro S. Viegas C.A. Sa-Correia I. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1595-1608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, MD and fluconazole, which both belong to the spectrum of compounds to which Flr1p confers resistance, are unable to induce FLR1transcription, indicating that Flr1p substrates do not necessarily function as transcriptional inducers. Conversely, it has been shown in the case of the MDR transporter P-glycoprotein that compounds that are not substrates can nevertheless induce transcription of the mdr1 gene (50Santoni-Rugiu E. Silverman J.A. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 2255-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that there is no strict correlation between transporter substrates and inducers.Finally, we find that FLR1 overexpression confers hypersensitivity to H2O2 (Fig. 5). This phenotype is not only caused by FLR1 overexpression since deletion of the gene causes the cells to be more tolerant to H2O2, indicating that the endogenous levels of FLR1 are sufficient to sensitize the cells to this compound. Yap1p-mediated tolerance to H2O2 has been attributed to a number of genes, including TRX2,GLR1, and TSA1 (5Kuge S. Jones N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 9Grant C.M. Collinson L.P. Roe J.-H. Dawes I.W. Mol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 4537-4544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that Yap1p-mediated response to H2O2represents the sum of opposing phenotypes (namely H2O2 resistance conferred by TRX2/GLR1/TSA1 and H2O2 hypersensitivity conferred by FLR1) with the contribution of the targets conferring resistance exceeding that of FLR1 such that tolerance is the net result. However, we find that overexpression of YAP1results in H2O2 hypersensitivity, suggesting that, under such conditions resulting in strong FLR1transactivation (Fig. 2), the contribution of FLR1 exceeds that of the other Yap1p targets. This proposition is supported by the finding that YAP1 overexpression in an flr1Δ background results in H2O2 resistance rather than hypersensitivity (Fig. 5 A). Moreover, constitutively active mutants of Yap1p lacking the CRD have also been shown to confer resistance to diamide but hypersensitivity to H2O2, although the same mutants were transcriptionally competent in the presence of either diamide or H2O2 (24Coleman S.T. Epping E.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8302-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Given our results, it is possible that the H2O2 hypersensitivity observed for these mutants results from the transactivation of FLR1. The mechanism by which FLR1 expression sensitizes the cells to H2O2 is not known. However, this phenomenon is not restricted to major facilitators since overexpression of the CDR2 gene, which codes for a transporter of the ATP binding cassette family in Candida albicans, was also found to confer diamide resistance but H2O2hypersensitivity. 2S. Weber, C. Gauthier, A.-M. Alarco, R. Daoud, E. Georges, and M. Raymond, submitted for publication. It remains to be seen if transporter-mediated H2O2hypersensitivity is specific for FLR1 or also extends to other transporters regulated by Yap1p such as YCF1 and ATR1 (13Wemmie J.A. Szczypka M.S.

The local rearrangements that accompany activation and slow inactivation were mapped onto the homologous structure of the KcsA channel and onto models of S4.

Although the role of TorA in the reduction of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) has been clearly established, no direct evidence for TorC involvement has been presented. TorC belongs to the NirT/NapC c-type cytochrome family based on homologies of its N-terminal tetrahemic domain (TorCN) to the cytochromes of this family, but TorC contains a C-terminal extension (TorCC) with an additional heme-binding site.

The reduced form of TorC exhibited visible absorption maxima at 552, 523, and 417 nm.

In agreement with these values, thein vitro reconstitution of electron transfer between TorC, TorCN, or TorCC and TorA showed that only TorC and TorCC were capable of electron transfer to TorA. Surprisingly, interaction studies revealed that only TorC and TorCN strongly bind TorA.

Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), whereas the other, TorYZ, is expressed at a low level (6Gon S. Patte J.C. Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5779-5786Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Each of these systems comprises a periplasmic terminal reductase and a membrane-anchoredc-type cytochrome. The membranous Me2SO reductase, which is constitutively expressed in anaerobiosis, is also capable of TMAO reduction (7Bilous P.T. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1511-1518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). trimethylamineN-oxide trimethylamine polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis The TorCAD system is encoded by the torCAD operon, and its expression is under the control of the TorS/TorR two-component regulatory system, which mediates the response to the presence of TMAO in the medium (8Jourlin C. Ansaldi M. Méjean V. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The torA gene encodes the periplasmic molybdoreductase TorA (5Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. Lepelletier M. Giordano G. Chippaux M. Pascal M.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). According to sequence homologies, TorA belongs to the Me2SO reductase family, a group of periplasmic enzymes that contain a molybdenum cofactor as a single prosthetic group and are capable of utilizing TMAO and/or Me2SO as electron acceptors (9Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). In the past few years, structures have been published for several members of this family (10Schneider F. Lowe J. Huber R. Schindelin H. Kisker C. Knablein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 53-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 11Schindelin H. Kisker C. Hilton J. Rajagopalan K.V. Rees D.C.

Biol. 1998; 284: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). They are organized in four domains surrounding a bismolybdopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactor that is consequently buried in a deep depression of the protein surface. The insertion of the molybdenum cofactor into the TorA apoprotein is a cytoplasmic event (14Santini C.L. Ize B. Chanal A. Muller M. Giordano G. Wu L.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) that probably involves the TorD cytoplasmic chaperone (15Pommier J. Méjean V. Giordano G. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16615-16620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It was previously shown that the first gene of the toroperon, torC, encodes protein TorC, a 46-kDa pentahemicc-type cytochrome (5Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. Lepelletier M. Giordano G. Chippaux M. Pascal M.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 16Iobbi-Nivol C. Crooke H. Griffiths L. Grove J. Hussain H. Pommier J. Méjean V. Cole J.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 119: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). TorC is anchored to the inner membrane by a sequence of about 20 hydrophobic residues, while a globular domain containing five hemes faces the periplasm. Heme binding to the five consensus CXXCH motifs takes place in the periplasm by a mechanism involving the c-type cytochrome maturation machinery encoded by the ccm genes (17Arslan E. Schulz H. Zufferey R. Kunzler P. Thony-Meyer L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 18Ansaldi M. Bordi C. Lepelletier M. Méjean V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). From sequence comparisons, TorC has been included in the NirT/NapC class of membrane-anchored multiheme c-type cytochromes. This family originally was composed of tetrahemic c-type cytochromes of about 20 kDa that were involved in periplasmic nitrite and nitrate reduction (19Berks B.C. Richardson D.J. Reilly A. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 983-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of TorC, which is homologous to NirT and NapC, possesses the four heme binding sites, whereas the C-terminal part, which is present specifically in the Me2SO/TMAO respiratory systems, carries the fifth heme motif (5Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. Lepelletier M. Giordano G. Chippaux M. Pascal M.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Recently, two members of the NirT/NapC family, NapC and the TorC homologue DorC, have been characterized, and the redox potential values determined for the four hemes of NapC and the five hemes of DorC were all negative (20Roldan M.D. Sears H.J.

In TMAO and Me2SO reduction systems, pentahemic cytochromes proved to be essential for the electron transfer and thus appeared to be the intermediate components between the membrane quinone pool and the terminal reductase (6Gon S. Patte J.C. Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5779-5786Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Mouncey N.J. Choudhary M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7617-7624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since it has been shown in E. coli that TMAO reduction involves menaquinones (23Wissenbach U. Ternes D. Unden G. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), TorC should receive the electrons from the menaquinone pool (E′0(menaquinol/menaquinone) = −74 mV) and transfer them to the active site of TorA, where TMAO reduction (E′0(TMAO/TMA) = +130 mV) occurs. Interestingly, a recent genetic study showed that TorC in its unprocessed form is a negative regulator of the torCADoperon (18Ansaldi M. Bordi C. Lepelletier M. Méjean V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Indeed, apo-TorC seems to inhibit the kinase activity of the TMAO sensor TorS by an unknown mechanism. This negative autoregulation probably means that the maturation of TorC is the limiting step for the Tor system biogenesis. This paper provides in vivo and in vitro evidence that the mature form of TorC is directly involved in the electron transfer to the terminal reductase, TorA. We also show that TorC exhibits four negative redox potentials and a positive one corresponding to the fifth heme. The latter group is responsible for the direct electron transfer to the catalytic site of TorA. In addition, TorC binds TorA, and this interaction involves the N-terminal domain of TorC. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work are listed in Table I. To maintain selection for plasmids, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 10 μg/ml. For the biochemical study, cells were grown anaerobically at 37 °C on Luria broth medium (24Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). The concentration of arabinose or glucose, added to the growth medium, is detailed for each experiment under “Results.” The growth kinetics studies were performed as described by Gon et al. (6Gon S.

To synthesize the N-terminal domain of TorC (TorCN, positions 1–194 relative to TorC) that includes the first four heme binding sites of TorC (Fig. 1 B), the corresponding coding sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide C5Hc and a primer that corresponds to a SmaI site followed by a His6 tag coding sequence and the appropriate torC internal sequence. To synthesize the periplasmic C-terminal domain of TorC (TorCC, from position 198 to 390) that contains the fifth heme of TorC (Fig. 1 C), the corresponding torCcoding sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using an oligonucleotide that contains an EcoRI site followed by the TorT signal peptide (18 codons) coding sequence (28Jourlin C. Simon G. Pommier J. Chippaux M. Méjean V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and the appropriate torC sequence and primer Cct. Detailed information on the primer sequences is available on request. The purified polymerase chain reaction products were digested by the appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated into the corresponding cloning sites of the expression vector pBAD24 (27Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar) downstream from the arabinose-inducible PBAD promoter to give pBC, pBCN, and pBCC (TableI). All of the polymerase chain reaction products and the fusion sites were confirmed by sequencing. DNA preparations were carried out with high pure DNA isolation kits from Roche Diagnostics. Transformations were performed according to the method of Chung and Miller (29Chung C.T. Miller R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Plasmids pBC, pBCN, and pBCC were digested with NheI andHindIII, and the resulting DNA fragments encoding the modified His tag TorC proteins were cloned just downstream oftorD, into the compatible sites XbaI andHindIII of plasmid pTorAD (15Pommier J. Méjean V. Giordano G. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16615-16620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), leading to plasmids pTorADC, pTorADCN, and pTorADCC, respectively. The purification of the TMAO reductase (TorA) was performed from the periplasmic fraction of cells DSS401/pEC86. TorA protein enrichment was achieved as follows. The periplasmic fraction of strain DSS401/pEC86, grown anaerobically in the presence of TMAO (30 mm), was prepared by the lysozyme-EDTA procedure (30Osborn M.J. Gander J.E. Parisi E. Carson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3962-3972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and precipitated with ammonium sulfate 60% (w/v). The pellet was resuspended into Tris-HCl 40 mm buffer (pH 7.6) and then loaded on a Mono Q HR 5/5. The TMAO reductase active fractions, obtained from a 50–500 mm NaCl gradient were then dialyzed, pooled, concentrated by 60% (w/v) ammonium sulfate precipitation, and loaded on a Superdex G200 HR 10/30 column. At this stage, the active fractions contained 3 mg of protein, and the purity of the preparation was checked on Coomassie Blue-stained gel. Purification of TorC and TorCN was performed from the membrane fraction of cells MC4100, containing both plasmids pEC86 and either pBC or pBCN, grown anaerobically in the presence of 0.0005% arabinose. Membrane fraction, prepared as described by Silvestro et al. (4Silvestro A. Pommier J. Pascal M.C. Giordano G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 999: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 500 mmNaCl containing 2% Triton X-100. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, the fraction containing the solubilized cytochrome c, TorC or TorCN, was diluted two times with the same buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2 mm imidazole and loaded onto a HiTrapTMchelating Ni2+ column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The proteins were eluted with a step gradient of imidazole from 20 to 500 mm. Both TorC and TorCN cytochromes were eluted with 150 mm imidazole. TorCC, the soluble C-terminal domain of TorC, was purified from the periplasmic fraction of cells MC4100 containing both pEC86 and pBCC grown under anaerobic conditions in the presence of 0.1% arabinose. The periplasm was diluted two times into 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm imidazole, and the purification onto a HiTrapTM chelating Ni2+ column was performed as described for TorC and TorCN. Protein analysis was carried out using 12.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the presence of hemes within TorC and derivatives was revealed by staining the gel for peroxidase activity using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine as described by Thomas et al. (31Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar); then Coomassie Blue staining of total proteins was performed (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated using the technique of Lowry et al. (33Lowry O.L. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 93: 265-273Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Optical difference spectra and redox titration were performed on a Kontron Uvikon 932 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The UV-visible spectra of TorC, TorCN, and TorCC were carried out at 16 °C in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with Triton X-100 0.05%. Optical redox titrations of TorC (5 μm) and TorCC (10 μm) were performed according to Dutton (34Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), and samples were kept at 20 °C under argon atmosphere. The following redox mediators were present at 5 μm: 1,4-benzoquinone (E′0 = +280 mV), DCIP (E′0 = +217 mV), 2,5-dimethyl benzoquinone (E′0 = +180 mV), 1,2-naphtoquinone (E′0 = +145 mV), 1,4-naphtoquinone (E′0 = +60 mV), duroquinone (E′0 = +5 mV), 2-methyl, 1,4-naphtoquinone (E′0 = 0 mV), pyocyanine (E′0 = −34 mV), 2,5-dihydroxybenzoquinone (E′0 = −60 mV), indigocarmine (E′0 = −125 mV) 1,4-dihydroxynaphtoquinone (E′0 = −145 mV), antraquinone 2-sulfonate (E′0 = −225 mV), safranine T (E′0 = −289 mV), and neutral red (E′0 = −325 mV). All potentials quoted are with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode. The absorbance change at 552 nm was plotted against redox potential, and theoretical Nernstian curves were fitted to the data using Sigma Plot. The kinetic assays were achieved using anaerobic cuvettes, typically filled with phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.4), TMAO (50 mm), and either TorCC (10 μm), TorCN (5 μm), or TorC (5 μm) previously reduced by dithionite. Before adding TMAO reductase (350 units·ml−1), the cuvette mixture was flushed with argon (10 min). The oxidation rate of the cytochrome was determined from the absorption band at 552 nm. TorA (5 μm) and either TorC (5 μm), TorCN (5 μm), or TorCC (10 μm) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), Triton X-100 0.05%. The interactions were analyzed by 10 or 12.5% PAGE under native conditions. For identification, the proteins were either stained for heme with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine or were transferred to a HybondTM ECLTM nitrocellulose membrane. The protein complexes were immunodetected with anti-His antibodies (Invitrogen). The ECL-Western blotting system was used as recommended by the supplier (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The BIAcore apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to analyze, in real time, the binding between TorA (M r 94,000) and TorC (M r 46,000), TorCC(M r 23,000), or TorCN(M r 24,500), by using surface plasmon resonance. All experiments were carried out at 25 °C. TorA, in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5), was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore) through amine coupling (3000 resonance units). TorC, TorCN, and TorCC were diluted in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.05% Triton X-100 and injected using a constant flow rate of 10 μl/min. The resulting sensorgrams were evaluated using the biomolecular interaction analysis evaluation software (BIAcore) to calculate the kinetic constants of the complex formation. To establish that the c-type cytochrome TorC is required for electron transfer to the terminal enzyme TorA, we cloned thetorAD genes alone (15Pommier J. Méjean V. Giordano G. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16615-16620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) or together with torCunder the control of the PTAC promoter of the plasmid pJF119. The resulting pTorAD and pTorADC plasmids were introduced into strain LCB504, which is unable to reduce TMAO. Indeed, this strain carries an interposon in the beginning of the first gene of thetorCAD operon and a deletion of the entire dmsABCoperon (6Gon S. Patte J.C. Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5779-5786Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The strains carrying either pJF119 or pTorAD grew very slowly and at the same rate under anaerobic conditions in the presence of TMAO (Fig. 2). In contrast, when plasmid pTorADC was introduced into strain LCB504, the recombinant strain exhibited a significant growth rate in the presence of TMAO (Fig. 2) and produced the characteristic odor of volatile TMA, which results from reduction of TMAO. These results confirmed the hypothesis that TorC is essential for TMAO reduction. The TorC protein belongs to the NapC/NirT family of c-type cytochrome because its tetrahemic N-terminal domain (hereafter called TorCN; Fig. 1 B) is homologous to the NapC protein and contains four heme-binding sites. In addition, TorC contains a C-terminal domain (hereafter called TorCC; Fig. 1 C) with a single heme-binding motif. The C-terminal extension is found exclusively in TorC/DorC systems (35Dos Santos J.P. Iobbi-Nivol C. Couillault C. Giordano G. Méjean V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To determine whether one or both of the two domains are required for the TMAO reduction process, we cloned DNA fragments encoding either one of these domains behind torAD. The resulting plasmids pTorADCN and pTorADCC were introduced into strain LCB504, and the growth rate was monitored. The recombinant strains containing pTorADCN did not grow significantly in the presence of TMAO (Fig.2), and the cells containing pTorADCC grew very slowly only after 36 h of incubation. These results strongly suggest that both domains of the TorC protein are required for the TMAO respiratory process. To study the biochemical characteristics of the TorC protein, we constructed recombinant plasmids that encode either TorC; TorCN, which corresponds to the N-terminal domain of TorC; or TorCC, which corresponds to the second half of the TorC protein (Fig. 1). DNA fragments encoding TorC, TorCN, and TorCC were cloned into the pBAD24 vector, giving rise to plasmids pBC, pBCN, and pBCC with His tags added at the C-terminal extremity of each protein. Moreover, since the heme incorporation occurs in the periplasm, we introduced the TorT signal peptide in front of TorCC to assure its periplasmic localization. Overproduction of mature c-type cytochrome, and especially multiheme c-type cytochromes, is difficult in E. coli, due to the limited capacity for synthesis of thec-type cytochrome of this organism. To overcome this problem, we used a strain containing the plasmid pEC86 that carries thec-type cytochrome maturation ccm genes and thus improves production of c-type cytochromes (17Arslan E. Schulz H. Zufferey R. Kunzler P. Thony-Meyer L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the amount of mature cytochrome produced is rather low even in the presence of this plasmid, and the expression of cytochrome-encoding genes has to be controlled to prevent saturation of the maturation machinery. Accordingly, the TorC genes were cloned into the pBAD24 vector under the control of the PBAD promoter for controlled expression of TorC proteins. Plasmids pBC, pBCN, and pBCC were then introduced into strain MC4100 carrying the compatible plasmid pEC86. TorC and TorCN expression was induced with 0.0005% arabinose because concentrations higher than 0.001% apparently overloaded the heme delivery machinery and led to degraded proteins. Higher levels of the mature TorCC protein were obtained by using 0.1% arabinose, probably because TorCC is a monoheme protein. Heme-staining proteins of 47 and 24 kDa were present in membrane extracts of the strains containing pBC and pBCN, respectively, indicating that TorC and TorCN were matured (data not shown). Since these proteins were exclusively located in the membrane fraction (data not shown), detergent Triton X-100 was used to solubilize them. A 23-kDa heme-staining protein was detected in the periplasmic extract of the strain containing pBCC (data not shown). The detergent-solubilized fractions containing TorC or TorCN or the periplasmic fraction containing TorCC were loaded onto Ni2+ columns, and the His-tagged proteins were eluted from the column at about 150 mm imidazole. Analysis by SDS-PAGE revealed the presence of TorC, TorCN, and TorCC as a single major band on gels stained for heme-dependent peroxidase activity (Fig. 3 A). No otherc-type cytochrome copurified with the proteins and no apparent degradation occurred. The same gels stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 3 B) revealed one major band; moreover, this band cross-reacted with anti-His antibodies in Western blots (data not shown), confirming that His-tagged derivatives of TorC had been purified. The UV-visible spectrum of purified TorC shows a Soret peak at 411 nm in the oxidized state and peaks at 417 (Soret), 523, and 552 nm in the dithionite reduced form (Fig.4 A). These peaks are characteristic of c-type cytochromes and confirm that TorC is a c-type cytochrome as predicted by the presence ofc-type heme binding sites (CXXCH) in the amino acid sequence. TorC was totally reduced by dithionite, but it was only partially reduced by ascorbate (Fig. 4 A). These results indicate that at least one of the TorC hemes exhibits a positive redox potential, whereas the remaining hemes display more negative redox potentials. Similar UV-visible spectra were obtained with membrane extracts from strain DSS401 containing native TorC after reduction with ascorbate or dithionite (Fig. 4 B), indicating that the purified His tag TorC cytochrome has spectral properties similar to those of the unmodified native TorC protein. To determine which domain of TorC contains a positive redox potential center, we carried out UV-visible spectra with the purified TorCN and TorCC domains (Fig. 4, Cand D). Fig. 4 C shows that the hemes of TorCN are totally reduced by dithionite but not by ascorbate. In contrast, Fig. 4 D shows that the unique heme of TorCC is totally reduced by both ascorbate and dithionite. These findings strongly suggest that the fifth heme of TorC has a positive potential, whereas the first four hemes exhibit negative potentials. To define more precisely the heme potentials, a mediated redox potentiometry was carried out on the purified TorC protein. This analysis revealed three distinct redox type centers, one at −177 mV (two hemes), one at −98 mV (two hemes), and one at +114 mV (one heme) (Table II). These potentials are in agreement with the previous spectral evidence for one positi"

https://openalex.org/W2036281081,"The telomerase holoenzyme consists of two essential components, a reverse transcriptase, TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase), and an RNA molecule, TR (telomerase RNA, also known as TERC), that contains the template for the synthesis of new telomeric repeats. Telomerase RNA has been isolated from 32 different vertebrates, and a common secondary structure has been proposed (Chen, J.-L., Blasco, M. A., and Greider, C. W. (2000)Cell 100, 503–514). We have generated 25 mutants in the four conserved structural domains of the mousetelomerase RNA molecule, mTR, and assayed their ability to reconstitute telomerase activity inmTR −/− cells in vivo. We found that the pseudoknot and the CR4/CR5 domains are required for telomerase activity but are not essential for mTR stability in the cell, whereas mutations in the BoxH/ACA and the CR7 domains affect mTR accumulation in the cell. We have also identified mTRmutants that are able to inhibit wild type telomerase in vivo. The telomerase holoenzyme consists of two essential components, a reverse transcriptase, TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase), and an RNA molecule, TR (telomerase RNA, also known as TERC), that contains the template for the synthesis of new telomeric repeats. Telomerase RNA has been isolated from 32 different vertebrates, and a common secondary structure has been proposed (Chen, J.-L., Blasco, M. A., and Greider, C. W. (2000)Cell 100, 503–514). We have generated 25 mutants in the four conserved structural domains of the mousetelomerase RNA molecule, mTR, and assayed their ability to reconstitute telomerase activity inmTR −/− cells in vivo. We found that the pseudoknot and the CR4/CR5 domains are required for telomerase activity but are not essential for mTR stability in the cell, whereas mutations in the BoxH/ACA and the CR7 domains affect mTR accumulation in the cell. We have also identified mTRmutants that are able to inhibit wild type telomerase in vivo. telomerase reverse transcriptase telomerase RNA kilobase pairs polymerase chain reaction Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that synthesizes telomeric repeats onto chromosome ends (2Blackburn E.H.

In vertebrates, telomerase RNAs are longer, from 382 to 559 nucleotides (1Chen J.-L. Blasco M.A. Greider C.W.

Gene (Amst.). 1998; 9: 51-58Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and in yeast, they are 1200–1300 nucleotides in length (20Singer M.S. Gottschling D.E. Science. 1994; 266: 387-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 25McEachern M.J. Blackburn E.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1822-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Several elements of secondary structure have been described both in mammals and in yeasts (26Mitchell J.R. Cheng J. Collins K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 27Roy J. Fulton T.B. Blackburn E.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3286-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In particular, a small nucleolar RNA BoxH/ACA structure has been identified at the 3′ end of mTR and hTR and found to be important for TR stability and processing in vivo (26Mitchell J.R. Cheng J. Collins K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Several structure-function analyses of the full-length human telomeraseRNA, hTR, have been carried out using various in vitro reconstitution assays (28Autexier C. Pruzan R. Funk W. Greider C.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5928-5935Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 29Beattie T.L. Zhou W. Robinson M.O. Harrington L. Curr.

Biol. 1999; 19: 6207-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Importantly, a secondary structure for vertebrate TRs has been recently determined by phylogenetic comparative analysis (1Chen J.-L. Blasco M.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 2000; 100: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In this study it is proposed that all vertebrate telomerase RNAs share four highly conserved structural domains as follows: a pseudoknot domain, a CR4-CR5 domain, a BoxH/ACA domain, and a CR7 domain (1Chen J.-L. Blasco M.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 2000; 100: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Here we address the role of the four conserved domains in vertebrate telomerase RNA by assaying the ability of mTR mutations to reconstitute telomerase activity inmTR −/− cells in vivo(31Blasco M.A. Lee H.-W. Hande P. Samper E. Lansdorp P. DePinho R. Greider C.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar). In contrast to previous studies in mammals, mutantmTRs were expressed under the endogenous mouse telomerase gene promoter in an in vivo reconstitution system. In ourin vivo reconstitution analysis, we find regions of mTR that are important for telomerase activity, RNA accumulation, and processingin vivo, and we map these regions onto the recently proposed secondary structure of vertebrate telomerase RNA (1Chen J.-L. Blasco M.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 2000; 100: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we identified mTR unpaired regions in the template, the pseudoknot and the CR4-CR5 domains, which are potential targets for telomerase inhibition. All mutants were generated using as template a plasmid with 1.9 kb of mouse genomic DNA containing the wild typemTR gene under its own promoter sequences. This plasmid was constructed by digesting a 5-kb EcoRI genomic fragment containing the mTR locus (18Blasco M.A. Funk W.D. Villeponteau B. Greider C.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1267-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) with XbaI andEcoRV and then subcloning the resulting 1.9-kb fragment in a pBluescript SK−. To generate deletion and substitution mutants, we used the Sculptor in vitro mutagenesis system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (32Sayers J.R. Krekel C. Eckstein F. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 592-596PubMed Google Scholar). All mutants were sequenced using an ABI 377 DNA Sequencer and the ABI Prism dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The following oligonucleotides were used for mutagenesis: Δ3-10, 5′GGGTATTTAAGGTCGAGGGCGGCTAGGCCTCGGCACGATTTTCATTAGCTGTGGGTTCTGG3′; Δ23-102, 5′CACCTAACCCTGATTTTCATTAGCGGGCCACCGCGCGTTCCCG3′; Δ106-185, 5′GAAAGTCCAGACCTGCAGCGGCGCCCAGTCCCGTACCCGCCTACAGGCCG3′; Δ199-294, 5′GCCGGGCCGCCCAGTCCCGTCCAGGCCGGGCGAGCGCCGCG3′; Δ328-389, 5′GCGCCGCGAGGACAGGAATGTCACAACCCCCATTCCCGCTG3′; Δ56-73, 5′GGTCTTTTGTTCTCCTCCGCCCGCTGCAGCGGGCCAGGAAAGTCCAG3′; Δ120-143, 5′CCAGACCTGCAGCGGGCCACCGCGCGTTCCGCAGGAGCTCCAGGTTCG3′; Δ154-167, 5′CCTCAAAAACAAACGTCAGCGCAGGAGCTAGCTCCGCGGCGCCGGGCCGCCCAGTCCCG3′; Δ220-241, 5′CCGTACCCGCCTACAGGCCGCGGCCGGCCCTGCCGCCGCGAAGAGCTCGCCTCTGTCAGC3′; Δ254-266, 5′GGGTCTTAGGACTCCGCTGCCGCCGCGAGTCAGCCGCGGGGCGCCGGGGGCTG3′; Δ357-364, 5′GGTCCCCGTGTTCGGTGTCTTACCGGGAAGTGCACCCGGAACTCGGTTC3′; Δ341-345, 5′GGACAGGAATGGAACTGGTCCCCGGGTGTCTTACCTGAGCTGTGG3′; Δ31-3, 5′CCCTGATTTTCATTAGCTGTGGGTCTTTTGTTCTCCGCCCGCTGTTTTTC3′; Δ90-94, 5′GCTGACTTTCCAGCGGGCCAGGAAAGACCTGCAGCGGGCCACCGCGTTCCCGAGCCTC3′; substitution 57-61 U → A, 5′GGTCTTTTGTTCTCCGCCCGCTGAAAAACTCGCTGACTTCCAGCGGGCCAGGAAAGTCC3′; substitution 129-133 A → U, 5′CACCGCGCGTTCCCGAGCCTCTTTTTCAAACGCAGCGCAGGAGCTCC3′; substitution 65-70 GCUGAC → GUCAGC, 5′GGTCTTTTGTTCTCCGCCCCTGTTTTTCTCGTCAGCTTCCAGCGGGCCAGGAAAGTCCAG3′; substitution 139-144 GUCAGC → GCUGAC, 5′-GTTCCCGAGCCTCAAAAACAAACCTGACGCAGGAGCTCCAGGTTC3′; substitution 71-74 UUCC → GGAA, 5′GGTCTTTTGTTCTCCGCCCGCTGTTTTTCTCGCTGACGGAAAGCGGGCCAGGAAAGTCCAG3′; substitution 71-74 + 84-87 UUCC → GGAA + GGAA → UUCC, 5′GTTTTTCTCGCTGACGGAAAGCGGGCCATTCCAGTCCAGACCTG3′; box H mutant A319U/ A321U/A324U, 5′CAGGCCGGGCGAGCGCCGCAAGGTCTGGTATGGAACTGGTCCCCGTG3′; box ACA mutant A392U/A394U, 5′GCACCCGGAACTCGGTTCTCTCTACCCCCATTCCCGCTGGGGAAATGCC3′. To generate the rest of mTR mutants, we used QuikChange, a PCR-based mutagenesis kit provided by Stratagene. The oligonucleotides used to generate each mutant are as follows: Δ172-314, forward, 5′CCAGGTTCGCCGGGAGCTCCGAGGACAGGAATGGAACTGG3′; Δ172-314, reverse, 5′CCAGTTCCATTCCTGTCCTCGGAGCTCCCGGCGAACCTGG3′; substitution 65-72 GCUGACUU → AAGUCAGC, forward, 5′GGTCTTTTGTTCTCCGCCCGCTGTTTTTCTCCGACTGAACCAGCGGGCCAGGAAAGTCCAG3′; substitution 65-72 GCUGACUU → AAGUCAGC, reverse, 5′CTGGACTTTCCTGGCCCGCAGGTTCAGTCGGAGAAAAACAGCGGGCGGAGAACAAAAGACC3′; substitution 136-144 AACGUCAGC → GCUGACGUU, forward, 5′CGTTCCCGAGCCTCAAAAACATTCCAGTCGGCAGGAGCTCCAGGTTCG3′; substitution 136-144 AACGUCAGC → GCUGACGUU, reverse, 5′CGAACCTGGAGCTCCTGCCGACTGGAATGTTTTTGAGGCTCGGGAACG3′. A NotI-XbaI fragment containing a neo cassette was subcloned in the plasmids containing the selected mTR mutants (see Fig. 5) and in the empty vector (pBluescript SK−, see above). Immortal fibroblasts, derived from wild type embryos (31Blasco M.A. Lee H.-W. Hande P. Samper E. Lansdorp P. DePinho R. Greider C.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar), were transfected with 20 μg of each of the constructs by conventional calcium phosphate transfection. After 2 days, 1/100, 1/50, 1/20, and 1/10 dilutions were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and G418 (200 μg/ml). After 2 weeks of selection several stable clones were picked from the 1/100 and 1/50 dilutions and expanded in selective medium. S-100 extracts, TRAP assays, and telomerase activity quantifications were performed as described below. KO3 p23 cells were transfected with 20 μg of each plasmid using a conventional calcium phosphate protocol (31Blasco M.A. Lee H.-W. Hande P. Samper E. Lansdorp P. DePinho R. Greider C.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar). As control for transfection efficiency, cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of a LacZ expression vector (J7Laz). The transfection efficiency of the lacZ gene was measured by absorbance at 420 nm after addition of O-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma). Cells were divided 48 h post-transfection and further cultured overnight. One dish was used for S-100 extracts and the other for RNA preparation, as described below. Forty eight hours after transfection, total RNA was prepared as described (33Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). In the case of the stable transfectants total RNA was prepared from 10-cm dishes after clone amplification as described above. Typically, 30 μg of total RNA was used for Northern blots, except for the control (wild type cells, 10 μg). RNA was separated by electrophoresis on a 6% acrylamide/bisacrylamide (19:1), 7 m urea, TBE 0.6× gel for 2 h at 5 watts. After electrophoresis, RNA was transferred to HybondTM-N+ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were probed with radiolabeled probes against mTR and 5 S RNA. RNA levels were quantified using IQMac version 1.2, and the mean of at least two different experiments was calculated. In all cases, mTR levels in the cell were corrected by the efficiency of transfection of a LacZ plasmid. Final values of mTR abundance in the cell were corrected by transcript size. Finally, as loading control, gels were also probed with the 5 S RNA. S-100 extracts from transient or stable transfectants were prepared as described (31Blasco M.A. Lee H.-W. Hande P. Samper E. Lansdorp P. DePinho R. Greider C.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar). Protein concentration of extracts was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Reconstituted telomerase activity was measured 48 h after transfection in a modified version of the TRAP assay (34Blasco M.A. Rizen M. Greider C.W. Hanahan D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 35Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (6585) Google Scholar). In the case of the stable transfectants, telomerase activity was measured from 10-cm dishes after clone amplification. Telomerase activity levels were quantified using IQMac version 1.2 (the whole telomerase ladder was quantified at the two different concentrations and corrected by dilution, background, and internal control signal). For quantification, films with nonsaturated signals were used. The TRAP results shown in Fig. 3 are for illustrative purposes; some of the films shown are overexposed to allow the visualization of TRAP activity by mutants that are severely affected. The transfection efficiency of the mTR mutants was determined by co-transfecting a plasmid containingLacZ (not shown). In all cases an internal control for PCR efficiency was included in the TRAP assay (TRAPeze kit, Oncor). One hundred μg of total protein from S-100 extracts (see above) were loaded per lane, and Western blots with K-370 antibody were carried out exactly as described in Martı́n-Rivera et al. (10Martı́n-Rivera L. Herrera E. Albar J.P. Blasco M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10471-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). For full characterization of K370 antibody specificity see Martı́n-Rivera et al. (10Martı́n-Rivera L. Herrera E. Albar J.P. Blasco M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10471-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In all vertebrates, four distinct conserved structural domains have been defined for the telomerase RNA molecule as follows: (i) the pseudoknot domain, (ii) the CR4-CR5 domain, (iii) the BoxH/ACA domain, and (iv) the CR7 domain (1Chen J.-L. Blasco M.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 2000; 100: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the conserved secondary structure for vertebrate telomerase RNAs mapped onto themouse telomerase RNA (mTR). Eight regions of base pairing interactions are proposed for mTR (P2–P8), which define the four conserved structural domains. A region of long range base pairing, P1, which is conserved in many vertebrates, is not found in mouse or other rodents (1Chen J.-L. Blasco M.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 2000; 100: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). All 25 mTRmutations were obtained in the context of a genomic construct containing the mTR gene under endogenous promoter sequences shown to be sufficient to direct mTR gene transcription in vivo (18Blasco M.A. Funk W.D. Villeponteau B. Greider C.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1267-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 31Blasco M.A. Lee H.-W. Hande P. Samper E. Lansdorp P. DePinho R. Greider C.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar). The telomerase RNA null cell line KO3 p23, derived from first generationmTR −/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts, was used for in vivo reconstitution of telomerase activity with the mutant mTRs (31Blasco M.A. Lee H.-W. Hande P. Samper E. Lansdorp P. DePinho R. Greider C.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar). To study the effect of the mutations on mTR stability in the cell, we performed Northern blot analysis of total RNA isolated from KO3 p23 cells 48 h after transfection with wild type or mutant mTR constructs (“Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 2,a—c, shows representative Northern blot images of mTR accumulation in the cell 48 h after transfection. InmTR −/− cells transfected with wild type mTR, a full-length mTR transcript stably accumulated, showing the same mobility as the endogenous mTR (Fig. 2,a–c, compare mTR band in wild type andcontrol cells lanes). As expected, when themTR −/− cells were transfected with an empty vector, no mTR-specific signal was detected (see empty vector lane in Fig. 2, a and c). At least 2 to 3 different transfections were carried out for everymTR mutant, and average mutant mTR abundance in the cell was quantified and corrected by transfection efficiency of aLacZ plasmid (see “Experimental Procedures”). Mutant RNA accumulation values relative to that of the transfected wild typemTR are shown in Table I.Table ISummary of stability and activity of the different mTR versionsDomainmTR*RNA accumulation 1-aAverage of 2–3 experiments.Telomerase activity 1-aAverage of 2–3 experiments.%Full lengthWild-type100100PseudoknotΔ23–1029010PseudoknotΔ120–1434510PseudoknotΔ31–3699130PseudoknotΔ56–735115PseudoknotΔ90–9411214Pseudoknot65GCUGAC70–65GUCAGC706020Pseudoknot189GUCAGC144–189GCUGAC1448922Pseudoknot65GCUGAC70–65GUCAGC707781139GUCAGC144–139GCUGAC144Pseudoknot65GCUGACUU72–65AAGUCAGC729830Pseudoknot186AACGUCAGC144–186GCUGACGUU1447515Pseudoknot65GCUGACUU72–65AAGUCAGC7215018186AACGUCAGC144–186GCUGACGUU144Pseudoknot57UUUUU61–57AAAAA619924Pseudoknot129AAAAA188–129UUUUU18811045Pseudoknot57UUUUU61–57AAAAA6111913129AAAAA188–129UUUUU188Pseudoknot CR4-CR5Δ106–1854120Pseudoknot CR4-CR5Δ154–16747100CR4-CR5Δ199–29416UndetectableCR4-CR5Δ220–2416120CR4-CR5Δ254–26685UndetectableCR4-CR5Δ172–31430UndetectableBoxH/AC A-CR7Δ328–389UndetectableUndetectableCR7Δ357–364UndetectableUndetectableBetween BoxH/AC A-CR7Δ341–34570112BoxH/AC ABox HUndetectableUndetectableBoxH/AC ABox ACAUndetectableUndetectable1-a Average of 2–3 experiments. Open table in a new tab mTR deletions Δ23–102, Δ31–36, and Δ90–94 and all 9 mTR substitutions affecting the pseudoknot domain and the pseudoknot interaction accumulated in the cell at the predicted size to similar levels as the transfected wild type mTR (Fig. 2, a—c, and Table I). Mutants Δ120–143 and Δ56–73, which also disrupted the pseudoknot interaction (helix P3), accumulated to 45 and 51% of wild type mTR levels (Fig. 2 a and Table I). A large mTRdeletion (Δ106–185) disrupting conserved helices P3 and P4 in the pseudoknot and BoxA/ACA domains, respectively, reduced mTR accumulation to 41% of wild type levels (Fig. 2 a and Table I). mTR deletion mutant Δ154–167, which reduces the distance between the pseudoknot and the Box/ACA and CR4-CR5 domains, showed 47% of wild type levels (Fig. 2 a and Table I). Interestingly, deletion of several conserved nucleotides of the J6/5 region in mutant Δ254–266 in the CR4-CR5 domain resulted in accumulation of a lower mobility form of mTR (see asteriskin Fig. 2 a), this mutant showed 85% of wild type mTR levels (Fig. 2 a; Table I). The complete sequencing of allmTR constructs rules out a cloning error as responsible for this higher molecular weight mTR (see “Experimental Procedures”). All the other CR4-CR5 mTR mutants accumulated to the predicted size in the cell indicating that the mutated regions do not play a fundamental role in mTR processing. Complete deletion of the CR4-CR5 domain in mutants Δ199–294 and Δ172–314 accumulated to 16 and 30% of wild type levels, respectively (Fig. 2, a-c; Table I). Deletion of nonconserved loop L6 outside the CR4-CR5 domain in mutant Δ220–241 also resulted in stable mTR accumulation (Fig.2 a; Table I). The decreased RNA accumulation of the large deletion mutants in the pseudoknot and CR4-CR5 domains is likely to be due to an altered secondary structure of these mutant mTRs as a consequence of the big size of the deletion; in this regard, none of the point mutations and small deletions in these regions showed decreased accumulation as compared with wild type mTR. Most mutations affecting any of these two domains resulted in undetectable mTR in the cell 48 h after transfection, indicating that they contain essential regions for mTR stability in vivo. In particular, mTR mutants Δ328–389 (BoxH/ACA and CR7) and Δ357–364 (CR7), and both point mutants in the box H and box ACA conserved sequences, resulted in no detectable mTR accumulation in the cell (Fig. 2, a andb; Table I). Interestingly, not all mutations in these domains abolished mTR accumulation; mutants Δ106–185 and Δ172–314 that disrupt helix P4 in the BoxH/ACA domain accumulated at the predicted size and showed 41 and 30% of wild type mTR levels, respectively (Fig. 2, a and c; Table I). Similarly, deletion of four nonconserved J7b/8a unpaired nucleotides between conserved BoxH/ACA and CR7 domains in mutant Δ341–345 resulted in stable accumulation (70% of wild type levels) (Fig.2 a; Table I). These results indicate that the length of the J7b/8a nonconserved hinge region between the two conserved domains as well as helix P4 are not important for mTR stability in vivo. To identify mTR regions important for reconstitution of telomerase activity in vivo, extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection and were tested for telomerase activity using the TRAP assay (see “Experimental Procedures”).mTR −/− cells transiently transfected with wild type mTR showed an efficient reconstitution of telomerase activity in vivo (>50% of the parental wild type cell line activity). This activity was considered 100% telomerase activity reconstitution when compared with the different mTR mutants (see Blasco et al. (31Blasco M.A. Lee H.-W. Hande P. Samper E. Lansdorp P. DePinho R. Greider C.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar) andmTR in Fig. 3,a–e; Table I). No reconstitution of telomerase activity was observed when the cells were transiently transfected with an empty vector (Fig. 3, a and e). To rule out that lack of telomerase reconstitution could be due to absence of mTERT accumulation in the cell, we did Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts from cells transfected with the different mTRversions by using the anti-telomerase-specific antibody K370 (10Martı́n-Rivera L. Herrera E. Albar J.P. Blasco M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10471-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In all cases, except in Box H mutant, similar levels of mTERT protein were detected (Fig. 4). All mutants disrupting the pseudoknot interaction (highly conserved helix P3) affected in vivoreconstitution of telomerase activity. In particular, mutants Δ23–102, Δ56–73, and Δ120–143, all of which disrupt the P3 interaction, showed 10, 15, and 10% of wild type telomerase activity, respectively (Fig. 3, a and b; TableI). In contrast, mutant Δ31–36, which eliminates the unpaired mammalian-specific J2a.1/2a sequence but does not affect the pseudoknot interaction, showed 130% of the wild type mTR telomerase activity (Fig. 3 c), consistent with the fact that the J2a.1/2a sequence is not conserved (1Chen J.-L. Blasco M.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 2000; 100: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Deletion of four unpaired nucleotides in mutant Δ90–94 decreased telomerase activity to 14% (Fig. 3 c; Table I). It has been previously shown in ciliates that the pseudoknot topology rather than the sequence is relevant for telomerase activity (36Gilley D. Blackburn E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6621-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To test whether a similar situation is true for vertebrate telomerase RNA pseudoknot, we generated 9 different substitution mutants. Mutant65GCUGAC70 to65GUCAGC70, which partially disrupted the ability of helix P3 to base pair but did not alter the size of the RNA, showed 20% of the wild type telomerase activity (Fig.3 b; Table I). Mutant 139GUCAGC144 to139GCUGAC144, which partially disrupts helix P3, showed 22% of the wild type activity (Fig. 3 b; TableI). A double substitution mutant 65GCUGAC70 to65GUCAGC70/139GUCAGC144to 139GCUGAC144 which fully restores the base pairing ability in helix P3 showed 81% of the wild type activity (Fig.3 b; Table I). We tried to confirm the above results by constructing new substitution mutants that completely disrupt the P3 helix. Mutant 65GCUGACUU72 to65AAGUCAGC72 showed 30% of the wild type telomerase activity (Fig. 3 e; Table I). Mutant136AACGUCAGC144 to136GCUGACGUU144 showed 15% of the wild type activity (Fig. 3 e; Table I). However, a double substitution mutant 65GCUGACUU72 to65AAGUCAGC72/136AACGUCAGC144to 136GCUGACGUU144 showed 18% of wild type activity (Fig. 3 e; Table I). All together, these results indicate that, in contrast to ciliate pseudoknot, in vertebrate telomerase RNA both pseudoknot topology and sequence are important for reconstitution of telomerase activity. We do not know if the vertebrate pseudoknot interacts with TERT, as has been shown for the ciliate pseudoknot (36Gilley D. Blackburn E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6621-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); however, the fact that some of the mutants in this domain inhibit wild type telomerase activity suggests that it does (see below). Three more mutants in the pseudoknot domain were tested that alter two sequences that are not base-paired in the mTR structure. Mutant57UUUUU61 to 57AAAAA61in the J2b/3 region showed 24% of wild type reconstitution activity, indicating that the identity of these residues is important for wild type reconstitution of telomerase activity in agreement with the fact that these residues are highly conserved in all vertebrates (Fig.3 b; Table I) (1Chen J.-L. Blasco M.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 2000; 100: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Mutant 129AAAAA133to 129UUUUU133, which alters a nonconserved sequence in the J2a/3 region, showed 45% of wild type telomerase activity (Fig. 3 b; Table I). A double substitution mutant57UUUUU61 to57AAAAA61/129AAAAA133to 129UUUUU133 showed 13% of the wild type reconstitution activity (Fig. 3 b; Table I), ruling out an interaction between 57UUUUU61 and129AAAAA133 sequences, as predicted from the mTR structure (1Chen J.-L. Blasco M.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 2000; 100: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Deletion of mTR unpaired regions in mutant Δ154–167 reduces the distance between the pseudoknot domain and the CR4-CR5 and BoxH/ACA domains. This mutant showed 100% of wild type telomerase activity (Table I; Fig. 3 b), indicating that the distance between these structural domains is not essential for reconstitution of telomerase activity, in agreement with the variable length of this region in vertebrate telomerase RNAs (1Chen J.-L. Blasco M.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 2000; 100: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Mutant Δ106–185, which removes J2a/3 sequences and disrupts the P3 helix in the pseudoknot domain, and the P4 helix in the BoxH/ACA domain showed 20% of the wild type mTR telomerase activity (Fig.3 a; Table I). In contrast to pseudoknot domain deletion, full deletion of the CR4-CR5 domain in mutants Δ199–294 and Δ172–314 resulted in complete absence of telomerase reconstitutionin vivo (Fig. 3, a and c), indicating that this domain contains essential regions for in vivoreconstitution of telomerase activity. In particular, deletion of several highly conserved residues in the J6/5 unpaired region of the CR4-CR5 domain in mutant Δ254–266 completely abolished the ability of mTR to reconstitute active telomerase complexes in vivo(Fig. 3, b and c; Table I). Absence of telomerase activity reconstitution by mutant Δ254–266 could be due to the altered mobility shown by this mutant (see above). Deletion of loop L6 outside the CR4-CR5 domain in mutant Δ220–241 reduced telomerase activity to 20% that of wild type (Fig. 3, b andc), indicating that this loop is important but not essential for telomerase activity, in agreement with the fact that is not conserved in vertebrates (1Chen J.-L. Blasco M.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 2000; 100: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Some of the mutations in BoxH/ACA and CR7 domains resulted in no accumulation of mTR in vivo (see above) and should result in the absence of active telomerase complexes in vivo. Deletion mutant Δ328–389, which removes part of the highly conserved BoxH/ACA domain (but not the highly conserved H and ACA boxes) and the CR7 domain, resulted in lack of reconstitution of active telomerase complexes (Fig. 3 a; Table I), in agreement with undetectable accumulation of this RNA in the cell (see above). Similarly, a triple mutation in the invariable A residues of box H (A319U/A321U/A324U) and a double mutation in the invariable A residues of the ACA box (A392U/A394U) in the Box/ACA domain also abolished telomerase activity reconstitution (Fig.3 d). Finally, elimination of L8 loop in the CR7 domain in mutant Δ357–364, also resulted in lack of telomerase activity reconstitution (Fig. 3, b and c). Interestingly, elimination of four nucleotides of the junction between the BoxH/ACA and CR7 domains (J7b/8a) in mutant Δ341–345 did not affect telomerase activity, this mutant showing 112% of the wild type telomerase activity (Fig. 3 c; Table I), concurring with the fact that the length of this hinge region is not conserved in vertebrate TRs (1Chen J.-L. Blasco M.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 2000; 100: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Similarly, deletion of P4 helix in the Box/ACA domain in mutant Δ106–185 did not result in lack of reconstitution of telomerase activity (see above). Several of the mTR mutants studied affected telomerase reconstitution in vivo without significantly affecting mTR stability in the cell. Furthermore, some of these mTR mutations consist of small deletions and, therefore, are unlikely to alter correct mTR folding. These mutantmTRs are good candidates to act as telomerase inhibitors when overexpressed in wild type cells. The following mTRmutations were tested as potential dominant negatives: mutants Δ120–143 and Δ56–73 in the pseudoknot domain and mutant Δ220–241 in the CR4-CR5 domain, all of which resulted in 80–90% reduction of wild type mTR reconstitution activity. We also constructed and studied an mTR mutant that lacked the template region, mutant Δ3–10 (see “Experimental Procedures”). To check the ability of the different mTR mutations to inhibit wild type telomerase activity, we transfected a wild type 3T3 cell line (parental cells in Fig. 5) (31Blasco M.A. Lee H.-W. Hande P. Samper E. Lansdorp P. DePinho R. Greider C.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar) with either an empty vector or with the different mutantmTR constructs, and in all cases the constructs contained a neomycin resistance gene for selection of stable clones (see “Experimental Procedures”). After selection with G418, several clones were isolated, and telomerase activity was assayed and quantified as described before. We considered that there was inhibition when telomerase activity was 30% or less that of the parental cell line. In the case of all mTR mutations assayed, but in none of the empty vector-transfected cells, we were able to isolate clones that showed inhibition of telomerase activity. Clones showing telomerase inhibition were 0% for the empty vector (0 of 8), 35% for Δ3–10 mutant (5 of 14), 41% for Δ56–73 mutant (5 of 12), 11.1% for Δ120–143 mutant (1 of 9), and 45.5% for Δ220–241 mutant (5 of 11). Fig. 5 shows telomerase activity quantification of mutantmTR-stable clones as compared with cells transfected with the empty vector or as compared with parental wild type cells (Fig. 5; see parental cells and empty vector lanes). These results show that mutations in the template, pseudoknot, and CR4-CR5 domains render mTR molecules that inhibit telomerase activity when expressed in wild type cells, suggesting that they act as dominant negatives. Furthermore, these results suggest that these regions are not essential for interaction with the mTERT subunit of telomerase. The data presented here show that mutations in any of the four conserved mTR domains affect in vivo reconstitution of active telomerase complexes, suggesting that the full-length mTR molecule is important for in vivo formation of active telomerase complexes. In particular, our structure-function analysis supports a model in which vertebrate telomerase RNAs have two main functional domains as follows: (i) a domain that is essential for mTR stability, including the conserved BoxH/ACA and CR7 regions (highlighted in yellow in Fig.6), and (ii) a domain that is important for activity and that includes the conserved pseudoknot and CR4-CR5 regions (highlighted in blue in Fig. 6). A previous report showed that hTR nucleotides from nucleotides 211 to 241, (including CR4-CR5, BoxH/ACA, and CR7 domains) were important for hTR accumulation and processing in the cell (26Mitchell J.R. Cheng J. Collins K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In this regard, we find that regions within the BoxH/ACA and CR7 domains, but not in the CR4-CR5 domain, are essential for mTR accumulation in vivo. The BoxH/ACA domain has been also shown to be important for stability in small nucleolar RNAs (37Smith C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 38Weinstein L.B. Steitz J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Importantly, mutants affecting helix P4 of BoxH/ACA domain and the hinge region between BoxH/ACA and CR7 domains do not abolish mTR accumulation in the cell and are not highlighted in yellow in Fig. 6. Our results also suggest that the CR4-CR5 domain, formerly included in the “BoxH/ACA region” by Mitchell et al. (26Mitchell J.R. Cheng J. Collins K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), contains a highly conserved region that seems important for mTR processing (highlighted ingreen in Fig. 6). As mentioned previously, the mTR domains important for reconstitution of telomerase activity include the pseudoknot and CR4-CR5 domains and are highlighted in blue in Fig. 6. Furthermore, the fact that mutants in these regions are able to inhibit wild type telomerase activity when overexpressed in vivo suggests that mutations in these regions do not abolish binding to mTERT. It is important to notice the fact that none of the pseudoknot mutants resulted in complete absence of telomerase activity reconstitution, suggesting that the pseudoknot domain is not essential for in vivoreconstitution of telomerase activity. In contrast, analysis of mutants in the CR4-CR5 domain suggested an essential role of CR4-CR5 domain in reconstitution of telomerase activity. This coincides with a previous report (26Mitchell J.R. Cheng J. Collins K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) that suggested that nucleotides 211–241 in hTR (including the CR4-CR5 domain) contained regions that were important for telomerase activity. In contrast, in vitro reconstitution studies yielded different results regarding the minimal hTR region required for telomerase activity. The studies by Autexier et al. (28Autexier C. Pruzan R. Funk W. Greider C.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5928-5935Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), which mapped the minimal functional region of hTR to nucleotides 44–203 using a reconstitution system with Micrococcus nuclease-treated, partially purified human 293 cells, and that by Beattie et al. (29Beattie T.L. Zhou W. Robinson M.O. Harrington L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 177-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), which mapped the minimal hTR region to nucleotides 10–154 using in vitroproduced hTR and hTERT, do not coincide with the in vivoreconstitution results that show that the conserved CR4-CR5 domain is essential for telomerase activity. The results we obtained with thein vivo reconstitution system are coincidental with those by Tesmer et al. (30Tesmer V.M. Ford L.P. Holt S.E. Frank B.C. Yi X. Aisner D.L. Ouellette M. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6207-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) that described that hTR nucleotides 1–325 (including the CR4-CR5 domain) but not 1–300 were sufficient to reconstitute wild type telomerase activity, again suggesting that the CR4-CR5 domain is important for telomerase activity. It is important to notice that mutants in mTR regions that are not conserved in other vertebrate telomerase RNAs were less critical for both mTR activity and stability. Structure-function studies in mammalian telomerase RNAs are a necessary step for a rational design of telomerase inhibitors. In this regard, we identify here several short sequences in the template, pseudoknot, and CR4-CR5 conserved domains that when mutated act as dominant negatives. These three mTR unpaired regions in the template, pseudoknot, and CR4-CR5 domains are good candidates for antisense inhibition of telomerase.

However, specific combinations of AREs in their native promoter context result in highly cooperative DNA binding by AR and high levels of transcriptional activation. We demonstrate that the natural androgen-regulated promoters of prostate specific antigen and probasin contain two classes of AREs dictated by their primary nucleotide sequence that function to mediate cooperativity. Class I AR-binding sites display conventional guanine contacts. Class II AR-binding sites have distinctive atypical sequence features and, upon binding to AR, the DNA structure is dramatically altered through allosteric interactions with the receptor. Class II sites stabilize AR binding to adjacent class I sites and result in synergistic transcriptional activity and increased hormone sensitivity. We have determined that the specific nucleotide variation within the AR binding sites dictate differential functions to the receptor. We have identified the role of individual nucleotides within class II sites and predicted consensus sequences for class I and II sites. Our data suggest that this may be a universal mechanism by which AR achieved unique regulation of target genes through complex allosteric interactions dictated by primary binding sequences.

The specificity of steroid receptor response can arise through at least five stratified regulatory mechanisms, including: availability of constituents in the tissue such as hormones, corresponding receptors, and transcriptional coregulator proteins; influence of proximal transcription factors bound to the promoter; cooperative binding to multiple hormone response elements; and sequence-specific DNA target recognition of individual binding sites (reviewed in Ref. 1Nelson C.C.

For the majority of nuclear receptors, specificity of response is acquired largely by sequence specificity of the primary DNA-binding site. This level of specificity is commonplace with nuclear receptors within the thyroid, retinoid, estrogen receptor (ER) subfamily that bind as homodimers and heterodimers as well as orphan receptors that bind as monomers to distinctive extended DNA sequences (2Yu V.C.

Recently, evidence has emerged that steroid receptors can also use sequence specificity to a degree to help discriminate their binding targets (1Nelson C.C. Hendy S.C. Shukin R.J. Cheng H.

However, steroid receptors appear to often have overlapping sequence specificity within the primary binding site and must employ additional mechanisms to achieve exclusive regulation of their cognate regulated promoters (10Cato A. Henderson D. Ponta H. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 11Rundlett S. Miesfeld R. Mol. Cell.

In the case of AR, a number of studies have shown that AR binds cooperatively to multiple androgen responsive elements (AREs) within native promoters, and this is likely a fundamental mechanism for AR-specific transcriptional activation (13Grad J.M.

By definition, cooperative DNA binding is the binding of a protein at one DNA site that facilitates the binding of other protein molecules at additional distant sites. This can occur by stabilizing the binding of the resulting complex or by making the additional binding sites more accessible (19Travers A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 616-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kerppola T. Structure. 1998; 6: 549-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 21Senear D. Ross J. Laue T. Methods. 1998; 16: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Stabilization of a complex typically involves protein-protein interactions and results in distant DNA sites brought together, looping out the intervening DNA and resulting in an interactive cluster of transcription factors. If cooperative binding involves creating access to DNA sites, then it is normally achieved by allosteric interactions between the protein and DNA, which alters the DNA in a manner that either restricts the interaction of a repressor complex or chromatin structure or permits the interaction of a positive acting factor (22Hager G.

Examples of these allosteric cooperative interactions have been well documented for the structures of the NFAT1·Fos·Jun·ARRE2, MAT alpha 2·MCM1·STE6, and E1·E2 transcription regulatory complexes, which reveal dramatic changes in protein conformation and DNA bending upon complex formation (19Travers A.

Typically, cooperativity is studied between one species of protein that facilitates another protein species binding. However, in the case of AR it is apparent that AR cooperates with other AR molecules to bind to specific arrangements of multiple AREs within a given promoter (9Kasper S. Rennie P.S. Bruchovsky N.

The AR binds as a homodimer to individual inverted hexameric DNA half-sites that are spaced by 3 base pairs. Studies have shown that the highest affinity binding for AR and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) occurs on the imperfect palindrome, GGTACAnnnTGTTCT (1Nelson C.C. Hendy S.C. Shukin R.J. Cheng H.

In nature, however, androgen-regulated promoters do not contain this optimized element and instead possess numerous variations of this consensus sequence (reviewed in Ref. 1Nelson C.C. Hendy S.C. Shukin R.J. Cheng H. Bruchovsky N. Koop B.F. Rennie P.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2090-2107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In general, these variants are of lower affinity compared with the idealized element, but are instrumental in discriminating preferential steroid receptor binding and transcriptional activation (1Nelson C.C.

Thus there is a wide range of sequences that AR can bind, typically containing the core requirement of three out of four guanines contacts at GGTACAnnnTGTTCT. Sequence variation of the binding site not only affects DNA binding affinity, but also separately affects transcriptional activity in a manner that is discordant with affinity (1Nelson C.C. Hendy S.C. Shukin R.J. Cheng H. Bruchovsky N. Koop B.F. Rennie P.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2090-2107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By extrapolation of crystallographic studies of the GR DNA binding domain (DBD) with DNA, it is assumed that AR uses the same amino acids within its DNA recognition α-helix (CGSCKVFFKRAAE) to form similar hydrogen bonds to nucleotides within the half-sites for sequence-specific recognition (25Gewirth D. Sigler P. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 26Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). The most fundamental contacts obligatorily conserved throughout the nuclear receptor family are between the first lysine, which bonds to the second guanine GGTACA of the half-site and the arginine, which binds to a conserved G base paired to cytosine GGTACA (26Luisi B.F.

These anchoring base contacts are universal within the nuclear receptor family and have been demonstrated for a large number of receptors by a variety of techniques (4Kliewer S.A. Umesono K.

Further discrimination between half-sites is achieved by a specific van der Waals contact between the valine and the thymidine base paired to A, GGTACA for AR, GR, and progesterone receptor (PR) (26Luisi B.F.

The ER binds to an inverted repeat spaced by 3 base pairs with the sequence, AGGTCAnnnTGACCT, by discrimination with its DNA recognition α-helix (CEGCKAFFKRTIQ) using its unique glutamate in a bond to cytosine base paired to the characteristic guanine of an estrogen response element AGGTCA (31Schwabe J.W.R.

The alanine in the DNA recognition α-helix restricts ER from binding to a sequence containing an AGGACA (7Zilliacus J. Carlstedtduke J. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although the core consensus half-sites extend for 6 base pairs, other nucleotides are not known to engage in base-specific bonds, but the conservation of these nucleotides imply functional significance. Of interest is the observation that alteration of the sixth nucleotide to a T or G increases transcriptional activity despite lowering DNA binding affinity for AR and PR (1Nelson C.C. Hendy S.C.

In other studies, it has been shown that particular nucleotides are discriminated against due to incompatibility of a receptor DBD structure and a given sequence, which provides another level of discrimination (1Nelson C.C.

Therefore, there are general core nucleotide requirements of a steroid response element, but there is also nucleotide variation within the binding site that provides function apart from the receptor binding affinity to the DNA. AR DNA-binding sites display an exceptional amount of variation in sequence and as isolated binding sites are typically of relatively low affinity and low transcriptional activity. However, it is clear from studies with a number of promoters that physiological levels of response by AR are achieved in conjunction with sets of AREs that are organized into the appropriate spatial architecture (14Kasper S.

How these AREs interact mechanistically in a cooperative manner for DNA binding and in a synergistic manner for transactivation is not understood. In this study we have identified and characterized the nature and mechanism of cooperative binding of AR on androgen-regulated regions of the probasin promoter and the PSA enhancer. We have identified and characterized a subclass of AREs with distinctive sequence variation that AR binds in an allosteric manner altering the local DNA structure. These sites serve as a focal point that facilitates binding to adjacent AREs of more conventional sequence identity. This stabilized complex provides high levels of transcriptional activation by AR and increased AR sensitivity to androgen concentration. This phenomenon appears to be a universal mechanism by which AR interacts cooperatively with DNA to enhance gene expression levels. This furthers our understanding of how androgen-responsive genes are regulated and how the precise nucleotide sequences AREs dictate unique functions. The rat AR-DBD (amino acids 524–648) was inserted into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pTrcHisC (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) to construct the six-histidine residue N-terminal fusion protein AR-HisTag. The recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 and purified on nickel-NTA-Sepharose according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen Corp., Germany) except for the following modifications: the column was washed once with 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and twice with 50 mm NaH2PO4 pH 8.0, 20 mm imidazole. Protein was eluted off the Ni-NTA column with 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 250 mm imidazole. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford Assays. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLa cells containing the stable transfection FLAG tag full-length androgen receptor (HeLa-fAR), a kind gift from Michael Carey, UCLA (18Huang W. Shostak Y. Tarr P. Sawyers C. Carey M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25756-25768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 nm R1881 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) prior to extraction by a method modified from a previous study (18Huang W. Shostak Y. Tarr P. Sawyers C. Carey M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25756-25768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and centrifuged 10 min at 1000 rpm. The cell pellet was washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 5 volumes of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT), centrifuged 5 min at 1850 × g and resuspended in 3 volumes of buffer A. After 10 min on ice the cells were homogenized with 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, and the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 15 min at 3300 × g. Nuclei were resuspended in 1 volume of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% v/v glycerol, 20 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with gentle mixing. The nuclear extract was obtained by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 30 min. Fragments of the rat probasin promoter were generated by PCR amplification using the −286 to + 28 portion of the probasin promoter inserted BamHI/HindIII into pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as a template. The fragments studied are as follows: ARE1 G-1 ARE2 G-2 (−269 to −77), G-1 ARE2 G-2 (−229 to −77), ARE1 G-1 (−269 to −164), ARE2 G-2 (−150 to −77), ARE1(−269 to −210), ARE2 (−150 to −105), G-1(−229 to −164), and G-2 (−121 to −77). In addition, six sets of complementary 29-mers corresponding to the wild-type G-1 binding site and five mutant forms were synthesized: wild-type G-1: 5′-CTTATTAGGGACATACCCACAAAT-3′; A195C: 5′-CTTAATAGGGACATAAAGCCCCCAAATAA-3′; C197T: 5′-CTTAATAGGGACATAAAGCTCACAAATAA-3′; G-207A: 5′-CTTAATAGGAACATAAAGCCCACAAATAA-3′; T215G: 5′-CGTAATAGGGACATAAAGCCCACAAATAA-3′; Spacer mutant: 5′-CTTAATAGGGACACGGAGCCCACAAATAA-3′. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Nucleic Acid and Protein Services, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. Methylation protection of either the rat probasin promoter and the human PSA enhancer regions was performed by a modified protocol. 2Reid, K. J., and Nelson, C. C. (2001)Biotechniques 30,in press. In brief, histidine-tagged AR-DBD (7.2 μg, 13.6 μm) was incubated at room temperature with 2.0 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and DNA binding buffer (DBB: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT). To each reaction 350,000 dpm (26.5 fmol) of32P-single-end-labeled DNA probe was added, and the binding reaction was brought to equilibrium at room temperature. To methylate the protein-bound DNA probe, dimethyl sulfate (DMS) was added to a final concentration of 19 mm and incubated at room temperature for exactly 2 min. The methylation process was stopped by loading the reaction onto a 5% (29:1) polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× TBE while it was running at 16 V/cm at room temperature. DNA treated in the same manner, but without AR-DBD added, was used as a control. After separation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, bands indicating protein-bound and protein-free probes were excised and the DNA was eluted. The methylated DNA was cleaved using 1 mpiperidine, and the denatured fragments were separated on a 6% (29:1) denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 1× TBE and 8.3 murea. Gels were dried and autoradiographed, and the developed images were scanned using a Hewlett-Packard 6300-dpi resolution scanner. Bands were quantitated and compared using ImageQuaNT (5.0). Methylation interference of the G-1 and ARE2 fragments of the probasin promoter involved premethylating the DNA fragments before carrying out the binding reaction. The 32P-single-end-labeled DNA probe (200 fmol) in DMS buffer (50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1.0 μg of calf thymus DNA) was incubated with 45 mm DMS for exactly 2 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with DMS Stop Solution (1.5 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0, and 1.0 mβ-mercaptoethanol), and the DNA was ethanol-precipitated. The methylated probe was then used in a protein-binding reaction with AR-DBD as described in the methylation protection protocol. The bands indicating bound and free (in the presence of protein) and unbound (no protein) probes were excised, and the DNA was eluted. The DNA was cleaved using 90 mm NaOH and examined as described in the methylation protection protocol. For gel shift analysis of relative binding affinities, radiolabeled fragments of the probasin promoter were obtained by PCR amplification in the presence of α-dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 50 mCi/mmol specific activity. Probes were gel-purified as described above. Binding assays were carried out by preincubating AR-DBD-histidine tag protein (10 pmol) with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) and DBB in a 10-μl volume for 10 min. Increasing amounts of the respective radiolabeled probe were then added in 2 μl of DBB and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Samples were then loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed for 90 min at 20 V/cm. The gels were dried and autoradiographed on Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For DNA binding analysis, bands corresponding to the bound protein·DNA complex and free DNA were excised from the dried gel, and the activity of each band was determined by scintillation counting. Relative binding affinity for the probes containing more than one binding site (ARE1 G-1 ARE2 G-2, ARE1 G-1, and G-1 ARE2 G-2) were compared by plotting boundversus free values averaged from three independent repetitions for each probe. Binding constants for probes containing one (dimeric) binding site (ARE1, G-1, ARE2, and G-2) were determined by Scatchard analysis as described previously (39Nelson C. Hendy S. Faris J. Romaniuk P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19464-19474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter plasmids were created by introducing BamHI/HindIII ends to each fragment of the probasin promoter by PCR and cloning into the corresponding restriction sites of pTK-luc (ATCC). LNCaP cells were then transfected with 0.2 μg of reporter plasmid, 1.2 μg of rat androgen receptor in pRcCMV (Invitrogen), and 8 ng of the renilla expression plasmid pRLTK (Promega) using Lipofectin (Life Technologies). Cells were incubated for 22 h in 24-well plates containing either 5% charcoal-stripped medium alone or with R1881 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), ranging in concentration from 0.001 to 5 nm. Cells were washed and harvested with passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity of 20-μl aliquots of lysate was determined using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega) on a luminometer (Berthold, Germany). Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency using renilla activity. Experiments were done in triplicate, averaged, and expressed both in relative luciferase units (RLU) and as -fold induction. The AR has been shown to bind to the probasin promoter in a highly cooperative manner (14Kasper S. Rennie P. Bruchovsky N. Sheppard P. Cheng H. Lin L. Shui R. Snoek R. Matusik R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31763-31769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two androgen response elements (AREs) have been previously characterized in the proximal promoter (15Rennie P. Bruchovsky N. Leco K. Sheppard P. McQueen S. Cheng H. Snoek R. Hamel A. Bock M. MacDonald B. Nickel B. Chang C. Liao S. Cattini P. Matusik R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). These AREs, referred to as ARE1 and ARE2, are separated by 80 base pairs. If either ARE1 or ARE2 is mutated to a nonbinding form, then binding to the other ARE is impaired and transcriptional activity is greatly compromised (15Rennie P. Bruchovsky N. Leco K. Sheppard P. McQueen S. Cheng H. Snoek R. Hamel A. Bock M. MacDonald B. Nickel B. Chang C. Liao S. Cattini P. Matusik R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In other data, in which the intervening sequence has been deleted, transcription activation by AR is greatly impaired (9Kasper S. Rennie P.S. Bruchovsky N. Lin L. Cheng H. Snoek R. Dahlman-Wright K. Gustafsson J.-A. Shiu R.P.C. Sheppard P.C. Matusik R.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 22: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore these data suggest that AR binds cooperatively to the probasin promoter in a functionally significant manner and that this cooperative binding is reliant on the integrity of the intervening sequence (9Kasper S. Rennie P.S. Bruchovsky N. Lin L. Cheng H. Snoek R. Dahlman-Wright K. Gustafsson J.-A. Shiu R.P.C. Sheppard P.C. Matusik R.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 22: 313-"

In the present study, we examined Sph-1-P-stimulated signaling pathways related to human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) motility, with a special emphasis on the cytoskeletal docking protein Crk-associated substrate (Cas). Sph-1-P stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas, which was inhibited by the Giinactivator pertussis toxin but not by the Rho inactivator C3 exoenzyme or the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632. Fyn constitutively associated with and phosphorylated Cas, suggesting that Cas tyrosine phosphorylation may be catalyzed by Fyn. Furthermore, upon HUVEC stimulation with Sph-1-P, Crk, through its SH2 domain, interacted with tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas, and the Cas-Crk complex translocated to the cell periphery (membrane ruffles), through mediation of Gi (Fyn) but not Rho. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, and formation of stress fibers and focal adhesion were mediated by Rho but not Gi(Fyn). Finally, Sph-1-P-enhanced HUVEC motility, assessed by a phagokinetic assay using gold sol-coated plates and a Boyden's chamber assay, was markedly inhibited not only by pertussis toxin (or the Fyn kinase inhibitor PP2) but also by C3 exoenzyme (or Y-27632). In HUVECs stimulated with Sph-1-P, these data suggest the following: (i) cytoskeletal signalings may be separable into Gi-mediated signaling pathways (involving Cas) and Rho-mediated ones (involving FAK), and (ii) coordinated signalings from both pathways are required for Sph-1-P-enhanced HUVEC motility. Since HUVECs reportedly express the Sph-1-P receptors EDG-1 (coupled with Gi) and EDG-3 (coupled with G13 and Gq) and the EDG-3 antagonist suramin was found to block specifically Rho-mediated responses, it is likely that Cas-related responses following Gi activation originate from EDG-1, whereas Rho-related responses originate from EDG-3.

Although originally postulated to function as an intracellular second messenger (11Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar), it is now established that Sph-1-P exerts many of its effects as an extracellular mediator (1Hla T. Lee M.J. Ancellin N.

Recently, plasma membrane receptors for Sph-1-P have been identified; the endothelial differentiation gene (EDG)-1, EDG-3, and EDG-5 (earlier known as AGR16 or H218) exhibit overlapping, as well as distinct, patterns of expression in various tissues as Sph-1-P receptors (12Lee M.J.

Consistent with the presence of its high affinity cell surface receptors on vascular endothelial cells, nanomolar Sph-1-P reportedly induces a variety of responses in these cells (7Hisano N.

Functionally, Sph-1-P stimulates endothelial cell proliferation through a Gi-coupled receptor, probably EDG-1 (8Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Kluk M. Volpi M. Sha'afi R.I.

Furthermore, Sph-1-P induces adherens junction assembly, migration, capillary tube formation, and promotion of angiogenesis (8Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Kluk M. Volpi M.

In this case, the signals mediated via EDG-1 (coupled with Gi) and EDG-3 (coupled with G13 and Gq) are both necessary, and Rho- and Rac-mediated signalings are involved (8Lee M.J. Thangada S.

Sph-1-P induction of angiogenesis through these EDG receptors may be related to involvement of activated platelets in this important process in vivo. However, the overall signaling pathways leading to these cytoskeletal events have not been elucidated. In the present study, we examined Sph-1-P-stimulated signaling pathways related to HUVEC motility with a special emphasis on Crk-associated substrate (Cas), a docking protein involved in cytoskeletal reorganization (17Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Recombinant Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme was prepared as described previously (18Morii N. Narumiya S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and kindly donated by Dr. S. Narumiya (Department of Pharmacology, Kyoto University Faculty of Medicine). Anti-Src monoclonal antibody (mAb) (clone 327) was kindly provided by Dr. G. Katoh (Yamanashi Medical University, Yamanashi, Japan). Y-27632, a specific Rho kinase inhibitor (19Uehata M. Ishizaki T.

(Osaka, Japan). The following materials were obtained from the indicated suppliers: anti-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) mAb (clone 2A7, used for immunoprecipitation), anti-Lyn polyclonal antibody, and anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (4G10) (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY); anti-FAK mAb (clone 77, used for immunoblotting), anti-Cas mAb, anti-Crk mAb, anti-paxillin mAb, and anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (PY20) (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-phalloidin, and d-erythro-Sph (Sigma); Sph-1-P (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA); anti-Lyn mAb (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Tokyo, Japan); anti-Fyn mAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); protein A-Sepharose 4B and glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); fura2-AM (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan); PP2 (Calbiochem); pertussis toxin (Kaken Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan); [γ-32P]ATP (111 TBq/mmol) (Du Pont-New England Nuclear, Boston, MA). HUVECs were prepared as described previously (7Hisano N. Yatomi Y. Satoh K. Akimoto S. Mitsumata M. Fujino M.A. Ozaki Y. Blood. 1999; 93: 4293-4299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml of recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor (PeproTech EC, London, UK), 20% fetal calf serum (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH), penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (100 mg/ml), at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% room air. HUVECs were not used after the sixth passage. The cells were replated in either 10- or 3.5-cm dishes coated with 0.2% gelatin (Sigma) and were used when confluent. When HUVECs were serum-starved, serum plus basic fibroblast growth factor were removed from the medium 2 h before stimulation. Human platelets were prepared as described previously (20Ozaki Y. Satoh K. Kuroda K. Qi R. Yatomi Y. Yanagi S. Sada K. Yamamura H. Yanabu M. Nomura S. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15119-15124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The proteins were resolved on an SDS-PAGE and then electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After extensive washing with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 80, the immunoblots were incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (1 μg/ml PY20 plus 1 μg/ml 4G10), anti-Src mAb (1 μg/ml), anti-Fyn mAb (1 μg/ml), anti-Lyn polyclonal antibody (2 μg/ml), anti-FAK mAb (0.25 μg/ml), anti-Crk mAb (0.25 μg/ml), or anti-Cas mAb (0.25 μg/ml) for 2 h. Antibody binding was detected using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and visualized with ECL chemiluminescence reaction reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For reprobing with other antibodies, the antibody bound on the PVDF membrane was removed with a stripping buffer (2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris/HCl (pH 6.8), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol) at 60 °C for 30 min. After washing twice with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 80, the membranes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and reprobed with the indicated antibody. HUVECs were lysed in a 1× ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, 100 mm NaCl, 6 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25 μg/ml of leupeptin) with the aid of a cell scraper. The lysates were stood on ice for 1 h with occasional mixing, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The protein concentrations of the resultant supernatant were determined by dye binding (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar), and 0.5 mg of protein was used for immunoprecipitation; some of the lysate supernatant was used as the whole cell lysate. All subsequent immunoprecipitation steps were carried out at 4 °C. The samples were precleared with protein A-Sepharose 4B, and the resultant supernatants were incubated for 4 h with the antibody indicated. Protein A-Sepharose 4B was then added and further incubated for 2 h. The resulting Sepharose beads were washed with a 1× lysis buffer three times. The samples were then separated into 2 aliquots. One was solubilized with an SDS sample buffer and used for immunoblotting. When indicated, the other was processed further for an in vitro kinase assay as follows. The beads were washed once with a low salt buffer (10 mmTris (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mmMnCl2) and then incubated with 35 μl of 20 mmHepes (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 12.5 μg of acid-treated enolase. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 15 μl of kinase reaction buffer (300 mmHepes/NaOH (pH 8.0), 30 μmNa3VO4, 150 mm MgCl2, 15 mm MnCl2, and 5 μm[γ-32P]ATP (0.75 μCi)). After 8 min at room temperature, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 25 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer, and then the contents were boiled for 3 min. The proteins were separated by an SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane. The membrane was treated with 1 m KOH at 60 °C for 30 min and then 10% acetic acid at 20 °C for 15 min and dried. The phosphorylated protein was quantified using a BAS-2000 PhosphorImager analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). The plasmid that encoded the GST fusion protein containing the SH2 domain of Crk was kindly provided by Dr. M. Matsuda (International Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan). The fusion protein construct was transformed into Escherichia coli for protein production. The protein produced was purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column by affinity chromatography, according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the binding experiments, the HUVEC lysates were precleared with glutathione-Sepharose 4B, mixed with 20 μg of GST fusion protein, and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotary shaker. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were added to preabsorb the protein complex. Following incubation for 1 h, the beads were centrifuged and washed three times with a 1× lysis buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with a 1× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. The proteins were separated on an SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted, as described above. For actin staining, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 40 min and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 8 min. Actin filaments were detected by staining with 0.1 μg/ml TRITC-conjugated phalloidin. Actin staining was observed and photographed using a confocal microscope. Fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated with anti-paxillin mAb (2.5 μg/ml), anti-Cas mAb (25 μg/ml), or anti-Crk mAb (2.5 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature, washed in PBS, and then incubated for 1 h with FluoroLinkTM Cy3TM-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After incubation, the cells were washed three times with PBS. Immunofluorescent staining was observed and photographed using a confocal microscope. Random cell motility and phagocytotic activity were jointly estimated as the area of phagokinetic tracks on gold sol particle-coated plates, as described previously (22Albrecht-Buehler G. Cell. 1977; 12: 333-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3.5-cm dishes coated with 0.2% gelatin were incubated with colloidal gold for 45 min and then washed two times with PBS. HUVECs (2000 cells) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal calf serum were added to each dish. After 16 h at 37 °C, phagokinetic tracks were visualized using dark field illumination with a confocal microscope. The area cleared of gold particles was measured after photography, and the mean value for 20 cells was calculated in each experiment. HUVEC migration was assessed by a modified Boyden's chamber assay, i.e. in Transwell cell culture chambers (Costar, Cambridge, MA) basically as described previously (23McCarthy J.B. Palm S.L. Furcht L.T. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Polycarbonate filters with 8 μm pores, used to separate the upper and lower chamber, were coated with 500 μg/ml of Matrigel (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA). The coated filters were washed with a serum-free medium and dried immediately. Then HUVECs were added to the upper compartment of the chamber at a density of 1 × 105/100 μl of medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. HUVECs were allowed to migrate toward an indicated chemoattractant in the lower chamber. After the reaction, the filters were fixed and stained with trypan blue. After removal of nonmigrated cells by wiping with cotton swabs, cells that had migrated through the filter to the lower surface were counted manually under a microscope in five predetermined fields at a magnification of × 200. We first checked the expression of cytoskeletal proteins such as Cas, FAK, talin, and vinculin in HUVECs. The same amount of HUVEC lysate protein was resolved on an SDS-PAGE and probed with each antibody. As expected, these cytoskeletal proteins were confirmed to be expressed in HUVECs (Fig.1 A). One notable finding was the abundant expression of Cas in HUVECs, although this was evaluated only in comparison with platelets (Fig. 1 A). To investigate the involvement of Cas in Sph-1-P signaling pathways, we examined the effect of Sph-1-P on its tyrosine phosphorylation in HUVECs. As shown in Fig. 1 B, Sph-1-P induced tyrosine phosphorylation of this cytoskeletal docking protein, reaching a maximal level 15–30 min after stimulation. The time course of Cas tyrosine phosphorylation induced by Sph-1-P was similar to that of FAK (Fig. 1 B). Bacterial toxins have been shown to be useful in the elucidation of cellular responses elicited by Sph-1-P. Sph-1-P-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, and growth stimulation are reportedly inhibited by pertussis toxin (8Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P.

In some systems, it was reported that Sph-1-P-induced phospholipase C activation (and the resultant intracellular Ca2+ mobilization) was sensitive to pertussis toxin (8Lee M.J. Thangada S.

On the other hand, cytoskeletal reorganization and morphological changes induced by Sph-1-P are inhibited not by pertussis toxin but by C3 exoenzyme (8Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In HUVECs, Cas tyrosine phosphorylation induced by Sph-1-P was abolished by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (Fig.2 A, upper). On the other hand, pretreatment with C3 exoenzyme failed to affect Sph-1-P-induced Cas tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2 B, upper). In contrast, Sph-1-P-induced FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was only marginally inhibited by pertussis toxin (Fig. 2 A, lower) but completely inhibited by C3 exoenzyme (Fig. 2 B, lower). We further examined the effects of Y-27632, a specific Rho kinase inhibitor (19Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar). This compound did not inhibit Cas tyrosine phosphorylation induced by Sph-1-P; it rather induced a slight Cas phosphorylation by itself and enhanced the Sph-1-P effect (Fig. 2 C, upper) for unknown reason(s). Sph-1-P-induced FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was abolished by Y-27632 (Fig. 2 C, lower) as well as by C3 exoenzyme. These findings were unexpected in view of the previous findings that Cas plays important role(s) in cytoskeletal reorganization through C3 exoenzyme-inhibitable Rho activation (27Needham L.K. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14626-14632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that, in HUVECs stimulated with Sph-1-P, cytoskeletal signalings may be separable into Gi-mediated signaling pathways (involving Cas) and Rho-mediated ones (involving FAK). Since Src family tyrosine kinases reportedly phosphorylate Cas in several systems (28Sayeski P.P. Ali M.S. Harp J.B. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T. J. Biol.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), we tested this possibility in Sph-1-P-stimulated HUVECs. In immunoprecipitation studies using each Src family tyrosine kinase, Fyn, but not Src or Lyn, was found to be constitutively associated with Cas in HUVECs (Fig.3 A). Fyn/Cas association was also observed when immunoprecipitates with anti-Cas antibody were probed with anti-Fyn antibody (data not shown). Furthermore, the kinase activity of Fyn immunoprecipitates increased upon Sph-1-P stimulation;in vitro kinase assays of Fyn immunoprecipitates revealed stimulation-dependent 32Piincorporation into Fyn, enolase, and a 130-kDa protein (confirmed as Cas with immunoblotting) (Fig. 3 B). Fyn auto-phosphorylation clearly occurred before Cas phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B). These data suggest that HUVEC Cas is constitutively associated with Fyn, and tyrosine-phosphorylated through Fyn activation, following Sph-1-P stimulation. Since there were few bands other than Cas, Fyn, and enolase (added as an exogenous substrate), in the in vitro Fyn kinase assay (Fig. 3 B), the Cas/Fyn interaction may be highly specific in HUVECs stimulated with Sph-1-P. We further examined the involvement of Fyn activation in Cas tyrosine phosphorylation with the use of PP2, a specific inhibitor of Src family tyrosine kinase(s) (31Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). As expected, pretreatment with PP2 abolished tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas (Fig.4 A), but not FAK (Fig.4 B), in Sph-1-P-stimulated HUVECs. Under these conditions, auto-phosphorylation of Fyn was completely inhibited by PP2 (data not shown). These data confirm that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas, but not FAK, is a downstream target of Fyn tyrosine kinase in HUVECs stimulated with Sph-1-P. As described above, Cas tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited by pertussis toxin (but not by C3 exoenzyme or Y-27632), and most probably catalyzed by Fyn. Hence, we next investigated whether Fyn auto-phosphorylation was regulated by Gi activation. In HUVECs stimulated with Sph-1-P, Fyn (but not Src) auto-phosphorylation was observed in an in vitro kinase assay (Fig.5). Pretreatment with pertussis toxin inhibited the Sph-1-P-induced Fyn auto-phosphorylation"
https://openalex.org/W2107778112,"The human MAT1 protein belongs to the cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase complex, which is functionally associated to the transcription/DNA repair factor TFIIH. The N-terminal region of MAT1 consists of a C3HC4 RING finger, which contributes to optimal TFIIH transcriptional activities. We report here the solution structure of the human MAT1 RING finger domain (Met1–Asp65) as determined by1H NMR spectroscopy. The MAT1 RING finger domain presents the expected βαββ topology with two interleaved zinc-binding sites conserved among the RING family. However, the presence of an additional helical segment in the N-terminal part of the domain and a conserved hydrophobic central β strand are the defining features of this new structure and more generally of the MAT1 RING finger subfamily. Comparison of electrostatic surfaces of RING finger structures shows that the RING finger domain of MAT1 presents a remarkable positively charged surface. The functional implications of these MAT1 RING finger features are discussed1G25.

We report here the solution structure of the human MAT1 RING finger domain (Met1–Asp65) as determined by1H NMR spectroscopy. The MAT1 RING finger domain presents the expected βαββ topology with two interleaved zinc-binding sites conserved among the RING family. However, the presence of an additional helical segment in the N-terminal part of the domain and a conserved hydrophobic central β strand are the defining features of this new structure and more generally of the MAT1 RING finger subfamily. Comparison of electrostatic surfaces of RING finger structures shows that the RING finger domain of MAT1 presents a remarkable positively charged surface. The functional implications of these MAT1 RING finger features are discussed1G25. cyclin-dependent kinase cdk-activating kinase glutathione S-transferase nuclear Overhauser effect root mean square deviation immediate early equine herpes virus promyelocytic leukemia MAT1 is one of the nine subunits of the human transcription/DNA repair factor TFIIH, which is known to play a crucial role in the transcription of class II genes as well as in DNA repair through the nucleotide excision repair pathway (1Frit P. Bergmann E. Egly J.M. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1999; 81: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This factor may be resolvedin vivo and in vitro into two structural subcomplexes: the TFIIH core and the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)1-activating kinase (CAK) complex (2Drapkin R. Roy G.L. Cho H. Akoulitchev S. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6488-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 3Reardon J.T. Ge H. Gibbs E. Sancar A. Hurwitz J. Pan Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6482-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The CAK complex is composed of the catalytic subunit cdk7, the regulatory subunit cyclin H, and a third partner, MAT1, originally defined as a stabilizing and activating factor (4Tassan J.P. Jaquenoud M. Fry A.M. Frutiger S. Hughes G.J. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5608-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 5Devault A. Martinez A.M. Fesquet D. Labbe J.C. Morin N. Tassan J.P. Nigg E.A. Cavadore J.C. Doree M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5027-5036Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This complex is also found in its free form within the cell and preferentially phosphorylates cdks known as key components of the cell cycle progression (6Kaldis P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). As part of the TFIIH factor, the CAK complex phosphorylates different substrates of the transcription apparatus including TATA box-binding protein, TFIIE, TFIIF, the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, and regulatory factors such as p53 and some nuclear receptors (7Riedl T. Egly J.M. Gene Expr. 2000; 9: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The cdk7 kinase activity of the CAK complex is stimulated by a combined action of cyclin H and MAT1 binding and cdk7 phosphorylation (8Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Moreover, the subunit MAT1 is involved in a substrate selection process choosing either cdk or another transcription apparatus to be phosphorylated (9Rossignol M. Kolb-Cheynel I. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1628-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar,10Yankulov K.Y. Bentley D.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of the CAK complex in transcription when part of TFIIH and to elucidate the specific role of MAT1, a structural study of all CAK components was undertaken. The crystal structure of cyclin H was solved (11Andersen G. Poterszman A. Egly J.M. Moras D. Thierry J.C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and a structural model between cdk7 and cyclin H was built (12Andersen G. Busso D. Poterszman A. Hwang J.R. Wurtz J.M. Ripp R. Thierry J.C. Egly J.M. Moras D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 958-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recently, a combination of sequence analysis and biochemical data showed that MAT1 can be divided into three functional domains: an N-terminal RING finger domain, a central coiled coil domain, and a C-terminal domain rich in hydrophobic residues. Functional analysis revealed that the C terminus strongly interacts in vitro, as well as in vivo, with the cdk7-cyclin H complex and stimulates cdk7 kinase activity (13Busso D. Keriel A. Sandrock B. Poterszman A. Gileadi O. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22815-22823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The authors showed that the median domain of MAT1 is involved in CAK anchoring to the core TFIIH through interactions with both XPD and XPB helicases. It has also been shown that the deletion of the N terminus, which presents the consensus sequence of a C3HC4 RING finger domain, inhibits the basal transcription as well as the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II when engaged in a transcription complex (13Busso D. Keriel A. Sandrock B. Poterszman A. Gileadi O. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22815-22823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This enlightens the potential role of the RING finger domain of MAT1 in the architecture of the preinitiation complex of the transcription. To complete the functional data available for the MAT1 N-terminal domain and to provide a structural basis for further structure-function relationships, we determined its solution structure using proton NMR spectroscopy. The comparison with previously reported RING finger structures shows that the MAT1 RING finger domain presents a classical ββαβ topology with a “cross-brace” arrangement of the eight zinc-binding ligands. The MAT1 RING finger domain is characterized by the presence of an additional short α-helix within the N-terminal loop and by an extended basic surface. The functional implications of these features, which are specific to all of the MAT1 RING finger orthologous sequences, are discussed, as are the new insights brought by this fourth high resolution structure of a RING finger. The nucleotide sequence encoding the fragment corresponding to the RING finger domain of MAT1 (Met1–Asp65) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into the appropriate Escherichia coliexpression vector. The cDNA of the human MAT1 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using a forward primer, which introduces aBamHI site at the 5′ end, and a reverse primer containing a stop codon and an EcoRI site at the 3′ end. After digestion by BamHI and EcoRI (New England Biolabs), the polymerase chain reaction fragment was inserted into the pGEX-4T2 expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A starter culture of 500 ml of LB containing 200 μg/ml ampicilin was inoculated with the E. coli strain BL21λ(DE3) transformed by the pGEX-4T2 recombinant vector and grown overnight at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in a fresh medium, and used to inoculate 6 liters of LB medium containing 200 μg/ml ampicilin at anA 600 nm of 0.1. Cultures were grown at 37 °C to an A 600 nm of 0.6–0.8, and the expression of recombinant proteins was induced by addition of 0.6 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 4 h, cells were harvested, washed in buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Cells were resuspended in 100 ml of buffer B (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl) containing 2.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and disrupted by sonication for 10 min (pulse 2/8, T = 10 °C) using a 13-mm probe with a Vibracell 72412 sonicator at 30% intensity. The cell extract was then centrifuged for 2 h at 45,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman R60Ti rotor. The soluble extract containing the GST-RING finger recombinant protein was incubated during 1 h at 4 °C with 4 ml of GSH-Sepharose resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) preequilibrated in buffer B containing 2.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. The resin was washed in a batch with 40 volumes of buffer B. The adsorbed proteins were eluted with 2 × 4 ml of buffer B containing 30 mm glutathione. The fractions (4 ml) containing the GST-RING finger protein (as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) were pooled, and the GST fusion protein was cleaved with bovine thrombin (Sigma) (3 units per mg of recombinant fusion protein) at 4 °C during 12 h. The sample was concentrated using a Centriprep device with a 3,000-Da cut-off (Amicon). Digestion was stopped by addition of 5 mmPefabloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the fraction was then subjected to gel filtration chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 2.6 × 60 cm at a flow rate of 2 ml/min) in buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl). Recombinant RING finger protein-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated on a Centriprep device with a 3,000-Da cut-off to a final concentration of approximately 20 mg/ml (2 mm). For NMR studies, the sample was dialyzed against buffer C containing deuterated Tris. 40 μl of D2O was added to the 400 μl of the protein solution for the lock, and 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate was used as the internal chemical shift reference.

Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4845) Google Scholar), and DQF-COSY (16Rance M. Sorensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar) spectra were recorded at four temperatures (283, 290, 298, and 303 K) on either Bruker DRX600 or DMX750 spectrometers with spectral widths of 7000 Hz (600 MHz) or 8333 Hz (750 MHz) in both dimensions and a relaxation delay of 2 s. Water signal suppression was achieved by presaturation or by using a WATERGATE sequence (17Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar). Slowly exchanging amide protons were identified by recording 70-ms NOESY spectra at 283 K and at different delays after addition of D2O to the lyophilized sample. Processing was performed on an SGI Octane SE computer using the program FELIX 97 (Biosym Technologies) and on an SGI INDY R5000 computer using XWIN-NMR software (Bruker). Spectra were assigned with the FELIX 97 package (Biosym Technologies) and the XEASY program (18Bartels C. Xia T.-H. Billeter M. Güntert M. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). A single set of resonances was assigned for 63 of the 65 residues of the MAT1 fragment; the two missing residues were the N-terminal Met and Arg54. Stereospecific assignments of Cβ methylene protons were obtained for 30 residues on the basis of the patterns of HN-Hβ and Hα-Hβ NOEs and J Hα-Hβscalar couplings (19Wagner G. Braun W. Havel T.F. Schaumann T. Go N. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 611-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). A first set of distance constraints was obtained by classifying peak volumes measured on a 70-ms NOESY spectrum recorded at 298 K as strong, medium, and weak, corresponding to distances of 2.7, 3.7 and 5.0 Å, respectively. 60 structures were generated using the restrained simulated annealing protocol implemented in the program X-PLOR 3.851 (20Nilges M. Gronenborn G.M. Clore A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 21Brünger A.T. XPLOR 3.8 Software Manual. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Eight additional distances of 2.4 Å were added between the two zinc atoms and the Sγ of cysteine residues and between the side chain of His28 and the second zinc atom according to the binding pattern deduced from the primary sequence analysis. Several rounds of structure calculations were then analyzed in an iterative manner with successive incorporation of initially ambiguous distance restraints. The structure was then refined by converting the NOE cross-peak volumes (V) into target distances (d) according to the following relationship (22Nilges M. O'Donoghue S.I. Prog. NMR Spectroscopy. 1998; 32: 107-139Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (224) Google Scholar), d=dref−6Vref·V−1/6Equation 1 where d ref was the (d ij−6)−1/6 average distance calculated for all distances ranging from 2.7 to 5 Å between amide, Hα, and Hβ protons obtained from the first round of calculations. V ref was calculated as the arithmetic average over all corresponding volumes. Upper (d+) and lower (d−) limit distance restraints were derived using the empirical relationship proposed by M. Nilges. d±=d±(0.125·d2)Equation 2 The final set of experimental constraints included 897 distances derived from NOEs (75 intra-residue, 286 sequential, 210 medium range, and 326 long range) and 22 distances derived from hydrogen bonding patterns. 22 φ and 21 ψ dihedral angles deduced fromJ HN-Hα couplings and from the secondary structure analysis were used as weak constraints (Δφ = ±50° and Δψ = ±40°). The topology of the peptide was modified to include the coordination bounds between histidine and cysteine residues and the two zinc atoms according to tetrahedral coordination values (23Daikun G.P. Fairall L. Klug A. Nature. 1986; 324: 688-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Structure calculations run using either Nε2 or Nδ1 of the His28 ring as the fourth ligand for the second zinc-binding site allowed us to unambiguously assign Nδ1 as the zinc-bound atom. A set of 51 structures was retained based on the following criteria: low total energy, no NOE violation greater than 0.5 Å, and no angle violation greater than 5°. Structures were visualized using MOLMOL (24Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics Model. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref Scopus (6498) Google Scholar), and their structural quality was analyzed with PROCHECK (25Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar) and WHATIF (26Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). The latter program has been used to define the structurally equivalent positions and to superimpose MAT1 structure onto the three available structures of RING finger domains, namely RAG1 (Protein Data Bank code 1rmd; resolution 2.1 Å), immediate early equine herpes virus (IEEHV) (Protein Data Bank code 1chc; NOE/angle dataset, 616/10; backbone/all atoms rmsd, 0.55/1.02 Å), and promyelocytic leukemia (PML) proto-oncoprotein (Protein Data Bank code 1bor; NOE/angle dataset, 197/26; backbone/all atoms rmsd, 0.88/1.40 Å). Figures showing three-dimensional structures and electrostatic surface representations were prepared with MOLMOL (24Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics Model. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). To determine the solution structure of the N-terminal RING finger domain of the human MAT1 subunit, a polypeptide corresponding to residues Met1–Asp65 was produced. The definition of the domain boundaries was based on mild proteolysis experiments and on the comparison of orthologous sequences. This domain, when expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli, is soluble and can be easily purified. After removal of the GST tag and subsequent gel filtration, the MAT1 1–65 fragment led to a monodisperse solution and could be concentrated up to 2 mm. As expected for a canonical C3HC4 RING finger domain (27Borden K.L. Freemont P.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), atomic absorption and mass spectrometry experiments showed that the human MAT1 RING finger domain binds two zinc atoms (data not shown). A first analysis of NOESY spectra recorded on the MAT1 RING finger domain indicated the presence of both α and β secondary elements with a good dispersion of resonances. The sample behaves as a monomer in solution because the average proton line widths are in a good agreement with the expected values for a folded 7-kDa protein. NOE connectivities observed between Hβ protons of Cys6, Cys9 and Cys31, Cys34 clearly indicate that these residues are forming one of the two zinc-binding sites and therefore that the two zinc atoms are bound in a cross-brace fashion, which is one of the defining features of the RING family. The distribution of the inter-residue NOE restraints used to calculate the structure together with the Cα rmsd calculated along the peptide chain are shown in Fig. 1 A. Except for a few regions where no long range NOE could be observed, the experimental set of NOE-derived distances allows an accurate definition of the three-dimensional structure of the human MAT1 RING finger domain, with a backbone rmsd of 0.67 Å. Experimental restraints and structural statistics over the 20 lowest energy structures are summarized in TableI. The Cα backbone trace of the 20 lowest energy NMR structures is shown in Fig. 1 B. The N-terminal fragment of the human MAT1 subunit adopts the ββαβ fold typical of RING finger domains and presents an unusual one-turn α helix in its N terminus. The core of the domain consists of a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, comprising residues Leu21–Val23 (β1), Thr29–Cys31 (β2), and Arg59–Gln61 (β3) packed along a two-turn α-helix (helix α2, residues Glu32–Val40).Table IStructural statistics of the MAT1 RING fingerRestraints for calculationTotal NOE restraints897Intraresidue75Sequential (‖i −j‖ = 1)286Medium range (1 < ‖i −j‖ < 4)210Long range (‖i −j‖ > 4)326Hydrogen bond restraints11α2 helix4β-sheet7Structure statistics 1-aStructure statistics refers to an ensemble of 20 structures with the lowest energy from 60 calculated structures.rmsd from idealized covalent geometryBonds (Å)0.0041 ± 0.0003Bond angles (°)0.78 ± 0.04Improper torsions (°)0.57 ± 0.05NOE restraints (Å)0.0325 ± 0.0035Dihedral angle restraints (°)0.69 ± 0.11Final energies (kcal mol−1)E total336.2 ± 43.3E bonds17.2 ± 2.8E angles173.1 ± 18.0E van der Waals50.8 ± 10.9E NOE2.2 ± 0.6Ramachandran plotResidues in most favourable regions (%)48.1Residues in additional favourable regions (%)36.9Residues in generously favourable regions (%)11.9Residues in disallowed regions (%)3.0Coordinate precision1-brmsd between the ensemble of the 20 structures.(Å)rmsd of backbone atoms (4–62)0.667rmsd of heavy atoms (4–62)1.4491-a Structure statistics refers to an ensemble of 20 structures with the lowest energy from 60 calculated structures.1-b rmsd between the ensemble of the 20 structures. Open table in a new tab The triple-stranded β−sheet is clearly defined by an unambiguous pattern of NOEs Hα-HN, Hα-Hα, and HN-HN (Fig. 1 C). Slowly exchanging amide protons are observed for residues Met22, Val23, Leu30, and Gln61 in the β-strands, which indicate that they are hydrogen-bonded. A regular pattern of Hα-HN(i,i+3), Hα-Hβ(i,i+3), and Hα-HN(i,i+4) NOEs (28Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar) together with upfield-shifted Hα resonances (29Wishart D. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar) and solvent-protected amide protons define two helical regions (α1 and α2). Some regions of the peptide chain are less well defined (local rmsd, ∼1 Å) and correspond to loops that link the secondary structure elements, namely loop L1, which encompasses helix α1 (Thr12–Arg15), and loop L2 between residues Val40 and Ser56. The Ramachandran plot (data not shown) shows that 97% of the nonglycine and nonproline residues are located in allowed regions; the few residues presenting unusual φ and ψ angles are systematically located in the loop regions. The RING domain is stabilized by two mononuclear zinc sites separated by 14 Å. Cys6, Cys9, Cys31, and Cys34 form one zinc-binding site (C4), whereas Cys26, Cys46, and Cys49 with His28 form the second zinc-binding site (C3H). The first cysteine pair (Cys6, Cys9) stabilizes the N-terminal part of the peptide. The loop L1 containing the α1 helix is connected to the central β1-strand, which is linked to β2 by a short loop harboring the two zinc ligands Cys26 and His28. A two-turn α-helix (Glu32–Val40) is positioned between the β2-strand and the β3-strand and contains Cys34, which is paired with Cys31 to form the third zinc-ligand pair. A long loop (L2) comprising the fourth pair of zinc ligands (residues Cys46, Cys49) connects the helix α2 to the β3-strand. The overall shape of the MAT1 RING finger domain is found to be slightly elongated, with principal axis lengths of 13.5 × 10.0 × 19.5 Å. Finally, the MAT1 RING finger core is stabilized by a network of highly conserved hydrophobic residues among MAT1 orthologs (Fig.2), namely Leu19 in the loop L1; Met22, Leu30, and Val60 in the internal face of the β sheet; Val35, Leu38, and Phe39 in the helix α2; and Leu53 and Phe58 in the loop L2. The topology of the three β strands, together with the cross-brace arrangement of the eight zinc-binding residues of MAT1 RING domain, is similar to that observed in two RING atomic resolution structures that have been reported: the structure from the IEEHV protein solved by NMR (30Barlow P.N. Luisi B. Milner A. Elliott M. Everett R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and the crystal structure of the human recombination-activating protein RAG1 dimerization domain (31Bellon S.F. Rodgers K.K. Schatz D.G. Coleman J.E. Steitz T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A similar cross-brace arrangement of the zinc-binding residues was also found in the structure of human acute PML proto-oncoprotein (32Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Lally J. O'Reilly N.J. Martin S. Howe K. Solomon E. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1532-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The ribbon diagrams of the MAT1 RING structure, together with the three previously reported structures of RING finger domains, are shown in Fig.3. A data base search for superimposable folds in the Protein Data Bank using the Dali program (33Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) finds structural similarities between MAT1 and the RING motifs in the RAG1 dimerization domain (31Bellon S.F. Rodgers K.K. Schatz D.G. Coleman J.E. Steitz T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and in the IEEHV (30Barlow P.N. Luisi B. Milner A. Elliott M. Everett R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The best structural homology score is found for the superimposition of the MAT1 structure onto the crystal structure of RAG1. Indeed, both structures can be superimposed for 43 Cα equivalent atoms with an rmsd value of 1.7 Å, whereas the comparison with the solution structure of the IEEHV RING yields 28 equivalent Cα atom positions that superimpose with an rmsd value of 1.99 Å (the structurally equivalent positions are indicated by plain circles in the alignment of Fig. 2 B). However, no significant superimposition could be obtained when comparing the MAT1 RING structure with the solution structure of the RING finger domain from the acute promyelocytic leukemia proto-oncoprotein PML. It is worth mentioning that the weak structural homology observed between the RING finger domains of the human MAT1 protein and PML was also observed when comparing those of RAG1 and PML (31Bellon S.F. Rodgers K.K. Schatz D.G. Coleman J.E. Steitz T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The comparison of the MAT1 RING structure with other available RING structures confirms that the consensus C3HC4 zinc-binding sequence defines a conserved structural motif, which constitutes a widely used molecular scaffold. Sequence comparisons of various RING sequences show, however, that this consensus sequence incorporates regions of high sequence diversity with variable spacing between the conserved zinc-binding residues. One of these regions is located between the first two pairs of zinc-binding ligands and encompasses the loop L1. In most RING sequences, this loop contains 10–12 residues, whereas the MAT1 sequence incorporates 16–17 residues (Fig. 2 B). The observation of a well defined secondary structure element (helix α1) in this region is noteworthy and constitutes a specific feature of the MAT1 structure (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the loop L2 containing the fourth zinc ligand pair presents the same conformation as in other RING structures despite the sequence divergence outside the fourth pair of zinc ligands. The use of stereospecific constraints on most of the Hβ methylene protons allows a precise determination of the side chain orientations (angle κ1), in particular for the zinc-binding residues. A detailed analysis of the zinc ligation sites in the various RING structures reveals that the second coordination site, ZNII, is well conserved between the different structures. When comparing the ZNII binding sites of MAT1 and RAG1 (Fig. 4), we found a sharp superimposition, with an rmsd of 0.29 Å, of the four MAT1 ZNII ligand side chain heavy atoms (Cys26, His28, Cys46, and Cys48) onto the corresponding atoms of RAG1. In the same manner, the ZNII coordination sites of RAG1 and IEEHV can be superimposed with an rmsd of 0.32 Å. The first coordination site is less conserved between the three RING finger structures. Indeed, the superimposition of the Cα of the four ligands (Cys6, Cys9, Cys31, and Cys34) onto the equivalent Cα of RAG1 is poor, yielding an rmsd of 0.57 Å, a value similar to the one obtained when comparing RAG1 and IEEHV (rmsd of 0.54 Å). In the RAG1 structure, the first zinc-binding site is part of a binuclear cluster, with the Cys29 (equivalent to Cys9 in MAT1) bridging two zinc atoms. This feature of RAG1 may explain the observed local structure differences around the first zinc-binding site. In a recent paper, Busso et al. (13Busso D. Keriel A. Sandrock B. Poterszman A. Gileadi O. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22815-22823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have established the role of the N-terminal RING finger domain of MAT1 in the activation of transcription in a TFIIH-dependent manner. They have also observed that the presence of the RING finger domain allows an optimal phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain. In agreement with the general role of RING domains in mediating protein-protein interactions (34Borden K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that the MAT1 RING domain interacts with other factors within the preinitiation complex of transcription, although no partner has yet been found. When compared with other RING structures, the MAT1 RING domain presents specific features that could be involved in the MAT1 activities. First, the occurrence of a stretch of conserved hydrophobic residues located in the vicinity of the β1 strand (residues Leu19, Leu21, Met22, and Val23) constitutes an interesting feature. Among these conserved hydrophobic residues, two are involved in the hydrophobic packing of the RING structure, namely Leu19 and Met22, whereas the two others (Leu21 and Val23) are exposed to the solvent. Such a stretch of hydrophobic residues is unusual in RING sequences (Pfam zf-C3HC4 (35Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Finn R.D. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar)) and could be related to a regulation of the MAT1 activity. A second specific structural feature of MAT1 concerns the presence of a structured region including one turn of an α-helix (α1), which corresponds to the sequence insertion between the first and second pairs of zinc-binding ligands, only observed in MAT1 sequences. Interestingly, this helix contains a solvent-exposed tyrosine residue (Tyr14), which is strictly conserved among all MAT1 sequences, suggesting that the helix α1 might be involved in the packing of the RING domain with another partner. This hypothesis is supported by the comparison of the MAT1 RING structure with the crystal structure of RAG1, which shows that the equivalent part in RAG1 interacts with its N-terminal C2H2 zinc finger (32Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Lally J. O'Reilly N.J. Martin S. Howe K. Solomon E. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1532-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Moreover, the solvent-exposed tyrosine could be a potential site for phosphorylation and therefore be involved in activity regulation. Recently, the crystal structure of a complex consisting of a portion of the c-Cbl proto-oncogene protein bound to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH7 and a kinase peptide was reported (36Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). The structure reveals that the loop L1 of the C-terminal C-cbl RING domain interacts closely with both the N-terminal C-cbl tyrosine kinase binding domain and the UbcH7 partner, thus emphasizing the functional role of this region in RING domains. Analysis of the surface electrostatic potential shows that the MAT1 RING domain is highly positively charged because of the presence of several basic side chains of arginines and lysines (Fig.5). Whereas the extended distribution of the nine positive charges observed at the domain surface is a specific feature of higher eucaryote sequences of MAT1, it is worth noting that the four positively charged residues that are conserved from human to yeast (Lys20, Arg54, Lys55, and Arg59) are located in the same area, forming a positive patch. Two highly conserved acidic residues located on the helix (Glu32 and Asp36) form a small negative patch on the exposed side of the helix α2. It is worth noting that the two C-terminal acidic residues (Glu64 and Asp65) are also conserved but are disordered in the structure. The presence of positively charged patches on protein surfaces seems to be a general feature of the RING finger domains, but the basicity of the MAT1 RING surface is remarkable, as shown in Fig. 5. It must be stressed that most of the mutations that affect the function of PML and IEEHV RING finger domains involve charged residues. The role of the MAT1 RING finger domain within the transcription complex needs to be studied further by site-directed mutagenesis. Two targets need to be identified from the three-dimensional structure and probed: (i) the positively charged residues that may be involved in the modulation of the CAK phosphorylation activity through electrostatic interactions with either the phosphorylated C-terminal domain, the DNA, or another component of the preinitiation complex, and (ii) the solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues in the strand β1 that may directly affect the stability of the preinitiation complex. It would be of particular interest to know whether these residues are independently related to the two distinct functions of the MAT1 RING finger domain: the phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain and transcription activation. To address these points, the building of specific mutants is currently under way. Since the first member of the Really Interesting New Gene protein family was identified in 1991 (37Freemont P.S. Hanson I.M. Trowsdale J. Cell. 1991; 64: 483-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), only a few structural data are yet available, partly because of the natural propensity of these domains to aggregate and precipitate when being expressed and concentrated. So far no general structure-activity relationship for the RING finger family has been established. The solution structure of the N-terminal part of MAT1 is the fourth structure of a RING domain that is now available. These new data provide interesting insights into the structure of the loop region of variable length between the first two pairs of zinc-binding residues that could be useful in other biological contexts. Finally, the structural variability of the loop L1 and the charge distribution at the surface of the RING domains could be essential factors that modulate RING finger activities.

For Torpedo nAChR, photoaffinity-labeling studies with the competitive antagonistd-[3H]tubocurarine (dTC) identified two tryptophans, γTrp-55 and δTrp-57, as the primary sites of photolabeling in the non-α subunits. To characterize the importance of γTrp-55 and δTrp-57 to the interactions of agonists and antagonists, Torpedo nAChRs were expressed inXenopus oocytes, and equilibrium binding assays and electrophysiological recordings were used to examine the functional consequences when either or both tryptophans were mutated to leucine. Neither substitution altered the equilibrium binding of dTC. However, the δW57L and γW55L mutations decreased acetylcholine (ACh) binding affinity by 20- and 7,000-fold respectively. For the wild-type, γW55L, and δW57L nAChRs, the concentration dependence of channel activation was characterized by Hill coefficients of 1.8, 1.1, and 1.7. For the γW55L mutant, dTC binding at the α-γ site acts not as a competitive antagonist but as a coactivator or partial agonist. These results establish that interactions with γ Trp-55 of theTorpedo nAChR play a crucial role in agonist binding and in the agonist-induced conformational changes that lead to channel opening.

The nAChR contains two binding sites for agonists and competitive antagonists, located at the α-γ and α-δ subunit interfaces (4Blount P. Merlie J.P.

Affinity labeling and mutational analyses provide evidence that amino acids from three discrete regions of α subunit primary structure and from three (or more) regions of the γ (or δ) subunit contribute to the structure of the binding sites (reviewed in Refs. 8Prince R.J.

Several experimental approaches have identified residues in both γ and δ subunits that contribute to the binding sites for agonists or competitive antagonists. Photoaffinity labeling usingd-[3H]tubocurarine (dTC), a competitive antagonist, and [3H]nicotine, an agonist, established that γTrp-55 is located near the agonist binding site inTorpedo nAChR (10Chiara D.C.

FEBS Letts. 1998; 423: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and [3H]dTC also reacted with δTrp-57, the corresponding position in the δ subunit, as well as with γTyr-111/γTyr-117 (12Chiara D.C. Xie Y. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6689-6698Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Substitution of γTrp-55 by leucine (γW55L) caused a 10-fold decrease in dTC potency as an inhibitor of ACh-induced currents for Torpedo nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes (13O'Leary M.E.

Analysis of binding properties of embryonic mouse nAChRs containing chimeras between γ and δ subunits led to the identification of three positions in the γ subunit (Ile-116, Tyr-117, and Ser-161) and the corresponding residues in the δ subunit (Ser-118, Thr-119, and Lys-163), which can account for the binding selectivity of the competitive antagonist dimethyl-d-tubocurarine (metocurine (19Fu D.X. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26152-26157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), whereas for the agonist carbamylcholine, the primary determinants of site selectivity were γLys-34/δSer-36 and γPhe-172/δIle-178 (20Prince R.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25770-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For the adult mouse nAChR (α2βεδ), a similar analysis of chimeric ε-δ subunits identified amino acids in another region of subunit primary structure (εIle-58/δHis-60 and εAsp-59/δAla-61) as determinants of metocurine site selectivity (21Bren N. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30793-30798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this report we examine the contributions of γTrp-55 and δTrp-57 as determinants of agonist binding and channel gating as well as determinants of competitive antagonist function. γTrp-55 and δTrp-57 were mutated to leucine, and the interaction of agonists and antagonists were examined using both binding assays and electrophysiological recording. Concentration-dependent inhibition of 125I-α-bungarotoxin (α-BgTx) binding by agonists and antagonists was studied using wild-type and mutantTorpedo nAChRs in membranes isolated from Xenopusoocyte homogenates. In parallel experiments, we studied the activation of wild-type and mutant nAChRs by ACh using a two-electrode voltage clamp. Our results establish that the mutation γW55L has no effect on dTC equilibrium binding affinity. However, the mutation has a profound effect on ACh binding and on the gating of the ion channel. Furthermore, for the γW55L mutant nAChR, dTC acts not as an antagonist when bound to its high affinity site but as a coactivator with ACh. ACh, dTC, tetramethylammonium, phenyltrimethylammonium, suberyldicholine, nicotine, and gallamine were obtained from Sigma. Epibatidine and dihydro-β-erythroidine were obtained from Sigma-RBI (Natick, MA), and pancuronium was from Organon Inc. (W. Orange, NJ). α-BgTx was from Biotoxins Inc. (St. Cloud, FL). 125I-α-BgTx (400–600 Ci/mmol) was prepared using iodogen (Pierce) and Na[125I] as described (22Loring R.H. Schulz D.W. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 12: 324-341Google Scholar). Na[125I] and [35S]methionine/cysteine were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Affinity-purified rabbit antibodies against α-BgTx were kindly provided by Dr. Robert Sealock (University of North Carolina), and metocurine and 13′-iodo-dTC were donated by Dr. Steen E. Pedersen (23Pedersen S.E. Papineni R.V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31141-31150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). SP64-based plasmids (pMXT) with cDNAs encoding wild-type α, γ, δ, and the γW55L subunits were gifts from Dr. Michael M. White, and the cDNA (in plasmid SP64) encoding the wild-type β subunit was from Dr. Henry Lester. Sequence analysis of the δW57L mutant cDNA (from Dr. White) revealed a point deletion 353 bases 3′ to the δW57L mutation point that resulted in a truncated form of the subunit. Therefore, the full-length δW57L mutant was prepared by subcloning a NheI (present in the vector) andBstXI fragment that included the desired mutation (δW57L) but excluded the point deletion into the wild-type δ subunit cDNA from which the corresponding region had been excised. cDNAs were linearized with either XbaI (for wild-type α, γ, δ, γW55L, and δW57L mutant subunits) or FspI (for the wild-type β subunit). In vitro transcription reactions were carried out in transcription buffer (Promega) containing 40 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, and 10 mm NaCl. Linear cDNAs (5–10 μg) were incubated with 10 mm dithiothreitol, NTPs (1 mm each except GTP, which was 0.2 mm), 0.6 mm diguanosine triphosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 100 units of RNasin (Promega), and 40 units of SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega) in transcription buffer at 37 °C for 1 h. An additional 40 units of SP6 RNA polymerase was added after 1 h, and the incubation was continued for another hour. In some experiments, [3H]UTP was included in the reaction mixture as a tracer for quantitation of reaction yields. RNAs were extracted with phenol/chloroform and chloroform, precipitated from isopropanol, and then resuspended in water at a concentration of ≈3 μg/μl. Isolated, follicle-free oocytes were microinjected with 0.5–10 ng of subunit-specific RNAs in a molar stoichiometry of (α2βγδ) for wild-type and mutant receptors. For γ-less and δ-less receptors, nAChR subunit RNAs were mixed in a molar ratio of (α2βδ2) and (α2βγ2), respectively. Oocytes were injected with 10 ng of subunit RNA for assays of125I-α-BgTx binding in intact oocytes or in membrane fractions and for all electrophysiological assays with the exception of full agonist-dose response relations for wild-type receptors. Because of the high currents produced by activation of wild-type receptors, maximal responses were determined for oocytes injected with 0.5 ng of RNA. Oocytes were maintained in ND96 buffer containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mmHEPES (pH 7.6), and 50 μg/ml gentamicin for at least 48 h before use. To measure binding to nAChRs expressed on the surface, oocytes were incubated with 2.5 nm125I-α-BgTx for 2 h in a final volume of 100 μl of low Ca2+ ND96 buffer containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.3 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.6). Oocytes were washed 3 times with 1 ml of ice-cold low Ca2+ND96 buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin and counted in a γ counter. Nonspecific binding was determined using uninjected oocytes. Oocyte membranes were prepared by homogenizing oocytes in ice-cold homogenization buffer (HB, 0.1 ml/oocyte) containing 140 mmNaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethysulfonylfluoride, and 0.1 units of aprotinin/ml (pH 7.6). Membranes were isolated as described (12Chiara D.C. Xie Y. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6689-6698Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) by differential and sucrose density centrifugation. Membranes were resuspended in HB at 5 μl per oocyte, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. A centrifugation assay (12Chiara D.C. Xie Y. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6689-6698Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was used to measure the initial rate of 125I-α-BgTx binding to oocyte membranes in low Ca2+ ND96 assay buffer (supplemented with the cholinesterase inhibitor diisopropylphosphofluoridate (0.1 mm) for ACh binding experiments). Binding assays were initiated by adding125I-α-BgTx (a final concentration of 2.5 nm) to triplicate samples (2–3 oocytes/sample) in a total volume of 100 μl. Membranes were preequilibrated for 15 min with appropriate concentrations of dTC, ACh, or other ligands before the addition of125I-α-BgTx, and then after a 20-min incubation, the reactions were stopped by adding 1 μm unlabeled α-BgTx. Under these conditions, in the absence of competing ligands125I-α-BgTx binding was ≈30% of equilibrium. Nonspecific binding of 125I-α-BgTx to wild-type and mutant receptors was determined either in the presence of 100 μm dTC (24 ± 6% of total binding,n = 8 experiments) or 100 mm ACh (27 ± 15% of total binding, n = 8 experiments) for dTC and ACh inhibition, respectively. 15–30 injected oocytes were incubated in 2 ml of low Ca2+ ND96 (plus 50 μg/ml gentamicin) containing 0.1–0.5 mCi/ml [35S]methonine/cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 24-well plates at 18 °C for at least 48 h before use. Ten to fifteen healthy oocytes were selected and washed five times with 2 ml of low Ca2+ ND96 to remove excess [35S]Met/Cys before the addition of α-BgTx (2.5–5 nm) to label surface receptors in a final volume of 1 ml. After a 2-h incubation, unbound α-BgTx was removed by washing oocytes three times with 1 ml of low Ca2+ ND96. The oocytes were then used to prepare membranes containing α-BgTx-labeled surface receptors. To characterize internal receptors, membranes containing nonradioactive α-BgTx-prelabeled surface nAChRs were incubated with α-BgTx (2.5–5 nm) for another 2 h followed by washing. The membranes prepared in this manner contain both α-BgTx-labeled surface and internal nAChRs and are designated as “total receptors.” The membranes containing either surface or total receptors were then resuspended in HB buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. After solubilization for 30 min, the extracts were treated with 1% Immunoprecipitin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 4 °C for 20 min and centrifuged for 1 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. Immunoprecipitin-pretreated supernatants were then collected and incubated with an excess amount of rabbit anti-α-BgTx antibody at 4 °C overnight. After overnight incubation, Immunoprecipitin (1%) was added to the nAChR-antibody complexes and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The samples were then spun in a microcentrifuge for 1 min, and the supernatants were discarded. The immunoprecipitate was washed four times with HB buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin and once with HB buffer containing 0.1% SDS and 0.05% Triton X-100 (without bovine serum albumin). After the last wash, the pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and incubated at room temperature for 20–30 min. The samples were electrophoresed on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After staining with Coomassie Blue and destaining, the gels were soaked in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min, dried at 65 °C for 2 h, and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C for 24 h. To characterize surface nAChRs, 15–30 injected intact oocytes were incubated with 2.5 nm125I-α-BgTx for 2 h followed by a wash, and oocyte membranes were then prepared as described above. The membranes were then solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 in a final volume of 200 μl of HB buffer and centrifuged in a Ti 42.2 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatants (≈180 μl) were saved and used for sedimentation analysis. For total nAChRs, oocyte membranes containing surface nAChRs prelabeled by125I-α-BgTx were then incubated with 2.5 nm125I-α-BgTx for another 2 h. After a 2-h incubation, membranes were washed and solubilized as described above. 180-μl extracts from 10–15 oocytes containing either surface or total receptors were sedimented on a 10-ml 3–30% sucrose gradient (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 40,000 rpm in a SW 45 rotor (Beckman) for 22 h at 4 °C. 200-μl extracts from Torpedo membranes prelabeled with125I-α-BgTx were used as the control for monomeric (9.5 S) and dimeric nAChR (13 S), and free 125I-α-BgTx (1.7 S), alkaline phosphatase (6.1 S), and β-galactosidase (15.9 S) were used as standards for sedimentation coefficients. Fractions (200 μl) were collected and counted on a γ counter. Currents elicited by ACh were measured using a standard two-electrode voltage clamp (Oocyte Clamp OC-725B, Warner Instrument Corp.) at a holding potential of −70 mV. Electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances of 0.5–1.5 megaohms. The recording chamber (about 150 μl in volume) was perfused continually by gravity with low Ca2+ ND96 (plus 1 μm atropine, pH 7.6). Appropriate concentrations of ACh (or other agonists) in the absence or presence of antagonists were applied through solenoid valves into the recording chamber for 3–5 s. For some experiments, oocytes were preincubated with dTC by perfusing the oocytes for ∼1 min with dTC in low Ca2+ ND96 before application for 5 s of solution containing ACh with the same concentration of dTC. The concentration-dependent inhibition of 125I-α-BgTx binding by agonists and antagonists was fit according to two models as follows. f=100/(1+([X]/IC50)n)Equation 1 where [X] is the concentration of inhibitor, n is the Hill coefficient, and IC50 is the inhibitor concentration reducing the initial rate of 125I-α-BgTx binding by 50% andf={50/(1+([X]/KH))}+{50/(1+([X]/KL))}Equation 2 where [X] is the concentration of competing ligand,K H and KL are the ligand affinities for the high and low affinity binding sites, respectively. This equation is based on the assumption that α-BgTx binds at equal rates to the two sites. For receptor activation, concentration-response curves for ACh and other agonists were fit to the following equation.I/Imax={1+(Kap/[ACh])n}−1Equation 3 where I and I max are the currents at a given concentration of ACh and the maximal value, respectively, and K ap is the concentration of ACh required for half-maximal current. Because high concentrations of ACh do not result in a concentration-independent maximal response (due to desensitization and/or channel block), the Hill coefficients (n H ) for the agonist dose-response relations were estimated from the slope of plots of log I versuslog[agonist] at currents less than 20% of the maximal response for each agonist. The dose-dependent inhibition of ACh-induced currents by antagonists was fit according to Equation 1 above. SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific) was used for nonlinear least squares fit of the data, and the S.E. of the parameter fits are indicated in the Tables. Torpedo nAChRs were expressed inXenopus oocytes by injection of cRNAs encoding α, β, γ, and δ subunits. We characterized the equilibrium binding of antagonists and agonists by their inhibition of125I-α-BgTx binding to Torpedo nAChRs in membranes isolated from oocyte homogenates. dTC inhibited125I-α-BgTx binding to wild-type (α2βγδ) nAChRs in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 440 ± 30 nm (Hill coefficient, n H = 0.50 ± 0.01) (Fig. 1 A, see “Experimental Procedures”). These data were well fit by a two-site model with K H = 50 nm(high affinity site) and KL = 4 μm(low affinity site) (see Table I), and the data were consistent with the equilibrium binding of [3H]dTC to nAChRs in Torpedo membranes (5Pedersen S.E. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 6Neubig R.R. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5464-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and with the assumption that 125I-α-BgTx binds to the two agonist sites with equal association rate constants. dTC binds to δ-less (α2βγ2) receptors with an IC50 of 140 nm and to γ-less (α2βδ2) receptors with an IC50 of 8 μm, consistent with the notion that for dTC the high and low affinity sites are formed at the α-γ and α-δ interfaces, respectively (Fig. 1 A, inset, and Table I). We determined the effects of the γW55L and δW57L mutations on 125I-α-BgTx binding and on dTC competition with 125I-α-BgTx binding. Control experiments indicated that γW55L and δW57L had no effect on 125I-α-BgTx binding affinity (data not shown). Despite the decrease of dTC potency as an inhibitor of nAChRs containing γW55L (Ref. 13O'Leary M.E. Filatov G.N. White M.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C648-C653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and see below), nAChRs containing either a γW55L (γm), a δW57L (δm) subunit, or both mutant subunits (α2βγmδm) had the same binding affinities for dTC as wild-type receptors (Fig. 1 A). The concentration dependence for dTC inhibition of125I-α-BgTx binding to mutant receptors was clearly different from that observed for either γ-less or δ-less nAChRs (Fig. 1, inset), which indicates that the lack of effect of the mutations on dTC binding is not due to omission of either γm or δm subunit. Thus, substitution of γTrp-55 or δTrp-57 by leucine has no effect on dTC binding affinity. These tryptophan residues are, however, located near the agonist binding sites because they can be affinity-photolabeled by [3H]dTC and [3H]nicotine (10Chiara D.C. Cohen J.B. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab Non-linear least squares fit of data in Figs. 1, A andB according to Equations 1 and 2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). In contrast to what was observed for dTC binding, γW55L and δW57L dramatically increased the IC50 for ACh competition against125I-α-BgTx binding to nAChRs. ACh inhibited125I-α-BgTx binding to the wild-type TorpedonAChR expressed in oocytes in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 340 nm and a Hill coefficient of 0.6 (Fig. 1 B). γW55L and δW57L increased the IC50 for ACh binding by 62- and 8-fold, respectively, and for the double mutant (α2βγmδm), the IC50 was 530-fold higher than for wild-type receptor (Fig. 1 B). The IC50 values for ACh binding to either α2β(γm)2 or α2β(δm)2 receptors were each increased by about 1,300-fold (Fig. 1 B). The concentration dependence of ACh inhibition of 125I-α-BgTx binding reflects the binding of both ACh and 125I-α-BgTx to two agonist binding sites. For the wild-type receptor this concentration dependence was well fit by a two-site model with K H of 55 nm and KL of 2.7 μm (Table I). ACh bound to the γW55L-containing receptor with K H of 750 nm andKL of 360 μm. For the δW57L-containing receptor, ACh bound with K H of 140 nm and KL of 66 μm. The effects of the γW55L and δW57L mutations on ACh binding were clearly different than that observed for nAChRs lacking either γ subunit (γ-less, α2βδ2, IC50 = 0.8 μm) or δ subunit (δ-less, α2βγ2, IC50 = 0.3 μm), which were characterized by inhibition curves similar to wild-type (Fig. 1 B, inset and TableI). As judged by inhibition of 125I-α-BgTx binding, ACh binding to Torpedo nAChRs expressed in oocytes also differed from the binding to native nAChRs in Torpedo membranes (IC50 = 25 nm and a Hill coefficient of 0.9. (Fig. 1 B)). The observed equilibrium binding reflects the binding affinity of the ACh sites in the desensitized nAChR and the conformational equilibrium between resting and desensitized states. To test whether the leucine substitution had a predominant effect on the latter parameter, we examined the effect of proadifen, a desensitizing noncompetitive antagonist (24Boyd N.D. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4023-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), on the ACh equilibrium binding function. For wild-type and α2βγmδm, proadifen produced only a modest (less than 3-fold) left shift of the ACh equilibrium binding function (data not shown), as it does for nAChRs in membranes from Torpedo electric organ (24Boyd N.D. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4023-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), but in contrast to the 100-fold enhancement of ACh affinity seen for mouse muscle nAChR in the presence of proadifen (20Prince R.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25770-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that the perturbation of ACh binding resulted from nAChRs of altered subunit composition, we examined both the size and subunit composition of the wild-type and mutant nAChRs formed in our expression system. nAChR biosynthetic assembly intermediates can form high affinity binding sites for 125I-α-BgTx (α subunit alone) or agonists and competitive antagonists (α/γ or α/δ subunit pairs) (4Blount P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1989; 3: 349-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The binding studies described above were performed with membranes isolated from oocyte homogenates that contain both surface receptors and receptors from intracellular membranes. This internal pool may contain agonist binding sites that are very different than those found in the pentameric nAChRs, since the internal α-BgTx binding sites may include nAChR assembly intermediates. We therefore compared surface and internal receptors in oocyte membranes by examining both the size(s) of the 125I-α-BgTx binding components by sedimentation analysis and the subunit composition by biosynthetic labeling and immunoprecipitation. Sucrose density gradient analysis was carried out to determine the size(s) of the receptors expressed in oocytes. To label surface nAChRs, intact oocytes were incubated with 125I-α-BgTx before isolation of oocyte membranes, and isolated membranes were reincubated in 125I-α-BgTx to label all sites made accessible after homogenization of the oocytes (total receptors). Membranes were extracted in 1% Triton X-100, and the sedimentation properties of these nAChRs were compared (Fig. 2) with125I-α-BgTx-labeled native Torpedo nAChRs (monomer, 9.5 S; dimer, 13 S) (Fig. 2 A). In the membranes isolated from oocyte homogenates, there were 3–5 times more total125I-α-BgTx sites (Fig. 2, B–E, closed circles) than surface sites (Fig. 2, B–E, open circles). However, the major populations of both surface and total125I-α-BgTx binding sites in oocyte membranes were pentameric nAChRs, as revealed by a characteristic large peak of125I at 9.5S for wild-type as well as mutant nAChRs (γm, δm, γmδm, Fig. 2, B–E). In some experiments (Figs. 2, Band D), total receptors in oocyte membranes also yielded a much smaller peak of 125I at 5.0 S, which has been shown previously to be subunit pairs of either αγ or αδ subunits (25Saedi M.S. Conroy W.G. Lindstrom J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1007-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The peak at 1.7 S in all our experiments represented free125I-α-BgTx. Thus, as for wild-type nAChRs, binding of125I-α-BgTx to each of these mutants in membrane homogenates will reflect binding to assembled, pentameric nAChRs, and partial assembly cannot account for the altered ACh binding seen for the mutant nAChRs. When the mutant γ subunit was coexpressed with wild-type α and β subunits without the δ subunit (α2β(γm)2,"

The yeast Tup1p repressor is one of only a few non-enzyme proteins known to interact directly with the amino-terminal tail domains of histones H3 and H4 that are subject to acetylation. We demonstrated previously that Tup1p interacts poorly with more highly acetylated isoforms of these histonesin vitro. Here we show that two separate classes of promoters repressed by Tup1p are associated with underacetylated histones in vivo. This decreased histone acetylation is dependent upon Tup1p and its partner Ssn6p and is localized to sequences near the point of Tup1p-Ssn6p recruitment. Increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4 is observed upon activation of these genes, but this increase is not dependent on transcription per se. Direct recruitment of Tup1p-Ssn6p complexes via fusion of Tup1p to the lexA DNA binding domain is sufficient to confer repression and induce decreased acetylation of H3 and H4 at a target promoter. Taken together, our results suggest that stable decreases in histone acetylation levels are directed and/or maintained by the Tup1p-Ssn6p repressor complex.

TUP1 and SSN6 are required for the repression of several diverse families of genes in yeast, including cell type-specific genes (regulated by the α2 and a1/α2 repressors), as well as genes responsive to different physiological conditions including SUC2 (responsive to change in carbon source), RNR3 (responsive to DNA damage), andANB1 (responsive to oxygen levels), among others (see Ref. 1Roth S.Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholarfor review and Ref. 2Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Neither Ssn6p nor Tup1p binds directly to DNA, but these proteins are recruited to promoters through interactions with sequence-specific DNA binding factors such as the α2 repressor (3Komachi K. Redd M.J. Johnson A.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2857-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 4Smith R.L. Redd M.J. Johnson A.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and Crt1p (2Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Bypass of the DNA binding factor by fusion of Ssn6p or Tup1p to a heterologous lexA DNA binding domain demonstrates that these proteins can directly orchestrate repression. Ssn6p-lexA fusions require Tup1p (5Keleher C.A. Redd M.J. Schultz J. Carlson M. Johnson A.D. Cell. 1992; 68: 709-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) to confer repression of an artificial promoter containing lexA operator sequences. However, Tup1p-lexA fusions can confer repression in the absence of Ssn6p (6Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), suggesting that Tup1p is the dominant repressor moiety in the complex. The ability of Tup1p-Ssn6p to regulate many diverse genes indicates that these complexes may interact with some common promoter component, such as a basal transcription factor or a component of chromatin. Indeed, two models have been proposed to explain how Tup1p-Ssn6p complexes confer repression. The first is based on studies that indicate that a number of other factors necessary for repression, including Sin4p (7Chen S. West Jr., R.W. Johnson S.L. Gans H. Kruger B. Ma J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 8Jiang Y.W. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4503-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), Sin3p/Rpd1p (9Vidal M.

Biol. 1997; 13: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and Srb8p/Are2p (14Wahi M. Komachi K. Johnson A.D. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), are associated with subcomplexes within the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (13Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Thus, Tup1p-Ssn6p may inhibit transcription through direct interactions with one or more of these transcription factors. Accordingly, partial repression (2–4-fold) can be achieved in vitro in the presence of just the basal transcription machinery, Ssn6p, and Tup1p (15Herschbach B.M. Arnaud M.B. Johnson A.D. Nature. 1994; 370: 309-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Redd M.J. Arnaud M.B. Johnson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11193-11197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). An alternative model suggests that Tup1p-Ssn6p directs repression through modulation of chromatin structure. Tup1p interacts directly with the amino-terminal tail domains of histones H3 and H4 in vitro (17Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), and mutations in these histone domains synergistically reduce repression of multiple classes of Tup1p-regulated genes in vivo (17Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 18Huang L. Zhang W. Roth S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6555-6562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the domain in Tup1p that is required for interaction with the histones overlaps independently defined repression domains (6Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Thus, Tup1p-Ssn6p may affect repression through interactions with components of chromatin that lead to decreased accessibility of promoter regions. These two models for Tup1p-Ssn6p repression may coincide. Complete repression could require interactions with both the basal transcription machinery and the histones. For example, Tup1p-Ssn6p complexes might first halt transcription by altering the activity of the basal apparatus and then maintain the repressed state through organization of chromatin. One aspect of chromatin that is often modulated in active and repressed chromatin domains is histone acetylation. Lysine residues in the amino-terminal domains of all four core histones are subject to this posttranslational modification. Increased histone acetylation is often correlated with increased gene expression, whereas decreased acetylation is correlated with decreased transcription. The identification of several transcriptional regulators as histone acetylases or deacetylases in the last few years has provided a molecular basis for this correlation (see Refs. 19Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 20Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 21Mizzen C.A. Allis C.D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 22Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar, 23Ayer D.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar for recent reviews). We have shown previously that Tup1p binding to the amino-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4 in vitro is inhibited by high levels of acetylation (17Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 24Edmondson D.G. Zhang W. Watson A. Xu W. Bone J.R., Yu, Y. Stillman D. Roth S.Y. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Tup1p binding, and thus repression, may be modulated by changes in histone acetylationin vivo. If so, then genes regulated by Tup1p should be associated with different levels of acetylated histones under conditions of repression and activation. Consistent with this idea, we report here that genes repressed by Tup1p are associated with underacetylated forms of histones H3 and H4 in vivo. These same genes are associated with more highly acetylated histones when repression is relieved, and the genes are activated. The difference in these acetylation states is not dependent upon transcription per se but does require Tup1p. We have also found that deacetylation of histones H3 and H4 accompanies reporter gene repression upon targeted recruitment of Tup1p. These data indicate that Tup1p repression is linked mechanistically to changes in histone acetylation. The strains FY23, FY24, FY716, FY24Δtup1, and FY24Δssn6 have been described previously (25Hirschhorn J.N. Brown S.A. Clark C.D. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2288-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar,26Cooper J.P. Roth S.Y. Simpson R.T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1400-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Strains FY23 and FY24 carrying the TALS plasmid (FY23T and FY24T) have been described previously (26Cooper J.P. Roth S.Y. Simpson R.T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1400-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The FY716Δtup1 strain was created by transformation of strain FY716 with the plasmid tup1Δ406 cut with AvrII (26Cooper J.P. Roth S.Y. Simpson R.T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1400-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) followed by selection for uracil auxotrophy. Disruption of the TUP1 gene was confirmed by Southern blot. All strains were grown according to standard procedures (27Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1990Google Scholar) in either rich media or selective media, synthetic dextrose media supplemented with the appropriate amino acids. Derepression of theSUC2 gene was carried out as described previously (25Hirschhorn J.N. Brown S.A. Clark C.D. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2288-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Yeast transformations were carried out by the method of Hill and Griffiths (28Hill J. Griffiths I.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5791Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The MFA2.1 integrated lacZ reporter strain was created by transformation of linearized plasmid pMFA2.1 into strain TY3 (MATa ura3–52 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 trp1-Δ6, which is isogenic to FY251) along with pRS306 (29Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transformants were selected for uracil prototrophy, and colony lift assays were performed to identify strains expressing high levels of β-galactosidase (27Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1990Google Scholar). Colonies positive for lacZ expression were then screened by Southern blot to confirm insertion of the reporter gene at the MFA2 locus. MFA2.1 derivatives containing deletions of either the TUP1 gene or theSSN6 gene were created by the method of Güldeneret al. (30Güldener U. Heck S. Fiedler T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). The MFA2.1 strain and its Δtup1 orΔssn6 derivatives were used to create the strains used to test the effects of artificial recruitment of Tup1p and Ssn6p by transformation of the respective lexA-Tup1p and lexA-Ssn6p expression vectors. Yeast strains were grown to log phase (between 2.5 and 5.0 × 107 cells/ml) in liquid culture in synthetic dextrose media to measure expression of the MFA2.1 lacZ reporter gene. Assays were carried out by the method of Rose (27Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1990Google Scholar). The Tup1p-lexA expression vector was created by insertion of the Tup1 coding sequence into plasmid pSH2.1 at theSalI site. The Ssn6p-lexA expression vector was created by insertion of a fragment of the SSN6 gene encoding the carboxyl-terminal 335 amino acids containing the TPR repeat region into plasmid pBTM116. The MFA2.1 plasmid was created by insertion of an oligonucleotide containing the bipartite lexA operator consensus sequence into the plasmid pSM38 (31Michaelis S. Herskowitz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) at the SphI site. Total yeast RNA was prepared as described previously (27Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1990Google Scholar), and specific transcripts were quantitated using an S1 nuclease protection protocol. 1D. Stillman, personal communication. A32P-labeled antisense SUC2 oligonucleotide (corresponding to reverse complement of +90 to +145 of theSUC2 open reading frame) was radioactively labeled and hybridized overnight at 55 °C in a 50-μl reaction containing 50 μg of total yeast RNA, 38 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Each reaction contained 0.1 pmol of the anti-SUC2oligonucleotide as well as 0.1 pmol of an antisense ACT1oligonucleotide (corresponding to the reverse complement of +356 to +392 of the ACT1 open reading frame) as an internal control. After hybridization, S1 digestion was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C by adding 450 μl of S1 digest buffer to the hybridization reaction. S1 digest buffer contains 50 units of S1 nuclease (Life Technologies, Inc.), 330 mm NaCl, 66 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 2.2 mm ZnCl2, and 0.01% Triton X-100. The reaction was halted by the addition of 5 μl of 0.5m EDTA and 5 μl of 10 mg/ml yeast tRNA. Protected fragments were ethanol-precipitated and separated on an 8% denaturing acrylamide gel. The protected band corresponding to the SUC2transcript was quantitated with a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and normalized relative to the levels ofACT1 RNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed essentially as described previously (32Strahl-Bolsinger S. Hecht A. Luo K. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Antibodies specific to H3 Ac9,14 were kindly provided by C. D. Allis (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA) (33Braunstein M. Sobel R.E. Allis C.D. Turner B.M. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4349-4356Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Antibodies specific to H3 Ac9,18 and unacetylated H3 have been described previously (17Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar).

Antibodies recognizing acetylated histone H4 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Chromatin was sheared to an average size of 150–300 base pairs by sonication. TALS chromatin was reduced to an approximate average size of 180 base pairs by digestion with 400 units of micrococcal nuclease (Worthington) for 5 min at 37 °C. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were performed at least twice, and representative experiments are depicted in the figures. Whole cell extracts were generated from 250 ml of log-phase culture. Chromatin corresponding to 1 × 108 cell equivalents of whole cell extract was combined in a final volume of 0.25 ml with the following volumes of antisera: 20 μl of anti-H3; 2.5 μl of anti H3 Ac9,14; 20 μl of anti-H3 Ac9,18; 15 μl of anti-H4; and 15 μl of anti-acetylated H4 (Upstate Biotechnology). Antibody incubations were carried out overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Immune complexes were purified after a 1-h incubation (4 °C with rotation) with 60 μl of protein A-Sephadex beads (1:1 slurry; Pharmacia CL4B). Washes and DNA purification were performed as described previously (32Strahl-Bolsinger S. Hecht A. Luo K. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). DNA purified from immunoprecipitated complexes was slot-blotted onto nylon membrane (GeneScreen Plus; DuPont) according to the manufacturer's instructions and hybridized with gene-specific probes (35Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). Probes were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)2 from yeast strain FY24T genomic DNA using primer sets specific for each gene being analyzed (the following probes were generated by PCR amplification of the indicated nucleotides: TALS A, nucleotides 1609 to 59 of TALS plasmid; TALS B, 121–370; TALS C, 380–623; TALS D, 662–932; TALS E, 942–1126; TALS F, 1194–1431; ACT1 probe, −289 to +66, with +1 representing the start of translation of ACT1;MFA2, −154 to +101; STE6, −144 to −18;SUC2 A, −399 to −218; and SUC2 B, +76 to +329). Gel-purified PCR products were radioactively labeled using a modification of the random primed labeling technique (36Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar) substituting sequence-specific primers for random hexamers. DNA on slot blots was quantitated with a Storm 840 PhosphorImager. Data presented were normalized against input DNA. Quantitation of MFA2.1 DNA was carried out by PCR essentially as described in Ref. 32Strahl-Bolsinger S. Hecht A. Luo K. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar. The promoter region ofMFA2.1 (nucleotides −286 to −68, primer sequences are available upon request) adjacent to the lexA operator was amplified from DNA derived from chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. PCR products were run on 7% acrylamide gels and stained with SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:10,000 (in 1× Tris borate-EDTA buffer, pH 7.5) for 30 min. Quantitation was carried out after scanning the gel on a Storm 840 PhosphorImager. Multiple dilutions were performed to ensure the linearity of the assay, and data presented were normalized relative to input DNA. We examined histone acetylation levels associated with Tup1p-Ssn6p-regulated genes under conditions of repression and activation using chromatin immunoprecipitation (32Strahl-Bolsinger S. Hecht A. Luo K. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar,37Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R.

Jambeck P. Churchill M.E. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Cells were grown under conditions of repression or activation specific for each gene and then fixed with formaldehyde to cross-link proteins to DNA. The cross-linked chromatin was reduced to an average length of 150–300 base pairs. The protein-DNA complexes were then immunoprecipitated using antibodies recognizing specific acetylated isoforms of histone H3, unacetylated H3, acetylated H4, or unacetylated H4. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by slot blot hybridization using gene-specific probes. This method allows quantitation of small changes in histone acetylation at a specific locus that accompany alterations in transcriptional competence. Our initial experiments involved analysis of the acetylation state of the TALS plasmid, a yeast episome containing the α2/Mcm1 operator inserted into the TRP1/ARS1 plasmid upstream of the TRP1 gene. The α2/Mcm1 operator, which is derived from the promoter of the acell-specific STE6 gene, is sufficient to confer Tup1p-Ssn6p-mediated repression to downstream genes in α cells (40Johnson A.D. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1985; 42: 237-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 41Roth S.Y. Dean A. Simpson R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2247-2260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The chromatin structure of the TALS plasmid has been extensively mapped in a and α cells (41Roth S.Y. Dean A. Simpson R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2247-2260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its structure and regulation are representative of natural acell-specific genes (42Shimizu M. Roth S.Y. Szent-Gyorgyi C. Simpson R.T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3033-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were performed using chromatin fragments isolated from a cells (condition of activation), α cells (condition of repression), or α cells bearing a disruption of theTUP1 gene (which abolishes repression in α cells). The immunoprecipitated DNA was probed with specific regions of the TALS plasmid (Fig. 1, probes A–F). Data obtained with probe A indicate that sequences adjacent to the α2/Mcm1 operator are enriched in H3 acetylated at lysine 9 and/or 18 ina cells relative to α cells (Fig. 1 B). We consistently observe that acetylation of histones associated with this region of TALS is about three times higher in a cells than in α cells (4.5 versus 1.5, Fig. 1, B andC). The same trend and relative degree of acetylation change were observed in immunoprecipitations using an antisera specific for H3 acetylated at lysine 9 and/or 14 (data not shown). Additionally, deletion of TUP1 leads to hyperacetylation of this region of TALS in α cells to an extent even greater than that observed in wild-type a cells (increase in histone acetylation relative to wild-type α cells = 7.3; 11 versus 1.5, Fig.1 B). A difference in acetylation of histone H3 betweena and α cells is not observed at the ACT1locus, a gene not subject to regulation by Tup1p (data not shown). This indicates that the changes we see at TALS do not simply reflect a global, cell type-specific difference in acetylation levels. To determine the extent of the region of altered H3 acetylation relative to the location of the α2/Mcm1 operator (the point of Tup1p-Ssn6p recruitment), immunoprecipitated DNA was probed with sequences specific for other regions of the TALS plasmid (Fig.1 C). In α cells (Fig. 1 C, ░), the lowest levels of H3 acetylation are associated with sequences adjacent to either side of the α2/MCM1 operator (probes A, F, and E), whereas increased acetylation is associated with more distal sequences (probes B, C, and D). Increased acetylation is observed for all probes (with the exception of probe E) in chromatin isolated from acells, with the highest levels occurring in the region of theTRP1 gene (probes A–C). The largest changes in relative acetylation between a and α cells occur at regions of TALS directly adjacent to the α2/MCM1 operator (probes A and F, Fig.1 C). We have also observed similar decreases in acetylation of histone H3 associated with sequences proximal to the α2/Mcm1 operator in the promoters of the endogenous STE6 andMFA2 genes (data not shown). Thus, Tup1p-Ssn6p-dependent repression of cell type-specific genes is associated with localized decreases in histone H3 acetylation. Deacetylation of histone H4 has been observed concomitant with transcriptional repression mediated via other yeast repressor complexes (43Kadosh D. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5121-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 44Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Suka N. Turner B.M. Grunstein M. Nature. 1998; 392: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we examined the acetylation state of histone H4 in TALS chromatin purified from eithera cells, α cells, or α cells containing a deletion of the TUP1 gene. Similar to the loss of H3 acetylation observed above, we detected a reproducible 2-fold decrease in acetylation of histone H4 in TALS chromatin (region A) from α cells as compared with a cells (Fig. 1 D). Again, as observed for H3, this change in acetylation was contingent upon theTUP1 gene (Fig. 1 D). These data suggest that recruitment of Tup1p-Ssn6p in α cells leads to localized decreases in both H3 and H4 acetylation levels. To further examine the link between Tup1p-Ssn6p repression and decreased histone acetylation, we examined a non-cell type-specific gene regulated by this corepressor. SUC2encodes the enzyme invertase, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of sucrose and is repressed when yeast are grown in high concentrations of glucose (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 3; Refs. 45Carlson M. Osmond B.C. Botstein D. Genetics. 1981; 98: 25-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 46Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Glucose repression of SUC2 is mediated by a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, Mig1p, which recruits Tup1p and Ssn6p to the SUC2 promoter (47Treitel M.A. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3132-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). SUC2 is expressed constitutively in strains lacking either TUP1 orSSN6, even when strains are grown under repressing conditions (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5and 6; Refs. 48Carlson M. Osmond B.C. Neigeborn L. Botstein D. Genetics. 1984; 107: 19-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Neigeborn L. Carlson M. Genetics. 1984; 108: 845-858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Sarokin L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell.

Consistent with the results described above, decreased levels of H3 acetylation are associated with SUC2 repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that a fragment of theSUC2 promoter adjacent to the Mig1p binding site is associated with decreased acetylation of H3 (approximately 2-fold lower) under repressing conditions (high glucose) as compared with derepressing conditions (low glucose), coincident with activation ofSUC2 (Fig. 2 B). As observed in TALS chromatin, the changes in acetylation that are observed at the SUC2 locus are localized to a region proximal to the site of Tup1p-Ssn6p recruitment. Use of a probe specific for a portion of the SUC2 coding sequence does not reveal a change in acetylation of H3 in chromatin more distal to the Mig1p binding site (Fig. 2 C). The changes in acetylation we observe might be due to an active increase in H3 acetylation upon transcription of SUC2, to an active decrease in acetylation upon recruitment of Tup1p-Ssn6p, or both. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined H3 acetylation in a strain (FY716) containing a nontranscribed allele ofSUC2, suc2-104, that contains a mutated TATA box (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and 4; Ref. 25Hirschhorn J.N. Brown S.A. Clark C.D. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2288-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). We found that acetylation of H3 is still increased in the promoter region of this allele under derepressing conditions (Fig. 2 B, ΔTATA). Indeed, the levels of H3 acetylation observed for this allele in both high and low glucose are nearly identical to those observed for wild-type SUC2. Thus, the increased acetylation of H3 observed at the SUC2 promoter in low glucose is not dependent upon transcription per se. To determine whether the decreased H3 acetylation observed uponSUC2 repression in high glucose is dependent on Tup1p and Ssn6p, we examined acetylation of H3 associated with theSUC2 promoter in strains lacking either TUP1 orSSN6. We found increased acetylation of H3 in this region in both of these mutant strains, even when strains were grown under repressing, high glucose conditions (Fig. 2 B). Again, this increased acetylation is not caused by increased transcription because acetylation of the nontranscribed suc2-104 allele is also increased in the absence of Tup1p (data not shown). The above-mentioned data raise the possibility that changes in histone acetylation may be directed by the corepressor complex. Alternatively, changes in acetylation might occur before Tup1p-Ssn6p recruitment, perhaps directed by other proteins required for repression, such as α2/Mcm1 or Mig1p. Others have shown that these recruiting proteins can be bypassed by the fusion of Ssn6p or Tup1p to the lexA DNA binding domain. Ssn6p-lexA and Tup1p-lexA fusion proteins can repress artificial promoters containing multiple lexA operators. Here we examined whether direct recruitment of such fusion proteins is sufficient to direct repression of a more naturala cell-specific promoter containing a single lexA operator, and, if so, whether decreased acetylation of H3 and H4 accompanies this repression. Sequences corresponding to the lexA operator were inserted just upstream of the α2/Mcm1 operator in the promoter region of the endogenous MFA2 gene (see “Experimental Procedures”). This derivative (MFA2.1) is still susceptible to Tup1p-Ssn6p repression in α cells but is not repressed in a cells, as expected. Insertion of the lexA operator sequences therefore did not disrupt the natural function or regulation of this promoter. To test the ability of Ssn6p or Tup1p to direct changes in the expression of MFA2.1, we expressed Ssn6p-lexA or Tup1p-lexA fusion proteins in a cells. As a control, the lexA DNA binding domain alone (lexA-DBD) was expressed separately in these same cells. The lexA DNA binding domain could not repressMFA2.1 under any conditions, as expected (Fig.3 B). However, Tup1p-lexA was able to confer efficient repression of this gene even in the absence of endogenous TUP1 or SSN6 (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, Ssn6p-lexA could only partially direct repression ofMFA2.1, and this repression required endogenousTUP1 but not SSN6 (Fig. 3 B). These findings are consistent with previous reports by others, which indicate that repression by Ssn6p requires Tup1p, but Tup1p-mediated repression can occur independently of Ssn6p (6Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To determine whether direct recruitment of Tup1p is sufficient to induce decreased acetylation of H3 and H4, we again performed chromatin immunoprecipitations. Decreased acetylation of H3 and H4 associated with MFA2.1 promoter sequences was observed upon recruitment of Tup1p-lexA (Fig. 4, ░) relative to recruitment of the lexA DNA binding domain alone (▪), and this decreased acetylation did not require endogenous Tup1p. Direct recruitment of Ssn6p, however, was not sufficient to confer a stable decrease in H3 or H4 acetylation at the MFA2.1 promoter, consistent with the inefficient repression conferred by this fusion protein (data not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that direct recruitment of Tup1 is sufficient to induce decreased histone acetylation associated with repression of target promoters, furthering the link between repression and chromatin remodeling in vivo. Histone acetylation is thought to alter gene expression by altering DNA-histone interactions within single nucleosomes and by altering nucleosome-nucleosome interactions involved in higher order chromatin packing. Histone acetylation is likely to affect interactions of non-histone regulatory proteins with chromatin as well, although such effects are understudied at present. Tup1p is one of only a few proteins determined to interact directly with the amino-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4. Others include Sir3p and Sir4p, which are thought to facilitate formation of heterochromatic-like structures associated with gene silencing in yeast. Proteins like Tup1p and the Sir proteins may be critical in establishing the architecture and functions of particular chromatin domains. Mutations in the amino-terminal regions of H3 or H4 that disrupt Tup1p-histone interactions synergistically compromise Tup1p repression (17Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 24Edmondson D.G. Zhang W. Watson A. Xu W. Bone J.R., Yu, Y. Stillman D. Roth S.Y. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These synergistic effects support an important, if redundant, role for these histones in Tup1p functions in vivo. Acetylation of H3 and H4 appears to antagonize Tup1p functions. Tup1p binds most favorably to underacetylated forms of H3 and H4 in vitro, and loss of class I histone deacetylase activities that alter the acetylation state of these histones leads to loss of repression in vivo (17Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 24Edmondson D.G. Zhang W. Watson A. Xu W. Bone J.R., Yu, Y. Stillman D. Roth S.Y.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2737-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Moreover, we show here that underacetylation of histones H3 and H4 accompanies Tup1p repression of both an a cell-specific gene andSUC2. We have observed a similar decrease in acetylation of these histones associated with repression of the DNA damage-inducible gene RNR3 by Tup1p-Ssn6p. 3J. R. Bone, unpublished observations. Thus, at least three distinct classes of Tup1p-regulated genes exhibit a change in the acetylation state of associated histones. Our finding that direct recruitment of Tup1p leads to decreased histone acetylation of target promoters is also consistent with our recent discovery that the corepressor complex is associated with multiple histone deacetylase activities in vivo (54Watson A.D. Edmondson D.G. Bone J.R. Mukai Y., Yu, Y. Du W. Stillman D.J. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2737-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The differential acetylation we observe associated with the nontranscribed suc2-104 allele indicates that changes in acetylation of histones associated with Tup1p-regulated genes do not result from a change in transcription states but rather occur at an upstream step. The increased acetylation we observe under activating conditions might be directed by histone acetyltransferase activities that are recruited by transactivators that bind to the upstream activating sequences in the SUC2promoter even in the absence of a functional TATA box. Even so, the Tup1p-Ssn6p-dependent decrease in histone acetylation that we observe under repressing conditions indicates that these activities are either limited in function by Tup1p-Ssn6p or counteracted by opposing histone deacetylase activities recruited by the corepressor complex. The underacetylated state might be further stabilized by Tup1p-histone interactions, which could limit reacetylation of the histone tails. Histone deacetylase recruitment and protection of the tails would account for our finding that changes in acetylation are greatest proximal to the site of Tup1p-Ssn6p recruitment.

The recognition of nucleic-acid-sequence homology within the somatic nucleus has an impact on DNA repair and epigenetic control of gene expression. Here we investigate interchromosomal interactions using a non-invasive technique that allows tagging and visualization of DNA sequences in vegetative and meiotic live yeast cells. In non-meiotic cells, chromosomes are ordered in the nucleus, but preferential pairing between homologues is not observed. Association of tagged chromosomal domains occurs irrespective of their genomic location, with some preference for similar chromosomal positions.

In the case of the human RNA polymerase II and III small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes, whose core promoters consist of a proximal sequence element (PSE) and a PSE combined with a TATA box, respectively, the same multisubunit complex is involved in the establishment of RNA polymerase II and III initiation complexes. This factor, the snRNA-activating protein complex or SNAP(c), binds to the PSE of both types of promoters and contains five types of subunits, SNAP190, SNAP50, SNAP45, SNAP43, and SNAP19. SNAP(c) binds cooperatively with both Oct-1, an activator of snRNA promoters, and in the RNA polymerase III snRNA promoters, with TATA-binding protein, which binds to the TATA box located downstream of the PSE. Here we have defined subunit domains required for SNAP(c) subunit-subunit association, and we show that complexes containing little more than the domains mapped here as required for subunit-subunit contacts bind specifically to the PSE.

Within this cascade, inflammatory cytokines and vasoactive mediators promote the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells and a decrease in vascular tone. NO is a vasodilatory gas generated late in the sepsis cascade contributing to the hypotension. The overproduction of NO during sepsis is generated through the NOS2 pathway. NOS2 is a highly inducible gene regulated at the level of gene transcription (1Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lowenstein C.J. Alley E.W.

Transactivation of the NOS2 gene is mediated by members of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB family of transcription factors, which bind to a site in the downstream portion of the NOS2 5′-flanking sequence (−85 to −76) (11Xie Q.-w. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that high mobility group (HMG)-I(Y) protein, an architectural transcription factor that binds to an AT-rich octamer site (−61 to −54) close to the NF-κB binding site in the promoter of the NOS2 gene, acts in concert with p50 and p65 to facilitate NOS2 gene transactivation (12Perrella M.A. Pellacani A.

Architectural transcription factors typically function by modifying the conformation of DNA, and thus provide a framework for the transcriptional machinery to operate. HMG-I(Y) does not drive transcription itself, but it facilitates the assembly of a functional nucleoprotein complex. Our studies revealed that binding of both HMG-I(Y) and NF-κB subunits in the downstream 5′-flanking sequence of the NOS2 gene is essential for the most potent activation of the promoter (12Perrella M.A. Pellacani A. Wiesel P. Chin M.T. Foster L.C. Ibanez M. Hsieh C.-M. Reeves R. Yet S.-F. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9045-9052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, we also demonstrated that HMG-I(Y) itself was up-regulated (both at the mRNA and protein levels) by inflammatory cytokines (13Pellacani A. Chin M.T. Wiesel P. Ibanez M. Patel A. Yet S.-F.

Taken together, these studies suggest that HMG-I(Y) contributes to the transcriptional regulation of NOS2 by inflammatory mediators. Previously, we and others have demonstrated that transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, a pleiotropic growth factor involved in a number of physiologic processes (14Massague J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar, 15Barnard J.A. Lyons R.M. Moses H.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1032: 79-87PubMed Google Scholar, 16Perrella M.A. Jain M.K.

Shore S. Lee M.-E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2054-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The down-regulation of NOS2, but not NOS3, in a rodent model of endotoxemia suggested that NOS inhibition by TGF-β1 is more selective for the inducible isoform of NOS (NOS2) in an experimental model of sepsis (20Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.-M. Lee W.-S. Shieh S. Tsai J.-C. Patterson C. Lowenstein C.J. Long N.C. Haber E. Shore S. Lee M.-E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2054-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In vascular smooth muscle cells, inhibition of NOS2 by TGF-β1 occurs at the level of gene transcription (19Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.-C. Hsieh C.-M. Kourembanas S. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14595-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which transcription of the NOS2 gene is inhibited by TGF-β1 has not been fully elucidated. We have shown previously that HMG-I(Y) is involved in the induction of NOS2 by inflammatory mediators (12Perrella M.A. Pellacani A. Wiesel P. Chin M.T. Foster L.C. Ibanez M. Hsieh C.-M. Reeves R.

However, the ability of HMG-I(Y) to be regulated by inhibitors of NOS2 expression is not known. Furthermore, little is known about the down-regulation of HMG-I(Y) and its subsequent effect on NOS2 gene transcription. The present study was designed to determine (a) whether TGF-β1, an inhibitor of NOS2 expression, also down-regulates the expression of HMG-I(Y), and (b) the functional importance of this TGF-β1-mediated down-regulation of HMG-I(Y) on promoter activity of the NOS2 gene. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)Escherichia coli (serotype 026:B6), actinomycin D, and thioglycollate were all from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Recombinant human interleukin (IL)-1β (Collaborative Biomedical, Bedford, MA), human TGF-β1 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and mouse interferon (IFN)γ (R & D Systems) were stored at −80 °C until use. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC) were harvested from male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) by enzymatic dissociation according to the method of Gunther et al. (21Gunther S. Alexander R.W. Atkinson W.J. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone, Logan, UT), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) (Sigma) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C. RASMC were passaged every 4–5 days, and experiments were performed on cells 4–6 passages from the primary culture. RAW 264.7 cells (mouse macrophage cell line from American Type Culture Collection) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with supplements as described for RASMC, except HEPES was omitted. Peritoneal macrophages were obtained from C57/BL6 male mice (10 weeks of age) and cultured as described previously by Aggarwal and Mehta (22Aggarwal B.B. Mehta K. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 166-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the effect of cytokine treatment on HMG-I(Y) and NOS2 mRNA levels, cells were grown to 80% confluence in 100-mm Petri dishes (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and fed with fresh medium containing either 10 ng/ml IL-1β, 500 ng/ml LPS, 100 units/ml IFNγ, with or without 1 to 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 (IL-1β treatment required a decrease in FBS to 2% to prevent cytokine inactivation). Dose-response experiments were performed to select the optimal concentrations of inflammatory mediators to induce or suppress NOS2 mRNA levels in RASMC or macrophages (data not shown). Cells were harvested after 24 h. The studies performed to assess the in vivo effects of LPS and TGF-β1 treatments, along with experiments to select the appropriate doses, were described in detail elsewhere (20Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.-M. Lee W.-S. Shieh S. Tsai J.-C. Patterson C. Lowenstein C.J. Long N.C. Haber E. Shore S. Lee M.-E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2054-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, rats received LPS alone (4 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) or LPS followed by TGF-β1 (20 μg/kg, intraperitoneally). The rats were sacrificed 10 h later for organ harvest. Total RNA was extracted from rat spleen and cultured peritoneal macrophages by guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction and centrifugation through cesium chloride gradient (23Sambrook J. Fritsh E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA extraction from cultured RASMC and RAW 264.7 cells was performed with the Qiagen RNeasy midi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA was fractionated on a 1.3% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were hybridized at 68 °C for 2 h with32P-labeled mouse HMG-I(Y) (13Pellacani A. Chin M.T. Wiesel P. Ibanez M. Patel A. Yet S.-F. Hsieh C.-M. Paulauskis J.D. Reeves R. Lee M.-E. Perrella M.A. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14595-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) probes. The hybridized filters were then washed in 30 mm sodium chloride, 3 mm sodium citrate, and 0.1% SDS solution at 55 °C, and autoradiographed with Kodak XAR film at −80 °C for 8–12 h or stored on phosphor screens for 2–4 h. To correct for differences in RNA loading, the filters were washed in a 50% formamide solution at 80 °C and rehybridized with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe complementary to 28 S ribosomal RNA. Images were displayed, and radioactivity was measured on a PhosphorImager running the ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). RASMC and RAW 264.7 cells were plated in 150-mm tissue culture dishes (Becton Dickinson). When the cells were 80–90% confluent, 10% FBS medium was replaced with 0.4% bovine serum medium. After 48 h, either vehicle, IL-1β (10 ng/ml, RASMC), or LPS (0.5 μg/ml, RAW 264.7 cells) was added to the cells, in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml). Cells were then collected in phosphate-buffered saline solution 48 h later. HMG-I(Y) protein was obtained from RASMC by acidic extraction followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation (24Lundberg K. Karlson J.R. Ingebrigtsen K. Holtlund J. Lund T. Laland S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1009: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The resulting protein pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of high pressure liquid chromatography-grade water and stored at −20 °C until it was assayed. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) was performed by mixing 10 μl of the resuspended acidic extract with 10 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (2×). After 5 min of boiling, the samples were resolved on a 15% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) overnight (26Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked with 10% skim milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, 0.05% Tween-20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature. It was then incubated with an anti-HMG-I(Y) antibody (N19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 0.1 μg/ml in 5% skim milk in TBS-T for 2 h at room temperature. After a wash in TBS-T, the membrane was incubated with anti-goat, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Santa Cruz) under the same conditions used for the primary antibody. After a final wash in TBS-T, the blot was developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Arlington Heights, IL). Because the extraction also led to the isolation of histone H1, under transfer conditions insufficient for removal of H1 from the gel, we used the histone H1 band to correct for differences in protein loading. After scanning, the intensities of the HMG-I(Y) band and the Coomassie Blue-stained histone H1 band were measured with IMAGE software (National Institutes of Health), and the ratio of the two values was used to represent the normalized intensity of the HMG-I(Y) band. To evaluate the effect of IL-1β and TGF-β1 on HMG-I(Y) transcription in vascular smooth muscle cells, plasmid Δ180 was used (27Ogram S.A. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14235-14342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This construct, cloned into pCAT-Basic, contained the second transcription start site of HMG-I(Y) (27Ogram S.A. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14235-14342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 28Friedmann M. Holth L.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Reeves R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4259-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Plasmid pGL2-Control contained the firefly luciferase gene driven by an SV40 promoter and enhancer. To evaluate NOS2 promoter activity in either vascular smooth muscle cells or RAW 264.7 cells, we inserted 1485 bp of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse NOS2 gene and the first 31 bp after the transcription start site into pGL2-Basic to make iNOS(−1485/+31), as described previously (29Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Tan L. Yet S.F. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13776-13780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of HMG-I(Y) overexpression on NOS2 after treatment with TGF-β1 in both RASMC and RAW 264.7, we constructed the HMGIYpcDNA3 expression vector by cloning the coding sequence of mouse HMG-I(Y) cDNA into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). DNA mass was normalized by adding the control plasmids as needed. Luciferase activity was normalized by cotransfecting pCMV-βgal plasmid (CLONTECH). RASMC were transfected by a diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-dextran method (29Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Tan L. Yet S.F. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13776-13780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In brief, 500,000 cells were plated onto 100-mm tissue culture dishes and allowed to grow for 48–72 h (until 80–90% confluent). Then plasmids Δ180 and pGL2-Control (to correct for differences in transfection efficiency) were added (5 μg each) to the RASMC in a solution containing 500 μg/ml DEAE-dextran. RASMCs were subsequently shocked with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide solution for 1 min and then allowed to recover in medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS. 12 h after transfection, RASMCs were placed in 2% FBS. RASMCs were then stimulated with vehicle, IL-1β (10 ng/ml) alone, or IL-1β plus TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml). After 24 h, cell extracts were prepared by detergent lysis (Promega), and CAT assays were performed as described (30Lee M.E. Bloch K.D. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10446-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Fen Z. Dhadly M.S. Yoshizumi M. Hilkert R.J. Quertermous T. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Lee M.-E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7932-7938Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured with an EG&G AutoLumat LB953 luminometer (Gaithersburg, MD) and the Promega Luciferase Assay system to assess efficiency of transfection. The ratio of CAT to luciferase activity in each sample served as a measure of normalized CAT activity. To investigate the effect of HMG-I(Y) overexpression on TGF-β-mediated inhibition of NOS2 promoter activity by inflammatory stimuli, RASMC or RAW 264.7 were plated in 6-well cell culture plates at 100,000/well and 70,000/well, respectively. The next day, cells were transfected as described above using 1 μg/well iNOS(−1485/+31), 0.8 μg/well pCMV-βgal, and increasing amounts of HMGIYpcDNA3 (1, 2, or 3 μg/well). The corresponding empty vector was added when needed to keep the DNA amount constant throughout the experiment. 18 h after transfection, RAMC were treated with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) alone or IL-1β plus TGF-β1 (0.5 ng/ml). RAW 264.7 were treated with LPS alone (0.5 μg/ml) or LPS plus TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml). After an additional 24 h, cells were harvested by detergent lysis (Promega). In the resulting cell extract, luciferase and β-galactosidase activity was assayed as described previously (32Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.M. Zhou F. Tsai J.C. Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3266-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For the preparation of the nuclear protein extract (29Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Tan L. Yet S.F. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13776-13780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), RAW 264.7 cells were grown to 80% confluence then stimulated with either vehicle, LPS (1 μg/ml), or LPS (1 μg/ml) plus TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml). LPS-stimulated nuclear extract was subjected to electrophoretic mobility assay analysis using a double-stranded oligonucleotide probe encoding region −87 to −52 of the NOS2 5′-flanking sequence (TGGGGACTCTCCCTTTGGGAACAGTTATGCAAAATA). Binding reactions were performed in a 25-μl volume containing 20,000 cpm of labeled probe, 10 μg of nuclear extract, 100 ng of poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC) (Sigma), 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol, with or without oligonucleotide competitors. Reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature, and DNA-protein complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × Tris borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer at 4 °C. To characterize specific DNA-binding proteins, we incubated nuclear extracts with anti-HMG-I(Y) affinity-purified antibody (4 μg) (33Reeves R. Nissen M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 155-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) for 2 h at 4 °C before the addition of probe. Vascular smooth muscle cells are an important target of proinflammatory cytokines during sepsis, and their relaxation is an important determinant of the hypotension accompanying septic shock. Thus, we initially assessed the effect of TGF-β1 on NOS2 and HMG-I(Y) mRNA levels after IL-1β stimulation in RASMC. Fig.1 shows that TGF-β1 not only prevented the induction of NOS2 mRNA by IL-1β (white bars), but it also prevented HMG-I(Y) induction (black bars). IL-1β induction of HMG-I(Y) mRNA was reduced by 96% after 24 h of TGF-β1 treatment. To investigate the mechanism by which TGF-β1 decreased HMG-I(Y) mRNA levels after their induction by IL-1β, we assessed HMG-I(Y) mRNA half-life and promoter activity (Fig.2). To evaluate HMG-I(Y) mRNA half-life, RASMC were cultured to 70% confluence. Cells were then treated with either IL-1β alone or IL-1β plus TGF-β1 for 24 h. Actinomycin D was then added to the cells, and total RNA was extracted as described at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h. As reported previously (13Pellacani A. Chin M.T. Wiesel P. Ibanez M. Patel A. Yet S.-F. Hsieh C.-M. Paulauskis J.D. Reeves R. Lee M.-E. Perrella M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1525-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the half-life of HMG-I(Y) mRNA after IL-1β stimulation was ∼12 h. The addition of TGF-β1 did not reduce HMG-I(Y) mRNA half-life (Fig. 2 A). The effect of TGF-β1 on promoter activity of the HMG-I(Y) gene was studied by transiently transfecting RASMC with plasmid Δ180. Cells were then stimulated with vehicle, IL-1β, or IL-1β plus TGF-β1 for 24 h. TGF-β1 completely prevented the induction of HMG-I(Y) promoter activity by IL-1β (Fig. 2 B). Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-β1 decreased the levels of HMG-I(Y) mRNA by acting at the level of gene transcription. During sepsis, macrophages are activated by endotoxin and other bacterial products to produce a battery of mediators and proinflammatory cytokines (34Nathan C.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). One of the main cytokines produced by macrophages is IFNγ (34Nathan C.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar), which may act in an autocrine or a paracrine fashion. Both LPS and IFNγ are potent inducers of NOS2 in macrophages (Fig. 3, white bars). For this reason we wanted to investigate the effects of LPS and IFNγ on the expression of HMG-I(Y) in a mouse macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7 cells) and in resident peritoneal macrophages. LPS stimulation of RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 3 A) and peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 3 B) increased HMG-I(Y) mRNA 4- and 11-fold, respectively (black bars). This increase in HMG-I(Y) message by LPS was decreased by TGF-β1 in both cell types. NOS2 mRNA was also increased by LPS (14-fold in both RAW 264.7 and peritoneal macrophages) and suppressed by TGF-β1 treatment (white bars). IFNγ stimulation of RAW 264.7 cells induced HMG-I(Y) mRNA by 11-fold (Fig. 3 C, black bars) and NOS2 mRNA by 24-fold (white bars). In peritoneal macrophages, the same cytokine induced a 5.5-fold increase in HMG-I(Y) mRNA (Fig. 3 D, black bars) and a 19-fold increase in NOS2 mRNA (white bars). TGF-β1 treatment was able to abolish the induction of HMG-I(Y) and NOS2 mRNA by IFNγ in both cell types. Spleen is a macrophage-rich organ that responds to LPS administration in vivo with a dramatic up-regulation of NOS2 expression (Refs. 29Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Tan L. Yet S.F. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13776-13780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and 35Cook H.T. Bune A.J. Jansen A.S. Taylor G.M. Loi R.K. Cattell V. Clin. Sci. 1994; 87: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, and Fig.4 A). We decided to use the spleen as a model to investigate the regulation of HMG-I(Y) in macrophages in vivo, in response to LPS or LPS plus TGF-β1. LPS administration in rats caused a 4-fold induction of HMG-I(Y) transcript in the spleen (Fig. 4 B). HMG-(Y) mRNA levels were markedly reduced in rats receiving LPS plus TGF-β1 compared with levels in rats receiving LPS alone (Fig.4 B). This effect of TGF-β1 on HMG-I(Y) mRNA levels was similar to the suppression of NOS2 mRNA levels in rats receiving LPS and TGF-β1 (Fig. 4 A). We next focused our attention on the regulation of HMG-I(Y) protein by IL-1β in RASMC and by LPS in RAW 264.7 cells. We have shown previously that HMG-I(Y) protein is maximally induced after 48 h of cytokine stimulation in RASMC (13Pellacani A. Chin M.T. Wiesel P. Ibanez M. Patel A. Yet S.-F. Hsieh C.-M. Paulauskis J.D. Reeves R. Lee M.-E. Perrella M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1525-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), thus this time point was used to assess the effect of TGF-β1 on HMG-I(Y) protein induction. HMG-I(Y) protein levels were increased 7.5-fold by IL-1β in RASMC (Fig.5 A) and 5.5-fold by LPS in RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 5 B). When TGF-β1 was added, the induction of HMG-I(Y) protein levels was decreased by 83% (versus IL-1β, Fig. 5 A) in RASMC and by 70% (versus LPS, Fig. 5 B) in RAW 264.7 cells. We hypothesized that down-regulation of HMG-I(Y) may play a role in mediating the inhibition of NOS2 expression by TGF-β1 in response to inflammatory stimuli. To test this hypothesis, we transiently cotransfected RASMC and RAW 264.7 cells with promoter construct iNOS(−1485/+31) and increasing concentrations of expression plasmid HMGIYpcDNA3 (0, 1, 2, 3 μg/well as described under “Experimental Procedures”). Cells were then treated with either vehicle, IL-1β (RASMC, Fig.6 A), or LPS (RAW 264.7 cells, Fig. 6 B), alone or in combination with TGF-β1. Compared with cells receiving vehicle, the addition of IL-1β or LPS promoted a significant increase in promoter activity of the NOS2 gene in both RASMC (Fig. 6 A) and RAW 264.7 cells (Fig.6 B), respectively. As expected, when vector-transfected cells (pcDNA3) were treated with TGF-β1, NOS2 promoter activity in response to IL-1β (RASMC) and LPS (RAW 264.7 cells) was significantly reduced in RASMC (Fig. 6 A) and RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 6 B). HMG-I(Y)-transfected cells showed a dose-dependent recovery of NOS2 promoter activity by both IL-1β (Fig. 6 A) and LPS (Fig. 6 B). At a dose of 2 μg/well HMG-I(Y) expression plasmid, the responsiveness of the NOS2 gene promoter activity was almost completely restored in both RASMC (89% of IL-1β alone value, Fig. 6 A) and RAW 264.7 cells (90% of the LPS alone value, Fig. 6 B) despite the presence of TGF-β1. To determine whether HMG-I(Y) could restore other TGF-β1 down-regulated genes, we performed the same experiment using the promoter for the matrix metalloproteinase-12 gene (36Feinberg M.W. Jain M.K. Werner F. Sibinga N.E. Wiesel P. Wang H. Topper J.N. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25766-25773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2051515320,"We have cloned and sequenced a novel alcohol oxidase (Hv-p68) from the filamentous fungusHelminthosporium (Cochliobolus)victoriae that copurifies with mycoviral double-stranded RNAs. Sequence analysis revealed that Hv-p68 belongs to the large family of FAD-dependent glucose methanol choline oxidoreductases and that it shares significant sequence identity (>67%) with the alcohol oxidases of the methylotrophic yeasts. Unlike the intronless alcohol oxidases from methylotrophic yeasts, a genomic fragment of the Hv-p68 gene was found to contain four introns. Hv-p68, purified from fungal extracts, showed only limited methanol oxidizing activity, and its expression was not induced in cultures supplemented with methanol as the sole carbon source. Northern hybridization analysis indicated that overexpression of Hv-p68 is associated with virus infection, because significantly higher Hv-p68 mRNA levels (10- to 20-fold) were detected in virus-infected isolates compared with virus-free ones. We confirmed by Northwestern blot analysis that Hv-p68 exhibits RNA binding activity and demonstrated that the RNA-binding domain is localized within the N-terminal region that contains a typical ADP-binding β-α-β fold motif. The Hv-p68 gene, or closely similar genes, was present in all species of the genusCochliobolus but absent in the filamentous fungus,Penicillium chrysogenum, as well as in two nonmethylotrophic yeasts examined. This study represents the first reported case that a member of the FAD-dependent glucose methanol choline oxidoreductase family, Hv-p68, may function as an RNA-binding protein. We have cloned and sequenced a novel alcohol oxidase (Hv-p68) from the filamentous fungusHelminthosporium (Cochliobolus)victoriae that copurifies with mycoviral double-stranded RNAs. Sequence analysis revealed that Hv-p68 belongs to the large family of FAD-dependent glucose methanol choline oxidoreductases and that it shares significant sequence identity (>67%) with the alcohol oxidases of the methylotrophic yeasts. Unlike the intronless alcohol oxidases from methylotrophic yeasts, a genomic fragment of the Hv-p68 gene was found to contain four introns. Hv-p68, purified from fungal extracts, showed only limited methanol oxidizing activity, and its expression was not induced in cultures supplemented with methanol as the sole carbon source. Northern hybridization analysis indicated that overexpression of Hv-p68 is associated with virus infection, because significantly higher Hv-p68 mRNA levels (10- to 20-fold) were detected in virus-infected isolates compared with virus-free ones. We confirmed by Northwestern blot analysis that Hv-p68 exhibits RNA binding activity and demonstrated that the RNA-binding domain is localized within the N-terminal region that contains a typical ADP-binding β-α-β fold motif.

The CP and RDRP genes are either present on the same dsRNA segment, as in the case of the totivirus H. victoriae 190S virus, or on two separate dsRNA segments, in the case of the putative chrysovirus H. victoriae 145S virus (Hv145SV). It is thus not surprising that these viruses subvert host proteins for their own use. We have previously reported that host enzymes (a protein kinase and a protease) are involved in post-translational modification of the Hv190SV CP (4Ghabrial S.A. Havens W.M.

Because of similarity in size and number of dsRNA segments between the Hv145SV and viruses in the genusChrysovirus in the family Partitiviridae, the Hv145SV was tentatively classified as a member of the genusChrysovirus (12Ghabrial S.A. Bozarth R.F. Buck K.W. Yamashita S. Martelli G.P. Milne R.G. Murphy F.A. Fauquet C.M. Bishop D.H.L. Ghabrial S.A. Martelli G.P. Mayo M.A. Summers M.D. Virus Taxonmy: Sixth Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Springer-Verlag, New York1995: 253-260Google Scholar). We have recently (13Soldevila A. Havens W.M. Ghabrial S.A. Virology. 2000; 272: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) isolated a cellular protein, Hv-p68, that copurifies with viral dsRNA from H. victoriae isolates infected with both Hv190SV and Hv145SV. Additionally, Hv-p68 was demonstrated to be present as a minor component in the viral capsids (13Soldevila A. Havens W.M. Ghabrial S.A. Virology. 2000; 272: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our initial biochemical characterization studies of Hv-p68 indicated that it occurs in vivo as an octamer and that it is consistently present in higher levels in virus-infected H. victoriae isolates than in virus-free ones. We have also demonstrated by a gel retardation assay that Hv-p68 has RNA binding activity (13Soldevila A. Havens W.M. Ghabrial S.A. Virology. 2000; 272: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report the isolation and complete nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone of Hv-p68. We present evidence that Hv-p68 belongs to the FAD-dependent GMC family of oxidoreductases and that it has high sequence similarity to the alcohol oxidases of methylotrophic yeasts. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of Hv-p68 is associated with virus infection and that the RNA-binding domain of Hv-p68 is localized in the N-terminal region that contains a canonical ADP-binding β-α-β fold motif. In addition, we demonstrate by Southern hybridization analysis that theHv-p68 gene, or closely similar genes, is present in all Cochliobolus species examined but not in the filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum nor in two nonmethylotrophic yeast species. Three H.(Cochliobolus) victoriae isolates that differ in their virus content were used. Isolate A-9 (ATTC 42018), a diseased isolate known to contain both Hv190SV and Hv145SV (1Lai M.M.C. Virology. 1998; 244: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), was routinely used as a source for virions and Hv-p68. A single conidial isolate ofH. victoriae isolate B-2 (ATCC 42020), designated B-2ss, has recently been demonstrated to be devoid of virus and was used as a representative of a cured fungal isolate (13Soldevila A. Havens W.M. Ghabrial S.A. Virology. 2000; 272: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The virus-free H. victoriae isolate 408, used in previous virus transmission studies (14Ghabrial S.A. Mernaugh R.L. Compans R.W. Bishop D.H.L. Double-Stranded RNA Viruses. Elsevier Biomedical, New York1983: 441-449Google Scholar), was used as an example of a naturally occurring virus-free isolate. Isolates of C. heterostrophus, C. zeicola, and C. sativum, provided by M. Carson (North Carolina State University), were used in Southern screening for theHv-p68 gene. DNA from the filamentous fungus P. chrysogenum (ATCC 9480), Saccharomyces cerevisiae(strain 717; provided by Reed Wickner) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (strain SP-Q01; Stratagene) were also included in the Southern analysis. Total RNA was isolated from 4-day-old stationary cultures of H. victoriae strain A-9 by the guanidinium isothiocyanate/phenol method (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Polyadenylated RNA was purified from total RNA by oligo(dT)-Sepharose affinity chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). First and second strand cDNA were synthesized from poly(A) RNA using the SuperScript cDNA synthesis kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Forward and reverse degenerate primers corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of the native Hv-p68 protein (primer P1; see Fig. 1) and to amino acid sequencing data of an internal tryptic peptide (primer P2; see Fig. 1) were used along with the double-stranded cDNA synthesized to fungal mRNA (Hv-cDNA) to prime the amplification of an Hv-p68 cDNA fragment. Amplification reactions were carried out using Platinum High Fidelity Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and cycling parameters specified for TD-PCR (94 °C for 4 min, 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C (Δ −0.5 °C per cycle) for 2 min, 72 °C for 3 min, 30 cycles; 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 3 min, 10 cycles; 72 °C for 12 min). The PCR product generated (1.5 kbp) was gel-purified using GeneClean (BIO 101) and blunt-end-cloned into anEco RV-digested pZErO vector (Invitrogen). Four clones were subjected to automated sequencing (ABI), and the sequencing information was used to design a sequence-specific primer (P3). A 750-bp fragment corresponding to the 3′-end of the Hv-p68 mRNA was amplified from synthesized double-stranded cDNA by PCR using an oligo(dT) Not I primer and P3, a primer based on Hv-p68 cDNA sequences at nucleotide (nt) positions 1396–1420 (see Fig.1). Amplification reactions were carried out using Platinum High Fidelity Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the cycling parameters for TD-PCR were as specified above. The amplified PCR product was gel-purified by GeneClean (BIO 101), blunt-end-cloned into an Eco RV-digested pZErO vector (Invitrogen), and subjected to automated sequencing (ABI). Poly(A)+ RNA isolated from a 3-day-old stationary culture of isolate A-9 of H. victoriae was used to generate a cDNA library in the lambda ZipLox vector following the procedures for the SuperScript Lambda cloning system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The library was packaged using Gigapack II Gold (Stratagene) and amplified once to a high titer (8 × 1010 plaque-forming units/ml) inEscherichia coli cells. Hv-p68 lambda clones were isolated by screening ∼800,000 recombinant phages with a32P-labeled Hv-p68 probe generated by nick-translation (Life Technologies, Inc.) of the 1.5-kbp DOP-PCR product. Replica lifts (Hybond N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) from plated phage were hybridized for 14–16 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide/hybridization solution (50% formamide/1× Denhardt's solution/5× SSC/0.5% SDS/20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) and washed under conditions of high stringency. Pure lambda clones were obtained by two successive rounds of screening with the 32P-labeled 1.5-kbp cDNA probe. Four independent lambda clones were selected for in vivo excision into the cloning vector pZL1 as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.), and subjected to automated sequencing. All sequencing was performed by dideoxy-termination sequencing using the Rhodamine-Terminator sequencing kit (ABI) and an ABI600 automated sequencer. Automated sequencing was performed on both strands with universal primers and gene-specific “walking” primers. Sequence homology searches of GenBank™, Swissprot, and EMBL data bases were conducted using the BLAST and FASTA programs (16Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 215: 403-410Crossref Scopus (71456) Google Scholar, 17Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar). Paired and multiple sequence alignments were carried out with the programs Best-Fit, GAP, PILEUP, and PRETTY (Wisconsin GCG software package (18Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar)). Motif and signature pattern searches were conducted using the program Motif (19Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6565-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis were performed using the program ClustalW (20Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Trees generated by ClustalW were displayed using TreeView (21Page R.D.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). Predictions for protein sorting signals and subcellular localization sites on the deduced amino acid sequence were performed using PSPRT II (22Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). A cDNA corresponding to the coding region of Hv-p68 was obtained by PCR amplification using gene-specific primers and one of the isolated lambda Hv-p68 cDNA clones as a template. Primer sequences corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the Hv-p68 ORF and containing restriction-enzyme site sequences for cloning were: pET-p68-Eco RI FOR, 5′-CCGGAATTCGACGATCCCGGACGACGAGGTTGATATTATCG-3′ and pET-p68-Not I REV, 5′-AATATTCTTAGCGGCCGCCAAGCGCGATAATCCAGCAATC-3′. Amplification reactions were carried out using standard PCR conditions and Platinum High Fidelity Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The PCR-amplified product (∼2 kbp) was gel-purified by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by extraction with GeneClean (Bio101), digested with Eco RI-Not I, and ligated into an Eco RI-Not I-digested pET22(b)+ vector (Novagen). The construct, pETp68, was used to transform E. coli strain BL21(DE3) cells according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). For purification of the bacterially expressed Hv-p68, 100-ml cultures of transformed BL21(DE3) cells were grown in LB media at 37 °C to a density of 1.0 A 600 nm. Protein was expressed by induction with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubation for a period of 5 h at 30 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and treated with lysozyme (100 mg/ml final concentration) for 15 min, at 30 °C followed by treatment with DNase 1 (10 μg/ml final concentration) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 10 mmMgCl2 for 10 min at 30 °C. Bacterial extracts were briefly sonicated and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the pellet containing the inclusion bodies was resuspended in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride in binding buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The protein was solubilized by incubation on a rocker platform for 2 h at 4 °C. The His-tagged Hv-p68 was purified by Ni-NTA chromatography, under denaturing conditions, as described by the manufacturer (Novagen). The purified protein was renatured by step-dialysis with successive changes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl buffer containing 6, 4, or 2 murea or no urea. The final protein preparation was concentrated using a Centricon-10 device (Amicon). Constructs were generated in the bacterial expression vector pET22(b)+ containing large deletions at either the N- or C-terminal sequence of the Hv-p68 coding region. A construct for expression of a 271-amino acid N-terminal deletion mutant was generated by subcloning an Sst I-Not I restriction fragment from construct pETp68 (corresponding to nt positions 813–2111 in the Hv-p68 cDNA; see Fig. 1) into a similarly digested pET22(b)+ vector. A 160-amino acid C-terminal deletion construct was generated by subcloning the 1.5-kbpEco RI-Not I fragment from construct pZp68–1.5kbp (corresponding to nt positions 4–1512; see Fig. 1) into theEco RI-Not I-digested sites of pET22(b)+. 50-ml cultures of BL21(DE3) cells transformed with the full-length Hv-p68 (pETp68) and the N- and C-terminal truncated constructs were grown in LB media at 37 °C to a density of 1 A 600 nm. Protein was expressed by induction with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubation for a period of 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100. The bacterial extracts were sonicated and centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C to separate the soluble and the insoluble component (inclusion bodies). The overexpressed proteins were purified from the inclusion bodies by repeated resuspension of the pellet (in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100) by brief sonication followed by centrifugation at 27,000 × g, 10 min at 4 °C. Five cycles of washing/centrifugation of the resultant inclusion bodies pellet resulted in 90–95% removal of contaminant proteins from the Hv-p68 preparation. The inclusion bodies were finally resuspended in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl and an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE for Northwestern analysis. Total RNA was isolated by a modification of the procedure of Chomczynski and Sacchi (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). H. victoriae isolates A-9, B-2ss, and 408 were grown in stationary cultures in Fernbach flasks containing 200 ml of potato dextrose broth medium supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract (PDBY) for 8 days at room temperature. For the induction studies, mycelium fromH. victoriae isolate B-2ss was collected by centrifugation (3000 × g, 10 min) and rinsed with minimal medium (MM) supplemented with 1% glucose (23Yoder O.C. Adv. Plant Pathol. 1988; 6: 93-112Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The mycelium was homogenized in a blender, and the homogenate was transferred to Fernbach flasks containing MM supplemented with 1% dextrose and grown for 3 days on a shaker incubator at 22 °C. The mycelium was harvested and rinsed twice with MM, homogenized, and transferred to flasks containing fresh MM supplemented with either 1% glucose or 1% methanol and grown on a shaker incubator at 22 °C for 3 days. Mycelia from PDBY and MM cultures were collected by straining through two layers of Miracloth (Calbiochem) and pulverized in liquid nitrogen and 100 ml of a guanidinium-denaturing solution/water-saturated phenol/2 msodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0 (48:47:5), added (per 10 g of wet tissue). The suspension was incubated at room temperature for 15–20 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was extracted by addition of 0.2 volume of chloroform (20 ml). The aqueous phase was re-extracted with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1), and the RNA was precipitated by addition of 1 volume of isopropanol. The RNA pellets were resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate treated water and subjected to two rounds of high salt-isopropanol precipitation at room temperature (0.5 volume of 1.2 mNaCl/0.8 m sodium citrate and 0.5 volume of isopropanol), followed by precipitation in 2 m LiCl (4 h at 4 °C). For Northern hybridization, 25 μg of the total RNA was electrophoresed on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by alkaline downward transfer (TurboBlotter, Schleicher & Schuell), and the blot was subjected to UV cross-linking. Blots were hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-random-primed (Promega) Hv-p68 cDNA probe at 42 °C for 16–18 h in 50% formamide hybridization solution (50% formamide/1× Denhardt's solution/5× SSC/0.5% SDS/20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) and washed using high stringency conditions (2× SSC, 0.2% SDS, 23 °C for 10 min; 0.2× SSC, 0.1%SDS, 58–65 °C for 30–60 min). The Hv-p68 probe consisted of a gel-purified, GeneClean (BIO 101)-extractedEco RI-Sst I restriction fragment (850 bp) from a pZErO construct containing Hv-p68 cDNA. Genomic DNA was isolated from filamentous fungal species by a modification of the protocol described by Yoder (23Yoder O.C. Adv. Plant Pathol. 1988; 6: 93-112Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Mycelia from 200-ml shake cultures of the following filamentous fungi were grown in a complete medium lacking glucose for 4–5 days: H. (Cochliobolus)victoriae, isolates A-9, B-2ss, and 408; C. heterostrophus; C. zeicola; C. sativum; andP. chrysogenum. Mycelia were collected by straining through two layers of Miracloth (Calbiochem), freeze-dried, and ground in liquid nitrogen. The powdered mycelia were resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmEDTA, 1% Sarkosyl) containing 6 mg of proteinase K (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated at 50–55 °C for 60 min with occasional mixing by inversion. The volume was increased to 50 ml with lysis buffer, and the suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was extracted with Tris buffer-saturated phenol (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). The aqueous phase was re-extracted by chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1), ethanol-precipitated (in 0.3 m sodium acetate), and the resultant pellet was dried and resuspended in 2 ml of Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer. The DNA preparation was treated with RNase A (20 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 20 min, the volume increased to 10 ml with TE buffer, and the DNA was re-extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) followed by extraction with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The DNA was ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 0.3 m sodium acetate, and the pellet was air-dried and resuspended in TE buffer. The DNA was quantified by agarose-gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometric analysis. For the isolation of genomic DNA from yeast, 100-ml suspension cultures of S. cerevisiae andS. pombe were grown in YPD medium at 30 °C with shaking to a density of 2 A 600 nm. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0) and 2 ml of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). Three grams of acid-washed glass beads (450–500 μm, Sigma) were added, and the suspension was vortexed intermittently, at maximum speed, for 6–10 min. Two milliliters of TE buffer was added, and the phases were separated by centrifugation at 6000 ×g for 10 min. The aqueous phase was re-extracted with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1) and ethanol-precipitated. The DNA pellets were dried, resuspended in 1 ml of TE buffer, and treated with 50 μg of RNase A (at 37 °C for 15 min), and the DNA was reprecipitated by addition of 100 μl of 4 m ammonium acetate and 2.5 ml of ethanol. The DNA was resuspended in TE buffer and quantified by agarose-gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry. Fifteen micrograms of the restriction enzyme-digested genomic DNA was electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel (at 80 V for 9–10 h), and the DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by neutral downward transfer (20× SSC; TurboBlotter, Schleicher & Schuell), and the blot was subjected to UV cross-linking. Blots were hybridized with an [α-32P]dCTP-random-primed (Promega) Hv-p68 cDNA probe for 16–18 h at 42 °C in 50%-formamide hybridization solution and washed using high stringency conditions (2× SSC, 0.2% SDS, at 23 °C for 10 min; 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, at 58–65 °C for 30–60 min). The Hv-p68 probe consisted of a gel-purified, GeneClean (BIO 101)-extracted, Eco RI-Sst I restriction fragment (850 bp) from a pZErO construct containing a cDNA of Hv-p68. Alcohol oxidase activity in Hv-p68 preparations from H. victoriae and the bacterially expressed Hv-p68 was determined by a spectrophotometric assay, which measures the rate of conversion of methanol to hydrogen peroxide (24Van der Klei I.J. Bystrykh L.V. Harder W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 188: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Production of hydrogen peroxide after addition of methanol to the reaction was determined by monitoring the change in absorbance at 405 nm (at 25 °C) over a 5-min period using 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (A-1888, Sigma) as substrate and horseradish peroxidase (P-8250, Sigma). Commercially purified Pichia pastoris alcohol oxidase (E.C. 1.1.3.13; A2404, Sigma) was used in parallel enzymatic assays for comparison. Protein content was measured using a Bio-Rad protein determination reagent. Activity was given as Δ A 405 nm/min (units) per mg of protein. Radiolabeled transcripts (riboprobes) were synthesized by in vitro transcription from a pUC-construct pT7Hv190S, containing a full-length cDNA of the Hv190S dsRNA (3Huang S. Ghabrial S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12541-12546Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and pZ-2-28 containing a near-full length cDNA of the Hv145S dsRNA-4 in the pZErO vector. The positive-strand transcripts were generated by incubation of pT7Hv190S and pZ-2-2, previously linearized with Bam HI andNot I, respectively, with T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene) at 37 °C for 60 min in the presence of [α-32P]UTP. The transcription reactions were terminated by treatment with RQ1 RNase-Free DNase (2 units, for 15 min at 37 °C; Promega), and the reaction mixtures were extracted with phenol/chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. The specific activity of the riboprobes was determined by scintillation counting of the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (BA85, 0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schuell) using a wet transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membranes were then washed three times at room temperature, 20 min each time, in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1× Denhardt's reagent) to renature the proteins. Blotted proteins were probed by incubating with the 32P-labeled transcripts (105 cpm) in the same buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed three times for 2 min each using the same buffer, air-dried, and autoradiographed. After autoradiography, blots were rinsed briefly in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 (TBS-T) and incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer (TBS-T, 5% nonfat dry milk). Blots were processed for immunoblotting using the polyclonal antibodies against Hv-p68 (13Soldevila A. Havens W.M. Ghabrial S.A. Virology. 2000; 272: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and goat anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate as secondary antibodies. Nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Promega) were used as substrates for colorimetric detection. cDNA clones for the Hv-p68 gene were isolated by a combination of DOP-PCR and conventional library screening. The amino acid sequencing data previously obtained by Edman degradation analysis (13Soldevila A. Havens W.M. Ghabrial S.A. Virology. 2000; 272: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) were used to design two sets of degenerate primers for DOP-PCR. Mixed pools of oligonucleotides corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of the native protein (primer P1; Fig. 1) and to an internal tryptic peptide (primer P2; Fig. 1) were used to direct the amplification of an Hv-p68 PCR product with Hv-cDNA as a template.

Zinc fingers from one of these proteins, RR1, were expressed individually and assayed for RRE-IIB affinity. The C-terminal zinc finger retained much of the binding affinity of the two-finger parent and was disrupted by mutations predicted to narrow the RRE-IIB major groove and which disrupt Rev binding. In contrast, the N-terminal zinc finger has a calculated affinity at least 1000-fold lower. Despite the high affinity and specificity of RR1 for RRE-IIB, binding affinity for a 234-nucleotide human immunodeficiency virus Rev responsive element (RRE234) was significantly lower. Therefore, zinc finger proteins that bind specifically to RRE234 were constructed using an in vitro selection and recombination approach. These zinc fingers bound RRE234 with subnanomolar dissociation constants and bound the isolated RRE-IIB stem loop with an affinity 2 orders of magnitude lower but similar to the affinity of an arginine-rich peptide derived from Rev. These data show that single C2H2 zinc fingers can bind RNA specifically and suggest that their binding to stem loop IIB is similar to that of Rev peptide. However, binding to RRE234 is either different from stem loop IIB binding or the tertiary structure of stem loop IIB is changed within the Rev responsive element.

NMR and crystallographic data show clearly that zinc fingers bind DNA through α-helical contacts in a slightly enlarged DNA major groove (1Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar, 2Nekludova L. Pabo C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6948-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Similarly, current evidence suggests that zinc finger proteins require specific amino acids in α-helices for high affinity RNA binding (3Friesen W.J. Darby M.K. J. Biol.

Y.). 1996; 2: 1254-1269PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of amino acids within the α-helices of this group of zinc fingers significantly reduces RNA affinity. In vitro selection techniques, particularly phage display, have been used to exploit the modular nature of zinc finger binding to DNA to design proteins with affinity for new DNA targets (10Beerli R.R.

In these cases, amino acids within the α-helices of a known DNA-binding zinc finger protein are changed to make appropriate base contacts with the new DNA target. To explore the potential for designed RNA-binding proteins, we previously reported the isolation of zinc finger proteins with high affinity for HIV RRE-IIB and 5 S rRNA through a combination of phage display and gene shuffling (16Friesen W.J. Darby M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These zinc fingers most likely make critical contacts through amino acids in α-helices because these amino acids were randomized in the displayed zinc finger library. The 234-nucleotide HIV RRE (RRE234) found within theenv gene was chosen as a zinc finger target because of the potential for designing a protein that competitively inhibits Rev binding and HIV propagation (17Pollard V.W. Malim M.H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 491-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Rev is an essential HIV protein that induces the accumulation of unspliced and partially spliced viral RNA in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Rev activity is dependent upon binding to stem loop IIB of the RRE and subsequent multimerization (18Heaphy S. Dingwall C. Ernberg I. Gait M.J. Green S.M. Karn J. Lowe A.D. Singh M. Skinner M.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 685-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 19Daly T.J. Cook K.S. Gray G.S. Maione T.E. Rusche J.R.

Rev multimerization is cooperative and results in a high apparent binding affinity for RRE (21Malim M.H. Cullen B.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 241-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 22Van Ryk D.I. Venkatesan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17452-17463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, an effective zinc finger-based inhibitor that functions in the absence of multimer formation could be based on a mixture of zinc fingers that bind to multiple sites on the RRE in addition to the primary Rev binding site in stem loop IIB. Here we report that RR1, a zinc finger protein previously selected for binding to RRE-IIB, and a single zinc finger derived from it bind RRE-IIB with similar RNA sequence and structural requirements as the arginine-rich Rev peptide (amino acids 34–50). In contrast to the high affinity binding to stem loop IIB, RR1 has lower affinity for the full-length RRE234. In light of these results, we constructed high affinity zinc fingers that bind RRE234 by phage display and in vitro recombination of α-helix randomized zinc fingers. Selections for RNA-binding proteins were done with an α-helix randomized two-zinc finger library as described previously (16Friesen W.J. Darby M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, the phage library was incubated with biotinylated target RNA for 1 h, and RNA-phage complexes were immobilized on streptavidin-coated microtiter plates. Phage were eluted from the plates after extensive washing and amplified inEscherichia coli K91 cells for additional rounds of selection. Each selection included a 1000-fold molar excess of yeast tRNA over biotinylated target RNA. Between selection rounds, zinc finger cDNA was amplified, recombined (shuffled), and cloned back into the phage vector (fd.tet.7000), and electroporated into K91 cells (>106 plaque-forming units) for phage production. Zinc finger cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pET28b(+) for expression of N-terminal (His)6-tagged fusions. All plasmid constructs were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Zinc fingers were expressed inE. coli BL21 cells, purified by nickel affinity chromatography, folded by dialysis, and cleaved from (His)6tags as described previously (16Friesen W.J. Darby M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Gel shift analysis was performed as described previously, except for the case of full-length RRE, in which electrophoresis was done for 5 h at room temperature with 8 mA constant current. K D was determined by plotting the fraction of RNA bound against protein concentration and curve fitting to a variation of the Hill equation using SYSTAT (5Clemens K.R. Wolf V. McBryant S.J. Zhang P. Liao X. Wright P.E. Gottesfeld J.M. Science. 1993; 260: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Overlapping oligonucleotides corresponding to RRE IIB RNA with or without the G71A and G46:C74 to C46:G74 alterations were synthesized, annealed, and filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The filled in product included a T7 promoter and a 5′EcoRI site and a 3′ SmaI site, which were used for subcloning into pUC19. Before RNA production, the resultant plasmids were digested with SmaI. The RRE IIB RNA synthesized from these templates included 5′ GGG and 3′ CCC extensions (Fig. 2 A). The DNA template for production of RRE234 RNA was made by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the RRE from the plasmid pDM128 (23Hope T.J. McDonald D. Huang X.J. Low J. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5360-5366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with specific primers. The polymerase chain reaction product, which included a 5′ T7 promoter, was purified on a Qiagen polymerase chain reaction purification column and used directly for RNA production. All RNAs were synthesized by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase using an Ambion MegaShort Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Previously, we reported the selection of zinc finger peptides with high affinity and specificity for both RRE-IIB and 5 S RNA (16Friesen W.J. Darby M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The library used for these selections consisted of two zinc fingers, both with limited randomization in α-helix positions −1 through +10 (for sequence examples, see Fig. 5 B). Comparison of zinc finger sequences from selected phage showed that the C-terminal zinc finger was consistently basic, whereas the N-terminal zinc finger was frequently acidic. For example, the α-helix (−2 to +10, see Fig.5) of the N-terminal zinc finger of RR1 has a calculated pI of 4.2, whereas the α-helix of the C-terminal zinc finger has a pI of 12.2. We sought to determine the contribution of individual zinc fingers to RNA affinity because many RNA-binding proteins, including the α-helix from Rev (REV34–50), have basic RNA binding domains. The N-terminal (zf1) and C-terminal (zf2) zinc fingers from RR1 were expressed individually, and their affinity for RRE-IIB RNA was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. RR1zf1 did not bind to32P-labeled RRE-IIB RNA at protein concentrations as high as 1500 nm (Fig.1 A). In contrast, RR1zf2 bound RRE-IIB RNA with an apparent K D of 19.7 ± 7.9 nm, which is 2–3-fold lower than the affinity of RR1 (K D , 7.9 nm). RR1zf2-RRE-IIB complexes were not competed with a 1000-fold molar excess of tRNA or poly(rA) (data not shown). If RR1 zinc fingers function independently, the C-terminal finger contributes over 95% of the binding energy. Given this assumption, the calculated affinity of the N-terminal zinc finger is ∼300 mm.Figure 1Zinc finger 2 of RR1 contributes most of the energy for RNA binding. A, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis of RR1 and individual zinc fingers from RR1 (RR1zf1 and RR1zf2).

Mao H. Rao N.S. Tan R. Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. Frankel A.D. Williamson J.R. Science. 1996; 273: 1547-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, two mutants of RRE-IIB RNA, G71A and G46:C74 to C46:G74 (Fig.2 A), which greatly reduce the affinity of the RNA for Rev34–50, were used as substrates (25Tan R. Chen L. Buettner J.A. Hudson D. Frankel A.D. Cell. 1993; 73: 1031-1040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The G71A mutation disrupts a purine-purine base pair responsible for widening the RNA major groove and thereby excludes the Rev34–50 α-helix. Mutation of G46:C74 to C46:G74 is predicted not to alter the structure of the RNA but instead to change the sequence of bases that make critical Rev34–50contacts. Affinity of the two-finger protein RR1 was reduced at least 100-fold by the RRE-IIB mutations (Fig. 2 B). In gel shift assays with purified RR1zf2, C46:G74 and G71A both failed to form a discrete shifted species, indicative of either greater nonspecific binding or significantly decreased stability during electrophoresis (Fig. 3 C). Based on the amount of unshifted RNA, RR1 zinc finger binding is more severely reduced by the G71A mutation. Thus, it is probable that selected zinc fingers require distortion of the RNA helix to allow the zinc finger α-helix access to the rich hydrogen bonding potential within the major groove. RR1 and other zinc fingers selected to the stem loop IIB region bind a more extensive 234-nucleotide region of the RRE with at least 100-fold lower affinity than RRE-IIB (Fig. 3). (The zinc finger protein SFR1 was isolated to the full-length RRE (below) and is shown in Fig. 3 for comparison.) Furthermore, in some cases (RR1 and RR31), the zinc fingers failed to form discrete shifted species, suggesting nonspecific RNA affinity or lower stability during electrophoresis. To isolate zinc fingers that bind RRE234 and to determine whether other sites on full-length RRE other than stem loop IIB are conducive for zinc finger α-helix binding, we conducted phage display selection using immobilized RRE234 RNA. Five rounds of phage display selection were executed in the presence of a 1000-fold molar excess of tRNA. The percentage of phage retained on RRE234 increased over five rounds of selection, whereas the percentage of phage retained in negative control experiments without RNA remained below 0.1% (Fig.4 A). To improve the affinity of selected proteins, zinc finger DNA from selection round 4 was recombined between further rounds of selection (26Stemmer W.P. Nature. 1994; 370: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar, 27Stemmer W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10747-10751Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). In addition, DNA used for recombination was doped with unselected randomized oligonucleotides used to make the library. This provides additional diversity by introducing new zinc finger sequences in tandem with preselected zinc fingers. DNA from round 4 of the initial selection series was amplified, digested, and recombined and then subcloned into fd.tet.7000 for production of phage. Between rounds 5 and 6, zinc finger DNA was recombined along with 10% zinc finger library DNA, and after round 6, DNA was recombined again. Finally, three rounds of phage display selection without recombination were done (Fig.4 B). Clones were randomly selected and sequenced after the initial five rounds of selection and again after the final round of selection and recombination (Fig. 5 B). With the exception of positions +8 and +10, the C-terminal zinc fingers of phage recovered from the final round of selection (SFR series) were identical. Phage sequenced after the fifth round of the initial selection were more diverse, with only one phage (FR2) containing a second zinc finger identical to the majority of shuffled clones. As observed with RRE-IIB- and 5 S rRNA-selected zinc fingers, the C-terminal α-helix of the RRE-selected clones was conserved and basic (pI = 12.19 for clone SFR8), whereas the α-helix of the first zinc finger was less well conserved and acidic (pI = 6.26). It is likely that, as in the case of RR1, the second zinc finger of these peptides contributes most or all of the energy for RNA binding. Interestingly, lysine is frequently selected over arginine between the zinc coordinating histidines. Three clones from the final round of selection and recombination, SFR1, SFR4, and SFR12, were recombinantly produced, and their affinity for RRE RNA was determined by gel shift analysis using protein titration (Fig.6 A). All three peptides bound RRE RNA with a K D of <1 nm (Fig.6 B). Rev binds to RRE RNA with a K D of 1–10 nm. These three RRE RNA-selected proteins had lower affinity for RRE-IIB RNA (K D of around 250 nm) (Fig. 6 C), suggesting that these zinc finger peptides make significant contacts outside the stem loop IIB region of RRE RNA. The zinc finger motif has proven to be an excellent framework for construction of novel specific RNA-binding proteins (16Friesen W.J. Darby M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28McColl D.J. Honchell C.D. Frankel A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9521-9526Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have shown that a combination of phage display and gene shuffling of a zinc finger library can be used to construct zinc finger proteins with specific affinity for RRE-IIB, 5 S rRNA, and RRE234. The RRE-IIB-selected peptide RR1 requires only the second finger for high affinity binding, and it is likely that all zinc finger peptides thus far selected exclusively use the C-terminal zinc finger for RNA binding because this finger is consistently more conserved and basic than the N-terminal finger. The dominant role for this zinc finger is surprising because it is closer to the phage surface during selection, and binding could be expected to be sterically hindered. There is a 2–3-fold difference in affinity between RR1 and its C-terminal zinc finger, suggesting that the N-terminal zinc finger may make a specific contact. Furthermore, in binding assays with RNA mutated at the core Rev binding site, the two-finger protein forms a discrete shifted species, whereas the single fingers do not. Mutations that disrupt the G-G base pair that widens the stem loop IIB helix inhibit Rev, RR1, and RR1zf2 binding, suggestive of a similar mode of binding. Presumably all of the RNAs that we have used for selection contain structural elements that allow the α-helix to make sequence-specific contacts. TFIIIA binding to 5 S RNA is guided principally by RNA structure, with significant contacts at loop A, where three helices stack, and at loop E (8Theunissen O. Rudt F. Guddat U. Mentzel H. Pieler T.

It has yet to be determined whether randomization of the β-sheet will allow isolation of peptides with affinity to RNA without a widened major groove or further enhance the affinity of peptides preselected for peptide α-helix RNA binding. McColl et al. (28McColl D.J. Honchell C.D. Frankel A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9521-9526Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have used the zinc finger framework to stabilize the Rev peptide in an α-helical conformation. By positioning the N-terminal Arg of Rev peptide at −1 with respect to the α-helix, two nonessential arginines were replaced with histidines required for zinc coordination. The resulting zinc finger, ZF2-Rev, binds RRE-IIB with a K D of around 300 ± 40 nm at 4 °C, very close to the K D for a Rev peptide stabilized by flanking alanines (330 ± 20 nm). ZF2-Rev binding in vivo depends on cysteine at position 5, presumably for zinc finger formation, asparagine at position 22 for G:A base pair contacts, and a wild-type Rev sequence. Alignment of α-helices from RR1zf2 and ZF2-Rev using zinc coordinating histidines as a reference point (Fig. 5 B) reveals that of the amino acid positions critical for Rev binding, only α-helix position +1 (arginine) is identical. However, rotating the RR1zf2 helix with respect to ZF2 in a helical wheel plot aligns four identical amino acids including asparagine 22, suggesting that the RR1zf2 α-helix and ZF2 could make similar RNA contacts. The rotation is equivalent to aligning the N terminus of RR1zf2 with the C-terminal half of ZF2-Rev and may suggest that the helix of RR1 does not penetrate as deeply into the major groove of RRE-IIB. Determination of the structure of RR1zf2 bound to RRE-IIB RNA will reveal the exact nature of the peptide-RNA contacts and provide the foundation to further increase affinity using structure-based design. Blancafort et al. (32Blancafort P. Steinberg S.V. Paquin B. Klinck R. Scott J.K. Cedergren R. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 585-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) have attempted a systematic analysis of the potential contacts between base pairs in RNA and zinc finger. Mutations in the α-helix of zinc finger 2 in Zif268 (a three-finger protein) were displayed on bacteriophage and selected for binding to individual RNA triplets embedded within the center of the 9-base pair Zif268 DNA recognition sequence. Only RNA triplets containing a central mismatch, G:A or C:A, were substrates for zinc fingers. This underscores our hypothesis that the RNA must be distorted to accommodate the zinc finger α-helix, as is clearly shown in the Rev peptide-RRE-IIB structure. Recent kinetic measurements for the binding of Rev to RRE and a number of derivatives using surface plasmon resonance suggest affinities 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than previous estimates by gel shift or filter binding assays (22Van Ryk D.I. Venkatesan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17452-17463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The K D for the high affinity site in RRE-IIB is between 10 and 100 pm. Lower affinity sites for three additional molecules of Rev are in theK D range of 40–200 nm. Clearly, potential inhibitors of Rev function that are not based on dominant negative Rev mutations (33Malim M.H. Bohnlein S. Hauber J. Cullen B.R. Cell. 1989; 58: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) and do not multimerize must achieve affinities for RRE-IIB in the picomolar range or alternatively target other sites of Rev interaction on the RRE. Isolation of zinc fingers that bind RRE234 up to 250 times better than stem loop IIB suggests that zinc fingers can be isolated against regions other than IIB. Conversely, zinc fingers that bind to RRE-IIB with significantly higher affinity than RRE234 illustrate that zinc finger binding is sensitive to RNA tertiary structure. Zinc finger phage display coupled with structure-based design offers a unique opportunity to study protein-RNA interaction as well as the potential for construction of high affinity RNA-binding peptides for possible therapeutic use. Our demonstration that a single zinc finger can bind specifically to an RNA opens the way to a comprehensive screen of zinc finger sequence space that was not possible for two-zinc finger proteins."

Tryptophan fluorescence of wild type enzyme and an N-terminally truncated form (N55) increased at low concentrations of urea or guanidine-HCl followed by a reduction in intensity at intermediate denaturant concentrations; a transition at higher denaturant was detected as decreased fluorescence intensity and a red-shifted emission. Solute quenching of fluorescence indicated that tryptophans become progressively solvent-exposed during unfolding. Wild type enzyme had stronger negative CD bands between 220 and 230 nm than the mutant, indicative of greater α-helical content. Urea or guanidine-HCl caused a reduction in ellipticity at 222 nm at low denaturant concentration with the wild type enzyme, a transition that is absent in the mutant; both enzymes exhibited a cooperative transition at higher denaturant concentrations. Both enzymes dissociate to monomers in 1.5m urea. Unfolding of wild type enzyme is described by a multistate unfolding and a parallel two state unfolding; the two-state component is absent in the mutant. Changes in spectral properties associated with unfolding were largely reversible after dilution to low denaturant.

The active sites of class I enzymes have a classic Rossman fold formed from two β-α-β elements resulting in a structure of four parallel beta strands. The active sites of class II enzymes consist of a unique fold formed from an antiparallel seven-stranded sheet element first identified in seryl-tRNA synthetase (4Cusack S. Berthet-Colominas C. Härtlein M. Nassar N. Leberman R. Nature. 1990; 347: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). A structure similar to the active site of class II enzymes exists in the biotin synthetase/repressor protein (5Artymiuk P.J. Rice D.W. Poirrette A.R. Willet P. Nature Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 758-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and the asparagine synthetase (6Nakatsu T. Kato H. Oda J. Nature Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), both of which have an adenylate intermediate on their reaction pathways. The two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase classes have different modes of nucleotide binding and approach tRNA from opposite sides of the polynucleotide. The differences in primary structure and modes of ligand binding suggest that the two classes arose independently (7Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D.

Evol. 1995; 40: 487-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Glycyl-tRNA synthetases are unusual in that there are two distinct enzyme types that are not closely related. They have developed modes of tRNA recognition that differ with respect to the discriminator base and other base pairs in the stem (10Hipps D. Shiba K. Henderson B. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5550-5552Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 11Nameki N. Tamura K. Asahara H. Hasegawa T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The type exemplified by theEscherichia coli enzyme is found in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, whereas a second enzyme is found in other eubacteria such as Mycobacteria sp. andMycoplasma sp., organisms classified as thermotoga (e.g. Thermus thermophilus), the archaea (e.g. Methanococcus jannashii), and in all eukaryotic organisms. Examination of the crystal structure of T. thermophilus glycyl-tRNA synthetase revealed an atypical motif 1 (12Logan D.T. Mazauric M.-H. Kern D. Moras D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4156-4167Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) that was not identified in earlier alignments of glycyl-tRNA synthetase (13Cusack S. Härtlein M. Leberman R.

Although the T. thermophilus enzyme aligns with glycyl-tRNA synthetases from eukaryotic organisms, the eukaryotic enzymes have elements that are absent in the T. thermophilus enzyme. One such element in glycyl-tRNA synthetase from Bombyx mori, Homo sapiens,Caenorhabditis elegans, and Arabadopsis thalinia is a 50- to 60-residue N-terminal structure present in a number of other eukaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, including the glutamyl-prolyl-, histidyl-, tryptophanyl-, and methionyl-tRNA synthetases. Although the physiological function of this structure is unclear, because it is apparently not required for amino acid activation or tRNA binding, some studies suggest it may have a role in binding to polynucleotides (15Wu H.

Our studies indicate that the enzyme dissociates into relatively native monomers prior to effects on spectroscopic signals sensitive to changes in conformation; the monomers unfold through a multistate process. The first 55 residues of the protein have a high content of α-helix and unfold independently of the rest of the structure, suggesting that it constitutes a domain that is separate from the core catalytic domains.Apart from our interest in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase structure and mechanism, the present studies are of general interest as an example of a complex unfolding pathway. Most protein folding studies have focused on simple two-state systems, whereas many functionally interesting proteins are likely to show more complex behavior. The techniques and analytical methods for coping with the added complexity need to evolve, and the present studies are a step in this direction.RESULTSTo examine the unfolding of glycyl-tRNA synthetase and the interaction of the N-terminal structure with other elements of the protein, we examined the urea and guanidine-HCl unfolding process by multiple spectroscopic techniques (40Eftink M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 487-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We also examined the oligomeric state of the protein under different solvent conditions.Examination of Protein Unfolding by Intrinsic Tryptophan FluorescenceB. mori glycyl-tRNA synthetase has four tryptophans that are conserved in all eukaryotic glycine enzymes. Insofar as tryptophanyl residues are sensitive to protein conformation and local environment (41Eftink M.R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 482-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) they are potential probes of conformational change. We examined fluorescence emission spectra for the wild type enzyme and the N55 deletion mutant under native conditions and in the presence of different concentrations of urea (panel A) or guanidine-HCl (panel B) as shown in Fig.1 for the wild type enzyme; results with the N55 mutant were similar (not shown). With both chaotropic agents there was an increase in fluorescence intensity at lower concentrations of denaturant followed by a red shift in the emission wavelength and a reduction in fluorescence intensity at higher concentrations of denaturant. Both mutant and wild type proteins exhibit a transition at high concentrations of guanidine-HCl (at 2.7 m) or urea (6.1 m). The change in fluorescence intensity at a single wavelength as a function of guanidine-HCl (panel A) or urea (panel B) for both wild type and mutant enzymes is shown in Fig. 2. The addition of KCl to 1m in the absence of urea or guanidine-HCl did not induce an increase in fluorescence intensity as was observed at 1 mguanidine-HCl, indicating that the effect at this concentration of guanidine-HCl is not related to ionic strength or the presence of chloride. The similarity of the results obtained with urea and guanidine-HCl also suggests that the spectral changes reflect general features of the unfolding process and not properties of the agents used to induce unfolding.Figure 2Change in fluorescence emission at 327 nm at different concentrations of urea (A) or guanidine-HCl (B).

Singular values and values for the autocorrelation function for the first 10 basis spectra are summarized in Table I. The analysis indicates that two singular values make the largest contribution to the spectra with a third component making a negligible contribution; similarity of the basis spectra suggests that the variables are the same for the two denaturants for the mutant and wild type enzymes. Based on the magnitude of the singular values and the values of the autocorrelation function (values greater than 0.8 indicating significance), only the first four or five basis spectra make a contribution to the spectra. The existence of multiple species in the unfolding pathway is suggested by singular value decomposition of the intensity data. Although the basis spectra are not necessarily those of the intermediates, they suggest that there are species with spectral properties intermediate between the native and denatured forms of the enzyme. The red shift and the intensity changes associated with unfolding indicate that the tryptophans are buried and at least partially shielded from solvent (37Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1999: 239-245Google Scholar, 41Eftink M.R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 482-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), a conclusion also supported by iodide and acrylamide quenching studies (presented later). The increase in fluorescence intensity suggests quenching of fluorescence of one or more of the tryptophanyl residues by proximity to another group is relieved by a conformational change induced by low concentrations of denaturant. No concentration dependence was observed in unfolding experiments, where fluorescence was observable over a range of 0.05–0.2 mg ml−1; the propensity of the protein to adsorb to glass and plastic below 0.05 mg ml−1precluded examination of lower protein concentrations.Figure 3Basis spectra derived from singular value decomposition of fluorescence emission spectra.

Multiple transitions reflected in fluorescence changes are inconsistent with a simple two-state model (Reaction I and Eq. 2), suggesting a more complex scheme is required to describe the unfolding process. Although the change in emission wavelength in Fig. 4 can be fit using a three-state model, fits to the intensity changes shown in Fig. 2 and the emission wavelength in Fig. 4 showed a nonrandom distribution of residual values (Fig. 4, B and D). A better fit was obtained with a model with two intermediate species (Reaction V and Eq. 5); values for the F-statistic for different experiments ranged from 4 to 10 placing the fit to the four-state model well above the 95% interval. The values for ΔG andm for the transition occurring at high denaturant concentration are given in Table I for the wild type enzyme.Figure 4Intensity averaged emission wavelength at different concentrations of denaturant.

The emission spectra of the species seen in the unfolding and refolding were similar at relatively high concentrations of denaturant (3–6m urea) showing a characteristic increase in fluorescence and a blue shift in the emission spectrum. At lower concentrations (<2.5 m) the signal of the refolded protein does not return to that of the native protein and retains the higher emission intensity and slight red shift in the emission spectrum. Similar results were obtained with the N55 mutant. These experiments indicate that transitions occurring at higher concentrations of denaturant are readily reversible, whereas the transitions at lower concentrations are not.Examination of the Effect of Unfolding on Tryptophan Fluorescence LifetimesThe fluorescent properties of tryptophans in glycyl-tRNA synthetase during guanidine-HCl-induced denaturation was examined by fluorescence lifetime measurements (see Fig. 1s in the Supplemental Material). Two classes of lifetimes were detected with one class accounting for 70–80% of the fluorescence. Consistent with the steady-state measurements, there was an increase in the lifetime of the larger class of fluorophors with increasing denaturant concentration followed by a decrease as the protein unfolds at high concentrations; this result is seen in both the wild type enzyme and N55 mutant.Examination of Tryptophan Exposure by Fluorescence QuenchingTo corroborate the results of the unfolding studies indicating that the tryptophans in the native proteins are at least partially shielded from the solvent, we examined iodide and acrylamide quenching of tryptophan fluorescence. Both wild type and mutant gave linear Stern-Volmer plots with iodide, whose slopes increased with increasing concentrations of urea or guanidine-HCl (shown in Fig. 2s,A and B, in the Supplemental Material). Quenching by acrylamide gave a similar pattern of increasing quenching upon addition of urea or guanidine-HCl (see Fig. 2s, C andD, in the Supplemental Material) but exhibited both static and dynamic components as indicated by the upward curvature in the Stern-Volmer plots. The quenching studies, summarized in TableII, indicate that the tryptophans in native glycyl-tRNA synthetase are inaccessible to a polar quencher (KI) and only slightly more accessible to a more hydrophobic quencher (acrylamide), consistent with most of the four tryptophans being shielded from solvent in the protein interior. That both the wild type and N55 mutant exhibited similar behavior qualitatively and quantitatively is consistent with the steady-state fluorescence results indicating that the tryptophans are buried. Perturbation of the structure of both enzymes with a relatively low concentration of denaturant resulted in the same extent of exposure of tryptophanyl residues to solvent. As expected for unfolded proteins, both wild type and mutant showed the same susceptibility to iodide and acrylamide quenching when treated with high concentrations of urea (6.4m) or guanidine-HCl (5.8 m).Table IIQuenching constants for wild type and N55 glycyl-tRNA synthetaseEnzymeConditionAcrylamideKIK SVυK SVm−1Wild typeNative1.7 ± 0.1<0.10.35 ± 0.052.5m urea1.1 ± 0.060.85 ± 0.051.0 ± 0.076.4 m urea4.3 ± 0.42.2 ± 0.14.1 ± 0.21 mGnd.HCl2-aGnd.HCl, guanidine-HCl.2.1 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.15.8 m Gnd.HCl3.5 ± 0.22.0 ± 0.24.1 ± 0.4N55Native1.5 ± 0.10.3 ± 0.10.3 ± 0.052.5 murea1.5 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.16.4m urea3.2 ± 0.22.5 ± 0.24.1 ± 0.31 m Gnd.HCl1.4 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.15.8 m Gnd.HCl4.3 ± 0.31.7 ± 0.24.1 ± 0.22-a Gnd.HCl, guanidine-HCl. Open table in a new tab Examination of Unfolding by Circular DichroismWe employed circular dichroism in the analysis of the unfolding of glycyl-tRNA synthetase as a spectroscopic probe that is sensitive to protein secondary structure. The CD spectra of the wild type and N55 deletion mutant in Fig. 5 revealed greater negative ellipticity for the wild type enzyme in the region of 210–230 nm (Fig. 5 A), a region with bands characteristic of α-helix. The difference spectrum derived from the wild type and mutant proteins has features characteristic of α-helix (not shown). There was a small, though significant, difference between wild type and mutant in the CD spectra recorded in the near-UV range (panel B). The far-UV CD spectra of the native and the unfolded/refolded wild type and N55 mutant proteins were also examined as shown in Fig. 5(C and D, respectively). The native (C, closed symbols) and unfolded/refolded (C, open symbols) wild type enzyme were similar, indicating that unfolding of a significant fraction of secondary structure is reversible. The CD spectrum of the unfolded/refolded N55 mutant (D, open symbols) is also similar to the native form of the protein (D, closed symbols). We examined the change in ellipticity at 222 nm at different concentrations of urea for the wild type and N55 mutant proteins as shown in Fig. 6 A. The wild type enzyme showed significantly higher ellipticity than did the mutant, which declined with a transition with a midpoint at ∼2.7–3m urea; this transition was absent or at least far less pronounced in the mutant. At higher concentrations of urea, the behavior of the mutant and wild type proteins were similar, both showing a relatively noncooperative decrease in ellipticity between 3 and 5.5 m urea followed by a cooperative transition centered at 6–6.1 m urea. The latter transition occurs at the same concentration of urea as the transition seen when fluorescence was examined and appears to correspond to the global unfolding of the protein. When guanidine-HCl was employed to induce unfolding (Fig.6 B), a similar result was obtained; a transition at low concentrations of denaturant was present in the wild type enzyme but absent in the mutant and both exhibited a cooperative transition at 2.7m guanidine-HCl. Despite the difference between the wild type and mutant proteins below 3 m urea in unfolding experiments, both could be fit to a three-state unfolding model; the result may be a reflection of the small amplitude of the spectral change in the mutant and the transitions in the wild type occurring coincidentally over a similar range of denaturant. Although application of the F-statistic to the fit of four-state models to the data for N55 indicated that these complex models could not be justified, the wild type enzyme gave a better fit to the four-state model (F = 5.8, 95% confidence interval) described by Eq. 5. A more appropriate model (Reactions III and IV and Eq. 4) for the wild type enzyme includes a three-state unfolding process that describes features of both the wild type and mutant and an independent, parallel unfolding process that accounts for the transition seen in the wild type enzyme at low denaturant concentration, and it was this model that was used for analysis of the wild type enzyme. Although the fit to the four-state scheme described by Eq. 5 was better than to the three-state model (F = 11, with p greater than 95%), it was almost the same as the fit obtained to Eq. 4. Tables III and IVsummarize the thermodynamic parameters (m andΔG values) derived from urea- and guanidine-HCl-induced unfolding experiments. Discrepancies for free energies between urea and thermal unfolding and guanidine-HCl-induced unfolding noted previously (24Pace C.N Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar) have been attributed to the stabilizing effect of guanidine-HCl on some structures (34Morjana N.A.

B. 1999; 103: 4781-4785Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar) has attributed some of the effects of guanidine-HCl on protein stability to the nature of the anion and suggests that guanidine-HCl is unsuitable for determining thermodynamic parameters of protein unfolding using the commonly employed linear extrapolation method. The work of Smith and Scholtz (44Smith J.S. Scholtz J.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7292-7297Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) indicates that m values show a clear dependence on ionic strength such that guanidine-HCl and urea are equally effective in denaturation experiments performed at constant ionic strength. Despite these cautions with respect to the use of guanidine-HCl, the unfolding of glycyl-tRNA synthetase with the two denaturants was quite similar. The similarity in the values ofΔG 2 where fluorescence or CD were observable suggests that they reflect the same unfolding process.Figure 5Circular dichroic spectra of wild type and the N55 mutant glycyl-tRNA synthetases.

https://openalex.org/W2039384045,"Using phosphocellulose followed by single-stranded DNA-cellulose chromatography for purification of UvrC proteins from overproducing cells, we found that UvrC elutes at two peaks: 0.4 m KCl (UvrCI) and 0.6 m KCl (UvrCII). Both forms of UvrC have a major peptide band (>95%) of the same molecular weight and identical N-terminal amino acid sequences, which are consistent with the initiation codon being at the unusual GTG site. Both forms of UvrC are active in incising UV-irradiated, supercoiled φX-174 replicative form I DNA in the presence of UvrA and UvrB proteins; however, the specific activity of UvrCII is one-fourth that of UvrCI. The molecular weight of UvrCII is four times that of UvrCI on the basis of results of size exclusion chromatography and glutaraldehyde cross-linking reactions, indicating that UvrCII is a tetramer of UvrCI. Functionally, these two forms of UvrC proteins can be distinguished under reaction conditions in which the protein/nucleotide molar ratio is >0.06 by using UV-irradiated,32P-labeled DNA fragments as substrates; under these conditions UvrCII is inactive in incision, but UvrCI remains active. The activity of UvrCII in incising UV-irradiated, 32P- labeled DNA fragments can be restored by adding unirradiated competitive DNA, and the increased level of incision corresponds to a decreased level of UvrCII binding to the substrate DNA. The sites of incision at the 5′ and 3′ sides of a UV-induced pyrimidine dimer are the same for UvrCI and UvrCII. Nitrocellulose filter binding and gel retardation assays show that UvrCII binds to both UV-irradiated and unirradiated double-stranded DNA with the same affinity (K a, 9 × 108/m) and in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas UvrCI does not. These two forms of UvrC were also produced by the endogenousuvrC operon. We propose that UvrCII-DNA binding may interfere with Uvr(A)2B-DNA damage complex formation. However, because of its low copy number and low binding affinity to DNA, UvrCII may not interfere with Uvr(A)2B-DNA damage complex formation in vivo, but instead through double-stranded DNA binding UvrCII may become concentrated at genomic areas and therefore may facilitate nucleotide excision repair.

Our current understanding suggests that these three proteins work in a sequential manner, with UvrA first locating and dimerizing at a damaged base on double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA),1 and UvrB then binds and forms a Uvr(A)2B complex from which UvrA may dissociate. Finally, UvrC binds to the Uvr(A)2B complex and triggers dual incisions 6–8 base pairs (bp) 5′ and 3–5 bp 3′ to the damaged base. A diverse array of chemically and photochemically induced modifications to bases in DNA are recognized, including helix-stabilizing and -destabilizing damage (for review, see Refs.1Sancar A. Tang M-s. Photochem. Photobiol. 1993; 57: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 2Van Houten B. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 45: 18-51Crossref Google Scholar, 3Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that UvrC is essential for 5′ and 3′ incisions and is specifically implicated in making the 5′ incision through site-directed mutagenesis studies. UvrC is probably essential for the catalysis of the 3′ incision as well, although it may catalyze this step itself (4Lin J.J. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It may not be under lexA control asuvrA and uvrB are (7Forster J.W. Strike P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 211: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The genomic region ofE. coli containing the uvrC gene is complex and contains at least one overlapping open reading frame (12Sharma S. Stark T.F. Beattie W.G. Moses R.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2301-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Moolenaar G.F. van Sluis C.A. Backendorf C.,. van de Putte P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4273-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). TheuvrC gene itself appears to have four promoters and to be transcribed into two mRNAs (7Forster J.W. Strike P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 211: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The translation start site for the UvrC protein is also unclear and may be the 5′-GTG upstream of the first 5′-ATG (13Moolenaar G.F. van Sluis C.A. Backendorf C.,. van de Putte P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4273-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Sancar G.B. Sancar A. Rupp W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 4593-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The precise size of the UvrC protein is therefore unknown and may be 67,000 Da, or it may be 22 amino acids longer and 68,500 Da. The low natural occurrence of the Uvr proteins has necessitated their study by the use of overproducing cells containing the appropriate plasmids. This is particularly true for UvrC, because it is estimated to be present at only <10 molecules per wild-type cell (2Van Houten B. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 45: 18-51Crossref Google Scholar). In this study we have purified UvrC from E. coli strains containing the overproducing plasmid pDR3274 (15Thomas D.C. Levy M. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9875-9893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by several different methods, including a rapid procedure that avoids precipitation of the protein and expedites isolation of a purified protein. We find that these preparations yield two different UvrC fractions, which we call UvrCI and UvrCII according to their elution positions from single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA) cellulose columns. Both UvrCI and UvrCII are active in a variety of assays of UvrABC excision nuclease activity but were found to differ in their interactions with DNA. UvrCII binds readily to ds-DNA, whereas UvrCI does not. We present evidence that demonstrates that this UvrCII-DNA binding may affect the UvrABC excision nuclease activity. These two forms of UvrC were also isolated from wild-type E. coli cells without containing the pDR3274 plasmids (12Sharma S. Stark T.F. Beattie W.G. Moses R.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2301-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The possible molecular differences between these two forms of the UvrC protein and their physiological roles are discussed. Restriction enzymes Hin fI,NarI, EoRI, and Pst I, T4 polynucleotide kinase, bacterial alkaline phosphatase, acrylamide, bisacrylamide, agarose, and NACS Prepacs convertible columns (NACS PACS) were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The restriction enzyme BstNI was obtained from New England Biolabs. Yeast tRNA was obtained from Sigma. All 32P-labeled nucleotides were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech NEN Life Science Products, Inc. Nitrocellulose membranes (hydrophilic, 0.45 μm, HAWP) were purchased from Millipore. ΦX174 replicative form I (RFI) DNA and plasmid pBR322 were isolated and purified by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation. T7 phages were prepared by a method described by Yamamoto and Alberts (16Yamamoto K.R. Alberts B.M. Virology. 1970; 40: 734-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). T7 DNAs were prepared by removing proteins from phages by phenol and diethyl ether extractions. The 247-bp Hin fI-BstNI single 3′ end-32P-labeled fragments of pBR322 were isolated from a 383-bp BstNI fragment that had been agarose gel-purified and 3′ end-labeled with [α-32P]dTTP. The 174-bpEco RI-Hae III single 5′ end-32P-labeled fragments of pBR322 were prepared as described previously (17Pierce J.R. Case R. Tang M.-s. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5821-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The Eco RI-Pst I 750-bp fragments of pBR322 were isolated from agarose gel electrophoresis and32P-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP at both 5′ ends. ΦX174 RFI DNA, [3H]thymidine-labeled T7 DNA, and 32P-labeled defined DNA fragments were irradiated with a germicidal lamp (Sylvania, C15T8; major emission, 254 nm) to produce eight dimers or one dimer per DNA molecule. UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC proteins were purified from the E. coli K12 strain CH296 (uvrC34)- and DR1984 (recA1 uvrC34)-carrying plasmids pUNC45 (uvrA), pUNC211 (uvrB), or pDR3274 (uvrC; Ref. 16Yamamoto K.R. Alberts B.M. Virology. 1970; 40: 734-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). These plasmids and E. coli strains were kindly provided by Dr. A. Sancar (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). The pUVC1234 plasmid construct (12Sharma S. Stark T.F. Beattie W.G. Moses R.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2301-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which contains the endogenous uvrC operon, was a generous gift from Dr. R. Moses (University of Oregon, Portland, OR). UvrC protein was also purified from E. coli cells (MST 1) with the wild-type uvrC gene (17Pierce J.R. Case R. Tang M.-s. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5821-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Tang M.-s. Nazimiec M.E. Doisy R.P. Pierce J.R. Hurley L.H. Alderete B.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The UvrABC excision nuclease reaction was conducted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm ATP, and 1 mm dithtiothreitol. An aliquot of32P-labeled DNA or φX174 RFI DNA (0.2 μg) was reacted with 15 nm UvrA, 15 nm UvrB, and 15 nm UvrC in a volume of 25 μl for 60 min at 37 °C. For φX174 RFI DNA the reactions were stopped by adding 0.1% SDS and heating at 65 °C for 5 min, and the DNAs were then electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel in buffer containing 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA at 1 V/cm for 14 h. The gel was stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide to visualize the supercoiled and relaxed forms of DNA. The pictures were scanned by a Bio-Image Analyzer with a Visage 100 whole-band analysis software program. For 32P-labeled DNA fragments the reactions were terminated by phenol extractions. The labeled DNA was then ethanol precipitated, washed in 75% ethanol, dried, and dissolved in a formamide denaturing dye mix (80% v/v formamide, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). Chemical sequencing was carried out as described by Maxam and Gilbert (21Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8987) Google Scholar) with the modifications described (17Pierce J.R. Case R. Tang M.-s. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5821-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). DNA samples were heated at 90 °C (2 min) and quenched in an ice bath. The samples were applied to a sequencing gel, consisting of 8% acrylamide and 7 m urea in Tris borate-EDTA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm sodium borate, and 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.3), in parallel with the Maxam and Gilbert (21Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8987) Google Scholar) sequencing reactions. After electrophoresis the gel was dried in a Bio-Rad gel dryer and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. X-Omat RP films at −70 °C for various lengths of time. The intensity of bands was determined by scanning with a Bio-Image Analyzer as described above. 32P-labeled pBR322 DNA fragments or linearized φX174 RFI DNA, and [3H]thymidine-labeled T7 DNA were incubated with UvrC or UvrA at different protein/DNA ratios in UvrABC excision nuclease reaction buffer for 60 min at 37 °C. At the end of incubation the mixtures were chased with an excessive amount of calf thymus DNA for 10 s, filtered through a membrane (0.45 μm; HAWP, Millirpore), and washed with UvrABC excision nuclease reaction buffer without ATP for 10 s or electrophoresed in a 0.5% agarose gel in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 50 mmacetate, and 1 mm EDTA. The radioactivity in the dried membranes was counted in an LKB 1219 scintillation counter. The agarose gels were air-dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat RP films at −70 °C for various times. The intensity of bands was determined by scanning with a Bio-Image Analyzer. To determine the N-terminal amino acid sequence of UvrC, the proteins were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The UvrC band was eluted, and the first 12 N-terminal amino acids were determined by Beckman amino acid sequences according the method as described by Matsudaira (22Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots containing 1 μg of UvrC were incubated with 0.1% glutaraldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. Immediately after the reaction the proteins were denatured by boiling in SDS solution for 5 min, separated by 7% SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. 7 or 10% acrylamide, 0.32% bisacrylamide, and SDS were used as described by Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis the proteins were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and reacted with polyclonal UvrC antiserum (18Tang M.-s. Nazimiec M.E. Doisy R.P. Pierce J.R. Hurley L.H. Alderete B.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); the antigen-antibody complex was further conjugated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies and then detected by chemiluminescence (24Mattson D.M. Bellehumeur T.G. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 306-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Several purification schemes have been reported for UvrC purification, and they have in common two steps: phosphocellulose and ss-DNA-cellulose chromatography (15Thomas D.C. Levy M. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9875-9893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sancar A. Rupp W.D. Cell. 1983; 33: 249-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 26Yeung A.T. Mattes W.B. Oh E.Y. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6157-6161Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). UvrC proteins can be precipitated with polymin P before going through chromatographic separation (25Sancar A. Rupp W.D. Cell. 1983; 33: 249-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In these procedures UvrC is eluted last from an ss-DNA-cellulose column with 0.65 m KCl. We found that substituting a KCl gradient for the more usual step gradient to elute the ss-DNA-cellulose column results in the elution of two distinct peaks of A 280 material, and both peaks have UvrC activity (Fig. 1 A; details are described in the following sections). Because the two-peak elution profile of the UvrC protein has never been reported before, we then explored the possibility of whether the multistep purification procedure for UvrC was responsible for this striking pattern by simplifying the purification scheme. UvrC was purified from a cell sonicate (CH296 or DR1984 cells containing pDR3274 and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside) prepared in 0.3 mKCl. The supernatant after centrifugation was purified through a phosphocellulose column and then an ss-DNA-cellulose column without going through a polymin P precipitation step. Elution of the ss-DNA-cellulose column with a KCl gradient gives a similar profile as in Fig. 1 A, showing two peaks of protein (Fig.1 B). Both peaks contain a major (>95%) UvrC band of a molecular mass of 65,000 Da when separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 C); the amount of UvrC collected in the first peak fractions is approximately twice as much as in the second peak fractions. We refer to the two fractions of UvrC according to their elution positions as UvrCI (0.4 m KC1) and UvrCII (0.6m KC1). The activity of these two forms of UvrC in incising UV-induced DNA damage was tested. Various amounts of UvrC proteins were reacted with UV-irradiated φX174 RFI DNA (2.2 nm) in the presence of UvrA (15 nm) and UvrB (15 nm). (We term this reaction condition, which has a relatively high nucleotide/Uvr ratio, condition I). The results in Fig.2 show that both forms of UvrC were active in incising UV-irradiated, supercoiled DNA. However, the specific activity of UvrCII is lower than that of UvrCI; the former is one-fourth as active in incising UV-irradiated φX174 RFI DNA as the latter. Because the majority of proteins present in both peaks have a molecular mass (denatured by boiling in SDS solution) corresponding to that of UvrC, their N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined. We have found that the first 12 of the 13 N-terminal amino acids of both forms of UvrC are the same; starting from the second amino acid the sequence is: Asp-Gln-Phe-Asp-Ala-Lys-Ala-Phe-Leu-Lys-Thr-Val. Because the monopeptides of UvrCI and UvrCII not only have the same molecular mass but also have the same N-terminal amino acid sequence, and no other peptides have been found in association with these two forms of proteins (Fig. 1), the results raise the possibility that these two forms of UvrC could result from different folding or that the native form of these two proteins may be composed of different numbers of monopeptides, or both. To test these possibilities we have determined the molecular mass of these two forms of UvrC proteins by glutaraldehyde cross-link reaction and size exclusion chromatography (27Friedman P. Chen X. Bargonetti J. Prives C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3319-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that treatment of UvrCI with 0.1% glutaraldehyde resulted in one additional band corresponding to molecular mass of 130 kDa besides the 65-kDa band. In contrast, the same glutaraldehyde treatment of UvrCII resulted in two additional bands; one corresponding to 130 kDs, the same as observed with UvrCI treatment, and the other having a molecular mass >240 kDa. Results from size exclusion chromatography show that UvrCI eluted at a major peak corresponding to the bovine albumin position (68 kDa). In contrast, the UvrCI-UvrCII mixture eluted at two peaks corresponding to ∼68 and >232 kDa, respectively (Fig. 3 B). Together, these results suggest that UvrCI is a monomer, and UvrCII is a tetramer. It has been well established that the UvrABC excision nuclease makes dual incisions 6–8 bp 5′ and 3–5 bp 3′ to UV-induced pyrimidine dimers and other chemical-DNA adducts (for review, see Refs.1Sancar A. Tang M-s. Photochem. Photobiol. 1993; 57: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 2Van Houten B. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 45: 18-51Crossref Google Scholar, 3Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). However, it has been found that occasionally the 5′ and 3′ incisions induced by UvrABC may uncouple, and the uncoupled incision occurs in UV-, bulky chemical carcinogen-, and CC-1065-modified DNA (for review, see Ref. 2Van Houten B. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 45: 18-51Crossref Google Scholar). Selby and Sancar (28Selby C.P. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7184-7188Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have reported that “aged” UvrC proteins may lose their 5′ incision ability. To determine whether UvrCI and UvrCII, in combination with UvrA and UvrB (we term the collective function of Uvr proteins UvrABCI and UvrABCII excision nuclease, respectively), would have the same dual incision activity, UV-irradiated single 3′-end-32P-labeledHin fI-Bst NI 247-bp pBR322 DNA fragments (1 nm) or single 5′-end-32P-labeledEco RI-Hae III 174-bp pBR322 DNA fragments were reacted with 15 nm of these proteins (we term this reaction condition, which has a relatively low nucleotide/Uvr ratio, condition II). The results are shown in Fig. 4; although UvrABCI makes the expected dual incisions at pyrimidine dimers, under the same reaction conditions UvrABCII does not incise the same UV-irradiated linear DNA fragments (Fig. 4, A, comparelanes 11 and 15, and B, comparelanes 12 and 17). There are two possible explanations for these unexpected results; one is that UvrABCII is inactive in incising photodimers in linear DNA, and the other is that UvrCII may interfere with Uvr(A)2B-photodimer complex formation. It has been reported that the presence of excessive UvrA protein inhibits UvrABC excision activity, and the inhibition has been speculated to result from the binding of excessive UvrA proteins to damaged bases, which consequently prevents proper Uvr(A)2B-DNA damage complex formation (29Bertrand-Burggraf E.

The inability of UvrABCII to incise the small quantity of UV-irradiated linear DNA fragments shown in Fig. 4 cannot be attributable to an excessive amount of UvrA proteins, because the active UvrABCI reaction conditions contain the same amount of UvrA proteins as in the inactive UvrABCII reaction conditions. One of the major differences between conditions I and II is that although the nucleotide/UvrC ratio is 770 in condition I, it is between 10 and 17 in condition II; the difference between these two conditions is 45–77-fold. If the UvrCII protein is able to bind to ds-DNA and UvrCI is not, then the formation of a proper Uvr(A)2B-DNA damage complex may be affected by excessive amounts of UvrCII (but not UvrCI), similar to the effect of excessive UvrA proteins. To test this possibility we added different amounts of unirradiated, linearized φX174 RF DNA (competitive DNA) in condition II to reduce the protein/nucleotide ratio. The results in Fig. 4 show that although additional DNA, ranging from 0.05 to 0.2 μg, enhances UvrABCI excision activity, it affects UvrABCII incision activity more drastically, restoring the incision activity of UvrABCII to a level comparable with that of UvrABCI. These results also show that UvrABCII, in the presence of competitive DNA, makes dual incisions 6–8 bp 5′ and 3–4 bp 3′ of a photodimer in the substrate DNA in the same manner as UvrABCI does. It is worth noting that in the presence of excessive competitive DNA the incision activities of both UvrABCI and UvrABCII are reduced (Fig. 4, A, lanes 14 and 18, andB, lanes 16 and 21). The above results suggest that UvrCII may be a ds-DNA-binding protein, whereas UvrCI is not. To test this possibility the conventional nitrocellulose filter binding assay for two forms of UvrC and UvrA proteins was performed. Different amounts of Uvr proteins were added to a fixed amount of 3H-labeled T7 DNA (7.3 fmol) with or without UV irradiation to produce 8 dimers per DNA fragment. The protein-DNA mixtures were incubated in the standard UvrABC reaction solution for 60 min at 37 °C and then were chased with an excessive amount of cold DNA before filtering through nitrocellulose membranes. Results in Fig. 5 show that UvrCII indeed binds to ds-DNA, whereas UvrCI does not, and UvrCII-DNA binding is linearly proportional to UvrCII concentrations. Furthermore, it appears that there is no significant difference between the binding affinities of UvrCII to UV-irradiated and unirradiated DNA. These two features are in great contrast to UvrA-DNA binding, which is exponentially proportional to UvrA concentrations and shows higher affinity toward UV-irradiated DNA than nonirradiated DNA (31Mazur S.J. Grossman L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4432-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Consistent with these filter binding assay results, Fig. 6shows that the presence of UvrCI proteins does not affect the mobility of the DNA fragments; in contrast, the presence of UvrCII proteins retards the mobility of the labeled DNA fragments significantly. Scatchard plotting (with the assumption that UvrCII is a tetramer with a molecular mass of 272 kDs on the basis of cross-linking reaction results) renders the binding constant of UvrCII-ds-DNA of 9 × 108m−1 (Fig. 6), which is 110–112 that of UvrA. It is worth noting that a significant portion of the retarded DNA fragments distributes in a smear (in an overly exposed film; data not shown); the smear may result from dissociation of UvrCII from DNA during electrophoresis.Figure 6A, gel electrophoresis of DNA fragments reacted with UvrCI and UvrCII. Aliquots containing32P-end-labeled Eco RI-Pst I 750-bp pBR322 DNA fragments (14 fmol) were incubated with different amounts of UvrCI (0, 84, 168, 336, and 672 fmol) or UvrCII (0, 84, 168, 252, 336, 420, 504, and 672 fmol) under the same conditions as described in Fig.5. At the end of the incubation the protein-DNA mixtures were immediately electrophoresed in a 0.5% agarose gel in Tris borate-EDTA buffer. The autoradiographs were scanned, and the binding data were plotted as shown in B. Data points were obtained from results of both the gel retardation assay and the filter binding assay.

The average number of UvrCII bound per DNA fragment (υ) was calculated from the distribution of DNA in the various bands as a direct average: υ = Σnf n/Σf n, wheref n is the fraction of DNA fragments that hasn proteins bound (31Mazur S.J.

At the end of the incubation the sites and the extent of incision of these DNAs by UvrABCII (Fig.7) and the percentage of labeled DNA binding to UvrCII (Fig. 8) were determined by sequencing gel electrophoresis and filter binding assay, respectively. The incision activity of UvrABCII increases as the amount of the additional competitive DNA increases (Fig. 7). Conversely, the results in Fig.8 show that the fraction of damaged DNA bound with UvrCII decreases exponentially as a function of the concentrations of the competitive DNA. The relationship between the reduction of damaged DNA bound with UvrCII and the increase of UvrABCII incision is better demonstrated in Fig. 8, which shows that the incision reaches a plateau level when UvrCII-damaged DNA binding is reduced to a few percentiles, and further addition of competitive DNA slightly reduces incision. These results are consistent with the interpretation that the UvrCII-DNA binding hinders Uvr(A)2B-DNA damage complex formation and consequently reduces UvrABC incision activity.Figure 8Relationship between UvrCII-DNA binding and UvrABCII incision of UV-irradiated substrate DNA. The percentage of 32P-labeled, UV-irradiated DNA fragments retained in the filter attributable to UvrCII binding was calculated as described in Fig. 6.

Levy M. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9875-9893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was possible that the two forms of UvrC proteins produced by this plasmid may be different from that produced by the native endogenous uvrC operon. To test this, we isolated UvrC, from E. coli cells without harboring the pDR3274 plasmid. Cell lysates were chromatographed through phosphocellulose and ss-DNA-cellulose columns following the procedures described above. Although the wild-type cell lysates did not render two clear A 280 absorbance peaks corresponding to 0.4 and 0.6–0.7 m KCl, Western blotting results show that two peaks of UvrC protein were separated and eluted at these two KCl concentrations (Fig. 9). Together, these results suggest that two forms of UvrC are produced by the endogenous uvrC operon. The functions of uvrC are the least understood among the three uvr genes, uvrA, uvrB, anduvrC, which are involved in the initial incision step of nucleotide excision repair. Although in vitro it has been demonstrated that the addition of UvrC proteins to a Uvr(A)2B-DNA damage complex induces dual incisions 5′ and 3′ to damaged bases, several laboratories have reported that UV irradiation induces DNA single-strand breaks in uvrC34 mutant cells but not in uvrA and uvrB mutant cells, even though these three uvr mutant cells are unable to excise cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (19Tang M.-s.

Using a viralE. coli transfection system we have found that onlyuvrC mutant cells show low transfectivity for viral DNA containing N-(guanosin-8-yl)-2- aminofluorene adducts;uvrA and uvrB cells show the same transfectivity as do wild-type cells. In contrast, these three mutant cells have the same low transfectivity for UV-irradiated orN-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene and anti- and syn-benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide-modified viral DNA (20Tang M.-s. Lieberman M.W. Nature. 1982; 299: 646-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 35Tang M.-s. Pierce J.R. Doisy R.P. Nazimiec M.E. MacLeod M.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8429-8436Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These results indicate that uvrC gene products may function in a manner more complicated than simply participating in the incision step and may interact with proteins other than UvrA and UvrB in vivo. The understanding of UvrC function has been hampered by the scarcity of these proteins in cells and their instability. Purification of UvrC proteins has been achieved by using λ lysogens with theuvrC gene (36Yeung A.T. Mattes W.B. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2567-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 37Yeung A.T. Mattes W.B. Oh E.Y. Yoakum G.H. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8535-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or cells with a plasmid containing theuvrC gene (12Sharma S. Stark T.F. Beattie W.G. Moses R.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2301-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The method of purification is mainly based on the ability of UvrC proteins bind to ss-DNA. Yeung et al.(26Yeung A.T. Mattes W.B. Oh E.Y. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6157-6161Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) have eluted purified UvrC protein at 0.45 m KCl; however, using a step gradient, Thomas et al. (15Thomas D.C. Levy M. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9875-9893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that UvrC proteins were eluted completely at 0.65m KCl. Our modified method further separated the UvrC into two peaks, one at 0.4 m KCl and another at 0.6m KCl. It appears that the quantity of ss-DNA-cellulose used for column chromatography and the elution rate are the two critical factors for separating these two forms of UvrC proteins; we observed a single UvrC peak, which contained both UvrCI and UvrCII activities when the purification procedure involved a small quantity of ss-DNA-cellulose and a fast elution rate (data not shown). We have found that these two forms of UvrC proteins can be further purified by ds-DNA-cellulose chromatography but with low recovery (20%); the reason for this low recovery is not clear. However, we also have found that the two forms of UvrC prepared by ss-DNA-cellulose chromatography and those further purified by ds-DNA-cellulose chromatography have the same mobility in SDS-PAGE and the same pI (native form, 7.48; denatured form, 9.4), and in the presence of UvrA and UvrB, both showed a dual incision pattern on UV-irradiated DNA. The sources causing the differences in the ds-DNA binding and elution pattern in ss-DNA chromatography are unknown. Contrary to published results, we have found that the N termini of these two forms of UvrC proteins we have purified are not blocked, and the first 12 of the 13 N-terminal amino acids, starting from the second amino acid, are consistent with the result reported by Moolenaar et al. (13Moolenaar G.F. van Sluis C.A. Backendorf C.,. van de Putte P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4273-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) that the initiation codon for the uvrC gene starts at the 5′-GTG of positions 882–884 rather than at the 5′-ATG of positions 772–774 (14Sancar G.B. Sancar A. Rupp W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 4593-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The source of this discrepancy is unclear. Because the peptide in the two forms of UvrC have the same molecular mass and N-terminal amino acid sequence, it is possible that UvrCII may have resulted from aggregation of UvrCI. Although we are unable to exclude this possibility entirely, several lines of evidence suggest this may not be the case. First, so far we are unable to convert either form of UvrC to the other by treatments such as oxidation and reduction. Second, we show that only monomeric and tetrameric, but no dimeric and trimeric, UvrC proteins are obtained by size exclusion chromatography. Third, in the electrophoretically separated products of UvrCII treated with the cross-linking reagent glutaraldehyde, we observed mainly the monomeric and tetrameric, but no trimeric, forms of UvrC. Furthermore, we observed the existence of these two forms of UvrC in wild-type cells, even though the copy number of the UvrC proteins in these cells is very low (∼10 copies per cell). It is possible that the difference in ds-DNA binding resides in post-translation modification or in the association of cofactors, or both. If one UvrC form is modified or associated with some cofactors and the other is not, then the two UvrC proteins most likely would be observed in overproducing cells for the simple reason that overproduced UvrC proteins oversaturate the post-translation modification capacity or the amount of cofactors present in the cells. However, using the same purification protocol, we have isolated UvrC forms that eluted at 0.4 m KCl as well as at 0.6–0.7 m KCl from wild-type E. coli cells harboring no recombinantuvrC plasmid and E. coli cells with pUVC1234 plasmids containing the endogenous uvrC operon (12Sharma S. Stark T.F. Beattie W.G. Moses R.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2301-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because of the minute quantity of UvrC purified from these cells, we were unable to determine their activities. However, because even in cells producing minute amounts of UvrC proteins we were able to isolate UvrC that had an elution profile identical to that of UvrCI and UvrCII, it is likely that these two forms of UvrC proteins are the normaluvrC gene products and are not the results of overproduction. We speculate that UvrCII is a major form existing in wild-type cells for two reasons. One is that UvrCII should be active in incisionin vivo, because the cellular nucleotide/protein molar ratio is relatively large. The second reason is that because each cell has only <10 molecules of UvrC, and UvrCII does not form a complex with the free forms of the UvrA or UvrB protein, to account for the fast and efficient excision repair in vivo, the UvrC proteins must be concentrated in the genome area. The loose association of UvrCII to DNA would fulfill this critical requirement. We thank Dr. A. Sancar and Dr. R. Moses for providing uvrC-containing plasmids, Dr. A. Chen for determining pI, and Dr. S. Lloyd for determining the N-terminal amino acid sequence."

To a solution of enzyme (3 mg/ml) in buffer, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, hydrochloric acid was added to a final acid concentration of 1 m. This mixture was heated to 96 °C for 2 h. Zinc was then determined by atomic absorption spectrometry using a Unicam 919 spectrometer (Unicam, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Quenched flow experiments were performed with an SFM4/QS apparatus from Bio-Logic (Claix, France) equipped with a linear array of mixers, four independent syringes, and a computer-controlled valve. The apparatus was thermostated at 30 °C. A delay loop of 230 μl of nominal volume was used. Syringe 1 contained a reaction buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 100 mm KCl, and 0.002% sodium azide. Syringe 2 contained 125 μm [8-14C]GTP (320 μCi mmol−1) in reaction buffer. Syringe 3 contained 34 μm GTP-cyclohydrolase I (equivalent to 340 μm active sites) in reaction buffer. At the start of each experiment, the delay loop was washed with reaction buffer from syringe 1 and was then loaded with substrate solution from syringe 2 and with enzyme solution from syringe 3. The solutions were mixed at a ratio of 1:1 (v/v) and at a flow rate of 4 ml/s. After an appropriate delay, the reaction mixture in the delay loop was quenched by mixing with 0.2m trichloroacetic acid from syringe 4 at a ratio of 1:1 (v/v) and a flow rate of 4 ml min−1. The effluent was collected. Samples were centrifuged to remove protein and were frozen at −70 °C until further analysis. Aliquots of 100 μl were injected into a reversed phase column (4.6 × 250 mm, Hypersil RP18, 5 μm, Schambeck, Bad Honnef, Germany). The column was developed with isopropyl alcohol, triethylamine, 85% phosphoric acid, water (8:10:3:979 (v/v), pH 7). Separations were performed at room temperature with a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. The effluent was monitored by a continuous flow scintillation counter (Berthold LB 503, Wildbad, Germany) and a diode array photometer (J&M, Aalen, Germany). The concentration of GTP was determined photometrically (252 nm, ε252 nm = 13,700m−1 cm−1 (11Dawson R.C.M. Elliot D.C. Elliot W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. Oxford University Press, Oxford1986: 109Google Scholar)) as well as by scintillation counting; 2-amino-5-formylamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5′-triphosphate (Compound 4) and formate were measured by scintillation counting, and dihydroneopterin triphosphate was monitored photometrically (330 nm, ε330 nm = 6,300m−1 cm−1 (12Pfleiderer W. Blakely R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pterins. John Wiley & Son, New York1985: 43-114Google Scholar)). All calculations were run on an Intel PIII-600 personal computer. Rate constants were calculated by the program Scientist 2.02 (MicroMath, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT). GTP cyclohydrolase I is an inherently slow enzyme. The turnover rate under steady state conditions is 0.05 s−1/subunit, similar to that of G proteins that serve regulatory functions rather than metabolic functions. This low rate is not unusual for an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of a minor metabolite, and it provides favorable conditions for analysis by single turnover quenched flow experiments. Quenched flow experiments were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” using [8-14C]GTP as substrate. A 3-fold excess of enzyme subunits over substrate was used to minimize the effects of the negative cooperativity of GTP cyclohydrolase I that had been reported earlier (9Bracher A. Fischer M. Eisenreich W. Ritz H. Schramek N. Boyle P. Gentili P. Huber R. Nar H. Auerbach G. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16727-16735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The enzyme-catalyzed reaction was allowed to proceed for periods of 0.125–150 s. The reaction was then quenched with trichloroacetic acid, and the reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC and monitored by multiwavelength photometry and scintillation counting. Compound4 and formate were assessed on the basis of the radioactivity measurements, dihydroneopterin triphosphate was assessed on the basis of absorbance at 330 nm (Fig.2), and GTP was assessed on the basis of photometry at 254 nm as well as scintillation counting. Other intermediates could not be assessed quantitatively because of overlapping HPLC peaks. Data from a typical quenched flow experiment are summarized in Fig.3 and afford several preliminary conclusions: (i) the consumption of GTP is biphasic by which a rapid decrease to a level around 20% is followed by a very slow further decrease; (ii) the formation of formate proceeds relatively rapidly and is virtually complete after 15 s; (iii) the formation of dihydroneopterin triphosphate is substantially less rapid and reaches its 50% value after about 30 s; and (iv) in line with the expectation, dihydroneopterin triphosphate and formate are formed in stoichiometric amounts, and their final concentrations are equivalent to consumed GTP. The incomplete consumption of GTP, at least during a period of more than 100 s, is not easily explained in light of the 3-fold excess of active sites over the profferred substrate. From the crystallographic studies, it is known that GTP cyclohydrolase I ofE. coli can easily lose zinc (8Auerbach G. Herrmann A. Bracher A. Bader G. Gütlich M. Fischer M. Neukamm M.

In fact, the metal ion had not been found in the initial crystallographic studies (7Nar H. Huber R. Meining W. Schmid C. Weinkauf S. Bacher A. Structure. 1995; 3: 459-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) because substantially zinc-depleted protein samples had been inadvertently used, and a crystal structure of the E. coli enzyme that bound zinc had been obtained only recently (8Auerbach G. Herrmann A. Bracher A. Bader G. Gütlich M. Fischer M. Neukamm M. Garrido-Franco M. Richardson J. Nar H. Huber R. Bacher A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13567-13572Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the reconstitution of a partially zinc-depleted enzyme has not been possible because the enzyme precipitates upon the addition of zinc salts even at low concentrations. We assume tentatively that GTP can be trapped in active sites devoid of zinc and can thus escape catalytic conversion for long periods because the metal ion is absolutely required for catalytic activity (it is known from the crystallographic studies that the zinc-depleted enzyme can bind GTP tightly). In typical enzyme preparations, the zinc content was ∼0.8 zinc ion/subunit as estimated from atomic absorption spectrometry. These data are in agreement with the fraction of GTP (∼15%) remaining after a reaction time of 3 min in a substoichiometric quenched flow experiment. Slow reequilibration of GTP trapped in metal-depleted active sites with the bulk solvent could then explain the continuing slow consumption of GTP extending over many minutes. The enzyme-catalyzed formation of Compound 4 from GTP is a reversible reaction (9Bracher A. Fischer M. Eisenreich W. Ritz H. Schramek N. Boyle P. Gentili P. Huber R. Nar H. Auerbach G. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16727-16735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Using the H179A mutant of GTP cyclohydrolase I that can convert GTP to Compound 4 but not beyond that intermediate, a value of 0.1 has been reported earlier for the equilibrium constant at pH 7. In the present study, we found a value of 0.14 at pH 8.5 and 30 °C by steady state analysis of the reaction catalyzed by the H179A mutant of GTP cyclohydrolase I. The release of formate by the hydrolysis of Compound 4 should be essentially irreversible on entropic grounds. Because formate is a final product of the GTP cyclohydrolase reaction, it is possible to limit the analysis to the initial steps of single turnover experiments that are conducive to the formation of formate from GTP as summarized in the reaction Scheme FS1. Scheme FS1 can be described by the following set of differential equations (Model I):d[1]dt=−k1·[1]+k1K·[4]Equation 1 d[4]dt=k1·[1]−k1K·[4]−k3·[4]Equation 2 d[5]dt=k3·[4]Equation 3 K=k1k2=[4]eq[1]eqEquation 4 The program Scientist 2.02 (MicroMath, Inc.) was used to fit that set of equations to the experimental data (Fig.4). The GTP concentration data were corrected for the fraction of GTP that remained intact even after a period of more than 100 s. The best fit was obtained with the rate constants summarized in TableI.Table IRate constants of the GTP cyclohydrolase I reactionRate constantFormation of formate from GTP (Model I)Formation of dihydroneopterin triphosphate from GTP (Model II)k 10.7 ± 0.4 s−10.9 ± 0.4 s−1k 22.7 s−15.3 s−1k 32.0 ± 0.6 s−12.0 ± 0.9 s−1k 40.03 ± 0.002 s−1k 1/k 20.29 ± 0.160.17 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab The concentration of Compound 4 reaches a maximum after about 1 s, and the ratio of Compound 4 and GTP approaches a plateau value of 0.175 ± 0.025 (Fig.5). This value corresponds within the limits of experimental accuracy to the equilibrium constant of 0.14 observed at pH 8.5 and 30 °C under steady state conditions with the H179A mutant (see above). The final part of the reaction sequence involves the formation of the dihydropteridine ring system from Compound 5 under elimination of a water molecule. The newly formed double bond is conjugated to the π-electron system of the pyrimidinone ring. The reaction is therefore expected to be exergonic and practically irreversible. Because it is obvious from Fig. 1 that Compound5 is formed from Compound 4 at the same rate as formate, a simplified kinetic scheme for the formation of dihydroneopterin triphosphate from GTP can be rendered as SchemeFS2. Scheme FS2 is described by the following set of differential equations (Model II):d[1]dt=−k1·[1]+k1K·[4]Equation 5 d[4]dt=k1·[1]−k1K·[4]−k3·[4]Equation 6 d[5]dt=k3·[4]−k4·[5]Equation 7 d[formate]dt=k3·[4]Equation 8 d[10]dt=k4·[5]Equation 9 K=k1k2=[4]eq[1]eqEquation 10 The fitting of these equations to the experimental data was again performed with the program Scientist 2.02 (Fig.6) using k 1,k 2, and k 3 values from the previous simulation as initial parameters. The rate constants for the best fit are shown in Table I. The formation of dihydroneopterin triphosphate from Compound5 proceeds with a rate constant of 0.03 s−1. Similar values of k 1, k 2, and k 3 were obtained in the simulation according to Model I and Model II (Table I). It follows that the Amadori rearrangement or the subsequent ring closure reaction is limiting the rate of the overall reaction. However, it should be noted that the rate constant k 4 probably does not describe a single reaction step. GTP cyclohydrolase I catalyzes a complex reaction sequence involving the cleavage of two different CN bonds and a rearrangement of the carbohydrate side chain followed by the formation of the pyrazine ring of the product, dihydroneopterin triphosphate. Moreover, a conformational reorientation of the reactant appears to be required in the second part of the reaction trajectory. Recent biochemical and crystallographic studies have shown that a zinc ion bound to amino acid residues Cys-110, Cys-181, and His-113 is absolutely required for the hydrolytic opening of the imidazole ring of GTP (8Auerbach G. Herrmann A. Bracher A. Bader G. Gütlich M. Fischer M. Neukamm M. Garrido-Franco M. Richardson J. Nar H. Huber R. Bacher A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13567-13572Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). GTP in complex with the C110S mutant protein that is unable to bind zinc remained stable during a period of several months. 3C. Hösl, unpublished data. It is at present unknown whether the zinc ion is also involved in the Amadori rearrangement of the carbohydrate side chain. Saturation mutagenesis of the active site amino acid residues has also shown that histidine 179 is absolutely required for the cleavage of the formamide bond of Compound 4 (9Bracher A. Fischer M. Eisenreich W. Ritz H. Schramek N. Boyle P. Gentili P. Huber R. Nar H. Auerbach G. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16727-16735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This study reports the concentrations of intermediates subsequent to acid quenching of the reaction mixture. The possibility must be considered that certain intermediates could undergo secondary chemical reactions as a consequence of the acid treatment. Specifically, the hypothetical GTP hydrate, Compound 2, could be converted to GTP or Compound 4 (Compound 3 is significantly less stable) by the acid treatment. Because ring opening is rapid by comparison with the overall enzyme reaction, this uncertainty appears tolerable. The kinetic scheme used for the interpretation of the experimental data represents a rigorous simplification. It can be estimated that about two dozen rate constants would be required for a comprehensive description including all reaction steps. There can be no doubt that the experimental system is substantially underdetermined. However, it is also likely that several reaction steps, in particular the numerous proton transfer reactions required, are rapid by comparison with the reactions described by k 1 tok 4 and would therefore not influence the overall catalytic rate of the enzyme to a significant degree. The interpretation of the data substantially benefits from the fact that one of the final products, formate, is released early in the reaction sequence. Therefore, it was justified to simulate the conversion of GTP to formate rather than to dihydroneopterin triphosphate. This simplified approach afforded starting values for the rate constants k 1–k 3. The use of that set of parameters resulted in the rapid convergence of the subsequent simulation involving all experimental data (including the formation of dihydroneopterin triphosphate) and the kinetic constants k 1–k 4. Both numerical analyses gave similar values fork 1–k 3 within the experimental limits. It should also be noted that the ratio ofk 1/k 3 is numerically similar to the estimated equilibrium constant for the reversible conversion of GTP to Compound 4 within the limits of experimental accuracy. The internal consistency of these data supports the validity of the simplified kinetic scheme used for data interpretation. The carbohydrate side chain isomerization catalyzed by GTP cyclohydrolase I is similar to the Amadori rearrangement catalyzed by phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase in the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 7). The turnover number of phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase (bifunctional enzyme fromE. coli) is 40 s−1 (13Hommel U. Eberhard M. Kirschner K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5429-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). By comparison, the rate constant for the conversion of Compound 5 to dihydroneopterin triphosphate is 0.03 s−1. These reaction rates differ by three orders of magnitude. The Amadori rearrangement and/or ring closure reaction step is rate-limiting in the overall GTP cyclohydrolase I reaction sequence. GTP cyclohydrolase I catalyzes the first and possibly rate-determining step in the biosynthesis of trace metabolites (tetrahydrofolate in bacteria and plants, tetrahydrobiopterin in animals). The very low overall rate of the enzyme is similar to those of other enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of heterocyclic vitamins and coenzymes (Table II). These low reaction rates are likely to reflect the metabolic needs of the respective organisms rather than a high activation barrier of the respective reactionsper se. GTP cyclohydrolase I is also likely to have evolved for a low reaction rate. However, it is surprising that the terminal part of the reaction sequence rather than one of the initial steps is actually rate-limiting.Table IITurnover rates of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of heterocyclic vitamins and coenzymesEnzymek(s−1) per subunitRef.GTP cyclohydrolase I (E. coli)0.05(8Auerbach G.

Macromolecular interactions among DNA, RNA, and E. coli RNA polymerase in the elongation complexes have been mapped (2Nudler E. Avetissova E. Markovtsov V. Goldfarb A.

A double clamp model has been proposed for elongating E. coli RNA polymerase where DNA entry and RNA exit sites are directed opposite to each other in the same region (5Nudler E. Gusarov I. Avetissova E. Kozlov M. Goldfarb A. Science. 1998; 281: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence (6Chan C.L. Landick R. Transcription: Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press, NY1994: 297-321Google Scholar, 7Chamberlin M.J. Harvey Lect. 1995; 88: 1-21Google Scholar) also is consistent with this mechanism for RNA polymerase action. The T7 RNA polymerase, a single-subunit protein of 99 kDa, is capable of initiating transcription promoter-specifically, elongating with high processivity and terminating in the absence of additional factors. The mechanism of initiation and termination of T7 RNA polymerase has been studied extensively because of its simplicity of structure and reaction system. On the other hand, elongation has been little studied, mainly because a series of stable and active ternary elongation complexes have not been obtained with the T7 RNA polymerase. The overall three-dimensional structures of T7 RNA polymerase complexed with an open promoter (8Cheetham G.M.T. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and a transcribing initiation complex (9Cheetham G.M.T. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) are similar to that of free enzyme (10Sousa R. Chung Y.J. Rose J.P. Wang B.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Some regions, including the active site, change into a more compact structure in the initiation complex. Structural information on elongation complexes with a growing transcript has not yet been determined. Several lines of evidence have suggested that the structure of the T7 RNA polymerase ternary complex changes when it proceeds from the initiation phase to the elongation phase. Both protease sensitivity (11Sousa R. Patra D. Lafer E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 319-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and the protected region of the DNA template strand in footprinting with methidiumpropyl-EDTA-Fe(II) greatly change (12Ikeda R.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3614-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 13Sastry S.S. Hearst J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1091-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) during the switch from initiation to elongation. The length of the DNA-RNA hybrid also changes from 2–4 bp1 in the initiation complex (11Sousa R. Patra D. Lafer E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 319-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) to 7 bp in an arrested elongation complex (13Sastry S.S. Hearst J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1091-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the macromolecular interactions and the structures of the active ternary elongation complexes have not yet been examined. In this study, we obtained a series of active and stable elongation complexes of the T7 RNA polymerase prepared by walking the enzyme along an immobilized DNA template. To probe RNA-protein interactions in ternary elongation complexes, a 4-thio-UMP was incorporated into the nascent transcripts and used to photocross-link RNA to the polymerase. Our cross-linking results suggest that the RNA runs from the active site toward a C-terminal region in the finger domain, rather than an N-terminal region near the thumb domain, in active elongation complexes of the T7 RNA polymerase. The 216-bp Bgl II fragment of pET3 (14Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar) containing a T7 promoter and the Tφ terminator was inserted into the Bam HI site of pUC19 (15Yanisch-perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene. 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11465) Google Scholar). GGG at position 19–21 (relative to the transcription start site at +1) was mutated to TTT to avoid formation of an RNA hairpin structure. Transcription templates were obtained by polymerase chain reactions using biotinylated reverse and forward M13 primers and were immobilized by incubating with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynal, Inc.) at room temperature for 15 min. The biotinylated templates (30 pmol) bound to streptavidin beads were incubated with 60 μl of an equimolar T7 RNA polymerase (United States Biochemicals) in transcription buffer A of 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 6 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 10 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 5 min. The transcription reaction was started by adding 60 μl of a ribonucleotide mixture to final concentrations of 0.05 mm ATP, 0.05 mmGTP, and 0.005 mm CTP and continued for 20 min to produce a 15-mer RNA complex, TEC15. After five washes with 0.5 ml of transcription buffer B consisting of 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 6 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm KCl, the beads were resuspended in 120 μl of buffer B containing 0.33 μm [α-32P]UTP (3,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated at room temperature for 2 min to obtain 32P-labeled TEC18. After four washes, the beads were resuspended in 0.8 ml of buffer B, and a 15-μl aliquot was withdrawn. The washed beads were then resuspended in 115 μl of buffer B containing 0.5 μm ATP for 2 min to obtain TEC21. TEC22 and TEC23 were obtained similarly in 110- and 105-μl reaction volumes, respectively. A photo-reactive analog of UMP, 4-thio-UMP was incorporated into the +24 site with incubation in a 100-μl mixture of 5 μm4-thio-UTP and transcription buffer C consisting of 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, 6 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm KCl at 37 °C for 2 min. The 4-thiouridine-incorporated radioactive TEC24 was elongated further with suitable ribonucleotides along the template sequence to TEC25, TEC26, TEC27, TEC30, TEC31, TEC32, TEC34, TEC36, TEC38, TEC40, TEC41, TEC43, TEC44, TEC47, TEC48, and TEC51 in progressively smaller reaction volumes. A 5-μl portion of each 15-μl aliquot was mixed with 10 μl of gel loading buffer of 10 mm EDTA, 12 murea, and 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue and was loaded onto an 8m urea, 10% polyacrylamide gel. A 10-μl portion of each elongation complex aliquot was transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube placed on ice and was then subjected to UV irradiation for 20 min using a 360-nm lamp UVGL-25 (Ultraviolet Products), as described previously (3Markovtsov V. Mustaev A. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3221-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Each irradiated sample was mixed with 2.5 μl of gel loading buffer consisting of 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% (w/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 14.4 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue and then heated to 95 °C for 5 min. It was then loaded onto an 8% polyacrylamide/SDS gel for separation of the cross-linked and uncross-linked polymerase. The electrophoresis buffer, pH 8.3 consisted of 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS. The trypsin cleavage site of elongating T7 RNA polymerase was mapped by using N-terminal histidine-tagged T7 RNA polymerase that was produced in E. coli from pKK-HisT7 (16Han K.G. Lee S.S. Kang C. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 16: 103-10819Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The plasmid was constructed by Hoseok Song and Changwon Kang (16Han K.G. Lee S.S. Kang C. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 16: 103-10819Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) who transferred the T7 polymerase gene from pAR1219 into the Xho I site of pET-tac, derived from pET15b (Novagen). The 21-mer transcript-containing elongation complex of the His-tagged polymerase was obtained by walking and was partially digested by trypsin. The polypeptides separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting. The membrane was probed with a monoclonal His-1 antibody against poly(His) (Sigma) and incubated with anti-mouse immunoglobulin G conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) as described previously (17Sambrook J. Fritisch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1989: 1860-1875Google Scholar). To map the cross-linked sites the RNA-linked elongation complexes were partially digested with trypsin (18Muller D.K. Martin C.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5763-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). They were also denatured and partially digested by hydroxylamine (3Markovtsov V. Mustaev A. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3221-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), 2-nitro-4-thiocyanobenzoic acid (19Jacobson G.R. Schaffer M.H. Stark G.R. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6583-6591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cyanogen bromide (20Grachev M.A. Lukhtanov E.A. Mustaev A.A. Zaychikov E.F. Abdukayumov M.N. Rabinov I.V. Richter V.I. Skoblov Y.S. Chistyakov P.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), as described previously. Cleavage products were isolated by an 8–15% gradient or a 10% polyacrylamide/SDS gel in a Tris-glycine buffer, pH 8.3 of 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS. Prestained standards of different protein sizes were purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories. Productive elongation complexes of the phage T7 RNA polymerase were prepared by walking of the polymerase along an immobilized template DNA. The 5′-end of template strand was immobilized by biotin-streptavidin conjugation. The template used here had the same T7 transcription unit as pET3, except for TTT at residues 19–21 from the initiation site (Fig. 1 A) and allowed for production of 15-mer RNA in the absence of UTP in transcription reactions. The 15-mer RNA in the complex, called TEC15, was extended to an 18-mer by the incorporation of [α-32P]UMP at three residues, 16–18. A photo-reactive analog 4-thio-UMP was then incorporated at the 24th residue. The elongation complex was still active in further elongation after storage at 4 °C for a week. Thus, all possible elongation complexes from TEC15 to TEC51 were produced by RNA extension with one kind of nucleotide at a time, as partially shown in Fig.1 B. The transcription complexes from TEC24 to TEC47 in which the RNA contained a photocross-linker and three radioactive residues were irradiated with λ360 nm UV. Upon separation of the cross-linked complexes from the uncross-linked RNA by SDS-PAGE, the radiolabeled RNA was shown to be cross-linked to the polymerase throughout all the complexes at least to a low level, as shown in Fig.2. The radioactivity of a cross-linked complex was normalized against the total radioactivity of RNA in each lane. The resulting relative yield of cross-linking appeared to be the highest in two complexes, TEC24 and TEC32 (Fig. 2 B). Thus, cross-linking was most efficient when the photocross-linker (placed at the 24th residue) was positioned at the 3′-end of transcript RNA (in TEC24) and 8 nucleotides upstream (in TEC32). These experiments were repeated with the complexes where the photocross-linker was separately incorporated at the 22nd, 32nd, and 38th residues of the transcripts. When the cross-linker was at the 22nd residue, the 22-mer and 30-mer RNA, respectively in TEC22(sU22) and TEC30(sU22), produced the most predominant cross-linking (Fig.2 A). Likewise, with the cross-linker at the 32nd residue, TEC32(sU32) and TEC40(sU32) were cross-linked to the greatest extent (Fig. 2 C). Also with the cross-linker at the 38th residue, TEC38(sU38) produced the most pronounced cross-linking (Fig.2 D). TEC46(sU38) could not be isolated because AMP was consecutively incorporated into the 45th to 47th residues. TEC44(sU38) and TEC47(sU38), however, produced only a residual level of cross-linking like the other complexes. Thus, the polymerase-linking sites of transcripts were the same regardless of RNA length and cross-linker position. The two RNA-linking sites of the elongating polymerase might be different from each other, because they are separated by 8 nucleotides on elongating transcripts. The two sites, named 3′-end and −9 contact sites here, were mapped individually by enzymatic and chemical proteolysis of the cross-linked elongation complexes. Native T7 RNA polymerase is susceptible to proteolytic cleavage by trypsin. Initial cleavage occurs near Lys172 or Lys180 under mild conditions and results in a nicked RNA polymerase consisting of N-terminal 20-kDa and C-terminal 79-kDa fragments (18Muller D.K. Martin C.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5763-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It was not clear, however, if the cleavage site was still the same in the elongating RNA polymerase. To address this issue, the T7 RNA polymerase that was histidine-tagged at the N terminus was used for walking to TEC24. When such an elongation complex was digested by trypsin under mild conditions, only the 20-kDa fragment was detected on a Western blot with an anti-histidine antibody (data not shown). Thus, trypsin cleaves the T7 RNA polymerase initially at the N-terminal one-fifth location in an elongation complex similar to free enzyme under the conditions used (Fig. 3). Partial digestion of the RNA-linked complexes TEC24(sU24) and TEC32(sU24) with trypsin yielded only one radiolabeled fragment whose size was about 90 kDa (Fig.4 A). Molecular masses of the 24- and 32-mer RNA are ∼7,600 and 10,100, respectively. Thus, RNA was cross-linked to the C-terminal 79-kDa fragment of the polymerase, but not to the N-terminal 20-kDa fragment in both complexes. When a 4-thiouridine was incorporated in the transcripts at the 22nd, 32nd, and 38th residue positions, the results of trypsin cleavage mapping were the same (data not shown). Hydroxylamine was then used to map the RNA-linking sites of elongating T7 RNA polymerase. There are only two hydroxylamine cleavage sites on the T7 RNA polymerase (Fig. 3), but total digestion should produce three polypeptides of approximately the same size (32, 34, and 33 kDa from the N-terminus). Thus, SDS-PAGE analysis of partial cleavage fragments of 32–34, 66–67, and 99 kDa would not identify the linked region. However, partial cleavage of the RNA-linked 79-kDa fragment would produce different sets of radiolabeled fragments, depending on which of three regions is linked to the RNA. The elongation complex TEC24(sU24), containing the cross-linker at the 24th residue of transcripts, was analyzed. The radiolabeled RNA-linked 79-kDa fragment was eluted from an SDS-PAGE gel and partially digested with hydroxylamine. The fragments of (33+8), (67+8), and (79+8) kDa were radioactive whereas those of (12+8) and (46+8) kDa did not show any radioactivity (Fig. 4 B). These results unambiguously demonstrated that the 3′-end was cross-linked to the C-terminal one-third region of Gly589–Ala883 (Fig. 3). Elongation complex TEC32(sU24) was also analyzed in the same way. Only fragments of (33+10), (67+10), and (79+10) kDa were radioactive. (The 32-mer RNA is 10 kDa.) Thus, the −9 residue was also cross-linked to the same C-terminal one-third region (Fig. 3). In mapping experiments with 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid, single-hit digestion conditions were used, because there are 12 Cys cleavage targets (Fig. 3). As RNA is linked to the C-terminal one-third region, only the smallest radiolabeled fragment produced under such conditions can determine the linked region. Thus, fragment complexes smaller than about 50 kDa (for Ser541–Ala883 peptide plus RNA) were closely examined. In the case of single-hit digestions of TEC24(sU24), the smallest radiolabeled fragment was of (38+8) kDa (Fig.5, A and B,filled arrows), representing the size of the Ser541–Ala883 region, and the (18+8)-kDa fragment of Ala724–Ala883 was not observed. The fragments of (46+8), (60+8), (69+8), (74+8), and (85+8) kDa were also radioactive, possibly representing the Ala468–Ala883, Pro348–Ala883, Val272–Ala883, Ile217–Ala883, and Leu125–Ala883 regions, respectively. Therefore, the cross-linked fragments contained the Ser541–Cys723 region. This mapping was supported by the results of more extensive digestion at a higher pH or for a longer reaction time. A group of bands around 36 kDa (Fig. 5,A and B, arrows) should not have been observed if the cross-linker were located in the other regions, Ala724–Cys839 (13 kDa) or Asp840–Ala883 (5 kDa). Combining the results of hydroxylamine mapping, the 3′-end contact site is in the region of Gly589–Cys723 (Fig. 3). Single-hit cleavage patterns of TEC32(sU24) were different from that of TEC24(sU24). The smallest observed fragment was of (18+10) kDa (Fig. 5,A and B, filled arrows), reflecting the size of the Ala724–Ala883 peptide, and a (5+10)-kDa fragment of Asp840–Ala883 was not observed. These results were consistent with those of more extensive digestion, as the smallest observed fragment was of (13+10) kDa (Fig. 5,A and B, arrow) possibly containing the 13-kDa Ala724–Cys839 peptide. Thus, the −9 contact site is located between Ala724 and Cys839 (Fig.3). There are 26 potential Met sites of cyanogen bromide cleavage (Fig. 3). When the denatured TEC24(sU24) was treated with cyanogen bromide under single-hit digestion conditions (Fig. 5 C), the smallest radioactive fragment was of (28+8) kDa for the Thr636–Ala883 region. Thus, the 3′-end contact site is in the Thr636–Met666 region. Likewise the smallest fragment of TEC32(sU24) was of (21+10) kDa for Asn697–Ala883 (Fig. 5 C), suggesting that the −9 contact site is in the Ala724–Met750 region. Fragments larger than that were also observed as expected, except for those of (24+10) kDa (for Phe667–Ala883) and (23+10) kDa (for Ala678–Ala883). Sites at 666 and 677 were not accessible. Cross-links in elongation complexes TEC32(sU32) and TEC40(sU32) that contained the photocross-linker at the 32nd residue were also mapped in the same way. The mapping results were the same as above; the Thr636–Met666 and Ala724–Met750 regions, when located at −1 and −9 positions, respectively (data not shown). Transcription elongation complexes of the T7 RNA polymerase have been obtained either by placing psoralen cross-link site specifically downstream from a promoter (13Sastry S.S. Hearst J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1091-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or by withholding a ribonucleotide from a transcription reaction mixture (21Zhou W. Doetsch P.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14926-14934Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These arrested or stalled ternary elongation complexes were not subjected to further elongation. In this study, several series of active ternary complexes of the T7 RNA polymerase were obtained by the polymerase walking method. It was achieved here by immobilizing biotinylated DNA templates with streptavidin beads rather than by immobilizing the RNA polymerase. Elongation complexes of both intact and N-terminal histidine-tagged polymerases halted because of missing nucleotides were capable of extending transcripts with replenishment of nucleotides. A 4-thio-UMP was incorporated separately at four different sites (22nd, 24th, 32nd, and 38th residues) in transcripts, and four series of elongation complexes were obtained by walking. Major photocross-links between RNA and polymerase are observed when the cross-linker is positioned at the 3′-end (−1) of growing transcripts and 8 nucleotides upstream (−9), regardless of how long RNA is and how far the cross-linker is from the 5′-end (Fig. 2). Thus, two separate residues of elongating transcripts closely interact with RNA polymerase. 4-Thiouridine appears to be indiscriminate when cross-linking to amino acids in a protein because of its high photoreactivity (22Favre A. Bioorganic Photochemistry. Wiley & Sons, NY1990: 379-425Google Scholar, 23Meisenheimer K.M. Koch T.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 101-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Thus, photoreactive groups of the other residues may not be in close contact with the polymerase, although the nearby amino acids, if there are any, may not have been reactive. The upstream (−9) nucleotide that is near to the protein is also near the DNA-RNA hybrid of ∼7 bp, as determined from the work of Sastry and Hearst (13Sastry S.S. Hearst J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1091-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). When the movement of T7 RNA polymerase was blocked by psoralen cross-link at +36, the bottom strand of DNA between +30 and +36 was resistant to single-strand-specific T7 endonuclease. Elongating transcripts were previously found to interact with E. coli RNA polymerase also at two sites (5Nudler E. Gusarov I. Avetissova E. Kozlov M. Goldfarb A. Science. 1998; 281: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). RNA distance between the two sites (8–9 residues) in E. coli is similar to that in T7, possibly reflecting the similar length of DNA-RNA hybrid within elongation complexes. The upstream site, however, is much broader inE. coli (about 9 nucleotide residues) than in T7 complex (about 1 residue). Although the hybrid length is apparently similar in T7 and E. coli RNA polymerase, stability of elongation complexes to high salt in each case differs significantly, suggesting that the hybrid itself does not play the major role in complex stability. The shorter RNA binding site in T7 polymerase and/or unlocked DNA-binding site could explain the difference in stability. The two residues at the 3′-end and −9 were found to cross-link to two different regions of elongating T7 RNA polymerase, when mapped using trypsin, hydroxylamine, 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid, and cyanogen bromide. The RNA 3′-end linking region is between Thr636and Met666 (Fig. 6). This is a part of the O-helix, which has been considered to include active site residues. A mutation of Tyr639 to Phe previously resulted in incorporation of dNTP as well as rNTP, suggesting that it is involved in nucleotide binding (24Sousa R. Padilla R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4609-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of the initiation complex, the O-helix residues Met635, Thr636, and Phe644 interact with incoming rNTP (9Cheetham G.M.T. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Therefore, the active site region appears to be conserved from initiation to elongation processes. It is surprising that the upstream RNA (−9) binding region is close to the C terminus, between Ala724 and Met750 (Fig.6), because the N-terminal 20-kDa fragment has been thought to be associated with RNA binding and processivity of the elongation complex. Exogenous RNA binding was previously abolished in the C-terminal 80-kDa fragment (18Muller D.K. Martin C.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5763-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). E148A mutant was defective in RNA oligomer binding (25He B. Rong M. Durbin R.K. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Also, based on the photocross-linking results with the photoreactive group linked to the 5′-end of nascent RNA, Sastry and Ross (26Sastry S.S. Ross B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9111-9116Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) proposed that regions between 144 and 168 and between 1 and 93 interact with emerging RNA and form a solvent-accessible RNA binding channel. Based on these previous results, Cheetham and Steitz (9Cheetham G.M.T. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) drew an RNA path toward the thumb domain in the N-terminal region in their model based on the crystal structure of initiation complex. According to our results, however, elongating RNA travels from the active site region toward a C terminus proximal region rather than an N terminus proximal region (Fig. 6). Elongating and exogenous RNAs appear to bind different regions of the polymerase. In the cross-linking experiments by Sastry and Ross (26Sastry S.S. Ross B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9111-9116Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the ternary complex was arrested with only 5–8-mer transcripts, probably had not escaped from abortive initiation cycling, and the linker used was rather long. In our model, RNA exits in the tunnel through the finger region in the elongation complex (Fig. 6). Thus, the RNA-exiting region is different from the DNA-entering region. The RNA-exiting region () partially overlaps with the promoter-specificity loop (). This may reflect structural continuation of template DNA strand in initiation and elongation. More interestingly, these two regions form a bent channel in the structure of the initiation complex (9Cheetham G.M.T. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Recently, DNA in the initiation complex was found to be bent 40–60 degrees around the transcription start site (27Újvári A. Martin C.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas the intrinsic bend of the promoter was much smaller (28Lee S.S. Kang C. Korean Biochem. J. 1991; 24: 673-679Google Scholar). The bending formed to facilitate DNA melting for initiation would be maintained during the elongation stage."
