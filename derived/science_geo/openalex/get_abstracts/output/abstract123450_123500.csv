https://openalex.org/W2090980124,"We have previously shown that multidrug-resistant cancer cells display elevated levels of glucosylceramide (Lavie, Y., Cao, H., Bursten, S. L., Giuliano, A. E., and Cabot, M. C. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 19530-19536). In this study we used the multidrug-resistant human breast cancer cell line MCF-7-Adriamycin-resistant (AdrR), which exhibits marked accumulation of glucosylceramide compared with the parental MCF-7 wild type (drug-sensitive) cell line, to define the relationship between glycolipids and multidrug resistance (MDR). Herein it is shown that clinically relevant concentrations of tamoxifen, verapamil, and cyclosporin A, all circumventors of MDR, markedly decrease glucosylceramide levels in MCF-7-AdrR cells (IC50 values, 1.0, 0.8, and 2.3 μM, respectively). In intact cells, tamoxifen inhibited glycosphingolipid synthesis at the step of ceramide glycosylation. In cell-free assays for glucosylceramide synthase, tamoxifen (1:10 molar ratio with ceramide) inhibited glucosylceramide formation by nearly 50%. In cell cultures, inhibition of glucosylceramide synthesis by tamoxifen is correlated with its ability to sensitize MCF-7-AdrR cells to Adriamycin toxicity. Moreover, treatment of cells with 1-phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol, an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthesis, likewise sensitized MCF-7-AdrR cells to Adriamycin. It is concluded that high cellular levels of glucosylceramide are correlated with MDR, and that glycolipids are a target for the action of MDR-reversing agents such as tamoxifen. The data entertain the notion that drug resistance phenomena are aligned with cell capacity to metabolize ceramide.

Proteins encoded by the mfd gene in E. coli and by the ERCC6/CSB gene in humans, both of which possess the so-called helicase motifs, are required for the coupling reaction. It has been shown that the Mfd protein is an ATPase but not a helicase and accomplishes coupling, in part, by disrupting the ternary complex of E. coli RNA polymerase stalled at the site of DNA damage. In this study we overproduced the human CSB protein using the baculovirus vector and purified and characterized the recombinant protein. CSB has an ATPase activity that is stimulated strongly by DNA; however, it neither acts as a helicase nor does it dissociate stalled RNA polymerase II, suggesting a coupling mechanism in humans different from that in prokaryotes. CSB is a DNA-binding protein, and it also binds to XPA, TFIIH, and the p34 subunit of TFIIE. These interactions are likely to play a role in recruiting repair proteins to ternary complexes formed at damage sites. Transcription is coupled to repair in Escherichia coli and in humans.

The preferential repair, to a large extent, is due to the high rate of repair of the template (transcribed) strand relative to the coding (nontranscribed) strand and transcriptionally inactive DNA (2Mellon I.

However, attempts at understanding transcription-coupled repair in humans have been frustrated by the lack of an efficient system for transcription by RNA polymerase II in vitro and by the lack of purified CSA and CSB proteins, which are known to be essential for coupling 2C.

CSA is a protein of 44 kDa and belongs in the “WD-repeat” family of proteins (11Henning K.A. Li L. Iyer N. McDaniel L.D. Reagan M.S. Legerski R. Shultz R.A. Stefanini M. Lehmann A.R. Mayne L.V.

Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). The CSB protein has a predicted size of 168 kDa, contains helicase motifs, and belongs in the SWI/SNF family of proteins (12Troelstra C. van Gool A. de Wit J. Vermeulen W. Bootsma D.

Because of size, sequence, and apparent functional similarities between CSB and Mfd, it has been generally assumed that CSB may play a role similar to that of Mfd (4Selby C.P. Sancar A. Microbiol.

Hence the purification and characterization of CSB were considered essential for understanding the phenomenon of transcription-coupled repair. In this paper we describe the purification and characterization of recombinant human CSB protein. ATPase activity was detected with CSB protein, and this activity was characterized with regard to allosteric effectors. Although our CSB was active as indicated by its DNA binding and ATPase activities, it did not remove a stalled RNA Pol II. While this work was in progress Guzder et al. (18Guzder S.N. Habraken Y.

The ERCC6 gene cloned into the vector Bluescript and designated pcBLsSE6 (12Troelstra C. van Gool A. de Wit J. Vermeulen W. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 939-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. J. H. J. Hoeijmakers (Erasmus University). A HpaI site was placed immediately upstream of the ATG initiation codon (5¹-AGAATG to 5¹-AGAGTTAACATG) by site-directed mutagenesis (24Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) to facilitate subcloning; this construct was designated pE6Hpa. To generate a template for in vitro transcription-translation, the CSB gene was subcloned as a HpaI-XbaI fragment from pE6Hpa into the SmaI-XbaI site of pIBI24 (VWR Scientific, Inc.), which places the gene downstream from the T7 promoter; this construct was designated pIE6. A construct intended to produce a full-length CSB-MBP fusion protein was made by inserting the HpaI-XbaI fragment from pE6Hpa into the XmnI-XbaI site of pMal-c2 (New England Biolabs) and was designated pMALE6. A construct for producing a fusion of GST protein with amino acids 528-1222 of CSB was made by subcloning the internal EcoRI fragment of the CSB gene into the EcoRI site of pGEX3x (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and was designated pGSTE65. The same fragment of CSB was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pMal-c2 to obtain pMALE65. The CSA gene was subcloned from a human cDNA library by PCR using primers 5¹-AGAATTCCCGGGATGCTGGGGTTTTTGTCCGCACGCCAAACGGGTTT and 5¹-GTGAGATCTAGATATTCATCCTTCTTCATCACTGCTGCTCCAGGCATC. These primers were made based upon the published sequence of the CSA gene (11Henning K.A. Li L. Iyer N. McDaniel L.D. Reagan M.S. Legerski R. Shultz R.A. Stefanini M. Lehmann A.R. Mayne L.V. Friedberg E.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 555-564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and place EcoRI and SmaI sites at the 5¹ border and BglII and XbaI sites at the 3¹ border of CSA. The PCR product was subcloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen) to give pCRCSA2. The SmaI-SpeI fragment of pCRCSA2 containing the entire CSA gene was subcloned into the XmnI-XbaI site of pMal-c2 to give pMALCSA. The p2Bac vector (Invitrogen) was used to generate constructs for expression of full-length CS proteins in Sf21 cells. The SmaI-HindIII fragment of pCRCSA2 was inserted into the PvuII-HindIII site of p2Bac to give pBacCSA, in which the CSA gene is downstream from the polyhedrin promoter. To construct a plasmid expressing both CSA and CSB genes, the HpaI-XbaI fragment of pE6Hpa was inserted into the SmaI-XbaI site of pBacCSA to obtain pBacCSAB, in which the CSB gene is downstream from the p10 promoter. The Baculo Gold transfection kit (Pharmingen) was used to harvest recombinant viral stocks expressing the CS genes. GST and MBP fusion proteins of CSA and CSB were made in E. coli DR153 (recA3 ΔuvrB) and purified with glutathione-Sepharose or amylose-agarose affinity resins (7Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4882-4889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The CSA-MBP protein was further purified using columns of DEAE-Sepharose, Affi-Gel blue, and SP-Sepharose. To make anti-CSB antibodies, the GST-CSB(528-1222) protein was first purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography and then by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The band containing the fusion protein was excised from the gel, and the gel slice was ground into small pieces and injected into a rabbit. To make an antibody affinity column, MBP-CSB(528-1222) was covalently linked to SulfoLink coupling gel using the Pierce antibody immobilization kit. The immune serum was passed through the column, and the anti-CSB antibodies were eluted from the column with low pH into tubes containing 1 M Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, and then dialyzed against and stored in Manley buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 12 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 17% glycerol) with 100 mM KCl. During the purification of the MBP-CSA protein, approximately the first half of the fusion protein eluted from the amylose resin as precipitate. This insoluble material was injected into a rabbit. An affinity resin for purifying anti-CSA antibodies from the immune serum was made by linking MBP-CSA to Affi-Gel-10 (Bio-Rad) as described by the manufacturer. Full-length CSB protein was purified from Sf21 cells using both Coomassie Blue staining and immunoblotting to locate the fractions containing the protein. CSA was detected by immunoblotting with anti-CSA antibodies. Approximately 2 liters of Sf21 cells at approximately 106 cells/ml were infected with our recombinant baculovirus, which expresses CSA and CSB, and incubated at 26°C for 42-48 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation, and CFE was prepared by the procedure of Manley et al. (25Manley J.L. Fire A. Cano A. Sharp P.A. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3855-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Most of the CSB and only a small fraction of CSA were soluble. The CFE was passed through a DE52 column equilibrated with Manley buffer plus 100 mM KCl. The flow-through that contained both proteins was applied to a SP-Sepharose column equilibrated with Manley buffer plus 100 mM KCl. CSA was in the flow-through of this column, but CSB was bound quantitatively. The column was washed with 0.2 M KCl, and then a linear gradient of 0.2-1.0 M KCl in Manley buffer was applied. CSB eluted at about 0.4 M KCl. Fractions containing CSB were pooled and diluted to a final concentration of 0.1 M KCl in Manley buffer plus 0.01% Nonidet P-40. The sample was applied to a single-stranded DNA cellulose column equilibrated in the same buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1-1.0 M KCl in Manley buffer plus 0.01% Nonidet P-40. CSB protein eluted at about 0.25 M KCl. Fractions containing CSB were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer C (20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1 mM EDTA, 19% glycerol, and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) plus 0.3 M KCl. Then, ammonium sulfate was added to 1.2 M, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was applied to a phenyl Superose 5/5 fast protein liquid chromatography column. The column was washed with loading buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 1.2 to 0.0 M ammonium sulfate in Buffer C. The CSB eluted at about 0.1 M ammonium sulfate. The combined fractions were dialyzed against Buffer C with 0.1 M KCl plus 0.01% Nonidet P-40 and then applied to a Mono Q 5/5 fast protein liquid chromatography column. The column was washed, and then a gradient of 0.1-1.0 M KCl in Buffer C plus 0.01% Nonidet P-40 was applied. CSB eluted at about 0.35 M KCl. Fractions were pooled, diluted to 0.12 M KCl in Buffer C plus 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and applied to a Mono S 5/5 column. A linear gradient of 0.1-0.8 M KCl in Buffer C plus 0.01% Nonidet P-40 was applied, and CSB eluted at about 0.45 M KCl. The pooled fractions were diluted to 0.1 M KCl in Buffer C plus 0.01% Nonidet P-40 and applied to a 0.4-ml column of Q-Sepharose. The protein bound quantitatively and was eluted with 0.55 M KCl in Buffer C plus 0.01% Nonidet P-40. Extract preparation and all chromatographic steps except the last were performed in the presence of 1 μg/ml aprotinin and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A (Boehringer Mannheim). RNA polymerase II was purified using DE52, Mono Q, hydroxyapatite, and S300 columns. yTBP and recombinant TFIIB were gifts from Dr. D. Reinberg (Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, NJ). TFIIE, in which the p56 subunit was fused to MBP, was purified by amylose affinity chromatography. Recombinant TFIIF subunits were purified from E. coli and renatured as described (22Wang B.Q. Kostrub C.F. Finkelstein A. Burton Z.F. Protein Expr. Purif. 1993; 4: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Wang B.Q. Lei L. Burton Z.F. Protein Expr. Purif. 1994; 5: 476-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). TFIIH was purified from HeLa CFE using DE52, Affi-Gel blue, SP-Sepharose, S300, and Mono S columns. The E. coli Mfd protein was purified as described previously (6Selby C.P. Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar); E. coli DNA helicase II was the gift of Dr. S. Matson (University of North Carolina). In vitro transcription-translation was performed with the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system from Promega. ATPase, helicase, and DNA-binding assays were conducted in reaction buffer that contained 40 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mM KCl, 8 mM MgCl2, 2.4 mM dithiothreitol, 1.1 mM EDTA, and 6.8% glycerol. ATPase assays were performed as described (26Myles G.M. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3824-3834Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) except that the reaction conditions were not restricted to hydrolysis of 15% of the substrate. For antibody inhibition experiments, antibodies and the ATPases were mixed in the reaction buffer and incubated on ice for 1 h before mixing with ATP substrate. For gel shift analysis, DNA and protein were incubated in 10 μl of reaction buffer at 30°C for 30 min and then separated on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel run at room temperature at 60 V in 45 mM Tris borate and 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 8.3. Helicase assay was conducted as described by Matson et al. (27Matson S.W. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14017-14024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the protein pull-down assay was as described previously (7Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4882-4889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To examine ternary complex stability, we used template pMLU112, which contains a “U-less cassette” as the first 112 bp of the transcription unit (28Zawel L. Kumar K.P. Reinberg D. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The plasmid was transcribed with a reconstituted human RNA Pol II transcription system in the absence of UTP, producing a stable, stalled RNA Pol II at the end of the cassette. The RNA was labeled using α-32P-CTP. PvuII restriction endonuclease was then added, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at 32°C to cleave the DNA downstream from the stalled polymerase. Then, CS proteins were added to the stalled polymerase complex in 31 mM HEPES, 6 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.9, 120 mM KCl, 3.8 mM MgCl2, 2.1 mM EDTA, 3% polyethylene glycol, 6.8% glycerol, and 208 μM each of ATP and GTP, and 2 μM CTP. After 45 min at 32°C the transcript was chased by adding 400 μM UTP and 800 μM of cold CTP and incubating for 12 min. RNA products were resolved on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. To assist in characterizing the CSB protein we prepared antibodies against the putative catalytic region of the protein. This was done by using as antigen a peptide containing the helicase motifs region of CSB, amino acids 528-1222, fused to GST. Immune serum was purified using an affinity column ligand consisting of MBP fused to amino acids 528-1222 of CSB. Our antibody was capable of detecting native CSB among the proteins in CFE by Western analysis, although there was considerable cross-reactivity (see below). The band identified as CSB was absent when CS-B CFE was examined and when normal human CFE was examined using preimmune serum. CSB made by in vitro transcription-translation and by expression in Sf21 cells was also detected with our antibody. Most importantly, the CSB protein expressed in Sf21 cells co-migrated with native protein. In contrast, our anti-CSA antibody was of poor quality in that Western analysis of CFE did not permit identification of CSA protein among overwhelming cross-reactivity. However, the anti-CSA antibodies did allow detection of CSA overproduction in bacteria and Sf21 cells by immunoblotting (data not shown). Several approaches were taken to generate purified CSB protein for our investigations. The full-length protein was not appreciably expressed in E. coli even when fused to GST or MBP. Therefore we attempted to purify CSB from HeLa CFE. However, after three or four chromatographic steps, the protein consistently underwent extensive degradation. Next, we attempted to overproduce the protein using the baculovirus/Sf21 insect cell system. CSB protein was greatly overproduced 24-48 h after infection of Sf21 cells with our recombinant baculovirus. We were able to obtain about 30 μg of CSB of high purity from 2 x 109 cells after a seven-column purification procedure. As seen in Fig. 1 the final step contained a single band that was reactive with anti-CSB antibodies. Even though the expression vector contained both CSA and CSB genes, the majority of CSA protein was insoluble, and the soluble fraction separated from the CSB protein completely in the second chromatographic step, suggesting that CSA and CSB do not make a stable complex (data not shown). van Gool (10van Gool A.J. The Cockayane Syndrome B Protein: Involvement in Transcription-coupled DNA repair..Ph.D. thesis, Erasmus University. 1996; Google Scholar) also found that CSA and CSB proteins readily separate upon fractionation of cell extract, although it has been reported that CSA and CSB can interact as revealed by immunoprecipitation assays (11Henning K.A. Li L. Iyer N. McDaniel L.D. Reagan M.S. Legerski R. Shultz R.A. Stefanini M. Lehmann A.R. Mayne L.V. Friedberg E.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 555-564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The prototype transcription-repair coupling factor (TRCF) encoded by the E. coli mfd gene possesses the so-called helicase motifs and is a DNA-independent ATPase and a DNA-binding protein with no detectable helicase activity (6Selby C.P. Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 8Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4890-4895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Because the putative human coupling factor also possesses the helicase motifs, we decided to test the purified CSB for ATPase, DNA-binding, and helicase activities. CSB exhibited ATPase activity with a kcat∼3 min-1, which increased to 45-53 min-1 in the presence of single- or double-stranded DNA (Table I). The ATPase activity is intrinsic to CSB and is not due to a contaminating ATPase as evidenced by the fact that anti-CSB antibodies specifically inhibited the ATPase activity of CSB without affecting ATP hydrolysis by Mfd or UvrD (helicase II), both of which also have helicase motifs (Fig. 2). CSA-MBP did not exhibit ATPase activity and did not affect the ATPase activity of CSB.Table I.DNA-stimulated ATPase activity of CSBads, double-stranded; ss, single-stranded.Additionkcat (min-1)None3.4ds DNA45ss DNA53a ds, double-stranded; ss, single-stranded. Open table in a new tab DNA binding was examined by gel shift assay using a 90-bp DNA fragment. The results in Fig. 3 show that unlike Mfd protein, CSB readily bound to DNA in the absence of nucleotide. At low concentrations of CSB, a single retarded band was detected, indicated as B1 in Fig. 3. At higher CSB concentrations, there were apparently multiple CSB proteins bound per duplex as indicated by the appearance of discreet lower mobility bands, labeled B2- B4. The presence of ATPγS increased the amount of DNA bound by CSB. ATP and, to a lesser extent, ATPγS decreased the number of CSB proteins/duplex. An alternative explanation for B2-B4 is the formation of intermolecular aggregates of B1. Helicase activity was tested using as substrate a labeled 24-mer annealed to a circular, single-stranded DNA molecule. Even though CSB binds to DNA and exhibits DNA-stimulated ATPase activity, Fig. 4 shows that CSB cannot displace the 24-mer, whereas helicase II releases it quantitatively. CSA-MBP did not exhibit helicase activity and did not confer helicase activity to CSB. Thus we conclude that CSB, like its E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae counterparts Mfd (6Selby C.P. Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) and Rad 26 (18Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18314-18317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), respectively, is a protein with helicase motifs but no helicase activity. The Mfd protein brings about transcription-coupled repair by interacting with RNA Pol stalled at a lesion and then removing the polymerase and directing the damage recognition subunit of the bacterial excision nuclease to the lesion (6Selby C.P. Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar–8Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4890-4895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Similarly, it has been found that CSB interacts with CSA and with the XPG protein (29Iyer N. Reagan M.S. Wu K.J. Canagarajah B. Friedberg E.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2157-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and that CSA interacts with the p44 subunit of TFIIH (11Henning K.A. Li L. Iyer N. McDaniel L.D. Reagan M.S. Legerski R. Shultz R.A. Stefanini M. Lehmann A.R. Mayne L.V. Friedberg E.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 555-564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), suggesting that a related mechanism may be operative in humans. We wished to know if CSB exhibited binding and functional properties similar to those of Mfd, in particular binding to the damage recognition protein and disruption of the stalled RNA Pol complex. First, we have found that CSB interacts with TFIIH as shown in Fig. 5A. Furthermore, because the fusion protein used in this assay comprised only amino acids 528-1222 of CSB, our result narrows down the interaction site to this domain. TFIIH is both a transcription and an excision repair factor; in transcription, it facilitates initiation of RNA synthesis in conjunction with TFIIE (30Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 161-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 31Zawel L. Reinberg D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 533-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). However, in transcription-independent excision repair TFIIH functions independently of TFIIE, and no effect of TFIIE on this mode of repair could be detected (32Park C.-H. Mu D. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4896-4902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, because CSB is presumed to act at the transcription/repair interface, we considered the possibility that it may interact with TFIIE. Interestingly, we found that CSB binds to TFIIE, and the binding is mediated by the p34 subunit (Fig. 5, B and C). Finally, because a working model for coupling presupposes the recruitment of damage recognition proteins by CSB, we tested for binding to XPA. Fig. 5D shows that XPA specifically binds to CSB, consistent with CSB being a bridge between transcription and repair proteins. A striking feature of transcription-repair coupling in E. coli is the removal of stalled RNA Pol by the Mfd protein (6Selby C.P. Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Mfd removes RNA Pol stalled at a lesion, stalled by nucleotide starvation, or blocked by a DNA-bound protein (8Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4890-4895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We tested CSB for an analogous activity. RNA Pol II was stalled 112 nucleotides into a U-less cassette by omission of UTP, and then the ternary complex was incubated with CS proteins. With this experimental setup, the subsequent addition of UTP leads to elongation of RNA to the end of the template (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2) in the absence of other factors. We found that incubation with CSB and CSA by themselves or in combination does not interfere with the subsequent formation of runoff transcripts (Fig. 6, lanes 3, 5, and 7 versus lanes 4, 6, and 8). Thus, CSB clearly does not release stalled RNA Pol II. Transcription-repair coupling occurs in many organisms, including prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Initial biochemical investigations of this phenomenon revealed that in E. coli, a TRCF encoded by the mfd gene was required and sufficient to couple the transcription and repair processes. It did so by removing the stalled RNA Pol and delivering the repair proteins to the lesion at an accelerated rate compared to lesions in which polymerase was not stalled (6Selby C.P. Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). A protein from Bacillus subtilis was found to have similar structure and function, notably, a region containing the seven so-called helicase motifs, and the ability to remove a stalled RNA Pol (33Ayora S. Rojo F. Ogasawara N. Nakai S. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 301-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Based on genetic data and in vivo studies, humans require two proteins for transcription-repair coupling, the CSA and CSB proteins (5Venema J. Mullenders L.H.F. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A. Mayne L.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4707-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). CSA is a member of the “WD-repeat” family of proteins, which so far have been found to have structural and regulatory roles but no enzymatic activity (11Henning K.A. Li L. Iyer N. McDaniel L.D.

Open table in a new tab Aside from having identical cellular functions, the TRCFs in Table II are similar in being relatively large and possessing the helicase motifs. Although all four proteins can bind to DNA and hydrolyze ATP, none exhibit detectable helicase activity. This property may not be unique to this class of enzymes because two other proteins with helicase motifs, SNF2 (35Laurent B.C. Treich I. Carlson M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and Rad5 (36Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28259-28262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have also been reported to lack helicase activity. In those cases in which protein-protein interactions have been investigated, TRCFs have been found to associate with various transcription and nucleotide excision repair proteins (Table II). Although these interactions are valuable toward devising models and working hypotheses, with the human proteins they have been largely identified by assays designed to detect weak protein-protein interactions. The prokaryotic interactions listed are more likely to reflect functional interactions because they have been corroborated by independent approaches. However, in no case have transcription or repair proteins been found to form a tight complex with a TRCF. Previous studies have indicated that DNA binding and ATP hydrolysis by E. coli Mfd protein are involved in dissociation of stalled RNA Pol. It was inferred that the Mfd protein must bind nucleotide to bind to DNA and that hydrolysis of nucleotide is associated with dissociation of Mfd from DNA. It was proposed that, for dissociation of stalled RNA Pol, first Mfd-ATP binds to the ternary complex, both to the DNA and to RNA Pol. Then, hydrolysis of ATP brings about the release of Mfd from DNA together with the associated RNA Pol (7Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4882-4889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). CSB is strikingly different from Mfd in both DNA binding (ATPγS-independent) and ATP hydrolysis (strongly stimulated by DNA). Thus it is not surprising that CSB, in contrast to Mfd, does not function to remove its cognate stalled RNA Pol from DNA. A most interesting aspect of transcription-repair coupling is the reaction mechanisms and in particular the disposition of the RNA Pol stalled at the lesion. In E. coli, RNA Pol stalled at the lesion inhibits repair, and Mfd removes it. Mfd also binds to the repair enzyme, which is delivered to the transcription-blocking lesion at an accelerated rate (6Selby C.P. Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 37Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21330-21336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, RNA Pol stalled at a lesion does not inhibit repair,2 and CSB does not remove the stalled polymerase. CSB does, however, bind to repair proteins and may, like Mfd, function to deliver them to the transcription-blocking lesion at an accelerated rate. Such a mechanism, in which RNA Pol is not removed from the template during repair, could permit subsequent transcription by the polymerase without reinitiation at the promoter, as described by Hanawalt (16Hanawalt P.C. Science. 1994; 266: 1957-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2150630317,"In response to insulin, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTPase 1B) dephosphorylates 95- and 160-180-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated (PY) proteins (Kenner, K. A., Anyanwu, E., Olefsky, J. M., and Kusari, J. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 19810-19816). To characterize these proteins, lysates from control and insulin-treated cells expressing catalytically inactive PTPase 1B (CS) were immunoadsorbed and subsequently immunoblotted using various combinations of phosphotyrosine, PTPase 1B, and insulin receptor (IR) antibodies. Anti-PTPase 1B antibodies coprecipitated a 95-kDa PY protein from insulin-stimulated cells, subsequently identified as the IR β-subunit. Similarly, anti-IR antibodies coprecipitated the 50-kDa PY-PTPase 1B protein from insulin-treated cells. To identify PTPase 1B tyrosine (Tyr) residues that are phosphorylated in response to insulin, three candidate sites (Tyr66, Tyr152, and Tyr153) were replaced with phenylalanine. Replacing Tyr66 or Tyr152 and Tyr153 significantly reduced insulin-stimulated PTPase 1B phosphotyrosine content, as well as its association with the IR. Studies using mutant IRs demonstrated that IR autophosphorylation is necessary for the PTPase 1B-IR interaction. These results suggest that PTPase 1B complexes with the autophosphorylated insulin receptor in intact cells, either directly or within a complex involving additional proteins. The interaction requires multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites within both the receptor and PTPase 1B. In response to insulin, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTPase 1B) dephosphorylates 95- and 160-180-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated (PY) proteins (Kenner, K. A., Anyanwu, E., Olefsky, J. M., and Kusari, J. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 19810-19816).

These results suggest that PTPase 1B complexes with the autophosphorylated insulin receptor in intact cells, either directly or within a complex involving additional proteins. The interaction requires multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites within both the receptor and PTPase 1B. Insulin is a potent metabolic and growth-promoting hormone that has pleiotropic effects at the level of the cell and within the intact organism. Insulin acts on cells to stimulate glucose, protein, and lipid metabolism, as well as RNA and DNA synthesis, by modifying the activity of a variety of enzymes and transport processes (1Kahn C.R. White M.F. Shoelson S.E. Backer J.M. Araki E. Cheatham B. Csermely P. Folli F. Goldstein B.J. Huertas P. Rothenberg P.L. Saad M.J.A. Siddle K. Sun X.-J. Wilden P.A. Yamada K. Kahn S.A. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1993; 48: 291-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a first step in initiating these responses, insulin binds to its plasma membrane receptor. The insulin receptor is a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two α and two β subunits linked by disulfide bonds to form a β-α-α-β structure. After insulin binding, the insulin receptor undergoes autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues. Autophosphorylation increases the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor, which in turn phosphorylates one or more cellular substrates, leading to a cascade of secondary phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions (2White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the molecular mechanism of insulin action is defined with increasing clarity, so too is our appreciation of the central role played by protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Regulated tyrosine phosphorylation represents a balance of protein-tyrosine kinase (PTKase) 1The abbreviations used are: PTKaseprotein-tyrosine kinasePTPaseprotein-tyrosine phosphataseIRinsulin receptorIRSIR substrateIGFinsulin-like growth factorFCSfetal calf serumTEMEDN,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediaminePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGrb2growth factor receptor binding protein 2. and protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activities. To date, most attempts to assess the role of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in insulin signal transduction have focused on the action of kinases and thus furnish an incomplete picture of this dynamic process.

Extensive progress in the identification and characterization of PTPases has been made in recent years (3Dixon J.E. Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), partially as a result of our appreciation of the PTKases (4Fantl W.J. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 453-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). PTPase 1B was the first PTPase to be isolated in homogeneous form and sequenced (5Tonks N.K. Diltz C.D. Fischer E.H. J. Biol.

PTPase 1B possesses a catalytic domain characterized by the 11-amino acid sequence motif, (I/V)HCXAGXXR(S/T)G. This motif contains cysteine (Cys215) and arginine (Arg221) residues critical for the catalytic activity of the enzyme (7Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Thai T. Tang M. Saito H.

The conserved phosphatase domain of PTPase 1B is contained within the domain spanning residues 30 to 278. The COOH-terminal noncatalytic extension of the protein serves a regulatory function. The COOH-terminal 35 residues target the enzyme to the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (12Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), whereas the preceding 122 residues are predominantly hydrophilic and contain sites for serine phosphorylation. This segment of PTPase 1B is phosphorylated in vivo, and the pattern of phosphorylation is altered in a cell cycle-dependent manner (13Flint A.J. Gebbink M.F.G.B. Franza B.R.J. Hill D.E. Tonks N.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1937-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of the 321-residue (37-kDa) form of human PTPase 1B has been determined, revealing the structural features that provide the protein with its specific enzymatic capacity for phosphotyrosine (14Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 15Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The involvement of PTPase 1B in insulin signaling has been suggested in numerous reports. In initial studies, microinjection of purified placental PTPase 1B into Xenopus oocytes was shown to block insulin-induced S6 peptide phosphorylation and inhibit insulin-induced oocyte maturation (16Cicirelli M.F. Tonks N.K. Diltz C.D. Weiel J.E. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5514-5518Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 17Tonks N.K. Cicirelli M.F. Diltz C.D. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have demonstrated that PTPase 1B is expressed at relatively high levels in insulin-sensitive tissues (18Goldstein B.J. Receptor. 1993; 3: 1-15PubMed Google Scholar). In clinical studies, we have shown that skeletal muscle biopsies from patients with impaired insulin action contain decreased PTPase 1B protein in comparison with subjects with normal insulin action (19Kusari J. Kenner K.A. Suh K.-I. Hill D.E. Henry R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1156-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated in the rat L6 myotube cell culture system that insulin increases total cellular PTPase activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Increased activity is due mainly, if not entirely, to increased PTPase 1B activity, following increased PTPase 1B mRNA and protein expression (20Kenner K.A. Hill D.E. Olefsky J.M. Kusari J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25455-25462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that the overexpression of catalytically active PTPase 1B inhibits insulin-stimulated insulin receptor autophosphorylation, the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins, and glucose incorporation into glycogen (21Kenner K.A. Anyanwu E. Olefsky J.M. Kusari J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19810-19816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). These data suggest that PTPase 1B acts as a negative regulator of insulin signaling. A similar conclusion has also been independently reached by several other laboratories (22Maegawa H. Ide R.

In this study, we show an in vivo interaction between the insulin receptor and PTPase 1B, using a mutant derivative of PTPase 1B in which the critical active site cysteine residue (Cys215) has been mutated to serine (CS). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the interaction of the insulin receptor with PTPase 1B is absolutely dependent upon insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation. Receptor tyrosines Tyr1146, Tyr1150, and Tyr1151 are essential for the interaction. PTPase 1B residues Tyr66, Tyr152, and Tyr153 are important for the insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PTPase 1B and its association with the receptor complex. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of PTPase 1B action within insulin receptor signaling. Insulin and insulin like growth factor-I (IGF-I) were kindly provided by Lilly.

Gene (Amst.). 1995; 152: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The cell lines Hirc-M and CIGFR-M used in this study have been described previously (21Kenner K.A. Anyanwu E. Olefsky J.M. Kusari J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19810-19816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Briefly, Hirc-M is a rat 1 fibroblast cell line overexpressing human insulin receptors and CS PTPase 1B. CIGFR-M is a Chinese hamster ovary cell line overexpressing human IGF-I receptors and CS PTPase 1B. Hirc-M cells were propagated in Dulbecco's minimal media (DME F12) containing 10% FCS, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 400 μg/ml hygromycin, and 500 nM methotrexate. CIGFR-M were propagated in Ham's F-12, containing 10% FCS, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 400 μg/ml hygromycin, and 400 μg/ml geneticin. COS 7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-low glucose medium containing 10% FCS and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. After the cells reached 80% confluence, COS cells were transfected with 20 μg of each expression plasmid by the Ca3(PO4)2-mediated transfection procedure (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.Vol. 1. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1995: 9.1.1-9.1.9Google Scholar). On the day after transfection, the cells were exposed to 10% glycerol for 3 min and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were incubated in fresh medium for another 28 h and then serum starved for 20 h and used. Cells were serum starved for 16-24 h in appropriate medium with 0.1% FCS before experimental treatment. Treated cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysates were spun at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatants were removed and assayed for total protein content using the Bradford method (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). After normalization of protein, supernatants were incubated on an end-over-end mixer at 4°C with antibody (1 μg of anti-PTPase 1B antibody or 1:100 anti-insulin receptor antibody) and a 1:4 volume of the 50% anti-mouse IgG agarose slurry for 2 h. The agarose was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 2 min at 4°C. Pellets were washed five times with ice-cold lysis buffer, dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, processed by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were probed with the indicated antibodies, and bound antibody was visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.). To reprobe the blots, the filters were incubated for 30 min at 50°C in stripping buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS) and then washed two times (10 min each) at room temperature in TBST (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). The filters were reprobed with the desired antibodies, and bound antibody was detected as described above. We have previously shown that the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of at least two proteins (95 and 160-180 kDa) is reversed by overexpression of the catalytically active PTPase 1B (21Kenner K.A. Anyanwu E. Olefsky J.M. Kusari J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19810-19816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). To further characterize these proteins, we used Hirc-M cells overexpressing human insulin receptors and CS PTPase 1B. The C215S mutation rendered PTPase 1B enzymatically inactive but still allowed substrate binding. The association of CS PTPase 1B with its substrate is very stable in comparison with active PTPase 1B (30Guan K. Dixon J.E. Science. 1990; 249: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). To identify proteins that interact with PTPase 1B under insulin-stimulated conditions, the lysates from control and insulin-treated (5 min) Hirc-M cells were adsorbed with antibodies to PTPase 1B. The immunoprecipitates were fractionated by 5-12% gradient SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by sequential immunoblotting with phosphotyrosine, insulin receptor, and PTPase 1B antibodies. In a parallel experiment, insulin receptors were immunoprecipitated from control and insulin-treated cells, using an insulin receptor antibody. These immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by sequential immunoblotting in the same manner. Fig. 1A shows the cellular complement of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that were immunoprecipitated by the PTPase 1B antibody. Under basal conditions, a single 120-kDa phosphotyrosine-containing protein was immunoprecipitated by anti-PTPase 1B. Anti-PTPase 1B immunoprecipitated three additional phosphoproteins of approximately 180, 95, and 50 kDa from insulin-stimulated cells (Fig. 1A, right lane). Reprobing the blot with anti-insulin receptor antibody demonstrated that the 95-kDa immunoprecipitated protein consisted at least in part of insulin receptor β-subunits (Fig. 1B). In comparison, only a residual amount of insulin receptor β-subunit protein was detected in anti-PTPase 1B immunoprecipitates from untreated cells (Fig. 1B, left lane). This diminution was not due to decreased recovery of PTPase 1B, because anti-PTPase 1B immunoprecipitates from control and insulin-stimulated cells had similar quantities of PTPase 1B protein (Fig. 1C). Anti-insulin receptor antibody immunoprecipitated a similar set of tyrosine phosphoproteins of approximately 180, 95, and 50 kDa and an additional protein of 80 kDa from insulin-treated cells (Fig. 2A, right lane). Reprobing the blot with a PTPase 1B antibody indicated that the 50-kDa protein that coprecipitated with the insulin receptor was PTPase 1B (Fig. 2C). Again, the amount of PTPase 1B that coprecipitated with insulin receptors from insulin-treated cells was higher than from untreated cells (Fig. 2C, right lane versus left lane). This could be due to uneven precipitation of the insulin receptor from control and ligand-stimulated cells or to enhanced interaction between PTPase 1B and the insulin receptor in the presence of insulin. To address the first possibility, the same blot was reprobed with anti-insulin receptor antibody. Fig. 2B demonstrates that the anti-insulin receptor antibody immunoprecipitated similar quantities of insulin receptor from cells incubated in either the absence or presence of insulin. These results suggest that PTPase 1B forms complexes with the insulin receptor in intact cells in an insulin-dependent manner. Because additional proteins are also present in the immunoprecipitates, complex formation might involve other proteins as well. The 180-kDa protein(s) that coprecipitated with both the insulin receptor and PTPase 1B (Figs. 1A and 2A) could be IRS-1, IRS-2, or a combination of both. Further studies are currently under way to characterize this protein. The insulin-stimulated interaction between PTPase 1B and insulin receptors was accompanied by increased tyrosine phosphorylation of CS PTPase 1B (Fig. 2A). Similar results, but of lesser magnitude, were obtained with endogenous PTPase 1B in untransfected cells (data not shown). The presence of small quantities of PTPase 1B in anti-insulin receptor immunoprecipitates from unstimulated cells (Fig. 2C, left lane) and the similar presence of insulin receptors in basal anti-PTPase 1B immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1B, left lane) could be due to modest tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor under basal conditions (Fig. 2A, left lane). It is possible that PTPase 1B may also interact with other receptors with intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity. To address this issue, we examined the interaction of PTPase 1B with the IGF-I receptor. The IGF-I receptor is structurally very similar to the insulin receptor and belongs to the same subfamily of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (31Geer P.V. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). CIGFR-M cells, overexpressing the IGF-I receptor and CS PTPase 1B, were serum starved overnight and then incubated in the absence and presence of 100 nM IGF-I for 5 min. The lysates were then immunoadsorbed to PTPase 1B antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were fractionated by 5-12% gradient SDS-PAGE and analyzed by sequential immunoblotting with antibodies to phosphotyrosine, IGF-I receptor, and PTPase 1B. As shown in Fig. 3A, the PTPase 1B antibody precipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of approximately 160 and 105 kDa from IGF-I-treated cells (right lane). Reprobing the blot with an IGF-I receptor antibody demonstrated that the 105-kDa protein was IGF-I receptor (Fig. 3B). The PTPase 1B antibody coprecipitated IGF-I receptors only from IGF-I-treated cells, possibly due to the necessity for IGF-I receptors to be tyrosine-phosphorylated to interact with PTPase 1B. The alternative possibility that insufficient PTPase 1B was immunoprecipitated under basal conditions was disproved by immunoblot analysis of the same blot with the anti-PTPase 1B antibody; similar amounts of PTPase 1B had been immunoprecipitated from basal and IGF-I-stimulated cells (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that in response to IGF-I in vivo, PTPase 1B forms complexes with the autophosphorylated IGF-I receptor. In contrast to our results from insulin-treated cells, we were unable to detect IGF-I-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PTPase 1B. This could result from a lower abundance of tyrosine-phosphorylated PTPase 1B in CIGFR-M cells. It is equally possible that IGF-I fails to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of PTPase 1B. In light of the different biological effects of insulin and IGF-I stimulation, alterations in the tyrosine phosphorylation of receptor-associated PTPase 1B could alter its enzymatic activity or range of substrates, thereby initiating separate signaling pathways for each ligand. We have shown above that PTPase 1B is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin (Figs. 1A and 2A). PTPase 1B may be phosphorylated directly by the activated insulin receptor or by another insulin-inducible protein-tyrosine kinase. It has been shown previously that most protein-tyrosine kinases phosphorylate substrates at tyrosine residues that are preceded by acidic amino acids (32Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). The PTPase 1B coding sequence was examined for such potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Only three tyrosine residues fit this consensus; Tyr66 (QEDNDY), Tyr152, and Tyr153 (EDIKSYY). To determine if any of these residues become tyrosine-phosphorylated in the presence of insulin, either Tyr66 or Tyr152 and Tyr153 were replaced with phenylalanine residues. Expression vectors bearing PTPase 1B C215S (CS), C215S, Y66F (YF), or C215S, Y152,153F (YYFF) mutations were coexpressed with the wild-type insulin receptors in COS cells. Twenty-eight h after transfection, COS cells were serum-starved and then incubated in the absence and presence of insulin for 5 min. A fraction of whole-cell lysates from control and insulin-stimulated cells was immunoprecipitated with anti-PTPase 1B antibodies. The immunoprecipitates and remaining cell lysates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-PTPase 1B antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4A, expression levels of the various mutant PTPase 1B proteins in COS cells were comparable. Insulin increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of PTPase 1B in cells expressing CS protein (Fig. 4B, lane 2). This is consistent with our above-stated observations (Fig. 1A). However, in cells expressing either YF or YYFF protein, no phosphorylation of PTPase 1B was observed in response to insulin (Fig. 4B, lanes 4 and 6). To ensure that this result was not due to an inability of the PTPase 1B antibody to precipitate the mutant proteins, PTPase 1B protein levels were measured by Western blot analysis in anti-PTPase 1B immunoprecipitates from cells expressing the various mutant PTPase 1B proteins. As shown in Fig. 4C, the amount of PTPase 1B present in anti-PTPase 1B immunoprecipitates from cells expressing YF or YYFF protein was even higher than from cells expressing CS protein. These results suggest that PTPase 1B residues Tyr66, Tyr152, and/or Tyr153 are necessary for insulin-induced phosphorylation of the protein. We next asked whether replacement of PTPase 1B residue(s) Tyr66 or Tyr152 and Tyr153 with phenylalanine affects its in vivo interaction with the insulin receptor. To address this issue, expression vectors bearing the CS, YF, or YYFF mutations were cotransfected with the wild-type insulin receptors into COS cells. Twenty-eight h after transfection, COS cells were serum-starved and then incubated in the absence and presence of insulin. A fraction of whole-cell lysate from control and insulin-stimulated cells was immunoprecipitated with the anti-PTPase 1B antibody. The remainder of each cell lysate and the immunoprecipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-insulin receptor antibody. As shown in Fig. 5A, expression levels of the insulin receptors in COS cells expressing the different mutant PTPase 1B proteins were comparable. Anti-PTPase 1B antibody coprecipitated a considerable amount of the insulin receptor from insulin-stimulated CS-expressing cells (Fig. 5B, lane 2). Significantly less insulin receptor was immunoprecipitated from cells expressing either the YF or YYFF protein (Fig. 5B, lanes 4 and 6). These results indicated that replacement of Tyr66, Tyr152, and/or Tyr153 with phenylalanine significantly inhibited the insulin-stimulated in vivo association of PTPase 1B with the insulin receptor complex. To identify insulin receptor phosphotyrosine residue(s) essential for complex formation with PTPase 1B, we used several mutant insulin receptors lacking various tyrosine residues. These included: (i) IR ΔCT (ΔCT), in which the receptor COOH-terminal 30 amino acids (containing Tyr1316 and Tyr1322, by the numeric assignment of Ullrich et al. (36Ullrich A. Bell J.R. Chen E.Y.

To investigate whether insulin receptor autophosphorylation is necessary for its interaction with PTPase 1B, we also used an insulin receptor with impaired ligand-stimulated autophosphorylation (AK, (33McClain D.A. Maegawa H. Lee J. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14663-14671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). AK receptors contain a K1018A mutation. K1018 is a critical residue in the ATP-binding site of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase domain (34Sternberg M.J.E. Taylor W.R.

SCCA is not specific for malignant tissues, however, as the protein(s) is detected in the suprabasal levels of normal stratified squamous epithelia of the skin and mucus membranes (3Takeshima N.

Biochemical analysis of SCCA by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) reveals a single band with a molecular mass of ∼45 kDa (5Kato H. Nagaya T. Torigoe T. Gann. 1984; 75: 433-435PubMed Google Scholar). Chromatofocusing, however, separates SCCA into neutral (pI ≥ 6.25) and acidic (pI ≤ 6.25) fractions (4Kato H. Suehiro Y. Morioka H. Torigoe T. Myoga A.

A cDNA for SCCA was cloned and sequenced by Suminami et al. (7Suminami Y. Kishi F. Sekiguchi K. Kato H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The putative translation product agreed with the limited peptide sequences that were available for SCCA (7Suminami Y. Kishi F. Sekiguchi K. Kato H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Comparisons of the primary amino acid sequence to those in the protein data bases revealed that SCCA belongs to the high molecular weight family of serine proteinaseinhibitors (serpins) (7Suminami Y. Kishi F. Sekiguchi K. Kato H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The serpin superfamily has evolved over 500 million years with representatives found in viruses, plants, protozoa, insects, and higher vertebrates (8Hunt L.T. Dayhoff M.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 864-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In mammals, inhibitory-type serpins regulate serine proteinases involved in, for example, coagulation, fibrinolysis, inflammation, cell migration, and extracellular matrix remodeling (reviewed in 9Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar–12Carrell R.W. Aulak K.S. Owen M.C. Mol. Biol. Med. 1989; 6: 35-42PubMed Google Scholar). However, some serpins have lost the ability to inhibit serine proteinases but have evolved specialized functions such as hormone transport and blood pressure regulation (9Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular cloning of the SCCA genomic region revealed the presence of two nearly identical (92%), tandemly arrayed SCCA genes (13Schneider S.S. Schick C. Fish K.E. Miller E. Pena J.C. Treter S.D. Hui S.M. Silverman G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3147-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). These genes, SCCA1 and SCCA2, likely correspond to the neutral and acidic forms, respectively, of SCCA. In addition, SCCA1 and SCCA2 are flanked by two other closely related serpin genes, plasminogen activator inhibitor type-2 (PAI2) and maspin within a 300-kilobase pair region of 18q21.3 (13Schneider S.S. Schick C. Fish K.E. Miller E. Pena J.C. Treter S.D. Hui S.M. Silverman G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3147-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The putative translation product of the more telomeric gene, SCCA1, agrees with that of the cDNA reported by Suminami et al. (7Suminami Y. Kishi F. Sekiguchi K. Kato H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), whereas the more centromeric gene, SCCA2, represents a novel sequence. Alignments between the amino acid sequences of SCCA1 and SCCA2 with those of other serpins suggest that both SCCAs are inhibitory-type serpins (13Schneider S.S. Schick C. Fish K.E. Miller E.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). The reactive site loop (RSL) of serpins interacts with the active site of the proteinase and thereby confers both functionality and specificity to the serpin molecule (reviewed in 10Travis J. Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar, 12Carrell R.W. Aulak K.S. Owen M.C. Mol. Biol.

Biol. 1992; 2: 438-446Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Examination of the RSL may provide insight into the types of proteinases inhibited by SCCA1 and SCCA2. Although SCCA1 and SCCA2 are nearly identical, significant differences between their RSLs suggest that SCCA1 and SCCA2 inhibit different types of proteinases (Fig. 1). Residues flanking the putative scissile bonds within the RSLs (between the P1 and P1¹ residues according to the numbering system of Schechter and Berger (18Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4765) Google Scholar)) of SCCA1 and SCCA2 are Ser-Ser and Leu-Ser, respectively (13Schneider S.S. Schick C. Fish K.E. Miller E. Pena J.C.

Bovine α1-anti-chymotrypsin (α1ACT) is the only other serpin known to contain a Ser-Ser at the reactive site (19Hwang S.-R. Kohn A.B. Hook V.Y.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As the target enzymes that interact with bovine α1ACT have not been identified, we cannot predict a priori the types of proteinases that can be inhibited by SCCA1. In contrast, both heparin-cofactor II (HCII) and human α1ACT contain Leu-Ser residues at their reactive sites (14Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Both serpins inhibit chymotrypsin (CT)-like serine proteinases, and HCII is a physiologic inhibitor of thrombin in the presence of heparans and dermatan sulfate (reviewed in 20Pratt C.W. Church F.C. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1993; 4: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, SCCA2 may share in the inhibitory profile defined by HCII or human α1ACT. The purpose of our current investigations is to determine experimentally whether SCCA1 and SCCA2 are inhibitory-type serpins. In a separate study, we have shown that SCCA1 is a novel cross-class inhibitor of the papain-like cysteine proteinases; cathepsins L, S, and K. 3C. Schick, Y. Kamachi, A. J. Bartuski, S. Çataltepe, P. A. Pemberton, H. Chapman, G. Shi, and G. A. Silverman, submitted for publication. In this report, we demonstrate that SCCA2 is an inhibitor of the chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases, cathepsin G (catG) and human mast cell chymase (HMC). A 1.2-kilobase pair DNA fragment containing the complete coding sequence of SCCA2 was generated by polymerase chain reaction from a plasmid containing the SCCA2 cDNA (13Schneider S.S. Schick C. Fish K.E. Miller E. Pena J.C. Treter S.D. Hui S.M. Silverman G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3147-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The forward (5¹-GCGCCCGGGGGATCCATGAATTCACTCAGTGAAGCC-3¹) and reverse (5¹-GCGCCCGGGATTCGGTACCAGTGACAGACTAATTGCATCTA-3¹) primers were designed to facilitate in-frame insertion into the pGEX-2T bacterial expression vector (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). The SCCA2 coding sequence was amplified as described previously (21Silverman G.A. Jockel J.I. Domer P.H. Mohr R.M. Taillon M.P. Korsmeyer S.J. Genomics. 1991; 9: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), digested with the restriction endonuclease BamHI (site underlined in forward primer) and ligated into the BamHI/SmaI site of the vector pGEX-2T. Recombinant clones were analyzed by DNA sequencing to verify that the coding sequence of SCCA2 was intact and in-frame with GST (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar). The GST-SCCA2 fusion protein was batch-purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia). A 200-ml culture of 2 x YT (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), containing 2% glucose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin, was incubated overnight in a 37°C shaker. Eight hundred milliliters of 2 x YT, 2% glucose, 100 μg/ml ampicillin was added to the overnight culture, and the suspension was incubated at 37°C until the A600 = 0.5-1.0. Expression was induced by the addition of 1 ml of 0.5 M isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (Boehringer Mannheim) and incubated at 37°C for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by incubating for 30 min on ice in 60 ml of prep buffer (100 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM EDTA, 2% Triton X-100) supplemented with 1.5 mg/ml lysozyme and 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 30 min. Two milliliters of 50% glutathione-Sepharose 4B, equilibrated in prep buffer, was mixed with 60 ml of lysate. The slurry was gently shaken for 30 min at 4°C. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 500 x g, and washed three times in 10 ml of PBS (0.01 M phosphate buffer, 27 mM KCl, 137 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Attempts to cleave SCCA2 from GST using thrombin resulted in inactivation of the inhibitor. Therefore, the entire fusion protein was eluted in three 1-ml washes of Glutathione Elution Buffer (10 mM reduced glutathione, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The eluate containing the fusion protein was aliquoted and frozen. Human neutrophil elastase (HNE), CT, plasmin, proteinase 3 (PR3), catL, catG, α1ACT, catB, and α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1PI) were purchased from Athens Research & Technology, Inc. (Athens, GA). Prostate specific antigen (PSA) was purchased from Scripps Laboratories (San Diego, CA). Cathepsins K and S were generously provided by Dr. Harold Chapman (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA). HMC was purified from human skin as described (24Schechter N.M. Sprows J.L. Schoenberger O.L. Lazarus G.S. Cooperman B.S. Rubin H. J. Biol.

Thrombin was purchased from Calbiochem. Granzyme B was kindly provided by Dr. Chris Froelich of Evanston Hospital of Evanston, IL. Enzyme substrates were purchased from Sigma (succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-para-nitroanilide (Succ-AAPF-pNA), methoxy-Succ-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA (MeO-Succ-AAPV-pNA), and Val-Leu-Lys-pNA (VLK-pNA)), Bachem Bioscience, Inc.

(Eugene, OR) ((Z-Pro-Arg)2-R110 ((Z-PR)2-R110) and (Z-Phe-Arg)2-R110 ((Z-FR)2-R110)). PBS reaction buffer was used with the enzymes catG, HMC, HNE, CT, plasmin, thrombin, trypsin, and u-PA. Cathepsin reaction buffer (50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 4 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA) was used with catL, catB, catK, and catS. Unique reaction buffers were used with PR3 (200 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7), granzyme B (PBS, 4 mM dithiothreitol) and PSA (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20). The reaction buffer for HMC was either PBS or 1 M NaCl buffer (1 M NaCl, 0.2 M Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Tween 20). Trypsin was calibrated by the method of Chase and Shaw (26Chase Jr., T. Shaw E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar) using p-nitrophenyl-p¹-guanidinobenzoate, except that Tris-HCl was used in place of sodium barbiturate. The concentration of α1PI was standardized against calibrated trypsin. Cathepsin G was calibrated against the standardized α1PI. α1ACT was calibrated against the standardized catG. The concentration of HMC was determined by activity of the enzyme in 1.8 M NaCl, 0.45 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% Me2SO, using 1.0 mM Succ-AAPF-pNA (25Schechter N.M. Jordan L.M. James A.M. Cooperman B.S. Wang Z. Rubin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23626-23633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of HMC in this buffer was 0.025 ΔA410/min/pmol. The concentrations of SCCA2 were determined by Bradford analysis (Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit II) and amino acid composition analysis by post-column ninhydrin detection on a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Enzyme inhibition was determined by mixing enzyme and inhibitor in the appropriate buffer and incubating for 30 min at 25°C. Residual enzyme activity was determined by adding the appropriate substrate and measuring its hydrolysis over time (velocity) using the UVmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) or the FluorImager 575 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Due to its enzymatic activity, PSA was incubated with inhibitors at 37°C for 2 h. Initial assays were performed at a ratio of inhibitor/enzyme (I/E) of approximately 10/1. When no inhibition was detected, I/E ratios were increased up to ∼100/1. The concentrations of enzyme, inhibitor, and substrate are listed in Table I, and the buffers are listed above. Percent inhibition = 100 x (1 - (velocity of inhibited enzyme reaction/velocity of uninhibited enzyme reaction)).Table I.Inhibitory profile of SCCA2Proteinase (final concentration)SCCA2Ratio (I/E)InhibitionaProteinase and SCCA2 were incubated for 30 min at 25°C.

Buffers used are listed under “Experimental Procedures.” Percent inhibition = 100 x (1 - (velocity in the presence of inhibitor/velocity of uninhibited control).b Thrombin inhibition was also tested in the presence of 0.1 and 10 μg/ml low molecular weight heparin. Open table in a new tab Assays were performed in a volume of 100 μl in low-binding microtiter plates (Costar 9017, Costar, Cambridge, MA). Varying amounts of inhibitor were incubated with enzyme for 15-30 min at 25°C. Ten microliters of substrate was added to terminate the reaction. The velocity of substrate hydrolysis (i.e. the release of pNA over time) was determined by measuring the A405 using the UVmax microplate reader. The partitioning ratio of the inhibitor-enzyme association was determined by plotting the fractional activity (velocity of the inhibited enzyme reaction/velocity of the uninhibited enzyme reaction) versus the ratio of the inhibitor to enzyme ([I]0/[E]0) (27Salveson G. Nagase H. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 83-104Google Scholar). Linear regression analysis was used to determine the x intercept (i.e. the stoichiometry of inhibition (SI)). The association rate constant for the interaction of catG and HMC with SCCA2 was determined under second order conditions (28Beatty K. Bieth J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3931-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equimolar amounts of protein and inhibitor were incubated at 25°C for varying periods of time. The reaction was stopped by the addition of substrate (final volume 110 μl), and the velocity of the free enzyme activity was measured using the UVmax plate reader. Velocity was converted to free enzyme concentration using an enzyme concentration standard curve. The rate of change in the amount of free enzyme over time is described as shown below, where the slope of the plot of reciprocal remaining free enzyme (1/Ef) over time (t) yields a second order rate constant (ka). 1/Ef=ka×t+1/E0(Eq. 1) The y intercept of this plot is the reciprocal of initial enzyme concentration (E0). The interaction of SCCA2 with HMC was also determined by the progress curve method (29Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar). Under pseudo-first order conditions, a constant amount of enzyme was mixed with different concentrations of inhibitor and excess substrate. The rate of product formation was measured on the UVmax plate reader. Since the inhibition of HMC is assumed to be irreversible over the course of the reaction, product formation is described as shown below, where the amount of product formation (P) proceeds at an initial velocity (vz) and is inhibited over time (t) at a rate (kobs). P=vz/kobs×1−e−kdat(Eq. 2) For each combination of enzyme and inhibitor, a kobs was calculated by nonlinear regression of the data using equation 2. A second order rate constant (k¹) was determined by plotting a series of kobs versus the respective inhibitor concentration and measuring the slope of the line (k¹ = Δkobs/Δ[I]). Since the inhibitor is in competition with the substrate, the second order rate constant k¹ was corrected for the substrate concentration and the Km of enzyme for the substrate in order to calculate the ka. This relationship is described as shown below. ka=k′×1+[S]Km(Eq. 3) The Km of HMC for Succ-AAPF-pNA in PBS was 1.2 mM. Proteins were mixed with 2 x loading buffer (4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 120 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 28 mMβ-mercaptoethanol), heated to 95°C for 5 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide, %T:%C = 19:1) according to the method of Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar). The running buffer (pH 8.3) was 25 mM Tris base, 250 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS. Protein bands were visualized after staining in a solution containing 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, 45% methanol, 10% acetic acid. For amino acid sequence analysis, the ∼4-kDa cleavage fragment formed after mixing SCCA2 with catG was isolated by electrophoresis through a 5-20% gradient gel and by electroblotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-PSQ, Millipore, Bedford, MA) (31Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-terminal peptide sequence analysis was performed using a peptide sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A rabbit polyclonal antisera was raised against SCCA by immunization of a New Zealand White rabbit with the GST-SCCA2 fusion protein. The antisera was passed over a glutathione-Sepharose 4B-GST column, and its specificity was tested on immunoblots containing GST-SCCA1, GST-SCCA2, ovalbumin, and GST. As expected, the polyclonal anti-SCCA reagent detected both SCCA2 and SCCA1, but not the closely related serpin, ovalbumin. The preimmune sera did not detect any of these proteins. Other tests of antisera specificity included: (i) detection of the appropriately sized 45-kDa band on immunoblots of cell lysates prepared from SCCA1 or SCCA2 transfected cell lines but not from mock transfected, non-SCCA-expressing controls; and (ii) immunoprecipitation of in vitro translated, 35S-labeled SCCA1 or SCCA2 proteins but not the control luciferase protein. Translation products were generated using a coupled transcription-translation in vitro expression system (Promega, Madison, WI) with plasmids containing the cDNA of SCCA2, SCCA1, or luciferase under the control of a T7 promoter. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were electroblotted at 100 V for 1 h at 4°C, onto reinforced nitrocellulose (NitroPlus, Micron Separations, Inc., Westborough, MA) as described (32Silverman G.A. Yang E. Proffitt J.H. Zutter M. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5469-5478Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The transfer buffer was 25 mM Tris base, pH 8.0, 190 mM glycine (pH 8.3). Membrane-bound protein was detected using the Western Light chemiluminescence kit from Tropix (Bedford, MA), per the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, the blot was washed three times in wash buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated for 1 h in I-Block (Tropix) blocking buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.2% I-Block). The blot was incubated for 1 h with primary antisera. The primary detection antibodies were the rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against SCCA (for the purpose of detecting the purified GST-SCCA2 fusion protein unadsorbed antiserum at 1/100,000 dilution in blocking buffer was used), catG (1/5,000 dilution, Athens Research Biotechnologies), and HMC (1/1,000 dilution, 33Schechter N.M. Choi J.K. Slavin D.A. Deresienski D.T. Sayama S. Dong G. Lavker R.M. Proud D. Lazarus G.S. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 962-970PubMed Google Scholar). After three rinses in wash buffer, the blot was incubated with a secondary antibody (1/10,000 dilution of an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody provided in the Western Light kit) and then washed two times in wash buffer and three times in chemiluminescent assay buffer (0.1 M diethanolamine-HCl, pH 9.8, 1.0 mM MgCl2, 5% NitroBlock). The blot was incubated for 5 min with detection substrate (either CSPD or CDP-Star (Tropix) diluted to 0.25 mM in chemiluminescent assay buffer). Chemiluminescence was detected by photography. To remove bound antibodies prior to re-probing, the blot was incubated at 65°C for 20 min in a solution containing 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2.0% SDS, 0.1 Mβ-mercaptoethanol. A Leu-Ser at the putative reactive center (P1-P1¹), suggested that SCCA2 could inhibit chymotrypsin-like proteinases such as CT, HMC, catG, or PSA (Fig. 1). However, predictions of inhibitory specificity based only on reactive site residues are unreliable. Therefore, we screened for SCCA2 inhibitory activity by incubating the serpin with a panel of serine and cysteine proteinases prior to the addition of the appropriate enzyme substrate (Table I). SCCA2 inhibited completely the enzymatic activity of the chymotrypsin-like proteinases HMC and catG, but showed no inhibitory activity against CT or PSA. SCCA2 also showed a modest inhibition of PR3, but not HNE. SCCA2 showed no activity against trypsin-like proteinases, granzyme B, or several papain-like cysteine proteinases (cathepsins B, L, and K). SCCA2 in the presence or absence of heparin did not inhibit thrombin. Upon binding with their target proteinases, most serpins form complexes that are stable to denaturation in SDS, even in the presence of reducing agents (34Longas M.O. Finlay T.H. Biochem. J. 1980; 189: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This stability indicates the presence of a covalent bond between the enzyme and inhibitor, which arises through stabilization of a covalent intermediate analogous to that formed during peptide bond hydrolysis (35Wilczynska M. Fa M. Ohlsson P.-I. Ny T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29652-29655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF"
https://openalex.org/W2058106838,"Although the structure of the 20 S proteasome from <i>Thermoplasma acidophilum</i> has been elucidated, its enzymatic properties have not been explored in depth. <i>Thermoplasma</i> proteasomes, which contain one type of active site, exhibit not only ""chymotrypsin-like"" activity (as reported), but also some ""post-glutamyl"" and ""trypsin-like"" activities. Like eukaryotic proteasomes, its activity can be stimulated by SDS, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and also guanidine HCl, but not urea. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by novel peptide aldehydes with hydrophobic P4 residues, and was rapidly inactivated by 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (DCI). DCI modified the N-terminal threonine of the catalytic β-subunit, the presumed active site nucleophile. To define how proteins are degraded, casein was derivatized with fluorescein isothiocyanate to facilitate detection of released products by the proteasome. Many fluorescent peptides were generated, but the relative amounts of different peptides were independent of the duration of the reaction. The rate of disappearance of protein substrates paralleled the rate of appearance of small products. Unlike conventional proteases, proteasome degrades proteins processively without release of polypeptide intermediates. Upon activation by SDS, guanidine, heat (55°C), or partial inhibition with DCI, proteasomes still functioned processively, but generated a different pattern of peptides under each condition. Thus, processivity is an inherent feature of the 20 S proteasome, not requiring all active sites or ATP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2119093680,"YY1 is a multifunctional transcription factor implicated in both positive and negative regulation of gene expression as well as in initiation of transcription. We show that YY1 is ubiquitously expressed in growing, differentiated, and growth-arrested cells. The protein is phosphorylated and has a half-life of 3.5 h. To define functional domains, we have generated a large panel of YY1 mutant proteins. These were used to define precisely the DNA-binding domain, the region responsible for nuclear localization, and the transactivation domain. The two acidic domains at the N terminus each provide about half of the transcriptional activating activity. Furthermore, the spacer region between the Gly/Ala-rich and zinc finger domains has accessory function in transactivation. YY1 has been shown previously to bind to TAFII55, TATA box-binding protein, transcription factor IIB, and p300. In addition, we identified cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CBP)-binding protein as a YY1 binding partner. Surprisingly, these proteins did not bind to the domains involved in transactivation, but rather to the zinc finger and Gly/Ala-rich domains of YY1. Thus, these proteins do not explain the transcriptional activating activity of YY1, but rather may be involved in repression or in initiation.

Thus, these proteins do not explain the transcriptional activating activity of YY1, but rather may be involved in repression or in initiation. Different mechanisms have been implicated in the regulation of gene transcription by YY1. Depending on the context, YY1 was shown to either stimulate or repress gene expression (for review, see 1Hahn S. Curr. Biol. 1992; 2: 152-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar and 2Shrivastava A. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5151-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The mechanistic basis of these two different activities has not been characterized. However, recent evidence indicates that the interaction of YY1 with the coactivator p300 may be relevant in determining whether YY1 functions as an activator or repressor (3Lee T.-C. Shi Y. Schwartz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9814-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Furthermore, YY1 has been described as an initiator-binding protein (4Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.-S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). This has been supported by the finding that YY1 can stimulate basal transcription in vitro in combination with TFIIB 1The abbreviations used are: TFIIBtranscription factor IIBTBPTATA box-binding proteinAAVadeno-associated virusCREBcAMP-responsive element-binding proteinCBPCREB-binding proteinHAhemagglutininGSTglutathione S-transferasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and RNA polymerase II, notably in the absence of the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) (5Usheva A. Shenk T. Cell. 1994; 76: 1115-1121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In addition, YY1 has been recently identified as a component of a large RNA polymerase II complex that contains YY1 in stoichiometric amounts with RNA polymerase II and several general transcription factors as well as DNA repair proteins (6Maldonado E.

Yet another aspect of YY1 function has been uncovered by demonstrating its identity to the nuclear matrix protein NMP-1 (7Guo B. Odgren P.R. van Wijnen A.J. Last T.J. Nickerson J. Penman S. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10526-10530Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These data imply that YY1 may also be involved in aspects of chromatin organization possibly by tethering DNA to the nuclear matrix. Together, these findings suggest that YY1 participates in a number of different processes associated with regulation of gene transcription. transcription factor IIB TATA box-binding protein adeno-associated virus cAMP-responsive element-binding protein CREB-binding protein hemagglutinin glutathione S-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Interestingly, YY1 function and regulation have been linked to the adenovirus protein E1A and the proto-oncoprotein c-Myc (3Lee T.-C. Shi Y. Schwartz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1993; 262: 1889-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Originally, it was found that E1A-mediated activation of the adeno-associated virus (AAV) P5 promoter results from relief of YY1 repression (4Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.-S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). This seems not to be due to a direct interaction of E1A with YY1, but rather the effect of binding of E1A to the coactivator p300 in a p300-YY1 complex (3Lee T.-C. Shi Y. Schwartz R.J. Proc. Natl.

Thus, in this complex, p300 appears to acquire a new quality as mediator of repression, whereas it supports activation of all other studied transcriptional regulators including CREB and c-Myb (11Lundblad J.R.

Artandi S. Goff S.P. Calame K. Science. 1993; 262: 1889-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). 2M. Austen, unpublished results. In addition, YY1 can also transactivate the mouse c-myc promoter (9Riggs K.J. Saleque S. Wong K.-K. Merrell K.T. Lee J.-S. Shi Y. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7487-7495Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Since both E1A and c-Myc are potent cell growth regulators (for review, see 13Henriksson M. Lüscher B. Adv.

YY1 is a zinc finger-containing transcriptional regulator with homology to the GLI-Krüppel family of proteins (4Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.-S. Shenk T.

The analysis of YY1 deletion mutants, mainly in the context of Gal4 fusion proteins, has indicated that the zinc finger region is responsible for DNA binding and that the N-terminal region contains a transactivation domain (8Lee T.-C.

Biol. 1993; 13: 6621-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The repression function of YY1 has been mapped to the very C terminus, a region also essential for DNA binding (4Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.-S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 8Lee T.-C. Zhang Y. Schwartz R.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1047-1052PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lee J.-S. See R.H. Galvin K.M. Wang J. Shi Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 925-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Here we report that YY1 is a rather stable phosphorylated protein expressed at comparable levels in both growing and differentiating cells. In addition, using a panel of YY1 mutant proteins, we show that all four zinc fingers are required for specific DNA binding. We have mapped a region, including fingers 2 and 3, essential for efficient nuclear targeting. Furthermore, the transactivation domain is bipartite, with each of the two acidic domains at the N terminus contributing about half of the transactivating potential, whereas the spacer region between the Gly/Ala-rich and zinc finger domains has accessory function for transactivation. In addition to binding to p300 (3Lee T.-C. Shi Y. Schwartz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9814-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that YY1 can also interact with the CREB-binding protein (CBP). However, binding to CBP as well as to the previously described interaction partners TFIIB, TBP, and TAFII55 (5Usheva A. Shenk T. Cell. 1994; 76: 1115-1121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 21Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) does not require the transactivation domains, but instead the Gly/Ala-rich and zinc finger domains. These findings connect the binding of YY1 to CBP, TFIIB, TBP, and/or TAFII55 to repression or initiation rather than transactivation. RK13 cells, a rabbit kidney epithelium-derived cell line, were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. CV1, HeLa, F9 teratocarcinoma, NIH3T3, PC12, and primary rat embryo fibroblast cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. 70Z, U937, Jurkat, Ramos, and Manca cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin; the medium for 70Z cells also contained 0.2 mMβ-mercaptoethanol. For differentiation, F9 cells were treated with 0.5 mM retinoic acid and 1 μM dibutyryl cAMP; 70Z cells with 0.4 μg/ml bacterial lipopolysaccharide; and U937 cells with 10 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, 1 mM retinoic acid, or 10 nM vitamin D3. Transient transfections were performed using a standard calcium phosphate transfection protocol as described previously (22Bousset K. Oelgeschläger M. Henriksson M. Schreek S. Burkhardt H. Litchfield D.W. Lüscher Firzlaff J.M. Lüscher B. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 501-511PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/plate. Each 6-cm plate received 2 μg of reporter plasmid, 2 μg of pRSVlacZ as internal control, and the amounts of effector plasmids indicated. All transfections were done in duplicates or triplicates, and all experiments were performed at least four times. Cells were harvested after 36-48 h, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined. The pCB6+-based YY1 expression vector (pCMVYY1) was a gift of M. Atchison (17Park K. Atchison M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9804-9808Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). A BglII-ClaI fragment from this construct was inserted into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene), and the resulting pBSYY1 plasmid was used for mutagenesis. Deletions were made either by exploiting existing restriction sites or by introducing new sites by polymerase chain reaction. All junctions and all polymerase chain reaction-derived sequences were verified by sequencing. None of the deletion mutants contains additional amino acids at the junctions. The YY1 deletion mutants were then cloned into the EcoRI site of pCB6+. pCMVHAYY1, pCMVHAYY1Δ399-414, and pCMVHAYY1Δ334-414 were generated by insertion of a short DNA fragment encoding a start codon followed by a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope between the BglII site in the pCB6+ polylinker and the NcoI site overlapping the ATG codon of the YY1 coding sequence. min-tk-luc consists of nucleotides −32 to +51 of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter inserted into XP-2 (23Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar) and has been described previously (22Bousset K. Oelgeschläger M. Henriksson M. Schreek S. Burkhardt H. Litchfield D.W. Lüscher Firzlaff J.M. Lüscher B. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 501-511PubMed Google Scholar). P5+1-tk-luc was constructed by insertion of an oligonucleotide containing the P5+1 sequence from the AAV P5 promoter (4Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.-S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) into the SalI site of min-tk-luc. pRSVlacZ was obtained from I. Bredemeier. GST-TFIIB was a gift of F. Holstege and M. Timmers. GST-TBP was constructed by insertion of the cDNA for human TBP (gift of M. Timmers) into pGEX2T. pGEX-hTAFII55 consists of a fragment from pF:55-11d (obtained from R. Roeder) encoding amino acids 1-257 preceded by a Flag tag in pGEX2T (21Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The GST-CBP fusion proteins were a gift of R. Janknecht (24Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar). For electrophoretic mobility shift assays, control or transiently transfected cells were harvested in 300-500 μl of F-buffer/10-cm plate (F-buffer = 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM NaF, 5 μM ZnCl2, 100 μM Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 units/ml α-macroglobulin, 2.5 units/ml pepstatin, 2.5 units/ml leupeptin, 0.15 mM benzamidine, and 2.8 μg/ml aprotinin), vortexed for 30 s, and subsequently centrifuged at 4°C and 14,000 rpm for 30 min (25Oelgeschläger M. Janknecht R. Krieg J. Schreek S. Lüscher B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2771-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). As probe, an end-labeled oligonucleotide from the P5+1 site in the AAV P5 promoter was used: 5′-AGCTTAGGGTCTCCATTTTGAAGCGGTCGA. 1-3 μl of cell extract was incubated with 0.1-0.5 ng of probe in 12 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 60 mM KCl, 1 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 at 30°C for 30 min. The DNA-protein complexes were separated on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 25 mM Tris base, 25 mM boric acid, and 0.5 mM EDTA at 4°C and 20 V/cm. The polyclonal antiserum 263 was generated by immunization of a rabbit with bacterially expressed and purified His-tagged YY1. pDS56HisYY1 was a gift of T. Shenk (4Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.-S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Affinity purification of the antibodies was performed on a matrix containing purified His-tagged YY1 covalently coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. Anti-YY1 C20 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The 12CA5 monoclonal anti-HA antibody was a gift of R. Janknecht. For Western blots, cells were transfected as for reporter gene assays. The cells were then lysed in antibody buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.5% SDS, and 0.5% aprotinin) (26Lüscher B. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), standardized for β-galactosidase activity, and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Staining was carried out using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For immunofluorescence, RK13 cells were seeded onto coverslips that were placed in 6-cm tissue culture plates and transfected with 3 μg of the indicated expression constructs. The cells were fixed 24 h later in 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 20% horse serum (blocking buffer) for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with antibodies diluted in blocking buffer (anti-YY1 C20, 1:2000; affinity-purified 263 anti-YY1, 1:2000; control antibodies, 1:2000; and monoclonal anti-HA, 1:20). After extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline, secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit Cy3 or anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate) were applied in blocking buffer. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258, and coverslips were mounted in Moviol containing isopropyl gallat. Photographs were taken using a Zeiss Axiophot photomicroscope and Kodak color slide film. Scanned images were arranged and labeled with Adobe Photoshop. For metabolic labeling, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated for 15 min in methionine-free medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine. Cells were either immediately lysed in antibody buffer or chased in medium containing an excess of unlabeled methionine for the indicated times prior to lysis. After sonification and removal of insoluble material by centrifugation, immunoprecipitations were performed as described (26Lüscher B. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Quantification of individual bands was performed on a Fuji phosphorimager. For expression of GST-TFIIB, GST-TBP, and GST-TAFII55, the corresponding plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE)LysS. 200-ml cultures were grown to a density of A600 = 0.8, induced with 2 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, and incubated for an additional 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 15 ml of buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1% aprotinin, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and sonicated, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Supernatants were applied to glutathione-agarose, and bound proteins were eluted in buffer A containing 5 mM glutathione. Eluted fusion proteins were dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol. Protein concentrations were estimated in comparison with bovine serum albumin after SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. YY1 deletion mutants were transcribed/translated in vitro using the TNT-coupled T7/reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. The products were separated by SDS-PAGE and quantitated using a phosphorimager. For GST pull-down assays, 10 μg of each fusion protein was bound to 15 μl of glutathione-agarose and incubated with equal numbers of counts of each mutant in binding buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.05% Triton X-100) (12Oelgeschläger M. Krieg J. Lüscher Firzlaff J.M. Lüscher B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5966-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) at 4°C for 90 min. Then the beads were washed three times with binding buffer. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To study the YY1 protein, we developed an antiserum against full-length bacterially expressed YY1. This serum (263) reacted specifically with a protein of 68 kDa in all cell lines analyzed as well as with bacterially expressed His-tagged YY1 (Fig. 1 and data not shown). The specificity of the serum was established by performing immunoprecipitation/Western blotting and blocking experiments in combination with a commercially available antiserum (Fig. 1a). YY1 was detected in fibroblasts (NIH3T3, CV1, and RK13), in primary rat embryo fibroblasts, in cells of hematopoietic origin (Jurkat, 70Z/3, Manca, Ramos, and U937), in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, in HeLa epithelium-like cells, and in the F9 embryonal carcinoma cell line by metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitation as well as by immunoblotting (Fig. 1 (b-d) and data not shown). Comparable levels of YY1 were expressed in all cell lines analyzed. To determine the stability of YY1, we performed pulse-chase experiments. Jurkat or F9 cells were pulse-labeled for 15 min with [35S]methionine and chased in excess unlabeled methionine for the times indicated (Fig. 1d). YY1 appeared to be a rather stable protein with a half-life of 3.5-4 h as revealed by quantification of immunoprecipitated YY1 using a phosphorimager. A similar half-life of YY1 was determined in NIH3T3 cells and in rat embryo fibroblasts (data not shown). To further evaluate YY1 protein expression, we analyzed YY1 levels during differentiation. Similar amounts of protein were detected during retinoic acid/dibutyryl cAMP-induced F9 cell differentiation; during lipopolysaccharide-induced 70Z/3 B cell differentiation; and during 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-, retinoic acid-, or vitamin D3-induced U937 differentiation (Fig. 1c and data not shown). In addition, during F9 differentiation, no significant change in the stability of YY1 was observed (Fig. 1d). These findings identify YY1 as a uniformly expressed protein both in growing and differentiating cells. To define functional domains in YY1, a series of deletion mutants were generated (Fig. 2). All these proteins were expressed efficiently in COS-7 and RK13 cells (Fig. 3 and data not shown). The DNA binding capacity of YY1 and YY1 mutant proteins overexpressed in COS-7 cells was analyzed in electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments. As probe, the P5+1 sequence from the AAV P5 promoter (4Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.-S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) was used, which was bound by endogenous YY1 in COS-7 and F9 cells as well as by bacterially expressed His-tagged YY1 (Fig. 4). The specificity of the complex was demonstrated by the ability of purified YY1 antibodies to inhibit binding, whereas unrelated antibodies had no effect (Fig. 4). Furthermore, binding to P5+1 was competed by specific (but not by nonspecific) oligonucleotides (data not shown). All the mutant YY1 proteins with deletions in the zinc finger region were unable to bind to the P5+1 oligonucleotide (Fig. 4). These findings show that all four zinc fingers are essential for the specific binding of YY1 to DNA.Fig. 3Expression of the YY1 mutant proteins. RK13 cells were cotransfected with constructs expressing wild-type YY1 (wt), the indicated mutants, or control vector and a construct expressing β-galactosidase and P5+1-tk-luc, identical as for the reporter gene assays. Whole cell lysates were prepared in antibody buffer, and the expression of the different proteins was analyzed by Western blotting. The blot on the left was developed using the YY1 C20 antibodies, and the one on the right using purified YY1 antibodies (serum 263-7). Wild-type YY1 is indicated as well as a nonspecific band cross-reacting with YY1 C20 antibodies (*).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4DNA binding of YY1 and YY1 mutant proteins. Whole cell extracts were prepared in F-buffer from undifferentiated F9 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells (left panel) or from COS-7 cells transfected with plasmids expressing the indicated proteins (right panel). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using a labeled P5+1 oligonucleotide and endogenous YY1, exogenous YY1 and YY1 mutant proteins, and bacterially expressed His-tagged YY1 (H6-YY1). The specificity of the DNA-protein complex was analyzed using specific antibodies.

Endogenous YY1 was detected exclusively in the cell nucleus using affinity-purified 263-7 antibodies (Fig. 5a). Exogenously expressed YY1 was stained with a commercially available anti-peptide serum recognizing the C terminus of YY1 since it recognizes a defined epitope and its reactivity was too low to stain the endogenous protein under the conditions employed. Mutants with deletions of the C terminus (YY1Δ399-414 and YY1Δ334-414) were tagged with an HA epitope and detected with a monoclonal antibody against HA. All the mutant proteins either with deletions of N-terminal regions or with deletions affecting either the first or fourth zinc finger showed nuclear localization (Fig. 5 (b and c) and data not shown). A deletion of the first zinc finger and the two Cys residues involved in coordinating Zn2+ of the second zinc finger (YY1Δ296-331) distributed mainly to the nucleus (Fig. 5b). Deletion of the entire C terminus including part of the second, third, and fourth zinc fingers resulted in a protein (YY1Δ334-414) with predominant cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 5c). These data suggest that the nuclear localization signal of YY1 is contained within the region encoding the second and third zinc fingers as summarized in Fig. 2. YY1 has been implicated in both positive and negative regulation of gene transcription. To analyze the domains in YY1 responsible for these functions, the gene regulatory activities of the YY1 mutants were tested. Reporter constructs were made containing a minimal thymidine kinase promoter and the luciferase gene with or without the P5+1 YY1-binding site (4Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.-S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). First, the role of the P5+1 binding site was determined in three different cell lines. Whereas in CV1 and RK13 cells the presence of a P5+1 site led to an increase in reporter activity, a slight decrease was observed in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 6a). Expression of exogenous YY1 resulted in a binding site-dependent activation of the reporter construct in all three cell lines. In addition, the activation was dose-dependent in the range of 1 ng to 1 μg of pCMVYY1 (Fig. 6b and data not shown). Under these conditions, we have not observed any repression. However, reduced activation was seen when pCMVYY1 concentrations of 2 μg or higher were used, most likely due to squelching as a result of highly overexpressed YY1. Next we were interested to determine the transactivating potential of the different YY1 mutant proteins. These analyses revealed that the YY1 mutant proteins can be divided into three classes. Deletion of the His cluster (YY1Δ69-85) or the Gly/Ala-rich region (YY1Δ154-199) did not affect the transactivating activity of the resulting mutant proteins compared with wild-type YY1 (Fig. 7). Proteins with deletions of either of the two acidic regions (YY1Δ2-62 and YY1Δ92-153) or of the spacer region between the Gly/Ala-rich and DNA-binding domains (YY1Δ199-273) showed transcriptional activity that was reduced by 50% compared with YY1 (Fig. 7). Deletions including both acidic domains (YY1Δ2-150, YY1Δ2-197, and YY1Δ2-273) were inactive in stimulating transcription of the P5+1-tk-luc reporter construct (Fig. 7 and data not shown). Similarly, all the mutant proteins with deletions in the C terminus inhibiting DNA binding (YY1Δ262-299, YY1Δ296-331, YY1Δ334-414, and YY1Δ399-414) were unable to stimulate the expression of the reporter (Fig. 7 and data not shown). None of the YY1 mutant proteins displayed an increased transactivating activity as compared with wild-type YY1, suggesting that no single domain, as deleted in our panels of mutants, was important for repression, in addition to the previously identified C terminus. These differences in transactivation were the result of deleting functional domains and were not due to differences in protein expression (see Fig. 3). Similar expression levels were found for all the mutants in comparison with wild-type YY1, with the exception of YY1Δ2-273, which showed consistently reduced steady-state levels. These"

Nature. 1996; 382: 634-637Crossref Scopus (711) Google Scholar), whereas potassium is transported in the opposite direction (11Kanner B.I. Sharon I. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3949-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In addition, glutamate transport is accompanied by alkalinization of the external medium (15Bouvier M. Szatkowski M. Amato A. Attwell D. Nature. 1992; 360: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and transport of glutamate can be driven by a pH gradient (16Nelson P.J. Dean G.E. Aronson P.S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5459-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether a proton is cotransported with glutamate or an hydroxyl is antiported (17Billups B. Rossi D. Attwell D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6722-6731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but recent evidence favors cotransport with a proton (14Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 634-637Crossref Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Mechanistic studies have shown that the transport process is ordered and that sodium and potassium are translocated in distinct steps. The sodium ions bind first, followed by glutamate. After their translocation and release on the inside, potassium binds on the inside and is translocated outwards to complete the translocation cycle (18Kanner B.I. Bendahan A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6327-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 19Pines G. Kanner B.I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Because all substrates are charged molecules, conserved charged amino acids located in hydrophobic stretches of the transporter proteins are likely to be important for the binding and translocation of these substrates. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified four amino acid residues (GLT-1 numbering) important for the transport process: histidine 326 (20Zhang Y. Pines G. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19573-19577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the acidic amino acid residues aspartate 398, glutamate 404, and aspartate 470 (21Pines G. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17093-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the in-depth characterization of a mutant in which glutamate 404 has been changed into aspartate. This mutant, E404D, appears to be able to catalyze the exchange of glutamate and aspartate but unable to carry out net flux of the acidic amino acids. We show that glutamate 404 is important for carrying out the potassium transporting limb of the cycle, suggesting that this residue may represent part of the potassium binding site. Capped mRNAs transcribed from the cDNAs encoding the rat brain glutamate transporter GLT-1 (7Pines G. Danbolt N.C. Bjoras M. Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Eide L. Koepsell H. Storm-Mathisen J. Seeberg E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17093-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were microinjected into state V-VI Xenopus oocytes (50 ng/oocyte), and membrane currents were recorded 3-6 days later (13Wadiche J.I. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Recording solution (Ringer) contained 96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM CaCl2, and 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. In Na+ or Cl− substitution experiments, ions were replaced with equimolar choline or gluconate, respectively. Two microelectrode voltage-clamp recordings were performed at 22°C with a Geneclamp 500 interfaced to an IBM-compatible PC using a Digidata 1200 A/D control using the pCLAMP 6.0 program suite (Axon Instruments) and to a Macintosh using a MacLab A/D (ADInstruments). The currents were low pass-filtered between 10 Hz and 1 kHz and digitized between 20 Hz and 5 kHz. Microelectrodes were filled with 3 M KCl solution and had resistances of <1 megaohms. Offset voltages in Cl− substitution experiments were avoided by the use of a 3 M KCl-agar bridge from the recording chamber to a 3 M KCl reservoir containing an Ag/AgCl electrode. Current-voltage relations were determined either by measurement of steady-state currents in response to bath application of substrates or by off-line subtraction of control current records obtained during 200-ms voltage pulses to potentials between −100 and +40 mV from corresponding current records in the presence of substrate. Current measurements were made during superfusion of 100 μM [3H]D-aspartate (0.42 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.) onto oocytes voltage-clamped at various potentials for 100 s. Following washout of the bath (<20 s), oocytes were rapidly transferred into a scintillation tube, lysed, and measured for radioactivity. In control experiments, no significant efflux of radiolabel was detected during this time in oocytes injected with 100 pmol of [3H]D-aspartate (final concentration, 100 μM). Currents induced by 3H-labeled amino acids were recorded using Chart software (ADInstruments) and integrated off-line, followed by correlation of charge transfer with radiolabel flux in the same oocytes. HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (heat-inactivated), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM glutamine. Infection with recombinant vaccinia/T7 virus vTF7-3 and subsequent transfection with plasmid DNA was done as described (22Keynan S. Suh Y.-J. Kanner B.I. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1974-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) using pT7-GLT-1 (shortened insert; 23Casado M. Bendahan A. Zafra F. Danbolt N.C. Aragon C. Gimenez C. Kanner B.I. J.

Cells from two wells were washed twice with 1 ml PBS and then taken up in 20 μl of PBS. The cell suspension was mixed with liposomes (4 μmol of asolectin and 0.7 μmol of brain phospholipids) and 0.9% cholate in a final volume of 220 μl of a solution of identical composition as the one used to equilibrate the spin columns, used for the subsequent reconstitution (24Radian R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11859-11865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The columns were equilibrated with 5 mM Tris-SO4, pH 7.4, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1% glycerol, and other ions and amino acids corresponding to the desired “in-medium” as detailed in the figure legends. In the case of exchange experiments, acidic amino acid, usually 10 mML-aspartate, was included in the equilibration buffer of the spin-column. The external L-aspartate was removed by passing these proteoliposomes over a spin column of identical composition but lacking the amino acid. The control liposomes (without entrapped L-aspartate) were also passed through a second spin column. Uptake of [3H]D-aspartate was measured as described (21Pines G. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17093-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) using 20 μl of proteoliposomes into 360 μl of 0.15 M NaCl and 1 μCi of [3H]D-aspartate (11.5 Ci/mmol) unless indicated otherwise in the figure legends. Uptake in intact cells was performed as described (22Keynan S. Suh Y.-J. Kanner B.I. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1974-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). When expressed in HeLa cells using a vaccinia/T7 recombinant virus, uptake of [3H]D-aspartate mediated by the rat brain glutamate transporter GLT-1 is similar to that in cells expressing a mutant GLT-1 transporter containing the conservative substitution E404→D (21Pines G. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17093-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although similar levels of radiotracer uptake were also seen in voltage-clamped Xenopus oocytes injected with RNA transcribed from the corresponding wild-type and mutant cDNAs, membrane currents recorded simultaneously during radiolabel uptake were dramatically different in the two groups of cells (Fig. 1). While uptake of [3H]D-aspartate in the two groups was similar, the magnitude of currents associated with flux mediated by the mutant transporter was less than 5% of that seen in oocytes expressing the wild-type transporter (Fig. 1). These data show that the mutant E404D transporter mediates uptake of radiolabeled D-aspartate, but they suggest that this uptake is occurring in an essentially electroneutral fashion at −30 mV. Uptake of excitatory amino acids by all glutamate transporter clones thus far characterized results in activation of a current reflecting the sum of the inward current (resulting from cotransport of coupled ions such as sodium) together with a chloride current flowing through a thermodynamically uncoupled conductance pathway (10Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 25Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The voltage dependence of the currents mediated by wild-type GLT-1 and the E404D mutant (GLT-1 E404D) has been examined by clamping oocytes, expressing the transporters, at potentials between +40 and −100 mV in the presence and absence of the transport substrate D-aspartate at 100 μM. In the wild-type GLT-1, inward currents are observed (Fig. 2A) that do not reverse (Fig. 2, A and C), similar to those observed in its human homolog (25Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The behavior of E404D is quite different. In addition to the steady-state current, which is greatly diminished as compared with the wild-type, a relatively slow transient current is observed (Fig. 2B). Neither of these currents are observed in water-injected oocytes (13Wadiche J.I. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The very small steady-state current of E404D does, however, reverse at potentials more positive than −20 mV (Fig. 2, B and C). The aspartate-dependent transient currents appear to be capacitative because the charge movements, following hyperpolarizing or depolarizing pulses, are equal to those following the return to the original potential (Fig. 2B). Although we will speculate on the nature of these transient currents in the “Discussion,” it is important at this point to note that their magnitude indicates that the greatly reduced steady-state currents of E404D are not due to corresponding reduced expression levels of the mutant transporter. This is further supported by the fact that the much faster kainate-sensitive, sodium-dependent transients, which reflect sodium binding to the transporter or a subsequent conformational change (13Wadiche J.I. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), are similar for wild-type and mutant transporters (data not shown). The acidic amino acid-dependent outward current observed in glutamate transporters expressed in oocytes is largely due to a sodium- and glutamate-dependent anion conductance not thermodynamically coupled to the transport cycle (25Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The outward steady-state current in the E404D transporter (Fig. 2C) is largely carried by chloride ions moving into the oocyte because it is greatly attenuated when the external chloride concentration is reduced from 104 to 4.8 mM (Fig. 2D). Further support for this comes from the observations that much larger outward currents are observed when the external chloride is substituted by the highly permeant NO3− ion (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Anion selectivity of wild-type and E404D GLT-1 transporters. Voltage dependence of steady-state currents induced by application of 300 μMD-aspartate to representative oocytes expressing wild-type GLT-1 (A) or E404D (B) transporters with bath solution containing normal Ringer's solution (Cl−) and with Cl− substituted by I−, NO3−, or SCN−.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The anion conductance activated during uptake shows a selectivity sequence favoring chaotropic anions (25Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 26Eliasof S. Jahr C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4153-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and this selectivity sequence was unchanged in the E404D mutant (Fig. 3). Raising external potassium induces reverse transport (18Kanner B.I. Bendahan A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6327-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 27Szatkowski M. Barbour B. Attwell D. Nature. 1990; 348: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is observed in Xenopus oocytes, which have approximately 12 mM intracellular substrate concentrations (28Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The data presented suggest that the E404D transporter may be impaired in potassium binding. Evidence supporting this is presented in Fig. 4. Oocytes expressing the wild-type and E404D transporter have been clamped at 0 mV in Cl−-free Ringer's solution (substituted with nitrate). In the wild-type, superfusion with 100 μMD-aspartate induces the well characterized anion conductance of the transporter as measured by a large outward current, which is dependent on nitrate (Fig. 4A; this current is 20-fold lower in normal Ringer's solution; see also Fig. 2C). This anion conductance can also be induced by exposing the wild-type transporters to external potassium, which will cause the transporter to catalyze efflux of internal glutamate and/or aspartate (Fig. 4A). In the E404D transporters, this anion conductance can be activated by external aspartate but not by external potassium (Fig. 4B), indicating that potassium cannot interact with them. The data from the previous sections indicate that uptake of [3H]D-aspartate by the E404D transporters is due to its exchange with intracellular acidic amino acids but not to its net influx. To prove this, we have solubilized HeLa cells transiently expressing either wild-type or mutant transporters and reconstituted those transporters into liposomes. This system allows control of the composition of the external as well as the internal medium. Fig. 5A shows that potassium-loaded proteoliposomes inlaid with E404D transporters are virtually unable to accumulate [3H]D-aspartate. The accumulation in the wild-type is completely dependent on the presence of external sodium (data not shown). This accumulation is dependent on internal potassium and is not observed when it is replaced by Tris (Fig. 5B, closed triangles). If, however, 10 mML-aspartate is included in the internal medium together with Tris, significant accumulation of [3H]D-aspartate is observed with wild-type and E404D transporters (Fig. 5B) but not with liposomes inlaid with extracts of cells transfected with the vector alone (data not shown). Under these conditions, the accumulation is absolutely dependent on external sodium; similar results are also obtained when L-glutamate is present on the inside and also when sodium is used instead of Tris (data not shown). These experiments prove that E404D proteoliposomes catalyze exchange but cannot catalyze net influx, which is dependent on internal potassium. The ability of external potassium to interact with the mutant proteoliposomes has been investigated after their preloading with [3H]D-aspartate by exchange. After a 10-min accumulation of [3H]D-aspartate into the proteoliposomes by exchange, they have been diluted 10-fold into media containing sodium chloride and 100 μM of unlabeled L-glutamate or D-aspartate (Fig. 6). The two substrates induce a rapid efflux of the previously accumulated [3H]D-aspartate in both the wild-type (Fig. 6A) and the E404D transporter (Fig. 6B). Whereas dilution of the proteoliposomes inlaid with the wild-type transporter into sodium-containing media without anionic amino acids does not result in efflux, a rapid net efflux is obtained into a potassium-containing medium (Fig. 6A). However, no such net efflux is observed in the case of the mutant (Fig. 6B). Dilution into choline-containing media does not lead to efflux, neither in the wild-type nor in the mutant (data not shown).Fig. 6Efflux of [3H]D-aspartate from wild-type or E404D proteoliposomes it via exchange. For each time point 20 μl of proteoliposomes, containing 0.12 M NaPi and 10 mML-aspartate, were loaded with [3H]D-aspartate by dilution into 80 μl of 0.15 M NaCl and 1 μCi of label. After 10 min, the mixture was diluted into 1 ml of 0.15 M KCl (•) or 0.15 M NaCl containing the following additions: none (○); 100 μMD-aspartate (□); or 100 μML-glutamate (▵). At the times indicated on the abscissa, the reactions were terminated. A, wild type; B, E404D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further emphasize the selectivity of the defect of potassium-dependent net flux in the mutant, we have compared another important parameter, i.e. affinity for external sodium. Initial rates of sodium-dependent [3H]D-aspartate transport in HeLa cells expressing wild-type and mutant have a very similar dependence on the external sodium concentration (Fig. 7). Although in the experiment D-aspartate has been used at concentrations below its Km, similar results are obtained when saturating levels (200 μM) are used (data not shown). An identical sodium dependence of [3H]D-aspartate exchange has been observed in proteoliposomes inlaid with wild-type and E404D transporter (data not shown). Thus, E404D is selectively impaired in one or more of the interactions of potassium with the transporter. The transport cycle of glutamate, as it emerges from mechanistic studies (18Kanner B.I. Bendahan A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6327-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 19Pines G. Kanner B.I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), is illustrated in Fig. 8. On the outside, the three sodium ions have to bind to the transporter first (step 1). This is followed by the binding of the acidic amino acid (glutamate in this example; step 2), followed by translocation (step 3). Then the acidic amino acid debinds (step 4), followed by the three sodium ions (step 5). This leaves the binding sites facing inward. To start a new cycle, the transporter has to reorient these sites, and for this purpose, potassium is required. After it binds from the inside (step 6), it is translocated (step 7) and released from the outside (step 8). In the case of net efflux, this cycle is reversed, going clockwise, instead of counterclockwise. Exchange represents a partial reaction of this cycle (steps 1-4 or 5 and back), including the reversible translocation of the acidic amino acid. Net flux is dependent on cis-sodium is external sodium is required for influx and internal sodium for efflux. Also exchange requires sodium, but it does not matter on which of the two sides it is present. Although there are some differences in the relative permeabilities of glutamate and aspartate between E404D and wild-type (21Pines G. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17093-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the dominant feature is that E404D cannot carry out the whole cycle (Fig. 5A) but can exchange (Figs. 5B and 6). These data are in harmony with the electrophysiological data, which indicate that E404D is “locked” in the exchange mode (Fig. 1). Besides the ability to translocate sodium and the acidic amino acid, E404D exhibits an unimpaired substrate-dependent anion conductance (Figs. 2, 3, 4) and a similar affinity to external sodium as the wild-type, both in intact cells (Fig. 7) as well as in proteoliposomes (data not shown). Thus, we are not dealing here with some structural mutation altering the conformation of the transporter, but a specific step is affected. Two possibilities come to mind: 1) potassium binding and/or translocation is impaired; and 2) the affinity for sodium is increased such that the rate of unbinding is dramatically decreased (step 5 for influx, step 1 for efflux). This latter possibility can be excluded because potassium-dependent efflux in E404D liposomes is defective (Fig. 6), whereas the affinity for external sodium is the same as for the wild-type in this preparation. In addition, no marked differences in affinity for internal sodium between wild-type and mutant proteoliposomes are observed (data not shown). Furthermore, whereas in intact cells the affinity of the mutant transporter for external sodium is identical to that of the wild-type (Fig. 7), the mutant transporter has lost the ability to interact with external potassium (Fig. 4). Therefore, our results indicate that potassium binding and/or translocation is impaired in the E404D mutant from the inside as well as from the outside, and that perhaps glutamate 404 is one of the liganding groups for potassium. It is especially striking that the removal of a single methylene group is sufficient to cause this defect. In view of this extremely high specificity, it is perhaps not surprising that other potassium congeners, i.e. rubidium, ammonium, and cesium, which can replace potassium in the wild-type to varying extents, cannot enable net flux in the mutant transporter (data not shown). Voltage jumps in the presence and absence of external D-aspartate reveal that exchange mediated by the E404D mutant is accompanied by a marked transient current that decays with a time constant between 10 and 20 ms (Fig. 2). This transient current is significantly slower than the previously described sodium-dependent and kainate-sensitive transient current in EAAT2, the human homolog of GLT-1 (t = 3-4 msec; 13Wadiche J.I. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). This latter current is thought to reflect sodium binding and/or state transitions involving charge movements subsequent to sodium binding. Such sodium-dependent conformational changes have recently been monitored experimentally in GLT-1 (29Grunewald M. Kanner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17017-17024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The slower transient currents associated with the exchange step may reflect reversible movement of sodium and glutamate across the electric field during this partial reaction cycle. The E404D mutant mediates a sodium- and aspartate-dependent anion conductance (Fig. 2-4). The selectivity of this conductance is unchanged from the wild-type transporter (SCN > NO3 > I > Cl; Fig. 3; see also 25Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar and 26Eliasof S. Jahr C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4153-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This result indicates that the anion-conducting state is likely to correspond to a sodium- and glutamate-occupied state (25Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), rather than a state in the potassium-transporting limb of the transport cycle (Fig. 8). A similar conclusion has been reached with independent experiments (17Billups B. Rossi D. Attwell D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6722-6731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The current activated by aspartate in E404D reverses close to the reversal potential for Cl, consistent with electroneutral exchange with little or no net electrogenic transport. The residue E404D is conserved among all cloned mammalian glutamate transporters and is expected to fulfill a similar role in them. Mutation of the corresponding residue in EAAT3 (30Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the human homolog of EAAC1 (9Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar), also abolished potassium-dependent efflux. 1M. P. Kavanaugh, unpublished observations. Interestingly, this residue is not conserved in the related neutral amino acid transporter ASCT-1 (31Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Fairman W.A. Wu Y.-N. Murdoch G.H. North R.A. Amara S.G. J. Biol.

Glu404 is located in the middle of a structural domain that influences binding of the glutamate analogue kainate (34Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17668-17671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and is also near residue Asp398, which is required for transport (21Pines G. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J.

https://openalex.org/W1970271782,"Endothelin (ET) synthesis is enhanced at sites of ischemia or in injured vessels. The purpose of this study was to explore the possibility of autocrine stimulation of endothelial cell migration by members of the endothelin family. Experiments with microvascular endothelial cell transmigration in a Boyden chemotactic apparatus showed that endothelins 1 and 3, as well as a selective agonist of ETB receptor IRL-1620, equipotently stimulated migration. Endothelial cell migration was unaffected by the blockade of ETA receptor, but it was inhibited by ETB receptor antagonism. Based on our previous demonstration of signaling from the occupied ETB receptor to constitutive nitric oxide (NO) synthase (Tsukahara, H., Ende, H., Magazine, H. I., Bahou, W. F., and Goligorsky, M.

In three independent cellular systems, 1) migration and wound healing by microvascular endothelial cells, 2) wound healing by Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing ETB receptor with or without endothelial NO synthase, and 3) application of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting endothelial NO synthase in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, an absolute requirement for the functional NO synthase in cell migration has been demonstrated.

These findings establish the permissive role of NO synthesis in endothelin-stimulated migration of endothelial cells. Formation of new blood vessels, driven by the morphogenetic program and/or by the functional demand for increased blood supply, is initiated by the budding of endothelial cells off the microcirculatory bed. Tissue hypoxia represents a physiologic stimulus for angiogenesis, and several autocrine angiogenic mediators produced by endothelial cells have been recognized (1Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D.

Since we and others have previously demonstrated that occupancy of ETB receptors in endothelial cells is accompanied by the activation of constitutive endothelial NO synthase (9Tsukahara H. Ende H.

Indeed, there is emerging evidence that NO release serves as a prerequisite for epithelial and endothelial cell motility (11Noiri E. Peresleni T. Srivastava N. Weber P. Bahou W.F. Peunova N.

Our own observations expand this function to the classical angiogenic signal, vascular endothelial growth factor.

In the present study, we used three different approaches (migration and wound healing by endothelial cells, wound healing by Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing ETB receptor with or without eNOS, and application of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting eNOS) to provide evidence that the effect of ET-1 on cell migration is mediated via ETB receptor and requires functional enzymatic machinery for NO generation. endothelin Chinese hamster ovary renal microvascular endothelial cells human umbilical vein endothelial cells NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester nitric oxide NO synthase endothelial NOS endothelin B receptor the phosphorothioate derivatives of oligodeoxynucleotides.

This cell line shows expression of receptors for acetylated low density lipoprotein, staining with an antibody to von Willebrand antigen, and capillary tube formation. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated according to the previously established technique (9Tsukahara H. Ende H. Magazine H.I. Bahou W.F. Goligorsky M.S. J. Biol.

HUVEC were cultured in M199 supplemented with 100 μg/ml heparin, 30 μg/ml endothelial cell growth factor, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and endothelin-3 (ET-3) were purchased from Calbiochem. IRL-1620, BQ123, and BQ788 were generously provided by Dr. Magazine (Queens College, Flushing, NY). NG-Nitro L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) was obtained from Bachem California (Torrance, CA), and S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The generation and characterization of individual cell lines used in this study have been detailed previously (9Tsukahara H. Ende H. Magazine H.I. Bahou W.F. Goligorsky M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21778-21785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO-ETB cell cultures stably integrated copies of the ETBR cDNA cloned, and the amplified insert encompassing the ETB open reading frame was digested with PstI, gel-purified, and ligated into the eukaryotic expression plasmid pMT2. This plasmid is driven by the adenovirus major late promoter and contains the sequences encoding murine dihydrofolate reductase immediately downstream of the cDNA insert, thereby allowing for the establishment of stably integrated cell lines with greatly amplified copy numbers when propagated in the presence of methotrexate (17Kaufman R.J. Sharp P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 159: 601-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Dihydrofolate reductase-deficient CHO cells (18Urlaub G. Chasin L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4216-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) were propagated in nucleoside-free Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Sigma), supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, and subsequently plated at a density of 5 × 105/100 mm2 dish. Cells were transfected with 30 μg of pMT2-ETB or pMT2-wild type using the calcium phosphate transfection method of Chen and Okayama (19Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). After 5 days, selection and amplification were initiated by supplementation of the media with 0.02 μM methotrexate and cells were cloned by limiting dilution. Resistant colonies were subsequently expanded and simultaneously screened for stable integration by genomic hybridization using the 32P-radiolabeled ETB cDNA as probe and for functional expression using fluorescence mapping with biotinylated highly specific ligand, IRL-1620, as previously detailed (9Tsukahara H.

For double transfectants, CHO-ETB cells were retransfected with the cDNA for endothelial cell-derived NOS (20Janssens S.P. Shimouchi A. Quertermous T. Bloch D.B. Bloch K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14519-14522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (kindly supplied by Dr. K. D. Bloch) using the eukaryotic expression plasmid pMEP4 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), which contains an inherent hygromycin B resistance gene and an inducible metallothionein promoter upstream from the NOS cloning site. Stable transfectants (CHO-ETBNOS) were selected using culture medium supplemented with 300 μg/ml hygromycin B (1000 units/mg, Sigma). Resistant colonies were ring cloned, propagated, and functionally evaluated for NO expression using an NO-selective electrode, as detailed previously (9Tsukahara H. Ende H. Magazine H.I. Bahou W.F. Goligorsky M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21778-21785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NOS expression was maximized by supplementation of the medium with 50 μM ZnCl2 for 5 h prior to functional measurements. Migration assay was performed according to the previously described technique (22Shimonaka M. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14284-14289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications, in a Boyden chemotactic apparatus (Neuroprobe, Cabin John, MD). RMVEC were lifted with 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mM EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.) and washed, and 106 cells/ml suspended in 25 μl of M199 with 0.1% bovine serum albumin were added to the lower chamber of a Boyden apparatus. Polycarbonate filters with 8-μm pores (Poretics Corporation, Livermore, CA) were coated with 10 μg/ml ProNectin F (Protein Polymer Technologies, San Diego, CA), washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and positioned above the wells of the lower chemotactic chamber which contained cells. The top half of the chamber was reattached, and the chamber was incubated in an inverted position at 37°C in 95% air + 5% CO2 for 2 h to allow a uniform cell attachment to the filter. The test agents, as specified under “Results,” or a vehicle suspended in 50 μl of M199 with 0.1% bovine serum albumin were added to upper chambers. The chambers were wrapped with Parafilm and incubated for an additional 6 h in an upright position. After incubation, the filter was removed from the apparatus, and cells were fixed with methanol and stained with Dff-Quick (Baxter, Miami, FL). The number of migrated cells on the upper surface of the filter was counted in six randomly chosen fields under × 400 magnification and averaged. All experiments were performed in quadruplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. RMVEC or HUVEC grown in gelatin-coated 35-mm dishes were preincubated in Krebs-Ringer buffer of the following composition (in mM): NaCl 136, KCl 5.4, CaCl2 1.8, MgSO4 0.8, NaH2PO4 1.0, HEPES 10, and 1 g/liter glucose, adjusted to pH 7.4, which was supplemented with 7.5 units/ml superoxide dismutase (Sigma). NO release was monitored with an NO-selective microprobe (Inter Medical Co., Nagoya, Japan), as previously detailed (11Noiri E. Peresleni T. Srivastava N. Weber P. Bahou W.F. Peunova N. Goligorsky M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C794-C802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tip diameter of the probe (25 μm) permitted the use of a micromanipulator (Zeiss-Eppendorff) attached to the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot) and enclosed in a Faraday's chamber to position the sensor approximately 5 μm above the cell surface. Calibration of the electrochemical sensor was performed using different concentrations of a nitrosothiol NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine, as previously detailed (23Ichimori K. Ishida H. Fukabori M. Nakazawa H. Murakami E. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1994; 65: 1-5Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Electrode fabrication and the design of electric cell-substrate impedance sensor, a device that detects with high precision the electrical resistance of cells cultured inside small wells on the surface of a miniature gold electrode, have been reported previously (24Giaever I. Keese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7896-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 25Ghosh P. Keese C.R. Giaever I. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 1602-1609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Electrodes were precoated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA). Endothelial cells at the density of 2 × 105 were resuspended in Basal Medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 250 μML-arginine (Sigma), and 100 units/ml penicillin 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and seeded on electrodes. To generate “wounds” on the surface of microelectrodes, confluent endothelial monolayers were electropermeabilized with direct current from a 6-V battery generating a local electrical current of 0.12 mA. This procedure resulted in a loss of cells from the surface of the microelectrode, while all surrounding cells remained intact. The rate of repopulation of the microelectrode with migrating cells was monitored for 20 h as changes in resistance and capacitance. Alternatively, uniform wounds were generated using a laser beam. CHO-ETB and CHO-ETBNOS cell monolayers grown on glass coverslips for 2 days were exposed to a wounding procedure as previously detailed (11Noiri E. Peresleni T. Srivastava N. Weber P. Bahou W.F. Peunova N. Goligorsky M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C794-C802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wounds were produced using a single pulse generated by a YAG laser (Coherent 7900, Palo Alto, CA) with energy of 6.5-7.5 mJ. Cell monolayers were arranged perpendicularly to and in the focal plane of the beam (using a micromanipulator, these parameters were kept constant between different experiments). After wounding, the medium was immediately changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. After the wounding, images were recorded immediately and 3 and 6 h later and stored for analysis (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). The surface area of wounds in the consecutive images was measured, the size of the initial wound was expressed as 100%, and the timed progression of wound healing was expressed as fractions of the initial size.

These sequences included the 5′-untranslated region of eNOS cDNA and initiation codon. Thus designed sequences showed no homology with other known mammalian sequences deposited in the GenBank data base, as screened using a Blast program (21Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71433) Google Scholar). All the S-ODNs were purified using oligonucleotide purification cartridges, dried down, resuspended in Tris-EDTA (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), and quantified spectrophotometrically. Prior to migration assays, HUVEC were incubated with 10 μM S-ODNs for 12 h under a serum-free condition. During typical experiments in a Boyden chemotactic chamber (see above), S-ODNs were present in the medium. In parallel experiments, companion HUVEC treated with 10 μM S-ODNs in the serum-free medium were seeded on gelatin-coated coverslips, allowed to attach, and used to verify their responsiveness to ET-1 (1 nM) by monitoring NO release or were stained with monoclonal antibodies directed against eNOS (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), according to the previously described protocol (11Noiri E. Peresleni T. Srivastava N. Weber P. Bahou W.F. Peunova N. Goligorsky M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C794-C802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With regard to NO release and locomotive responses, RMVEC displayed sensitivity to ET-1 within the physiologic concentration range (Fig. 1). ET-1 stimulated NO production by RMVEC, and L-NAME blunted NO release in a dose-dependent manner, with 2 mML-NAME resulting in complete inhibition of NO release (Fig. 1A). Transwell migration of RMVEC, studied in a modified Boyden chamber, showed the similar exquisite sensitivity to ET-1. A statistically significant almost 50% increase in the number of migrated cells was detected with ET-1 concentrations of 10 pM, and it almost doubled with further elevation of ET-1 concentration to 1 nM (Fig. 1B). Inhibition of NO synthase with 2 mML-NAME completely abrogated the ET-1-induced cell migration. Under the conditions of NOS inhibition, endothelial cell migration could be restored in the presence of 8-bromo-cyclic GMP (100 μM), as shown in Fig. 2.Fig. 2Blockade of ET-1-induced endothelial cell migration with L-NAME and reversal of this effect with 8-bromo-cyclic GMP. Experiments were performed in a Boyden apparatus. Transmigration was initiated with 1 nM ET-1 in the presence of 2 mML-NAME with or without 100 μM 8-bromo-cyclic GMP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To elucidate the type of ET receptor(s) involved in the observed stimulation of RMVEC migration, transwell migration experiments were performed with different endothelins and in the presence of selective inhibitors of their receptors. As summarized in Fig. 3, ET-1 and ET-3 were equipotent in stimulating endothelial cell migration. A selective ETBR agonist, IRL-1620 exhibited a similar stimulatory effect, suggesting that the observed phenomena were mediated via ETBR. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that a selective ETA receptor antagonist BQ123 did not affect ET-1-induced endothelial cell transmigration, whereas a selective ETBR antagonist BQ788 completely abrogated the stimulatory action of ET-1. These findings were in concert with ET-1-induced NO release. While BQ123 did not interfere with NO production by endothelial cells stimulated with 1 nM ET-1, pretreatment with BQ788 abrogated NO release in response to ET-1 but not to bradykinin (Fig. 4). It is therefore concluded that ET-1 induces endothelial cell migration via the ETBR and that the previously demonstrated coupling of this receptor to eNOS (9Tsukahara H. Ende H. Magazine H.I. Bahou W.F. Goligorsky M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21778-21785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is critical for NO production and cell migration.Fig. 4ET-1-induced NO release by microvascular endothelial cells is inhibited with BQ788 but not with BQ123.

All tracings are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The rate of endothelial wound healing was examined by electroporation-induced RMVEC denudation from the surface of a gold miniature electrode, as previously detailed (25Ghosh P. Keese C.R. Giaever I. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 1602-1609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). ET-1 accelerated wound healing at 10 h by 66.0 ± 3.2% (n = 5) compared with the control medium (40.4 ± 2.0% (n = 5), p < 0.05) (Fig. 5). The rate of restitution of endothelial integrity was equally enhanced by IRL-1620 and by ET-3, and this effect was abolished by co-application of ETB receptor antagonist BQ788, further implicating ETB receptor in the observed phenomena (Fig. 5, A and B). The addition of L-NAME to ET-1- or ET-3-stimulated endothelial cells virtually abrogated this response (Fig. 5, C and D). To further test the above premise that NO production is required for ET-1-induced RMVEC migration, experiments were performed in a model system of CHO cells expressing ETBR and eNOS, as verified and detailed previously (9Tsukahara H. Ende H. Magazine H.I. Bahou W.F. Goligorsky M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21778-21785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ET-1 was ineffective in stimulating wound healing in CHO cells transfected with ETBR alone (Fig. 6). However, co-expression of both ETBR and eNOS in CHO cells imparted on them the migratory response to ET-1 and resulted in acceleration of wound healing. The data further confirm the permissive role of NO production in ET-1-induced migration. In the next series of experiments, a selective knockdown of eNOS was performed using antisense S-ODNs. To avoid any possible species-specific variations in the sequence, experiments were performed in HUVEC using an antisense construct directed against the initiation codon of human eNOS cDNA. Cells were treated with either antisense, sense, or scrambled S-ODNs, as detailed under “Materials and Methods.” The expression of immunodetectable eNOS in endothelial cells subjected to S-ODNs is presented in Fig. 7, confirming the adequacy of treatments. Functional analysis of endothelial cells subjected to S-ODNs was accomplished by monitoring NO release. Fig. 8A depicts typical tracings of ET-1-induced NO release. Both sense and scrambled S-ODN-treated cells responded to ET-1 with increased NO release, similar to that observed in intact control cells. In contrast, antisense S-ODN-treated HUVEC failed to produce NO in response to ET-1. These data confirm the validity of the utilized S-ODN constructs. To study the effects of ET-1 on motility of S-ODN-treated HUVEC, experiments were performed in a modified Boyden apparatus. As summarized in Fig. 8B, pretreatment of HUVEC with antisense S-ODN resulted in a dramatic deceleration of transmigration, as compared with intact control cells and cells exposed to sense or scrambled constructs.Fig. 8Effects of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting the initiation codon of human eNOS cDNA on nitric oxide release (A) and transwell migration (B) of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Phosphorothioated antisense (AS), sense (S), and scrambled (Scr) constructs were designed and prepared as detailed “Materials and Methods.” Cells were pretreated with oligodeoxynucleotides (10 μM each) for 12 h prior to experiments. As shown in A, 1 nM Et-1 did not stimulate NO release from cells pretreated with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, whereas control (C) cells or cells pretreated with sense and scrambled constructs responded to ET-1 with increased release of NO. (Inset to A shows the time and amplitude scale.) Tracings are representative of 3 separate experiments. In B, companion cells were utilized for ET-1-induced transwell migration experiments. Transmigration was halted only in cells pretreated with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (* denotes p < 0.05 versus control).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, two different endothelial cell preparations, derived from rats and humans, showed a consistent acceleration of motility in response to members of the endothelin family. Through application of specific agonists and antagonists of known endothelin receptors, ETA and ETB, it was possible to implicate ETB receptor in the observed responses. However, these effects of ET were mediated by endogenous NO production, as confirmed by the results of three independent experimental approaches. In the first series of experiments, L-NAME prevented ET-1-induced endothelial cell transwell migration and wound healing. In the second series, CHO-ETBNOS cell, a model cell system devoid of complexity inherent to endothelial cells, showed NO dependence of migration induced by ET-1. Finally, the application of eNOS isoform-selective antisense S-ODNs, but not sense or scrambled constructs, to endothelial cells suppressed their migratory responsiveness to ET-1. From these observations, we derive a conclusion that stimulated NO production serves a permissive role in ET-induced acceleration of endothelial cell motility and wound healing. ETB receptor in endothelial cells serves a unique purpose for autocrine feedback regulation of several physiologic functions by the produced ET-1. The application of anti-ET γ-globulin to cultured endothelial cells inhibits the rate of proliferation (26Takagi Y. Fukase M. Takata S. Yoshimi H. Tokunaga O. Fujita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27Fujitani Y. Oda K. Takimoto M. Inui T. Okada T. Urade Y. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, this receptor is implicated in ET-induced vasodilation (10Takayanagi R. Kitazumi K. Takasaki C. Ohnaka K. Aimoto S. Tasaka K. Ohashi M. Nawata H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that this non-isopeptide-selective receptor is functionally coupled to eNOS and coordinates the release of NO from endothelial cells (9Tsukahara H. Ende H. Magazine H.I. Bahou W.F. Goligorsky M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21778-21785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stably transfected CHO-ETBNOS cells were successfully employed in those studies to reveal, in a simplified model system, that receptor-enzyme coupling involves the tyrosine kinase- and calcium/calmodulin-dependent pathways (9Tsukahara H. Ende H. Magazine H.I. Bahou W.F. Goligorsky M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21778-21785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the studies established a physiologically meaningful communication and coordination between endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor and vasodilator systems that control the vascular tone. Other investigators have also viewed ET-1 generated by endothelial cells as an autocrine motility factor (7Wren A. Hiley C.R. Fan T-P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 8Morbidelli L. Orlando C. Maggi C. Ledda F. Ziche M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: H686-H695PubMed Google Scholar). However, results presented herein implicate for the first time the integral complex system of endothelium-derived vasoactive agonists, endothelin and NO, in endothelial cell motility and implicate this system in vascular remodeling. We have previously demonstrated that NO production is a prerequisite for epithelial cell migration guided by several motogens, including hepatocyte growth factor and epidermal growth factor (11Noiri E. Peresleni T. Srivastava N. Weber P. Bahou W.F. Peunova N. Goligorsky M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C794-C802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The establishment of head-to-tail gradients of NO synthase in locomoting, but not in stationary, epithelial cells was construed as an important regulator of locomotion driven by these guidance cues (11Noiri E. Peresleni T. Srivastava N. Weber P. Bahou W.F. Peunova N. Goligorsky M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C794-C802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, we have established that NO interferes with processes of endothelial cell adhesion to matrix proteins and participates in locomotion initiated by vascular endothelium growth factor.2 These findings provided an experimental basis for a hypothesis ascribing to NO the function of a modulator of cell-matrix adhesion. In this vein, ET-induced NO production by endothelial cells can be considered as a particular example of a more generalized phenomenon of NO-regulated cell motility. The described NO production serving as a prerequisite for endothelial cell locomotion in response to activation of ETB receptor may explain a host of pathophysiologic observations on inadequate angiogenesis despite enhanced generation of ET-1. In hypercholesterolemic pigs and in humans with atherosclerotic lesions, ET-1 generation is augmented (28Lerman A. Webster M.W.I. Chesebro J.H. Edwards W.D. Wei C.-M. Fuster V. Burnett Jr., J.C.

Commun. 1993; 191: 1081-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The reason for the insufficient angiogenesis toward ischemic sites could be conceptually explained by the fact that NO production by the endothelium is suppressed under these conditions (31Chester A.H. O'Neil G.S. Moncada S. Lancet. 1990; 336: 897-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 32Bossaller C. Habib G.B. Yamamoto H. J. Clin.

Similarly, endothelial wound healing after balloon angioplasty is retarded, neointimal formation by proliferating smooth muscle cells is enhanced, and endothelin receptor antagonist SB 209670 protects angioplastic vessels against neointimal formation (14Douglas S.A.

Interpretation of these observations may rest on the above presented findings on the permissive role of NO in endothelial cell migration and wound healing."

https://openalex.org/W2090616624,"We have recently isolated the cDNA for the murine homologue of the stress-inducible phosphoprotein STI1 (also known as IEF SSP 3521 or p60). STI1 was previously shown to be 2-fold up-regulated in MRC-5 fibroblasts upon viral transformation and to exist in a macromolecular complex with heat shock proteins of the HSP 70 and 90 families. By peptide-sequencing we have identified the two heat shock proteins that bind to murine STI1 (mSTI1) as HSC 70 and HSP 84/86. We describe two separate binding regions within mSTI1 for the two heat shock proteins. In the presence of cell extracts, the N-terminal region of mSTI1 binds preferentially to HSC 70, whereas the C-terminal portion of the molecule promotes the binding of HSP 84/86. Heat treatment caused a strong induction of mSTI1 message without affecting the steady-state level of the protein significantly. In addition, heat treatment led to changes in the isoform-composition of mSTI1. pp70s6k, pp90rsk, and mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 were tested as possible STI1 kinases in vitro using recombinant mSTI1 as a substrate: only pp90rsk was able to phosphorylate recombinant mSTI1.

Cellular stress phenomena manifest themselves on a molecular level by affecting the expression, localization, and/or the post-translational modification of a set of structurally unrelated proteins generally referred to as stress proteins (1Georgopoulos C. Welch W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 601-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Although the study of stress-induced changes in the expression or localization of various stress proteins has allowed a deeper insight into the function of these proteins, much less is understood regarding the influence of cell stress on the post-translational modification of these proteins by processes such as phosphorylation. The importance of such stress protein phosphorylation has been highlighted by the recent discovery of the activation of distinct protein kinases by stress signals (reviewed in Waskiewicz and Cooper (2Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar)).

Blatch, V. Kundra, M. Lässle, T. Takatori, and B. R. Zetter, manuscript in preparation. the former one being previously named IEF SSP 3521 (4Honore B. Leffers H. Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H.

Furthermore, ySTI1 shows 38% amino acid identity to the STI1 homologue from soybean (gmSTI1) whose cDNA was recently cloned (6Torres J.H. Chatellard P. Stutz E. Plant Mol.

Most recently the very C-terminal regions of ySTI1 and hSTI1 have been shown to be structurally related to Hip, a tetratrico peptide repeats (TPR) motif containing protein that participates in the regulation of HSC 70 (7Höhfeld J.

Moreover, it was reported to be localized primarily to the nucleus in SV40-transformed MRC-5 fibroblasts, whereas in normal MRC-5 fibroblasts, localization to the Golgi apparatus and small vesicles was observed (4Honore B. Leffers H. Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Vandekerckhove J. Celis J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8485-8491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exact function of STI1 is still unknown, although the protein has been proposed to play an important role in cell proliferation or gene regulation (4Honore B. Leffers H. Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Vandekerckhove J. Celis J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8485-8491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most notable sequence motif found in all STI1 homologues described so far is the so-called TPR which is believed to be important for the formation of macromolecular complexes (8Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). STI1 proteins from several species have been described to form complexes with stress proteins of the HSP 70 (5Smith D.F. Sullivan W.P. Marion T.N. Zaitsu K. Madden B. McCormick D.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and HSP 90 (5Smith D.F. Sullivan W.P. Marion T.N. Zaitsu K. Madden B. McCormick D.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell.

The abundance of the STI1-HSP 70-HSP 90 complex has led to the suggestion that these three proteins function interactively in an as yet undefined cellular context (5Smith D.F. Sullivan W.P. Marion T.N. Zaitsu K. Madden B. McCormick D.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Using a luciferase renaturation assay it was shown that in contrast to HSP 70 and HSP 90, hSTI1 does not possess any significant chaperoning activity (10Schumacher R.J. Hurst R. Sullivan W.P. McMahon N.J. Toft D.O. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9493-9499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in an in vitro reconstitution system using rabbit reticulocyte lysate to study the assembly of the chicken progesterone receptor, STI1 was identified as a transient component in this process without a defined molecular function (reviewed in Smith and Toft (11Smith D.F. Toft D.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and Johnson and Toft (12Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 670-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar)). At least three different stress-relevant MAPK-related pathways have been identified in mammalian cells so far (2Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). These are: 1) the classical p42/p44 pathway, named after extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, which itself can be activated by stress (13Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar) and lies upstream of the stress-inducible S6 kinase pp90rsk, also known as MAPKAP kinase 1 (13Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 14Jurivich D.A. Chung J. Blenis J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 148: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); 2) the p38/HOG1 pathway, which leads to activation of MAPKAP kinase 2 and which is responsible, e.g. for the changes in the phosphorylation pattern of HSP 25 (15Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar); and 3) the Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase pathway which leads to the activation of members of the Jun transcription factor family (16Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, pp90rsk, and Jun N-terminal kinase 1 are known to translocate into the nucleus where they affect the phosphorylation state of their nuclear targets (2Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In the case of the p38/HOG1 pathway, it is p38 itself rather than the further downstream effector MAPKAP kinase 2 that translocates into the nucleus. An additional stress-relevant protein kinase which has not been implicated in classical MAPK pathway patterns is S6 kinase pp70s6k (17Chou M.M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This kinase exists in two isoforms (70 and 85 kDa) within the cell and has been shown to be activated by heat stress (13Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 14Jurivich D.A. Chung J. Blenis J. J. Cell.

We have identified the HSP binding partners of mSTI1 by peptide sequencing as HSC 70 and HSP 84/86. We have further characterized their binding interaction in more detail utilizing a set of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins comprising different parts of the mSTI1 molecule. Furthermore, we describe the effects of heat treatment on mSTI1 mRNA and protein levels in NIH 3T3 cells. Besides the existence of a nuclear fraction of mSTI1, we have found most of the protein to be cytosolic. Finally using different fusion proteins of mSTI1 as substrates in in vitro phosphorylation reactions with different kinases, we offer an explanation for the observed localization of the nuclear fraction of this protein, as well as linkage to a specific stress-relevant signal transduction pathway.

Recombinant murine HSP 25 was from StressGen (Victoria, BC, Canada). Bovine brain HSC 70 and HSP 90 were purchased from Sigma. Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was a gift from P. Janmey (Brigham's and Women's Hospital, Boston). Immunization of rabbits and collection of bleed samples was performed by ARCH (Animal Resources Children's Hospital, Boston) according to standard procedures (18Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Briefly, female New Zealand White Rabbits (5-6 pounds) purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) were injected intradermally with 250 μg of mSTI1 purified as a GST fusion protein comprising the 334 C-terminal amino acids (GST-C334 in Fig. 2). First and second boost injections were given 4 and 8 weeks after the initial injection. Blood samples were collected from the marginal ear vein, for testing samples, 10 days after injection, for production samples normally around day 14. Purification of the IgG fraction followed the low salt purification method on protein A-agarose (Boehringer Mannheim) according to Harlow and Lane (18Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Additionally antibodies specific for the GST portion of the antigen were routinely removed by adsorption to acetone powder prepared from Escherichia coli overexpressing GST (18Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Affinity purification of SF1 was performed on a CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B matrix (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to which highly purified GST-C334 was coupled. An HSP 70 specific antibody that recognizes both HSP 72 and 73, clone W27 (Oncogene, Uniondale, NY) was used in Western blot analysis. HSC 70-specific rat monoclonal antibody 1B5 (StressGen, Victoria, BC, Canada) was used for immunoprecipitation experiments. HSP 90 antibody AC88 was kindly provided by D.

Horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary rabbit and mouse specific antibodies were from Amersham Corp. Plasmids pSK1400 and pCR1300 will be described elsewhere.2 They contain as inserts the 3¹ and 5¹ ends, respectively, of the cDNA encoding mSTI1. Recombinant proteins were produced as GST fusion proteins using the pGEX3X E. coli expression vector (Pharmacia) (19Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). Plasmid pGEX3X1400 (encoding GST-C334) was constructed by ligating in the correct orientation the 1400-base pair EcoRI insert fragment of pSK1400 into EcoRI digested pGEX3X. Plasmid pGEX3X2000 (encoding the full-length fusion GST-543) was constructed by ligating the 670-base pair EcoRV-BglII fragment of pCR1300 to the 6300-base pair SmaI-BglII fragment of pGEX3X1400. Plasmids pGEX3X880 (encoding GST-302), pGEX3X700 (encoding GST-N217), pGEX3X550 (encoding GST-N174), and pGEX3X220 (encoding GST-N56) are derivatives of pGEX3X2000 in which the HindIII-NotI, BglII-NotI, SmaI-NotI, and StuI-NotI fragments, respectively, have been deleted. Recircularization of these deletion derivatives was achieved by creating blunt ends using T4 DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) followed by self-ligation. Induction of bacteria and purification of fusion proteins followed standard procedures (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994: 16.7.1-16.7.7Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were prepared on ice by washing cells with PBS before scraping them directly into buffer A (30 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.8% Nonidet P-40, 200 mM NaCl). Any nonsoluble cell debris was removed by a 20-min centrifugation at 10000 x g. Protein concentrations were determined using the Micro BCA protein assay (Pierce). SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar), Western blotting to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH) was performed according to Towbin et al. (22Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44893) Google Scholar). As a detection system for Western blot analysis, the enhanced chemiluminescence system from Amersham was used with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies. Where noted, blots were used twice with removal of previously bound antibody by incubation at 55°C for 1 h in buffer S (100 mMβ-mercaptoethanol 2% SDS, 62.5 mM Tris-Cl pH 6.7). GST fusion proteins were coupled to glutathione-agarose at 0.25 μM. Removal of unbound fusion protein by washing three times with PBS was followed by incubation of the coupled agarose-beads with 150 μg of extract proteins for 1 h at 4°C. The beads were then washed another three times with PBS to remove nonspecifically bound extract proteins. After solubilization in SDS sample buffer, proteins were usually separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. 5 x glutathione-agarose binding assays with either the GST-mSTI1 fusion protein GST-N217 (for the 70-kDa protein) or GST-C334 (for the 90-kDa protein) were performed as described above. After separating the assay proteins corresponding to 1 and 4 times the amounts of assay beads in parallel on a 10% SDS-PAGE, the gel was split, and the 1 time lane was stained as a control with Coomassie while the 4 times lane was electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. Proteins on the nitrocellulose were detected with Ponceau S and the 70- and 90-kDa protein bands were excised from the membrane. The membrane-eluted proteins were then submitted to in situ digestion with Lys-C (70 kDa) or trypsin (90 kDa), and the resulting peptide mixture was separated by HPLC using a Vydac C18 (2.1 x 150 mm) reversed-phase column on a Hewlett-Packard 1090 HPLC with a 1040 diode array detector. The sequence of selected peaks was determined by automated Edman degradation on an ABI model 477A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Strategies for peak selection, reversed-phase separation, and protein microsequencing have been described previously (23Lane W.S. Galat A. Harding M.W. Schreiber S.L. J. Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C and 10% CO2 until they reached 90% confluence. Control cells (0 min, 42°C) were collected immediately after trypsinization followed by two washes with PBS. Standard whole cell lysates were prepared using buffer A. For heat treatment, cells were transferred to an incubator at 42°C and incubated for 30, 60, and 150 min before extract preparation. Same amounts of total protein (30 μg) were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose and the immunoblot was probed with the anti-mSTI1-specific antibody SF1 before detection of the secondary horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody with Amersham's ECL system. After stripping, the nitrocellulose was reprobed with HSP 70-specific antibody W27 as a positive control. After heat shock, total cellular RNA was prepared according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar). The mRNA was prepared by passing 300 μg of total RNA through an oligo(dT) column (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Half of the mRNA for each time point was used for Northern analysis. Briefly, mRNA was resolved by 1% agarose-gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions (2.2 M formaldehyde) and blotted onto a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham) by the capillary method (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Vol. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.46-7.50Google Scholar). Northern hybridization was carried out using a 32P-labeled (Random Primed DNA labeling kit, Boehringer Mannheim) 750-base pair BglII-BstXI cDNA fragment as a probe. Before reprobing the blot with a β-actin control-probe it was stripped of the mSTI1 probe by boiling for 10 min in 0.5% SDS. The mouse β-actin probe was polymerase chain reaction amplified using the β-actin amplimer primer set from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). RNA size markers were from Promega (Madison, WI). Cell extract proteins were resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis using a modification of the procedure originally described by O'Farrell (26O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 3:1 ratio of broad (pH 3.5-10) and narrow (pH 6-8) range ampholytes was used for the separation in the first dimension. Each ampholyte used was prepared as a 1:1 mixture from two different sources (Bio-Rad and Pharmacia). Carbamylated protein standards (Pharmacia) were used in the first dimension to allow exact alignment of control and heat-treated STI1 isoforms. Casein kinase II assays were performed in a 20-μl reaction volume with the different mSTI1-GST fusion proteins at a substrate concentration of 5 μM. The casein kinase reaction buffer was supplemented with 200 μM ATP and [γ-32P]ATP to a final specific activity of 400 μCi/μmol. 100 units of casein kinase II were routinely used per reaction (7 μg/ml). Incubation was for 1 h at 30°C. The reaction tubes were then transferred on ice and 1 volume of a 50% glutathione agarose-beads suspension in PBS was added to each tube. After incubation for 10 min on ice, 1 ml of PBS was added, and the beads were collected by centrifugation. This wash step was repeated three times until there was no radioactivity detectable in the supernatant above background level. The beads were finally resuspended in 1 x Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% gel. In reactions where a possible stimulatory effect of HSP 90 on casein kinase II activity was tested, the mSTI1-GST fusion protein concentration was lowered to 2.5 μM. HSP 90 or, as a negative control, HSC 70 were used at a 100/1 ratio (w/w) with 4 μg/ml casein kinase II. Quantitation of the substrate phosphorylation was performed with a PhosphorImaging system (Molecular Dynamics) using the Image Quant program. Substrates were used in a final reaction volume of 20 μl at 2.5 μM. MAPKAP kinase 2 reaction buffer contained 50 mMβ-glycerol phosphate, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM magnesium acetate, pH 7. Reactions were supplemented with ATP at 200 μM. The specific activity of [γ-32P]ATP was 400 μCi/μmol ATP. Routinely 0.2 unit of enzyme was used in a 30-min reaction at 30°C. Substrate isolation for GST fusion proteins followed the procedure described for casein kinase II. The reactions containing HSP 25 and HSC 70 were treated differently in so far as the substrates were immunoprecipitated by adding 10 μl of antibodies SPA-801 and 1B5, respectively, followed by 20 μl of a 50% suspension of protein A- and G-agarose, respectively. 0.3 unit of pp90rsk or pp70s6k at 0.25 μM was incubated under the same assay conditions as described for the MAPKAP kinase 2 assay with the substrates at 5 μM. Isolation of the substrates followed the procedure outlined for casein kinase II. All procedures were carried out at room temperature. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with PBS, containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.25% Triton for another 15 min and then incubated with either affinity-purified SF1 antibody or unspecific rabbit IgG (Sigma) diluted in PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG was used as secondary antibody. Slides were observed using an epifluorescence microscope (Axiophot; Zeiss Inc., Oberkochen, Germany). Murine STI1 was cloned from an M27 Lewis lung cDNA expression library encoding a protein with a molecular mass of 63 kDa2 (GenBank™ accession no. U27830). A GST-STI1 fusion comprising the nucleotides corresponding to the C-terminal 334 amino acids of mSTI1 was constructed, and the resulting fusion protein (GST-C334 in Fig. 2) was used to prepare polyclonal antibody SF1 specific for mSTI1. The antibody recognizes a single protein band in the 60-kDa range in whole cell mouse extracts (for an example, see Fig. 5, panel A, lane 1) and cross-reacts with the rat and human antigen (not shown). In order to identify proteins associated with mSTI1, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using SF1 and metabolically labeled M27 cell extracts (Fig. 1). When used in low amounts SF1 precipitates the expected specific band in the 60-kDa range (lane 3) that is completely lacking in the preimmune control precipitation (lane 1). By using higher amounts of SF1 (lane 4), but not preimmune serum (lane 2), two additional specific bands coprecipitate with mSTI1, one in the 70-kDa range, the other one, which actually consists of a doublet, in the 90-kDa range. Because HSP 90 is known to run as a doublet in this size range, we performed Western blot analysis using an antibody specific for HSP 90. The identity of the 90-kDa protein with HSP 90 family members was confirmed, and subsequently the 70-kDa protein was identified in a similar way as a HSP 70 family member (data not shown).Fig. 1Complex formation of murine STI1 with a 70- and a 90-kDa protein after immunoadsorption with antibody SF1. Aliquots of M27 Lewis lung whole cell extract (150 μg), metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine/methionine were incubated for 1 h at 4°C with increasing amounts of either STI1 specific antibody SF1 (lanes 3 and 4; 5 and 15 μg, respectively) or nonimmune control serum (lanes 1 and 2; 5 and 15 μg, respectively), each coupled to protein A-agarose. The agarose-beads were then washed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and after solubilization in SDS sample buffer, proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Molecular mass markers (in kDa) indicated on the left, from top to bottom were: phosphorylase b, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The structural domains of STI1 that are responsible for the binding to HSPs 70 and 90 are currently not known. Therefore, we studied the binding behavior of the 70- and 90-kDa HSP proteins toward a set of GST-STI1 fusion proteins comprising different parts of mSTI1 (Fig. 2). Using these different fusion proteins we performed glutathione-agarose binding assays with metabolically labeled M27 Lewis lung cell extracts. Consistent with the immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 1), we found proteins of 70 and 90 kDa binding to the GST fusion protein that contained the complete mSTI1 sequence (Fig. 3, lane 5). The specificity of this binding is demonstrated by the lack of binding of the 70- and 90-kDa proteins to GST alone (Fig. 3, lane 1). Using fusion proteins representing discrete regions of the mSTI1 protein, we found differential binding of the 70- and 90-kDa proteins toward N- or C-terminal domains of mSTI1. As can be seen in the assays using the N-terminal fusion proteins GST-N217 (lane 2) or GST-N302 (lane 3), only the 70-kDa HSP and not the 90-kDa HSP bound to the N-terminal region. In contrast, the C-terminal fusion protein GST-C334 (lane 4) bound only HSP 90 and not HSP 70. The protein migrating directly below HSP 70 that binds specifically to GST-C334 and GST-543 (lanes 4 and 5) most likely represents extract endogenous mSTI1. To identify more precisely the HSPs that bind differentially to murine STI1, we obtained the partial amino acid sequence of the murine HSP 70 and HSP 90 family members. Specifically, we isolated the HSP molecules from M27 Lewis lung carcinoma cell extracts, using the glutathione-agarose binding assay with the fusion protein GST-N217 as a target for the HSP 70 molecule and the fusion protein GST-C334 for the HSP 90 member. After isolation of the HSP molecules, the peptide sequences were obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures” and compared to known data base sequences with the help of the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) sequence analysis software package (27Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2042891307,"Fatty acids are important metabolic substrates for the pancreatic β-cell, and long term exposure of pancreatic islets to elevated concentrations of fatty acids results in an alteration of glucose-induced insulin secretion. Previous work suggested that exaggerated fatty acid oxidation may be implicated in this process by a mechanism requiring changes in metabolic enzyme expression. We have therefore studied the regulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) gene expression by fatty acids in the pancreatic β-cell line INS-1 since this enzyme catalyzes the limiting step of fatty acid oxidation in various tissues. Palmitate, oleate, and linoleate (0.35 mM) elicited a 4-6-fold increase in CPT I mRNA. The effect was dose-dependent and was similar for saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. It was detectable after 1 h and reached a maximum after 3 h. The induction of CPT I mRNA by fatty acids did not require their oxidation, and 2-bromopalmitate, a nonoxidizable fatty acid, increased CPT I mRNA to the same extent as palmitate. The induction was not prevented by cycloheximide treatment of cells indicating that it was mediated by pre-existing transcription factors. Neither glucose nor pyruvate and various secretagogues had a significant effect except glutamine (7 mM) which slightly induced CPT I mRNA. The half-life of the CPT I transcript was unchanged by fatty acids, and nuclear run-on analysis showed a rapid (less than 45 min) and pronounced transcriptional activation of the CPT I gene by fatty acids. The increase in CPT I mRNA was followed by a 2-3-fold increase in CPT I enzymatic activity measured in isolated mitochondria. The increase in activity was time-dependent, detectable after 4 h, and close to maximal after 24 h. Fatty acid oxidation by INS-1 cells, measured at low glucose, was also 2-3-fold higher in cells cultured with fatty acid in comparison with control cells. Long term exposure of INS-1 cells to fatty acid was associated with elevated secretion of insulin at a low (5 mM) concentration of glucose and a decreased effect of higher glucose concentrations. It also resulted in a decreased oxidation of glucose. The results indicate that the CPT I gene is an early response gene induced by fatty acids at the transcriptional level in β- (INS-1) cells.

INTRODUCTIONFolates function as a family of cofactors by carrying one-carbon units that are required for the synthesis of glycine, thymidylate, purines, methionine, and numerous methylation reactions in mammalian cells. Serine is the major source of one-carbon units that are generated in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). 1The abbreviations used are: SHMTserine hydroxymethyltransferasemSHMTmitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferasecSHMTcytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferasekbkilobasebpbase pairntnucleotideH4PteGlutetrahydrofolate5,10-CH2-H4PteGlumethylenetetrahydrofolateCHOChinese hamster ovary cellsGlyAChinese hamster ovary cells deficient in mSHMT activityWTT2wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cellsdFBSdialyzed fetal bovine serumRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsRT-PCRreverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Alternatively, one-carbon units can also be generated from glycine in cells that contain a glycine cleavage activity. SHMT is a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the reversible interconversion of serine and H4PteGlu to glycine and 5,10-CH2-H4PteGlu. SHMT is present in both the mitochondria (mSHMT) and the cytoplasm (cSHMT) in mammalian cells. The human SHMT cDNAs encoding the two isozymes have been isolated and the genes localized to chromosomes 12q13 and 17p11.2, respectively (1Garrow T.A. Brenner A.A. Whitehead V.M. Chen X.-N. Duncan R.G. Korenberg J.R. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11910-11916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Currently, the metabolic role of the individual SHMT isozymes is not clearly understood. Chinese hamster ovary cells lacking mSHMT activity are auxotrophic for glycine, suggesting that the mitochondria are the primary site of glycine synthesis, whereas the enzymes responsible for thymidylate, purine, and methionine synthesis are present in the cytoplasm (2Pfendner W. Pizer L.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 200: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The central role of SHMT isozymes in producing one-carbon-substituted folate cofactors has suggested that the regulation of these enzymes may influence cell growth and proliferation and that they may be targets for the development of antineoplastic agents.Total SHMT activity and the concentration and metabolism of serine and glycine varies among tissues, reflecting the different roles of these amino acids in different organs (3Snell K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1983; 22: 325-400Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This effect is most pronounced in the brain, where it has been demonstrated that there is a direct correlation between SHMT activity and glycine concentration in different regions of rat brain (4Dasgupta P. Narayanaswami A. J. Neurochem. 1982; 39: 743-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). SHMT activity may also be developmentally regulated as SHMT-specific activity is 2-fold higher in the the optical lobe of the rhesus monkey neonate and adult compared with the fetus (5Rassin D.K. Sturman J.A. Gaull G.E. J. Neurochem. 1981; 36: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). There is evidence that SHMT is hormonally regulated as SHMT activity is elevated in the uterus after injection of 17β-estradiol to ovariectomized rats, with a 6-fold acceleration of [3-14C]serine incorporation into purines, whereas testosterone increases the specific activity of SHMT in the prostate (6Sanborn T.A. Kowle R.L. Sallach H.J. Endocrinology. 1975; 97: 1000-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). SHMT may also be controlled by nutrient availability as SHMT activity is increased 50% in folate-deficient versus folate-supplemented chickens (7Burns R.A. Jackson N. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1982; 71B: 351-355Google Scholar). Total SHMT enzyme activity has also been demonstrated to be increased in tumor cells (8Snell K. Natsumeda Y. Eble J.N. Glover J.L. Weber G. Br. J. Cancer. 1988; 57: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Several studies have suggested that mSHMT is primarily responsible for glycine synthesis in the cell (2Pfendner W. Pizer L.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 200: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9Narkewicz M.R. Sauls S.D. Tjoa S.S. Fennessey P.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 991-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Revertants of mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that lack mSHMT activity showed a correlation between SHMT levels, intracellular glycine concentrations, and protein synthesis rates (2Pfendner W. Pizer L.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 200: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). While SHMT enzyme activity and one-carbon flux display both developmental, nutritional, and tissue-specific regulation, the metabolic significance of these changes has been difficult to interpret as most of these studies have been performed with crude homogenates that did not distinguish between mitochondrial and cytoplasmic SHMT activities. In order to better understand the differential metabolic roles of the SHMT isozymes, we have cloned and structurally characterized the human mSHMT gene and have commenced studies to determine the factors responsible for regulating its endogenous expression.DISCUSSIONThe differential metabolic role of the two SHMT isozymes in folate-dependent anabolic pathways is not understood, but mSHMT activity has been suggested to be the primary source of intracellular glycine (2Pfendner W. Pizer L.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 200: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9Narkewicz M.R. Sauls S.D. Tjoa S.S. Fennessey P.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 991-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In order to understand the differential metabolic roles of the SHMT isozymes, we have cloned the mSHMT gene and initiated studies to determine the factors and mechanisms that cells use to regulate the endogenous expression of the gene. Recent studies have demonstrated that elimination of mitochondrial folate pools in CHO cells results in a glycine auxotrophy (27Lin B.-F. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9705-9713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Chen L. Qi H. Korenberg J. Garrow T.A. Choi Y.-J. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13077-13087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and that CHO cell glycine auxotrophs lacking mSHMT activity have an elevated intracellular serine concentration but are not able to accumulate intracellular glycine (9Narkewicz M.R. Sauls S.D. Tjoa S.S. Fennessey P.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 991-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These data suggest that mSHMT is primarily responsible for glycine synthesis and that cSHMT is not effective in catalyzing the formation of glycine from serine even in the presence of elevated serine concentrations (9Narkewicz M.R. Sauls S.D. Tjoa S.S. Fennessey P.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 991-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the possibility that the cell lines had additional mutations that may have been responsible for the observed metabolic disturbances could not be eliminated. Our results confirm that GlyA cells also contain very low levels of intracellular glycine despite the high accumulation of intracellular serine and the presence of cSHMT activity. In addition, we have shown that increasing the mSHMT activity in GlyA cells overcomes the glycine auxotrophy, thereby demonstrating that mSHMT deficiency alone is responsible for the glycine auxotrophy associated with GlyA cells.Expression of the partial human mSHMT gene in GlyA cells resulted in only modest increases in mSHMT activity, representing less than 5% of total WTT2 cell mSHMT activity, despite expression of high levels of human mSHMT mRNA in the GlyA-human-mSHMT cells. We conclude that exon 1 of the mSHMT gene is not essential for mSHMT activity or mitochondrial import. These data also suggest that mSHMT activity can be inhibited greater than 95% in CHO cells without inducing a glycine auxotrophy or affecting intracellular glycine levels, although serine levels were still elevated.It has been suggested that the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic SHMT isozymes function cooperatively in shuttling one-carbon units between the cytoplasm and mitochondria analogous to the shuttling of reducing equivalents that occurs in the malate-aspartate shuttle (29Appling D.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Studies of the regulatory regions of the aspartate aminotransferase genes demonstrated that the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic isozymes do not share common promoter elements (30Setoyama C. Ding S.-H. Choudhury B.K. Joh T. Takeshima H. Tsuzuki T. Shimada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1293-1299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the two genes are regulated independently. Previous studies have demonstrated that the relative ratio of SHMT in the cytoplasm and mitochondria varies among cell and tissues, suggesting that the SHMT genes are also regulated independently. While mSHMT is found in all cell types, it is enriched in certain tissues, including the kidney and liver. Analysis of the human mSHMT 5¹ promoter region suggests that it is a housekeeping gene with multiple transcriptional initiation sites, but it also contains a CCCTCCC element that is present in many genes that are expressed predominantly in the liver (24Magnuson M.A. Andreone T.L. Printz R.L. Koch S. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4838-4844Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) including the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. It is also of interest that the 5¹ promoter region contains a zeste-white element that may be responsible for the observed developmental variations in SHMT activity and serine metabolism (3Snell K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1983; 22: 325-400Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that mSHMT message levels do not change throughout the cell cycle in MCF-7 cells, consistent with similar observation for the yeast mSHMT message levels (31McNeil J.B. McIntosh E.M. Taylor B.V. Zang F. Tang S. Bognar A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9155-9165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, no evidence for changes in mSHMT mRNA levels in MCF-7 cells were observed during folate, purine, thymidine, or methionine deprivation. Continuing studies will elucidate the contribution of the mSHMT promoter elements to mSHMT expression and their influence on glycine and folic acid metabolism.Intron 1 appears to contain consensus regulatory elements capable of expressing the mSHMT gene. Analysis of the mitochondrial import peptide suggests that exon 1 contains most of the hydrophobic and basic amino acid residues that may be required for efficient mitochondrial protein import but are not essential. Expression of the human mSHMT lacking exon 1 did not result in measurable increases in SHMT activity in the cytoplasm. The low level of mSHMT activity resulting from the expression of the human mSHMT gene lacking exon 1 in the GlyA transfectants is most probably due to either inefficient translation from the translation initiation site located in exon 2 or rapid turnover of the mSHMT protein in the cytoplasm prior to mitochondrial import due to its shortened import presequence. In light of these observations, we are currently investigating the stability of the mSHMT protein in the cytoplasm and the amino acid residues that are essential for mitochondrial import, and we are determining whether the putative promoter elements present in intron 1 are capable of expressing reporter genes in human cells. INTRODUCTIONFolates function as a family of cofactors by carrying one-carbon units that are required for the synthesis of glycine, thymidylate, purines, methionine, and numerous methylation reactions in mammalian cells. Serine is the major source of one-carbon units that are generated in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). 1The abbreviations used are: SHMTserine hydroxymethyltransferasemSHMTmitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferasecSHMTcytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferasekbkilobasebpbase pairntnucleotideH4PteGlutetrahydrofolate5,10-CH2-H4PteGlumethylenetetrahydrofolateCHOChinese hamster ovary cellsGlyAChinese hamster ovary cells deficient in mSHMT activityWTT2wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cellsdFBSdialyzed fetal bovine serumRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsRT-PCRreverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Alternatively, one-carbon units can also be generated from glycine in cells that contain a glycine cleavage activity. SHMT is a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the reversible interconversion of serine and H4PteGlu to glycine and 5,10-CH2-H4PteGlu. SHMT is present in both the mitochondria (mSHMT) and the cytoplasm (cSHMT) in mammalian cells. The human SHMT cDNAs encoding the two isozymes have been isolated and the genes localized to chromosomes 12q13 and 17p11.2, respectively (1Garrow T.A. Brenner A.A. Whitehead V.M. Chen X.-N. Duncan R.G. Korenberg J.R. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11910-11916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Currently, the metabolic role of the individual SHMT isozymes is not clearly understood. Chinese hamster ovary cells lacking mSHMT activity are auxotrophic for glycine, suggesting that the mitochondria are the primary site of glycine synthesis, whereas the enzymes responsible for thymidylate, purine, and methionine synthesis are present in the cytoplasm (2Pfendner W. Pizer L.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 200: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The central role of SHMT isozymes in producing one-carbon-substituted folate cofactors has suggested that the regulation of these enzymes may influence cell growth and proliferation and that they may be targets for the development of antineoplastic agents.Total SHMT activity and the concentration and metabolism of serine and glycine varies among tissues, reflecting the different roles of these amino acids in different organs (3Snell K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1983; 22: 325-400Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This effect is most pronounced in the brain, where it has been demonstrated that there is a direct correlation between SHMT activity and glycine concentration in different regions of rat brain (4Dasgupta P. Narayanaswami A. J. Neurochem. 1982; 39: 743-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). SHMT activity may also be developmentally regulated as SHMT-specific activity is 2-fold higher in the the optical lobe of the rhesus monkey neonate and adult compared with the fetus (5Rassin D.K. Sturman J.A. Gaull G.E. J. Neurochem. 1981; 36: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). There is evidence that SHMT is hormonally regulated as SHMT activity is elevated in the uterus after injection of 17β-estradiol to ovariectomized rats, with a 6-fold acceleration of [3-14C]serine incorporation into purines, whereas testosterone increases the specific activity of SHMT in the prostate (6Sanborn T.A. Kowle R.L. Sallach H.J. Endocrinology. 1975; 97: 1000-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). SHMT may also be controlled by nutrient availability as SHMT activity is increased 50% in folate-deficient versus folate-supplemented chickens (7Burns R.A. Jackson N. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1982; 71B: 351-355Google Scholar). Total SHMT enzyme activity has also been demonstrated to be increased in tumor cells (8Snell K. Natsumeda Y. Eble J.N. Glover J.L. Weber G. Br. J. Cancer. 1988; 57: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Several studies have suggested that mSHMT is primarily responsible for glycine synthesis in the cell (2Pfendner W. Pizer L.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 200: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9Narkewicz M.R. Sauls S.D. Tjoa S.S. Fennessey P.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 991-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Revertants of mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that lack mSHMT activity showed a correlation between SHMT levels, intracellular glycine concentrations, and protein synthesis rates (2Pfendner W. Pizer L.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 200: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). While SHMT enzyme activity and one-carbon flux display both developmental, nutritional, and tissue-specific regulation, the metabolic significance of these changes has been difficult to interpret as most of these studies have been performed with crude homogenates that did not distinguish between mitochondrial and cytoplasmic SHMT activities. In order to better understand the differential metabolic roles of the SHMT isozymes, we have cloned and structurally characterized the human mSHMT gene and have commenced studies to determine the factors responsible for regulating its endogenous expression.

DISCUSSIONThe differential metabolic role of the two SHMT isozymes in folate-dependent anabolic pathways is not understood, but mSHMT activity has been suggested to be the primary source of intracellular glycine (2Pfendner W.

In order to understand the differential metabolic roles of the SHMT isozymes, we have cloned the mSHMT gene and initiated studies to determine the factors and mechanisms that cells use to regulate the endogenous expression of the gene. Recent studies have demonstrated that elimination of mitochondrial folate pools in CHO cells results in a glycine auxotrophy (27Lin B.-F. Shane B. J. Biol.

Sauls S.D. Tjoa S.S. Fennessey P.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 991-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These data suggest that mSHMT is primarily responsible for glycine synthesis and that cSHMT is not effective in catalyzing the formation of glycine from serine even in the presence of elevated serine concentrations (9Narkewicz M.R. Sauls S.D. Tjoa S.S. Fennessey P.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 991-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the possibility that the cell lines had additional mutations that may have been responsible for the observed metabolic disturbances could not be eliminated. Our results confirm that GlyA cells also contain very low levels of intracellular glycine despite the high accumulation of intracellular serine and the presence of cSHMT activity. In addition, we have shown that increasing the mSHMT activity in GlyA cells overcomes the glycine auxotrophy, thereby demonstrating that mSHMT deficiency alone is responsible for the glycine auxotrophy associated with GlyA cells.Expression of the partial human mSHMT gene in GlyA cells resulted in only modest increases in mSHMT activity, representing less than 5% of total WTT2 cell mSHMT activity, despite expression of high levels of human mSHMT mRNA in the GlyA-human-mSHMT cells.

In human platelets, calpain activation is dependent on fibrinogen binding to integrin αIIbβ3 and subsequent platelet aggregation, suggesting a potential role for this protease in the regulation of postaggregation responses. In this study, we have examined the effects of calpain activation on several postaggregation events in human platelets, including the cytoskeletal attachment of integrin αIIbβ3, the tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins, and the cellular retraction of fibrin clots. We demonstrate that calpain activation in either washed platelets or platelet-rich plasma is associated with a marked reduction in platelet-mediated fibrin clot retraction. This relaxation of clot retraction was observed in both thrombin and ionophore A23187-stimulated platelets. Calcium dose-response studies (extracellular calcium concentrations between 0.1 μM and 1 M) revealed a strong correlation between calpain activation and relaxed clot retraction. Furthermore, pretreating platelets with the calpain inhibitors calpeptin and calpain inhibitor I prevented the calpain-mediated reduction in clot retraction. Relaxed fibrin clot retraction was associated with the cleavage of several platelet focal adhesion structural proteins and signaling enzymes, resulting in the dissociation of talin, pp60c-src, and integrin αIIbβ3 from the contractile cytoskeleton and the tyrosine dephosphorylation of multiple cytoskeletal proteins. These studies suggest an important role for calpain in the regulation of multiple postaggregation events in human platelets. The ability of calpain to inhibit clot retraction is likely to be due to the cleavage of both structural and signaling proteins involved in modulating integrin-cytoskeletal interactions.

https://openalex.org/W1964579574,"The lipocalins make up a heterogeneous superfamily of proteins. Although showing almost no sequence homology, they share very similar secondary and tertiary structures. Their ability to bind hydrophobic ligands is well established, but the physiological function of most lipocalins remains unclear. The lipocalin from the human Von Ebner's Gland of the tongue (VEGh) contains three sequence motifs corresponding with the papain-binding domains of cystatins, a family of naturally occurring cysteine proteinase inhibitors. We found that VEGh inhibited papain activity to a similar extent as salivary cystatin S. Furthermore, synthetic peptides derived from VEGh and cystatin C, comprising these three motifs, inhibited papain, too. We conclude that VEGh is a physiological inhibitor of cysteine proteinases and therefore can play a role in the control of inflammatory processes in oral and ocular tissues. The lipocalins make up a heterogeneous superfamily of proteins. Although showing almost no sequence homology, they share very similar secondary and tertiary structures. Their ability to bind hydrophobic ligands is well established, but the physiological function of most lipocalins remains unclear.

Previous work in our laboratories resulted in the purification of arginine- and lysine-specific cysteine proteinases, designated gingipains, that consist of several tightly associated protein subunits. Recent characterization of arginine-specific gingipain-1 (gingipain R1; RGP-1) revealed that the sequence is unique and that the protein subunits are initially translated as a polyprotein encoding a proteinase domain and multiple adhesin domains (Pavloff, N., Potempa, J., Pike, R. N., Prochazka, V., Kiefer, M. C., Travis, J., and Barr, P. J. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 1007-1010).We now show that the lysine-specific gingipain (gingipain K; KGP) is also biosynthesized as a polyprotein precursor that contains a proteinase domain that is 22% homologous to the proteinase domain of RGP-1 and multiple adhesin domains. This precursor is similarly processed at distinct sites to yield active KGP. The key catalytic residues in the proteinase domain of KGP are identical to those found in RGP-1, but there are significant differences elsewhere within this domain that likely contribute to the altered substrate specificity of KGP. Independent expression of the proteinase domain in insect cells has shown that KGP does not require the presence of the adhesin domains for correct folding to confer proteolytic activity.

https://openalex.org/W2024410294,"The first type III module of fibronectin (Fn) contains a cryptic site that binds Fn and its N-terminal 29 kDa fragment and is thought to be important for fibril formation (Morla, A., Zhang, Z., and Ruoslahti, E. (1994) Nature 367, 193-196; Hocking, D. C., Sottile, J., and McKeown-Longo, P. J. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 19183-19191). A synthetic 31-mer peptide (NAPQ … TIPG) derived from the middle of domain III1 was also shown to bind Fn, but the site of its interaction was not determined (Morla, A., and Ruoslahti, E. (1992) J. Cell Biol. 118, 421-429). By affinity chromatography on peptide-agarose, we tested a set of fragments representing the entire light chain of plasma Fn. Only 40-kDa Hep-2 (III12-15) failed to bind. The concentration of urea required for peak elution of Fn and the other fragments decreased in the order Fn > 42-kDa GBF (I6II1-2I7-9) > 19-kDa Fib-2 (I10-12) > 110-kDa CBF(III2-10) > 29-kDa Fib-1 (I1-I5). Neither Fn nor any of the fragments bound immobilized intact III1, confirming the cryptic nature of this activity. In an effort to detect interactions between other Fn domains, all fragments were coupled to Sepharose, and each fragment was tested on each affinity matrix before and after denaturation. The only interaction detected was that of fluid phase III1 with immobilized denatured 110-kDa CBF and 40-kDa Hep-2, both of which contain type III domains. Analysis of subfragments revealed this activity to be dominated by domains III7 and III15. Fn itself did not bind to the denatured fragments. Thus, domain III1 contains two cryptic “self-association sites,” one that is buried in the core of the fold but recognizes many Fn fragments when presented as a peptide and another that is concealed in Fn but exposed in the native isolated domain and recognizes cryptic sites in two other type III domains. These interactions between type III domains could play an important role in assembly of Fn multimers in the extracellular matrix.

https://openalex.org/W1981116772,"Cysteine residues were found nonessential in the mechanism of the NhaA antiporter activity of Escherichia coli. The functional C-less NhaA has provided the groundwork to study further histidine 225 of NhaA which has previously been suggested to play an important role in the activation of NhaA at alkaline pH (Rimon, A., Gerchman, Y., Olami, Y., Schuldiner, S. and Padan, E. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 26813-26817). C-less H225C was constructed and shown to possess an antiporter activity 60% of that of C-less antiporter and a pH profile similar to that of both the C-less or wild-type antiporters. Remarkably, whereas neither the wild-type nor the C-less antiporters were affected by N-ethylmaleimide, C-less H225C was inhibited by this reagent. To determine the degree of alkylation of the antiporter protein by N-ethylmaleimide, antiporter derivatives tagged at their C termini with six histidines residues were constructed. Alkylation of C-less H225C was measured by labeling of everted membrane vesicles with [14C]N-ethylmaleimide, affinity purification of the His-tagged antiporter, and determination of the radioactivity of the purified protein. This assay showed that H225C is alkylated to a much higher level than any of the native cysteinyl residues of NhaA reaching saturation at alkyl/NhaA stoichiometry of 1. The wild-type derivative showed at least 10-fold less alkylation even at higher concentrations, suggesting that H225C resides in a domain that is much more exposed to N-ethylmaleimide than the native cysteinyl residues of NhaA. Since H225C residues both in right-side out and inside-out membrane vesicles were quantitatively alkylated by N-ethylmaleimide, this assay was used to determine the accessibility of H225C to other SH reagents by titrating the H225C left free to react with N-ethylmaleimide, following exposure of the membranes to the reagents. Furthermore, since membrane-impermeant probes can react with residues in membrane-embedded protein only if accessible to the medium containing the reagent, the assay was used to determine the membrane topology of H225C. As expected for a membrane-permeant probe, p-chloromercuribenzoate reacted with H225C as efficiently as N-ethylmaleimide in both membrane orientations. Similar results were obtained with methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium supporting the recent observations that this probe is membrane-permeant. On the other hand, both membrane-impermeant reagents p-chloromercuribenzosulfonate and methanethiosulfonate ethyl-trimethyl ammonium bromide reacted with H225C 10-fold more in right-side out than in inside-out vesicles, and p-chloromercuribenzosulfonate also blocked completely the H225C in intact cells. These results strongly suggest that H225C is exposed at the periplasmic face of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1967941369,"The alga Dunaliella salina is outstanding is its ability to withstand extremely high salinities. To uncover mechanisms underlying salt tolerance, a search was carried out for salt-induced proteins. The level of a plasma membrane 150-kDa protein, p150, was found to increase with rising external salinity (Sadka, A., Himmelhoch, S., and Zamir, A. (1991) Plant Physiol. 95, 822-831). Based on its cDNA-deduced sequence, p150 belongs to the transferrin family of proteins so far identified only in animals. This, to our best knowledge, is the first demonstration of a transferrin-like protein in a photosynthetic organism. Unlike animal transferrins, p150 contains three, rather than two, internal repeats and a COOH-terminal extension including an acidic amino acid cluster. In intact cells p150 is degraded by Pronase, indicating that the protein is extracellularly exposed. The relationship of p150 to iron uptake is supported by the induction of the protein in iron-deficient media and by its radioactive labeling in cells grown with 59Fe. Accumulation of p150 is transcriptionally regulated. It is proposed that p150 acts in iron uptake other than by receptor-mediated endocytosis and that its induction permits the cells to overcome a possible limitation in iron availability under high salinities.

Accumulation of p150 is transcriptionally regulated. It is proposed that p150 acts in iron uptake other than by receptor-mediated endocytosis and that its induction permits the cells to overcome a possible limitation in iron availability under high salinities. An exceptionally interesting model to uncover mechanisms conferring salt tolerance to photosynthetic organisms is provided by the unicellular green algae Dunaliella. Algae belonging to this genus are remarkable in their ability to proliferate in salinities as high as saturating NaCl concentrations. Within a broad range of external salinities, the algae maintain a relatively low internal salt concentration (1Pick U. Karni A. Avron M. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 92-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and balance the external osmotic pressure by accumulating iso-osmotic levels of glycerol (2Avron M. Trends Biochem. 1986; 11: 5-6Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although glycerol-mediated osmotic adjustment is a necessary element in the salt tolerance of Dunaliella, it is reasonably insufficient to permit growth in high salinities. To unravel additional mechanisms contributing to salt tolerance it was postulated that participating components might be specifically induced under high salt. Accordingly, screens were performed for proteins preferentially accumulating in high salt-grown cells (3Sadka A. Himmelhoch S. Zamir A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 822-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 4Fisher M. Pick U. Zamir A. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1359-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Following this approach, a protein of 150 kDa, p150, was observed to rise markedly with an increase in external salinity. Furthermore, in cells transferred from low to high salt, an increase in p150 roughly coincided with resumption of cell division following the hyperosmotic shock (3Sadka A. Himmelhoch S. Zamir A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 822-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The protein was characterized biochemically and by immunoelectron microscopy as a major plasma membrane component and was accordingly postulated to be involved in the control of salt or nutrient fluxes across the cell membrane (3Sadka A. Himmelhoch S. Zamir A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 822-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Evidently, structural and functional characterization of p150 could provide important new insights concerning the nature of factors limiting growth in high salinities as well as the mechanisms that evolved to counteract these limitations. We now show that p150 is a unique new member of the transferrin family of proteins which, to the best of our knowledge, has been identified so far only in animals (5Aisen P. Listowsky I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 357-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 6Baker E.N. Rumball S.V. Anderson B.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 350-353Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 7Thorstenden K. Romslo I. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The transferrin family includes mainly iron-binding proteins found in serum and other body fluids that perform essential roles in iron binding and transport. All members of the transferrin family characterized to date are typically composed of two homologous halves, and most are not membrane-associated. The membrane-associated p150 is distinctly different in encompassing three, rather than two, internal repeats. The involvement of p150 in iron uptake is suggested by its induction under iron limitation and supported by 59Fe labeling of the protein. Thus, transferrin-homologous proteins have probably evolved far earlier than thought so far to function in the uptake of iron, or other nutrients, by unicellular eukaryotes. The source of Dunaliella salina, the method used to obtain axenic cultures, the medium composition, and growth conditions were essentially as described (4Fisher M. Pick U. Zamir A.

Synthesis of cDNA, using 3 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA, was by the ZAP-cDNA Synthesis Kit (Stratagene). Cloning in the λ Uni-ZAP XR vector used the Stratagene cloning kit. The original library contained 7 × 105 plaque-forming units. An amplified library was screened with anti-p150 antibodies (3Sadka A. Himmelhoch S. Zamir A.

Positive clones were processed further to rescue the corresponding recombinant plasmids. Phage-rescued plasmids were subjected to DNA sequencing analysis by the dideoxy sequencing method in the Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer. Fifteen μg of total RNA extracted as described above was analyzed on each lane of a formaldehyde agarose gel (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Zamir A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 822-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The band containing p150 was excised from the preparative gel and transferred to an SDS-containing 10-20% polyacrylamide gradient gel in the presence of 2 μg of Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease/lane (11Cleveland D.W.

After 2 days growth under standard conditions, the cells were harvested, plasma membranes were isolated as described (4Fisher M. Pick U. Zamir A.

Aliquots containing 25 μg of protein were resolved by nondenaturing electrophoresis on a 4-10% polyacrylamide gradient gel with a 3% polyacrylamide stacking gel. After blotting onto nitrocellulose, radioactivity was monitored by a PhosphorImager. A parallel lane was cut out from the nondenaturing gel and subjected to a second dimension electrophoresis under denaturing conditions (13Govezensky D. Zamir A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5729-5735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were localized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. A cDNA expression library was constructed in the λ Zap vector using D. salina poly(A)+ mRNA isolated 9 h after the cells had been subjected to a hyperosmotic shock. The cDNA library was screened with anti-p150 polyclonal antibodies. Several cross-reacting phages were found to contain cDNA inserts of ∼4.4 kilobases. Sequence determination of the cloned cDNA indicated that it included a 3.822-kilobase open reading frame encoding a 1,274-amino acid polypeptide, flanked on its 5′ end by 36 base pairs and on its 3′ end by 485 base pairs attached to a poly(A) tail (Fig. 1). To confirm that the cloned cDNA encoded for p150, the predicted amino acid sequence was compared with several sequences determined for undigested p150 and two protease V8 digestion products. All of the directly determined amino acid sequences were identified in the sequence predicted from the isolated cDNA. However, the sequence reported previously as corresponding to the NH2 terminus of the intact p150 (3Sadka A. Himmelhoch S. Zamir A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 822-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was not found at the expected site, but rather close to the carboxyl terminus of the protein. The most plausible explanation for this discrepancy is that the NH2 terminus of the intact protein is blocked and that the sequence determined previously is of a small COOH-terminal peptide. This peptide is generated by proteolytic cleavage occurring after the intact protein had been isolated by SDS-PAGE. The likelihood of such a cleavage is supported by the occasional appearance of a polypeptide somewhat shorter than p150 in purified p150 preparations after storage (3Sadka A. Himmelhoch S. Zamir A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 822-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The small COOH-terminal peptide remains undetected in this analysis. The ATG assigned as the initiation codon is the most upstream in the cDNA, is in frame with the following open reading frame, and together with flanking nucleotides conforms to the core consensus sequence for translation initiation in plants (14Lutcke H.A. Chow K.C. Mickel F.S. Moss K.A. Kern H.F. Scheele G.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 15Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8135-8148Crossref Scopus (4148) Google Scholar). For reasons explained below, the Gly numbered +1 (Fig. 1) was designated as the NH2-terminal residue of the mature protein. According to this assignment, the 17 mainly hydrophobic amino acid residues at the NH2 terminus probably constitute the leader peptide responsible for the ultimate direction of the protein to the plasma membrane. The predicted amino acid sequence of p150 (Fig. 2) includes three internally homologous segments ranging in length from approximately 350 to 400 amino acid residues. The NH2-terminal (α1) and central (α2) repeats are ∼64% identical, whereas the COOH-terminal repeat (β) shows ∼28% identity to either the α1 or α2 repeats. Although it is not possible to establish definitively the boundaries of the three repeats, it is clear that they are separated by relatively short connecting sequences. Particularly striking is the peptide connecting α2 with β which includes four consecutive Asn residues. The unique ∼100-amino acid COOH-terminal sequence is outstanding in containing a dense cluster of acidic residues which is followed by a relatively hydrophobic sequence. Data base searches revealed a clear homology between the repeated units in p150 and transferrins, a family of proteins so far identified only in animals (Fig. 3). The functionally best characterized members of this family are the serum transferrins, major iron-binding proteins of ∼80 kDa, which are essential for iron delivery to different types of cells (16Baldwin G.S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 106B: 203-218Google Scholar). The serum ferritransferrin is internalized by target cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis and releases its bound iron after the internal pH of the vesicles turns acidic (7Thorstenden K. Romslo I. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Other transferrins include lactoferrin, ovotransferrin, and melanotransferrin, p97. The last is a membrane-anchored transferrin of 97 kDa, first identified on the surface of human melanoma cells (17Brown J.P. Hewick R.M. Hellstrom I. Hellstrom K.E. Doolittle R.F. Dryer W.J. Nature. 1982; 296: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Transferrins and related proteins are composed of two homologous halves, each similar in length to the repeat unit in p150 (16Baldwin G.S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 106B: 203-218Google Scholar). The internally duplicated sequence is reflected in the three-dimensional structure, which is composed of two similar lobes as determined for human lactoferrin (18Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. Norris G.E. Rice D.W. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 711-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) and rabbit serum transferrin (19Bailey S. Evans R.W. Garrat R.C. Gorinsky B. Hasnain S. Horsburgh C. Jhoti H. Lindley P.F. Mydin A. Sarra R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5804-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In these proteins each lobe bound a single Fe3+ cation synergistically with a single HCO3− (or CO3−2) anion. The assignment of the NH2-terminal residue of the mature p150 (Gly-1, Fig. 1, Fig. 2) is based on sequence resemblance to the human lactoferrin. In lactoferrin, a Gly residue, immediately preceded by an Ala (in the nascent protein) located 9 residues NH2-terminal to the first conserved Cys, was identified as the NH2-terminal residue of the mature protein (16Baldwin G.S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 106B: 203-218Google Scholar). In other instances, NH2 termini of mature transferrins were found 7-8 residues NH2-terminal to the first conserved Cys residue. To permit alignment with animal transferrins (Fig. 3), the α1 repeat of p150 was omitted and the alignment was started with the α2 repeat. The juxtaposition of the α2 and β repeats with the NH2 and COOH halves of the transferrins shows that the α repeats include several insertions with respect to the NH2 halves of the transferrins. The β repeat is closer in size to the COOH halves of animal transferrins but still contains a 12-residue insertion as well as several shorter insertions. The amino acid residues identified as iron ligands in rabbit serum transferrin and human lactoferrin (numbering as in the human lactoferrin, Fig. 3) are Asp-60, Tyr-92, Tyr-192, and His-253 in the NH2 lobe and Asp-395, Tyr-435, Tyr-528, and His-597 in the COOH lobe. In p150, all three repeats contain a Gly instead of Asp-60, the two Tyr residues are conserved, and the His is replaced by Asn in α1 and α2 and by Gln in β. Residues involved in HCO3−1 (CO3−2) binding in the NH2 and COOH lobes of animal transferrins are Arg-121 and Arg-465, respectively. In all three repeats of p150 these Arg residues are replaced by Lys, which, interestingly, is invariably preceded by an Arg residue. In addition to iron and anion liganding residues, transferrins characteristically contain conserved Cys residues involved in disulfide bond formation (16Baldwin G.S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 106B: 203-218Google Scholar). Of the 11 Cys residues conserved between the NH2 halves of the transferrins shown (Fig. 3) 10 are conserved in the α repeats of p150. Of the 14 Cys residues conserved in the COOH halves, 12 are conserved in the β repeat of p150. Altogether, p150 retains many of the structural features characteristic of animal transferrins. Northern blot hybridization was used to assess whether p150 induction following a hyperosmotic shock involved gene activation. The analysis for p150 transcripts was conducted in parallel to immunoblot analysis for p150 antigens. The results (Fig. 4) indicate that the p150 transcript level rises coordinately with the level of the protein. Hence, p150 accumulation appears to be transcriptionally regulated. Because p150 was originally found to be induced in high salinities, the possibility was considered that such conditions imposed an iron limitation on the cells which could be compensated by p150 overproduction. One could therefore expect that p150 may be induced by iron limitation per se, even in relatively low NaCl concentrations. To examine this possibility, cells growing in complete medium containing 0.5 M NaCl were resuspended in a medium without added iron (concentration of iron introduced as a contaminant of the salts used to prepare the medium was less than 0.5 μM). In a medium buffered at pH 7.4, a considerable increase in p150 was already noticed 8 h after transfer to the new medium, and by 24 h the level of p150 increased severalfold over its initial level. No induction of p150 was observed in cells incubated in the same medium but with added iron (Fig. 5). To examine the extracellular exposure of p150, Pronase digestion was conducted with cells grown in 0.5 M NaCl (Fig. 6A). Although the level of the protein is relatively low in this salt concentration (3Sadka A. Himmelhoch S. Zamir A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 822-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), it was still easily detectable in the immunoblot analysis. The results indicate that p150 is degraded in intact cells treated with Pronase, the extent of digestion depending on the enzyme concentration. Microscopic examination indicated that Pronase digestion did not cause cell lysis. To explore the possibility that the function of p150 involved iron binding, algal cells were grown for several generations in the presence of 59Fe. A plasma membrane fraction isolated from these cells was solubilized with Triton X-100, and the proteins were resolved by nondenaturing PAGE. The position of p150 was first established by parallel immunoblot analysis with anti-p150 antibodies (not shown). The electrophoretic mobility of p150 in the nondenaturing gel was in agreement with the protein being a monomer in its native form. The results (Fig. 6B) indicated radioactive labeling of the band corresponding to p150. A second dimension resolution on SDS-PAGE confirmed that the radioactive band was constituted mainly of the 150-kDa polypeptide with traces of p60, a salt-induced plasma membrane protein identified recently as an internally duplicated carbonic anhydrase (20Fisher M. Gokhman I. Pick U. Zamir A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17718-17723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As is obvious from the analysis, native p60 is not radioactively labeled. Hence, the radioactivity is associated with p150. A protein accumulating in the unicellular alga D. salina in response to high salt is shown here to be closely related to the animal transferrin family. Most known representatives have been implicated in functions of iron binding and delivery as well as the control of free iron levels in biological fluids (5Aisen P. Listowsky I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 357-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 6Baker E.N. Rumball S.V. Anderson B.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 350-353Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 7Thorstenden K. Romslo I. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A considerable number of transferrins, e.g. melanotransferrin, salmon transferrin, and insect transferrins, do not retain the entire set of the five amino acid ligands for Fe3+ and HCO3−1 (or CO3−2), as determined for serum transferrin and lactoferrin. In some cases different residues occupy these positions in each of the two lobes, e.g. in the salmon transferrin (Fig. 3) the NH2 lobe Arg-121 is replaced by Lys. In the human melanotransferrin COOH lobe, Ser replaces Asp-395 as well as Arg-465. In insect transferrins (21Kurama T. Kurata S. Natori S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and the bullfrog saxiphilin (22Morabito M.A. Moczydlowsky E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2478-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), replacements of the canonical liganding residues occur in both lobes. The presence of identical sets of putative liganding residues in the three repeats of p150 suggests the existence of three similar iron binding sites. Of the three replacements of canonical ligands (Asp to Gly, His to Asn or Gln, and Arg to Lys) the potentially most significant is the Asp to Gly substitution as Gly cannot serve as an iron ligand. In this respect it is noteworthy that in all three p150 repeats, an Asn residue, not conserved among animal transferrins, is found two residues COOH-terminal to the position of the Asp to Gly replacement. This Asn might potentially contribute to iron coordination. In its localization on the cell surface p150 most resembles melanotransferrin (17Brown J.P. Hewick R.M. Hellstrom I. Hellstrom K.E. Doolittle R.F. Dryer W.J. Nature. 1982; 296: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 23Kennard M.L. Richardson D.R. Gabathuler R. Ponka P. Jefferies W.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4178-4186Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), a 97-kDa protein first characterized as a cell surface marker for human melanoma cells, as well as an 80-kDa transferrin-like protein from fetal intestinal epithelial cells (24Danielsen E.M. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 939-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Both of these proteins are attached to the cell membrane not through membrane-spanning helices but via a glucosylphosphatidylinositol anchor added to the COOH-terminal residue exposed by proteolytic removal of a short COOH-terminal peptide. The algal p150 is a largely hydrophilic protein in which the transferrin-resembling repeats are followed by a ∼100-residue COOH-terminal extension ending with a mildly hydrophobic sequence. Whether p150 is also attached to the plasma membrane by a post-translationally added anchor and what is the functional significance of its COOH-terminal extension in membrane attachment are intriguing questions yet to be answered. The involvement of p150 in iron uptake is suggested by its induction under conditions of iron limitation, even in relatively low salinities. In view of these results, the induction of p150 in high salinities presumably reflects a decline in effective iron availability under these conditions. This decline may result, for example, from the effect of salt on Fe3+ solubility or the interference by salt in the iron uptake machinery. Moreover, in cells grown with 59Fe3+, p150 becomes radioactively labeled, demonstrating the ability of this protein to bind iron. The mode of action of p150 might resemble that of the membrane-anchored p97, which has been shown recently to act in iron uptake via a mechanism other than receptor-mediated endocytosis of Fe-transferrin (23Kennard M.L. Richardson D.R. Gabathuler R. Ponka P. Jefferies W.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4178-4186Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The details of this mechanism are still largely unknown except for the distinction between an initial iron-binding step and a subsequent energy-dependent iron internalization. Similar to p97, p150 in intact cells is Pronase-sensitive, implying that p150 is extracellularly exposed. Thus, p150 is a transferrin-like protein that retains activity in the high salinities characteristic of the natural habitats of the algae. The significance of the potentially triple-lobe structure or other structural features in the function and presumed salt stability of p150 remains to be clarified. Transferrin-like proteins were so far identified only in animals. In bacteria, several periplasmic proteins involved in active transport of ions, amino acids, and sugars show similarity in three-dimensional structure, but not in amino acid sequence, to single lobes of transferrins (6Baker E.N. Rumball S.V. Anderson B.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 350-353Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Of special interest is a 34-kDa periplasmic Fe3+-binding protein from pathogenic Neisseria which resembles human transferrin spectroscopically and functionally but not in primary sequence (25Nowalk J.A. Burroughs Tencza S. Mietzner T.A. Biochemistry. 1944; 33: 12775-12969Google Scholar). The identification of a transferrin variant in a green alga points to an earlier evolution of the eukaryotic-type transferrins than hitherto thought. The original function of such proteins could have been of the type exhibited by Dunaliella, i.e. in the uptake of iron or possibly other nutrients from the medium."

Their tasks include the recruitment of pols when needed, the facilitation of pol binding to the primer terminus, an increase in pol processivity, prevention of non-productive binding of pols to single-stranded DNA, the release of pols after DNA synthesis, and communication between the pols and other replication and cell cycle regulating proteins (for a rewiew, see 4Hübscher U.

RF-C is essential in DNA replication since it is necessary for loading of PCNA onto DNA and for subsequent DNA synthesis of the leading strand by pol δ (5Podust L.M. Podust V.N. Sogo J.M. Hübscher U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3072-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The gross structure of the RF-C complex appears to be conserved through eukaryotic evolution since RF-C isolated from either yeast or human is composed of one large and four small subunits (Mr = 140, 40, 38, 37, and 36 in human (6Lee S.H. Kwong A.D. Pan Z.-Q. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 594-602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Tsurimoto T. Fairman M.P. Stillman B. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4661-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The exact roles of the small subunits (RF-C 40, RF-C 38, RF-C 37, and RF-C 36) have not been determined; however, they share seven conserved regions with the large subunit, termed RF-C boxes II-VIII (8Cullmann G. Fien K. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4661-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Since the PCNA binding region within RF-C 140 (10Fotedar R. Mossi R. Fitzgerald P.

Holm C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4390-4397Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) contains the conserved RF-C boxes II-IV, all five subunits could be expected to bind PCNA. To date, only RF-C 40 has been shown to interact with PCNA (14Pan Z.Q. Chen M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic clamp loader, RF-C, appears to be structurally and functionally very similar to its prokaryotic and viral counterparts. The Escherichia coli γ complex consists, in analogy to human RF-C, of five subunits (γ, δ, δ′, χ, ψ) that cooperate to load the β clamp (the PCNA counterpart) onto the DNA (15Naktinis V. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 84: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In bacteriophage T4, the clamp loader consists of two subunits (g44/62p) that cooperate to load the g45p clamp (16Kaboord B.F. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1084-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence similarity between some of the subunits of these clamp loaders from prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and viral systems (8Cullmann G. Fien K. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4661-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 17O'Donnell M. Onrust R. Dean F.B. Chen M. Hurwitz J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) suggests that their basic mechanism of action may be similar. While a high resolution model for the sliding clamp formed by RF-C and PCNA is not yet available, an increasingly detailed picture of events occurring at the prokaryotic replication complex is emerging (18Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It has been shown that both the γ complex and the core pol interact with the β ring (15Naktinis V. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 84: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Prior to β clamp assembly on DNA, β shows higher affinity to the γ complex than to the core pol, but once β has been assembled on DNA, the core develops a stronger affinity for the ring and outcompetes the γ complex. After placing the β ring on the DNA, the γ clamp loader can dissociate from the complex and is ready for loading other β dimers. Naktinis et al. (19Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) were able to assign the β binding function to the δ subunit of the γ complex. In the uncharged state, δ is buried in the γ complex, preventing its binding to β, but upon ATP binding, the complex undergoes a conformational change and thus exposing δ for interaction with β. In view of the analogy with the γ complex, we sought to shed some light on the structure of the RF-C·PCNA clamp. Specifically, how does RF-C interact with PCNA in complex formation? The crystal structure of PCNA shows a homotrimeric, ring-shaped molecule with an overall negative charge but with a central hole surrounded by positive charges through which DNA slides (20Krishna T.S. Kong X.P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). This structure is very similar to the three dimensional structure of the β clamp despite the lack of significant sequence similarities (21Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3613-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The C termini of the β subunit, as well as those of PCNA, protrude from structurally homologous faces (C-side) of the ring and are likely candidates for interactions with other proteins. The C-terminal amino acids of the E. coli β ring have been shown to be important for the interaction with both the clamp loader and the pol (15Naktinis V. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 84: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Studies by Fukuda et al. (22Fukuda K. Morioka H. Imajou S. Ikeda S. Ohtsuka E. Tsurimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22527-22534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) suggested that RF-C binds to the C-side of human PCNA, specifically to Asp41 and aa 254-257, although the terminal four amino acids are dispensible. Asp41 is partially exposed close to the C terminus in the yeast PCNA structure, making the hypothesis plausible. Care, however, must be taken when interpreting the effects of deletion mutations in PCNA since it has been shown that deletion of C-terminal residues can have adverse effects on the PCNA structure (23Brand S.R. Bernstein R.M. Mathews M.B. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3070-3078PubMed Google Scholar), and the trimeric structure of PCNA has been shown to be necessary for the interaction with RF-C (24Jónsson Z.O. Podust V.N. Podust L.M. Hübscher U. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5745-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To study the interaction of RF-C with PCNA in more detail, we used modified PCNA carrying artificial phosphorylation sites at either their N or C termini (called nphPCNA and cphPCNA, respectively) (5Podust L.M. Podust V.N. Sogo J.M. Hübscher U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3072-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In kinase protection assay experiments (KPA) (18Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), nphPCNA or cphPCNA is incubated with the protein to be assayed for interaction. If the protein binds to PCNA close to either end, the artificial phosphorylation site is expected to become less accessible to the kinase so that a decrease in phosphorylation is observed. In this paper, we show that the pentameric calf thymus RF-C complex protects the C termini, but not the N termini, of PCNA from phosphorylation. We therefore conclude that RF-C interacts with the C-side of the PCNA ring. The RF-C 140 homologue of Drosophila melanogaster is also able to protect the C termini but not the N termini of PCNA, showing, besides its interaction with the C-side of PCNA, that the molecular interaction between these two auxiliary factors is conserved through evolution. More precisely, the interaction between PCNA and RF-C 140 is due to the PCNA binding region, located in human RF-C 140 between aa 478 and 712 (10Fotedar R. Mossi R. Fitzgerald P. Rousselle T. Maga G. Brickner H. Messier H. Khastilba S. Hübscher U. Fotedar A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4423-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which also protects only the C-side of the ring. RF-C 140 is not the only RF-C subunit involved in PCNA binding as we could show that RF-C 36 also interacts with PCNA and is able to protect modified PCNA from phosphorylation. Radioactive-labeled nucleotides were purchased from Amersham Corp. All other reagents were of analytical grade and were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) or Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland).

Poly(dA)1000-1500 and oligo(dT)12-18 were purchased from Sigma and Pharmacia, respectively. Poly(dA)/oligo(dT) (base ratio 10:1) was prepared as described (25Weiser T. Gassmann M. Thömmes P. Ferrari E. Hafkemeyer P. Hübscher U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10420-10428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Singly primed M13 single-stranded DNA was prepared according to (26Podust V. Mikhailov V. Georgaki A. Hübscher U. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1992; 102: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides for modification and sequencing of the PCNA gene were from Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland). The plasmid pT7/hPCNA carrying the cDNA of human PCNA was kindly provided by B. Stillman (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY). The pET19b/p36His, pET5a/40K, and pET16/p128 expression vectors containing the cDNA of RF-C 36, RF-C 40, and RF-C 128, respectively, of human RF-C were a gift of J. Hurwitz (New York). The cDNAs encoding the fragments of the human RF-C 140 were from A. Fotedar (La Jolla, CA). Restriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp., New England Biolabs (NEB), and Boehringer Mannheim. The catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase from bovine heart muscle was from Sigma. Human wtPCNA was produced in E. coli using the plasmid pT7/hPCNA and purified as described previously (27Fien K. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Calf thymus pol δ and pentameric RF-C were isolated as described (25Weiser T. Gassmann M. Thömmes P. Ferrari E. Hafkemeyer P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4159-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The three fragments of human RF-C 140, A, B, and A + B were purified according to (10Fotedar R. Mossi R.

The N-terminal phosphorylatable PCNA (nphPCNA) was produced and purified as described in Podust et al. (5Podust L.M. Podust V.N. Sogo J.M. Hübscher U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3072-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cloning and isolation of RF-C 140 of D. melanogaster will be described elsewhere. 2L. K. Gaur, B. L. Allen, and S. H. Hardin, submitted for publication. Polyclonal antibodies against PCNA were raised in chicken and affinity purified with protein A-Sepharose. The alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-chicken antibody was from Sigma. The poly(dA)/oligo(dT) assay (RF-C-independent assay) was carried out according to (25Weiser T. Gassmann M. Thömmes P. Ferrari E. Hafkemeyer P. Hübscher U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10420-10428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA replication on singly primed M13 DNA (RF-C-dependent assay) was performed as described previously (26Podust V. Mikhailov V. Georgaki A. Hübscher U. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1992; 102: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A construct encoding PCNA with the C-terminal consensus phosphorylation sequence for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Arg-Ala-Ser-Val-Ala) was generated by PCR in analogy to a similar strategy on the N terminus (5Podust L.M. Podust V.N. Sogo J.M. Hübscher U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3072-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The original pT7/hPCNA expression vector (27Fien K. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) was used as a template for PCR with a 28-mer T7-promoter primer sequence and a 49-mer lower primer (5′-GCG CGG ATC CTA TGC AAC ACT TGC TCT TCT AGA TCC TTC TTC ATC CTC G-3′) designed to introduce the phosphorylation site at the C terminus. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and recloned into the pT7 expression vector. The resulting clone (called pT7/cphPCNA) was sequenced to confirm the absence of mutations. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells transformed with the pT7/cphPCNA expression construct were grown at 37°C in 200 ml of LB medium to A600 = 0.4 and induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl thiogalactoside. After 3 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by freezing/thawing in 10 ml of buffer A containing 25 mM NaCl. The mix was sonicated and centrifuged for 30 min at 25,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto a 4-ml Q-Sepharose column and equilibrated in buffer B containing 100 mM NaCl. The column was washed with the same buffer, and proteins were eluted with a 50-ml linear gradient from 0.1 to 0.7 M NaCl in buffer B. The fractions containing cphPCNA were pooled and loaded on a 1.5-ml phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A containing 1.2 M NaCl. The column was washed with buffer A without Nonidet P-40, and cphPCNA was eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient from 1.2 to 0 M NaCl in buffer A without Nonidet P-40. cphPCNA containing fractions were pooled, brought to 50% (v/v) glycerol in buffer A and stored at −20°C until use. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with the pET19b plasmid containing RF-C 36 sequence linked to a His tag at its N terminus. The cells were grown in 1 liter of LB medium to A600 = 0.6, and isopropyl thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mM. The cells were further grown for 5 h at 37°C, harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 20 min, and then lysed in buffer C by three passages through a French press. The lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 18,000 × g, and the pellet was solubilized in 10 ml of buffer C containing 6 M guanidinium-HCl. After ultracentrifugation at 35,000 × g for 40 min, the supernatant was dialyzed sequentially against buffer C containing urea (8, 4, 2, and finally 0 M). Most of the protein precipitated during the last dialysis step but could be solubilized by resuspending it in buffer C containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. The gene encoding RF-C 40 was cut out of the original pET5a vector with EcoRI and cloned into the pET28a+ vector, to gain RF-C 40 with a His tag at its N terminus. The resulting clone was sequenced to confirm the reading frame and the presence of the His tag. RF-C 40 was expressed and purified essentially as RF-C 36 except that buffer D was used (instead of buffer C). Soluble protein was obtained by serial dialysis against buffer D containing urea (4, 3, 2, 1.5, 1, 0.5, 0.25, and finally 0 M), 10% glycerol, and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin. A linker encoding a 6-His tag was cloned into the single BstBI restriction site at the end of the gene encoding RF-C 140 in pET16b. This resulted in the expression of the human RF-C 140 His-tagged at its C terminus. RF-C 140 was expressed and purified as described above for RF-C 40. 250 ng (3 pmol) of cphPCNA were incubated with an excess of the protein to be tested and with 3 μCi [γ-32P]ATP in a 10-μl total volume of KPA buffer. After 2 min at 37°C, the phosphorylation reaction was started by the addition of 0.75 units of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The reaction mix was further incubated at 37°C. After 1, 2, 5, and 10 min, 2-μl aliquots were withdrawn, and the reactions were stopped with 8 μl of 2% SDS. The samples were then analyzed by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid, soaked in 10% acetic acid/12% methanol, dried, and autoradiographed. Gels with labeled products were exposed on a special screen for PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). After exposure, the screen was scanned into the PhosphorImager and quantitation was performed with the Image Quant program of Molecular Dynamics. To exclude false-positive results due to intrinsic ATPase activity, samples were tested for the presence of free phosphate by thin layer chromatography. 80 pmol of the His-tagged proteins to be assayed were mixed with 20 μl of Ni-NTA resin in buffer G. The mixture was incubated by rocking for 1 h at 4°C. After 3 min of centrifugation at 2,000 × g, the beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml of buffer G. Then 80 pmol of human wtPCNA were added to the beads in a 100-μl total volume of buffer I. In order to allow binding of wtPCNA to the Ni-NTA coupled proteins, the suspension was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After centrifugation as above, the resin was washed 4 times with buffer H, and the proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in 30 μl of SDS-gel loading buffer. The proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and PCNA was detected by immunoblotting with polyclonal antibodies. The C termini of PCNA, as well as those of the β clamp in prokaryotes, protrude from one face of the ring, making them candidates for interaction with other proteins. The C termini of the β clamp in E. coli have been shown to be involved both in the recognition of β by the γ clamp loader and in the binding of the pol (15Naktinis V. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 84: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Considering the structural and functional similarities of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic pol sliding clamps, we designed experiments to test the hypothesis that PCNA and RF-C interact in a way similar to that of the β clamp and its clamp loader. For this purpose, we used plasmids containing the human PCNA open reading frame with an artificial phosphorylation site for cAMP-dependent protein kinase fused either to its 3′- or 5′-end (5Podust L.M. Podust V.N. Sogo J.M. Hübscher U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3072-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Predictably, these modified forms of PCNA (called cphPCNA and nphPCNA, respectively) run slightly slower than unmodified PCNA on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel due to the presence of the phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1A, cphPCNA). Unlike the unmodified PCNA, cphPCNA and nphPCNA (see 5Podust L.M. Podust V.N. Sogo J.M. Hübscher U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3072-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) can be efficiently phosphorylated in vitro (Fig. 1B, cphPCNA). Moreover, these PCNA forms have full activity in replication assays on primed single-stranded M13 DNA (RF-C-dependent assay; Fig. 1C, cphPCNA) and on poly(dA)/oligo(dT) (RF-C-independent assay, data not shown) (see also 5Podust L.M. Podust V.N. Sogo J.M. Hübscher U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3072-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). First, we studied with KPA the interaction of the calf thymus RF-C complex with human PCNA. For this purpose, cphPCNA or nphPCNA and a 2-fold molar excess of the calf thymus RF-C complex were preincubated with [γ-32P]ATP for 2 min at 37°C to allow interaction between the proteins. After addition of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, the kinetics of the phosphorylation reaction were assayed. If RF-C interacts with PCNA close to either terminus, the accessibility of the respective artificial phosphorylation sites to the kinase is expected to be reduced. This results in a reduction of the amount of radioactivity incorporated in the PCNA ring. In Fig. 2, we show that a 2-fold molar excess of RF-C inhibited phosphorylation of cphPCNA by approximately 50% after 10 min but did not inhibit the phosphorylation of nphPCNA. This experiment provided evidence that RF-C interacts with PCNA close enough to the C termini to protect them from phosphorylation. Having shown that the pentameric calf thymus RF-C complex interacts with the C-side of human PCNA, we next wanted to investigate the role of RF-C 140 in this interaction. Two functional regions of human RF-C 140 have recently been identified (10Fotedar R. Mossi R. Fitzgerald P. Rousselle T. Maga G. Brickner H. Messier H. Khastilba S. Hübscher U. Fotedar A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4423-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the DNA binding (fragment A) and the PCNA binding regions (fragment B). The DNA binding activity was localized between aa 366 and 477, where the conserved box I (restricted to the large subunit) is situated (8Cullmann G. Fien K. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4661-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This region shows striking similarity to the N-terminal regions of all bacterial DNA ligases sequenced to date (11Burbelo P.D.

The PCNA binding region, which is adjacent to but does not overlap with the DNA binding region, includes aa 478-712.

Since the pentameric RF-C complex could protect cphPCNA from phosphorylation (see Fig. 2), the effect of the PCNA binding region of RF-C 140 (fragment B) alone was investigated in the same assay. Using a 6-fold molar excess of RF-C 140 fragment B, 80% less phosphorylation of cphPCNA was observed after 10 min of incubation (Fig. 3A). The RF-C 140 fragment B, however, did not significantly protect human PCNA containing an artificial phosphorylation site at its N terminus (data not shown). This result further supported the notion that RF-C binds to PCNA on the side where its C termini are located rather than to the other face of the ring. To exclude the possibility that the protection seen is an artifact caused by the intrinsic ATPase activity of RF-C 140 fragment B, we separated 2 μl of the KPA samples on polyethyleneimine-thin layer chromatography after different incubation times at 37°C. In all cases tested, the amount of free [32P]phosphate produced was negligible (data not shown). Consistent with its lack of interaction with PCNA, a 6-fold molar"

Moreover, GroEL-TF complexes isolated from such cells showed much greater binding capacity than GroEL from TF-deficient cells. Furthermore, the addition of pure TF to pure GroEL also enhanced markedly its binding capacity. The affinity of GroEL for CRAG also rises during heat shock due to GroEL phosphorylation. TF expression, however, did not promote GroEL phosphorylation. Moreover, heat shock and TF overproduction affected GroEL binding to other denatured polypeptides in distinct ways; only TF promoted binding to certain polypeptides, whereas only phosphorylation increased binding to others. Thus, association with TF and phosphorylation are independent regulators of GroEL function. This enhanced affinity of TF-GroEL complexes for unfolded proteins may also be important in protein folding, because TF has prolyl isomerase activity and associates with nascent polypeptides.

In this study we demonstrated that mice subjected to whole body hypothermia induced the cellular stress response, resulting in the increased expression of hsp72 mRNA in brain, heart, kidney, liver, and lung. We performed a detailed analysis of the major parameters of the stress response and found that cold induction of hsp expression is mediated by heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), which is also responsible for heat induction of the cellular stress response. However, there are differences in the mechanisms of HSF1 activation by hypothermia versus hyperthermia, as hypothermia does not cause the hyperphosphorylation of HSF1 that is characteristic of heat-activated HSF1.

Upon exposure to a variety of harmful environmental conditions, cells respond by initiating the cellular stress response. Also termed the heat shock response due to the conditions under which it was first characterized, this phenomenon results in the increased expression of a family of proteins called heat shock proteins (hsps), which act to protect the cell from the harmful effects of the adverse environmental conditions. hsps act by binding to malfolded proteins caused by the stressful conditions and aiding in their folding back to the native state (1Morimoto R.I.

In addition to the heat-induced expression of hsps, previous studies have also examined the induction of the stress response by cold treatment or hypothermia. It has been shown that Drosophila larvae (4Burton V. Mitchell H.K. Young P. Petersen N.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3550-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), cultured human diploid lung fibroblast cells (5Liu A.Y.-C. Bian H. Huang L.E. Lee Y.K. J. Biol.

However, the mechanism by which cold treatment causes the induction of hsp expression is not well characterized. In order to explore the mechanism for cold induction of hsp expression, we performed a detailed analysis of the major parameters of the stress response in vivo in mouse tissues following hypothermic treatment. We found that the stress response was induced in all tissues examined at the levels of HSF 1The abbreviations used are: HSFheat shock factorHSEheat shock elementRTreverse transcriptasePCRpolymerase chain reaction.

We also observed that hsp expression is increased by hypothermia alone but that recovery is necessary for maximal stimulation of hsp expression. Furthermore, we show that cold induction of the stress response is mediated by HSF1 but that the HSF1 protein activated by cold treatment does not exhibit the characteristic hyperphosphorylation observed for HSF1 protein activated by heat treatment (8Sarge K.D.

Adult male C3H/HeNCr MTV− mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories and maintained under a controlled light cycle (14 h of light and 10 h of darkness) at 22 ± 1°C. Cold shock was performed by incubating single mice in standard plastic tubs in a 2-3°C incubator for 8 h with food and water readily available. These treatment conditions decreased the rectal core temperatures from 36.5 to 34.0°C, giving an average decrease in temperature of 2.5°C. Where indicated, recovery was performed by transferring mice to a plastic tub at 22°C for 1 h. These studies were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and tissues were harvested immediately and quick frozen on dry ice. Tissues were minced with a sharp razor blade, and proteins were extracted by the addition of 5 volumes of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.42 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 7 μg/ml pepstatin A. The tissues were further disrupted by grinding against the microcentrifuge tube wall and gentle pipetting. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 4°C. The protein content of the supernatant was determined by absorbance readings at 205 nm, and unused aliquots were quick frozen in a dry ice/ethanol slurry and stored at −80°C. Gel shift analysis was performed using equal quantities of extracts by incubation in the presence of a 32P-labeled self-complementary HSE consensus oligonucleotide (5′-CTAGAAGCTTCTAGAAGCTTCTAG-3′) as described previously (8Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). For experiments involving antibodies, 1 μl of a 1:50 dilution of polyclonal antibodies specific for HSF1 or HSF2 was added to extract aliquots and incubated at 22°C for 5 min prior to the gel shift analysis. Western blot analysis of tissue extracts was performed as described previously using a polyclonal antibody specific for HSF1 (8Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). RNA was prepared by homogenization of the tissues in 4 M guanidine thiocyanate, 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, 1%β-mercaptoethanol using a Biospec Products, Inc. Tissue-Tearor. Aggregated material was removed by centrifugation for 5 min in a microcentrifuge. 1400 μl of homogenate was loaded onto a 500-μl 5.7 M CsCl cushion. Samples were centrifuged for 16 h at 22°C at 50,000 rpm in a TLS55 swinging bucket rotor in a Beckman Optima-TL centrifuge. Supernatant fluids were removed with an aspirator, and the pellet was dehydrated by the addition of ice cold 70% EtOH. The pellets were transferred to clean microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatants were removed, and the pellets were resuspended in TE (10 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mμ EDTA), phenol:chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in H2O. RNA was quantified by measuring absorbance readings at 260 nm. Reverse transcription was performed by heating 4 μg of total RNA at 65°C for 3 min and then incubating in 1 × RT buffer (Boehringer Mannheim Biochemical Products), 0.5 mM dNTP, 18 units of RNAguard (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), 0.5 mg of random hexamer primer (Pharmacia), 12.5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim Biochemical Products) in a total volume of 20 μl at 22°C for 10 min, followed by 42°C for 90 min. Amplification of cDNA was performed by PCR as follows: 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin, 2 μl of reverse transcription reaction products, 100 ng each of oligonucleotide primers that bind up- and downstream, respectively, within the ribosomal protein S16 sequences (5′-TCCAAGGGTCCGCTGCAGTC-3′ and 5′-CGTTCACCTTGATGAGCCCATT-3′), 100 ng each of primers that bind up- and downstream, respectively, within the heat-inducible hsp72 sequences (5′-ATCACCATCACCAACGACAAGG-3′ and 5′-TGCCCAAGCAGCTATCAAGTGC-3′), 0.3 μl of 3000 Ci/mmol [α-32P]dCTP (DuPont NEN), and 1.5 units of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) in a total volume of 50 μl that was overlaid with mineral oil. PCR parameters were 95°C for 1 min, 65°C for 1 min, 72°C for 2 min for 21-26 cycles. Measures were taken to ensure PCR protocol was in the linear range of amplification. PCR products were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. In order to characterize tissue-dependent differences in hypothermia-induced cellular stress response, we first examined the levels of HSF DNA binding activity that are induced in various mouse tissues following hypothermia. Tissues were taken from mice subjected to hypothermic treatment for 8 h, with or without recovery at room temperature (22-24°C) for 1 h, and then extracts of these tissues were subjected to gel shift analysis using an HSE-containing oligonucleotide. As shown in Fig. 1, the level of DNA binding activity was low in extracts of tissues from control animals (lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10). However, in all tissues examined, an increase in DNA binding activity was observed following hypothermic treatment without recovery (lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11). Fig. 1 also shows that for the kidney, liver, and lung, allowing the mice to recover at room temperature for 1 h after the 8 h of hypothermia did not significantly alter the levels of HSF DNA binding from that observed for these tissues in mice subjected to hypothermia alone (compare lanes 5 and 6, 8 and 9, and 11 and 12). However, heart consistently showed a significant increase in HSF DNA binding following recovery at room temperature after the hypothermia treatment, relative to the levels induced by hypothermia alone (compare lanes 2 and 3). In some experiments it was observed that the DNA binding activity of lung extracts was also further stimulated following a recovery period. Two heat shock transcription factors have been identified in mouse (9Sarge K.D. Zimarino V. Holm K. Wu C. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1902-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). HSF1 mediates induction of the stress response following exposure to stressful conditions (8Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), while HSF2 appears to be involved in the developmental regulation of hsp expression (10Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Abravaya K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4104-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 11Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2087-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 12Sarge K.D. Park-Sarge O.-K. Kirby J.D. Mayo K.E. Morimoto R.I. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 1334-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We next sought to determine which HSF was responsible for the cold induced HSE binding activity by performing gel shift analysis in conjunction with polyclonal antibodies specific for HSF1 and HSF2. As shown in Fig. 2, hypothermia-induced HSE binding was shown to be due to HSF1 by the elimination of the HSF·HSE complex following preincubation of the extracts from hypothermic/recovered tissues with polyclonal antibody specific to HSF1 in heart, kidney, and lung (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the DNA binding activity in liver was decreased by pre-incubation in the presence of antibodies specific to both HSF1 and HSF2, suggesting that the induction of the cellular stress response in this tissue may occur by more than one mechanism. DNA binding activity of extracts prepared from non-recovered tissues showed a similar pattern (data not shown). Previous studies have shown that the activation of HSF1 DNA binding in heat treated cells is coupled with an increase in phosphorylation of the HSF1 protein in these cells, which results in a decreased mobility of this protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels (8Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 13Larson J.S. Schuetz T.J. Kingston R.E. Nature. 1988; 335: 372-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to determine whether HSF1 undergoes similar phosphorylation events in response to cold treatment, tissue extracts of mice subjected to hypothermic treatment, with or without recovery for 1 h, were subjected to Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies specific for mouse HSF1. The HSF1-specific antibody recognized a doublet of HSF1 polypeptides, consisting of the previously described HSF1 α- and β-isoforms (14Goodson M.L. Sarge K.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), in each of the tissues from control, hypothermic, and hypothermic/recovered mice (Fig. 3). However, this analysis revealed no apparent change in mobility of HSF1 due to any phosphorylation events in response to hypothermic treatment, in contrast to that observed for the HSF1 protein in heat-treated NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3, lane 14). These results suggest that while hypothermic treatment is able to induce HSF1 DNA binding, it is not able to cause inducible phosphorylation of the HSF1 protein as is observed under heat shock conditions. We next wanted to determine whether the DNA binding activity of HSF1 induced in tissues by hypothermic treatment was able to mediate a productive stress response. Therefore, we examined the levels of heat-inducible hsp72 mRNA present in tissues of control mice and mice subjected to hypothermic treatment, with or without recovery. For this analysis, we employed RT-PCR (reverse transcription coupled with the polymerase chain reaction) using primer pairs specific for hsp72 mRNA (15Hunt C. Calderwood S. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 87: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) as well as the mRNA for the S16 ribosomal protein (16Wagner M. Perry R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3560-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) as an internal control for efficiencies of reverse transcription and PCR amplification between samples. Fig. 4 shows that while the levels of S16 internal control were not significantly altered by hypothermic treatment, the levels of hsp72 mRNA were increased by cold treatment in all tissues examined. In order to determine the magnitude of the increase in hsp72 mRNA levels in each tissue caused by hypothermia, the results of the RT-PCR analysis were quantified using a PhosphorImager. The ratios of the values above background for hsp72/S16 products in each lane were compared, and the -fold induction of hsp72 mRNA levels following hypothermic or hypothermic/recovered treatment with respect to the control mice were plotted. The results of this analysis, shown in Fig. 4B, demonstrate that there are tissue-dependent differences in induction of hsp72 mRNA levels following hypothermia, ranging from approximately 2-fold induction in kidney and lung to 4-fold in heart and liver. In addition, in all tissues tested, recovery of the mice for 1 h at room temperature after hypothermia caused a further increase in hsp72 mRNA levels, resulting in overall increases in hsp mRNA levels that ranged from approximately 4-fold in kidney to nearly 30-fold in liver. Analyses of stress response parameters were also performed on tissues from animals that had been cold treated for different lengths of times ranging from 1 to 48 h. Maximal levels of HSF1 activation with respect to DNA binding were observed at 8 and 48 h, with a decrease in activity observed during the intervening time points (data not shown). In no instance was phosphorylation of HSF1 observed. RT-PCR analysis of hsp72 mRNA levels was performed using RNA prepared from the lungs of 48-h cold-treated and cold-treated/recovered mice (Fig. 4A, lanes 13 and 14). The levels of hsp72 mRNA in the lungs of the 48-h cold-treated mice were similar to those of 8-h cold-treated mice, with higher levels of induction observed following a 1-h recovery period (Fig. 4B). We next sought to examine the stress response pathway in the brain following hypothermia because of this tissue's high susceptibility to damage following insults such as ischemia and its ability to be protected from neurological damage by moderate hypothermia (17Leonov Y. Sterz F. Safar P. Radovsky A. Oku K. Tisherman S. Stezoski S.W. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1990; 10: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 18Welsh F.A. Sims R.E. Harris V.A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1990; 10: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 19Shuaib A. Sochocka E. Ishaqzay R. Hertz L. Code W.E. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 663-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift analysis performed using whole brain tissue extracts demonstrated constitutive HSE binding activity with no additional induction following hypothermia or hypothermia followed by recovery (Fig. 5A). Although the brain initiates the stress response following as little as 5 min of ischemia (20Nowak T.S. J. Neurochem. 1985; 45: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 21Vass K. Welch W.J. Nowak T.S. Acta Neuropathol. 1988; 77: 122-135Crossref Scopus (382) Google Scholar), it is not likely that this is the explanation for the high levels of HSF1 DNA binding even in the cage control as we removed the brains in less than 45 s following sacrifice. Interestingly, this HSE binding activity is due to both HSF1 and HSF2, as preincubation of the extracts with antibodies directed against both HSFs diminished the HSF·HSE complex signal (Fig. 5B, lanes 1-3). This mixed HSF1/HSF2 HSE binding activity was also characteristic of the cold-treated/recovered extracts (Fig. 5B, lanes 4-6). The contribution of HSF2 to the HSE binding activity was not surprising in light of previous studies, which have shown that HSF2 mRNA levels are higher in the brain than in the kidney, liver, and lung (22Fiorenza M.T. Farkas T. Dissing M. Kolding D. Zimarino V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed no change in the phosphorylation state of HSF1 in the brain as a result of hypothermia (data not shown). However, the levels of hsp72 mRNA are increased 2- and 5-fold in response to hypothermia and hypothermia/recovery, respectively (Fig. 5C). This suggests that a novel mechanism must be responsible for cold induced hsp72 expression within the brain, as it appears that HSF1 is already capable of binding to DNA. Perhaps this tissue requires a more immediate response to stressful conditions, and maintaining constitutive HSF1 DNA binding activity allows it to be primed for the induction of hsp72 expression. We have shown that whole body hypothermia is capable of inducing the stress response in cells of a large number of mouse tissues. HSF DNA binding activity was induced in the heart, kidney, liver, and lung following cold treatment of mice. This activity was shown to be due to HSF1, which also mediates heat-induced expression of hsps. Interestingly, hypothermia treatment did not result in phosphorylation of HSF1, which has been shown to occur in heat-treated cells. Cold incubation increased levels of hsp72 mRNA at least 2-4-fold in all tissues tested. Furthermore, following recovery for 1 h at normal body temperature, a large increase in hsp72 mRNA synthesis occurred ranging from 4- to 29-fold higher than in control mice. Though HSF DNA binding activity was constitutively present in the brain, hypothermic treatment induced hsp72 expression in this tissue as well. Our findings support a two-step mechanism for the activation of the stress response, which suggests that induction of HSF1 DNA binding activity precedes inducible phosphorylation of HSF1 and that these two steps are not necessarily coupled. Our data show that hypothermia did not induce phosphorylation though HSF1 clearly was capable of DNA binding. This was true regardless of the length of time the animals were exposed to hypothermia (data not shown). Thus, HSF1 DNA binding and phosphorylation are not tightly coupled. Furthermore, analysis of stress response parameters in the brain tissue demonstrated that HSF DNA binding activity alone is not sufficient for the induction of hsp expression, as this tissue did not exhibit an increased level of DNA binding following hypothermic treatment, but hsp levels were increased up to 7-fold. Another group has examined the effect of hypothermia on the heat shock response in mice in vivo (7Matz J.M. Blake M.J. Tatelman H.M. Lavoi K.P. Holbrook N.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: R38-R47PubMed Google Scholar). They observed an induction of hsps in brown adipose tissue following cold exposure. However, they did not detect induction of the stress response in many other tissues including the brain, heart, and lung following hypothermia. In contrast, we detected induction of the heat-inducible hsp72 mRNA in the brain, heart, and lung following cold exposure. Furthermore, their study indicated that recovery was not required to achieve induction in brown adipose tissue, but we observed a major additional induction following a recovery period in brain, heart, kidney, liver, and lung. In support of our findings, Liu et al. (5Liu A.Y.-C. Bian H. Huang L.E. Lee Y.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14768-14775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that cold treatment induces hsp gene expression at the transcriptional level in HeLa and human diploid lung fibroblast cells in vitro. The reason for the discrepancy between the data presented in this paper and that published by Matz et al. (7Matz J.M. Blake M.J. Tatelman H.M. Lavoi K.P. Holbrook N.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: R38-R47PubMed Google Scholar) is unknown. Perhaps the levels of hsp mRNA they detected would have been higher in the heart and lung if they had permitted a recovery period. One difference is that we utilized a more sensitive means of quantifying hsp mRNA levels; their study used Northern blot analysis while our study employed RT-PCR analysis. In agreement with their studies, we also observed a steady increase in the efficacy of the stress response for up to 8 h of cold exposure, followed by a decline, and another increase at 48 h (data not shown). The data presented here demonstrate that a similar pathway for induction of the cellular stress response is utilized under both cold stress and heat stress conditions and that at least one major protein that is heat inducible is also cold inducible (hsp72). In addition, it is interesting to note that in vivo the degree of induction of hsp mRNA levels caused by cold treatment followed by recovery is similar to, and for some tissues even greater than, that observed by heat treatment. 2L. Q. Gothard and K. D. Sarge, submitted for publication. This occurs even though the phosphorylation of HSF1 following heat shock, which has been suggested to be necessary for maximal transcription stimulation, does not occur following cold treatment and recovery. Thus, something else yet unidentified must also contribute to achieve the final result of increased hsp72 expression. In addition, something must be occurring during the recovery period that allows for a significant increase in the synthesis of hsp72 mRNA. One possibility is that the ability of the activated HSF1 trimer to be transported into the nucleus is inhibited by cold temperatures and is recovered after the animal returns to normal core body temperatures. Thus, DNA binding activity would be observed in cellular extracts, but the transcription factor would not be able to reach its destination at the promoter of heat shock genes until nuclear transport was restored. Other cellular processes besides nuclear transport are also inhibited by cold temperatures. This brings up the possibility that transcription itself is inhibited by the cold until recovery is permitted. However, this cannot explain the significant induction observed in the recovered samples, since the S16 ribosomal mRNA levels of the non-recovered samples are maintained at levels approximately equal to that of the cage control samples. One might argue that this is simply due to a high stability of the S16 RNA, and thus you might not expect changes in mRNA levels during the 8 h of cold treatment. However, there was no change in the S16 mRNA levels even after 48 h, while there were major increases in the hsp72 mRNA levels (see Fig. 4, A (lanes 13 and 14) and B). The need for a protective response following cold stress is logical. First, cold treatment itself causes protein denaturation, and hsps would be required to assist in refolding these proteins. Second, metabolism in general slows during cold exposure, but as the animal recovers its cells will start producing new proteins, and thus additional hsps would be required. The cytoprotective effect of hypothermia is currently used to improve the outcome of many medical procedures such as organ transplantation, treatment of heart disease, and aneurysm repair, but the mechanism by which hypothermia protects the body's tissues is not well understood. Our results suggest a mechanism that may explain these beneficial effects of hypothermia. Several pharmacological agents have been identified that induce the heat shock response (23Amici C.

Because activation of Ras induced by growth factor stimulation likely requires the localization of mSos1 to the plasma membrane, we have investigated the possibility that the PH domain of mSos1 might mediate an interaction of mSos1 with phospholipid membranes. A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of mSos1 bound specifically and tightly to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) with a Kd of 1.8 ± 0.4 μM. This interaction was saturable and was competed away with the soluble head group of PI(4,5)P2, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate. Substitution of Arg452 within the PH domain with Ala had only a slight effect on binding to PI(4,5)P2, whereas substitution of Arg459 severely compromised the ability of the mSos1 PH domain to bind to PI(4,5)P2 containing vesicles. Purified full-length mSos1 and mSos1 complexed with Grb2 were also tested for binding to various phosphoinositol derivatives and demonstrated a specific interaction with PI(4,5)P2, although these interactions were weaker (Kd = ∼53 and ∼69 μM, respectively) than that of the PH domain alone. These findings suggest that the PH domain of mSos1 can interact in vitro with phospholipid vesicles containing PI(4,5)P2 and that this interaction is facilitated by the ionic interaction of Arg459 with the negatively charged head group of PI(4,5)P2. The association of the mSos1 PH domain with phospholipid may therefore play a role in regulating the function of this enzyme in vivo. mSos1 has been implicated in coupling mammalian tyrosine kinases to the Ras GTPase.

INTRODUCTIONGuanine nucleotide exchange factors catalyze the conversion of Ras from its inactive GDP state to an active GTP-bound state, leading to the activation of downstream effectors (1McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). A Ras-guanine nucleotide exchange factor specifically implicated in tyrosine kinase signaling is Sos, which was first identified in Drosophila (2Simon M.A. Bowtell D.D. Dodson G.S. Laverty T.R. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1991; 67: 701-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 3Bonfini L. Karlovich C.A. Dasgupta C. Banerjee U. Science. 1992; 255: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar); subsequently two mammalian homologues have been described, mSos1 (murine form of the son-of-sevenless 1) and mSos2 (4Bowtell D. Fu P. Simon M. Senior P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6511-6515Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Sos is a large protein (∼150 kDa) that consists of an N-terminal region, with a Dbl homology domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) 1The abbreviations used are: PHpleckstrin homologyPI(4,5)P2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphatePI(4)Pphosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphatePI(3,4,5)P3phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphateIns(1,4,5)inositol 1,4,5-triphosphatePIphosphatidylinositolPCphoshpatidylcholinePSphosphatidylserineGSTglutathione S-transferase. domain, a catalytic region that is responsible for the protein's guanine nucleotide exchange activity, and a C-terminal proline-rich tail with binding sites for the SH3 domains of the Grb2 adaptor protein.Because Ras is membrane-associated, activation of Sos may involve a change in Sos subcellular localization from the cytosol to the membrane, where it can gain access to GDP-bound Ras (1McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 4Bowtell D. Fu P. Simon M. Senior P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been observed that targeting of mSos1 to the plasma membrane is sufficient for the activation of the Ras signaling pathway, consistent with the notion that mSos1 is active when situated at the membrane (6Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. Al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 7Quilliam L.A. Huff S.Y. Rabun K.M. Wei W. Park W. Broek D. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8512-8516Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). One possibility is that the association of mSos1 with the SH3 domains of Grb2 may serve to modify mSos1 localization upon growth factor stimulation through interaction of the Grb2 SH2 domain with the tyrosine phosphate of activated growth factor receptors (8Gale N.W. Kaplan S. Lowenstein E.J. Schlessinger J. Bar-Sagi D. Nature. 1993; 363: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 9Li N. Batzer A. Daly R. Yajnik V. Skolnik E. Chardin P. Bar-Sagi D.

Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Science. 1993; 260: 1953-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar).Recent evidence has raised the possibility that the interactions of Grb2 SH3 domains with the C-terminal tail of mSos1 proteins may have more complex functions than simple relocalization and conversely has suggested that other regions of mSos1 may be involved in membrane targeting. Deletion of the mSos1 C-terminal region yields an mSos1 variant that transforms Rat1 cells (14Wang W. Fisher E.M.C. Jia Q. Dunn J.M. Porfiri E. Downward J. Egan S.E. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Similarly, Drosophila Sos constructs lacking the proline-rich region are able to support the development of R7 photoreceptor cells in a genetically sensitized background (15Karlovich C.A. Bonfini L. McCollam L. Rogge R.D. Daga A. Czech M.P. Banerjee U.

These results are consistent with the possibility that a membrane localization region exists in Sos apart from the C-terminal proline-rich domain.A logical candidate for this potential membrane binding region is the PH domain of Sos. Pleckstrin contains N-terminal and C-terminal repeats of about 100 amino acids (17Tyers M. Rachubinski R.A. Stewart M.I. Varrichio A.M. Shoo R.G.L. Haslam R. Harley C.B. Nature. 1988; 333: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) that have been found in a large number of proteins including GTPase-activating proteins, tyrosine or serine/threonine kinases, kinase substrates, structural and regulatory elements of the cytoskeleton, and phospholipases (18Musacchio A. Gibson T. Rice P. Thompson J. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). A number of ligands for the PH domains have been reported including βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (19Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and protein kinase C (20Yao L. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9175-9179Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The PH domains of several proteins (pleckstrin, spectrin, and phospholipase C-δ1) have been shown to interact in vitro with phospholipid vesicles containing PI(4,5)P2 and/or its soluble head group Ins(1,4,5)P3 (21Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 22Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B.

A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), although only the phospholipase C-δ1 PH domain has thus far shown a high affinity association with phospholipids.In this study, we demonstrate that the isolated PH domain of mSos1 binds PI(4,5)P2 with high affinity and specificity. Our results are consistent with the idea that Sos localization may be facilitated by the interaction of its PH domain with the plasma membrane.RESULTSThe observation that the PH domain of Sos has a functional role in vivo (14Wang W. Fisher E.M.C. Jia Q. Dunn J.M. Porfiri E. Downward J. Egan S.E. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Karlovich C.A. Bonfini L. McCollam L. Rogge R.D. Daga A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15954-15957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and may be involved in membrane association led us to test the ability of this domain to interact with PI derivatives in vitro. For this purpose, the PH domain of mSos1 was expressed as a GST fusion protein in bacteria, containing residues 392-552 of mSos1. Previous studies have shown that a positively charged face of PH domains is critical for binding PI(4,5)P2 (26Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Hajduk P.J. Fesik S.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9859-9864Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To assess whether the mSos1 PH domain has basic residues that might be involved in phospholipid binding, the amino acids spanning β strands 1 and 2 of PH domains of known structure were aligned with the corresponding region of the mSos1 PH domain ((18); Fig. 1). Conserved lysine or arginine residues, previously shown to be involved in interacting with the 4- and 5-monoesters of PI(4,5)P2, were identified in the mSos1 PH domain.Specific Binding of the mSos1 PH Domain to PI(4,5)P2To investigate the interaction of the mSos1 PH domain with phospholipids, the GST-mSos1 PH fusion protein was purified and digested with thrombin to release the PH domain. The digestion mixture was then incubated with sucrose-loaded unilamellar vesicles, containing 5% PI(4,5)P2/95% PC, which were then subjected to a centrifugation assay. Following centrifugation, the supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as shown in (Fig. 2A). When the concentration of PI(4,5)P2 was held at 20 μM, the majority of the mSos1 PH domain was found in the pellet, indicating an association with the phospholipid vesicles. Consistent with this observation, the supernatant of this sample showed a corresponding decrease in the amount of the mSos1 PH domain, in comparison with control samples. In contrast, no mSos1 PH domain was pelleted with vesicles composed exclusively of the neutral phospholipid PC or with vesicles containing 5% PS, another negatively charged phospholipid. The GST moiety released by thrombin cleavage, which served as an internal control, remained in the supernatant in every case and showed no binding to any of the phospholipids tested. These results show that the mSos1 PH domain binds specifically to phospholipid vesicles containing a phosphoinositide.Fig. 2A, binding of PH domain of mSos1 to phospholipid vesicles. A Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel of the PH domain of mSos1 digested from GST with thrombin. GST was not removed after digestion and served as an internal control. The total amount of protein used was 0.1 mg/ml in an incubation volume of 250 μl. The total concentration of lipid used was 0.8 mg/ml. Pelleted vesicles were resuspended in (null)/1;5 the total volume of the supernatant and were five times more concentrated with respect to supernatant. B, interaction of the GST-PH fusion protein with various phospholipid vesicles as assayed by centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine whether the mSos1 PH domain showed preferential binding to specific phosphoinositides, we tested the ability of the intact GST-PH domain fusion protein to bind phospholipid vesicles containing either PI(3,4,5)P3, PI(4)P, or PI. As shown in Fig. 2B, the GST fusion protein was detected in pelleted phospholipid vesicles containing PI(4,5)P2 and to a much smaller degree in association with vesicles containing PI(4)P. No mSos1 PH domain fusion protein was detected in association with vesicles that contained PI(3,4,5)P3, PI, or PS. These data suggest that the isolated mSos1 PH domain shows a specific interaction with PI(4,5)P2 and binds weakly to PI(4)P. Again, GST alone showed no interaction with any of the phospholipid vesicles tested (Fig. 2B).Right Angle Light Scattering of GST-PH Bound Unilamellar VesiclesTo further examine the interaction of the PH domain of mSos1 with phospholipid vesicles, light scattering was used, as has been previously employed for other lipid binding proteins (29Cote H.C.F. Stevens W.K. Bajzar L. Banfield D.K. Nesheim M.E. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11374-11380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Right angle light scattering is a very sensitive method for measuring protein-lipid interactions and is dependent on the molecular weight of the measured particle. Therefore, the intensity of light scattering should increase upon association of a protein with a phospholipid vesicle. The increments in scattering intensity upon the addition of the GST-PH domain to various phospholipid vesicles are shown in Fig. 3A. The mSos1 PH domain interacted specifically with phospholipid vesicles containing 5% PI(4,5)P2, as demonstrated by an increase in scattering intensity of about 50% upon the addition of the GST-PH fusion protein. Little, if any, association was observed with vesicles containing other phospholipids (Fig. 3A). The fusion protein itself induced an increase of about 5 intensity units (data not shown), which explains the small but consistent increases in intensity observed for other phospholipids, notably vesicles containing 100% PC or 5% PI. A slightly greater increase was observed for vesicles containing 20% PS or 5% PI(3,4,5)P3 or PI(4)P, indicating that negatively charged lipids do exhibit a weak interaction with the PH domain of mSos1. However, this interaction was not nearly as significant as that observed for PI(4,5)P2. GST itself, when titrated with PI(4,5)P2 containing phospholipids, showed no increase in light scattering intensity (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3Light scattering intensity in response to GST-PH mSos1 binding to vesicles containing PI(4,5)P2 and competition by Ins(1,4,5)P3. A, the increments in light scattering observed upon the addition of GST-PH fusion protein (20 μg of GST-PH domain of mSos1 fusion protein corresponds to 1xGST-PH) to a solution of various phospholipid vesicles. B, protein dependence of light scattering intensity increases upon GST-PH domain interaction with PI(4,5)P2-containing vesicles and competition by increasing amounts of Ins(1,4,5)P3. To 2-ml volume of Buffer A containing 20 μg/ml of phospholipid vesicles with 5% PI(4,5)P2 was added GST-PH domain of mSos1 fusion protein at the concentrations indicated. Ins(1,4,5)P3 (Sigma) dissolved in Buffer A at a concentration of 2 mM was aliquoted into the cuvette, resulting in the final concentrations as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3B shows the effect on scattering intensity of adding the GST-PH fusion protein in increasing concentrations to a fixed amount of PI(4,5)P2-containing phospholipid vesicles. Saturation started to become apparent at about 4 μM, indicative of a binary interaction between the PH domain of mSos1 and PI(4,5)P2. This increase in right angle light scattering could be competed away completely by Ins(1,4,5)P3, at a concentration of 30 μM (Fig. 3B).Quantitation of Binding of Wild Type and Mutant mSos1 PH Domains to PI(4,5)P2The ability of the mSos1 PH domain to bind sucrose-loaded unilamellar vesicles containing varying concentrations of PI(4,5)P2 was quantitated using the ultracentrifugation assay. We also assessed the involvement of two basic residues of the mSos1 PH domain, Arg452 and Arg459, in the recognition of PI(4,5)P2 by expressing GST-PH domain fusion proteins in which either or both of these residues were substituted with Ala. The wild type PH domain of mSos1 bound tightly to PI(4,5)P2 containing phospholipid vesicles, with a Kd of 1.8 ± 0.4 μM (Table I). These results suggest that the isolated wild type mSos1 PH domain shows a relatively high affinity for PI(4,5)P2, in comparison with other PH domains. Surprisingly, the R452A mutant mSos1 PH domain exhibited only a slight decrease in its affinity to PI(4,5)P2, displaying a Kd of 5.1 ± 0.7 μM. However, the R459A mutant displayed a greater than 20-fold loss in binding affinity for PI(4,5)P2, indicating that it has a much reduced affinity for PI(4,5)P2, and the double R452A/R459A mutant showed a further decrease in affinity.Table I.Binding affinities of wild type and mutant PH domains of mSos1 to PI(4,5)P2PH domainKd± S.D.aS.D. is standard deviation for determination of the parameter Kd, estimated by fitting Equation 1 to the binding data.μMWild type1.8 ± 0.4R452A5.1 ± 0.7R459A79 ± 19R452A/R459A87 ± 22mSos153 ± 7bStandard error as calculated from three independent binding experiments using Equation 2.mSos1/Grb269 ± 19bStandard error as calculated from three independent binding experiments using Equation 2.a S.D. is standard deviation for determination of the parameter Kd, estimated by fitting Equation 1 to the binding data.b Standard error as calculated from three independent binding experiments using Equation 2. Open table in a new tab To determine if these substitutions had caused any drastic conformational changes, the folding of the wild type and mutant PH domains was investigated by circular dichroism. CD measurements indicated that the secondary structure contents of the GST-PH domain R452A, R459A, and the R452A/R459A mutants were identical to that of the wild type protein (data not shown). Therefore, these substitutions did not cause any gross structural perturbation, suggesting that the decreased affinity of the R459A mutant PH domain for PI(4,5)P2 is likely due to a specific effect on phospholipid binding rather than a general effect on the overall structure of the PH domain.Binding of Full-length mSos1 and a mSos1-Grb2 Complex to PI(4,5)P2Full-length mSos1, purified from baculovirus infected Hi5 cells (24Chook Y.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30472-30478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), was tested for its ability to bind various phospholipid vesicles. mSos1 demonstrated a specific interaction with PI(4,5)P2-containing vesicles (data not shown), albeit at lower affinity than that exhibited by the GST-PH domain fusion protein (Kd 53 ± 7 μM, Table I). Because mSos1 is found constitutively bound to Grb2 in vivo, we tested the ability of a heterodimeric complex containing full-length mSos1 and Grb2 to bind phospholipids. The purified mSos1-Grb2 complex demonstrated a specific interaction with PI(4,5)P2-containing vesicles (Fig. 4) with an affinity similar to that of mSos1 itself (69 ± 19 μM, Table I). The addition of a phosphopeptide modeled on the Shc Tyr317 phosphorylation site that binds with high affinity to the Grb2 SH2 domain did not influence binding of the mSos1-Grb2 complex to PI(4,5)P2.Fig. 4Full-length mSos1-Grb2 complex was incubated with various phospholipid vesicles and assayed for phospholipid binding by ultracentrifugation. A Coomassie Blue-stained 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel of the mSos1-Grb2 complex incubated with phospholipid vesicles pelleted after ultracentrifugation, as in Fig. 2. The phospholipid-bound mSos1 and Grb2 are shown separately. The concentration of mSos1/Grb2 used was 5 μM, whereas the phospholipid vesicles were present at a concentration of 0.8 mg/ml.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It has been noted that SH2 domains can interact with phosphoinositides (25Rameh L.E. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the binding of Grb2 to the various phospholipids used in this study. Neither Grb2 purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells nor a GST-Grb2 fusion protein expressed in E. coli displayed any detectable interaction with the various phospholipids using ultracentrifugation and analysis of phospholipid vesicles.DISCUSSIONThe results presented in this study demonstrate that the PH domain of mSos1 binds to PI(4,5)P2 with high affinity and specificity.

It is difficult to compare the Kd value obtained for the mSos1 PH domain with those obtained on other pleckstrin domains, because the number of lipid binding sites are dependent on the composition and the size of the phospholipid vesicles. However, the affinity of the mSos1 PH for domain for PI(4,5)P2 appears to be sufficient to contribute to the localization of the full-length mSos1 to the membrane.The apparent Kd for binding of the mSos1 PH domain to PI(4,5)P2 is greater than that reported for the pleckstrin N-terminal PH domain (1.8 versus 30 μM (21Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), respectively) and of the same order of magnitude as reported for the phospholipase C-δ1 PH domain (∼1.7 μM; (23Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M.

Petrova V. McLaughlin S. Rebecchi M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16228-16234Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar)). However, the mSos1 PH domain does not share the high affinity of the phospholipase C-δ1 PH domain for the soluble inositol phosphate, Ins(1,4,5)P3 (note Fig. 3B). For phospholipase C-δ1, it has been suggested that interaction of its PH domain with PI(4,5)P2 at the membrane surface allows the enzyme to hydrolyze its substrate in a processive manner and that the tight interaction of the reaction product Ins(1,4,5)P3 could remove this anchor and reduce catalytic efficiency (23Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M.

Apparently, this type of inhibition by Ins(1,4,5)P3 is unlikely to be involved in the dissociation of the mSos1 PH domain from the membrane surface. There have been several examples of PH domains binding to PI(4,5)P2 and Ins(1,4,5)P3 with different affinities (21Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 23Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4676-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), although various protein structures suggest that these domains do not directly interact with the acyl chains within the lipid membranes. Neutron diffraction experiments with PI(4)P/PC mixed membranes demonstrate that the head group inositol is inclined at an angle to the bilayer, perhaps due to electrostatic interaction of the negatively charged 4-phosphate with the trimethyl ammonium moiety of PC (33Bradshaw J.P. Bushby R.J. Giles C.C.D. Saunders M.R. Reid D.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, it may be possible that the phosphorylated inositol head groups bound to acyl chains present in a lipid membrane adopt different orientations than that of the soluble inositol triphosphate. In any case, the binding of Ins(1,4,5)P3 to the mSos1 PH domain has no clear biological function. It may be possible for Ins(1,4,5)P3 to compete with PI(4,5)P2 for the PH domain, although it seems unlikely that concentrations of Ins(1,4,5)P3 in living cells would reach the levels required to displace mSos1 (27Garcia P.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16228-16234Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), unless local concentrations of Ins(1,4,5)P3 can reach levels of 10 μM or higher.A number of recent studies have shown that PH domains have distinct structural characteristics (21Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 22Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Indeed, the Shc and IRS-1 phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains have recently been demonstrated to share the same fold as PH domains (28Zhou M.-M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.T. Petros A.M.

Cell. 1996; 85: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The PI(4,5)P2 binding site in the N-terminal PH domain of pleckstrin has been identified (21Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) at the lip of the β-barrel in the N-terminal half of the domain. Two residues found to be important for this interaction were Lys13 and Lys22 (26Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Hajduk P.J. Fesik S.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9859-9864Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The corresponding amino acids within the PH domain of mSos1 are Arg452 and Arg459 (18Musacchio A. Gibson T. Rice P. Thompson J. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). We have identified Arg459 of mSos1 as being critical for the strong interaction of this protein's PH domain with PI(4,5)P2 in vitro. This residue is analogous to the Arg28 residue of the Btk PH domain (18Musacchio A. Gibson T. Rice P. Thompson J. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), whose functional significance has been demonstrated by its mutation to cysteine in XID mice (35Thomas J.D. Sideras P. Smith C.I.E. Vorechovsky I. Chapman V. Paul W.E. Science. 1993; 261: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 36Rawlings D.J. Saffran D.C. Tsukada S. Largaespada D.A. Grimaldi J.C. Cohen L. Mohr R.N. Bazan J.F. Howard M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Witte O.N. Science. 1993; 261: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). The finding that substituting Arg452 with Ala has only a small effect on binding could be interpreted as indicating that this residue does not form an ionic interaction with the negatively charged Ins(1,4,5)P3 or alternatively that a compensatory mechanism occurs upon substitution of Arg452 that replaces the lost interaction.The weaker interactions of the full-length mSos1 and mSos1-Grb2 complex compared with that of the isolated PH domain are interesting. It is tempting to speculate that a cellular factor is required to allow the PH domain of mSos1 to interact efficiently with PI(4,5)P2, which may thereby regulate mSos localization and function. Unlike some other SH2 domains (25Rameh L.E. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), Grb2 showed no interaction with the phospholipids tested in this study.The role of these postulated protein-membrane interactions could be, as proposed previously for the Grb2/mSos1 interaction, mainly to localize of the enzyme (mSos1) to its substrate (Ras). However, formation of protein-phospholipid binary complexes also could increase subsequent reaction rates by limiting the dimensions required for translational diffusion. This could effectively increase the frequency of productive collisions between membrane-bound proteins by reducing the possible orientations of the reacting species. Thus, requiring that the complex between mSos1 and Ras forms on the plasma membrane surface could be a means to achieve the rapid amplification of signaling through the mSos1/Ras pathway, as well as providing a mechanism to modulate mSos activity by controlling its subcellular localization.In addition to phospholipid interaction, it has been suggested that another possible function of PH domains is to bind to Gβγ subunits (19Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies using human Sos1 failed to show saturable binding to Gβγ subunits (37Mahadevan D. Thanki N. Singh J. McPhie P. Zangrilli D. Wang L.-M. Guerrero C. Le Vine III, H. Humblet C. Saldanha J. Gutkind J.S. Najmabadi-Haske T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9111-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that as with βARK PH domain (38Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), PI(4,5)P2 interaction with the mSos1 PH domain may mediate or synergize with the interaction of this domain with Gβγ subunits or with some as yet unidentified protein ligand.In conclusion, we have shown that there is a strong interaction of the PH domain of mSos1 to PI(4,5)P2 in vitro and that this interaction can be competed away by Ins(1,4,5)P3. The native mSos1-Grb2 complex also bound PI(4,5)P2, albeit more weakly than the isolated PH domain. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved basic residues within the PH domain of mSos1 has demonstrated that Arg459 plays a critical role in mediating this interaction with PI(4,5)P2. INTRODUCTIONGuanine nucleotide exchange factors catalyze the conversion of Ras from its inactive GDP state to an active GTP-bound state, leading to the activation of downstream effectors (1McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). A Ras-guanine nucleotide exchange factor specifically implicated in tyrosine kinase signaling is Sos, which was first identified in Drosophila (2Simon M.A. Bowtell D.D. Dodson G.S. Laverty T.R. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1991; 67: 701-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 3Bonfini L. Karlovich C.A. Dasgupta C. Banerjee U. Science. 1992; 255: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar); subsequently two mammalian homologues have been described, mSos1 (murine form of the son-of-sevenless 1) and mSos2 (4Bowtell D. Fu P. Simon M. Senior P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6511-6515Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Sos is a large protein (∼150 kDa) that consists of an N-terminal region, with a Dbl homology domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) 1The abbreviations used are: PHpleckstrin homologyPI(4,5)P2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphatePI(4)Pphosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphatePI(3,4,5)P3phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphateIns(1,4,5)inositol 1,4,5-triphosphatePIphosphatidylinositolPCphoshpatidylcholinePSphosphatidylserineGSTglutathione S-transferase. domain, a catalytic region that is responsible for the protein's guanine nucleotide exchange activity, and a C-terminal proline-rich tail with binding sites for the SH3 domains of the Grb2 adaptor protein.Because Ras is membrane-associated, activation of Sos may involve a change in Sos subcellular localization from the cytosol to the membrane, where it can gain access to GDP-bound Ras (1McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 4Bowtell D. Fu P. Simon M. Senior P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been observed that targeting of mSos1 to the plasma membrane is sufficient for the activation of the Ras signaling pathway, consistent with the notion that mSos1 is active when situated at the membrane (6Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. Al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 7Quilliam L.A. Huff S.Y. Rabun K.M. Wei W. Park W. Broek D. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8512-8516Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). One possibility is that the association of mSos1 with the SH3 domains of Grb2 may serve to modify mSos1 localization upon growth factor stimulation through interaction of the Grb2 SH2 domain with the tyrosine phosphate of activated growth factor receptors (8Gale N.W. Kaplan S. Lowenstein E.J. Schlessinger J. Bar-Sagi D. Nature. 1993; 363: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 9Li N. Batzer A. Daly R. Yajnik V. Skolnik E. Chardin P. Bar-Sagi D.

Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Science. 1993; 260: 1953-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar).Recent evidence has raised the possibility that the interactions of Grb2 SH3 domains with the C-terminal tail of mSos1 proteins may have more complex functions than simple relocalization and conversely has suggested that other regions of mSos1 may be involved in membrane targeting. Deletion of the mSos1 C-terminal region yields an mSos1 variant that transforms Rat1 cells (14Wang W. Fisher E.M.C. Jia Q. Dunn J.M. Porfiri E. Downward J. Egan S.E. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Similarly, Drosophila Sos constructs lacking the proline-rich region are able to support the development of R7 photoreceptor cells in a genetically sensitized background (15Karlovich C.A. Bonfini L. McCollam L. Rogge R.D. Daga A. Czech M.P. Banerjee U.

These results are consistent with the possibility that a membrane localization region exists in Sos apart from the C-terminal proline-rich domain.A logical candidate for this potential membrane binding region is the PH domain of Sos. Pleckstrin contains N-terminal and C-terminal repeats of about 100 amino acids (17Tyers M. Rachubinski R.A. Stewart M.I. Varrichio A.M. Shoo R.G.L. Haslam R. Harley C.B. Nature. 1988; 333: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) that have been found in a large number of proteins including GTPase-activating proteins, tyrosine or serine/threonine kinases, kinase substrates, structural and regulatory elements of the cytoskeleton, and phospholipases (18Musacchio A. Gibson T. Rice P. Thompson J. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). A number of ligands for the PH domains have been reported including βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (19Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and protein kinase C (20Yao L. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9175-9179Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The PH domains of several proteins (pleckstrin, spectrin, and phospholipase C-δ1) have been shown to interact in vitro with phospholipid vesicles containing PI(4,5)P2 and/or its soluble head group Ins(1,4,5)P3 (21Harlan J.E.

Our results are consistent with the idea that Sos localization may be facilitated by the interaction of its PH domain with the plasma membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2036064716,"Protein-tyrosine kinases, such as HER-2/ErbB-2, have been specifically linked to breast cancer. The Csk-homologous kinase (CHK), formerly MATK, is a tyrosine kinase that contains the Src homology 2 and 3 (SH2 and SH3) domains and demonstrates homology (∼50%) to the Csk tyrosine kinase. Like Csk, CHK is able to phosphorylate and inactivate Src family kinases. In this report, we investigated whether CHK is expressed in breast cancer tissues and whether it participates in the ErbB-2 signaling pathway in T47D and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. Immunostaining of the CHK protein in breast tissues demonstrated that primary invasive ductal carcinomas, stage II (13 of 15 cases) and stage I (8 of 15 cases), expressed the CHK protein, while this protein was not detected in the adjacent normal tissues from the same patients. To study the role of CHK in the ErbB-2 signaling pathway, glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing the SH2 and SH3 domains of CHK were generated. CHK-SH2 and CHK-SH3-SH2, but not CHK-SH3 or CHK-NH2-SH3, precipitated the tyrosine-phosphorylated ErbB-2 upon stimulation with heregulin. EGF or interleukin-6 stimulation of T47D cells failed to induce CHK-SH2 association with ErbB-2, the EGF-receptor, or the interleukin-6 receptor.

Protein-tyrosine kinases are involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. The binding of a ligand to the extracellular domain of a cognate receptor protein-tyrosine kinase induces receptor dimerization, stimulation of intrinsic kinase activity, and autophosphorylation.

Several ligands that bind to and stimulate the kinase activity of the ErbB family members have been identified and are classified as EGF-like ligands. EGF, HB-EGF, amphiregulin, betacellulin, epiregulin, and transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) are the ligands for the EGF-R (ErbB-1) (15Cohen B.D. Green J.M. Foy L. Fell H.P. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 345-353PubMed Google Scholar). Although none of these factors bind directly to ErbB-2, both EGF and HRG induce its tyrosine phosphorylation, presumably by ligand-driven heterodimerization and cross-phosphorylation (15Cohen B.D.

Here we report that CHK is expressed in human breast cancer but not in adjacent normal breast tissues. Our studies of CHK signaling in breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and T47D demonstrated in vivo interaction between CHK and activated ErbB-2 upon HRG stimulation. This interaction occurred via the SH2 domain of CHK and was ligand-specific (HRG) and receptor-specific (ErbB-2). This study provides new insights into the regulatory pathways in neoplastic breast tissues. Recombinant heregulin (rHRGβ1, 177-244), rabbit polyclonal anti-ErbB-2 antibodies, and 3E8 monoclonal anti-ErbB-2 antibodies, were obtained from Genentech, Inc. (San Francisco, CA) (58Levi A.D. Bunge R.P. Lofgren J.A. Meima L. Hefti F. Nikolics K. Sliwkowski M.X. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1329-1340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EGF and IL-6 were purchased from Collaborative Biomedical Products (Bedford, MA) and from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), respectively. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was obtained from Zymed, Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Polyclonal antibodies for EGF-R, ErbB-3, ErbB-4, and polyclonal anti-CHK (anti-LSK) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-GST monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. GST fusion proteins containing the NH2-SH2 domain of p85 PI 3-kinase and the SH2-SH2-SH3 domains of phospholipase C-γ1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The primers for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were synthesized by an automated DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems model 394). Reagents for electrophoresis were obtained from Bio-Rad. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were purchased from Amersham Corp. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on paraffin-embedded 5-μm-thick tissue sections of human breast cancer. Sections were deparaffinized in xylene and then incubated in decreasing concentrations of ethyl alcohol. After several rinses in water, the slides were incubated in methanol/hydrogen peroxide (1:4) and briefly rinsed in water and then in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.6). Subsequent immunohistochemical staining was performed using a 1:100 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline of rabbit anti-CHK antisera (1-h incubation) followed by the addition of the secondary antibodies, peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) at 50 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline. The T47D and MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD). T47D cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 3.5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma). The MCF-7 cells were grown in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 1 mM nonessential amino acids, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. Prior to stimulation with HRG, EGF, or IL-6, cells were starved overnight in media containing 1% fetal bovine serum and then for 4 h in serum-free medium. The CHK cDNA (1.6 kilobase pairs) was cloned into EcoRI sites in the pCDNA3-neo vector. The nucleotide sequence for the Flag epitope (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) was introduced to the 5¹ end of the open reading frame of the CHK cDNA sequence by PCR, using a 1.6-kilobase pair CHK cDNA as a template. The 5¹ sense primer included a BamHI restriction site, ATG initiation codon, the Flag sequence, and CHK sequences from nucleotides 269-295 (43Bennett B.D. Cowley S. Jiang S. London R. Deng B. Grabarek J. Groopman J.E. Goeddel D.V. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1068-1074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3¹-antisense primer was composed of CHK sequences from nucleotides 510-481 (43Bennett B.D. Cowley S. Jiang S. London R. Deng B. Grabarek J. Groopman J.E. Goeddel D.V. Avraham H. J. Biol.

The PCR product was double digested with BamHI and BstEII (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA), gel-purified, and then cloned into BamHI and BstEII sites in the pcDNA3-neo-Flag-CHK. The construct was analyzed by restriction mapping and nucleotide sequencing. Transfection of MCF-7 cells was performed using the Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The transfected cells were selected in 1.2 mg/ml G418 (Sigma). Positive transfectants were chosen based on their immunoreactivity on Western blots probed with polyclonal anti-CHK and monoclonal anti-Flag (M5) antibodies (Eastman Kodak Co.). To express the NH2-SH3 and SH3-SH2 domains of CHK as GST fusion proteins, the corresponding DNA sequences were amplified by PCR with sense and antisense primers of CHK cDNA, which contained BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. For the NH2-SH3 construct, we used the sense primer from nucleotides 4-27 and the antisense primer from nucleotides 343-321 (43Bennett B.D. Cowley S. Jiang S. London R. Deng B. Grabarek J. Groopman J.E. Goeddel D.V. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1068-1074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the SH3-SH2 construct, we used the sequences from nucleotides 127-150 as the sense primer and from nucleotides 657-634 as the antisense primer (43Bennett B.D. Cowley S. Jiang S. London R. Deng B.

The DNA fragments obtained from PCR were restriction-digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into the pGEX-2T vector (Pharmacia). The sequence and orientation were confirmed by sequencing both strands. Construction of the GST fusion proteins of CHK-SH2 and CHK-SH3 was described previously (45Jhun B.H. Rivnay B. Price D. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9661-9666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were produced by the induction of transformed bacteria using 10 mM isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside and purified on a large scale by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pharmacia). In order to detect the binding of other proteins to CHK GST fusion proteins, approximately 5 x 106 cells/plate were starved overnight in media containing 1% fetal bovine serum, followed by additional starvation in serum-free medium for 4 h at 37°C. The starved cells were then stimulated with 10 nM HRG for 8 min or with 100 ng/ml EGF or 100 ng/ml IL-6 for 5 min at room temperature. The stimulation was terminated by the addition of an ice-cold lysis buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, in Tris-buffered saline containing 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM Na3VO4, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mM leupeptin) (58Levi A.D. Bunge R.P. Lofgren J.A. Meima L. Hefti F. Nikolics K. Sliwkowski M.X. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1329-1340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were precleared by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 15 min) and then incubated for 90 min at 4°C with 10 μg of GST fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer. For the immunoprecipitation experiments, polyclonal anti-CHK antibody (10 μl), monoclonal anti-ErbB-2 antibody, 3E8 (10 μg/ml), polyclonal anti-ErbB-3 antibody (10 μg/ml), or polyclonal anti-ErbB-4 antibody (10 μg/ml) was used. SDS-sample buffer was added to the samples and analyzed on 7% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose or Immobilon-P™ (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) membranes. Bound proteins were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20), polyclonal anti-ErbB-2 antibody, or polyclonal anti-CHK, EGF-R, ErbB-3, or ErbB-4 antibodies. The blots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham). Blots were stripped for 30 min at 55°C in stripping buffer (100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7), according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham). Analyses of CHK expression in human breast cancer tissues were performed on paraffin sections derived from 12 breast cancer patients using immunohistochemistry. CHK protein was found in 13 of 15 invasive ductal carcinomas, stage II, and in 8 of 15 stage I carcinomas (Fig. 1), while no CHK was detected in the adjacent normal tissues from the same patients. Following our observation that CHK was expressed in human breast cancer tissues, we have investigated whether CHK might be involved in one of the main signaling pathways in breast cancer mediated by the ErbB family receptors. Experiments were performed using the T47D breast cancer cell line and the GST fusion protein containing the SH2 domain of CHK (CHK-SH2). T47D cells express the ErbB family receptors and the CHK protein as observed by immunohistochemistry (data not shown). T47D cells were starved overnight in 1% fetal calf serum in RPMI 1640 and then incubated in serum-free medium for 4 h. The starved cells were then stimulated with HRG (10 nM) for the indicated times (Fig. 2). Cells were lysed, and the supernatants were incubated with the purified CHK-SH2 fusion protein (Fig. 2, A and B) or with the 3E8 monoclonal antibody to ErbB-2 (Fig. 2, C and D). The co-precipitated proteins were analyzed on 7% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with PY20 (Fig. 2, A and C). As shown in Fig. 2A, a tyrosine-phosphorylated 185-kDa protein was associated with CHK-SH2 within 2 min of the HRG stimulation. The association of the 185-kDa protein with CHK-SH2 was maximal at 2-8 min after HRG stimulation and then gradually decreased. In order to determine whether the 185-kDa protein was ErbB-2, the blot was deprobed and reblotted with polyclonal anti-ErbB-2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B, the 185-kDa protein was confirmed to be the ErbB-2 protein. These results indicated that the CHK protein can interact with the HRG-activated ErbB-2 receptor. When lysates from HRG-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with the 3E8 monoclonal anti-ErbB-2 antibody, the pattern of the phosphorylated ErbB-2 was different from that of the ErbB-2 precipitated with the SH2 domain of CHK (compare Fig. 2C with Fig. 2A). Blotting of the same samples with the polyclonal anti-ErbB-2 antibody (Fig. 2D) confirmed these observations. Thi"
https://openalex.org/W2062008959,"Previous work has shown that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and oltipraz both induce an unidentified rat liver UDP-glucuronosyltransferase with activity toward benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-diol, the proximate carcinogenic form of benzo(a)pyrene. Here we report the isolation of a benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-diol transferase-encoding cDNA, LC14, from an adult rat hepatocyte-derived cell line (RALA255-10G LCS-3). The predicted amino acid sequence of LC14 is nearly identical (5 differences out of 531 residues) to that deduced from UGT1A7, recently cloned at the genomic DNA level (Emi, Y., Ikushiro, S., and Kyanagi, T. (1995) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 117, 392-399). Northern analysis of RNA from female F344 rat liver and LCS-3 cells revealed over a 40-fold and 4.4-fold enhancement by oltipraz treatment, respectively. Benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-diol glucuronidating activity was detected (0.4 nmol/106 cells/16 h) in AHH-1 cells transfected with the LC14 expression vector, pMF6-LC14-3. The LC14-encoded transferase exhibited even higher activity toward certain benzo(a)pyrene phenols, including the major 3- and 9-phenol metabolites (4.1 and 2.8 nmol/106 cells/16 h, respectively). The Km of the enzyme for (−)-trans benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-diol and 3-OH-BP was 15.5 and 12.3 μM, respectively. Northern analyses of total RNA revealed expression of LC14 or LC14-like RNA in all extrahepatic tissues tested. Marked inducibility by oltipraz was observed only in liver and (to a lesser extent) intestine. The results suggest that induction of UGT1A7 may explain the increased glucuronidating activities toward benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-diol and other metabolites that occur following treatment with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-type inducing agents and oltipraz. UGT1A7 appears to represent an important cellular chemoprotective enzyme which mediates conjugation and elimination of toxic benzo(a)pyrene metabolites. Previous work has shown that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and oltipraz both induce an unidentified rat liver UDP-glucuronosyltransferase with activity toward benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-diol, the proximate carcinogenic form of benzo(a)pyrene.

Benzo(a)pyrene, a prototypic PAH 1The abbreviations used are: PAHspolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)UGTUDP-glucuronosyltransferaseBPDtrans-benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol3-OH-BP3-hydroxybenzo(a)pyreneMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidbpbase pair(s). found widespread in the environment, causes cancer in laboratory animals and is a suspected human carcinogen (1International Agency for Research on Cancer, (1983) Polynuclear Aromatic Compounds, Part 1: Chemical, Environmental, and Experimental Data, IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of the Carcinogenic Risk of Chemicals to Humans, IARC, Lyon, FranceGoogle Scholar). It is well established that the cancer causing effects of benzo(a)pyrene are dependent upon its metabolism to reactive cytotoxic and genotoxic metabolites (2Thakker D.R. Yagi H. Levin W. Wood A.W. Conney A.H. Jerina D.M. Anders M.W. Bioactivation of Foreign Compounds. Academic Press, New York1985: 178-242Google Scholar, 3Burke M.D. Vadi H. Jernström B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6424-6431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The metabolism of benzo(a)pyrene to an array of phenols, quinones, diols, and diol epoxides has been well documented (2Thakker D.R. Yagi H. Levin W. Wood A.W. Conney A.H. Jerina D.M. Anders M.W. Bioactivation of Foreign Compounds. Academic Press, New York1985: 178-242Google Scholar). Although there is the possibility that several of these contribute to the carcinogenic insult, it is generally appreciated that formation of benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide, a highly potent DNA-binding metabolite, is an important event in the initiation of tissue neoplasms. Benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide is formed by two rounds of oxidative metabolism, with BPD as an intermediate. In addition to its undergoing cytochrome P450- or peroxidase-catalyzed bioactivation to benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide, BPD also undergoes metabolism by competing alternate pathways to form less toxic metabolites, for example, oxidation by dihydrodiol dehydrogenase to form benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-dione (4Penning T.M.

The protective effect of UGTs against toxicity mediated by benzo(a)pyrene has been demonstrated in several studies (8Hu Z. Wells P.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 263: 334-342PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hu Z. Wells P.G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1994; 127: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 10Vienneau D.S. DeBoni U. Wells P.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1045-1051PubMed Google Scholar). Reduced glucuronidation of benzo(a)pyrene derivatives in UGT-deficient homozygous j/j and heterozygous j/+ RHA rats in vivo correlated with increased covalent binding to hepatic DNA and microsomal protein compared to UGT-normal congenic RHA +/+ controls (8Hu Z. Wells P.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 263: 334-342PubMed Google Scholar). The correlation could also be demonstrated in vitro after incubations of benzo(a)pyrene with liver microsomes (8Hu Z. Wells P.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 263: 334-342PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hu Z. Wells P.G. Toxicol. Appl.

Pharmacol. 1994; 127: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) from the UGT-deficient and UGT-normal animals. In another study, cultures of skin fibroblasts from UGT-deficient Gunn rats exhibited reduced glucuronidation of benzo(a)pyrene metabolites and corresponding enhanced benzo(a)pyrene covalent binding and micronucleus formation (10Vienneau D.S. DeBoni U. Wells P.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1045-1051PubMed Google Scholar). These studies support the hypothesis that the level of UGT-mediated detoxification is an important determinant of cell or tissue susceptibility to toxicities mediated by benzo(a)pyrene (11Bock K.W. Bock-Hennig B.S. Fischer G. Lilienblum W. Ullrich D. Hoechst J. Greim H. Jung R. Kramer M. Marquardt H. Oesch F. Biochemical Basis of Chemical Carcinogenesis.

An important goal in understanding tissue and organism susceptibility to benzo(a)pyrene toxicity is to identify and characterize the enzymes mediating detoxification of benzo(a)pyrene metabolites. In the case of BPD, although it is known that BPD glucuronides are formed in vitro by liver microsomes from rat (8Hu Z. Wells P.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Xenobiotica. 1990; 20: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), little information currently exists regarding the identity of the UGTs responsible for BPD glucuronidation. In a study of four human isoforms (UGT1*6 (a.k.a., UGT1A6), 2According to new guidelines for UGT nomenclature (B. Burchell, P. Mackenzie, I. Owens, R. Tukey, T. Tephly, and D. Nebert, manuscript in preparation). UGT2B7, UGT2B10, and UGT2B11), only UGT2B7 exhibited detectable glucuronidating activity toward BPD (15Jin C.J. Miners J.O. Burchell B. Mackenzie P.I. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 2637-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In another study, none of 5 rat isoforms surveyed (UGT1A6, UGT2B1, UGT2B2, UGT2B3, and UGT2B6) were active in BPD glucuronidation (16Mackenzie P.I. Rodbourn L. Iyanagi T. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1529-1533PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, while it is known that many UGT activities are inducible, few data exist regarding the regulation of BPD UGT. In attempting to classify BPD as a Group 1 (PAH-inducible) or Group 2 (phenobarbital-inducible) substrate, Bock et al. (17Bock K.W. von Clausbruch U.C. Kaufmann R. Lilienblum W. Oesch F. Pfeil H. Platt K.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1980; 29: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) reported that BPD transferase activity was weakly inducible by either inducing agent and concluded that it was not clearly associated with either one of the two substrate groups. Recently we have shown (36Kessler F.K. Ritter J.K. Carcinogenesis. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar) that rats treated with the chemopreventive hepatic enzyme-inducing agent oltipraz (4-methyl-5-pyrazinyl-1,2-dithiole-3-thione) have marked elevations (i.e. up to 10-fold) of liver microsomal BPD UGT activity (18Iyanagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24048-24052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BPD transferase activity was also significantly induced by treatment with β-naphthoflavone, a PAH-type inducing agent, whereas phenobarbital had no effect. These studies suggested that BPD UGT activity was more responsive than was previously thought, that BPD is a Type 1 substrate (i.e. increased predominately by PAH-type inducing agents), and that the gene(s) encoding the responsible isoenzyme(s) are regulated by both PAHs and dithiole thiones. Further studies using Gunn rats which have an inactive UGT1 gene locus (18Iyanagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24048-24052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Roy-Chowdhury J. Huang T. Kesari K. Lederstein M. Arias I.M. Roy-Chowdhury N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18294-18298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the oltipraz-inducible BPD UGT is a UGT1 family member. The objective of this study was to identify the isozyme corresponding to the UGT1-associated, oltipraz-inducible BPD UGT. The strategy used was to prepare and screen a cDNA library prepared from oltipraz-induced RALA255-10G LCS-3 cells for UGT1 cDNAs. RALA255-10G LCS-3 cells, an adult rat liver-derived immortalized cell line, exhibit a high basal BPD transferase activity, which is increased >2-fold by treatment with oltipraz. In contrast to rat liver, a tissue with complex and abundant expression of various transferases from both the UGT1 and UGT2 families, RALA255-10G LCS-3 cells do not express detectable UGT2 family RNAs and have very limited expression of UGT1 subtypes. We, therefore, anticipated that less intensive screening would be required to identify the BPD UGT cDNA. The RALA255-10G LCS-3 cell line was kindly provided by J. Chou (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bethesda, MD). AHH-1 cells and the expression vector pMF6 were kindly provided by Dr. Charles Crespi (Gentest Corp., Woburn, MA). BPD ((−)-trans-isomer) and other benzo(a)pyrene metabolites were from the NCI Carcinogen Repository (Midwest Research Institute). [14C]UDP-glucuronic acid (320 mCi/mmol) was from DuPont NEN. Female F344 rats, 6-8 weeks old (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Raleigh, NC) were treated with either oltipraz (300 mg/kg/day for 2 days) suspended in vehicle (30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 dissolved in water) or vehicle alone. Twenty four h after the final dose, animals were euthanized and total liver RNA was prepared (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63147) Google Scholar). RALA255-10G LCS-3 cells are an SV40 temperature-sensitive tsA255 immortalized adult rat hepatocyte clonal cell line (21Chou J.Y. Schlegel-Haueter S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22Chou J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1013-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Saatcioglu F. Perry D.J.

The line proliferates rapidly when grown at 33°C in α-modified Eagle's medium (1 ×) (Mediatech) and 4% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Salt Lake City, UT) in a 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were trypsinized twice weekly (≈1:8 split ratio). For UGT assays, RALA255-10G LCS-3 cells were trypsinized, centrifuged at 1000 × g (4°C), and washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The washed cells were resuspended in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) to a final density of 1 × 106 cells/43 μl and stored at −70°C. AHH-1 cells were grown in suspension as described (24Davies R.L. Crespi C.L. Rudo K. Turner T.R. Langenbach R. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) using RPMI 1640 containing 9% horse serum and maintaining the cell density between 0.1 and to 0.8 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were collected, washed, resuspended, and stored as described above. Cellular BPD UGT activity was assayed using cells suspended in 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) (1.16 × 106 cells or ∼0.14 mg of total protein/50 μl). Frozen cells were thawed and lysed by three consecutive freeze-thaw cycles (5 min on dry ice and 5 min in a room temperature water bath) followed by brief sonication to disperse aggregates. Aliquots (43 μl) were placed in fresh tubes containing 2 μl of (−)-trans-BPD dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (2.5 mM). UDP-glucuronic acid (150 nmol), containing 0.1 μCi of [14C]UDP-glucuronic acid, was added and reactions were carried out at 37°C. Under these conditions, formation of glucuronide was proportional to cell concentration and the time of incubation. Parallel incubations omitting BPD were performed as reaction blanks. The reaction products were separated by thin layer chromatography as described (14Nemoto N. Gelboin H.V. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1976; 25: 1221-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The zone containing fluorescent product was removed, dissolved in 0.1 ml of concentrated hydrofluoric acid, and counted by liquid scintillation. The counting efficiency was >90%. For qualitative analysis, autoradiographs of plates were generated by spraying the plates with a surface autoradiography enhancer (EN3HANCE™, DuPont NEN) and exposure to x-ray film for 7-14 days. Northern electrophoresis was carried out in gels containing 0.9% agarose, 20 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 8 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.6 M formaldehyde. The RNA was transferred by overnight capillary blotting to a nylon membrane. Blots were cross-linked in a Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and allowed to dry at room temperature for several hours. Plasmids with the rat c-jun and cyclophilin cDNAs were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and Dr. Phillip Hylemon (Medical College of Virginia), respectively. A plasmid containing a fragment of the 5′ unique exon of UGT1A6 (783-bp insert, bases +28 to +810 of the 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible 4-nitrophenol UGT cDNA (25Iyanagi T. Haniu M. Sogawa K.

Chem. 1986; 261: 15607-15614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was generated by polymerase chain reaction-mediated amplification followed by cloning into pBluescript and analysis by restriction mapping. A similar strategy was employed to clone complementary DNA representing the UGT1 common region (pR16E3, 637-bp insert, bases +970 to +1606 of the 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible 4-nitrophenol UGT sequence (25Iyanagi T.

Chen H.-C. Nebert D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15794-15799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Inserts were labeled to >1 × 109 dpm/μg DNA with [α-32P]dCTP using a random priming strategy (27Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). Standard prehybridization and hybridization conditions were used (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Autoradiograms were generated by exposing blots to x-ray film for 2 days at −70°C in cassettes with 32P-intensifying screens. Complementary DNA was synthesized from 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from RALA255-10G LCS-3 cells treated for 24 h with oltipraz (100 μM), using a uniZAP cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene). The library was packaged using Gigapack Gold™λ-phage packaging extract (Stratagene) and plated, yielding >5 × 106 independent phage clones. After amplifying once, a total of 1 × 106 phage were screened using the pR16E3 common region fragment as probe. Fourteen UGT1 positive phages were plaque-purified, amplified, and subjected to the “in vivo excision” reaction as described by Stratagene. Plasmid DNA from each clone was isolated and characterized by restriction analysis. The longest clones were sequenced using Sequenase™ (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The LC14 cDNA was ligated into the SalI site of pMF6 (24Davies R.L. Crespi C.L. Rudo K. Turner T.R. Langenbach R. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Colonies containing plasmid with the LC14 insert in the correct (pMF6-LC14-3) or reverse (pMF6-LC14-23) orientations were selected and amplified. Log phase AHH-1 cells were electroporated with pMF6-LC14-3 or pMF6-LC14-23. Forty-eight h later, transfected cells were selected by addition of hygromycin B (400 μg/ml) to the cultures. A hygromycin B-resistant cell population expressing LC14 under the control of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter was obtained after 3-4 weeks in culture. The cells were assayed for BPD UGT activity as described above. BPD UGT activity was found to be stably expressed for a period of at least 2 months. Glucuronidation activities of LC14-transfected AHH-1 cells toward other benzo(a)pyrene metabolites were determined as described above for BPD UGT. The sensitivity of the products to β-glucuronidase was examined by adjusting the pH of the final reactions to 6.8, incubating with 12.5 units of E. coli Type VII-A β-glucuronidase (Sigma) for 24 h at 37°C, and analyzing the products by silica thin layer chromatography. During studies to evaluate RALA255-10G LCS-3 cells as a model to investigate the UGT gene regulation, we observed that the cells exhibit high basal BPD UGT activity which is increased by treatment with oltipraz. Fig. 1A shows the effect of treatment with 25 or 50 μM oltipraz on BPD UGT activity. These treatments resulted in a 50 and 140% increase, respectively, in the BPD UGT activity compared to control cells. This effect was accompanied by a concentration-dependent increase in total UGT1 family transcripts, assessed by Northern analysis using a pan-probe (pR16E3) directed at the identical 3′ end sequences of UGT1 family mRNAs (Fig. 1B). Quantitation by PhosphorImager analysis revealed increases of 1.6-, 2.1-, and 2.8-fold at 10, 25, and 50 μM oltipraz, respectively. Messenger RNA for NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase, another detoxification enzyme responding to oltipraz (29Egner P.A. Kensler T.W. Prestera T. Talalay P. Libby A.H. Joyner H.H. Curphey T.J. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), was also dose-dependently increased over this range of concentrations (3.1-, 6.1-, and 7.5-fold, respectively). Interestingly, the UGT1A6 mRNA, which is highly responsive in rat liver in vivo, was found to be unaffected in oltipraz treated-RALA255-10G LCS-3 cells. The negative data for the c-jun and cyclophilin mRNAs demonstrate that the effect is not due to different amounts of RNA loaded in each lane. UGT2 transcripts were not detected (data not shown). These differential responses suggest that induction of an unknown UGT1 mRNA correlates with induced BPD UGT activity. To identify the mRNA a λ ZAP cDNA library was constructed from RNA prepared from oltipraz-treated RALA255-10G LCS-3 cells, and the library was screened for UGT1 clones using pR16E3 as probe. UGT1 cDNAs were found to be highly represented in the library (0.15%). Fourteen positives were randomly selected and purified for analysis by restriction endonuclease site mapping, Southern analysis, and terminal nucleotide sequencing. Insert sizes estimated by XhoI-EcoRI digestion ranged between 1100 and 2200 bp. None hybridized with UGT1A6-specific probe. To access inducibility by oltipraz, probes corresponding to the 5′ variable region were prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification, labeled with [32P]dCTP, and hybridized with RNA from vehicle- and oltipraz-treated RALA255-10G LCS-3 cells and rat liver. The data for 4 of these clones is presented in Fig. 2. All clones tested exhibited identical patterns of inducibility, a ≥40-fold increase in vivo but only a 4-fold increase in the cells. The lower magnitude of inducibility in vivo and in vitro is attributable to the presence of higher basal expression in the untreated RALA255-10G LCS-3 cells (compared to control rat liver). Partial nucleotide sequencing of the four clones revealed nucleotide sequence identity at the 5′ terminus. The complete nucleotide sequence of the longest clone, LC14, is presented in Fig. 3. The LC14 insert is 2301-bp in length, and contains 42- and 666-bp 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions flanking the 1596-bp UGT coding region. The transferase encoded by LC14 is 531 amino acids in length, the first 286 of which match the deduced sequence of the UGT1A7 unique exon (referred to previously as UGT1A2) reported by Emi et al. (30Emi Y. Ikushiro S. Iyanagi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) with the exception of 4 differences (LC14/UGT1A7, respectively): Ile6-Val6, Gly104-Ser104, Gly194-Pro194, and Leu284-Val284. Isolation of genomic DNA spanning the UGT1A7/UGT1A6 region of the UGT1 locus and sequencing of the UGT1A7 exon have permitted us to verify the identity of the residues at positions 6 and 104 of the gene as Ile and Gly, respectively. These results indicate correspondence of the LC14 cDNA with the UGT1A7 gene product and suggest that the differences in the sequence reported by Emi et al. (30Emi Y. Ikushiro S. Iyanagi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) are either due to strain variation or possible sequencing errors. To determine whether the UGT encoded by LC14 (UGT1A7) represents a BPD UGT, the LC14 insert was expressed in AHH-1 cells and tested for activity (Fig. 4). Homogenates from cells expressing LC14 in the correct orientation (pMFLC14-3) formed a fluorescent glucuronide with the same relative migration as in the incubation with rat liver microsomes. This product was not visible in reactions with untransfected cells or cells transfected with the cDNA in the reverse orientation (pMFLC14-23). The amount of BPD glucuronide increased linearly for at least 24 h, resulting in 0.4 nmol of glucuronide/106 cells by 24 h (Fig. 5A). A similar time course for 3-OH-BP (Fig. 5B) revealed a ≈20-fold more rapid rate of glucuronidation (3 nmol of glucuronide formed/106 cells/8 h) with linear production of glucuronide up to 8 h. Analysis of the apparent Km by Lineweaver-Burk plots (Fig. 5, C and D) revealed relatively high affinities of the LC14 UGT enzyme for BPD and 3-OH-BP of 15.5 and 12.3 μM, respectively. Since the UGT is active toward 3-OH-BP and is known to be inducible by PAH-type inducing agents, we assessed its activity toward other benzo(a)pyrene monophenols and the 4,5-dihydrodiol (Fig. 6). All metabolites tested were found to be suitable substrates for UGT1A7 with the phenols representing the best substrates. All products required the presence of UDP-glucuronic acid in the reaction (data not shown) and were susceptible to hydrolysis by β-glucuronidase (Fig. 7A). In a representative quantification (Fig. 7B), the radioactivity associated with the 3-OH, 9-OH, and BPD glucuronide products was reduced to background levels by treatment with β-glucuronidase.Fig. 7β-Glucuronidase sensitivity of glucuronides formed from various benzo(a)pyrene metabolites by pMFLC14-3-transfected AHH-1 cells.

These results are shown in Fig. 8. UGT1A7 RNA was undetectable in untreated rat liver and was markedly increased in this tissue by treatment with oltipraz. In contrast, UGT1A7 was constitutively expressed at low levels in the 5 extrahepatic tissues examined. The level of expression was highest in kidney > intestine = lung > spleen = ovary. The only tissue other than liver to exhibit significant (>2-fold) inducibility by oltipraz was intestine. The RNA in ovary was decreased by treatment with oltipraz. To compare the expression of UGT1A7 to UGT1A6, an identical blot was analyzed for UGT1A6 mRNA (Fig. 8). As seen for UGT1A7, UGT1A6 RNA was barely detectable in liver of untreated rats and was dramatically increased by oltipraz treatment. Similarly, UGT1A6 RNA was found to be constitutively expressed in the 5 extrahepatic tissues examined, and the liver and intestine were the only tissues to show signficant oltipraz responsiveness. The relative abundance of the UGT1A6 and UGT1A7 mRNAs in each tissue could not be compared because the probe lengths differed significantly. This study describes the cloning and characterization of an oltipraz-inducible BPD UGT cDNA (LC14) isolated from RALA255-10G LCS-3 cells. It is the first report of a rat liver UGT cDNA encoding activity toward BPD, the key intermediate in the pathway resulting in the bioactivation of benzo(a)pyrene. Two unexpected findings of the study were that: 1) the oltipraz-responsive UGT corresponds to the predicted product of UGT1A7, recently identified as a PAH-responsive gene (30Emi Y. Ikushiro S. Iyanagi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and 2) the “BPD UGT” is widely active toward other benzo(a)pyrene metabolites, particularly the phenols. In view of this broad spectrum glucuronidating activity, it is not surprising that the enzyme is under the control of PAH-type inducers.

https://openalex.org/W2034806010,"The Aspergillus nidulans stcL gene is predicted to encode a cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase and is located within a cluster of other genes that are required for synthesis of sterigmatocystin. Inactivation of stcL resulted in strains that accumulate dihydrosterigmatocystin, a tetrahydrobisfuran containing molecule that is very similar to the unsaturated product of the wild-type pathway, sterigmatocystin. This observation led us to hypothesize that the A. nidulans sterigmatocystin biosynthetic pathway is branched similarly to the aflatoxin pathway in Aspergillus parasiticus and Aspergillus flavus and that StcL is required for the desaturation of the bisfuran moiety in the sterigmatocystin/aflatoxin precursor versicolorin B. This prediction was confirmed by feeding the stcL mutant with the subsequent pathway intermediate, versicolorin A, which resulted in accumulation of both sterigmatocystin and dihydrosterigmatocystin, indicating that StcL functions before versicolorin A synthesis. A. nidulans stcU was shown previously to encode a ketoreductase required to convert versicolorin A to demethylsterigmatocystin and an stcL, stcU double mutant strain was shown here to accumulate only versicolorin B. These results indicate that both versicolorin A and versicolorin B can serve as substrates for StcU, resulting in a branched pathway.

These compounds are acutely toxic and carcinogenic and are a serious concern from the human and animal health perspective (2Busby W.F. Wogan G.N. Searle C.E. Chemical Carcinogens. American Chemical Society, Washington D. C.1985: 945-1136Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic studies of AF biosynthesis in Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus have culminated in formulation of a biochemical logic that explains the steps involved in this complex pathway (partially depicted in Scheme FSI) (3Bhatnagar D.

Aspergillus nidulans and many other members of the genus Aspergillus produce ST, the second-to-last intermediate in AF biosynthesis. We have shown that the genes required for ST biosynthesis by A. nidulans are conserved at the functional, regulatory, and physical levels with the AF pathway genes from A. parasiticus and A. flavus (4Trail F.

A particularly important step in the AF/ST pathway is conversion of VER B to VER A (Scheme FSI). VER A is derived through desaturation of the bisfuran ring present in VER B. The critical nature of this step comes from the fact that the unsaturated bisfuran ring can be oxidized by a liver specific P-450 monooxygenase to form an epoxide that can then covalently link to DNA (21Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). It is this property of ST, AFB1, and AFG1 that provides their carcinogenic potential. In contrast, tetrahydrobisfuran-containing compounds AFB2 and AFG2 (and presumably DHST) have been found to be less carcinogenic in animal models (22Roebuck B.D. Maxuitenko Y.Y. Eaton D.L. Groopman J.D. The Toxicology of Aflatoxins. Human Health, Veternary, and Agricultural Significance. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 27-43Google Scholar). Current understanding of the origin of the unsaturated bisfuran moiety is that VER B is converted to VER A by a desaturase activity (23Yabe K. Ando Y. Hamasaki T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 1907-1911Google Scholar, 24Bhatnagar D. Ehrlich K.C. Cleveland T.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: A1234Google Scholar). Both VER A and VER B are then converted to AFs by common enzymes as depicted in Scheme FSI (3Bhatnagar D. Erhlich K.C. Cleveland T.E. Bhatnagar D. Lillehoj E.B. Arora D.K. Handbook of Applied Mycology. Marcel Dekker, New York1992: 255-286Google Scholar, 25Yabe K. Ando Y. Hamasaki T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1988; 54: 2101-2106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this communication we demonstrate the desaturase activity required to convert VER B to VER A is most likely encoded by the A. nidulans stcL gene, which encodes a putative P-450 monooxygenase. Disruption of stcL led to loss of ST production and accumulation of DHST. By analyzing the effects of stcL disruption in combination with a mutation in a gene required for VER A metabolism (e.g. stcU), we show that the same enzyme is needed to convert saturated and unsaturated bisfuran intermediates in DHST and ST biosynthesis. A. nidulans PW1 (biA1; argB2; methG1; veA1) was obtained from FGSC (Fungal Genetics Stock Center, Kansas City, KS). A. nidulans strain TAHK54.17 (biA1; methG1; veA1; stcL::argB) was created in the present study by transformation of A. nidulans strain PW1 with pAHK54 and TAHK78.36 (biA1; methG1; veA1; stcL::argB; stcU::hph) by transformation of TAHK54.17 with pAHK78.

The nucleotide sequence of stcL is available as a part of the ST gene cluster under the GenBank™ accession no. U34740 (6Brown D.W. Yu J.-H. Kelkar H.S. Fernandes M. Nesbitt T.C. Keller N.P.

Plasmid pAHK78 (Fig. 1C) was created for insertional disruption of the stcU open reading frame using the hygromycin phosphotransferase (hph) gene. Plasmid pJK1 (7Keller N.P. Kantz N.J. Adams T.H.

Yabe, Institute of Animal Health, Japan and Prof. T. Hamasaki, Tottori University, Japan) were from the sources indicated. Oat flake medium (3 g of oat flakes + 3 ml of water, autoclaved at 121°C for 20 min) was inoculated with 3 × 108 spores of the appropriate A. nidulans strain, and the cultures were grown at 30°C for 6 days. Metabolites were extracted using 30 ml of acetone:chloroform (1:1, v/v) mixture. The organic extract was filtered through anhydrous sodium sulfate to remove residual aqueous content and then dried at room temperature. Samples were resuspended in 1 ml of acetone, and 10 μl of the extract was analyzed on TLC plates (silica gel, 250 μm thick, 20 × 20 cm, Analtech) using benzene:acetic acid (95:5, v/v) or toluene:ethyl acetate:acetic acid (80:10:10 v/v) with appropriate standards. Compounds were visualized after spraying the TLC plates with a 20% (w/v) aluminum chloride solution in ethanol (95% v/v) and heating in a 100°C oven for 5 min (29Stack M. Rodricks J.V. J. Assoc. Off. Anal. Chem. 1971; 54: 86-90PubMed Google Scholar). Plates were photographed using Mineralight UV-25 UV light (UVP Inc., San Gabriel, CA) and Polaroid 667 instant film (Fig. 2). Large scale preparation of the metabolites for NMR analyses was achieved by scaling up the oat flake cultures 10-fold followed by separation using preparative TLC (silica gel preparative plates, 1000 μm thick, 20 × 20 cm, Analtech) employing the above solvent systems. The band containing the metabolite of interest was identified by UV light and then scraped off the plates with a spatula. The metabolite was extracted from the scrapings using 5 volumes of acetone. Further purification was achieved by rechromatography on the preparative TLC plates using benzene:acetic acid (95:5, v/v) or toluene:ethyl acetate:acetic acid (80:10:10, v/v) until apparent homogeneity was achieved. Approximately 5 mg of extract from the large scale preparation of metabolites was isolated and used for NMR analysis. The sample was dissolved in 0.75 ml of deuterated chloroform (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) containing 0.01% tetramethylsilane (Aldrich) as an internal reference (0.0 ppm) and was transferred into a 5-mm NMR tube (Wilmad Glass, Buena, NJ). A standard 1H spectrum was obtained on a Varian Associates Unity Plus-500 NMR spectrometer at a field of 11.75 tesla (Fig. 3). 64K complex data points were acquired at a sweep width of 8000 Hz and transformed without apodization. Homonuclear decoupling and two-dimensional COSY experiments were performed on a Varian Unity Plus-300 spectrometer operating at 7.1 tesla. Single dimensional spectra were acquired with 32K complex points at 4000 Hz sweep width. The two-dimensional correlation spectrum was acquired with 1024 × 256 complex points at 2413 Hz sweep width in both directions (Fig. 4). A control sample was taken from a blank location on the developed TLC purification plates and used to identify 1H NMR impurities in the spectra.Fig. 4The 300-MHz 1H two-dimensional COSY spectrum of DHST with neighboring hydrogens identified via cross-peaks A-E.

Adv. Genet. 1977; 19: 33-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) and oat flakes (1% w/v). Cultures (50 ml, 105 spores/ml) were incubated at 30°C for 48 h shaking at 200 rpm. At this point, 100 μg of appropriate metabolite in 50 μl of acetone were added to the culture, and growth was continued for the time indicated. Metabolites were then extracted and analyzed by TLC. The stcL gene was described previously as encoding a member of the P-450 monooxygenase Family CYP60 (6Brown D.W. Yu J.-H. Kelkar H.S. Fernandes M. Nesbitt T.C. Keller N.P. Adams T.H. Leonard T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1418-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) and its predicted amino acid sequence is shown in Fig. 1A. To determine if stcL is required for ST biosynthesis, A. nidulans strain PW1 was transformed with the stcL disruption plasmid pAHK54 (Fig. 1B) and the arginine prototrophs recovered were analyzed by Southern blots to identify stcL disruptants. Genomic DNA was isolated from 36 of the transformants, restricted with XhoI, and probed with the ∼4.8-kb insert from pAHK48. Eight strains (TAHK 54.5, 54.6, 54.8, 54.11, 54.16, 54.17, 54.29, and 54.31) had the ∼6.8-kb XhoI fragment, indicating replacement of genomic stcL by the disrupted copy (data not shown). stcL mutant strains were grown on oat flake medium, and extracts were analyzed for the production of ST. None of the mutant strains produced ST, but instead accumulated a different orange-red UV fluorescent compound that migrated slightly slower than ST on each of the different solvent systems employed (Fig. 2). HPLC analyses using a C18 column (acetonitrile:water, 80:20, v/v) coupled with photodiode array detection indicated that the UV absorbance spectrum of the compound was also similar to ST (data not shown). One stcL mutant (TAHK54.17) was selected for further studies, and large scale oat flake cultures of this strain were used to isolate the ST-like compound in milligram quantities. This was further purified to apparent homogeneity through additional rounds of preparative TLC (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Fig. 3 shows the 500-MHz 1H NMR spectrum of the isolated metabolite. Previous NMR studies of ST and derivatives compared with our spectra confirm the structure of the metabolite as DHST 3Identity of DHST was also supported by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry analysis (data not shown).

Chem. 1972; 36: 521-522Google Scholar). Homonuclear decoupling and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy were used to determine the chemical shifts and measure scalar couplings of each hydrogen on the molecule. Table I summarizes the assignments of chemical shifts and scalar coupling measurements for DHST. The singlets appearing for the -OH, -OCH3, and isolated aromatic hydrogen (H5) were easily assigned from peak intensity data. The isolated, scalar coupled system of aromatic hydrogens H7-H9 resulted in well defined classical multiplet patterns and subsequent assignment was straightforward. The six hydrogens H1-H4 on the bifuranyl group were more difficult to assign. Integrated peak intensities suggested that each hydrogen had a different chemical shift except for two at 2.3 ppm. At high field the multiplets at 4.2 ppm were resolved and it was noticed that they were each highly symmetric. The simplicity of these patterns indicated that the two hydrogens ∼4.2 ppm were not strongly coupled together and therefore could not be bonded to the same carbon as previously assigned (32Ashley D.L. Orti D.L. Hill Jr., R.H. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1987; 35: 782-785Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Further analysis was necessary to determine the correct chemical shifts for H1-H4.Table I.1H NMR spectral data for DHSTLocationChemical shiftTypeScalar couplingppmHz1aaAssignment of H1a versus H1b not certain, see text.3.69multiplet1baAssignment of H1a versus H1b not certain, see text.4.18multiplet2a2.32multiplet2b2.32multiplet34.23multiplet46.51doubletJ3,4 = 5.756.37singletOCH34.00singlet76.76doublet of doubletJ7,8 = 8.587.50tripletJ8,9 = 8.596.83doublet of doubletJ7,9 = 0.7OH13.3singleta Assignment of H1a versus H1b not certain, see text. Open table in a new tab A two-dimensional homonuclear correlation analysis, shown in Fig. 4, was performed to trace the arrangement of hydrogens in the DHST structure. The two aromatic hydrogens H7 and H9 were strongly coupled (J = 8.5 Hz) to H8 as evidenced by the cross-peak at A. Weaker coupling between H7 and H9 (J = 0.7 Hz) was not detected in the COSY spectrum. The strong scalar couplings between the six hydrogens of the bifuranyl ring system resulted in numerous cross-peaks describing the sequence of hydrogens around the ring. Starting with H4 at 6.51 ppm, cross-peak B shows a connection to H3 at 4.23 ppm. H3 was also connected through cross-peak D to both H2a and H2b, each with a coincidental resonance at 2.3 ppm. Cross-peak D also reveals a weak coupling (J = ∼4 Hz) between H2 and H1b which is not easily seen in Fig. 3. A stronger coupling was found between H2 and H1a at cross-peak E. The cross-peak at C between H1a and H1b was evident as expected for a strongly scalar coupled pair of methylene hydrogens. We were not able to distinguish the chemical shifts between H1a and H1b from the experiments in Fig. 3, Fig. 4. The finding that an A. nidulans stcL mutant accumulated DHST raised the possibility that A. nidulans, as proposed for A. flavus and A. parasiticus, has a branch in the ST/AF pathway at VER B. If true, then feeding TAHK54.17 with VER A should restore ST production (Scheme FSI). As expected, when TAHK54.17 cultures were supplemented with VER A, both ST and DHST accumulated by 96 h of growth (data not shown). By contrast, TAHK54.17 cultures fed with NOR, the first stable intermediate in the ST/AF pathway produced only DHST. Finally, when the VER A accumulating stcU mutant strain TJK6 was supplemented with DHST, no ST was produced indicating that stcL is not able to use DHST as a substrate for desaturation (Scheme FSI). Together these findings indicate that stcL must produce an enzyme activity that is responsible for the conversion of VER B to VER A. Because common enzymes are thought to be responsible for conversion of VER A and VER B to aflatoxins in A. flavus and A. parasiticus (Scheme FSI) (25Yabe K. Ando Y. Hamasaki T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1988; 54: 2101-2106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Bhatnagar D. Cleveland T.E. Kingston D.G.I. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4343-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we examined this possibility in A. nidulans. As previously mentioned, A. nidulans stcU mutants accumulate VER A, indicating that StcU is required to convert VER A to DMST (7Keller N.P. Kantz N.J. Adams T.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 1444-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If StcU were also required to convert VER B to DMDHST, we predicted that an stcL stcU double mutant strain should accumulate VER B (Scheme FSI). A double mutant strain was constructed by transforming TAHK54.17 with pAHK78 (Fig. 1C) to generate hygromycin-resistant colonies. Genomic DNA from 36 of these hygromycin-resistant transformants was isolated and restricted using XbaI and EcoRI. One transformant (TAHK78.36) had the genomic pattern expected if stcU had been disrupted by the hygromycin phosphotransferase (hph) gene (XbaI fragments ∼13.5, ∼4.5, and ∼2.6 kb; EcoRI fragments ∼6.8 and ∼10.7 kb, data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, TAHK78.36 did accumulate VER B, but did not produce either VER A or DHST. The mutagenic and carcinogenic properties of ST, AFB1, and AFG1 are largely a consequence of the mammalian liver P-450 dependent oxidation of the desaturated bisfuran moiety in these compounds (2Busby W.F. Wogan G.N. Searle C.E. Chemical Carcinogens. American Chemical Society, Washington D. C.1985: 945-1136Google Scholar, 3Bhatnagar D. Erhlich K.C. Cleveland T.E. Bhatnagar D. Lillehoj E.B. Arora D.K. Handbook of Applied Mycology. Marcel Dekker, New York1992: 255-286Google Scholar). Because elimination of the desaturated bond greatly reduces the carcinogenic nature of these molecules (2Busby W.F. Wogan G.N. Searle C.E. Chemical Carcinogens. American Chemical Society, Washington D. C.1985: 945-1136Google Scholar), identification of the activity responsible for this biochemical step could provide a target for ST/AF control strategies. The results presented here provide genetic evidence that the putative P-450 monooxygenase encoded by stcL is responsible for desaturation of the bisfuran in converting VER B to VER A. As shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4, mutation of the stcL gene results in the utilization of an alternate branch of the ST pathway resulting in synthesis of DHST. Analogous to the preferential production of AFB1 and AFG1 in the AF biosynthetic pathway (Scheme FSI), the branch leading to ST synthesis seems to be the preferred route for the metabolism of the intermediates as DHST is not reported to be accumulated by wild-type cultures of A. nidulans. The molecular properties of ST and DHST are so similar that separation of these compounds by TLC or HPLC is subtle and large quantities of ST could easily hide small amounts of DHST. The lack of detectable DHST may also be a reflection of the high affinity of StcL for VER B that results in preferential accumulation of only ST in A. nidulans. In contrast, Aspergillus versicolor is reported to be capable of accumulating minor amounts of DHST (31Hatsuda Y. Hamasaki T. Ishida M. Matsui K. Hara S. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1972; 36: 521-522Google Scholar) and A. flavus and A. parasiticus elaborate constant, but minor, levels of AFB2 or AFG2 (3Bhatnagar D. Erhlich K.C. Cleveland T.E. Bhatnagar D. Lillehoj E.B. Arora D.K. Handbook of Applied Mycology. Marcel Dekker, New York1992: 255-286Google Scholar). Another enzyme that could be important in the disproportional shunting of intermediates down the two branches of the ST/AF pathway is the ketoreductase, StcU. Keller et al. (7Keller N.P. Kantz N.J. Adams T.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 1444-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) had previously shown that stcU mutants accumulated VER A and postulated StcU to be the first enzyme required in converting VER A to DMST, which requires among other activities, a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation resulting in the formation of a xanthone from an anthraquinone (3Bhatnagar D. Erhlich K.C. Cleveland T.E. Bhatnagar D. Lillehoj E.B. Arora D.K. Handbook of Applied Mycology. Marcel Dekker, New York1992: 255-286Google Scholar, 7Keller N.P. Kantz N.J. Adams T.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 1444-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stcL stcU double mutant specifically accumulated VER B indicating that StcU, and probably StcS and StcP, must be active in both branches of the ST/DHST pathway in A. nidulans (Scheme FSI). Our observation that liquid shake cultures of the stcL mutant accumulated detectable amounts of VER B in addition to DHST (Fig. 2) can be attributed to inefficient processing of the saturated bisfuran-containing intermediates, creating a bottleneck at the branch point of the ST/DHST biosynthetic pathway. A similar biochemical observation was made with extracts from A. parasiticus in which common enzymes (presumably homologs of StcU, StcS, and StcP) predicted to function in the metabolism of VER A and VER B reportedly had much lower affinities for the tetrahydro-bisfuran ring containing intermediates including DMDHST, DHST, and OMDHST (33Bhatnagar D. Cleveland T.E. Kingston D.G.I. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4343-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with those of McGuire et al. (34McGuire S.M. Brobst S.W. Graybill T.L. Pal K. Townsend C.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 8308-8309Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) who proposed that VER B was an intermediate in VER A formation and that VER B served as the branch point between saturated and desaturated bisfuran containing intermediates in the AF pathway. Yabe et al. (23Yabe K. Ando Y. Hamasaki T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 1907-1911Google Scholar) subsequently described a NADPH-dependent desaturase activity that could convert VER B to VER A, and suggested that this enzyme determines the bifurcation in A. parasiticus AF biosynthesis. The predicted amino acid sequence of StcL contains the hallmark heme (35Nebert D.W. Gonzalez F.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 945-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar) binding motif of P-450 monooxygenases (Fig. 1A), which are known to carry out diverse NADPH-dependent reactions including dehydrogenation (3Bhatnagar D. Erhlich K.C. Cleveland T.E. Bhatnagar D. Lillehoj E.B. Arora D.K. Handbook of Applied Mycology. Marcel Dekker, New York1992: 255-286Google Scholar, 36Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 354-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because the enzyme activities encoded in the ST gene cluster in A. nidulans appear to be conserved in A. flavus and A. parasiticus, we expect that mutations in the stcL homolog (most likely ord1) (5Yu J. Chang P. Cary J.W. Wright M. Bhatnagar D. Cleveland T.E. Payne G.A. Linz J.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 2365-2371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in A. flavus and A. parasiticus would result in strains that preferentially accumulate AFB2. In fact, A. flavus mutants that accumulate only AFB2 have been described (37Papa K.E. Mycologia. 1977; 69: 556-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Bennett J.W. Christensen S.B. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 1983; 29: 53-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and we predict that these strains likely have mutations in the A. flavus StcL homolog. Finally StcL represents one of the five unique monooxygenases that are encoded by the ST gene cluster in A. nidulans (stcB, stcF, stcS, stcW). Keller et al. (7Keller N.P. Kantz N.J. Adams T.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 1444-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) previously showed that stcS is required for ST biosynthesis and that stcS mutants are blocked between VER A and DMST. We have evidence that stcF and stcW are also required for ST biosynthesis and mutants in each gene accumulate as yet uncharacterized intermediates. 4H. S. Kelkar, T. H. Adams, and N. P. Keller, unpublished observations. Investigations into the specificity of these monooxygenases may ultimately provide insights into their function in Aspergillus AF/ST biosynthesis as well as their versatility in metabolic conversions of natural products in general."

Genetic and biochemical analysis of several constructed mutants suggest that at least crtC is localized downstream of the puf operon and that it is cotranscribed with this operon. Sequence analysis confirmed the genetic data and showed the presence of crtD and crtC genes downstream of the puf operon, a localization different from that known for other purple bacteria. Inactivation of the crtD gene indicated that the two crt genes are cotranscribed and that they are involved not only in the hydroxyspheroidene biosynthesis pathway as in Rhodobacter sphaeroides and R. capsulatus, but also in the spirilloxanthin biosynthesis pathway. Carotenoid genes implicated in the spirilloxanthin biosynthesis pathway were thus identified for the first time. Furthermore, analysis of carotenoid synthesis in the mutants gave genetic evidence that crtD and crtC genes are cotranscribed with the puf operon using the oxygen-regulated puf promoter.

Carotenoids have three functions in bacterial photosynthesis. They act in photoprotection, they function as accessory light-harvesting pigments by absorbing light in the 450-570 nm region (1Cogdell R.J. Frank H.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1995: 1135-1157Google Scholar). Spectroscopic and chemical studies of the processes of carotenoid biosynthesis have been performed in different mutants, in particular in R. sphaeroides and R. capsulatus (8Scolnik P.A. Walker M.A. Marrs B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2427-2432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Guiliano G. Pollock D. Stapp H. Scolnik P.A. Mol. Gen.

In these bacteria the end products of the biosynthetic pathway are spheroidene and spheroidenone; in other bacteria such as Rhodospirillum rubrum and Rubrivivax gelatinosus, in addition to the spheroidene pathway, another pathway leading to biosynthesis of spirilloxanthin and derivatives was described (5Schmidt K. Clayton R.K. The Photosynthetic Bacteria. Plenum Press, New York1978: 729-750Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The genes encoding many carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes have now been mapped (12Armstrong G.A. Hearst J.E. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The arrangement of carotenoid genes was first described for R. capsulatus (13Yen H.-C. Marrs B. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 619-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As in R. sphaeroides, the carotenoid genes are clustered and flanked by bacteriochlorophyll genes within a 45-kb region of the chromosome (14Taylor D.P. Cohen S.N. Clark W.G. Marrs B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 580-590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zsebo K.M. Hearst J.E. Cell. 1984; 37: 937-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In these bacteria, the first enzyme assigned to carotenoid biosynthesis is the geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate synthase encoded by crtE gene (16Math S.K. Hearst J.E. Poulter C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6761-6764Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Sandmann G. Misawa N. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 90: 253-258Crossref Google Scholar). The condensation of two geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate by an enzyme encoded by crtB lead to the synthesis of phytoene (16Math S.K. Hearst J.E. Poulter C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6761-6764Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Sandmann G. Misawa N. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 90: 253-258Crossref Google Scholar), which is transformed to neurosporene by sequential desaturations which involved crtI (18Giuliano G. Pollock D. Scolnik P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12925-12929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lang H.P. Cogdell R.J. Gardiner A.T. Hunter C.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3859-3869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In R. sphaeroides and R. capsulatus, a hydratase encoded by crtC catalyzes hydration of neurosporene to hydroxyneurosporene (8Scolnik P.A. Walker M.A. Marrs B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2427-2432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is then transformed to spheroidene by the products of crtF and crtD (8Scolnik P.A. Walker M.A. Marrs B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2427-2432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crtA and crtC products catalyze the transformation of spheroidene to spheroidenone and hydroxyspheroidene, respectively (8Scolnik P.A. Walker M.A. Marrs B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2427-2432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and finally crtA product catalyzes oxygenation of hydroxyspheroidene to hydroxyspheroidenone (11Lang H.P. Cogdell R.J. Takaichi S. Hunter C.N. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2064-2073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In R. rubrum and R. gelatinosus, neurosporene is also transformed to lycopene. A hydratase catalyzes the formation of rhodopin from lycopene, and subsequent reactions (desaturations and methylations) lead to the formation of spirilloxanthin, the end product of this second pathway. The genes involved at each step of this second pathway have not yet been identified. The expression of pigment biosynthesis genes has been studied mainly in R. sphaeroides and R. capsulatus. Bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoid genes are proposed to be organized in transcription units (operons) (20Beatty J.T. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1995: 1209-1219Google Scholar). The existence of such an organization is supported by the results of RNA mapping (20Beatty J.T. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1995: 1209-1219Google Scholar) and interposon mutagenesis experiments (21Coomber S.A. Chaudhri M. Connor A. Britton G. Hunter C.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In particular, crtEF, bchCXYZ, and puf operons are organized in a “superoperon” (22Bauer C.E. Buggy J.J. Yang Z. Marrs B.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 228: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23Bauer C.E. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1995: 1235-1244Google Scholar). In these bacteria, the cotranscription of the three operons has been found to be phenotypically significant for adaptation to changes in environmental conditions (25Wellington C.L. Bauer C.E. Beatty J.T. Can. J. Microbiol. 1992; 38: 20-27Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Up to now, nothing is known about the relevance of the genes downstream of the puf operon. R. gelatinosus is a facultative phototrophic non-sulfur bacterium belonging to the β subclass of purple bacteria. This strain, as R. sphaeroides and R. capsulatus and unlike Rhodopseudomonas viridis, can grow very easily under aerobic conditions in the dark as well as under photosynthetic conditions. These trophic characteristics are very useful for studies of the photosynthetic processes using mutants. The genes coding for the subunits of LHI and RC and the polypeptides of LHII are organized in operons. The nucleotide sequence of the puf operon has been determined for two strains of R. gelatinosus, strain IL144 (26Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Photosynth.

Genet. 1996; 252: 379-385PubMed Google Scholar); it contains two open reading frames (ORFs) in addition to five photosynthetic genes which have been reported in species belonging to the α subclass. These genes include pufB, -A, -L, -M, and -C coding for the β and α subunits of the B875 light-harvesting protein and for the L, M, and cytochrome subunits of the RC complex, respectively. The localization and the organization of the pigment genes are unknown. Recently, gene transfer systems in R. gelatinosus have been established (29Ouchane S. Picaud M. Reiss F. Vernotte C. Astier A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 379-385PubMed Google Scholar), and genetic evidence for an organization of the puf operon and upstream bch genes in a superoperon has been obtained (29Ouchane S. Picaud M. Reiss F. Vernotte C. Astier A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 379-385PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we report the construction and the analysis of interposon and insertion R. gelatinosus mutants, in which carotenoid biosynthesis has been affected. The accumulation of neurosporene and lycopene in some mutants suggested that at least the crtC gene could be localized downstream of the puf operon. Sequence analysis of the downstream region of the puf operon revealed the presence of crtD and crtC genes. Inactivation of crtD gene indicated that the two carotenoid genes are cotranscribed. Analysis of mutants gave evidence of the involvement of both genes in the hydroxyspheroidene and the spirilloxanthin carotenoid biosynthesis pathways. Furthermore, analysis of the accumulation of carotenoid intermediates in the different constructed mutants showed that crtD and crtC genes are cotranscribed with puf operon using the oxygen-regulated puf promoter. Escherichia coli strains were grown at 37°C on LB medium (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Picaud M. Reiss F. Vernotte C. Astier A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 379-385PubMed Google Scholar. Following the electric pulse, cells were diluted in 10 ml of ML medium. After incubation at 32°C for 6 h in darkness, serial cell dilutions were plated on nonselective ML plates to assess cell survival and on selective ML plates to select transformants. Two different antibiotic resistance markers were used to distinguish a double crossover event from a single crossover event, the first one being located on the vector and the second one as the cartridge inserted in the gene to be inactivated. Chromatophores from R. gelatinosus were prepared by differential centrifugation after disruption of cells with a French press and were resuspended in 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8 buffer. Carotenoids were extracted from chromatophores with acetone/methanol (7:2, v/v) and separated by thin-layer chromatography in a acetone/petroleum ether (1:9) solvent, as described in 3Jirsakova V. Reiss-Husson F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar. Each carotenoid spot was recovered, eluted from silica by a small volume of acetone, and analyzed by spectroscopy. Spectral analysis was carried out on a Cary 2300 spectrophotometer interfaced with a computer. Standard methods were performed, if not otherwise indicated, according to 30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar. Plasmid DNAs were purified using Qiagen columns (Diagen). DNA was treated with restriction enzymes and other nucleic acid modifying enzymes (Klenow fragment, alkaline phosphatase, T4 DNA ligase) according to manufacturer specifications. DNA fragments were analyzed on agarose gel, and different restriction fragments were purified using a Geneclean kit (Bio 101). Genomic DNA was purified as described in 29Ouchane S. Picaud M. Reiss F. Vernotte C. Astier A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 379-385PubMed Google Scholar. Southern hybridization analysis of genomic DNA was performed as indicated by Amersham; probes were labeled with [α-32P]CTP by nick translation. Construction of pMP8 and pSO8 has been described previously in 29Ouchane S. Picaud M. Reiss F. Vernotte C. Astier A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 379-385PubMed Google Scholar. Plasmid pMP8 was linearized with BstBI restriction enzyme and treated with the Klenow fragment to create blunt ends. The resulting plasmid was ligated with the SmaI Ω or Km cartridge to construct pSM2 and PSO6, respectively. For constructing pSO14 and pSO15, the BamHI Ω or Km cartridge was inserted in the unique BglII site of pufL in pMP8 plasmid. To inactivate the crtD gene, pSOX plasmid was linearized with BglII restriction enzyme and ligated with the BamHI Ω or Km cartridge to create pSO20 and pSO21, respectively. To clone the region downstream of the puf operon, genomic DNA from the SIC strain was digested with different restriction endonucleases and ligated. The ligation product was used to transform E. coli. Transformants were analyzed and several plasmids were obtained. The crt genes were subcloned in plasmid pSOX and pSO24. Sequencing was performed on both strands using the dideoxy chain termination method of Sanger with the Sequenase version 2.0 kit, Amersham. A puf operon deletion strain called SΔP was described previously (29Ouchane S. Picaud M. Reiss F. Vernotte C. Astier A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 379-385PubMed Google Scholar). A pleiotropic effect of the deletion was a change in the color of the cells which became green (the wild type being purple). Absorption spectra of chromatophores of this strain showed that the three main absorption peaks of carotenoids in the wild type (455, 481, and 512 nm) were shifted to the blue, giving a shoulder at about 425 nm and two peaks at 458 and 487 nm in the mutant. This phenotype was due neither to spontaneous mutations nor to the Ω cartridge itself, but to the disruption of the puf operon. Indeed, transformants with pSO8, a replicative plasmid bearing the Ω cartridge, were purple, but the complemented strain CSΔP, bearing the puf operon on a replicative plasmid, was also green. Furthermore, we isolated revertants from the complemented strain CSΔP which became purple and in which the correct chromosome structure was restored as a result of recombination between the chromosome and the complementing plasmid (29Ouchane S. Picaud M. Reiss F. Vernotte C. Astier A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 379-385PubMed Google Scholar). Other interposon strains, SIL1 and SΔC1 (Table I), in which the Ω cartridge was inserted in pufL and in pufC genes, respectively, were constructed (Fig. 2A). Spr and Aps transformants resulting from double crossover events were selected. The inactivation of the genes with the drug cartridges was confirmed by Southern blot analyses. Fig. 2B shows an example of Southern analysis. Genomic DNAs from wild type and two different clones of SΔC1 strains were digested either by SacI or by SalI and probed with the SalI fragment containing a large part of pufC. The 4.9-kb SacI band seen in the wild type was replaced, as expected, by a 6.9-kb band resulting from the 2-kb Ω cartridge insertion in the gene. The 1.1-kb SalI band seen in the wild type was replaced, as expected, by two small 0.7- and 0.4-kb bands because of the two SalI sites of the polylinkers flanking the Ω cartridge. The same type of analysis, using other restriction enzymes, was performed with the SIL1 strain (data not shown) to confirm the inactivation of the pufL gene. The SΔC1 and SIL1 strains were also green, substantiating the polar effect of the puf deletion. Spectroscopic analysis carried out on chromatophores indicated a modification in the carotenoid absorption peaks. It was assumed that the green phenotype reflected a lesion in the carotenoid biosynthesis. Pigment modifications in the mutants SIL1 and SΔC1 were checked by recording absorption spectra of acetone/methanol extracts from chromatophores of these strains and comparing them with that of the wild type (Fig. 3). In the wild type, the three main carotenoid absorption peaks are located at 430, 455, and 485 nm, and there is a minor peak at 530 nm. In both mutants, the three major peaks were shifted toward the blue giving maxima at 415, 440, and 470 nm, with a minor peak at 500 nm. This indicated that the green color was due to a change in the carotenoid composition of the cells and that the mutants were blocked presumably at the same step in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway. To confirm this result, the carotenoid extracts of the mutants and of the wild type were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (3Jirsakova V. Reiss-Husson F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the major carotenoids were identified by their relative mobilities and by their absorption spectra (Table II). In the wild type, the major carotenoids were identified as hydroxyspheroidene, spheroidene, and spirilloxanthin, as in 5Schmidt K. Clayton R.K. The Photosynthetic Bacteria. Plenum Press, New York1978: 729-750Google Scholar. In the mutants, two major carotenoids were identified as neurosporene and lycopene (Table III). Since the next steps in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway for transforming, respectively, neurosporene to hydroxyneurosporene and lycopene to rhodopin are hydrations (Fig. 1), our results suggested that in the mutants the synthesis of a hydratase encoded by crtC gene was blocked and that at least this gene could be located downstream of the puf operon.Table IISpectral characteristics and mobilities in HTLC-silica gel of the different carotenoids, relative to neurosporeneCarotenoidAbsorption maxima in acetone (nm)Relative mobilityHydroxyspheroidene429-454-4840.2Spheroidene429-454-4840.8Spirilloxanthin465-495-5280.5Neurosporene416-440-4681.0Methoxyneurosporene416-440-4680.83Hydroxyneurosporene416-440-4680.25Lycopene442-470-5000.97Rhodopin442-470-5000.18 Open table in a new tab Table IIIMajor carotenoids identified in the different strainsWTSΔPSICSIO*SIL1SIL2SΔC1SΔC2SID1SID2PGGGPGPGPGGHydroxyspheroidene++++Spirilloxanthin++++Spheroidene++++Neurosporene+++++++Lycopene+++++++Methoxyneurosporene+Hydroxyneurosporene+Rhodopin+ Open table in a new tab To check the localization of the crtC gene and to see whether it is the only crt gene localized downstream of the puf operon, cloning of this region was achieved by insertional cloning using SIC and SID3 strains in which recombinant plasmids were inserted downstream of the puf operon (Table I). Two plasmids pSOX and pSO24 were obtained, and the cloned DNA was sequenced on both strands. The complete nucleotide sequence of a 3-kb SacI fragment downstream of the puf operon (Fig. 2A) was determined. This fragment was found to contain two ORFs immediately downstream of the pufC gene. The initial assignment of the ORFs was based on the alignment with R. capsulatus and R. sphaeroides photosynthetic gene cluster, which showed that they correspond to crtD and crtC carotenoid genes. The crtD and crtC genes were in the same direction as the puf operon. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were deposited in the GenBank™ Data Library under the accession number U73944. The crtD and crtC genes have the same transcriptional orientation, and no transcriptional terminator was found between them, suggesting that they could be cotranscribed. For both genes, an ATG initiating codon is proposed. The crtC gene initiation codon was found within the crtD gene (overlap of 372 nucleotides). No alternative initiation codon could be found. Putative translation starts of these genes were based on the position of a Shine-Dalgarno ribosome binding site evaluated by comparison with other sequenced genes from R. gelatinosus known to encode proteins and comparison with genes from R. capsulatus (10Armstrong G.A. Alberti M. Leach F. Hearst J.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The first third of the crtC gene shows atypical codon usage. In R. gelatinosus, the codon usage deduced from the pufBALMC genes is characterized by the presence of a majority (89%) of C and G at the third position. The first 126 codons of crtC have only 64% CG at the third position, whereas the rest of the sequence has a value of 93% comparable with the mean value. No putative promoter sequence with significant homology to the known puf promoter or to the crt promoters from R. capsulatus and R. sphaeroides was found for the two genes; this is in agreement with genetic data concerning their expression (see below). We disrupted crtD gene either with an Ω cartridge which contains a strong transcriptional terminator or with a Km cartridge devoid of the transcriptional terminator (Fig. 2A). If the two genes were cotranscribed, inactivation of crtD with an Ω cartridge would lead to a crtC-less phenotype, and cells would accumulate neurosporene and lycopene since CrtC operates upstream of CrtD in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, whereas inactivation with a Km cartridge leads to a crtD-less phenotype, and cells accumulate other carotenoid intermediates. Plasmids pSO20 and pSO21 were used to transform R. gelatinosus leading to SID1 and SID2 strains, in which the crtD was inactivated with the Ω and the Km cartridge, respectively (Table I, Fig. 2A). All the obtained transformants were green. Southern blot analyses were performed and confirmed the inactivation of crtD by a double crossover event in the transformants (data not shown). Carotenoids were extracted and identified by their relative mobilities in thin layer chromatography and their visible absorption spectra (Table III). In SID1, the major carotenoids corresponded to neurosporene and lycopene, a phenotype of a crtC− genotype, whereas in SID2 the carotenoid intermediates corresponded to neurosporene, methoxyneurosporene, hydroxyneurosporene, lycopene, and rhodopin, a phenotype of a crtD− genotype. When the whole plasmid pSO21 was inserted into the chromosome, the resulting strain SID3 was green and had the same phenotype and pigment composition as SID1. These results indicated that crtD and crtC are cotranscribed. The crtD gene is 1572 bp long and encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of about 56 kDa. The CrtD protein from R. gelatinosus is highly similar (53%) to the corresponding protein from R. capsulatus (Fig. 4A). Particularly, a stretch of residues in the C-terminal region which is highly conserved in the carotenoid dehydrogenases (CrtD and CrtI) from R. capsulatus (10Armstrong G.A. Alberti M. Leach F. Hearst J.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) is also found in R. gelatinosus (underlined in Fig. 4A). The crtC gene is 1218 bp long and encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of about 44 kDa. The CrtC protein from R. gelatinosus presents less similarity (42%) than crtD to the corresponding protein from R. capsulatus (Fig. 4B). This is owing to the extension of 120 residues in the N-terminal region of the R. gelatinosus protein. It is noteworthy that in R. gelatinosus, the first part of the CrtC protein, which corresponds to the region with atypical codon usage, was enriched in proline (10.5%) whereas the rest of the sequence has the usual percentage of proline, i.e. about 6-7%. The hydropathy plots of both proteins were determined according to Kyte and Doolittle (33Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar), and they did not reveal any putative transmembrane domain. Evidence of the involvement of the CrtC and CrtD proteins in the spirilloxanthin biosynthesis pathway arises from the carotenoid content of SID1 and SID2 mutants. In this biosynthesis pathway, lycopene is converted to rhodopin by a hydration reaction. In SID1 strain (crtC−), this conversion does not occur, implying that the crtC gene product catalyzes the transformation of lycopene to rhodopin in R. gelatinosus. The formation of anhydrorhodovibrin from rhodopin needs a dehydrogenase. Inactivation of crtD gene in SID2 strain (crtD−) results in the accumulation of rhodopin. Thus, in R. gelatinosus, the crtD gene product catalyzes the formation of anhydrorhodovibrin at the expense of rhodopin. Analysis of the interposon strains indicated that there is no promoter for carotenoid genes within the puf operon (see above). One possible promoter could be the puf operon promoter itself. To examine this hypothesis, two insertion strains called SIO and SIC (Table I) were used (29Ouchane S. Picaud M. Reiss F. Vernotte C. Astier A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 379-385PubMed Google Scholar). In the SIO strain, a recombinant plasmid has been inserted between the bch genes and the puf operon and thus the puf operon remained linked to the carotenoid genes. In the SIC strain, the recombinant plasmid has been inserted between the puf operon and the carotenoid genes (29Ouchane S. Picaud M. Reiss F. Vernotte C. Astier A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 379-385PubMed Google Scholar). Because of this chromosome organization, if the crt genes are transcribed using the puf promoter (which had been shown to be repressed under aerobic conditions), we expected the SIC strain to be green independently of the growth conditions. On the contrary, the SIO strain would be green in darkness under aerobiosis, but would become purple when grown under photosynthetic conditions (light and anaerobiosis). In darkness under aerobiosis, the SIC and SIO strains were green. Pigment analysis indicated that both strains accumulated neurosporene and lycopene (Table III). When transferred in photosynthetic conditions, the SIC cells remained green, whereas the SIO cells became progressively purple. Carotenoid were extracted from cells after 2, 5, and 7 days of growth in photosynthetic conditions. For the SIC strain, no difference was observed (not shown). For SIO, the spectra of the carotenoid extracts from cells grown during 2 days and during 7 days in photosynthetic conditions were different (Fig. 5) and the difference spectrum, computed between these two culture extracts, showed the same carotenoid absorption peaks as in the wild type. Analysis of carotenoids by thin layer chromatography showed the progressive disappearance of neurosporene and lycopene and the progressive appearance of spheroidene, hydroxyspheroidene, and spirilloxanthin (Table III). These results indicated that the carotenoid genes are cotranscribed with the puf operon using the oxygen-regulated puf promoter. To confirm these results, we constructed two other interposon strains SIL2 and SΔC2 in which the pufL or pufC, respectively, were disrupted by the Km cartridge which is devoid of a transcriptional terminator (Table I, Fig. 2A). The resulting strains were purple, and they had the same pigment composition as the wild type. However, when the whole plasmids (pSO15 and pSO6) were inserted into the chromosome, the resulting strains SIL3 and SIC2 were green and had the same phenotype and pigment composition as SIL1 and SΔC1. The Ω cartridge has been proved to be an efficient polar mutagen (34Prentki P. Krisch H.M. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 29: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). We have used it to construct puf inactivations and deletions. The resulting strains exhibited a green phenotype, suggesting a localization of carotenoid genes downstream from the puf operon (29Ouchane S. Picaud M. Reiss F. Vernotte C. Astier A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 379-385PubMed Google Scholar). In this work we demonstrate that the localization of the crtD and crtC carotenoid genes in R. gelatinosus is different from that described up to now in the other purple bacteria. Indeed, crtD and crtC were found downstream of the puf operon in R. gelatinosus, whereas in R. capsulatus and R. sphaeroides the two genes are located in a carotenoid cluster including all the crt genes and flanked by the bch genes, upstream of the puf operon. The polarity effects arising from the interposon mutagenesis within crtD showed that crtD and crtC are cotranscribed and in the crtD-crtC order. More interestingly, interposon mutagenesis within puf operon also had polar effects on the carotenoid genes; this indicated that the crt genes are cotranscribed with the puf operon. Unlike the situation in R. capsulatus and R. sphaeroides, no promoter sequence was found for the transcription of the crtD and crtC genes in R. gelatinosus, and we have genetic evidences that under photosynthetic conditions the crtD and crtC genes are cotranscribed with puf using its oxygen-regulated promoter. Thus, one may wonder how the crt genes are transcribed under nonphotosynthetic conditions. Since in darkness and under aerobiosis R. gelatinosus is still pigmented, we suppose that these genes are transcribed from an oxygen-insensitive promoter. We have already shown that under nonphotosynthetic conditions the puf operon is transcribed from an upstream promoter insensitive to oxygen regulation, and that cells under these conditions produced a reduced amount of LHI and RC proteins (29Ouchane S. Picaud M. Reiss F. Vernotte C. Astier A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 379-385PubMed Google Scholar). We propose that the carotenoid genes localized downstream of the puf operon could be also transcribed from this oxygen-insensitive promoter. In R. capsulatus, it was proposed that crtEF, bchCXYZ, and puf operons were cotranscribed under nonphotosynthetic conditions using the crt promoter (35Wellington C.L. Beatty J.T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1432-1443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that bchFBNHLM-F1696 and puhA are cotranscribed using the bch promoter (22Bauer C.E. Buggy J.J. Yang Z. Marrs B.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 228: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In R. gelatinosus, we have to assume that bch, puf, and crt genes could be cotranscribed under the nonphotosynthetic conditions using the bch oxygen-insensitive promoter; this hypothesis will be confirmed by mRNA analysis (under investigation). A ρ-independent terminator-like structure was found between pufC and crtD genes of R. gelatinosus. Similar structures were found in R. capsulatus, R. sphaeroides, R. rubrum, and R. viridis (36Alberti M. Burke D.H. Hearst J.E. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1995: 1083-1106Google Scholar). We would suggest that these structures could have a regulatory function and serve to control the stability of the transcript. The carotenoid genes which encode enzymatic proteins would be required in low amounts, in contrast to puf genes encoding structural polypeptides which require a higher level of expression, and, accordingly, the hairpin structures could protect puf mRNA from exonuclease digestion to increase its lifetime. Beatty (20Beatty J.T. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1995: 1209-1219Google Scholar) speculated that in spite of the two ρ-independent terminator-like structures found downstream of pufX in R. capsulatus, a read-through transcription downstream of the puf operon was possible; here we confirm this hypothesis for R. gelatinosus. In R. capsulatus and R. sphaeroides, only one carotenoid biosynthesis pathway has been identified, leading to the synthesis of spheroiden(on)e; the reactions and the involved genes are now well known (6Britton G. Young A. Britton G. Carotenoids in Photosynthesis. Chapman & Hall, London1993: 96-126Crossref Google Scholar). In R. gelatinosus, the diversity of carotenoids is greater and two carotenoid biosynthesis pathways lead, respectively, to synthesis of hydroxyspheroidene and spirilloxanthin (5Schmidt K. Clayton R.K. The Photosynthetic Bacteria. Plenum Press, New York1978: 729-750Google Scholar). The reaction steps of both pathways are known (5Schmidt K. Clayton R.K. The Photosynthetic Bacteria. Plenum Press, New York1978: 729-750Google Scholar), but the involved genes have not been identified. The biosynthesis of hydroxyspheroidene, in R. gelatinosus, might involve the same enzymatic reactions as in R. capsulatus and R. sphaeroides. Here we report the identification of the crtD and crtC genes, and we confirm the functions of their products in the spheroidene branch. The biosynthesis of spirilloxanthin via rhodopin in R. gelatinosus and in R. rubrum includes several known reactions (5Schmidt K. Clayton R.K. The Photosynthetic Bacteria. Plenum Press, New York1978: 729-750Google Scholar). In this work, we propose another function to crtC and crtD gene products in R. gelatinosus. The crtC gene, encoding a hydratase, and the crtD gene, encoding a dehydrogenase, are, respectively, involved in the formation of rhodopin from lycopene and the formation of anhydrorhodovibrin from rhodopin (Fig. 1). It implies that the crt genes involved in the hydroxyspheroidene pathway are also involved in the spirilloxanthin one. To complete the scheme, we propose the participation of crtI, crtC, crtD, and crtF in the final steps of spirilloxanthin synthesis (Fig. 1). Indeed, transformation of neurosporene to lycopene requires a “specific” desaturation catalyzed by a dehydrogenase which could be encoded by crtI. It is interesting to note that in R. capsulatus and R. sphaeroides, this CrtI enzyme is present but its catalytic function stops at the level of neurosporene (7Armstrong G.A. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1995: 1135-1157Google Scholar). This difference in the functioning of the dehydrogenase suggests that in R. gelatinosus, the crtI gene could be different from the corresponding gene in R. capsulatus and R. sphaeroides. Conversion of anhydrorhodovibrin to rhodovibrin requires a hydration which could be catalyzed by crtC gene product. The crtD gene encodes a dehydrogenase which could catalyze the formation of monodemethyl spirilloxanthin from rhodovibrin. Finally, formation of the spirilloxanthin requires the methylation of the monodemethyl spirilloxanthin which is catalyzed by an O-methyltransferase. In the hydroxyspheroidene pathway, the O-methyltransferase is encoded by the crtF gene; thus, crtF might also be implicated in the spirilloxanthin pathway. This has been also suggested by Yildiz et al. (37Yildiz F.H. Gest H. Bauer C.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2683-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as a crtF mutant of R. capsulatus has been complemented by DNA from R. centenum which synthesizes spirilloxanthin rather than spheroidene.

Therefore, the identification of kinases that phosphorylate tau is of considerable interest. A DEAE-Sepharose column resolved porcine brain extract into five tau kinase activity peaks. Among these peaks, two were completely inhibited by EGTA, indicating that these two activity peaks contained Ca2+-dependent tau kinases. One of the above two Ca2+-dependent tau kinase activity peaks also contained phosphorylase kinase activity. The tau kinase and phosphorylase kinase activities associated with this peak could not be separated from each other by Superose 12 gel filtration, hydroxylapatite, and calmodulin-agarose affinity chromatographies. Phosphorylase kinase, purified from rabbit skeletal muscle, phosphorylated tau to a stoichiometry of 2.1 mol of phosphate/mol of tau and converted tau to a species with a retarded mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The apparent Km and kcat values for tau phosphorylation by muscle phosphorylase kinase were 6.9 μM and 47.4 min−1, respectively. As a substrate of muscle phosphorylase kinase, phosphorylase was eight times better than tau. Sequence analyses of tryptic and thermolytic phosphopeptides derived from tau phosphorylated by muscle phosphorylase kinase revealed five phosphorylation sites, Ser237, Ser262, Ser285, Ser305, and Ser352. Among these sites, Ser262 was previously shown to be phosphorylated in human tau from fetal, adult, and Alzheimer's diseased brains (Seubert, P., Mawal-Dewan, M., Barbour, R., Jakes, R., Goedert, M., Johnson, G.

E., Mandelkow, E.-M., and Mandelkow, E. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 7679-7688). Slot-blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against muscle phosphorylase kinase and an activity assay using phosphorylase revealed that phosphorylase kinase was present in microtubules extensively purified by repeated cycles of polymerization and depolymerization. Taken together, these results suggest that in neurons, phosphorylase kinase may be one of the kinases that participate in the phosphorylation of tau.

Tau is a neuronal-specific microtubule-associated protein. It plays an important role in neuronal morphogenesis, the maintenance of axonal shape, and axonal transport through its ability to bind and regulate microtubule structure and dynamics (for reviews, see Refs.1Hirokawa N.

There are six alternatively spliced isoforms of human tau ranging from 352 to 441 amino acids in length (4Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Cairns N.J. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1992; 8: 159-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). The expression of these isoforms is developmentally regulated with only one isoform expressed in juvenile brain and all isoforms expressed in adult brain (2Matus A. Annu. Rev.

These isoforms differ from each other by the presence of three or four tandem repeats of 31-32 amino acids (3Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Garner C.C. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 193-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). These repeats are rich in positively charged residues and are thought to interact with the negatively charged carboxyl-terminal region of tubulins exposed on the microtubule structure to result in a tau-microtubule binding (1Hirokawa N.

Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 19-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of tau is likely to regulate microtubule structure, stiffness, and dynamics. In vivo, adult tau is phosphorylated on Thr181, Ser202, Thr231, Ser262, and Ser404 (all tau residues in this paper are numbered according to the longest isoform of human tau (4Goedert M.

Among all the above sites, Ser262 is the only site located within the microtubule-binding repeats of tau. Its phosphorylation was shown to drastically suppress tau's affinity for microtubules and was suggested to play a key role in the regulation of binding of tau to microtubules (10Drewes G. Trinczek B.

Recently, tau became the focus of intense research due to its presence in paired helical filaments (PHFs) 1The abbreviations used are: PHFpaired helical filamentADAlzheimer's diseaseNCLKneuronal cdc2-like protein kinasePTHphenylthiohydantoinDTTdithiothreitolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMapmitogen-activated proteinCamcalmodulinmABmonoclonal antibodyHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. . PHFs are the main structural component of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) which are a characteristic neuropathological lesion found in the brains of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) (reviewed in 13Goedert M. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 460-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). PHF-tau (tau associated with PHFs) is highly insoluble, displays retarded mobility on SDS-PAGE, and is abnormally phosphorylated (i.e. contains more phosphate than normal tau). Several studies indicate that it is the abnormal phosphorylation that is responsible for converting normal tau to PHF-tau (13Goedert M.

PHF-tau is phosphorylated on 19 sites. These sites are Ser208, Ser210, Thr212, Ser214, Thr403, Ser409, Ser412, Ser413, and Ser422 plus the phosphorylation sites of juvenile tau mentioned above, except Thr181 (17Morishima-Kawashima M.

Among these sites nine contain a S/TP motif, recognized by various proline-directed kinases. These sites are Ser199, Ser202, Thr212, Thr217, Thr231, Ser235, Ser396, Ser404, and Ser422.

Kinases that phosphorylate nonproline-directed sites of tau, Ser198, Ser208, Ser210, Ser400, Thr403, Ser412, and Ser413 are yet to be identified. For a complete elucidation of the cellular and molecular basis of PHF formation it is essential that all the kinases that phosphorylate tau be identified. In this study specific substrates and antibodies directed to various kinases were utilized to find out if a novel tau kinase could be detected in brain homogenates. Herein, it is reported that phosphorylase kinase, implicated in the phosphorylation of phosphorylase and regulation of glycogenolysis (26Pickett-Gies C.A. Walsh D.A. Boyer P.D. Krebs E.G. The Enzymes. Vol. 17. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 395-459Google Scholar), copurifies with microtubules and phosphorylates tau in a Ca2+-dependent manner. In vitro, it phosphorylates tau on five sites including Ser262. Results presented in this paper suggest that phosphorylase kinase is one of the potential kinases involved in the phosphorylation of tau under normal and pathological conditions. Tau protein was purified from lysates of Escherichia coli that overexpressed the longest isoform of human tau (htau 40) essentially as described (27Crowther R.A. Olesen O.F. Smith M.J. Jakes R. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) except the lysis buffer also contained 1% Triton X-100, and the clear supernatant obtained after the centrifugation of the bacterial lysate was passed through a Q-Sepharose column. Microtubules were purified from bovine brain extract by three cycles of temperature-induced polymerization and depolymerization of microtubules (20Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23512-23518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Muscle phosphorylase kinase was purified from New Zealand White rabbit skeletal muscle through DEAE-cellulose chromatography (28Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 34: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated muscle phosphorylase kinase was prepared by autophosphorylation of the kinase and resulted in the incorporation of 7.9 mol of phosphate/mol of kinase (29Paudel H.K. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16524-16529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic γ subunit of muscle phosphorylase kinase was prepared essentially as described previously (30Paudel H.K. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11912-11915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylase was isolated from New Zealand White rabbit skeletal muscles using the method of Fisher and Krebs (31Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

Protein kinase C was purified from the rat brain homogenate (32Paudel H.K. Zwiers H. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6207-6213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine brain calmodulin was a generous gift from Dr. Jerry H. Wang (University of Calgary). Polyclonal antibodies against a synthetic peptides derived from amino-terminal region of NCLK (EKIGEGTYGVVYK) and carboxyl-terminal region of Map-kinase p43erk1 (residues 333-367) were prepared in the Medical Research Council, Signal Transduction Antibody Facility of the University of Calgary. The monoclonal antibodies, mAB 88 and mAB 979, against rabbit skeletal muscle phosphorylase kinase were kindly provided by Dr. Gerald M. Carlson, University of Tennessee, Memphis. The monoclonal antibody against protein kinase C was from Amersham Corp. (RPN 536). Synthetic peptide substrates of NCLK (KTPKKAKKPKTPKKAKKL) (20Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z. Wang J.H. J. Biol.

Kemptide (LRRASLG), Syntide 2 (PLARTLSVAGLPGKK), protein kinase C substrate peptide (KRTLRR), and A kinase inhibitory peptide (TTYADPIASGRTGRRNAIHD) were purchased from Sigma. Concentrations of tau, phosphorylase kinase, calmodulin, and phosphorylase were based on their respective absorbance indices (28Cohen P. Eur. J.

The concentration of phosphorylated phosphorylase kinase was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay using phosphorylase kinase as standard. Concentration of the catalytic γ subunit was determined as described previously (30Paudel H.K. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11912-11915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrations of all the other proteins were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. Concentrations of Kemptide, Syntide 2, protein kinase C substrate peptide, and protein kinase A inhibitory peptide were based on their dry weights. Concentrations of all other synthetic peptides were based on their amino acid analyses. Unless otherwise stated, the phosphorylation of various substrates by various kinases was carried out as described previously (32Paudel H.K. Zwiers H. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6207-6213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final concentrations of assay components were 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM DTT, 0.3 mM CaCl2, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM [γ-32P]ATP, 0.1 μM kinase, and 20 μM substrate protein or substrate peptide. When included, the concentration of EGTA was 1 mM. Reactions were initiated by adding a 10-μl aliquot of kinase into 90 μl of the phosphorylation mixture containing the rest of the components of the assay and carried out at 30°C. After the indicated time points, aliquots were withdrawn and analyzed for the amount of radioactivity incorporated into the substrate by the filter paper assay (37Roskoski Jr., R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Phosphorylase kinase assays were carried out as above except the pH of the assay mixture was 8.2. The phosphorylation mixture of A kinase, in addition to all the above components of the assay, also contained 10 μM cAMP. The phosphorylation of tau by the catalytic γ subunit of phosphorylase kinase was carried out as described (30Paudel H.K. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11912-11915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 15 min at room temperature, MgATP was added to initiate the reaction. The final concentrations of various components of the assay were 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM DTT, 0.3 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, 200 mM urea, 25 μg/ml calmodulin, 30 μg/ml γ subunit, and 20 μM tau. After 30 min at 30°C, aliquots were removed and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography to monitor the phosphorylation of tau. SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206989) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were carried out essentially as described (32Paudel H.K. Zwiers H. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6207-6213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To perform slot-blot analysis, samples were applied to a nitrocellulose membrane in a slot-blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) and then the membrane was washed twice with TBS (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.2 M NaCl). The membrane was removed from the slot-blot apparatus, washed once with TBS containing 0.2% Tween (TTBS), and blocked with 5% skim milk in TTBS for 30 min. The blocked membrane was probed with a primary antibody in 5% skim milk in TTBS for 16 h at 4°C and developed with a secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase as described (32Paudel H.K. Zwiers H. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6207-6213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated all procedures were carried out at 4°C. Fresh porcine brain (300 g) was homogenized with a blender in 450 ml of buffer A (50 mMβ-glycerophosphate (pH 7.0), 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EGTA, 10 mM NaF, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml benzamidine. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was filtered through a cheesecloth and the filtrate centrifuged at 105× g for 40 min. Resulting clear supernatant (400 ml) was loaded onto a DEAE Sepharose column (45 × 2.5 cm) previously equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 3 column volumes of buffer A and eluted with 500 ml of a linear gradient (0-0.5 M) of NaCl in buffer A. The effluent fractions containing phosphorylase kinase activity were combined (∼50 ml), concentrated to ∼ 10 ml by aquacide III (Calbiochem), and passed through a Superose 12 gel filtration column (70 × 2 cm) previously equilibrated in buffer B (50 mMβ-glycerophosphate (pH 7.0), 0.5 mM EDTA, and 0. 5 mM DTT) containing 0.1 M NaCl. The effluent containing phosphorylase kinase activity was loaded onto a hydroxylapatite column (12 × 2.5 cm), pre-equilibrated in buffer B. The column was washed with 3 column volumes of buffer B and eluted with 100 ml of a linear gradient (0-0.5 M) of Na2HPO4 (pH 7.0) in buffer B. The eluent from the hydroxylapatite column containing phosphorylase kinase activity was adjusted to 0.3 mM in CaCl2 and loaded onto a ∼1-ml size calmodulin-agarose (Sigma) affinity column previously equilibrated in buffer B containing 0.3 mM CaCl2 and 0.1 M NaCl. The column was washed with 20 ml of equilibration buffer, and the kinase activity was eluted with 1 mM EGTA in buffer B. Effluent fractions (1 ml each) were collected, and those containing phosphorylase kinase activity were stored at 4°C. Tau was phosphorylated by muscle phosphorylase kinase as described above, except here the concentrations of muscle phosphorylase kinase were 0.15 μM. When brain phosphorylase kinase was used, phosphorylation was initiated by adding a 10-μl aliquot from Fig. 2C (fraction 8) to a vial containing 90 μl of reaction mixture that contained all the rest of the components for tau phosphorylation. After 5 h at 30°C, the entire phosphorylation mixture was placed in a boiling water bath for 10 min to denature and precipitate phosphorylase kinase. The boiled sample was centrifuged in a bench-top centrifuge at full speed for 15 min, and the heat-stable, phosphorylated tau was recovered in the supernatant. The recovered phosphorylated tau was desalted on a Sephadex G25 column, lyophilized, redissolved in 200 μl of 50 mM (NH)4HCO3 (pH 8.0) containing 50 μg/ml trypsin and incubated at 37°C for 16 h. After incubation, the sample was injected into a HPLC C18 reverse phase column previously equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-30% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 70 min. Fractions (0.5 ml each) were collected, and an aliquot from each fraction was counted in a liquid scintillation counter to determine the amount of radioactivity in each fraction. To purify phosphopeptides, each of the above fractions containing radioactivity was passed through a Sephadex G25 column (0.8 × 25 cm) pre-equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to separate peptides based on their sizes. The effluent fractions (0.5 ml each) were collected, and each radioactive fraction was vacuum-dried, redissolved in 200 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and rechromatographed through a HPLC column as above, except the acetonitrile gradient was 0-40% in 50 min. Effluent fractions were collected, and those containing radioactivity were subjected to amino acid sequencing. Phosphopeptides were sequence by a gas phase sequencer as described previously (20Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23512-23518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were carried out at the peptide sequencing facilities at The University of Calgary, and Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, University of Victoria. When an extract from fresh porcine brain was chromatographed through a DEAE-Sepharose column and various fractions assayed for tau phosphorylation activity, five prominent activity peaks, designated as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, eluted from the column (Fig. 1A). Immunoblot analysis, using a polyclonal antibody that recognized the amino-terminal region of NCLK, and an activity assay, using a synthetic peptide substrate directed to NCLK, revealed that NCLK did not bind to the column and was recovered in flow-through fractions as reported previously (39Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M.E. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, brain-specific Map-kinases, p43erk1 and p42erk2, were detected within fractions 50-80 by a polyclonal antibody that recognized the carboxyl termini of both p43erk1 and p44erk2. When these fractions were tested against a synthetic peptide substrate directed to these two Map-kinases, a very low phosphotransferase activity was observed (data not shown). These observations suggested that these two brain-specific Map-kinases were almost inactive in the above fractions. It is possible that the two Map-kinases may have been inactivated during the purification. It is also possible that these two Map-kinases in brain extract may require activation as was observed previously (21Drewes G. Lichtenberg-Kraag B. Döring F. Mandelkow E.-M. Biernat J. Goris J. Dorée M. Mandelkow E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2131-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). In any case, these observations indicated that none of the peaks in Fig. 1A correspond to Map kinase or NCLK.

H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 14476-14481) by affecting the formation or stabilization of axonal branches (Schwarz, A., Rapaport, E., Hirschberg, K., and Futerman, A.H. (1995) J. Biol. Chem.270, 10990-10998). We now demonstrate that long term incubation with FB1 affects fibroblast morphology and proliferation. Incubation of Swiss 3T3 cells with FB1 resulted in a decrease in synthesis of ganglioside GM3, the major glycosphingolipid in 3T3 fibroblasts and of sphingomyelin. The projected cell area of FB1-treated cells was ∼45% less than control cells. FB1 had no affect on the organization of microtubules or intermediate filaments, but fewer actin-rich stress fibers were observed, and there was a loss of actin-rich lamellipodia at the leading edge. Three other processes involving the actin cytoskeleton, cytokinesis, microvilli formation, and the formation of long processes induced by protein kinase inhibitors, were all disrupted by FB1. All the effects of FB1 on cell morphology could be reversed by addition of ganglioside GM3 even in the presence of FB1, whereas the bioactive intermediates, sphinganine, sphingosine, and ceramide, were without effect. Finally, FB1 blocked cell proliferation and DNA synthesis in a reversible manner, although ganglioside GM3 could not reverse the effects of FB1 on cell proliferation. Together, these data suggest that ongoing sphingolipid synthesis is required for the assembly of both new membrane and of the underlying cytoskeleton.

The structures of NAP-2, determined by x-ray crystallography, and MGSA, elucidated by NMR spectroscopy, revealed a tetramer and dimer, respectively. In order to address the relevance of multimeric species to their activities on neutrophils, analogs of NAP-2 and MGSA were synthesized in which the backbone amide proton of Leu-22 in NAP-2, and Val-26 in MGSA, was substituted with the bulky methyl group (NH → NCH3). These analogs were shown to be monomeric by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation studies and were similar to the corresponding native protein in assays for neutrophil elastase release and Ca2+ mobilization from IL-8R1 and IL-8R2 transformed cells. Sedimentation equilibrium studies of the native NAP-2 and MGSA were also carried out to address the association behavior. For NAP-2, there was no evidence for the tetramer, but an equilibrium between monomers and dimers and the dissociation constant was calculated to be 50-100 μM. Similarly, MGSA showed a monomer-dimer equilibrium with a Kd of ∼5 μM. The data from the monomeric analogs and also the calculation of dissociation constants indicate that NAP-2 and MGSA have a tendency to associate above the concentrations required for maximal activity or for receptor activation, but at functional concentrations they are predominantly monomers.

INTRODUCTIONRecruitment and accumulation of circulating leukocytes at the site of inflammation are mediated in part by a family of small molecular weight proteins called chemokines (1Miller M.D. Krangel M.S.

They have four conserved cysteines and are called either CXC or CC chemokines, depending on whether the first two cysteines are separated by one amino acid (CXC) or are adjacent (CC). Functionally, the CXC chemokines predominantly attract neutrophils, whereas CC chemokines attract monocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils.Three well studied proteins of the CXC chemokine family are interleukin-8 (IL-8) 1The abbreviations used are: IL-8interleukin-8MGSAmelanoma growth-stimulatory activityNAP-2neutrophil-activating peptide-2RANTESregulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed, and presumably secreted. , melanoma growth-stimulatory activity (MGSA), and neutrophil-activating peptide-2 (NAP-2). The structure of IL-8 has been solved by both NMR and x-ray methods, and both approaches indicated it to be a dimer (4Clore G.M. Appella E. Yamada M. Matsushima K. Gronenborn A.M.

The tertiary and quaternary structures of IL-8 and MGSA are similar, and NAP-2 adopts a similar structure while showing an additional level of complexity by forming a tetramer. The tertiary structure consists of a series of turns and loops in the N-terminal region followed by three β-strands and a C-terminal α-helix. In the dimeric structure, the three β-strands from each monomer form a six-stranded β-sheet with the helices transversing the β-sheet. On the basis of the dimeric structure of IL-8, it was previously thought that dimerization is essential for function. However, we subsequently demonstrated that an analog in which Leu-25 was substituted with N-methylleucine (L25NMe) was monomeric and had similar functional properties as the native IL-8 (19Clark-Lewis I. Dewald B. Loetscher M. Moser B. Baggiolini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16075-16081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of this synthetic IL-8 monomer was solved by 1H NMR spectroscopy and was shown to be largely similar to that of the monomeric unit in the NMR and x-ray structures of the native dimer (16Clark-Lewis I. Schumacher C. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23128-23134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggested that dimerization of IL-8 is essential neither for structural integrity nor for functional activation.Two receptors (IL-8R1 and IL-8R2) that bind CXC chemokines have been identified and characterized in neutrophils, and they belong to the superfamily of seven transmembrane domain-containing proteins that bind to G-proteins. IL-8R2 binds IL-8, MGSA, and NAP-2 with equal affinity. In contrast, IL-8R1 binds only IL-8 with high affinity, but it does bind MGSA and NAP-2 with low affinity (9Rajarathnam K. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M.

Differential binding to the two receptors has been attributed to a region of about 10 residues immediately preceding the first β-strand, and these residues are similarly located away from the interface (17Hébert C.A.

Thus, functional data indicate that the residues at the dimer interface are not directly involved in receptor binding.In order to address the relevance of higher order states observed in structures of NAP-2 and MGSA, monomeric analogs of NAP-2 and MGSA were synthesized using a similar strategy employed in the synthesis of the monomeric IL-8 (19Clark-Lewis I.

For MGSA, Val-26 was substituted with N-methylvaline, and for NAP-2, Leu-22 was substituted with N-methylleucine. In addition to disrupting hydrogen bonding across the dimer interface, the modification also introduces a bulky methyl group, which prevents monomers from coming close to each other. We show here that the monomeric analogs of NAP-2 and MGSA have an activity similar to that of the corresponding native proteins for neutrophil elastase release and induce a similar rise in free Ca2+ in Jurkat cells transfected with either IL8-R1 or IL8-R2, indicating that dimerization is not essential for receptor binding and functional activation. Furthermore, calculations of Kd by sedimentation equilibrium for both NAP-2 and MGSA indicate that they are predominantly monomeric at functional nanomolar concentrations.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7077-7087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) indicated them to be a dimer and tetramer, respectively. The tertiary and quaternary structures of IL-8 and MGSA are similar, and NAP-2 adopts a similar structure while showing an additional level of complexity by forming a tetramer. The tertiary structure consists of a series of turns and loops in the N-terminal region followed by three β-strands and a C-terminal α-helix. In the dimeric structure, the three β-strands from each monomer form a six-stranded β-sheet with the helices transversing the β-sheet. On the basis of the dimeric structure of IL-8, it was previously thought that dimerization is essential for function. However, we subsequently demonstrated that an analog in which Leu-25 was substituted with N-methylleucine (L25NMe) was monomeric and had similar functional properties as the native IL-8 (19Clark-Lewis I. Dewald B. Loetscher M. Moser B. Baggiolini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16075-16081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of this synthetic IL-8 monomer was solved by 1H NMR spectroscopy and was shown to be largely similar to that of the monomeric unit in the NMR and x-ray structures of the native dimer (16Clark-Lewis I. Schumacher C. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23128-23134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggested that dimerization of IL-8 is essential neither for structural integrity nor for functional activation. interleukin-8 melanoma growth-stimulatory activity neutrophil-activating peptide-2 regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed, and presumably secreted. Two receptors (IL-8R1 and IL-8R2) that bind CXC chemokines have been identified and characterized in neutrophils, and they belong to the superfamily of seven transmembrane domain-containing proteins that bind to G-proteins. IL-8R2 binds IL-8, MGSA, and NAP-2 with equal affinity. In contrast, IL-8R1 binds only IL-8 with high affinity, but it does bind MGSA and NAP-2 with low affinity (9Rajarathnam K. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M.

The corresponding positions are 2, 3 and 4 in NAP-2 and 6, 7 and 8 in MGSA. (the “ELR” motif) (Fig. 1) are conserved and are absolutely essential for receptor binding in MGSA, NAP-2, and IL-8 (12LaRosa G.J. Thomas K.M. Kaufmann M.E. Mark R. White M. Taylor L. Gray G. Witt D.

Differential binding to the two receptors has been attributed to a region of about 10 residues immediately preceding the first β-strand, and these residues are similarly located away from the interface (17Hébert C.A. Vitangcol R.V. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18989-18994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Schraufstätter I.U. Ma M. Oades Z.G. Barritt D.S. Cochrane C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10428-10431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mutation of charged residues at the dimer interface in IL-8 had no affect on activity (18Schraufstätter I.U. Ma M. Oades Z.G. Barritt D.S. Cochrane C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10428-10431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, functional data indicate that the residues at the dimer interface are not directly involved in receptor binding. In order to address the relevance of higher order states observed in structures of NAP-2 and MGSA, monomeric analogs of NAP-2 and MGSA were synthesized using a similar strategy employed in the synthesis of the monomeric IL-8 (19Clark-Lewis I. Dewald B. Loetscher M. Moser B. Baggiolini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16075-16081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For MGSA, Val-26 was substituted with N-methylvaline, and for NAP-2, Leu-22 was substituted with N-methylleucine. In addition to disrupting hydrogen bonding across the dimer interface, the modification also introduces a bulky methyl group, which prevents monomers from coming close to each other. We show here that the monomeric analogs of NAP-2 and MGSA have an activity similar to that of the corresponding native proteins for neutrophil elastase release and induce a similar rise in free Ca2+ in Jurkat cells transfected with either IL8-R1 or IL8-R2, indicating that dimerization is not essential for receptor binding and functional activation. Furthermore, calculations of Kd by sedimentation equilibrium for both NAP-2 and MGSA indicate that they are predominantly monomeric at functional nanomolar concentrations."

https://openalex.org/W2058088248,"Using antibody 2H9 from our heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (anti-hnRNP) monoclonal antibody library, we previously showed in HeLa cells that a 35-37-kDa protein doublet switches from the hnRNP complexes to the nuclear matrix following a 10-min heat shock at 45°C (1 Lutz, Y., Jacob, M., and Fuchs, J. P. (1988) Exp. Cell Res. 175, 109-124). cDNA cloning and sequencing revealed an hnRNP protein (2H9) which is a new member of the hnRNP F, H/H¹ family. Protein 2H9 displays two consensus sequence-type RNA binding domains (CS-RBD) showing 80-90% homology with two of the three CS-RBDs of hnRNP F and H/H¹. Another common feature is the presence of two glycine/tyrosine-rich auxiliary domains located at the C terminus and between the two CS-RBDs. At the functional level we show that specific anti-2H9 peptide antibodies can directly inhibit an in vitro splicing system. Moreover, the 2H9 protein doublet is no more present in nuclear extracts from such briefly stressed cells, which interestingly correlates with the inability of these extracts to catalyze in vitro splicing reactions. Taken together, our data suggest that these proteins are involved in the splicing process and also participate in early heat shock-induced splicing arrest by transiently leaving the hnRNP complexes. These 2H9 proteins, which are encoded by a single gene located on human chromosome 10, were also found to be associated with nuclear bodies in situ. Using antibody 2H9 from our heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (anti-hnRNP) monoclonal antibody library, we previously showed in HeLa cells that a 35-37-kDa protein doublet switches from the hnRNP complexes to the nuclear matrix following a 10-min heat shock at 45°C (1 Lutz, Y., Jacob, M., and Fuchs, J.

Most RNA polymerase II transcripts or pre-mRNAs undergo a series of post-translational processing events leading to mRNAs that are further exported to the cytoplasm. This results in the simultaneous presence within the nucleus of a large variety of pre-mRNAs, mRNAs, and intermediate reaction products, which are collectively termed heterogeneous nuclear RNAs (hnRNAs). 1The abbreviations used are: hnRNAheterogeneous nuclear RNAhnRNPheterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteinsnRNPsmall nuclear ribonucleoproteinCS-RBDconsensus sequence RNA binding domainDTTdithiothreitolPBSphosphate-buffered salineSSCsodium chloride/sodium citratePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresismAbmonoclonal antibodypAbpolyclonal antibody. As soon as they emerge from the transcription complex and throughout maturation, hnRNAs interact with hnRNP proteins (hnRNPs) and snRNPs; these assemblies, also called hnRNP complexes, serve as the substrate for RNA processing events, including splicing (2Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Piñol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar, 3Green M.R. Annu. Rev.

Ultrastructural investigations in fact support the idea that the in situ form of these hnRNP complexes are the inter- and perichromatin fibrils (6Fakan S.

Hnlica L.S. Chromosomal Nonhistone Proteins. Vol. 4. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1984: 119-190Google Scholar–14Zeitlin S. Parent A. Silverstein S. Efstratiadis A. Mol. Cell.

Academic Press, Inc., New York1981: 193-246Google Scholar) several have been cloned and sequenced, but there is nevertheless only limited information available on their function, except for a few of them (2Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Piñol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar, 16Rio D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To investigate the structure and the function of the hnRNP proteins, we previously raised a monoclonal antibody library directed against hnRNP complexes purified from HeLa cells (1Lutz Y. Jacob M. Fuchs J.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). heterogeneous nuclear RNA heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein small nuclear ribonucleoprotein consensus sequence RNA binding domain dithiothreitol phosphate-buffered saline sodium chloride/sodium citrate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis monoclonal antibody polyclonal antibody. Among other aspects we used our anti-hnRNP monoclonal antibody library to investigate heat shock-induced splicing arrest. Indeed, splicing was previously shown to be transiently shut down following heat shock at the upper range of the stress response (17Bond U. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3504-3518Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 18Yost H.J. Lindquist S. Cell. 1986; 45: 185-193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Since such a stress does not modify the general characteristics of hnRNP complexes (1Lutz Y. Jacob M. Fuchs J.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 19Kloetzel P.M. Schuldt C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 867: 9-15Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 20Mähl P. Lutz Y. Puvion E. Fuchs J.-P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1921-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we assumed that splicing inhibition might be linked to changes at the level of a limited number of individual proteins. To check this hypothesis we screened our antibody library by indirect immunocytofluorescence on normal and heat-shocked HeLa cells, so as to detect possible differences either in signal intensity or distribution between both types of cells. As early as 10 min after the onset of a heat shock at 45°C, we actually showed that the structure of hnRNP complexes is altered in a very subtle and reversible way. Indeed, among all antibodies from our library, only two of them revealed the kind of differences we were looking for. These antibodies named 2H9 (1Lutz Y. Jacob M. Fuchs J.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and 6D12 (20Mähl P. Lutz Y. Puvion E. Fuchs J.-P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1921-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) recognize a 35-37- and a 72.5-74-kDa protein doublet, respectively. In our immunocytological assay using fixed cells, these antigens were only available to the antibodies in stressed cells, although Western blot analyses showed no quantitative variation in stressed versus normal cells. In stressed cells these antibodies revealed a bright nuclear signal present within the interchromatin space as numerous small dots. This signal persists for 2 h after cells were taken back at 37°C and then gradually decreases and finally disappears after 6 h, which again corresponds to the situation in normal cells. By combining immunological and subcellular fractionation techniques, we could relate this observation to a rapid switch of both protein doublets from the hnRNP complexes to the nuclear matrix, a structure to which they bind very strongly (1Lutz Y. Jacob M. Fuchs J.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Mähl P. Lutz Y. Puvion E. Fuchs J.-P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1921-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the cloning and the sequencing of the 2H9 cDNA that encodes the 35-37-kDa (or 2H9) proteins from HeLa cells. The deduced amino acid sequence shows that they are genuine hnRNP proteins that are related to the hnRNP F and H/H¹ family. In order to check in a direct way whether or not the 2H9 proteins are required for pre-mRNA splicing, we tested the effect of anti-2H9 antibodies on an in vitro cell-free system that faithfully splices E1A transcripts of adenovirus 2 (21Schmitt P. Gattoni R. Keoavong P. Stévenin J. Cell. 1987; 50: 31-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, since stressing HeLa cells for 10 min at 45°C causes nuclear extracts to be inactive in in vitro splicing (22Gattoni R. Mahé D. Mähl P. Fischer N. Mattei M.G. Stévenin J. Fuchs J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2535-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), such extracts were also analyzed and compared with normal extracts, so as to find out whether there is a correlation between the status of these 2H9 proteins in the cell-free system and the fact that within the cell they transiently leave the hnRNP complexes (1Lutz Y. Jacob M. Fuchs J.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody 2H9 (IgG1), which is specific for the 2H9 proteins, was obtained as described previously (1Lutz Y. Jacob M. Fuchs J.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), after immunizing Balb/c mice with hnRNP complexes purified from HeLa S3 cells. Both hybridoma culture supernatant and ascites fluids were used as monoclonal antibody sources. For Western blotting analysis, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose sheets, the blots being further probed with 2H9 supernatant and 125I-labeled anti-mouse Ig-F(ab¹)2 (1Lutz Y. Jacob M. Fuchs J.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Peptidic maps were as described previously (20Mähl P. Lutz Y. Puvion E. Fuchs J.-P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1921-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2H9 proteins were immunoprecipitated from a nuclear extract, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the 35- and 37-kDa bands cut out. Polypeptides were radioiodinated (Na125I) within the gel, using the chloramine-T method, and further hydrolyzed with trypsin or thermolysin. Peptides were resolved in two dimensions on cellulose-coated thin layer chromatography plates and visualized by autoradiography. cDNA cloning was by using a λgt11- and a λgt10-cDNA library. The λgt11 library comprises random-primed cDNAs cloned into the EcoRI site of the expression vector; template RNA was a poly(A+) fraction isolated from human MCF-7 cells. The λgt10 library we constructed according to Sambrook et al. (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) contains oligo(dT)-primed cDNAs cloned into the EcoRI site of the vector; template RNA was a poly(A+) fraction isolated from HeLa S3-cell cytoplasm and purified on poly(U)-Sepharose. cDNA cloning was essentially performed by using standard techniques described by Sambrook et al. (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The random-primed λgt11 library was immunoscreened for cDNA fragments encoding the epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody 2H9. Such fragments were then used to screen the oligo(dT)-primed λgt10 library, in an attempt to isolate full-size cDNAs. For sequencing, cDNA was subcloned into pBluescript SK+ and SK-. After generating a series of partially overlapping deletion mutants, the nucleotide sequence of each cDNA strand was determined according to the chain termination method (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar), using a single primer corresponding to a vector sequence. In some cases primers corresponding to cDNA sequences were used to obtain additional sequence information. Purified cytoplasmic poly(A+) RNA was analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose, 6% formaldehyde gels and transferred to nitrocellulose sheets by capillary blotting with 20 x SSC. Prehybridization and further hybridization with 32P-labeled probes were carried out according to Sambrook et al. (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Recombinant pBluescript was linearized and RNA transcribed in both directions with T3 and T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of m7G(5¹)pppG. In vitro translation in the presence of rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Amersham Corp.) and [35S]methionine was performed according to the manufacturer. Specific translation products were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody 2H9 previously coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose. Proteins were resolved on an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel and the labeled proteins visualized by fluorography. The coding sequence of cDNA 2H9 was engineered by polymerase chain reaction so as to add an NdeI site at the 3¹ end and a BamHI site at the 5¹ end. This cDNA fragment was then cloned either into a pET 3b expression vector (Novagen) or into the same vector we modified by inserting a fragment coding for an N-terminal His-tag. Recombinant protein expression was in Escherichia coli BL21 following isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside induction. For recombinant antigen purification, bacteria from a 500-ml culture were freeze-thawed, resuspended in 20 ml of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 M NaCl in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors, and the lysate further sonicated and centrifuged for 20 min at 110,000 x g. The pellet containing the inclusions was washed two times with buffer D and then dissolved in 2 ml of 6 M urea or guanidine HCl in buffer D, which yields electrophoretically pure antigen. Renaturation was by step dialysis against the same buffer containing 2 M (1.5 h) and 0.5 M (45 min) urea or guanidine HCl. Soluble recombinant protein from the supernatant was purified by immunoaffinity (antigen without His-tag) or by metal affinity chromatography (His-tagged antigen). Immunoaffinity was carried out on Sepharose-antibody columns, the antigen being eluted with 3.5 M NaSCN or 4.5 M MgCl2 and further dialyzed against buffer D. His-tagged antigen was purified by chromatography on a Ni2+ chelation resin according to the manufacturer (Novagen); the antigen was eluted with 0.4 M imidazole in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 M NaCl, and further dialyzed against buffer D. Potentially immunogenic amino acid stretches of the 2H9 protein sequence were determined from the hydrophilicity (25Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17170) Google Scholar) and mobility (26Westhof E. Altschuh D. Moras D. Bloomer A.C. Mondragon A. Klug A. van Regenmortel M.H. Nature. 1984; 311: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) plots drawn from the predicted primary structure. Synthetic peptides with an additional Cys residue were prepared and further coupled to ovalbumin activated with m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-succinimide ester. For polyclonal antibodies, New Zealand rabbits were injected at 2-week intervals with 200 μg of peptide-ovalbumin. Sera were tested by immunoblotting for their ability to react with the 2H9 proteins, and antibodies were further immunopurified on a Sulfolink column (Pierce) coupled to the relevant peptide. For monoclonal anti-peptide antibodies, Balb/c mice were injected at 2-week intervals with 50 μg of peptide-ovalbumin, until specific humoral antibodies were detected. The mice were then given three 10-μg boosts over 3 days. On day 4, splenic cells were fused with X-63 myeloma cells; hybridoma cell lines were established as described previously (1Lutz Y. Jacob M. Fuchs J.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies were purified from ascites liquids on ABx columns (J. T. Baker). HeLa S3 cells were grown in Eagle's suspension medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum and antibiotics (penicillin, 100 IU/ml; streptomycin, 100 μg/ml). For heat treatment, cells were concentrated to 5 x 106 cells/ml and transferred to culture flasks, which were then immersed in a water bath for 10 min at 45°C. Cytoplasmic S100 and nuclear extracts were prepared according to Dignam et al. (27Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G.

Plasmid Sp4 contains the natural E1A sequence (nucleotides 533-1342) of adenovirus 2 between the SmaI and Xba sites of the polylinker of vector pSP65 (21Schmitt P. Gattoni R. Keoavong P. Stévenin J. Cell. 1987; 50: 31-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Capped E1A-precursor RNA was synthesized using Sp6-RNA polymerase in the presence of m7G(5¹)pppG and [α-32P]CTP, and further purified as described previously (21Schmitt P. Gattoni R. Keoavong P. Stévenin J. Cell. 1987; 50: 31-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Splicing reactions were carried out for 2 h at 30°C in 25 μl of reaction mixtures containing 105 cpm of [32P]pre-mRNA (∼4 ng), 10 μl of nuclear extract (6-8 mg of protein/ml) in the presence of 2.6 mM MgCl2, and 60 mM KCl as described previously (21Schmitt P. Gattoni R. Keoavong P. Stévenin J. Cell. 1987; 50: 31-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For studying the direct effect of antibody on splicing, the nuclear extract was preincubated at 0°C for 30 min with either 10 μg of purified monoclonal antibody or 6 μg of purified polyclonal antibody. For control, the nuclear extract was preincubated with either an equal amount of the same antibody previously heat-denatured at 65°C for 10 min or pretreated with 10 mM DTT at 30°C for 30 min, or with nonrelevant antibody. After phenol extraction and purification, RNA was analyzed on 5.2% polyacrylamide gels in 8 M urea. Schaffner HeLa cells (105 cells/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (penicillin, 100 IU/ml; streptomycin 100 μg/ml) were grown on glass slides for 3 days, washed with PBS, and fixed for 4 min with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. When investigating the effect of heat shock, cell cultures were immersed in a water bath for 10 min at 45°C prior to fixation. The cells were then permeabilized for 20 min with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.05% NaN3 in PBS. After several washings with PBS/NaN3, they were incubated overnight with a mixture of 4A8 anti-H1 peptide monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml) and rabbit anti-p80 coilin antibody (1:1000) in PBS. The cells were then washed with PBS/Triton/NaN3 and further incubated for 45 min with a mixture of Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:100, Jackson Immunoresearch Lab.) in PBS/Triton/NaN3. The cells were washed again and DNA counterstained with Hoechst 33258. The preparations were mounted in glycerol/PBS (4:1) containing 5% propylgallate as an anti-oxidant. Immunofluorescence images from 0.6-μm optical sections were obtained using a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a PL APO 100/1.4 oil immersion lens and a krypton-argon laser. Excitation wavelengths of 488 and 568 nm were selected for fluorescein isothiocyanate and Cy3, respectively. Hoechst images were acquired using a Kappa video camera connected to the Leica digitizer. Pseudo-colored images of the signals were generated and further superimposed using an image processing program. In situ hybridization was carried out on chromosomes prepared from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human lymphocytes cultured for 72 h, the last 7 h being in the presence of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (60 μg/ml). The recombinant Bluescript II SK- plasmid containing the 2H9 coding sequence was tritium labeled by nick translation (1.5 x 108 dpm/μg) and hybridized to metaphase spreads (100 ng/ml), as described previously (28Mattei M.G. Philip N. Passage E. Moisan J.P. Mandel J.L. Mattei J.F. Hum. Genet. 1985; 69: 268-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The slides were coated with nuclear track emulsion (Kodak NTB2), exposed for 18 days at 4°C, and then developed. R-banding was performed using the fluorochrome-photolysis-Giemsa method. As described before by Lutz et al. (1Lutz Y. Jacob M. Fuchs J.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the 2H9 proteins (35 and 37 kDa) shown in Fig. 1 (left panel) share a series of characteristics, including a common epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody 2H9. In order to rapidly assess to what extend these two protein species are related, they were purified and further analyzed by peptidic mapping. Following digestion with trypsin (Fig. 1, A and B) or thermolysin (not shown), the two protein species revealed similar maps, thus indicating a high degree of homology. cDNA cloning was therefore expected to lead at least to very close coding sequences. By immunoscreening the random-primed λgt11 expression library with antibody 2H9, we isolated one single positive plaque with a 330-bp insert. Northern blot analysis on poly(A+) mRNA from HeLa cells, using this 330-bp cDNA as a probe, revealed two transcripts of 1.5 and 2.3 kb (Fig. 2). According to their size, both of them might account for the 35- and the 37-kDa proteins, which need a coding sequence at the most of 1000 to 1100 nucleotides. The 330-bp probe was then used to screen the oligo(dT)-primed λgt10 cDNA library. Although numerous positive plaques were obtained, only one of them contained an insert whose size (1.7 kb) was consistent with that of the 2H9 proteins and which also hybridized with both 1.5- and 2.3-kb mRNAs shown in Fig. 2. In order to check whether this 1.7-kb cDNA really encodes one or both of the 35- and 37-kDa proteins, in vitro translation experiments were carried out. Fig. 3 shows that following immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibody 2H9, a 35-37-kDa protein doublet is detected (B, lane 2), the two bands being in the same proportion as in the control nuclear extract (lane 3). These data show that the 1.7-kb cDNA apparently contains the entire coding sequence for both 35- and 37-kDa proteins. However, in terms of size our cDNA lies between the 1.5- and 2.3-kb mRNAs, thus suggesting that it is derived from the larger transcript. The nucleotide sequence of the 1.7-kb cDNA is shown in Fig. 4. This sequence contains a single long translational reading frame of 1038 bp, starting 303 bp from the 5¹-terminus, all other possible frames being less than 200 bp long. The ATG codon at position 303 is flanked by nucleotides matching the translation start consensus sequence (A/G)NNATGG (29Kosak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4164) Google Scholar). The open reading frame, which is terminated by a TGA codon, is followed by 340 bp of 3¹-untranslated sequence which contains an AATAAA polyadenylation signal (position 1406) and a putative ATTTA instability sequence which is thought to be involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression (30Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar). However, although this cDNA contains the entire coding sequence, it is missing the terminal part of the 3¹-untranslated sequence. Indeed, the polyadenylation signal is clearly not in the vicinity of the 3¹ end, which moreover is not terminated by a poly(A) sequence. Whether this 1.7-kb cDNA is really an incomplete copy of the 2.3-kb mRNA was investigated by Northern blotting. 32P-Labeled cDNA probes corresponding to the 5¹-untranslated sequence (Fig. 5, lane 1), to the coding region (not shown), and to a region starting shortly after the stop codon and including the entire downstream 3¹ sequence (lane 2), all hybridized with both 1.5- and 2.3-kb mRNAs. In contrast, a probe spanning the 3¹-terminal sequence located downstream from the polyadenylation site only revealed the 2.3-kb mRNA (lane 3), thus showing that the 1.7-kb cDNA is definitely derived from the 2.3-kb mRNA but lacks the 3¹-untranslated terminal part.Fig. 5Northern blot detection of 2H9 mRNAs with probes spanning different regions of the 1.7-kb cDNA. HeLa-cell poly(A+) RNAs were resolved on a 1.2% formaldehyde agarose gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose. The probes are spanning the 3¹-noncoding region (cDNA fragment, lane 1), the entire 5¹-noncoding region (cDNA fragment: lane 2), and the 40-bp 3¹-terminal sequence located 104 bp downstream from the polyadenylation site (synthetic oligonucleotide: lane 3)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The predicted 2H9 primary sequence corresponds to a protein of 346 amino acids (Fig. 4) with an expected molecular weight of 36,000, which matches the experimental values (35 and 37 kDa). This protein sequence reveals the presence of two consensus sequence RNA-binding domains, CS-RBD I and CS-RBD II, of ∼80 amino acids each. Data base searches (Blitz EMBO) revealed high homologies between these domains and two of the three CS-RBDs of hnRNP F (53 kDa) (31Matunis M.J. Xing J. Dreyfuss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1059-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and the closely related hnRNP H/H¹ (49 kDa) (32Honoré B. Rasmussen H.H. Vorum H. Dejgaard K. Liu X. Gromov P. Madsen P. Gesser B. Tommerup N. Celis J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28780-28789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The sequence alignment (Fig. 6A) reveals homologies of 89% between 2H9-RBD I and F-RBD II, 80% between 2H9-RBD I and H/H¹-RBD II, and 85% between 2H9-RBD II and F- or H/H¹-RBD III. It should be noted that protein 2H9 does not have the F- or H/H¹-RBD I counterpart; the presence of several stop codons in the 5¹-untranslated region of cDNA 2H9, one of them being located nine codons upstream from the initiation codon (Fig. 4), confirms that this RBD is really absent. The primary sequence of protein 2H9 also reveals the presence of two Gly-rich auxiliary domains (Fig. 4), one is located in the central region between the two RBDs (amino acids 96-193; 32% of Gly) and the other is in the C-terminal region (amino acids 273-346; 48% of Gly), starting immediately after RBD II. Gly-rich internal and C-terminal counterparts are also present in hnRNP F (18 and 21% of Gly) and in hnRNP H/H¹ (27 and 23% of Gly). In contrast to the RBDs, the Gly-rich domains are less conserved (Fig. 6B); the internal domain of protein 2H9 shows 50 and 34% homology with that of hnRNP H/H¹ and F, respectively, whereas the C-terminal domain appears to be even less conserved, showing a conspicuous 20-amino acid insert only present in hnRNP H/H¹. Further examination of the two glycine-rich auxiliary domains reveals the presence in protein 2H9 of 17 Tyr residues among which 15 are conserved in hnRNP F or H/H¹ either as Tyr or Phe. In the internal domain, two types of residues are well conserved too: the charged residues (Arg, Lys, Asp, and Glu) and the proline residues which are clustered within a element showing itself a high degree of conservation (2H9 amino acids 101-117). A comparison of the 2H9 Gly-rich domains with the C-terminal Gly-rich domain of the basic hnRNP A1, A2, and B1 proteins (33Burd C.G. Swanson M.S. Görlach M. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although no such repeat is present in the 2H9, F, and H/H¹ proteins, one can, however, notice the presence in protein 2H9 of a short GGXG repeat (Fig. 4, underlined"

Related human pathogens include types of parainfluenza virus, mumps, measles, and respiratory syncytial virus as well as the more distantly related Filoviridae viruses Marburg and Ebola. Animal pathogens comprise Newcastle disease, cattle and bird parainfluenza viruses, canine distemper, and murine pneumonia. An understanding of the functioning of the Sendai virus prototype would provide insights into the function and replication of these ubiquitous human and animal viruses. The genome of the Sendai virus consists of a single strand of RNA with negative polarity that codes for at least six structural and five nonstructural proteins (1Kingsbury D.W. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M.

Virol. 1990; 64: 239-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA core is encapsidated by a helical nucleocapsid protein (NP). Virions enter cells directly through surface membranes, and viral replication and transcription (mediated by viral polymerase) begin immediately in the cytoplasm. Polymerase activity is carried out by the polymerase-associated phosphoprotein (P protein, 1The abbreviations used are: P proteinpolymerase-associated phosphoproteinMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationTOFtime-of-flightHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyTLEthin layer electrophoresisMSmass spectrometry. Mr = 65,000) and the large protein, L protein, (Mr = 200,000) (4Hamaguchi M. Yoshida T. Nishikawa K. Naruse H. Nagai Y.

Almost all of the viral proteins are phosphorylated, however, the P protein appears to be more heavily phosphorylated on a mol/mol basis (6Lamb R.A. Mahy B.W.J. Choppin P.W. Virology. 1976; 69: 116-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 7Hsu C.-H. Kingsbury D.W. Virology. 1982; 120: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The P protein also seems to be modular in nature (8Curran J. Kolakofsky D. Enzyme (Basel). 1990; 44: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). N-terminal and C-terminal domains are conserved among Paramyxoviruses (52% and 69% homology, respectively), while a 100-residue region in the middle is variable with ∼11% homology (9Curran J. Boeck R. Kolakofsky D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3079-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 10Matsuoka Y. Curran J. Pelet T. Kolakofsky D. Ray R. Compans R.W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3406-3410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain has been shown to stabilize the L protein (11Smallwood S. Ryan K.W. Moyer S.A. Virology. 1994; 202: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and the N-terminal region interacts with the NP protein and has been shown to be essential for RNA encapsidation as well as RNA synthesis (12Curran J.

A number of studies were undertaken to locate sites of post-translational modification in order to understand the role that phosphorylation plays in the function of the P protein. In vitro experiments produced conflicting results where phosphorylation sites were detected in the first N-terminal quarter of the protein (7Hsu C.-H. Kingsbury D.W. Virology. 1982; 120: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or in the second N-terminal quarter of the protein (13Vidal S. Curran J. Orvell C. Kolakofsky D. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2200-2203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recent work (14Byrappa S. Hendricks D.D. Pan Y.-B. Seyer J.M. Gupta K.C. Virology. 1995; 208: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) showed that cell-free phosphorylation using virion-associated protein kinase as a phosphorylating agent caused phosphorylation of both serine and threonine. In contrast, intracellular experiments in which the phosphorylation state of the P protein was analyzed during virus replication indicated that phosphorylation occurred only on serine residues. The number of detected phosphorylation sites also differed between the in vitro and the in vivo techniques. Enzymatic digestion of the virion-associated protein kinase-phosphorylated P protein using trypsin followed by two-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis (TLE) produced four major spots and nine minor spots (14Byrappa S. Hendricks D.D. Pan Y.-B. Seyer J.M. Gupta K.C. Virology. 1995; 208: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Similar experiments utilizing intracellular analysis produced one major spot with several minor spots, and it was concluded that the P protein in infected cells was primarily phosphorylated at one adjacent site or a set of adjacent sites (14Byrappa S. Hendricks D.D. Pan Y.-B. Seyer J.M. Gupta K.C. Virology. 1995; 208: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was subsequently used to identify the primary location of phosphorylation on the P protein (15Byrappa S. Pan Y.-B. Gupta K.C. Virology. 1996; 216: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In a parallel effort described here, direct analysis using quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry was employed to identify P protein phosphorylation sites. A quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA) was placed in the vacuum manifold of a TSQ 70 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT) and was interfaced to an external matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) source as described previously (16Jonscher K.R. Currie G. McCormack A.L. Yates III, J.R. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 7: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A 200-μm core-fused silica optical fiber was used to ionize the sample by irradiation with a 337-nm beam from a nitrogen laser (Laser Science, Inc., Newton, MA). The ion trap volume was filled with helium to an uncorrected pressure of 5 × 10−4 torr, then argon was added using a separate needle valve to bring the final uncorrected pressure to 5.5 × 10−4 torr. The addition of ∼10% (pressure/pressure) argon to the trapping volume serves to improve the trapping efficiency (17Morand K.L. Cox K.A. Cooks R.G. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 6: 520-523Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and the resolution of the mass spectrum and slightly increases the amount of fragmentation achieved upon injection into an ion trap. The ion beam was focused into the ion trap using a three-element einzel lens. Typical lens voltages were as follows: lens 1, −5; lens 2, −190; lens 3, −20; ion gate, −200 (open)/+ 200 (closed); trap float, −11, probe held at 5 V. The ion trap scan employed to obtain a single-stage mass spectrum consisted of the following steps (16Jonscher K.R. Currie G. McCormack A.L. Yates III, J.R. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 7: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A 100-ms delay was used to adjust the laser cycle to ∼4.5 Hz. Ions were allowed into the ion trap during a 5-ms ionization period when the gating tube lens was set to “open.” The transistor-transistor logic signal used to trigger the ion gate operation was also employed to trigger the laser to fire ∼500 μs after the ion gate opened. The rf level during the ionization period was typically set to 1154 V0−p. This enabled ions with m/z values above 100 Da to be stably trapped. The amplitude of the rf voltage was ramped to 7500 V0−p in order to eject matrix ions with m/z values less than 650 Da. The electron multiplier was then turned on. Data acquisition was accomplished by ramping the amplitude of the rf signal while applying a supplementary signal to the end cap electrodes to resonantly eject ions through the end cap electrode and into the conversion dynode/electron multiplier detection system (18Kaiser Jr., R.E. Louris J.N. Amy J.W. Cooks R.G. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1989; 3: 225-229Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Kaiser Jr., R.E. Cooks R.G. Stafford Jr., G.C. Syka J.E.P. Hemberger P.H. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. Ion Proc. 1991; 106: 79-115Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Details appear in the relevant figure legends. The conversion dynode and electron multiplier were set at −15 kV and 1.2 kV, respectively, for data acquisition. Supplemental signals were also applied to the end cap electrodes to cause amplification of ion trajectories by resonance excitation (20Kaiser Jr., R.E. Cooks R.G. Syka J.E.P. Stafford Jr., G.C. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1990; 4: 30-33Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Subsequent ion fragmentation was induced by collisions with the helium damping gas and afforded amino acid sequence information. Mass spectra were displayed on a Compaq 386 PC then ported to a DECStation 2100 for data acquisition and analysis. Base-line subtraction at a given threshhold was performed to remove artifacts due to software normalization. A LaserMAT (Finnigan MAT) linear time-of-flight (TOF) instrument was also used to screen fractions for the presence of phosphopeptides and to determine the number of peptides in each sample. Ions generated by the MALDI process were extracted from the source and accelerated into a field-free flight tube employing a 20-kV potential. Detection was accomplished using a 15-kV conversion dynode coupled to an electron multiplier. Recombinant 32P-labeled P protein from Sendai virus was infected into CV1 cells and purified by immunoprecipitation (15Byrappa S. Pan Y.-B. Gupta K.C. Virology. 1996; 216: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), then enzymatically digested with trypsin or chymotrypsin. A portion of the protein digests were separated by two-dimensional TLE. Spots on the gel were excised and peptides were extracted (14Byrappa S. Hendricks D.D. Pan Y.-B. Seyer J.M. Gupta K.C. Virology. 1995; 208: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Aliquots of both the protein digests and the extracted peptides (estimated to contain 1-3 nmol of material) were lyophilized and reconstituted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Aldrich) to a concentration of 0.1-1 mM. This material served as a stock solution and was stored at −4°C. Aliquots of the stock solutions representing an estimated 250 pmol of material were loaded onto a 20-μl Peek injection loop and concentrated by washing with 100% Solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) on an α-Chrom column (300-Å pore diameter packed with Reliasil C18, 2 mm × 10 cm, Upchurch Scientific, Oak Harbor, WA) using an ABI 140B dual pump solvent delivery system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) pumping at a flow rate of 75 μl/min. Peek materials were utilized instead of stainless steel to minimize sample losses due to the interaction of phosphopeptides with iron. Peptides were separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and eluted utilizing a 60-min gradient of 0-80% Solvent B (70:30:0.085 acetonitrile (HPLC grade, EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ):water:trifluoroacetic acid, v/v/v). Peptides were detected by monitoring UV absorbance at a wavelength of 220 nm. Fractions were collected into polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes, lyophilized to dryness (Savant Instruments, Farmingdale, NY) and stored at −4°C. Samples were subsequently reconstituted in 10-15 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid prior to analysis. Manual Edman degradation was performed by reconstituting lyophilized fractions in 10 μl of 5% phenylisothiocyanate in pyridine added to 10 μl of 50% aqueous pyridine, followed by heating at 37°C for 30 min. The organic layer was extracted twice with 20 μl of 2:1 heptane:ethyl acetate, and the aqueous material was lyophilized. Cleavage of the N-terminal amino acid residue was accomplished by adding 10 μl of trifluoroacetic acid to the sample, heating at 37°C for 15 min, and then lyophilizing. A final extraction was made using 30 μl of water combined with 50 μl of n-butyl chloride. The sample was lyophilized and then reconstituted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and applied to the probe tip as described below. The matrix consisted of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich) in an equivolume mixture of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile. An 0.5-μl aliquot of sample was co-deposited onto a gold-plated stainless steel probe tip with 1 μl of matrix and allowed to air dry. The probe was then inserted into the vacuum chamber utilizing a ball valve, and the laser was employed to ionize the sample. A data base consisting of the transcribed genetic sequence of the P protein was constructed. The PEPM™ (Finnigan MAT) algorithm (21Watkins P.J.F. Jardine I. Zhou J.X.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was used to identify all possible sequences of amino acid residues in the data base with molecular masses within ±5 Da of the experimentally determined molecular mass for the peptide of interest. The software also listed the predicted y-, b-, and a-type ions (nomenclature described in 22Roepstorff P. Fohlman J. Biomed. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1984; 11: 601Crossref Scopus (2371) Google Scholar) to aid in the analysis of the fragmentation mass spectra. SEQUEST, a data base-searching algorithm developed in our laboratory (23Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar), was employed to confirm the identification of the amino acid sequences. A list of possible sequences in the P protein data base was generated, and theoretical fragmentation mass spectra were constructed. The experimental fragmentation mass spectra were then compared to theoretical fragmentation mass spectra, scored, and ranked. Peaks in the mass spectra labeled with a “P” refer to fragmentation products generated from a phosphorylated peptide. The notation “γ” refers to the loss of a guanidino group from an Arg-containing ion, while “*” refers to the loss of water or ammonia. Peaks labeled with bnym refer to internal cleavage products from fragmentation at Pro, His, or Arg residues, e.g. given a peptide sequence LPQGW, b2y1 corresponds to PQGW, b2y2 corresponds to PQG, etc. Purified Sendai virus P protein was enzymatically digested using trypsin. Resultant peptides were separated by HPLC, fractions were collected, and samples for mass spectrometric analysis were prepared as described above. The MALDI ion trap and the MALDI TOF were used to screen the fractions for phosphopeptides and to provide a peptide map of the P protein. The ion trap was employed to obtain molecular mass information. The TOF was used to determine the number of peptides in each fraction since the ion trap mass spectra were complicated by the presence of fragmentation products. Some degree of fragmentation of peptide ions upon injection into ion trap mass spectrometers is common. The decomposition provided by metastable decay using the matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid affords abundant sequence-specific fragmentation products that can be diagnostic for the structure of known biological molecules (24Jonscher K.R.

The sequence-specific fragmentation produced upon injection into the ion trap provided verification of peptide assignment without the need to perform an additional tandem mass spectrometry experiment. Fig. 1 shows the amino acid sequence for the P protein and the sequence coverage obtained by tryptic mapping. The tryptic map covered ∼61% of the protein by mass with most of the coverage on the N-terminal half of the protein where the phosphorylation sites were expected (7Hsu C.-H. Kingsbury D.W. Virology. 1982; 120: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Vidal S. Curran J. Orvell C. Kolakofsky D. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2200-2203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trypsin digestion produces 71 expected peptides. Thirty-four peptides were mapped, representing 48% of the expected trypsin fragments. The molecular masses for 25 of the peptides not identified were below the low-mass cutoff determined by the matrix ejection pulse and were not detected. The remaining 12 peptides accounted for 26% of the sequence and were not unambiguously identified. The P protein was also digested with chymotrypsin to identify phosphopeptides not observed in the trypsin digest. One trypsin-generated peptide from HPLC fraction 16 with m/z 2911 was detected. The mass spectrum illustrated in Fig. 2 shows detection of two major peaks with m/z values of 2911 and 2991. These differ in mass by 80 Da, corresponding to the addition of HPO3 to the hydroxyl group on the side chain of Ser. The mass difference suggests that the lighter peptide is the non-phosphorylated version of the heavier peptide. The mass corresponds to that of the tryptic peptide-(255-282) and confirmation of the assignment using the ion trap mass spectrometer is discussed below. Four serine residues are contained within the sequence; thus the site of phosphorylation cannot be assigned based on the molecular mass data. Analysis of trypsin-generated HPLC fraction 16 afforded the mass spectrum shown in Fig. 3. The dominant peak in the spectrum was at m/z 2909, correlating with the signal observed using the TOF mass spectrometer. A small peak at m/z 2989 was observed. The mass difference of 80 Da again indicates that the heavier peptide was probably the phosphorylated analog of the lighter peptide. A strong signal is also observed at m/z 2890. This signal corresponds both to a loss of ∼98 Da (neutral loss of phosphoric acid from the phosphopeptide at m/z 2989) and a loss of water from the unphosphorylated peptide. This loss of 98 has been shown to be a signature for the presence of phosphorylated serine and threonine (28Qin J. Steenvoorden R.J.J.M. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 29Gibson B.W. Cohen P.

R., and Yates, J. R., III (1993) Proceedings of the 41st ASMS Conference on Mass Spectrometry and Allied Topics, May 31-June 4, San Francisco, p. 695a, American Society for Mass Spectrometry, Santa Fe, NM.Google Scholar). A search of the P protein sequence using PEPM™ identified 37 possible peptides with m/z values within ±5 Da of 2909. Of these, five contained Lys or Arg at the C terminus, corresponding to peptides produced by trypsin digestion. Only one of the five sequences corresponded to an expected tryptic fragment, residues 255-282. Theoretical values of b- and y-type ions for the sequence were calculated and compared to the fragment ions observed in the mass spectrum, shown in Fig. 3b). The observed fragment ions correspond to the product ions expected for the tryptic fragment-(255-282) (YNSTGSPPGKPPSTQDEHINSGDTPAVR) confirming the sequence assignment made using TOF analysis. The expected fragmentation products for the unphosphorylated sequence are displayed in Fig. 3a and observed ions are underlined. Unphosphorylated sequence ions corresponding to the major peaks in the mass spectrum were identified as were minor peaks arising from fragmentation of the phosphorylated species. The presence of a series of y- and b-type ions served to confirm the sequence assignment. Signal suppression of b-type ions is due to the large number of proline residues present. A number of signals were present corresponding to internal cleavages of the peptide modulated by proline and histidine residues. These peptides provided particularly strong signals when the C-terminal amino acid was Asp, in agreement with recent observations (28Qin J. Steenvoorden R.J.J.M. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The signal from the phosphorylated molecular ion was weak and a series of low abundance peaks afforded by fragmentation of the phosphopeptide were present. The presence of the y23 ion as well as its phosphorylated analog indicate that Ser-260 is the most likely site of phosphorylation. The phosphorylated analogs of y26-28 as well as b10, b14, b16, b19, b21-23, b26, and b28 also serve to confirm the identification. Contributions to low abundance signals can also arise from the presence of other co-eluting peptides. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments (15Byrappa S. Pan Y.-B. Gupta K.C. Virology. 1996; 216: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have shown that Ser-Pro is a consensus sequence for phosphorylation of the P protein. The phosphopeptide generated using the trypsin digest contains four serine residues at Ser-257, Ser-260, Ser-267, and Ser-275. Only Ser-260 is followed by a proline; thus, the identification of Ser-260 as the phosphorylated residue would agree with the proposed mechanism of a proline-mediated kinase. The SEQUEST data base-searching program was subsequently used to confirm the sequence assignment. Results in Fig. 3c indicate that the expected sequence was chosen as the first-ranked choice. The final ranking is determined by the value for Cn, and the answer is assumed to be reliable if the Cn value for the first choice is much greater than the Cn value for the second choice (23Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar). This is the case for the sequence assignment in Fig. 3c; thus, the manually determined answer was verified by computer-aided interpretation. Additional stages of mass spectrometry were done on the most abundant fragmentation products (MS/MS and MS3); however, no additional sequence information was obtained. Subdigestion of the fraction on the probe tip using Asp-N was attempted but the resulting peptides were not detected. The same phosphorylated peptide sequence was identified using a sample extracted from the two-dimensional TLE experiment (data not shown). The SEQUEST program is capable of searching sequences for post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation. For the phosphopeptides identified in this work, the best results were obtained by searching using the unphosphorylated mass on a sequence data base where phosphorylation was not included. We infer from this that the facile loss of phosphoric acid from the phosphopeptide tends to suppress further fragmentation; therefore, fragmentation proceeds primarily from the unphosphorylated species. Similar effects have been observed on another MALDI-ion trap mass spectrometer (27Qin J. Chait B.T. Proceedings of the 43rd ASMS Conference on Mass Spectrometry and Allied Topics, Atlanta, May 21-26. American Society for Mass Spectrometry, Santa Fe, NM1995: 989Google Scholar). In previous work (15Byrappa S. Pan Y.-B. Gupta K.C. Virology. 1996; 216: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), digestion with chymotrypsin and subsequent two-dimensional TLE of the peptides produced two spots. In the present work, two candidate phosphopeptides were also observed when screening the fractions collected from the chymotrypsin digest. Two major peaks of m/z 1738 and m/z 1807 from HPLC fraction 13 were detected in the mass spectrum displayed in Fig. 4. The 69-Da difference between the peaks does not correlate well with the expected 80-Da mass difference between ions resulting from the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of the peptide. However, subsequent analysis of this fraction by ion trap mass spectrometry revealed the presence of a co-eluting peak at m/z 1728, corresponding to the non-phosphorylated version of the peptide of m/z 1807. The broadened peak in Fig. 4 that was assigned to m/z 1738 results from the combined presence of m/z 1728 and m/z 1743, a co-eluting peptide identified as the chymotryptic fragment HIITDRGGKTDNTDSL, residues 429-444. The low resolution linear TOF mass spectrometer was not able to discriminate between the peaks at that molecular mass. The peptide of m/z 1728 corresponds to the chymotryptic fragment from residues 240-255. Ser-249 is the only serine residue contained in this sequence; thus, the site of phosphorylation was straightforward to assign. Analysis of chymotrypsin-generated HPLC fraction 13 produced the mass spectrum shown in Fig. 5b. The dominant peak in the mass spectrum was at m/z 1709. An abundant signal at m/z 1807 correlated with that observed on the time-of-flight instrument. A small peak at m/z 1728 was also observed. The mass difference of 79 Da indicates that the peptide at m/z 1728 is the non-phosphorylated version of the peptide at m/z 1807. The mass difference of 98 Da between the peaks at m/z 1807 and m/z 1709 suggests that the lighter peptide results from the facile loss of phosphoric acid from the heavier peptide as well as from the loss of water from m/z 1728. The presence of a low abundance signal from a co-eluting peak at m/z 1743 corresponding to residues 429-444 was also observed. The PEPM™ software was used to search the P protein data base for amino acid sequences with a mass of 1728 Da. Of 36 possible peptides identified, seven contained a C-terminal residue resulting from chymotrypsin cleavage on the carboxyl side of tyrosine, tryptophan, leucine, or phenylalanine. Five of these peptides corresponded to expected chymotrypsin-generated fragments. One step of manual Edman degradation was performed as described above, and the resulting mass spectrum is shown in Fig. 6. The mass-to-charge ratios of the ions shifted by approximately 100 Da, e.g. 950 Da → 850 Da →, 1487 Da → 1388 Da →, 1667 Da → 1567 Da →, and 1709 Da → 1610 Da, indicating valine or threonine as likely candidates for the N-terminal residue. Only two peptides out of the five possibilities contained Val or Thr at the N terminus. Expected values for b- and y-type ions were calculated and compared with the experimental spectrum in Fig. 5b. The sequence of the chymotryptic peptide TPATVPGTRSPPLNRY (residues 240-255) fit the experimental data, strongly suggesting that the phosphorylation site was at Ser-249. This peptide was also generated as the top-ranked choice by SEQUEST, shown in Fig. 5c. The expected fragmentation products for the peptide sequence are displayed in Fig. 5a, and observed ions are underlined. The presence of a series of b- and y-type ions served to confirm the sequence identification. Some signal suppression following Pro or Gly was observed. A loss of 43 Da corresponding to the loss of the guanidino group from b-type ions containing arginine was observed for most of the b ions. Similar losses have been observed for the Arg-containing model peptide angiotensin using this instrument. The presence of phosphorylated analogs of b10 and y7, as well as y8, y10, b12, b14, and b16 afforded positive identification of Ser-249 as the site of phosphorylation. The Edman degradation results (Fig. 6) confirm the identification also with the presence of the phosphorylated analogs of b9 and y7, as well as b11, b14, and y13. An internal cleavage product RSPPLN, as well as its phosphorylated analog, were also observed. Further confirmation for the sequence identification was provided by analysis using electrospray ionization on a TSQ700 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (data not shown) and by site-directed mutagenesis. The identification of the site of phosphorylation agrees with the proline-mediated kinase mechanism discussed above (15Byrappa S. Pan Y.-B. Gupta K.C. Virology. 1996; 216: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The same results were obtained by analysis of peptides extracted from one of the spots on the two-dimensional TLE gel (data not shown).Fig. 6Fragmentation mass spectrum resulting from one stage of manual Edman degradation of m/z 1728. Operating conditions were as described for the analysis of m/z 1728.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The mass spectrum shown in Fig. 7 results from analysis of HPLC fraction 25 and shows the presence of two major peaks. The signals at m/z 2732 and m/z 2811 differ by 79 Da; thus, the lighter peptide appears to be the nonphosphorylated version of the heavier peptide. The mass of this peptide did not correspond to an expected chymotryptic fragment. Further analysis by ion trap mass spectrometry (see below) was used to assign the peptide to residues 228-253, a peptide overlapping that identified from HPLC fraction 13. Mass spectrometric analysis of chymotrypsin-generated HPLC fraction 25 afforded the mass spectrum shown in Fig. 8b. The dominant peak in the spectrum was at m/z 2710 and an abundant signal was also observed at m/z 2728, correlating with data obtained by TOF methods. The phosphorylated analog appeared with low abundance at m/z 2809, which was an 80-Da mass difference from the peak at m/z 2728 and a 98-Da mass difference from the peak at m/z 2710. Again, a facile loss of phosphoric acid was observed. PEPM™ was used to search the data base for all peptides with m/z values of 2730 Da ± 5 Da. The search produced 35 possible peptides. Of these, four sequences theoretically resulted from cleavage with chymotrypsin. Signals at 2616 and 2599 Da were used to generate possibilities for the largest b- and y-type ions. The largest y-type ion could correspond to a loss of 112 Da or 129 Da, indicating Leu, Ile, Asn, Lys, Gln, and Glu as possibilities. The largest b-type ion could correspond to a loss of 95 Da or 112 Da, indicating Leu, Ile, Asn, and Pro as possibilities. Sequences for all peptides with these possible terminating ions were investigated. Mass assignment errors in the ion trap can arise from the use of a two-point calibration rather than a five-point calibration for the extended mass range, as well as shifting caused by space-charge effects; thus, the mass windows considered were rather large. An MS/MS experiment (data not shown) indicated that the peaks at m/z 2175 and 1294 were from the precursor ion at m/z 2730. Expected sequence ions for 20 possible sequences were compared with the experimental mass spectrum. The sequence with the best fit corresponded to residues 228-253 (KRRPTNSGSKPLTPATVPGTRSPPLN). This peptide overlaps the phosphopeptide with m/z 1728 from residues 240-255. The expected fragmentation products appear in Fig. 8a, and observed signals are underlined. The presence of a series of b- and y-type ions were sufficient to verify the sequence assignment. As expected, fragmentation was suppressed in the vicinity of proline residues, and a signal from a number of internal cleavage products was observed. There are three serine residues found in this peptide. Since only peak differences of 80 Da were observed using the TOF, we assume that the overlap peptide was phosphorylated at only one site. The observation of phosphorylated analogs of b25, y25, y22-20, y18, y16-15, y13-12, y10, and y8 serve to confirm the site of phosphorylation on Ser-249 rather than on Ser-234 or Ser-236. In addition, only Ser-249 is followed by a proline residue, agreeing with the proposed kinase mechanism (15Byrappa S. Pan Y.-B. Gupta K.C. Virology. 1996; 216: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The same results were obtained by analysis of peptides extracted from one of the spots on the two-dimensional TLE gel (data not shown). Three phosphopeptides were observed using MALDI/quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry. Digestion with trypsin produced one phosphopeptide corresponding to residues 255-282, while digestion with chymotrypsin produced two phosphopeptides that overlapped in sequence. The smaller peptide corresponding to residues 240-255 contained one serine residue at Ser-249. The larger overlap peptide corresponded to residues 228-253 with Ser-249 again identified as the site of phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2008142084,"Pleckstrin is the major substrate phosphorylated on serine and threonine in response to stimulation of human platelets by thrombin (Abrams, C. S., Zhao, W., Belmonte, E., and Brass, L. F. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 23317-23321). We now show that pleckstrin in platelets is in a complex with inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase I (5-phosphatase I). This enzyme hydrolyzes the 5-phosphate from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and thus serves as a calcium signal-terminating enzyme, since the substrates but not the products mobilize intracellular calcium. Pleckstrin co-immunoprecipitates with 5-phosphatase I in homogenates of platelets. Platelet homogenates fractionated by anion exchange chromatography show co-elution of pleckstrin and 5-phosphatase I. Fractions containing phosphorylated pleckstrin have 7-fold greater 5-phosphatase activity than those containing unphosphorylated pleckstrin. Mixing experiments with recombinant 5-phosphatase I and pleckstrin in vitro show that they form a stoichiometric complex. A mutant form of pleckstrin, in which the serine and threonine residues that are phosphorylated by protein kinase C are substituted with glutamic acid (pseudophosphorylated pleckstrin), activates recombinant 5-phosphatase I 2-3-fold while native unphosphorylated pleckstrin does not stimulate the enzyme. Thus pleckstrin functions to terminate calcium signaling in platelets when it is phosphorylated by binding to and activating 5-phosphatase I. Pleckstrin is the major substrate phosphorylated on serine and threonine in response to stimulation of human platelets by thrombin (Abrams, C. S., Zhao, W., Belmonte, E., and Brass, L. F. (1995) J.

Thus pleckstrin functions to terminate calcium signaling in platelets when it is phosphorylated by binding to and activating 5-phosphatase I. Inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases comprise a large family of enzymes that share two short amino acid motifs that define the family (2Majerus P.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1051-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). They show varying substrate specificities toward the 5-phosphate containing inositol phosphates and phospholipids.

Bansal V.S. Bross T.E. Irvine R.F. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2146-2149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme is most likely to function as a signal-terminating enzyme since its substrates function to mobilize calcium ions while its products do not. A previous study suggested that 5-phosphatase I was phosphorylated in response to thrombin and thereby activated. 5-Phosphatase I purified from platelets was phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase C and activated 4-fold under this condition (5Connolly T.M. Lawing Jr., W.J. Majerus P.W. Cell. 1986; 46: 951-958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This would provide one mechanism for terminating Ins(1,4,5)P3-stimulated calcium mobilization. Subsequent to this study, cDNA clones encoding 5-phosphatase I were isolated, and the recombinant protein was expressed in heterologous systems (6Laxminarayan K.M. Chan B.K. Tetaz T. Bird P.I.

The specific activity of the recombinant enzyme is about 50 times greater than that purified from platelets suggesting that the platelet enzyme was not homogeneous. We now report that 5-phosphatase I exists as a complex with another protein, pleckstrin, in platelets. When pleckstrin is phosphorylated in the complex, 5-phosphatase I is activated.

These proteins include phospholipase C enzymes, small guanine nucleotide binding proteins, β-adrenergic receptor kinases, β-spectrin, and dynamin. The function of pleckstrin homology (PH) motifs is uncertain although elucidation of their three-dimensional structures indicates that they share a fold and therefore constitute a common motif despite limited amino acid similarity. Several of these motifs have been shown to bind to acidic phospholipids, especially phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (13Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W.

PH motifs have also been shown to bind to the βγ subunits of trimeric G proteins and thereby presumably inhibit further signaling from an agonist-activated receptor (12Inglese J. Koch W.J. Touhara K.

This effect was observed in response to both G protein-linked and tyrosine kinase-linked receptors and thus cannot be explained solely by binding to βγ subunits. We now report a function for platelet pleckstrin. The protein forms a 1:1 complex with 5-phosphatase I, and upon phosphorylation of the former, the latter is activated. [32P]Orthophosphate was from ICN and 32P-labeled Ins(1,4,5)P3 was prepared as described (19Downes C.P. Mussat M.C. Michell R.H. Biochem. J. 1982; 203: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG and Western blot detection reagents were purchased from Amersham Life Sciences. The PVL 1392 baculoviral transfer vector and BaculoGold transfection kit were from PharMingen. pBluescriptSK and competent Escherichia coli were obtained from Stratagene. Anti-pleckstrin antibody was made as described (18Abrams C.S. Wu H. Zhao W. Belmonte E. White D. Brass L.F. J. Biol.

T4 DNA ligase, monoclonal HA antibody, and restriction enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Polymerase chain reaction reagents and Taq polymerase were from Perkin-Elmer. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. cDNA molecules encoding pleckstrin and variant forms of pleckstrin were constructed as described previously (1Abrams C.S. Zhao W. Belmonte E. Brass L.F.

These cDNA were then subcloned into a derivative of the plasmid vector PET-IIb that had been modified to contain sequences encoding six histidine residues at the amino terminus of the expressed protein. Proteins were expressed in E. coli as described previously (20Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) and purified using nickel-agarose (Qiagen). Recombinant proteins were eluted from nickel-agarose using 20% glycerol, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 100 mM potassium chloride, 5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF, and 80 mM imidazole. cDNA encoding a truncated version of 5-phosphatase I in pCMV2 plasmid was provided by C. A. Mitchell (6Laxminarayan K.M. Chan B.K. Tetaz T. Bird P.I. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17305-17310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using a human umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA library as template. The sense primer included an EcoRI site followed by nucleotide −3 to nucleotide 16 of human 5-phosphatase I cDNA (5′-ttaagaattcaccatggcggggaaggcgg-3′); the antisense primer contained the complement of nucleotides 107-128 (5′-gtgtgcacgacctggtaaaat-3′). The polymerase chain reaction products were cleaved with EcoRI and PstI. The digested products containing nucleotides −3 to 88 were subcloned into pBluescriptSK. Nucleotides 89-1784, obtained by PstI digestion of the truncated 5-phosphatase I in pCMV2 plasmid, were subcloned into pBluescriptSK. The full-length cDNA was subsequently engineered into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL 1392 between the EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites. Sf9 cells grown at 27°C in TNM-FH insect medium (PharMingen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 100 μg of gentamicin/ml were infected with the baculovirus construct containing 5-phosphatase I. Sf9 cells were cultured either in monolayer or in suspension (2 × 106 cells/ml at the start of infection), and recombinant protein was harvested at 72 h after infection. Full-length 5-phosphatase I cDNA was isolated from pVL 1392 by EcoRI and NaeI restriction and transferred into pGEX-5x-1 plasmid between EcoRI and SmaI restriction sites. The plasmid was used to transform XL2 Blue E. coli (Stratagene). E. coli were grown in LB medium containing 20 μg of ampicillin/ml. After overnight culture, isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (1 mM) was added, and 4 h later E. coli were harvested by centrifugation and the cells were resuspended in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium azide, 1 μM pepstatin A, and 50 μM PMSF. The suspension was frozen at −70°C and thawed slowly on ice; lysozyme was added to the final concentration of 1 mg/ml, and the mixture was incubated at 4°C for 30 min. DNase I (0.25 μg/ml original bacterial suspension) and MgCl2 (final concentration, 10 mM) were added and incubated for 1 h on ice. The final suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 × g, and the supernatant was passed through GST-agarose columns equilibrated with 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT. After washing with this buffer, the bound protein was eluted using 20 mM reduced GSH in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5. 32P-Labeled Ins(1,4,5)P3 hydrolysis was measured as described previously (3Connolly T.M. Bross T.E. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7868-7874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antisera against a peptide that represents amino acids 49-64 of 5-phosphatase I (MALHCQEFGGKNYEAC) were produced in rabbits (Pocono Rabbit Farm, Cacadensis, PA). For immunoblot analysis, proteins separated by 10% SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with the antipeptide antiserum at 1:1000 dilution overnight at 4°C. Detection was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham). Human platelets were obtained from normal donors. Platelet isolation, labeling, and stimulation were performed as described previously (5Connolly T.M. Lawing Jr., W.J. Majerus P.W. Cell. 1986; 46: 951-958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Platelets (1 × 109 in 1 ml) were labeled in 15 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, and 5.6 mM glucose containing 1 mCi of 32PO4. 5-Phosphatase I was extracted by suspending 1 × 109 platelets in 200 μl of 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.2, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.3 M sucrose, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 μM PMSF, and 1% Triton X-100. The suspension was agitated at 4°C overnight and centrifuged at 14,000 × g. The supernatant containing both cytosolic and membrane proteins was collected. Sf9 cell extracts were prepared by suspending Sf9 cells in 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.2, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.3 M sucrose, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 μM PMSF, and 1% Triton X-100. The extraction was as described above for platelets. The extract (8 mg of protein) was applied to a 1-ml Mono Q column equilibrated in 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.2, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100. The column was eluted at 1 ml/min with linear NaCl gradients as follows: 0-10 min, equilibration buffer; 10-30 min, 0-0.15 M NaCl in equilibration buffer; 30-40 min, 0.15-0.3 M NaCl in equilibration buffer; 40-50 min, 0.3-1.0 M NaCl in equilibration buffer. For Mono Q chromatography of labeled platelet extracts, the platelets were extracted at 4°C overnight in 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.2, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 μM pepstatin A, 4 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 μM PMSF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM sodium molybdate, and 4 mM sodium pyrophosphate. The extract from 1 × 109 labeled platelets was applied to the column equilibrated with 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.2, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mM sodium molybdate, and 4 mM sodium pyrophosphate. The column was eluted with the same gradient as described above. The extract from 2.5 × 107 labeled platelets was incubated with 10 μg of anti-5-phosphatase I IgG at 4°C for 1 h in 20 μl containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 μM pepstatin A, and 1% Triton X-100. Protein A-Sepharose (40 μl of a 50% slurry in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) was added, and the mixture was agitated at 4°C for 1 h. The protein A-Sepharose pellets were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with 1 ml of the same buffer. The washed pellets were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The extract from 1 × 107 labeled platelets was also run on the same gel to serve as a marker for phosphorylated proteins. In some experiments 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide was substituted for DTT in the gel loading buffer in order to visualize proteins migrating in the region near IgG when membranes were immunoblotted. For immunoprecipitation with monoclonal anti-HA antibody, 2.5 μg of purified GST-5-phosphatase I fusion protein and 0.16 μg of HA-tagged pleckstrin were incubated with 0.3 μg of monoclonal anti-HA antibody (IgG2b) or irrelevant IgG2b in 30 μl of 80 mM imidazole, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 50 μM PMSF, 20% glycerol at 4°C for 1 h. 30 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose previously equilibrated with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 was added, and after centrifugation the pellet was washed three times with 1 ml of the above buffer and mixed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide in place of DTT. The samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with a mixture of anti-pleckstrin antibodies and anti-5-phosphatase I antibodies. The amount of each protein was estimated by comparing the band intensity of the immunoblots to those of known amounts of the recombinant proteins. 1.6 nmol of GST or GST-5-phosphatase I fusion protein were linked to 1-ml GST-agarose columns, equilibrated with 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100. 200 μg of platelet extract was applied to each column, and they were then washed with 10 column volumes of equilibrating buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with 5 column volumes of 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mM GSH, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and 20 μl of each was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-pleckstrin antibody. The fraction of pleckstrin in the eluates was estimated by comparison of the immunoblots of varying amounts of platelet extracts with those of the eluates. Pleckstrin, pseudophosphorylated pleckstrin, or ΔPH pleckstrin, in which both pleckstrin domains were deleted, were added to 0.4 μg of purified 5-phosphatase I in 10 μl containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and 3 mM MgCl2. The mixtures were immediately diluted with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and 3 mM MgCl2 and assayed for 5-phosphatase activity. The same procedures were used with GST-5-phosphatase I fusion protein as a source of 5-phosphatase. The quantities of recombinant proteins used in various experiments were estimated by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE and were determined to be of >95% purity. For immunoblotting, pleckstrin antibody was diluted 1:10,000 and incubated with membranes overnight at 4°C. It was previously reported that a human platelet inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (designated 5-phosphatase I) was phosphorylated and activated by protein kinase C (5Connolly T.M. Lawing Jr., W.J. Majerus P.W. Cell. 1986; 46: 951-958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Since this protein is approximately the same size as the major protein phosphorylated in platelets in response to thrombin, pleckstrin was assumed to be that protein. Recently cDNA molecules encoding 5-phosphatase I have been isolated (6Laxminarayan K.M. Chan B.K. Tetaz T. Bird P.I. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17305-17310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Verjans B. De Smedt F. Lecoco R. Vanweyenberg V. Moreau C. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and the predicted sequence bears no primary sequence similarity to pleckstrin (10Tyers M. Rachubinski R.A. Stewart M.I. Varrichio A.M. Shorr R.G.L. Haslam R.J. Harley C.B. Nature. 1988; 333: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). There are now tools including recombinant proteins and antibodies that allow a re-examination of the relationship between pleckstrin and 5-phosphatase I. Initially we carried out SDS-PAGE of platelet proteins and performed Western blots using antibodies against 5-phosphatase I and pleckstrin to identify these proteins. While the proteins have approximately the same mass, they are readily separated on SDS-PAGE with 5-phosphatase I migrating at an apparent molecular weight slightly greater than that of pleckstrin as show in Fig. 1A (lanes 1 and 2). The platelets in this experiment were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate to identify the proteins phosphorylated in response to thrombin as shown in Fig. 1B (compare Western blot in lanes 3 and 4 to autoradiography in B). It is clear that pleckstrin is the major phosphoprotein in this experiment. Since the amount of pleckstrin in platelets (0.1% of platelet protein 2C. S. Abrams and S. E. Rittenhouse, unpublished observations. ) is approximately 25 times that of 5-phosphatase I, it is not possible to determine whether 5-phosphatase I in platelets was also phosphorylated in this experiment. The amount of 5-phosphatase I was estimated by Western blot analysis of different amounts of platelets compared to Western blots of purified recombinant 5-phosphatase I. To determine whether 5-phosphatase I was also phosphorylated, we immunoprecipitated 5-phosphatase I from extracts of 32P-labeled platelets (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, we found that essentially all of the major protein, phosphorylated in response to thrombin, was immunoprecipitated with 5-phosphatase I antibody (compare lane 2 to lane 5 in Fig. 2). A lighter exposure of this autoradiograph confirmed that most of the radiolabeled 40-kDa protein was immunoprecipitated (data not shown). The protein must be pleckstrin since this is the major protein phosphorylated under these conditions as shown in Fig. 1. This appears to be a specific association since other proteins phosphorylated in platelets are not enriched in the immunoprecipitate, and there is very little radioactivity precipitated by preimmune serum. We used a recombinant fusion protein consisting of 5-phosphatase I linked to glutathione S-transferase (GST-5-phosphatase I) to demonstrate directly that pleckstrin binds to 5-phosphatase I. Platelet extracts were passed over columns of GST-agarose and GST-5-phosphatase I-agarose. The bound proteins were eluted with GSH and then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Pleckstrin was eluted from the GST-5-phosphatase column (lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 3A) but not the GST column (lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 3A). By comparing to Western blots of varying amounts of platelet extracts, we estimated that approximately 22.5% of pleckstrin in the extracts were recovered from the GST-5-phosphatase I-agarose column. We also immunoprecipitated 5-phosphatase I from platelet extracts and then separated the immunoprecipitate by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-pleckstrin antibodies showing co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3B). The stoichiometry of the association was determined in an experiment where HA-tagged pleckstrin was mixed with an excess of 5-phosphatase I and the complex was precipitated with an anti-HA antibody followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with both anti-pleckstrin and anti-5-phosphatase I as shown in Fig. 4A. Pleckstrin was immunoprecipitated since no pleckstrin was detected in the supernatant of the immunoprecipitate. The amount of 5-phosphatase I in this immunoprecipitate was estimated by comparing this blot to Western blots of serial dilutions of 5-phosphatase I (Fig. 4B). We found 0.7 mol of 5-phosphatase I/mol of pleckstrin indicating a stoichiometric association between these proteins. We next determined the effect of the association between pleckstrin and 5-phosphatase I on 5-phosphatase catalytic activity. In this experiment we mixed pleckstrin, pseudophosphorylated pleckstrin, and ΔPH pleckstrin (in which both PH domains are deleted) with purified recombinant 5-phosphatase I (specific activity, 120 μmol of Ins(1,4,5)P3 hydrolyzed per min per mg of protein). Only the pseudophosphorylated form of pleckstrin affected enzyme activity using Ins(1,4,5)P3 as substrate as shown in Fig. 5. There was a 2.1-fold increase in activity observed in this experiment with the maximal effect observed at approximately 1 mol of pleckstrin/mol of 5-phosphatase I. In other experiments the activation ranged from 2- to 3-fold. This result implies that phosphorylated pleckstrin binds and activates 5-phosphatase I. We measured the effect of pleckstrin and pseudophosphorylated pleckstrin on the hydrolysis of varying concentrations of Ins(1,4,5)P3 by recombinant 5-phosphatase I. We found a Km of 7.7 μM with both pleckstrins, while the Vmax of pleckstrin-5-phosphatase I was 121 μmol of InsP2 formed per min per mg protein and that of pseudophosphorylated pleckstrin-5-phosphatase I complex was 291 μmol of InsP2 formed per min per mg of protein. Thus phosphorylation of pleckstrin increases the Vmax of 5-phosphatase I without changing Km as reported previously, using partially purified 5-phosphatase I (5Connolly T.M. Lawing Jr., W.J. Majerus P.W. Cell. 1986; 46: 951-958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The Km value that we obtained is similar to that reported by others (7Verjans B. De Smedt F. Lecoco R. Vanweyenberg V. Moreau C. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Mitchell C.A. Connolly T. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8873-8877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also carried out this experiment using the fusion protein GST-5-phosphatase I with a similar result although in this case native pleckstrin also stimulated enzyme activity when added in large amounts (10 pleckstrin/GST-5-phosphatase). We also mixed recombinant 5-phosphatase II (another form of inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase that is found in platelets) with pseudophosphorylated and native pleckstrin and found no effect on enzyme activity (data not shown). In order to evaluate whether phosphorylated pleckstrin also activates 5-phosphatase I in platelets, we fractionated extracts from platelets on a Mono Q column and subjected each fraction to Western blotting with both anti-pleckstrin and anti-5-phosphatase I antibodies and assayed enzyme activity. Another sample of 32P-labeled platelets was also fractionated on Mono Q and subjected to autoradiography to locate phosphorylated pleckstrin as shown in Fig. 6. Western blotting indicated that both proteins were eluted together in fractions 21-27 with pleckstrin continuing to fraction 31 as shown in Fig. 7. The phosphorylated pleckstrin eluted almost entirely in fraction 21 as shown in Fig. 6. The 5-phosphatase activity was also highest in this fraction indicating that pleckstrin also activates the enzyme in platelets when it is phosphorylated. By comparing the intensity of the 5-phosphatase I immunoblots, we estimate that phosphorylation increases enzyme activity by at least 7-fold (compare fractions 21 and 23 in Fig. 7, A and B). The specific activity is also high in fraction 20, which contains some phosphorylated pleckstrin (Fig. 6); however, the amount of 5-phosphatase I in this fraction is below the detection limit of Western blotting (Fig. 7A) so that specific activity cannot be calculated. It is possible that pleckstrin also binds to other proteins in platelets since some phosphorylated pleckstrin is in fraction 27. The 5-phosphatase activity in this fraction includes 5-phosphatase II, which is another major inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase in platelets, that eluted in fraction 27, and 5-phosphatase I in this fraction cannot be estimated (21Mitchell C.A. Connolly T. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8873-8877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 7Chromatography of platelet extracts on Mono Q.

B, 5-phosphatase I activity of fractions from Mono Q chromatography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have demonstrated that pleckstrin plays a role in phosphatidylinositol-mediated calcium signaling. When pleckstrin is phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues in response to thrombin, it binds to and activates 5-phosphatase I thereby accelerating the degradation of the calcium ion-mobilizing messenger molecule Ins(1,4,5)P3. Since the amount of pleckstrin in platelets is approximately 25 times that of 5-phosphatase I and the complex between the two is stoichiometric, it is clear that most of the platelet pleckstrin must have another function. Additionally, since most of the pleckstrin phosphorylated after thrombin treatment of platelets is immunoprecipitated by 5-phosphatase I, it is clear that most of pleckstrin is not phosphorylated in response to thrombin. It has been suggested that pleckstrin also leads to inhibition of phosphatidylinositol turnover in response to agonists (18Abrams C.S. Wu H. Zhao W. Belmonte E. White D. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14485-14492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This would also serve to diminish calcium mobilization and thus the molecule may have a concerted action in terminating agonist responses. The effect on 5-phosphatase I is direct since pseudophosphorylated pleckstrin activates recombinant 5-phosphatase I in vitro. These results can explain our previous report that protein kinase C phosphorylates and activates platelet 5-phosphatase I. That preparation of enzyme had an activity of 4 μmol of Ins(1,4,5)P3 hydrolyzed per min per mg of protein compared with 120 μmol of Ins(1,4,5)P3 hydrolyzed per min per mg of protein for recombinant 5-phosphatase I purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. Since pleckstrin forms complexes with 5-phosphatase I and activates it, the earlier preparation undoubtedly contained pleckstrin as the major Coomassie Blue staining protein. Thus in the presence of protein kinase C, pleckstrin, which was the major protein in the partially purified enzyme preparation, was phosphorylated, and the phosphorylation of pleckstrin that bound to 5-phosphatase activated the enzyme. We cannot exclude the possibility that 5-phosphatase I is also phosphorylated. In two-dimensional gels in which one dimension is SDS-PAGE and the other is isoelectric focusing, 5-phosphatase I appears as a series of discrete spots (after Western blotting) along the pH dimension characteristic of phosphorylated proteins such as pleckstrin (data not shown). It is possible that this finding does not reflect phosphorylation but some other modification since at least in Sf9 cells labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, 5-phosphatase I appears not to be labeled and recombinant 5-phosphatase I purified from E. coli does not appear to be a substrate for protein kinase C (8Erneux C. De Smedt F. Moreau C. Rider M. Communi D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 598-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, it has been reported that Sf9 cells are devoid of protein kinase C activity (22Ahmad S. Safa A.R. Glazer R.I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10313-10318Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The function of pleckstrin domains remains uncertain in most cases. Several studies have suggested that proteins containing pleckstrin domains bind phospholipids in order to anchor proteins to membranes (13Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 23Davis L.H. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4409-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lombardo C.R.

In the studies reported here there is a clear action of pleckstrin that involves a direct protein-protein interaction without any role for lipids."

The enzyme exhibits a very high sequence similarity to the oligo-1,6-glucosidases (O16G) of Bacillus thermoglucosidasius and Bacillus cereus which cannot act on trehalose. These three enzymes share 80% identical residues within the conserved regions (CR), which have been suggested to be located near or at the active site of the α-amylase family enzymes. To identify by site-specific mutagenesis the critical residues that determine the broad substrate specificity of the SAM1606 enzyme we compared the CR sequences of these three glucosidases and selected five targets to be mutagenized in SAM1606 α-glucosidase, Met76, Arg81, Ala116, Gly273, and Thr342. These residues have been specifically replaced by in vitro mutagenesis with Asn, Ser, Val, Pro, and Asn, respectively, as in the Bacillus O16G. The 12 mutant enzymes with single and multiple substitutions were expressed and characterized kinetically. The results showed that the 5-fold mutation virtually abolished the affinity of the enzyme for α,α′-trehalose, whereas the specificity constant for the hydrolysis of isomaltose, a good substrate for both the SAM1606 enzyme and O16G, remained essentially unchanged upon the mutation. This loss in affinity for trehalose was critically governed by a Gly273→ Pro substitution, whose effect was specifically enhanced by the Thr342→ Asn substitution in the 5-fold and quadruple mutants. These results provide evidence for the differential roles of the amino acid residues in the CR in determining the substrate specificity of the α-glucosidase. The Bacillus sp.

https://openalex.org/W1996386713,"Polymerization of Alzheimer amyloid β peptide (Aβ) into amyloid fibrils is associated with resistance to proteolysis and tissue deposition. Here, it was investigated whether Aβ might be generated as a protease-resistant core from a polymerized precursor. A 100-amino acid C-terminal fragment of the Alzheimer β-amyloid precursor protein (C100), containing the Aβ and cytoplasmic domains, polymerized both when inserted into membranes and after purification. When subjected to digestion using the nonspecific enzyme proteinase K, the cytoplasmic domain of C100 was degraded, whereas the Aβ domain remained intact. In contrast, dissociated C100 polymers were almost completely degraded by proteinase K. Mammalian cells transfected with the human Alzheimer β-amyloid precursor gene contained a fragment corresponding to C100, which needed similar harsh conditions to be dissolved, as did polymers formed by purified C100. Hence, it was concluded that C100 polymers are formed in mammalian cells. These results suggest that the C terminus of Aβ can be generated by nonspecific proteases, acting on a polymerized substrate, rather than a specific γ-secretase. This offers an explanation of how the Aβ peptide can be formed in organelles containing proteases capable of cleaving most peptide bonds. Polymerization of Alzheimer amyloid β peptide (Aβ) into amyloid fibrils is associated with resistance to proteolysis and tissue deposition. Here, it was investigated whether Aβ might be generated as a protease-resistant core from a polymerized precursor. A 100-amino acid C-terminal fragment of the Alzheimer β-amyloid precursor protein (C100), containing the Aβ and cytoplasmic domains, polymerized both when inserted into membranes and after purification. When subjected to digestion using the nonspecific enzyme proteinase K, the cytoplasmic domain of C100 was degraded, whereas the Aβ domain remained intact. In contrast, dissociated C100 polymers were almost completely degraded by proteinase K. Mammalian cells transfected with the human Alzheimer β-amyloid precursor gene contained a fragment corresponding to C100, which needed similar harsh conditions to be dissolved, as did polymers formed by purified C100. Hence, it was concluded that C100 polymers are formed in mammalian cells. These results suggest that the C terminus of Aβ can be generated by nonspecific proteases, acting on a polymerized substrate, rather than a specific γ-secretase. This offers an explanation of how the Aβ peptide can be formed in organelles containing proteases capable of cleaving most peptide bonds."

In the past, a COOH-terminal “cystine knot” motif has been found that is similar to von Willebrand factor; this region is generally known to be responsible for dimerization processes. Furthermore, a “complement control protein” motif is present as an internal cysteine-rich domain in FIM-B.1. We characterize here the missing 75% toward the NH2 terminus of the FIM-B.1 precursor by molecular cloning. Analogous to prepro-von Willebrand factor, four elements with considerable similarity to D-domains are present (i.e. D1-D2-D′-D3). These domains have been described as essential for the multimerization of von Willebrand factor. Thus, the general structure of FIM-B.1 resembles that of the human mucin MUC2 as well as prepro-von Willebrand factor; these three molecules at least seem to share common structural elements allowing similar multimerization mechanisms.

INTRODUCTIONDuring phylogeny, mucus gels have been conserved as the essential extracellular matrices that protect delicate epithelial surfaces in many ways (1Forstner J.F. Forstner G.G. Johnson L.R.

Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 57-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Mucins have been established as the molecules that primarily determine the defined rheological and viscoelastic properties of these gels. The key step in the formation of such a three-dimensional complex network is the ordered aggregation of linear rodlike monomeric mucins (3Carlstedt I. Sheehan J.K. Nugent J. O'Connor M. Ciba Foundation Symposium 109 on Mucus and Mucosa. Pitman, London1984: 157-166Google Scholar). The stiff and extended conformation of the monomers is the result of highly O-glycosylated repetitive serine/threonine-rich regions (4Jentoft N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 291-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). In contrast, aggregation to multimers is achieved via cysteine-rich modules. Two models would describe such a network: (i) a cross-linked network model and (ii) an entangled network model. However, only the latter fulfills the physicochemical criteria that define a dynamic mucus gel (5Verdugo P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 157-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).Due to technical problems, complete molecular structures of mucins are still rare. For example, more than seven human MUC genes (6van Klinken B.J.-W. Dekker J. Büller H.A. Einerhand A.W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G613-G627PubMed Google Scholar), bovine and porcine salivary mucins (7Bhargava A.K. Woitach J.T. Davidson E.A. Bhavanandan V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6798-6802Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 8Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. Abernethy J.L. Zhao Y. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9678-9686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as three frog integumentary mucins (FIM-A.1, 1The abbreviations used are: FIMfrog integumentary mucinPCRpolymerase chain reactionvWFvon Willebrand factorRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsSCRshort consensus repeatCPcomplement control protein motif. FIM-B.1, FIM-C.1) have been at least partially characterized (9Hoffmann W. Hauser F. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 105B: 465-472Google Scholar). The latter represent typical extracellular mosaic proteins with astonishing structural similarities to other peptides and proteins (10Hoffmann W. Joba W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). FIM-B.1 from Xenopus laevis certainly shows the most interesting molecular architecture. However, only about 25% from the COOH-terminal portion of the sequence has been reported thus far. In addition to a variable number of O-glycosylated type B repeats responsible for polydispersities (11Joba W. Hoffmann W. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), FIM-B.1 contains at least two different cysteine-rich modules: (i) internally, the “complement control protein motif” (CP, also known as “Shushi structure” or “short consensus repeat” (SCR) (12Probst J.C. Hauser F. Joba W. Hoffmann W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6310-6316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and (ii) a COOH-terminal region with homology to von Willebrand factor (vWF) (13Probst J.C. Gertzen E.-M. Hoffmann W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6240-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In vWF, this part is responsible for dimerization (14Voorberg J. Fontijn R. Calafat J. Janssen H. van Mourik J.A. Pannekoek H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A motif spanning 11 cysteine residues named “cystine knot” has been proposed as the active site of the latter (15Meitinger T. Meindl A. Bork P. Rost B. Sander C. Haasemann M. Murken J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and is responsible for dimerization of certain cytokines as well (16McDonald N.Q. Hendrickson W.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 421-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the cystine knot motif has also been found in a variety of other mucins, e.g. bovine salivary mucin (7Bhargava A.K. Woitach J.T. Davidson E.A. Bhavanandan V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6798-6802Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), porcine salivary mucin (8Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. Abernethy J.L. Zhao Y. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9678-9686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), MUC2 (17Gum J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Rothe E.-M. Lagace R.E. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21375-21383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rMUC2/rMLP (18Xu G. Huan L.-J. Khatri I.A. Wang D. Bennick A. Fahim R.E.F. Forstner G.G. Forstner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5401-5407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and MUC5 (19Lesuffleur T. Roche F. Hill A.S. Lacasa M. Fox M. Swallow D.M. Zweibaum A. Real F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13665-13673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) as well as the human sublingual gland mucin MG1 (20Troxler R.F. Offner G.D. Zhang F. Iontcheva I. Oppenheim F.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1112-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recently, dimerization of MUC2 has been reported (21Asker N. Baeckström D. Axelsson M.A.B. Carlstedt I. Hansson I. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and for porcine salivary mucin it has been clearly shown that it forms dimers via its COOH-terminal domain (22Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9845-9850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, this motif is now considered to trigger homodimerization as an early event in the biosynthesis of many mucins.We report here the full-length sequence of the FIM-B.1 precursor starting with the signal sequence as deduced from cDNA cloning.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of mRNA from the skin of a single adult X. laevis (purchased from the Herpetological Institute, Dr. W. de Rover, Belgium), cyclic thermal amplification via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and purification and sequencing of plasmid DNA as well as computerized analysis and homology searches have been described previously (12Probst J.C. Hauser F. Joba W. Hoffmann W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6310-6316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In order to elongate the incompletely known nucleotide sequence encoding the COOH-terminal portion of FIM-B.1 toward the 5′-end, a multistep amplification procedure (RACE protocol) has been employed (23Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4321) Google Scholar). Starting from the region encoding the CP motif (12Probst J.C. Hauser F. Joba W. Hoffmann W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6310-6316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the oligonucleotide SCR1 d(CACAGCTTGGTGTATTTC) was used as a specific primer for cDNA synthesis. After dC tailing, amplification occurred with Taq polymerase and a combination of oligonucleotides REP7 d(CCCTCGAGAATTCGGATCCTGCTACCGTTCCGTTT) and PCR5′ d(CCGGATCCTCGAGAATTCTAGA(G)14). The underlined region is complementary to part of the CP motif in FIM-B.1 (12Probst J.C. Hauser F. Joba W. Hoffmann W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6310-6316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After subcloning the products into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pBluescript-II/SK− (Stratagene), clone pS5R7-2 was obtained. Further cDNA clones were generated in a similar way by a multistep amplification procedure using a set of specific primers toward the 5′-end (Fig. 1C).Based on this sequence information obtained from relatively short cDNA clones, long overlapping cDNA clones were generated by PCR and subsequently analyzed (Fig. 1B).RESULTSFig. 2 represents the cDNA sequence obtained from a set of overlapping clones using the RACE protocol toward the very 5′-end. The deduced amino acid sequence encodes the amino-terminal portion of the FIM-B.1 precursor, starting with the signal sequence until it reaches the CP motif (which served as the anchor for the first specific oligonucleotide used). However, the CP motif cloned here does not show the identical sequence as characterized previously (12Probst J.C. Hauser F. Joba W. Hoffmann W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6310-6316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two CP motifs differ in precisely two point mutations also changing two amino acid residues: K to E and A to G. These two mutations have been confirmed to be highly specific by the analysis of a series of independent cDNA clones. In order to distinguish between these two CP motifs, we designated them SCR (12Probst J.C. Hauser F. Joba W. Hoffmann W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6310-6316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and SCR* (sequence from Fig. 2). Thus, we assumed that the FIM-B.1 precursor could theoretically contain at least two CP motifs that differ slightly.Fig. 2Nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of the amino-terminal portion of the FIM-B.1 precursor. This sequence was compiled from the cDNA clones shown in Fig. 1B, which were all obtained from a single individual. Two point mutations were observed in clone pF18F38-3 in its overlapping region with pF30F56-4. The T at position 1950 is changed to C (Ile → Thr mutation on amino acid level) and at position 2147 the G is changed to A (Asp → Asn mutation). Restriction sites are marked. The presumed signal sequence of the precursor, as well as potential N-glycosylation sites, is underlined. Also denoted are the cysteine-rich domains homologous to vWF (D1-D2-D′-D3) and the CP motif.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test this hypothesis, oligo(dT)-primed cDNA from X. laevis skin was amplified with Taq polymerase using the oligonucleotides FIM8 d(CCCGGATCCTCGAGAATTCAAATCAAGCTATAACAG) and SCR4 d(CCCGGATCCGCACAACCTCCCTTTTT). The underlined part in FIM8 represents positions 3979-3995 from Fig. 2, and SCR4 is complementary to the SCR motif (12Probst J.C. Hauser F. Joba W. Hoffmann W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6310-6316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and does not recognize SCR*. After subcloning the PCR products into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pBluescript-II/SK−, clones pF8S4.2-5, −7, and −8 were characterized (Fig. 3). All three clones indeed contained two different CP motifs (i.e. SCR* and SCR). However, the clones were not identical but differed in their repetitive parts by specific insertions and deletions. Such polydispersities are typical of FIM-B.1 and have been shown to result from alternative splicing of repetitive cassettes (11Joba W. Hoffmann W. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Molecular analysis of cDNA clones containing two CP motifs in FIM-B.1. PCR-generated clones pF8S 4.2-5, −7, and −8 were obtained from a single individual. These clones were compared with the corresponding sequence from pS3F26-3 shown in Fig. 2. The two CP motifs detected are denoted as SCR and SCR*. Furthermore, polydispersities in the repetitive part are indicated by stars (representing gaps). Bars denote identical nucleic acid residues.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe combined amino acid sequences deduced in Fig. 2, Fig. 3 now complete the missing amino-terminal portion of FIM-B.1. Together with the published COOH-terminal part (12Probst J.C. Hauser F. Joba W. Hoffmann W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6310-6316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Probst J.C. Gertzen E.-M. Hoffmann W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6240-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the FIM-B.1 precursor consists of at least about 2700 amino acid residues (Fig. 4) encoded by a polydisperse mRNA population with a length of more than 8.3 kilobases. This is in fairly good agreement with Northern blot analysis which revealed a smear of up to 10 kilobases (24Hoffmann W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7686-7690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig. 4, the difference is probably due to the existence of a polydisperse cluster of additional CP motifs and repetitive highly O-glycosylated regions (25Joba W. Molekulare Charakterisierung des Integument-Muzins FIM-B. 1 aus Xenopus laevis. Doctoral dissertation, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (Fakultät für Chemie und Pharmazie), Munich, Germany1995Google Scholar). In particular, multiple CP motifs could represent potential anchor points that non-covalently cross-link mucin subunits.Fig. 4Schematic structure of the FIM-B.1 precursor. Shown is the modular arrangement compiled from analyses of the NH2-terminal portion (see Fig. 2, Fig. 3) as well as the COOH-terminal end (12Probst J.C. Hauser F. Joba W. Hoffmann W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6310-6316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Probst J.C. Gertzen E.-M. Hoffmann W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6240-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). All repetitive O-glycosylated portions (indicated by knobs) have been shown to be polydisperse within a single animal; furthermore, length variations within these tandem repeats are the likely reason for the genetic polymorphism observed between different individuals. The signal sequence is shown in black, whereas the cysteine-rich modules homologous to vWF are hatched; CK denotes the cystine knot motif (15Meitinger T. Meindl A. Bork P. Rost B. Sander C. Haasemann M. Murken J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The various CP motifs are dotted. Arrows denote the cleavage site by signal peptidase and a potential processing site (?) possibly generating a pro-sequence analogous to vWF. Variations in the inner core of FIM-B.1 are indicated by slashes; they are probably due to the existence of a polydisperse cluster of CP motifs and O-glycosylated type B repeats with the motif GESTPAPSETT (13Probst J.C. Gertzen E.-M. Hoffmann W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6240-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Hoffmann W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7686-7690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The amino-terminal portion of the FIM-B.1 precursor presented here can be clearly divided into separated domains. As is typical of secretory proteins, the sequence starts with a hydrophobic signal sequence that is probably cleaved off after alanine 19 (Fig. 2). Then a mainly basic repetitive region follows with the motif PAKGG. For this glycine-rich (until glycine-77) sequence a β-turn structure can primarily be expected. Similar terminal sequences have been detected in cytokeratins (26Hoffmann W. Sterrer S. Königstorfer A. FEBS Lett. 1988; 237: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and synapsins (27Südhof T.C. Czernik A.J. Kao H.-T. Takei T. Johnston P.A. Horiuchi A. Kanazir S.D. Wagner M.A. Perin M.S. De Camilli P. Greengard P. Science. 1989; 245: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Starting with proline 78, the pattern changes drastically to a threonine-rich sequence also containing proline and alanine. Such a composition is typical of mucins (2Strous G.J. Dekker J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 57-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 4Jentoft N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 291-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar); however, the acid residues flanking some threonine residues at positions −1 probably diminish their potential to become O-glycosylated (28Nehrke K. Hagen F.K. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7061-7065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Similarly, as shown previously for type B repeats (12Probst J.C. Hauser F. Joba W. Hoffmann W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6310-6316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), analysis of further cDNA clones revealed polydispersities by insertion of a variable number of tandem repeats with the motif PAATDSET after amino acid 122 (25Joba W. Molekulare Charakterisierung des Integument-Muzins FIM-B. 1 aus Xenopus laevis. Doctoral dissertation, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (Fakultät für Chemie und Pharmazie), Munich, Germany1995Google Scholar). Thus, the sequence given in Fig. 2 represents a minimal length variant within a polydisperse population.Certainly one of the most interesting domains in FIM-B.1 is the cysteine-rich region between positions 172 and 1330 (Fig. 2) because it reveals pronounced similarities with pro-vWF (29Verweij C.L. Diergaarde P.J. Hart M. Pannekoek H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In particular, three subdomains with internal homology (named D1, D2, and D3) as well as a truncated version located between D2 and D3 (designated as D′) can be recognized. This set of D-domains has been reported to be obligatory for multimer assembly of pro-vWF (30Wagner D.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 217-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This biosynthetic event occurs unusually late in trans-Golgi and post-Golgi acidic compartments (30Wagner D.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 217-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and seems to be independent of dimerization in the endoplasmic reticulum (31Voorberg J. Fontijn R. van Mourik J.A. Pannekoek H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Furthermore, multimerization via the D1 and D2 domains plays an important role in storage granule formation (32Wagner D.D. Saffaripour S. Bonfanti R. Sadler J.E. Cramer E.M. Chapman B. Mayadas T.N. Cell. 1991; 64: 403-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Small vWF multimers are secreted constitutively, whereas large multimers are packed into Weibel-Palade bodies and then released via the regulated pathway (30Wagner D.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 217-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An analogous domain structure (as in vWF and FIM-B.1) has also been reported for the amino-terminal part of MUC2 (33Gum J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddiki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2440-2446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (which also forms multimers (34McCool D.J. Forstner J.F. Forstner G.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)). As shown in Fig. 5, nearly all cysteine residues are conserved in these three molecules. However, the general similarity of the sequences is not particularly pronounced. The two most conserved continuous stretches of amino acid residues are regions in the D1 and the D3 domain with the sequences TCGLCG and VCGLCGN, respectively. Remarkably, the vicinal cysteine residues in the underlined CGLCG motifs are similar to those at the active site of disulfide isomerase, and they have been proposed to play a role in multimerization of pro-vWF (35Mayadas T.N. Wagner D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3531-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In the mature vWF (after cleavage of its pro-sequence (i.e. at the D2/D′ junction; see Fig. 5)), homophilic intersubunit disulfide bonds have been determined within the D3 domain at positions Cys-379 (36Dong Z. Thoma R.S. Crimmins D.L. McCourt D.W. Tuley E.A. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6753-6758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Cys-459, Cys-462, and Cys-464 (37Azuma H. Hayashi T. Dent J.A. Ruggeri Z.M. Ware J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2821-2827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The homologous cysteine residues are conserved in FIM-B.1 and MUC2 (indicated by triangles in Fig. 5). Whether proteolytic processing of the FIM-B.1 precursor occurs similarly to pro-vWF is not known yet. A potential cleavage site would be next to the D2/D′ junction between positions 888 and 889 of the FIM-B.1 precursor (sequence SRKR↓T; Fig. 5) liberating a polydisperse mucin-like pro-peptide. This sequence is close to the equivalent position in pro-vWF and also remarkably resembles the known processing site in the vWF precursor (sequence RSKR↓S; Fig. 5). It is noteworthy that proteolytic cleavage of pro-vWF is not essential for multimer formation (38Verweij C.L. Hart M. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7921-7924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, many mucins seem to mimic the covalent stepwise aggregation of vWF to linear clusters. Molecular structures supporting such a model are now available for MUC2 (33Gum J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddiki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2440-2446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rMUC2 (39Ohmori H. Dohrman A.F. Gallup M. Tsuda T. Kai H. Gum J.R. Kim Y.S. Basbaum C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17833-17840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), FIM-B.1, and obviously also porcine salivary mucin (22Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9845-9850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, partial sequences of MUC5 (19Lesuffleur T. Roche F. Hill A.S. Lacasa M. Fox M. Swallow D.M. Zweibaum A. Real F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13665-13673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), bovine salivary mucin (7Bhargava A.K. Woitach J.T. Davidson E.A. Bhavanandan V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6798-6802Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and MG1 (20Troxler R.F. Offner G.D. Zhang F. Iontcheva I. Oppenheim F.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1112-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) indicate that these mucins could follow the same common hypothetical scheme. Also, the sperm membrane protein zonadhesin (40Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26025-26028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) containing a mucin-like domain and a cluster of D-domains would be a candidate for a similar molecular mechanism. However, based on the observation that vWF D-domains bind heparin (41Meyer D. Girma J.-P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), non-covalent interactions of mucin D-domains with sulfated carbohydrates should also be taken into consideration. Such a lectin bond-mediated polymerization model has already been proposed in the past for mucus gels (42Silberberg A.

Mucins have been established as the molecules that primarily determine the defined rheological and viscoelastic properties of these gels. The key step in the formation of such a three-dimensional complex network is the ordered aggregation of linear rodlike monomeric mucins (3Carlstedt I. Sheehan J.K. Nugent J. O'Connor M. Ciba Foundation Symposium 109 on Mucus and Mucosa. Pitman, London1984: 157-166Google Scholar). The stiff and extended conformation of the monomers is the result of highly O-glycosylated repetitive serine/threonine-rich regions (4Jentoft N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 291-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). In contrast, aggregation to multimers is achieved via cysteine-rich modules. Two models would describe such a network: (i) a cross-linked network model and (ii) an entangled network model. However, only the latter fulfills the physicochemical criteria that define a dynamic mucus gel (5Verdugo P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 157-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).Due to technical problems, complete molecular structures of mucins are still rare. For example, more than seven human MUC genes (6van Klinken B.J.-W. Dekker J. Büller H.A. Einerhand A.W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G613-G627PubMed Google Scholar), bovine and porcine salivary mucins (7Bhargava A.K. Woitach J.T. Davidson E.A. Bhavanandan V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FIM-B.1, FIM-C.1) have been at least partially characterized (9Hoffmann W. Hauser F. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 105B: 465-472Google Scholar). The latter represent typical extracellular mosaic proteins with astonishing structural similarities to other peptides and proteins (10Hoffmann W. Joba W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). FIM-B.1 from Xenopus laevis certainly shows the most interesting molecular architecture. However, only about 25% from the COOH-terminal portion of the sequence has been reported thus far. In addition to a variable number of O-glycosylated type B repeats responsible for polydispersities (11Joba W. Hoffmann W. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), FIM-B.1 contains at least two different cysteine-rich modules: (i) internally, the “complement control protein motif” (CP, also known as “Shushi structure” or “short consensus repeat” (SCR) (12Probst J.C. Hauser F. Joba W. Hoffmann W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6310-6316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and (ii) a COOH-terminal region with homology to von Willebrand factor (vWF) (13Probst J.C. Gertzen E.-M. Hoffmann W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6240-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In vWF, this part is responsible for dimerization (14Voorberg J. Fontijn R. Calafat J. Janssen H. van Mourik J.A.

Its expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes induces a voltage-dependent potassium current similar to that seen in vivo. Indirect evidence has fueled speculation that function requires association of MinK and another protein endogenous to oocytes and native tissues. In this report, we show that direct covalent modification of an oocyte membrane protein alters properties of the MinK ion conduction pore; modified channels exhibit decreased potassium conduction and increased permeability to sodium and cesium. The modifying reagents, two membrane-impermeant, sulfhydryl-specific methanethiosulfonate derivatives, react only from the extracellular solution at rates that are determined by the conformational state of the channel. These findings indicate that MinK is intimately associated with an oocyte protein whose exposure to the external solution changes during channel gating and which acts with MinK to establish ion conduction pore function.

Ion channel proteins form transmembrane aqueous pores that open and close in response to specific stimuli and thereby mediate cellular electrical activity. Voltage-gated K+ channels govern the activity of cyclically excitable tissues (like nerves and muscles) by acting to repolarize cells after stimulation. Originally isolated from rat kidney based on its ability to induce voltage-activated K+ currents in Xenopus oocytes (1Takumi T. Ohkubo H. Nakanishi S. Science. 1988; 242: 1042-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), MinK enjoys wide tissue distribution in mammals (2Swanson R. Hice R.E. Folander K. Sanguinetti M.C. Sem. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 117-124Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In oocytes, MinK currents exhibit many characteristics of classical voltage-dependent, K+-selective channels (3Hausdorff S.F.

Physiol. 1994; 267: C857-C864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); this has led to the hypothesis that MinK underlies these currents in vivo. Because MinK bears no sequence homology to other K+ channel proteins, uncertainty has surrounded its role in channel function. Early confusion that MinK could regulate Cl− channels (9Attali B. Guillemare E. Lesage F. Honore E. Romey G. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. Nature. 1993; 365: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) has proven to be an artifact of over-expression (10Shimbo K.

J. 1995; 69: 904-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and given way to the sentiment that MinK is a structural protein intrinsic to channel formation (4Goldstein S.A.N. Miller C. Neuron. 1991; 7: 403-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, point mutations have identified MinK residues that modify almost all channel functions including activation by voltage (12Takumi T. Moriyoshi K. Aramori I. Ishii T. Oiki S. Okada Y. Ohkubo H.

Neuron. 1991; 7: 403-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 16Wang K.W. Tai K.K. Goldstein S.A.N. Neuron. 1996; 16: 571-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that a domain of MinK lines the external portion of the ion conduction pore (16Wang K.W. Tai K.K. Goldstein S.A.N. Neuron. 1996; 16: 571-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). When mutated to cysteine, sites in this domain render channels susceptible to covalent block by methanethiosulfonate ethylsulfonate (MTSES−) 1The abbreviations used are: MTSES−methanethiosulfonate ethylsulfonateMTSEA+MTS-ethylammoniumMTSET+MTS-ethyltrimethylammoniumTEAtetraethylammoniumNMDG+N-methyld-glucamine. and alter its reversible inhibition by tetraethylammonium (TEA). That TEA blockade is sensitive to the concentration of permeant ions inside the cell (as well as transmembrane voltage) and that MTSES− and TEA compete for overlapping MinK binding sites argue that both bind to the external end of the MinK conduction pore, ∼15% of the way through the potential drop across the membrane. methanethiosulfonate ethylsulfonate MTS-ethylammonium MTS-ethyltrimethylammonium tetraethylammonium N-methyld-glucamine. The subunit composition of MinK channels has also been a matter of controversy (13Wang K.W. Goldstein S.A.N. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1303-1309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 17Tzounopoulos T. Guy H.R. Durell S. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9593-9597Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). With the exception of MinK, cloned K+ channel subunits possess one or two highly conserved, pore-forming P domains (18Ketchum K.A. Joiner W.J. Sellers A.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Goldstein S.A.N. Nature. 1995; 376: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 19Goldstein S.A.N. Price L.A. Rosenthal D.N. Pausch M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13256-13261Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), while voltage-gated Ca2+ and Na+ channel subunits contain four P domains (20Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer, Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). In those channels, the ion conduction pathway is formed by four P domains supplied by four, two, or one subunit, respectively (21MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 889-892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). 2K. W. Wang and S. A. N. Goldstein, unpublished data. MinK has no P domains by which to predict its subunit stoichiometry. We have supported a heteromultimeric model containing two MinK monomers, based on the effects of co-expression of MinK and MinK mutants (13Wang K.W. Goldstein S.A.N. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1303-1309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and a required non-MinK subunit that oocytes provide but only in a limited amount since isochronal currents saturate despite increasing levels of MinK protein on the oocyte surface (13Wang K.W. Goldstein S.A.N. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1303-1309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 16Wang K.W. Tai K.K. Goldstein S.A.N. Neuron. 1996; 16: 571-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A role for a non-MinK subunit has also been proposed by Blumenthal and Kaczmarek (22Blumenthal E.M. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3097-3105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) based on similar findings and by Lesage et al. (23Lesage F. Attali B. Lakey J. Honore E. Romey G. Faurobert E. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. Recept. Channels. 1993; 1: 143-152PubMed Google Scholar) based on their study of three cell lines that fail to show currents despite MinK surface expression. Others have speculated that MinK may associate with HERG K+ channel subunits based on inhibition of IKr currents in a cardiac cell line treated with MinK antisense oligonucleotides (24Yang T. Kupershmidt S. Roden D.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1246-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that K+ channels induced in oocytes by a cysteine-free mutant of MinK are sensitive to two sulfhydryl-specific reagents that covalently modify free cysteine residues exposed to aqueous solvent. Modification alters MinK ion conduction and ion selectivity, two fundamental properties of the channel pore. Channels are sensitive to modification only from the extracellular solution, and the rate of reaction depends on the channel conformational state. These results indicate that a cysteine-bearing protein endogenous to oocytes is intimately associated with the channel gating and conduction apparatus and suggest it may contribute directly to the MinK pore. Mutants of rat MinK were made in pSD (16Wang K.W. Tai K.K. Goldstein S.A.N. Neuron. 1996; 16: 571-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and cRNA (2 ng) injected into oocytes. Whole cell currents were measured after 2 days by a two-electrode voltage clamp with constant perfusion at 22°C (13Wang K.W. Goldstein S.A.N. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1303-1309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Data were filtered at 100 Hz, sampled at 1 kHz, and leak correction was performed off-line (3Hausdorff S.F. Goldstein S.A.N. Rushin E.E. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3341-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 4Goldstein S.A.N. Miller C.

Bath solution was ND-96 (in mM): 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.3 CaCl2, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.6) or solutions in which NaCl and KCl were replaced by 98 mM test cation as chloride salt. MTS solutions were made from powder (Toronto Research, Ontario) by substitution for NaCl in ND-96 and used within 15 min. MTS derivatives hydrolyze in aqueous solution (16Wang K.W. Tai K.K. Goldstein S.A.N. Neuron. 1996; 16: 571-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 25Stauffer D.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6840-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The half-life in ND-96 at 22°C for 5 mM MTSES− was ∼55 min; for 2.5 mM MTSEA+, it was ∼ 40 min; and for 10 mM MTSET+, it was ∼20 min; hydrolyzed 2.5 mM MTSEA+ was prepared by incubation at 22°C overnight. A panel of water-soluble, membrane-impermeant, thiol-specific methanethiosulfonate (MTS) derivatives developed by Akabas, Karlin and co-workers (25Stauffer D.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6840-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 26Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) has gained wide use for evaluation of sites in membrane proteins exposed to aqueous solution (27Goldstein S.A.N. Neuron. 1996; 16: 717-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These reagents are over 2,500 times more soluble in water than n-octanol and form mixed disulfides with free sulfhydryls accessible to aqueous solvent; in proteins, a covalent bond forms between a portion of the reagent (-SCH2CH2X) and exposed cysteine side chains. In previous work, we found that a negatively charged MTS derivative, MTSES−, did not block wild-type MinK channels in oocytes (Fig. 1) but did block MinK mutants bearing cysteine at positions 44, 45, or 47 (16Wang K.W. Tai K.K. Goldstein S.A.N. Neuron. 1996; 16: 571-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). On the other hand, wild-type MinK is blocked by two positively charged MTS derivatives, MTS-ethylammonium (MTSEA+) and MTS-ethyltrimethylammonium (MTSET+) (Fig. 1). The single native cysteine in MinK at position 107 is thought to be intracellular and protected from reagents in the external solution. As expected, mutation of this cysteine to alanine (C107A-MinK) does not relieve block by the two cationic MTS reagents (Fig. 1). This suggests that a non-MinK, cysteine-bearing protein is modified, rather than MinK, to alter channel function. MTS derivatives show marked specificity for free sulfhydryls (25Stauffer D.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6840-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 28Smith D.J. Maggio E.T. Kenyon G.L. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and alter ion conduction through both anion- and cation-selective channels with free cysteines in their pores (16Wang K.W. Tai K.K. Goldstein S.A.N. Neuron. 1996; 16: 571-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 26Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 1055-1063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, a simple model to explain block of MinK by MTSEA+ and MTSET+ is that a protein native to oocytes associates with MinK and exposes a free cysteine close to the MinK channel pore. We sought to support or refute this idea by studying in detail the effects of MTSEA+ on C107A-MinK. Block of C107A-MinK by MTSEA+ exhibits characteristics expected for covalent modification, it is not reversed upon washout and does not occur with hydrolyzed reagent. Exposure of oocytes expressing C107A-MinK to 2.5 mM MTSEA+ for 5 min or more decreases currents by 87 ± 5% (mean ± S.E., 17 oocytes). Higher concentrations of MTSEA+ (up to 25 mM), longer periods of exposure (up to 20 min), and washout periods up to 30 min do not alter the magnitude of irreversible blockade. This type of stable partial blockade is commonly observed after treatment of channels with MTSEA+ (16Wang K.W. Tai K.K. Goldstein S.A.N. Neuron. 1996; 16: 571-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 26Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 1055-1063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and has been shown to reflect a decrease in single-channel conductance in two cases (31Kurz L.L. Zuhlke R.D. Zhang H.J. Joho R.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 900-905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 32Pascual J.M. Shieh C.C. Kirsch G.E. Brown A.M. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1055-1063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Only weak reversible inhibition is observed when C107A-MinK expressing oocytes are treated with 2.5 mM hydrolyzed MTSEA+, 5 ± 2% (mean ± S.E., 6 oocytes). Inhibition by MTSEA+ is unexpectedly specific; irreversible blockade is not observed when C107A-MinK is treated to a panoply of thiol-specific reagents (for 8 min or more) including 30 mM iodoacetic acid, 30 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM 3-(N-maleimidopropionyl)-biocytin, 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mM 1-biotinamido-4-(4′-[maleimidomethyl]cyclohexane-carboxamido)butane, 0.4 mM N-[6-(biotinamido)hexyl]-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamide, 2 mM fluorescein mercuric acetate, or 50 mM thimerosal. That both MTSEA+ and MTSET+ (with a fixed positive charge) block irreversibly from the extracellular solution suggests the modification site is accessible to the bath solution and not buried in a hydrophobic portion of the channel or membrane. This is supported by the observation that intracellular microinjection of 23 nl of 50 mM MTSEA+, yielding an intracellular concentration of ∼2.5 mM MTSEA+, produces a current reduction of only 6 ± 5% (mean ± S.E., 4 oocytes measured at 10 and 30 min after injection). The kinetics of MinK blockade by MTS derivatives can be studied by abrupt exposure of oocytes expressing channels to the reagents (16Wang K.W. Tai K.K. Goldstein S.A.N. Neuron. 1996; 16: 571-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To test whether MTSEA+ modification is sensitive to channel conformation, we measured the rate of block of C107A-MinK currents with duty cycles of varying durations at the test voltage (0 mV) and holding voltage (−80 mV) (Fig. 2). When oocytes are exposed to 2.5 mM MTSEA+ during cycles with 3-s test pulses and 10-s holding intervals, blocking kinetics follow a roughly exponential relaxation with an apparent time constant (τ) of 112 ± 12 s (mean ± S.E., 8 oocytes). When the fraction of time spent at the holding voltage is decreased, by increasing the test pulse to 10 s and maintaining a 10-s holding interval, the rate of channel block is slower, τ = 185 ± 25 s (mean ± S.E., 5 oocytes). The rate of block slows further when the 10-s test pulse was maintained, but the interpulse holding voltage interval is reduced to 3 s, τ = 262 ± 32 s (mean ± S.E., 5 oocytes). While the magnitude of block achieved in all 3 protocols is unchanged, the rate of block slows as the fraction of time spent at the test potential increases. This demonstrates that MTSEA+ reacts more readily at voltages that favor the closed channel state and suggests a close association of MinK gating structures and the binding site for MTSEA+ since its exposure changes as channels move between closed and open states. A similar state-dependent enhancement of binding site exposure is observed when Shaker K+ channels carry a cysteine in their external pore region and move from open to an inactive conformation (33Yellen G. Sodickson D. Chen T.Y. Jurman M.E. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1068-1075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 34Liu Y. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. Neuron. 1996; 16: 859-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The effect of voltage on block kinetics was evaluated by employing a constant duty cycle (3-s test pulse, 10-s holding interval) and comparing test pulse voltages of 0 and +40 mV with a holding voltage of −80 mV. The rate of MTSEA+ block is slower at the more positive potential, τ = 160 ± 14 s (mean ± S.E., 4 oocytes), although the final magnitude of block is unchanged. This is consistent with the predicted effect of voltage on block by a positively charged agent that moves into the ion conduction pore and, thus, experiences the transmembrane electric field (4Goldstein S.A.N. Miller C. Neuron. 1991; 7: 403-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 35Woodhull A.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 61: 687-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). However, the effect of voltage may be a manifestation of state-dependent block and a slowly activating channel, since the more positive potential moves channels out of the MTSEA+ reactive state more rapidly. Thus, despite this voltage dependence, the MTSEA+ site may be superficial to the transmembrane electric field and the influence of voltage secondary to state-dependent exposure. While the kinetics of MTSEA+ blockade are sensitive to channel state, modification does not lead to inhibition of current as a result of slowed channel opening or speeded channel closure (Table I). Although the activation of MinK channels are complex (36Hice R.E. Folander K. Salata J.J. Smith J.S. Sanguinetti M.C. Swanson R. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 426: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 37Cui J. Kline R.P. Pennefather P. Cohen I.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), a qualitative approximation of activation kinetics can be achieved by comparing the amplitude of currents at 2 and 10 s while deactivation kinetics are well described by the sum of two exponentials (13Wang K.W. Goldstein S.A.N. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1303-1309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In fact, channels activate slightly more rapidly after MTSEA+ modification than before and close slightly more slowly. If this were the only effect of MTSEA+ on MinK, treatment would be expected to augment, rather than diminish, currents. This indicates that another mechanism underlies inhibition, perhaps direct pore occlusion, as seen with MTS reagents in other K+ channels (31Kurz L.L. Zuhlke R.D. Zhang H.J. Joho R.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 900-905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 32Pascual J.M. Shieh C.C. Kirsch G.E. Brown A.M.

Oocytes are held at −80 mV, pulsed to +20 mV to open the channels, and then repolarized to various test potentials; the initial slopes of tail currents are examined to determine reversal potential (Vrev). Unmodified C107A-MinK channels, like wild-type MinK (4Goldstein S.A.N. Miller C. Neuron. 1991; 7: 403-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), exhibit nearly ideal selectivity for K+ over Na+, showing a change of 55 ± 2 mV in Vrev with a 10-fold change in bath K+ concentration (Table I), close to the 58-mV shift predicted by the Nernst relationship. On the other hand, MTSEA+-modified channels shift their reversal potential only 38 ± 2 mV (Table I). This indicates that ion selectivity of modified channels has been altered. To investigate how selectivity is altered, the fine ionic discrimination among monovalent K+ ion analogs by unmodified and modified channels can be compared. Tail current reversal potentials are analyzed in terms of the Goldman-Hodgkin and Katz relation with each test ion as the only monovalent cation in the bath solution (Table II) (4Goldstein S.A.N. Miller C. Neuron. 1991; 7: 403-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These “pseudo-biionic” conditions allow a comparison of the relative permeability of the test ion and K+ (the predominant permeant ion inside the cell) before and after MTSEA+ exposure. MTSEA+ modification does not alter the relative permeability series for C107A-MinK channels (K+ > Rb+ > Cs+ > Na+≫ Li+, NMDG+) or their ability to exclude Li+ and NMDG+ (Table II). However, modification does increase the relative permeability of channels for both Cs+ and Na+ by at least 2-3-fold (Fig. 3 and Table II).Table IIEffect of MTSEA on reversal potential and permeability ratios of C107A-MinKK+Rb+Cs+Na+Li+NMDG+Vrev (mV)Before1 ± 111 ± 2−70 ± 2−144 ± 6<−150<−150After1 ± 111 ± 2−50 ± 2−112 ± 8<−150<−150Pk/PxBefore11.515.4280>400>400After11.67.3110>400>400 Open table in a new tab An increase in Na+ permeability through modified MinK channels should decrease the net outward current seen with depolarization since inward Na+ flux will now offset outward K+ current. This mechanism underlies the loss of K+ currents in granule cells of weaver mice and results from a mutation in the pore of their GIRK2 K+ channels (38Kofuji P. Hofer M. Millen K.J. Millonig J.H. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Hatten M.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 941-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 39Navarro B. Kennedy M.E. Velimirovic B. Bhat D. Peterson A.S. Clapham D.E. Science. 1996; 272: 1950-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, increased Na+ permeability is insufficient to explain the majority of the observed current reduction in MTSEA+-modified MinK channels; permeability for K+ remains 100-fold greater than for Na+, and tail currents do not show augmented Na+ conductance through modified channels (Fig. 3). Of note, increased Na+ permeability does not develop in a linear relationship with the appearance of MinK channel blockade; no change in Na+ permeability is seen until more than 70% of the current is inhibited when reversal potentials are measured in 98 mM Na+ solution (n = 16 oocytes). That initial modification events lead only to channel blockade while later events result in changes in ion selectivity argues that more than one reactive cysteine is modified in each channel (on one or more channel subunits). Permeability changes cannot be attributed to complete blockade of MinK channels and the exposure of less-selective ion channels endogenous to oocytes. Such endogenous currents are not seen in control cells. Moreover, residual unblocked currents exhibit characteristics of MinK channels including slow, voltage-dependent activation, rapid deactivation, sensitivity to barium, and voltage-dependent blockade by TEA (Table I). Partial blockade of MinK by MTSEA+ is like the effect of this agent on other K+ channels (31Kurz L.L. Zuhlke R.D. Zhang H.J. Joho R.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 900-905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 32Pascual J.M. Shieh C.C. Kirsch G.E. Brown A.M. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1055-1063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 34Liu Y. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. Neuron. 1996; 16: 859-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Previously, we found that TEA binds in the external pore of the MinK channel, and its presence in the bath solution slows the rate of reaction of negatively charged MTSES− with a A45C/C107A-MinK, a mutant with a cysteine in position 45; this suggests the sites for TEA and MTSES− overlap (16Wang K.W. Tai K.K. Goldstein S.A.N. Neuron. 1996; 16: 571-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Conversely, TEA and MTSEA+ do not appear to share overlapping binding sites since the rate of block of C107A-MinK by 2.5 mM MTSEA+ is not altered by the presence of 75 mM TEA, τ = 111 ± 16 s (mean ± S.E., 5 oocytes). Consistent with this conclusion, the equilibrium inhibition constant (Ki) for TEA blockade of C107A-MinK is the same before and after MTSEA+ modification (Table I). Sites for MTSEA+ and MTSES− are also non-overlapping. After complete reaction of A45C/C107A-MinK channels with MTSES−, the magnitude and rate of subsequent MTSEA+ modification is unchanged, τ = 104 ± 9 s (mean ± S.E., 6 oocytes). In the present study, we demonstrate that two sulfhydryl-specific reagents, MTSEA+ and MTSET+, alter the function of cysteine-free MinK channels in oocytes. The reagents react from the extracellular solution in a state-dependent fashion, modifying channels more rapidly when they are closed. Modification acts to change two attributes of MinK pore function. First, ion conduction is inhibited, apparently by a blocking mechanism since channel gating remains largely unchanged. Second, the channels' selectivity among monovalent cations is altered. That modification leads first to blockade and subsequently to changes in ion permeability suggests that more than one site is modified. Based on these results and other recent work (13Wang K.W. Goldstein S.A.N. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1303-1309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 16Wang K.W. Tai K.K. Goldstein S.A.N. Neuron. 1996; 16: 571-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we propose that MinK channels are formed through the intimate association of two MinK monomers and one or more copies of an oocyte membrane protein. Both MinK and the oocyte protein are exposed to the external solution, both change their local environment during channel gating, and both contribute to ion conduction pore function. Negatively charged MTSES−, while somewhat smaller than MTSET+, has no effect on C107A-MinK. This suggests that the MTSET+ site, if in the channel pore, is beyond the position that selects against permeation by negative ions. Like point mutation of residues in the pore-forming P domains of other K+ channels (38Kofuji P. Hofer M. Millen K.J. Millonig J.H. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Hatten M.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 941-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 39Navarro B. Kennedy M.E. Velimirovic B. Bhat D. Peterson A.S. Clapham D.E.

J. 1994; 66: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), MTSEA+ modification alters selectivity filter function. While it is tempting to speculate that modification occurs in proximity to the MinK channel selectivity filter (and, further, that the reactive site is near a P-like domain on the oocyte protein), it is important to emphasize that our results do not provide information about the mechanism by which ion selectivity is altered or show that modification has a local effect on ion permeation. While the findings are consistent with the idea that MTSEA+ binds in the channel pore, such a conclusion cannot be made from studies of ion permeation alone. The findings do allow us to answer the question motivating this study, one or more copies of a cysteine-bearing oocyte protein are intimately associated with each MinK channel. The wide diversity of K+ channel functions observed in vivo reflect the many genes encoding K+ channel subunits, production of splice variants, and the heteromultimeric association of channel subunits with distinctive properties (20Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer, Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). While some channels are functional as homomeric complexes, many are functional only when different subunit species co-assemble (41Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 42Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement IV, J.P. Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J.

Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), is able to function in oocytes only because it can assemble with a channel subunit endogenous to oocytes (XIR) to form functional channel complexes (43Hedin K.E. Lim N.F. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). MinK channels have been speculated to require co-assembly of MinK and another protein endogenous to oocytes, cardiocytes, or vestibular dark cells (13Wang K.W. Goldstein S.A.N. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1303-1309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 16Wang K.W. Tai K.K. Goldstein S.A.N.

Channels. 1993; 1: 143-152PubMed Google Scholar). We show here that functional MinK channels are, indeed, heteromultimeric. Consistent with our findings and conclusions, two reports now indicate that MinK protein can form functional heteromultimeric channels with KvLQT1, a single P domain K+ channel subunit present in human heart (Sanguinetti, M. C., Curran, M. E., Zou, A., Shen, J., Spector, P. S., Atkinson, D. L., and Keating, M. T. (1996) Nature 384, 80-83 and Barhanin, J., Lesage, F., Guillemare, E., Fink, M., Lazdunski, M., and Romey, G. (1996) Nature 384, 78-80). Sanguinetti et al. also reveal the partial predicted sequence of a Xenopus laevis homolog (XKvLQT1) which may prove to be the cysteine-bearing protein endogenous to oocytes whose association with MinK we study here."

For Northern blot RNA hybridization, cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing EDTA (1 mM) and collected by low speed centrifugation. Total RNA was extracted using the RNA STAT-60 reagent (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) following the directions of the commercial supplier. Aliquots (30 μg/lane) of RNA were subjected to separation on 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gels and then transferred to nylon membrane in the presence of 20 x SSC. Membranes were hybridized for 20 h at 42°C with the cDNA for aP2, FACS, LPL, or glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase, which were gifts from Dr. Nada Abumrad (Department of Physiology, SUNY, Stony Brook, NY) and labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP. The blots were hybridized in the presence of 50% formamide and then washed with 1 x SSC three times at 37°C prior to exposure of film for autoradiography. Cells were collected at specific time points, cooled on ice, and disrupted immediately by sonication at 4°C in homogenization buffer at 107 cells/ml. The homogenization buffer consisted of 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 100 nM okadaic acid, 20 mM benzamidine, 200 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. Each homogenate was assayed immediately for CaM kinase II activity using autocamtide-2 (16Hanson P.I. Kapiloff M.S. Lou L.L. Rosenfeld M.G. Schulman H.

Reactions were carried out in 25 μl of reaction buffer, containing 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 0.14 μM bisindolylmaleimide, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 100 nM okadaic acid, 25 μM ATP, 0.05 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and a homogenate from 5 x 104 cells at 30°C for 2 min. Twenty μl of reaction mixture was applied onto a piece of phosphocellulose paper (P-81) and the paper washed with 10 mM phosphoric acid for 15 min and air-dried. The incorporation of 32P into autocamtide-2 was determined by liquid scintillation. Phosphorylation of autocamtide-2 in the absence of Ca2+ relative to its phosphorylation in the presence of Ca2+ is defined as the “autonomous” activity (17MacNicol M. Jefferson A.B. Schulman H. J.

Briefly, coverslip-attached cells were loaded with 2 μM fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester for 45 min at 37°C in the dark. After washing in fresh Krebs-Henseleit buffer for 15 min at 20°C, coverslips were inserted into a Sykes-Moore chamber (Bello, Vineland, NJ). Groups of 5-10 fura-2-loaded cells were viewed through a Nikon 40x UV-fluor objective of a Nikon inverted microscope coupled to a Deltascan microspectrofluorometer system (PTI, Princeton, NJ). Excitation at 345 and 380 nm were generated using a 75-watt xenon lamp and a chopper. Emitted light was channeled into the photomultiplier via an ultraviolet dichroic mirror and interference filter of 510 nm (Corion, Holiston, MA). Measurements of fluorescence intensity were performed at a rate of 20 points/s, and the ratio of absorbance 345/380 nm was computed using the PTI software.

Similarly, treating cultures of 3T3-L1 cells with phorbol 13-myristate 12-acetate (10 μM, from -2 to +24 h of induction in response to dexamethasone+IBMX) in order to down-regulate protein kinase C did not alter adipogenesis (data not shown). Short-term activation of protein kinase C with phorbol 13-myristate 12-acetate (250 nM) for 10 min prior to the induction with dexamethasone+IBMX also was without effect on either the rate or the extent of adipogenic conversion (data not shown). Treatment of cells with KT5720, a selective inhibitor of protein kinase A (19Godbois D.M. Crissman H.A. Tobey R.A. Bradbury E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8626-8630Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), did not block adipogenesis, more than 75% of the cells progressing to adipocytes within 8 days (Fig. 1). By 10 days nearly 100% of the KT5720-treated cells had undergone adipogenesis (not shown). These data are consistent with earlier data demonstrating the adipogenic conversion was unaffected by agents like forskolin or pertussis toxin treatment that elevate intracellular cAMP levels (5Wang H.-y. Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, suppressing intracellular cAMP levels with 2¹,5¹-dideoxyadenosine (10 μM) was also without effect on the ability of the cultures to differentiate to adipocytes in response to dexamethasone+ IBMX (not shown). Thus inhibition of either protein kinase C or protein kinase A activities fails to influence adipogenic conversion in 3T3-L1 cells. In contrast to the lack of effect of inhibitors for either protein kinase A or C on adipogenic conversion in response to dexamethasone+IBMX, treating the cells with KN-62, an inhibitor of CaM kinase II, effectively blocks adipogenesis (Fig. 1, A and B). KN-62 is highly selective for CaM kinase II, displaying a Ki for CaM kinase II more than 2 orders of magnitude lower than those for protein kinase C, protein kinase A, and myosin light chain kinase (21Tokumitsu H. Chijiwa T. Hagiwara M. Mizutani A. Terasawa M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4315-4320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). KN-93, a second inhibitor of CaM kinase II with higher water solubility and equal selectivity for CaM kinase II as compared to protein kinase C, protein kinase A, and myosin light chain kinase (22Sumi M. Kiuchi K. Isikawa T. Ishil A. Hagiwara M. Nagatsu T. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), was evaluated also for its ability to effect adipogenesis. At 10 μM concentrations, both KN-62 and KN-93 effectively abolish the adipogenic response of 3T3-L1 cells to induction by dexamethasone+ IBMX. The dose-response relationship between adipogenic conversion of 3T3-L1 cultures and the inhibitors of CaM kinase II was explored (Fig. 2). KN-62 and KN-93 both display the ability to block fully the adipogenic response, the more water-soluble KN-93 compound being less potent in the suppression of adipogenesis. The ability of CaM kinase II inhibitors to block the induction of adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells suggested some critical role of CaM kinase II activity in the differentiation process. Activation of CaM kinase II activity was investigated in the first 2 h of induction by dexamethasone+IBMX (Fig. 3A). The autonomous activity increased by 120 min, more than doubling. Analysis of the first minute of induction of adipogenesis by dexamethasone+IBMX revealed a sharp, transient peak of autonomous CaM kinase II activity (not shown). By 10 s of induction, CaM kinase II activity increased 5-fold (3.5% as compared to 0.75% at t = 0), the activity declining to control levels with 30-60 s (not shown). Measured from 2 h to 2 days post-induction with dexamethasone+IBMX, autonomous CaM kinase II activity increased 4-8 fold (Fig. 3B). Autonomous kinase activity increased from 0.75 to 4.0% at 2 to 18 h (first phase) and then displayed a sharp decline at 24 h. Following the decline, autonomous CaM kinase II activity rebounded to 2.5% (second phase), where it remained up until 48 h post-induction. Thus, after a brief transient activation, CaM kinase II activity increases from 1 to 18 h of adipogenesis. This first phase declines by 24 h, followed by a second phase of autonomous CaM kinase II activity which remains 4-5-fold greater than that in control cells treated only with vehicle. Treating confluent cultures of 3T3-L1 cells for either 2 or 12 h with ionophore A23187 (1 μM) or ionomycin (3 μM) in either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with Ca2+ to 25 mM fails to induce adipogenic conversion of the embryonic fibroblasts (data not shown). Elevating the concentration of either ionophore by 10-fold results in cell death (data not shown). Even in the presence of inducers, CaM kinase II inhibitors do not alter the rate of adipogenesis (data not shown). These data suggest that activation of CaM kinase activity itself is not sufficient a stimulus to induce the adipogenic progression. The transient activation of CaM kinase in 3T3-L1 clones induced by addition of dexamethasone+IBMX was examined from a second perspective, measurements of intracellular free Ca2+. In cells pre-loaded with the calcium-sensitive probe fura-2, measurements of intracellular free Ca2+ were possible (Fig. 4A). As a control, the ability of the ionophore ionomycin to stimulate an increase in intracellular free Ca2+ was demonstrated. Ionomycin produced a rapid and robust increase in intracellular free Ca2+. Similar measurements performed in cells stimulated with dexamethasone+IBMX during the first 10 min of induction reveal no significant changes in intracellular free Ca2+ (Fig. 4B). Measurements at later time points likewise failed to identify a significant change in the concentration of intracellular free Ca2+ (data not shown). Thus the temporal nature of a Ca2+ transient, if stimulated by inducers of adipogenesis, may have precluded detection by this approach. The ability of inhibitors of CaM kinase II to block adipogenesis and the time course of autonomous CaM kinase II activation during dexamethasone+IBMX-induced adipogenesis prompted us to investigate the time constraints on the exposure to the inhibitor with respect to its ability to block differentiation. As shown by oil-red O staining (Fig. 5A) and quantification of the extent of adipogenic conversion (Fig. 5B), blockade of adipogenesis by CaM kinase II inhibitor was not effective, if restricted to the first 6 h of the induction protocol. Whereas treatment with a CaM kinase II inhibitor from 0 to 12 h blocks adipogenesis, treatments from 0 to 6 h, 6 to 24 h, or 12 to 24 h fail to block adipogenesis. These data suggest that one period of CaM kinase II activation from 6 to 12 h of induction (Fig. 3A) is critical for adipogenic conversion to occur, a hypothesis supported by the ability of a 6-12-h treatment of KN-93 to be fully effective in blocking adipogenesis. Interestingly, inhibition of CaM kinase II activity at 6-12 h was not the only window of opportunity for blockade of adipogenesis. Treating cells with KN-93 (or KN-62, not shown) from 0, 6, 12, or 24 h to the end of the 48-h induction period is equally effective in blocking adipogenesis as was the brief 6-h exposure to inhibitor from 6 to 12 h. The identification of two distinct phases for blockade of adipogenesis by CaM kinase II inhibitors may well reflect the two distinct phases of CaM kinase activation observed as the cell progress through adipogenesis (Fig. 3). We explored the influence of CaM kinase II inhibition on expression of marker genes for adipogenic conversion (Fig. 6). Cells were induced to adipogenesis with dexamethasone+ IBMX and KN-93 was added at either the 6-12-h or 24-48-h periods. aP2, fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (FACS), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) are well known markers of adipogenesis, LPL being an early gene product, aP2 and FACS being intermediate early gene products (see 24Cornelius P. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 99-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The mRNA levels of glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase, which do not change during differentiation (24Cornelius P. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 99-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), were probed also. Inhibition of CaM kinase II activity from 24 to 48 h essentially blocked the expression of aP2, FACS, and LPL mRNAs. Treating the cells with inhibitor for a period of 6-12 h following induction of adipogenesis severely attentuated the activation of the marker genes. These data demonstrate an obligate role of CaM kinase II activation in the early program of adipogenic conversion, confirming the phenotypic displays of these cells stained for lipid accumulation with oil-red O at day 8 following treatment with CaM kinase inhibitors (Fig. 5A). Activation of CaM kinase II is critical to several aspects of cell physiology and biology, particularly regulation of the cell cycle (25Means A.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 26Planas-Silva M.D. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), control of nuclear envelope breakdown (27Baitinger C. Alderton J. Poenie M. Schulman H. Steinhardt R.A. J.

Neurosci. 1993; 13: 559-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the current work we report the activation of CaM kinase II during adipogenesis. Activation of CaM kinase has been shown to lead to phosphorylation of C/EBPβ, a member of the bZip family of transcription factors (29Wegner M. Cao Z. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1992; 256: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), providing one possible paradigm linking CaM kinase activation to gene expression. In addition, CaM kinase II has been shown to phosphorylate a non-consensus site on ATF-1 and CREB, which inhibits activation of these two transcription factors (30Sun P. Lou L. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3066-3073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), providing another possible role of CaM kinase II activation and gene expression. More importantly, blockade of the CaM kinase II activity, but not that of either protein kinase A or protein kinase C, prevents the progression of 3T3-L1 embryonic fibroblasts to adipocytes. The activation of CaM kinase II is dynamic and has precise temporal boundaries for interruption by selective inhibitors like KN-62 or KN-93. Identification of substrates for CaM kinase II critical to adipogenic progression remains an important goal. In summary, activation of CaM kinase II is shown to be an obligate step toward induction and progression of adipogenesis."

HPT binds to a single site and is displaced by inositol hexaphosphate at a 1:1 mol ratio, indicating that binding occurs at the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate site in the central cavity.

The β-subunit end of the central cavity contains a cluster of eight positive charges that interact with the negative charges of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) (3Benesch R. Benesch R.E. Nature. 1969; 221: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). This site also binds a variety of other negatively charged effectors such as inositol hexaphosphate (IHP), inorganic phosphate, chloride, and polyglutamic acid. The other end (α-subunit) of the central cavity contains additional binding sites, particularly for chloride ions. Another class of potent effectors derived from clofibric acid and bezafibrate (e.g. L35) bind near the middle of the central cavity with their negative charges projecting toward the α-subunit end (4Lalezari I.

Study of these effectors is of practical interest since control of oxygen affinity is a necessary component for the design of acellular Hb-based oxygen carriers (7Vandegriff K.D. Biotechnol. & Genet. Eng. Rev. 1992; 10: 403-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 8Winslow R.M. Vandegriff K.D. Intagletta M. Blood Substitutes: Physiological Basis of Efficacy.

X-ray crystallographic studies are important both in pinpointing effector-binding sites and in characterizing the geometry of the effector-bound site (2Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Abraham D.J. Poyart C. Bursaux E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 1064-1078Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, other methods must be used to determine the structural and functional interactions that are important in solution and to perform titration studies for obtaining binding constants as a function of solution conditions and/or structural state. Functionally relevant synergistic and antagonistic effects among effectors are also best elucidated through solution studies. Functional characterization of hemoglobin suggests that synergistic and competitive activity can occur when combinations of effectors are bound (4Lalezari I. Lalezari P. Poyart C. Marden M. Kister J. Bohn B. Fermi G. Perutz M.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Of the various allosteric effectors, the interactions of DPG (the natural allosteric effector found in the red blood cell) and its analogs in HbA have been investigated the most extensively. However, the binding of DPG can only be measured indirectly through its effects on ligand reactivity and on spectroscopically accessible chromophores such as the heme groups. In this report, we present an extension of the use of a fluorescent analog of DPG to probe directly the hemoglobin DPG-binding site in a quantitative fashion. Gibson and MacQuarrie (9MacQuarrie R. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5832-5856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10MacQuarrie R. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5686-5694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that 8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrenetrisulfonate (HPT) can be used as a fluorescent analog of DPG. Utilizing the observation that the fluorescence signal from HPT is highly quenched when bound to HbA, they performed steady-state fluorescence intensity measurements and established that HPT has a lower affinity for the DPG-binding site than DPG or IHP. A subsequent study by that group (11Marden M.C. Hazard E.S. Gibson Q.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7591-7596Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), using HPT as a probe of the DPG-binding site, focused on the detection of ligand-binding intermediates occurring along the R to T transition pathway. In those initial experiments, the results were limited in large part by two aspects of the methodology. (i) To monitor changes in HPT fluorescence in the presence of the highly absorbing heme, low concentrations of Hb had to be used. As a result, dissociation of the tetramer produced αβ-dimers in a concentration high enough to complicate data analysis. (ii) The use of steady-state fluorescence quenching as a means of obtaining titration data does not allow for probing of the HPT-bound species or for a direct determination of the fractions of both bound and unbound effector in a single measurement. In the present study, these limitations were overcome using a combination of front-face optical geometry and fluorescence lifetime measurements. The use of front-face excitation allows for the observation of HPT fluorescence upon binding to hemoglobin at high concentrations without inner-filter effects or substantial dimer formation. Front-face fluorescence techniques have been used previously to probe the highly quenched fluorescence from tryptophans within both hemoglobins and myoglobins (12Hirsch R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 232: 231-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fluorescence lifetime measurements of HPT in the presence of HbA reveal two distinct and easily resolved lifetime components that allow unambiguous determination of the fractions of bound and free HPT under various solution conditions (see below). In contrast, conventional methods of saturation equilibrium binding analysis require a full titration data set complete with a plateau in the binding curve to quantify bound and free ligand (13Ward L.D. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In addition, quantitative analysis of steady-state measurements comparing binding data under different solution conditions (pH and/or ionic strength) would be hampered due to the variation in the extinction coefficient of HPT at the excitation wavelength and would therefore require a correction factor to account for this dependence. Furthermore, as will be shown below, although the fluorescence intensity of the bound chromophore is significantly diminished compared with that of the free chromophore, the quantum yield is not negligible. This residual intensity complicates steady-state titration measurements that do not normalize to the intensity of fully bound ligand. Aside from obviating the need for these corrections, lifetime measurements of the bound species can also be used to characterize (structurally and dynamically) the binding site as a function of solution conditions or protein modifications. In particular, the fluorescence spectrum of the bound ligand can be obtained, independent of a large background of free ligand, using time-gated spectroscopy. Last, fluorescence lifetime measurements can assist in the determination of multiple binding sites and in the identification of nonspecific binding. Lifetime fluorescence methods are applied here to the study of effector binding at low pH to the carboxy forms of both native HbA and three intramolecularly cross-bridged derivatives of HbA. Liganded hemoglobin was chosen for several reasons. First, the affinity for DPG-binding site effectors of deoxy derivatives of cooperative HbA is very high. Consequently, as long as the HbA remains in the T state, there is not likely to be substantial variation in the binding properties of the effectors as a function of protein modification. The greatly reduced affinity of liganded Hb for these effectors increases the dynamic range associated with the parameters describing the interaction between the effector and the protein. A second reason for studying the liganded derivatives is that there has been considerable ambiguity as to the nature of the interaction of effectors with the liganded protein. Most of the work on the role of effectors in regulating ligand binding is predicated on the assumption that the effect arises from preferential binding of the effector to the T state structure. There is, however, considerable evidence that DPG and IHP do indeed bind to the liganded ferrous forms of HbA (14Adams M.L. Schuster T.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 58: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Kwiatkowski L. Noble R.W. Ho C. Hemoglobin and Oxygen Binding.

What is not clear and is still being explored is whether the effectors bind exclusively to the small fraction of liganded T state species, thereby shifting the equilibrium from R toward T as binding progresses, or whether the effectors bind with reduced affinity to the R state liganded species, resulting in an altered R state. The present study directly addresses the issue of whether HPT and IHP bind stoichiometrically to liganded HbA. These data are then used in conjunction with earlier spectroscopic studies to assess the nature of effector-bound liganded HbA. In addition, the HPT-based technique is used to evaluate how three different site-specific cross-linkers influence the DPG-binding site in liganded HbA. Human adult hemoglobin was purified as described previously (18Christensen S.M. Medina F. Winslow R.W. Snell S.M. Zegna A. Marini M.A. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1988; 17: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A hemolysate was prepared from whole blood obtained from an AC or AA individual using the freeze-thaw technique to remove membranous material. The hemolysate was dialyzed against 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), and the hemoglobins were separated on a CM-52 column using a double gradient (10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) to 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.3)). Purified HbA was collected and verified using cellulose-acetate gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. The hemoglobin was concentrated and dialyzed against 50 mM bis-tris with 100 mM sodium chloride (pH 7.35) and stripped on a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with the same buffer. This purified material was then placed on a second Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.35) and concentrated and equilibrated with the buffer of choice using a Centricon-10 concentrator (Amicon, Inc.). The hemoglobin was stored frozen in liquid nitrogen until used. HbACO was prepared by gently flowing chemically pure CO over the surface of the HbA solution. Deoxy-HbA was obtained by gently passing pure nitrogen or helium into an anaerobic vessel containing the HbA solution, which was then aerobically transferred to the cuvette. Complete conversion to the CO or deoxy forms was verified by the absorption spectrum. Three forms of intramolecularly cross-bridged HbA were used in this study. An αα-cross-linked HbA was prepared by reacting deoxy-HbA with bis(3,5-dibromosalicyl)fumarate as described by Walder et al. (19Walder R.Y. Andracki M.E. Walder J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 231: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The cross-link introduced is between the ϵ-amino groups of Lys-α99 and is within the central cavity. Two other derivatives, with cross-links between residues of the β-chains, were also prepared. Bis(3,5-dibromosalicyl)sebacate reacts with deoxy-HbA at slightly alkaline pH to introduce intramolecular cross-linking between the ϵ-amino groups of Lys-β82 as described by Bucci et al. (20Bucci E. Kwansa H. Razynska A. O'Hearne M. Artif. Cells Blood Substit. Immobil. Biotechnol. 1996; 24: 310Google Scholar). This selective ββ cross-linking reaction has been optimized for the preparation of pure cross-linked material. 2B. N. Manjula, K. Sundarapandiyan, H. Klepser, K. Danjal, H. W. Huang, E. Bucci, J. S. Logan, and R. Kuma, manuscript in preparation. Deoxy-HbA (1-2 mM) in 50 mM borate buffer (pH 9.1) was reacted with bis(3,5-dibromosalicyl)sebacate at 37°C for 3 h. At the end of the reaction, glycylglycine was added in 10-fold molar excess over the cross-linker to scavenge the excess reagent. The reacted Hb was dialyzed against 10 mM Tris and 20 mM glycine (pH 8.3). The cross-linked Hb was purified by ion-exchange chromatography using a Bio-Rad MacroPrep High Q anion exchanger. The column was equilibrated with the dialysis buffer, and the proteins were eluted by stepping sodium chloride (30, 75, and 200 mM) in the same buffer. The ascending side of the 75 mM NaCl elution peak was used in this study, and >95% of the material was cross-linked. Intramolecular cross-linking of HbA between the Cys-β93 residues was carried out using bis(maleimide)/polyethylene glycol 2000 (bis-Mal/PEG2000). HbAO2 (0.5 mM) in phosphate-buffered saline was reacted with 2-fold molar excess of the cross-linking reagent at room temperature for 1 h. Under these conditions, nearly quantitative (>99%) intramolecular cross-linking occurred. The cross-linked material was separated from the excess reagent by gel filtration and then further purified by CM-cellulose chromatography. The cross-bridge results in a slight increase in the oxygen affinity of the protein. 3B. N. Manjula, P. K. Smith, and A. S. Acharya, manuscript in preparation. The cross-linking reagents bis(3,5-dibromosalicyl)sebacate and bis-Mal/PEG2000 were prepared by Paul Smith of Bioaffinity Systems (Rockford, IL). HPT was obtained from Eastman Kodak Co. and used without further purification. Stock solutions for titrations were prepared in 50 mM Hepes (pH 6.35). It should be noted that there is a significant change in the absorption spectrum of HPT upon changing the pH from 6 to 8 (9MacQuarrie R. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5832-5856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, excitation in most cases was at 310 nm, where the effect is small, and no pH dependence of the lowest energy (505 nm) emission spectrum or fluorescence lifetime was observed (see below). The sodium salt of IHP was purchased from Sigma. A 200 mM aqueous IHP solution was passed and recycled for 1 h through a dry Amberlite column as described previously (21Amiconi G. Giardina B. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 532-552Google Scholar). This solution was frozen and stored in aliquots until needed. 20 mM stock solutions used for titration were prepared with the desired buffer. L35 was obtained as a generous gift from Drs. I. Lalezari and P. Lalezari, and a stock solution was made by dissolving L35 in the desired buffer to a final concentration of 20 mM. Front-face fluorescence spectra were measured using an SLM 8000 photon-counting spectrophotometer equipped with a front-face accessory. HbA solutions of 0.6-1 g/100 ml (0.10-0.16 mM in tetramer) were prepared for titration with the corresponding effector. The met (Fe3+) content was <5%. For a review of front-face hemoglobin fluorescence measurements, see Hirsch (12Hirsch R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 232: 231-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The time-correlated single photon-counting system was described previously (22Gottfried D.S. Peterson E.S. Sheikh A.G. Wang J. Yang M. Friedman J.M. J. Phys.

SPIE. 1990; 1204: 2-12Crossref Google Scholar). The light source was a mode-locked, frequency-doubled neodymium/YAG laser that synchronously pumped a dye laser with rhodamine 6G as the active medium. The cavity-dumped dye laser output was frequency-doubled from the visible to the near-ultraviolet by focusing the pulse train onto a KDP type I crystal to generate light in the wavelength range 280-315 nm (5-10 ps fwhm (full width at half-maximum)). For front-face fluorometry, the optically thick sample was placed in a triangular quartz cuvette, which was rotated so that the excitation direction was 34° with respect to the surface normal (24Eisinger J. Flores J. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The solution was slowly stirred using a miniature magnetic bar to reduce artifacts from photodamage. The fluorescence, collected at right angles to the illuminating light, was collimated, passed through a sheet polarizer (at the magic angle) and a cutoff filter, and then focused onto the entrance slit of a 1/8-meter subtractive double monochromator. The monochromator output was directed onto the surface of a microchannel plate photomultiplier tube, and the signal was measured using standard NIM electronics (22Gottfried D.S. Peterson E.S. Sheikh A.G. Wang J. Yang M. Friedman J.M. J. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 12034-12042Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The instrument response function was typically 35 ps fwhm. Deconvolution of the emission decay curves and fitting to a sum of exponentials (Equation 1), I(t)=∑iαiexp(−t/τi)(Eq. 1) where αi and τi are the normalized pre-exponential and decay time components, respectively, were achieved using the Marquardt nonlinear least-squares method. Determination of the quality of fit was judged from the value of the reduced χ2, the runs test, the residuals, and the autocorrelation of the residuals (25Grinvald A. Steinberg I.Z. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 583-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Estimation of error in the fitting parameters was done using the support plane method (χ2 surface) (26Johnson M.L. Frasier S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 301-342Crossref Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Time-gated fluorescence spectra were obtained by step scanning the monochromator while counting only those emission events at each wavelength that fall into a predefined temporal region of interest in the fluorescence decay. In this manner, spectra with time resolution of ∼100 ps can be measured. The absorption spectra of HPT at pH 8.0 and 6.35 (Fig. 1) reveal the presence of multiple transitions with both electronic and vibrational character. At pH 8.0, it is assumed that the band at 455 nm represents the lowest energy electronic transition, S0 → S1, of the deprotonated species (42Wolfbeis O.S. Fürlinger E. Kroneis H. Marsoner H. Fresenius Z. Anal. Chem. 1983; 314: 119-124Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The shoulders at higher energy near 400 and 375 nm are attributable to transitions of excited vibrational states within this electronic band or to ground-state absorption of the protonated HPT. Under acidic conditions, the positions of these features remain unchanged, but their relative intensities are altered. In both acidic and basic solutions, there is a near-UV transition around 297 nm, which is assigned to a higher energy electronic transition, S0 → S2. All fluorescence measurements in this report were made with excitation in the near-UV region (280-310 nm), which excites primarily the S2 state. Because we measured spectroscopic parameters of HPT under different solution conditions (e.g. pH), we wished to ensure that there were no anomalous properties of the probe chromophore that would lead to misinterpretation of the data. Consistent with the observations of Gibson and MacQuarrie (9MacQuarrie R. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5832-5856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10MacQuarrie R. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5686-5694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there is considerable change in the absorption spectrum of HPT as a function of pH. 4This pH dependence has interesting implications for the use of HPT as a probe of electrostatics within the Hb central cavity. In future experiments, we intend to measure the excitation and emission spectra of bound HPT to determine the apparent pH at the DPG-binding site (42Wolfbeis O.S. Fürlinger E. Kroneis H. Marsoner H. Fresenius Z. Anal. Chem. 1983; 314: 119-124Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Consequently, this could hamper quantitative analysis of equilibrium ligand binding from steady-state spectroscopy when comparing solutions at different pH values, due to the variation in the extinction coefficient at the excitation wavelength. In contrast, lifetime measurements may be used to quantitate the binding of HPT to Hb without the need for correction factors. The shape and peak wavelength of the HPT emission spectrum are independent of protonation state in this pH region (Fig. 1). Note, however, the presence of a shoulder near 440 nm in the spectrum at pH 6.35. As will be argued below, this emission originates from the pH-dependent higher energy transition. Time-gated fluorescence spectra of bound (τ < 200 ps) and free (τ > 2 ns) HPT (see below) do not differ significantly. This observation is crucial to ensuring that the fractional populations of these species can be extracted from the pre-exponential amplitudes in a multiexponential decay fit without correcting for spectral changes. This requirement for invariance as a function of binding is applicable as well to the extinction coefficient, which is also unchanged due to binding of the HPT chromophore to the protein. Experimental constraints of the present study necessitated the use of near-UV excitation, which populates a higher energy state of HPT, as opposed to direct excitation in the lowest energy band around 450 nm. S2 excitation is typically followed by relaxation to the S1 state, which fluoresces with high quantum yield. Fig. 2 presents the fluorescence decay curves of free HPT in solution at pH 6.35 for excitation at 310 nm and emission at 510 nm. The fitting parameters for both one- and two-exponential decay models at high and low pH are given in Table I. It can be seen that the excited state lifetime (τ2 = 5.6 ns) is the same at the two pH values and is in agreement with that previously reported (43Politi M.J. Fendler J.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 265-273Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition to the fluorescence decay, there is a rise time (τ1), denoted by the negative pre-exponential parameter, with a time constant of ∼100 ps. Although it is difficult to quantify the amplitude of this component using a simple sum of exponentials decay model, it is clear that the rise time has a larger amplitude, relative to the decay, at pH 6.35. Measurements of decay curves at emission wavelengths around 450 nm (see Fig. 1) also result in lifetimes around 100 ps (data not shown). In addition, a time-gated spectrum of the early time fluorescence (τ < 200 ps) shows bands at 445 and 505 nm, which are assigned to emission from the absorption transitions at 400 and 450 nm, respectively. A time-gated spectrum of the long-lived fluorescence shows only the reddest (505 nm) emission. This assignment explains the apparent difference in rise time amplitude and the intensity of the 440 nm emission band, depending on pH, since the pH alters both the ratio of S2 to S1 absorption at the excitation wavelength of 310 nm and the proportions of protonated and unprotonated HPT fluorescence (see Fig. 1). All of this evidence indicates that this rise time is consistent with the rate of relaxation from a higher excited state (electronic or vibrational) to a vibrationally thermalized S1. Alternatively, this decay component may represent the time for photo-initiated proton transfer. The practical implications of this rise time on the quantitative determination of HPT binding to HbA are discussed below.Table IFluorescence decay parameters of HPTSolution[HbA]/[HPT]α1τ1α2τ2α3τ3χ2pH 8.001.05.64 ns1.5−0.17667.3 ps0.8245.62 ns1.2(32-125)(5.60-5.65)pH 6.3501.05.66 ns7.6−0.347112 ps0.6535.57 ns1.1(95-132)(5.55-5.60)pH 8.00.830.0451.73 ns0.9555.36 ns1.1(∼0.8-4.1)(5.31-5.65)pH 6.350.880.57828.1 ps0.0401.72 ns0.3825.30 ns1.1(0.556-0.599)(24.0-32.6)(0.032-0.056)(1.21-2.44)(0.365-0.388)(5.25-5.39)0.450.87926.3 ps0.034307 ps0.0875.12 ns1.2(0.875-0.882)(21.5-29.8)(0.019-0.063)(170-600)(0.0868-0.0872)(5.07-5.19) Open table in a new tab An additional potential complication due to the excitation at 310 nm results from the effect of energy transfer from the intrinsic Trp residues of Hb to HPT. Because this excitation transfer occurs only to bound HPT chromophores that lie within the Förster transfer radius, it essentially increases the apparent extinction coefficient of bound HPT by a factor proportional to the product of the donor (Trp) extinction coefficient at the excitation wavelength and the energy transfer efficiency from Trp to HPT under the conditions of the measurement. This increased apparent extinction coefficient would overly weight the fraction of bound chromophores in the decay analysis. In the present case, however, there is reason to assume that this effect is negligible. First, the extinction of Trp at 310 nm is small, ϵ≈ 20 M−1 cm−1 (27Wetlaufer D.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1962; 17: 303-390Crossref Scopus (793) Google Scholar), compared with that of HPT, ϵ≈ 4500 M−1 cm−1 (28Kodak Optical Products Catalog, Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY.Google Scholar). Second, in a separate experiment that monitored the Trp lifetime in the absence and presence of saturating HPT, the energy transfer efficiency was estimated to be no more than 10%. Consequently, systematic error due to energy transfer is considered to be small. In steady-state fluorescence measurements, the addition of HPT to deoxyhemoglobin (50 mM Hepes (pH 7.35)) results in a decrease in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence intensity and the loss of HPT emission (Fig. 3A). 5Unpublished results (D. S. Gottfried and J. M. Friedman) indicate that one component of the loss of Trp fluorescence intensity with HPT binding is due to a decrease in the population of the long-lived nanosecond lifetime component of the Trp emission, accompanied by a comparable increase in the population of the highly quenched picosecond species. Recent results from this laboratory suggest that this may be due to a damping of hemoglobin conformational dynamics that increase the Trp-heme distance when the HPT ligand is bound, rather than an increase in the rate of energy transfer from the tryptophans to HPT (22Gottfried D.S. Peterson E.S. Sheikh A.G. Wang J. Yang M. Friedman J.M. J. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 12034-12042Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The addition of HPT to HbAO2 (above pH 7) results in little or no Trp fluorescence change and the retention of a measurable HPT signal (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the Trp fluorescence decrease observed with deoxyhemoglobin upon addition of HPT is reversible upon oxygenation of the solution. These results are as expected since studies by Gibson and MacQuarrie (9MacQuarrie R. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5832-5856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10MacQuarrie R. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5686-5694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that HPT binds with much higher affinity to deoxyhemoglobin than to oxyhemoglobin. HPT has also been shown by those workers to bind to the T"
https://openalex.org/W1974121590,"We have taken advantage of cysteine mutants described previously (Petrov, V. V., and Slayman, C. W. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 28535-28540) to map the sites at which N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) reacts with the plasma-membrane H+ATPase (PMA)1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When membrane vesicles containing the ATPase were incubated with NEM, six of nine mutants with single cysteine substitutions showed sensitivity similar to the wild-type enzyme. By contrast, C221A and C532A were inactivated more slowly than the wild-type control, and the C221, 532A double mutant was completely resistant, indicating that Cys-221 and Cys-532 are NEM-reactive residues. In the presence of 10 mM MgADP, the wild-type ATPase was partially protected against NEM; parallel experiments with the C221A and C532A mutants showed that the protection occurred at Cys-532, located in or near the nucleotide-binding site. Unexpectedly, the inactivation of the C409A ATPase was ∼4-fold more rapid than in the case of the wild-type enzyme. Experiments with double mutants made it clear that this resulted from an acidic shift in pKa and a consequent acceleration of the reaction rate at Cys-532. One simple interpretation is that substitution of Cys-409 leads to a local conformational change within the central hydrophilic domain. Consistent with this idea, the reaction of fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate at Lys-474 was also stimulated ∼3.5-fold by the C409A mutation. Taken together, the results of this study provide new information about the reactivity of individual Cys residues within the ATPase and pave the way to tag specific sites for structural and functional studies of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1997249798,"A wide variety of important biological processes, including both the formation and dissolution of blood clots, depend on specific cleavage of individual target proteins by serine proteases. For example, tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA), a trypsin-like enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the endogenous fibrinolytic cascade, has only one known substrate in vivo, a single peptide bond (Arg561-Val562) in the proenzyme plasminogen. We have previously suggested that the specificity of t-PA for plasminogen is mediated in part by direct protein-protein interactions between the protease domain of t-PA and plasminogen that are distinct from those occurring within t-PA's active site. We demonstrate in this study that residues 420-423 of t-PA, which form a fully solvent-exposed, hydrophobic region of a surface loop mapping near one edge of the active site of t-PA, form, or are essential for the integrity of, an important, secondary site of interaction between t-PA and plasminogen that significantly modulates the rate of plasminogen activation in the absence, but not the presence, of fibrin. Identification of this secondary site of interaction between t-PA and plasminogen provides new insight into molecular details of the evolution of stringent substrate specificity by t-PA and suggests a novel strategy to enhance the fibrin dependence of plasminogen activation by t-PA.

Tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA) 1The abbreviations used are: t-PAtissue type plasminogen activatorPAI-1plasminogen activator inhibitor, type 1. has been widely and successfully used as a therapeutic agent to treat acute myocardial infarction (1Collen D. Lijnen H.R. Blood. 1991; 78: 3114-3124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). t-PA does not, however, dissolve blood clots directly; instead, the enzyme catalyzes conversion of the zymogen plasminogen into the active protease plasmin, which efficiently degrades the fibrin mesh forming the core of a thrombus (2Collen D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1980; 43: 77-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these critical fibrinolytic enzymes, t-PA and plasmin, are members of the chymotrypsin family of serine proteases (3Pennica D. Holmes W.E. Kohr W.J. Harkins R.N. Vehar G.A. Ward C.A.

Biochem. 1977; 76: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Unlike plasmin, however, t-PA is a remarkably specific enzyme. Because such highly restricted substrate specificity is in striking contrast to the broad specificity of well studied serine proteases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase (5Perona J.J. Craik C.S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 337-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), the molecular basis of the selectivity of t-PA for plasminogen is of considerable interest. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms employed by t-PA to ensure selectivity would provide new insight into the evolution of the endogenous fibrinolytic cascade and might suggest effective new strategies for the rational design of novel, highly selective proteases with unique specificities as well as novel plasminogen activators. tissue type plasminogen activator plasminogen activator inhibitor, type 1. The specificity of t-PA for plasminogen is enhanced by the co-factor fibrin. Fibrin, t-PA, and plasminogen form a specific, ternary complex, which serves to reduce the Km of t-PA for plasminogen by a factor of greater than 400 (6Hoylaerts M. Rijken D.C. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2912-2919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7RÅnby M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 704: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 8Madison E.L. Coombs G.S. Corey D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7558-7562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Even in the absence of fibrin, however, t-PA maintains stringent specificity for plasminogen, and this specificity is an inherent property of the protease domain of t-PA (8Madison E.L. Coombs G.S. Corey D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7558-7562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although it is the only known efficient substrate for t-PA in vivo, we have presented evidence that the primary sequence surrounding the cleavage site in plasminogen is actually a poor match to optimal subsite occupancy for t-PA (9Ding L. Coombs G.S. Strandberg L. Navre M. Corey D.R. Madison E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7627-7631Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). When placed into synthetic linear or cyclic peptides or into a trypsin-accessible site in an unrelated protein, this target sequence is cleaved extremely inefficiently by t-PA (10Coombs G.S. Dang A.T. Madison E.L. Corey D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4461-4467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). By contrast, target sequences that do represent optimal subsite occupancy for t-PA, which were identified by screening a large peptide library containing random hexapeptide sequences, can be efficiently cleaved by t-PA in all three of these structural contexts (10Coombs G.S. Dang A.T. Madison E.L. Corey D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4461-4467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Catalysis of plasminogen by t-PA, therefore, appears to be accelerated not only by the co-factor fibrin but also by productive, protein-protein interactions between t-PA and plasminogen that occur at a site or sites distinct from the enzyme's active site. We have previously observed that disruption of a surface loop that maps to one edge of the active site of t-PA and is homologous to the “autolysis loop” of trypsin dramatically reduces the catalytic efficiency of t-PA for plasminogen. 2E. L. Madison, unpublished observations. Examination of this region of the protease domain of t-PA in the crystal structure revealed the presence of three hydrophobic residues, Leu420, 3Positions 275 and 420-423 of t-PA correspond to positions 15 and 147-150, respectively, in the standard chymotrypsin numbering system. Pro422, and Phe423, that were fully exposed to solvent, and therefore candidates for interaction with substrates, inhibitors, and/or co-factors (Fig. 1) (11Lamba B. Bauer M. Huber R. Fischer S. Rudolph R. Kohnert U. Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 117-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Consequently, we hypothesized that this region of the “autolysis loop” of t-PA, residues 420-423, may form an important secondary site of interaction between t-PA and plasminogen. To test this hypothesis, we used site-specific mutagenesis to construct a series of nine single-chain and nine two-chain variants of t-PA containing point mutations at positions 420-423. Point mutations mapping to residues 420-423 of t-PA significantly decreased the catalytic efficiency of t-PA for plasminogen activation in the absence of fibrin. The activity of all nine single-chain variants was reduced in this assay by factors varying from 2 to 14. The activity of eight of the nine two-chain variants was also reduced by factors of approximately 2-7 compared with wild type t-PA. These data suggest that residues 420-423, particularly Leu420, Pro422, and Phe423, form, or are critical for the integrity of, an important, secondary site of interaction between t-PA and plasminogen in the absence of fibrin. Oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis was performed by the method of Zoller and Smith (12Zoller M.J. Smith M. DNA (N.

Following mutagenesis, ssDNA corresponding to the entire 290-base pair SacI-SmaI fragment was fully sequenced to assure the presence of the desired mutation and the absence of any additional mutations. Replicative form DNA was prepared for appropriate phage, and the mutated 290-base pair SacI-SmaI fragments were recovered after digestion of the replicative form DNA with SacI and SmaI and electrophoresis of the digestion products on a 1.8% agarose gel. Each isolated 290-base pair SacI-SmaI fragment was used to replace the corresponding fragment of cDNAs encoding both t-PA and t-PA/R275E, thereby reconstructing full-length cDNAs encoding the following 18 variants of t-PA: t-PA/L420A; t-PA/R275E,L420A; t-PA/L420E; t-PA/R275E,L420E; t-PA/S421G; t-PA/R275E,S421G; t-PA/S421E; t-PA/R275E,S421E; t-PA/P422A; t-PA/R275E,P422A; t-PA/P422G; t-PA/R275E,P422G; t-PA/P422E; t-PA/P422E,R275E; t-PA/F423A; t-PA/R275E,F423A; t-PA/F423E; and t-PA/R275E,F423E. cDNAs encoding all 18 variants described above were ligated into the transient expression vector pSVT7 (14Madison E.L.

Cells were then washed with serum-free medium and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 48 h at 37°C. After the incubation with serum-free media, conditioned media were collected, and enzyme concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Wild type and mutated variants of t-PA were purified using a fast protein liquid chromatography system and a 1-ml HiTrap chelating column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The column was charged with 0.1 M CuSO4 solution, washed with 5-10 ml of distilled water, and equilibrated with start buffer (0.02 M NaHPO4, pH 7.2, 1 M NaCl, and 1 mM imidizole). Conditioned medium containing wild type or variants of t-PA was adjusted to 1 M NaCl and injected into the column with a 50-ml superloop (Pharmacia). The column was then washed with 10 column volumes of start buffer and eluted using a 0-0.32 M linear gradient of imidizole in the same buffer. Peak fractions were collected and pooled. Purified t-PA samples were concentrated, and buffer was exchanged to 25 mM Tris (pH = 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, using a Centriplus 30 concentrator (Amicon).

Chem. 1995; 270: 23444-23449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Assays were performed both in the presence and absence of the co-factor DESAFIB (American Diagnostica). The concentration of Lys-plasminogen was varied from 0.0125-0.2 μM in the presence of DESAFIB and from 0.9 to 15 μM in the absence of the co-factor. Approximately 0.25-1 ng of wild type or mutated variant of t-PA was preincubated at 23°C for 15 min with varying concentrations of highly purified, active PAI-1. Following this preincubation, each mixture was diluted, and the residual enzymatic activity was measured using a standard indirect chromogenic assay as described previously (14Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J.F. Nature. 1989; 339: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar–16Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F.

Second order rate constants for inhibition of t-PA by PAI-1 were measured under pseudo-first order conditions as described previously (15Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gething M.-J.H. Sambrook J.F.

Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5133-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, enzyme and inhibitor were preincubated at 23°C for periods of time varying from 0 to 30 min. Following preincubation, the mixtures were diluted, and residual enzymatic activity was measured in the indirect chromogenic assay and compared with control reactions in which PAI-1 was either omitted from the reaction or added after preincubation, dilution, and the addition of fibrin, plasminogen, and Spectrozyme PL to the reaction mixture. For each enzyme, the concentrations of enzyme and inhibitor were chosen to yield several data points for which the residual enzymatic activity varied between 20 and 80% of the initial activity, and the molar excess of PAI-1 over t-PA was always more than 20-fold. Data were analyzed by plotting ln(residual activity/initial activity) versus time of preincubation and calculating the resulting slope. Division of this slope by -[PAI-1] produced the second order rate constant (M-1 s-1). To investigate the functional significance of residues 420-423 in the “autolysis loop” of t-PA, we used oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis to introduce point mutations at each of these four positions. A total of nine variants were constructed; Leu420 was replaced by alanine or glutamic acid, Ser421 was replaced by glycine or glutamic acid, Pro422 was replaced by glycine, alanine, or glutamic acid, and Phe423 was replaced by alanine or glutamic acid. Because it has been demonstrated that activation cleavage of both trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen resulted in a striking rearrangement of the autolysis loop of these enzymes, it is quite possible that the interactions formed by residues 420-423 will differ for single- and two-chain t-PA (23Freer S.T. Kraut J. Robertus J.D. Wright H.T. Xuong N.H. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 1997-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar–26Kossiakoff A.A. Chambers J.L. Kay L.M. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 654-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It was therefore essential to assay both the single- and two-chain form of each variant of t-PA containing a mutation in the autolysis loop. Accurate measurement of the enzymatic activity toward plasminogen of the single-chain form of these variants proved difficult, however, because plasmin produced during the assay rapidly and efficiently converted the enzymes into their mature, two-chain form by cleaving the Arg275-Ile276 bond of the single-chain t-PA. Consequently, to overcome this technical difficulty, we also constructed noncleavable forms of the nine mutated enzymes by introducing the additional mutation R275E into the new variants, a strategy that was first described by Tate and co-workers (27Tate K.M. Higgins D.L. Holmes W.E. Winkler M.E. Heyneker H.L. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Wild type t-PA, t-PA/R275E, and all 18 variants containing mutations in the autolysis loop were cloned into the expression vector pSTV7 and produced by transient expression in COS cells. Since this procedure yielded predominantly single-chain enzymes, two-chain t-PAs were generated by treating the enzyme preparations with plasmin-Sepharose. Quantitative conversion of the enzymes into their two-chain forms was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. As previously demonstrated (27Tate K.M. Higgins D.L. Holmes W.E. Winkler M.E. Heyneker H.L. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), variants containing the mutation R275E were not cleaved by plasmin-Sepharose (data not shown). None of the nine point mutations in the autolysis loop of t-PA significantly affected the catalytic activity of the mature, two-chain form of the enzyme toward a small, synthetic substrate (Table I). Six of the two-chain variants possessed at least 92% of the activity of two-chain t-PA in this assay, and all nine of these variants displayed at least 75% of the activity of the corresponding wild type enzyme.Table IKinetic constants for the cleavage of the chromogenic substrate Spectrozyme t-PA by single- and two-chain t-PA variantst-PA variantKmkcatkcat/KmRelative kcat/KmmMs-1M-1 s-Two-chain formWild type t-PA0.4471.2 x 1051.00t-PA/L420A0.4451.1 x 1050.92t-PA/L420E0.4451.1 x 1050.92t-PA/S421G0.4369.0 x 1040.75t-PA/S421E0.4461.2 x 1051.00t-PA/P422A0.4471.2 x 1051.00t-PA/P422G0.6601.0 x 1050.83t-PA/P422E0.4491.2 x 1051.00t-PA/F423A0.5499.8 x 1040.82t-PA/F423E0.5571.1 x 1050.92Single-chain formt-PA/R275E1.0333.3 x 1041.00t-PA/L420A,R275E1.3423.2 x 1040.97t-PA/L420E,R275E0.9293.2 x 1040.97t-PA/S421G,R275E4.6235.0 x 1030.15t-PA/S421E,R275E2.3261.1 x 1040.33t-PA/P422A,R275E1.2322.7 x 1040.82t-PA/P422G,R275E1.7148.2 x 1030.25t-PA/P422E,R275E1.1312.8 x 1040.85t-PA/F423A,R275E1.0272.7 x 1040.82t-PA/F423E,R275E0.9283.1 x 1040.94 Open table in a new tab The nine point mutants mapping to residues 420-423 had slightly larger effects on the activity of the single-chain form of t-PA toward the synthetic substrate (Table I). Although six of the single-chain variants maintained at least 82% of the activity of single-chain t-PA, one of the variants, t-PA/S421G, displayed only 15% of the activity of the wild type enzyme in this assay. The catalytic activity of the remaining two variants, t-PA/R275E,P422G and t-PA/R275E,S421E, was 25 or 33%, respectively, that of single-chain t-PA. Fibrin did not stimulate the activity of t-PA, t-PA/R275E, or any of the 18 new variants toward the synthetic substrate Spectrozyme t-PA (data not shown). Interaction of these enzymes with fibrin, therefore, does not appear to significantly influence the conformation of the active site. In the presence of the co-factor fibrin, point mutations in residues 420-423 have very small effects on plasminogen activation by either single- or two-chain t-PA (Table II). Six of the nine two-chain variants possessed at least 86% of the activity of two-chain, wild type t-PA, and the catalytic efficiency of the least active two-chain variant, t-PA/P422E, was reduced by a factor of less than 2 compared with the wild type enzyme. Similarly, five of the nine single-chain variants had at least 70% of the activity of single-chain t-PA in this assay, and the catalytic efficiency of the least active single-chain variant was reduced by a factor of approximately 2 compared with the single-chain wild type enzyme (Table II). As observed with the two-chain variants, the least active single-chain variant contained the P422E mutation.Table IIKinetic constants for the cleavage of Lys-plasminogen by single- and two-chain t-PA variants in the presence of soluble fibrin (DESAFIB)t-PA variantKmkcatkcat/KmRelative kcat/KmμMs-1M-1 s-1Two-chain formWild-type t-PA0.0110.109.1 x 1061.00t-PA/L420A0.0190.178.9 x 1060.98t-PA/L420E0.0210.178.1 x 1060.89t-PA/S421G0.0160.116.9 x 1060.76t-PA/S421E0.0180.158.3 x 1060.91t-PA/P422A0.0130.118.5 x 1060.93t-PA/P422G0.0260.155.8 x 1060.64t-PA/P422E0.0290.155.2 x 1060.57t-PA/F423A0.0140.128.6 x 1060.95t-PA/F423E0.0230.187.8 x 1060.86Single-chain formt-PA/R275E0.0100.131.3 x 1071.00t-PA/L420A,R275E0.0140.181.3 x 1071.00t-PA/L420E,R275E0.0180.158.3 x 1060.64t-PA/S421G,R275E0.0260.197.3 x 1060.56t-PA/S421E,R275E0.0230.219.1 x 1060.70t-PA/P422A,R275E0.0100.151.5 x 1071.15t-PA/P422G,R275E0.0270.217.8 x 1060.60t-PA/P422E,R275E0.0280.176.1 x 1060.47t-PA/F423A,R275E0.0220.209.1 x 1060.70t-PA/F423E,R275E0.0150.151.0 x 1070.77 Open table in a new tab The catalytic efficiency for plasminogen activation in the absence of fibrin of the two-chain form of variants containing point mutations in residues 420-423 varied from 15 to 100% that of two-chain, wild type t-PA (Table III). Eight of the nine variants possessed higher affinity for plasminogen than wild type t-PA. This property was particularly evident for t-PA/L420E, t-PA/P422E, and t-PA/P422G, whose Km for plasminogen was reduced by factors of 7-8 compared with that of the wild type enzyme. kcat values for the two-chain variants, however, were all reduced, by factors varying from 2.4 to 45, compared with wild type t-PA (Table III).Table IIIKinetic constants for the cleavage of Lys-plasminogen by single- and two-chain t-PA variants in the absence of soluble fibrint-PA variantKmkcatkcat/KmRelative kcat/KmμMs-1M-1 s-1Two-chain formWild-type t-PA50.0681.4 x 1041.00t-PA/L420A10.0141.4 x 1041.00t-PA/L420E0.70.0057.1 x 1030.51t-PA/S421G40.0184.5 x 1030.32t-PA/S421E30.0165.3 x 1030.38t-PA/P422A40.0287.0 x 1030.50t-PA/P422G0.60.00284.7 x 1030.34t-PA/P422E0.70.00152.1 x 1030.15t-PA/F423A40.0205.0 x 1030.36t-PA/F423E50.0173.4 x 1030.24Single-chain formt-PA/R275E170.0241.4 x 1031.00t-PA/L420A,R275E90.0088.9 x 1020.63t-PA/L420E,R275E50.0024.0 x 1020.29t-PA/S421G,R275E40.0012.5 x 1020.18t-PA/S421E,R275E70.0022.9 x 1020.21t-PA/P422A,R275E130.0075.4 x 1020.39t-PA/P422G,R275E40.00082.0 x 1020.14t-PA/P422E,R275E50.00051.0 x 1020.07t-PA/F423A,R275E100.0044.0 x 1020.29t-PA/F423E,R275E80.0033.8 x 1020.27 Open table in a new tab All nine mutations in the autolysis loop of t-PA that we characterized significantly decreased plasminogen activation by single-chain t-PA in the absence of fibrin (Table III). For individual variants, kcat values for this reaction were decreased by factors varying from 3 to 48, resulting in catalytic efficiencies that were reduced by factors varying from 1.6 to 14. The affinity of the variants for plasminogen under these conditions was actually enhanced; Km values for the mutated enzymes were decreased by factors varying from 1.3 to 4.6. Molecular details of the stimulation of t-PA by fibrin, a complex process that almost certainly involves multiple points of contact between the two proteins, remain obscure (1Collen D. Lijnen H.R. Blood. 1991; 78: 3114-3124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lijnen H.R. Van Hoef B. Collen D. Thromb. Res. 1990; 57: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (10) Google Scholar–32Collen D. Lijnen H.R.

Fibrin stimulation of two-chain t-PA may occur through a single mechanism; stimulation of single-chain t-PA by fibrin co-factors, however, appears to utilize at least two distinct mechanisms. First, fibrin apparently stimulates both single- and two-chain t-PA through a templating mechanism, resulting in formation of a ternary complex, which greatly augments the local concentration of enzyme and substrate. Second, because single- and two-chain t-PA have equivalent activity in the presence but not in the absence of fibrin (19Tachias K. Madison E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18319-18322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Tate K.M. Higgins D.L. Holmes W.E. Winkler M.E. Heyneker H.L. Vehar G.A.

Acta. 1988; 952: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), it seems likely that binding to fibrin induces a conformational change in the activation domain of single-chain t-PA. Induction of this conformational change in the absence of activation cleavage and concomitant generation of the mature amino terminus is particularly intriguing but not unprecedented. Similar activation of plasminogen upon binding to streptokinase (35Summaria L. Arzadon L. Bernabe P. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4760-4769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar–40Reddy K.N.N. Markus G. J. Biol.

Acta. 1975; 379: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 42Hendrix H. Lindhout T. Mertens K. Engels W. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3637-3644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been described previously. Although the mechanism of this nonclassical, nonproteolytic activation of serine protease zymogens remains completely unclear, the behavior of the single-chain variants of t-PA containing mutations in the autolysis loop suggests that Leu420, Ser421, Pro422, and Phe423 do not play an essential role in this process. The properties of the corresponding two-chain variants suggest, in addition, that these residues do not play an essential role during zymogen activation of t-PA through the classical, proteolytic mechanism. The extent of fibrin stimulation displayed by the single-chain form of the variants carrying mutations in the autolysis loop is significantly greater than that displayed by wild type t-PA. Wild type two-chain t-PA possesses a fibrin stimulation factor, defined as the ratio of the catalytic efficiencies in the presence and absence of fibrin, of approximately 650 (Table V). Single-chain wild type t-PA, with a fibrin stimulation factor of 9300, is stimulated to a substantially greater degree than the two-chain enzymes, presumably reflecting the ability of fibrin to stimulate the single-chain enzyme not only through a templating mechanism but also by inducing nonproteolytic zymogen activation. Stimulation of single-chain t-PA is further enhanced by mutations in the autolysis loop. The fibrin stimulation factors for single-chain t-PA/R275E,S421E and t-PA/R275E,P422E, for example, are 31,400 and 61,000, respectively. Enhanced fibrin stimulation of the variants did not result from increased activity in the presence of fibrin but rather from decreased activity in the absence of a stimulator, an observation consistent with our proposal that the effects of these mutations are mediated by disruption of contacts between t-PA and plasminogen that are functionally significant in the absence, but not the presence, of fibrin.Table VStimulation of enzymatic activity by soluble fibrint-PA enzymeStimulation factort-PA enzymeStimulation factorTwo-chain formSingle-chain formWild-type t-PA650t-PA/R275E9300t-PA/L420A640t-PA/L420A,R275E14,600t-PA/L420E1140t-PA/L420E,R275E20,800t-PA/S421G1530t-PA/S421G,R275E29,000t-PA/S421E1570t-PA/S421E,R275E31,400t-PA/P422A1210t-PA/P422A,R275E27,800t-PA/P422G1230t-PA/P422G,R275E39,000t-PA/P422E2480t-PA/P422E,R275E61,000t-PA/F423A1720t-PA/F423A,R275E22,800t-PA/F423E2290t-PA/F423E,R275E26,300 Open table in a new tab To test whether any of the nine mutations in the autolysis loop of t-PA affected the interaction of either single- or two-chain t-PA with PAI-1, the primary inhibitor of t-PA present in human plasma, we preincubated a fixed amount of enzyme with varying concentrations of highly purified, active PAI-1 and then diluted each mixture and measured the residual enzymatic using a standard, indirect chromogenic assay. The behavior of all nine two-chain variants in this assay was indistinguishable from that of two-chain t-PA (data not shown). We conclude, therefore, that the solvent-exposed, hydrophobic region of the autolysis loop of two-chain t-PA does not form significant interactions with PAI-1. Similar results were obtained when the nine single-chain variants were subjected to this assay. None of the single-chain variants behaved significantly differently from single-chain wild type t-PA (data not shown); however, these data did suggest that two of the single-chain variants, t-PA/R275E,S421G and t-PA/R275E,P422G, might be inhibited by PAI-1 slightly less rapidly than single-chain t-PA. To examine this possibility, we measured the rate of inhibition by PAI-1 for t-PA/R275E, t-PA/R275E,S421G, and t-PA/R275E,P422G, and these data indicated that the second order rate constants for inhibition of the single-chain form of t-PA/R275E,S421G and t-PA/R275,P422G were, respectively, 3.4 x 105 and 5.0 x 105M-1 s-1, or approximately 2-3-fold lower than that observed with single-chain t-PA (Table IV).Table IVInhibition of t-PA samples by PAI-1t-PA variantSecond order rate constantM-1 s-1Single-chain formt-PA/R275E1.2 x 106t-PA/S421G,R275E3.4 x 105t-PA/P422G,R275E5.0 x 105 Open table in a new tab The chymotrypsin family has evolved to contain many members functioning in the same milieu (e.g. human plasma) that are exclusive in their reactivity toward both substrates and inhibitors. While the role of the “specificity pocket” of a serine protease in determining the “primary” or P1 specificity of the enzyme has long been appreciated (43Shotton D.M. Watson H.C. Nature. 1970; 225: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar–45Steitz T.A. Henderson R. Blow D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), additional determinants of protease specificity remain largely obscure. Although both the location and mechanism of action of these additional determinants of enzyme specificity remain unclear, their existence and critical importance are well established. For example, t-PA and almost all other proteases that participate in the fibrinolytic cascade, the coagulation cascade, and complement activation possess virtually identical, trypsin-like primary specificity pockets and exhibit identical P1 specificity (i.e. they cleave COOH-terminal to arginine and lysine residues). Nevertheless, most of these enzymes display very different substrate and inhibitor specificity. Previous studies have strongly suggested that the stringent specificity of t-PA for plasminogen is mediated in part by productive protein-protein interactions that are distinct from those occurring in the enzyme's active site (8Madison E.L. Coombs G.S. Corey D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7558-7562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar–10Coombs G.S. Dang A.T. Madison E.L. Corey D.R. J. Biol.

In the presence of fibrin, plasminogen activation by t-PA is an extremely complex reaction that appears to occur after formation of a ternary complex involving multiple sites of contact among enzyme, substrate, and co-factor (6Hoylaerts M. Rijken D.C. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2912-2919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While sites within all five structural domains of t-PA have been implicated in interaction of the enzyme with fibrin (29Madison E.L.

In the absence of fibrin, plasminogen activation by t-PA is a significantly less complex but also less efficient reaction. Nevertheless, even in the absence of co-factor, t-PA retains stringent specificity for plasminogen (8Madison E.L. Coombs G.S. Corey D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7558-7562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Since the target sequence present in plasminogen appears to be a very poor match to optimal subsite occupancy for a t-PA (9Ding L. Coombs G.S. Strandberg L. Navre M. Corey D.R. Madison E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7627-7631Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the specificity of t-PA for plasminogen under these conditions seemed very likely to be mediated by a direct, secondary interaction or interactions between t-PA and plasminogen. The goal of this investigation was to identify regions of t-PA that participated in these interactions, and our major finding is that residues 420-423 of t-PA, a solvent-exposed, hydrophobic region of the “autolysis loop” of t-PA, forms, or is critical for the integrity of, an important, secondary site of interaction between t-PA and plasminogen. During their evolution from a trypsin-like progenitor, serine proteases have acquired amino acid substitutions, deletions, and insertions most often at the protein surface, and these mutations frequently map to surface loops located near the enzyme's active site (47Blundell T.L.

We have previously suggested that the recruitment of these substituted or inserted residues, located in surface loops near the active site, to participate in specific enzyme-substrate and enzyme-inhibitor interactions is an important and recurring theme in the evolution of specificity by chymotrypsin family enzymes (14Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J.F. Nature. 1989; 339: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar–16Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F.

Our studies of the determinants of specificity for t-PA have proved consistent with this hypothesis. We have previously reported that residues located on one surface loop near the enzyme's active site modulate the interaction of t-PA with its primary endogenous inhibitor PAI-1 (14Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J.F. Nature. 1989; 339: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 16Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. Bassel-Duby R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3530-3533Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and this study demonstrated that residues mapping to another surface loop near the active site can modulate the interaction of the enzyme with substrate. The elucidation of a secondary site of interaction between t-PA and plasminogen that exerts a substantial effect in the absence, but not the presence, of fibrin provides new insight into molecular details of the evolution of stringent substrate specificity by t-PA and also suggests a novel strategy to enhance the co-factor dependence of t-PA. In fact, several of the variants described in this initial study already possess this property. While plasminogen activation by wild type t-PA is stimulated by a factor of approximately 650, the corresponding fibrin stimulation factors for t-PA/R275E,S421G; t-PA/R275E,S421E; t-PA/R275E,P422G; and t-PA/R275E,P422E, for example, are 29,200, 31,400, 39,000, and 61,000, respectively (Table V). It is therefore possible that, compared with wild type t-PA, these variants would display enhanced “clot selectivity” in vivo due to reduced activity in the circulation but full activity at a site of fibrin deposition. Whether enhanced clot selectivity would improve the enzyme as a thrombolytic agent remains extremely controversial; however, this property may assume increased importance as variants of t-PA with a prolonged circulating half-life are administered as a single bolus."

The excess heat capacity function of (H+,K+)-ATPase in highly oriented gastric vesicles displays two peaks at 53.9°C (Tm1) and 61.8°C (Tm2). Its thermal denaturation is an irreversible process that does not exhibit kinetic control and can be resolved in two independent two-state processes.

Structural domain organization of gastric H+,K+-ATPase and its rearrangement during the catalytic cycle.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 275Issue 28PreviewThe Greek letter β was used in a number of places where an α was meant. Full-Text PDF Open Access The (H+,K+)-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.36) is the electroneutral ion pump responsible for acid secretion in the gastric mucosa. In this process cytosolic H+ is exchanged 1:1 for extracellular K+. From a structural point of view this enzyme is a protomer composed of a catalytic β-subunit (95 kDa) and a glycosylated β-subunit (52 kDa). The β-subunit, a membrane multispanning polypeptide, is responsible for the coupling of ATP hydrolysis with ion transport across the membrane, whereas the β-subunit, a single membrane spanning polypeptide, is required for the proper assembly and targeting of the entire protein. According to the current models of (H+,K+)-ATPase (1Sachs G. Besancon M. Shin J.M. Mercier F. Munson K. Hersey S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 301-308PubMed Google Scholar), the β-subunit has 795 amino acid residues exposed on the cytoplasmic side (i.e. extravesicular side), 172 amino acids embedded, and 66 amino acid residues located in the vesicle interior (intravesicular side). The β-subunit is mainly intravesicular, with 225 amino acid residues inside the vesicle, 40 amino acid residues on the cytoplasmic side, and a single transmembrane segment of 27 residues. The gastric (H+,K+)-ATPase is a member of the P-ATPase family and shares many features, including sequence homology and enzymatic mechanism, with other members such as the Ca2+-ATPase (2McLennan D.H. Brandl C.J. Korczak B. Green N.M. Nature. 1985; 316: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) and especially the (Na+,K+)-ATPase (3Shull G.E. Schwartz A. Lingrel J.B.

Two major conformations, called E1 1The abbreviations used are: E1unligated form of the enzymeE1-vanenzyme form obtained in the presence of vanadateE1-Pphosphoenzyme form obtained in the presence of Ca2+E2-K+enzyme conformer blocked by K+E2-Pphosphoenzyme generated in the presence of Mg2+E2-vanconformer stabilized by vanadate in the presence of Mg2+E2-van-K+enzyme form obtained in the presence of Mg2+, vanadate and K+PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisDSCdifferential scanning calorimetry. and E2, have been identified. In the E1 conformation the proton binding site is cytosolic, and the phosphorylated enzyme reacts with ADP to form ATP (4Rabon E. Sachs G. Mardh S. Wallmark B. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1987; 905: 358-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The E1-phosphorylated enzyme converts spontaneously to the E2-phosphorylated form of the enzyme, which is no longer sensitive to ADP but is rapidly dephosphorylated in the presence of K+ (6Wallmark B. Stewart H.B. Rabon E. Saccomani G. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5313-5319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While definite conformational changes take place during the catalytic cycle as demonstrated from fluorescence of fluorescein-labeled β-subunit (7Jackson R.J. Mendlein J. Sachs G. Biochim. Biophys.

Biophys. Acta. 1987; 905: 358-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), little is known on the nature of these conformational changes. Amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange kinetics for Neurospora plasma membrane H+-ATPase have shown that at least 175 amino acid residues are shielded from the solvent in an E2 conformation (9Goormaghtigh E.

Membrane disposition of the H5-H6 hairpin of the homologous (Na+,K+)-ATPase β-subunit has shown to be ligand-dependent (10Lutsenko S. Aderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Differential scanning calorimetry can provide information on the structural organization in cooperative domains and on domain-domain interactions in proteins (11Privalov P. Adv. Protein Chem. 1979; 33: 167-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar, 12Privalov P. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 1-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 13Brandts J.F. Hu C.Q.

However, as discussed by others (11Privalov P. Adv. Protein Chem. 1979; 33: 167-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar, 12Privalov P. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 1-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 14Ramsay G. Freire E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8677-8683Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the number of cooperative units does not always exhibit a straightforward relation with the number of structural domains identified by x-ray crystallography. While this approach has been widely used for water-soluble proteins, there are still only a few studies on membrane proteins (15Haltia T. Freire E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1228: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We have used this approach in the present study to investigate the structural organization into cooperative domains of the (H+,K+)-ATPase and its modulation by ligand binding. Proteinase K digestion of highly oriented gastric vesicles was used to locate the melting cooperative domains in the different topological regions of the protein. Analysis of the variations induced by ligand binding on the thermal denaturation of the enzyme has allowed us a tentative assignment of these cooperative domains in terms of their specific binding activities and has revealed the existence of structural rearrangements during the catalytic cycle. The materials used throughout the whole experimentation were of the highest purity grade available. Proteinase K, vanadate, ATP, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, nigericin, ouabain, and oligomycin were obtained from Sigma. SDS-PAGE reagents were of electrophoresis grade from Bio-Rad. Gastric vesicles were isolated from hog gastric fundus by differential centrifugation and discontinuous sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (16Soumarmon A. Abastado M. Bonfils S. Lewin M.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11682-11687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Robert J.C. Benkouka F. Bayle D. Hervatin F. Soumarmon A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1024: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The material collected at the 8-30% sucrose interface is referred to as gastric vesicles in this paper. SDS-PAGE reveals essentially a major band of 95 kDa, corresponding to the β-subunit, and a smear of 60-90 kDa, due to the β-subunit. This smear is only resolved as a single band after deglycosylation of the β-subunit (see below). ATPase activity was measured in 40 mM Hepes-Tris, pH 7.2, containing 2 mM ATP and 2 mM MgCl2 in presence or in absence of 20 mM KCl. Sucrose (8%) was present or absent as indicated to create isotonic or osmotic shock conditions, respectively. Reaction was performed at 37°C for 15 min and stopped by addition of SDS (final concentration 1.75%). Inorganic phosphate released from ATP was quantified according to Stanton (18Stanton M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 22: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), except that coloration was developed with ascorbate. Vesicles containing the (H+,K+)-ATPase (2.5 mg ml−1 protein concentration) in 50 mM Hepes-Tris, pH 7.2, containing 8% sucrose (conservation buffer) were incubated at 37°C with proteinase K in a protease/protein ratio of 1:4 (w/w). Proteolysis was halted by the addition of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (6 mM final concentration). The digested vesicles were adjusted to 0.5 M NaCl and shaken on ice for a few minutes. Then the NaCl concentration was set at 0.25 M by adding 1 mM Hepes buffer, and the samples were centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 45 min. The resulting pellets were resuspended in the conservation buffer, pelleted again in the same conditions, and stored at −20°C. Aliquots were removed after 5 min, 30 min, 1, 4, 7, 24, 48, and 72 h from the digestion mixture. Since ATPase digestion reaches a plateau after 1 h, as measured from the lipid/protein ratio in the reisolated vesicles, 1-h incubation periods were routinely used for the experiments described in this paper. Calorimetric measurements were performed in a Microcal MC-2 differential scanning calorimeter (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA) at a heating rate of 0.5 K min−1, unless otherwise stated and under an extra constant pressure of 2 atm. The standard DynaCp, CpCalc, DA-2, and Microcal Origin softwares were used for data acquisition and analysis. The excess heat capacity functions were obtained after base-line subtraction and correction for the instrument time response. In all cases thermal denaturation was found to be irreversible. Since buffer-buffer base lines had the same shape as rescans, the latter could be used as instrument base lines because the offset in Cp due to aggregation or other causes was unimportant (19Conejero-Lara F. Mateo P.L. Avilés F.X. Sánchez-Ruiz J.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2067-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Gastric vesicle samples were prepared at a 0.5-2.0 mg/ml protein concentration in 50 mM Hepes-Tris, pH 7.2, containing 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EGTA, and the required ligands. The presence of 0.25 M sucrose in the buffer is essential to maintain the integrity of gastric vesicles. Samples requiring 2 mM MgCl2 or CaCl2 were prepared by centrifugation at 75,000 × g for 15 min after a 4-fold dilution in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, and further resuspension of vesicles in an EGTA-depleted buffer containing 2 mM divalent cation chloride. Variations in the buffer pH with temperature were negligible in the 20-80°C range (7.20 ± 0.15) and followed by a sharp drop to pH 6.65 at 95°C. The addition of ionizable ligands at the concentration required in the present experiments did not cause additional modifications of pH. The (H+,K+)-ATPase Mr considered for calculations was 147,000 assuming a 90% of total protein abundance. Purity of gastric vesicle (H+,K+)-ATPase as well as proteinase K digestion products was analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% acrylamide gels (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207509) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA kit (Pierce) or a modified Lowry assay (21Bensadou A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard in both cases. Lipids were assayed with the MPR2 enzymatic test specific for the choline derivatives (Boehringer Mannheim), assuming that lipids carrying a choline group represent 50% of the total of the lipids (22Swarts H. Van Uem T. Hoving S. Fransen J. de Pont J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1070: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The β-subunit of the (H+,K+)-ATPase was deglycosylated using N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim) under denaturing conditions. Gastric vesicles (20 ml of 1 mg/ml protein concentration solutions) were boiled for 3 min in SDS 1% (w/v) and β-mercaptoethanol 1% (v/v). Then, 25 ml of n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside 10% (w/v), 150 ml of phosphate-buffered saline/EDTA buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1.47 mM KH2PO4, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, and 20 mM EDTA), and 30 ml of N-glycosidase F (250 units/ml) were added before incubation at 37°C during 24 h. Gastric vesicle thermal denaturation has been studied by differential scanning calorimetry. The result of a typical scan of gastric vesicles in 50 mM Hepes-Tris, pH 7.05, containing 0.25 M sucrose and 1 mM EGTA at 0.5 K min−1 scan rate is shown in Fig. 1 (trace b). Such a result is representative of those obtained with at least three different enzyme preparations and varying the protein concentration in the 0.5-2.0 mg ml−1 range. The standard deviation of the mean in five independent experiments amounted to ± 25 kcal mol−1 for the overall ΔH (281 kcal mol−1) and ±0.2°C in peak positions. The thermogram, in the 15-95°C temperature range, is characterized by the presence of two overlapping peaks, at 53.9 Tm1 and 61.8°C (Tm2), in agreement with previous studies (23Sachs G. Berglindh T. Rabon E. Stewart H.B. Wallmark B. Saccomani G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1980; 341: 312-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Since about 90% of gastric vesicle total protein is (H+,K+)-ATPase and the thermal-induced transitions occur within the temperature range described for most proteins, including (Ca2+,Mg2+)-ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum (24Lepock J.R. Rodahl A.M. Zhang C. Heynen M.L. Waters B. Cheng K.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25Merino J.M. Moller J.V. Gutiérrez-Merino C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), it seems likely that both peaks correspond to the (H+,K+)-ATPase denaturation. This assignment is further supported by the sensitivity of both peaks to (H+,K+)-ATPase-specific ligands (see below). Thermal denaturation of (H+,K+)-ATPase is an irreversible process under all conditions employed, as indicated by the fact that no endotherm is seen on rescanning the samples under any of the experimental conditions employed. Partial heating experiments show that both transitions are irreversible and proceed independently (data not shown). The effect of scanning rate on the heat capacity profile and thermodynamic parameters was studied (Fig. 1, traces A-C) in order to inspect a possible kinetic control in the denaturation process. Tm1 values are scanning rate independent, within the experimental uncertainty. Tm2 is initially shifted toward lower values as the heating rate decreases and then becomes constant at the lowest scanning rate tested (0.5 and 0.33 K min−1). This type of dynamic effect is consistent with the existence of a slow relaxation process between native and reversibly unfolded forms and excludes a kinetic control by the irreversible steps. Thus, application of equilibrium thermodynamics to the experimental traces would not lead to significant errors (26Freire E. van Osdol W. Mayorga O.L. Sánchez-Ruiz J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 159-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In fact, irreversibility appears to be a general feature of membrane protein thermal denaturation arising from the aggregation of the unfolded state in the membrane plane (15Haltia T. Freire E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1228: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 27Hall K. Perez G. Anderson D. Gutierrez C. Munson K. Hersey S. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). (H+,K+)-ATPase thermal-induced denaturation can be resolved into two independent two-state processes (ΔHvH/ΔH = 1) with enthalpy changes of 165 and 116 kcal mol−1 for the first and second transitions, respectively (Fig. 1, Table I). Identical values for the calorimetric and the van't Hoff enthalpies are found.Table IThermodynamic parameters of gastric (H+,K+)-ATPase thermal denaturation: effect of E1-promoting ligandsLigandFitting modelTm1ΔH1ΔHvH1Tm2ΔH2ΔHvH2°Ckcal/molkcal/mol°Ckcal/molkcal/molNoneRandom53.916516561.8116116van 34 μMRandom54.923315062.4130130van 140 μMRandom56.622018162.1123123van 1 mMSequential58.220020062.0116116van 5 mMSequential60.419619662.0120120Ca2+ 2 mMSequential55.219619760.1120120Ca2+ 2 mM+ ATP 0.27 mMSequential56.320320361.2118118Ca2+ 2 mM+ ATP 1 mMSequential57.220220262.2108108EDTA 1 mM+ ATP 1 mMRandom55.318518562.5110110 Open table in a new tab To get insight into the protein regions involved in thermal transitions, (H+,K+)-ATPase was digested with proteinase K to differentiate the contributions of different topological regions (cytoplasmic, membrane-embedded, or vesicle internal parts). Accounting for asymmetric distribution of the α- and β-subunits of (H+,K+)-ATPase across the membrane, treatment with proteases will also allow separation of the α-subunit contribution (α-subunit is the main cytoplasmic protruding fraction) from the β-subunit, provided that gastric vesicles remain sealed during the isolation process. Activity measurements were carried out to check the integrity and orientation of the (H+,K+)-ATPase in the isolated vesicles. Enzymatic activities are 30 (expressed as μmol Pi/(mg·h)) in the absence of KCl (basal unspecific activity) and 122 in the presence of KCl after vesicle opening by osmotic shock by dilution in a sucrose-free assay medium. Therefore, the full access of ATP and K+ to both side of the membrane results in a supplementary activity of 92 μmol Pi/(mg·h). In the absence of osmotic shock, the supplementary activity was 6 μmol of Pi/(mg·h), accounting for the open vesicles present in the preparation (6.5%) and increases to 81 in the presence of the H+/K+ exchanger nigericin. These results indicate that at least 88% of the vesicles are sealed and exhibit the ATP binding site on the outside of the vesicle, which agrees with the data reported elsewhere (22Swarts H. Van Uem T. Hoving S. Fransen J. de Pont J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1070: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 27Hall K. Perez G. Anderson D. Gutierrez C. Munson K. Hersey S. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Since the ATP binding site is located on the largest cytoplasmic loop of the α-subunit (loop C3 limited by H4 and H5 hydrophobic regions), the above results demonstrate that at least 88% of the isolated gastric vesicles exhibit that region directed outside the vesicle. Before DSC experiments, gastric vesicles were first treated with proteinase K in iso-osmotic conditions. Separation from digested peptide fragments and protease followed, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” According to the (H+,K+)-ATPase current model, a large fraction of the α-subunit should be removed by this treatment, whereas most of the β-subunit should remain intact. SDS-PAGE analysis of the deglycosylated β-subunit give molecular masses of 31 kDa for the untreated β-subunit and 30.5 kDa (starting at Gly-31 (28Raussens V. Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (in press {411467})Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)), without intensity loss, after proteinase K digestion. The β-subunit band completely disappears when the digestion is performed under osmotic shock conditions (data not shown). Therefore, the protease protection observed in iso-osmotic conditions is due to the intravesicular disposition of the largest portion of the β-subunit, which agrees with the above described model. Regarding the α-subunit, SDS-PAGE analysis reveals that its 95-kDa polypeptide chain practically disappears (more than 95%) upon proteinase K digestion, even in the absence of osmotic shock (data not shown). The largely cytoplasmic localization of this subunit is confirmed because no fragments with a mass greater than 20 kDa were detected. No thermal transition was observed in the thermograms of proteinase K-digested gastric vesicles (Fig. 1, trace D), even at protein concentrations of 2.0 mg ml−1. This finding excludes an independent contribution of the largest part of the β-subunit to the heat capacity profile of (H+,K+)-ATPase obtained with intact gastric vesicles. The contribution of the transmembrane stalk to the heat capacity function is also excluded, since the structure of this region is preserved in the protease treatment (28Raussens V. Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (in press {411467})Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Besancon M. Shin J.M. Mercier F. Munson K. Miller M. Hersey S.

Therefore, the thermal transitions observed in intact gastric vesicles should be assigned to the melting of two cooperative domains located in the cytoplasmic protruding segments of the α-subunit. This assignment is also supported by the finding of two different transitions in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Ca2++Mg2+)-ATPase (24Lepock J.R. Rodahl A.M. Zhang C. Heynen M.L. Waters B. Cheng K.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), homologous protein that does not contain β-subunit. As demonstrated for the (Na+,K+)-ATPase and other P-ATPases, the catalytic cycle of the (H+,K+)-ATPase is characterized by the presence of two families of conformations, E1 and E2, both in phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms, with a conformational transition linked to cation transport. The E1 conformation presents a cytoplasmic-facing H+ site and exhibits a high affinity for ATP. After phosphorylation of the α-subunit by ATP, an E2 conformation appears, characterized by its high affinity for K+ ions and the low affinity for ATP and H+ (for a more complete description see 31Rabbon E.C. Reuben M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Among the different ligands potentially affecting the (H+,K+)-ATPase conformational equilibrium, K+ is known to promote the E2 conformation. Fluorescence of fluorescein-labeled α-subunit (7Jackson R.J. Mendlein J. Sachs G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 731: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and limited trypsin digestion (5Helmich-de Jong M.L. van Emst-de Vries S.E. de Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 905: 358-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) revealed qualitative differences in the tertiary structure of the protein when bound by different ligands. Secondary structure probed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (32Mitchell R.C. Haris P.I. Fallowfield C. Keeling D.J. Chapman D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 941: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) did not show significant modification. However, it must be noted that some variation in the α-helical content had been observed before by circular dichroism (23Sachs G. Berglindh T. Rabon E. Stewart H.B. Wallmark B. Saccomani G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1980; 341: 312-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Since very little is known about the nature of these conformational changes, we have investigated here the effect of the E1-E2 ligand-induced transitions on the structural organization of the enzyme. In addition, the analysis of the effect of ligand binding on (H+,K+)-ATPase thermal denaturation can provide further insight into the functional role and, thus, the location of the unfolding cooperative units. Thermal denaturation of ligand-bound (H+,K+)-ATPase is irreversible under all conditions tested and exhibits the same scanning rate dependence as the unligated protein. It should be mentioned that instrumental artifacts, resulting in exothermic peaks at high temperatures, may be observed at fast scanning rates in irreversible denaturations (33Burz D.S. Allewell N.M. Ghosaini L. Hu C.Q. Sturtevant J.M. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 37: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Vanadate binding drives the enzyme into the E1-van form. DSC scans of (H+,K+)-ATPase in the presence of increasing vanadate concentration are reported in Fig. 2, and the thermodynamic parameters are listed in Table I. Vanadate interaction produces a progressive increase in Tm1 that results in merging of both transitions above 0.14 mM concentration (Fig. 2). Therefore, deconvolution analysis was performed assuming either a random model for two independent elementary transitions (domains independently undergo a transition between the folded and denatured forms) or a sequential model for two sequential two-state transitions (domain stability is dependent on whether other domains are folded or unfolded) (13Brandts J.F. Hu C.Q. Lin N.L. Mas M.T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8588-8596Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 34Freire E. Biltonen R.L. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 463-479Crossref Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 35Freire E. Biltonen R.L. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 481-496Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). At saturating vanadate concentrations, deconvolution assuming the sequential model gives best fit of the experimental data (Table I) revealing interdomain communication. However, when Tm1 and Tm2 are separated and the overlap is minimal (vanadate concentrations below 1 mM) consideration of one non-two-state transition is required for best fit. Taking into account the value of the Kd of vanadate (30 μM) (36Faller L.D. Rabon E. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4676-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), these deviations observed under non-saturating conditions probably arise from the reequilibration of the binding equilibrium coupled to protein denaturation, as the temperature is increased (37Shrake A. Ross P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5055-5059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reequilibration of the binding and the unfolding processes with temperature causes a deviation of the first peak from the ideal two-state transition, and such distortion is also manifested in the apparent thermodynamic parameters derived, under these conditions, for the second peak. The observed effects upon vanadate interaction with the (H+,K+)-ATPase (increment of Tm1 and ΔH1, and invariability of Tm2 and ΔH2) is consistent with a direct interaction of this ligand with the cooperative domain involved in the lower temperature transition. Since vanadate is thought to bind at the phosphate site in the C3 loop of the α-subunit, near Asp-385 (23Sachs G. Berglindh T. Rabon E. Stewart H.B. Wallmark B. Saccomani G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1980; 341: 312-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to assign the first transition to a cooperative domain containing this region. B"

Previous studies (Wu, L., and Koudelka, G. B. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 18975-18981) show that the structure of the P22 repressor-operator complex varies with central base sequence. Here we show that central base sequence composition affects the strength of two, and likely all, specific amino acid-base pair contacts between synthetic P22 operators and P22 repressor. However, altering a specific protein-DNA contact via a loss-of-contact mutation in repressor results in a loss of specificity at only one contacted position. Thus, only changing the sequence of non-contacted bases affects repressor's global base specificity. The observed effects of ionic concentration on the affinities of various operators for repressor and the DNase I patterns of protein complexes with these binding sites indicate certain central base sequences facilitate optimal juxtaposition of repressor with its contacted bases, while others prevent it. The existence of different structural forms of the repressor-operator complexes explains how the relative energetic importance of specific amino acid-base pair edge contacts is modulated.

The existence of different structural forms of the repressor-operator complexes explains how the relative energetic importance of specific amino acid-base pair edge contacts is modulated. The c2 gene of the lambdoid bacteriophage P22 codes for a DNA-binding protein called the P22 repressor. P22 repressor displays both structural and functional homology with the repressors of other lambdoid bacteriophages (1Sauer R.T. Yocum R.R. Doolittle R.F. Lewis M. Pabo C.O. Nature. 1982; 298: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The repressor proteins of all lambdoid phages control the developmental fate of the phage by acting as transcriptional regulators. This regulation is mediated by the binding of a repressor dimer to two operator regions on the phage chromosome (2Ptashne M. A Genetic Switch. Blackwell Press, Palo Alto, CA1986Google Scholar). These two regions, designated OR and OL, are each further divided into three closely spaced binding sites, called operators. In all these phages, the repressor displays a hierarchy of affinities for these six operators. This ability of repressor to discriminate between binding sites is critical for the phage's decision between lytic or lysogenic development. Binding of repressor to sites for which its has the highest affinity activates transcription of genes responsible for the maintenance of lysogeny and concurrently inhibits transcription of the genes responsible for lytic development. The developmental fate of the phage is thus critically dependent on the ability of repressor to discriminate between these different operators. Sequence-specific DNA recognition requires precise matching between the molecular surfaces of protein and DNA. At the atomic level, direct reading of the DNA sequence occurs by interaction of amino acid side chains and/or peptide backbone atoms with the functional groups in DNA. These interactions require chemical complementarity between the interacting atoms. Ensuring that these chemically complementary interactions can occur requires structural complementarity along the interacting surfaces of the protein and DNA molecules. If the functional groups in the protein are not properly juxtaposed with those in the DNA, the stability of the protein DNA complex is compromised. Non-contacted bases within or adjacent to the binding site can therefore indirectly affect the affinity of DNA for protein by modulating the proper alignment between the functional groups of the protein and the DNA. Indirect effects could arise from sequence-dependent differences in the structure of the unbound and/or bound DNA, and/or the resistance of the DNA to distortion into the configuration appropriate for stable complex formation. The sequences of the P22 phage operators are partially rotationally symmetric (Fig. 1). The repressor binding site is 18 base pairs in length (3Poteete A. Ptashne M. Ballivet M. Eisen H. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 137: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Inspection of these binding site sequences reveals that the outermost bases are highly conserved while the innermost bases are highly divergent (Fig. 1). Specific contacts made between the P22 repressor and the DNA are restricted to the outermost bases of the operator, while the central four bases are not contacted (4Wu L. Vertino A. Koudelka G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9134-9139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1S. Hilchey, L. Wu, and G. Koudelka, manuscript in preparation. Although central bases of the operators are not contacted, the binding affinity of P22 repressor for operator is modulated by the sequence composition of these bases (4Wu L. Vertino A. Koudelka G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9134-9139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Wu L. Koudelka G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18975-18981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These modulations in affinity are due, at least in part, to sequence-dependent structural differences among operators bearing different central base sequences (5Wu L. Koudelka G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18975-18981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the torsional flexibility of the DNA does not appear to play a significant role in determining the affinity of P22 operator for P22 repressor (5Wu L. Koudelka G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18975-18981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), other differences in DNA structure do appear to play a part in governing the strength of this complex. For example, P22 repressor prefers binding sites with a narrower minor groove at the center of the binding site. We have shown that central base sequence directs the geometry of this groove (5Wu L. Koudelka G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18975-18981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have suggested that the central sequence-dependent modulation of DNA twist and geometry of the minor groove at the center of the binding site ultimately results in differences in the affinity of various operators for repressor due to an alteration in the number and/or geometry of protein-DNA contacts. In this paper we further examine the effect that central sequence-based structural differences have on the specificity of interaction between synthetic P22 operators and P22 repressor protein. Data presented here demonstrate that the strength of specific amino acid-base pair interactions in the P22 repressor-operator complex are influenced by central sequence context. Changes in the central sequence can make repressor blind to mutations in bases which are contacted by the protein. We also present data which gives insight into how these non-contacted base pairs are modulating these protein DNA contacts. DNA manipulations were performed as described (6Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The sequences of the binding sites used are given in Fig. 1. The positions of the individual bases in the rotationally symmetric binding site sequence are numbered consecutively from 1-18. The center of symmetry of the sequence lies between bases 9 and 10. Central base changes discussed in this paper refer to symmetric changes of both central bases. All changes in contacted bases were made in only one half-site of the symmetric binding site. The binding site oligonucleotides were purchased (Integrated DNA Technologies), annealed, and ligated into the unique SalI site in pUC18 (7Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 20-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (3399) Google Scholar). The sequences of the resulting plasmids were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (8Sanger F. Donelson J.E. Coulson A.R. Kossel H. Fischer D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1209-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). These DNA molecules were cleaved at the EcoRI site and 3′-end-labeled by repairing the recessed ends with Klenow fragment and [α-32P]dATP. The resulting ∼2700-base pair linear DNAs were used directly in filter binding studies. For the DNase I protection experiments, the labeled DNA was cut with HindIII, and the resulting ∼83-base pair operator-containing DNA fragment was isolated from agarose gels. Control experiments showed that within this size range the affinity of repressor for DNA and the structure of the repressor-DNA complexes are independent of DNA length. P22 repressor was isolated from the Escherichia coli strain XA90 bearing either the pTP125 (9De Anda J. Poteete A.R. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10536-10542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the pTPΔ125-ALA-32 plasmids that cause the overproduction of wild-type or mutant P22 repressor bearing a Asn-32 → Ala change, respectively. pTP125 was a gift from A. Poteete (University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester, MA). pTPΔ125-ALA-32 was constructed in two steps. First, one of the two EcoRI sites (upstream of the tac promoter in pTP125) was destroyed by partial digestion of the plasmid pTP125 with EcoRI followed by repair of the recessed ends with Klenow in the presence of deoxynucleotides and subsequent ligation. This created the plasmid pTPΔ125. Second, the 220-base pair EcoRI-Csp 45I fragment of pTPΔ125 which encodes the amino-terminal portion of P22 repressor was replaced with a DNA fragment bearing the mutation which changes Asn-32 to Ala. Both P22 repressors were purified as described by DeAnda et al. (9De Anda J. Poteete A.R. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10536-10542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose filter binding experiments were performed as described (4Wu L. Vertino A. Koudelka G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9134-9139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction buffer for these assays contained 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.8, and 50 mM, 100 mM, or 150 mM KCl. The counts retained on the filter as a function of P22 repressor concentration were converted to fractional saturation values (10Lin S. Riggs A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 72: 671-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). For each operator and buffer condition, the range protein concentrations used to determine KD was adjusted so that the fractional saturation values between 10 and 90% were obtained over a 15-fold protein concentration range. In all cases, the protein concentration corresponding to the KD was located in the middle of this range. Fractional saturation values were determined in duplicate. Three to five duplicate measurements were averaged and dissociation constants (KD) were determined from non-linear least squares fits to the data. The maximum variation in the KD determined from each duplicate measured was less than 2-fold. The standard deviations of the reported dissociation constants were less than 5% of the value. DNase I protection assays were performed essentially as described (11Johnson A.D. Meyer B.J. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5061-5065Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Briefly, binding reactions were performed in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2.5 μg ml−1 of sonicated chick blood DNA, 100 μg ml−1 of bovine serum albumin, ≤1 nM operator DNA, either 50 mM or 150 mM KCl, and an appropriate amount of P22 repressor. After a 10-min incubation at 23°C, sufficient DNase I was added to give, on average, one cleavage/DNA molecule in 5 min of further incubation. Following reaction with DNase I, the ethanol-precipitated samples were suspended in 90% formamide dye mixture and denatured by heating at 90°C. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 25 × 30 cm denaturing 7.5% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 M urea, 89 mM Tris-HCl, 89 mM sodium borate, and 1 mM EDTA. Reaction products were visualized by exposing the gel to a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImaging screen overnight. The screen was scanned on a Molecular Dynamics Model 425E PhosphorImager at 80 μm resolution. The resulting bands were then quantified using Molecular Dynamics ImageQuantNT™ software (version 4.1). Line graphs (Fig. 4) represent one-pixel-wide areas generated by drawing lines down the center of individual lanes (Fig. 3). Peak heights were normalized to peaks on either side of the DNase I protected area that do not change in intensity upon repressor binding. All intensity values reported in the text are pixel volumes calculated by theFig. 3DNase I footprinting analysis of synthetic 9T and 9C operators with either a consensus 3T or non-consensus 3A contacted region at 50 mM KCl. DNase I experiments were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Shown is a PhosphorImager scan of the gel. The sequence of the operator is shown at the center. The numbers denote operator positions as described in Fig. 1. Bands resulting from DNase I cleavages in the absence (−) and presence (+) of saturating concentrations of P22 repressor are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The above results show that eliminating a specific protein-DNA contact by mutating the protein does not eliminate repressor's other contacted base preferences. Elimination of contacted base specificity appears to be caused only by changing the non-contacted central sequence. Moreover, these data show that removing a specific contact does not render the repressor insensitive to the central sequence-directed loss of specificity. The latter observation implies to us that the mutant repressor would have normal ability to distinguish between operators bearing different central sequences. Surprisingly, the loss of a specific position 3 contact via an amino acid substitution also renders repressor insensitive to central sequence changes. Specifically, when 9T is substituted with 9C in the context of a consensus contacted region, the affinity of the operators for repressor bearing the Ala-32 change decreases by only 1.5-fold (Table II, lines 1 and 3). This is in marked contrast to the 20-fold decrease in affinity of operator for wild type repressor when 9T is changed to 9C (Table I, lines 1 and 5). Thus, any alteration of a specific contact, either by changing the protein or DNA sequence, desensitizes the protein to changes in non-contacted central bases, but the contacted base specificity of these proteins is still influenced by the identity of the central bases. These observations suggest that contacted base recognition by P22 repressor is inextricably linked only to the identity of the non-contacted central base sequence.Table IIAffinity of position 5-substituted synthetic central sequence variant P22 operators for Ala-32 mutant P22 repressorLineCentral sequenceContacted baseKD (× 108M)19T5A (Ref)6.825C3439C5A (Ref)1045C20 Open table in a new tab Table IAffinity of contacted region variant synthetic P22 operators for wild-type P22 repressor in two different central sequence contextsLineCentral sequenceContacted baseKD (× 108M)19T3T (Ref)0.523C1033A7.943G1459C3T (Ref)1163C2373A2383G1199T5C9109C5C18 Open table in a new tab We wished to gain further insight into the mechanism by which the central bases of the P22 operator affect the strength of specific amino acid-base pair contacts. To do this, the effect of salt on the stabilities of several P22 repressor-operator complexes was determined. This method allowed separation of the overall binding affinities of the various operators for repressor into their ionic and non-ionic components. We compared the effect of substituting the contacted T:A base pair at position 3 with an A:T pair in both the 9T and 9C central sequence contexts at ionic concentrations ranging from 50 to 150 mM KCl. In the operator bearing a 9T central sequence, changing position 3 from T:A to A:T results in a protein-DNA complex that is more sensitive to changes in ionic concentration. The affinity of the 3A-9T operator for P22 repressor decreases more than 4-fold between 50 and 150 mM KCl. This compares to the less than 1.7-fold effect of changing salt concentration on the stability of the 3T-9T operator-repressor complex (Fig. 2). The increased dependence of the 3A-9T mutant operator's affinity for repressor on ionic concentration indicates that ionic interactions contribute more to the overall affinity of this repressor-operator complex than they do in the 3T-9T repressor-operator complex. This result suggests that the overall structures of these two complexes differ. In contrast to the results obtained with the 9T-containing operators, changing the identity of the position 3 base from a T:A to A:T base pair in the context of the 9C central sequence has little, if any, additional effect on the sensitivity of the 9C operator-repressor complex to changes in ionic concentration. The affinity of the 3A-9C mutant operator decreases 14-fold between 50 and 150 mM KCl as compared to the 12-fold decrease in the affinity of 3T-9C for repressor in this range (Fig. 2). Analysis of these data by the method of Record et al. (13Record Jr., M.T. Lohman T.M. DeHaseth P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 107: 145-158Crossref Scopus (926) Google Scholar) indicates 0.5 (±0.25) cations are displaced by each monomer of repressor binding to the 9T operator whereas 2.4 (±0.2) cations are displaced by each monomer when repressor binds to the 9C operator. When a similar analysis is performed on the 9T operators bearing consensus or non-consensus position 3 bases, the number of cations released increases from 0.5 to 1.5 (±0.5) as the consensus 3T is substituted with a 3A base. Interestingly, in the 9C central sequence context, the number of cations displaced when a 3A base is substituted for a 3T base does not significantly increase, 2.4 versus 2.6 (±0.2) cations. Hence, changing a contacted base in the context of a 9C central sequence does not appear to influence the relative importance of ionic interactions to the binding of the 9C central sequence containing operators. The results of mutational and biochemical analyses of the various P22 repressor-DNA complexes suggest that the structures of these complexes vary with central sequence. This suggestion was tested by probing the structure of unbound and P22 repressor-bound operators by DNase I. The rate of DNase I cleavage of DNA is proportional to the accessibility of the scissile bond and is reflected in the observed band intensity. The conformation of the DNA phosphate backbone of four synthetic P22 operators was partially digested with DNase I in the presence or absence of protein at lower (50 mM) or higher (150 mM) KCl concentrations. Identical results were obtained at both salt concentrations (Fig. 3 and data not shown). As we observed previously, the DNase I cleavage patterns of the uncomplexed 9T and 9C operators differ from each other. Inspection of these data show that the structure of the unbound operator varies not only at the site of substitution, but also several bases away (Fig. 3, Fig. 4A). Specifically, a comparison of the digestion patterns of these operators shows that when the central base pairs are changed from T:A-A:T to C:G-G:C, the rate of cleavage at position 9 of the operator increases slightly, while that at position 11 decreases nearly 3-fold. Farther away from the site of substitution, in the upstream portion of the operator, cleavage rates are also different. The intensities of the bands resulting from cleavage at positions 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the 9C operator increase between 20 and 200% as compared to cleavages at these positions in the 9T operator (Fig. 4A). Significantly, these affected bases lie in the contacted region of the operator. These data suggest that changing the central sequence in the P22 operator causes a global change in the structure of the unbound operator. Upon binding repressor, the size and position of the DNA protected from DNase I is similar in both the 9T and 9C operators (Fig. 3). This similarity in protection pattern indicates that repressor binds specifically to both of these binding sites, despite the lack of base specificity displayed by repressor when binding to 9C-containing operators (Table I). Closer inspection of the DNase I data shows that the cleavages at positions 3 and 5 of the 9C operator are hypersensitive relative to the 9T operator, by 1.3- and 2.1-fold, respectively (Fig. 4B). Differences in the intensities are observed in the downstream portion of the operator as well. For example, position 12 is 2-fold more hypersensitive to DNase I cleavage in the 9C as compared with the 9T operator (Fig. 4B). As observed with the uncomplexed operators, these cleavage differences are in the region of the operator which is specifically contacted by the repressor, even though the only nucleotide changes are in the non-contacted central sequence. Thus, central sequence-dependent cleavage variability is observed both in the uncomplexed DNA and the repressor-operator complexes. The cleavage differences observed in the uncomplexed DNAs are exacerbated upon repressor binding such that the structures of the resulting 9T and 9C operator-repressor complexes are distinct from each other. To further study the effect of central sequence on repressor's interaction with the contacted region of the operator, we examined the effect of a position 3 half-site mutation on the DNase I cleavage pattern of both 9T and 9C operators. Examination of Figs. 3, 4C, and 4E clearly reveals that in the uncomplexed operators, substitution at position 3 in the context of either a 9T or 9C central sequence alters the cleavage patterns of these two DNAs. In both central sequence contexts, there is an increase in DNase I sensitivity around the site of substitution in the 3A-containing operators relative to the 3T-containing operators. These increases range from 2- to nearly 5-fold between operator positions 2 and 6. Interestingly, cleavage differences are observed several bases away from the site of substitution, some as far away as 13 bases. For example, the cleavage intensities observed at positions 7 and 14 of 3A-9T are both decreased by about 1.2-fold, relative to 3T-9T, and a 1.3-fold hypersensitivity is observed at positions 16 in the 3A-9T site. This is remarkable in that this position is 13 bases from the site of substitution (Fig. 4C). Highly reproducible long range differences are also observed when the two position 3-substituted 9C operators are compared, although these differences are more subtle than those in the 9T context. These data show that in both 9T and 9C central sequence contexts, base pair substitutions can have observable effects on the DNase I cleavage rates of bases distant from the actual site of substitution. This observation indicates that the conformation of the DNA phosphate backbone can be altered throughout the entire operator by a single base pair substitution. The above results establish that base pair substitutions have similar effects on the DNase I patterns of uncomplexed 9C and 9T operators. These results do not fully explain the dissimilar effects of base substitution on repressor affinity for operator in the two central sequence contexts. To address this question, we examined the DNase I cleavage patterns of these DNAs in complex with repressor. Inspection of Fig. 3, Fig. 4E shows that the DNase I cleavage pattern of the 3A-9C operator-repressor complex differs significantly from that of the 3T-9C operator-repressor complex. The observed differences are found within 6 bases of the site of substitution in the upstream contacted region. Most notably, the cleavage intensities of the bands at positions 3 and 5 in the 3A-9C complex are decreased by 1.5-fold and nearly 4-fold, respectively, relative to those of the 3T-9T operator-repressor complex. Conversely, cleavage at positions 2, 4, 6, and 9 increase by 1.5-, 2.5-, 1.5-, and 1.2-fold, respectively, in the 3A-9C complex as compared with the 3T-9C complex. Many of these changes, specifically those at positions 2 and 4, appear to mimic differences present in the unbound state (compare the unbound 3A-9C versus unbound 3T-9C in Fig. 4E). By comparison with the high degree of position 3-dependent structural variability observed in response to position 3 substitution in the 9C-containing operators, the cleavage patterns of the 3T-9T and 3A-9C operator repressor complexes are very similar (Fig. 4D). Some differences between these two repressor operator complexes are evident in Fig. 3. However, with the exception of position 4, these differences are much smaller than those seen in the complexes of repressor with the two position 3 variant 9C operators. These observations suggest that the structural variation between the various 9C-containing repressor-operator complexes is greater than that of the complexes formed between repressor and the two 9T-containing binding sites. Varying the sequence of non-contacted bases at the center of the P22 operator changes the affinity of this DNA for P22 repressor by altering the relative energetic contributions made by base sequence-specific (non-ionic) versus non-specific (ionic) interactions to the overall binding affinity. This central sequence-directed alteration in the relative importance of non-specific and specific contacts is visualized as a change in the ability of repressor to discriminate between base substitutions in the contacted region of the operator. Our data suggest that the changes in specificity are either due to differences in the static structure of the complexes formed between repressor and the central sequence variant operators or in the structural flexibility of these complexes. This assertion derives from two observations. First, the stability of a 9C operator-repressor complex decreases with an increase in salt concentration, while the strength of a 9T-containing repressor operator complex is relatively insensitive to changes in ionic concentration. This shows that ionic interactions have a larger role in stabilizing the 9C operator-repressor complex than they do in the 9T complex with repressor. Second, the affinity of 9C operator for repressor is virtually unaffected by changes in the contacted base sequence, while the affinity of the 9T operator is dramatically reduced. This indicates that in the context of a 9C central sequence, repressor forms weaker interactions with the contacted bases than it does in operators containing a 9T central sequence. Thus, sequences at the center of the P22 operator that decrease the affinity of operator for repressor increase the contributions of ionic interactions to overall binding energy at the expense of the specific protein-DNA interactions. The decrease in the importance of specific interactions appears to occur through an alteration in the geometry of the specific interactions, not through a loss in the number of specific contacts (see Table I). Insight into a mechanism for central base effects on contacted base specificity can be derived from analysis of the DNase I digestion patterns of various P22 repressor-operator complexes. An examination of the two 9T complexes by DNase I (Fig. 3, Fig. 4D) shows that their protection patterns are generally similar, despite differences in the identity of the base at position 3. Both of the 9T patterns are different from either of the two 9C-containing operator-repressor complexes. Moreover, the protection patterns of the two position 3 variants of the 9C complexes are distinct from each other. The cleavage differences between the 9C and 9T operator-repressor complexes represent a lessening in the degree of protection of 9C operator by repressor, relative to the 9T operator. Together, these observations suggest that the 9T central sequence facilitates a more intimate association between protein and DNA. This is reflected in the decreased structural variation in response to contacted base substitution in the 9T operator-repressor complexes when compared with the 9C-containing protein-DNA complexes. This interpretation is consistent with the results of the salt concentration dependence studies showing that the 9T complexes have stronger specific amino acid-base pair contacts than do the 9C operator-containing protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 2). The weaker contacts in the 9C operator-repressor complexes permit more structural freedom, allowing the repressor-operator complex to rearrange in response to loss of a specific contact, which is reflected in weaker protection from DNase I cleavage. Our current picture of how DNA sequence influences specific and non-specific base preferences of P22 repressor is that these base changes affect the structure of the P22 repressor-operator complex. An alternative view suggests that the sequence of the operator alters repressor's base preferences by influencing the structure of the unbound operator (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, A, C, and E). In this case, loss of specificity could be induced solely by changes in the structure of unbound DNA provided these structure changes are maintained in the repressor-operator complex. This view of the DNA sequence-induced loss of specificity implies that the operator is a static partner in the protein-DNA interaction. However, two lines of evidence suggest that the structure of DNA in the P22 repressor-operator interaction is dynamic, changing with both sequence and the presence of bound protein. First, DNase I analysis of the various repressor-operator complexes indicates that the structure of the repressor-bound operator differs from that of the unbound operator. The assertion that the solution configuration of the DNA changes upon repressor binding coincides with the previously reported repressor-induced alterations in operator twist (5Wu L. Koudelka G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18975-18981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the observed loss of specificity cannot be due purely to changes in unbound DNA structure because changes in the protein's primary sequence that should only affect contacted base specificity can also cause repressor to lose its ability to discriminate between base changes at the center of the operator (Table II). This result can only be explained by a model in which the DNA sequence-induced loss of specificity is attributed to sequence-dependent changes in the structure and/or dynamics of the P22 repressor-operator complex. The observation that the non-contacted base sequence at the center of the P22 operator globally influences specific protein-DNA contacts by altering the structure and/or dynamics of the complex represents a unique mechanism by which DNA sequence influences protein-DNA recognition. Our previous studies of the 434 repressor-operator complex showed that non-contacted bases affect affinity of DNA for protein by altering the structure of the unbound DNA, the deformability of the DNA, and the structure of the bound DNA, thus influencing the strength of non-specific contacts between protein and DNA (14Koudelka G.B. Harrison S.C. Ptashne M. Nature. 1987; 326: 886-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 15Koudelka G.B. Harbury P.H. Harrison S.C. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4633-4637Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 16Koudelka G.B. Carlson P. Nature. 1992; 355: 89-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Bell A.C. Koudelka G.B. J. Mol.

Hence, we are interested in the mechanism by which certain central base sequences are able to blind P22 repressor to alterations in the sequences of specifically contacted bases. As mentioned above, the strength of the 9T operator-repressor complexes are less affected by changes in ionic concentration than are the 9C complexes. A more extensive analysis of the salt dependence data supports this view. By extrapolating the salt dependence of KD data to 1 M salt concentration, we can calculate that in the context of a consensus contacted region, the non-charged interactions appear to contribute about 3 (± 0.2) kcal/mol less to the overall binding energy of the 9C operator-repressor complex than they do to the 9T operator-repressor complex. This is in agreement with previous data from our laboratory (4Wu L. Vertino A. Koudelka G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9134-9139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This analysis again supports the model that the non-charged interactions in 9C complexes are relatively less important than in those formed between repressor and operators bearing a 9T central sequence. More revealing is the alteration in the contribution of the non-charged interactions to the overall binding energy when a specifically contacted position is lost, for example at position 3. In the context of the 9T central sequence, non-charged interactions contribute nearly 2 (± 0.2) kcal/mol less to overall binding energy when the position 3 contact is lost. In contrast to this result, when the same contact is lost in the 9C central sequence context, only a modest 0.4 (± 0.05) kcal/mol loss is observed. Clearly the non-charged interactions, which include specific amino acid-base pair contacts, contribute much less to the overall energetics of binding in the 9C context leading to the apparent loss of specificity. From this finding we suggest that central sequence modulates P22 repressor's contacted base preferences by shifting the protein between two binding modes, a relatively “more specific” mode in which the protein is in more intimate contact with the bases and a “less specific” binding mode characterized by a closer association of the protein with the phosphate backbone rather than the bases. How can we assemble the observations presented here into a structural mechanism which explains the effects of DNA sequence on sequence-specific binding of P22 repressor? The lack of a high resolution structure of the complex prohibits us from precisely describing what kinds of three-dimensional alterations in the structure or dynamics of the DNA give rise to the difference in protection patterns seen in the footprints. Despite this limitation, a consideration of the data presented here combined with our previously published results provides some insights into this question. We have previously shown that the intrinsic twists of the 9T and 9C operators differ, with the unbound 9C operator being overtwisted as compared with the unbound 9T operator (5Wu L. Koudelka G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18975-18981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon binding, P22 repressor protein unwinds both operators to a similar extent, such that the complexed 9C operator remains overtwisted relative to the 9T operator by a similar extent as seen in the unbound operators. We suggest that as a result of these structural differences, an optimal alignment between functional groups on repressor amino acids and DNA bases does not take place in the 9C operator-repressor complexes. This is observed as both a loss in affinity and a loss of specificity. The inability of repressor to effectively engage the base pairs in the 9C operator leads to their de-emphasis in the overall energetics of binding, causing the phosphate contacts to become relatively more important. Thus, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the specific interactions are “looser” in the 9C complexes due to the lack of a tight fit between the protein and the DNA. The results presented here indicate that the strength of the interactions between P22 repressor and the contacted bases in the P22 operator are strongly influenced by the sequence of bases not directly in contact with the protein. One question which remains at issue is why this mechanism for modulating DNA sequence-specific binding has evolved in this system. One possible answer to this question emerges upon consideration of the sequences of the naturally occurring P22 operators, their relative affinities for P22 repressor, and repressor's function in the lysis-lysogeny decision. In the phage, repressor helps establish and maintain the lysogenic state by binding to OR1 and via cooperativity to OR2 at the identical concentration, despite OR2's 30-fold lower intrinsic affinity. In a lysogen, binding to OR3 at still higher concentrations is required for proper regulation of repressor levels. Thus, the precise matching of the relative affinities of OR1, OR2, and OR3 is critical to the phage's life cycle decisions. We speculate that the non-contacted central sequence regulation of contacted base recognition serves to protect the phage from mutations in the contacted bases. This idea is supported by the observation that four of the six operators on the phage chromosome contain a C:G base pair at one of their two central positions (Fig. 1). It is these same four operators that repressor must always occupy in fulfilling its role in establishing and maintaining lysogeny. The data reported here constitute the second, and more dramatic, discovery of non-contacted bases influencing the contacted base preferences of a DNA-binding protein. This phenomenon was first reported by our laboratory in our studies of the 434 repressor-operator interaction (19Bell A.C. Koudelka G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1205-1212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We speculate that these 434 and P22 proteins may not be unique in having their base-specific contacts influenced by non-contacted bases. If non-contacted bases do commonly influence contacted base preferences, this would help to explain the poorly defined consensus sequences of several proteins which nonetheless bind DNA with high specificity (20Segall A.M. Goodman S.D. Nash H.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4536-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The effect of non-contacted bases on contacted base preference is especially problematic when the non-contacted bases exert their effects on non-adjacent bases as is true in the P22 repressor binding sites. These “long distance” effects mask the relevance of non-contacted bases in consensus protein binding sites. Thus, the implications of these consensus sequences should be interpreted with caution."
