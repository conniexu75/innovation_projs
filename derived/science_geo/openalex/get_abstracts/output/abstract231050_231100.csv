https://openalex.org/W2036008499,"Metastasis is a multistep process during which cancer cells disseminate from the site of primary tumors and establish secondary tumors in distant organs. In a search for key regulators of metastasis in a murine breast tumor model, we have found that the transcription factor Twist, a master regulator of embryonic morphogenesis, plays an essential role in metastasis. Suppression of Twist expression in highly metastatic mammary carcinoma cells specifically inhibits their ability to metastasize from the mammary gland to the lung. Ectopic expression of Twist results in loss of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, activation of mesenchymal markers, and induction of cell motility, suggesting that Twist contributes to metastasis by promoting an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In human breast cancers, high level of Twist expression is correlated with invasive lobular carcinoma, a highly infiltrating tumor type associated with loss of E-cadherin expression. These results establish a mechanistic link between Twist, EMT, and tumor metastasis."

https://openalex.org/W2044501583,"Drosophila taste compounds with gustatory neurons on many parts of the body, suggesting that a fly detects both the location and quality of a food source. For example, activation of taste neurons on the legs causes proboscis extension or retraction, whereas activation of proboscis taste neurons causes food ingestion or rejection. We examined whether the features of taste location and taste quality are mapped in the fly brain using molecular, genetic, and behavioral approaches. We find that projections are segregated by the category of tastes that they recognize: neurons that recognize sugars project to a region different from those recognizing noxious substances. Transgenic axon labeling experiments also demonstrate that gustatory projections are segregated based on their location in the periphery. These studies reveal the gustatory map in the first relay of the fly brain and demonstrate that taste quality and position are represented in anatomical projection patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2078477504,"Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity initiates the eukaryotic cell division cycle by turning on a suite of gene expression in late G1 phase. In metazoans, CDK-dependent phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb) alleviates repression of E2F and thereby activates G1/S transcription. However, in yeast, an analogous G1 phase target of CDK activity has remained elusive. Here we show that the cell size regulator Whi5 inhibits G1/S transcription and that this inhibition is relieved by CDK-mediated phosphorylation. Deletion of WHI5 bypasses the requirement for upstream activators of the G1/S transcription factors SBF/MBF and thereby accelerates the G1/S transition. Whi5 is recruited to G1/S promoter elements via its interaction with SBF/MBF in vivo and in vitro. In late G1 phase, CDK-dependent phosphorylation dissociates Whi5 from SBF and drives Whi5 out of the nucleus. Elimination of CDK activity at the end of mitosis allows Whi5 to reenter the nucleus to again repress G1/S transcription. These findings harmonize G1/S control in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1967835627,"B-RAF is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that is mutated in approximately 70% of human melanomas. However, the role of this signalling molecule in cancer is unclear. Here, we show that ERK is constitutively activated in melanoma cells expressing oncogenic B-RAF and that this activity is required for proliferation. B-RAF depletion by siRNA blocks ERK activity, whereas A-RAF and C-RAF depletion do not affect ERK signalling. B-RAF depletion inhibits DNA synthesis and induces apoptosis in three melanoma cell lines and we show that the RAF inhibitor BAY43-9006 also blocks ERK activity, inhibits DNA synthesis and induces cell death in these cells. BAY43-9006 targets B-RAF signalling in vivo and induces a substantial growth delay in melanoma tumour xenografts. Our data demonstrate that oncogenic B-RAF activates ERK signalling, induces proliferation and protects cells from apoptosis, demonstrating that it is an important therapeutic target and thus provides novel strategies for clinical management of melanoma and other cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1965581435,"Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is a transcription factor that plays an essential role in development. However, the full spectrum of YY1's functions and mechanism of action remains unclear. We find that YY1 ablation results in p53 accumulation due to a reduction of p53 ubiquitination in vivo. Conversely, YY1 overexpression stimulates p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Significantly, recombinant YY1 is sufficient to induce Hdm2-mediated p53 polyubiquitination in vitro, suggesting that this function of YY1 is independent of its transcriptional activity. We identify direct physical interactions of YY1 with Hdm2 and p53 and show that the basis for YY1-regulating p53 ubiquitination is its ability to facilitate Hdm2-p53 interaction. Importantly, the tumor suppressor p14ARF compromises the Hdm2-YY1 interaction, which is important for YY1 regulation of p53. Taken together, these findings identify YY1 as a potential cofactor for Hdm2 in the regulation of p53 homeostasis and suggest a possible role for YY1 in tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1968109047,"Activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway may contribute to tumorigenesis. AKT mediates survival signals that protect cells from apoptosis and, thus, is a potentially important therapeutic target. To determine the frequency of AKT activation in human ovarian cancer, we screened a tumor tissue microarray with a phospho-specific pan-AKT (Ser473) antibody, which revealed elevated staining in 21 of 31 (68%) ovarian carcinomas. Phospho-AKT staining was associated with that of phospho (active)-mTOR in 27 of 31 (87%) ovarian tumors, with 17 (55%) tumors showing elevated phospho-mTOR positivity. We tested the effects of AKT/mTOR activation on the therapeutic sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells. Pretreatment of SKOV3 cells, which exhibit constitutive AKT activity under low serum conditions, with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 augmented cisplatin-induced apoptosis. In contrast, ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR4 and OVCAR5, which have low basal levels of AKT activity, did not show increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis when pretreated with LY294002. In addition, inhibition of mTOR activity with rapamycin resulted in G1 arrest in SKOV3 cells, but not in OVCAR4 or OVCAR5 cells. Collectively, these findings indicate that active AKT and downstream mTOR represent potentially important therapeutic and/or chemopreventive targets in ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2015038174,"G1-specific transcriptional activation by Cln3/CDK initiates the budding yeast cell cycle. To identify targets of Cln3/CDK, we analyzed the SBF and MBF transcription factor complexes by multidimensional protein interaction technology (MudPIT). Whi5 was identified as a stably bound component of SBF but not MBF. Inactivation of Whi5 leads to premature expression of G1-specific genes and budding, whereas overexpression retards those processes. Whi5 inactivation bypasses the requirement for Cln3 both for transcriptional activation and cell cycle initiation. Whi5 associates with G1-specific promoters via SBF during early G1 phase, then dissociates coincident with transcriptional activation. Dissociation of Whi5 is promoted by Cln3 in vivo. Cln/CDK phosphorylation of Whi5 in vitro promotes its dissociation from SBF complexes. Mutation of putative CDK phosphorylation sites, at least five of which are phosphorylated in vivo, strongly reduces SBF-dependent transcription and delays cell cycle initiation. Like mammalian Rb, Whi5 is a G1-specific transcriptional repressor antagonized by CDK."
https://openalex.org/W2056354361,"A range of genetical and physiological experiments have established that diverse bacterial cells possess a function called nucleoid occlusion, which acts to prevent cell division in the vicinity of the nucleoid. We have identified a specific effector of nucleoid occlusion in Bacillus subtilis, Noc (YyaA), as an inhibitor of division that is also a nonspecific DNA binding protein. Under various conditions in which the cell cycle is perturbed, Noc prevents the division machinery from assembling in the vicinity of the nucleoid. Unexpectedly, cells lacking both Noc and the Min system (which prevents division close to the cell poles) are blocked for division, apparently because they establish multiple nonproductive accumulations of division proteins. The results help to explain how B. subtilis specifies the division site under a range of conditions and how it avoids catastrophic breakage of the chromosome by division through the nucleoid."

https://openalex.org/W1974058909,"Little is known about the genes that regulate telomere length diversity between mammalian species. A candidate gene locus was previously mapped to a region on distal mouse Chr 2q. Within this region, we identified a gene similar to the dog-1 DNA helicase-like gene in C. elegans. We cloned this Regulator of telomere length (Rtel) gene and inactivated its expression in mice. Rtel(-/-) mice died between days 10 and 11.5 of gestation with defects in the nervous system, heart, vasculature, and extraembryonic tissues. Rtel(-/-) embryonic stem cells showed telomere loss and displayed many chromosome breaks and fusions upon differentiation in vitro. Crosses of Rtel(+/-) mice with Mus spretus showed that Rtel from the Mus musculus parent is required for telomere elongation of M. spretus chromosomes in F1 cells. We conclude that Rtel is an essential gene that regulates telomere length and prevents genetic instability."

APOBEC3G deaminates deoxycytidines in minus strand DNA to deoxyuridines, resulting in G to A hypermutation and viral inactivation. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virion infectivity factor counteracts the antiviral activity of APOBEC3G by inducing its proteosomal degradation and preventing virion incorporation. To elucidate the mechanism of viral suppression by APOBEC3G, we developed a sensitive cytidine deamination assay and analyzed APOBEC3G virion incorporation in a series of HIV-1 deletion mutants. Virus-like particles derived from constructs in which pol, env, and most of gag were deleted still contained high levels of cytidine deaminase activity; in addition, coimmunoprecipitation of APOBEC3G and HIV-1 Gag in the presence and absence of RNase A indicated that the two proteins do not interact directly but form an RNase-sensitive complex. Viral particles lacking HIV-1 genomic RNA which were generated from the gag-pol expression constructs pC-Help and pSYNGP packaged APOBEC3G at 30–40% of the wild-type level, indicating that interactions with viral RNA are not necessary for incorporation. In addition, viral particles produced from an nucleocapsid zinc finger mutant contained ∼1% of the viral genomic RNA but ∼30% of the cytidine deaminase activity. The reduction in APOBEC3G incorporation was equivalent to the reduction in the total RNA present in the nucleocapsid mutant virions. These results indicate that interactions with viral proteins or viral genomic RNA are not essential for APOBEC3G incorporation and suggest that APOBEC3G interactions with viral and nonviral RNAs that are packaged into viral particles are sufficient for APOBEC3G virion incorporation.

Because this high rate of G to A substitution (∼2 mutations/100 nucleotides) is 1,000-fold greater than the rate of substitutions that arise during normal error-prone viral replication (∼2 × 10-5 mutations/nucleotides/replication), it is named hypermutation (1Pathak V.K.

APOBEC3G must be packaged into virions to exhibit antiviral activity because its expression in target cells does not result in hypermutation or inhibition of viral replication.

The mechanism by which APOBEC3G is incorporated into HIV-1 virions as well as other diverse retroviruses such as simian immunodeficiency virus, murine leukemia virus, and equine infectious anemia virus is unknown (4Mangeat B. Turelli P. Caron G. Friedli M. Perrin L. Trono D. Nature. 2003; 424: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar, 6Harris R.S. Bishop K.N. Sheehy A.M. Craig H.M. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Watt I.N.

Nymark-McMahon H. Landau N.R. Cell. 2003; 114: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). The proteins and RNA components of these viruses share few common determinants that could be exploited by APOBEC3G to gain entry into viral particles. Furthermore, the high evolutionary potential of HIV-1 and other retroviruses should allow them to modify potential binding determinants quickly to prevent APOBEC3G incorporation. Instead, retroviruses have evolved the elaborate mechanism of encoding Vif to induce the proteosomal degradation of APOBEC3G. On the other hand, some protein determinants, such as the YXDD catalytic domain of reverse transcriptases or the zinc finger motifs of NC proteins, are highly conserved in the orthoretroviruses and are essential for retroviral replication. Thus, these elements could potentially provide binding interactions that allow incorporation of APOBEC3G. We have now developed a novel cytidine deaminase assay to determine APOBEC3G activity in virions. Deletion analysis of HIV-1 gag-pol expression constructs and their RNA content indicates that APOBEC3G incorporation does not require a specific interaction with viral proteins or viral RNA. The results suggest that APOBEC3G is associated with viral and cellular RNAs that are specifically and nonspecifically packaged into HIV-1 virions, respectively.

The total protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and 1.5 μg of total cytoplasmic protein was used to determine cytidine deamination activity. Scintillation Proximity Assay for Cytidine Deamination—The sequence of the primer oligonucleotide was 5′-biotin-GTCAGCATCCTGAATTCTACC-3′. The sequence of the template oligonucleotide (CCCA)10 was 5′-ACCCACCCACCCACCCACCCACCCACCCACCCACCCACCCGGTAGAATTCAGGATGCTGAC-3′. The biotinylated primer and (CCCA)10 template oligonucleotides were annealed to each other and immobilized on streptavidin-polyvinyltoluene SPA beads (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturer. The cytidine deamination reaction was performed in a final volume of 100 μl for 2 h (unless otherwise specified) at 37 °C in the presence of the (CCCA)10 SPA beads in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 80 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.05% (w/v) Nonidet P-40). The polymerization reaction was performed in 0.04 mm each dTTP and dGTP, 1 μCi of [3H]dATP (specific activity, 20–50 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), and 0.2 unit of Klenow (Roche Applied Science) for 20 min and stopped by the addition 200 μl of EDTA (120 mm, pH 8.0). The reaction products were diluted to 3 ml with 1× Tris borate-EDTA buffer, and the incorporation of tritiated deoxynucleotides was quantified using the Tricarb 1600TR (Packard) liquid scintillation analyzer. A parallel reaction was performed for each sample in the presence of dATP and dGTP (final concentration, 0.04 mm) and 1 μCi of [3H]dTTP (specific activity, 40–80 Ci/mmol; ICN) to control for polymerization efficiency. In addition, a (UUUA)10 oligonucleotide template, which was identical to the (CCCA)10 template except that the deoxycytidines were replaced with deoxyuridines, was used in polymerization reactions, and the resulting incorporation of [3H]dATP was referred to as 100% APO activity. Sequences of (CCA)13 and (CCCCA)8 template oligonucleotides were similar to the (CCCA)10 template and contained the indicated sequences that were repeated 13 or 8 times, respectively. To calculate APO activity for these templates, normalization to a 100% activity was adjusted according to the number of deoxycytidines in each template oligonucleotide. RNA Isolation and Quantification—To quantify the HIV-1 viral RNA content of the HIV-Thy wild-type and CCHH mutant virions, total RNA was isolated as described previously (30Fu W. Hu W.S. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 μl of concentrated VLPs in PBS were treated with 15 units of RNase-free DNase I (Roche Applied Science) for 40 min in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2. After the addition of 500 μl of TBS (Tris-buffered saline; 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl), the VLPs were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, resuspended in 50 μl of RNase-free water and 3 μl of 20 mg/ml proteinase K (Invitrogen), and incubated at 55 °C for 30 min. Next, 200 μl of 5.8 m guanidinium isothiocyanate and 10 μl of 20 mg/ml glycogen were added and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. RNA samples were precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, centrifuged for 30 min at 21,000 × g, and the RNA pellets were dissolved in RNase-free water. Quantification of total RNA from VLPs was performed using the Ribogreen Quantification Kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Quantification of HIV-1 RNA in VLPs was performed using reverse transcriptase-real time PCR as described previously (28Gorelick R.J. Gagliardi T.D. Bosche W.J. Wiltrout T.A. Coren L.V. Chabot D.J. Lifson J.D. Henderson L.E. Arthur L.O. Virology. 1999; 256: 92-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA synthesis was performed using random primers, and real time PCR was carried out in the presence of the U5-Ψ primer-probe set of HIV-1 (29Svarovskaia E.S. Barr R. Zhang X. Pais G.C. Marchand C. Pommier Y. Burke Jr., T.R. Pathak V.K. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3210-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Staining of Transfected Cells—293T cells were cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated 12-mm-diameter coverslips (BD Biosciences) for 24 h prior to transfection. At 8 h post-transfection, cells were fixed for 20 min at room temperature in 5% paraformadehyde and 2% sucrose in PBS and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 and 10% sucrose in PBS for 30 min. We used anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody clone 9E10 (Sigma) as primary antibody and Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat antibody to mouse IgG(H+L) (Molecular Probes) as secondary fluorescent antibody. Cells were incubated sequentially with each antibody for 1 h and washed three times. All washes and antibody dilutions were done in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma), and 2% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Finally, the nuclei were stained by incubating the cells in PBS containing 2 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyl-indole (DAPI) (Sigma) for 2 min followed by two washes in PBS. The coverslips were rinsed in deionized water and then mounted on glass slides by using FluoroGuard (Bio-Rad). Cells were visualized using a LSM510 Zeiss confocal fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). Coimmunoprecipitation Analysis—An anti-c-Myc antibody (Sigma) was coupled to paramagnetic beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dynal Biotech). 293T cells were cotransfected with APOBEC3G and pGag; pGag expressed HIV-1 Gag that possessed a FLAG tag epitope at its C terminus. Approximately 36 h after transfection, 4 × 106 cells were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in 2 ml of cell extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaVO3, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The cell extracts were centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 4 min, and the supernatant was divided equally into two samples; 100 μg of RNase A (Sigma) was added to one sample, and 100 units of RNaseOUT (Invitrogen) was added to the other sample. The samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature and subsequently incubated with anti-c-Myc antibody-conjugated paramagnetic beads for 3 h in slow rotation on RKDynal rotor (Dynal Biotech) at 4 °C. After incubation, the paramagnetic beads were washed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm LiCl, 1 mm NaVO3, and 0.5% Triton X-100, three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm LiCl, 1 mm NaVO3, and once with 1 mm NaVO3. The bound proteins were eluted from the beads by heating to 90 °C for 5 min in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of APOBEC3G using the anti-c-Myc antibody and Gag using an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Western Blotting Analysis—293T cells were transfected with 20 μgof pHDV-EGFP, 8 μg of pcDNA-APO3G, and 8 μg of pcDNA3.1-eIF3k-c-Myc (kindly provided by John W. B. Hershey) (31Mayeur G.L. Fraser C.S. Peiretti F. Block K.L. Hershey J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4133-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The virus-producing cells and the VLPs were harvested 36 h later, lysed in 1 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer, denatured at 96 °C for 10 min, and analyzed using anti-c-Myc antibody (Sigma) by Western blotting as described previously (13Xu H. Svarovskaia E.S. Barr R. Zhang Y. Khan M.A. Strebel K. Pathak V.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5652-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To gain insights into the mechanism by which APOBEC3G is incorporated into retroviral particles, we developed a sensitive and quantitative cytidine deamination assay using scintillation proximity beads (Fig. 1A). Briefly, an oligonucleotide primer containing a 5′-biotinylated deoxynucleotide is hybridized to a template oligonucleotide containing deoxycytidines and deoxyadenines (e.g. (CCCA)10) and attached to scintillation proximity beads. The template-primer complex is incubated with HIV-1 VLPs containing APOBEC3G for 1–6 h at 37 °C. Next, the primer is extended using Klenow fragment in the presence of either a [3H]dATP, dGTP, and dTTP mixture or a [3H]dTTP, dGTP, and dATP mixture. [3H]dATP is incorporated into the nascent DNA only upon conversion of deoxycytidines to deoxyuridines, providing a measure of the cytidine deamination activity. To control for efficiency of Klenow fragment-mediated DNA synthesis, incorporation of [3H]dTTP is also determined. Incorporation of [3H]dATP or [3H]dTTP in the extended primer brings the radiolabeled nucleotide in close proximity to the scintillation bead, resulting in a signal that can easily be quantified. An additional positive control reaction is performed in parallel using a (UUUA)10 template to determine the maximal [3H]dATP incorporation level, which was set to 100% and referred to as APO activity. The APO activity for experimental samples is expressed as a percentage of the [3H]dATP incorporation relative to the (UUUA)10 template. To determine whether APOBEC3G and cytidine deamination activity is present in cell culture supernatants in the absence of HIV-1 proteins, we transfected 293T cells with pcDNA-APO3G plasmid and determined whether the culture supernatants contained cytidine deamination activity (Fig. 1B). A very low level of cytidine deamination activity (<2%) was detected, indicating that APOBEC3G release from 293T cells required HIV-1 proteins. To determine whether other cytidine deaminases expressed in 293T cells contributed to the cytidine deamination activity, we transfected 293T cells with an HIV-1 gag-pol expression construct, isolated VLPs from culture supernatants, and determined cytidine deamination activity. In the absence of transfected APOBEC3G plasmid, very low levels of cytidine deamination activity were detected (<1%), indicating that cytidine deaminases expressed from 293T cells did not contribute significantly to the observed cytidine deamination activity. To determine which template sequences provided an optimal substrate for cytidine deamination, we compared the cytidine deamination activity after transfections with an HIV-1 gag-pol expression construct and an APOBEC3G expression plasmid on (CCA)13, (CCCA)10, and (CCCCA)8 templates (Fig. 1B). The results indicated that the (CCCA)10 template was the most efficient substrate for detection of cytidine deaminase activity; therefore, this template was used in all subsequent experiments. Next, we determined how the quantity of VLPs and time of incubation of template with APOBEC3G correlated with the observed cytidine deamination activity (Fig. 1C). VLPs produced from cells transfected with HIV-1 gag-pol and APOBEC3G expression constructs were quantified by determining the amount of p24 CA levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; 0–45 ng of p24 CA associated with VLPs was incubated with the (CCCA)10 template-primer complex for 1, 2, and 6 h, and the extent of cytidine deamination was determined. The results indicated that the cytidine deamination activity increased as the amounts of CA associated with VLPs or time of incubation increased and leveled off at either high VLP input or longer incubation times (e.g. 12 ng of p24 CA for 6 h or 24 ng of p24 CA for 2 h). The data indicated that ∼6 ng of p24 CA associated with VLPs for 2 h resulted in ∼30% APO activity, which was within the linear range of detection. Therefore, APOBEC3G activities were determined for ≤6 ng of p24 CA associated with VLPs for 2 h in subsequent experiments. To determine whether APOBEC3G is packaged into HIV-1 VLPs specifically or nonspecifically, we compared the intracellular distribution and relative efficiencies of virion incorporation of APOBEC3G and cytoplasmic translational initiation factor 3 subunit k (eIF3k) (31Mayeur G.L. Fraser C.S. Peiretti F. Block K.L. Hershey J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4133-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To compare the intracellular distributions of APOBEC3G and eIF3k, the plasmids that express each protein were transfected into 293T cells; the transfected cells were stained with an anti-c-Myc tag antibody and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2A). The results indicated that both APOBEC3G and eIF3k appeared to be distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the transfected cells. To compa"
https://openalex.org/W2051062800,"Reduced ligand binding activity of alpha-dystroglycan is associated with muscle and central nervous system pathogenesis in a growing number of muscular dystrophies. Posttranslational processing of alpha-dystroglycan is generally accepted to be critical for the expression of functional dystroglycan. Here we show that both the N-terminal domain and a portion of the mucin-like domain of alpha-dystroglycan are essential for high-affinity laminin-receptor function. Posttranslational modification of alpha-dystroglycan by glycosyltransferase, LARGE, occurs within the mucin-like domain, but the N-terminal domain interacts with LARGE, defining an intracellular enzyme-substrate recognition motif necessary to initiate functional glycosylation. Gene replacement in dystroglycan-deficient muscle demonstrates that the dystroglycan C-terminal domain is sufficient only for dystrophin-glycoprotein complex assembly, but to prevent muscle degeneration the expression of a functional dystroglycan through LARGE recognition and glycosylation is required. Therefore, molecular recognition of dystroglycan by LARGE is a key determinant in the biosynthetic pathway to produce mature and functional dystroglycan."
https://openalex.org/W2070649129,"Nucleotides within the airway surface liquid (ASL) regulate airway epithelial ion transport rates by Ca2+ -and protein kinase C-dependent mechanisms via activation of specific P2Y receptors. Extracellular adenine nucleotides also serve as precursors for adenosine, which promotes cyclic AMP-mediated activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator chloride channel via A2b adenosine receptors. A biological role for extracellular ATP in ASL volume homeostasis has been suggested by the demonstration of regulated ATP release from airway epithelia. However, nucleotide hydrolysis at the airway surface makes it difficult to assess the magnitude of ATP release and the relative abundance of adenyl purines and, hence, to define their biological functions. We have combined ASL microsampling and high performance liquid chromatography analysis of fluorescent 1,N6-ethenoadenine derivatives to measure adenyl purines in ASL. We found that adenosine, AMP, and ADP accumulated in high concentrations relative to ATP within the ASL covering polarized primary human normal or cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells. By using immortalized epithelial cell monolndogenayers that eously express a luminal A2b adenosine receptor, we found that basal as well asforskolin-promoted cyclic AMP production was reduced by exogenous adenosine deaminase, suggesting that A2b receptors sense endogenous adenosine within the ASL. The physiological role of adenosine was further established by illustrating that adenosine removal or inhibition of adenosine receptors in primary cultures impaired ASL volume regulation. Our data reveal a complex pattern of nucleotides/nucleosides in ASL under resting conditions and suggest that adenosine may play a key role in regulating ASL volume homeostasis.

Airways continuously remove noxious materials through a mucus clearance process that requires a complex regulation of airway surface liquid (ASL) 1The abbreviations used are: ASL, airway surface liquid; MCC, mucociliary clearance; CF, cystic fibrosis; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ϵ, etheno; ADO, adenosine; HNE, human nasal epithelial cells; HBE, human bronchial epithelial; 8-SPT, 8-(-sulfophenyl)theophylline; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: ASL, airway surface liquid; MCC, mucociliary clearance; CF, cystic fibrosis; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ϵ, etheno; ADO, adenosine; HNE, human nasal epithelial cells; HBE, human bronchial epithelial; 8-SPT, 8-(-sulfophenyl)theophylline; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid. volume by active ion transport and coordinated ciliary beating. In normal airways, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein mediates liquid balance on airway surfaces by regulating Na+ absorption and by acting as a cyclic AMP-regulated Cl– channel. Proper regulation of salt and water movement across epithelial cell surfaces is required in both ASL compartments: (i) sufficient volume in the periciliary liquid ensures efficient cilia movement; and (ii) sufficient volume optimizes the viscoelastic properties of the mucus layer for transport (1Knowles M.R. Boucher R.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Defective CFTR activity causes the syndrome of cystic fibrosis (CF), which is characterized by accelerated Na+-dependent volume absorption and failure to secrete Cl–, leading to ASL volume depletion (2Boucher R.C. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2002; 54: 1359-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). An alternative Ca2+-regulated Cl– channel that is functional in CF airway epithelial cells is also present on the mucosal surface but is relatively inactive in nonstimulated cells (3Gabriel S.E. Fuller C.M. Current Topics in Membranes: Calcium-activated Chloride Channels. Academic Press, San Diego2002: 193-207Google Scholar). The expression of purinergic receptors in airway epithelia that couple via different mechanisms to salt (and water) transport suggests a role of purinergic agonists in the autocrine regulation of ASL volume and mucociliary clearance (MCC). Indeed, the accumulation of physiologically active concentrations of ATP in human airway secretions in vivo (4Donaldson S.H. Lazarowski E.R. Picher M. Knowles M.R. Stutts M.J. Boucher R.C. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 969-982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the recognition that airway epithelial cells release ATP constitutively in vitro (4Donaldson S.H. Lazarowski E.R. Picher M. Knowles M.R. Stutts M.J. Boucher R.C. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 969-982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol.

Res. 2001; 53: 66-71Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) suggest that release and metabolism of nucleotides may control the basal activity of ion transport and, hence, ASL volume homeostasis. Functional data suggest that ATP mediates acute responses via P2Y2 receptor stimulation (7Homolya L. Steinberg A.D. Boucher R.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1349-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 8Paradiso A.M. Ribeiro C.M.P. Boucher R.C. Pediatr. Pulmonol. 2001; 22: 210Google Scholar), and that ATP metabolism provides a source of adenosine for stimulation of the A2b adenosine receptor (9Huang P.B. Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Milgram S.L. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14120-14125Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, because of the continuous metabolic interconversion and removal of purinergic molecules, it has not been possible to predict the relative concentrations of agonists for the various purinergic receptors in airway epithelia and hence predict the relative contribution of the A2b and P2Y receptors to the control of ASL volume and MCC. By adopting the chloroacetaldehyde derivatization technique for the ethenylation of adenyl purines (10Levitt B. Head R.J. Westfall D.P. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we sought to measure the concentration of adenine nucleotides and adenosine in ASL. We utilized two cell models with complementary features to address the issues of polarity of ATP release and feedback of purine nucleotides in cell signaling. By using well differentiated primary human airway epithelia as a model of the multilayered epithelia in vivo, we asked whether ASL volume regulation is controlled by ASL adenosine concentration in an autocrine fashion and whether the levels of adenyl purines in ASL were dependent on CFTR expression. By using Calu-3 cells as a model of a polarized epithelial monolayer, we asked whether cell surface domains are specialized for purine nucleotide release, whether ASL adenosine levels autocrinely control cellular cyclic AMP levels, and whether cyclic AMP production, and hence CFTR activation, promotes purine nucleotide release. Cell Cultures and Incubations—Primary human nasal epithelial (HNE) and human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cultures from CF or non-CF subjects (provided by the University of North Carolina Cystic Fibrosis Center Tissue Culture Core Lab) were grown on 12-mm Transwell-Col (Costar, Cambridge, MA) supports under air-liquid conditions and studied (at 3–5 weeks) as fully differentiated stratified cultures, as described previously (11Matsui H. Davis C.W. Tarran R. Boucher R.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1419-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Human Calu-3 airway epithelial cells were grown as polarized monolayers, as described previously (9Huang P.B. Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Milgram S.L. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14120-14125Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Cultures were washed three times with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, followed by the addition to the luminal surface of either 300 or 25 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) for standard sampling and microsampling procedures (see below), respectively. At the indicated times, aliquots were removed, boiled for 2 min, and either processed immediately for nucleotide analysis or stored at –20 °C. All incubations were at 37 °C in a humidified incubator supplemented with 5% CO2. For intracellular determinations, the cells were rinsed and subsequently lysed with 0.3 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, and trichloroacetic acid was extracted three times with 2 ml of ethyl ether. Microsampling—A microscope-mounted micromanipulator (Southern Micro Instruments, Fostec Inc., Auburn, NY) was used to apply the tip of a 1.2-mm capillary glass tube (World Precision Instruments Inc., Sarasota, FL) to the meniscus of the ∼20-μm depth of luminal surface liquid, as described previously (12Matsui H. Grubb B.R. Tarran R. Randell S.H. Gatzy J.T. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). A single aliquot of 5–10 μl was removed from each culture and processed as detailed below. Luciferin-Luciferase Assay—This assay has been described previously in detail (5Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31061-31068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Typically, a 5–10-μl sample was added to a test tube, and the volume was adjusted to 300 μl with HPLC-grade H2O. The luciferin-luciferase reaction mix (100 μl) was added to tubes with a built-in injector into the light-protected chamber of an Auto-Lumat LB953 luminometer. Luminescence was subsequently recorded over 10 s and compared against an ATP standard curve performed in parallel. Luminescence was linear (slope = 1) between 0.1 and 1000 nm ATP. Derivatization of Adenosine and Adenine Nucleotides—We have adopted and slightly modified the derivatization protocol originally described by Levitt et al. (10Levitt B. Head R.J. Westfall D.P. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), according to conditions delineated experimentally as described under “Results.” In a typical derivatization assay, aliquots of either 150 μl from standard incubations or 20–40 μl from pooled microsamples were incubated for 30 min at 72 °C in the presence of 1.0 m chloroacetaldehyde and 25 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 4.0) in a final volume of 200 μl. Samples were transferred to ice, alkalinized with 50 μl of 0.5 m NH4HCO3, and analyzed by HPLC within 24 h. Up to 40 samples were processed in a single assay. HPLC Analysis—Identification and quantification of ethenylated species were performed with an automated Waters HPLC apparatus equipped with a fluorescence detector. Derivatized samples were transferred to 0.7-ml plastic vials (Sun-SRi, Duluth, GA) and kept at 4 °C in the sample injector rack. A 100-μl sample aliquot was injected into a 250-mm, 10-μm Hamilton PRP-X100 anion exchange column. The mobile phase (2 ml/min, 30% methanol) developed linearly from 0.250 to 0.275 m NH4HCO3 (pH 8.5) during the first 8 min, remaining isocratic at 0.275 m NH4HCO3 for an additional 4 min. The column was subsequently rinsed for 3 min with 0.425 m NH4HCO3 in 30% methanol and re-equilibrated to the initial conditions for 15 min. Typical elution times (in minutes) of authentic etheno-standards are as follows: ϵ-ADO, 3.2; ϵ-AMP, 5.9; ϵ-ADP, 6.8; and ϵ-ATP, 8.4. For intracellular cyclic AMP measurements, separation of ϵ-cyclic AMP from ϵ-ATP was optimized by using a slightly modified mobile phase (30% methanol, 1.5 ml/min) developed from 0.20 to 0.25 m NH4HCO3 for 10 min and from 0.25 to 0.30 m NH4HCO3 over an additional 4 min. ϵ-ATP and ϵ-cyclic AMP eluted at 5.2 and 10.1 min, respectively. In experiments using radiochemicals, samples were separated and analyzed with a Shimadzu HPLC coupled on-line to a Packard Flo-One detector. ϵ-[3H]ATP was separated and analyzed with the ion exchange column under mobile phase conditions similar to those indicated above. Separation of [3H]adenosine from [3H]inosine and [γ-32P]ATP from 32P and 32i PPi were accomplished through the C18 column and mobile phase described previously (13Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Vanduffel L. Lemmens R. Ecto-ATPases and Related Ectonucleotidases. Shaker Publishing BV, Maastricht2000: 283-294Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy Measurement of ASL—Texas Red dextran (10 kDa, 2 mg/ml, Molecular Probes) was added in 20 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (± drugs) to the mucosal surface (1.13 cm2) of rinsed cultures. The excess volume was aspirated, and the cultures were kept undisturbed at 37 °C in a humidified incubator until microscopy analysis. At the times indicated (see Fig. 7), cultures were transferred to the stage of the confocal microscope over a serosal reservoir (80 μl of TES-buffered Ringer) (14Tarran R. Grubb B.R. Gatzy J.T.

Perfluorocarbon was added mucosally to prevent evaporation of the ASL during measurements, and cultures were subsequently X-Z scanned as described previously (14Tarran R. Grubb B.R. Gatzy J.T. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 15Tarran R. Boucher R.C. Methods Mol. Med. 2002; 70: 479-492PubMed Google Scholar). Reagents—[3H]Adenosine (20 Ci/mmol), [3H]ATP (41 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and molecular biology grade ATP were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. ADP, AMP, adenosine, cyclic AMP, and adenosine deaminase were obtained from Roche Applied Sciences. 8-(Sulfophenyl)theophylline (8-SPT), chloroacetaldehyde, and ϵ-adenyl standards were obtained from Sigma. Firefly luciferase and luciferin were purchased from Pharmingen. All other chemicals were of the highest purity available. Data Analysis—HPLC fluorescence was integrated and analyzed by using Millennium software (Waters). Data from test samples were compared against known concentrations of ATP, ADP, AMP, and adenosine, which were derivatized and analyzed in parallel. These controls were injected at the beginning and again at the end of each HPLC injection set to determine within-run precision (<3%). Flow-One Analysis software (Packard Instrument Co.) was used for analyzing the radioactive tracings. Differences between means were determined by unpaired Student's t test and were considered significant at p <0.05. Chloroacetaldehyde derivatization allows for the sensitive quantitation of adenyl purines as fluorescent 1,N6-etheno species (10Levitt B. Head R.J. Westfall D.P. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To identify and quantitate ATP and other adenyl purines within the ASL, we optimized the ethenylation reaction conditions by monitoring changes in radioactive and fluorescent species during the derivatization of 0.1 μCi of [3H]ATP (100 nm). Ethenylation of ATP was quantitatively completed within 30 min at 72 °C in the presence of 1 m chloroacetaldehyde, as indicated by the shift in elution times of radioactive species (Fig. 1A) that was paralleled by formation of fluorescent ϵ-ATP (Fig. 1B). Most importantly, conversion of [3H]ATP to ϵ-[3H]ATP and formation of fluorescent species occurred with negligible loss of radioactive material or ATP breakdown. The reaction either slowed at lower temperatures (∼70% completion after 45 min at 60 °C) or resulted in increased fluorescence background at 80 °C (data not shown). Under optimal conditions (72 °C for 30 min, 1 m chloroacetaldehyde), adenine-containing species could be resolved by ion exchange HPLC (see “Experimental Procedures”) and quantified to a sensitivity of 200 fmol (Fig. 1C). An HPLC tracing representative of a derivatization reaction performed in the presence of 100 nm adenosine, AMP, ADP, and ATP is shown in Fig. 1C (top). The linearity of the reaction as a function of ATP concentration is illustrated in Fig. 1C (middle), and similar calibration curves were obtained with adenosine (Fig. 1C, bottom) and with AMP, ADP, and cyclic AMP (data not shown). By having defined optimal derivatization conditions, we next examined the fluorescent pattern resulting from derivatization reactions performed with bulk solutions bathing the resting primary airway epithelial cells (“bulk” solutions were defined as those that have typically been used for nucleotide measurements, e.g. 300–500 μl (4Donaldson S.H. Lazarowski E.R. Picher M. Knowles M.R. Stutts M.J. Boucher R.C. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 969-982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31061-31068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), but are in great excess to those volumes that likely occur in vivo). Primary cultures of nasal epithelial cells from normal subjects were incubated for 3 h (after the addition of 300 μl of HBSS to the mucosal surface) to allow the cells to recover from culture manipulations that potentially result in ATP release (17Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). A 200-μl aliquot was gently removed from the mucosal bath and subjected to derivatization and HPLC analysis. A representative HPLC fluorescence chromatogram is illustrated in Fig. 2A (top tracing). Species co-eluting with authentic ϵ-adenosine, ϵ-AMP, ϵ-ADP, and ϵ-ATP were detected. To verify further the identity of the fluorescent species, samples were subjected to enzymatic treatment prior to derivatization. As expected, incubation with apyrase caused a marked depletion of species eluting as ϵ-ADP and ϵ-ATP, whereas incubation with hexokinase (18Lazarowski E.R. Paradiso A.M. Watt W.C. Harden T.K. Boucher R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2599-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) resulted in selective loss of the peak corresponding to ϵ-ATP and an increase of ϵ-ADP. Incubation of the samples with alkaline phosphatase eliminated or markedly attenuated the fluorescence eluting as ϵ-ATP, ϵ-ADP, and ϵ-AMP and increasing that of ϵ-adenosine. Adenosine deaminase selectively removed species eluting as ϵ-adenosine. Similar data were obtained with primary cultures of HBE cells (not shown) and with the Calu-3 airway epithelial cell line (9Huang P.B. Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Milgram S.L. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14120-14125Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Quantitative changes in fluorescence species after enzymatic treatment of HNE samples are summarized in Fig. 2B. These results confirm that the post-derivatization species detected in the extracellular medium of resting airway epithelial cells represent endogenous nucleotides and their nucleoside product adenosine. Fig. 3 summarizes measurements obtained with bulk samples from cultures of well differentiated primary nasal and bronchial epithelial cells. ATP concentrations in the 3–4 nm range were observed in the mucosal baths of control HNE and HBE cells, suggesting that these epithelia exhibit similar ratios of ATP release:breakdown on the luminal surface. The observation that ATP was the least abundant species (<2%) in HNE and HBE cells (Fig. 3) suggested that the ATP metabolism is efficiently coupled to ATP release on both cell types. However, and in agreement with recent studies (19Picher M. Burch L.H. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20234-20241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Picher M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 13468-13479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) indicating higher rates of hydrolysis of ATP, ADP, and AMP on bronchial cells relative to nasal cells, bronchial and nasal cells exhibited opposite nucleotide:adenosine accumulation ratios (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 also suggests that luminal purine accumulation is not impaired in CF cells. Results in Fig 3A, although not conclusive because of the small sample number of CF HNE cultures, are consistent with our previous measurements of ATP release rates and nucleotide accumulation on nasal cultures and in nasal secretions from CF patients (4Donaldson S.H. Lazarowski E.R. Picher M. Knowles M.R. Stutts M.J. Boucher R.C. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 969-982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Watt W.C. Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14053-14058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Moreover, comparative analysis of results from 18 to 22 HBE cultures from normal donors and CF patients also revealed essentially no difference in the total accumulation of mucosal purines (Fig. 3B). In addition, no difference in total accumulation of adenyl species was observed with HBE cells from patients with α-1 antitrypsin deficiency (Fig. 3B), suggesting that release of ATP to the lumen of the airway epithelia is not impaired in chronic airway inflammation. Variability among patient groups was observed at the level of individual species (Fig. 3B). For example, adenosine levels were lower and AMP levels higher on CF and α-1 antitrypsin cells relative to control cells, suggesting that ecto-5′-nucleotidase activity is expressed more robustly in normal cells. ATP levels were slightly higher in CF relative to control samples. Intracellular ATP levels were approximately the same between normal (32 ± 6 nmol/well) and CF bronchial cultures (34 ± 3 nmol/well) and represented >85% of the cellular adenyl purine pool, followed by ADP (12–14%) and AMP and adenosine (<2%, together). To examine further the kinetics of nucleotide and nucleoside accumulation, purine measurements were performed with samples collected bilaterally at various times from 2 to 180 min following a medium replacement on HNE and HBE cells (Fig. 4, A and B). As a complementary approach to address the sidedness of purine accumulation, measurements also were performed with Calu-3 cells (Fig. 4C), a CFTR-expressing epithelial cell line grown as a polarized monolayer (9Huang P.B. Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Milgram S.L. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14120-14125Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 22Cobb B.R. Fan L.J. Kovacs T.E.

Membr. Biol. 2003; 192: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Consistent with the extreme sensitivity of airway epithelia to shear-induced ATP release (4Donaldson S.H. Lazarowski E.R. Picher M. Knowles M.R. Stutts M.J. Boucher R.C. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 969-982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Drug Dev.

Physiol. 1997; 272: C1058-C1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a gentle medium change resulted in rapid mucosal ATP release by all three cell types. Furthermore, all three cell types achieved a concentration of 25–60 nm ATP within 2 min of challenge, which subsequently decayed within 30 min to lower but detectable (1–5 nm) levels that remained constant over the remainder of the 3-h incubation (Fig. 4, upper panels). The medium change-initiated ATP release was accompanied by robust accumulation of ADP, which was the predominant species (100–200 nm) at 2 min on all cell types. There were, however, features that distinguished these three cell types. In HNE cells, AMP levels reached a maximum after 30 min and remained >100 nm for up to 180 min. Adenosine reached a maximum (63 ± 19 nm) at 30 min but decayed to ∼50% of that value after 180 min (Fig. 4A, upper panel). On HBE and Calu-3 cells, adenosine was readily detected at 2 min and substantially increased until 180 min (Fig. 4, B and C, upper panels). With respect to the basolateral compartment, ATP, ADP, and adenosine concentrations in HNE cells during the 3-h incubation period were <30 nm, but AMP levels were robust at all time points (Fig. 4A, lower panel). In HBE cells, ADP, AMP, and adenosine were detected after 30 min, but ADP and adenosine slightly decreased thereafter, whereas AMP levels increased to up to ∼150 nm; little or no ATP was observed at all times (Fig. 4B, lower panel). Negligible accumulation of adenyl purines was detected in the basolateral solution of Calu-3 cells during the 3-h incubation period following a medium change (Fig. 4C, lower panel). Taken together, these results reveal a complex pattern of nucleotide release and accumulation in the bulk mucosal and basolateral solutions of airway epithelial cultures. These data confirm previous ATP measurements consistent with basal ATP release by resting epithelia (4Donaldson S.H. Lazarowski E.R. Picher M. Knowles M.R. Stutts M.J. Boucher R.C. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 969-982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31061-31068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and enhanced ATP release during mechanical stimulation of epithelia (4Donaldson S.H. Lazarowski E.R. Picher M. Knowles M.R. Stutts M.J. Boucher R.C. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 969-982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol.

The data also illustrate the efficiency and diversity of the nucleotide hydrolysis enzymes expressed on the epithelial cell surfaces, which converts ATP to AMP and ultimately to adenosine, and the data also suggest striking differences in nucleotide release in the basolateral compartments among the three epithelial cells. To investigate whether accelerated basolateral metabolism in Calu-3 cells could account for the absence of purines in this compartment, trace quantities of [γ-32P]ATP and [3H]adenosine were added to each surface, and the radioactivity present in the medium at various times was monitored by HPLC. Basolateral [γ-32P]ATP decay (t½ = 56 min) was >10-fold slower than mucosal [γ-32P]ATP decay (t½ = 4 min) (Fig. 4C, inset). [3H]Adenosine decayed at similar rates (t½ ∼60 min) on both surfaces of Calu-3 cells (Fig. 4C, inset). These results indicate that the absence of ϵ-purines in the basolateral bath of resting Calu-3 cell monolayers was not a consequence of faster basolateral clearance but rather reflected little or undetectable nucleotide release through the basolateral membrane. Bulk measurements may underestimate the nucleotide concentration in the physiologically relevant ASL volume (height). Because the height (∼7–50 μm) and hence volume of ASL normally bathing airway epithelial surfaces is small, and because airway epithelial cells are extremely sensitive to luminal stress, a major problem in measuring the concentrations of nucleotides in “small” ASL volumes that mimic those in vivo is to sample the thin airway surface liquid without mechanically triggering ATP release. Consequently, we adopted a two-step strategy to measure resting levels of nucleotides and adenosine in primary cultures bathed with ASL volumes that approximate those in vivo. First, we measured the clearance rates of trace amounts of [γ-32P]ATP and [3H]adenosine. Second, we utilized a micromanipulator to sample small ASL volumes"
https://openalex.org/W1985278508,"The CB1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) displays a significant level of ligand-independent (i.e. constitutive) activity, either when heterologously expressed in nonneuronal cells or in neurons where CB1Rs are endogenous. The present study investigates the consequences of constitutive activity on the intracellular trafficking of CB1R. When transfected in HEK-293 cells, CB1R is present at the plasma membrane, but a substantial proportion (∼85%) of receptors is localized in intracellular vesicles. Detailed analysis of CB1-EGFP expressed in HEK-293 cells shows that the intracellular CB1R population is mostly of endocytic origin and that treatment with inverse agonist AM281 traps CB1R at the plasma membrane through a monensin-sensitive recycling pathway. Co-transfection with dominant positive or dominant negative mutants of the small GTPases Rab5 and Rab4, but not Rab11, profoundly modifies the steady-state and ligand-induced intracellular distribution of CB1R, indicating that constitutive endocytosis is Rab5-dependent, whereas constitutive recycling is mediated by Rab4. In conclusion, our results indicate that, due to its natural constitutive activity, CB1R permanently and constitutively cycles between plasma membrane and endosomes, leading to a predominantly intracellular localization at steady state.

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; CB1R, CB1 cannabinoid receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; MFR, membrane fluorescence ratio; Tf, transferrin; TfR, Tf receptor; WIN, WIN55,212-2; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum.1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; CB1R, CB1 cannabinoid receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; MFR, membrane fluorescence ratio; Tf, transferrin; TfR, Tf receptor; WIN, WIN55,212-2; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. represent one of the largest protein superfamilies, with around 1000 receptors in vertebrates (1Howard A.D. McAllister G. Feighner S.D. Liu Q. Nargund R.P. Van der Ploeg L.H. Patchett A.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 132-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The classical paradigm of GPCR function stipulates that GPCRs localize on the cell surface and are activated by the binding of agonist ligands. This leads to G-protein activation and initiates various changes in intracellular signaling pathways. After activation, most GPCRs are endocytosed from cell surface and travel to low pH endosomes, allowing the ligand to detach before the receptor is recycled back to the cell surface or sent through late endosomes to lysosomes for degradation (2Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing evidence shows also that some GPCRs are not totally inactive in the absence of ligands but exhibit tonic (i.e. constitutive) activity, with elevated basal levels of intracellular signaling (3Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2002; 366: 381-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar).Pharmacological characterization of constitutively active GPCRs leads to the definition of three different ligand classes: agonists, neutral antagonists, and inverse agonists. In the two-state model of receptor activation (4Milligan G. Bond R.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 468-474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), receptors are in equilibrium between a inactive and an active state. An agonist stabilizes the active state, shifting the receptor population toward activation, a neutral antagonist binds with equal affinity to both active and inactive conformation, whereas an inverse agonist will preferentially stabilize the inactive state. In the absence of ligand, the equilibrium for most GPCRs is shifted strongly to the inactive state, whereas for constitutively active receptors, the equilibrium is shifted toward the active state. Thus, by spontaneously adopting the active conformation, constitutively active GPCRs are able to mobilize cellular signaling pathways in the absence of agonist ligands, and inverse agonist ligands inhibit this basal activation.The cannabinoid type I receptor (CB1R) is one of the most abundant GPCRs in the central nervous system, with a high level of expression in cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (5Matsuda L.A. Lolait S.J. Brownstein M.J. Young A.C. Bonner T.I. Nature. 1990; 346: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (4161) Google Scholar). CB1Rs are coupled to Gi/o-proteins, and activation results in inhibition of cAMP accumulation; mitogen-activated protein kinase activation; inhibition of L, P, Q, and N type Ca2+ channels; and activation of Kir type K+ channels (6Howlett A.C. Barth F. Bonner T.I. Cabral G. Casellas P. Devane W.A. Felder C.C. Herkenham M. Mackie K. Martin B.R. Mechoulam R. Pertwee R.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 161-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the CB1R, like numerous other GPCRs, displays a high level of constitutive activity (3Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2002; 366: 381-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), either when heterologously expressed in nonneuronal cells (7Bouaboula M. Perrachon S. Milligan L. Canat X. Rinaldi-Carmona M. Portier M. Barth F. Calandra B. Pecceu F. Lupker J. Maffrand J.P. Le Fur G. Casellas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22330-22339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) or in neurons where CB1Rs are endogenous (8Pan X. Ikeda S.R. Lewis D.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1064-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 9Hillard C.J. Muthian S. Kearn C.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).In contrast to pharmacology, few studies address the question of intracellular trafficking of constitutively active GPCRs (10Marion S. Weiner D.M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2945-2954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 11Miserey-Lenkei S. Parnot C. Bardin S. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5891-5901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied the subcellular distribution of the CB1R as well as its trafficking in response to various pharmacological stimulations. We constructed a CB1-EGFP chimera, transiently expressed CB1-EGFP in HEK-293 cells and quantified the subcellular distribution and translocation after different pharmacological treatments. Our results indicate that the constitutively active CB1R undergoes constitutive endocytosis and recycling mediated by the small GTPases Rab5 and Rab4, respectively.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids, Antibodies, and Reagents—Antibody production was performed by Eurogentec (Herstal, Belgium). The C-Ter antibody was produced by injection of a peptide corresponding to the last 14 C-terminal residues (positions 459–473) of the rat CB1R coupled to key-hole limpet hemocyanin in rabbits followed by affinity purification of sera against the 459–473 peptide. The L14 antibody, kindly provided by Dr. Ken Mackie (University of Washington, Seattle, WA), is directed against the same epitope that is present both in the rat and the mouse receptor. The specificity of the L14 antibody was verified by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry on CB1+/+ and CB1-/-mice. 2K. Mackie, personal communication. The N-Ter antibody was produced by Double-X program (Eurogentec) with coinjection of keyhole limpet hemocyanin peptides corresponding to residues 22–36 and 53–67 of the receptor in rabbits, followed by affinity purification of the sera against the 53–67 peptide. The anti-human transferrin receptor OKT9 antibody was from ATCC, and the Cy3-conjugated transferrin was a gift from Dr. Alice Dautry (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Anti-Golgi matrix 130 protein (GM130; Golgi marker) was from Transduction Laboratories, the anti-protein-disulfide isomerase (endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker) was from Stressgene, and the 6C4 antibody (marker of late endosomes (12Kobayashi T.

The Rab-EGFP (13Hunyady L. Baukal A.J. Gaborik Z. Olivares-Reyes J.A. Bor M. Szaszak M. Lodge R. Catt K.J. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1211-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) plasmids were generously provided by Dr. Robert Lodge (Université du Quebec, Laval). Alexa®-labeled secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Cannabinoid ligands were from Tocris. All other chemicals were from Sigma.DNA Constructs—The CB1R sequence was amplified without its stop codon from rat genomic DNA using the primers 5′-TTTGGATCCATGAAGTCGATCATCCTAGAT and 3′-TTTACCGGTAGAGCCTCGGCGGACGT and inserted between the AgeI and BamHI sites of the pEGFP-N1 plasmid (Clontech), generating the CB1-EFGP construct. The CB1-WT construct coding for the untagged CB1R was obtained by inserting a stop codon into the CB1-EGFP sequence at the end of the CB1R coding sequence using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis system (Stratagene). All constructs were verified by full-length sequencing.Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK-293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) cultivated in minimal essential medium, 7.5% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) were transfected in 6-well plates with 0.8 μg of CB1-EGFP plasmid DNA using Effectene reagent (Qiagen). For the Rab-EGFP experiments, cells were co-transfected with 0.4 μg of Rab-EGFP plasmid. Lilly pork kidney cells (LLC-PK1; ATCC CL-101) were grown and transfected as previously described (14Darmon M. Langlois X. Suffisseau L. Fattaccini C.M. Hamon M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2294-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Neuroblastoma SHSY-5Y cells (ATCC CRL-2266) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and transfected with 0.8 μg of plasmid CB1-EGFP DNA using Effectene.Pharmacological Assays in HEK-293 Cells—For the cAMP assay, a bioluminescent assay was performed following the manufacturer's instructions (Tropix). Briefly, cells seeded in precoated 96-well plates were preincubated the next day 15 min at 37 °C with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 μm RO20-1724 and then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of 10 μm forskolin and processed for bioluminescent assay. For CB1R trafficking experiments, cells were seeded 48–72 h after transfection on polyallylamine-treated chambered coverglass 8-well slides (Labtek, Nunc) and assayed as described previously (11Miserey-Lenkei S. Parnot C. Bardin S. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5891-5901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, after a 1-h preincubation with 70 μm cycloheximide, cells were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C in Earle's buffer (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.9 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6) supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% glucose, 0.08 mm phenanthroline, and 70 μm cycloheximide. Cells were then incubated with ligands in supplemented Earle's buffer for 30 min at 4 °C, before being incubated at 37 °C for various periods of time. After incubation, cells were washed with ice-cold Earle's buffer and fixed.Immunohistochemistry—The specificity of the C-Ter, L14, and N-Ter antibodies was verified by colocalization of immunostaining with GFP fluorescence in CB1-EGFP-expressing cells, and negative controls were performed either by omitting the primary antibody or by depleting the primary antibody with corresponding blocking peptides, resulting in a complete loss of immunolabeling. The staining pattern of the C-Ter antibody and that of the L14 antibody were similar. For immunostaining of fixed cells, HEK-293 cells were fixed for 15 min in phosphate-buffered saline, 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, immunostained for 1 h for CB1R using the C-Ter or L14 primary antibody diluted to 1:1000 at room temperature, and incubated for 30 min with anti-rabbit Alexa® 568 secondary antibody diluted to 1:400 at room temperature. For live immunostaining of surface receptors, cells were incubated for 5 min at the end of treatments in supplemented minimal essential medium with N-Ter antibody diluted to 1:400. Cells were fixed with phosphate-buffered saline, 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with anti-rabbit Alexa® 568 secondary antibody diluted to 1:400. For live antibody feeding, cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in supplemented minimal essential medium with N-Ter antibody diluted to 1:200 and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then incubated with anti-rabbit Alexa® 568 secondary antibody without or after permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100. For transferrin uptake experiments, cells were placed in serum-free minimal essential medium for 1 h and incubated with Cy3-Tf diluted to 1:400 for 1 h at 37 °C before fixation.Cell Microscopy—For confocal microscopy, images (1024 × 1024 pixels) of individual cells were obtained on a Leica TCS NT confocal laser-scanning microscope by the use of a × 63, numerical aperture 1.4 oil immersion objective and × 4 zoom, resulting in a pixel size of 38.75 nm. Excitation was done at 488 nm, and fluorescence detection used a 525 ± 25-nm bandpass filter. Each image was realized on the equatorial cross-section through the cell that maximized nuclear diameter. Cells were randomly chosen in the well for each condition, with phenotypic consideration to avoid dead, dividing, or highly CB1R-overexpressing cells. In our protocol, cells are fixed 2–4 h (depending from the incubation length) after seeding, displaying a rather spherical form that allows precise equatorial optical sectioning and facilitates quantification. Co-detection of EGFP and red fluorescence (Cy3 or Alexa® 568) was done by excitation at 488 and 568 nm, using simultaneous detection with 525 ± 25-nm bandpass and >590-nm longpass filters.For live cell imaging, CB1-EGFP-transfected HEK-293 cells were imaged on the ultrafast 4/5D deconvolution imaging system at Institut Curie (Paris, France) (15Savino T.M. Gebrane-Younes J. De Mey J. Sibarita J.B. Hernandez-Verdun D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1097-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), using a Leica DM-IRBE microscope equipped with a × 100, numerical aperture 1.4 objective and a temperature-controlled box at 37 °C (The Box & The Cube, LIS). Stacks of images with a 0.2-μm Z step (∼10–15 frames/stack) were acquired every 3 s for 5 min. After deconvolution (15Savino T.M. Gebrane-Younes J. De Mey J. Sibarita J.B. Hernandez-Verdun D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1097-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), stacks were projected along the z axis using Metamorph Software (Universal Imaging Corp.).Image Quantification—Confocal images were used to quantify the subcellular distribution and translocation of CB1R (11Miserey-Lenkei S.

In-house-developed macro algorithms (available on request), written for the public domain Object Image software (available on the World Wide Web at simon.bio.uva.nl/object-image.html), were used to measure the subcellular distribution of the CB1Rs in HEK-293 cells. We measured mean fluorescence density values S, C, and N, corresponding to the surface (measured from the edge of the cell to 300 nm inside), cytoplasm, and nucleus of the cell. The nuclear fluorescence N, corresponding to the background, was subtracted from the S and C values, which, once multiplied by the respective areas, yielded the S′ and C′ total specific fluorescence. The displayed result is the S′/C′ ratio that we call the membrane fluorescence ratio (MFR). The mean cell fluorescence, measuring the CB1R expression level in individual cells, was obtained by measuring the background-corrected mean density of the total cellular area (surface and cytoplasm).RESULTSCB1-EGFP Is Functional and Displays a Predominantly Intracellular Localization in HEK-293 Cells—In order to directly visualize and quantify the traffic of the CB1R, we created a chimeric protein by fusing EGFP to the C terminus end of the CB1R (CB1-EGFP). CB1R activation results in cAMP inhibition by negatively regulating adenylate cyclase activity (6Howlett A.C. Barth F. Bonner T.I. Cabral G. Casellas P. Devane W.A. Felder C.C. Herkenham M. Mackie K. Martin B.R. Mechoulam R. Pertwee R.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 161-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). In nontransfected HEK-293 cells, forskolin stimulation induces a 37 ± 1.03-fold accumulation of cAMP. In contrast, cells transiently expressing the wild type CB1R (CB1-WT) or CB1-EGFP show a 2-fold lower level of cAMP accumulation, with a stimulation factor of 17.3 ± 0.51 and 19.8 ± 0.28, respectively (Fig. 1A). Thus, CB1R exerts a constitutive inhibitory effect on cAMP accumulation in HEK-293 cells, consistent with previous data obtained in CHO cells (7Bouaboula M. Perrachon S. Milligan L. Canat X. Rinaldi-Carmona M. Portier M. Barth F. Calandra B. Pecceu F. Lupker J. Maffrand J.P. Le Fur G. Casellas P. J. Biol.

Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 334: R1-R2Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This effect is similar for CB1-WT and CB1-EGFP, showing that CB1-EGFP is functional.Strikingly, observation of CB1-EGFP-expressing HEK-293 cells by confocal microscopy shows that CB1-EGFP receptors are localized both on the plasma membrane and in intracellular vesicles (Fig. 1B). We quantified CB1-EGFP subcellular distribution on confocal images by measuring the MFR, which is the ratio of plasma membrane fluorescence over intracellular fluorescence (see “Experimental Procedures”). Quantification of CB1-EGFP distribution on equatorial confocal sections of individual cells leads to a MFR of 0.19 ± 0.02 for control cells in a typical experiment (see Figs. 1E and 4, A (a) and B). If we translate this value to express the percentage of CB1Rs that are intracellular, the result shows that ∼85% of CB1Rs are localized to cytoplasmic vesicles in the equatorial plane of control cells.Fig. 4Translocation of CB1R after pharmacological treatments in HEK-293 cells.A, confocal images of HEK-293 cells transfected with CB1-EGFP and treated for 3 h at 37 °C in the presence of cycloheximide.

Inverse agonist AM281 was applied at a 500 Kd concentration (7 μm). For each condition, the MFR was measured for a population of 8–12 cells. C, a, concentration-response curves for WIN and AM281 effects on subcellular CB1-EGFP distribution. Cells were preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C with various concentration of ligand and then incubated at 37 °C for 20 min without ligand for WIN (pulse-chase) or 3 h in the presence of ligand for AM281. b, time course of the effects of WIN and AM281 on subcellular CB1R distribution.

HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with CB1-EGFP show a large range of expression levels. We thus quantified 145 cells showing large variations in the mean cell fluorescence (indicating expression level) and of membrane fluorescence ratio (representing subcellular distribution). The resulting graph (Fig. 1C) shows that there is no correlation between the expression level and the membrane/cytoplasm distribution, since the correlation coefficient R2 is very low (<0.005) and the slope of the correlation is weakly negative, not significantly different from zero, showing that the MFR does not vary with the mean cell fluorescence. Moreover, GFP-tagged AT1A angiotensin II (11Miserey-Lenkei S. Parnot C. Bardin S. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5891-5901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or somatostatin SSTR2 receptors expressed at the same levels in HEK-293 cells localize predominantly at the plasma membrane (data not shown), showing that overexpression is not the cause of intracellular receptor accumulation. Furthermore, it is not due to the GFP tag, since untagged CB1-WT receptors detected by immunohistochemistry display the same intracellular distribution (data not shown). Finally, a similar distribution is observed in cell lines other than HEK-293 such as polarized epithelial LLC-PK1 cells (14Darmon M. Langlois X. Suffisseau L. Fattaccini C.M. Hamon M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2294-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D, a) or SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 1D, b), where CB1-EGFP also localizes predominantly in intracellular vesicles.Intracellular CB1R Distribution Indicates Endocytic Origin—Intracellular CB1R localization has been previously reported (18Hsieh C. Brown S. Derleth C. Mackie K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 19Coutts A.A. Anavi-Goffer S. Ross R.A. MacEwan D.J. Mackie K. Pertwee R.G. Irving A.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and these intracellular receptors could presumably correspond to maturing receptors in the neosynthetic pathway. To assess the proportion of newly synthesized intracellular CB1R receptors, we monitored the distribution of CB1-EGFP receptors after continuous treatment (1–4 h) with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. This treatment does not change the distribution of CB1Rs (Fig. 1E), suggesting that neosynthesis is not the primary source of intracellular CB1R fluorescence.We also performed labeling of various intracellular compartments of cycloheximide-treated CB1-EGFP-expressing cells (Fig. 2): Golgi apparatus with anti-GM130 antibody (a–d), ER with anti-protein-disulfide isomerase antibody (e–h), transferrin receptor (TfR)-containing endosomes with anti-TfR OKT9 antibody (i–l), endocytosed transferrin (Tf) with Cy3-conjugated Tf (m–p), and late endosomes with 6C4 antibody (q–t). CB1Rs do not show major colocalization with neosynthesis (Golgi and ER) or with degradative (late endosomes) pathways. Intracellular CB1R-positive vesicles are morphologically similar to TfR-positive endosomes, and several TfR- or Tf-positive endosomes contain CB1R (Fig. 2, i–p, arrowheads in l and p), but CB1Rs do not significantly colocalize with TfRs that appear in perinuclear recycling endosomes. Thus, the majority of intracellular CB1Rs are not likely to correspond to maturing or degrading receptors but rather have an endocytic origin.Fig. 2Immunolabeling pattern of intracellular CB1R suggest endocytic origin. CB1-EGFP-expressing cells with immunostaining of intracellular structures: Golgi apparatus (a–d), ER (e–h), TfR (i–l), endocytosed Cy3-transferrin-containing endosomes (Tf; m–p), and late endosomes (LE; q–t).

Using fast acquisition rates (one Z-stack every 3 s), we observed living CB1-EGFP-transfected HEK-293 cells. This allowed us to track CB1-EGFP-containing vesicles moving across the cytoplasm with remarkable spatial and temporal resolution (Fig. 3, B and C). Vesicles show various dynamics: certain ones are rapidly moving over long distances across cytoplasm (red trajectory in Fig. 3B), and others show rapid movements between periods of relative immobility (see green trajectory in Fig. 3B and montage in Fig. 3C), whereas others are more static (see blue trajectory in Fig. 3B). Events of fission and fusion between vesicles or with plasma membrane can also be observed. Thus, CB1-EGFP show very fast dynamics in HEK-293 cells that are compatible with possible constitutive trafficking of CB1R between plasma membrane and cytoplasm.Fig. 3Live imaging of CB1-EGFP in HEK-293 cells. Four-dimensional deconvoluted time lapse imaging of a HEK-293 cell expressing CB1-EGFP. Z-stacks of 15 images, with a 0.2-μm step, were acquired every 3 s for 5 min.

In parallel, we labeled surface receptors with the N-Ter antibody, directed against an extracellular epitope in the amino terminus of the receptor. Incubation for 3 h with agonist WIN55,212-2 (WIN; 330 nm) (Fig. 4A) or CP 55,940 (1 μm, data not shown) leads to complete endocytosis of the plasma membrane-localized population of CB1Rs (Fig. 4, A and B), with a 75% decrease of the MFR and an almost complete disappearance of surface receptor labeling (Fig. 4A, e). Two other CB1R agonists: methanandamide (mAn), a stable analog of the endocannabinoid anandamide, and the putative endocannabinoid noladin ether (NE) also provoke CB1R endocytosis, with a decrease of the MFR to values close to that induced by WIN (Fig. 4B). These results are consistent with previous observations of CB1R endocytosis (18Hsieh C. Brown S. Derleth C. Mackie K. J.

Makriyannis A. Life Sci. 1997; 61: 191-197Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar), an analog of SR141716A (Rimonabant). AM281 is able to antagonize endocytosis induced by the agonist WIN (Fig. 4B), restoring the MFR of control cells. Importantly, when applied alone, AM281 (7 μm for 3 h) induces translocation of intracellular CB1Rs toward the plasma membrane, clearing the cytoplasm of CB1R-containing vesicle"
https://openalex.org/W2021020196,"Polo-like kinase-1 (Plk1) performs multiple essential functions during the cell cycle. Here we show that human Plk1-deficient cells are unable to separate their centrosomes, fail to form a bipolar spindle, and undergo a Mad2/BubR1-dependent prometaphase arrest. However, electron microscopy demonstrates that kinetochore-microtubule interactions can be established in cells lacking Plk1. In addition, co-depletion of Plk1 and survivin allows mitotic exit. This indicates that Plk1 depletion does not prevent microtubule attachment, but specifically interferes with the generation of tension, as a consequence of a failure to form a bipolar spindle. Moreover, we find that after silencing of the spindle assembly checkpoint, degradation of cyclin B1 is unaffected in cells lacking Plk1. These data indicate that activation of the anaphase promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C)-Cdc20 complex that is under control of the spindle assembly checkpoint does not require Plk1 activity. Finally, we find that translocation of chromosome passengers and initiation of cleavage furrow ingression is unaffected in cells depleted of Plk1. Thus, our data confirm an important role of Plk1 in bipolar spindle formation, and also demonstrate that Plk1 is dispensable for APC/C-Cdc20 activation and the initiation of cytokinesis.

Polo-like kinases have been associated with many aspects of mitosis (reviewed in Refs. 1Donaldson M.M. Tavares A.A. Hagan I.M. Nigg E.A. Glover D.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2357-2358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Glover D.M. Ohkura H. Tavares A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1681-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 3Glover D.M. Hagan I.M.

Originally identified as the polo gene in Drosophila, Polo-like kinases were shown to be required for proper mitotic progression in various species. Whereas a single Polo-like kinase has been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Cdc5), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Plo1), and Drosophila melanogaster (Polo), mammalian cells appear to express up to four distinct Polo-like kinases (Plk1, Plk2 or SNK, Plk3 or Prk/Fnk, and SAK) (4Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Of these different kinases, the function of Plk1 is most extensively studied, and Plk1 appears to play multiple important roles during mitosis (1Donaldson M.M. Tavares A.A. Hagan I.M. Nigg E.A. Glover D.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2357-2358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the G2-M transition, a role for Polo-like kinases was suggested in activation of the cyclin B1-Cdk1 complex. Experiments in Xenopus extracts showed that the Polo orthologue Plx1 is able to phosphorylate and activate the Cdc25C phosphatase (5Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1996; 273: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 6Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Taieb F.E. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1791-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Cdc25C in turn activates the Cdk1 subunit of the cyclin B1-Cdk1 complex by dephosphorylation (reviewed in Ref. 7Smits V.A. Medema R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1519: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Cyclin B1-Cdk1 complexes can phosphorylate and further activate Cdc25C (8Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 9Izumi T. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1337-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), resulting in a positive feedback loop that facilitates rapid entry into mitosis. In addition, active Plk1 was shown to induce translocation of both Cdc25C and cyclin B1 to the nucleus (10Toyoshima-Morimoto F. Taniguchi E. Shinya N. Iwamatsu A. Nishida E. Nature. 2001; 410: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 11Toyoshima-Morimoto F. Taniguchi E. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). More recent work, however, indicates that Plk1-mediated phosphorylation does not cause cyclin B1 to move into the nucleus, but suggests it rather contributes to activation of cyclin B1-Cdk complexes at the centrosomes (12Jackman M. Lindon C. Nigg E.A. Pines J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). During the early stages of mitosis, Polo-like kinases were shown to mediate the displacement of cohesin from the chromosome arms by phosphorylating the cohesin subunit SCC1 (13Losada A. Hirano M. Hirano T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3004-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 14Sumara I. Vorlaufer E. Stukenberg P.T. Kelm O. Redemann N. Nigg E.A. Peters J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The cohesin complex holds paired chromatids together and plays a central role in ensuring that paired sister chromatids obtain bipolar attachment prior to segregation of the chromosomes to opposite poles during anaphase (15Nasmyth K. Peters J.M. Uhlmann F. Science. 2000; 288: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). During prophase in vertebrates (but not in yeast), cohesin is displaced from the chromosome arms, whereas it is specifically retained at the centromeric region (16Waizenegger I.C. Hauf S. Meinke A. Peters J.M. Cell. 2000; 103: 399-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). SCC1 phosphorylation by Plx1 strongly decreases the binding capacity of cohesin to chromatin and was shown to be required and sufficient to drive cohesin displacement from the chromosome arms (14Sumara I.

Removal of the centromeric fraction of cohesin at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition requires activation of a ubiquitin ligase called the anaphase promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) 1The abbreviations used are: APC/C, anaphase promoting complex or cyclosome; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RNAi, RNA interference; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DIC, differential interference contrast; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; INCENP, inner centromere protein; PI, propidium iodide; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting.1The abbreviations used are: APC/C, anaphase promoting complex or cyclosome; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RNAi, RNA interference; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DIC, differential interference contrast; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; INCENP, inner centromere protein; PI, propidium iodide; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting. (17Hauf S. Waizenegger I.C. Peters J.M. Science. 2001; 293: 1320-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Active APC/C mediates degradation of securin, an inhibitor of cohesin cleavage (18Zou H. McGarry T.J. Bernal T. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1999; 285: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Degradation of securin, but also of cyclin A and cyclin B1, requires association of APC/C with the regulatory subunit Cdc20 (19Peters J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Later in mitosis, association of the APC/C with the Cdc20-related protein Cdh1 is required for degradation of other mitotic proteins, such as Aurora A and Cdc20. In the process of APC/C activation, Plk1 was suggested to play a regulatory role. Plk1 has been shown to phosphorylate three subunits of the APC/C in vitro (Cdc16, Cdc27, and Tsg24) (20Kotani S.

Yudkovsky Y. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15552-15557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In addition, depletion of Plx1 from Xenopus extracts was shown to block APC/C-dependent degradation of cyclin B (22Descombes P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1328-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, controversy remains whether cyclin B1-Cdk1 or Plk1 acts as the major APC/C-activating kinase, as mutational analysis in budding yeast APC/C subunits pointed at cyclin B1-Cdk1 as the predominant APC/C activator in vivo (23Rudner A.D. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1377-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Polo-like kinases also perform essential roles during the later stages of mitosis. In fission yeast, disruption of the plo1 gene leads to failure in septum formation, a process that is homologous to cytokinesis in mammalian cells (24Ohkura H. Hagan I.M. Glover D.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1059-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Loss of plo1 protein resulted in failure to form an F-actin ring as well as loss of septal protein accumulation, whereas overexpression of plo1 could drive excessive septum formation. Similarly, in budding yeast, the Polo-like kinase Cdc5 has been shown to trigger activation of the mitotic exit network by inducing release of the Cdc14 phosphatase from the nucleolus (25Hu F. Wang Y. Liu D. Li Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 26Stegmeier F. Visintin R. Amon A. Cell. 2002; 108: 207-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Release of Cdc14 causes the activation of the APC/C-Cdh1, accumulation of the Cdk inhibitor SIC1 and ultimately results to the inactivation of mitotic cyclins, a prerequisite for mitotic exit and cytokinesis (27Bardin A.J. Amon A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). A role for Polo kinases in cytokinesis in mammalian cells was also suggested, based on experiments in which overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of Plk1 was used to interfere with the function of Plk1 (28Seong Y.S.

After inactivation of the spindle assembly checkpoint, expression of this fragment did not allow successful cytokinesis and resulted in formation of binucleated cells. In addition, recent observations suggested that phosphorylation of Mklp2 and Nir2 by Plk1 is required for proper cytokinesis (29Litvak V. Argov R. Dahan N. Ramachandran S. Amarilio R. Shainskaya A.

Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Finally, regulatory roles for Plk1 in the centrosome cycle and formation of the mitotic spindle have been reported in a variety of species (reviewed in Refs. 1Donaldson M.M. Tavares A.A. Hagan I.M.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, Polo was shown to phosphorylate Asp, a microtubule-associated protein that binds to the centrosomes and is required to organize microtubule asters (31Gonzalez C. Sunkel C.E. Glover D.M. Chromosoma. 1998; 107: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 32do Carmo Avides M. Tavares A. Glover D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Mutations in Polo result in the formation of aberrant mitotic spindles and disrupt centrosome organization (33Llamazares S. Moreira A. Tavares A. Girdham C. Spruce B.A. Gonzalez C. Karess R.E. Glover D.M. Sunkel C.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2153-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 34Sunkel C.E. Glover D.M. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 89: 25-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In HeLa cells, microinjection of neutralizing anti-Plk1-antibodies impaired centrosome maturation and resulted in a mitotic arrest (35Lane H.A. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1701-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in Xenopus extracts, where cells that do not require activation of Cdc25C for mitotic entry were shown to arrest in mitosis with monopolar spindles, when Plx1 was depleted (36Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Li C. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4262-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). More recently, interference with Plk1 expression was shown to impair the ability of centrosomes to amplify in a hydroxyurea block (37Liu X. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8672-8676Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). At present, it is unclear how the multiple functions of Plk1 are separated in space and time to allow orderly progression through the different stages of mitosis. In addition, it is not exactly clear whether all of the reported cell cycle defects are a direct consequence of interference with Plk1 function, or whether they arise as a secondary effect of a spindle defect or aberrant entry into mitosis. To gain more insight on the diverse functions of Plk1 during division of human cells, we examined the roles of Plk1 by RNA interference. Plasmids—Vectors producing small interfering RNAs (siRNA) were constructed as described (38Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar). The Plk1, Mad2, and BubR1 targeting vectors (pS-Plk1, pS-Mad2, and pS-BubR1) were based on a 19-mer sequence present in the mRNA sequence of human Plk1 (CGGCAGCGTGCAGATCAAC), Mad2 (GGAAGAGTCGGGACCACAG), or BubR1 (AGATCCTGGCTAACTGTTC), respectively. pS-BubR1 was kindly provided by Dr. G.

Silent mutations in the targeting region of Plk1 were introduced by PCR-based mutagenesis, using the following primers: forward, 5′-AGCAACCGGCAGTGTTCAGATCAACTTC-3′ (bold nucleotides indicate silent mutations); reverse, 5′GAAGTTGATCTGAACACTGCCGGTTGCT-3′. pS-survivin (40Lens S.M.

Lens, manuscript in preparation. Antibodies and Dyes—Rabbit anti-phosphohistone H3, mouse anti-MPM-2, and rabbit anti-Plk1 were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); rabbit anti-Mad2 was from Babco (Richmond, CA); mouse anti-Aurora B was from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA); mouse anti-Cdc27 was from BD Pharmingen (Franklin Lakes, NJ); rabbit anti-Cdk4, rabbit anti-cyclin A, mouse anti-cyclin B1, and rabbit anti-γ-tubulin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); mouse anti-α-tubulin was from Sigma; rabbit antisecurin (PTTG-1) was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA); sheep anti-BubR1 was a gift of Dr. S. Taylor (University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom) and has been described previously (45Taylor S.S. Hussein D. Wang Y. Elderkin S. Morrow C.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4385-4395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Donkey anti-rabbit/Cy5 conjugate was from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (Westgrove, PA). Goat anti-mouse/Alexa568, goat anti-rabbit/Alexa633, and goat anti-rabbit/Alexa568 conjugates were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antiserum was from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark). Propidium iodide was from Sigma. Kinase Assays—Cells were transiently transfected using 2 μg of myc-Plk1 in combination with 10 μg of pSuper or pS-Plk1. At 50 h after transfection, cells were lysed, myc-tagged-Plk1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody (9E10), and kinase assays were performed as described (41Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with anti-Plk1 showed that each sample contained equal amounts of Plk1. For cyclin B1-associated kinase activity, cells were transfected with 10 μg of pSuper, or a combination of pS-Plk1, pS-BubR1, and/or Mad2 as indicated. 1 μg of pBabePuro (1 μg) was added in each transfection. Immediately following transfection, cells were blocked in thymidine for 24 h in the presence of 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). 18 h after thymidine release, cells were lysed, cyclin B1 was immunoprecipitated, and kinase assays were performed as described (41Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Synchronization, and Spindle Assembly Checkpoint Activation—Experiments were performed in U2OS and HeLa cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 6% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For cell synchronization at the G1/S transition, cells were incubated with 2.5 mm thymidine for 24 h. To block centrosome separation, 200 μm monastrol was added directly after thymidine release, if indicated. To arrest cells at the spindle assembly checkpoint, paclitaxel (1 μg/ml) was added directly after release from the thymidine block where indicated. Mitotic HeLa cells were obtained by shake-off at 24 h after thymidine release. G2 HeLa cells were obtained at 6 h after thymidine release. All drugs were obtained from Sigma. Transfections and Colony Formation Assays—Cells were transfected by the standard calcium phosphate transfection protocol. Where indicated, cells were synchronized by a thymidine block directly after washing away the calcium phosphate precipitate. Cells were maintained in thymidine for 24 h, after which they were released from the block, and followed as they progressed through S-, G2-, and M-phase. At different time points after release, cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry or immunofluorescence. Alternatively, transfected cells were monitored by time-lapse analysis. For colony formation assays or selection of transfected cells, 0.5 μg of pBabePuro was co-transfected with 10 μg of pSuper or pS-Plk1. 48 h after transfection, cells were collected by trypsinization and harvested. For colony formation assays, equal amounts of transfected cells were plated on 10-cm dishes and selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin for 10–14 days. At this point, cells were fixed in methanol and colonies were stained with crystal violet. Time-lapse Analysis—Cells were plated on 35-mm glass-bottom culture dishes (Willco-dish, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and transfected the next day with pSuper or pS-Plk1, in combination with H2B-GFP. After release from thymidine block, cells were followed by time-lapse microscopy starting at ∼10 h after release. More than 80% of the cells were in late G2 at this point, as determined in parallel experiments using flow cytometry. For live imaging, dishes were transferred to a heated culture chamber (37 °C, 5% CO2) of a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with a 0.55 numeric aperture condenser and a 40× Plan-Neo DIC objective (numeric aperture = 1.3). 12-bit phase contrast images (100-ms exposures to halogen light) and green fluorescence (100-ms exposures to blue light) were captured using a Photometrics Coolsnap HQ charged-coupled device camera set at gain 1.0 (Scientific, Tucson, AZ) and a GFP/DsRed or CFP/YFP dual band pass filter set (Chroma Technology Corp. Rockingham, VT) to select specific fluorescence. Images were processed using MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging, Downington, PA). Flow Cytometry—MPM2 positivity of transfected cells was determined as described (41Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). For analysis of phosphohistone H3 positivity, cells were harvested at the indicated time points after release from a thymidine block and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol. Cells were washed once with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and stained with anti-phosphohistone H3 antibody. Cells were subsequently stained with a Cy5-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody and counterstained with propidium iodide. Cell cycle distribution of the transfected (GFP-positive) cells was analyzed using flow cytometry (Cell Quest, Becton Dickinson) as described (41Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—U2OS were transfected with 10 μg of pSuper or pS-Plk1. After release from a thymidine block, pSuper-transfected cells were treated with paclitaxel (1 mg/ml). 24 h after thymidine release, mitotic cells were obtained by gentle shake-off, fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PHEM (60 mm Pipes, 25 mm Hepes, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm EGTA, pH 6.9) for 2 h, and postfixed for 1 h with 2% osmium tetroxide. Then they were treated for 1 min with 0.15% tannic acid, stained en bloc with 1% uranyl acetate, dehydrated, and embedded in LX-112. Thin sections were examined with a CM10 transmission electron microscope (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown on coverslips coated by incubation in 10% poly-l-lysine (Sigma) for 1 h. Cells were transfected the next day and synchronized using thymidine. At the indicated time points after thymidine release from the block, coverslips were removed from the culture dish and washed twice with PBS. Cells were then fixed for 10 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde at room temperature and subsequently washed with PBS (twice). Alternatively, for α-tubulin and γ-tubulin staining, coverslips were washed in PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 0.5 min in PHEM buffer (45 mm Pipes, 45 mm Hepes, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 6.8). Cells were then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, followed by fixation in ice-cold methanol. For measurement of γ-tubulin intensity of coverslips containing pS- or pS-Plk1-transfected cells, Leica software was used to segment γ-tubulin associated with centrosomes by thresholding. Images were binarized and multiplied with original images to obtain 8-bit scale at segmented areas (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). As a control, neighboring nontransfected cells were analyzed and showed similar γ-tubulin intensity as pS-transfected cells. For Mad2 and BubR1 staining, cells were permeabilized in sucrose buffer (20 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4), prior to staining. Cells were analyzed on a Leica DMIRBE confocal microscope equipped with a 63× objective. Plk1 Is Essential for Progression through Mitosis—We used siRNA to specifically deplete Plk1 from human cells. For this purpose, we used pSuper, which allows stable expression of siRNAs in transfected cells (38Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of our Plk1 targeting vector (pS-Plk1) with an expression vector encoding myc-tagged Plk1 in U2OS human osteosarcoma cells resulted in a dramatic reduction of myc-Plk1 expression (Fig. 1A). This was further confirmed by performing in vitro kinase assays in which the ectopically expressed myc-tagged Plk1 was specifically immunoprecipitated, allowing us to quantify the extent of down-regulation. Using this approach, we determined the reduction in Plk1 expression by transfection of pS-Plk1 to be greater than 95% (Fig. 1A). To analyze whether expression of endogenous Plk1 was equally sensitive to expression of pS-Plk1, we selected puromycin-resistant cells after co-transfection of a puromycin resistance marker. This confirmed that the pS-Plk1 targeting vector effectively down-regulated expression of endogenous Plk1 (Fig. 1B). To study the general requirement for Plk1 for human cell division, we performed cell cycle analysis specifically on the transfected populations. We found that Plk1-depleted cells accumulated with a 4 N DNA content, indicating that these cells arrest either in G2 or in mitosis (Fig. 1C). As is shown in Fig. 1C, at 48 h after transfection ∼24% of pS-Plk1-transfected cells arrested in mitosis, as evidenced by a sharp increase in histone H3 phosphorylation. This is approximately half of the amount of mitotic cells we obtain after a 24-h treatment of U2OS cells with paclitaxel, indicating that a large fraction of the Plk1-depleted cells arrest in mitosis. Similar results were obtained when we analyzed the appearance of MPM-2 positivity, another well established mitotic marker (46Davis F.M. Tsao T.Y. Fowler S.K. Rao P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2926-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), or scored mitotic indices by immunofluorescence microscopy of PI-stained cells (data not shown). To prove that the pS-Plk1 targeting vector is specific, we reintroduced Plk1 into Plk1-depleted cells. For this purpose, we introduced two silent mutations in the part of the coding region of Plk1 that is recognized by the Plk1 siRNA. The expression of such a silent mutant of Plk1 (Plk1-sil) is unaffected by pS-Plk1 (Fig. 1D), showing that this silent mutant of Plk1 can be used to reconstitute expression of functional Plk1 in cells depleted of endogenous Plk1. Importantly, expression of Plk1-sil reverted the mitotic arrest that was observed with pS-Plk1 (Fig. 1C). In contrast, expression of a kinase-defective Plk1 mutant (Plk1-sil-KD) did not revert the mitotic arrest, showing that the kinase activity of Plk1 is crucial for its mitotic function. Stable expression of Plk1 siRNA in U2OS osteosarcoma cells led to a complete inhibition of colony formation, indicating that Plk1 has an essential role in cell proliferation that precludes the establishment of cell lines that lack Plk1 (Fig. 1E). These results are in line with the previously described loss of cell proliferation after Plk1 depletion (47Spankuch-Schmitt B. Wolf G. Solbach C. Loibl S. Knecht R. Stegmuller M. von Minckwitz G. Kaufmann M. Strebhardt K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3162-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Cell Cycle Progression after Plk1 Depletion—Plk1 has been suggested to play an important role in the activation of Cdc25C and in the nuclear translocation of both cyclin B1 as well as Cdc25C. This would suggest that Plk1 is essential for mitotic entry. We therefore analyzed cell cycle progression of the Plk1-knockdown cells in a synchronized cell population. Cells were maintained in thymidine for 24 h to block them at the G1-S transition, after which they were released and followed as they progressed through the cell cycle. Whereas control cultures progressed to the subsequent G1 phase at ∼18 h after thymidine release, Plk1-depleted cells failed to complete the cell cycle and arrested with 4 N DNA content (Fig. 2A). As judged from the clear accumulation of phosphohistone H3, Plk1 knockdown cells arrested in mitosis (Fig. 2B). Detailed analysis of the timing of mitotic entry showed that the majority of cells depleted of Plk1 entered mitosis with similar kinetics as control cells, indicating that Plk1 does not play an essential role in mitotic entry. 3van Vugt, M.

In whole cell patch clamp recordings primary human tracheal epithelial cells (hTE) and the human serous gland cell line Calu-3 expressed a functionally similar zincblockable plasma membrane H+ conductance. However, the rate of H+ secretion of confluent epithelial monolayers measured in Ussing chambers was 9-fold larger in hTE compared with Calu-3. In hTE H+ secretion was blocked by mucosal ZnCl2 and the NADPH oxidase blockers acetovanillone and 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), whereas these same blockers had no effect in Calu-3. We determined levels of transcripts for the NADPH oxidase transmembrane isoforms (Nox1 through -5, Duox1 and -2, and p22phox) and found Duox1, -2, and p22phox to be highly expressed in hTE, as well as the intracellular subunits p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox. In contrast, Calu-3 lacked transcripts for Duox1, p40phox, and p47phox. Anti-Duox antibody staining resulted in prominent apical staining in hTE but no significant staining in Calu-3. When treated with amiloride to block the Na+/H+ exchanger, intracellular pH in hTE acidified at significantly higher rates than in Calu-3, and treatment with AEBSF blocked acidification. These data suggest a role for an apically located Duox-based NADPH oxidase during intracellular H+ production and H+ secretion, but not in H+ conduction.

Recently, considerable attention has focused on the pH of the ASL (pHASL), which has been shown to affect various epithelial functions such as ion transport (2Konstas A.A. Mavrelos D. Korbmacher C.

Health. 1977; 32: 216-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). pHASL has been found to be slightly acidic compared with plasma. Initially, pHASL in the ferret trachea was found to be 6.85 using microelectrode measurements (8Kyle H. Ward J.P. Widdicombe J.G. J. Appl. Physiol. 1990; 68: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Using a pH-sensitive fluorophore, pHASL was found to be 6.8 in bovine cultures and 7.1 in vivo in mice (9Jayaraman S. Song Y. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1504-C1511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the inflammatory airway diseases asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease an acidic pHASL or acidic exhaled breath has been demonstrated (10Hunt J.F. Fang K. Malik R.

These observations suggested a regulated mechanism of acid secretion by the airways that is up-regulated during inflammation. Recently we found that human airway cells express a voltage-activated, zinc-sensitive H+ conductance and secrete acidequivalents into the mucosal bath (13Fischer H. Widdicombe J.H. Illek B. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C736-C743Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). H+-selective, voltage-activated currents were first recorded from snail neurons (14Thomas R.C. Meech R.W. Nature. 1982; 299: 826-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and since then have been found in many other cell types (15DeCoursey T.E. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 475-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The transmembrane protein complex NADPH oxidase has been suggested to mediate the H+ conductance in phagocytic cells (16Henderson L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33216-33223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), although this notion has been challenged recently (17Morgan D. Cherny V.V. Price M.O. Dinauer M.C. DeCoursey T.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In phagocytic cells NADPH oxidase plays a crucial role in killing invading organisms by producing superoxide radicals (O2·¯) by transferring an electron from intracellular NADPH across the membrane to extracellular O2. During the process of NADPH oxidation in neutrophils, intracellular H+ is released from NADPH and thereby contributes to intracellular acid production (18Demaurex N. Downey G.P. Waddell T.K. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The phagocytic NADPH oxidase is a multisubunit enzyme consisting of two transmembrane subunits (the cytochrome gp91phox and p22phox), three cytosolic subunits (p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox), and a small ubiquitously expressed GTP-binding protein p21rac (19Shatwell K.P. Segal A.W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 1191-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In phagocytes, all subunits were shown to be necessary for a regulated release of O2·¯ during the respiratory burst (20DeLeo F. Quinn M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1996; 60: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). gp91phox is a member of the Nox gene family, where it is referred to as Nox2. In addition to the small Nox homologs Nox1 through -5, two large homologs have been described recently, called dual oxidases Duox1 and -2 (21Dupuy C. Ohayon R. Valent A. Noel-Hudson M.-S. Deme D.

Expression of Duox1 and -2 has been found in the epithelium of the thyroid gland by immunofluorescence (22De Deken X. Wang D. Many M.-C. Costagliola S. Libert F. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. Miot F. J. Biol.

Witta J. Baffi J. Lekstrom K. Leto T.L. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1502-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Recent studies in our laboratory identified a zinc-sensitive H+ conductance and H+ secretion across the apical membrane of well differentiated human airway epithelia (13Fischer H. Widdicombe J.H. Illek B. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C736-C743Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We were intrigued by the notion that this physiological process was provided by the NADPH oxidase complex. This was addressed by studying H+ conductance, H+ secretion, NADPH oxidase expression, and intracellular H+ production in two functionally different types of human airway epithelia. Ciliated cells from the airway surface epithelium function to absorb fluid and acidify the airway lumen slightly (8Kyle H. Ward J.P. Widdicombe J.G. J. Appl. Physiol. 1990; 68: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Jayaraman S. Song Y. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1504-C1511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Fischer H. Widdicombe J.H. Illek B. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C736-C743Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), whereas cells from the submucosal serous glands secrete a bicarbonate-rich, alkaline fluid (25.Ballard, S. T., Trout, L., Bebok, Z., Sorscher, E. J., and Crews, A. (1999) 277, L694–L699Google Scholar, 26Lee M.C. Penland C.M. Widdicombe J.H. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L450-L453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report we compare the properties of airway surface versus submucosal gland cells by using primary cultures of human tracheal surface epithelia (hTE) and the Calu-3 submucosal gland cell line. These cells were chosen to relate high (hTE) and low rates (Calu-3) of H+ secretion to the expression of NADPH oxidase and its function. The experiments in this report demonstrate the localization of the dual oxidase Duox in the apical membrane of hTE surface cells but not in Calu-3 gland cells. Our data suggest that a Duox-based NADPH oxidase complex supports epithelial H+ secretion by generating intracellular H+, which provides a H+ gradient across the apical cell membrane. The plasma membrane H+ conductance did not correlate with Duox expression suggesting that intracellular H+ exited through a parallel pathway. Cell Cultures—Human primary tracheal epithelial cultures (hTE) were isolated as previously described (27Yamaya M. Finkbeiner W.E. Chun S.Y. Widdicombe J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L713-L724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:bronchial epithelial cell basal medium (1:1) as described by Gray et al. (28Gray T. Guzman K. Davis C. Abdullah L. Nettesheim P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Compared with our previous report (13Fischer H. Widdicombe J.H. Illek B. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C736-C743Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), this is a change in culture conditions, which resulted in epithelial cultures with significantly lower transepithelial resistances (Rt = 569 ± 36 Ω·cm2, n = 12) and higher potentials (Vt = –26.0 ± 2.1 mV). Sachs et al. described the effects of both culture conditions (29Sachs L.A. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 2003; 39: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Calu-3 cells, a human airway cell line with characteristics of airway serous cells (30Shen B.Q. Finkbeiner W.E. Wine J.J. Mrsny R.J. Widdicombe J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L493-L501PubMed Google Scholar), were grown in a Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 mix supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For patch clamping or measurement of intracellular pH (pHi), cells were seeded on collagen-coated glass coverslips and used after 1–2 days. For transepithelial measurements and for biochemical assays, cells were grown on permeable filters (Snapwell, 0.4-μm pore size, 1-cm2 area; Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) to confluency at an air-liquid interface. Confluent Calu-3 monolayers had Rt = 267 ± 34 Ω·cm2 and Vt = –5.6 ± 0.7 mV (n = 18). Some cultures were treated for 1 h with 100 μm ZnCl2 (mucosally) or for 14–16 h with the NADPH oxidase blockers 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF, 500 μm (31Diatchuk V. Lotan O. Koshkin V. Wikstroem P. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13292-13301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar)) or acetovanillone (500 μm (32Stolk J. Hiltermann T. Dijkman J. Verhoeven A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar)) in the cell culture medium. Whole Cell Patch Clamp Recordings—Cells were whole cell patchclamped as previously described (13Fischer H. Widdicombe J.H. Illek B. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C736-C743Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 33Illek B. Fischer H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L902-L910PubMed Google Scholar). On an inverted microscope cells were bathed in (in millimolar): 120 Hepes, 70 gluconic acid, 100 trimethylammonium hydroxide, 2 calcium gluconate, 1 magnesium gluconate (pH 7.3). Pipettes were filled with (in millimolar): 100 MES, 60 gluconic acid, 90 trimethylammonium hydroxide, 10 EGTA, 1 glucose, 1 magnesium gluconate, 3.3 magnesium ATP, 0.07 lithium GTP (pH 5.3). Junction potentials at the electrodes were measured, zeroed, and carefully observed for stability. Noted instabilities were smaller than ±2 mV. With these solutions pipette resistance was ∼8 MΩ. After establishing the whole cell configuration the membrane potential was continuously clamped to –50 mV and pulsed every 14 s for 6 s to 20 mV. The access resistance (Ra) and the cell membrane capacitance (Cm) were measured by fitting the current transients caused by a 10-mV pulse with a single exponential. Current-voltage step protocols from –80 mV to +40 mV were applied, and resulting step-currents were recorded. Time constants of current activation (τ) during voltage pulses were fitted with a single exponential of the form I(t) = A · e(–t/τ) + K, where t is time, I(t) is the time-dependent current, A is the amplitude of the current transient, and K is a constant current offset. Whole cell conductance was calculated from steady-state currents as the chord conductance measured between –50 mV and +20 mV. For the calculation of the specific membrane conductance (Gm in picosiemens (pS)/picofarad (pF)) the whole cell conductance was corrected for Ra (on average, 22 ± 5 mΩ (hTE) and 30 ± 3 mΩ (Calu-3)) and normalized to Cm with Gm = (Gc–1 – Ra)–1·Cm–1. Patch clamp recordings and fits were done using pClamp 8 (Axon Instruments, Fremont, CA). Currents during current-voltage step protocols were sampled at 500 Hz and filtered at 200 Hz. For the plots in the figures, currents are shown sampled at 50 Hz by averaging adjacent samples. In the figures original currents are shown without leak subtraction or corrections. Measurements were done at 26 °C. Quantification of Proton Secretion—Proton secretion was measured using the pH-stat titration technique in an Ussing chamber as described previously (13Fischer H. Widdicombe J.H. Illek B. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C736-C743Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were bathed serosally with Hepes-buffered solution and mucosally with buffer-free solution (3 ml each). Solutions were constantly gassed with oxygen and were nominally free of HCO–3/CO2. Standard NaCl Ringer solutions contained (in millimolar): mucosal, 140 NaCl, 2 KCl, 15 glucose, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2; serosal, 140 NaCl, 2 KCl, 5 glucose, 10 Hepes, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2 (pH 7.3) with HCl/NaOH. During the experiment the pH of the mucosal solution was continuously measured and titrated to a target value of pH 7.3 (range, 7.25–7.35) with 10 mm NaOH to determine H+ secretion (JH) by the cultures. Rates are expressed in nmol·h–1·cm–2, and positive rates refer to acidification of the mucosal medium. Measurements were done at 37 °C. Molecular Expression of NADPH Oxidase Subunits—Total RNA was prepared from 2 × 105 hTE and Calu-3 cells, respectively, grown on permeable filter supports, and poly(A) mRNA was isolated using the RNeasy and Oligotex mRNA kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed using 100 ng of mRNA, 40 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, 20 units of RNase inhibitor, 4 μl of 5× buffer (Roche Applied Science), 2 μl of 5 mm dNTP, and 2.5 μm random hexamer oligonucleotides (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for 60 min at 42 °C. One microliter of first strand cDNA was used as template in polymerase chain reactions with NADPH oxidase-specific oligonucleotides (see Table I). PCR was performed in a DNA thermal cycler using AmpliTaq Gold® DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). Following a 10-min 94 °C incubation, reactions proceeded for 30 s at 94 °C then 60 s at 60 °C for 43 cycles followed by 7 min at 72 °C. One-tenth of the amplification products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. For quantitative PCR total RNA was isolated from hTE and analyzed using an ABI Prizm 7700 sequence detection system (PE Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Samples were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.Table IPCR primers for Nox isoforms, subunits, and control genesGeneGenBank™ accession no.Forward primerReverse primerNox1AF166327tatgaagtggctgtgctggtgaggttgtggtctgcacactgNox2NM_000397tgttcagctatgaggtggtgatcagattggtggcgttattgNox3NM_015718tcacaaactggtcgcctatgagggttccttgccagaaaatNox4NM_016931gctggaggcattggagtaacaccaacggaaggactggataNox5aThe primer for AF317889 does not distinguish between different Nox5 isoforms.AF317889actatctggctgcacattcgacactcctcgacagcctcttDuox1AF213465cgacattgagactgagttgactggaatgacgttaccttctDuox2AF267981aacctaagcagctcacaactcagagagcaatgatggtgatp22phoxNM_000101tcctgcatctcctgctctccacagccgccagtaggtagp40phoxNM_013416cgaggaggagagaggcttcatagcggcggtagatgagctap47phoxNM_000265tgccaactacgagaagacctcacagaaccaccaaccgctctp67phoxM32011cggacaagaaggactggaagacatgcagccaatgttgaagGAPDHbGAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.NM_002046tcaagaaggtggtgaagcagtcgctgttgaagtcagaggaActinBC016045gatcattgctcctcctgagctactcctgcttgctgatccaa The primer for AF317889 does not distinguish between different Nox5 isoforms.b GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Open table in a new tab Immunodetection of Duox—For immunoblotting, hTE cultures were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and cells were transferred directly into SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 6% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 1% casein and probed with a rabbit anti-Duox antibody (kindly provided by F. Miot (22De Deken X. Wang D. Many M.-C. Costagliola S. Libert F. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. Miot F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23227-23233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar)), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibody labeling was visualized using the ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences). For immunocytochemistry, hTE cells were dissected from confluent cultures, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, and incubated with 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 followed by 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were immunostained for Duox, and the tight junction protein ZO-1 was used as a marker of the apical region using a monoclonal anti-ZO-1 antibody (BD Biosciences). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes) for Duox and Alexa Fluor 546 anti-mouse for ZO-1. Cells were embedded in Crystal Mount (Biomedia) and observed with a 63×/1.4 numerical aperture oil-immersion objective on a Solamere spinning disc confocal microscope (excitation, 457 nm; emission, 535 ± 20 nm for Duox, and excitation, 514 nm; emission, 605 ± 30 nm for ZO-1). Measurement of Intracellular pH (pHi)—Cells on glass coverslips were incubated for 30 min with 20 μm BCECF-AM (2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester, Molecular Probes Inc.), washed, and allowed to cleave the dye for 60 min. Cellular fluorescence was investigated in an open perfusion chamber on an inverted microscope. Excitation wavelengths were 440 and 495 nm, and emission was collected between 525 and 550 nm with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics CoolSnap HQ, Roper Scientific) controlled by a computerized imaging system (Metafluor, Universal Imaging Corp.). Emission intensities of individual cells were background-subtracted, and ratios of 495 to 440 nm were calculated. pHi was calculated from ratios using a four-point pH calibration in presence of 20 μm nigericin in KCl solution. Calibration points were pH 7.5, 7, 6.5, and 6.0. Resulting calibration ratios for individual cells were fitted to second order polynomials, and fitted parameters were used to calculate pHi from measured ratios. Individual rates of acidification of cells during the first 15 min of treatment with amiloride were determined by linear regression. Dye loading and experiments were done at 26 °C. NaCl solution composition was (in millimolar) 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 12.5 Hepes (pH 7.4). pH calibration was performed in (in millimolar) 5 NaCl, 145 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and Hepes and/or MES (total buffer 12.5 mm). Statistics—Data are presented as original values or as mean ± S.E.; n refers to the number of cells or tissues investigated. Effects were tested with t tests or with ANOVAs followed by Bonferroni-corrected t tests. Calculations were done with StatView (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). Calculated p values are given, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Proton Conductances in Airway Cells—Single hTE and Calu-3 cells were whole cell patch-clamped to characterize and compare their H+ conductance under conditions selective for H+ currents with a pipette to bath pH gradient of 5.3 to 7.3. Calu-3 are large round cells with an average Cm of 29.9 ± 5.9 pF (n = 7). hTE were visibly smaller with a Cm of 10.4 ± 1.4 pF (n = 6, significantly lower than Calu-3, p = 0.012, t test). hTE had visible cilia on one pole of the elongated cells. Reported conductances were normalized to Cm to account for the difference in cell size. Measured currents were identified as H+ currents by the established characteristics: (i) H+-selective reversal potentials, (ii) zinc sensitivity, and (iii) activation by depolarization with time constants in the order of seconds (34DeCoursey T.E. Morgan D. Cherny V.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 773-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Both airway cell types expressed whole cell H+ currents, H+-selective reversal potentials, and activation by depolarizing pulses. Continuous H+ current recordings and block by ZnSO4 are shown in Fig. 1A for hTE and Fig. 1B for Calu-3. During the recordings the membrane potential was clamped to –50 mV and pulsed to 20 mV (as shown in the voltage traces, lower panels of Fig. 1, A and B) to continuously monitor the depolarization activation of H+ currents. Note the typically slow current activation during the pulses in both cell types. Addition of 100 μm ZnSO4 to the bath fully blocked the depolarization-activated currents. The current responses to the voltage step protocols from Fig. 1 (A and B) are shown in detail in Fig. 1 (C and D) for both cell types before (top panels) and after (bottom panels) addition of 100 μm ZnSO4. Outward H+ currents activated slowly during depolarizing potentials and were blocked after addition of ZnSO4. Steady-state current-voltage relations are shown in Fig. 2 (E and F). Current-voltage relations recorded under control conditions (triangles) showed outward rectification and negative reversal potentials indicative for H+ currents. Control steady-state currents reversed at –21.6 ± 4.7 mV (hTE) and –25.9 ± 6.1 mV (Calu-3). Addition of Zn2+ shifted the reversal potential to positive values in both cell types (Fig. 1, E and F, circles, by on average 37.8 ± 3.5 mV, n = 11; not different between cell types). On average, hTE and Calu-3 expressed similar specific H+ conductances of 19.6 ± 3.1 pS/pF and 11.6 ± 2.8 pS/pF, respectively (p = 0.085, Fig. 1G).Fig. 2Time constants of voltage-activated H+ currents. A and B, membrane potential was stepped from –50 to 20 mV or 40 mV (as indicated) in hTE (A) or Calu-3 (B). Dots are sampled current data; the line shows the best fit to a single exponential function; the width of samples is 20 ms. Fitted time constants are: hTE, τ40 = 2.23 s, τ20 = 3.14 s; Calu-3, from τ40 = 3.68 s, τ20 = 6.9 s. C, average time constants during depolarizing pulses –50 mV to 20 mV or to 40 mV as indicated. Time constants were not different between cell types (p = 0.1) but τ20 (3.9 ± 0.5 s) was significantly longer than τ40 (2.8 ± 0.4 ms, p = 0.01, two-way ANOVA, n = 6 hTE and n = 7 Calu-3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As a biophysical identifier of the H+ conductance we used the time constants of current activation when stepping the membrane potential from –50 mV to 20 mV (τ20) and from –50 mV to 40 mV (τ40). Fig. 2 shows current activations evoked by voltage pulses in hTE (Fig. 2A) and Calu-3 (Fig. 2B). In both cell types the depolarization-activated currents were fitted well with a single exponential (lines in Fig. 2, A and B) yielding τ20 and τ40 (Fig. 2C). Fitted time constants at either potential were not different between cell types (p > 0.4, t tests) suggesting that hTE and Calu-3 cells expressed a biophysically similar type of H+ conductance. On average τ20 = 3.97 ± 0.52 s and τ40 = 2.77 ± 0.39 s. τ20 was significantly longer than τ40 (p = 0.01), consistent with a voltage-activated opening transition. For comparison, the native H+ conductance of rat alveolar cells (τ40 = 2.5 s (35Cherny V.V. DeCoursey T.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 819-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar)) or eosinophils (τ40 = 2.4 s (36Banfi B. Schrenzel J. Nusse O. Lew D.P. Ligeti E. Krause K.-H. Demaurex N. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)) showed values similar to our data under comparable recording conditions. These data showed that hTE and Calu-3 cells expressed functionally similar H+ conductances, as judged by the quantitatively similar average conductances, rates of voltage-activated currents, and zinc sensitivity. Acid Secretion by hTE and Calu-3 Cultures—Acid secretion of intact epithelia was measured using the pH-stat titration technique in Ussing chambers. Block of H+ channels (by ZnCl2) and block of NADPH oxidase (by acetovanillone or AEBSF) was used to 1) determine the role of H+ channels in epithelial acid secretion, 2) verify an apical location of H+ channels in polarized epithelial monolayers, and 3) determine the role of NADPH oxidase during acid secretion. Both cell types showed basal acid secretion into the mucosal compartment. In hTE, JH = 939 ± 49 nmol·h–1·cm–2, n = 12. Calu-3 showed a 9-fold smaller JH of 106 ± 9 nmol·h–1·cm–2, n = 18 (p < 0.0001, Fig. 3). When cultures were pre-treated for 1 h with ZnCl2 (100 μm mucosally), acid secretion by hTE was significantly reduced (to 480 ± 29 nmol·h–1·cm–2, n = 6, p < 0.0001, unpaired t test). In contrast, no significant effect of ZnCl2 was found on acid secretion by Calu-3 (block to 84 ± 4 nmol·h–1·cm–2, n = 5, p = 0.2, Fig. 3). In addition we tested the NADPH oxidase blockers AEBSF and acetovanillone (500 μm each) on H+ secretion by hTE and Calu-3. After incubation of cultures for 14–16 h with blockers, H+ secretion was inhibited significantly in hTE (p < 0.0001, ANOVA) but not in Calu-3 (Fig. 2). In hTE, AEBSF reduced JH to 515 ± 49 nmol·h–1·cm–2, and acetovanillone reduced JH to 606 ± 58 nmol·h–1·cm–2. These values were not different from inhibition of acid secretion achieved with ZnCl2. The remaining H+ secretion in hTE was partially blocked by apical ouabain (50 μm, by 15 ± 5.8%, n = 7, different from zero, p = 0.04) and apical bafilomycin A1 (100 nm, by 11 ± 3.9%, n = 7, different from zero, p = 0.04) indicating that hTE expressed additional mechanisms for acid secretion (12Coakley R.D.

NNK significantly contributes to smoking-related lung cancer, but the molecular mechanism remains enigmatic. Bcl2 and c-Myc are two major oncogenic proteins that cooperatively promote tumor development. We report here that NNK simultaneously stimulates Bcl2 phosphorylation exclusively at Ser70 and c-Myc at Thr58 and Ser62 through activation of both ERK1/2 and PKCα, which is required for NNK-induced survival and proliferation of human lung cancer cells. Treatment of cells with staurosporine or PD98059 blocks both Bcl2 and c-Myc phosphorylation and results in suppression of NNK-induced proliferation. Specific depletion of c-Myc expression by RNA interference retards G1/S cell cycle transition and blocks NNK-induced cell proliferation. Phosphorylation of Bcl2 at Ser70 promotes a direct interaction between Bcl2 and c-Myc in the nucleus and on the outer mitochondrial membrane that significantly enhances the half-life of the c-Myc protein. Thus, NNK-induced functional cooperation of Bcl2 and c-Myc in promoting cell survival and proliferation may occur in a novel mechanism involving their phosphorylation, which may lead to development of human lung cancer and/or chemoresistance.

Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 559-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 5Hoffmann D. Rivenson A. Hecht S.S. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1996; 26: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cigarette smoke contains a substantial amount of NNK, and the total dose experienced by a smoker in a lifetime of smoking is remarkably close to the lowest dose shown to induce lung cancer in rats (5Hoffmann D. Rivenson A. Hecht S.S. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1996; 26: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, NNK is considered to be a major contributor to lung carcinogenesis in smokers (6Schuller H.M. Nat. Rev. 2002; 2: 455-463Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 7Schuller H.M. Plummer H.K. Jull B.A. Anat. Rec. 2003; 270: 51-58Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar).It has been demonstrated that NNK induces DNA damage, including single-strand DNA breaks, alkylphosphotriester formation (8Cloutier J.F. Drouin R. Weinfeld M. O'Connor T.R. Castonguay A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), DNA adduct formation, increased oxidative stress (9Bhagwat S.V. Vijayasarathy C. Raza H. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), as well as induction of p53 and Ras mutations (6Schuller H.M. Nat. Rev. 2002; 2: 455-463Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 8Cloutier J.F. Drouin R. Weinfeld M. O'Connor T.R. Castonguay A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Traditional views have emphasized the formation of promutagenic DNA adducts from reactive metabolites of NNK (10Hecht S.S. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1996; 26: 163-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and resulting point mutations in the k-Ras gene (11Belinsky S.A. Devereux T.R. Anderson M.W. Mutat. Res. 1990; 233: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) as important mediators of smoking-associated lung carcinogenesis. However, k-Ras mutations are absent in small cell lung cancer (SCLC; Ref. 12Mitsudomi T. Viallet J. Mulshine J.L. Linnoila R.I. Minna J.D. Gazdar A.F. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1353-1362PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of these mutations strongly suggests that the development of SCLC may be caused by cellular events other than Ras mutations. In the search for potential mechanisms of SCLC development, our studies focus on the role of NNK-associated signal transduction pathways.In addition to DNA damage, the mechanisms that promote cellular survival and proliferation may be the critical steps in NNK-initiated carcinogenesis. NNK, a nicotine-nitrosated carcinogenic derivative, retains some structural similarities with nicotine and binds to the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR), resulting in the influx of Ca2+, release of 5-hydroxytryptamine, and activation of a protein kinase cascade (i.e. PKC/Raf-1/MEK/ERK1/2; Refs. 6Schuller H.M. Nat. Rev. 2002; 2: 455-463Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar and 7Schuller H.M. Plummer H.K. Jull B.A. Anat. Rec. 2003; 270: 51-58Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the downstream survival and proliferative substrates of NNK-activated protein kinases have not been identified.Among the known proto-oncogenes, the cellular Myc gene (c-Myc) is one of those most frequently implicated in carcinogenesis (13Bissonnette R.P. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Nature. 1992; 359: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 14Soucie E.L. Annis M.G. Sedivy J. Filmus J. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Penn L.Z. Mol. Cell.

Deregulated expression of the structurally unaltered Myc protein is sufficient to drive continuous cell proliferation and apoptosis in response to growth-promoting and growth-inhibitory signals, respectively (14Soucie E.L. Annis M.G. Sedivy J. Filmus J. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Penn L.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4725-4736Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Expression of c-Myc can initiate proliferation and increase sensitivity to apoptosis under low serum conditions when antiapoptotic mechanisms are not activated (16Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 119-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). Bcl2 and c-Myc are two major oncogenic proteins that can functionally cooperate in cell proliferation, transformation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis (17Reed J.C. Cuddy M. Haldar S. Croce C. Nowell P. Makover D. Bradley K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3660-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To avoid c-Myc-induced cell death and ensure continuous cell proliferation, Bcl2 functions as one of the most potent Myc-cooperating oncoproteins (13Bissonnette R.P. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Nature. 1992; 359: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 18Fanidi A. Harrington E.A. Evan G.I. Nature. 1992; 359: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar), which is a global inhibitor of apoptosis, likely through multiple mechanisms (14Soucie E.L. Annis M.G. Sedivy J. Filmus J. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Penn L.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4725-4736Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19Deng X. Ruvolo P. Carr B. May Jr., W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1578-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Bcl2 can specifically abrogate c-Myc-induced apoptosis without affecting the c-Myc mitogenic function (18Fanidi A. Harrington E.A. Evan G.I. Nature. 1992; 359: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which Bcl2 cooperates with c-Myc remains unclear. Because both Bcl2 and c-Myc are expressed in SCLC and non-SCLC cells (20Ikegaki N. Katsumata M. Minna J. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6-8PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bepler G. Bading H. Heimann B. Kiefer P. Havemann K. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 45-50PubMed Google Scholar), these two oncoproteins may be regulated by NNK-activated signal pathways in human lung cancer cells. NNK may facilitate a functional cooperation between Bcl2 and c-Myc that contributes to lung cancer development and proliferation of tumor cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—NNK was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada).

Proteinase K was purchased from Invitrogen. All of the reagents used were obtained from commercial sources unless otherwise stated.Cell Lines, Plasmids, and Transfections—NCI-H82, NCI-H69, and H1299 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum. Nucleotides corresponding to each serine or threonine residue in Bcl2 or c-Myc cDNA were substituted to create a conservative alteration to alanine or glutamine with a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech). Each single mutant was confirmed by sequencing of the cDNA and was then cloned into the pCIneo (Promega) or pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) mammalian expression vector. The pCIneo plasmid containing each Bcl2 mutant cDNA was transfected into NCI-H82 cells by electroporation. Clones stably expressing WT or mutant Bcl2 were selected in a medium containing G418 (0.6 mg/ml). The expression levels of exogenous Bcl2 were compared by Western blot analysis. Three separate clones for each mutant expressing similar amounts of exogenous Bcl2 were selected for further analysis. The pcDNA3.1 plasmids bearing WT or T58A/S62A (AA) c-Myc mutant were transfected into H1299 cells using LipofectAMINE™ 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The expression levels of exogenous c-Myc were analyzed by Western blot analysis using c-Myc antibody.Protein Isolation—The cells were washed with 1× PBS and resuspended in ice-cold EBC buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) with protease inhibitor mixture set I (Calbiochem). The cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was collected as the total cell lysate as described (22Chen G. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33693-33697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).Metabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—The cells were washed with phosphate-free RPMI medium and metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid for 90 min. After agonist or inhibitor addition, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in detergent buffer. Bcl2 was then immunoprecipitated as described previously (19Deng X.

The samples were subjected to 10-20% gradient SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film for the times indicated at -80 °C. Bcl2 phosphorylation was determined by autoradiography. The same filter was then probed by Western blotting analysis with a Bcl2 antibody and developed using an ECL Kit (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (23Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar).Pulse-Chase Analysis of the c-Myc Half-Life—The cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 60 min. The [35S]methionine-labeled cells were washed and incubated in fresh methionine replete RPMI 1640 medium for various time points up to 60 min. The cells were harvested at each time point, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in EBC buffer, and 35S-labeled-c-Myc was immunoprecipitated using c-Myc antibody. The Bcl2-associated c-Myc (i.e. Bound c-Myc) was coimmunoprecipitated using Bcl2 antibody, and the unbound c-Myc was then immunoprecipitated with c-Myc antibody from the same lysate. The samples were subjected to 10-20% gradient SDS-PAGE. The half-life of c-Myc was determined by electronic autoradiography as described (24Deng X. Gao F. Flagg T. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).Assay of PKCα Activity and Phosphorylation of c-Myc and Bcl2 in Vitro—PKCα was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with PKCα antibody following treatment with NNK. Immunoprecipitated PKCα was suspended in 50 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 μm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μg/ml histone-1, 100 μm ATP, 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 0.03% Triton X-100. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiling the sample for 5 min. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. The activities of PKCα were determined by autoradiography. To assess phosphorylation of Bcl2 and c-Myc in vitro, Bcl2 or c-Myc was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using Bcl2 or c-Myc antibody, respectively. The immune complex was then incubated with purified, activated PKCα (Panvera, Madison, WI), ERK1, or ERK2 (Calbiochem) in assay buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (19Deng X. Ruvolo P. Carr B. May Jr., W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1578-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Bcl2 or c-Myc was analyzed by autoradiography.Subcellular Fractionation—The cells (2 × 107) were washed once with cold 1× PBS and resuspended in isotonic mitochondrial buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitor mixture set I. The resuspended cells were homogenized with a polytron homogenizer operating for four bursts of 10 s each at a setting of 5 and then centrifuged at 2000 × g for 3 min to pellet the nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min to pellet mitochondria as described (25Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Sanchez B. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11615-11623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The supernatant was further centrifuged at 150,000 × g to pellet light membranes. The resulting supernatant contained the cytosolic fractions. The mitochondria was washed with mitochondrial buffer twice, resuspended with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, rocked for 60 min, and then centrifuged at 17,530 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing mitochondrial proteins was collected. For nuclear fractionation, the cells were washed with 1× PBS and suspended in 2 ml of Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.03% Nonidet P-40 with fresh protease inhibitor mixture set I). The samples were incubated on ice until more than 95% of cells could be stained by trypan blue. The samples were then centrifuged at 500 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The resulting nuclear pellet was washed with Buffer B (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine) and then resuspended in 150 μl of Buffer C (350 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine) and rocked at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation (14, 000 × g)at4 °C, the supernatant (nuclear fraction) was collected (26Zhou B.P. Liao Y. Xia W. Spohn B. Lee M.H. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Protein (100 μg) from each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using Bcl2 or c-Myc antibody, respectively. The purity of the fractions was confirmed by assessing localization of fraction-specific proteins including prohibitin (a mitochondrial marker; Ref. 27Ikonen E. Fiedler K. Parton R.G. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (a nuclear marker; Refs. 28Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T.

Science. 1990; 69: 121-129Google Scholar).Treatment of Mitochondria with Proteinase K in vitro—Mitochondrial fractions were collected as described above. Purified mitochondria were treated with various concentrations of proteinase K (i.e. 2, 5, 25, 50, and 100 μg/ml) for 25 min on ice. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was then added to a final concentration of 2 mm, and the samples were incubated for another 10 min on ice as described (30Gao S. Chen J. Brodsky S.V. Huang H. Adler S. Lee J.H. Dhadwal N. Gould L.C. Gross S. Goligorsky M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15968-15974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min and then washed twice with isotonic mitochondria buffer. The pellets were resuspended in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and rocked for 60 min and then centrifuged at 17,530 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein (100 μg) from the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using Bcl2 or c-Myc antibody, respectively.Cell Viability Assay—The apoptotic and viable cells were detected using an ApoAlert Annexin-V kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The percentage of annexin-Vlow cells (percentage of viable cells) or annexin-Vhigh cells (percentage of apoptotic cells) was determined using the data obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis as described (31Deng X. Xiao L. Lang W. Gao F. Ruvolo P. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23681-23688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Cell viability was also confirmed using the trypan blue dye exclusion method (19Deng X. Ruvolo P. Carr B. May Jr., W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1578-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar).Cell Proliferation Assay—NCI-H82 or NCI-H69 cells were seeded at a concentration of 2 × 104 cells/well in 100 μl of culture medium and treated with NNK in the absence or presence of various inhibitors. Cell proliferation was assessed using a WTS-1 kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). This is a colorimetric assay for the quantification of cell proliferation, based on the cleavage of the tetrazolium salt WST-1 by mitochondrial dehydrogenases in viable cells. The absorbance of the samples was analyzed using a microplate (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) reader.c-Myc Silence—This is a technique for down-regulating the expression of a specific gene in living cells by introducing a homologous double-stranded RNA. NCI-H69 cells were transfected with c-Myc siRNA according to the siPORT lipid siRNA transfection protocol from the manufacturer (Ambion Inc). A control siRNA (nonhomologous to any known gene sequence) was used as a negative control. The levels of c-Myc expression were analyzed by Western blotting. Cell viability or proliferation was assessed following various treatments. Specific silencing of the targeted c-Myc gene was confirmed by at least three independent experiments.RESULTSNNK Simultaneously Induces Phosphorylation of Both Bcl2 and c-Myc, Which Is Associated with Increased Proliferation of SCLC Cells—The tobacco-specific lung carcinogen NNK functions as a site-selective and high affinity agonist for the α7 nAChR (7Schuller H.M. Plummer H.K. Jull B.A. Anat. Rec. 2003; 270: 51-58Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 32Jull B.A. Plummer H.K. Schuller H.M. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2001; 127: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Interaction of NNK with the α7 nAChR results in activation of PKC/RAF/MEK/ERK1/2 protein kinase cascade that may promote lung cancer development and proliferation of tumor cells (7Schuller H.M. Plummer H.K. Jull B.A. Anat. Rec. 2003; 270: 51-58Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Bcl2 and c-Myc have been demonstrated to be two functional cooperative oncoproteins that are expressed in both SCLC and non-SCLC cells (Fig. 1A and Refs. 18Fanidi A. Harrington E.A. Evan G.I. Nature. 1992; 359: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 20Ikegaki N. Katsumata M. Minna J. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6-8PubMed Google Scholar, and 21Bepler G. Bading H. Heimann B. Kiefer P. Havemann K. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 45-50PubMed Google Scholar). Bcl2 functions as a potent antiapoptotic molecule, and phosphorylation of Bcl2 in the flexible loop domain can positively regulate its survival function (19Deng X. Ruvolo P. Carr B. May Jr., W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1578-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 23Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 33Mai H. May W.S. Gao F. Jin Z. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1886-1891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In contrast, the c-Myc protein, encoded by the c-Myc proto-oncogene, is a potent inducer of both cell proliferation and apoptosis (34Juin P. Hueber A.O. Littlewood T. Evan G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1367-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of c-Myc has been reported to enhance both its proliferation and apoptotic functions (35Conzen S.D. Gottlob K. Kandel E.S. Khanduri P. Wagner A.J. O'Leary M. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6008-6018Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 36Sears R. Nevins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11617-11620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 37Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). NNK may functionally facilitate a cooperation of Bcl2 and c-Myc in a mechanism involving their phosphorylation. To experimentally test this, SCLC H69 cells expressing endogenous Bcl2 and c-Myc were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid and treated with NNK (100 pm) for various times as indicated. Bcl2 phosphorylation was analyzed by autoradiography. Phosphorylation of c-Myc was assessed by Western blot using a phospho-specific c-Myc antibody. Results indicate that NNK induces Bcl2 phosphorylation with a peak at 15 min (Fig. 1B). Simultaneously, NNK induces c-Myc phosphorylation at Thr58 and Ser62 as determined by using a Thr58/Ser62 dual phosphospecific c-Myc antibody that only recognizes the dual phosphorylated c-Myc (Fig. 1B and Ref. 32Jull B.A. Plummer H.K. Schuller H.M. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2001; 127: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Because growth curves show that NNK significantly stimulates proliferation (Fig. 1C), this suggests that NNK-induced proliferation of lung cancer cells may occur through phosphorylation of Bcl2 and c-Myc to facilitate their cooperation. We chose H69 cells for testing the effect of NNK on Bcl2 and c-Myc phosphorylation because high levels of endogenous Bcl2 and c-Myc are expressed in H69 cells (Fig. 1A). Thus, the results obtained from this cell line may have more physiological relevance.Knockdown of c-Myc Expression by RNA Interference Blocks NNK-induced Proliferation of Human Lung Cancer Cells—Previous studies reveal that expression of endogenous c-Myc in human lung cancer cells is associated with high proliferative activity (21Bepler G. Bading H. Heimann B. Kiefer P. Havemann K. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 45-50PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether c-Myc is required for NNK-stimulated lung cancer cell proliferation, an RNA interference approach was employed. It has recently been demonstrated that 21-base double-stranded siRNA is a potent mediator of the RNA interference effect in mammalian cells (38Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschi T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8075) Google Scholar). H69 cells were transfected with c-Myc siRNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results show that the c-Myc siRNA efficiently and specifically reduces c-Myc expression in SCLC H69 cells, whereas control siRNA has no effect (Fig. 2A). In contrast to the control, knockdown of c-Myc expression reduces the percentage of cells in the S phase (i.e. 18.41% versus 47.53%) with a greater percentage of cells in the G0-G1 phase (66.14% versus 35.99%; Fig. 2B). Importantly, depletion of c-Myc expression by RNA interference significantly inhibits NNK-induced cell proliferation (Fig. 2C). These findings suggest that expression of c-Myc may be essential for G1/S cell cycle transition as well as NNK-stimulated proliferation of SCLC H69 cells.Fig. 2Depletion of c-Myc expression by RNA interference inhibits G1/S cell cycle transition as well as NNK-induced proliferation of human lung cancer cells.A, NCI-H69 cells were transfected with c-Myc siRNA or control siRNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Expression levels of c-Myc or Bcl2 were analyzed by Western blotting using c-Myc or Bcl2 antibody, respectively. B, NCI-H69 cells were transfected with c-Myc siRNA or control siRNA as described above. Cell cycle status was analyzed by flow cytometry following PI staining.

https://openalex.org/W2039181024,"The potent human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis persists in macrophages within a specialized, immature phagosome by interfering with the pathway of phagolysosome biogenesis. The molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain to be fully elucidated. Here, using four-dimensional microscopy, we detected on model phagosomes, which normally mature into phagolysosomes, the existence of cyclical waves of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), a membrane trafficking regulatory lipid essential for phagosomal acquisition of lysosomal characteristics. We show that mycobacteria interfere with the dynamics of PI3P on phagosomal organelles by altering the timing and characteristics of the PI3P waves on phagosomes. The default program of cyclical PI3P waves on model phagosomes is composed of an initial stage (phase I), represented by a strong PI3P burst occurring only upon the completion of phagosome formation, and a subsequent stage (phase II) of recurring PI3P waves on maturing phagosomes with the average periodicity of 20 min. Mycobacteria alter this program in two ways: (i) by inducing, in a cholesterol-dependent fashion, a neophase I* of premature PI3P production, coinciding with the process of mycobacterial entry into the macrophage, and (ii) by inhibiting the calmodulin-dependent phase II responsible for the acquisition of lysosomal characteristics. We conclude that the default pathway of phagosomal maturation into the phagolysosome includes temporally organized cyclical waves of PI3P on phagosomal membranes and that this process is targeted for reprogramming by mycobacteria as they prevent phagolysosome formation.

Phagocytosis is a fundamental biological process essential for proper tissue homeostasis, development, elimination of invading microorganisms, and processing of antigens for presentation to the immune system.

Maturation of the phagosome into the phagolysosome is a multistage membrane trafficking and protein sorting process, and a significant portion of the current knowledge regarding phagosomal maturation comes from studies of phagosomes containing intracellular pathogens (10Meresse S.

Because intracellular pathogens interfere with various steps in phagolysosomal biogenesis, they have been employed as convenient tools to dissect different aspects of phagosomal maturation (10Meresse S.

In general, upon phagocytosis or invasion, an intracellular pathogen that specializes in parasitizing host cells can follow one of the following routes: (i) lysis of the phagosome and escape into the cytosol (17Dramsi S. Cossart P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 943-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); (ii) unscheduled fusion with intracellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum (18Kagan J.C.

A recent follow-up study has examined the possible roles of Rab5 effectors in phagosome maturation (27Fratti R.A. Backer J.M. Gruenberg J. Corvera S. Deretic V. J.

(27Fratti R.A. Backer J.M. Gruenberg J. Corvera S. Deretic V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). EEA1 is a membrane-tethering molecule that is recruited to phagosomal surfaces via a bipartite mechanism, which comprises a binding process to Rab5 and association with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) on target membranes (28Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). EEA1 is required for the PI3P-dependent delivery of hydrolases and the H+ ATPase Vo subunit from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the phagosome (23Fratti R.A. Chua J. Vergne I. Deretic V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5437-5442Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The role in phagosomal maturation of phosphoinositide-interacting regulators of trafficking, such as EEA1, underscores the significance of phosphatidylinositol (PI) derivatives in phagosome and phagolysosome biogenesis. PI derivatives regulate diverse trafficking processes by affecting the localization and activity of effector proteins containing lipid binding modules such as C2, ENTH, FERM, FYVE, PH, and PX domains (29Lemmon M.A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). A subset of PI derivatives and lipid-binding proteins also plays a role in phagocytosis and phagolysosome biogenesis. Phagocytosis triggers production of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which recruits actin to the phagocytic cup; this is followed by disappearance of PIP2 as the phagosome seals (9Botelho R.J.

Cammer M. Chinegwundoh J.O. Dale B.M. Cheney R.E. Greenberg S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Another phosphoinositide, PI3P, has recently received more attention, because it is important for those stages in phagosomal maturation that follow the initial particle uptake (27Fratti R.A. Backer J.M. Gruenberg J. Corvera S. Deretic V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 32Vieira O.V. Botelho R.J. Rameh L. Brachmann S.M. Matsuo T. Davidson H.W.

In this work, we show, using phagosomal organelles as a model system, that PI3P formation on endomembranes is not a uniform event and that it functions as a timer within a programmed pathway of phagolysosome biogenesis. We furthermore show that M. tuberculosis reprograms PI3P waves on phagosomal membranes as a strategy for blocking phagosomal conversion into the phagolysosome, underscoring the significance of the PI3P cycling on organellar membranes. Cell and Bacterial Culture—Murine bone marrow-derived macrophages were isolated from the femurs of C57/BL6 mice and maintained in DME supplemented with 4 mm l-glutamine, 20% FBS, and macrophage-colony stimulating factor for 7 days prior to plating onto coverslips. The murine macrophage-like cell line RAW 264.7 was maintained in DME supplemented with 4 mm l-glutamine and 10% FBS. COS-7 cells were grown as described previously (44Lawe D. Sitouah N. Hayes S. Chawla A. Virbasius J. Tuft R. Fogarty K. Lifshitz L. Lambright D. Corvera S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2935-2945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). M. tuberculosis var. bovis BCG harboring phsp60-DsRed was grown in 7H9 broth on a rotating platform and homogenized to generate a single cell suspension (Via et al. (26Via L.E. Deretic D. Ulmer R.J. Hibler N.S. Huber L.A. Deretic V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13326-13331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar)). Plasmid Constructs and Transfection—The plasmid constructs pPLC∂ PH-EGFP and pBtk PH-EGFP were from T. Balla (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), pFAPP PH-EGFP from M. A. De Matteis (Italy), p2xFYVE-EGFP from H. Stenmark (The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo, Norway), and p40phox PX-EGFP from M. Yaffe (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA). For transfection, 5 × 106 RAW 264.7 cells were resuspended in a nucleoporator buffer supplied by the manufacturer (Amaxa Biosystems) with 2 μg of plasmid DNA. Cells were nucleoporated according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were plated on 25-mm diameter coverslips and allowed to express the construct for 18 h prior to imaging experiments. Preparation of Texas Red-labeled Latex Beads and M. tuberculosis var. bovis BCG—Streptavidin-conjugated polystyrene beads were washed with 50 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6, and incubated in PBS with 5 mg/ml Texas Red-X (Molecular Probes) for 1-2 h. Beads were subsequently washed (5×) with PBS and then opsonized with 100% FBS for an additional 30 min. M. tuberculosis var. bovis BCG were washed in PBS/0.5% Tween 20 and incubated in 5 mg/ml Texas Red-X in PBS for 1-2 h. Labeled mycobacteria were washed (5×) with PBS and then opsonized with 100% FBS for an additional 30 min. Treatment with Inhibitors—CaM was inhibited by treating RAW 264.7 or COS-7 cells with 25 or 100 μm W7, respectively. W7 was added after the first PI3P burst (phase I) was ascertained following phagocytosis. CaMKII was inhibited using KN62 (2 μm). KN62 was added prior to macrophage infection with latex beads and throughout the duration of the experiment. Cholesterol was extracted, and its removal was verified by using the methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) method (45Smart E.J. Anderson R.G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 353: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 cells were incubated in 10 mm MβCD in serum-free media for 1 h prior to infection with BCG. Cells were kept in MβCD during infection and subsequent imaging. Labeling with Fluid Phase Endocytic Tracers—Transfected RAW 264.7 cells were incubated in 2.5 mg/ml Texas Red-dextran (Mr 10,000, Molecular Probes). For early endosomal labeling, cells were first infected with particles, washed (3×) with PBS, and then subsequently incubated in Texas Red-dextran for 5 min. Cells were washed (6×) with PBS prior to viewing under the microscope. For late endosomal labeling, cells were first incubated with Texas Red-dextran for 5 min, washed, and then infected with latex beads. For labeling of lysosomal compartments, cells were pulsed with dextran for 1 h, followed by a 2-h chase, and then infected with latex beads. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Bone marrow-derived macrophages grown on 25-mm glass coverslips were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde followed by membrane permeabilization using 0.2% saponin. Permeabilized cells were incubated with the probe 2xFYVE-GST (10 μg/ml, Echelon, Inc.) followed by anti-GST antibody conjugated to Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes). Epifluorescence microscopy was performed using an IX70 Olympus microscope. Images were collected and processed using LSR Esprit software. Colocalization of the PI3P probe with phagosomes was determined using methods of unbiased counting (27Fratti R.A. Backer J.M. Gruenberg J. Corvera S. Deretic V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Four-dimensional Confocal Microscopy—Live cell confocal microscopy was performed on a rotating disc confocal UltraView LCI microscope system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using argon or argon/krypton lasers and appropriate excitation dichroic and emission filters for red and green fluorescence. Transfected RAW 264.7 cells grown on 25-mm glass coverslips were allowed to phagocytose latex beads or M. tuberculosis var. bovis BCG. Infection was achieved by centrifugation of particles onto macrophages adherent to coverslips at 800 rpm for 5 min. Coverslips were transferred immediately to DME in a perfusion chamber (Harvard Apparatus) set at a constant temperature of 37 °C. Transfected cells chosen for observation were selected based on the presence of moving (Brownian motion) particles to be phagocytosed by adjacent macrophages. Rapid z-stack (controlled by using a piezoelectric device; millisecond speed range) of confocal sections spanning a total thickness of 10-15 μm were taken to ensure that all sides of the phagocytosed particles were examined for each time point regardless of object movement in or out of any given single plane of focus. Images were collected and processed using an UltraView system. Data were collected as a time lapse sequence of two separate channel/color z-stacks and processed for three-dimensional rendering (particle internalization), x-y plane projection of a range of z stacks (maximum intensity for rendering and mean-intensity for quantitative analysis), and a time-lapse sequence for supplemental movies. All procedures followed the previously published approaches for four-dimensional microscopy (46Gerlich D. Ellenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; : S14-S19PubMed Google Scholar, 47Gerlich D. Beaudouin J.

Particle Entry Determination—The entry of latex beads into the macrophages was identified by a characteristic brief immobilization, followed by a centripetal movement during internalization (confirmed by three-dimensional reconstruction). Mycobacterial entry was identified by immobilization of the bacilli upon their firm attachment to the macrophage surface, followed by the centrifugal movement of macrophage membrane along the bacterial cells (see Supplemental Movie 1 showing PIP2-labeled membranes in the process of engulfing mycobacteria). Latex bead and mycobacterial internalization and intracellular localization were additionally confirmed by differentially staining extracellular and intracellular objects (by permeabilizing or not permeabilizing the plasma membrane) in independent correlative studies. Quantitative Analysis of Four-dimensional Confocal Microscopy Data—The previously published approaches (46Gerlich D. Ellenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; : S14-S19PubMed Google Scholar, 47Gerlich D.

Maximum intensity projections and mean-intensity projections were used for rendering and quantitative analysis, respectively (46Gerlich D. Ellenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; : S14-S19PubMed Google Scholar). Diminished Levels of PI3P on Mycobacterial Phagosomes—The previously reported changes in EEA1 recruitment to M. tuberculosis phagosomes (MBPs) (27Fratti R.A. Backer J.M. Gruenberg J. Corvera S. Deretic V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) led us to hypothesize that PI3P profiles may be affected on mycobacterial phagosomes, because EEA1 binds to target membranes through association of its PI3P-binding FYVE domain with the PI3P on organellar membranes. To compare the PI3P levels on model, latex bead phagosomes (LBPs) with those on mycobacterial phagosomes, we examined by immunofluorescence microscopy the PI3P staining in macrophages using a PI3P affinity probe (2xFYVE-GST) (36Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J.M. Parton R.G. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Murine bone marrow-derived macrophages were allowed to phagocytose complement-opsonized 1-μm latex beads or M. tuberculosis var. bovis BCG for 10 min followed by 20- or 60-min chase periods, after which the cells were fixed and processed for immunostaining. Under these conditions, LBPs were positive for the PI3P probe (Fig. 1). In contrast, MBPs displayed reduced association with the PI3P probe (Fig. 1). Identical results were obtained with murine macrophage cell lines J774 and RAW264.7. Thus, the previously reported phenomenon of altered EEA1 recruitment to MBPs (27Fratti R.A. Backer J.M. Gruenberg J. Corvera S. Deretic V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) can be, at least in part, explained by altered levels of PI3P on mycobacterial phagosomes. This is in keeping with our earlier demonstration that treatments with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors prevent phagosomal maturation (23Fratti R.A. Chua J. Vergne I. Deretic V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5437-5442Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Four-dimensional Live Microscopy Analysis of PI3P Dynamics: Multiple Waves of PI3P on Phagosomes—Immunostaining of fixed cells has technical limitations in precluding a reliable investigation of the very early time points of phagocytosis or transient events at any other stage. To examine in a time-resolved manner the different stages of phagocytosis and phagolysosome biogenesis, we resorted to live microscopy observations. An approach was employed that afforded low photocytotoxicity and low photobleaching imaging by using a rotating disk UltraView confocal microscope. Time-lapse studies using the UltraView system allowed monitoring of both the very early phagocytic events and the phagosome maturation progression over long periods of time. In addition, z-sections encompassing complete thickness of the cell were obtained at millisecond speeds for each time point (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). This allowed three-dimensional tracking of objects as they moved in and out of a single focal plane. For analysis and presentation, z-sections were collapsed following published procedures (46Gerlich D. Ellenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; : S14-S19PubMed Google Scholar) into a single image (projection), affording four-dimensional investigations of a volume over time. RAW 264.7 macrophages were nucleoporated with DNA encoding GFP fused to either the p40phox PX domain (P40PXEGFP) or to two tandem FYVE domains fr"
https://openalex.org/W1995404969,"Binding of cGMP to the GAF-B domain of phosphodiesterase 2A allosterically activates catalytic activity. We report here a series of mutagenesis studies on the GAF-B domain of PDE2A that support a novel mechanism for molecular recognition of cGMP. Alanine mutations of Phe-438, Asp-439, and Thr-488, amino acids that interact with the pyrimidine ring, decrease cGMP affinity slightly but increase cAMP affinity by up to 8-fold. Each interaction is required to provide for cAMP/cGMP specificity. Mutations of any of the residues that interact with the phosphate-ribose moiety or the imidazole ring abolish cGMP binding. Thus, residues that interact with the pyrimidine ring collectively control cAMP/cGMP specificity, whereas residues that bind the phosphate-ribose moiety and imidazole ring are critical for high affinity binding. Similar decreases in binding were found for mutations made in a bacterially expressed GAF-A/B plus catalytic domain construct. Because these constructs had very high catalytic activity, it appears that these mutations did not cause a global denaturation. The affinities of cAMP and cGMP for wild-type GAF-B alone were ∼4-fold greater than for the holoenzyme, suggesting that the presence of neighboring domains alters the conformation of GAF-B. More importantly, the PDE2A GAF-B, GAF-A/B, GAF-A/B+C domains, and holoenzyme all bind cGMP with much higher affinity than has previously been reported. This high affinity suggests that cGMP binding to PDE2 GAF-B activates the enzyme rapidly, stoichiometrically, and in an all or none fashion, rather than variably over a large range of cyclic nucleotide concentrations.

Eleven different phosphodiesterase (PDE) 1The abbreviations used are: PDE, 3′:5′-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase; PDE2, cGMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase; GAF, cGMP-regulated PDEs, Anabaenaadenylyl cyclase, E. coli protein FhlA. 1The abbreviations used are: PDE, 3′:5′-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase; PDE2, cGMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase; GAF, cGMP-regulated PDEs, Anabaenaadenylyl cyclase, E. coli protein FhlA. families, each containing multiple genes, have been described and differ in substrate specificity, regulatory properties, inhibitor profiles, and tissue distribution (1Soderling S.H. Beavo J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). The cGMP-stimulated PDEs (PDE2s) are one of three families of PDEs (PDE2s, PDE5s, and PDE6s) that are confirmed to contain allosteric cyclic nucleotide binding sites that bind cGMP (2Mumby M.C. Martins T.J. Chang M.L. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13283-13290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two other cGMP PDE families, PDE10A and PDE11A, have homologous regulatory segments (3Soderling S.H. Bayuga S.J. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7071-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 4Fawcett L. Baxendale R. Stacey P. McGrouther C. Harrow I. Soderling S. Hetman J. Beavo J.A. Phillips S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3702-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In PDE2A, cGMP binding to an allosteric site stimulates catalytic activity, which has numerous physiological consequences in vivo. For example, atrial natriuretic peptide stimulation of cGMP production and subsequent activation of PDE2A in the adrenal cortex decreases aldosterone secretion, thereby possibly mediating the effect of the hormone on fluid volume (5MacFarland R.T. Zelus B.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that 1 mol of cGMP is bound per PDE2 monomer (6Stroop S.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23802-23809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each PDE2A monomer contains a tandem pair of domains (GAF-A and GAF-B) that are now known to be part of a large family of small molecule binding domains called GAF domains (Fig. 1) (7Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 8Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2972) Google Scholar). GAF domains were first recognized by sequence homology in cGMP-specific PDEs, bacterial adenylyl cyclases, and FhlA, a bacterial transcription modulator; they have now been shown to exist in over 1360 different proteins in organisms ranging from humans to sponges (7Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 8Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2972) Google Scholar). Cyclic GMP appears only to bind GAF-B in PDE2A (9Martinez S. Wu A. Glavas N. Tang X. Turley S. Hol W. Beavo J. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and GAF-A in PDE5A (10Liu L. Underwood T. Li H. Pamukcu R. Thompson W.J. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recently, a mammalian PDE2 GAF domain has been shown capable of activating the adenylyl cyclase cyaB1 of Anabaena, a species of cyanobacterium, demonstrating that the function of these domains has been conserved in species separated by over 2 billion years of evolution (11Kanacher T. Schultz A. Linder J.U. Schultz J.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3672-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The GAF domains of cGMP-regulated PDEs and Anabaena adenylyl cyclase cyaB1 are distinguished from most other GAF domains by the presence of a conserved NKXnFX3DE (NKFDE) motif (12Charbonneau H. Prusti R.K. LeTrong H. Sonnenburg W.K. Mullaney P.J. Walsh K.A. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The NKFDE motif is conserved in almost all PDE GAF domains and has been proposed to be involved directly in cGMP binding (13Turko I.V. Haik T.L. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Burns F. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22240-22244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Granovsky A.E. Natochin M. McEntaffer R.L. Haik T.L. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5288-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In the bovine PDE5A holoenzyme, substitution of Asn-276, Lys-277, or Asp-289 with alanine in the NKFDE motif of the GAF-A domain has been reported to increase the apparent KD for cGMP from 1.3 μm to between 12 and 60 μm (13Turko I.V. Haik T.L. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Burns F. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22240-22244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the human PDE5A GAF-A domain expressed alone, however, mutation of the aspartate in the NKFDE motif to alanine (D299A) only weakened binding by 3-fold from 27 to 78 nm (16Sopory S. Balaji S. Srinivasan N. Visweswariah S.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The high affinity binding for the human isoform was attributed to the absence of the GAF-B and N-terminal domains of PDE5A in the expression construct (16Sopory S. Balaji S. Srinivasan N. Visweswariah S.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of PDE2A GAF-A/B, the NKFDE motif residues of GAF-B are not in contact with cGMP (9Martinez S. Wu A. Glavas N. Tang X. Turley S. Hol W. Beavo J. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). On the contrary, they are at the other side of a β sheet making up the floor of the cGMP binding pocket of the GAF-B domain, far from the cGMP binding site (Fig. 2A) (9Martinez S. Wu A. Glavas N. Tang X. Turley S. Hol W. Beavo J. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of PDE2A GAF-A/B also shows continuous electron density between the lysine and aspartate in this motif, which may indicate that a salt bridge forms between these residues (9Martinez S. Wu A. Glavas N. Tang X. Turley S. Hol W. Beavo J. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The ability of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent kinases, cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases to discriminate between cAMP and cGMP is an integral part of how these signaling pathways react to cellular stimuli. A single amino acid has been shown to be critical in controlling the specificity of cyclic nucleotide binding to cAMP- and cGMP-dependent kinases, cyclic nucleotide gated channels, and adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases (17Varnum M.D. Black K.D. Zagotta W.N. Neuron. 1995; 15: 619-625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 18Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Many high affinity guanine nucleotide-binding proteins utilize the carboxylate group of an aspartate or glutamate residue to bind both the N-1 and N-2 of cGMP (17Varnum M.D. Black K.D. Zagotta W.N. Neuron. 1995; 15: 619-625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 20Tucker C.L. Hurley J.H. Miller T.R. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). However, there have been relatively few studies probing these details in PDEs. In one study, mutagenesis of Asp-289 within the cGMP binding GAF domain of PDE5A was shown to influence cAMP/cGMP specificity when the pH was lowered from 9.5 to 5.2 (24Turko I.V. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29038-29041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Otherwise, little is known about the molecular determinants of substrate specificity for any GAF domain-containing protein. The amino acid residues in close contact with the nucleotide have been revealed in the crystal structures of several nucleotide-binding proteins in complex with substrates or analogs (25Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 26Scott S.P. Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Carey J. Tanaka J.C.

However, it also is known that the crystal structure of a complex often does not adequately characterize the relative importance of each close residue for nucleotide binding or nucleotide discrimination. In the present study, we used the recently determined 2.9-Å crystal structure of PDE2A GAF-A/B bound to cGMP (9Martinez S. Wu A. Glavas N. Tang X. Turley S. Hol W. Beavo J. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) as a guide for mutagenesis to determine to what extent various residues lining the GAF-B domain pocket determine cAMP and cGMP binding affinity and specificity. Materials—[8-3H]cGMP and [5,8-3H]cAMP were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. cAMP (sodium salt), cGMP (sodium salt), epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B, pepstatin A, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, dithiothreitol, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside were obtained from Sigma. Cloning and Site-directed Mutagenesis—cDNA for mouse PDE2A2 GAF-A (residues 206-386), GAF-B (residues 398-553), GAF-A/B plus catalytic domain (GAF-A/B+C) (residues 207-933) were cloned into a derivative of the pMW172 vector (Fig. 1) (29Way M. Pope B. Gooch J. Hawkins M. Weeds A.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4103-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). GAF-A/B (residues 207-566) had previously been cloned into the same vector (9Martinez S.

The vector-derived sequence LE(H6) was appended to the C terminus, and a Met to the N terminus. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to make point mutations in the pMW172 clone according to the protocol from Stratagene. Mutagenic oligonucleotides (see Table I) were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Escherichia coli XL-1 blue cells were used for all DNA manipulations. DNA was purified from small scale vector preparations using a Qiagen Plasmid Mini kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. DNA segments subjected to mutagenesis and subcloning reactions were sequenced in their entirety to ensure the presence of the desired mutation and proper in-frame subcloning.

Luria broth with 50 μg/ml ampicillin was used, and cells were first grown at 37 °C until A600 = 0.5. The cells were then induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (30 mg/liter) and incubated at 16 °C for 22 h. Cells were disrupted in lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) by microfluidization (10,000 p.s.i.) (Microfluidics, Newton, MA) (31White M.D. Marcus D. Adv. Biotechnol. Processes. 1988; 8: 51-96PubMed Google Scholar), and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was filtered through Whatman filter paper and then chromatographed through an epoxy-Sepharose cGMP affinity column (32Martins T.J. Mumby M.C. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1973-1979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After elution with 1 mm cGMP (200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and concentration using a Centriplus centrifugal filter (Amicon), aggregated protein was removed by gel filtration on Superose 12 (Amersham Biosciences) in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. All the mutated proteins that were purified on the cGMP affinity column migrated on the gel with essentially the same mobility as that of the wild-type GAF domain. Thus, we assume that these single nucleotide changes did not substantially affect transcription, translation, or folding of the protein and that the cGMP binding affinity changes were not due to global effects on protein folding. Mutant GAF proteins that did not bind to the cGMP affinity column were purified using Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech) using the C-terminal His6 tag of the protein. Cells were disrupted as above, and the supernatant incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with Talon resin (5 ml of resin/liter of culture) pre-washed three times at 700 × g in wash buffer (100 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5). After incubation, the resin was washed three times, transferred to a 20-ml Econo-Pac column (Bio-Rad), and washed again with 10 bed-volumes of wash buffer. The resin was then washed once with 10 mm imidazole, and protein was eluted with 150 mm imidazole in 100 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, followed by gel filtration on Superose-12. These mutations also probably do not cause a large global structural change to the protein, because the mutants were expressed in soluble form and purified as a single symmetrical peak of the correct Stoke's radius over the Superose-12 sizing columns. In addition, when three of the non-binding GAF-A/B+C constructs (A459S, K516A, and F522A) were made and tested, all had high catalytic activity, again suggesting a lack of a large global change in the protein. More localized domain changes can not, however, be entirely ruled out without determining the crystal structure of each mutant protein. Bovine PDE2A1 holoenzyme was expressed in Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus (33Rosman G.J. Martins T.J. Sonnenburg W.K. Beavo J.A. Ferguson K. Loughney K. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 191: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were grown at 27 °C in complete Grace's insect medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin in spinner flasks (80-90 rpm) and were infected with 100 ml of virus (at a multiplicity of infection of 10) per liter of media. At 72 h, the cells were harvested and disrupted by microfluidization (5,000 p.s.i.) and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The holoenzyme was purified on an epoxy-Sepharose cGMP affinity column in the presence of 5 mm EDTA followed by gel filtration on Superose-12 (32Martins T.J. Mumby M.C. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1973-1979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cGMP Competition Binding Assay—To measure cGMP binding, nitrocellulose filter binding assays were conducted in a total volume of 10 ml containing 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 nm to 100 μm [8-3H]cGMP (100 μl of ∼6000 cpm/pmol [8-3H]cGMP). The reaction was initiated by addition of GAF protein. Dilutions were made until the concentration of binding protein was always at least 3-fold less than the determined IC50 value. Following 1 h of incubation on ice, ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 1 m. This mixture was filtered through premoistened Millipore HAWP filters (pore size, 0.45 μm) and rinsed twice with a total of 6 ml of ice-cold 1 m ammonium sulfate buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA). In pilot experiments one molar ammonium sulfate was found to be sufficient to maximize binding to each of the wild-type expressed proteins. The filters were dissolved in Filter Count® (Packard) scintillation mixture and counted with a Packard 1600 TR liquid scintillation analyzer. The bound protein counts were corrected by subtraction of nonspecific binding, which was defined as the [8-3H]cGMP bound in the absence of GAF protein. The data were subjected to non-linear least squares analysis using Prism (GraphPad Software) to obtain IC50 values. Other Methods—Total protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford, using bovine serum albumin as the standard (Pierce). Phe-438, Asp-439, and Thr-488 Determine Cyclic Nucleotide Discrimination—We reasoned that one or more of the residues that interact with or are near the positions where the structure of cAMP and cGMP are different should control cyclic nucleotide specificity. Constructs containing mutations of these residues in PDE2 GAF-A/B were expressed in bacteria and purified using a cGMP affinity column (Fig. 3). The fact that all could bind to and be eluted from the affinity column strongly suggests that each could fold properly. To analyze the effects on substrate selectivity, full IC50 curves for both cGMP and cAMP were determined for the wild-type and each mutant. The change in substrate selectivity caused by each mutation is shown by the ratio of IC50 values for cGMP and cAMP (Table II). F438A, D439A, and T488A each increased the IC50 for cGMP about 2-fold relative to wild-type. However, these mutations each decreased the IC50 for cAMP by as much as 8-fold compared with wild-type (Fig. 4). Therefore, the selectivity ratio changes by 16-fold. The increased affinity for cAMP also indicates that these mutations were not generally deleterious to either the overall structure or to the binding pocket of PDE2A GAF-B. Furthermore, the results indicate that a major effect of each mutation is to remove a negative determinant for cAMP binding. Thus, those residues that determine specificity within the binding site appear mostly to restrict the access of cAMP rather than increase the affinity for cGMP.Table IISummary of cAMP and cGMP binding affinities for various GAF domain mutantsAmino acid residue changeIC50Ratio cA/cGBinding to cGMP affinity columncAMPcGMPnmPDE2A wild-typeGAF-ANDND(−)a+++ = >0.3 μg/μl; ++ = 0.1− 0.3 μg/μl; + = 0.01−0.1 μg/μl; and (−) = <0.01 μg/μl (protein concentration estimates are based on intensity of SDS-PAGE gels stained with Coomassie Blue, compared to known amounts of BSA standard).GAF-B146 ± 107 ± 120.9+++GAF-A/B247 ± 1425 ± 29.9+++GAF-A/B+C400 ± 2020 ± 220.0+++Holoenzyme598 ± 4722 ± 127.2+++Pyrimidine ring-binding residues (GAF-A/B)F438A82 ± 361 ± 121.3++D439A46 ± 1361 ± 30.8++D439N131 ± 2728 ± 114.7++D439P158 ± 32152 ± 311.0++T488A30 ± 538 ± 20.8+Phosphate-ribose and imidazole ring-binding residues (GAF-A/B)S424ANDbND, not detectible (indicates the protein sample did not bind detectable levels of cyclic nucleotide).ND+A459SNDND+A459TNDND+V484TNDND+D485AcAsp-485 binds both the guanine ring and the phosphate-ribose moiety.NDND+T492ANDND+E512ANDND+NKFDE motif residues (GAF-A/B)N515ANDND(−)K516ANDND(−)K516DNDND(−)F522ANDND(−)D526ANDND(−)D526KNDND(−)E527ANDND(−)K516D/D526KNDND(−)a +++ = >0.3 μg/μl; ++ = 0.1− 0.3 μg/μl; + = 0.01−0.1 μg/μl; and (−) = <0.01 μg/μl (protein concentration estimates are based on intensity of SDS-PAGE gels stained with Coomassie Blue, compared to known amounts of BSA standard).b ND, not detectible (indicates the protein sample did not bind detectable levels of cyclic nucleotide).c Asp-485 binds both the guanine ring and the phosphate-ribose moiety. Open table in a new tab Fig. 4Binding analysis for cAMP and cGMP to PDE2A GAF-A/B. Various concentrations of either unlabeled cGMP (circles, solid lines) or cAMP (squares, dotted lines) were used as competitive substrates to inhibit the binding of radiolabeled cGMP to the purified PDE2A GAF-A/B wild-type, F438A, D439A, and T488A. IC50 values are given in nanomolar values. Labeled ligand concentration was 1 nm, and the protein concentration was 0.6 nm. The data shown are representative of experiments performed three times, and values are mean ± S.E. of triple determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Asp-439 was replaced with an uncharged asparagine to determine if the carbonyl of the side chain of D439N could form a similar hydrogen bond to that of Asp-439. We also wanted to test if the amino group of the side chain could hydrogen bond to the deprotonated N-1 of cAMP and increase affinity. D439N has a similar affinity (28 ± 11 nm) for cGMP as wild-type (25 ± 2 nm) (Table II). This shows that a negatively charged side chain is not necessary for cGMP specificity. A hydrogen bond between the Asp-439 or D439N side chain and cGMP may still be necessary, because D439A has a slightly lower affinity for cGMP (61 ± 3 nm) than wild-type. As predicted, D439N does increase the affinity for cAMP (131 ± 27 nm) versus wild-type (247 ± 14 nm). However, a partial steric clash also is suggested by the fact that D439A has an apparent affinity of 46 ± 13 nm, which is higher than wild-type (247 ± 14 nm) or D439N (131 ± 27 nm). Therefore, the presence of Asp-439 allows for high affinity cGMP binding, but either the aspartate or asparagine side chain antagonizes cAMP binding relative to alanine. A mutation to proline of Asp-439 increases the IC50 for cGMP (152 ± 31 nm) to the same levels as cAMP (158 ± 32 nm), which was slightly lower than for wild-type. Charged, polar, or aromatic substitutions of Phe-438 (F438D, F438E, F438Q, and F438Y) as well as D439H in PDE2A GAF-B (Table III) also gave IC50 values that showed weaker cGMP affinity but enhanced cAMP affinity. As with PDE2A GAF-A/B, these GAF-B mutants expressed at comparable levels, bound to a cGMP affinity column, and had an identical mobility on SDS-PAGE as the wild-type protein, suggesting that they were correctly folded, full-length, and capable of binding cGMP. The fact that non-alanine substitutions of Phe-438 and Asp-439 gave similar affinities as the alanine mutations argues that both the phenylalanine and aspartate residues are unfavorable for cAMP binding, rather than enhancing for the binding of GMP.Table IIIBinding analysis for non-alanine substitutions and double/triple mutants of PDE2A GAF-BPDE2A GAFAmino acid residue changeIC50Ratio cA/cGcAMPcGMPnmBWild type146 ± 107 ± 121BF438D19 ± 321 ± 20.9BF438E14 ± 319 ± 110.7BF438Q28 ± 525 ± 81.1BF438Y21 ± 233 ± 70.7BD439H61 ± 941 ± 21.5BF438D/D439A18 ± 333 ± 60.6BF438D/D439N19 ± 224 ± 30.8BF438E/D439A19 ± 437 ± 80.5BF438E/D439N20 ± 541 ± 120.5BF438E/T488A45 ± 834 ± 61.3BD439H/T488A33 ± 744 ± 70"
https://openalex.org/W2059781644,"In all mature tRNAs, the 3′-terminal CCA sequence is synthesized or repaired by a template-independent nucleotidyltransferase (ATP(CTP):tRNA nucleotidyltransferase; EC 2.7.7.25). The Escherichia coli enzyme comprises two domains: an N-terminal domain containing the nucleotidyltransferase activity and an uncharacterized C-terminal HD domain. The HD motif defines a superfamily of metal-dependent phosphohydrolases that includes a variety of uncharacterized proteins and domains associated with nucleotidyltransferases and helicases from bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. The C-terminal HD domain in E. coli tRNA nucleotidyltransferase demonstrated Ni2+-dependent phosphatase activity toward pyrophosphate, canonical 5′-nucleoside tri- and diphosphates, NADP, and 2′-AMP. Assays with phosphodiesterase substrates revealed surprising metal-independent phosphodiesterase activity toward 2′,3′-cAMP, -cGMP, and -cCMP. Without metal or in the presence of Mg2+, the tRNA nucleotidyltransferase hydrolyzed 2′,3′-cyclic substrates with the formation of 2′-nucleotides, whereas in the presence of Ni2+, the protein also produced some 3′-nucleotides. Mutations at the conserved His-255 and Asp-256 residues comprising the C-terminal HD domain of this protein inactivated both phosphodiesterase and phosphatase activities, indicating that these activities are associated with the HD domain. Low concentrations of the E. coli tRNA (10 nm) had a strong inhibiting effect on both phosphatase and phosphodiesterase activities. The competitive character of inhibition by tRNA suggests that it might be a natural substrate for these activities. This inhibition was completely abolished by the addition of Mg2+, Mn2+, or Ca2+, but not Ni2+. The data suggest that the phosphohydrolase activities of the HD domain of the E. coli tRNA nucleotidyltransferase are involved in the repair of the 3′-CCA end of tRNA.

The data suggest that the phosphohydrolase activities of the HD domain of the E. coli tRNA nucleotidyltransferase are involved in the repair of the 3′-CCA end of tRNA. In all organisms, the 3′-terminal CCA sequence in all mature tRNAs is required for tRNA aminoacylation reaction and for translation on the ribosome (1Sprinzl M. Cramer F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1979; 22: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 2Green R. Noller H.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 679-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The CCA-adding enzyme (ATP(CTP):tRNA nucleotidyltransferase; EC 2.7.7.25) adds these three nucleotides in the order of C, C, and A to the tRNA nucleotide-73, using CTP and ATP as substrates and producing inorganic pyrophosphate (3Deutscher M.P.

Weiner A.M. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29693-29700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The CCA-adding enzyme is essential in eukaryotes, archaea, and certain eubacteria where some or all tRNA genes do not encode the CCA sequence (5Aebi M. Kirchner G. Chen J.Y. Vijayraghavan U. Jacobson A. Martin N.C. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16216-16220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these organisms, 3′ trailer sequences are removed from tRNA precursors by nucleases that stop at the discriminator base (position 73), leaving the acceptor stem intact as a substrate for the CCA-adding enzyme (6Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar). In organisms in which tRNA genes encode the CCA sequence (Escherichia coli and many eubacteria), tRNA-NT repairs the tRNA 3′ CCA sequence depleted by exonucleases, and inactivation of the tRNA-NT gene impairs cell growth (7Zhu L. Deutscher M.P. EMBO J. 1987; 8: 2473-2477Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The CCA-adding enzyme is unique among nucleotidyltransferases in that it adds an ordered nucleotide sequence to a specific primer without using a nucleic acid template (6Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar, 8Martin G. Keller W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Moreover, the enzyme can monitor and faithfully rebuild tRNAs with incomplete 3′ ends (tRNA-NCC, tRNA-NC, and tRNA-N, where N is the discriminator base). It completes the terminal CCA sequence by adding one nucleotide at a time. The protein consists of a single polypeptide with dual specificity for AMP and CMP incorporation, and a single active site is responsible for addition of both nucleotides (4Yue D. Weiner A.M. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29693-29700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Several models have been proposed to explain these properties (9Deutscher M.P. J.

Biol. 2003; 328: 985-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but the molecular details remain unclear. According to their primary sequence, the CCA-adding enzymes belong to an ancient superfamily of nucleotidyltransferases, which is divided into two classes (6Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar, 15Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 345-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Class I contains archaeal CCA-adding enzymes, whereas class II comprises eubacterial and eukaryotic proteins. Class II enzymes have similar sizes (400–470 amino acids) and share a highly conserved 25-kDa N-terminal region with characteristic active-site signature motifs (DxD and RRD), but differ from one another in their C-terminal regions. The E. coli tRNA-NT belongs to the class II enzymes, and its nucleotidyltransferase activity has been characterized (16Best A.N. Novelli G.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 142: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Cudny H. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6450-6453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein has two domains, the N-terminal nucleotidyltransferase domain and the C-terminal HD domain named after the conserved HD motif (His-255 and Asp-256 in E. coli). The HD motif defines a superfamily of metal-dependent phosphohydrolases that includes a variety of uncharacterized proteins and domains associated with nucleotidyltransferases and helicases from bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (18Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 469-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The HD superfamily is related to a well characterized eukaryotic 3′,5′-cyclic phosphodiesterase (19Francis S.H. Colbran J.L. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22477-22480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that is, however, distinct from the HD superfamily and contains additional conserved regions. The HD domain was predicted to have a metal-dependent phosphohydrolase activity (18Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 469-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Here, we report that the E. coli tRNA-NT has 2′,3′-cyclic phosphodiesterase, 2′-nucleotidase, and phosphatase activities. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that these three activities are associated with the conserved C-terminal HD motif and probably have partially overlapping active sites. Low concentrations of total E. coli tRNA produced strong competitive inhibition on all three activities, suggesting that tRNA might be a natural substrate for the HD domain-associated activities. Based on our results, we proposed a model for the role of the HD domain-associated activities in the repair of the tRNA 3′ end. Gene Cloning and Protein Purification—Recombinant proteins were expressed with a His6 fusion tag at the N terminus using a modified pET15b (Novagen) expression vector in E. coli BL21 (DE3) as described previously (20Zhang R. Skarina T. Katz J.E. Beasley S. Khachatryan A. Vyas S. Arrowsmith C.H. Clarke S. Edwards A.M. Joachimiak A. Savchenko A. Structure. 2001; 9: 1095-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Purification of the E. coli tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (from 4 L E. coli cultures) was performed using a combination of affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) and anion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences; elution by NaCl gradient 50–200 mm). Enzymatic Assays—The E. coli tRNA-NT was screened for a variety of catalytic activities as follows. Reactions were performed in 96-well microplates using 0.2-ml reaction mixtures and the following spectrophotometric procedures. After addition of protein samples (0.1–1.0 μg), the plates were incubated for 1–3 h at 37 °C before taking the reading at indicated wavelengths. Positive controls with small amount of commercial enzymes were included in all tests. Phosphatase activity was measured in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES-K buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm MnCl2, and 40 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) by following the absorption increase at 410 nm. Phosphodiesterase and nuclease activities were measured using 50 mm Tricine buffer, pH 8.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm MnCl2, and 0.83 mm bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate (bis-pNPP) with detection at 410 nm. Esterase activity was tested using 1 mmp-nitrophenyl palmitate in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.4% Triton X-100, and 0.1% of Gum Arabic (detection at 410 nm). Protease activity was determined with a mixture of two chromogenic substrates (benzoyl-Arg-p-nitroanilide and Leu-p-nitroanilide; 0.2 mm each) was measured in 50 mm HEPES-K buffer, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm Ca2+, 0.5 mm Zn2+, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (detection at 405 nm). Dehydrogenase and oxidase activities were measured using three pools of different substrates: 20 amino acids (0.2 mm concentrations of each in reaction mixture), eight different alcohols (methanol, ethanol, adonitol, xylitol, dulcitol, mannitol, sorbitol, arabitol; 0.5 mm concentrations of each in reaction mixture), or nine different organic acids (acetate, fumarate, malate, lactate, pyruvate, isocitrate, succinate, oxaloacetate, α-ketoglutarate; 0.5 mm concentrations of each in reaction mixture). Dehydrogenase activity was measured in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tricine buffer, pH 8.5, 0.5 mm NAD, 0.5 mm NADP, the substrate solution (described above), 1 mm Mg2+, and 0.1 mm Mn2+ (detection at 340 nm). Oxidase activity was monitored using the chromogenic reaction of peroxidase and o-dianisidine (21Kelley R.L. Reddy C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 161: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES-K, pH 8.0, the substrate solution (described above), 0.1 mmo-dianisidine, and 2 μg of peroxidase (detection at 460 nm). Screening with natural phosphatase substrates was performed in 96-well plates using 160-μl reaction mixtures containing 50 mm HEPES-K, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm substrate (various nucleotides and phosphorylated sugars, amino acids, and organic acids from Sigma), 6.25 mm Mg2+, 0.6 mm Mn2+, 0.6 mm Ni2+, and 2–5 μg of protein. After a 30–60 min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 40 μl of Malachite Green reagent (22Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), and the production of Pi was measured at 630 nm. Phosphodiesterase activity of the E. coli tRNA-NT against bis-pNPP was measured in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES-K, pH 7.0, 3.3 mm bis-pNPP, with or without 0.5 mm Ni2+. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.2 ml of 6 N NaOH and produced p-nitrophenol was determined from the absorbance at 410 nm. Phosphodiesterase activity with natural substrates (various 2′,3′- and 3′,5′-cyclic nucleoside monophosphates from Sigma) was measured using a quantitative assay based on a measurement of the alkaline phosphatase-sensitive nucleotide product. All incubations (0.4 ml) contained 50 mm HEPES-K, pH 7.0, 1–2 mm substrate, and metal (if indicated). After a 20-min incubation at 37 °C with enzyme (0.2–0.3 μg), the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.4 ml of 2× alkaline phosphatase buffer (0.2 m CHES buffer, pH 9.0, and 10 mm MgCl2) and incubated with 1 unit of alkaline phosphatase for 10 min at 37 °C. Liberated Pi was assayed with Malachite Green reagent (22Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). For determination of the Km and Vmax, the phosphatase and phosphodiesterase assays contained substrates at concentrations of 0.1–10 mm. Kinetic parameters were determined by non-linear curve fitting from the Lineweaver-Burk plot using GraphPad Prism software (version 4.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). TLC Analysis—Products of enzymatic digestions, performed as described above, were analyzed by TLC on cellulose plates in solvent A (saturated ammonium sulfate/3 m sodium acetate/isopropyl alcohol; 80:6:2) (23Genschik P. Billy E. Swianiewicz M. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2955-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The reaction products and nucleotide standards were visualized under UV light. 50-μl reaction mixtures contained 50 mm HEPES-K, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm Ni2+ (if indicated), 20 mm 2′,3′-cAMP (or 2′,3′-cGMP), or 2 mm ATP and were incubated at 37 °C without or with 2 μg of the E. coli tRNA-NT. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using QuikChange (Stratagene) and mutagenic primers designed to replace the selected amino acid residues by Ala. Wild-type E. coli tRNA-NT gene cloned into pET15b was used as a template for mutagenesis. Plasmids were purified using Qiaprep Spin Mini Prep Kit (Qiagen), and all mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. tRNA Nucleotidyltransferase Has Phosphatase Activity— General enzymatic screens with pNPP as a substrate identified a new activity in the E. coli tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (tRNA-NT, CCA adding enzyme) (data not shown). The protein was purified in a large scale by a combination of nickel-chelate affinity and anion-exchange chromatography to >95% homogeneity. In solution, most of purified tRNA-NT existed as a monomer (44.8 ± 0.5 kDa) with low levels (up to 20%) of dimers (103.0 ± 10.0 kDa) and oligomers (784.2 ± 33.5 kDa). All three fractions (monomers, dimers, and oligomers) had approximately the same level of phosphatase activity with pNPP. In contrast to the characterized nucleotidyltransferase activity of this protein (16Best A.N. Novelli G.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 142: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Cudny H. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6450-6453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the phosphatase activity had a neutral pH optimum, pH 7.0, and was greatly stimulated by Ni2+ (Fig. 1). With pNPP as a substrate, tRNA-NT showed high affinity to Ni2+ (KD = 6.0 ± 0.7 μm in the presence of 8 mmpNPP) and low affinity to pNPP (Km = 6.2 ± 0.46 mm in the presence of 50 μm Ni2+) (Fig. 1). However, the specific activity toward pNPP (Vmax = 12.4 ± 0.34 μmol/min/mg of protein) was sufficiently high to produce positive results in general screens without Ni2+. Phosphatase Activity with Natural Substrates—Secondary catalytic screens with natural phosphatase substrates (57 compounds) in the presence of Ni2+ identified high phosphatase activity of the E. coli tRNA-NT against a broad range of canonical nucleoside di- and triphosphates, NADP, and pyrophosphate (Fig. 2). Highest phosphatase activity was found against NADP, ATP, CTP, TTP, and dCTP. Nucleoside diphosphates (ADP, CDP, GDP, and UDP) were also good substrates for the E. coli tRNA-NT (data not shown). With all substrates, the protein showed saturation kinetics with highest affinity to pyrophosphate and NADP (Fig. 3 and Table I). Cellulose TLC analysis of the hydrolysis of ATP identified ADP and AMP as reaction products (Fig. 4A), indicating that the E. coli tRNA-NT sequentially removes monophosphates from ATP. Enzymatic analysis of the reaction products produced during hydrolysis of ATP or ADP yielded Pi, AMP, and ADP as the reaction products (data not shown). With nucleoside monophosphates as substrates, high phosphatase activity was observed against 2′-AMP (Figs. 2 and 3), low activity against 3′-AMP (12.9 nmol/min/mg of protein), and no activity toward 5′-mononucleotides.Fig. 3Phosphohydrolase activity of the E. coli tRNA-NT as a function of substrate concentration.

With natural substrates, the protein had even higher affinity for Ni2+ (KD = 1.06 ± 0.1 μm with pyrophosphate as a substrate). Cu2+ stimulated the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate and ATP and completely inhibited the hydrolysis of 2′-AMP, suggesting some difference in the active sites involved in these reactions. Because the nucleotidyltransferase activity of the E. coli tRNA-NT (which also involves the hydrolysis of ATP and CTP) had an alkaline pH optimum (pH 9.0–9.5) and required Mg2+ (16Best A.N. Novelli G.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 142: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Cudny H. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6450-6453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is not related to the Ni2+-dependent neutral phosphatase and 2′-nucleotidase activities observed in our experiments. We also determined the kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of several natural substrates (Fig. 3, Table I). With all substrates, the protein showed saturation kinetics with highest affinity for pyrophosphate and NADP (Fig. 3; Table I). For the nucleotidyltransferase reaction, 1 mm PPi caused only 20% inhibition (16Best A.N. Novelli G.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 142: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This insensitivity to PPi can be explained by the presence of pyrophosphatase activity in the E. coli tRNA-NT. Whereas the Km for ATP (0.18 mm) was near the Km for AMP incorporation (0.33 mm) (17Cudny H. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6450-6453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Km for CTP (0.13 mm) was significantly higher than the Km for CMP incorporation (0.03 mm) (17Cudny H. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6450-6453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein showed much higher activity and affinity to NADP (which also has a 2′-phosphate) than to 2′-AMP (Table I), suggesting that it might prefer large substrates like tRNAs. tRNA-NT Has Phosphodiesterase Activity—Because a number of phosphodiesterases have been shown to possess both nucleotidase and phosphodiesterase activities (24Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3412-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Center M.S. Behal F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 138-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the E. coli tRNA-NT was tested for the presence of phosphodiesterase activity toward 2′,3′- and 3′,5′-cyclic nucleotides. The protein exhibited high phosphodiesterase activity against 2′,3′-cAMP and 2′,3′-cGMP, low activity against 2′,3′-cCMP, and no activity with 3′,5′-cyclic nucleotides (Fig. 3). Like most known 2′,3′-cyclic phosphodiesterases, the phosphodiesterase activity of the E. coli tRNA-NT had a neutral pH optimum, pH 7.0, and no metal dependence (Fig. 5D). Similar levels of phosphodiesterase activity were observed without metal addition or in the presence of Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, or Ni2+, whereas Co2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ were inhibiting (Fig. 5D). The protein showed highest activity and affinity to 2′,3′-cAMP (Table I). When tested with the general phosphodiesterase substrate bis-pNPP, tRNA-NT had maximal activity at pH 7.0 and reduced activity (25%) at pH 8.5 (used in screens), and it showed a strong requirement for Ni2+ (little activity with Mn2+ and no activity without metal or in the presence of Mg2+). This strong dependence of the bis-pNPP hydrolysis by the E. coli tRNA-NT on Ni2+ explains why the general phosphodiesterase screens failed to detect this activity. In addition, our results demonstrated a different metal requirement for the hydrolysis of natural (2′,3′-cAMP) and artificial (bis-pNPP) substrates by the E. coli tRNA-NT. Without metal or in the presence of Mg2+, the E. coli tRNA-NT hydrolyzed 2′,3′-cAMP to 2′-AMP as analyzed by cellulose TLC (Fig. 4B). However, in the presence of Ni2+, the protein produced both 2′-AMP and 3′-AMP. Because Ni2+ stimulates 2′-nucleotidase activity of the E. coli tRNA-NT (Fig. 5C), in the presence of this metal, a significant proportion of 2′-AMP product was converted to adenosine (Fig. 4C). As presented on Fig. 4B, in the presence of Ni2+, 2′-AMP was still the main product (∼70%) of 2′,3′-cAMP hydrolysis. Similar results were obtained with 2′,3′-cGMP (Fig. 4C) and 2′,3′-cCMP (data not shown) as substrates. Other metals (Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+) and the E. coli tRNA did not affect the hydrolysis of 2′,3′-cAMP (data not shown). Thus, the E. coli tRNA-NT has 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase activity in the absence of Ni2+ and 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 2′,3′-phosphodiesterase activity in the presence of Ni2+. At the moment, two groups of 2′,3′-cyclic phosphodiesterases are known (BRENDA data base). Members of the first group (EC 3.1.4.16; mostly prokaryotic proteins) convert a 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide exclusively to a 3′-nucleotide, which is further hydrolyzed to a ribonucleotide and Pi. The second group (EC 3.1.4.37; mostly eukaryotic proteins) hydrolyzes the same substrate exclusively to a 2′-nucleotide and then degrades it to a ribonucleotide and Pi. Thus, the E. coli tRNA-NT is the first 2′,3′-cyclic phosphodiesterase that can hydrolyze a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphodiester at both 2′- and 3′-bonds and produce the corresponding 2′- and 3′-nucleotides. Effect of tRNA and Metals—In the absence of metal or in the presence of Ni2+, low concentrations of total tRNA from E. coli (10 nm) had a strong inhibiting effect on both phosphatase and phosphodiesterase activities of the E. coli tRNA-NT (Fig. 6A). The activities toward natural substrates were especially sensitive to tRNA inhibition (Ki = 0.29 nm for ATP hydrolysis, 1.08 nm for 2′-AMP hydrolysis, and 1.68 nm for 2′,3′-cAMP hydrolysis); the inhibition of pNPP hydrolysis by 30 nm tRNA was minimal (30%) (Fig. 6A). These inhibition constants are at least 10,000 times lower than the Km for tRNA in nucleotidyltransferase reaction (15–20 μm) (17Cudny H. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6450-6453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown on Fig. 6 (B and C), the E. coli tRNA acted as a competitive inhibitor of the hydrolysis of both 2′-AMP and 2′,3′-cAMP and induced a significant increase in Km for these substrates (Table II, Table III). The inhibition by tRNA was released at high substrate concentrations (Fig. 6, B and C), suggesting that tRNA might be a natural substrate for new phosphohydrolase activities. Total tRNA from yeast had similar inhibiting effects (data not shown). Moreover, we found that the phosphohydrolase activities of the E. coli tRNA-NT were also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by nanogram quantities of the E. coli total rRNA (with 50% reduction caused by 8.86–22.2 ng of rRNA), genomic DNA (8.95–17.9 ng), or synthetic oligonucleotides poly(A) (36.3–97.6 ng) or poly(C) (14.4–19.1 ng), whereas single nucleotides (like 5′-AMP) had weak inhibiting effect (Ki = 0.59 mm). This sensitivity to various nucleic acids can be explained by broad substrate specificity of tRNA-NTs that can efficiently recognize all tRNAs regardless of amino acid acceptor specificity, viral RNAs, U2 small nuclear RNAs, synthetic tDNA, and DNA oligonucleotides (10Shi P.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2036334064,"Recent studies of ERs in breast cancer have demonstrated the existence of ERβ in addition to ERα. Some clinical data indicated that ERβ had prognostic value for patient's survival, which suggested that ERβ plays a key role in breast cancer development and metastasis. To test this hypothesis, we generated an ERβ high-expression cell line by reintroduced human ERβ cDNA into MDA-MB-435 cells. We demonstrated that ERβ exerted multiple tumor-stimulative effects on human breast carcinoma cells both in vivo and in vitro. In in vitro studies, ERβ was able to increase the proliferation and invasion of MDA-MB-435 cells significantly, while these effects were totally estradiol independent. Also, this stimulation was characterized by downregulation of p21 and upregulation of MMP-9, as well as transcriptional factor Est-1. In in vivo studies, we also demonstrated that ERβ-transfected MDA-MB-435 cells grew much faster and had more pulmonary metastasis than mock or wild-type cells in nude mice. In ERβ-transfected MDA-MB-435 xenografts, ERβ caused significant reduction in p21 protein levels. Similar effects of ERβ on MMP-9 and Ets-1 expression noted in vitro studies were also observed in the in vivo studies. These in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that ERβ exerted multiple stimulative effects on breast cancer development and metastasis."

This continuously updated list allows functional annotation of newly sequenced genomes and genome-wide evolutionary analyses. Among these COGs, some appear to have great importance, since they are present in most, if not all, members of one or several domains of life. Distinction can be made between those conserved in all three domains (thus defining a universal subset of proteins probably present in LUCA, the last universal common ancestor of the extant life forms), those specific to a single domain, and those shared by two of the three domains of life. Several comparative studies on characterized proteins, aimed at distinguishing organisms of the three biological domains, have indicated that many, although not all, proteins involved in metabolic pathways of Archaea resemble more closely their bacterial than eukaryotic counterparts, whereas proteins involved in the organization or processing of genetic information (structures of ribosome and chromatin, translation, transcription, replication, and DNA repair) suggest a closer relationship between Archaea and Eukaryota (5Dennis P.P.

These groups were named PACEs (for proteins from Archaea conserved in Eukaryota (see, on the World Wide Web, www-archbac.u-psud.fr/projects/pace/paceproteins.html). Interestingly, for some of these proteins, roles in transcription, translation, or replication processes have been postulated (9Matte-Tailliez O. Zivanovic Y. Forterre P. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 533-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For example, polypeptides from the PACE08 group (COG1369) have been identified as one of the subunits of ribonuclease P (RNase P), a ribonucleoprotein complex involved in 5′-end tRNA maturation (10Hartmann E.

The SSO0175 and MJ0051 archaeal proteins, as well as the Ybl057c protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (all from the PACE07 group), have been shown to have peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase activity and are thus involved in recycling peptidyl-tRNA molecules prematurely dissociated from the mRNA template (11Fromant M.

Among proteins of the PACE groups characterized so far, only those belonging to PACE 11 have been shown not to be related to organization or processing of cellular information. Two of us recently reported that the product of the Pyrococcus abyssi GE5 PAB0944 gene (COG1019) corresponds to a single domain polypeptide involved in the fourth step of coenzyme A biosynthesis (phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase), whereas its human ortholog is fused to another domain, dephosphocoenzyme A kinase, which is responsible for catalyzing the last step of the coenzyme A biosynthetic pathway (13Armengaud J.

A search of the NCBI conserved domain data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml) (14Marchler-Bauer A. Anderson J.B. DeWeese-Scott C. Fedorova N.D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) indicates that all sequences from COG1041 encompass two domains: a putative AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase (MTase) domain (pfam01170) at the C terminus and a so-called THUMP (thiouridine synthases, RNA methyltransferases, and pseudouridine synthases) domain (pfam02926 (15Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 215-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)) of about 110 amino acid residues at the N terminus. The reactions catalyzed by MTases are very diverse and can transfer the AdoMet methyl group onto either nitrogen, oxygen, or carbon atoms in DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, or small molecules such as catechol (reviewed in Ref. 16Fauman E.B. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. S-Adenosylmethionine-dependent Methyltransferases: Structures and Functions. World Scientific Publishing, Singapore1999: 1-38Crossref Google Scholar). The THUMP domain has been identified in the ThiI enzyme catalyzing the formation of 4-thiouridine in bacterial tRNAs as well as in several other putative RNA modification enzymes, such as MTases and pseudouridine synthases (see Ref. 15Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 215-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and references therein). For this reason, it is expected to be an ancient RNA-binding domain. Therefore, we hypothesized that COG1041 proteins are as yet uncharacterized RNA MTases for which the target nucleoside within RNA molecules has still to be discovered. Most stable cellular RNAs (tRNAs, rRNAs, and small nuclear (small nucleolar)RNAs) contain many post-transcriptionally modified nucleosides. To date, at least 96 different chemically distinct modified nucleosides have been identified in the many naturally occurring RNA analyzed (see, on the World Wide Web, medstat.med.utah.edu/RNAmods/). Among them, ribose and/or base methylations are among the most frequently encountered (17Rozenski J. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 196-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) (for a review, see Ref. 18Hopper A.K. Phizicky E.M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 162-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). They have been shown to play a role in stabilization, structural folding, protection from endonucleases, and molecular recognition of the functional RNAs by numerous proteins as well as in RNA-RNA interactions (for a review, see many chapters in Ref. 19Grosjean H. Benne R. Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1998Crossref Google Scholar). To verify that proteins belonging to COG1041 are AdoMet-dependent RNA MTases, we purified to homogeneity and characterized a recombinant form of the PAB1283 gene product from the hyperthermophilic archaeon P. abyssi. We identified in vitro both the reaction catalyzed by the purified enzyme and the target nucleotide within its RNA substrates. Our results demonstrate for the first time that a THUMP-containing MTase is associated with a tRNA modification function and that the PAB1283 gene product corresponds to a site-specific tRNA: m22G dimethyltransferase acting on the N2-exocyclic amine group of guanosine at position 10 in tRNA. Construction of an N-terminal His6-tagged PAB1283-overexpressing Plasmid—A construct was designed in order to get overexpression of a slightly modified version of P. abyssi PAB1283 open reading frame. The Met-ATG located at 1592098 (numbering refers to whole P. abyssi genomic sequence), and not the upstream Leu-TTG codon that genome annotators mentioned in the data base, was taken as the most probable initiator codon. This was the choice because TTG codons are rarely used as initiators in Archaea and also because the resulting N-terminal PAB1283 sequence aligns better with those of the other archaeal homologs. Thirteen amino acid residues (MRGSHHHHHHGMAS) were introduced with the N-terminal His6 tag. Two synthetic oligonucleotide primers were designed in order to amplify the PAB1283 gene from P. abyssi total DNA: oAD34 (5′-catatggctagcATGTTCTACGTTGAAATCCTAGGTTTG-3′) that contains two engineered restriction sites (NdeI and NheI) and oAD35 (5′-ggatcctcaTCACCTCGCC TCCATTATGTAGAAG-3′) that contains an engineered BamHI site just after the stop codon. Nucleotides in lowercase type were not present in the original coding sequence. PCR performed with Pwo polymerase (Roche Applied Science) gave a 1.0-kb homogeneous product that was cloned into pCRScript-cam (Stratagene), resulting in plasmid pSBTN-AB89. The 994-bp insert from pSBTN-AB89 was removed by digestion with NheI and BamHI and ligated with T4-DNA ligase with plasmid pSBTNAB23, 2J. Armengaud and V. Chaumont, unpublished data. a derivative of pCR T7/NT-topo (Invitrogen) containing a T7 promoter and His6 tag, previously digested with compatible endonucleases (NheI and BglII). The resulting plasmid was sequenced in order to ascertain the integrity of the nucleotide sequence and was named pSBTN-AC18. Purification of Recombinant PAB1283 Protein—Overexpression of the PAB1283 construct was achieved with the Escherichia coli Rosetta(DE3)pLysS strain (Novagen) transformed with pSBTN-AC18. Large scale liquid cultures were set up at 30 °C and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-γ-d-thiogalactopyranoside as described earlier (13Armengaud J. Fernandez B. Chaumont V. Rollin-Genetet F. Finet S. Marchetti C. Myllykallio H. Vidaud C. Pellequer J.L. Gribaldo S. Forterre P. Gans P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31078-31087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cells (63 g of wet material) were resuspended in 300 ml of cold 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.3 at 20 °C) and disrupted by means of a BasicZ cell disrupter (Constant Systems Ltd.) operated at 900 bars. The cold cell extract was then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 10 °C to remove cellular debris and aggregated proteins. PAB1283 was purified from 45 ml of this cell extract (corresponding to7gofwet cells). The sample was subjected to a 20-min heat treatment at 65 °C and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 10 °C. The resulting 40-ml clear supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.3) containing 100 mm KCl and 50 mm imidazole (buffer A). The sample was applied at room temperature onto a 5-ml HiTrap chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. After a 5-column volume wash with buffer A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, the N-terminal His6-tagged PAB1283 protein was eluted over a 15-ml linear gradient comprising 50-300 mm imidazole. The major peak, which eluted from the column at about 150 mm imidazole, was desalted by gel filtration at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min on an Amersham Biosciences XK26/40 column containing 175 ml of packed G25SF gel (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.3) containing 50 mm NaCl. The protein was further purified by chromatography either on MonoQ or hydroxyapatite columns. In the first case, samples were injected at a 0.5 ml/min flow rate onto a 1-ml MonoQ HR5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with buffer A, and the bound proteins were eluted over a 40-ml linear gradient comprising 50-550 mm NaCl. The proteins, which eluted between 100 and 150 mm NaCl, were then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.3) containing 20 mm NaCl and stored at -80 °C. Alternatively, samples were first dialyzed against 100 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 buffer at pH 7.2 containing 300 mm NaCl and 2 mm DTT (buffer H1) and then injected at a 0.5 ml/min flow rate onto an HR10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) packed with 7 ml of hydroxyapatite Bio-gel HT (Bio-Rad) and previously equilibrated with buffer H1. Proteins were resolved with a 3-column volume linear gradient from 100 to 500 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 and then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.3) containing 20 mm NaCl. Protein concentrations were determined by UV spectrophotometry at 280 nm using the molar absorption coefficient of 29,300 m-1 cm-1 obtained from calculation of the amino acid composition of the recombinant protein (20Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar) (available on the World Wide Web at www.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html). Estimation of Quaternary Structure of Purified Recombinant Enzyme by Gel Filtration—The native molecular mass of PAB1283 protein was first estimated by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 gel packed into a HR10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) with a final bed volume of 24 ml. The column was equilibrated at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.3, containing 50 mm NaCl and eluted with the same buffer. A second, more accurate estimation was made on a Superdex75 gel packed into a HR10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) with a final bed volume of 24 ml. This column was equilibrated at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min with 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm DTT. Samples containing the purified recombinant PAB1283 protein (2.3 and 3.7 nmol, respectively) were chromatographed on Superdex200 and Superdex75 columns. Complex formation between PAB1283 protein and various samples of tRNAs (bulk yeast tRNAs, bulk E. coli tRNAs, or purified yeast tRNAAsp) were evaluated by comparing the elution profiles of tRNAs and protein alone with those of tRNA-protein complexes on a Superdex75 gel filtration column. Transfer RNAs from both yeast and E. coli were obtained from Sigma, whereas purified yeast tRNAAsp and purified 74-nucleotide RNA that includes part of helix 22 and helices 34 and 35 from E. coli 23 S rRNA (described in Ref. 21Lebars I. Yoshizawa S. Stenholm A.R. Guittet E. Douthwaite S. Fourmy D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were generous gifts of Dr. Anne Theobald-Ditriech (CNRS-IBMC, Strasbourg, France) and Dr. Dominique Fourmy (CNRSICSN, Gif-sur-Yvette, France), respectively. Before use, the RNAs were precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 150 mm NaCl. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—The transition temperature, Tm, of purified PAB1283 was determined with a high sensitivity differential scanning microcalorimeter, VP-DSC (MicroCal). The reference buffer was 30 mm HEPPS/NaOH, pH 8.0, containing 50 mm NaCl and 5 mm MgCl2. Prior to the calorimetric analysis, the sample was dialyzed at room temperature against this reference buffer. Recombinant His6-tagged PAB1283 protein was analyzed at a protein concentration of 5.3 μm. Calorimetric scans against the reference buffer were carried out in 0.5 ml of fixed-in-place cells. A self-contained pressurizing system (0-45 p.s.i.) allowed the scanning of solutions above their boiling point. Scans were recorded between 30 and 110 °C with a heating scan rate of 1.0 °C/min. tRNA Methylation Assays—To determine the tRNA (G10) MTase activity of PAB1283, various 32P-radiolabeled tRNA transcripts were used as substrates. They were obtained by in vitro transcription with T7 polymerase (Promega) of linearized plasmids harboring appropriate synthetic tRNA genes using α-32P-labeled GTP, UTP, or CTP (Amersham Biosciences). Both preparation and purification of resulting transcripts on urea gels have been described elsewhere (22Grosjean H. Droogmans L. Giege R. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1050: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For testing enzyme activity, an aliquot (a few nmol) of purified recombinant PAB1283 protein in 2.5 μl of 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 1 mg/ml serum albumin was added to 22.5 μl of the standard reaction mixture consisting in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 40 μg/ml polyuridylic acid (Sigma), 80 μm AdoMet (Sigma), with enough 32P-radiolabeled tRNA to obtain maximum incorporation of the methyl group from AdoMet to the tRNA substrate after 1 h of incubation at 50 °C. AdoMet stock solutions were made at 20 mm in hydrochloric acid, pH 2.0, and stored at -70 °C. Prior to the addition to the reaction mixture, the solutions of tRNA substrates contained in siliconized Eppendorf tubes were renatured by a 3-min incubation in a water bath at 75 °C followed by gradual cooling to room temperature. After incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl of cold 0.3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.3) immediately followed by the addition of an equal volume of phenol/chloroform (24:1). Denatured proteins were then removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 3 min at room temperature, and nucleic acids present in the upper phase were precipitated with ethanol, collected by centrifugation, washed once with 70% ethanol, dried, and finally completely digested into 5′-monophosphate nucleosides by overnight incubation at 37 °C with an excess (0.4 μg) of nuclease P1 (Roche Applied Science) in 10 μl of 50 mm ammonium acetate/acetic acid buffer at pH 5.3. Alternatively, complete digestion of dried RNA samples into 3′-phosphate nucleosides was performed by overnight incubation at 37 °C with 10 μl of 50 mm ammonium acetate/acetic acid buffer at pH 4.6 containing a home-made mixture of RNase T1 and RNase T2 (23Grosjean H. Keith G. Droogmans L. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 265: 357-392PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting hydrolysates were then analyzed by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography on 10 × 10-cm cellulose plates as described elsewhere together with the necessary reference maps (23Grosjean H. Keith G. Droogmans L. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 265: 357-392PubMed Google Scholar). Localization of radioactive spots on the thin layer plates and evaluation of their relative radioactivity were performed after exposure of the plates to a PhosphorImager screen followed by scanning with a STORM instrument (Amersham Biosciences). Using this approach, the optimal experimental conditions described above for testing tRNA methylation were obtained by varying the nature of the buffering system, the nature and concentration of monovalent salt and Mg2+ ions, and the protein and tRNA stabilizers such as bovine serum albumin and polyuridilic acid. Maximum activity of PAB1283 protein was obtained in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 5 mm MgCl2, 40 μg/ml polyuridylic acid, and 100 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin. For testing the incorporation of the tritiated methyl group into tRNA, the same reaction mixture as described above was used, except that unlabeled bulk E. coli tRNA (Sigma) and methyl-3H-labeled AdoMet (15 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) were used as substrate and methyl donor, respectively. Evaluation of tritium incorporation into tRNA was measured after trichloroacetic acid precipitation of the nucleic acid and filtration on a Millipore membrane. COG1041 Proteins Are Almost Ubiquitous in Archaea and Eukaryota—A search of the nonredundant protein data base from NCBI using the PSI-BLAST tool (24Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59929) Google Scholar) and PAB1283 sequence as query revealed a set of 20 full-length closely related proteins (hits reported in the first iteration with E values below 10-14 and sequence identity above 30%), all from Archaea. Among more distantly related proteins, eukaryotic sequences were detected in the second iteration, such as AAQ10284 from Homo sapiens (gi33329797) and Yol124c from S. cerevisiae (gi6324448). Reciprocal data base searches yielded 41 presumed orthologs from Eukaryota and Archaea grouped in COG1041. No close homologs (E value below 10-12 in the second iteration) with full-length sequence matching to PAB1283 were found among Bacteria, except closely related proteins from Bacillus anthracis A2012 and Bacillus cereus ATCC14579. However, reciprocal BLAST searches revealed no further close bacterial homologs of these proteins, suggesting that COG1041 members are not generic to Bacteria and might have been introduced to this domain by horizontal gene transfer. Remarkably, another related sequence, Vng2242c, was detected in the archaeon Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 but matched only the C-terminal part of all of the other COG1041 sequences. After analysis of the corresponding nucleic acid sequence (NC_002607), we found that a 322-amino acid polypeptide exhibiting significant similarity to all COG1041 proteins along the whole sequence would be encoded by the reverse strand from a GTG codon at 1,669,809 (and not from the ATG reported by genome annotators at 1,669,326). Except for the early divergent eukaryon Encephalitozoon cuniculi that has an exceptionally small genome, all of the sequenced Archaea and Eukaryota were found to have at least one PAB1283 homolog. Fig. 1 shows the results of an NCBI conserved domain search with PAB1283 as the query (14Marchler-Bauer A. Anderson J.B. DeWeese-Scott C. Fedorova N.D. Geer L.Y. He S. Hurwitz D.I. Jackson J.D.

All of the sequences from COG1041 encompass two conserved domains: a THUMP domain (15Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 215-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) in the N terminus (pfam 02926) and an MTase domain in the C terminus (pfam 01170). Fig. 1 also presents a sequence alignment of the COG1041 C-terminal regions from a selection of 10 representative organisms, revealing a pattern of conserved motifs characteristic of an AdoMet-dependent MTase. Both the AdoMet-binding and the catalytic residues are located within a single domain with an α/β Rossmann-like fold. Assuming that the THUMP domain is primarily involved in substrate binding (15Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 215-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the linear arrangement of structural elements seen in the COG1041 proteins makes them members of the ζ class of Rossmann fold MTases (16Fauman E.B.

Asp185, Asp208, and Asp235 are predicted to coordinate the methionine moiety via a water molecule (28Bugl H. Fauman E.B. Staker B.L. Zheng F. Kushner S.R. Saper M.A. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2008416165,"In the present study, we showed that a single-dose treatment of normal breast epithelial cell line, MCF10A, for 72 h with cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) resulted in a transformed phenotype. The anchorage-dependent growth of these cells was decreased due to increased cell cycle arrest in S-G2/M phase; however, the surviving cells developed resistance due to an increased Bcl-xL to Bax ratio. Levels of PCNA and gadd45 proteins--involved in DNA repair in response to genomic damage--were increased, suggesting that the cells were responding to CSC-induced genomic damage. The transformation of MCF10A cells was determined by their colony-forming efficiency in soft-agar in an anchorage-independent manner. CSC-treated MCF10A cells efficiently formed colonies in soft-agar. We then re-established cell lines from the soft-agar colonies and further examined the persistence of their transforming characteristics. The re-established cell lines, when plated after 17 passages without CSC treatment, still formed colonies in the soft-agar. An increased staining of neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) further showed a transformation characteristic of MCF10A cells treated with CSC. In summary, our results suggest that CSC is capable of transforming the MCF10A cells in vitro, supporting the role of cigarette smoking and increased risk for breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1995114552,"RASSF1A, a major member of the RASSF1 gene family, is silenced by promoter methylation at a high frequency in a large number of human solid tumors. Controlled expression of RASSF1A reverts the tumorigenic phenotype of several human cancer cell lines. Here we investigated another main isoform, RASSF1C, and compared it with RASSF1A in the gene inactivation test (GIT), based on a tetracycline regulation system. In the small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) line U2020, only RASSF1A has shown growth inhibitory activity in vitro, while in the prostate cell line LNCaP and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) line KRC/Y both RASSF1A and RASSF1C showed similar (approximately 90%) suppressing activity in vitro. Both RASSF1C and RASSF1A suppressed the tumorigenicity of the KRC/Y RCC cell line in SCID mice. Mutations, deletions and loss of expression of RASSF1A and RASSF1C transgenes were identified in all 15 grown SCID tumors. In contrast, the mutant RASSF1A containing Cys65Arg and Val211Ala had reduced growth suppression activity both in vitro and in vivo and did not show any further changes in four grown SCID tumors. In addition, RASSF1C was shown to induce cell cycle arrest in KRC/Y cells. These results strongly imply that like RASSF1A the RASSF1C gene could serve a tumor suppressor function."

In this study a pharmacological approach was used to determine the metabolic pathways involved in the formation of protease-resistant PrP (PrPres) in three prion-infected cell lines (ScN2a, SMB, and ScGT1 cells). Daily treatment of these cells with phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibitors for 7 days prevented the accumulation of PrPres. Glucocorticoids with anti-PLA2 activity also prevented the formation of PrPres and reduced the infectivity of SMB cells. Treatment with platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonists also reduced the PrPres content of cells, while the addition of PAF reversed the inhibitory effect of PLA2 inhibitors on PrPres formation. ScGT1 cells treated with PLA2 inhibitors or PAF antagonists for 7 days remained clear of detectable PrPres when grown in control medium for a further 12 weeks. Treatment of non-infected cells with PLA2 inhibitors or PAF antagonists reduced PrPC levels suggesting that limiting cellular PrPC may restrict prion formation in infected cells.

However, recent studies demonstrated that the propagation of PrPSc within prion-infected cells could be reduced following re-routing the trafficking of PrPC following treatment with suramin (7Gilch S. Winklhofer K.F. Groschup M.H. Nunziante M. Lucassen R. Spielhaupter C. Muranyi W. Riesner D. Tatzelt J. Schatzl H.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3957-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Other studies have also shown that restricting the supply, or alterations in the trafficking, of PrPC can prevent the formation of PrPSc (8Taraboulos A. Scott M. Semenov A. Avrahami D. Laszlo L.

In the present study we tested the hypothesis that the trafficking of PrPC within cells, that is vital to PrPSc formation, is controlled by activation of specific signaling pathways. Previous studies have variously reported that PrPC is associated with activation of the tyrosine kinases Fyn (12Mouillet-Richard S. Ermonval M. Chebassier C. Laplanche J.L. Lehmann S. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. Science. 2000; 289: 1925-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), with the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A pathway (13Chiarini L.B. Freitas A.R. Zanata S.M. Brentani R.R. Martins V.R. Linden R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3317-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), or with the phospholipase A2 (PLA2)/cyclo-oxygenase (COX) pathway (14Bate C. Rutherford S. Gravenor M. Reid S. Williams A. Neuroreport. 2002; 13: 1933-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, in this study, a pharmacological approach was used to investigate the role of signal transduction mechanisms on levels of PrPC in non-infected cells, and PrPSc in scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cell lines (ScN2a, ScGT1, or SMB cells). These studies indicate that activation of PLA2 and the production of platelet-activating factor (PAF) (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), a bioactive phospholipid that is not stored in a preformed state (15Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 419-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) but rapidly synthesized in neurons in response to cell specific stimuli via the remodeling pathway (16Aihara M. Ishii S. Kume K. Shimizu T. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), are essential factors in the production of PrPSc. PrPres Production—Scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells (ScN2a cells; gift from Dr. M. Rogers, University College, Dublin, Ireland) that produce PrPSc and infectious agent, were grown in Hams F12 medium containing 2 mm glutamine, standard antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) and 2% fetal calf serum. SMB cells (TSE Resource Centre, Institute for Animal Health, Compton, UK), which also produce PrPSc and infectious agent, were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing standard antibiotics, 2 mm glutamine and 2% fetal calf serum. ScGT1 cells (supplied by Dr. Sylvain Lehmann, CNRS-IGH, Montpellier, France), an immortalized murine hypothalamic neuronal cell line infected by the scrapie Chandler isolate and that persistently expresses PrPres, were grown in Optimem supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 5% fetal calf serum, and standard antibiotics. To measure the effect of drugs on PrPres formation, cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well in 6-well microtiter plates in the presence or absence of drugs. Cells were then grown with daily changes of media and PrPres production was evaluated after 7 days. Non-infected N2a cells or SMB cells that had been “cured” of infectivity by serial passages in the presence of pentosan polysulphate (PS cells) (17Birkett C.R. Hennion R.M. Bembridge D.A. Clarke M.C. Chree A. Bruce M.E. Bostock C.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3351-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) were used as controls. For time course experiments, ScN2a cells were plated at 5 × 106 cells/well in the presence or absence of dexamethasone and collected after 24, 48, or 72 h. At the end of the treatment, cells were detached and counted to establish cell numbers. Evaluation of Infectivity—To challenge mice directly, cultured SMB cells were detached and counted, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline then put through one rapid freeze-thaw cycle. The homogenate was precipitated, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and finally homogenized in sterile 0.9% (w/v) saline at 2.5 × 106 cell equivalents/ml. Mice under halothane anesthesia were injected intracerebrally with 30 μl (7.5 × 104 cell equivalents) of this homogenate. Mice were monitored for clinical signs of scrapie until reaching a predefined clinical end point. All animal work was conducted strictly according to local and national guidelines. Cell Lysates—Lysates were made from ScN2a, SMB, or ScGT1 cells to evaluate PrPres content. Cells were detached and counted, washed twice in PBS and finally suspended in an extraction buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate at 1 × 107 cells/ml. Samples were sonicated at 4 °C for 10 min, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 1 min. The supernatant was digested with proteinase K at 10 μg/ml for 1 h at 37 °C, digestion was blocked with 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and samples were then halved; one half was tested for PrP by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; see below) and the other examined by PrP Western blot. This second sample was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C; the pellet was dissolved in 50 μl of Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad), boiled for 5 min and 20 μl subjected to electrophoresis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred onto a Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by semidry blotting. Membranes were blocked using 10% milk powder in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20. PrPres was detected by incubation with mAb SAF83 (a gift from J. Grassi, CEA, Saclay, France) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by a secondary anti-mouse IgG conjugated to peroxidase (1 h at room temperature). Detection of bound antibody was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Lysates were also made from the non-infected N2a cells to evaluate PrPC content. Cells were treated as above except that proteinase K digestion was excluded. PrP ELISA—PrP in lysates was measured using a PrP-specific ELISA as previously described (18Bate C. Salmona M. Diomede L. Williams A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14983-14990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, Nunc Maxisorb Immunoplates were coated with antibodies isolated from rabbit antiserum raised to the ovine PrP100-111 peptide conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (gift from Dr. J. P. M. Langeveld, Central Institute for Animal Disease Control, Lelystad, The Netherlands). Cell lysates were applied, and specific binding was detected by mAb SAF83 (gift from Prof. J. Grassi, CEA, Saclay, France), followed by an anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma) and an appropriate indicator. Results were calculated by reference to a standard curve of recombinant murine PrP (Prionics, Zurich, Switzerland). The detection limit of this assay is 50 pg/ml. Drugs—Dexamethasone, prednisolone, prednisone, hydrocortisone, ibuprofen, acetyl salicylic acid, nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), AACOCF3, aristolochic acid, bromoenol lactone (BEL), and neomycin sulfate were obtained from Sigma. Cytidine-5-diphosphocholine (CDP), caffeic acid, 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (PAF), and 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol-3-phospho-(N,N,N-trimethyl)-hexanolamine (hexa-PAF) were obtained from Novabiochem (Nottingham, UK). C-PAF, CV-6209, SQ-22536, U73122, and ethyl-18-OCH3 were obtained from Biomol (Exeter, UK). Prostaglandin (PG)E2 Assay—Analysis of cellular PGE2 levels was determined in cells by using an enzyme immunoassay kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This assay is based on competition between unlabeled PGE2 in the sample and a fixed amount of labeled PGE2 for a PGE2-specific antibody. The detection limit of this assay is 20 pg/ml. Statistical Analysis—Comparison of treatment effects were carried out using one and two way analysis of variance techniques as appropriate. Post-hoc comparisons of means were performed as necessary. For all statistical tests, significance was set at the 5% level. PLA2 Inhibitors Reduce the PrPres Content of Three Prion-infected Cell Lines—In an initial screening experiment, the effects of drugs that inhibit some of the common signal transduction pathways were investigated for their effects on the PrPres content of ScN2a cells. ScN2a cells treated daily for 7 days with one of four different PLA2 inhibitors (1 μm CDP, 1 μg/ml aristolochic acid, 1 μm BEL, or 1 μg/ml AACOCF3) contained significantly less PrPres than did untreated cells. In contrast, the levels of PrPres in ScGT1 cells were not significantly affected by treatment with three inhibitors of phospholipase C (Table I and Fig. 1). To confirm the effects of PLA2 inhibitors on PrPres production, two other prion-infected neuroblastoma cell lines (SMB and ScGT1 cells) were also treated with these drugs. The PrPres content of SMB or ScGT1 cells, treated with CDP, aristolochic acid, BEL, or AACOCF3 was also greatly reduced. Even at concentrations 10 times higher than those used in these experiments, the drugs used did not alter cell survival or cell growth (data not shown).Table IPLA2 inhibitors reduced the PrPres content of prion-infected cell linesPrpressEnzymeDrugScN2aSMBScGT1pg/1 × 107 cells ± S.D.Control1047 ± 2022193 ± 2496118 ± 332Phospholipase CNeomycin sulfate (10 μm)955 ± 572245 ± 1886238 ± 348U-73122 (5 μm)1032 ± 932303 ± 2046407 ± 404Ethyl-18-OCH3 (10 μm)1052 ± 1152150 ± 1386082 ± 429Phospholipase A2CDP (1 μm)<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.BEL (1 μm)<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.Aristolochic acid (0.5 μg/ml)<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.100 ± 78aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.167 ± 60aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.AACOCF3 (1 μg/ml)<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.a PrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.

In further studies, the inhibitory effects of dexamethasone on PrPres content of ScN2a cells was shown to be dose-dependent (Fig. 2). SMB and ScGT1 cells treated with dexamethasone also demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in PrPres (data not shown).Table IIGlucocorticoids reduce the PrPres content of prion-infected cell linesPrPresDrugScN2aSMBScGT1pg/1 × 107 cells ± S.D.None1104 ± 1482004 ± 2615848 ± 435Dexamethasone (1 μm)<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.Hydrocortisone (1 μm)<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.Prednisolone (1 μm)<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.Prednisone 1 (μm)1142 ± 981983 ± 2245985 ± 389a PrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells. Open table in a new tab The effects of 1 μm dexamethasone on ScN2a cells were not immediate as levels of PrPres in treated cells were not significantly different from control cells after 24 h (1009 pg/ml ± 48 in treated cells versus 1112 pg/ml ± 97 in untreated cells, n = 8 independent observations, mean PrPres± S.D.) but they were significantly reduced after 48 h (561 pg/ml ± 116 versus 1129 pg/ml ± 76, n = 8, p < 0.05) and further reduced after 72 h (66 pg/ml ± 55 versus 1076 pg/ml ± 77, n = 8, p < 0.05). We were unable to detect PrPres in cells that had been treated for 4 days or more with 1 μm dexamethasone. When ScN2a cells that had been treated with 1 μm dexamethasone for 7 days were then grown for a further 12 weeks in drug-free medium these cells remained clear of detectable amounts of PrPres (<50 pg/ml). Similarly, SMB or ScGT1 that had been treated with 1 μm dexamethasone for 7 days remained clear of detectable amounts of PrPres when grown in drug-free medium for 12 weeks. PLA2 Inhibitors Reduce PGE2 Production in Prion-infected Cells—PrP peptides increase PLA2 activity resulting in the production of PGE2 (14Bate C. Rutherford S. Gravenor M. Reid S. Williams A. Neuroreport. 2002; 13: 1933-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the present study the levels of PGE2 were significantly raised in prion-infected cells when compared with their non-infected counterparts, which suggests that prion infection activates PLA2 pathways in neurons. Prion-infected cells treated with 1 μm CDP, 1 μg/ml AACOCF3, or 1 μm dexamethasone produced significantly less PGE2 than did untreated cells showing that drug treatment did indeed inhibit PLA2 (Fig. 3). PAF Antagonists Block PrPres Formation—The effects of downstream pathways following PLA2 activation on the formation of PrPres were investigated. Arachidonic acid, released from membrane phospholipids by PLA2, is converted to leucotrienes and prostaglandins by the lipoxygenase (LOX) and COX enzymes respectively. Because the PrPres content of ScN2a, SMB or ScGT1 cells was not affected by treatment with the LOX or COX inhibitors, other factors produced following PLA2 activation were therefore examined. PAF is generated in neurons by the remodeling pathway following PLA2 activation (16Aihara M. Ishii S. Kume K. Shimizu T. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and the PrPres content of cells was reduced following treatment with the PAF antagonists hexa-PAF, CV-6209, ginkgolide A, or ginkgolide B (Table III). These PAF antagonists did not affect the survival, or growth rates of prion-infected cells. All four PAF antagonists caused a dose-dependent reduction in the PrPres content of ScN2a cells (Fig. 4), and there was a highly significant relationship between the level of PrPres and the concentration of PAF antagonist (p < 0.05) for all 4 drugs. We noted that at each concentration, PrPres levels were greater in cells treated with gingkolide A compared with gingkolide B (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the PrPres content of ScN2a cells was reduced to below detectable levels following 7 days of treatment with 2 μm PAF antagonists (<50pg/1 × 107 cells). Treatment with the PAF antagonists also caused a dose-dependent reduction in the PrPres content of SMB and ScGT1 cells. Furthermore, ScN2a, SMB, or ScGT1 cells treated with 2 μm hexa-PAF, or with 2 μm ginkgolide B, for 7 days remained free of detectable PrPres when grown in drug-free medium for a further 12 weeks (data not shown).Table IIIPAF antagonists prevent PrPres formation in prion-infected cellsPrPresEnzymeDrugScN2aSMBScGT1pg/1 × 107 cells ± S.D.Control1047 ± 2022193 ± 2496118 ± 388COXAspirin955 ± 572245 ± 1886238 ± 348Ibuprofen1032 ± 932303 ± 2046407 ± 404LOXNDGA1052 ± 1152150 ± 1386082 ± 429Caffeic acid985 ± 1481894 ± 2685958 ± 482PAF antagonistsHexa-PAF<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.CV-620955 ± 25aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.100 ± 78aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.167 ± 60aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.Ginkgolide A80 ± 34aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.159 ± 38aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.Ginkgolide B<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.<50aPrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells.a PrPres content of cells significantly less (p < 0.05) than that of untreated cells. Open table in a new tab PAF Increases PrPres Formation—To compliment the PAF antagonist studies, prion-infected cells were grown in medium containing PAF agonists. The PrPres content of cells treated with PAF agonists (2 μm PAF or 2 μm C-PAF) were significantly higher than untreated cells (Table IV and Fig. 5). The PAF agonists had no effect on the survival, growth rates, or protein concentration of ScN2a, SMB, or ScGT1 cells. While PAF caused an increase in the PrPres content of all cell types, the increase in ScN2a cells was only 30%. PAF agonist had a greater effect on SMB cells, nearly doubling PrPres content, and, on ScGT1 cells, the PrPres content was increased 2–3-fold. To determine if the addition of PAF could restore PrPres production to prion-infected cells treated with PLA2 inhibitors, ScN2a cells were treated with a mixture containing PLA2 inhibitors (1 μm CDP, 1 μg/ml AACOCF3, or 1 μm dexamethasone) and 2 μm PAF. The addition of PAF was able to restore PrPres levels in ScN2a cells co-treated with PLA2 inhibitors or dexamethasone (Fig. 6).Table IVPAF agonists increase the PrPres prion-infected cellsPrPresScN2aSMBScGT1pg/1 × 107 cells ± S.D.Control1047 ± 2022193 ± 2496079 ± 542PAF (2 μm)1371 ± 903584 ± 33218528 ± 3325C-PAF (2 μm)1320 ± 643169 ± 40412484 ± 1842 Open table in a new tab Fig. 6PAF reverses the inhibition of PrPres formation by PLA2 inhibitors.

The PrPC content of untreated N2a cells (33.2 ± 2.9 ng/1 × 107 cells) was significantly higher than that of cells treated with PLA2 inhibitors (1 μm CDP: 12.8 ± 3.2, n = 9, p < 0.05; 1 μg/ml AACOCF3: 2.5 ± 2.1, n = 9, p < 0.05; or 1 μm dexamethasone: 8.4 ± 2.4, n = 9, p < 0.05), or with the PAF antagonists 2 μm hexa-PAF (1.1 ± 1.2, n = 9, p < 0.05), 1 μm CV-6209 (6.8 ± 1.4, n = 9, p < 0.05), 1 μm ginkgolide A (1.5 ± 1.7, n = 9, p < 0.05), or 1 μm ginkgolide B (0.4 ± 0.8, n = 9, p < 0.05). All PAF antagonists used caused a dose-dependent reduction in the levels of PrPC in N2a cells, and there was a highly significant relationship between PAF antagonist concentration and PrPC levels (p < 0.05). In addition, the type of ginkgolide used had a significant effect on PrPC levels (p < 0.05) with cells treated with ginkgolide A containing more PrPC than cells treated with the same concentration of ginkgolide B (Fig. 7). Time course studies showed that PrPC levels were reduced within 24 h and remained low in the presence of any of the PAF antagonists for up to 7 days. However, even after prolonged treatment (7 days), removal of the PAF antagonists resulted in PrPC levels returning to normal within 24 h. Conversely, the PrPC content of N2a cells treated with PAF agonists, 2 μm PAF (74.6 ± 4.8, n = 9, p < 0.05), or 2 μm C-PAF (58.9 ± 3.8, n = 9, p < 0.05) was significantly higher than that of untreated N2a cells. The PrPC formed in N2a cells treated with PAF agonists remained sensitive to digestion with proteinase K. Dexamethasone Reduces the Infectivity of SMB Cells—Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid widely used in medical practice. It has various mechanisms of action, including inhibition of PLA2. To determine if dexamethasone-treated SMB cells retained infectivity, C57/Bl mice were inoculated via the intracerebral route with homogenates from untreated SMB cells or SMB cells treated for 7 days with 200 nm dexamethasone. The mean incubation period in mice inoculated with lysates from dexamethasone-treated cells (206 ± 8 days) (incubation period ± S.D.) was significantly longer than in mice inoculated with lysates from untreated SMB cells (179 ± 6 days; n = 8 mice in each group, p < 0.05). In the present study we utilized a pharmacological approach to determine the metabolic pathways that underlie the formation of PrPres in three prion-infected neuroblastoma cell lines (ScN2a, ScGT1, and SMB cells). In a broad screen of compounds we found that 4 different drugs that inhibit PLA2 (aristolochic acid, AACOCF3, BEL, and CDP) reduced the PrPres content of prion-infected cells. The concentrations of the PLA2 inhibitors used were at least 10 times less than the concentration of these drugs that had a toxic effect and treatment with PLA2 inhibitors did not affect total cellular protein levels. 2C. Bate and A. Williams, unpublished data. We confirmed that the drugs used inhibited PLA2 by measuring levels of PGE2 (a marker of PLA2 activity). In the present study prion-infected cells treated with CDP, aristolochic acid or AACOCF3 produced significantly less PGE2 than untreated cells. It is of interest to note that none of the drugs completely inhibited PLA2 activity, possibly because there exist several distinct enzymes with PLA2 activity including cytosolic (cPLA2) and secretory (sPLA2) isozymes (19Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kuwata H. Kudo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although aristolochic acid and CDP inhibit both cPLA2 and sPLA2, low concentrations of AACOCF3 or BEL, which are reported to selectively inhibit cPLA2 (20Kolko M. de E.B. Diemer N.H. Bazan N.G. Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 338: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), inhibited PrPres formation (Table I) indicating that cPLA2 may be the isozyme of interest.

https://openalex.org/W2026170190,"The protein MIA (melanoma inhibitory activity) is highly expressed in malignant melanomas but not in melanocytes. Furthermore, expression of MIA correlates with tumor progression in vivo. Here, MIA-dependent changes of gene expression after long-term inhibition of MIA expression in the human melanoma cell line HMB2 were investigated. Primarily, we observed characteristic changes in cell morphology, and also found re-established cell–cell contacts in MIA-deficient cell clones grown in monolayer culture. Real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) showed a downregulation of N-cadherin expression and a reinduction of E-cadherin expression in the MIA-deficient cell clones. Further, both cancer cDNA array and protein arrays verified a marked downregulation of several other melanoma-associated genes (e.g. membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase tissue-type plasminogen activator integrin β3, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteins and fibronectin) in the MIA-deficient melanoma cells, confirmed by real-time RT–PCR and Western blotting. As all these molecules are associated with migration, the effect of MIA on migration of human primary melanocytes was analysed. In the presence of MIA, we observed enhanced migratory ability of melanocytic cells, induction of melanoma-associated genes as well as inhibition of apoptosis due to anoikis. These results suggest that expression of MIA promotes melanoma progression by inducing further melanoma-associated genes."

We investigated the interaction between Arg668 and the ring oxygen of the incoming deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) using a combination of site-specific mutagenesis of the protein and atomic substitution of the DNA and dNTP. Hydrogen bonds from Arg668 were probed with the site-specific mutant R668A. Hydrogen bonds from the DNA were probed with oligodeoxynucleotides containing either guanine or 3-deazaguanine (3DG) at the primer terminus. Hydrogen bonds from the incoming dNTP were probed with (1 ′R,3 ′R,4 ′R)-1-[3-hydroxy-4-(triphosphorylmethyl)cyclopent-1-yl]uracil (dcUTP), an analog of dUTP in which the ring oxygen of the deoxyribose moiety was replaced by a methylene group. We found that the pre-steady-state parameter kpol was decreased 1,600 to 2,000-fold with each of the single substitutions. When the substitutions were combined, there was no additional decrease (R668A and 3DG), a 5-fold decrease (3DG and dcUTP), and a 50-fold decrease (R668A and dcUTP) in kpol. These results are consistent with a hydrogen-bonding fork from Arg668 to the primer terminus and incoming dNTP. These interactions may play an important role in fidelity as well as catalysis of DNA replication.

These interactions may play an important role in fidelity as well as catalysis of DNA replication. The high fidelity of DNA replication synthesis is accomplished despite the similarity in energy between correctly and incorrectly paired bases (1Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Boosalis M.S. Sowers L.C.

Spratt, manuscript in preparation. of DNA replication.The question that we address in this manuscript is how the interaction at the primer terminus influences the rate of incorporation of the incoming dNTP. The ternary crystal structures of Taq (13Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) and T7 (14Doubli S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar) DNA polymerases bound to DNA and an incoming dNTP show that while one imino group of the critical arginine residue is in hydrogen bonding distance with the O2-cytosine (Taq polymerase) or N-3-adenine (T7 polymerase) with primer terminus, the other imino group may potentially form a hydrogen bond with the ring oxygen of the incoming dNTP. This interaction may be the mechanism by which disruption of the arginine-primer terminus hydrogen bond decreases the rate of polymerization. To examine this hypothesis we compared the kinetic parameters of the reactions containing wild-type Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) with the exocyclic exonuclease activity inactivated (KF-) or the R668A mutant, DNA containing guanine or 3-deazaguanine at the primer terminus, and dUTP or its carbocyclic analog (1′R,3′R,4′R)-1-[3-hydroxy-4-(triphosphorylmethyl)cyclopent-1-yl]uracil (dcUTP). In each of these nucleotide analogs, a heteroatom is replaced by a carbon (Fig. 1). Thus, if a hydrogen-bonding interaction from Arg668 to either position was important, then the analogs should exhibit reduced rates of reaction or reduced binding to the polymerase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneral—[32P]ATP was purchased from Amersham Biosciences at 6,000 Ci/mmol. T4 polynucleotide kinase and the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I with the exonuclease activity inactivated (KF-) were obtained from United States Biochemical. The double mutant R668A and D424A KF was a gift from Catherine Joyce of Yale University. The D424A mutation knocks out the proofreading exonuclease activity. The dNTPs (ultrapure grade) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and the concentrations were determined by UV absorbance (29Dunn D.B. Hall R.H. Fasman G.D. Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1986: 65-215Google Scholar). dcUTP was synthesized as described in the supplemental literature (see supplemental material).The oligonucleotides containing 3DG were synthesized, purified by PAGE followed by reverse-phase HPLC, and characterized by enzymatic hydrolysis with HPLC analysis (23Spratt T.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13292-13297Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 24Spratt T.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2647-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The concentrations of oligodeoxynucleotides were determined from the absorbance at 260 nm, using the method of Borer (30Borer P. Fasman G.D. Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1977: 589Google Scholar) in which it was assumed that the spectroscopic properties of 3DG were identical to G. The primer was 32P-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and annealed with a 50% excess of the template as described previously (24Spratt T.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2647-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Pre-steady-state Kinetics—Rapid reactions were initiated by the addition of 15.9 μl of dNTP and MgCl2 in water to 16.4 μl of DNA-enzyme solution at 25 °C with a KinTek-3 rapid quench instrument. Slow reactions were carried out by hand. The composition of the buffer during the reaction was 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA. Typically the DNA concentration was 20 nm, and the polymerase concentration was 50 nm. The concentration of dNTPs varied from 0 to 1,000 μm. The reactions were quenched by the addition of 300 mm EDTA.Product Analysis by PAGE—The progress of the reaction was analyzed by denaturing PAGE in 20% acrylamide (19:1, acrylamide:N,N′-methylene bisacrylamide), 7 m urea in 1× TBE buffer (0.089 m Tris, 0.089 m boric acid, 0.002 m Na2EDTA). The size of the gel was 40 × 33 × 0.4 cm and was run at 2,500 V for 2-2.5 h. The radioactivity on the gel was visualized with a Bio-Rad GS 250 Molecular Imager. The progress of the reaction was quantitated by dividing the total radioactivity in the product band(s) by the radioactivity in the product and reactant bands. Multiple product bands appeared when the incorrect dNTP was added to the reaction.Data Analysis—Data were fitted by nonlinear regression using the program Prism version 4.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA (www.graphpad.com)). The time course data were fit to Equation 1, where P is the product formed, A is the total amount of DNA reacted, and k is the first order rate constant for the dNTP incorporation. The kpol and Kd values were obtained by fitting k to [dNTP] according to Equation 2. [ P=A(1−e−kt) (Eq. 1) k=kpol[dNTP]/([dNTP]+Kd) (Eq. 2) RESULTSThe interactions between Arg668, the minor groove of the primer terminus, and the ring oxygen of the incoming dNTP were evaluated kinetically using R668A, oligodeoxynucleotides with 3DG at the primer terminus, and dcUTP. These substitutions will be effective in examining the proposed interactions only if each modification does not drastically alter the chemistry of the enzyme or nucleotide analog except at the site of modification.

Since [KF-] > [DNA], the formation of product could be fit to a first order equation.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2647-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the present study, the G to 3DG substitution caused a 2,000-fold decrease in kpol (reaction 1 versus 2 in Table I), while with G as the template base the Arg668 to Ala substitution induced a 1,600-fold decrease in kpol (reaction 1 versus 3). The double substitution of G to 3DG and Arg668 to Ala668 did not cause any additional decrease in kpol from the single modifications (reactions 2 and 3 versus 4). The observation that the effects of the two substitutions were not cumulative indicates that there is a hydrogen bond interaction between Arg668 and the N-3-position of guanine at the primer terminus (24Spratt T.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2647-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).In similar experiments, we examined the relationship between Arg668 and the deoxyribose ring oxygen of the incoming dNTP. The replacement of dUTP by dcUTP decreased the kpol ∼1,200-fold with a 4-fold increase in Kd (reaction 1 versus 5). Thus, the ring oxygen is very important to reactivity but only slightly affects the binding of the dNTP. The double substitution of Arg to Ala and dUTP to dcUTP resulted in a 50-fold decrease in kpol from either of the single substitutions (reactions 3 and 5 versus 7). This decrease in rate falls between no effect and the ∼1,500-fold decrease in kpol caused by the single substitutions. This result suggests that there is an interaction between Arg668 and the ring oxygen. However, the lack of this hydrogen bond does not entirely explain the decrease in kpol caused by the dUTP to dcUTP substitution.We also examined the relationship between the ring oxygen of dUTP and the 3-position of guanine at the primer terminus. As discussed above, the decrease in rates associated with the individual substitution of G with 3DG and dUTP with dcUTP indicate the importance of these sites (reaction 1 versus 2 and 5). The double substitution decreased the kpol only 5-fold from the single substitutions (reactions 2 and 5 versus 6). The rate reduction is insignificant with respect to the expected 2,000-fold reduction that would be observed if the substitution were independent of each other. Consequently, these reactions indicate the ring oxygen of dUTP interacts with the minor groove of the primer terminus of the DNA. Since the crystal structures do not indicate a direct interaction between these two positions, a likely explanation is that they interact through the arginine fork.Examination of the double substitutions versus the triple substitutions shows similar results and supports a mechanistic connection between the three moieties. No decrease in kpol was observed with the G to 3DG substitution to the reaction involving R668A and dcUTP (reaction 7 versus 8). The decrease in rate for the substitution of R668A for KF- with dcUTP and 3DG is only 10-fold (reaction 6 versus 8). A 100-fold decrease in rate was observed with the dUTP to dcUTP change with R668A and 3DG on the DNA (reaction 5 versus 8).In summary, the substitutions significantly affect the kpol and only slightly the Kd parameter. The results strongly support two interactions between 1) Arg668 and the N-3-position of G at the primer terminus and 2) the deoxyribose ring oxygen of the incoming dNTP and N-3-position of G at the primer terminus. In addition, there also appears to be a connection between Arg668 and the deoxyribose ring oxygen of the incoming dNTP.DISCUSSIONOne mechanism by which polymerases can replicate Watson-Crick base pairs is by geometric selection. For this to occur, the polymerases must have contact points with the DNA at positions in which the topology and chemistry is indistinguishable among the four base pairs. The minor groove is thought to be important for base pair independent contacts because the N-3-position of purines and the O2-position of pyrimidines occupy similar steric positions and have similar chemistry, that of being hydrogen bond acceptors (10Seeman N.C. Rosenberg J.M. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 804-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, x-ray crystal structures of several polymerases have shown that there are interactions between the minor groove of the DNA and the polymerase (11Pelletier H.

Spratt, manuscript in preparation. of the protein and may play a role in the transfer of the DNA between the catalytic and exonuclease sites (22Hendrickson C.L. Devine K.G. Benner S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2241-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this manuscript, we have described experiments indicating that in addition to forming a hydrogen bond with the N-3-position of guanine at the primer terminus it also forms a hydrogen bond with the deoxyribose ring oxygen of the incoming dNTP.Ternary crystal structures of two family A polymerases, T7 and Taq DNA polymerases, support the existence of this hydrogen bonding fork. These crystal structures contain DNA and an incoming dideoxynucleotide triphosphate bound to the polymerase in the “closed conformation” and may represent a catalytically active intermediate in the reaction. The crystal structure of T7 DNA polymerase (Protein Data Bank code 1t7p) shows that one imino group of Arg429 is 2.86 Å from the N-3-position of adenine at the primer terminus while the other imino group is 2.82 Å from the deoxyribose ring oxygen of the incoming 2′,3′-dideoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate (14Doubli S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). With Taq DNA polymerase (Protein Data Bank code 3ktaq) the respective distances are 2.58 and 3.44 Å (13Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). These distances are short enough to speculate that hydrogen bonds occur between these groups during catalysis.The interaction of Arg668 with the minor groove of the primer terminus and the incoming dNTP can aid in recognizing whether the DNA has Watson-Crick geometry. The distance from the deoxyribose ring oxygen to the minor groove hydrogen bond acceptor on the 5′-base is ∼3.5 Å with correctly paired bases. However, this distance is altered on both sides of most mispairs. Thus, in addition to the relative position of the minor groove hydrogen bond acceptors, the absolute distance between the deoxyribose ring oxygen and the adjacent minor groove hydrogen bond acceptor may be a physical property that the polymerase can check to determine whether a base pair is in the Watson-Crick geometry. Thus, these interactions may explain how the rates of insertion are decreased with mispairs at either the terminal base pair or the newly forming base pair.Two mechanisms can be envisioned of how Arg668 would enhance the catalytic efficiency of correct base pairs but not mispairs, one in which Arg668 plays an active role in selecting Watson-Crick base pairs and another in which the residue plays a regulatory role. Arg668 could actively be involved in phosphodiester bond formation by aligning the incoming dNTP into correct position for reaction to occur. Its function may be to align the α-phosphate of the incoming dNTP with the 3′-hydroxyl group of the primer terminus. Alternatively, Arg668 may lower the activation energy of phosphodiester bond formation by pulling the dNTP onto the primer terminus. Due to the relative positions of the correct versus incorrect base pairs, this process would occur"

Immature cortical thymocytes express abundant nonsialylated core 1 O-glycans (Galβ1–3GalNAcα-Ser/Thr), which are the preferred ligands of PNA, giving rise to their characteristic PNAhigh phenotype. In contrast, mature medullar thymocytes express increased levels of a sialyltransferase, ST3Gal I, that sialylates the core 1 O-glycans producing a structure not recognized by PNA, Siaα2–3Galβ1–3GalNAcα-Ser/Thr (4Despont J.P.

As a result, the mature cells exhibit the PNAlow phenotype that is maintained upon their transition into the periphery. The functional significance of the glycosylation change detected by PNA has been underscored by analysis of ST3Gal I null mice in which T cells are constitutively PNAhigh (7Priatel J.J. Chui D.

These mice exhibit a striking reduction of naive CD8+ T cells due to increased apoptosis in the periphery. A major carrier of PNA receptors in CD8+ thymocytes is the CD8 glycoprotein itself (6Wu W.

Indeed, CD8 expressed on immature thymocytes (PNAhigh) binds more efficiently to the MHC class I than that expressed on mature cells (PNAlow). Consistent with these findings, the constitutively PNAhigh mature CD8+ T cells from ST3Gal I–/– mice also show increased binding to MHC class I tetramer relative to wild type PNAlow cells (9Moody A.M.

Thus, the glycosylation change detected by PNA appears to modulate CD8 function during selection and maturation of CD8+ T cells in the thymus. In the periphery, activation of T lymphocytes leads to the re-expression of a PNAhigh phenotype (7Priatel J.J. Chui D. Hiraoka N. Simmons C.J. Richardson K.B. Page D.M. Fukuda M. Varki N.M.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 641-648PubMed Google Scholar), which is the basis for the use of PNA as a marker of germinal centers in spleen, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches. By using a transgenic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection model, Galvan et al. (13Galvan M. Murali-Krishna K. Ming L.L. Baum L. Ahmed R. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 641-648PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that CD8+ T cells are converted to the PNAhigh phenotype. As these CD8+ T cells become memory cells they exhibit an intermediate level of PNA binding (PNAint). The increase in hyposialylated core 1 O-glycans may directly impact CD8 function, as discussed above, and can potentially modulate the functions of other cell surface glycoproteins. Indeed, Weiss and colleagues (14Xu Z. Weiss A. Nat. Immun. 2002; 3: 764-771Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar) have shown that de-sialylation of the O-linked glycans of CD45 can influence its dimerization and phosphatase activity. Changes in the sialylation status of O-linked glycans have also been postulated to modulate the interactions of lymphocytes with glycan-binding proteins (15Hernandez J.D. Baum L.G. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: R127-R136Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 16Daniels M.A. Hogquist K.A. Jameson S.C. Nat.

The conversion of resting PNAlow CD8+ T cells to activated PNAhigh cells clearly results from decreased sialylation of core 1 O-glycans because peripheral CD8+ T cells in the ST3Gal I null mice are PNAhigh (7Priatel J.J. Chui D. Hiraoka N. Simmons C.J. Richardson K.B. Page D.M. Fukuda M. Varki N.M. Marth J.D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 273-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism for this change is not known. Several reports have suggested that sialidase(s) could generate PNA receptors by de-sialylating core 1 O-glycans (13Galvan M. Murali-Krishna K. Ming L.L. Baum L. Ahmed R. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 641-648PubMed Google Scholar, 18Landolfi N.F. Leone J. Womack J.E. Cook R.G. Immunogenetics. 1985; 22: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19Taira S. Nariuchi H. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 440-446PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, there is a clear increase in sialidase activity following activation of T cells (13Galvan M. Murali-Krishna K. Ming L.L. Baum L. Ahmed R. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 641-648PubMed Google Scholar, 18Landolfi N.F. Leone J. Womack J.E. Cook R.G. Immunogenetics. 1985; 22: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19Taira S. Nariuchi H. J.

However, no direct causal link between the increase of sialidase activity and increase in PNA receptors has been established. Conversely, in a study of CD4+ T cell differentiation following activation in vitro, Grabie et al. (21Grabie N. Delfs M.W. Lim Y.C. Westrich J.R. Luscinskas F.W. Lichtman A.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 2766-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the phenotypes of PNAhigh Th1 and PNAlow Th2 cells correlated with low and high expression of ST3Gal I sialyltransferase, respectively. Thus, in principle, the conversion from PNAlow to PNAhigh phenotype following activation of CD8+ T cells could be accomplished either by the action of a sialidase or down-regulated expression of a sialyltransferase. In this report we have investigated the nature of the PNA receptors on activated CD8+ T cells, and we have assessed the role of sialidases and sialyltransferases in their generation. Although multiple glycoproteins and glycolipids contribute to the increase in PNA receptors, CD45 was found to be the primary PNA receptor. Most surprisingly, the PNA receptors were not generated from pre-existing CD45 by the action of sialidases but instead were carried primarily by CD45 generated following activation of CD8+ T cells. The results suggest that the majority of PNA receptors on activated CD8+ T cells results from hyposialylation of newly synthesized core 1 O-glycans of CD45. Mice—C57Bl/6 mice (6–10 weeks old) were obtained from The Scripps Research Institute Custom Breeding core. SM/J mice (6–10 weeks old) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, MA). GM2/GD2 synthase–/– mice were kindly provided by Dr. R. Schnaar at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (22Liu Y. Hoffmann A. Grinberg A. Westphal H. McDonald M.P. Miller K.M. Crawley J.N.

Preparation and Culture of Splenocytes—To obtain single cell suspensions, spleens were ground between two frosted glass slides and passed through a 200-μm nylon mesh (Polysciences, Warrington, PA). Erythrocytes were lysed in 150 mm ammonium chloride, 10 mm potassium carbonate, and 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.2) for 5 min at room temperature, and the resulting splenocytes were resuspended in RPMI 1640 media, 5% fetal bovine serum, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were activated for 24, 48, or 72 h with immobilized anti-CD3 (15 μg/ml in sodium bicarbonate (pH 9)) (Pharmingen), in RPMI media supplemented with 40 ng/ml IL-2 and 10 ng/ml IL-4 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Resting cells were cultured for the same periods of time but without the activation stimuli. To study the effect of a sialidase inhibitor, resting and activated cells were cultured for 36 h with and without 2 mm 2,3-dehydro-2-deoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac2en) (Sigma). Staining Reagents and Flow Cytometry—FITC-labeled PNA (EY Laboratories, San Mateo, CA) and biotin-conjugated anti-asialo-GM1 (Seikagaku America, East Falmouth, MA) were used at a concentration of 2 and 5 μg/ml, respectively. FITC- and PE-labeled mouse anti-CD8 (clone 53–6.7) (Pharmingen) were used at 5 μg/ml. For fluorescence staining, cells were incubated in aliquots of 5 × 105 cells in 100 μl of PBS containing 10 mg/ml BSA with PNA-FITC for 30 min on ice. Staining with anti-asialo-GM1 was performed on ice, followed by 1 μgof streptavidin-PE (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Anti-CD8-PE or anti-CD8-FITC antibodies were co-incubated with PNA-FITC or asialo-GM1-PE, respectively, for dual color flow cytometry analysis. All samples were washed twice with 1 ml of the same buffer. Cells were gated based on viability and binding to anti-CD8 antibody. Flow cytometry data was acquired on a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using the Cellquest software system. Isolation of CD8+T Cells—CD8+ T cells were purified from freshly prepared and activated splenocytes using the MidiMACS system (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were resuspended in PBS containing 5 mg/ml BSA and2mm EDTA and incubated with anti-CD8 microbeads for 15 min at 8 °C. After washing, cells were resuspended in the same buffer and applied to the column. The purity of CD8+ T cell fractions used was ≥90% as judged by flow cytometry. Surface Biotin Labeling, PNA Precipitation, CD45 Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot—Cell surface biotin labeling was performed as described previously (9Moody A.M. Chui D. Reche P.A. Priatel J.J. Marth J.D. Reinherz E.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice in PBS (pH 8), containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2, resuspended in buffer containing EZ-link sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin (Pierce) at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml per 25 × 106 cells, and rotated at room temperature for 30 min. Labeling was terminated by washing the cells twice in PBS. For lectin precipitation, cells with or without biotinylation were lysed in PBS buffer (pH 7.2) containing 1% Triton X-100 on ice for 20 min, and the clarified supernatants were incubated with PNA-conjugated agarose (Sigma) for3hat4 °C. PNA-agarose beads were washed three times in the lysis buffer and once in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl. Precipitates were eluted with 200 mm lactose and resolved on SDS-PAGE gels. For CD45 immunoprecipitation, cells with or without biotinylation were lysed as described above, and the clarified supernatant was incubated with CD45 antibody (4 μg of antibody for 100 μg of lysates) for2hat4 °C. Protein G-agarose was added to the mixture and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads were washed as described above, and the precipitates were eluted using sample buffer. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen). After blocking, blots containing biotinylated and nonbiotinylated proteins were incubated with 5 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated PNA and HRP-conjugated streptavidin, respectively. Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Expression of Full-length Murine Neu3 in COS-7 Cells—The entire coding region of murine Neu3 was obtained by RT-PCR using primers from the published sequence (23Hasegawa T. Yamaguchi K. Wada T. Takeda A. Itoyama Y. Miyagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8007-8015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The primers sequences used are as follows: 5′-ATGGAGGAAGTCCCACCCTAC-3′ (sense); 5′-CTTTAGTCGCTACTAGGGCTG-3′ (antisense). The PCR products were cloned into pcDNA3.1/His C vector (Invitrogen). Effectene Transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used to transfect the construct into COS-7 cells that were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, washed in PBS, and lysed by sonication in 12 mm CaCl2 (pH 6.8). Sialidase activity toward the artificial substrate 2′-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid (4-MU-NANA) (Sigma) was determined by fluorometric assay. Briefly, reactions were performed in 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5) with 0.3 mm 4-MU-NANA and 0.25 mg/ml BSA in a final volume of 100 μl. Mock-transfected cells, containing the plasmid only, were used to estimate endogenous sialidase activity. A blank consisting of CaCl2 instead of cell homogenate was used to determine nonspecific degradation of the substrate. A sample containing 1 milliunit of sialidase from Vibrio cholerae (Roche Applied Science) instead of cell homogenate was used as positive control. Samples were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, and reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of sodium bicarbonate (pH 10). The fluorescent product was measured on a Packard FluoroCount™ spectrofluorometer with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm, using 4-methylumbelliferone (Sigma) to obtain a calibration curve. RNA Extraction and Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA from resting and activated CD8+ T cells was prepared using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit and treated with DNase I amplification grade (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription (RT) was performed with 2 μg of total RNA, Superscript II (Invitrogen), in a final volume of 20 μl and random hexamer primers; 2.5 μl of the reverse transcription reaction was subsequently used as template for real time PCR. The same cDNA sample was used in the analysis of multiple target genes. Real time PCR assays were performed in an ABI 7700 thermocycler using SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), according to the manufacturer's protocol, with 300 nm of each primer set. Specific primers, designed with the PrimerExpress software (Applied Biosystems), are as follows: ST3Gal I, 5′-GTCCACAACGCTCTGATGGA-3′ (sense), and 5′-CGCTCAGGTTGTTGGGTTTC-3′ (antisense); Neu3, 5′-GACCGAGGAGGTCATTGGC-3′ (sense), and 5′-CAGCCTTCCCGAGTGTAGCT-3′ (antisense); Neu1, 5′-CCAAACACGATCACGATTTCA-3′ (sense), and 5′GATGACCGAGCCATCTGGAA-3′ (antisense); Ribo-PO, 5′-AGATGCAGCAGATCCGCAT-3′ (sense), and 5′-GGATGGCCTTGCGCA-3′ (antisense). Data were normalized to the housekeeping gene ribosomal phosphoprotein (Ribo-PO). Thin Layer Chromatography Lectin Overlay—Glycolipid standards GM1 (0.1 μg) and asialo-GM1 (1 μg, Sigma) were applied to an HPTLC plate (Analtech, Newark, DE) and chromatographed in chloroform, methanol, 0.2% CaCl2 (9:8:2). After treatment with acetone containing 0.4% polyisobutylmethacrylate, plates were blocked with PBS containing 3% BSA for2hat room temperature. Plates were then washed with PBS containing 1% BSA and incubated with biotin labeled-PNA (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), at a concentration of 40 μg/ml, for 1 h at room temperature. Glycolipids bound to PNA were visualized using Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) and chemiluminescence. ST3Gal I Enzyme Assay—Fresh and activated CD8+ T cells were lysed in a buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), 1.5% Triton CF-54 with protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), spun at 6000 rpm for 5 min, and supernatants assayed for protein concentration using the BCA kit (Pierce). Enzymatic assays were carried out in duplicate using 240 μg of total protein. Controls without exogenous acceptor were used to determine endogenous ST3Gal I activity. Positive controls were performed using purified human ST3Gal I. Reaction mixtures contained 10 μg of anti-freeze glycoprotein (AFGP), 0.19 μCi of CMP-NeuAc (304 mCi/mmol), and cell lysates in a total volume of 100 μl and were performed for 16 h at 37 °C. Sialylated products were isolated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column (Sigma), eluted with 0.1 m NaCl, and quantified in a Packard scintillation counter. Increased Expression of PNA-binding Sites following in Vitro Activation of Peripheral CD8+T Cells—To investigate the molecular nature of PNA receptors and the mechanism of their generation on CD8+ T cells, conditions for in vitro activation were established to recapitulate the conversion from the PNAlow to the PNAhigh phenotype observed in vivo (24Galvan M. Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. Baum L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16730-16737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Splenocytes were isolated and activated with immobilized anti-CD3 and IL-2/IL-4 as described under “Materials and Methods.” The binding of PNA-FITC to CD8+ T cells was analyzed after 24, 48, and 72 h of cell activation by flow cytometry. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, resting CD8+ T cells showed low levels of PNA binding (PNAlow) in the three time points analyzed (Fig. 2, broken lines). After 24 h of activation there was an increase in PNA binding (PNAhigh) in the entire population of CD8+ T cells, which became more pronounced at 72 h (Fig. 2, solid lines). Unless otherwise indicated, all subsequent experiments were performed on cells activated under these conditions for 72 h. CD45 Is the Major Glycoprotein Carrier of PNA Receptors— Several groups have investigated PNA receptors on thymocytes using two different but related approaches. One is direct staining of blots using PNA (7Priatel J.J. Chui D. Hiraoka N. Simmons C.J. Richardson K.B. Page D.M. Fukuda M. Varki N.M. Marth J.D.

Immunol. 1984; 86: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These two approaches yield somewhat different results with respect to the relative contribution of CD8 as a major carrier of PNA receptors. To determine the optimal conditions for evaluating PNA receptors on peripheral CD8+ T cells, the two basic approaches were compared directly as shown in Fig. 3. We carried out PNA-agarose precipitation from lysates of both biotinylated and nonbiotinylated thymocytes, and we performed Western blot analysis using either streptavidin-HRP to detect the biotinylated proteins or PNA-HRP to directly stain PNA receptors. All bands were precipitated through specific interaction with PNA because no bands were observed in control precipitations in the presence of lactose (not shown) or when lactose was present during blotting with PNA (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6). As shown in Fig. 3, when the blot was probed with streptavidin-HRP, multiple protein bands were detected in the biotinylated sample, with CD8a and CD8b being the predominant bands (lane 2). However, when the blot was probed with PNA-HRP, the CD8 bands became minor, and the rest of the bands had similar intensity (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). Some PNA-reactive proteins migrated at a higher position in lane 4 (Fig. 3) due to the biotin attachment that increases the molecular mass. The reason that CD8 was detected very intensely on the streptavidin-HRP blot is likely because both CD8a and CD8b have a very high lysine content, with more than 10% lysine residues in their protein sequences. Based on these results we concluded that direct staining with PNA was the preferred method for assessing the relative level of PNA receptors on CD8+ T cell glycoproteins. To determine whether the same proteins carried PNA receptors on activated peripheral CD8+ T cells, we conducted PNA-agarose precipitation of fresh and activated splenic CD8+ T cells followed by PNA-HRP blot. As shown in Fig. 4A, no PNA-specific bands were detected in resting CD8+ T cells. The single band seen at 30 kDa is nonspecific because it was not competed away in the presence of lactose (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, activated cells contained two PNA-reactive bands, a major band of 200 kDa and a minor band of 65 kDa (Fig. 4A, lane 2). The molecular mass of the top band suggested that it was CD45, a major T cell surface glycoprotein. To test this, immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with an anti-CD45 antibody was performed followed by a PNA-HRP blot. The results shown in Fig. 4A, lane 5, indicate that this band is indeed CD45 and that this glycoprotein is the major carrier of PNA-binding sites in activated CD8+ T cells. In order to investigate whether there are other minor components containing PNA-binding sites, we carried out PNA precipitation of biotinylated cell lysates followed by streptavidin-HRP blot (Fig. 4B). Our results clearly indicated that a few proteins are PNA-reactive in the resting CD8+ T cells, and their intensity increased upon activation. By immunoprecipitation, we identified three of the proteins to be CD45, CD8a, and CD8b (data not shown, arrows in Fig. 4B indicate the positions). Although there are few other proteins containing PNA-binding sites, CD45 shows the most dramatic increase following cell activation. Glycolipids Contribute to but Are Not Required for the PNAhigh Phenotype—The preferred disaccharide ligand of PNA (Galβ1–3GalNAc) is found both in O-glycans of glycoproteins and in glycolipids of the ganglio-series. Two glycolipids in particular, GM1 (Galβ1–3GalNAcβ1–4[NeuAcα2–3]Galβ1–4Glcceramide) and asialo-GM1 (Galβ1–3GalNAcβ1–4Galβ1–4Glcceramide), are expressed on T cells (29Zhao J. Furukawa K. Fukumoto S. Okada M. Furugen R. Miyazaki H. Takamiya K. Aizawa S. Shiku H. Matsuyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13744-13747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30Slifka M.K. Pagarigan R.R. Whitton J.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2009-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Thus, in principle, glycolipids could also account for binding of PNA to activated CD8+ T cells. Relative to the PNA receptor on glycoproteins, the major difference in the ganglioside structure is that the Galβ1–3GalNAc sequence is in β-linkage to a sugar instead of in α-linkage to threonine. In order to determine whether PNA binds to GM1 and asialo-GM1, the gangliosides were chromatographed on HPTLC plates and stained with PNA (Fig. 5A). Whereas PNA bound to asialo-GM1, no binding was observed to GM1, most likely due to the presence of the internal sialic acid. Because PNA recognizes asialo-GM1, we next questioned whether or not the expression of asialo-GM1 changed upon activation of CD8+ T cells. The binding of anti-asialo-GM1 to CD8+ T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry after 24, 48, and 72 h of activation. As shown in Fig. 5B, after 24 h of activation there was an increase in the expression of asialo-GM1 of ∼50% of CD8+ T cells. The percentage of CD8+ T cells expressing asialo-GM1 increased after 48 and 72 h of activation; however, the difference in staining intensity between resting (Fig. 5B, broken lines) and activated cells (Fig. 5B, solid lines) was not as large as that observed with PNA (Fig. 2). Because asialo-GM1 can be recognized by PNA and its expression increases upon activation of CD8+ T cells, it is likely that asialo-GM1 is a PNA receptor in activated CD8+ T cells. In order to directly test the extent of contribution of asialo-GM1 to the increased expression of PNA-binding sites on activated CD8+ T cells, we compared the binding of PNA to CD8+ T cells isolated from wild type mice and a GM2/GD2–/– mouse strain. The GM2/GD2 synthase–/– mouse strain does not express complex gangliosides, including asialo-GM1, because it is missing a key GalNAc transferase required for their biosynthesis (22Liu Y. Hoffmann A. Grinberg A. Westphal H. McDonald M.P. Miller K.M. Crawley J.N. Sandhoff K. Suzuki K. Proia R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8138-8143Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our results showed that despite the absence of asialo-GM1, binding of PNA to activated CD8+ T cells from these mice was not significantly different from that observed with cells from wild type mice (Fig. 5C). Therefore, changes in the expression of the ganglioside asialo-GM1 cannot account per se for the conversion to the PNAhigh phenotype upon activation of CD8+ T cells. It is clear that asialo-GM1 can be detected by PNA, and the expression of asialo-GM1 increased in the activated CD8+ T cells, but the total contribution of asialo-GM1 to PNA binding is small. Taken together with the results from Fig. 4, these data suggest that CD45 is the main PNA receptor in activated CD8+ T cells.

Our previous studies have shown that certain apoptotic signals can inactivate Rb via the p38 pathway. Here we show that Rb associates with the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase ASK1 in response to specific apoptotic signals. An LXCXE motif on ASK1 was required for Rb binding; this correlated with increased E2F1 transcriptional activity and up-regulation of the proapoptotic protein p73. Overexpression of Rb inhibited ASK1-induced apoptosis; in addition, an ASK1 mutant incapable of binding Rb could not induce apoptosis, indicating that ASK1 has to overcome the antiapoptotic properties of Rb to kill cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that in asynchronous cells the p73P1 promoter is occupied predominantly by E2F3; upon tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α stimulation, E2F3 is dissociated from the promoter and replaced by E2F1. At the same time, TNF-α stimulation causes Rb to dissociate from the p73P1 promoter. These are promoter-specific events because Rb binds to the mitogenic cdc25A promoter upon TNF-α stimulation. These studies suggest that Rb acts as a link between apoptotic and proliferative pathways by interacting with distinct kinases and occupying different promoters.

Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Rb exerts its growth-suppressive function mainly by inhibiting the activity of the E2F family of transcription factors; inactivation of Rb disrupts its interaction with E2F, enhancing E2F-mediated transcription (2Chellappan S.P.

Although Rb inactivation during normal cell cycle progression leads to E2F activation and S phase entry, in certain cases this process triggers apoptosis by the p53 or p73 pathway (5Irwin M.

Rb has antiapoptotic properties and can abrogate apoptosis induced by overexpression of E2F1, transforming growth factor-β, interferon-γ, for example (8Harbour W.J. Dean D.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E65-E67Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Rb-null mouse embryos exhibit increased apoptosis in the liver, central and peripheral nervous system, lens, and skeletal muscle, mainly because of increased E2F1 activity (9Chau B.N. Wang J.Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a MAP kinase kinase kinase that mediates signaling initiated by death stimuli such as TNF-α, Fas activation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage (10Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2027) Google Scholar, 11Takeda K. Matsuzawa A. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Cell Struct. Funct. 2003; 28: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Consistent with its role in apoptotic signaling, dominant negative mutants of ASK1 are resistant to TNF-α and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (12Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Minowa O. Miyazono K. Noda T. Ichijo H. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). ASK1 function is modulated by a host of protein-protein interactions and is crucial to both survival and apoptotic processes. ASK1 binds many proapoptotic proteins such as TRAF-2, DAXX, and ALG-2, to facilitate TNF-α- and Fas-mediated cell death (13Matsuzawa A. Ichijo H. J. Biochem. 2001; 130: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Conversely, proteins such as Hsp72, thioredoxin, and 14-3-3 are negative regulators of ASK1 which promote cell survival (11Takeda K. Matsuzawa A. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Cell Struct. Funct. 2003; 28: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 14Ichijo H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6087-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 15Zhang L. Chen J. Fu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8511-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Recently, Chen et al. (16Chen J. Fujii K. Zhang L. Roberts T. Fu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7783-7788Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) reported an interaction between ASK1 and the kinase Raf-1; this inhibited the apoptotic activity of ASK1, independent of the MEK-ERK pathway. Although Rb protein is a negative regulator of both cell proliferation and apoptosis, the mechanisms of Rb inactivation upon apoptosis are not yet fully elucidated. Studies in our laboratory suggest that apoptotic signals such as TNF-α and Fas induce Rb inactivation through the p38 kinase pathway (17Wang S. Nath N. Minden A. Chellappan S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1559-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 18Nath N. Wang S. Betts V. Knudsen E. Chellappan S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5986-5994Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), independent of cyclins and cdks, whereas a direct interaction of Rb with Raf-1 occurred upon mitogenic signaling (19Wang S. Ghosh R. Chellappan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7487-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Here we describe a physical and functional interaction between ASK1 and the Rb protein in response to apoptotic stimuli. It appears that ASK1 has to overcome Rb function to induce apoptosis; further, ASK1-mediated inactivation of Rb correlates with increased levels of the proapoptotic protein p73. TNF-α stimulation leads to increased binding of ASK1 to Rb and elevates E2F1 binding to the p73P1 promoter. At the same time, Rb protein dissociates from the p73P1 promoter and associates with mitogenic promoters such as cdc25A. Our data suggest that Rb acts as a common link between apoptotic and proliferative pathways, and differential association of Rb and E2Fs with specific promoters facilitates proliferation and apoptosis. Cell Culture and Transfection—Ramos and Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI (Mediatech Cellgro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Mediatech Cellgro). NIH 3T3 and Saos-2 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech Cellgro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Human aortic endothelial cells were obtained from Clonetics and cultured in endothelial growth medium, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) using 2 μg of each plasmid according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids—The pcDNA3HA-ASK1WT and the dominant negative mutant ASK1 were kind gifts of Dr. H. Ichijo, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan. Expression vectors for Rb, E2F, Raf-1, and E1A have been described previously (19Wang S. Ghosh R. Chellappan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7487-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The LXCXE mutant of ASK1 was subcloned into pCDNA3 after overlapping extension PCR using the ASK1 construct above as template and the following primers: primer 1, 5′-GTGGTGTTCTCAAGATCTCTGAC-3′; primer 2, 5′-GCTCTAGATCAAGTGTGTTTGTTTCG-3′; primer 3, 5′-TCTGGGTCAAAACATCGTACGATGAAT-3′; and primer 4, 5′-ATTCATCGTACGATGTTTTGACCCAGA-3′. The construct pGEX-2TK-ASK1NT contains the N-terminal region of ASK1 (amino acids 1-297). Briefly, wild type ASK1 was digested with BspMI, and the N-terminal region corresponding to amino acids 1-297 was PCR amplified and cloned into pGEX-2TK vector (Amersham Biosciences) between the BamHI and EcoRI sites, using the following primers: primer 1, 5′-GGATCCATCAGCACGGAGGC-3′ and primer 2, 5′-GGATCCTCAACCTGCGTAGACTAT-3′. GST-ASK1NT beads used in GST pull-down experiments were prepared as described in Ref. 19Wang S. Ghosh R. Chellappan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7487-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar. In Vitro Binding Assays—Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion of Rb has been described previously (19Wang S. Ghosh R. Chellappan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7487-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled Raf, ASK1, E2F1, ASK1NT, and E1A were generated by in vitro transcription translation according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). The competition assays involving E1A were done by performing the binding reaction between GST-Rb and 35S-ASK1 in the presence of 5, 10, and 20 μl of 35S-E1A. For the Raf-1 competition assay GST-Rb beads were incubated with 35S-ASK1 in the presence of 10 μl of 35S-Raf-1(wt) or 10 and 20 μl 35S-Raf-1Δ28. Competition assays designed to determine whether 35S-ASK1 could compete out the binding of GST-Rb to 35SE2F1 were performed like the Raf-1 competition assays using 10 μl of 35S-ASK1. The binding of 35S-labeled proteins to GST-Rb was performed at 4 °C, as described previously (19Wang S. Ghosh R. Chellappan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7487-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The protein amounts in the input lanes were approximately one-fourth of that used in the binding assay. Lysate Preparation, Immunoprecipitation (IP), and Western Blotting—Asynchronous cells were treated with 100 ng/ml TNF-α (Promega) or 50 ng/ml Fas antibody (clone CH-11, MBL, Japan) or 5 mm H2O2 (in the presence of 25 mm aminotriazole) for the indicated time points. For experiments involving N-acetylcysteine (NAC), the cells were treated with the aforesaid concentrations of TNF-α or H2O2 in the presence or absence of 1 mm NAC for 1 h. Drug treatment experiments were performed by treating Ramos cells with 15 μm camptothecin or 30 nm 5-fluorouracil or 15 nm paclitaxel (Taxol) or 15 nm tamoxifen for 4 h. Lysates from cells treated with different agents were prepared by Nonidet P-40 lysis as described earlier (19Wang S. Ghosh R. Chellappan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7487-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Physical interaction between proteins in vivo was analyzed by IP-Western blotting using 200 μg of lysate with 1 μg of the appropriate antibody as described previously (19Wang S. Ghosh R. Chellappan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7487-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The amount of protein in the lysate lane was half the amount used for the IP. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Ramos cells were transfected with ASK1WT or ASK1 LXCXE mutant or ASK1DN. IPs were carried out using 100 μg of transfected lysate and 0.5 μg of ASK1 polyclonal antibody and c-Myc antibody as the control. The kinase reaction was carried out on the beads in a total volume of 10 μl containing 1 μg of Rb protein, 10 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (28Nath N. Bian H. Reed E.F. Chellappan S.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5351-5358PubMed Google Scholar). Kinase assays using 1 μg of myelin basic protein as the substrate were done as detailed in Ref. 10Ichijo H. Nishida E.

Double Immunofluorescence Assay—NIH-3T3 fibroblastic cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-treated chamber slides and treated with 100 ng/ml TNF-α for 1 h. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100. Monoclonal anti-Rb antibody (1:50) and polyclonal ASK1 antibody (1:200) were added, and the cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes), goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 546 were added as described previously (29Fusaro G. Dasgupta P. Rastogi S. Joshi B. Chellappan S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47853-47861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Nuclear staining was performed using Hoechst 33258. Immunostained Rb and ASK1 were visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY), and areas of colocalization were determined using LSM 510 software (Zeiss). Apoptosis Assay—Eight-well chamber slides of NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with 2 μg of empty vector, ASK1, Rb and their mutants as indicated, in the presence of β-galactosidase, using LipofectAMINE 2000, according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, the cells were treated with 25 ng/ml TNF-α for 18 h, fixed, and stained for 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. Surviving cells were counted using a phase-contrast microscope in three different 20× fields in a blind fashion (30Cook J.L. Walker T.A. Worthen G.S. Radke J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9966-9971Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The apoptosis assay was also performed in Ramos cells using 5 × 105 cells/transfection. Each transfection was done in duplicate, and the whole experiment was repeated twice. In parallel experiments using 10-cm dishes of 3T3 cells or 1 × 106 Ramos cells/transfection, apoptotic cell death was also assessed by Western blot analysis of PARP cleavage, using polyclonal antibody against PARP (Cell Signaling Technology). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—Asynchronous Ramos cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml TNF-α for 1, 2, and 4 h, respectively. 25 × 106 cells were used for each IP reaction. Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Subsequently the cells were harvested, and lysates were prepared. IPs were analyzed for the presence of Rb, E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 by PCR as described previously (31Wang S. Fusaro G. Padmanabhan J. Chellappan S.P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8388-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody was used as the control for all reactions. The sequences of the PCR primers used in the PCRs were as follows: p73P1 promoter (forward primer), 5′-GCCGGGAGGAGACCTTGG-3′; p73P1 promoter (reverse primer), 5′-GTTTCGCTGCGTCCCCTTCG-3′. The cdc25A and c-fos primers are detailed in Ref. 31Wang S. Fusaro G. Padmanabhan J. Chellappan S.P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8388-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar. ASK1 Binds to Rb through an LXCXE Motif—A preliminary examination of the ASK1 protein sequence showed that it contains an LXCXE motif spanning amino acids 916-920 (LKCFE), which is present in many Rb-binding proteins. Fig. 1A shows that ASK1 can bind efficiently to GST-Rb as well as GST-Raf-1 (which was the positive control), but not to unprimed GST beads. ASK1 could also bind to p107 and p130 (Fig. 1B). However, ASK1 could not bind to mutant GST-Rb in which exon 21 was deleted, producing mutations in the pocket domain, showing that the pocket domain of Rb was necessary for the binding. The role of the LXCXE motif of ASK1 in binding to Rb was next examined. A mutant of ASK1 in which the LXCXE site was altered by conservative amino acid changes could not bind to GST-Rb, whereas wild type ASK1 could (Fig. 1C). This result was verified by a transient transfection experiment. The Rb-deficient cell line Saos-2 was transfected with HA-tagged wild type or LXCXE mutant ASK1 along with Rb. IP-Western blot analysis shows a robust association of Rb with wild type ASK1 (Fig. 1D); in contrast, no Rb was bound to the LXCXE mutant. This result confirms that the LXCXE domain of ASK1 is necessary for binding to Rb. E1A and Raf-1 Inhibit the Binding of ASK1 to Rb—Because ASK1 was found to bind to Rb through its LXCXE motif, we examined whether adenovirus E1A, which has an LXCXE motif, could affect this interaction. A GST pull-down assay was done in which the binding of GST-Rb to 35S-ASK1 was competed with 5, 10, or 20 μl of 35S-E1A. It was found that 10 μl of E1A lysate could reduce the binding of ASK1 to Rb, and 20 μl could totally abolish the binding (Fig. 1E); this result further demonstrates the role of the LXCXE motif of ASK1 in Rb binding. The in vitro competition experiment was confirmed by a transient transfection experiment. Saos-2 cells were transfected with ASK1 and Rb in the presence or absence of E1A; IP-Western blot experiments showed that E1A could compete the binding of ASK1 to Rb in vivo as well (Fig. 1F). Our earlier studies had shown that Raf-1 binds to Rb upon mitogenic signaling (19Wang S. Ghosh R. Chellappan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7487-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); hence we examined whether Raf-1 affects the binding of ASK1 to Rb. The binding of 35S-ASK1 to GST-Rb was competed with 10 μl of 35S-Raf-1 synthesized in vitro. As shown in Fig. 1G, Raf-1 could compete the binding of ASK1 to Rb. Further, a Raf-1 mutant that could not bind to Rb (Raf-1Δ28) could also compete the binding of ASK-1 to Rb. To examine whether this was because of the ability of Raf-1Δ28 to bind GST-ASK1, a GST pull-down experiment was conducted. Studies by Chen et al. (16Chen J. Fujii K. Zhang L. Roberts T. Fu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7783-7788Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) have shown that the N-terminal region of ASK1 mediates ASK1-Raf-1 interaction. A GSTASK1NT construct that had the N-terminal 297 amino acids of ASK-1 fused to GST was generated. GST-pull down experiments showed that both Raf-1 and Raf-1Δ28 could bind efficiently to GST-ASK1NT (Fig. 1H), whereas only ASK1WT could bind Rb. The ability of Raf-1 to compete the binding of ASK1 to Rb was confirmed by IP-Western blots on transiently transfected Saos-2 cells (Fig. 1I); these results suggest that E1A and Raf-1 could compete with ASK1 for Rb in vitro and in vivo. ASK1 Associates with Rb during Specific Apoptotic Stimuli—We next examined whether ASK1 associates with Rb in vivo and whether such interaction is induced by apoptotic stimuli. Previous studies have shown that apoptotic stress signals such as TNF-α cause activation of ASK1. Ramos B cells were stimulated with TNF-α for different periods and the ASK1-Rb interaction was examined by IP-Western blot analysis. Fig. 2A shows that asynchronous Ramos cells contained very little ASK1·Rb complexes. The onset of TNF-α stimulation causes the association of ASK-1 and Rb within 30 min and lasts until about 1 h after stimulation. The levels of ASK1 and Rb in the cell lysates remained unchanged. We next ascertained whether the ASK1-Rb interaction was a conserved signaling phenomenon induced by other apoptotic stimuli as well. To examine this, Ramos B cells, Jurkat T cells, human aortic endothelial cells, or murine 3T3 fibroblasts were stimulated with TNF-α or Fas antibody or subjected to oxidative stress using H2O2, and the ASK1-Rb interaction was assessed by IP-Western blot experiments. As shown in Fig. 2B, three human cell lines treated with TNF-α or H2O2 induced an association between ASK1 and Rb. The ASK1-Rb interaction was also observed in mouse 3T3 cells stimulated with TNF-α. In most cases the association was transient, whereas its kinetics varied in a cell line-specific manner. ASK1 is normally maintained in an inactive form by its association with thioredoxin (13Matsuzawa A. Ichijo H. J. Biochem. 2001; 130: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 20Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress causes activation of ASK1. Because the ASK1-Rb interaction was absent in asynchronous cells but induced by apoptotic stimuli, we next examined whether ASK1 has to be activated for binding to Rb. Human aortic endothelial cells were stimulated with TNF-α or H2O2 in the presence or absence of the antioxidant NAC (21Liu H. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2198-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). IP-Western blot analysis of the extracts showed that although ASK1 associates with Rb upon TNF-α and H2O2 stimulation, NAC could effectively inhibit this association, suggesting that activation of ASK1 is essential for its binding to Rb. Next we examined whether proapoptotic anticancer drugs could induce ASK1-Rb interaction (22Wang T.H. Wang H.S. Ichijo H. Giannakakou P. Foster J.S. Fojo T. Wimalasena J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4928-4936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Toward this purpose, Ramos cells were treated with camptothecin, 5-fluorouracil, tamoxifen, and paclitaxel at concentrations known to kill cells. IP-Western blot analysis showed that ASK1 did not bind to Rb under these circumstances (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that the ASK1-Rb interaction is induced only by specific apoptotic stimuli. ASK1 and Raf-1 Bind to Rb in Response to Different Signals—We had found earlier that Raf-1 could bind and inactivate Rb in response to mitogenic signals (19Wang S. Ghosh R. Chellappan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7487-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); we now find that ASK1 binds to Rb in response to apoptotic signals. Because both are MAP kinase kinase kinases we examined whether apoptotic and proliferative signals cause a differential binding of the two kinases to Rb. Lysates were prepared from serum-stimulated or TNF-α treated Ramos cells, and the association of ASK1 or Raf-1 with Rb was examined by IP-Western blot analysis. Serum-stimulated Ramos cells showed a robust association of Raf-1 with Rb (Fig. 2E, top panel), but there was only a little Raf-1 associated with Rb when the cells were stimulated with TNF-α. In contrast, no ASK1 was detected in the Rb immunoprecipitates of serum-stimulated cells. Conversely, when Ramos cells were stimulated by TNF-α for 1 h, a strong ASK1-Rb association was observed (Fig. 2E, second panel from top). This experiment shows a distinct dichotomy in the MAP kinase kinase kinases associating with Rb in response to apoptotic and mitogenic signaling; ASK1 in the case of apoptosis and Raf-1 during proliferation. ASK1 Colocalizes with Rb in the Nucleus upon Apoptotic Stimulation—The subcellular localization of the ASK1-Rb interaction was examined next because ASK1 is predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas Rb is nuclear. A double immunofluorescence experiment on asynchronous 3T3 cells showed that ASK1 was present predominantly in the cytoplasm, whereas Rb was nuclear (Fig. 3A). TNF-α stimulation for 1 h resulted in the translocation of a subset of ASK1 molecules to the nucleus. ASK1 was found to colocalize with Rb in the nucleus in discrete foci. A nuclear function has been proposed for ASK1 previously, where it interacts with proteins such as ALG-2 (23Hwang I.S. Jung Y.S. Kim E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). ASK1 Can Reverse Rb-mediated Repression of E2F1 Transcriptional Activity—We had found that Raf-1 could reverse Rb-mediated repression of E2F1 activity (19Wang S. Ghosh R. Chellappan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7487-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Given this background, it seemed probable that ASK1 affects Rb-mediated transcriptional repression of E2F1 as well. Transient transfection of E2CAT reporter and E2F1 into Saos-2 cells showed robust transcriptional activity, which was repressed by Rb (Fig. 3B). Cotransfection of ASK1 could reverse Rb-mediated repression, suggesting that ASK1 is capable of functionally inactivating Rb, similar to the reversal brought about by Raf-1. On the other hand, a dominant negative ASK1 construct could not affect Rb-mediated repression of E2F1 activity. ASK1 by itself had no direct effect on E2F1-mediated transcription (data not shown). We next assessed whether the binding of ASK1 to Rb released E2F1. GST pull-down assays were performed to examine whether ASK1 could directly compete the binding of E2F1 to Rb. The presence of excess 35S-labeled ASK1 did not disrupt the binding of E2F1 to GST-Rb, as shown in Fig. 3C. These data suggest that ASK1 does not displace E2F1 from Rb directly, unlike viral oncoproteins such as E1A. The effect of ASK1 on the E2F1-Rb interaction in vivo was examined by transient transfection experiments. The Rb-negative cell line Saos-2 was transfected with Rb in the presence of ASK1, E2F1, or both, and the association of E2F1 with Rb was assessed by IP-Western blot analysis 72 h after transfection. As can be seen in Fig. 3D, the presence of ASK1 reduced the amount of E2F1 bound to Rb. This suggests that ASK1 binds to Rb, probably leading to its functional inactivation, resulting in the eventual release of E2F1. ASK1 Can Phosphorylate Rb in Vitro—Attempts were made to assess how ASK1 affects Rb function. Because Rb function is regulated by phosphorylation, we examined whether ASK1 could phosphorylate Rb. To determine this, Ramos cells were transiently transfected with ASK1WT, ASK1DN, or ASK1 LX- CXE mutant constructs. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with an ASK1 antibody and tested for their ability to phosphorylate GST-Rb in vitro. The immunoprecipitated ASK1WT could phosphorylate GST-Rb quite efficiently, whereas the dominant negative mutant and the LXCXE mutant of ASK1 could not (Fig. 3E). However, both ASK1WT and ASK1 LXCXE mutant could efficiently phosphorylate myelin basic protein (Fig. 3D), another substrate for ASK1 (10Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2027) Google Scholar). It thus appears that ASK1 is capable of phosphorylating Rb in vitro, and this requires a physical interaction between the two proteins. Rb Can Abrogate ASK1-induced Apoptotic Activity—Because ASK1 bound to Rb only upon apoptotic stimulation, we examined whether Rb had any effect on the apoptotic functions of ASK1. To determine this, Ramos and 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with ASK1WT, DN, and LXCXE mutant constructs with or without Rb; a β-galactosidase expression vector was used as a marker. The transfected cells were stimulated with a low dose of TNF-α (25 ng/ml) for 18 h, and apoptotic cell death was monitored by morphological analysis. As seen in Fig. 4A, Ramos as well as 3T3 cells transfected with wild type ASK1 showed a significant amount of apoptosis. However, cotransfection of Rb drastically reduced the number of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, a pocket domain mutant of Rb that could not bind to ASK1 was unable to inhibit ASK1-induced apoptosis. ASK1DN mutant did not exhibit any apoptotic activity, as expected. Interestingly, the ASK1 LXCXE mutant that is incapable of binding to Rb did not exhibit any apoptotic activity. The magnitude of cell death in the above experiment was also assessed by PARP cleavage (Fig. 4B and 4C, top lane) in transfected Ramos and 3T3 lysates. As seen in Fig. 4, B and C, there is a significant amount of PARP cleavage in cells transfected with ASK1WT but not the LXCXE mutant. Cotransfection of Rb decreased PARP cleavage in both cases. Taken together, these results suggest that the antiapoptotic activity of Rb has to be overcome by ASK1 to induce apoptosis, and this inactivation may be crucial for TNF-α-induced apoptosis. ASK1 Enhances p73 Levels in Cells—To understand how ASK1 binding to Rb facilitates cell death, attempts were made to see whether any proapoptotic genes regulated by E2F1 are induced by ASK1. It has been shown that the p53-related p73 is a transcriptional target of E2F1, hence we examined p73 levels in the lysates from transiently transfected cells used in Fig. 4A. As shown in Fig. 4B, p73 levels are elevated only in Ramos cells transfected with wild type ASK1, correlating with apoptosis; cotransfection of Rb repressed this induction. Further, ASK1 LXCXE mutant and ASK1-DN did not induce p73. Thus, induction of apoptosis by ASK1 seemed to utilize p73. In transfected 3T3 lysates similar results were obtained (Fig. 4C). The transfection of wild type ASK1 into 3T3 cells led to a robust elevation of p73 levels, which coincided with the induction of apoptosis in these cells. Cotransfection of Rb with ASK1 did not induce p73 levels. As seen in Ramos cells, 3T3 cells transfected with ASK1 LXCXE mutant or ASK1DN did cause up-regulation of p73 levels. From these results, it appears that activation of ASK1 or elevating its levels inactivates Rb, allowing the expression of the E2F1-regulated p73 gene. TNF-α Regulates the Binding of E2F1 to the p73P1 Promoter—To examine whether p73 is induced upon TNF-α treatment in human cells, we examined p73 levels in Ramos cells stimulated with 100 ng/ml TNF-α or 50 ng/ml Fas antibody. A Western blot analysis showed that levels of p73 are enhanced in cells stimulated with TNF-α and Fas (Fig. 5A), suggesting that p73 might contribute to the apoptotic process. Because E2F1 can induce the transcriptional activity of p73P1 promoter (6Lissy N.A. Davis P.K. Irwin M. Kaelin W.G. Dowdy S.F. Nature. 2000; 407: 624-645Crossref Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 7Pediconi N. Ianari A. Costanzo A. Belloni L. Gallo R. Cimino L. Porcelli A. Screpanti I. Balsano C. Alesse A. Gulino A. Levrero M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), ChIP assays were done to assess whether different E2F family members bind differentially to the p73P1 promoter in asynchronous Ramos cells. After isolation of DNA, PCR was performed to amplify 230 bp of the p73P1 promoter. As shown in Fig. 5B, E2F3 was found to be associated with the p73P1 promoter, but not E2F1 nor E2F2. A PCR for a control c-fos promoter did not amplify any DNA, showing the specificity of the IP as well as the PCR (Fig. 5B, lower panel). The PCR conditions that were used amplified the DNA in a linear, dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). The differential binding of E2F family members to the p73P1 promoter upon TNF-α treatment was examined next. TNF-α-treated Ramos lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies for E2F1, E2F3, Rb, or an irrelevant antibody as the negative control. As shown in Fig. 5D (top panel), asynchronous cells contained predominantly E2F3 bound to the p73P1 promoter. A substantial amount of Rb was also bound to the p73P1 promoter in asynchronous cells. This correlates with the biochemical data (Fig. 3A) showing that asynchronous cells have little ASK1-Rb interaction, when the p73P1 promoter is transcriptionally inactive. In addition, although no E2F1 was bound to the p73P1 promoter in asynchronous Ramos cells, TNF-α stimulation induced a marked increase in E2F1 binding to the p73P1 promoter. This was accompanied by a concomitant decrease in the levels of Rb and E2F3 bound to the p73P1 promoter (Fig. 5D, top panel). This correlates with the binding of ASK1 to Rb in the cells; it is likely that the ASK1-mediated inactivation of Rb leads to its dissociation from E2F1 and the p73P1 promoter. The activation of the proapoptotic p73P1 promoter in response to TNF-α stimulation thus correlates with the association of ASK1 to Rb and derepression of E2F1. We examined whether the changes in binding of E2F family members to p73P1 promoter was specific or occurred on all E2F-responsive promoters. Toward this purpose, occupancy of the mitogenic cdc25A promoter by E2Fs 1 and 3 was examined (Fig. 5D, middle panel). It was found that E2F1, E2F3, and Rb were bound to cdc25A promoter in asynchronous cells, but the levels of E2F1 decreased upon TNF-α stimulation. At the same time, the binding of Rb to this promoter was increased. It is likely that Rb is suppressing this promoter because the cell is receiving an apoptotic, but not mitotic stimulus. E2F3 binding did not change considerably during this time. No binding was observed in the non-E2F-regulated c-fos promoter, which was used as a control for the ChIP assays (Fig. 5D, bottom panel). These results suggest that different E2F family members are recruited preferentially to specific promoters depending on whether the cells encounter an apoptotic or mitogenic stimulus. Apoptotic cell death is a default program of metazoan cells in times of stress which must be constantly suppressed by prosurvival mechanisms (13Matsuzawa A. Ichijo H. J. Biochem. 2001; 130: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence show that the inhibition of ASK1 activity by antiapoptotic proteins such as Raf-1 may provide a general mechanism of cell survival (11Takeda K. Matsuzawa A. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Cell Struct. Funct. 2003; 28: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that suppression of apoptosis may be the primary function of Rb, independent of its antiproliferative activity (9Chau B.N. Wang J.Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The present study shows that Rb can physically interact with ASK1, and overexpression of Rb inhibits its apoptotic activity. Further, ASK1 has to overcome the antiapoptotic functions of Rb to induce apoptosis. The overexpression of ASK1 can been shown to cause apoptosis in certain cell lines such as 293 and HeLa, which contain viral oncoproteins, capable of inactivating Rb. It is tempting to speculate that probably the inactivation of Rb facilitates the apoptotic process. However, no direct experimental data have been reported correlating the presence of these viral proteins in cells with ASK1-induced apoptosis. Data from Cook et al. (30Cook J.L. Walker T.A. Worthen G.S. Radke J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9966-9971Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) show that the Rb binding region of the viral oncoprotein E1A is essential for its ability to sensitize mammalian cells to TNF-α induced apoptosis via the p38 pathway (25Liao Y. Hung M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6836-6848Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). E1A mutants lacking the Rb binding domain were unable to sensitize cells to apoptosis. It is probable that the binding of E1A inactivates Rb, an end point achieved by ASK1 and p38 kinases. It remains to be seen whether an ASK1 LXCXE mutant has any apoptotic effects on Rb-null cell lines. Data from our laboratory have shown that p38 kinase can phosphorylate and inactivate Rb in response to TNF-α and Fas stimulation. However, unlike ASK1, p38 kinase does not bind directly to Rb. Because p38 kinase is one of the downstream targets of ASK1 (13Matsuzawa A. Ichijo H. J. Biochem. 2001; 130: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) (26Takeda K. Matsuzawa A. Nishitoh H.

EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), it may be possible that p38 might contribute to ASK1-mediated inactivation of Rb in vivo (22Wang T.H. Wang H.S. Ichijo H. Giannakakou P. Foster J.S. Fojo T. Wimalasena J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4928-4936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Although caspases inactivate Rb at later points of TNF-α-mediated apoptosis (27Chen W. Otterson G.A. Lipkowitz S. Khleif S.N. Coxon A.B. Kaye F.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1243-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we believe that the inactivation of Rb by ASK1 precedes that event. Several convergent lines of evidence show that the Rb protein can regulate both proliferative and apoptotic pathways in cells, depending on the extracellular stimuli. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying this dual role of Rb are yet to be fully understood. Experimental evidence seems to suggest that the Rb function in cells is regulated by a host of protein-protein interactions (24Morris E.J. Dyson N.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 82: 1-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). It is probable that during mitogenic scenarios, Rb binds to prosurvival kinases such as Raf-1 and cyclins/cdks to promote proliferation, whereas apoptotic stimuli cause Rb to bind to apoptotic kinases such as ASK1. Although both of the interactions inactivate Rb and enhance E2F1 transcriptional activity, they induce different promoters: proapoptotic promoters such as p73P1 or mitogenic promoters such as cdc25A. We find that the p73P1 promoter is occupied by E2F3 and Rb in asynchronous cells, when p73P1 levels are low; but apoptotic signaling dissociates Rb, replaces E2F3 with E2F1, and results in the expression of this gene. At the same time, Rb associates with mitogenic promoters like cdc25A, leading to its suppression. Although further studies are needed to understand how Rb and E2F1 associate with different promoters upon apoptotic or mitogenic signaling, it appears possible that the differential binding of signaling kinases such as ASK-1 or Raf-1 to Rb contributes to this process. Rb appears to be uniquely poised to regulate both mitogenic and apoptotic phenomena for two reasons: its ability to interact with both apoptotic and mitogenic signaling kinases, and the fact that it can regulate the expression of prosurvival and proapoptotic genes via E2F family members. Differential regulation of Rb by two kinases of the MAP kinase kinase kinase family, ASK1 and Raf-1, might contribute to the appropriate cellular response to various physiological conditions. Further studies into Rb-mediated regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis will help us understand how cells respond differentially to apoptotic and proliferative signals. We are thankful to Dr. H. Ichijo for the generous gifts of ASK1 constructs, and we appreciate the support of the Molecular Biology and Analytical Microscopy Core Facilities at Moffitt Cancer Center."

A critical component of this pathway is 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1), a PH domain-containing enzyme that catalyzes the activating phosphorylation for many AGC kinases, including Akt and protein kinase C isozymes. We used a directed proteomics-based approach to identify the adaptor protein Grb14, which binds the insulin receptor through an SH2 domain, as a novel PDK-1 binding partner. Interaction of these two proteins is constitutive and mediated by a PDK-1 binding motif on Grb14. Disruption of this motif by point mutation or deletion of the Grb14 SH2 domain prevents the insulin-triggered membrane translocation of PDK-1. The interaction of PDK-1 with Grb14 facilitates Akt function: disruption of the interaction by overexpression of a construct of Grb14 mutated in the PDK-1 binding motif significantly decreases insulin-dependent activation of Akt. Thus, Grb14 serves as an adaptor protein to recruit PDK-1 to activated insulin receptor, thus promoting Akt phosphorylation and transduction of the insulin signal.

Members of the AGC family of protein kinases require phosphorylation at a conserved threonine residue in a segment near the entrance to the enzyme active site, termed the activation loop, for maximal catalytic activity (1Taylor S.S.

Members of the PtdIns 3-kinase family of enzymes phosphorylate inositol phospholipids at the D-3 position of the inositol ring to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns-3,4-P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns-3,4,5-P3). These lipids serve as membrane docking sites for many pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing proteins, mediating their recruitment to membranes following activation of PtdIns 3-kinase (16Franke T.F.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Akt is an immediate downstream target of PtdIns 3-kinase activation. It contains a PH domain that specifically binds 3-phosphoinositides, causing the translocation of Akt to membranes. Membrane binding results in phosphorylation by PDK-1 on the exposed activation loop; this latter kinase also contains a PH domain that binds 3-phosphoinositides (2Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P.

Thus, Akt translocation triggers its phosphorylation and activation by PDK-1. PDK-1 contains a carboxyl-terminal PH domain that binds PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3in vitro with low nanomolar affinity, however, lipid binding has no significant effect on the intrinsic activity of the enzyme (19Currie R.A.

Whether PtdIns 3-kinase controls the spatial distribution of PDK-1 in cells is less clear. It is uniformly observed that PDK-1 is localized to the cytoplasm in quiescent cells, however, there are conflicting studies on whether activation of PtdIns 3-kinase causes membrane redistribution.

However, Currie et al. (19Currie R.A. Walker K.S. Gray A. Deak M. Casamayor A. Downes C.P. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Lucocq J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) reported no translocation of overexpressed PDK-1 in porcine aortic endothelial or 293 cells stimulated with PDGF or insulin-like growth factor-1. The authors noted that the amount of PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 in cells is much greater than the amount of PDK-1 within a cell, suggesting that other factors or proteins, which are limiting in cells overexpressing PDK-1, play a role in recruiting PDK-1 to membranes. Studies of endogenous PDK-1 have been limited by the availability of appropriate antibodies. Although activation of PtdIns 3-kinase plays an important role in Akt phosphorylation, other mechanisms controlling the phosphorylation of PDK-1 substrates have been identified. Substrates such as conventional protein kinase C isoforms are constitutively phosphorylated by PDK-1 in a reaction that is insensitive to PtdIns 3-kinase activity (22Sonnenburg E.D. Gao T. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45289-45297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The derivation of the name for PDK-1 arises from the phosphoinositide dependence of its first discovered substrate, Akt, whose phosphorylation requires PtdIns 3-kinase activation to present itself as a substrate to PDK-1 (23Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Cross D.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, PDK-1 directly docks to substrates such as protein kinase C and p70S6 kinase, whose phosphorylation is not dependent on phosphoinositides. This docking is conformationally controlled by the substrate. Other regulatory inputs into PDK-1 activity include tyrosine phosphorylation, which occurs on multiple sites in response to cellular stress and activation (24Prasad N. Topping R.S. Zhou D.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1327-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) reported that the amino-terminal region of PDK-1 binds and activates the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Ral GDS. Whether scaffold proteins regulate the function of PDK-1 by poising it at specific intracellular sites is largely unexplored. Grb14 is a multidomain protein that is a member of the Grb7 family of proteins, which also includes Grb7, Grb10, and the Caenorhabditis elegans protein Mig 10 (29Daly R.J. Sanderson G.M. Janes P.W.

Little is known about the function of Grb14; however, it has been reported to localize via an SH2 domain to many different receptor tyrosine kinases, including fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (30Reilly J.F.

Thus, most of the knowledge about Grb14 comes from studies detailing the receptor binding mediated through the SH2 and BPS domains (29Daly R.J. Sanderson G.M. Janes P.W. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol.

In the present study, we used a directed proteomics-based approach to identify the adaptor protein Grb14 as a novel PDK-1 interacting protein. Biochemical studies indicate that the Grb14-PDK-1 interaction is direct and mediated through a conserved motif within Grb14 similar to a previously described PDK-1 consensus binding sequence. Disruption of the PDK-1 binding motif or the SH2 domain in Grb14 blocks PDK-1 membrane translocation in response to insulin, but not PDGF. Phosphorylation of endogenous Akt, but not PKCα, is reduced in the presence of these Grb14 mutants, suggesting only PtdIns3-kinase-dependent substrates of PDK-1 are subject to regulation by Grb14. These data provide evidence for a novel mechanism to regulate PDK-1 localization. Reagents—Antibodies to the phosphorylated activation loop of Akt (Thr-308) and PDK-1 (Ser-241) were purchased from Cell Signaling. The polyclonal phosphospecific antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated activation loop of PKC isozymes (P500 based on the nomenclature of the βII isozyme, but referred to as P497 in this report, based on the phosphorylation site of PKCα) was generated as described previously (34Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). HA-tagged murine Akt α and 9E10 Myc-tagged human PDK-1 with a deleted PH domain (Myc-ΔPH-PDK-1) was a gift of Dr. Alex Toker (Harvard Medical School). Polyclonal antibodies to Grb14 were purchased from Chemicon and from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. PDGF was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, and insulin was purchased from Sigma. All other materials were of reagent grade. cDNA Constructs and Plasmids—Human PDK-1 was cloned into the pCMV5M vector containing an amino-terminal 9E10 Myc-epitope tag as described previously (35King C.C. Gardiner E.M.M. Zenke F.T. Bohl B.P. Newton A.C. Hemmings B.A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41201-41209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The cDNA for Grb14, a kind gift from Pam Maher (Scripps Research Institute), was cloned in pCDNA3 containing an amino-terminal Xpress tag. Grb14 E195A mutations were made by PCR amplification using a QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by sequencing to confirm mutations. The primers for Grb14 E195A were as follows: forward primer, 5′-GCCAAATATgcgTTCTTTAAAAACCC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGGTTTTTAAAGAAcgcATATTTGGC-3′. Lowercase base pairs represent the mutated amino acid. Grb14 1–342 truncations were generated by PCR with KpnI/HindIII sites and cloned into pCMV5-HA3 vector (a kind gift from Dr. Frank Zenke, Scripps Research Institute) and amplified. The primers for the truncated Grb14 construct were: forward primer, 5′-GGGGTACCATGACCACTTCCCTGCAAG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCCAAGCTTGGGTTACTGCATGCCATACTTAAGC-3′. All constructs were sequenced to confirm mutations and/or truncations. Cell Culture and Transfection—All cell lines used in these studies (HEK 293 and MCF-7) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific Inc.). HEK 293 cells (seeded at 0.2 × 106 cells/60-mm dish) were grown to 60–70% confluence and transfected (2 μg of total plasmid DNA and 10 μl of Superfect) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). 30 h post-transfection, cells were transferred to serum-free media for 18 h, then stimulated with insulin (100 nm). Cells were subsequently washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Lysis buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 150 IU/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 1% Triton X-100 was added to each plate, the cell lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and the detergent-soluble supernatants were collected. Cell Fractionation—For experiments involving separation of the cytosol and membrane fractions, HEK 293 cells were resuspended in lysis buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 300 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm vanadate, 40 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μm microcystin) and sonicated (Branson bath sonicator). Whole cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant (cytosol, C) was removed. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer B containing 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant containing solubilized membrane components (membrane, M) was removed (22Sonnenburg E.D. Gao T. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45289-45297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—An anti-HA antibody and anti-Xpress antibody were used to immunoprecipitate the HA- or Xpress-Grb14, respectively. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated in the presence of 100 μl of protein A/G-agarose and 1 μl of specific antibodies for 16 h at 4 °C. Agarose beads were washed three times with 300 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and twice with 300 μl of 0.5 m NaCl. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Grb14 (or PDK-1) was detected by Western blot analysis using Chemiluminescence. Chemiluminescence was quantified by with a charge-coupled device camera using a GeneGnome bio-imaging system (Syngene). Two-dimensional Electrophoresis/MALDI-TOF MS—HEK 293 cells transfected with Myc-PDK-1 were lysed in buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm, 10 min, to obtain the detergent-soluble fraction. Sample containing ∼500 μg of protein was incubated with Myc antibodies and protein A/G beads (Pierce) for 12 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in detergent-containing buffer (100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.3, 1% Triton X-100, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The beads were resuspended in 9 m urea/4% CHAPS containing 15 mg of dithiothreitol and 0.5% ampholytes (pI range 3–10; Bio-Rad) and passively absorbed onto immobilized pH gradient strips (pI range 3–10; Bio-Rad) for 12 h at 20 °C. Isoelectric focusing was performed for 35,000 V-h on a Protean IEF System (Bio-Rad), electrophoresis was carried out using the Criterion gel system (Bio-Rad), and the samples were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or Silver Quest (Invitrogen). Bands containing potentially novel PDK-1-interacting proteins were excised, washed three times in 50% acetonitrile/50% NH4HCO3, and lyophilized. Proteins were subjected to in-gel reduction with 10 mm dithiothreitol at 56 °C for 1 h and alkylation with 100 mm iodoacetic acid for 30 min at room temperature, followed by digestion with 0.5 μg of trypsin (Roche Applied Science). Isolated peptides were washed and concentrated in C18 ZipTips (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's protocol, mixed with α cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma), and spotted onto a platform. MALDI-TOF MS was performed on an Applied Biosystems DE STR mass spectrometer. Peptides were analyzed with the online data base at the University of California, San Francisco (available at prospector.ucsf.edu). To understand the role of scaffold proteins in regulating-PDK-1, we employed a proteomics-based approach to identify novel proteins that interact with the kinase. Myc-tagged PDK-1 was transiently overexpressed in HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney 293) cells and immunoprecipitated using the anti-Myc antibody from cell lysates. The immunoprecipitate was washed in detergent-containing buffer to remove unbound proteins, and bound proteins were separated by one- or two-dimensional electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Control experiments included preclearing nonspecific binding proteins by incubation with protein A/G beads alone, mock immunoprecipitations with IgG alone, and immunoprecipitation with Myc antibodies from untransfected cell lysates. Silver staining analysis of two-dimensional gels revealed at least 20 different proteins that appear to associate specifically with PDK-1 (Fig. 1); these included heat shock protein 27 (spot 2) and the known PDK-1-binding protein, protein kinase C α (spot 3). A spot with an apparent molecular mass of ∼60 kDa (spot 1) was repeatedly observed in samples immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies, but not in samples immunoprecipitated with anti-IgG or the irrelevant antibody anti-HA. Four tryptic peptides were consistently observed in analyses of this spot by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF MS) mass spectrometry. A search of the Protein Prospector data base (prospector.ucsf.edu) matched all four peptides to tryptic fragments from Grb14, an adapter protein of ∼60 kDa (Table I).Table ITryptic peptides from a novel PDK-1 interacting protein match the adaptor protein Grb14Observed mass, MH+Predicted mass, MH+DifferencePeptide sequence1052.59351052.6104-0.0169ALLPLPDGTR1443.68151443.7014-0.0199DSPLAAQVCGAAQGR1669.93931670.0005-0.0612LIIQQGLVDGVFLVR2258.97292259.1086-0.1357HLQFFSEFGNSDIYVSLAGK Open table in a new tab Members of the Grb7 family of proteins, which includes Grb14, have a conserved Ras association domain, a PH domain, and an Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain (Fig. 2). Unique to Grb14 is a conserved amino-terminal proline-rich region (PRR, Fig. 2) that may bind SH3 domain-containing proteins. In addition, analysis of the Grb14 sequence (www.scansite.mit.edu) revealed a PDK-1 binding consensus motif (ΦXXΦEΦ, where X is a bulky hydrophobic such as Phe) previously referred to as PIF (PDK-1 interacting fragment) (36Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). To explore the mechanism of interaction of Grb14 with PDK-1, the Grb14 constructs listed in Fig. 2 were generated for bacterial and mammalian cell expression. Specifically, we generated a construct in which the key Glu in the PDK-1 binding motif was mutated to Ala (E195A), a construct in which the SH2 domain was deleted (ΔSH2), and a construct in which the PDK-1 binding motif was mutated and the SH2 domain was deleted (E195A/ΔSH2). We first asked whether the interaction observed in vivo between PDK-1 and Grb14 was direct. GST-PDK-1 and His-Grb14 were expressed in bacteria and affinity-purified. Fig. 3a shows GST-PDK-1 associated with His-Grb14 following incubation of the two pure proteins, each present at 2 and 50 μm, respectively (Fig. 3a, lane 3). Approximately 20% of the PDK-1 was associated with the His-Grb14 suggesting a binding affinity on the order of 100 μm under these conditions. In contrast, control experiments showed that no significant amount of GST-PDK-1 was pulled down by antibody in the absence of His-Grb14 (lane 1). Additionally, the GST protein alone did not bind to the His-Grb14 protein (lane 2). These data indicate that Grb14 directly interacts with PDK-1 in the absence of secondary protein associations. We next examined the interaction of PDK-1 and Grb14 in mammalian cells using the Grb14 constructs described in Fig. 2. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with Myc-PDK-1 alone or with the following Grb14 constructs: Xpress-tagged wild-type Grb14, Xpress-tagged E195A Grb14, an HA-tagged construct lacking the BPS and SH2 domains (ΔSH2), and the ΔSH2 construct with the E195A mutation. The lower panel in Fig. 3b shows the amount of Myc-PDK-1 in cell lysates. PDK-1 was effectively immunoprecipitated by wild-type Grb14 (lane 2). Significantly less PDK-1 was immunoprecipitated by the E195A construct, both for Xpress-tagged full-length (lane 3) and HA-tagged (lane 5) Grb14 lacking an SH2 domain. Quantitation of three independent experiments revealed approximately one-third as much PDK-1 bound the E195A constructs compared with wild-type Grb14. Removal of the carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain did not impair the association of PDK-1 with Grb14 (lane 4). Control conditions revealed that PDK-1 was absent in immunoprecipitations from cells not transfected with Xpress-Grb14 (lane 1). These data indicate that a primary determinant driving the binding of PDK-1 to Grb14 is the PDK-1 binding motif centered near residue Glu-195. Grb14 was initially identified by a proteomics approach analyzing protein bound to PDK-1 in HEK 293 cells. We selected a different cell line, MCF-7, which has been reported to have relatively high levels of Grb14 (29Daly R.J. Sanderson G.M. Janes P.W. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12502-12510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and PDK-1, to confirm the interaction of the endogenous proteins. The Western blot in Fig. 3c shows that 300 μg of lysate (corresponding to a total on the order of 109 cells) was sufficient for robust staining of PDK-1 (lane 1) and Grb14 (lane 2) with appropriate antibodies. Grb14 was specifically detected in immunoprecipitations using the PDK-1 antibody (Upstate), but not in immunoprecipitations using the Myc antibody (lanes 3 and 4, respectively). These data confirm the initial observation that PDK-1 and Grb14 interact in cells. We next addressed whether the interaction of PDK-1 with Grb14 changes upon stimulation of cells. HEK 293 cells transfected with the cDNA for wild type Myc-PDK-1 and Xpress-Grb14 were serum-starved for 18 h, then stimulated with insulin for 1–15 min. Fig. 3d shows that a constant amount of PDK-1 was present in immunoprecipitates of Grb14 independent of insulin treatment. Similarly, no change in the amount of PDK-1 present in Grb14 immune complexes was observed in HeLa cells treated without or with insulin (data not shown). These data suggest that the interaction of PDK-1 with Grb14 is constitutive and not sensitive to insulin stimulation. Grb14 translocates to activated tyrosine kinase receptors (20Anderson K.E.

https://openalex.org/W2036136056,"Y-family DNA polymerases lack some of the mechanisms that replicative DNA polymerases employ to ensure fidelity, resulting in higher error rates during replication of undamaged DNA templates and the ability to bypass certain aberrant bases, such as those produced by exposure to carcinogens, including benzo[a]pyrene (BP). A tumorigenic metabolite of BP, (+)-anti-benzo-[a]pyrene diol epoxide, attacks DNA to form the major 10S (+)-trans-anti-[BP]-N2-dG adduct, which has been shown to be mutagenic in a number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. The 10S (+)-trans-anti-[BP]-N2-dG adduct can cause all three base substitution mutations, and the SOS response in Escherichia coli increases bypass of bulky adducts, suggesting that Y-family DNA polymerases are involved in the bypass of such lesions. Dpo4 belongs to the DinB branch of the Y-family, which also includes E. coli pol IV and eukaryotic pol κ. We carried out primer extension assays in conjunction with molecular modeling and molecular dynamics studies in order to elucidate the structure-function relationship involved in nucleotide incorporation opposite the bulky 10S (+)-trans-anti-[BP]-N2-dG adduct by Dpo4. Dpo4 is able to bypass the 10S (+)-trans-anti-[BP]-N2-dG adduct, albeit to a lesser extent than unmodified guanine, and the Vmax values for insertion of all four nucleotides opposite the adduct by Dpo4 are similar. Computational studies suggest that 10S (+)-trans-anti-[BP]-N2-dG can be accommodated in the active site of Dpo4 in either the anti or syn conformation due to the limited protein-DNA contacts and the open nature of both the minor and major groove sides of the nascent base pair, which can contribute to the promiscuous nucleotide incorporation opposite this lesion. Y-family DNA polymerases lack some of the mechanisms that replicative DNA polymerases employ to ensure fidelity, resulting in higher error rates during replication of undamaged DNA templates and the ability to bypass certain aberrant bases, such as those produced by exposure to carcinogens, including benzo[a]pyrene (BP). A tumorigenic metabolite of BP, (+)-anti-benzo-[a]pyrene diol epoxide, attacks DNA to form the major 10S (+)-trans-anti-[BP]-N2-dG adduct, which has been shown to be mutagenic in a number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. The 10S (+)-trans-anti-[BP]-N2-dG adduct can cause all three base substitution mutations, and the SOS response in Escherichia coli increases bypass of bulky adducts, suggesting that Y-family DNA polymerases are involved in the bypass of such lesions. Dpo4 belongs to the DinB branch of the Y-family, which also includes E. coli pol IV and eukaryotic pol κ. We carried out primer extension assays in conjunction with molecular modeling and molecular dynamics studies in order to elucidate the structure-function relationship involved in nucleotide incorporation opposite the bulky 10S (+)-trans-anti-[BP]-N2-dG adduct by Dpo4. Dpo4 is able to bypass the 10S (+)-trans-anti-[BP]-N2-dG adduct, albeit to a lesser extent than unmodified guanine, and the Vmax values for insertion of all four nucleotides opposite the adduct by Dpo4 are similar. Computational studies suggest that 10S (+)-trans-anti-[BP]-N2-dG can be accommodated in the active site of Dpo4 in either the anti or syn conformation due to the limited protein-DNA contacts and the open nature of both the minor and major groove sides of the nascent base pair, which can contribute to the promiscuous nucleotide incorporation opposite this lesion. Members of the Y-family of DNA polymerases have been implicated in the bypass of DNA damage that poses blocks to high fidelity replicative A-family polymerases (1Boudsocq F. Iwai S. Hanaoka F.

The functional interplay between replicative and Y-family DNA polymerases, as well as the mechanism of damage bypass by both types of enzymes, is of considerable interest in understanding the origin of in vivo mutagenesis.

It is thought that the more permissive nature of Y-family polymerases has evolved, at least in part, to rescue replication machinery that is blocked by altered bases, such as those produced by exposure to bulky mutagens and carcinogens (26Ogi T.

Chemical carcinogens are encountered throughout the environment, and the manner by which their tumorigenic effects are exerted is of much interest in understanding the origins of environmental mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are an omnipresent class of environmental carcinogens that are byproducts of the incomplete combustion of organic matter, and thus, are produced during volcanic eruptions, and are present in automobile, jet, and factory emissions, barbequed meats and fish, and cigarette smoke (32Perrin J.

The electrophilic (+)-anti-BPDE attacks DNA predominantly at the exocyclic amino group of guanine to form the 10S (+)-trans-anti-[BP]-N2-dG ((+)-ta[BP]G) adduct (41Meehan T. Straub K.

High resolution NMR solution studies have shown that (+)-ta[BP]G adopts a normal anti conformation in duplex DNA opposite a dC partner, and the carcinogen moiety resides in the minor groove with its pyrenyl rings pointing toward the 5′-side of the damaged guanine (43Cosman M. de los Santos C.

A similar conformation, with the damaged guanine anti and hydrogen-bonded to its partner, is adopted when (+)-ta[BP]G is placed opposite dC at a single-strand/double junction (45Feng B. Gorin A. Hingerty B.E. Geacintov N.E. Broyde S. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13769-13779Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, with no partner opposite the lesion at a single-strand/double-strand junction, the (+)-ta[BP]G adduct adopts a syn conformation with the carcinogen moiety stacked on top of the duplex region (46Cosman M.

In Escherichia coli, the replicative DNA polymerase III has been shown to participate in the predominant point mutation pathway, namely G → T transversions, at (+)-ta[BP]G adducts in a 5′-GG*A-3′ sequence context, where G* represents the adduct (60Lenne-Samuel N.

However, induction of the SOS response in E. coli increases bypass of bulky adducts, including (+)-ta[BP]G, with a significant increase in both error-free and error-prone events (49Shukla R.

U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15548-15553Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), further supporting a physiological role for Y-family polymerases in lesion bypass. Previous studies have suggested that replicative DNA polymerases are predominantly blocked by (+)-ta[BP]G because the damaged base must adopt the less common syn conformation in order to be accommodated within the sterically constrained active site (72Perlow R.A. Broyde S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 519-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 73Perlow R.A. Broyde S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 291-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 74Perlow R.A. Broyde S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 797-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the mechanism by which the low fidelity Y-family DNA polymerases accommodate bulky lesions, such as (+)-ta[BP]G, compared with high fidelity DNA polymerases. Dpo4 is a Y-family DNA polymerase from the crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 that offers a unique opportunity to investigate the structure-function relationship involved in adduct bypass. Not only is the enzyme readily available for functional studies (1Boudsocq F. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4607-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Boudsocq F. Ling H. Yang W. Woodgate R. DNA Repair (Amst). 2002; 1: 343-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but high resolution crystal structures have also been solved of the ternary complex of this enzyme, including the primer-template and incoming nucleotide (2Ling H.

The 40-kDa Dpo4 enzyme belongs to the DinB branch of the Y-family, which also includes E. coli pol IV and eukaryotic pol κ (78Yang W. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4607-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite little sequence similarity, Dpo4 and other Y-family DNA polymerases display structural similarities to their replicative cousins, adopting shapes reminiscent of a right hand with palm, finger, and thumb domains (2Ling H.

However, unlike the α-helical nature of replicative polymerase finger domains, a β-strand and adjacent loop in the finger domain of Dpo4 contact the face of the nascent base pair (2Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). In addition, Dpo4 possesses an extra C-terminal domain, dubbed the little finger, that is thought to be involved in increasing processivity (1Boudsocq F. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R.

Dpo4 makes limited contacts with the primer-template, and notably, the minor groove side of the primer-template is solvent-exposed (2Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W.

Limited protein-DNA interactions and relaxed fidelity mechanisms may help explain why Dpo4 is both distributive, incorporating 1-2 nucleotides per primer-template binding event, and relatively error-prone, with a mutational frequency of 8 × 10-3 to 4 × 10-4 when replicating undamaged DNA (1Boudsocq F. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4607-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, we have carried out primer extension assays in conjunction with molecular modeling and molecular dynamics studies in order to elucidate the structure-function relationship involved in the incorporation of different nucleotides opposite the bulky (+)-ta[BP]G adduct catalyzed by Dpo4. Our experimental results reveal that this enzyme is able to incorporate all four bases opposite the damaged guanine at similar rates, and the simulations provide molecular explanations for the accommodation of each incoming nucleotide opposite this bulky carcinogen-DNA adduct.

https://openalex.org/W2034007329,"Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 6 (CEACAM6) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked immunoglobulin superfamily member that is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers. We have recently reported that suppression of CEACAM6 expression impairs pancreatic adenocarcinoma progression in vivo. In order to characterize the mechanisms through which CEACAM6 influences the malignant phenotype, CEACAM6-overexpressing Capan2 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells were established by stable transfection. We determined the effect of CEACAM6 overexpression on cellular invasiveness towards insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), a peptide of critical importance in pancreatic cancer malignant cellular behavior and tumor progression. IGF-I-induced cellular invasiveness and IGF-IR expression were significantly increased in clones overexpressing CEACAM6. Using inhibitory anti-IGF-IR antibody, a requirement for IGF-IR signaling in the enhanced invasiveness towards IGF-I induced by CEACAM6 overexpression was confirmed. CEACAM6-overexpressing clones exhibited increased Akt and c-Src kinase activities, as well as higher levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression and activity in the presence of IGF-I. While Akt kinase is both necessary and sufficient to induce IGF-IR upregulation, c-Src kinase activity is necessary, but alone is insufficient to upregulate IGF-IR expression. CEACAM6 is an important determinant of pancreatic adenocarcinoma malignant cellular behavior and, together with its downstream targets, warrants further investigation as a therapeutic target in this disease."
https://openalex.org/W1986140938,"We measured the kinetics of DNA bending by M.EcoRI using DNA labeled at both 5′-ends and observed changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Although known to bend its cognate DNA site, energy transfer is decreased upon enzyme binding. This unanticipated effect is shown to be robust because we observe the identical decrease with different dye pairs, when the dye pairs are placed on the respective 3′-ends, the effect is cofactor- and protein-dependent, and the effect is observed with duplexes ranging from 14 through 17 base pairs. The same labeled DNA shows the anticipated increased energy transfer with EcoRV endonuclease, which also bends this sequence, and no change in energy transfer with EcoRI endonuclease, which leaves this sequence unbent. We interpret these results as evidence for an increased end-to-end distance resulting from M.EcoRI binding, mediated by a mechanism novel for DNA methyltransferases, combining DNA bending and an overall expansion of the DNA duplex. The M.EcoRI protein sequence is poorly accommodated into well defined classes of DNA methyltransferases, both at the level of individual motifs and overall alignment. Interestingly, M.EcoRI has an intercalation motif observed in the FPG DNA glycosylase family of repair enzymes. Enzyme-dependent changes in anisotropy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer have similar rate constants, which are similar to the previously determined rate constant for base flipping; thus, the three processes are nearly coincidental. Similar fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments following AdoMet-dependent catalysis show that the unbending transition determines the steady state product release kinetics.

Structural transitions involving substrate-induced changes in enzyme conformation and protein-induced changes in substrate conformation occur in diverse classes of enzymes. The quantitative importance of such mechanisms toward catalysis and specificity has been demonstrated for DNA polymerases (1Radhakrishnan R. Schlick T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5970-5975Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), phytase (2Wang X.Y. Meng F.G. Zhou H.M. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5308-5314Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Yet, conformational mechanisms are difficult to study because the reaction intermediates are largely inaccessible to classical kinetic analysis. Spectroscopic probes and, in particular, the highly distant-dependent method of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) 1The abbreviations used are: FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; DTT, dithiothreitol. provide a viable solution-based approach to characterize conformational intermediates (7Hillisch A. Lorenz M. Diekmann S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Only through the quantitative analysis of stable conformational intermediates and the kinetic transitions involving their interconversion can a mechanistic understanding of catalysis and specificity be approached. DNA methyltransferases provide a rich system to investigate the mechanisms and importance of conformational transitions. The enzymes are structurally characterized, carry out both DNA bending and base flipping (8Jeltsch A. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 274-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the bacterial and human enzymes are the targets of novel antibiotic (9Wahnon D.C. Shier V.K. Benkovic S.J. J. Am. Chem Soc. 2001; 123: 976-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and cancer drug development efforts respectively (10Szyf M. Curr. Drug Targets. 2000; 1: 101-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These largely monomeric, AdoMet-dependent enzymes modify adenine (N6) or cytosine (N4 or C5) within duplex DNA by delivering a methyl moiety into the major groove. The biological consequences of this epigenetic DNA modification include the control of DNA replication and mismatch repair processes, the restriction of foreign DNA in bacteria, and gene transcriptional regulation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (8Jeltsch A. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 274-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). M.HhaI is a structurally characterized DNA cytosine methyltransferase, and was the first protein shown to stabilize an extrahelical base as part of its catalytic mechanism (11Cheng X. Kumar S. Posfai J. Pflugrath J.W. Roberts R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 299-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 12Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Similar base flipping conformational transitions have now been shown for diverse DNA methyltransferases, DNA repair enzymes, and RNA-modifying enzymes (13Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 181-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Some DNA methyltransferases also bend their cognate DNA sequence by 50-90° as part of their recognition mechanism, and the bending and base flipping process are energetically coupled (14Huang N. Banavali N.K. MacKerell Jr., A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Allan B.W. Garcia R. Maegley K. Mort J. Wong D. Lindstrom W.

The bacterial DNA adenine methyltransferase M.EcoRI modifies the second adenine in the palindromic sequence GAATTC (15Allan B.W. Garcia R. Maegley K. Mort J. Wong D. Lindstrom W. Beechem J.M. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19269-19275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The enzyme uses a facilitated diffusion mechanism to locate its sites within the bacterial genome, and its specificity constant (kcat/Km) is near diffusion-limited (16Surby M.A. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2209-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Surby M.A. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2201-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The discrimination of the enzyme against single base pair-modified non-cognate site methylation is up to 20,000-fold (18Reich N.O. Olsen C. Osti F. Murphy J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15802-15807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). M.EcoRI stabilizes a ∼50° bend upon binding its cognate site as well as extruding the target adenine into an extrahelical position to facilitate catalysis (19Garcia R.A. Bustamante C.J. Reich N.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7618-7622Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The DNA binding and base-flipping transitions are nearly concerted, as determined by fluorescence two-colored experiments (6Allan B.W. Reich N.O. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5308-5314Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 20Allan B.W. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14757-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 21Allan B.W.

Scheme I summarizes these characterized transitions and kinetic constants for M.EcoRI. Recently, we described an intriguing M.EcoRI mutant, H235N, which does not appear to bend its cognate sequence, yet shows largely wild-type steady state parameters (15Allan B.W. Garcia R. Maegley K.

Surprisingly, this bending-deficient mutant sequence-discrimination is enhanced at least 1000-fold, suggesting a close relationship between DNA bending and specificity. Moreover, the rate of base flipping of the mutant is dramatically slowed down, to the point of determining kcat, in contrast to the wild-type protein whose kcat is determined by product release events. Although no protein-DNA cocrystal structure exists for M.EcoRI, the available detailed kinetic analysis (6Allan B.W. Reich N.O. Beechem J.M.

Here we describe our initial efforts to determine the wild-type enzyme kinetics of bending and unbending with the cognate sequence. The FRET strategy used here is similar to that pioneered by others to investigate the protein-induced DNA bending with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) (22Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Powell R.M. Parkhurst K.M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 31685-31690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our hypothesis is that the bending transition for the wild-type protein and cognate site occurs concertedly with DNA binding. Moreover, this study provides the basis for understanding how changes in DNA sequence impact on the bending and base flipping transitions, and for understanding the molecular basis of the enhanced specificity of the mutant (15Allan B.W. Garcia R. Maegley K. Mort J. Wong D. Lindstrom W. Beechem J.M. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19269-19275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our FRET results were unanticipated, in that upon binding its cognate sequence, the wild-type enzyme causes a decrease in energy transfer, consistent with a net expansion of the dye-to-dye distance in the protein-DNA complex. Since the protein is known to bend its DNA sequence (19Garcia R.A. Bustamante C.J. Reich N.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7618-7622Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and thus was anticipated to cause an energy transfer increase, this suggests that M.EcoRI interacts with its target site in a novel fashion. Protein sequence comparisons with functionally related DNA adenine methyltransferases shows the M.EcoRI to be unrelated to these other members, lacking the majority of the conserved motifs. We also identified a motif within M.EcoRI, which is found in several proteins that intercalate amino acids into the B-form duplex. Enzyme Expression and Purification—M.EcoRI was purified from MM294 Escherichia coli cells harboring the pXRI overexpression plasmid to apparent homogeneity as previously described (20Allan B.W. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14757-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria Broth (LB) supplemented with 100 μl/ml ampicillin with continuous aeration. Cells were induced in early log phase (OD600 = 0.4) with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2-4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in a Sorvall RC-5B and stored at -20 °C. The protein was purified using phosphocellulose P-11, hydroxyapatite, and Biorex-70 cation exchange columns and an Amersham Biosciences FPLC system. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. M.EcoRI purity was determined to be >95% by SDS-PAGE analysis. Aliquots of purified enzyme were flash frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the extinction coefficient of 46,151 m-1 cm-1 at 280 nm calculated from the Biopolymer Calculator v.4.1.1 (paris.chem.yale.edu). Concentrations determined using the published extinction coefficient EC1% = 10.8 gave similar values (25Rubin R.A. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7265-7272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concentration was further validated by comparison to EcoRV endonuclease (gift from D. Hiller) of known concentration in a dilution SDS-PAGE analysis. Enzyme activity was determined by S-[methyl-3H]adenosylmethionine (ICN) incorporation into calf thymus DNA or synthetic 14-mer duplex DNA containing the GAATTC recognition sequence (26Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2933-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and shown to be active (data not shown). DNA Synthesis and Fluorophore Coupling—DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized at Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.

The M.EcoRI six base pair recognition sequence is underlined. Adenine-thymine end base pairs were used to avoid the known quenching effect of guanine bases on fluorescence (27Kubota Y. Motoda Y.

Concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at A260 using the calculated extinction coefficients based on nearest neighbor calculations. 5-(and-6)-Alexa Fluor 488, succinimidyl ester (A-20000) and 5-(and 6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine, succinimidyl ester (C-1171) were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. Cy3 and Cy5 (RPN-5661) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Oligonucleotides were resuspended in dH20, extracted with chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in dH20 to a final concentration of 25 μg/μl (100 μg of total oligonucleotide). Coupling reactions were performed with 10-20-fold molar excess of dye to oligonucleotide. 250 μg of Alexa 488, 200 μg of TAMRA, 153 μg of Cy3, and 127 μg of Cy5 were warmed to room temperature and resuspended in 14 μl of Me2SO immediately prior to coupling. Coupling was done in fresh 75 mm sodium tetraborate (pH 8.5) in the dark with low shaking overnight. Overnight couplings were ethanol-precipitated, and TAMRA-modified oligonucleotides were subject to a second precipitation to remove any nonspecifically interacting free dye. Coupled oligonucleotides were re-suspended in 55 μl of 0.1 m triethylammonium acetate (TEAA), pH 7.0, filtered through a B-101 stainless steel filter (Upchurch Scientific), and purified on an analytical Vydac C4 column with an in-line filter and C4 guard column on a Waters/Millipore HPLC system (616 pump, 600S controller, and 996 photodiode array detector). A linear gradient of 0-80% acetonitrile in 0.1 m TEAA, pH 7.0, from 2-40 min or from 2-60 min for Alexa 488-coupled oligonucleotides was used to remove uncoupled oligonucleotide and unreacted dye from coupled oligonucleotide. Absorbance at 260 nm (oligonucleotide) and fluorophore λmax were simultaneously monitored (Alexa 488, λmax = 492 nm; TAMRA, λmax = 560 nm; Cy3, λmax = 549 nm; Cy5, λmax = 648 nm). Peaks with absorbances at both 260 nm and dye λmax were manually collected. Coupled oligonucleotides were lyophilized in a Speed-Vac (Savant) and resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA (TE). Concentrations of oligonucleotide and dye were determined by absorbance scan from 230 to 700 nm and determined to be 100% coupled. Fluorophore absorbance at 260 nm was subtracted from oligonucleotide/duplex absorbance at 260 nm using Equation 1,Aoligo/duplex=A260−(Adye×CF)(Eq. 1) Adye represents fluorophore absorbance at λmax. CF represents the correction factor for dye and was determined to be 0.3 for Alexa 488 singly labeled oligonucleotides and duplexes, 0.4 for TAMRA singly labeled oligonucleotides and duplexes, 0.7 for Alexa 488-TAMRA doubly labeled duplexes, and no correction for Cy3- and Cy5-labeled oligonucleotides and duplexes. Purified oligonucleotide dye conjugates were analyzed by both 20% native PAGE (89 mm Tris, 89 mm borate, 2 mm EDTA) run at a constant 300 V for 2-3 h and by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry in negative-ion mode (Q-STAR, Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex) with an m/z range of 500-2000. Oligonucleotides were annealed in TE buffer supplemented with 50 mm NaCl at a 1:1.5 molar ratio with excess acceptor-labeled or unlabeled oligonucleotide, heated at 85-90 °C for 5 min, with slow cooling to room temperature over several hours. Annealed duplexes were analyzed by 20% native PAGE. DNA was visualized with a Typhoon 8600 fluorimager (Amersham Biosciences). Dissociation Constant Determination,KDDNA—To determine M.EcoRI binding affinity (KDDNA) for singly labeled DNA, 5′-Alexa 488-modified DNA, a gel mobility shift assay was performed (15Allan B.W. Garcia R. Maegley K. Mort J. Wong D. Lindstrom W. Beechem J.M. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19269-19275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 nm DNA was incubated with 0-50 nm M.EcoRI in the presence of 20 μm sinefungin (Sigma) in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm DTT (MRB) buffer supplemented with 50 mm NaCl in a total volume of 30 μl. Binding reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, mixed with 6× gel-loading buffer (40% glycerol, 45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA), and resolved on a native 12% PAGE gel (89 mm Tris, 89 mm EDTA, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol) run at 500 V for 5 min and then 300 V for 2 h at 4 °C. Free duplex and ternary complex were visualized on a Typhoon 8600 fluorimager (Amersham Biosciences). A FRET-based determination of the DNA dissociation constant was also obtained for doubly labeled DNA (5′-Alexa 488/5′-TAMRA). Briefly, DNA (25 nm) was preincubated with 1 μm sinefungin in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm DTT. 0-100 nm M.EcoRI was added, and Alexa 488 emission was integrated and plotted against enzyme concentration. Experiments were done on a PerkinElmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer at room temperature with 485-nm excitation and 8-nm excitation and 10-nm emission slits. Data from both gel shift and fluorescence experiments were fit to a quadratic binding equation to determine KDDNA. M.EcoRI was confirmed to bind all other modified DNA duplexes by a single enzyme concentration gel shift analysis. These experiments were carried out essentially as described above using DNA (5 nm) incubated with M.EcoRI (50 nm). Stopped Flow FRET—Stopped flow fluorescence experiments was performed on an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped flow reaction analyzer outfitted with a single channel emission photomultiplier tube (PMT) oriented at 90° to the excitation beam. Donor fluorophore was excited at 485 nm (λex) through 8-mm monochromater slits with a 150 watt xenon lamp. Pressure was maintained at 100 psi with compressed N2. Energy transfer was detected as an increase in donor (Alexa 488) emission (λem) through a 515-nm cutoff filter (Edmund Industrial Optics). All experiments were conducted by loading separate syringes with DNA alone, enzyme and cofactor, and buffer alone. The buffer contained 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. Duplex DNA concentration was constant at 10 nm (final) and was rapidly mixed with enzyme concentration (50-500 nm, final). Vast excess of one reactant allows the study of a second-order reaction under pseudo first-order conditions (30Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. 3rd Ed. WH Freeman and Company, 1998Google Scholar). A background was obtained by mixing DNA and buffer alone. The cofactor analog sinefungin was constant at 2 μm and was preincubated with the enzyme solutions. All experiments were held constant at 22 °C with a circulating water bath. Reactions were initiated by rapidly mixing 200 μl of DNA with 20 μl of enzyme and cofactor. Data were collected for 10 s with 400 data points/sec. Data from 2 to 3 time courses were averaged to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. This averaged data set was then fit to the single exponential Equation 2,y=yo+a×exp(−bx)(Eq. 2) where yo is the background fluorescence, a is the amplitude, b is the rate constant, and x is time. Residual analysis of the fits was also performed. To reduce variation within a single experiment, several independent experiments were performed, and the rates calculated were averaged. To extract the forward rates (kbend), the observed rates (kobs) versus enzyme concentration was plotted and fit to a simple linear Equation 3 (30Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. 3rd Ed. WH Freeman and Company, 1998Google Scholar).kobs=kbend[E]+koff(Eq. 3) Stopped Flow Catalysis—To observe the initial energy transfer decrease due to protein-DNA bent-complex and subsequent product release, reaction conditions were similar to those described above with the exception that 2 μmS-adenosylmethionine was substituted for sinefungin. The observation time was increased to 50 or 100 s. EcoRI Endonuclease Challenge—The methylation state of doubly labeled DNA was determined by EcoRI endonuclease analysis. DNA and M.EcoRI taken directly from the stopped flow catalysis experiment were used. 10 nm DNA was incubated with buffer (mock), 500 nm enzyme for 50 s (stopped flow conditions), or overnight (positive control) at room temperature. The enzyme was heat-inactivated by incubating at 95 °C for 5 min with slow cooling to room temperature. Mg2+ was added to a final concentration of 11 mm and combined with 40 units of EcoRI endonuclease (NEB). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Samples were run for 1 h at a constant 300 V on a 20% nondenaturing PAGE gel (89 mm Tris, 89 mm borate, 2 mm EDTA) at room temperature. DNA was visualized on a Typhoon 8600 fluorimager by scanning with a 532-nm laser and collecting emission through a 526-short-pass filter for Alexa 488. Images were exported into ImageQuant v5.2 (Molecular Dynamics) for analysis. Stopped Flow Fluorescence Anisotropy—Stopped flow anisotropy was performed with the same apparatus described above with the FP.1 anisotropy hardware and software package installed (Applied Photophysics). A T-format detection scheme was used with λex = 555 nm and horizontal and vertical emission measurements collected through two 570-nm cutoff filters (Edmund Industrial Optics). The G-factor was determined and automatically corrected for in anisotropy calculations. 50 nm TAMRA-labeled duplex DNA incubated in the above buffer was mixed with increasing enzyme (200, 300, 500 nm final) preincubated with 2 μm sinefungin. Data were collected in oversampling mode to reduce background noise. Data were collected over a 2, 5, or 10 s time course, and 2-3 runs were averaged to obtain adequate signal-to-noise. A plot of kobsversus enzyme concentration was used to obtain the association rate (kon). Anisotropy (Anis) was calculated according to Equation 4 (31Lakowicz J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, 1999Crossref Google Scholar).Anis−I∥−I⊥/I∥+2I⊥(Eq. 4) Total emission (Ems) was calculated from Equation 5.Ems=I∥+2I⊥(Eq. 5) Steady State FRET—Equilibrium fluorescence experiments were performed on an LS50B luminescence spectrometer at room temperature. Because different fluorophores were used, excitation and emission wavelengths and excitation and emission slits varied and are indicated in the corresponding figures. Solutions contained either 10 or 25 nm DNA preincubated with 1 μm sinefungin and 28 or 50 nm enzyme was added, respectively. Quantitation of fluorescence was done by integrating λmax± 5 nm. For all experiments, the lamp was warmed for 30-60 min, and scans of DNA alone were performed until consecutive scans were identical. Enzyme was added, manually mixed, and allowed to equilibrate for 2-3 min before taking emission scans. All experiments were performed in a narrow quartz fluorescence cuvette (Starna Cells). For EcoRI and EcoRV endonuclease fluorescence experiments, buffer conditions were 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm Ca2+, and 100 mm NaCl. Cleavage was initiated by supplementing with 25 mm Mg2+. 10 nm Alexa 488/TAMRA doubly labeled DNA was mixed with 63 nm EcoRI endonuclease or 490 nm EcoRV endonuclease. Distance Calculations—FRET was used to calculate distance changes from free DNA to M.EcoRI-DNA complexes according to Equation 6 (31Lakowicz J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed.

The refractive indices of the reference and sample solution were assumed to be equal. φRF represents the quantum yield of the fluorescein reference (φRF = 0.95 for fluorescein) (33Brannon J. Magde D.

https://openalex.org/W2003218139,"Replication forks often stall at undamaged or damaged template sites in Escherichia coli. Subsequent resumption of DNA synthesis occurs by replacing DNA polymerase III, which is bound to DNA by the β-sliding clamp, with one of three damage-induced DNA polymerases II, IV, or V. The principal role of the β clamp is to tether the normally weakly bound polmerases to DNA thereby increasing their processivities. DNA polymerase IV binds dNTP substrates with about 10-fold lower affinity compared with the other E. coli polymerases, which if left unchecked could hinder its ability to synthesize DNA in vivo. Here we report a new property for the β clamp, which when bound to DNA polymerase IV results in a large increase in dNTP binding affinity that concomitantly increases the efficiency of nucleotide incorporation at normal and transiently slipped mispaired primer/template ends. Primer-template DNA slippage resulting in single nucleotide deletions is a biological hallmark of DNA polymerase IV infidelity responsible for enhancing cell fitness in response to stress. We show that the increased DNA polymerase IV-dNTP binding affinity is an intrinsic property of the DNA polymerase IV-β clamp interaction and not an indirect consequence of an increased binding of DNA polymerase IV to DNA.

The β-sliding clamp and γ clamp-loading complex, essential components of the Escherichia coli pol III 1The abbreviations used are: pol, DNA polymerase; β/γ, the complex composed of the β-dimer sliding clamp and five-subunit γ clamp loader; nt, nucleotide; p/t DNA, primer-template DNA. 1The abbreviations used are: pol, DNA polymerase; β/γ, the complex composed of the β-dimer sliding clamp and five-subunit γ clamp loader; nt, nucleotide; p/t DNA, primer-template DNA. replication complex, bind core pol III tightly to p/t DNA to facilitate processive replication of DNA (1O'Donnell M. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 2McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19127-19130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Replication proceeds until a template block, in the form of a pause site on undamaged DNA or an aberrant template base, is encountered on either the leading or lagging strand, whereupon the replication fork becomes stalled. Blocked replication is alleviated when the pol III core dissociates from β and is replaced by one of three damage-induced lesion-bypass polymerases, pols II, IV, and V (3Lopez de Saro F.J. Georgescu R.E. Goodman M.F. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Each pol, when present alone or in any combination, increases cell fitness thereby ensuring survival during periods of stress (4Yeiser B. Pepper E.D. Goodman M.F. Finkel S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8737-8741Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).Ideally, error-prone pols are restricted to copying localized regions of DNA so as to avoid generating excessive numbers of mutations. Acting as a “traffic cop,” the β clamp offers a way to switch back and forth between replication and repair pols (5Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 70: 17-50Crossref Scopus (625) Google Scholar). The conundrum is that the β clamp has been shown to increase the processivity of the error-prone pols (6Kobayashi S. Valentine M.R.

Data presented here reveal a new and unexpected role for β when interacting with pol IV.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEnzymes, Buffer, and Oligonucleotides—pol IV, pol II, and the β,γ complex were purified as described previously (6Kobayashi S.

Oligonucleotides were synthesized using β-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite chemistry on an Applied Biosystems (model 392 RNA/DNA) synthesizer and purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 80-mer template was labeled at the 5′ end with X-rhodamine (Molecular Probes, catalog number X-491) (13Bloom L.B. Turner J. Kelman Z. Beechem J.M. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

Steady State Anisotropy Measurements—Fluorescence experiments were on instrumentation described previously (15Bertram J.G. Bloom L.B. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Beecham J.M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24564-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The initial anisotropy of rhodamine-labeled p/t DNA (50 nm) was measured. pol IV was added in 1-μl aliquots with additional measurements taken subsequent to each protein titration. Anisotropy data were converted to the concentration of bound DNA using the following equation, fB=r−rFrB−rF×[D0] (Eq. 1) where r is the measured anisotropy, rF is the anisotropy without protein, rB is the anisotropy of fully bound DNA, and D0 is the initial concentration of p/t DNA. The concentration of bound DNA was fit to the quadratic equation shown below to determine the Kd for DNA, fB=Kd+E0+D0−(Kd+E0+D0)2−4E0D02 (Eq. 2) where E0 and D0 are initial pol IV and p/t DNA concentrations, respectively.Presteady State Anisotropy Measurements—Stopped flow anisotropy measurements were obtained using an Applied Photophysics spectrofluorometer as described (16Bertram J.G. Bloom L.B. Hingorani M.M. Beechem J.M. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28413-28420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A preincubated solution of rhodaminelabed p/t DNA (100 nm) and pol IV (2 μm) was rapidly mixed with M13 (1 mm) trap DNA. Fluorescence data were obtained in real time by exciting the sample at 580 nm and collecting emission data points as it passed through a 600-nm cut on filter. To increase the signal to noise ratio 10 traces were averaged, and a 21-point smoothing analysis was performed on the averaged trace.Kinetic Parameters for pol IV Using Rapid Quench—A Kintek quench-flow instrument was used to measure kpol and Kd, dNTP under presteady state conditions. A solution of p/t DNA (50 nm) and pol IV (1 μm) was rapidly mixed with dNTP, allowed to react for a given amount of time, and then quenched with EDTA (0.5 m). In reactions containing the accessory proteins, 400 nm γ complex and 600 nm β were included in the solution prior to mixing with dNTP. Data points were collected between 0.01 and 30 s. The radiolabeled primer was resolved on a 16% polyacrylamide gel and quantitated with ImageQuant software from Amersham Biosciences. The concentration of extended primer was determined by multiplying the percent of extended primer by the p/t DNA concentration. Reactions were repeated multiple times to obtain standard error.RESULTSTo analyze the effect of the β/γ accessory clamp assembly on pol IV nucleotide incorporation efficiencies, we measured presteady-state kinetics of nt incorporation by pol IV in the presence or absence of β/γ. When DNA is in excess of pol IV, a rapid burst of nucleotide incorporation (kobs = 12 s-1) is followed by a slower steady state phase of product formation (kss = 0.03 s-1) that occurs at the same rate as polymerase·DNA dissociation in reactions containing β/γ (Fig. 1a, squares). In the absence of β/γ, biphasic kinetics of nucleotide incorporation is also observed, but the initial burst of incorporation occurs at a rate reduced by a factor of 10 compared with reactions containing β/γ. The slow phase of product formation in the absence of β/γ occurs at a rate (0.18 s-1) that is much slower than the rate of enzyme·DNA dissociation (koff ≈ 10 s-1, Fig. 1b, inset) and therefore must be limited by the rate of some other kinetic step.One obvious mechanism by which β/γ could affect the kinetics of nucleotide incorporation would be to increase the fraction of pol IV productively bound to p/t DNA. Therefore, single turnover experiments were done under conditions in which DNA was saturated with pol IV to eliminate differences in DNA binding. Anisotropy assays measuring binding of pol IV to X-rhodamine-labeled p/t DNA under equilibrium conditions yield a dissociation constant, Kd,DNA for pol IV·DNA of 50 nm (Fig. 1b). Based on this Kd value, at least 0.5 μm pol IV in reactions containing 50 nm DNA is necessary to ensure that virtually all the DNA remains bound by the enzyme when measuring incorporation during a single pol turnover (17Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar).Rapid quench single turnover measurements were performed to determine the catalytic rate constant (kpol) and equilibrium dTTP dissociation constant (Kd,dTTP). kpol was found to be similar to within a factor of two in the presence or absence of β clamp (Fig. 2a). In contrast, Kd,dTTP was decreased by about an order of magnitude in the presence of the β clamp (Fig. 2a).Fig. 2Effect of β clamp on pol IV and pol II dNTP binding affinities and catalytic rate constants.a, upper panel, the graph labeled for pol IV shows the velocity of nucleotide incorporation for pol IV (1 μm) on streptavidin-bound p/t DNA (50 nm) at varied concentrations of dTTP (62.5 (•), 125 (○), 250 (▾), 500 (▿), 1000 (▪), and 2000 (□) μm). Similar experiments using the accessory proteins, 600 nm β, and 400 nm γ complex, at 12.5 (•), 25 (○), 50 (▾), 100 (▿), 200 (▪), and 400 (□) μm dTTP are shown in the graph labeled “pol IV + β,γ complex.” In the lower panel, the rate at each dTTP concentration was plotted and fit to a rectangular hyperbola to obtain kpol and Kd,dTTP. b, using pol II, the rates at varying dTTP concentrations were plotted and fit to a rectangular hyperbola. Protein concentrations were the same as those described for pol IV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The low dNTP binding affinity for pol IV in the absence of β (Kd,dTTP ∼ 450 μm), would portend a poor replication efficiency in vivo even if pol IV were tethered to the DNA by the β clamp because dNTP pool sizes in E. coli are ∼100 μm (18Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 54Google Scholar). Instead, the β clamp appears to be playing two separate roles, its “standard” role to stabilize pol IV on DNA by reducing its dissociation rate from ∼10 to 0.03 s-1 (Fig. 1), along with a new role to increase pol IV binding to dNTP substrates. In contrast, Kd,dTTP for pol II is about the same in the presence and absence of β (Fig. 2b). We have verified that similar reductions in Kd,dNTP, accompanied by little or no change in kpol, are observed when pol IV copies a variety of p/t DNA constructs, including primed closed circular DNA and linear p/t DNA in the presence of single-strand binding protein (data not shown).In vivo, pol IV tends to generate-1 deletions in short homopolymeric runs giving rise to adaptive mutations in nondividing cells (19Foster P.L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2000; 65: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Bull H.J. Lombardo M.J. Rosenberg S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8334-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A crystal structure reported for a ternary complex composed of Sulfolobus solfataricus Dpo4 (a homolog of pol IV)-p/t DNA-ddGTP shows just such a frameshift mutational intermediate in which two template bases are positioned in the pol active cleft (21Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The “first” template base (G) is located out of the helical plane allowing the ddG to be paired opposite the “downstream” template C (21Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar).A similar slipped p/t DNA structure occurs dynamically during pol IV synthesis as shown by fluorescence kinetics measurements (6Kobayashi S. Valentine M.R. Pham P. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34198-34207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To investigate p/t DNA slippage, we performed rapid quench experiments to determine how the β clamp might influence pol IV kinetics when copying a dT-dA short homopolymer run (Fig. 3). A slipped p/t DNA can be formed by “forcing” insertion of G opposite a downstream template C when the “next correct” dTTP is omitted from the reaction (Fig. 3). A 3-fold increase in pol IV-dGTP binding affinity occurs in the presence of β clamp on the slipped p/t DNA, with essentially no change in kpol ∼ 2-3 s-1 (Fig. 3). When the downstream base was changed from C to G to eliminate slippage and thereby promote misincorporation, kpol values for dGMP·A misincorporation, either with or without β/γ, are about 100-fold less than those for “correct” dGMP·C incorporation on a transiently misaligned DNA, while Kd,dGTP values are in a range of 500-750 μm ± β/γ (data not shown). The G·C slipped-mispaired incorporation efficiencies (kpol/Kd,dNTP) are favored over G·A misincorporation efficiencies by ∼100-fold either with or without the β clamp. Therefore, β appears to increase efficiencies for deletion and base substitution mutational intermediates to a similar 5-fold extent, based on the kpol/Kd,dGTP ratios with and without β/γ, either for incorporation on a slipped-mispaired p/t DNA end or for dGMP·A misincorporation.Fig. 3Kinetcs of pol IV-generated frameshift mutational intermediates in the presence or absence of β clamp. The rates at varying dGTP concentrations were plotted and fit to a rectangular hyperbola to obtain kpol and Kd,dGTP during DNA slippage. The graphs are labeled pol IV and pol IV + β and γ complex. Protein concentrations are 1 μm pol IV, 50 nm DNA, and when used 400 nm γ complex and 600 nm β.

O'Donnell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8376-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). An important open question concerns “how, when, and where” different proteins exchange on the clamp. In the case of E. coli, each of the five pols can bind to β (3Lopez de Saro F.J. Georgescu R.E. Goodman M.F. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the tethered pols tend to exhibit significantly increased processivity. In the case of replicative pol III, the processivity is increased from about 15 nt to greater than 5000 nt (23Fay P.J. Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 976-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Processivities for the three SOS pols are also increased but to a much lesser extent (6Kobayashi S. Valentine M.R. Pham P. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34198-34207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7Wagner J. Fujji S. Gruz P. Nohmi T. Fuchs R.P. EMBO J. 2000; 1: 484-488Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 24Bonner C.A. Stukenberg P.T. Rajagopalan M. Eritja R. O'Donnell M. McEntee K. Echols H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

Nature. 2000; 404: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar).The data in this paper show unexpectedly that the β clamp alters the intrinsic dNTP binding affinity for pol IV (Fig. 2a), an effect that is not observed for pol II (Fig. 2b). The value of Kd,dTTP for pol IV is about 500 μm, which is 25-fold higher than observed for pol II (∼20 μm) (Fig. 2). Such weak binding of pol IV to its cognate dNTP substrate would be likely to render it inactive in vivo. Our observation that β clamp enhances pol IV-dNTP affinity by an order of magnitude brings it in line with normal Michaelis constants, which are typically 20-50 μm, obtained from steady state kinetics data.The stabilizing effect of β on the pol IV-dNTP binding affinity is unrelated to the stabilizing effect of the clamp on pol IV-p/t DNA binding because the experimental conditions used to measure single-turnover incorporation kinetics (pol IV concentration >> p/t DNA concentration, Fig. 1b) ensure that the pol IV-p/t DNA off-rate (koff ∼ 10 s-1, Fig. 1b) does not influence the single-turnover rate (Fig. 2a). Put another way, the primer extension product measured during a single turnover results from a single enzyme-DNA encounter. Thus, the interaction of pol IV with β is likely to cause a conformational change in the enzyme that increases its catalytic efficiency, kpol/Kd,dNTP, by increasing dNTP binding affinity but without affecting kpol.A recent crystal structure shows the C-terminal peptide of pol IV bound to β (26Bunting K.A. Roe S.M. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5883-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) suggesting that the pol binds in either of two states, a “locked-down” complex with no access to DNA or in an alternative complex in which rotation of a peptide chain brings the enzyme into close proximity with the p/t DNA junction. Based on our kinetic data, we suggest that this same conformational change may also be responsible for enhancing dNTP binding affinity. pol IV dissociates rapidly from p/t DNA (koff = 10 s-1) and interacts weakly with substrate dNTP (Kd,dNTP ∼ 0.5 mm). The β clamp compensates for both deficiencies first by working in its traditional mode to target pol IV to specific blocking template sites by enhancing its binding to p/t DNA and second by acting atypically to allow pol IV to bind dNTP much more avidly (Kd,dNTP ∼ 50 μm) to convert it from an inefficient to an efficient enzyme.Elimination of any one of the three SOS pols results in a significant reduction in cell fitness in stationary populations of E. coli (4Yeiser B. Pepper E.D. Goodman M.F. Finkel S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8737-8741Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). pol IV has been specifically found to generate small deletion mutations, called adaptive mutations, in reiterated sequences in nonproliferating cells placed under nonlethal selective pressure (19Foster P.L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2000; 65: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Bull H.J. Lombardo M.J. Rosenberg S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8334-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The β-enhanced dNTP binding to pol IV observed in a short dT:dA p/t DNA sequence in vitro (Fig. 3) could facilitate this type of mutation in vivo thus contributing to cell survival during stressful periods. Whereas the high fidelity replicative pol III can remain bound to β for several min, allowing it to copy the entire E. coli genome (4 mb) at a rate approaching 103 nt/s, the less active pol IV remains bound for only ∼0.5 min (koff ∼ 0.03 s-1, Fig. 1) allowing the addition of no more than 600 nt, assuming a maximum polymerization rate (kpol ∼ 20 s-1, Fig. 2a). More realistically, considering the relatively low intracellular dNTP pool concentrations, ∼100 μm (18Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 54Google Scholar), pol IV would be “lucky” to copy 10 to perhaps 50 template bases. Thus, from a teleological prospective, due to its unique interactions with β clamp, pol IV can remain bound to DNA long enough to copy through “difficult” template sequences but not long enough to create a lethal mutational load. The β-sliding clamp and γ clamp-loading complex, essential components of the Escherichia coli pol III 1The abbreviations used are: pol, DNA polymerase; β/γ, the complex composed of the β-dimer sliding clamp and five-subunit γ clamp loader; nt, nucleotide; p/t DNA, primer-template DNA. 1The abbreviations used are: pol, DNA polymerase; β/γ, the complex composed of the β-dimer sliding clamp and five-subunit γ clamp loader; nt, nucleotide; p/t DNA, primer-template DNA. replication complex, bind core pol III tightly to p/t DNA to facilitate processive replication of DNA (1O'Donnell M. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 2McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19127-19130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Replication proceeds until a template block, in the form of a pause site on undamaged DNA or an aberrant template base, is encountered on either the leading or lagging strand, whereupon the replication fork becomes stalled. Blocked replication is alleviated when the pol III core dissociates from β and is replaced by one of three damage-induced lesion-bypass polymerases, pols II, IV, and V (3Lopez de Saro F.J. Georgescu R.E. Goodman M.F. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Each pol, when present alone or in any combination, increases cell fitness thereby ensuring survival during periods of stress (4Yeiser B. Pepper E.D. Goodman M.F. Finkel S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8737-8741Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Ideally, error-prone pols are restricted to copying localized regions of DNA so as to avoid generating excessive numbers of mutations. Acting as a “traffic cop,” the β clamp offers a way to switch back and forth between replication and repair pols (5Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 70: 17-50Crossref Scopus (625) Google Scholar). The conundrum is that the β clamp has been shown to increase the processivity of the error-prone pols (6Kobayashi S. Valentine M.R.

Oligonucleotides were synthesized using β-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite chemistry on an Applied Biosystems (model 392 RNA/DNA) synthesizer and purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 80-mer template was labeled at the 5′ end with X-rhodamine (Molecular Probes, catalog number X-491) (13Bloom L.B. Turner J. Kelman Z. Beechem J.M. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

The initial anisotropy of rhodamine-labeled p/t DNA (50 nm) was measured. pol IV was added in 1-μl aliquots with additional measurements taken subsequent to each protein titration. Anisotropy data were converted to the concentration of bound DNA using the following equation, fB=r−rFrB−rF×[D0] (Eq. 1) where r is the measured anisotropy, rF is the anisotropy without protein, rB is the anisotropy of fully bound DNA, and D0 is the initial concentration of p/t DNA. The concentration of bound DNA was fit to the quadratic equation shown below to determine the Kd for DNA, fB=Kd+E0+D0−(Kd+E0+D0)2−4E0D02 (Eq. 2) where E0 and D0 are initial pol IV and p/t DNA concentrations, respectively.Presteady State Anisotropy Measurements—Stopped flow anisotropy measurements were obtained using an Applied Photophysics spectrofluorometer as described (16Bertram J.G.

A preincubated solution of rhodaminelabed p/t DNA (100 nm) and pol IV (2 μm) was rapidly mixed with M13 (1 mm) trap DNA. Fluorescence data were obtained in real time by exciting the sample at 580 nm and collecting emission data points as it passed through a 600-nm cut on filter. To increase the signal to noise ratio 10 traces were averaged, and a 21-point smoothing analysis was performed on the averaged trace.Kinetic Parameters for pol IV Using Rapid Quench—A Kintek quench-flow instrument was used to measure kpol and Kd, dNTP under presteady state conditions. A solution of p/t DNA (50 nm) and pol IV (1 μm) was rapidly mixed with dNTP, allowed to react for a given amount of time, and then quenched with EDTA (0.5 m). In reactions containing the accessory proteins, 400 nm γ complex and 600 nm β were included in the solution prior to mixing with dNTP. Data points were collected between 0.01 and 30 s. The radiolabeled primer was resolved on a 16% polyacrylamide gel and quantitated with ImageQuant software from Amersham Biosciences. The concentration of extended primer was determined by multiplying the percent of extended primer by the p/t DNA concentration. Reactions were repeated multiple times to obtain standard error.

We found that an mRNA export factor Gle2p rapidly dissociated from the nuclear envelope and diffused into the cytoplasm at 42 °C. However, in exponential phase cells pretreated with mild heat stress (37 °C for 1 h), Gle2p did not dissociate at 42 °C, and the export of bulk poly(A)+ mRNA continued. Cells in stationary phase also continued with the export of bulk poly(A)+ mRNA at 42 °C without the dissociation of Gle2p from the nuclear envelope. The dissociation of Gle2p was caused by increased membrane fluidity and correlated closely with blocking of the export of bulk poly(A)+ mRNA. Furthermore, the mutants gle2Δ and rip1Δ could not induce such an adaptation of the export of bulk poly(A)+ mRNA to heat shock. Our findings indicate that Gle2p plays a crucial role in mRNA export especially under heat-shocked conditions. Our findings also indicate that the nuclear pore complexes that Gle2p constitutes need to be stabilized for the adaptation and that the increased membrane integrity caused by treatment with mild heat stress or by survival in stationary phase is likely to contribute to the stabilization of the association between Gle2p and the nuclear pore complexes.

When exposed to various forms of stress, cells show adaptive responses such as changes in patterns of gene expression, in metabolism, and in other cellular processes. Adaptive response mechanisms aim to repair molecular damage and to protect cells against potentially adverse effects of stress, resulting in an increase in stress tolerance. Therefore, yeast cells pretreated with a comparatively mild and sublethal stress show increased resistance to subsequent lethal stress, since diverse adaptive responses are induced during the pretreatment (1Jamieson D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6678-6681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Izawa S. Inoue Y. Kimura A. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 3Piper P. Hohmann S. Mager W.H.

This phenomenon is termed adaptation. It is well known that the expression of heat shock proteins is induced during pretreatment with mild heat shock and contributes to an increased resistance to severe heat shock (3Piper P. Hohmann S. Mager W.H. Yeast Stress Response. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1997: 75-99Google Scholar, 4Cotto J.J. Morimoto R.I. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 105-118PubMed Google Scholar, 5Miller M.J.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1118-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Heat shock proteins play important roles in protecting other proteins against denaturation and in restoring their biological activities disrupted by stress (3Piper P. Hohmann S. Mager W.H. Yeast Stress Response. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1997: 75-99Google Scholar, 7Craig E.A. Gambill B.D. Nelson R.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 402-414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under stressed conditions, yeast cells undergo changes not only in transcriptional patterns but also in the types of mRNA that are nuclear exported in order to adapt rapidly to the stress. It is known that both heat shock and ethanol affect the export of mRNA. Under heat-shocked (42 °C) conditions, yeast cells shut down the synthesis of most proteins with the exception of stress-responsive proteins such as heat shock proteins. This effect is caused in part by selective mRNA export. Stress-induced transcripts such as SSA4 encoding one of the Hsp70 proteins are efficiently exported through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), 1The abbreviations used are: NPC, nuclear pore complex; hs mRNA, heat shock mRNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; BA, benzyl alcohol; DAPI, 4′,6-diaminidino-2-phenylindole. whereas bulk poly(A)+ mRNA accumulates in the nucleus under heat-shocked conditions (8Saaverda C. Tung K.S. Amberg D.C. Hopper A.K. Cole C.N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1608-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 9Krebber H. Taura T. Lee M.S. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1994-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, pretreatment of cells with a mild heat shock before a severe heat shock protects the mRNA export machinery and allows mRNA export to proceed unimpeded under subsequent severe heat-shocked conditions (10Tani T. Derby R.J. Hiraoka Y. Spector D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1515-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the shut-off of bulk poly (A)+ mRNA export under stressed conditions involves the dissociation of Npl3p, a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein, from mRNA (9Krebber H. Taura T. Lee M.S. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1994-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Additionally, the nucleoporin Rip1p/Nup42p was proposed to play an important role in the export of heat shock mRNA (hs mRNA) under heat-shocked conditions (11Saavedra C.A. Hammell C.M. Heath C.V. Cole C.N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2845-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 12Stutz F. Kantor J. Zhang D. McCarthy T. Neville M. Rosbash M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2857-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Initially, it was proposed that hs mRNA is exported through a specific pathway defined by the nucleoporin Rip1p/Nup42p (11Saavedra C.A. Hammell C.M. Heath C.V. Cole C.N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2845-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 12Stutz F. Kantor J. Zhang D. McCarthy T. Neville M. Rosbash M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2857-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, it has been recently reported that Rip1p also participates in the export of non-hs mRNA at 42 °C (13Vainberg I.E. Dower K. Rosbash M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3996-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). There is also a report that other general mRNA export factors are involved in the export of hs mRNA at elevated temperatures, suggesting that hs mRNA and non-hs mRNA are exported through similar pathways (13Vainberg I.E. Dower K. Rosbash M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3996-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Hurt E. Strässer K. Segref A. Bailer S. Schlaich N. Presutti C. Tollervey D. Jensen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8361-8368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The pathways of mRNA export under stressed conditions seem to be quite complex and still controversial. It is reasonable to imagine that changes in the processing of pre-mRNA would occur under stressed conditions, since the quality of mRNA affects competency for export (15Proudfoot N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 290-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Lei E.P. Silver P.A.

It has been reported that splicing is blocked following heat shock (19Vogel J.L. Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 306-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Appropriate processing steps such as splicing, 5′ capping, 3′ cleavage, and polyadenylation are necessary for the efficient nuclear export of mRNA (7Craig E.A. Gambill B.D. Nelson R.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 402-414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lei E.P. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2761-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Bentley D. Curr. Opin.

Biol. 2002; 22: 6441-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Both hyperadenylation and defects in polyadenylation of the 3′-end of mRNA cause the blocking of mRNA export and the apparent accumulation of pre-mRNA at the site of transcription (21Brodsky A.S. Silver P.A. RNA. 2000; 6: 1737-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 24Jensen T.H. Patricio K. McCarthy T. Rosbash M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Vice versa, several mutant strains defective in mRNA export also show hyperadenylation of the 3′-end of mRNA (25Hilleren P. Parker R. RNA. 2001; 7: 753-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Changes in pre-mRNA quality caused by processing factors may regulate the export competency of mRNA under conditions of stress. Another possibility is that mRNA export factors have an effect on selective mRNA export under stressed conditions. In S. cerevisiae, matured mRNA is exported as messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes by mRNA export factors including RNA-binding proteins (Mex67p, Sub2p, Yra1p, Yra2p, and Npl3p), nucleoporins and NPC-associated proteins (Gle1p, Gle2p, Mtr2p, Rip1p/Nup42p, and Rat7p/Nup159p), and DEAD box RNA helicase Rat8p/Dbp5p. Several reviews describe well the functions and interactions of yeast mRNA export factors (26Cole C.N. Fantes P. Begges J. The Yeast Nucleus. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 276-311Google Scholar, 27Zenklusen D. Stutz F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28Lei E.P. Silver P.A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 261-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It is still not clear how NPCs and mRNA export factors alter their functions in response to stress, except for the response of Npl3p and Hrp1p (9Krebber H. Taura T. Lee M.S. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1994-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 29Henry M.F. Mandel D. Routson V. Henry P.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3929-3941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is quite difficult at present to estimate the contribution of mRNA export factors to selective mRNA export. The stress responses of mRNA processing factors and export factors still remain to be clarified. In this study, we investigated the adaptive responses of mRNA export factors to heat shock. We found that most of the Gle2p dissociated from the NPCs and diffused into the cytoplasm under heat-shocked conditions, correlating well with the blocking of bulk poly(A)+ mRNA export. Gle2p associates with the nuclear pores through interaction with Rip1p (30Murphy R. Watkins J.L. Wente S.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1921-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and Nup116p (31Bailer S.M. Siniossoglou S. Podtelejnikov A. Helwig A. Mann M. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1107-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It has been reported that Gle2p plays a role in mRNA export in the NPCs (30Murphy R. Watkins J.L. Wente S.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1921-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, pretreatment with mild heat stress precluded the dissociation of Gle2p and the accumulation of mRNA in the nucleus under subsequent severe heat-shocked conditions. Stationary phase cells also exported bulk poly(A)+ mRNA without the dissociation of Gle2p under stressed conditions. Changes in the intracellular localization of Gle2p correlated closely with this adaptation of the export of bulk poly(A)+ mRNA. Here we suggest the possibility that Gle2p regulates the export of bulk poly(A)+ mRNA under conditions of stress through changes in its localization.

Cells were cultured in 50 ml of SD minimal medium (2% glucose and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, pH 5.5) with appropriate amino acids and bases at 28 °C with reciprocal shaking in 300-ml Erlenmeyer flasks. Exponential phase cells were prepared by culturing until an A610 of 0.5–0.7, and stationary phase cells were prepared by culturing for over 48 h. A medium supplemented with palmitic acid was prepared with 1% Niaproof 4 (tergitol) to solubilize the fatty acid (34Stukey J.E. McDonough V.M. Martin C.E. J. Biol.

The oligo(dT)50 probe was labeled at its 3′-end with digoxigenin using a DIG Oligonucleotide Tailing Kit (Roche Applied Science). In situ hybridization assays to detect poly(A)+ mRNA were performed as described previously (43Amberg D.C. Goldstein A.L. Cole C. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1173-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 44Long R.M. Elliott D.J. Stutz F. Rosbash M. Singer R.H. RNA. 1995; 1: 1071-1078PubMed Google Scholar). Cells pretreated at 37 °C and cells without pretreatment were collected and washed and then transferred to prewarmed fresh SD medium (42 °C). After incubation for 10 min at 42 °C, 10 μl of [35S]methionine/cysteine solution (Pro-mix [35S] in vitro cell labeling mix; Amersham Biosciences) was added per 10 ml of medium, and cells were labeled for 20 min at 42 °C. Subsequently, protein extract was prepared immediately by the method of Blomberg (45Blomberg A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 559-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Immobilized polyacrylamide gel dry strips (11 cm) with pH 4.0–7.0 gradients (Bio-Rad) were used for the first dimension separation. Soluble protein from whole-cell lysates was mixed with rehydration buffer (8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 115 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Bio-Lytes, and 0.001% bromphenol blue), and 250 μl of mixed solution (80 μg of protein/ml) was added to individual lanes of a rehydration tray (BioRad). The strips were allowed to rehydrate at 20 °C for 12 h. The samples were run at 250 V for 15 min, then the voltage was raised to 8000 V over a period of 3 h and kept at 8000 V for 4.5 h in a PROTEAN IEF Cell (Bio-Rad). Subsequently, the immobilized polyacrylamide gel strips were reequilibrated in equilibration buffer I (6 m urea, 2% SDS, 0.375 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 20% glycerol, and 130 mm dithiothreitol) for 15 min and in equilibration buffer II (6 m urea, 2% SDS, 0.375 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 20% glycerol, and 135 mm iodoacetamide) for 15 min at 20 °C. Following reequilibration, the strips were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 12.5% polyacrylamide gels. Yeast cells were converted to spheroplasts by incubation with 10 mg/ml Zymolyase 20T (Seikagaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer with 1.2 m sorbitol (pH 7.5). Cytoplasmic fraction and nuclei fraction were prepared from the spheroplasts by the method of Bécam et al. (46Bécam A.-M. Nasr F. Racki W.J. Zagulski M. Herbert C.J. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 266: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Each fraction (20 μg of protein) was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were electrically transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Nop1p and Ena1p were used as a nuclear protein marker and a cytoplasmic protein marker, respectively. Anti-Nop1p antibody and anti-Ena1p antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The secondary antibodies and anti-GFP antibody were purchased from Nacalai Tesque, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). Change in the Localization of Gle2p under Stressed Conditions—We first investigated the localization of mRNA export factors under heat-shocked conditions (42 °C) in exponential phase cells, using various GFP fusion proteins and immunofluorescence techniques. The intracellular localization of most of the export factors we investigated did not change. Rip1p and Nup116p remained at the nuclear envelope following heat shock (Fig. 1A). The distribution of other factors such as Rat7p, Rat8p, Yra1p, Yra2p, Gle1p, and Mtr2p did not change either (data not shown). However, the localization of Gle2p clearly changed under heat-shocked conditions. Gle2p is one of the constituents of NPCs, and Gle2p-GFP usually shows a fluorescent signal around the nuclear rim with a punctate pattern of expression (30Murphy R. Watkins J.L. Wente S.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1921-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), a finding we reconfirmed here (Fig. 1A). Although a certain amount of Gle2p-GFP still remained around the nuclear rim, most was dissociated from the nuclear envelope and moved into the cytoplasm under heat-shocked conditions (Fig. 1A). The dissociation of Gle2p from the nucleus was verified by cell fractionation experiments (Fig. 1B). Gle2p-GFP was detected by immunoblotting in the nuclei fraction but not in the cytoplasmic fraction of cells without stress treatment (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). However, in cells treated with heat shock at 42 °C, Gle2p-GFP was detected in both fractions (lanes 3 and 4). Compared with nonstressed cells, the level of Gle2p-GFP in the nuclei fraction was decreased in these cells (lanes 2 and 4). The localization of Gle2p was changed quickly (within 5 min) by the heat shock. We examined the levels of total Gle2p-GFP by Western blotting analysis using anti-GFP-antibody, but found no significant change under the conditions (data not shown). In the analysis in Fig. 1, the GLE2-GFP gene was integrated into the genomic DNA (33Bucci M. Wente S.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2439-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This strain (SWY1920) did not show the phenotypes of the gle2Δ mutant such as slow growth, indicating that this Gle2p-GFP was functional. We confirmed that Gle2p-GFP is functional using pKW-GLE2-GFP. A gle2Δ mutant (SWY1226) carrying pKW-GLE2-GFP recovered the growth rate, and Gle2p-GFP dissociated from the nuclear envelope in this mutant at 42 °C (data not shown). We next investigated the effects of other forms of stress. Ethanol stress (10%, v/v) as well as heat shock caused changes in the localization of Gle2p (Fig. 1A), although osmotic stress (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 7 and 8) and treatment with various drugs such as tunicamycin and diamide (data not shown) did not. The distribution of Rip1p-GFP and Nup116p-GFP did not change under conditions of ethanol stress (Fig. 1A). Ethanol stress also induced a rapid change in the localization of Gle2p-GFP (within 5 min). It is known that heat shock and 10% ethanol cause a blocking of the export of bulk poly(A)+ mRNA (8Saaverda C. Tung K.S. Amberg D.C. Hopper A.K. Cole C.N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1608-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 9Krebber H. Taura T. Lee M.S. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1994-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, we further investigated the concentration-dependent effects of ethanol on the changes in the localization of Gle2p and the export of bulk poly(A)+ mRNA. As shown in Fig. 2, 6% ethanol caused a partial dissociation of Gle2p-GFP from the nuclear envelope, and 9% ethanol caused the dissociation of most Gle2p-GFP, as did 10% ethanol. Corresponding to the dissociation of Gle2p-GFP, a partial accumulation of bulk poly(A)+ mRNA in the nucleus was observed with 6% ethanol, and a complete accumulation was seen with 9% ethanol. The minimum concentration of ethanol (6%) causing the accumulation of bulk poly(A)+ mRNA was consistent with the minimum concentration needed to cause the dissociation of Gle2p-GFP. The dissociation of Gle2p from the nuclear envelope correlated well with the blocking of the export of bulk poly(A)+ mRNA. It was reported that Gle2p plays a role in mRNA export in the NPCs (30Murphy R. Watkins J.L. Wente S.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1921-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It has been also reported that Gle2p requires physical association with Nup116p to function in vivo (31Bailer S.M. Siniossoglou S. Podtelejnikov A. Helwig A. Mann M. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1107-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems that the functional activities of Gle2p were decreased by the dissociation from the NPCs under heat-shocked and ethanol-stressed conditions. These results suggest that the dissociation of Gle2p is presumably one of the reasons for the blocking of the export of bulk poly(A)+ mRNA under heat-shocked conditions. Membrane Fluidity Affects the Localization of Gle2p—Next we investigated how the dissociation of Gle2p from the nuclear envelope was caused by heat shock. It is known that heat shock as well as ethanol increases the fluidity of the plasma membrane, followed by changes in the lipid composition of the membranes, including the saturation level and chain length of unsaturated fatty acids (47Alexandre H. Rousseaux I. Charpentier C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 124: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 48Swan T.M. Watson K. Can. J. Microbiol. 1999; 45: 472-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 49Örvar B.L. Sangwan V. Omann F. Dhindsa R.S. Plant J. 2000; 23: 785-794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is no information about the fluidity of the nuclear membrane. However, the same effects on the nuclear membrane can be expected for the following reasons: (i) the thermal gradient in each yeast cell seems to be negligible, and (ii) the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of ethanol in yeast cells are comparable, since the cells are permeated by ethanol (50Kunkee R.E. Bisson L.F. Rose A.H. Harrison J.S. The Yeast. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York1993: 39-127Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether membrane fluidity affects the localization of Gle2p. Benzyl alcohol (BA), commonly used as a membrane fluidizer, precludes any selective interaction with charged lipid species and fluidizes bilayer membranes (49Örvar B.L. Sangwan V. Omann F. Dhindsa R.S. Plant J. 2000; 23: 785-794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Zhang G.J. Liu H.W. Yang L. Zhong Y.G. Zheng Y.Z. J. Membrane Biol. 2000; 175: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 52Sangwan V. Örvar B.L. Beyerly J. Hirt H. Dhindsa R.S. Plant J. 2002; 31: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). We examined whether BA affects the localization of Gle2p in the same manner as heat shock and ethanol. Gle2p-GFP dissociated from the NPCs following the addition of BA (0.8%, v/v) as well as under heat-shocked and ethanol-stressed conditions (Fig. 3). Furthermore, treatment with 0.8% BA for 5 min also blocked the export of bulk poly(A)+ mRNA (Fig. 3). No change in the localization of Rip1p or Nup116p resulted from the treatment with BA (data not shown). We further investigated the concentration-dependent effects of BA on the changes in the localization of Gle2p and the export of bulk poly(A)+ mRNA. As shown in Fig. 3, 0.6% BA caused a partial dissociation of Gle2p-GFP from the nuclear envelope, and 0.7% BA caused the dissociation of more Gle2p-GFP than 0.6% BA. Corresponding to the dissociation of Gle2p-GFP, a partial accumulation of bulk poly(A)+ mRNA in the nucleus was observed with 0.6% BA and an almost complete accumulation with 0.7% BA (Fig. 3). In contrast to the effects of BA, palmitic acid enrichment is known to rigidify membranes. It has been reported that culture in a medium with palmitic acid resulted in a striking increase in the palmitic acid content of phospholipid fatty acids and that such palmitic acid-enriched cells show a decrease in membrane fluidity and an increase in membrane integrity (35Mizoguchi H. Hara S. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1996; 81: 406-411Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 36Mizoguchi H. Hara S. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1997; 83: 12-16Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We investigated the effects of membrane rigidification on the localization of Gle2p-GFP. The membrane rigidification caused by the enrichment of palmitic acid affected the localization of Gle2p under heat-shocked conditions (Fig. 4), although no effect of the enrichment of palmitic acid was observed under nonstressed conditions (data not shown). Palmitic acid-enriched cells showed a delay in the dissociation of Gle2p after the shift to heat-shocked conditions (Fig. 4). Gle2p-GFP remained around the nuclear envelope in the palmitic acid-enriched cells for a somewhat longer period (more than 15 min) at 42 °C and under 10% ethanol-stressed conditions (Fig. 4), whereas Gle2p-GFP rapidly dissociated in normal cells (within 5 min). In the palmitic acid-enriched cells, the export of bulk poly(A)+ mRNA was carried out even at 42 °C, whereas Gle2p-GFP remained around the nuclea"

Nudix pyrophosphatases are widely distributed in nature and share a highly conserved amino acid sequence motif called the “Nudix motif” (GX5EX7REUXEEXGU, where U is one of the bulky hydrophobic amino acids I, L, or V), which adopts a unique loop-helix-loop structure (1Bessman M.J.

Although certain proteins are posttranslationally modified by ADPR, high intracellular levels of ADPR could result in nonenzymatic ADP-ribosylation. This is a deleterious process that inactivates enzymes and could interfere with the recognition of enzymatic ADP-ribosylation (2Just I. Wollenberg P. Moss J. Aktories K. Eur. J.

The mechanism underlying the different substrate specificity and the metal dependence is unknown at both the structural and functional levels. Elucidation of these properties requires the study of ADPRases from numerous sources. In this article, we investigated the catalytic mechanism of ADPRase from an extreme thermophile, Thermus thermophilus HB8 (TtADPRase). In general, proteins isolated from T. thermophilus are heat-stable and suitable for physicochemical studies, including x-ray crystallography (8Yokoyama S. Hirota H. Kigawa T. Yabuki T. Shirouzu M.

Based on structural and functional analyses, we propose a novel reaction mechanism for ADPR pyrophosphate hydrolysis that is different from those proposed based on the ternary complex structures of ADPRases from Escherichia coli (EcADPRase) and from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtADPRase) (10Gabelli S.B.

Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1840-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). pT7Bluendx4 was digested with BamHI and HindIII, and the fragment was inserted into pKF19K (Takara Shuzo Co., Kyoto, Japan) digested with the same enzymes. Site-directed mutagenesis of E82Q, E86Q, and E129Q was performed according to the Mutan-Super Express Km kit instruction manual (Takara Shuzo). Site-directed mutagenesis of D126N, E127Q, and D128N was performed by replacement of the wild-type sequence in pT7Blue-ndx4 plasmid with each mutated fragment. E82Q mutant fragment was inserted into pET-3a, whereas the other mutant fragments were inserted into pET-11a. Overproduction and purification of mutant proteins were carried out in a similar manner to that for wild-type enzyme (12Yoshiba S. Nakagawa N. Masui R. Shibata T. Inoue Y. Yokoyama S. Kuramitsu S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1840-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—TtADPRase activities of wild-type, E82Q mutant, and E86Q mutant were analyzed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The reaction solution contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2 or 250 μm ZnSO4, 0.1 m KCl, 50 nm wild-type enzyme or 5.5 μm for E82Q and E86Q mutants, and various concentrations of ADPR. The 100-μl reaction mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 3 min for the wild-type or for 11 h for the E82Q and E86Q mutants. Reactions were stopped by the addition of an equivalent volume of 100 mm EDTA. The mixture was applied to a C18 column (CAPCELL PAK C18 MG column, Shiseido, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 5 mm tetrabutylammonium phosphate and 5% (v/v) methanol with AKTA explorer (Amersham Biosciences). The elution was performed at 1 ml min-1 with a 5-50% gradient of methanol in the equilibration buffer, and an absorbance at 260 nm was monitored. AMP and ADPR were eluted at elution volumes of 5 and 10 ml, respectively. The amounts of compounds were assessed from their peak areas. TtADPRase activities of wild-type, D126N, E127Q, D128N, and E129Q mutants were analyzed by measuring inorganic orthophosphate production using the colorimetric procedure of Ames and Dubin (13Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 100-μl reaction solution contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m KCl, 50 nmTtADPRase, 2 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, and various concentrations of ADPR. After incubation at 25 °C for 3 min, 75 μl of reaction mixture was mixed with 175 μl of the ascorbic-molybdate mixture and incubated at 45 °C for 20 min. Then, the quantity of phosphoric acid was measured at an absorbance of 820 nm. The kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the initial rate of product formation to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Crystallization—The method for crystallization and data collection of the free enzyme and the binary complex has been described previously (12Yoshiba S. Nakagawa N. Masui R. Shibata T. Inoue Y. Yokoyama S. Kuramitsu S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1840-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Overproduction of selenomethionyl (Se-Met) TtADPRase was performed as follows. E. coli B834(DE3) cells carrying the pET-11a-ndx4 plasmid were cultured in LB medium at 37 °C for a few hours. The preculture was incubated at a dilution ratio of 100:1 (v/v) into LeMaster medium containing Se-Met with lactose as a carbon source and cultured at 37 °C for 24 h. The Se-Met TtADPRase was purified in a manner similar to that for native protein (12Yoshiba S. Nakagawa N. Masui R. Shibata T. Inoue Y. Yokoyama S. Kuramitsu S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1840-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). All crystals, except the binary complex form, were obtained under the same condition as that of the free enzyme, with slight adjustments in pH or the concentration of ammonium sulfate, and the addition of metal, substrate, or product. Crystals were flash-cooled in a nitrogen stream, and data were collected under cryo conditions. Multiwavelength Anomalous Diffraction (MAD) Phasing, Model Building, and Refinement of the Free Enzyme—MAD data were collected at four wavelengths near the selenium absorption edge at the beamline BL44B2 at SPring-8 (14Adachi S. Oguchi T. Tanida H. Park S.-Y. Shimizu H. Miyatake H. Kamiya N. Shiro Y. Inoue Y. Ueki T. Iizuka T. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. 2001; A467/A468: 711-714Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Diffraction images were processed using the HKL2000 program (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The structure was determined by the MAD method using programs from the CCP4 suite (16Collaborative Computational Project No 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar) and data collected at four wavelengths (edge, high remote, low remote, and peak). The initial model was built with the aid of the amino acid sequence using the program O (17Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar), and refined from 15- to 2.5-Å resolution using the phase information from the diffraction data with the CNS program (18Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.N. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar). The three selenium atom sites deduced from the difference Fourier map coincided with the three sulfur sites of the methionine residues in the model. The N-terminal region was disordered, and the first Met was not detected. Progress in the structural refinement was evaluated at each stage by the free R factor and by inspection of stereochemical parameters calculated by the PROCHECK program (19Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The crystals of the ternary complex were obtained by mixing 1:1 the reservoir solution and the solution containing 2 mm protein, 2 mm ADPR, and 2 mm ZnCl2 or GdCl3. X-ray absorption fine structure measurement determined the Zn2+ absorption peak and low remote to be 1.282 and 1.287 Å, respectively, and the Gd3+ absorption peak and low remote to be 1.711 and 1.716 Å, respectively, at the beamline BL44B2 at SPring-8. Then, diffraction data of the ternary complex were collected at these wavelengths. Additionally, data of the Gd3+ ternary complex were also collected at the wavelength of 1.0 Å. The crystals that contained AMP were obtained by mixing 1:1 the reservoir solution and the solution containing 2 mm protein, 10 mm AMP, 2 mm ribose 5′-phosphate, and 2 mm MgCl2. The crystals that contained ribose 5′-phosphate were obtained by mixing 1:1 the reservoir solution and the solution containing 2 mm protein, 2 mm AMP, 2 mm ribose 5′-phosphate, and 2 mm ZnCl2. X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out in the laboratory using Cu Kα radiation. Data were collected with R-Axis VII (Rigaku) and were processed with Crystal-Clear 1.3.5 (Molecular Structure Corp., dxTREK version 8.OSSI). The structures were determined by molecular replacement with the AMoRe program (20Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar) using the free enzyme as starting model and refined by CNS, and the metal sites were located in anomalous difference Fourier maps. Data Collection and Refinement of Mutants E82Q and E86Q—Crystals of two mutant ternary complexes were produced by mixing 1:1 the reservoir solution and the solution containing 2 mm mutant protein, 2 mm ADPR, and 2 mm MgCl2 or ZnCl2. The x-ray diffraction experiments and data collections of the Mg2+ complexes were carried out in the laboratory in a manner similar to that for the product complex. To identify the Zn2+ positions, data for the E82Q ternary complex with Zn2+ were collected at the wavelengths corresponding to peak (1.282 Å) and remote (1.290 Å) at the beamline BL26B2 at SPring-8 (21Yamamoto M. Goto S. Takeshita K. Ishikawa T. SPring-8 Inf. 2001; 6: 202-206Google Scholar) and data for the E86Q ternary complex with Zn2+ were collected at the wavelengths corresponding to peak (1.278 Å) and remote (1.292 Å) at the beamline BL44B2 at SPring-8.

Open table in a new tab Structure diagrams were drawn using the MOLSCRIPT (22Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), BOB-SCRIPT (23Esnouf R.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 938-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar), and Raster3D programs (24Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar). In figures, atoms of α- and β-phosphate of ADPR are represented by letters A and B, not by α and β. The dimer structure of the Gd3+ ternary complex of TtADPRase is shown in Fig. 1A. The two identical monomers (one subunit is colored red and blue, and another subunit is colored pink and light blue) were related by a crystallographic 2-fold axis, which was consistent with the result of gel filtration chromatography (12Yoshiba S. Nakagawa N. Masui R. Shibata T. Inoue Y. Yokoyama S. Kuramitsu S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1840-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The structure of TtADPRase did not show large conformational change, regardless of whether it exists as the free enzyme, Zn2+-bound enzyme, binary complex with ADPR, ternary complexes with ADPR and Zn2+ or Gd3+, or product complexes with AMP or ribose 5′-phosphate. When the Cα atoms of these six structures were superimposed on the Gd3+ ternary complex structure, the average root mean square deviation values between the Gd3+ ternary complex structure and the other structures ranged from 0.20 to 0.26 Å. The subunit was divided into two distinctive structural domains (Fig. 1, A and B): an N-terminal domain (residues 1-34, colored red) and a C-terminal domain, which is also referred to as the Nudix domain (residues 35-170, colored blue). The N-terminal domain comprised anti-parallel β-sheet from β1to β3, and the Nudix domain was α + β fold, with mixed β-sheet of β4 to β9 surrounded by three α-helices of α1 to α3 (Fig. 1B). N-terminal residues (1-10) and residues (124-130) in loop L4 were disordered, but the presence of ADPR and metal resulted in order in loop L4. The Nudix motif (residues 67-89) folded into a loop-helix structure, not a loop-helix-loop structure, stabilized by an electrostatic network formed by salt links between Arg-81 and three Glu residues, Glu-73, Glu-82, and Glu-85. In general, thermophile proteins tend to have a short loop length, because flexibility of the loop reduces stability. Smaller loops, such as the loop-helix structure described above, are advantageous to TtADPRase. The TtADPRase structure of Gd3+ ternary complex was quite similar to those of the EcADPRase and MtADPRase (10Gabelli S.B. Bianchet M.A. Ohnishi Y. Ichikawa Y. Bessman M.J. Amezel L.M.

Structure. 2003; 11: 1015-1023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), although the detailed structures differed. N-terminal domain β-sheet was shorter, loop L4 was moved outward, and loop L5 tip was situated upward by 4 Å. TtADPRase has other properties that might contribute to stability, including a lower content of chemically unstable amino acids such as Asn, Cys, and Met (25Vieille C. Burdette D.S. Zeikus J.G. Biotechnol. Annu. Rev. 1996; 2: 1-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and a smaller surface area in the N-terminal domain than for EcADPRase and MtADPRase. The TtADPRase homodimer was stabilized by interactions in three regions. The first region contained an interface created between the N-terminal domains of both subunits, where the side chain of Thr-15 and the amide nitrogens of Arg-18 and Ile-19 made hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Glu-29 of another subunit. The second region contained an interface created between the N-terminal domain of one subunit and the Nudix domain of another subunit, where His-33 made a stacking interaction with Phe-105 of another subunit. The third region contained an interface created between the Nudix domains of both subunits, where Phe-97 made a stacking interaction with His-145 of another subunit, Ser-102 made a hydrogen bond with Glu-108 of another subunit, and Lys-109 made a salt bridge with Glu-151 of another subunit. The stereo structure and the scheme of hydrogen-bonding and stacking interaction between TtADPRase and ADPR are shown in Fig. 2 (A and B). The activity of TtADPRase was dependent on the presence of metal ions and was inhibited by acidic pH. ADPR was not hydrolyzed when crystals were prepared in solutions without metal ions for the binary complex with ADPR or prepared in an acidic pH for the ternary complex with ADPR and Zn2+ or Gd3+ (Table II). The binary complex without met"
https://openalex.org/W2007821406,"γ-Secretase is an intramembrane-cleaving aspartyl protease complex that mediates the final cleavage of β-amyloid precursor protein to liberate the neurotoxic amyloid-β peptide implicated in Alzheimer's disease. The four proteins presenilin (PS), nicastrin (NCT), APH-1, and PEN-2 are sufficient to reconstitute γ-secretase activity in yeast. Although PS seems to contribute the catalytic core of the γ-secretase complex, no distinct function could be attributed to the other components so far. In Caenorhabditis elegans, mutation of a glycine to an aspartic acid within a conserved GXXXG motif in the fourth transmembrane domain of APH-1 causes a loss of function phenotype. Surprisingly, we now found that the human homologue APH-1a carrying the equivalent mutation G122D is fully active in yeast co-expressing PS1, NCT, and PEN-2. To address this discrepancy, we expressed APH-1a G122D in HEK293 cells. As reported previously, overexpressed APH-1a G122D was not incorporated into the γ-secretase complex. Separate overexpression of PS1, NCT, or PEN-2 together with APH-1a G122D allowed the formation of heterodimers lacking the other endogenous components. Only the combined overexpression of PS1 and NCT together with APH-1a G122D facilitated the formation of a fully active γ-secretase complex. Under these conditions, APH-1a G122D supported the production of normal amounts of Aβ. We conclude that cooperative effects may stabilize a trim-eric complex of APH-1a G122D together with PS1 and NCT. Upon successful complex assembly, the GXXXG motif becomes dispensable for γ-secretase activity. γ-Secretase is an intramembrane-cleaving aspartyl protease complex that mediates the final cleavage of β-amyloid precursor protein to liberate the neurotoxic amyloid-β peptide implicated in Alzheimer's disease. The four proteins presenilin (PS), nicastrin (NCT), APH-1, and PEN-2 are sufficient to reconstitute γ-secretase activity in yeast. Although PS seems to contribute the catalytic core of the γ-secretase complex, no distinct function could be attributed to the other components so far. In Caenorhabditis elegans, mutation of a glycine to an aspartic acid within a conserved GXXXG motif in the fourth transmembrane domain of APH-1 causes a loss of function phenotype. Surprisingly, we now found that the human homologue APH-1a carrying the equivalent mutation G122D is fully active in yeast co-expressing PS1, NCT, and PEN-2. To address this discrepancy, we expressed APH-1a G122D in HEK293 cells. As reported previously, overexpressed APH-1a G122D was not incorporated into the γ-secretase complex.

Upon successful complex assembly, the GXXXG motif becomes dispensable for γ-secretase activity. Aggregated amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) 1The abbreviations used are: Aβ, amyloid β-peptide; APP, β-amyloid precursor protein; PS, presenilin; NCT, nicastrin, APH-1 anterior pharynx defective; PEN-2, presenilin enhancer 2; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type; CHAPSO, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. in cerebral plaques is a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, and soluble oligomeric Aβ disturbs synaptic function even before its deposition into plaques (1Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 298: 789-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3403) Google Scholar). Thus, Aβ is a critical player in Alzheimer's disease pathology and memory impairment. Aβ is generated from the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the consecutive cleavage of β- and γ-secretase in the APP ectodomain and in the middle of the transmembrane domain (2Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The aspartyl protease β-site APP-cleaving enzyme has been identified as the sole β-secretase in humans (3Vassar R. Citron M. Neuron. 2000; 27: 419-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have suggested that the polytopic membrane protein presenilin (PS) functions as γ-secretase. In the absence of both mammalian presenilin homologues PS1 and PS2, no Aβ is produced (4Herreman A. Serneels L. Annaert W. Collen D. Schoonjans L. De Strooper B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 461-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 5Zhang Z. Nadeau P. Song W. Donoviel D. Yuan M. Bernstein A. Yankner B.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 463-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutations in the PSs associated with familial Alzheimer's disease shift the ratio from the predominant 40-amino-acid Aβ species to the more aggregation-prone 42-amino-acid variant (2Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Furthermore, active site γ-secretase inhibitors can be cross-linked to PSs (6Li Y.M. Xu M. Lai M.T. Huang Q. Castro J.L. DiMuzio-Mower J. Harrison T. Lellis C. Nadin A. Neduvelil J.G. Register R.B. Sardana M.K. Shearman M.S. Smith A.L. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar), and mutagenesis of two highly conserved aspartyl residues suggests that PSs belong to a novel class of intramembrane-cleaving aspartyl proteases (7Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). Indeed, the C-terminal aspartyl residue is part of a conserved GXGD motif that is also contained in other polytopic aspartyl proteases including the signal peptide peptidase and its relatives (8Steiner H.

As for PSs, two homologues of APH-1 have been identified in mammals, APH-1a and APH-1b. PS forms a complex together with NCT, APH-1, and PEN-2 (14Takasugi N. Tomita T. Hayashi I. Tsuruoka M.

Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Furthermore, reconstitution of active γ-secretase in yeast was associated with endoproteolysis of PS1 into an N-terminal fragment and a C-terminal fragment, which together are believed to represent the principal cellular form of PS (18Thinakaran G.

So far, little is known about the distinct functions of the recently identified complex components NCT, APH-1, and PEN-2. Extensive cross-regulation of the expression level of the four complex components severely complicates a separate analysis of the individual components. Both genetic knock-out and RNA interference-mediated down-regulation of PS1, NCT, APH-1, and PEN-2 typically decrease the levels of the other components and prevent maturation of NCT (19Hu Y. Ye Y.

During complex assembly, NCT undergoes a conformational change that renders it resistant to trypsin digestion (29Shirotani K. Edbauer D. Capell A. Schmitz J. Steiner H. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16474-16477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). PEN-2 assembly has been implicated in initiating PS endoproteolysis because removal of PEN-2 leads to accumulation of unprocessed PS holoprotein, which is not observed upon knockdown of any other complex component (14Takasugi N.

Furthermore, PEN-2 is required to stabilize the N-terminal fragment/C-terminal fragment heterodimer within the γ-secretase complex (24Prokop S. Shirotani K. Edbauer D. Haass C. Steiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23255-23261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A loss of function allele of APH-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans has drawn the attention to a highly conserved GXXXG motif in the fourth transmembrane domain (12Goutte C. Tsunozaki M. Hale V.A.

Such motifs are known to mediate helix-helix interactions within transmembrane domains (32Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). A point mutation of the first glycine residue of the GXXXG motif in APH-1 was lethal in C. elegans (12Goutte C. Tsunozaki M. Hale V.A. Priess J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and disrupted γ-secretase complex formation of the human homologue APH-1a (31Lee S.F. Shah S. Yu C. Wigley W.C. Li H. Lim M.

We now reconstituted γ-secretase in yeast to further dissect the role of the conserved 122GXXXG126 in human APH-1a for γ-secretase complex assembly and activity. Surprisingly, we found that the mutation causing a loss of function in C. elegans was fully active when γ-secretase was reconstituted in yeast. Moreover, by overexpressing PS1 and NCT together with APH-1a G122D in human cells, we were able to fully rescue the loss of function APH-1 allele.

Antibody 6E10 against Aβ1–17 was obtained from Signet Laboratories (Dedham, MA). Antibodies against the NCT C terminus (N1660), the FLAG epitope (M2), and the HA epitope (polyclonal H6908, monoclonal HA-7 antibody, and HA-7 agarose) were obtained from Sigma. cDNA Constructs—The 265-amino-acid-long splice form (13Francis R.

For expression in yeast, the constructs were as described in Ref. 17Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar. Mutations were introduced by PCR mutagenesis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and as appropriate, 200 μg/ml G418 (to select for APP expression), 150 μg/ml hygromycin (for APH-1a-HA), 5 μg/ml blasticidin (for NCT), and 200 μg/ml zeocin (for PS1 selection). HEK293 cells stably expressing γ-secretase components were generated by transfection of HEK293/Sw cells stably expressing APP695 containing the Swedish mutation as in Ref. 20Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8666-8671Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar. For APH-1a, only low expressing clones were analyzed further to avoid aggregation of APH-1a. Moreover, clones expressing high amounts of APH-1a showed growth deficits after several passages. For transient transfection of cells stably expressing APH-1a-HA G122D, Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's instruction. Yeast Strains and Methods—Standard methods (35Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1995Google Scholar) were used for yeast culture, transformation with plasmids, protein extraction, and β-galactosidase assay. A yeast strain identical to the previously described DEY1 but lacking the mutation V717I in the APP domain of C1–55-GAL4 was used to express PS1, NCT, APH-1a-HA (WT, G122A, or G122D), and FLAG-PEN-2 as described (17Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation and in Vitro γ-Secretase Assay—Co-immunoprecipitations and subsequent γ-secretase assays with recombinant C100-His6 substrate were performed from membrane fractions lysed in 1% CHAPSO as described (17Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). After the assay, the samples were briefly solubilized in 0.5% SDS, diluted to 0.1% SDS, and immunoprecipitated with anti-Aβ antibody 3926 because CHAPSO disturbed the separation of Aβ40 and Aβ42 on Tris-Bicine-urea gels (36Wiltfang J. Smirnov A. Schnierstein B. Kelemen G. Matthies U. Klafki H.W. Staufenbiel M. Huther G. Ruther E. Kornhuber J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To analyze the role of the conserved 122GXXXG126-motif in APH-1a for γ-secretase complex assembly and activity in the absence of endogenous APH-1, we used S. cerevisiae, which allows reconstitution of γ-secretase activity upon expression of APH-1a WT together with PS1, NCT, and PEN-2 (17Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). To monitor γ-secretase activity, we used the APP-based reporter substrate C1–55-GAL4 (17Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Upon γ-secretase cleavage, the membrane-tethered transcriptional activator GAL4 is liberated and activates LacZ transcription via the GAL1 promotor. Consistent with previous results (17Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 31Lee S.F. Shah S. Yu C. Wigley W.C. Li H. Lim M. Pedersen K. Han W. Thomas P. Lundkvist J. Hao Y.H. Yu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4144-4152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), both APH-1a WT and G122A were active in the γ-secretase reporter assay in yeast (Fig. 1A, upper panel). Surprisingly, the loss of function mutation G122D, which was lethal in C. elegans (12Goutte C. Tsunozaki M. Hale V.A. Priess J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), allowed robust γ-secretase activity in yeast (Fig. 1A, upper panel). Consistent with that finding, APH-1a G122D also facilitated endoproteolysis of PS1 similar to APH-1a WT and G122A (Fig. 1A). In contrast, no γ-secretase activity and PS1 endoproteolysis were detectable upon co-expression of inactive PS1 D385A as expected (7Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar, 17Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). To investigate this surprising finding on a biochemical level, we stably expressed HA-tagged APH-1a WT and G122D in HEK293 cells. We performed co-immunoprecipitation studies with antibody 3027 against the PS1-C-terminal fragment and an anti-HA antibody against HA epitope-tagged APH-1a. The PS1 antibody co-immunoprecipitated APH-1a HA WT, together with endogenous PS1 N-terminal fragment, NCT, and PEN-2 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, overexpressed APH-1a G122D was not co-immunoprecipitated with PS1 (Fig. 1B). Similarly, anti-HA immunoprecipitation of APH-1a WT did co-precipitate endogenous PS1, NCT, and PEN-2, whereas APH-1a G122D did not interact with endogenous γ-secretase components (Fig. 1B) as reported previously (21Lee S.F. Shah S. Li H. Yu C. Han W. Yu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45013-45019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 31Lee S.F. Shah S. Yu C. Wigley W.C. Li H. Lim M. Pedersen K. Han W. Thomas P. Lundkvist J. Hao Y.H. Yu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4144-4152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This suggests that APH1a G122D cannot compete with endogenous APH-1a for the other complex components present in HEK293 cells at endogenous levels. Thus, the GXXXG motif in APH-1 may be required for γ-secretase complex assembly by mediating the interaction with one or more other γ-secretase components, as suggested previously (31Lee S.F. Shah S. Yu C. Wigley W.C. Li H. Lim M. Pedersen K. Han W. Thomas P. Lundkvist J. Hao Y.H. Yu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4144-4152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In yeast, all γ-secretase components were expressed at fairly high levels, which might overcome a weaker binding affinity of APH-1a G122D to other complex components. We therefore expressed APH-1a G122D in all double and triple combinations with PS1, NCT, and PEN-2 in HEK293 cells to analyze whether excess amounts of other γ-secretase components would facilitate the incorporation of APH-1a G122D into a functional γ-secretase complex as observed when expressed in yeast. In addition, this approach might also reveal which protein-protein interaction requires the GXXXG motif. We transiently transfected the cell line stably expressing APH-1a-HA G122D additionally with PS1, NCT, and PEN-2 and combinations thereof (Fig. 2). By anti-HA immunoprecipitation, we analyzed whether APH-1a-HA G122D formed a stable complex with PS1, NCT, and PEN-2 (Fig. 2). Indeed, excess amounts of PS1 holoprotein (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 9), immature NCT (lanes 3 and 10), and PEN-2 (lanes 4 and 11) allowed the interaction with APH-1a G122D. Thus, GXXXG-independent interactions can occur between APH-1a and PS1, NCT, and PEN-2. However, overexpression of APH-1a G122D with only one additional component did not facilitate the full assembly of a γ-secretase complex containing APH-1a G122D with the remaining γ-secretase components present at endogenous levels. In accordance with that finding, APH-1a G122D almost exclusively bound to unprocessed PS1 holoprotein and immature NCT, respectively (lanes 9–11). In contrast, when overexpressed together with PS1 and NCT, the mutant APH-1a G122D associated with large amounts of PS1 endoproteolytic fragments and mature NCT and also with endogenous PEN-2 (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 12). Therefore, excess amounts of PS1 and NCT fully rescued the complex assembly defect in APH-1a G122D. In contrast, overexpression of APH-1a G122D in the other triple combinations (Fig. 2, compare lanes 6 and 13 and lanes 7 and 14, respectively) was not sufficient to rescue complex assembly of APH-1a G122D. This may support a model of ordered assembly of γ-secretase components. Interestingly, such a trimeric complex of PS1, NCT, and APH-1a has been proposed as the final intermediate during γ-secretase complex assembly before PEN-2 binding initiates endoproteolysis of PS1 (14Takasugi N. Tomita T. Hayashi I. Tsuruoka M. Niimura M. Takahashi Y. Thinakaran G. Iwatsubo T. Nature. 2003; 422: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). The fact that excess PS1 and NCT are necessary to allow the complex incorporation of APH-1a G122D indicates that the GXXXG motif is required for stabilizing such a putative trimeric complex of PS1, NCT, and APH-1a. Most likely, the direct interaction of PS1 and NCT is able to stabilize such a trimer as long as PS1 and NCT are in excess. Upon full assembly through the binding of PEN-2, the complex containing APH-1a G122D may be further stabilized through additional interactions via cooperative binding among the components. Reconstitution of γ-secretase activity in yeast with APH-1a G122D suggests that the GXXXG motif is not required for proteolytic activity once APH-1a is incorporated into the γ-secretase complex. To recapitulate this in mammalian cells, we analyzed γ-secretase function in a cell-free assay using recombinant C100-His6 substrate (17Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). We used transient transfection to overexpress all combinations of PS1, NCT, and PEN-2 together with APH-1a G122D (as in Fig. 2). As expected, APH-1a G122D immunoprecipitated from HEK293 cells stably overexpressing mutant APH-1a alone is not associated with γ-secretase activity (Fig. 3A). Only upon co-transfection of both PS1 and NCT was the defective Aβ production of APH-1a G122D restored. In contrast, all other combinations of γ-secretase components failed to recruit APH-1a G122D into an active γ-secretase complex. Apparently, only the combined overexpression of PS1 and NCT overcomes the deficient complex assembly of APH-1a G122D and restores γ-secretase activity. For further analysis, we generated stable HEK293 cell lines co-expressing PS1 and NCT with either APH-1a WT or G122D. Without additional overexpression of PS1 and NCT, only APH-1a WT was associated with γ-secretase activity (Fig. 3B). In contrast, when stably overexpressed together with PS1 and NCT, both APH-1a WT and G122D interacted with PS1, NCT, and PEN-2 (compare Fig. 2) and generated similar amounts of Aβ from the recombinant substrate. This is genuine γ-secretase activity since Aβ production was fully blocked by L-685,458, a γ-secretase inhibitor known to directly interact with PSs (6Li Y.M. Xu M. Lai M.T. Huang Q. Castro J.L. DiMuzio-Mower J. Harrison T. Lellis C. Nadin A. Neduvelil J.G. Register R.B. Sardana M.K. Shearman M.S. Smith A.L. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). The increased Aβ production in triple-transfected cells results from increased levels of APH-1a and enhanced amounts of mature γ-secretase complexes (data not shown) (14Takasugi N. Tomita T.

We next used a Tris-Bicine-urea gel system (36Wiltfang J. Smirnov A. Schnierstein B. Kelemen G. Matthies U. Klafki H.W. Staufenbiel M. Huther G. Ruther E. Kornhuber J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) that allows the specific identification of Aβ40 and Aβ42 to analyze the Aβ species produced in vitro from active γ-secretase containing APH-1a G122D. The ratio of Aβ40 and Aβ42 was largely unaffected in the APH-1a mutant (Fig. 3C). This shows that the mature γ-secretase complex no longer vitally depends on the GXXXG motif for its stabilization. Once the assembly defect of APH-1a G122D is overcome, it allows Aβ production in amounts very similar to APH-1 WT. The mutation G122D does not affect the ratio of Aβ40/Aβ42in vitro, suggesting that glycine 122 is only required during γ-secretase complex assembly but is not directly required for the proteolytic function of γ-secretase. Taken together, we demonstrate that the combined overexpression of PS1 and NCT with the loss of function APH-1a G122D mutant fully restores γ-secretase complex assembly and activity. A similar rescue of inactive APH-1 G122D was not observed upon transfection of other combinations of PS1, NCT, and PEN-2, supporting a putative trimeric complex containing APH-1, PS1, and NCT as an intermediate during ordered complex assembly (14Takasugi N.

Most likely, the GXXXG motif in APH-1 facilitates the interaction of APH-1 with PS1 or NCT or both PS1 and NCT. Strikingly, PS1 contains a well conserved 378GXXXG382 motif, which may mediate the interaction with APH-1, although most GXXXG motifs analyzed so far mediate homodimerization (32Russ W.P.

Interestingly, the signal peptide peptidase, which does not require additional components (9Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), shares the GXGD active site motif with PSs but lacks this GXXXG motif (9Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Up to now, APH-1a G122D is the only loss of function allele in a γ-secretase component that can be rescued by overexpression of other γ-secretase components. We thank A. Capell, K. Shirotani, A.

Lys-238 and Tyr-123 or a water molecule located on the si and re face of the cofactor, respectively, have been proposed to act as the acid/base catalysts in the proton abstraction/donation at Cα/C4′ of the external aldimine. In this investigation, two site-directed mutants, K238A and Y123F, have been characterized. The Lys → Ala mutation results in the complete loss of either lyase activity or racemase activity in both directions or transaminase activity toward l-alanine. However, the K238A mutant is able to catalyze the overall transamination of d-alanine, and only d-alanine is the product of the reverse transamination. For Y123F the kcat/Km is reduced 3.5-fold for α, β-elimination, whereas it is reduced 300–400-fold for racemization. Y123F has ∼18% of wild type transaminase activity with l-alanine and an extremely low transaminase activity with d-alanine. Moreover, the catalytic properties of the Y124F and Y123F/Y124F mutants rule out the possibility that the residual racemase and transaminase activities displayed by Y123F are due to Tyr-124. All these data, together with computational results, indicate a two-base racemization mechanism for cystalysin in which Lys-238 has been unequivocally identified as the catalyst acting on the si face of the cofactor.

Treponema denticola cystalysin catalyzes the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) 1The abbreviations used are: PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; PMP, pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate.1The abbreviations used are: PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; PMP, pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate.-dependent α,β-elimination of l-cysteine to generate pyruvate, ammonia, and H2S (1Chu L. Ebersole J.L. Kurzban G.P. Holt S.C. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3231-3238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that several sulfur- and non-sulfur-containing amino acids as well as disulfidic amino acids also serve as substrates for this reaction (2Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Clausen T. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9153-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The protein is composed of two identical subunits, each of which comprises 399 amino acid residues. The three-dimensional structure of the enzyme has been solved to 1.9 Å (3Krupka H.L. Huber R. Holt S.C. Clausen T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3168-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The PLP cofactor in the active site forms a Schiff base with the ϵ-amino group of Lys-238 of cystalysin (3Krupka H.L. Huber R. Holt S.C. Clausen T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3168-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Through site-directed mutagenesis, spectroscopic, and kinetic studies, we have shown recently that Lys-238 is an essential residue for α,β-elimination catalyzed by the enzyme cystalysin. In addition to strengthening the coenzyme binding and facilitating transimination, this residue seems to participate as a general base abstracting the Cα proton from the substrate and possibly as a general acid, protonating the β-leaving group (4Bertoldi M. Cellini B. D'Aguanno S. Borri Voltattorni C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37336-37343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).In a recent paper we have shown that, in addition to the lyase activity, the enzyme exhibits an alanine racemase activity accompanied by an overall transaminase activity toward both enantiomers of alanine (5Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Paiardini A. Di Salvo M. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Considering that racemization is a side reaction of cystalysin, it occurs with a significant kcat (∼1 s–1), even if it is ∼1000-fold lower than that of alanine racemase (6Sun S. Toney M.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4058-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The structure of cystalysin with aminoethoxyvinylglycine has revealed that Lys-238 and Tyr-123, located on the si and re face of the cofactor, respectively, are structurally well positioned to be general acid/base catalysts in a two-base racemization mechanism (3Krupka H.L. Huber R. Holt S.C. Clausen T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3168-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A similar active site architecture has been reported for the crystal structure of alanine racemase from Bacillus stearothermophilus with an alanine phosphonate in which PLP is bound such that Tyr-265′ faces the si side of the cofactor and Lys-39 the re side (7Stamper G.F. Morollo A.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10438-10445Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For alanine racemase a two-base racemization mechanism involving Tyr-265′ and Lys-39 has been demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis studies (8Watanabe A. Yoshimura T. Mikami B. Esaki N. J. Biochem. 1999; 126: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Watanabe A. Kurokava Y. Yoshimura T. Kurihara T. Soda K. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4189-4194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). On the basis of structural and kinetic data of cystalysin, we have proposed that racemization occurs by a two-base mechanism. Lys-238 and Tyr-123 have been suggested as possible candidates for general acid-base catalysis, even though the possibility has not been excluded that the crystallographic water molecule located on the re side could serve as the acid/base catalyst (5Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Paiardini A. Di Salvo M. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). According to the generally accepted mechanism as well as on the basis of our studies, alanine racemase reaction is proposed to proceed in the following manner as shown in Scheme 1: (i) transaldimination between Lys-238 bound with PLP (I) and the α-amino group of alanine to produce an external aldimine II; (ii) abstraction of the α-hydrogen from alanine to produce a resonance-stabilized quinonoid intermediate III; (iii) reprotonation at the α-carbon of the quinonoid intermediate III on the side opposite to that where the α-hydrogen was abstracted; and (iv) the second transaldimination between IV and Lys-238 to release the product enantiomer of alanine. An equivalent route can be delineated for d-alanine. The transamination catalyzed by cystalysin is probably attained through the sequences I → II → III → VI or V → IV → III → VI for l-and d-alanine, respectively.As a first step in testing the hypothetical function of Lys-238 and Tyr-123 in the catalysis of cystalysin, the enzymatic activities of the K238A and Y123F mutants were determined. The results provide evidence in support of our previously proposal (5Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Paiardini A. Di Salvo M. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) of a two-base racemization mechanism of both of the enantiomers of alanine. However, only the PLP binding lysine, Lys-238, has been unequivocally identified as the catalyst acting on the si face of the cofactor. In fact, the Y123F mutant exhibits poor racemase and transaminase activities. A previous modeling study of the binding modes of the enantiomers of alanine to wild-type cystalysin has indicated that Tyr-124 is too far from the α-hydrogen of the substrate (4.1 Å) for the α-proton abstraction (5Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Paiardini A. Di Salvo M. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, it cannot be excluded that the geometry of the active site could be altered upon replacement of Tyr-123 by phenylalanine. Thus, the possibility that the catalytic function of Tyr-123 could be replaced by Tyr-124 has been addressed by the spectroscopic and kinetic characterization of the Y124F and Y123F/Y124F mutants. These studies show that Tyr-124 cannot replace Tyr-123. Therefore, the role of Tyr-123 and/or water molecules in performing the proton abstraction/donation function on the re face of the cofactor is discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—PLP, pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP), β-chloro-l-alanine, l- and d-alanine, NAD+, NADH, pyruvate, rabbit muscle l-lactic dehydrogenase, alanine dehydrogenase in 50% glycerol, d-amino acid oxidase, and isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside were from Sigma. All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available.Site-directed Mutagenesis—All mutant forms of cystalysin were made on the wild-type construct pUC18:hly (10Chu L. Burgum A. Kolodrubetz D. Holt S.C. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4448-4455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the Quik-Change™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The kit employs double-stranded DNA as the template, two complementary oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation, and DpnI endonuclease to digest the parental DNA template. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by MWG-Biotech AG (Anzinger, Germany). The Y123F and Y124F mutants and the double mutant (Y123F/Y124F) of cystalysin were produced using as primers 5′-CATTATCATCACACCGGTTTTTTATCCTTTCTTTAT-3′, 5′-CATTATCATCACACCGGTTTATTTTCCTTTCTTTATGGC-3′, 5′-CATTATCATCACACCGGTTTTTTTTCCTTTCTTTAT-3′, and their complementary oligonucleotides, respectively. The mutated bases are underlined.The coding regions of the mutated hly gene were sequenced to confirm the mutations. Escherichia coli strain DH5α cells were transformed and used for expression.Expression and Purification of Mutant Cystalysin—The conditions used for expression of the mutant proteins in E. coli were as described for the wild-type enzyme (2Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Clausen T. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9153-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant forms of cystalysin were purified to homogeneity with the procedure described previously (4Bertoldi M. Cellini B. D'Aguanno S. Borri Voltattorni C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37336-37343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The K238A mutant was obtained as reported previously (4Bertoldi M. Cellini B. D'Aguanno S. Borri Voltattorni C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37336-37343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The protein concentration in all cystalysin samples was determined by absorbance spectroscopy using a previously determined extinction coefficient of 1.27 × 105m–1 cm–1 at 280 nm (2Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Clausen T. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9153-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The PLP content of wild-type and mutant enzymes was determined by releasing the coenzyme in 0.1 m NaOH and by using ϵ = 6600 m–1 cm–1 at 388 nm (11Peterson E.A. Sober H.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954; 76: 169-175Crossref Scopus (307) Google Scholar).Enzyme Activity Assays—The α,β-eliminase activity of cystalysin was measured by the spectrophotometric assay coupled with lactate dehydrogenase as described previously (2Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Clausen T. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9153-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The conversion of alanine in the l → d or d → l direction was measured using d-amino acid oxidase and lactate dehydrogenase or l-alanine dehydrogenase as the coupling enzymes, respectively, as reported previously (5Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Paiardini A. Di Salvo M. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The detection and quantification of PLP and PMP content were performed using the high pressure liquid chromatography procedure described previously (12Bertoldi M. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To determine the kinetic parameters of the catalytic activities, the assays were performed as indicated above using a fixed amount of enzyme, whereas the substrate concentration was varied from 0.02 to 10 mm and from 0.15 to 500 mm for eliminase and racemase or transaminase activities, respectively. The experimental data were fit into the Michaelis-Menten equation to determine Km and kcat values.Binding Affinity of the Y123F, Y124F, and Y123F/Y124F Mutants for the PLP Cofactor—The apparent equilibrium constant for the dissociation of PLP from Y123F, Y124F, and Y123F/Y124F was determined by measuring the α,β-eliminase activity of the apoenzymes (0.6 μm) in the presence of PLP ranging from 0.01 to 9 μm. The Kd value of the enzyme-coenzyme complex was obtained using a tight binding hypothesis according to Equation 1, shown below,Y=Ymax[E]t+[PLP]t+Kd−([E]t+[PLP]t+Kd)2−4[E]t[PLP]t2[E]t(Eq. 1) where [E]t and [PLP]t represent the total concentrations of the cystalysin mutant dimer and PLP, respectively, Y refers to the enzymatic activity change at various PLP concentrations, and Ymax refers to the enzymatic activity when all enzyme molecules are complexed with a coenzyme.Molecular Modeling—The BUILDER package from Insight II (version 2000; MSI, Los Angeles, CA) was used to model the d-alanine-PLP and l-alanine-PLP conjugates, using the PLP-serine complex present in the crystal structure of serine hydroxymethyltransferase from B. stearothermophilus (13Trivedi V. Gupta A. Jala V.R. Saravanan P. Rao G.S.J. Rao N.A. Savithri H.S. Subramanja H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17161-17169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) as template. Tyr-123 and Tyr-124 from the crystal structure of cystalysin (Protein Data Bank code 1C7O) in its dimeric form were then mutated to phenylalanine to obtain the single Y123F and the double Y123F/Y124F mutants using the BIOPOLYMER package from Insight II. Both complexes were positioned into the modified active sites following the binding mode of aminoethoxyvinylglycine (3Krupka H.L. Huber R. Holt S.C. Clausen T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3168-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).All minimizations were carried out using the Cff91 force field as implemented in Discover 2.9 and the Analysis package of Insight II. Active site solvent molecules, as present in the crystal structure, were considered. Non-bond terms were truncated at 40 Å (smoothing from 36 Å) with a switching function for van der Waals and electrostatic terms. Because the other water molecules were not explicitly included, a distance-dependent dielectric was used throughout the minimizations. The minimization protocol is described elsewhere (2Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Clausen T. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9153-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, after an initial minimization performed on the whole system to allow added hydrogens to adjust to the crystallographically defined environment, a gradually decreasing tethering force using the steepest descents and conjugated gradients was applied to the whole system until the system was totally relaxed. The maximum derivative achieved was 0.0001 kcal·mol–1 Å–1. Only the PLP-Ala complex and main chain and side chains of each residue within 20 Å from the external aldimine were free to move.Spectral Measurements—Absorption measurements were made with a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer. The enzyme solution was drawn through a 0.2-μm filter to reduce light scattering from a small amount of precipitate. Fluorescence spectra were taken with a FP-750 Jasco spectrofluorometer using 5-nm excitation and emission bandwidths at a protein concentration varying from 0.9 to 2.2 μm. Spectra of blanks, i.e. of samples containing all components except cystalysin, were taken immediately before the measurements of samples containing protein. The blank spectra were subtracted from the spectra containing the enzyme. CD spectra were obtained using a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter with a thermostatically controlled compartment at 25 °C. For near-UV and visible wavelengths the protein concentration varied from 0.6 to 1 mg/ml in a cuvette with a 1-cm path length. Routinely, four spectra were recorded at a scan speed of 50 nm/min with a bandwidth of 2 nm and were averaged automatically except where indicated. For far-UV measurements the protein concentration was 0.1 mg/ml with a 0.1-cm path length.Curve Fitting analysis—All data analysis for determining the model-derived kinetic parameters was performed by nonlinear curve fitting using MicroCal Origin 3.01 (MicroCal Software, Inc., Northamton, MA).RESULTSWe used site-directed mutagenesis to prepare several variants of cystalysin with single and double replacements at putative active site residues. The purified variants were homogeneous as indicated by a single band on SDS-PAGE with a mobility identical to that of the corresponding wild-type protein. Yields of the mutant enzymes after the standard purification were ∼ 70% with respect to that of the corresponding wild-type enzyme. The effects of amino acid substitution on the catalytic properties were determined to evaluate the function of these residues and gain insight into the mechanism of catalysis. Because the reactions catalyzed by cystalysin proceed through chromophoric intermediates formed between PLP and ligands, we have also examined the effects of amino acid replacement on the spectra of enzyme-ligand intermediates.To test the structural integrity of the cystalysin mutants, we measured their circular dichroism spectra in the far-UV region. No differences have been observed between the spectra of the mutated and the wild-type forms of cystalysin, which indicates that the mutations do not affect the overall secondary structure of cystalysin (data not shown).Spectroscopic Properties of Tyr-123 and Tyr-124 Mutants— As with wild-type, the Y123F, Y124F, and Y123F/Y124F variants bind 2 mol of PLP per dimer. In contrast, apo K238A reconstituted with PLP binds 1 mol of coenzyme per dimer, as reported previously (4Bertoldi M. Cellini B. D'Aguanno S. Borri Voltattorni C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37336-37343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, the absorbance and CD spectra of Tyr-123 and Tyr-124 mutants in the UV-visible region are largely similar to those of the wild-type enzyme. The wild-type, Y123F, Y124F, and Y123F/Y124F mutant enzymes display optical activity (millidegrees per absorbance unit) values of 70, 79, 70, and 61 millidegrees/A418, respectively. This suggests that the microenvironment of the internal aldimine in the Tyr-123 mutant enzymes is slightly different from that in the wild-type enzyme. For comparison, the absorbance and CD spectra of the apo K238A reconstituted with PLP reported previously (4Bertoldi M. Cellini B. D'Aguanno S. Borri Voltattorni C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37336-37343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) are also included in Fig. 1, A and B, respectively. The fluorescence of Tyr-123 and Tyr-124 mutants is similar to that of the wild-type. It is of interest that the intensity of the PLP emission fluorescence (excitation at 418 nm) of the Y123F and Y123F/Y124F mutants is 10-fold higher than that of the wild-type cystalysin (data not shown).Fig. 1Absorbance and CD spectra of wild-type and mutants of cystalysin.

Although as reported previously (4Bertoldi M. Cellini B. D'Aguanno S. Borri Voltattorni C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37336-37343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) the K238A mutant is inactive in the α,β-elimination of β-chloro-l-alanine, Y123F, Y124F, and Y123F/Y124F mutants display, to varying extents, significant eliminase activity. A summary of the resulting steady-state parameters obtained for the α,β-elimination reaction toward β-chloro-l-alanine is listed in Table I. For both Y123F and Y123F/Y124F mutants, the Km values were ∼10-fold lower with respect to those of the wild-type. Furthermore, the observed kcat values decreased by 25- and 40-fold for Y123F and Y123F/Y124F, respectively, compared with those of the wild-type enzyme, resulting in a ∼ 3.5-fold reduction of the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). As seen in Table I, a slight increase was observed in the Km and kcat values for Y124F, leading to a 50% reduction of the catalytic efficiency with respect to wild-type. The results indicate that, unlike the Lys-238 residue, the Tyr-123 and Tyr-124 residues are not critical for the α,β-eliminase activity catalyzed by cystalysin.Table ISteady-state kinetic parameters for α,β -elimination of β -chloro-l-alanine in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 25 °CkcatKmkcat/Kms-1mmmm-1 s-1Wild-typeaFrom Ref. 2.59.9 ± 2.31.21 ± 0.1549.5 ± 6.4K238AbFrom Ref. 4.Y123F2.41 ± 0.080.17 ± 0.0314.2 ± 2.5Y124F74 ± 23.2 ± 0.2023.1 ± 1.6Y123F/Y124F1.44 ± 0.040.10 ± 0.0214.4 ± 2.9a From Ref. 2Bertoldi M.

Open table in a new tab The kinetic parameters determined for alanine racemase activity reveal that, although alteration of Lys-238 causes a complete loss of racemase activity, the mutation of Tyr-123 results in a 200-fold reduction of kcat. These effects are similar of those observed for the primary reaction with the K238A variant but are significantly more than those observed for the primary reaction with the Y123F variant, where only a 25-fold decrease in kcat is produced. On the contrary, the kinetic parameters for alanine racemase activity are not significantly altered in the Y124F mutant, analogous to what was observed for the α,β-elimination reaction. For the Y123F/Y124F variant the Km values and the kcat for l-and d-alanine were ∼ 10- and 200-fold lower, respectively, with respect to the corresponding values for wild-type (Table II).Table IISteady-state kinetic parameters for racemization of l- and d-alanine in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 25 °CkcatKmkcat/Kml-Alad-Alal-Alad-Alal-Alad-Alas-1mmmm-1 s-1Wild-type1.05 ± 0.031.4 ± 0.110 ± 110 ± 10.10 ± 0.010.14 ± 0.02K238AN.D.aN.D., not detectable.N.D.aN.D., not detectable.Y123F0.0058 ± 0.00020.0069 ± 0.000314.3 ± 1.822.4 ± 3.64 × 10-4 ± 5 × 10-53 × 10-4 ± 5 × 10-5Y124F1.96 ± 0.083.16 ± 0.0320 ± 325.3 ± 0.70.1 ± 0.010.125 ± 0.004Y123F/Y124F0.0047 ± 0.00020.0042 ± 0.00011 ± 0.20.76 ± 0.080.0047 ± 0.00090.0056 ± 0.0006a N.D., not detectable. Open table in a new tab Each Lys-238, Tyr-123, and Tyr-124 variant was also screened for the ability to catalyze the transamination of l- and d-alanine. Y124F mutant catalyzes transamination of l- and d-alanine with kcat values of 0.0177 ± 0.0003 and 0.0035 ± 0.0004 min–1, respectively, about half the value corresponding to wild-type (5Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Paiardini A. Di Salvo M. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Both Y123F and Y123F/Y124F mutants catalyze the transamination of l-alanine with kcat values 5- and 10-fold lower, respectively, than that of wild-type. On the other hand, under conditions of relatively high enzyme concentration (30 μm), normally saturating substrate concentrations (500 mm), and extensive time courses (2 h), the reaction of these mutants with d-alanine produces 0.51 μm PMP. Considering that under these conditions l-alanine is produced in amounts less than 0.1 Km, it can be assessed that most of the PMP produced is due to the transamination of d-alanine rather than the transamination of l-alanine formed by racemization of d-alanine. It is noteworthy that the K238A mutant does not show detectable transaminase activity toward l-alanine, whereas it is able to catalyze the transamination of d-alanine. Initial velocity data for this reaction were fitted to Michaelis-Menten equation and yielded the kinetic parameters Km = 24.5 ± 3.5 mm and kcat = 0.125 ± 0.004 min–1, resulting in a catalytic efficiency ∼ 8-fold higher than that of wild-type for d-alanine (5Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Paiardini A. Di Salvo M. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).As with wild-type, K238A and Y123F apomutants are able to convert the PMP form of the enzyme back into the PLP form in the presence of pyruvate. The kinetic parameters for this reaction are listed in Table III. The kcat/Km value of Y123F is reduced by only 2.5-fold as compared with that of wild-type enzyme. This reduction is due to approximately equal magnitude changes in the kcat and Km values. On the contrary, the kcat/Km of the K238A variant is increased by 25-fold as compared with that of the wild-type. The increase in the catalytic efficiency of this mutant is driven by the decrease in Km (30-fold), as the kcat is not appreciably affected. It is also of interest to note that only alanine in the d-form is generated by the K238A variant, whereas l-alanine is formed in amounts ∼2-fold higher than those of d-alanine by the Y123F mutant. The amounts of l- and d-alanine produced from Y123F have been evaluated after 25 min of reaction of 100 μm variant enzyme in the presence of 200 μm PMP and 0.3 mm pyruvate. Thus, on the basis of the kcat values of racemization and reverse transamination of the Y123F variant, it can be inferred that the production of d-alanine is mainly due to transamination rather than the conversion of l- into d-alanine. It should be noted that l- and d-alanine are produced in nearly equivalent amounts when apo wild-type reacts with pyruvate in the presence of PMP. However, given the higher racemization rate in this case, it was not possible to determine whether both enantiomers of alanine are formed by racemization rather than by transamination (5Bertoldi M. Cellini B. Paiardini A. Di Salvo M. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochem.

In contrast, under the same experimental conditions the regain of activity upon the addition of a coenzyme to either apo Y123F or Y123F/Y124F as a function of time reached a near saturation value within 1 h. Titration analysis of the apomutants Y123F, Y124F, and Y123F/Y124F with PLP fitted to the appropriate equation yielded Kd values for the PLP-Y123F, PLP-Y124F, and PLP-Y123F/Y124F complexes equal to 295 ± 60, 164 ± 26, and 137 ± 30 nm, respectively (data not shown).

In vivo, mutation of Arg-462 and Cys-463 inhibited TGFβ1-stimulated phosphorylation of the C-terminal serine residues in Smad2. Moreover, Smad2 with mutated Arg-462 and Cys-463 was less efficient in activation of the Smad2-responsive activin-responsive element-containing luciferase reporter ARE-luc, as compared with the wild-type protein.

TGFβ, BMPs, and activins bind to serine/threonine kinase receptors to initiate activation of the receptor kinase. Activated receptors phosphorylate receptor-regulated Smad proteins that were found to have crucial importance for signaling. Five receptor-regulated Smads have been described in mammals, e.g. Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, Smad5, and Smad8 (1Derynck R. Zhang Y.

Smad2 and Smad3 are activated by TGFβ and activin receptors, and Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 are activated by BMP receptors.

The recognition of Smads by type I serine/threonine kinase receptors defines specificity in intracellular signaling. A number of reports have pointed to the importance of interfaces between the L45 loop and the GS domain of type I receptors and the L3 loop, the adjacent basic surface, and the α-H1 helix in the MH2 domain of receptor-regulated Smads as determinants of specificity in recognition of Smads by receptor kinases (8Feng X-H.

Phosphorylation of the two C-terminal serine residues is also important for relief of the inhibitory intramolecular interaction between the MH1 and the MH2 domains, leading to activation of Smads (6Abdollah S.

Therefore, phosphorylation of the C terminus of receptor-activated Smads is crucial for initiation of TGFβ signaling. For a number of kinases, specificity of phosphorylation is determined by sequences adjacent to the site of phosphorylation (18Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Consensus sequences have been established for more than 50 kinases, suggesting that substrate recognition is mediated by a complementation between amino acid residues in a substrate and in a kinase substrate-binding region in or immediate to the catalytic cleft (19Songyang Z. Lu K.P. Kwon Y.T. Tsai L-H. Filhol O. Cochet C. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Bartleson C. Graves D.J. DeMaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. Blenis J. Hunter T. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6486-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Previously we showed that the C-terminal Smad2 peptide specifically inhibited TβR-I kinase, but not other receptor kinases (20Yakmovych I. Engstrom U. Heldin C-H. Souchelnytskyi S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11000-11007Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This suggests that the substrate recognition site of TβR-I kinase has preferences for the C-terminal peptide of Smad2. Here we have shown that Arg-462 and Cys-463 in the C terminus of Smad2 are important for specific recognition and phosphorylation of the C-terminal serine residues of Smad2 by TβR-I. Materials, Reagents, Constructs—The constructs of constitutively active GST-TβR-I, GST-BMPR-II, GST-Smad2, and FLAG-Smad2 were described earlier (20Yakmovych I. Engstrom U. Heldin C-H. Souchelnytskyi S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11000-11007Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 21Yakymovych I. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Souchelnytskyi S.

Proteomics. 2004; 4: 1346-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mutants of GST-Smad2 and FLAG-Smad2 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing of the constructs, and expression of proteins was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and by immunoblotting assay. Mv1Lu, NIH3T3, and COS1 cells were obtained from ATCC (LGC, Teddington), and Smad2-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were obtained from Anita Roberts and Ester Piek. All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assay—For phosphorylation assay, peptides were diluted in the reaction mixture (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm ATP plus 0.5 μCi of [γ32P]ATP (Redivue; Amersham Biosciences)). The peptides used in this study were synthesized using the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry as described (20Yakmovych I. Engstrom U. Heldin C-H. Souchelnytskyi S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11000-11007Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Three lysine residues were added to the N terminus of each peptide to allow peptide binding to the P81 phosphocellulose paper or to the plastic. Phosphorylation reaction was initiated by addition of constitutively active GST-TβR-I adsorbed on glutathione-Sepharose beads. After 20 min of incubation at 22 °C, reaction mixtures were centrifuged, and the supernatants were spotted onto Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper. Filters were washed in three changes of 0.75% phosphoric acid, rinsed in acetone, dried, and counted in a scintillation counter. Every experimental condition was performed in triplicate, and experiments were repeated three to four times. In some experiments, phosphorylated peptides were separated by a Tricine-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (23Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar). Gels were dried and exposed by phosphorimaging. Phosphorylation of GST-Smad2 proteins in vitro was performed as described earlier (20Yakmovych I. Engstrom U. Heldin C-H. Souchelnytskyi S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11000-11007Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred onto the nitrocellulose membrane, and phosphorylation of the C terminus was analyzed by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. Detection of Smad2 C-terminal Phosphorylation—Immunoblotting with pS2 antibodies that specifically recognize phosphorylated C-terminal Ser-465 and Ser-467 in Smad2 was performed as described earlier (20Yakmovych I. Engstrom U. Heldin C-H. Souchelnytskyi S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11000-11007Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Luciferase Reporter Assays—The cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations or using a 25-kDa branched polyethyleneimine (Sigma) as described (24Durocher Y. Perret S. Kamen A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: E9Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Activin-responsive element (ARE)-luc reporter assays were performed as previously described (21Yakymovych I. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Souchelnytskyi S.

In all reporter assays, the β-galactosidase reporter plasmid pCMV-LacZ was used for normalization of efficiency of transfection. TβR-I Phosphorylates Specifically the C-terminal Peptide of Smad2—Amino acid residues adjacent to sites of phosphorylation are for several kinases crucial for substrate recognition, e.g. Pro is required at the +1 position for phosphorylation by Erk (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) 1/2 (19Songyang Z. Lu K.P. Kwon Y.T. Tsai L-H. Filhol O. Cochet C. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Bartleson C. Graves D.J. DeMaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. Blenis J. Hunter T. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6486-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). To explore whether phosphorylation of Smads by TβR-I kinase is dependent on surrounding amino acids, we performed in vitro kinase assays with peptides corresponding to the C-terminal tails of Smad2 and Smad5 as substrates (Fig. 1A). The use of peptides allowed us to exclude an influence of the N-terminal sequence, e.g. of the MH2 domain. Crystallography studies could not identify a defined structure for the C terminus of Smad, suggesting that the C terminus is not an intrinsic part of the MH2 domain (17Shi Y. Hata A. Lo R.S. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1997; 388: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). We found that TβR-I kinase phosphorylated the C-terminal Smad2 peptide (Sm2S), but not the Smad2 peptide with the five C-terminal serine residues substituted to alanines (Sm2A). Neither was Smad5 C-terminal peptide with mutated serines (Sm5A) phosphorylated by TβR-I, and wild-type Smad5 peptide (Sm5S) showed very weak signal (Fig. 1B). A similar specificity of TβR-I-dependent phosphorylation was observed with the same peptides coupled to plastic surfaces (data not shown). Furthermore, phosphorylation of the Smad2 peptide was specific for TβR-I kinase because other serine/threonine kinases receptors, e.g. bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPR-II), bone morphogenetic receptor type I (BMPR-IB), and type II TGFβ receptor did not phosphorylate the peptide (Fig. 1C). Preservation of the specificity of TβR-I kinase toward a substrate was also shown previously (20Yakmovych I. Engstrom U. Heldin C-H. Souchelnytskyi S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11000-11007Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In vitro phosphorylation assay with various concentrations of the Sm2S and Sm5S peptides (31, 62, 125, 250, 500, and 1000 μm) showed that the Sm2S peptide was strongly phosphorylated at a concentration of 31 μm with a maximal level achieved at 500 μm (Fig. 1D). Weak, but detectable, phosphorylation of Smad5 peptide was observed only at 1000-μm concentration of the peptide. This suggests that under non-physiological conditions the C-terminal tail of BMP Smad5 can be phosphorylated by TβR-I. To explore which residue(s) in the C-terminal peptide of Smad2 defines specificity of Smad2 recognition by the TβR-I kinase, we generated peptides with substitutions of Ser-460, Arg-462, and Cys-463 to Ala, Ile and Ala, respectively (Fig. 1A). We found that the strongest decrease of phosphorylation was observed when both Arg-462 and Cys-463 were mutated (Sm2R462I,C463A peptide; Fig. 1E). Single mutations of Arg-462 and Cys-463 decreased phosphorylation of peptides as well. We did not see changes in peptide phosphorylation when Ser-460 or when Ser-458, Ser-460, and Ser-464 were mutated (Fig. 1E). Thus, Arg-462 and Cys-463 are of importance for phosphorylation of the C-terminal peptide of Smad2 by the TβR-I kinase. Mutation of Arg-462 and Cys-463 Prevents Phosphorylation of the C-terminal Serine Residues in GST-Smad2 by TβR-I— We further explored the importance of the amino acid residues in the region from Ser-460 to Cys-463 for the specific phosphorylation of Smad2 by TβR-I. We mutated these four residues one by one or in pairs in a Smad2-fused to GST (Fig. 2A). The GST-Smad2 constructs were expressed in bacteria (Fig. 2B), and purified proteins were phosphorylated by TβR-I kinase in vitro. Because we were interested in analysis of phosphorylation of the C-terminal peptide, we performed two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. A distinct migration pattern of the C-terminal tryptic peptide allowed us to monitor phosphorylation of this particular peptide. This provides an advantage to evaluation of a total phosphorylation, which does not monitor phosphorylation of selected sites but rather of the whole molecule. We observed a phosphopeptide with migration position corresponding to the wild-type peptide (Fig. 2C) in phosphopeptide maps of double mutants GST-Smad2S460A,V461N and GST-Smad2V461N,R462P (Fig. 2, D and E). The observed slight deviations in migrations of the peptides is because of the substitutions made and in the case of GST-Smad2V461N,R462P mutant because of abrogation of trypsin cleavage C-terminal to Arg-462. A double mutation of Arg-462 and Cys-463 abrogated GST-Smad2 phosphorylation, as we could not observe any phosphopeptide in areas of the expected migration nor did any other additional spots appear in the two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps (Fig. 2F). The variation in efficiency of phosphorylation of the full-length double mutant GST-Smad2R462P,C463I (Fig. 2F), as compared with the Sm2R462I,C463A peptide (Fig. 1E) may be explained by the presence of the upstream sequence in GST-Smad2, e.g. the MH1 and MH2 domains. GST-Smad2 constructs with Arg-462 or Cys-463 mutated separately showed low, but detectable, phosphorylation of the C-terminal peptide (Fig. 2, G and H). Quantification of the C-terminal peptide phosphorylation, expressed as the ratio of the C-terminal peptide phosphorylation to the total phosphorylation of the respective Smad2 construct, showed arbitrary values of 0.39 for the C463I mutant, 0.56 for the R462P mutant, and 0.71 for the wild-type protein. These values, which reflect the phosphorylation efficiency of the C-terminal peptides in whole proteins, correlate with the stronger inhibitory effect of the mutation of the cysteine residue, as compared with the mutation of the arginine residue, on the phosphorylation of synthesized peptides (Fig. 1E). Thus, our data suggest that both Arg-462 and Cys-463 contribute to the TβR-I-dependent phosphorylation of GST-Smad2 at the C terminus. Substitution of Arg-462 and Cys-463 Inhibits Phosphorylation of the C Terminus of Smad2 by TβR-I in Vivo—To evaluate the involvement of Arg-462 and Cys-463 in TβR-I-dependent phosphorylation of Smad2 in vivo, we expressed FLAG-tagged Smad2, wild-type, and mutants in various cell lines. Transfected cells were treated or not with TGFβ1, and phosphorylation of the two C-terminal serine residues was monitored by immunoblotting with pS2 antibodies that recognize phosphorylated C-terminal Ser-465 and Ser-467 (Fig. 3). As a negative control, we used FLAG-Smad2 with the two C-terminal serines substituted by alanine residues (FLAG-Smad2SA). We found that none of the mutations affected the stability of proteins, whether proteins were expressed at low or at high levels (Fig. 3). We observed that substitution of both Arg-462 and Cys-463 to either Pro-462 and Ile-463 (FLAG-Smad2R462P,C463I; RC/PI mutant) or to Ile-462 and Ala-463 (FLAG-Smad2R462I,C463A; RC/IA mutant) inhibited TGFβ1-dependent phosphorylation at the C-terminal serine residues (Fig. 3, B–E). In Mv1Lu epithelial cells and in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts we did not observe any detectable C-terminal phosphorylation of RC/PI or RC/IA mutants of FLAG-Smad2; neither was there any phosphorylation of the FLAG-Smad2S465A,S467A (SS/AA) mutant as expected (Fig. 3, D and E). We could observe some phosphorylation of the FLAG-Smad2 RC/PI and RC/IA mutants upon expression in Smad2-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts. However, quantification of the phosphorylation showed significant reduction in efficiency of phosphorylation (Fig. 3, B and C). Moreover, analysis of time-dependence of Smad2 phosphorylation upon TGFβ1 treatment showed that the RC/PI mutant was phosphorylated at a slower rate than the wild-type FLAG-Smad2 (Fig. 4). The rate of Smad phosphorylation may be affected by various interacting proteins and could therefore be cell type-dependent. Our consistent results using three different cell lines of epithelial and mesenchymal origin suggest that Arg-462 and Cys-463 are of general importance for the specificity of phosphorylation of Smad2 by TβR-I. Substitution of Arg-462 and Cys-463 in Smad2 Results in Inhibition of TGFβ1/Smad2-dependent Transcriptional Activation—To explore the impact of the observed role of Arg-462 and Cys-463 in Smad2 phosphorylation by TβR-I on the functional activity of Smad2, we performed luciferase reporter assay with the Smad2-responsive ARE-luc reporter. This reporter contains an ARE that mediates TGFβ/Smad2-dependent transcriptional activation (25Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). We found that mutation of Arg-462 and Cys-463 inhibited the transcriptional activity of Smad2 expressed in Smad2-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts as compared with the wild-type Smad2 (Fig. 5A). Residual transcriptional activity of FLAG-Smad2 RC/PI and RC/IA mutants correlated with the levels of their TGFβ1-dependent phosphorylation (Fig. 3, B and C). These two mutants did not show ligand-dependent transcriptional activity in Mv1Lu epithelial cells (Fig. 5B). Thus, the importance of Arg-462 and Cys-463 for recognition and phosphorylation of Smad2 by TβR-I kinase is also reflected in the inhibition of transcriptional activation of Smad2 upon TGFβ1 treatment. Here we have provided evidence that Arg-462 and Cys-463 in the C terminus of Smad2 are important for recognition and phosphorylation of the serine residues 465 and 467 by TβR-I. Our findings expand the current view on determinants of specificity in TGFβ signaling. Previously, it has been shown that the physical interaction between TβR-I and Smad2 is mediated by the L45 loop and GS region of the receptor and by the L3 loop and the adjacent basic surface of Smad protein (8Feng X-H.

Cell. 2001; 8: 671-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). For Smad1, a member of the BMP Smad family, the importance of the α-H1 helix in the MH2 domain for interaction with ALK1 and ALK2 receptors has also been shown, in addition to the L3 loop (11Chen Y-G. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3672-3677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The role of the C-terminal sequences of receptor-regulated Smads in determination of signaling specificity has not been addressed thoroughly. The fact that mutation of the phosphorylatable serine residues increases the interaction with TβR-I suggests that the C terminus, or at least C-terminal phosphorylation, affects the interaction between receptor and Smad protein (4Macias-Silva M.

The reported inhibition of TβR-I by the C-terminal peptide specific for Smad2 and the inability of the Smad5-specific C-terminal peptide to inhibit the TβR-I kinase suggest that the kinase may be able to selectively recognize the substrate even in the absence of the MH2 domain (20Yakmovych I. Engstrom U. Heldin C-H. Souchelnytskyi S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11000-11007Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Several kinases are dependent on specific sequences adjacent to the site of phosphorylation (19Songyang Z. Lu K.P. Kwon Y.T. Tsai L-H. Filhol O. Cochet C. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Bartleson C. Graves D.J. DeMaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. Blenis J. Hunter T. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6486-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Consensus sequences for at least 50 kinases have been identified (18Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), and residues at +1 or -3 and -4 have been found to be of particular importance for recognition of substrates by kinases (19Songyang Z. Lu K.P. Kwon Y.T. Tsai L-H. Filhol O. Cochet C. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Bartleson C. Graves D.J. DeMaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. Blenis J. Hunter T. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6486-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). An early attempt to identify a consensus phosphorylation sequence for TβR-I using a peptide library showed that the presence of basic charges at the -4 and -3 positions would be preferable for phosphorylation by TβR-I (26Luo K. Zhou P. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11761-11765Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The presence of arginine residue at the -5 and -3 positions, compared with phosphorylatable serines in the C terminus of Smad2, is in agreement with this suggestion. Here we have shown that TβR-I kinase can specifically recognize the Smad2 C-terminal sequence and that Arg-462 and Cys-463 are crucial determinants for the specificity. The importance of Arg-462 and Cys-463 was observed in vitro for peptides and in the context of the whole Smad2 molecule as well as in vivo for expressed Smad2 proteins (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4). Some difference in the phosphorylation efficiency of peptides, as compared with full-length proteins, may be because of the upstream sequences in proteins, e.g. the MH1 and MH2 domains. However, the similarity of results obtained with peptides that do not have any of the MH2 domain structural features, and with full-length proteins, supports the notion that Arg-462 and Cys-463 are important determinants of recognition and phosphorylation of the Smad2 C terminus. Positioning of the C-terminal peptide in the substrate-binding region of TβR-I showed that Arg-462 and Cys-463 of Smad2 may interact with residues in the activation segment of the kinase (Fig. 6) (27Huse M. Chen Y-G. Massague J. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1999; 96: 425-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The activation segments of TGFβ- and BMP-specific receptors differ, with strong similarities of the sequences within the groups of receptor. Thus, the presence of aspartic acid residues in the activation segments of TβR-I and ActR-IB, e.g. Asp-359 and Asp-363, may provide negatively charged surfaces that interact with positively charged C-terminal residues of Smad2 (Fig. 6). Significant similarity in the activation segments has also been observed for ALK7, which is known to phosphorylate Smad2 and Smad3. The activation segments of BMPR-IA and BMPR-IB receptor kinases have sequences that differ from the TGFβ receptors. Another group, defined on the basis of the sequences of activation segments, consists of ActR-IA and ALK1 receptors. Thus, it is tempting to suggest that the activation segments of receptor kinases provide a surface for specific recognition of the C-terminal peptide of Smad proteins. However, for the conclusive answer, the structure of the TβR-I kinase with bound substrate has to be determined. Our findings add a new aspect to our understanding of the determination of specificity in TGFβ signaling. Whereas the interfaces between the L3 loop, basic surface, and α-H1 structures of Smad proteins and the L45 loop and GS domain of the type I receptors are involved in docking of Smads to receptors, specific recognition of the C-terminal phosphorylation sites adds to the specificity of substrate recognition. Importance of adjacent amino acid residues for specific recognition and phosphorylation of substrates is well established for many kinases. The data presented here extend this notion to the type I serine/threonine kinases receptors and their substrates. We thank Ulla Engström for synthesis of peptides."
