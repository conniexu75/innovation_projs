https://openalex.org/W2894849432,"Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) represent promising raw materials of human cell-based therapeutic products (hCTPs). As undifferentiated hiPSCs exhibit intrinsic tumorigenicity properties that enable them to form teratomas, hCTPs containing residual undifferentiated hiPSCs may cause tumor formation following transplantation. We first established quantitative and sensitive tumorigenicity testing of hiPSCs dissociated into single cells using NOD/Shi-scid IL2Rγnull (NOG) mice by inhibiting apoptosis of hiPSCs with a Rho kinase inhibitor. To examine different features in tumorigenicity of various hiPSCs, 10 commonly available hiPSC lines were subjected to in vivo tumorigenicity testing. Transplanted hiPSC lines showed remarkable variation in tumor incidence, formation latency, and volumes. Most of the tumors formed were classified as immature teratomas. However, no signs of malignancies, such as carcinoma and sarcoma, were recognized in the tumors. Characteristics associated tumorigenicity of hiPSCs were investigated with microarray analysis, karyotype analysis, and whole exome sequencing. Gene expression profiling and pathway analysis supported different features of hiPSC lines in tumorigenicity. hiPSC lines showed chromosomal abnormalities in some lines and 61–77 variants of cancer-related genes carrying effective nonsynonymous mutations, which were confirmed in the COSMIC databases. In this study, the chromosomal abnormalities and cancer-related gene mutations observed in hiPSC lines did not lead to the malignancy of tumors derived from hiPSCs. Our results suggest that the potential tumorigenicity risk of hCTPs containing residual undifferentiated hiPSCs is dependent on not only amounts of undifferentiated hiPSCs but also features of the cell lines used as raw materials, a finding that should be considered from the perspective of quality of hCTPs used."
https://openalex.org/W2895735540,"The cellular dispersion and therapeutic control of glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of primary brain cancer, depends critically on the migration patterns after surgery and intracellular responses of the individual cancer cells in response to external biochemical cues in the microenvironment. Recent studies have shown that miR-451 regulates downstream molecules including AMPK/CAB39/MARK and mTOR to determine the balance between rapid proliferation and invasion in response to metabolic stress in the harsh tumor microenvironment. Surgical removal of the main tumor is inevitably followed by recurrence of the tumor due to inaccessibility of dispersed tumor cells in normal brain tissue. In order to address this complex process of cell proliferation and invasion and its response to conventional treatment, we propose a mathematical model that analyzes the intracellular dynamics of the miR-451-AMPK- mTOR-cell cycle signaling pathway within a cell. The model identifies a key mechanism underlying the molecular switches between proliferative phase and migratory phase in response to metabolic stress in response to fluctuating glucose levels. We show how up- or down-regulation of components in these pathways affects the key cellular decision to infiltrate or proliferate in a complex microenvironment in the absence and presence of time delays and stochastic noise. Glycosylated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the brain, contribute to the physical structure of the local brain microenvironment but also induce or inhibit glioma invasion by regulating the dynamics of the CSPG receptor LAR as well as the spatiotemporal activation status of resident astrocytes and tumor-associated microglia. Using a multi-scale mathematical model, we investigate a CSPG-induced switch between invasive and non-invasive tumors through the coordination of ECM-cell adhesion and dynamic changes in stromal cells. We show that the CSPG-rich microenvironment is associated with non-invasive tumor lesions through LAR-CSGAG binding while the absence of glycosylated CSPGs induce the critical glioma invasion. We illustrate how high molecular weight CSPGs can regulate the exodus of local reactive astrocytes from the main tumor lesion, leading to encapsulation of non-invasive tumor and inhibition of tumor invasion. These different CSPG conditions also change the spatial profiles of ramified and activated microglia. The complex distribution of CSPGs in the tumor microenvironment can determine the nonlinear invasion behaviors of glioma cells, which suggests the need for careful therapeutic strategies."

Analysis of variance to explore differences in scores by country and level of healthcare facility for each cadre. Mixed effects regression analysis to account for potential explanatory factors including; facility type, years of experience providing maternity care, months since training and number of repeat assessments.Change in knowledge and skills.Before training the overall mean (SD) score for skills was 48.8% (11.6%) and 65.6% (10.7%). for knowledge. After training the mean (95% CI) relative improvement in knowledge was 30.8% (29.1% - 32.6%) and 59.8% (58.6%- 60.9%) for skills. Mean scores for knowledge and skills at each subsequent assessment remained between those immediately post-training and those at 3 months. NMWs who attended all four assessments demonstrated statistically better retention of skills (14.9%, 95% CI 7.8%, 22.0% p<0.001) but not knowledge (8.6%, 95% CI -0.3%, 17.4%. p = 0.06) compared to those who attended one or two assessments only. Health care facility level or experience were not determinants of retention.After training, healthcare providers retain knowledge and skills for up to 12 months. This effect can likely be enhanced by short repeat skills-training sessions, or, 'fire drills'."
https://openalex.org/W2895747099,"Post-mixing aggression in pigs is a harmful and costly behaviour which negatively impacts both animal welfare and farm efficiency. There is vast unexplained variation in the amount of acute and chronic aggression that dyadic behaviours do not fully explain. This study hypothesised that certain pen-level network properties may improve prediction of lesion outcomes due to the incorporation of indirect social interactions that are not captured by dyadic traits. Utilising current SNA theory, we investigate whether pen-level network properties affect the number of aggression-related injuries at 24 hours and 3 weeks post-mixing (24hr-PM and 3wk-PM). Furthermore we compare the predictive value of network properties to conventional dyadic traits. A total of 78 pens were video recorded for 24hr post-mixing. Each aggressive interaction that occurred during this time period was used to construct the pen-level networks. The relationships between network properties at 24hr and the pen level injuries at 24hr-PM and 3wk-PM were analysed using mixed models and verified using permutation tests. The results revealed that network properties at 24hr could predict long term aggression (3wk-PM) better than dyadic traits. Specifically, large clique formation in the first 24hr-PM predicted fewer injuries at 3wk-PM and high betweenness centralisation at 24hr-PM predicted increased rates of injury at 3wk-PM. This study demonstrates that network properties present during the first 24hr-PM have predictive value for chronic aggression, and have potential to allow identification and intervention for at risk groups."
https://openalex.org/W2895047183,"This work explores the use of multispectral imaging (MSI) techniques applied to the investigation of Late Antique (c. 250–800 AD) textiles found in Egypt. Although the use of these techniques is well-established in the study of polychrome surfaces, they have only been sparingly and often unsystematically applied to the investigation of textiles. The aim of this work is therefore to bridge this gap by showing how this non-invasive, relatively inexpensive and portable methodology can be used to map the photoluminescence and reflective characteristics of textiles under different wavelengths of light, and to provide qualitative and holistic insights into the chemical nature of the materials that compose them. Standardised acquisition and post-processing methods were applied to produce visible-reflected (VIS), ultraviolet-induced visible luminescence (UVL), infrared-reflected (IRR), infrared-reflected false colour (IRRFC), ultraviolet-reflected (UVR) and ultraviolet-reflected false colour (UVRFC) images that provided preliminary indications of the colourants used and their spatial distribution. This proved to be an important aid in planning more targeted and effective sampling strategies and facilitated comparisons between objects. Visible-induced visible luminescence (VIVL) and multiband-reflected (MBR) imaging were also explored for the first time with application to textiles, demonstrating their potential in mapping red and blue colourants respectively. The physical properties observed from all of these images were then related to the more detailed information provided by complementary non-invasive techniques, such as fibre optic reflectance spectroscopy (FORS), and micro-invasive approaches, such as high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Guidelines towards the interpretation of complex MSI images and a discussion of the potential and limitations of relating multispectral data to chemical properties are presented. An important result of this work is the delineation of a protocol, which combines optical microscopy (OM), MSI, FORS and HPLC-MS and shows a high degree of potential, not only for the investigation of Late Antique textiles but for textiles in museum and historic collections generally."
https://openalex.org/W2895684882,"The inland area of southwestern Sweden is well known for its well-preserved archaeological animal and human remains dating back to the Mesolithic and Neolithic (10000-4000 and 4000-1700 BC). They allow application of multiple bioarchaeological methods, giving insights into various and complementary aspects of prehistoric human life, as well as economic and social structures. One important aspect concerns human mobility and its relation to social networks and to circulation of objects. Here, strontium isotope analysis plays a crucial role. The present study aims to construct a strontium isotope baseline of southwestern Sweden with considerably greater coverage and higher resolution than previously published data. As the region has been affected by glacial events, the relation between bedrock geology and isotope signals of the bioavailable strontium in such areas is given special attention. We determined strontium isotope ratios for 61 water and five archaeological animal samples, and combined the data with previous measurements of two water and 21 non-domestic faunal samples. The results reveal a complex pattern. Several areas with distinct baseline ranges can be distinguished, although with overlaps between some of them. Overall, the bioavailable strontium isotope signals mirror the basement geology of the region. The highest ratios occur in the geologically oldest eastern parts of the Precambrian terrain, while lower ratios are found in the western part, and the lowest ratios occur in the youngest Paleozoic areas. At the same time, there are minor deviations compared to the underlying bedrock, due to glacial transport, overlying sediments, and local intrusions of younger rocks. The background data set now available allows for more nuanced and detailed interpretations of human and animal mobility in the region, in particular by identification of subregions with differing strontium isotope ratios within the Precambrian province. Also, we can now identify long distance mobility with greater confidence."
https://openalex.org/W2895464296,"We have optimized the design and imaging procedures, to clearly resolve the malaria parasite in Giemsa-stained thin blood smears, using simple low-cost cellphone-based microscopy with oil immersion. The microscope uses a glass ball as the objective and the phone camera as the tube lens. Our optimization includes the optimal choice of the ball lens diameter, the size and the position of the aperture diaphragm, and proper application of immersion, to achieve diagnostic capacity in a wide field of view. The resulting system is potentially applicable to low-cost in-the-field optical diagnostics of malaria as it clearly resolves micron-sized features and allows for analysis of parasite morphology in the field of 50 × 50 μm, and parasite detection in the field of at least 150 × 150 μm."
https://openalex.org/W2894698528,"It has previously been shown that first impressions of a speaker’s personality, whether accurate or not, can be judged from short utterances of vowels and greetings, as well as from prolonged sentences and readings of complex paragraphs. From these studies, it is established that listeners’ judgements are highly consistent with one another, suggesting that different people judge personality traits in a similar fashion, with three key personality traits being related to measures of valence (associated with trustworthiness), dominance, and attractiveness. Yet, particularly in voice perception, limited research has established the reliability of such personality judgements across stimulus types of varying lengths. Here we investigate whether first impressions of trustworthiness, dominance, and attractiveness of novel speakers are related when a judgement is made on hearing both one word and one sentence from the same speaker. Secondly, we test whether what is said, thus adjusting content, influences the stability of personality ratings. 60 Scottish voices (30 females) were recorded reading two texts: one of ambiguous content and one with socially-relevant content. One word (~500 ms) and one sentence (~3000 ms) were extracted from each recording for each speaker. 181 participants (138 females) rated either male or female voices across both content conditions (ambiguous, socially-relevant) and both stimulus types (word, sentence) for one of the three personality traits (trustworthiness, dominance, attractiveness). Pearson correlations showed personality ratings between words and sentences were strongly correlated, with no significant influence of content. In short, when establishing an impression of a novel speaker, judgments of three key personality traits are highly related whether you hear one word or one sentence, irrespective of what they are saying. This finding is consistent with initial personality judgments serving as elucidators of approach or avoidance behaviour, without modulation by time or content. All data and sounds are available on OSF (osf.io/s3cxy)."
https://openalex.org/W2895600194,"Fuel moisture content (FMC) is an important fuel property for assessing wildfire hazard, since it influences fuel flammability and fire behavior. The relationship between FMC and fire activity differs among land covers and seems to be a property of each ecosystem. Our objectives were to analyze pre-fire FMC among different land covers and to propose a wildfire hazard classification for the Sierras Chicas in the Chaco Serrano subregion (Argentina), by analyzing pre-fire FMC distributions observed for grasslands, shrublands and forests and using percentiles to establish thresholds. For this purpose, we used a fire database derived from Landsat imagery (30 m) and derived FMC maps every 8 days from 2002 to 2016 using MODIS reflectance products and empirical equations of FMC. Our results indicated that higher FMC constrains the extent of wildfires, whereas at lower FMC there are other factors affecting their size. Extreme and high fire hazard thresholds for grasslands were established at FMC of 55% and 67% respectively, at 72% and 105% for forests and at 106% and 121% for shrublands. Our FMC thresholds were sensitive to detect extreme fire hazard conditions during years with high fire activity in comparison to average conditions. The differences in the distributions of pre-fire FMC among land covers and between ecosystems highlighted the need to locally determine land cover-specific FMC thresholds to assess wildfire hazard. Our wildfire hazard classification applied to FMC maps in an operational framework will contribute to improving early warning systems in the Sierras Chicas. However, moisture alone is not sufficient to represent true fire hazard in Chaco forests and the combination with other variables would provide better hazard assessments. These operational wildfire hazard maps will help to better allocation of fire protective resources to minimize negative impact on people, property and ecosystems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing pre-fire FMC over several fire seasons in a non-Mediterranean ecosystem, aiming at assessing wildfire hazard."
https://openalex.org/W2894642851,"A key requirement for 13C Metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA), a widely used technique to estimate intracellular metabolic fluxes, is an efficient method for the extraction of intermediate metabolites for analysis via liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The 13C isotopic labeling results in further distribution of an already sparse pool of intermediate metabolites into isotopologues, each appearing as a separate chromatographic feature. We examined some of the reported solvent systems for the extraction of polar intracellular metabolites from three strains of cyanobacteria of the genus Synechococcus, viz., Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, and a newly isolated Synechococcus elongatus PCC 11801 (manuscript under review). High resolution-LC/MS was used to assess the relative abundance of the extracted metabolites. The different solvent systems used for extraction led to statistically significant changes in the extraction efficiency for a large number of metabolites. While a few hundred m/z features or potential metabolites were detected with different solvent systems, the abundance of over a quarter of all metabolites varied significantly from one solvent system to another. Further, the extraction methods were evaluated for a targeted set of metabolites that are important in 13C-MFA studies of photosynthetic organisms. While for the strain PCC 7002, the reported method using methanol-chloroform-water system gave satisfactory results, a mild base in the form of NH4OH had to be used in place of water to achieve adequate levels of extraction for PCC 7942 and PCC 11801. While minor changes in extraction solvent resulted in dramatic changes in the extraction efficiency of a number of compounds, certain metabolites such as amino acids and organic acids were adequately extracted in all the solvent systems tested. Overall, we present a new improved method for extraction using a methanol-chloroform-NH4OH system. Our method improves the extraction of polar compounds such as sugar phosphates, bisphosphates, that are central to 13C-MFA studies."
https://openalex.org/W2895193989,"Objective To explore intersections of social determinants of maternal healthcare utilization using the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm which is a machine-learning method used to construct prediction models. Methods Institutional review board approval for this study was granted from Public Health Service—Ethical Review Board (PHS-ERB) and from the Health Ministry Screening Committee (HMSC) facilitated by Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). IRB review and approval for the current analyses was obtained from University of California, San Diego. Cross-sectional data were collected from women with children aged 0–11 months (n = 5,565) from rural households in 25 districts of Uttar Pradesh, India. Participants were surveyed on maternal healthcare utilization including registration of pregnancy (model-1), receipt of antenatal care (ANC) during pregnancy (model-2), and delivery at health facilities (model -3). Social determinants of health including wealth, social group, literacy, religion, and early age at marriage were captured during the survey. The Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm was used to explore intersections of social determinants of healthcare utilization. Results CART analyses highlight the intersections, particularly of wealth and literacy, in maternal healthcare utilization in Uttar Pradesh. Model-1 documents that women who are poorer, illiterate and Muslim are less likely to have their pregnancies registered (71.4% vs. 86.0% in the overall sample). Model-2 documents that poorer, illiterate women had the lowest ANC coverage (37.7% vs 45% in the overall sample). Model-3, developed for deliveries at health facilities, highlighted that illiterate and poor women have the lowest representation among facility deliveries (59.6% vs. 69% in the overall sample). Conclusion This paper explores the interactions between determinants of maternal healthcare utilization indicators. The findings in this paper highlights that the interaction of wealth and literacy can play a very strong role in accentuating or diminishing healthcare utilization among women. The study also reveals that religion and women’s age at marriage also interact with wealth and literacy to create substantial disparities in utilization. The study provides insights into the effect of intersections of determinants, and highlights the importance of using a more nuanced understanding of the impact of co-occurring forms of marginalization to effectively tackle inequities in healthcare utilization."

PBK/TOPK may also accelerate tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer.We investigated the impact of PBK/TOPK on the clinical outcome of colorectal cancer patients to further identify its role in colorectal cancer. PBK/TOPK immunoreactivity was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 162 cancer specimens from primary colorectal cancer patients.The mean follow-up time after surgery was 5.4 years (medium: 3.9 years; range 0.01 to 13.1 years). The prognostic value of PBK/TOPK on overall survival was determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard models. PBK/TOPK was expressed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. High PBK/TOPK expression in tumor cells was significantly associated with advanced T value. The 5-year survival rate was greater for patients with high total PBK/TOPK expression than with low PBK/TOPK expression (58.3% vs 34.4%, P = 0.005). Multivariate analyses showed that low-scoring cytoplasmic PBK/TOPK, negative nuclear PBK/TOPK, low total PBK/TOPK, and advanced tumor stage were correlated with poor overall patient survival.We suggest that PBK/TOPK expression, detected by IHC staining, could be used as an independent prognostic marker for colorectal cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2894985092,"Few studies have investigated the therapeutic effects of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We compared the risk of all-cause mortality between metformin users and nonusers.We conducted a retrospective cohort study for patients with T2DM and COPD who were enrolled between January 1, 2000 and June 30, 2012. Individuals with exacerbated symptoms who were hospitalized or sent to the emergency department (ED) were identified as having exacerbated COPD; outpatient claims were identified as having stable COPD. A total of 40,597 metformin users and 39,529 nonusers comprised the cohort of stable COPD; 14,001 metformin users and 21,613 nonusers comprised the cohort of exacerbated COPD. Users and nonusers were matched using propensity score (1:1). Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality.A total of 19,505 metformin users were matched to 19,505 nonusers in the cohort of diabetes with stable COPD. The mean follow-up time was 3.91 years. All-cause mortality was reported in 1326 and 1609 metformin users and nonusers, respectively. After multivariate adjustment, metformin users had lower risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.84, p < 0.0001). Metformin users had significantly lower risk of noncardiovascular death (aHR = 0.86, p = 0.0008). A total of 7721 metformin users were matched to 7721 nonusers in the cohort of diabetes with exacerbated COPD. The mean follow-up time was 3.18 years. All-cause mortality was reported in 1567 and 1865 metformin users and nonusers, respectively. After multivariate adjustment, metformin users had significantly lower risk of mortality (aHR = 0.89, p = 0.002) and cardiovascular death (aHR = 0.70, p = 0.01).This large-series, nationwide cohort study demonstrated that metformin use could significantly lower the risk of all-cause mortality in patients with T2DM and either stable or exacerbated COPD."
https://openalex.org/W2895699363,"This paper describes an approach for improving the accuracy of memory-based collaborative filtering, based on the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. Recommender systems are used to filter the huge amount of data available online based on user-defined preferences. Collaborative filtering (CF) is a commonly used recommendation approach that generates recommendations based on correlations among user preferences. Although several enhancements have increased the accuracy of memory-based CF through the development of improved similarity measures for finding successful neighbors, there has been less investigation into prediction score methods, in which rating/preference scores are assigned to items that have not yet been selected by a user. A TOPSIS solution for evaluating multiple alternatives based on more than one criterion is proposed as an alternative to prediction score methods for evaluating and ranking items based on the results from similar users. The recommendation accuracy of the proposed TOPSIS technique is evaluated by applying it to various common CF baseline methods, which are then used to analyze the MovieLens 100K and 1M benchmark datasets. The results show that CF based on the TOPSIS method is more accurate than baseline CF methods across a number of common evaluation metrics."
https://openalex.org/W2895296217,"Migration and Invasion Enhancer (MIEN1) is an oncogene which is involved in facilitating motility of cancer cells through actin dynamics and gene expression. Increased MIEN1 expression in many types of tumors leads to disease progression and metastatic propensity. It is unclear precisely how MIEN1 is involved in this process and more studies are required to tease out the mechanisms. Here we show that Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR) genome editing effectively produced specific genomic deletions in the MIEN1 gene which led to the abrogation of its expression in breast cancer cells. The single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) mediated targeting of MIEN1 was specific and none of the clones screened for off-target cleavage revealed any insertions or deletions (indels). Additionally, disruption of the MIEN1 gene did not alter the cell morphology, growth, proliferation or survival. Knocking out MIEN1 in these breast cancer cells will allow future studies to determine the exact role MIEN1 plays in breast tumor metastasis, which might lead to production of novel therapeutics to treat this and other cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2895312275,"Aim Health-related quality of life is impaired in patients with autoimmune hepatitis, but the association between health-related quality of life and patients’ backgrounds remains unknown. We assessed health-related quality of life in patients with autoimmune hepatitis and identified factors associated with its impairment. Methods We assessed health-related quality of life in patients with autoimmune hepatitis, patients with chronic hepatitis C, and healthy subjects using the Japanese version of the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire and the 36-Item Short Form Survey. We compared health-related quality of life in patients with autoimmune hepatitis with that of patients with chronic hepatitis C and healthy subjects. Results A total of 265 patients with autoimmune hepatitis, 88 patients with chronic hepatitis C, and 97 healthy subjects were enrolled; most patients were women. The median ages of patients were 65, 66, and 57 years, respectively. Of these patients with autoimmune hepatitis, 10.6% and 57.0% had cirrhosis and comorbid diseases, respectively. The overall Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire scores (5.5 vs. 6.2, P < 0.001) and physical (48.1 vs. 54.2, P < 0.001) and mental (51.8 vs. 55.0, P = 0.004) component summaries of 36-Item Short Form Survey were significantly lower in patients with autoimmune hepatitis than in healthy subjects, and similar to scores in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Having cirrhosis, comorbid diseases, and treatment for autoimmune hepatitis were associated with impaired health-related quality of life among patients with autoimmune hepatitis. In particular, prednisolone use was associated with lower scores on the worry domain of the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire. Conclusions Patients with autoimmune hepatitis showed impairment in health-related quality of life, which was associated with not only disease progression, but also comorbid diseases and treatment. Ways to improve health-related quality of life should be considered in patients with AIH when disease outcome is not favorable and when using prednisolone."

Sixty female dogs were included in this study, all of which had histopathological diagnosis of MC-BMT and were divided into three groups: G1 (control), consisting of animals submitted only to mastectomy with or without regional metastasis; G2, composed of treated animals that did not present with metastasis; and G3, treated dogs that presented with metastasis. G2 and G3 were also subdivided according to the treatment administered: chemotherapy alone (MC-BMT(-) C/MC-BMT(+) C) or LDN and chemotherapy (MC-BMT(-) C+LDN/MC-BMT(+) C+LDN). All animals were subjected to clinical evaluation, mastectomy, peripheral blood lymphocyte immunophenotyping, beta-endorphin and met-enkephalin quantification, and evaluation of survival rates and quality of life scores. The results showed higher serum concentrations of beta-endorphin and met-enkephalin, fewer chemotherapy-related side effects, and better quality of life and survival rates in the LDN-treated groups than in LDN-untreated groups (P < 0.05). Evaluation of clinical and pathological parameters indicated a significant association between the use of LDN and both prolonged survival and enhanced quality of life. These results indicate that LDN is a viable chemotherapy-associated treatment in female dogs with MC-BMT, maintaining their quality of life and prolonging survival rates."
https://openalex.org/W2894564370,"Testes of seasonally breeding species experience a severe functional regression before the non-breeding period, which implies a substantial mass reduction due to massive germ-cell depletion. Two alternative mechanisms of seasonal germ-cell depletion have been described in mammals, apoptosis and desquamation (sloughing), but their prevalence has not been determined yet due to reduced number of species studied. We performed a morphological, hormonal, and molecular study of the mechanism of seasonal testicular regression in males of the Egyptian long eared-hedgehog (Hemiechinus auritus). Our results show that live, non-apoptotic, germ cells are massively depleted by desquamation during the testis regression process. This is concomitant with both decreased levels of serum testosterone and irregular distribution of the cell-adhesion molecules in the seminiferous epithelium. The inactive testes maintain some meiotic activity as meiosis onset is not halted and spermatocytes die by apoptosis at the pachytene stage. Our data support the notion that apoptosis is not the major testis regression effector in mammals. Instead, desquamation appears to be a common mechanism in this class."
https://openalex.org/W2894839075,"Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most frequent skin diseases. Changes of the keratinocytes functionality play a major role in the development of AD. For example, activation of the Fas (CD95)/FasL (CD178) pathway in AD does not lead to extensive apoptosis in skin. Binding of the Fas receptor to its protein ligand—FasL, which are present on the (AD)-modified keratinocytes, should result in the sequential induction of cell death, but there is no evidence of extensive apoptosis of these cells. This suggests that non-apoptotic mechanism of Fas/FasL pathway is commonly encountered, although not examined in the case of AD, phenomenon. An electromagnetic field, which was used to influence cultured cells in this study, can modulate proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and metabolism in various cells. Objective Here, we evaluate the possibility to manipulate the immune activation of AD keratinocytes and their response to the electromagnetic field, which was not tested before. Methods Keratinocytes isolated from the skin of healthy subjects (n = 20) and patients with atopic dermatitis (n = 20) as well as HaCaT and PCS-200-010 cell were exposed to the 900 MHz electromagnetic field for 60 minutes. Cytometric analysis of viability, Fas/FasL, p-ERK, p-p38 and p-JNK expression and Luminex analysis of cytokine concentration were performed in two-time points: 4 and 24 hours after the exposition. Results This research has shown upregulated Fas, FasL, p-ERK, p-p38, and p-JNK expression along with increased cytokine secretion (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-31 and TNFα) by keratinocytes derived from the skin of patients with the AD when compared with healthy control. Exposure of keratinocyte cultures obtained from AD patients to EMF resulted in a decrease of 1β, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, I L-13, IL-17, IL-31 and TNFα levels. Keratinocytes derived from the skin of AD patients are characterized by elevated Fas and FasL expression when compared to healthy control. Conclusion Apoptotic and nonapoptotic activation of the Fas/FasL-dependent signaling pathway may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD, by adjusting the local cytokine and chemokine environment at the site of inflammation. Moreover, the electromagnetic field exhibits strong immunomodulatory effects on AD-modified keratinocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2894921076,"Insect growth is influenced by two major environmental factors: temperature and nutrient. These environmental factors are internally mediated by insulin/insulin-like growth factor signal (IIS) to coordinate tissue or organ growth. Maruca vitrata, a subtropical lepidopteran insect, migrates to different climate regions and feeds on various crops. The objective of this study was to determine molecular tools to predict growth rate of M. vitrata using IIS components. Four genes [insulin receptor (InR), Forkhead Box O (FOXO), Target of Rapamycin (TOR), and serine-threonine protein kinase (Akt)] were used to correlate their expression levels with larval growth rates under different environmental conditions. The functional association of IIS and larval growth was confirmed because RNA interference of these genes significantly decreased larval growth rate and pupal weight. Different rearing temperatures altered expression levels of these four IIS genes and changed their growth rate. Different nutrient conditions also significantly changed larval growth and altered expression levels of IIS components. Different local populations of M. vitrata exhibited significantly different larval growth rates under the same nutrient and temperature conditions along with different expression levels of IIS components. Under a constant temperature (25°C), larval growth rates showed significant correlations with IIS gene expression levels. Subsequent regression formulas of expression levels of four IIS components against larval growth rate were applied to predict growth patterns of M. vitrata larvae reared on different natural hosts and natural local populations reared on the same diet. All four formulas well predicted larval growth rates with some deviations. These results indicate that the IIS expression analysis explains the growth variation at the same temperature due to nutrient and genetic background."
https://openalex.org/W2895012824,"The liverwort Marchantia polymorpha is an emerging model species for basal lineage plant research. In this study, two Gateway cloning-compatible binary vector series, R4pMpGWB and R4L1pMpGWB, were generated to facilitate production of transgenic M. polymorpha. The R4pMpGWB series allows tripartite recombination of any promoter and any coding sequence with a specific reporter or tag. Reporters/tags for the R4pMpGWB series are GUS, ELuc(PEST), FLAG, 3×HA, 4×Myc, mRFP1, Citrine, mCitrine, ER-targeted mCitrine and nucleus-targeted mCitrine. The R4L1pMpGWB series is suitable for promoter analysis. R4L1pMpGWB vector structure is the same as that of R4pMpGWB vectors, except that the attR2 site is replaced with attL1, enabling bipartite recombination of any promoter with a reporter or tag. Reporters/tags for the R4L1pMpGWB series are GUS, G3GFP-GUS, LUC, ELuc(PEST), Citrine, mCitrine, ER-targeted mCitrine and mCitrine-NLS. Both vector series were functional in M. polymorpha cells. These vectors will facilitate the design and assembly of plasmid constructs and generation of transgenic M. polymorpha."
https://openalex.org/W2895460550,"Objectives The beneficial application of three-dimensional (3D) printing for surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) has never been proposed in the literature before. The aim of this study was to verify patients’ surgical outcomes when utilizing preoperative three-dimensional printing for SSRF. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the records of all consecutive patients who were treated at our hospital for SSRF from July 2015 to December 2017. The patients were divided into two groups according to whether or not 3D printing was utilized. Results Forty-eight patients who underwent SSRF at our hospital were enrolled. Of them, three patients underwent bilateral surgeries. The patients with application of preoperative 3D printing for SSRF had statistically significant associations with shorter operation time per fixed plate (p < 0.001), and a smaller incision length (p < 0.001). Conclusions We present an useful technique involving 3D printing for promoting SSRF significantly with shorter operation time and an appropriate incision length."
https://openalex.org/W2894724525,"European brown hare, Lepus europaeus, from Central and Eastern European countries (Hungary, Poland, Serbia, Lithuania, Romania, Georgia and Italy) were sampled, and phylogenetic analyses were carried out on two datasets: 1.) 137 sequences (358 bp) of control region mtDNA; and 2.) 105 sequences of a concatenated fragment (916 bp), including the cytochrome b, tRNA-Thr, tRNA-Pro and control region mitochondrial DNA. Our sequences were aligned with additional brown hare sequences from GenBank. A total of 52 and 51 haplotypes were detected within the two datasets, respectively, and assigned to two previously described major lineages: Anatolian/Middle Eastern (AME) and European (EUR). Furthermore, the European lineage was divided into two subclades including South Eastern European (SEE) and Central European (CE). Sympatric distribution of the lineages of the brown hare in South-Eastern and Eastern Europe revealed contact zones there. BAPS analysis assigned sequences from L. europaeus to five genetic clusters, whereas CE individuals were assigned to only one cluster, and AME and SEE sequences were each assigned to two clusters. Our findings uncover numerous novel haplotypes of Anatolian/Middle Eastern brown hare outside their main range, as evidence for the combined influence of Late Pleistocene climatic fluctuations and anthropogenic activities in shaping the phylogeographic structure of the species. Our results support the hypothesis of a postglacial brown hare expansion from Anatolia and the Balkan Peninsula to Central and Eastern Europe, and suggest some slight introgression of individual haplotypes from L. timidus to L. europaeus."
https://openalex.org/W2895485789,"Tephritid fruit flies are ranked as one of the most damaging groups of insect pests. Morphological identification of fruit flies is mainly performed on adults due to the lack of adequate identification keys for immature stages. The peach fruit fly, Bactrocera zonata (Saunders), infests some of the principal commercial fruits and vegetables. It is, therefore important to avert its global dispersal, particularly by accurately identifying this species at ports of entry. In this study, a TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed for the accurate identification and sensitive detection of the peach fruit fly. A novel set of primers and probe were designed to specifically identify the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene. All specimens of peach fruit fly (including various life stages) were detected, and no cross reactivity with other tested tephritids were observed. Since this assay performed equally well with crushed insects and purified DNA, we note added efficiency by eliminating DNA extraction step. Considering the speed, specificity as well as sensitivity of the assay, Taqman real-time PCR can be used as a swift and specific method for pest species at ports of entry."
https://openalex.org/W2894649551,"The antinociceptive effects of the carbon monoxide-releasing molecule tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer (CORM-2) during chronic pain are well documented, but most of its possible side-effects remain poorly understood. In this work, we examine the impact of CORM-2 treatment on the lipoprotein profile and two main atheroprotective functions attributed to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes while analyzing the effect of this drug on diabetic neuropathy. Streptozotocin (Stz)-induced diabetic mice treated with CORM-2 (Stz-CORM-2) or vehicle (Stz-vehicle) were used to evaluate the effect of this drug on the modulation of painful diabetic neuropathy using nociceptive behavioral tests. Plasma and tissue samples were used for chemical and functional analyses, as appropriate. Two main antiatherogenic properties of HDL, i.e., the ability of HDL to protect low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from oxidation and to promote reverse cholesterol transport from macrophages to the liver and feces in vivo (m-RCT), were also assessed. Stz-induced diabetic mice displayed hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and pain hypersensitivity. The administration of 10 mg/kg CORM-2 during five consecutive days inhibited allodynia and hyperalgesia and significantly ameliorated spinal cord markers (Cybb and Bdkrb1expression) of neuropathic pain in Stz mice, but it did not reduce the combined dyslipidemia shown in Stz-treated mice. Its administration to Stz-treated mice led to a significant increase in the plasma levels of cholesterol (∼ 1.4-fold vs. Ctrl, ∼ 1.3- fold vs. Stz-vehicle; p < 0.05) and was attributed to significant elevations in both non-HDL (∼ 1.8-fold vs. Ctrl; ∼ 1.6-fold vs. Stz-vehicle; p < 0.05) and HDL cholesterol (∼ 1.3-fold vs. Ctrl, ∼ 1.2-fold vs. Stz-vehicle; p < 0.05). The increased HDL in plasma was not accompanied by a commensurate elevation in m-RCT in Stz-CORM-2 compared to Stz-vehicle mice; instead, it was worsened as revealed by decreased [3H]-tracer trafficking into the feces in vivo. Furthermore, the HDL-mediated protection against LDL oxidation ex vivo shown by the HDL isolated from Stz-CORM-2 mice did not differ from that obtained in Stz-vehicle mice. In conclusion, the antinociceptive effects produced by a high dose of CORM-2 were accompanied by antioxidative effects but were without favorable effects on the dyslipidemia manifested in diabetic mice."
https://openalex.org/W2894869267,"Background Clinical reasoning is an important topic in healthcare training, assessment, and research. Virtual patients (VPs) are a safe environment to teach, assess and perform research on clinical reasoning and diagnostic accuracy. Our aim was to explore the details of the clinical reasoning process and diagnostic accuracy of undergraduate medical students when working with VPs using a concept mapping tool. Methods Over seven months we provided access to 67 German and 30 English VPs combined with a concept mapping tool to visualize and measure the clinical reasoning process of identifying problems, differential diagnoses, recommended tests and treatment options, and composing a summary statement about a VP. A final diagnosis had to be submitted by the learners in order to conclude the VP scenario. Learners were allowed multiple attempts or could request the correct diagnosis from the system. Results We analyzed 1,393 completed concept maps from 317 learners. We found significant differences between maps with a correct final diagnosis on one or multiple attempts and maps in which learners gave up and requested the solution from the system. These maps had lower scores, fewer summary statements, and fewer problems, differential diagnoses, tests, and treatments. Conclusions The different use patterns and scores between learners who had the correct final diagnosis on one or multiple attempts and those who gave up, indicate that diagnostic accuracy in the form of a correct final diagnosis on the first attempt has to be reconsidered as a sole indicator for clinical reasoning competency. For the training, assessment, and research of clinical reasoning we suggest focusing more on the details of the process to reach a correct diagnosis, rather than whether it was made in the first attempt."
https://openalex.org/W2895619215,"Background Impairment of neurovascular coupling (NVC) was recently reported in the context of subarachnoid hemorrhage and may correlate with disease severity and outcome. However, previous techniques to evaluate NVC required invasive procedures. Retinal vessels may represent an alternative option for non-invasive assessment of NVC. Methods A prototype of an adapted retinal vessel analyzer was used to assess retinal vessel diameter in mice. Dynamic vessel analysis (DVA) included an application of monochromatic flicker light impulses in predefined frequencies for evaluating NVC. All retinae were harvested after DVA and electroretinograms were performed. Results A total of 104 retinal scans were conducted in 21 male mice (90 scans). Quantitative arterial recordings were feasible only in a minority of animals, showing an emphasized reaction to flicker light impulses (8 mice; 14 scans). A characteristic venous response to flicker light, however, could observed in the majority of animals. Repeated measurements resulted in a significant decrease of baseline venous diameter (7 mice; 7 scans, p < 0.05). Ex-vivo electroretinograms, performed after in-vivo DVA, demonstrated a significant reduction of transretinal signaling in animals with repeated DVA (n = 6, p < 0.001). Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-invasive study assessing murine retinal vessel response to flicker light with characteristic changes in NVC. The imaging system can be used for basic research and enables the investigation of retinal vessel dimension and function in control mice and genetically modified animals."
https://openalex.org/W2894629211,"Wetland loss and degradation have been extensive across the world, especially in California’s Central Valley where over 90% of the natural wetlands have been converted to agricultural and urban uses. In the Central Valley today, a much smaller network of managed wetlands and flooded agricultural fields supports almost five million waterfowl and half a million shorebirds. Over 50% of waterbird habitat in the Central Valley is provided by flooded agricultural land, primarily rice (Oryza sativa). Each year non-breeding waterbird habitat decreases in the late winter as flooded agricultural fields are drained after waterfowl hunting season in late-January to prepare for the next crop. This study evaluated a practice called ‘variable drawdown’ that involves delaying the removal of water from rice fields by 1, 2, and 3 weeks to extend the availability of flooded habitat later into February and March. We studied waterbird response to variable drawdown in 2012 and 2013 at twenty rice farms throughout the northern half of the Central Valley. The staggered drawdown created a mosaic of water depths throughout the six-week study period. The 3-week delay in drawdown supported more dabbling ducks than earlier drawdowns in the first half of the study and more shorebirds and long-legged wading birds during the second half of the study. The timing of highest use of each drawdown treatment differed for each waterbird guild; dabbling ducks, geese and swans benefited at the beginning, then long-legged wading birds, followed by shorebirds. Despite the presence of appropriate water depths for shorebirds across the treatments during the entire study period, shorebird densities were highest near the end of the study when the 3-week-delayed drawdown was providing the majority of the habitat on the landscape. This suggests that shorebirds may have concentrated in our study fields due to decreasing availability of shallow water habitat elsewhere. The practice of variable drawdown successfully extended the availability of waterbird habitat provided by post-harvest flooded rice fields later into winter."
https://openalex.org/W2895059326,"This study describes the successful synthesis of nitric oxide (NO)-releasing compounds with biodegradable and injectable properties and demonstrates that the kinetics of NO release vary according to the type of NO donor. The antimicrobial activity of NO-releasing compounds against three common periodontal pathogens, i.e., Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Actinomyces israelii, was investigated using a susceptibility assay. Human gingival fibroblasts were treated with NO-releasing compounds at the minimum concentrations required for bacterial growth and cytotoxicity was evaluated using the MTT cell proliferation assay. Our results suggest that NO-releasing compounds can be used topically to treat both gram-negative and gram-positive periodontal pathogens. Comparison of the antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity assay results between the NO-releasing compounds revealed that an NO donor comprising a macromolecule without surface charge, a lower instantaneous NO concentration, and an adequate supply of NO were associated with a strong bactericidal effect and low cytotoxicity. NO-releasing compounds with these properties may be suitable for treatment of periodontitis."
https://openalex.org/W2894820057,"Previous behavioural studies demonstrate that face caricaturing can provide an effective image enhancement method for improving poor face identity perception in low vision simulations (e.g., age-related macular degeneration, bionic eye). To translate caricaturing usefully to patients, assignment of the multiple face landmark points needed to produce the caricatures needs to be fully automatised. Recent development in computer science allows automatic face landmark detection of 68 points in real time and in multiple viewpoints. However, previous demonstrations of the behavioural effectiveness of caricaturing have used higher-precision caricatures with 147 landmark points per face, assigned by hand. Here, we test the effectiveness of the auto-assigned 68-point caricatures. We also compare this to the hand-assigned 147-point caricatures.We assessed human perception of how different in identity pairs of faces appear, when veridical (uncaricatured), caricatured with 68-points, and caricatured with 147-points. Across two experiments, we tested two types of low-vision images: a simulation of blur, as experienced in macular degeneration (testing two blur levels); and a simulation of the phosphenised images seen in prosthetic vision (at three resolutions).The 68-point caricatures produced significant improvements in identity discrimination relative to veridical. They were approximately 50% as effective as the 147-point caricatures.Realistic translation to patients (e.g., via real time caricaturing with the enhanced signal sent to smart glasses or visual prosthetic) is approaching feasibility. For maximum effectiveness software needs to be able to assign landmark points tracing out all details of feature and face shape, to produce high-precision caricatures."
https://openalex.org/W2894737910,"Background Using HIV proviral DNA as a template may be suitable for initial detection of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRMs) as it is easy to handle and less expensive compared to RNA. However, existing literatures which are mainly focused on HIV-1B subtypes DNA extracted from PBMCs revealed controversial findings ranging from the detection of significantly lower or higher mutations in proviral DNA compared to historic viral RNA. Thus, to verify whether viral RNA or proviral DNA has improved sensitivity in detecting transmitted genotypic drug resistance mutations paired viral RNA and proviral DNA (which is directly extracted from stored whole blood) samples were tested from Ethiopian antiretroviral naive HIV-1C infected subjects. Methods In the present comparative study the frequency of TDR mutations was assessed in paired samples of viral RNA and proviral DNA (extracted directly from stored whole blood) of HIV-1C infected treatment naïve patients and interpreted using the 2009 WHO drug resistance surveillance mutation lists, Stanford University drug resistance data base and International Antiviral Society-USA mutation lists. Results High agreement in rate of TDR between the two compartments was observed using the WHO mutation lists. While mutations G190A and E138A were concurrently found in both compartments, others such as G73S on PR and A62V, M184I, M230I on RT were identified in proviral DNA only. All signature mutations seen in viral RNA were not missed in proviral DNA. Conclusions The concordance of major genotype drug resistance mutation between RNA and proviral DNA in treatment naïve patients suggests that proviral DNA might be an alternative approaches for an initial assessment of drug resistance prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy using the WHO mutations lists in resource-limited countries. However, the clinical importance of TDRMs observed only in proviral DNA in terms of being a risk factor for virologic failure and whether they limit future treatment options needs additional investigation using more sensitive sequencing approaches such as Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)."

Untrained wheelchair service providers may provide inappropriate wheelchairs and services which result in negative consequences in wheelchair users' health, quality of life, safety, and social participation. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of the Spanish Hybrid Course on Basic Wheelchair Service Provision, a training based on the World Health Organization's Wheelchair Service Training Program-Basic Level, to increase knowledge in basic level wheelchair service provision among a group of wheelchair service providers from Colombia. In addition, we developed a satisfaction survey which participants completed after the training to understand levels of satisfaction with the training intervention.A quasi-experimental study was conducted to evaluate changes in basic level wheelchair knowledge using the Wheelchair Service Provision-Basic Test. Paired sample t tests were used to assess pre-and post-training changes in basic level wheelchair knowledge. The Hybrid Satisfaction Survey was developed in collaboration with a multidisciplinary, international stakeholders' group. The survey's construct of interest was level of satisfaction determined by interaction, instructor, instruction methodology, content, and technology, using a five-point Likert scale (0 = strongly disagree to 4 = strongly agree). The survey was completed anonymously after the training intervention and analyzed using frequencies and percentages.Fifteen wheelchair service providers in Colombia completed the Spanish Hybrid Course. Mean post-scores were significantly higher (Mean (M) = 56.13, Standard Deviation (SD) = 7.8), than pre-assessment scores (M = 50.07, SD = 8.38, t(14) = 4.923, p = <0.0001). Participants who completed the surveys (N = 15) reported that the Spanish Hybrid Course was well received, with 98.66% of responses distributed in favorable levels (>3).The Spanish Hybrid Course proved to be effective in increasing basic level wheelchair knowledge with a high satisfaction level among participants. Further testing is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this course across different individuals and countries as a potential tool to build professional capacity in basic level wheelchair provision."
https://openalex.org/W2895326945,"Episodic memories have been suggested to be represented by neuronal sequences, which are stored and retrieved from the hippocampal circuit. A special difficulty is that realistic neuronal sequences are strongly correlated with each other since computational memory models generally perform poorly when correlated patterns are stored. Here, we study in a computational model under which conditions the hippocampal circuit can perform this function robustly. During memory encoding, CA3 sequences in our model are driven by intrinsic dynamics, entorhinal inputs, or a combination of both. These CA3 sequences are hetero-associated with the input sequences, so that the network can retrieve entire sequences based on a single cue pattern. We find that overall memory performance depends on two factors: the robustness of sequence retrieval from CA3 and the circuit’s ability to perform pattern completion through the feedforward connectivity, including CA3, CA1 and EC. The two factors, in turn, depend on the relative contribution of the external inputs and recurrent drive on CA3 activity. In conclusion, memory performance in our network model critically depends on the network architecture and dynamics in CA3."
https://openalex.org/W2952745275,"Adverse drug reactions, also called side effects, range from mild to fatal clinical events and significantly affect the quality of care. Among other causes, side effects occur when drugs bind to proteins other than their intended target. As experimentally testing drug specificity against the entire proteome is out of reach, we investigate the application of chemogenomics approaches. We formulate the study of drug specificity as a problem of predicting interactions between drugs and proteins at the proteome scale. We build several benchmark datasets, and propose NN-MT, a multi-task Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm that is trained on a limited number of data points, in order to solve the computational issues or proteome-wide SVM for chemogenomics. We compare NN-MT to different state-of-the-art methods, and show that its prediction performances are similar or better, at an efficient calculation cost. Compared to its competitors, the proposed method is particularly efficient to predict (protein, ligand) interactions in the difficult double-orphan case, i.e. when no interactions are previously known for the protein nor for the ligand. The NN-MT algorithm appears to be a good default method providing state-of-the-art or better performances, in a wide range of prediction scenario that are considered in the present study: proteome-wide prediction, protein family prediction, test (protein, ligand) pairs dissimilar to pairs in the train set, and orphan cases."
https://openalex.org/W2894685657,"Objective Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is aimed mainly at reducing pain and restoring mobility. However, mobility deficits can persist even longer than 1 year. The trunk function and movement velocity of any region have been recently recognized to be critical for determining mobility in older people. Therefore, the main goal of this quasi-randomized trial is to clarify the effectiveness of a novel training method, the seated side tapping (SST) training, for improving mobility by focusing on movement velocity of trunk function in the short term after TKA. Methods SST training consists of side trunk movements repeated as quickly as possible in a seated position. All participants after TKA were randomly assigned to the SST training group (n = 37) or control training group (n = 38). The participants in the SST group performed SST training plus the standard rehabilitation program 5 days per week for 3 weeks after TKA, while the control group performed only the standard rehabilitation programs. The primary outcome was the effect of SST training on mobility, indicated by gait speed and the timed up and go test (TUG) time. Measurements were performed before and 1, 2, and 3 weeks after surgery. Results At all-time points, the patients in the SST group showed significantly better mobility, despite that knee function, represented by muscle strength, range of motion, and degree of pain at the knee joint, was similar in both groups. The difference in gait speed between the groups was >0.1 m/s at all time points, which is clinically significant. Conclusion SST training significantly improved patients’ mobility within 3 weeks after TKA, despite that no additional benefit was observed in knee function. The findings in this study indicate that SST training may be considered as a part of the rehabilitation program after TKA, although further evaluation of its long-term effectiveness is needed.

https://openalex.org/W2894609917,"The association of BRCA1/2 mutations with melanoma is not completely determined; the interpretation of variants of unknown significance is also problematic. To evaluate these issues we explored the molecular basis of melanoma risk by performing whole-exome sequencing on a cohort of 96 unrelated Polish early-onset melanoma patients and targeted sequencing of BRCA1/2 genes on additional 30 melanoma patients with familial aggregation of breast and other cancers. Sequencing was performed on peripheral blood. We evaluated MutationTaster, Polyphen2, SIFT, PROVEAN algorithms, analyzed segregation with cancer disease (in both families with identified BRCA2 variants) and in one family performed LOH (based on 2 primary tumors). We found neither pathogenic mutations nor variants of unknown significance within BRCA1. We identified two BRCA2 variants of unknown significance: c.9334G>A and c.4534 C>T. Disease allele frequency was evaluated by genotyping of 1230 consecutive melanoma cases, 5000 breast cancer patients, 3500 prostate cancers and 9900 controls. Both variants were found to be absent among unselected cancer patients and healthy controls. The MutationTaster, Polyphen2 and SIFT algorithms indicate that c.9334G>A is a damaging variant. Due to lack of tumour tissue LOH analysis could not be performed for this variant. The variant segregated with the disease. The c.4534 C>T variant did not segregate with disease, there was no LOH of the variant. The c.9334G>A variant, classified as a rare variant of unknown significance, on current evidence may predisposes to cancers of the breast, prostate and melanoma. Functional studies to describe how the DNA change affects the protein function and a large multi-center study to evaluate its penetrance are required."

We thus did a randomised non-inferiority trial to test the hypothesis that a tube lubricated with water does not reduce sore throat after tracheal intubation.We randomized female or male patients (n = 296) undergoing surgery in the ears or eyes to receive either a tube lubricated with water or a tube without lubrication for intubation. We assessed sore throat at 0, 2, 4, and 24 h after surgery; pharyngeal injury at 2 and 24 h after surgery; and respiratory infections within 7 days after surgery. For the incidence of sore throat within 24 h after surgery (primary outcome), the two-sided 90% confidence interval of the risk difference was compared with the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 15%. Other outcomes were analyzed with two-sided superiority tests.The incidence of sore throat within 24 h after surgery was 80/147 (54.4%) in the non-lubricated tube group and 83/149 (55.7%) in the water-lubricated tube group (risk difference -1.3%, 90% confidence interval -10.9% to 8.3%). Because the confidence interval was below the non-inferiority margin, the incidence of sore throat was not higher in the non-lubricated tube group than in the water-lubricated tube group. There was no significant association between groups in the sore throat, pharyngeal injury, and respiratory infection at each assessment time.The tube lubricated with water did not reduce sore throat and pharyngeal injury after tracheal intubation compared to the tube without lubrication."
https://openalex.org/W2895180522,"During the process of synapse formation, thousands of proteins assemble at prospective sites of cell-cell communication. Although many of these proteins have been identified, the roles they play in generating functional connections during development remain unknown. 4.1 scaffolding proteins have been implicated in synapse formation and maturation in vitro, but in vivo studies for some family members have suggested these proteins are not important for this role. We examined the role of family member 4.1B because it has been implicated in glutamatergic synaptogenesis, but has not been described in vivo. We identified two 4.1B genes in zebrafish, 4.1Ba and 4.1Bb, by sequence comparisons and synteny analysis. In situ hybridization shows these genes are differentially expressed, with 4.1Ba expressed primarily in the nervous system and 4.1Bb expressed in the nervous system and muscle, but not the spinal cord. We focused our studies on 4.1Ba in the spinal cord. 4.1Ba knockdown reduced the number of glutamatergic synapses at caudal primary motor neurons and caused an increase in the duration of touch-evoked coiling. These results suggest 4.1Ba is important for the formation of functional glutamatergic synapses in the developing zebrafish spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W2895755308,"Experiments have shown that the relaxation phase of cardiac sarcomeres during an isometric twitch is prolonged in muscles that reached a higher peak tension. However, the mechanism is not completely understood. We hypothesize that the binding of calcium to troponin is enhanced by the tension in the thin filament, thus contributing to the prolongation of contraction upon higher peak tension generation. To test this hypothesis, we developed a computational model of sarcomere mechanics that incorporates tension-dependence of calcium binding. The model was used to simulate isometric twitch experiments with time dependency in the form of a two-state cross-bridge cycle model and a transient intracellular calcium concentration. In the simulations, peak isometric twitch tension appeared to increase linearly by 51.1 KPa with sarcomere length from 1.9 μm to 2.2 μm. Experiments showed an increase of 47.3 KPa over the same range of sarcomere lengths. The duration of the twitch also increased with both sarcomere length and peak intracellular calcium concentration, likely to be induced by the inherently coupled increase of the peak tension in the thin filament. In the model simulations, the time to 50% relaxation (tR50) increased over the range of sarcomere lengths from 1.9 μm to 2.2 μm by 0.11s, comparable to the increased duration of 0.12s shown in experiments. Model simulated tR50 increased by 0.12s over the range of peak intracellular calcium concentrations from 0.87 μM to 1.45 μM. Our simulation results suggest that the prolongation of contraction at higher tension is a result of the tighter binding of Ca2+ to troponin in areas under higher tension, thus delaying the deactivation of the troponin."
https://openalex.org/W2894688086,"Sodium-glucose transporters (SGLT) belong to the solute carrier 5 family, which is characterized by sodium dependent transport of sugars and other solutes. In contrast, the human SGLT3 (hSGLT3) isoform, encoded by SLC5A4, acts as a glucose sensor that does not transport sugar but induces membrane depolarization by Na+ currents upon ligand binding. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) of several extended pedigrees with high density of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) identified a triplet ATG deletion in SLC5A4 leading to a single amino acid loss (ΔM500) in the hSGLT3 protein imperfectly co-segregating with the clinical phenotype of ADHD. Since mutations in homologous domains of hSGLT1 and hSGLT2 were found to affect intestinal and renal function, respectively, we analyzed the functional properties of hSGLT3[wt] and [ΔM500] by voltage clamp and current clamp recordings from cRNA-injected Xenopus laevis oocytes. The cation conductance of hSGLT3[wt] was activated by application of glucose or the specific agonist 1-desoxynojirimycin (DNJ) as revealed by inward currents in the voltage clamp configuration and cell depolarization in the current clamp mode. Almost no currents and changes in membrane potential were observed when glucose or DNJ were applied to hSGLT3[ΔM500]-injected oocytes, demonstrating a loss of function by this amino acid deletion in hSGLT3. To monitor membrane targeting of wt and mutant hSGLT3, fusion constructs with YFP were generated, heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and analyzed for membrane fluorescence by confocal microscopy. In comparison to hSGLT3[wt] the fluorescent signal of mutant [ΔM500] was reduced by 43% indicating that the mutant phenotype might mainly result from inaccurate membrane targeting. As revealed by homology modeling, residue M500 is located in TM11 suggesting that in addition to the core structure (TM1-TM10) of the transporter, the surrounding TMs are equally crucial for transport/sensor function. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the deletion [ΔM500] in hSGLT3 inhibits membrane targeting and thus largely disrupts glucose-induced sodium conductance, which may, in interaction with other ADHD risk-related gene variants, influence the risk for ADHD in deletion carriers."
https://openalex.org/W2894709546,"T Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma 1A is expressed during B-cell differentiation and, when over-expressed, acts as an oncogene in mouse (Tcl1a) and human (TCL1A) B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL). Furthermore, in the murine system Tcl1a is expressed in the ovary, testis and in pre-implantation embryos, where it plays an important role in blastomere proliferation and in embryonic stem cell (ESC) proliferation and self-renewal. We have also observed that Tcl1-/- adult mice exhibit alopecia and deep ulcerations. This finding has led us to investigate the role of TCL1 in mouse skin and hair follicles. We have found that TCL1 is expressed in the proliferative structure (i.e. the secondary hair germ) and in the stem cell niche (i.e. the bulge) of the hair follicle during regeneration phase and it is constitutively expressed in the basal layer of epidermis where it is required for the correct proliferative–differentiation program of the keratinocytes (KCs). Taking advantage of the murine models we have generated, including the Tcl1-/- and the K14-TCL1 transgenic mouse, we have analysed the function of TCL1 in mouse KCs and the molecular pathways involved. We provide evidence that in the epidermal compartment TCL1 has a role in the regulation of KC proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In particular, the colony-forming efficiency (CFE) and the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)-induced proliferation are dramatically impaired, while apoptosis is increased, in KCs from Tcl1-/- mice when compared to WT. Moreover, the expression of differentiation markers such as cytokeratin 6 (KRT6), filaggrin (FLG) and involucrin (IVL) are profoundly altered in mutant mice (Tcl1-/-). Importantly, by over-expressing TCL1A in basal KCs of the K14-TCL1 transgenic mouse model, we observed a significant rescue of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of the mutant phenotype. Finally, we found TCL1 to act, at least in part, via increasing phospho-ERK1/2 and decreasing phospho-P38 MAPK. Hence, our data demonstrate that regulated levels of Tcl1a are necessary for the correct proliferation and differentiation of the interfollicular KCs."
https://openalex.org/W2895606481,"When people carry out cognitive tasks, they sometimes suffer from distractions, that is, drops in performance that occur close in time to task-irrelevant stimuli. In this research, we examine how the pursuit of rewards contributes to distractions. In two experiments, participants performed a math task (in which they could earn monetary rewards vs. not) while they were exposed to task-irrelevant stimuli (that were previously associated with monetary rewards vs. not). In Experiment 1, irrelevant cues that were previously associated with rewards (vs. not) impaired performance. In Experiment 2, this effect was only replicated when these reward-associated distractors appeared relatively early during task performance. While the results were thus somewhat mixed, they generally support the idea that reward associations can augment the negative effect of distractors on performance."
https://openalex.org/W3124574592,"This paper uses two nationally representative sets of medical claims data from medical assistance and universal public health insurance systems to examine how medical assistance system assignment affects short-term inpatient health care provision. In Japan, the medical assistance system, which is part of a public assistance system, provides medical care services for its beneficiaries without imposing any financial burdens, such as copayments or advance premium payments. These circumstances can lead to inpatient costs, as physicians may provide more treatments because there is a financial incentive. Because the assignment of public assistance in Japan is not random but is subject to means testing by the local government, I employ the instrumental variable model to control the potential correlation. I find that medical expenditure is significantly higher for medical assistance patients than for universal public health insurance patients, with an arc elasticity of approximately 0.20. This elasticity is slightly greater than that found for inpatient care in the randomized RAND Health Insurance Experiment and recent empirical studies on low-income populations. In addition, the elasticities for patients who receive medication, treatment and surgery are greater."
https://openalex.org/W2894821617,"After three national point prevalence studies (PPS) of healthcare associated infections (HAI) conducted in Serbian acute care hospitals using US (CDC/NHSN) surveillance definitions, Serbia is about to switch to European (ECDC) criteria for the purpose of the fourth HAI PPS. The aim of this study was to compare the US and the European HAI definitions in Serbian trauma intensive care unit (ICU). Prospective surveillance was performed at two surgical-trauma ICUs of the Emergency department of Clinical Center of Serbia. HAIs were prospectively diagnosed by experienced clinician and epidemiologists using both types of HAI definitions simultaneously. The level of agreement between two case definitions was assessed by Cohen's kappa statistic (k). Of 406 patients, 107 (26.3%) acquired at least one HAI (total of 107 according to US definitions and 141 according to European criteria). For microbiologically confirmed pneumonia agreement was k = 0.99 (95% CI, 0.96-1.00) and for clinically defined k = 0.86 (95% CI, 0.58-1.00). Agreement for bloodstream infections (BSI) was 0.79 (CI 95%, 0.70-0.89). When secondary BSI was excluded from the European classification, (30.9% of all BSI), concordance was k = 1.00 and when microbiologically confirmed catheter related BSI were reported separately as recommended by latest ECDC protocol update, (20.0% of all BSI), concordance was 0.60 (CI 95%, 0.41-0.80). No agreement was found between CLABSI and CRI while slight agreement was found when compared CLABSI and CRI3 (k = 0.11; 95%CI, 0.0-0.22). Agreement for overall UTI was moderate (k = 0.66; 95%CI, 0.53-0.79) while for microbiologically-confirmed symptomatic UTI was perfect (k = 1.00). For CAUTI good agreement was observed (k = 0.77; 95%CI, 0.34-1.0). Microbiological confirmation of PN and UTI should be stimulated and comparison of BSI should be done with emphasis on whether secondary BSI is included."
https://openalex.org/W2894911374,"The evolutionary conserved miR-125b is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) enhancing self-renewal and survival. Accordingly, over-expression of miR-125b in HSC may induce myeloproliferative neoplasms and leukemia with long latency. During hematopoietic cell maturation miR-125b expression decreases, and the function of miR-125b in mature granulocytes is not yet known. We here use transplantation of miR-125b over-expressing HSC into syngeneic hosts to generate and analyse miR-125b over-expressing granulocytes. Under steady state conditions, miR-125b over-expression inhibits granulocytic chemotaxis and LPS- but not PMA- and TNFα- induced cell death. Inflammatory signals modulate the effects of miR-125b over-expression as demonstrated in a sterile peritonitis and a polymicrobial sepsis model. In particular, survival of mice with miR-125b over-expressing granulocytes is significantly reduced as compared to controls in the polymicrobial sepsis model. These data demonstrate inflammation dependent effects of miR-125b in granulocytes and may point to therapeutic intervention strategies in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2895383722,"The presence of 'giant' synapses in the auditory brainstem is thought to be a specialization designed to encode temporal information to support perception of pitch, frequency, and sound-source localisation. These 'giant' synapses have been found in the ventral cochlear nucleus, the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body and the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus. An interpretation of these synapses as simple relays has, however, been challenged by the observation in the gerbil that the action potential frequently fails in the ventral cochlear nucleus. Given the prominence of these synapses it is important to establish whether this phenomenon is unique to the gerbil or can be observed in other species. Here we examine the responses of units, thought to be the output of neurons in receipt of 'giant' synaptic endings, in the ventral cochlear nucleus and the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body in the guinea pig. We found that failure of the action-potential component, recorded from cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus, occurred in ~60% of spike waveforms when recording spontaneous activity. In the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, we did not find evidence for action-potential failure. In the ventral cochlear nucleus action-potential failures transform the receptive field between input and output of bushy cells. Additionally, the action-potential failures result in ""non-primary-like"" temporal-adaptation patterns. This is important for computational models of the auditory system, which commonly assume the responses of ventral cochlear nucleus bushy cells are very similar to their ""primary like"" auditory-nerve-fibre inputs."
https://openalex.org/W2895605457,"There is growing recognition that with sympathetic management, plantation forests may contain more biodiversity than previously thought. However, the extent to which they may support bat populations is contentious. Many studies have demonstrated active avoidance of coniferous plantations and attributed this to the lack of available roost sites and low invertebrate density. In contrast, other work, carried out in plantation dominated landscapes have shown that certain bat species are able to exploit these areas. However, the extent to which bats use plantations for roosting and foraging, or simply move through the plantation matrix to access more favourable sites is unclear. We radio tracked female Pipistrellus pygmaeus over two summers to establish the extent to which individual bats use Sitka Spruce plantations in southern Scotland for foraging and roosting and assess the implications for felling operations on bats. Maternity roosts identified (n = 17) were in all in buildings and most were large (> 500 individuals). We found no evidence of bats roosting in mature Sitka Spruce crop trees, although several bats used roosts in old or dead beech and oak trees as an alternative to their main maternity roost. Home ranges were much larger (mean 9.6 ± 3.12 km2) than those reported from other studies (0.6-1.6 km2), and it is likely that roost availability rather than food abundance constrains P. pygmaeus use of Sitka Spruce plantations. At the landscape scale, most individuals selected coniferous habitats over other habitat types, covering large distances to access plantation areas, whilst at a local scale bats used forest tracks to access water, felled stands or patches of broadleaf cover within the plantation. Sitka Spruce plantations support a high abundance of Culicoides impuctatus, the Highland midge which may act as a reliable and plentiful food source for females during lactation, an energetically expensive period. The use of felled stands for foraging by bats has implications for forest management as wind turbines, following small-scale felling operations, are increasingly being installed in plantations; wind turbines have been associated with high bat mortality in some countries. Decisions about siting wind turbines in upland plantations should consider the likelihood of increased bat activity post felling."
https://openalex.org/W2895133160,"According to a symbolic perspective on EC, pairings constitute a relational contextual cue in the environment. It is the relationship between stimuli as cued by the pairing (i.e., pairings = similar) that determines the observed change in liking. Across five pre-registered studies (N = 747) we manipulated the absolute or relative distance between different pairs of conditioned (CS) and unconditioned stimuli (US) under the assumption that this would influence the type of relation that the pairings would cue (i.e., close = similar; far = different). In all five studies we obtained repeated and strong evidence that stimulus pairings led to changes in implicit and explicit evaluations. Although we found that these effects were moderated by absolute distance manipulations, evidence did not emerge indicating that those same effects were moderated by relative distance manipulations. These findings fail to provide strong support for a symbolic perspective on EC. We discuss the implications of our findings as well as future research in this area."
https://openalex.org/W2895590858,"There is scarce research on stress in Spanish police officers and on the use of instruments to assess this construct in this professional group. In Spain, the DECORE questionnaire has been one of the most used. Nevertheless, it had not been previously applied to police officers. The aim of this study was to analyze both the construct validity and the reliability of the original model of 44 items. A cross-sectional design and a non-probabilistic quota sampling were used. A total of 223 Spanish police officers participated. 202 police personnel were men (90.6%) and 21 were women (9.4%). The average age was 41 years old (SD = 7.52). These police officers answered the DECORE questionnaire. Confirmatory Factor Analysis was carried out. The results showed an unsatisfactory adjustment using the original model of 44 items. A final solution of 21 items and four factors was formulated with both suitable validity and reliability indexes. In this model, 23 items that did not weigh highly in any of the four factors were removed. The DECORE-21 questionnaire is recommended to assess work-related stress in police officers."
https://openalex.org/W2895172588,"In the human retina, rod and cone cells detect incoming light with a molecule called rhodopsin. After rhodopsin molecules are activated (by photon impact), these molecules activate the rest of the signalling process for a brief period of time until they are deactivated by a multistage process. First, active rhodopsin is phosphorylated multiple times. Following this, they are further inhibited by the binding of molecules called arrestins. Finally, they decay into opsins. The time required for each of these stages becomes progressively longer, and each stage further reduces the activity of rhodopsin. However, while this deactivation process itself is well researched, the roles of the above stages in signal (and image) processing are poorly understood. In this paper, we will show that the activity of rhodopsin molecules during the deactivation process can be described as the fractional integration of an incoming signal. Furthermore, we show how this affects an image; specifically, the effect of fractional integration in video and signal processing and how it reduces noise and the improves adaptability under different lighting conditions. Our experimental results provide a better understanding of vertebrate and human vision, and why the rods and cones of the retina differ from the light detectors in cameras."
