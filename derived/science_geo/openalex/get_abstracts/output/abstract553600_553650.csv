https://openalex.org/W2276275277,"The authors use recent probabilistic theories of neural computation to argue that confidence and certainty are not identical concepts. They propose precise mathematical definitions for both of these concepts and discuss putative neural representations. When facing uncertainty, adaptive behavioral strategies demand that the brain performs probabilistic computations. In this probabilistic framework, the notion of certainty and confidence would appear to be closely related, so much so that it is tempting to conclude that these two concepts are one and the same. We argue that there are computational reasons to distinguish between these two concepts. Specifically, we propose that confidence should be defined as the probability that a decision or a proposition, overt or covert, is correct given the evidence, a critical quantity in complex sequential decisions. We suggest that the term certainty should be reserved to refer to the encoding of all other probability distributions over sensory and cognitive variables. We also discuss strategies for studying the neural codes for confidence and certainty and argue that clear definitions of neural codes are essential to understanding the relative contributions of various cortical areas to decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2284106784,"The gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium is a highly regenerative tissue with the potential to provide a renewable source of insulin(+) cells after undergoing cellular reprogramming. Here, we show that cells of the antral stomach have a previously unappreciated propensity for conversion into functional insulin-secreting cells. Native antral endocrine cells share a surprising degree of transcriptional similarity with pancreatic β cells, and expression of β cell reprogramming factors in vivo converts antral cells efficiently into insulin(+) cells with close molecular and functional similarity to β cells. Induced GI insulin(+) cells can suppress hyperglycemia in a diabetic mouse model for at least 6 months and regenerate rapidly after ablation. Reprogramming of antral stomach cells assembled into bioengineered mini-organs in vitro yielded transplantable units that also suppressed hyperglycemia in diabetic mice, highlighting the potential for development of engineered stomach tissues as a renewable source of functional β cells for glycemic control."
https://openalex.org/W2283148898,"Peyronie's disease (PD) is a connective tissue disorder which can result in penile deformity. The prevalence of diagnosed PD in the United States (US) has been estimated to be 0.5% in adult males, but there is limited additional information comparing definitive and probable PD cases. We conducted a population-based survey to assess PD prevalence using a convenience-sample of adult men participating in the ResearchNow general population panel. Respondents were categorized according to PD status (definitive, probable, no PD) and segmented by US geographic region, education, and income levels. Of the 7,711 respondents, 57 (0.7%) had definitive PD while 850 (11.0%) had probable PD. Using univariate logistic regression modeling, older age (18-24 vs 24+) (OR = 0.721; 95% CI = 0.570,0.913), Midwest/Northeast/West geographic region (South vs Midwest/Northeast/West) (OR = 0.747; 95% CI = 0.646,0.864), and higher income level (<25K vs 25K+) (OR = 0.820; 95% CI = 0.673,0.997) were each significantly associated with reduced odds of having a definitive/probable PD diagnosis compared with no PD diagnosis. When all three variables were entered in a stepwise multivariable logistic regression, only age (OR = 0.642; 95% CI = 0.497, 0.828) and region (OR = 0.752; 95% CI = 0.647, 0.872) remained significant. This study is the first to report PD prevalence by geographic region and income, and it advocates that the prevalence of PD in the US may be higher than previously cited. Further, given the large discrepancy between definitive PD cases diagnosed by a physician and probable cases not diagnosed by a physician, much more needs to be done to raise awareness of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2274549869,"The globus pallidus externus (GP) is a nucleus of the basal ganglia (BG), containing GABAergic projection neurons that arborize widely throughout the BG, thalamus and cortex. Ongoing work seeks to map axonal projection patterns from GP cell types, as defined by their electrophysiological and molecular properties. Here we use transgenic mice and recombinant viruses to characterize parvalbumin expressing (PV+) GP neurons within the BG circuit. We confirm that PV+ neurons 1) make up ~40% of the GP neurons 2) exhibit fast-firing spontaneous activity and 3) provide the major axonal arborization to the STN and substantia nigra reticulata/compacta (SNr/c). PV+ neurons also innervate the striatum. Retrograde labeling identifies ~17% of pallidostriatal neurons as PV+, at least a subset of which also innervate the STN and SNr. Optogenetic experiments in acute brain slices demonstrate that the PV+ pallidostriatal axons make potent inhibitory synapses on low threshold spiking (LTS) and fast-spiking interneurons (FS) in the striatum, but rarely on spiny projection neurons (SPNs). Thus PV+ GP neurons are synaptically positioned to directly coordinate activity between BG input nuclei, the striatum and STN, and thalamic-output from the SNr."
https://openalex.org/W2276685233,"The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stål) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) is an invasive plant-feeding insect native to eastern Asia. This herbivore is highly polyphagous, feeding on and damaging diverse plants, including field crops, vegetables, tree fruits, and ornamentals. Woody ornamental plants provide early- and late-season resources for adults emerging from and returning to overwintering sites, as well as feeding and breeding sites for H. halys throughout the growing season. In this study, we quantify the use of diverse plants by H. halys in two commercial nurseries in Maryland, recording data on the abundance of egg masses, early and late instar nymphs, and adults over a three-year study period. Our specific goals were to provide a quantitative comparison of the use of diverse plant species and cultivated varieties, identify non-hosts that could be used to create landscapes refractory to H. halys, and determine whether the use of plants varied across life stages of H. halys or the taxonomic status of plants. We found broad use of diverse plants in this study, identifying 88 host plants used by all life stages of H. halys. We also highlight the 43 plant taxa that did not support any life stage of H. halys and are thus classified as non-hosts. Interestingly, some of these plants were congeners of highly-used plants, underscoring high intrageneric and intraspecific variation in the use of plants by this polyphagous herbivore. We discuss how the selective planting of non-hosts, especially gymnosperms, may aid in reducing the agricultural and nuisance pest status of this invasive insect."
https://openalex.org/W2278239307,"The rapidly growing car industry in China has led to an equally rapid expansion of monoculture rubber in many regions of South East Asia. Xishuangbanna, the second largest rubber planting area in China, located in the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot, supplies about 37% of the domestic natural rubber production. There, high income possibilities from rubber drive a dramatic expansion of monoculture plantations which poses a threat to natural forests. For the first time we mapped rubber plantations in and outside protected areas and their net present value for the years 1988, 2002 (Landsat, 30 m resolution) and 2010 (RapidEye, 5 m resolution). The purpose of our study was to better understand the pattern and dynamics of the expansion of rubber plantations in Xishuangbanna, as well as its economic prospects and conservation impacts. We found that 1) the area of rubber plantations was 4.5% of the total area of Xishuangbanna in 1988, 9.9% in 2002, and 22.2% in 2010; 2) rubber monoculture expanded to higher elevations and onto steeper slopes between 1988 and 2010; 3) the proportion of rubber plantations with medium economic potential dropped from 57% between 1988 and 2002 to 47% in 2010, while the proportion of plantations with lower economic potential had increased from 30% to 40%; and 4) nearly 10% of the total area of nature reserves within Xishuangbanna has been converted to rubber monoculture by 2010. On the basis of our findings, we conclude that the rapid expansion of rubber plantations into higher elevations, steeper terrain, and into nature reserves (where most of the remaining forests of Xishuangbanna are located) poses a serious threat to biodiversity and environmental services while not producing the expected economic returns. Therefore, it is essential that local governments develop long-term land use strategies for balancing economic benefits with environmental sustainability, as well as for assisting farmers with the selection of land suitable for rubber production."
https://openalex.org/W2287683834,"SLURP-1 is a secreted toxin-like Ly-6/uPAR protein found in epithelium, sensory neurons and immune cells. Point mutations in the slurp-1 gene cause the autosomal inflammation skin disease Mal de Meleda. SLURP-1 is considered an autocrine/paracrine hormone that regulates growth and differentiation of keratinocytes and controls inflammation and malignant cell transformation. The majority of previous studies of SLURP-1 have been made using fusion constructs containing, in addition to the native protein, extra polypeptide sequences. Here we describe the activity and pharmacological profile of a recombinant analogue of human SLURP-1 (rSLURP-1) differing from the native protein only by one additional N-terminal Met residue. rSLURP-1 significantly inhibited proliferation (up to ~ 40%, EC50 ~ 4 nM) of human oral keratinocytes (Het-1A cells). Application of mecamylamine and atropine,--non-selective inhibitors of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, respectively, and anti-α7-nAChRs antibodies revealed α7 type nAChRs as an rSLURP-1 target in keratinocytes. Using affinity purification from human cortical extracts, we confirmed that rSLURP-1 binds selectively to the α7-nAChRs. Exposure of Xenopus oocytes expressing α7-nAChRs to rSLURP-1 caused a significant non-competitive inhibition of the response to acetylcholine (up to ~ 70%, IC50 ~ 1 μM). It was shown that rSLURP-1 binds to α7-nAChRs overexpressed in GH4Cl cells, but does not compete with 125I-α-bungarotoxin for binding to the receptor. These findings imply an allosteric antagonist-like mode of SLURP-1 interaction with α7-nAChRs outside the classical ligand-binding site. Contrary to rSLURP-1, other inhibitors of α7-nAChRs (mecamylamine, α-bungarotoxin and Lynx1) did not suppress the proliferation of keratinocytes. Moreover, the co-application of α-bungarotoxin with rSLURP-1 did not influence antiproliferative activity of the latter. This supports the hypothesis that the antiproliferative activity of SLURP-1 is related to 'metabotropic' signaling pathway through α7-nAChR, that activates intracellular signaling cascades without opening the receptor channel."
https://openalex.org/W2414699309,"Demand for the commercial use of genetically modified (GM) crops has been increasing in light of the projected growth of world population to nine billion by 2050. A prerequisite of paramount importance for regulatory submissions is the rigorous safety assessment of GM crops. One of the components of safety assessment is molecular characterization at DNA level which helps to determine the copy number, integrity and stability of a transgene; characterize the integration site within a host genome; and confirm the absence of vector DNA. Historically, molecular characterization has been carried out using Southern blot analysis coupled with Sanger sequencing. While this is a robust approach to characterize the transgenic crops, it is both time- and resource-consuming. The emergence of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has provided highly sensitive and cost- and labor-effective alternative for molecular characterization compared to traditional Southern blot analysis. Herein, we have demonstrated the successful application of both whole genome sequencing and target capture sequencing approaches for the characterization of single and stacked transgenic events and compared the results and inferences with traditional method with respect to key criteria required for regulatory submissions."
https://openalex.org/W2287194416,"Recently, we reported that bisbenzylidine piperidone RA190 adducts to Cys-88 of the proteasome ubiquitin receptor hRpn13, triggering accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and endoplasmic reticulum stress-related apoptosis in various cancer cell lines. hRpn13 contains an N-terminal pleckstrin-like receptor for ubiquitin domain that binds ubiquitin and docks it into the proteasome as well as a C-terminal deubiquitinase adaptor (DEUBAD) domain that binds the deubiquitinating enzyme Uch37. Here we report that hRpn13 and Uch37 are required for proper cell cycle progression and that their protein knockdown leads to stalling at G0/G1. Moreover, serum-starved cells display reduced hRpn13 and Uch37 protein levels with hallmarks of G0/G1 stalling and recovery to their steady-state protein levels following release from nutrient deprivation. Interestingly, loss of hRpn13 correlates with a small but statistically significant reduction in Uch37 protein levels, suggesting that hRpn13 interaction may stabilize this deubiquitinating enzyme in human cells. We also find that RA190 treatment leads to a loss of S phase, suggesting a block of DNA replication, and G2 arrest by using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Uch37 deprivation further indicated a reduction of DNA replication and G0/G1 stalling. Overall, this work implicates hRpn13 and Uch37 in cell cycle progression, providing a rationale for their function in cellular proliferation and for the apoptotic effect of the hRpn13-targeting molecule RA190.

https://openalex.org/W2293460727,"Background The complications of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) are dependent on the presence of advanced fibrosis. Given the high prevalence of NAFLD in the US, the optimal evaluation of NAFLD likely involves triage by a primary care physician (PCP) with advanced disease managed by gastroenterologists. Methods We compared the cost-effectiveness of fibrosis risk-assessment strategies in a cohort of 10,000 simulated American patients with NAFLD performed in either PCP or referral clinics using a decision analytical microsimulation state-transition model. The strategies included use of vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE), the NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), combination testing with NFS and VCTE, and liver biopsy (usual care by a specialist only). NFS and VCTE performance was obtained from a prospective cohort of 164 patients with NAFLD. Outcomes included cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) and correct classification of fibrosis. Results Risk-stratification by the PCP using the NFS alone costs $5,985 per QALY while usual care costs $7,229/QALY. In the microsimulation, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000, the NFS alone in PCP clinic was the most cost-effective strategy in 94.2% of samples, followed by combination NFS/VCTE in the PCP clinic (5.6%) and usual care in 0.2%. The NFS based strategies yield the best biopsy-correct classification ratios (3.5) while the NFS/VCTE and usual care strategies yield more correct-classifications of advanced fibrosis at the cost of 3 and 37 additional biopsies per classification. Conclusion Risk-stratification of patients with NAFLD primary care clinic is a cost-effective strategy that should be formally explored in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2283114057,"Most proinflammatory actions of C-reactive protein (CRP) are only expressed following dissociation of its native pentameric assembly into monomeric form (mCRP). However, little is known about what underlies the greatly enhanced activities of mCRP. Here we show that a single sequence motif, i.e. cholesterol binding sequence (CBS; a.a. 35–47), is responsible for mediating the interactions of mCRP with diverse ligands. The binding of mCRP to lipoprotein component ApoB, to complement component C1q, to extracellular matrix components fibronectin and collagen, to blood coagulation component fibrinogen, and to membrane lipid component cholesterol, are all found to be markedly inhibited by the synthetic CBS peptide but not by other CRP sequences tested. Likewise, mutating CBS in mCRP also greatly impairs these interactions. Functional experiments further reveal that CBS peptide significantly reduces the effects of mCRP on activation of endothelial cells in vitro and on acute induction of IL-6 in mice. The potency and specificity of CBS are critically determined by the N-terminal residues Cys-36, Leu-37, and His-38; while the versatility of CBS appears to originate from its intrinsically disordered conformation polymorphism. Together, these data unexpectedly identify CBS as the major recognition site of mCRP and suggest that this motif may be exploited to tune the proinflammatory actions of mCRP."
https://openalex.org/W2294596645,"The peritumoral physical microenvironment consists of complex topographies that influence cell migration. Cell decision making, upon encountering anisotropic, physiologically relevant physical cues, has yet to be elucidated. By integrating microfabrication with cell and molecular biology techniques, we provide a quantitative and mechanistic analysis of cell decision making in a variety of well-defined physical microenvironments. We used MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma and HT1080 fibrosarcoma as cell models. Cell decision making after lateral confinement in 2-dimensional microcontact printed lines is governed by branch width at bifurcations. Cells confined in narrow feeder microchannels prefer to enter wider branches at bifurcations. In contrast, in feeder channels that are wider than the cell body, cells elongate along one side wall of the channel and are guided by contact with the wall to the contiguous branch channel independent of its width. Knockdown of β1-integrins or inhibition of cellular contractility suppresses contact guidance. Concurrent, but not individual, knockdown of nonmuscle myosin isoforms IIA and IIB also decreases contact guidance, which suggests the existence of a compensatory mechanism between myosin IIA and myosin IIB. Conversely, knockdown or inhibition of cell division control protein 42 homolog promotes contact guidance-mediated decision making. Taken together, the dimensionality, length scales of the physical microenvironment, and intrinsic cell signaling regulate cell decision making at intersections.-Paul, C. D., Shea, D. J., Mahoney, M.

These enzymes are recruited to sites of DNA damage by interacting with the essential replication accessory protein proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the scaffold protein Rev1. In most Y-family polymerases, these interactions are mediated by one or more conserved PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) motifs that bind in a hydrophobic pocket on the front side of PCNA as well as by conserved Rev1-interacting region (RIR) motifs that bind in a hydrophobic pocket on the C-terminal domain of Rev1.

Moreover, the PIP motif of polymerase η binds in the hydrophobic pocket on the Rev1 C-terminal domain. We also show that the RIR motif of human polymerase κ and the PIP motif of yeast Msh6 bind both PCNA and Rev1. Overall, these findings demonstrate that PIP motifs and RIR motifs have overlapping specificities and can interact with both PCNA and Rev1 in structurally similar ways.

https://openalex.org/W2281626582,"FAD-dependent alcohol oxidases (AOX) are key enzymes of methylotrophic organisms that can utilize lower primary alcohols as sole source of carbon and energy. Here we report the crystal structure analysis of the methanol oxidase AOX1 from Pichia pastoris. The crystallographic phase problem was solved by means of Molecular Replacement in combination with initial structure rebuilding using Rosetta model completion and relaxation against an averaged electron density map. The subunit arrangement of the homo-octameric AOX1 differs from that of octameric vanillyl alcohol oxidase and other dimeric or tetrameric alcohol oxidases, due to the insertion of two large protruding loop regions and an additional C-terminal extension in AOX1. In comparison to other alcohol oxidases, the active site cavity of AOX1 is significantly reduced in size, which could explain the observed preference for methanol as substrate. All AOX1 subunits of the structure reported here harbor a modified flavin adenine dinucleotide, which contains an arabityl chain instead of a ribityl chain attached to the isoalloxazine ring."

https://openalex.org/W2282011912,"Reduced peripheral serotonin (5HT) in mice lacking tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH1), the rate limiting enzyme for 5HT synthesis, was reported to be anabolic to the skeleton. However, in other studies TPH1 deletion either had no bone effect or an age dependent inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption. The role of 5HT in bone therefore remains poorly understood. To address this issue, we used selective breeding to create rat sublines with constitutively high (high-5HT) and low (low-5HT) platelet 5HT level (PSL) and platelet 5HT uptake (PSU). High-5HT rats had decreased bone volume due to increased bone turnover characterized by increased bone formation and mineral apposition rate, increased osteoclast number and serum C-telopeptide level. Daily oral administration of the TPH1 inhibitor (LX1032) for 6 weeks reduced PSL and increased the trabecular bone volume and trabecular number of the spine and femur in high-5HT rats. High-5HT animals also developed a type 2 diabetes (T2D) phenotype with increased: plasma insulin, glucose, hemoglobin A1c, body weight, visceral fat, β-cell pancreatic islets size, serum cholesterol, and decreased muscle strength. Serum calcium accretion mediated by parathyroid hormone slightly increased, whereas treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 decreased PSL. Insulin reduction was paralleled by a drop in PSL in high-5HT rats. In vitro, insulin and 5HT synergistically up-regulated osteoblast differentiation isolated from high-5HT rats, whereas TPH1 inhibition decreased the number of bone marrow-derived osteoclasts. These results suggest that constitutively elevated PSL is associated with bone loss and T2D via a homeostatic interplay between the peripheral 5HT, bone and insulin."
https://openalex.org/W2286993931,"Background Foodborne Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) outbreaks are being recognized as an emerging public health problem in industrialized countries. In 2013 three foodborne HAV outbreaks occurred in Europe and one in USA. During the largest of the three European outbreaks, most cases occurred in Italy (>1,200 cases as of March 31, 2014). A national Task Force was established at the beginning of the outbreak by the Ministry of Health. Mixed frozen berries were early demonstrated to be the source of infection by the identity of viral sequences in patients and in food. In the present study the molecular characterization of HAV isolates from 355 Italian cases is reported. Methods Molecular characterization was carried out by PCR/sequencing (VP1/2A region), comparison with reference strains and phylogenetic analysis. Results A unique strain was responsible for most characterized cases (235/355, 66.1%). Molecular data had a key role in tracing this outbreak, allowing 110 out of the 235 outbreak cases (46.8%) to be recognized in absence of any other link. The data also showed background circulation of further unrelated strains, both autochthonous and travel related, whose sequence comparison highlighted minor outbreaks and small clusters, most of them unrecognized on the basis of epidemiological data. Phylogenetic analysis showed most isolates from travel related cases clustering with reference strains originating from the same geographical area of travel. Conclusions In conclusion, the study documents, in a real outbreak context, the crucial role of molecular analysis in investigating an old but re-emerging pathogen. Improving the molecular knowledge of HAV strains, both autochthonous and circulating in countries from which potentially contaminated foods are imported, will become increasingly important to control outbreaks by supporting trace back activities, aiming to identify the geographical source(s) of contaminated food, as well as public health interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2283152624,"DNA double strand break (DSB) responses depend on the sequential actions of the E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168 plus E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc13 to specifically generate histone Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains in DSB signaling. Here, we defined the activated RNF8-Ubc13∼ubiquitin complex by x-ray crystallography and its functional solution conformations by x-ray scattering, as tested by separation-of-function mutations imaged in cells by immunofluorescence. The collective results show that the RING E3 RNF8 targets E2 Ubc13 to DSB sites and plays a critical role in damage signaling by stimulating polyubiquitination through modulating conformations of ubiquitin covalently linked to the Ubc13 active site. Structure-guided separation-of-function mutations show that the RNF8 E2 stimulating activity is essential for DSB signaling in mammalian cells and is necessary for downstream recruitment of 53BP1 and BRCA1. Chromatin-targeted RNF168 rescues 53BP1 recruitment involved in non-homologous end joining but not BRCA1 recruitment for homologous recombination. These findings suggest an allosteric approach to targeting the ubiquitin-docking cleft at the E2-E3 interface for possible interventions in cancer and chronic inflammation, and moreover, they establish an independent RNF8 role in BRCA1 recruitment."

https://openalex.org/W2413926088,"Leishmania infantum is the etiologic agent of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in countries in the Mediterranean basin, where dogs are the domestic reservoirs and represent important elements in the transmission of the disease. Since the major focal areas of human VL exhibit a high prevalence of seropositive dogs, the control of canine VL could reduce the infection rate in humans. Efforts toward this have focused on the improvement of diagnostic tools, as well as on vaccine development. The identification of parasite antigens including suitable major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I- and/or II-restricted epitopes is very important since disease protection is characterized by strong and long-lasting CD8+ T and CD4+ Th1 cell-dominated immunity. In the present study, total protein extract from late-log phase L. infantum promastigotes was analyzed by two-dimensional western blots and probed with sera from asymptomatic and symptomatic dogs. A total of 42 protein spots were found to differentially react with IgG from asymptomatic dogs, while 17 of these identified by Coommasie stain were extracted and analyzed. Of these, 21 proteins were identified by mass spectrometry; they were mainly involved in metabolism and stress responses. An in silico analysis predicted that the chaperonin HSP60, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, enolase, cyclophilin 2, cyclophilin 40, and one hypothetical protein contain promiscuous MHCI and/or MHCII epitopes. Our results suggest that the combination of immunoproteomics and bioinformatics analyses is a promising method for the identification of novel candidate antigens for vaccine development or with potential use in the development of sensitive diagnostic tests."

AT2 from HPS patients and mouse models of HPS exhibit enlarged LB with increased phospholipid content, but the mechanism underlying these defects is unknown. We now show that AT2 in the pearl mouse model of HPS type 2 lacking the adaptor protein 3 complex (AP-3) fails to accumulate the soluble enzyme peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) in LB. This defect reflects impaired AP-3-dependent trafficking of PRDX6 to LB, because pearl mouse AT2 cells harbor a normal total PRDX6 content. AP-3-dependent targeting of PRDX6 to LB requires the transmembrane protein LIMP-2/SCARB2, a known AP-3-dependent cargo protein that functions as a carrier for lysosomal proteins in other cell types. Depletion of LB PRDX6 in AP-3- or LIMP-2/SCARB2-deficient mice correlates with phospholipid accumulation in lamellar bodies and with defective intraluminal degradation of LB disaturated phosphatidylcholine. Furthermore, AP-3-dependent LB targeting is facilitated by protein/protein interaction between LIMP-2/SCARB2 and PRDX6 in vitro and in vivo. Our data provide the first evidence for an AP-3-dependent cargo protein required for the maturation of LB in AT2 and suggest that the loss of PRDX6 activity contributes to the pathogenic changes in LB phospholipid homeostasis found HPS2 patients.

AP-3-dependent targeting of PRDX6 to LB requires the transmembrane protein LIMP-2/SCARB2, a known AP-3-dependent cargo protein that functions as a carrier for lysosomal proteins in other cell types. Depletion of LB PRDX6 in AP-3- or LIMP-2/SCARB2-deficient mice correlates with phospholipid accumulation in lamellar bodies and with defective intraluminal degradation of LB disaturated phosphatidylcholine. Furthermore, AP-3-dependent LB targeting is facilitated by protein/protein interaction between LIMP-2/SCARB2 and PRDX6 in vitro and in vivo. Our data provide the first evidence for an AP-3-dependent cargo protein required for the maturation of LB in AT2 and suggest that the loss of PRDX6 activity contributes to the pathogenic changes in LB phospholipid homeostasis found HPS2 patients."
https://openalex.org/W2280170473,"TodS is a sensor kinase that responds to various monoaromatic compounds, which either cause an agonistic or antagonistic effect on phosphorylation of its cognate response regulator TodT, and controls tod operon expression in Pseudomonas putida strains. We describe a molecular sensing mechanism of TodS that is activated in response to toluene. The crystal structures of the TodS Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) 1 sensor domain (residues 43–164) and its complex with toluene (agonist) or 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (antagonist) show a typical β2α3β3 PAS fold structure (residues 45–149), forming a hydrophobic ligand-binding site. A signal transfer region (residues 150–163) located immediately after the canonical PAS fold may be intrinsically flexible and disordered in both apo-PAS1 and antagonist-bound forms and dramatically adapt an α-helix upon toluene binding. This structural change in the signal transfer region is proposed to result in signal transmission to activate the TodS/TodT two-component signal transduction system. Site-directed mutagenesis and β-galactosidase assays using a P. putida reporter strain system verified the essential residues involved in ligand sensing and signal transfer and suggest that the Phe46 residue acts as a ligand-specific switch.

A model of the TodS PAS1 structure predicted a hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket and suggested that four amino acid residues (Phe46, Ile74, Phe79, and Ile114) are involved in ligand binding (10.Busch A. Lacal J. Martos A. Ramos J.L. Krell T. Bacterial sensor kinase TodS interacts with agonistic and antagonistic signals.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13774-13779Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). F46A, I74A, and I114A mutant variants of TodS showed significantly lower in vitro ligand-binding affinities, including for both agonists and antagonists, than that of wild-type (WT) TodS (10.Busch A. Lacal J. Martos A. Ramos J.L. Krell T. Bacterial sensor kinase TodS interacts with agonistic and antagonistic signals.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13774-13779Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Particularly, the F79A mutant did not respond to even high doses of ligands in both in vitro and in vivo assays, implying that the Phe79 residue of PAS1 is the most critical residue for ligand binding and autophosphorylation of TodS (10.Busch A. Lacal J. Martos A. Ramos J.L. Krell T. Bacterial sensor kinase TodS interacts with agonistic and antagonistic signals.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13774-13779Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although the model structure of PAS1 is useful for predicting the ligand-binding residues, the key question of how the N-terminal PAS1 ligand-sensing domain transmits signals to the C-terminal TodS remains to be answered. In the present study, we determined the crystal structures of the TodS PAS1 domain in complex with either toluene (an agonist) or 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (1,2,4-TMB; an antagonist), as well that of apo-PAS1. On the basis of this structural information, we propose a mechanism for TodS molecular sensing and signal transfer to TodT using combined biochemical and in vivo physiological analyses. The bacterial strains used and plasmids constructed in this study are listed in Table 1. Briefly, the todS genes encoding TodS (residues 43–978) and dimerization helix-containing TodS (residues 23–978) were PCR-amplified using P. putida F1 genomic DNA as a template. The amplified TodS (residues 43–978) gene was subcloned into the NcoI and XhoI sites of pET28b(+) (Novagen), a C-terminal His-tagged protein expression vector. The TodS (residues 23–978) gene was subcloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pGST-Parallel1 vector (26.Sheffield P. Garrard S. Derewenda Z.

Purif. 1999; 15: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), an N-terminal GST-fused protein expression vector. The DNA fragments encoding PAS1 (residues 43–168), dimerization helix-containing PAS1 (residues 23–168), and PAS2 (residues 611–729) were PCR-amplified using the TodS expression plasmid and subcloned into the NcoI and XhoI sites of the pHis-Parallel1 vector (26.Sheffield P. Garrard S. Derewenda Z. Overcoming expression and purification problems of RhoGDI using a family of “parallel” expression vectors.Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 15: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), an N-terminal His6-tagged protein expression vector containing an recombinant tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. The todST promoter and the todST gene region in P. putida F1 were PCR-amplified using TodSTpp-u and TodSTpp-m primers and TodST-F and TodST-R primers, respectively (Table 2). The todST promoter region was cloned into the NsiI and XbaI sites of the pBBRBB-eGFP vector (27.Vick J.E. Johnson E.T. Choudhary S. Bloch S.E. Lopez-Gallego F. Srivastava P. Tikh I.B. Wawrzyn G.T.

Biotechnol. 2011; 92: 1275-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), resulting in pBBR-PtodST. Subsequently, todST was subcloned into the SacI and HindIII sites of pBBR-PtodST to express todST under the native todST promoter (pBBR-PtodST-TodST) for in vivo assays. No green fluorescent protein gene is present in the resultant expression plasmid. The mutant variants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The L71M mutation was introduced into PAS1 (residues 43–168) to facilitate selenomethionine (SeMet) incorporation for solving the crystal structure. All introduced mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea).

https://openalex.org/W2278538676,"FGFR1 amplification occurs in ~20% of sqNSCLC and trials with FGFR inhibitors have selected FGFR1 amplified patients by FISH. Lung cancer cell lines were profiled for sensitivity to AZD4547, a potent, selective inhibitor of FGFRs 1–3. Sensitivity to FGFR inhibition was associated with but not wholly predicted by increased FGFR1 gene copy number. Additional biomarker assays evaluating expression of FGFRs and correlation between amplification and expression in clinical tissues are therefore warranted. We validated nanoString for mRNA expression analysis of 194 genes, including FGFRs, from clinical tumour tissue. In a panel of sqNSCLC tumours 14.4% (13/90) were FGFR1 amplified by FISH. Although mean FGFR1 expression was significantly higher in amplified samples, there was significant overlap in the range of expression levels between the amplified and non-amplified cohorts with several non-amplified samples expressing FGFR1 to levels equivalent to amplified samples. Statistical analysis revealed increased expression of FGFR1 neighboring genes on the 8p12 amplicon (BAG4, LSM1 and WHSC1L1) in FGFR1 amplified tumours, suggesting a broad rather than focal amplicon and raises the potential for codependencies. High resolution aCGH analysis of pre-clinical and clinical samples supported the presence of a broad and heterogeneous amplicon around the FGFR1 locus. In conclusion, the range of FGFR1 expression levels in both FGFR1 amplified and non-amplified NSCLC tissues, together with the breadth and intra-patient heterogeneity of the 8p amplicon highlights the need for gene expression analysis of clinical samples to inform the understanding of determinants of response to FGFR inhibitors. In this respect the nanoString platform provides an attractive option for RNA analysis of FFPE clinical samples."
https://openalex.org/W2276980315,"Andes virus (ANDV) causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a severe acute disease with a 40% case fatality rate. Humans are infected via inhalation, and the lungs are severely affected during HPS, but little is known regarding the effects of ANDV-infection of the lung. Using a 3-dimensional air-exposed organotypic human lung tissue model, we analyzed progeny virus production and cytokine-responses after ANDV-infection. After a 7–10 day period of low progeny virus production, a sudden peak in progeny virus levels was observed during approximately one week. This peak in ANDV-production coincided in time with activation of innate immune responses, as shown by induction of type I and III interferons and ISG56. After the peak in ANDV production a low, but stable, level of ANDV progeny was observed until 39 days after infection. Compared to uninfected models, ANDV caused long-term elevated levels of eotaxin-1, IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, and VEGF-A that peaked 20–25 days after infection, i.e., after the observed peak in progeny virus production. Notably, eotaxin-1 was only detected in supernatants from infected models. In conclusion, these findings suggest that ANDV replication in lung tissue elicits a late proinflammatory immune response with possible long-term effects on the local lung cytokine milieu. The change from an innate to a proinflammatory response might be important for the transition from initial asymptomatic infection to severe clinical disease, HPS."
https://openalex.org/W2282517525,"Purpose To understand the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) on the diagnosis of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) in Taiwan. Methods Subjects with glaucoma were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database of year 2006, which included one million randomly selected insurants. Individuals who had ≥4 ambulatory visits within one year which had the diagnosis code of POAG (ICD-9-CM 365.11 or 365.12) or PACG (365.23) and concurrent prescription of anti-glaucoma medication or surgery were selected. Individual SES was represented by monthly income calculated from the insurance premium. Neighborhood SES was defined based on neighborhood household income averages. Urbanization level of habitation was categorized into 3 levels. The odds ratio of having POAG or PACG in subjects with different SES was evaluated by using multiple logistic regression analysis. Results In total, 752 and 561 subjects with POAG and PACG, respectively, who were treated on a regular basis, were identified. The diagnosis of glaucoma was affected by age, gender, frequency of healthcare utilization, individual SES, and urbanization level of habitation. With the adjustment of age, gender, healthcare utilization, neighborhood SES and level of urbanization, subjects with lower income were more likely to be diagnosed as PACG, but less likely as POAG. Conclusions Subjects with more frequent healthcare utilization were more likely to be diagnosed with glaucoma. Subjects with low SES were more susceptible to PACG, but subjects with high SES were more likely to be diagnosed as POAG. This information is useful for the design and target participant setting in glaucoma education and screening campaign to maximize the efficacy of limited resources in preventing glaucoma blindness."
https://openalex.org/W2277601268,"Background Few studies have addressed the influence of dietary patterns (DP) during adolescence on the amount of body fat in early adulthood. Objective To analyze the associations between DP tracking and changes in the period between 15 and 18 years of age and the percentage of body fat (%BF) at age 18 years. Methods We used data from 3,823 members of the 1993 Pelotas (Brazil) birth cohort. Body density was measured at age 18 years by air displacement plethysmograph (BOD POD) and the %BF was calculated applying the Siri equation. Based on the estimates from the FFQ, we identified DP at ages 15 (“Varied”, “Traditional”, “Dieting” and “Processed meats”) and 18 years (“Varied”, “Traditional”, “Dieting” and “Fish, fast food and alcohol”). The DP tracking was defined as the individual’s adherence to the same DP at both ages. Associations were tested using multiple linear regression models stratified by sex. Results The mean %BF was 25.0% (95% CI: 24.7 to 25.4), significantly greater for girls than boys (p<0.001). The adherence to any DP at age 15 years was not associated with the %BF at age 18 years. However, individuals who adhered to a “Dieting” DP at age 18 years showed greater %BF (1.30 and 1.91 percentage points in boys and girls, respectively) in comparison with those who adhered to a “Varied” DP. Boys who presented tracking of a “Dieting” DP presented greater average %BF in comparison with others DP, as well as girls who changed from the “Traditional” or “Processed meats” DP to a “Dieting” DP. Conclusion These results may support public health policies and strategies focused on improving dietary habits of adolescents and young adults and preventing accumulation of body fat, especially among the adolescents with restrictive dietary habits."
https://openalex.org/W2285758219,"This is the first report to provide comprehensive thermodynamic and structural data concerning duplex, hairpin, quadruplex and i-motif structures in β-L-RNA series. Herein we confirm that, within the limits of experimental error, the thermodynamic stability of enantiomeric structural motifs is the same as that of naturally occurring D-RNA counterparts. In addition, formation of D-RNA/L-RNA heterochiral duplexes is also observed; however, their thermodynamic stability is significantly reduced in reference to homochiral D-RNA duplexes. The presence of three locked nucleic acid (LNA) residues within the D-RNA strand diminishes the negative effect of the enantiomeric, complementary L-RNA strand in the formation of heterochiral RNA duplexes. Similar behavior is also observed for heterochiral LNA-2′-O-methyl-D-RNA/L-RNA duplexes. The formation of heterochiral duplexes was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The CD curves of homochiral L-RNA structural motifs are always reversed, whereas CD curves of heterochiral duplexes present individual features dependent on the composition of chiral strands."
https://openalex.org/W2277713783,"Stacking cross-sectional intravascular images permits three-dimensional rendering of endovascular implants, yet introduces between-frame uncertainties that limit characterization of device placement and the hemodynamic microenvironment. In a porcine coronary stent model, we demonstrate enhanced OCT reconstruction with preservation of between-frame features through fusion with angiography and a priori knowledge of stent design.Strut positions were extracted from sequential OCT frames. Reconstruction with standard interpolation generated discontinuous stent structures. By computationally constraining interpolation to known stent skeletons fitted to 3D 'clouds' of OCT-Angio-derived struts, implant anatomy was resolved, accurately rendering features from implant diameter and curvature (n = 1 vessels, r2 = 0.91, 0.90, respectively) to individual strut-wall configurations (average displacement error ~15 μm). This framework facilitated hemodynamic simulation (n = 1 vessel), showing the critical importance of accurate anatomic rendering in characterizing both quantitative and basic qualitative flow patterns. Discontinuities with standard approaches systematically introduced noise and bias, poorly capturing regional flow effects. In contrast, the enhanced method preserved multi-scale (local strut to regional stent) flow interactions, demonstrating the impact of regional contexts in defining the hemodynamic consequence of local deployment errors.Fusion of planar angiography and knowledge of device design permits enhanced OCT image analysis of in situ tissue-device interactions. Given emerging interests in simulation-derived hemodynamic assessment as surrogate measures of biological risk, such fused modalities offer a new window into patient-specific implant environments."
https://openalex.org/W2282251269,"Aggregation of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) in the brain leads to the formation of extracellular amyloid plaques, which is one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD). It is a general hypothesis that soluble prefibrillar assemblies of the Aβ peptide, rather than mature amyloid fibrils, cause neuronal dysfunction and memory impairment in AD. Thus, reducing the level of these prefibrillar species by using molecules that can interfere with the Aβ fibrillation pathway may be a valid approach to reduce Aβ cytotoxicity. Luminescent-conjugated oligothiophenes (LCOs) have amyloid binding properties and spectral properties that differ when they bind to protein aggregates with different morphologies and can therefore be used to visualize protein aggregates. In this study, cell toxicity experiments and biophysical studies demonstrated that the LCO p-FTAA was able to reduce the pool of soluble toxic Aβ species in favor of the formation of larger insoluble nontoxic amyloid fibrils, there by counteracting Aβ-mediated cytotoxicity. Moreover, p-FTAA bound to early formed Aβ species and induced a rapid formation of β-sheet structures. These p-FTAA generated amyloid fibrils were less hydrophobic and more resistant to proteolysis by proteinase K. In summary, our data show that p-FTAA promoted the formation of insoluble and stable Aβ species that were nontoxic which indicates that p-FTAA might have therapeutic potential.

https://openalex.org/W2279416032,"Vertebral laminae are bony ridges or sheets that connect important morphological landmarks on the vertebrae, like diapophyses or zygapophyses. They usually exhibit some serial variation throughout the column. A consistent terminology facilitates the morphological description of this variation, and the recognition of patterns that could be taxonomically significant and could serve as phylogenetic characters. Such a terminology was designed for saurischian dinosaurs, and has also been applied to other members of Archosauriformes. Herein, this terminology is applied for the first time to lizards (Squamata). Probably due to their generally smaller size compared to saurischian dinosaurs, lizards have less developed vertebral laminae. Some laminae could not be recognized in this group and others require new names to account for differences in basic vertebral morphology. For instance, the fusion of diapophysis and parapophysis in lacertids into a structure called synapophysis necessitates the creation of the new term synapophyseal laminae for both diapophyseal and parapophyseal laminae. An assessment of occurrence and serial variation in a number of lacertid species shows that some laminae develop throughout ontogeny or only occur in large-sized species, whereas the distribution of other laminae might prove to be taxonomically significant in future."

However, how p73 activity is controlled at the posttranscriptional level is not well understood. Here, we showed that TAp73 activity is regulated by RNA-binding protein PCBP2. Specifically, we found that knockdown or knock-out of PCBP2 reduces, whereas ectopic expression of PCBP2 increases, TAp73 expression. We also showed that PCBP2 is necessary for p73 mRNA stability via the CU-rich elements in p73 3′-UTR. To uncover the biological relevance of PCBP2-regulated TAp73 expression, we showed that ectopic expression of PCBP2 inhibits, whereas knockdown or knock-out of PCBP2 increases, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a TAp73-dependent manner. Additionally, we found that glutaminase 2 (GLS2), a modulator of p73-dependent antioxidant defense, is also involved in PCBP2-regulated ROS production. Moreover, we generated PCBP2-deficient mice and primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and showed that loss of PCBP2 leads to decreased p73 expression and, subsequently, increased ROS production and accelerated cellular senescence.

Depending on the target and the enzymes involved, ubiquitination is a process that may dramatically vary in terms of linkages, length, and attachment sites. Here we identified the unique lysine residue at position 124 of the NY-ESO-1 cancer/testis antigen as the acceptor site for the formation of canonical Lys-48-linkages. Interestingly, a lysine-less form of NY-ESO-1 was as efficient as its wild-type counterpart in supplying the HLA-A*0201-restricted NY-ESO-1157–165 antigenic peptide. In fact, we show that the regulation of NY-ESO-1 processing by the ubiquitin receptors Rpn10 and Rpn13 as a well as by the standard and immunoproteasome is governed by non-canonical ubiquitination on non-lysine sites.

Upon exposure to IFN-α/β and/or IFN-γ, three additional non-essential catalytic β subunits (β5i, β1i, and β2i) are up-regulated and incorporated in place of the β5, β1, and β2 subunits during de novo assembly, ensuring a shift from the standard proteasome configuration to an immunoproteasome (IP), 2The abbreviations used are: IPimmunoproteasomeUbubiquitinDRiPdefective ribosomal productCTLcytotoxic T lymphocyteTEVtobacco etch virusNY-ESO-1New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 1. which has been shown to be more effective at the removal of damaged proteins (6.Seifert U.

In this pathway, substrates destined to be broken down must undergo a so-called ubiquitination process (sometimes also referred as to ubiquitylation) that relies on a three-step enzymatic cascade involving E1, E2, and E3 enzymes that allows the covalent transfer of cellular Ub to target proteins. Ubiquitination primarily occurs via isopeptide bonds to lysine residues of target proteins (10.Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A.

Meanwhile, a number of protein substrates have been shown to be conjugated on threonine, serine, and cysteine residues as well as at the N terminus (11.McDowell G.S. Kucerova R. Philpott A.

The Ub molecule itself possesses seven lysine residues (Lys-6, Lys-11, Lys-27, Lys-29, Lys-33, Lys-48, and Lys-63) as well as an NH2-terminal methionine (referred as to M1), each of which serves as a potential acceptor site for the formation of poly-Ub chains (14.Komander D. Rape M. The ubiquitin code.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 203-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2243) Google Scholar). This allows the assembly of at least eight types of poly-Ub chains with distinct topologies and outcomes for the modified protein. Importantly, ubiquitination is thought to operate at least at two distinct levels in vivo. It may be initiated on fully translated mature proteins or during protein synthesis. The latter is part of a quality control process that allows the rapid ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of newly synthetized proteins that have accumulated errors and/or damage during translation (i.e. defective ribosomal products or DRiPs) (15.Yewdell J.W.

Depending on the number and/or nature of acceptor sites, mature proteins or DRiPs may therefore be subjected to a considerable variety of ubiquitination combinations. Whether these ubiquitination sites and/or linkage types directly influence MHC class I antigen presentation is unknown. Here we set out to address this issue by analyzing the ubiquitination profile of the NY-ESO-1 cancer/testis antigen, which presents the unique advantage of containing only one lysine residue at position 124. In this work, we show that the mature NY-ESO-1 form devoid of Lys-124 (NY-ESO-1K0) greatly differs from its wild-type counterpart in terms of attachment sites and linkages. However, despite those differences, the presentation of the HLA-A*0201-restricted NY-ESO-1157–165 peptide emerging from NY-ESO-1K0 was not altered. Our data suggest that atypical linkages and/or sites actively participate in the regulation of MHC class I antigen processing. The proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and epoxomicin were purchased from Calbiochem. N-ethylmaleimide and cycloheximide were obtained from Sigma. The PR-893-specific inhibitor for the β5 standard subunit was provided by Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (an Amgen subsidiary, South San Francisco, CA) and the YU-102 β1/LMP2-specific inhibitor was a gift from Dr. Kyung-Bo Kim (Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY). The mouse monoclonal antibodies against NY-ESO-1 (clone E978), LMP7 (clone A-12), c-myc (clone 9E10), Rpn13 (clone Q31), cathepsin D (sc-6486), and β-actin (clone C4) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Antibodies directed against ubiquitin (clone FK2), β1 (clone MCP421), β2 (clone MCP165), Rpn10 (clone S5a-18), and α6 (clone MCP20) were purchased from Enzo Life Sciences. The goat anti-MECL1 polyclonal antibody (PA5-19146) was obtained from Thermo Scientific. Rabbit anti-β5 (ab3330) and anti-LMP2 (ab3328) antibodies were purchased from Abcam. Other antibodies used in this work included HA.11 (clone 16B12, Covance), GFP (clone JL-8, TaKaRa, Clontech), LC3B (2775, Cell Signaling Technology), and ubiquitin (Dako). The secondary goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with peroxidase were obtained from Calbiochem and used at a 1:5000 dilution. HeLa cells were cultivated in Iscove's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (all purchased from Biochrom AG). The 33/2 cell line is a derivative of HeLa cells and has been described previously (19.Ebstein F. Lehmann A. Kloetzel P.M. The FAT10- and ubiquitin-dependent degradation machineries exhibit common and distinct requirements for MHC class I antigen presentation.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2012; 69: 2443-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The CTL clone RG39 specific for the HLA-A*0201-restricted NY-ESO-1157–165 peptide was prepared as described previously (19.Ebstein F. Lehmann A. Kloetzel P.M. The FAT10- and ubiquitin-dependent degradation machineries exhibit common and distinct requirements for MHC class I antigen presentation.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2012; 69: 2443-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The cDNA for CTAG1b encoding the full-length NY-ESO-1 protein was amplified by RT-PCR from RNA of HT1080 cells and cloned into pcDNA3.1/myc-HIS version B (Invitrogen) to construct a C-terminally myc-HIS-tagged NY-ESO-1. A single amino acid substitution (Lys-3→Arg-3) of the EQKLISEEDL myc tag sequence was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using primer pairs containing the appropriate base changes to generate a pcDNA3.1/NY-ESO-1/myc*-HIS with a modified EQRLISEEDL myc* tag devoid of lysine residues. The pcDNA3.1/NY-ESO-1/myc*-HIS was used again as a template for site-directed mutagenesis to substitute the unique lysine residue of NY-ESO-1 at position 124 into an arginine (K124R) and to generate a pcDNA3.1/NY-ESO-1K124R/myc*-HIS construct (referred as to NY-ESO-1K0 in this paper). For N-terminal tagging of NY-ESO-1 and NY-ESO-1K0, oligonucleotides encoding a short 9-mer V5 sequence (IPNPLLGLD) fused to a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease-sensitive site (ENLYFQG) were constructed, annealed, and inserted in-frame into the pcDNA3.1/NY-ESO-1/myc*-HIS and pcDNA3.1/NY-ESO-1K0/myc*-HIS plasmids to generate V5-TEV-NY-ESO-1-myc*/HIS and V5-TEV-NY-ESO-1K0-myc*/HIS constructs. Both of these constructs were further used as templates for site-directed mutagenesis to substitute the NY-ESO-1 methionine initiation codon at position 20 into a valine one and to generate the V5-TEV-NY-ESO-1M20V-myc*/HIS, V5-TEV-NY-ESO-1M20V/K0-myc*/HIS variants. The HA-Ub-GFP construct has been described previously (19.Ebstein F. Lehmann A. Kloetzel P.M. The FAT10- and ubiquitin-dependent degradation machineries exhibit common and distinct requirements for MHC class I antigen presentation.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2012; 69: 2443-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Multiple lysine mutations of HA-Ub-GFP were generated by site-directed mutagenesis to generate HA-UbK6-only-GFP, HA-UbK11-only-GFP, HA-UbK27-only-GFP, HA-UbK29-only-GFP, HA-UbK33-only-GFP, HA-UbK48-only-GFP, and HA-UbK63-only-GFP. Mammalian cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Subconfluent HeLa or 33/2 cells grown in 10-cm tissue culture dishes were subjected to a first transfection with the wild-type HA-Ub-GFP plasmid or one of the HA-Ub-GFP mutant constructs for 24 h prior to another subsequent transfection with either NY-ESO-1 or NY-ESO-1K0. Sixteen hours after the second transfection, cells were incubated with 10 μm MG-132 for 6 h before collection. Cells expressing an NY-ESO-1 antigen form or not (as negative control) were washed twice with PBS and lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, as well as 10 μm MG-132 and 50 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Whole cell extracts were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C and subsequently centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were then collected and used immediately for the pulldown of myc-tagged NY-ESO-1 proteins using magnetic beads conjugated with μMACS anti-myc antibodies (Miltenyi Biotec). Briefly, 5 mg of protein lysate was supplemented with 50 μl of μMACS anti-myc beads for 30 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, labeled cell lysates were applied to MACS columns in a separator (Miltenyi Biotec) and washed five times with a first buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS. In some experiments, the NaCl concentration in this wash buffer was increased up to 3 m. The second wash was carried out using a buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.5). After the last washing step, proteins were eluted in 85 μl of elution buffer (50 mm Tris HCl (pH 6.8), 50 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.005% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol). The precipitates were finally subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting using specific antibodies. HeLa cells were transfected with HA-Ub-GFP together with V5-TEV-NY-ESO-1M20V-myc*/HIS, V5-TEV-NY-ESO-1M20V/K0-myc*/HIS, or MART-1-myc/HIS (as a control). One day after transfection, cells were exposed to a 6-h treatment with 10 μm MG-132 prior to a NY-ESO-1 pulldown as described above. Digestion of V5-TEV-NY-ESO-1M20V-myc*/HIS and V5-TEV-NY-ESO-1M20V/K0-myc*/HIS was carried out while the proteins were still bound to μMACS anti-myc beads by adding 20 units of TEV protease for 150 min at 22 °C. Subsequently, the beads were washed several times, as described above, and the eluted material was further assessed by Western blotting. ON-TARGET-plus SMARTpool siRNAduplexes (Dharmacon) against Rpn10 (PSMD4, L-011365-00-0005), Rpn13 (ADMR1, L-01234-00-0005), LMP7 (PSMB8, L-006022-00-0005), and LMP2 (PSMB9, L-006023-00-0005) were used at 50 nm final concentration. Approximately 2 × 105 cells were seeded into one well of a 6-well tissue culture plate the day before siRNA transfection. All transfections were done using X-tremeGENE siRNA reagent (Roche). The siRNA efficiency in this work was validated by monitoring the siRNA-induced knockdown by Western blotting. Total RNA was isolated using the kit from Roche according to the instructions of the manufacturer. RT-PCR was then performed using 1 μg of total RNA with a primer specific for NY-ESO-1 and GAPDH (loading control). HeLa cells were transiently transfected with HLA-A*0201 together with either NY-ESO-1 or NY-ESO-1K0 and used as targets for their potential to activate the production of IFN-γ by the CTL clone RG39 recognizing the NY-ESO-1157–165 peptide. Following a 24-h transfection, target cells were serially diluted and then co-cultured with a fixed amount of T cells, resulting in graded effector:target ratio in a final volume of 100 μl on 96-well plates. After 16-h incubation, the supernatants were collected, and the IFN-γ content was determined using a commercially available human ELISA kit (BD Biosciences) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The data in the figures refer to the mean of two replicates. The standard deviation was below 5% of the mean. Student's t test (one-tailed) was used for data analysis when appropriate. To determine whether the unique lysine residue of NY-ESO-1 is an essential target for ubiquitination, allowing degradation and subsequent MHC class I antigen presentation, we generated a lysine-free form of NY-ESO-1 (i.e. NY-ESO-1K0) by introducing a single Lys-to-Arg change into a C-terminal myc*/HIS-tagged version of NY-ESO-1 protein at position 124. As shown in Fig. 1A, NY-ESO-1 and NY-ESO-1K0 yielded comparable NY-ESO-1157–165CTL responses when expressed in HeLa cells, as evidenced by similar IFN-γ levels produced by our RG39 clone. Likewise, the Lys-to-Arg mutation had no substantial effect on the transcription and/or steady-state expression level of NY-ESO-1 and/or NY-ESO-1K0, as determined by RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively (Fig. 1B). Together, these data demonstrate that Lys-124, as the unique canonical ubiquitination site of the NY-ESO-1 antigen, is not essential for the presentation of NY-ESO-1157–165 peptide. We next determined whether our two NY-ESO-1 antigen sources differ in their capacity to bind the Ub receptors Rpn10 (20.Deveraux Q. van Nocker S. Mahaffey D. Vierstra R. Rechsteiner M.

U.S.A. 1996; 93: 856-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and/or Rpn13 (22.Husnjak K. Elsasser S. Zhang N. Chen X. Randles L. Shi Y. Hofmann K. Walters K.J. Finley D. Dikic I. Proteasome subunit Rpn13 is a novel ubiquitin receptor.Nature. 2008; 453: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Consistent with its role as the major Ub receptor, Rpn10 knockdown led to a nearly complete inhibition of NY-ESO-1157–165 presentation regardless of the NY-ESO-1 form used (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, a much lower inhibition of the NY-ESO-1157–165 CTL response was observed in cells with an individual knockdown of Rpn13 or a combined knockdown of Rpn10 and Rpn13 for both NY-ESO-1 and NY-ESO-1K0. The observation that Rpn10/Rpn13 double knockdown was less efficient than the Rpn10 single one in impeding the NY-ESO-1157–165 CTL response can likely be attributed to the fact that cells exposed to both Rpn10 and Rpn13 siRNA achieved a less effective down-regulation of Rpn10 compared with cells exposed to Rpn10 siRNA alone (Fig. 2B). The exact similarity in the levels of NY-ESO-1157–165 CTL response between NY-ESO-1 and NY-ESO-1K0 following depletion of Rpn10 and/or Rpn13 suggests that both of these antigens are equally well recognized by 26 proteasomes. To unveil a possible relationship between ubiquitination and proteasomal processing, we next profiled the contribution of the three catalytic activities of the β5, β1, and β2 standard subunits to the generation of the NY-ESO-1157–165 peptide. To this end, HeLa cells were engineered to express either NY-ESO-1 or NY-ESO-1K0 before being treated with the PR-893, YU-102, and/or epoxomicin inhibitors. PR-893 is the human homolog of the PR-825 inhibitor specific for the β5 subunit, whereas YU-102 is an inhibitor known for its capacity to block β1-activity without affecting β5 and β2 activities (23.Myung J. Kim K.B. Lindsten K. Dantuma N.P. Crews C.M. Lack of proteasome active site allostery as revealed by subunit-specific inhibitors.Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 411-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Epoxomicin is an irreversible proteasome inhibitor that blocks β5 at low concentrations and both β5 and β2 when incubated with cells at higher concentrations (24.Kisselev A.F. Callard A. Goldberg A.L. Importance of the different proteolytic sites of the proteasome and the efficacy of inhibitors varies with the protein substrate.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8582-8590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The specificity of these inhibitors in our cell system was controlled by monitoring their potential binding to any of the β1, β2, and β5 subunits by Western blotting. As expected, β5 and β1 shifted up in the presence of PR-893 and YU-102, respectively, confirming subunit inhibition specificity in this assay (Fig. 3A). Exposure of the cells to 250 nm epoxomicin resulted in an evident upward shift of the β5 and β2 bands. Treatment of cells with epoxomicin together with YU-102 resulted in the covalent modification of all three subunits (Fig. 3A) and was accompanied by a significant drop in NY-ESO-1157–165 presentation regardless of the NY-ESO-1 antigen form used (Fig. 3B). These data unambiguously indicate that the generation of the NY-ESO-1157–165 peptide is proteasome-dependent. Unexpectedly, PR-893 alone failed to substantially influence the NY-ESO-1157–165 CTL response emerging from NY-ESO-1 or NY-ESO-1K0. By contrast, a substantial reduction in NY-ESO-1157–165 presentation could be observed following exposure of the cells to the YU-102 inhibitor. Of note, PR-893 showed no substantial additive effect on the YU-102-induced down-regulation of the NY-ESO-1157–165 presentation, confirming that the activity of the β5 subunits was dispensable in this process. Because epoxomicin, which blocks both β5 and β2, dramatically affects presentation and given that β5 was not required, we reasoned that generation of NY-ESO-1157–165 is mainly driven by the β2 subunit. We next compared the abilities of NY-ESO-1 and NY-ESO-1K0 to generate the NY-ESO-1157–165 peptide in the presence of immunoproteasomes. To this end, 33/2 cells that stably expressed LMP7, LMP2, and MECL1 (19.Ebstein F. Lehmann A. Kloetzel P.M. The FAT10- and ubiquitin-dependent degradation machineries exhibit common and distinct requirements for MHC class I antigen presentation.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2012; 69: 2443-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) were treated with siRNA directed against each of the inducible subunit prior to a 24-h transfection with plasmids encoding either NY-ESO-1 or NY-ESO-1K0. As expected the down-regulation of LMP7 was accompanied by a parallel rise of its β5 standard counterpart subunit (Fig. 4A). Similarly, the suppression of LMP2 and MECL1 by LMP2 siRNA resulted in an increased expression of both of the β1 and β2 standard subunits. As shown in Fig. 4B, the NY-ESO-1157–165 CTL response was not affected by LMP7 depletion in cells expressing either NY-ESO-1 or NY-ESO-1K0. However, the NY-ESO-1157–165 presentation was improved in 33/2 cells expressing either NY-ESO-1 or NY-ESO-1K0 following exposure to LMP2 siRNA. Likewise, 33/2 cells with an LMP7/LMP2 double knockdown and expressing either NY-ESO-1 or NY-ESO-1K0 exhibited a typical standard proteasome composition that was by far much more efficient than the IP of 33/2 cells exposed to control siRNA in generating the NY-ESO-1157–165 antigenic peptide (Fig. 4B). These data show that standard proteasomes process the NY-ESO-1157–165 peptide better than IPs. To determine whether the K124R mutation affects NY-ESO-1 ubiquitination, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a C-terminal myc*/HIS-tagged version of NY-ESO-1 or NY-ESO-1K0 or the MART-1 melanoma antigen (as a control) in combination with an HA-tagged Ub-GFP (HA-Ub-GFP) construct. As shown in Fig. 5A, significant amounts of slowly migrating forms of NY-ESO-1 were detected with both NY-ESO-1 and NY-ESO-1K0 precipitates using the HA antibody. Importantly, such HA-protein conjugates were only detectable in the presence of MG-132, indicating that they serve as a target signal for proteasome-mediated degradation. Noteworthy, apart from the fact that the NY-ESO-1 pulldown was conducted utilizing ionic detergent-based buffers, the exposure of the NY-ESO-1 bead-bound immune complexes to very high salt concentrations failed to alter the HA smears of NY-ESO-1 and NY-ESO-1K0 (Fig. 5B). This indicates that the binding of HA-Ub to NY-ESO-1 or NY-ESO-1K0 is indeed of a covalent nature. Surprisingly, the conjugation of NY-ESO-1K0 to the HA-Ub construct was even superior to that observed with NY-ESO-1. Because a C terminus-mediated sample enrichment exclusively provides full-length (i.e. fully translated) products, these data suggest that Lys-124 removal increases ubiquitination arising from the mature NY-ESO-1 protein. Having demonstrated that Lys-124 of NY-ESO-1 is not critical for either ubiquitination and/or presentation of the NY-ESO-1157–165 peptide, we next sought to identify other sites responsible for NY-ESO-1 ubiquitination. To determine whether NY-ESO-1 undergoes ubiquitination via Ser and/or Thr residues, HeLa cells were first engineered to express HA-Ub-GFP in combination with NY-ESO-1, NY-ESO-1K0, or MART-1 (as a control) prior to a 6-h treatment with 10 μm MG-132. Following NY-ESO-1 pulldown, the precipitates were left untreated or treated with 50 mm NaOH for 25 min at 32 °C. Fig. 6 shows that the ubiquitination of NY-ESO-1 and NY-ESO-1K0 was reduced following alkaline treatment. Importantly, peptide bonds were not hydrolyzed under these conditions, as evidenced by the levels of eluted NY-ESO-1, which remained unchanged following sodium hydroxide treatment. This indicates that both NY-ESO-1 and NY-ESO-1K0 are modified on Ser and/or Thr residues in these cells. Noteworthy, the use of the anti-Ub antibody (FK2) revealed the presence of Lys-29, Lys-48, and/or Lys-63 linkages on NY-ESO-1K0 that were resistant to NaOH treatment (Fig. 6). We next asked whether the N terminus of the NY-ESO-1 tumor antigen may act as a site for ubiquitination. To address this question, we introduced a short V5 (IPNPLLGLD) epitope at the N terminus of both of the NY-ESO-1-myc*/HIS and NY-ESO-1K0-myc*/HIS constructs, which was immediately followed by a TEV protease recognition site (ENLYFQG) (Fig. 7A). To avoid the expression of untagged NY-ESO-1 proteins deprived of the N-terminal V5 epitope, the original NY-ESO-1 methionine initiator codon at position 20 of both of the V5-TEV-NY-ESO-1-myc*/HIS and V5-TEV-NY-ESO-1K0-myc*/HIS constructs was changed into a valine (M20V), as depicted in Fig. 7, A and B. If the ubiquitination of NY-ESO-1 and/or NY-ESO-1K0 indeed partially relies on their N termini, it should be affected upon treatment with the TEV protease (Fig. 8A). Remarkably, on-bead digestion of the cell lysates with TEV protease resulted in loss of the V5 epitope as well as in a decrease in size of the eluted NY-ESO-1 proteins, as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 8B). This unambiguously indicates that the N-terminal V5 tag was efficiently cleaved off and stripped away from both of the NY-ESO-1 full-length proteins. Interestingly, despite being devoid of their respective N termini, both NY-ESO-1 and NY-ESO-1K0 exhibited an HA staining that was comparable with that observed with the untreated NY-ESO-1 proteins (Fig. 8B). These data demonstrate that the free N terminus of either NY-ESO-1 or NY-ESO-1K0 is not essentially involved in the ubiquitination process under these conditions.FIGURE 8The N-terminal −NH2 group of either NY-ESO-1 or NY-ESO-1K0 is not a site of conjugation. A, HeLa cells expressing HA-Ub-GFP in combination with V5-TEV-NY-ESO-1M20V-myc*/HIS or V5-TEV-NY-ESO-1M20V/K0-myc*/HIS were subjected to protein extraction and incubated with μMACS anti-myc beads that were subsequently left untreated or treated with 20 U TEV protease for 150 min at 2"
https://openalex.org/W2275290709,"α-Synuclein, a presynaptic neuronal protein encoded by the SNCA gene, is strongly implicated in Parkinson disease (PD). PD pathogenesis is linked to increased SNCA levels; however, the transcriptional elements that control SNCA expression are still elusive. Previous experiments in PC12 cells demonstrated that the transcription factor zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 21 (ZSCAN21) plays an important regulatory role in SNCA transcription. Currently, we characterized the role of ZSCAN21 in SNCA transcription in primary neuronal cultures and in vivo. We found that ZSCAN21 is developmentally expressed in neurons in different rat brain regions. We confirmed its binding in the intron 1 region of SNCA in rat cortical cultures. Lentivirus-mediated silencing of ZSCAN21 increased significantly SNCA promoter activity, mRNA, and protein levels in such cultures. In contrast, ZSCAN21 silencing reduced SNCA in neurosphere cultures. Interestingly, ZSCAN21 overexpression in cortical neurons led to robust mRNA but negligible protein expression, suggesting that ZSCAN21 protein levels are tightly regulated post-transcriptionally and/or post-translationally in primary neurons. Efficient adeno-associated virus-mediated knockdown of ZSCAN21 in the postnatal and adult hippocampus, an area linked with non-motor PD symptoms, revealed no significant alterations in SNCA levels. Overall, our study demonstrates that ZSCAN21 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of SNCA in primary neuronal cultures, but the direction of the effect is variable, likely depending on neuronal maturation. However, the unaltered SNCA levels observed following ZSCAN21 down-regulation in the rat brain, possibly due to compensatory mechanisms, imply that ZSCAN21 is not a master regulator of SNCA in vivo."

We measured acceleration and deceleration detection using patterns of random dots with horizontal (simpler) or radial motion (more visually complex). The results suggest that we detect acceleration better when viewing radial optic flow than horizontal translation. However, the direction within each type of pattern has no effect on performance and observers detect acceleration and deceleration similarly within each condition. We conclude that sensitivity to the presence of acceleration is generally higher for more complex patterns, regardless of the direction within each type of pattern or the sign of acceleration."

The recent emergence of three effective FDA-approved proteasome-inhibiting drugs, bortezomib (Velcade®), carfilzomib (Kyprolis®), and ixazomib (Ninlaro®), confirms that proteasome inhibitors are therapeutically useful against neoplastic disease, in particular refractory multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. This study describes the synthesis, computational affinity assessment, and preclinical evaluation of TIR-199, a natural product-derived syrbactin structural analog. Molecular modeling and simulation suggested that TIR-199 covalently binds each of the three catalytic subunits (β1, β2, and β5) and revealed key interaction sites. In vitro and cell culture-based proteasome activity measurements confirmed that TIR-199 inhibits the proteasome in a dose-dependent manner and induces tumor cell death in multiple myeloma and neuroblastoma cells as well as other cancer types in the NCI-60 cell panel. It is particularly effective against kidney tumor cell lines, with >250-fold higher anti-tumor activities than observed with the natural product syringolin A. In vivo studies in mice revealed a maximum tolerated dose of TIR-199 at 25 mg/kg. The anti-tumor activity of TIR-199 was confirmed in hollow fiber assays in mice. Adverse drug reaction screens in a kidney panel revealed no off-targets of concern. This is the first study to examine the efficacy of a syrbactin in animals. Taken together, the results suggest that TIR-199 is a potent new proteasome inhibitor with promise for further development into a clinical drug for the treatment of multiple myeloma and other forms of cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2283211088,"Many eukaryotic organisms encode more than one RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) that probably emerged as a result of gene duplication. Such RdRP paralogs often participate in distinct RNA silencing pathways and show characteristic repertoires of enzymatic activities in vitro. However, to what extent members of individual paralogous groups can undergo functional changes during speciation remains an open question. We show that orthologs of QDE-1, an RdRP component of the quelling pathway in Neurospora crassa, have rapidly diverged in evolution at the amino acid sequence level. Analyses of purified QDE-1 polymerases from N. crassa (QDE-1Ncr) and related fungi, Thielavia terrestris (QDE-1Tte) and Myceliophthora thermophila (QDE-1Mth), show that all three enzymes can synthesize RNA, but the precise modes of their action differ considerably. Unlike their QDE-1Ncr counterpart favoring processive RNA synthesis, QDE-1Tte and QDE-1Mth produce predominantly short RNA copies via primer-independent initiation. Surprisingly, a 3.19 Å resolution crystal structure of QDE-1Tte reveals a quasisymmetric dimer similar to QDE-1Ncr. Further electron microscopy analyses confirm that QDE-1Tte occurs as a dimer in solution and retains this status upon interaction with a template.

In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, silencing, or “quelling,” of transgenic arrays relies on RdRP QDE-1, PIWI/PAZ protein QDE-2, DNA helicase QDE-3, and several other components, including the ssDNA-binding protein RPA (2.Chang S.S. Zhang Z. Liu Y. RNA interference pathways in fungi: mechanisms and functions.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2012; 66: 305-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Interestingly, QDE-1 may trigger quelling by producing long aberrant ssRNA copies (aRNAs) of ssDNA intermediates that frequently arise in tandem-duplicated genomic sequences (30.Lee H.C. Chang S.S. Choudhary S. Aalto A.P. Maiti M. Bamford D.H.

Ye Q.A. Liu Y. Mechanism of siRNA production from repetitive DNA.Genes Dev. 2015; 29: 526-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This reaction depends on QDE-3 and RPA and is stimulated by DNA damage. QDE-1 can subsequently use its aRNA product as a template to produce dsRNA intermediates. These are subsequently converted into sRNAs that associate with QDE-2 and target complementary sequences. Thus, at least some RdRPs may initiate gene silencing de novo. In line with their diverse biological functions, individual RdRPs and their protein complexes isolated from various sources show different enzymatic properties in vitro. These include polymerase-specific preferences between ssRNA versus ssDNA templates and primer-dependent versus primer-independent initiation of RNA synthesis (33.Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H.

Some RdRPs can also function as template-independent terminal transferases (34.Curaba J. Chen X. Biochemical activities of Arabidopsis RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6.J. Biol.

Notably, two distinct template-dependent polymerization modes have been described for previously studied RdRPs: (a) processive synthesis of long double-stranded products, which is typically initiated at or close to the 3′-end of a single-stranded template using either primer-independent or so-called “back-priming” mechanisms, and (b) non-processive synthesis of sRNA copies initiated in a primer-independent manner at internal positions of a single-stranded template (33.Makeyev E.V.

Cell. 2002; 10: 1417-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Different RdRPs appear to utilize the two modes with markedly different efficiencies. For example, Rdr1 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe or RDR6 from Arabidopsis efficiently synthesizes long products (34.Curaba J. Chen X. Biochemical activities of Arabidopsis RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3059-3066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 38.Motamedi M.R. Verdel A.

Two RNAi complexes, RITS and RDRC, physically interact and localize to noncoding centromeric RNAs.Cell. 2004; 119: 789-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), whereas RRF-1 from Caenorhabditis elegans specializes in production of sRNAs (39.Aoki K.

In vitro analyses of the production and activity of secondary small interfering RNAs in C. elegans.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 5007-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These biochemical differences are consistent with in vivo evidence; long dsRNAs generated by Rdr1, RDR2, and RDR6 must be processed by Dicer/RNAse III-like endoribonucleases to generate functional small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), whereas sRNA products of RRF-1 apparently do not require further processing for their secondary siRNA function (16.Baulcombe D.C.

Purified QDE-1 from N. crassa can use both primer-independent and “back-priming” mechanisms in vitro (33.Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. Cellular RNA-dependent RNA polymerase involved in posttranscriptional gene silencing has two distinct activity modes.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1417-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 35.Aalto A.P. Poranen M.M. Grimes J.M. Stuart D.I. Bamford D.H.

Chem. 2010; 285: 29367-29374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of QDE-1 catalytic fragment, thus far the only known structure of a cell-encoded RdRP, suggests that this enzyme is a homodimer with the two subunits adopting either “closed” or “open” conformation (40.Salgado P.S. Koivunen M.R. Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. Stuart D.I. Grimes J.M. The structure of an RNAi polymerase links RNA silencing and transcription.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e434Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the two structurally distinct conformations may help this remarkably versatile enzyme choose between different activities (40.Salgado P.S. Koivunen M.R. Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. Stuart D.I. Grimes J.M. The structure of an RNAi polymerase links RNA silencing and transcription.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e434Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of structural information for corresponding enzyme-substrate complexes, whether QDE-1 in fact remains a dimer upon template binding is unknown. Moreover, it remains to be seen whether other RdRPs can form homodimers, an important question, given that at least some RdRPs behave as monomers in solution (36.Talsky K.B. Collins K. Initiation by a eukaryotic RNA-dependent RNA polymerase requires looping of the template end and is influenced by the template-tailing activity of an associated uridyltransferase.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27614-27623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). On a more fundamental level, how new functional properties evolve in the RdRPs (and in other protein families for that matter) is poorly understood. Gene duplication followed by paralog divergence is a major driving force in protein evolution (41.Long M. VanKuren N.W. Chen S. Vibranovski M.D. New gene evolution: little did we know.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2013; 47: 307-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 42.Chen S. Krinsky B.H. Long M. New genes as drivers of phenotypic evolution.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2013; 14: 645-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and it clearly contributed to RdRP diversification. Indeed, many species encode more than one distinct RdRP, with three paralogous genes present in N. crassa (QDE-1, SAD-1, and RRP-3), four in C. elegans, and six in Arabidopsis (14.Wassenegger M. Krczal G. Nomenclature and functions of RNA-directed RNA polymerases.Trends Plant Sci. 2006; 11: 142-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The last eukaryotic common ancestor might have contained three functionally distinct RdRPs giving rise to the α, β, and γ branches of the RdRP genealogy, an arrangement that was further modified by lineage-specific gene duplications and losses (43.Zong J. Yao X. Yin J. Zhang D. Ma H. Evolution of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) genes: duplications and possible losses before and after the divergence of major eukaryotic groups.Gene. 2009; 447: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Species-specific members of individual paralogous groups, referred to as orthologs, are typically assumed to have similar biological activities (44.Koonin E.V. Orthologs, paralogs, and evolutionary genomics.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 309-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). However, it has been alternatively proposed that divergence of orthologous sequences might frequently result in acquisition of novel functional properties (45.Studer R.A. Robinson-Rechavi M. How confident can we be that orthologs are similar, but paralogs differ?.Trends Genet. 2009; 25: 210-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Until recently, it has been difficult to investigate these possibilities experimentally because genomes of just a few distantly related model organisms have been sequenced completely.

https://openalex.org/W2284990108,"Essential hypertension is considered to be a multifactorial disorder and its aetiology has yet to be clearly identified. As the adenosine receptors have a significant role in mediating vasodilation, alterations in their structures or signalling pathways may be involved in the development of hypertension. This study aimed to measure the expression of adenosine A3 receptors in a range of cardiovascular tissues and determine whether they could be altered with essential hypertension, and to functionally test responses to adenosine A3 receptor agonists in coronary blood vessels using the isolated perfused heart preparation.mRNA samples from cardiovascular tissues and a range of blood vessels were collected from 10 week old male spontaneously hypertensive rats and age-gender matched Wistar rats (n = 8). The Langendorff heart perfusion preparation was used to characterise adenosine A3 receptor mediated coronary vasodilation in the rat heart.Adenosine A3 receptor agonists induced coronary vasodilation. The expression of adenosine A3 receptors in cardiovascular tissues was altered in a tissue-specific pattern. Specifically, down-regulation of adenosine A3 receptor expression occurred in hypertensive hearts, which might be associated with attenuated vasodilator responses observed in coronary vessels to adenosine A3 receptor agonists.This study demonstrated alterations in the expression of adenosine A3 receptors occurred in a tissue specific mode, and reduced adenosine A3 receptor mediated coronary vasodilation in hearts from spontaneously hypertensive rats. Our findings with regard to changes in the adenosine A3 receptor in hypertensive hearts suggest that adenosine A3 receptor might play a role in the physiopathology of essential hypertension and potentially open the way to pharmacologic manipulation of vasomotor activity by the use of adenosine A3 receptor agonists."
https://openalex.org/W2280284545,"The Magnificent Frigatebird Fregata magnificens has a pantropical distribution, nesting on islands along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. In the Caribbean, there is little genetic structure among colonies; however, the genetic structure among the colonies off Brazil and its relationship with those in the Caribbean are unknown. In this study, we used mtDNA and microsatellite markers to infer population structure and evolutionary history in a sample of F. magnificens individuals collected in Brazil, Grand Connétable (French Guyana), and Barbuda. Virtually all Brazilian individuals had the same mtDNA haplotype. There was no haplotype sharing between Brazil and the Caribbean, though Grand Connétable shared haplotypes with both regions. A Bayesian clustering analysis using microsatellite data found two genetic clusters: one associated with Barbuda and the other with the Brazilian populations. Grand Connétable was more similar to Barbuda but had ancestry from both clusters, corroborating its “intermediate” position. The Caribbean and Grand Connétable populations showed higher genetic diversity and effective population size compared to the Brazilian population. Overall, our results are in good agreement with an effect of marine winds in isolating the Brazilian meta-population."
https://openalex.org/W2413140095,"Voluntary Medical Male circumcision (VMMC) is an evidence-based, yet under-utilized biomedical HIV intervention in China. No study has investigated acceptability of VMMC among male sexually transmitted diseases patients (MSTDP) who are at high risk of HIV transmission. A cross-sectional survey interviewed 350 HIV negative heterosexual MSTDP in Shenzhen, China; 12.0% (n = 42) of them were circumcised at the time of survey. When the uncircumcised participants (n = 308) were informed that VMMC could reduce the risk of HIV infection via heterosexual intercourse by 50%, the prevalence of acceptability of VMMC in the next six months was 46.1%. Adjusted for significant background variables, significant factors of acceptability of VMMC included: 1) emotional variables: the Emotional Representation Subscale (adjusted odds ratios, AOR = 1.13, 95%CI: 1.06-1.18), 2) cognitive variables derived from Health Belief Model (HBM): perceived some chance of having sex with HIV positive women in the next 12 months (AOR = 2.48, 95%CI: 1.15-5.33) (perceived susceptibility), perceived severity of STD infection (AOR = 1.06, 95%CI: 1.02-1.10), perceived benefit of VMMC in risk reduction (AOR = 1.29, 95%CI: 1.16-1.42) and sexual performance (AOR = 1.45, 95%CI: 1.26-1.71), perceived barriers against taking up VMMC (AOR = 0.88, 95%CI: 0.81-0.95), and perceived cue to action (AOR = 1.41, 95%CI: 1.23-1.61) and self-efficacy (AOR = 1.38, 95%CI: 1.26-1.35) related to taking up VMMC. The association between perceived severity of STD infection and acceptability was fully mediated by emotional representation of STD infection. The relatively low prevalence of circumcision and high acceptability suggested that the situation was favorable for implementing VMMC as a means of HIV intervention among MSTDP in China. HBM is a potential suitable framework to guide the design of future VMMC promotion. Future implementation programs should be conducted in STD clinic settings, taking the important findings of this study into account."
https://openalex.org/W2277265290,"The signaling pathways involved in the generation and maintenance of exocrine gland acinar cells have not yet been established. Primary human salivary gland epithelial cells, derived from salivary gland biopsies, acquired an acinar-like phenotype when the [Ca(2+)] in the serum-free medium (keratinocyte growth medium, KGM) was increased from 0.05 mm (KGM-L) to 1.2 mm (KGM-H). Here we examined the mechanism underlying this Ca(2+)-dependent generation of the acinar cell phenotype. Compared with cells in KGM-L, those in KGM-H display enhancement of Orai1, STIM1, STIM2, and nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFAT1) expression together with an increase in store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE), SOCE-dependent nuclear translocation of pGFP-NFAT1, and NFAT-dependent but not NFκB-dependent gene expression. Importantly, AQP5, an acinar-specific protein critical for function, is up-regulated in KGM-H via SOCE/NFAT-dependent gene expression. We identified critical NFAT binding motifs in the AQP5 promoter that are involved in Ca(2+)-dependent up-regulation of AQP5. These important findings reveal that the Ca(2+)-induced switch of salivary epithelial cells to an acinar-like phenotype involves remodeling of SOCE and NFAT signaling, which together control the expression of proteins critically relevant for acinar cell function. Our data provide a novel strategy for generating and maintaining acinar cells in culture."
https://openalex.org/W2284913871,"For various types of tumor therapy, it is suggested that co-targeting of tumor microenvironment, mainly tumor vasculature, mediates tumor response mechanisms. Immunohistochemistry for glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1), carbonic anhydrase-IX (CAIX), Ki-67, and von Willebrand factor VIII for microvessel density (MVD) were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of canine oral malignant neoplasms. Polarographic oxygen measurements (median pO2) and perfusion data via contrast-enhanced power Doppler ultrasound (median vascularity, median blood volume) provided additional information. Ninety-two samples were analyzed: sarcomas (n = 32), carcinomas (n = 30), and malignant melanomas (n = 30). Polarographic oxygen and perfusion data was available in 22.8% (sarcomas n = 9, carcinomas n = 7, melanomas n = 5), and 27.1% (sarcomas n = 10, carcinomas n = 8, melanomas n = 7) of cases, respectively. GLUT-1 expression was detected in 46.7% of all samples, and was generally weak. CAIX expression was found in 34.8% of all samples. Median Ki-67 score and MVD count was 19% and 17, respectively. The evaluation of the GLUT-1 score and continuous data showed significantly lower GLUT-1 levels in sarcomas (mean 5.1%, SD 6.2) versus carcinomas and melanomas (mean 16.5%/ 19.0%, SD 17.3/ 20.9, p = 0.001). The expression of CAIX correlated mildly positively with GLUT-1 (p = 0.018, rho = 0.250) as well as with Ki-67 (p = 0.014, rho = 0.295). MVD showed a significantly lower level in melanomas (mean 12.6, SD 7.7) versus sarcomas and carcinomas (mean 21.8/ 26.9, SD 13.0/20.4, p = 0.001). Median vascularity and blood volume were significantly lower in sarcomas (mean 10.4%, SD 11.0, and mean 6.3%, SD 6.5, respectively) versus carcinomas (mean 39.2%, SD 16.4 and mean 33.0%, SD 25.6, respectively) and melanomas (mean 36.0%, SD 18.3, and 31.5%, SD 24.5). Between the 3 histological groups, there was neither a significant difference in the GLUT-1 and CAIX score and continuous data, nor the Ki67 score, or polarographic oxygen measurements. GLUT-1 continuous data and Ki-67 (p<0.001, rho = 0.403), as well as Ki-67 and MVD (p = 0.029, rho = 0.228) correlated positively and a mild correlation was found between vascularity and GLUT-1 (p = 0.043, rho = 0.408). GLUT-1, CAIX, proliferative index and MVD levels were established as microenvironmental descriptors with the purpose of creating a baseline in order to follow changes seen in the tumor microenvironment after hypofractionated radiation with high doses."
https://openalex.org/W2952144661,"Experimental measurements require calibration to transform measured signals into physically meaningful values. The conventional approach has two steps: the experimenter deduces a conversion function using measurements on standards and then calibrates (or normalizes) measurements on unknown samples with this function. The deduction of the conversion function from only the standard measurements causes the results to be quite sensitive to experimental noise. It also implies that any data collected without reliable standards must be discarded. Here we show that a “1-step calibration method” reduces these problems for the common situation in which samples are measured in batches, where a batch could be an immunoblot (Western blot), an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a sequence of spectra, or a microarray, provided that some sample measurements are replicated across multiple batches. The 1-step method computes all calibration results iteratively from all measurements. It returns the most probable values for the sample compositions under the assumptions of a statistical model, making them the maximum likelihood predictors. It is less sensitive to measurement error on standards and enables use of some batches that do not include standards. In direct comparison of both real and simulated immunoblot data, the 1-step method consistently exhibited smaller errors than the conventional “2-step” method. These results suggest that the 1-step method is likely to be most useful for cases where experimenters want to analyze existing data that are missing some standard measurements and where experimenters want to extract the best results possible from their data. Open source software for both methods is available for download or on-line use."
https://openalex.org/W2285664685,"Within its mammalian host, Leishmania resides and replicates as an intracellular parasite. The direct activity of antileishmanials must therefore depend on intracellular drug transport, metabolism, and accumulation within the host cell. In this study, we explored the role of human macrophage transporters in the intracellular accumulation and antileishmanial activity of miltefosine (MLF), the only oral drug available for the treatment of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Membrane transporter gene expression in primary human macrophages infected in vitro with Leishmania Viannia panamensis and exposed to MLF showed modulation of ABC and solute liquid carrier transporters gene transcripts. Among these, ABCA3, a lipid transporter, was significantly induced after exposure to MLF, and this induction was confirmed in primary macrophages from CL patients. Functional validation of MLF as a substrate for ABCA3 was performed by shRNA gene knockdown (KD) in THP-1 monocytes. Intracellular accumulation of radiolabeled MLF was significantly higher in ABCA3(KD) macrophages. ABCA3(KD) resulted in increased cytotoxicity induced by MLF exposure. ABCA3 gene expression inversely correlated with intracellular MLF content in primary macrophages from CL patients. ABCA3(KD) reduced parasite survival during macrophage infection with an L. V. panamensis strain exhibiting low in vitro susceptibility to MLF. Confocal microscopy showed ABCA3 to be located in the cell membrane of resting macrophages and in intracellular compartments in L. V. panamensis-infected cells. These results provide evidence of ABCA3 as an MLF efflux transporter in human macrophages and support its role in the direct antileishmanial effect of this alkylphosphocholine drug."
https://openalex.org/W2277706440,"This paper presents a two-level scheduling scheme for video transmission over downlink orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) networks. It aims to maximize the aggregate quality of the video users subject to the playback delay and resource constraints, by exploiting the multiuser diversity and the video characteristics. The upper level schedules the transmission of video packets among multiple users based on an overall target bit-error-rate (BER), the importance level of packet and resource consumption efficiency factor. Instead, the lower level renders unequal error protection (UEP) in terms of target BER among the scheduled packets by solving a weighted sum distortion minimization problem, where each user weight reflects the total importance level of the packets that has been scheduled for that user. Frequency-selective power is then water-filled over all the assigned subcarriers in order to leverage the potential channel coding gain. Realistic simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art scheduling scheme by up to 6.8 dB in terms of peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR). Further test evaluates the suitability of equal power allocation which is the common assumption in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W2280576041,"Introduction This pilot study developed techniques to perform Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of specific fat deposition in 18 children (age 18 months to 4 years). Methods The children engaged in a series of practice tests to become acclimated to the scanner noises, reduce claustrophobia, and rehearse holding still for a set time. The practice tests assessed if the child could remain still for two minutes while watching a video, first while lying on a blanket, second, on the blanket with headphones, and third, in the mock scanner. The children who passed the three practice tests were then scanned with a 3T Siemens Skyra magnet. Abdominal fat distribution (region of interest (ROI) from the top of the ileac crest to the bottom of the ribcage) volume was measured using 2-point DIXON technique. This region was chosen to give an indication of the body composition around the liver. Results Twelve out of eighteen participants successfully completed the actual MRI scan. Chi-squared test showed no significant difference between male and female pass-fail rates. The median age of completed scans was 36 months, whereas the median age for children unable to complete a scan was 28 months. The average total trunk fat was 240.9±85.2mL and the average total VAT was 37.7±25.9mLand liver fat was not quantifiable due to physiological motion. Several strategies (modeling, videos, and incentives) were identified to improve pediatric imaging in different age ranges. Conclusion Using an age-specific and tailored protocol, we were able to successfully use MRI for fat imaging in a majority of young children. Development of such protocols enables researchers to better understand the etiology of fat deposition in young children, which can be used to aid in the prevention and treatment of adiposity."
https://openalex.org/W2280413560,"Background 
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common viral infection among injecting drug users worldwide. We aimed to assess HCV antibody prevalence and associated risk factors among clients in the Chinese national methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) program.


Methods 
Data from 296,209 clients who enrolled in the national MMT program between March 2004 and December 2012 were analyzed to assess HCV antibody prevalence, associated risk factors, and geographical distribution.


Results 
Anti-HCV screening was positive for 54.6% of clients upon MMT entry between 2004 and 2012. HCV antibody prevalence at entry declined from 66.8% in 2005 to 45.9% in 2012. The most significant predictors of HCV seropositivity were injecting drug use (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 8.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.17–8.52, p<0.0001) and a history of drug use ≥9 years (AOR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.96–2.06, p<0.0001). Being female, of Uyghur or Zhuang ethnicity, and unmarried were identified as demographic risk factors (all p-values<0.0001). Of the 28 provincial-level divisions included in the study, we found that 5 divisions had HCV antibody prevalence above 70% and 20 divisions above 50%. The HCV screening rate within 6 months after MMT entry greatly increased from 30.4% in 2004 to 93.1% in 2012.


Conclusions 
The current HCV antibody prevalence remains alarmingly high among MMT clients throughout most provincial-level divisions in China, particularly among injecting drug users and females. A comprehensive prevention strategy is needed to control the HCV epidemic among MMT clients in China."
https://openalex.org/W2281640380,"Procedural learning is a form of memory where people implicitly acquire a skill through repeated practice. People with Parkinson’s disease (PD) have been found to acquire motor adaptation, a form of motor procedural learning, similarly to healthy older adults but they have deficits in long-term retention. A similar pattern of normal learning on initial exposure with a deficit in retention seen on subsequent days has also been seen in mirror-reading, a form of non-motor procedural learning. It is a well-studied fact that disrupting sleep will impair the consolidation of procedural memories. Given the prevalence of sleep disturbances in PD, the lack of retention on following days seen in these studies could simply be a side effect of this well-known symptom of PD. Because of this, we wondered whether people with PD would present with deficits in the short-term retention of a non-motor procedural learning task, when the test of retention was done the same day as the initial exposure. The aim of the present study was then to investigate acquisition and retention in the immediate short term of cognitive procedural learning using the mirror-reading task in people with PD. This task involved two conditions: one where triads of mirror-inverted words were always new that allowed assessing the learning of mirror-reading skill and another one where some of the triads were presented repeatedly during the experiment that allowed assessing the word-specific learning. People with PD both ON and OFF their normal medication were compared to healthy older adults and young adults. Participants were re-tested 50 minutes break after initial exposure to probe for short-term retention. The results of this study show that all groups of participants acquired and retained the two skills (mirror-reading and word-specific) similarly. These results suggest that neither healthy ageing nor the degeneration within the basal ganglia that occurs in PD does affect the mechanisms that underpin the acquisition of these new non-motor procedural learning skills and their short-term memories."
https://openalex.org/W2276973536,"Introduced by Bishop et al. in 1996, Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM) is a powerful nonlinear latent variable modeling approach for visualizing high-dimensional data. It has shown useful when typical linear methods fail. However, GTM still suffers from drawbacks. Its complex parameterization of data make GTM hard to fit and sensitive to slight changes in the model. For this reason, we extend GTM to a visual analytics framework so that users may guide the parameterization and assess the data from multiple GTM perspectives. Specifically, we develop the theory and methods for Visual to Parametric Interaction (V2PI) with data using GTM visualizations. The result is a dynamic version of GTM that fosters data exploration. We refer to the new version as V2PI-GTM. In this paper, we develop V2PI-GTM in stages and demonstrate its benefits within the context of a text mining case study."

Still, ~30% of HPV testing is performed on specimens in this formalin-containing preservative. Formalin-induced DNA fragmentation and cross-linking may interfere with HPV detection. We evaluated analytical sensitivity and specimen stability of the cobas 4800 HPV (Roche) and Hybrid Capture 2 HPV (HC2, Qiagen) tests with residual cervical cytology samples in SurePath preservative available within 1 week of collection. Cobas testing was performed with and without heating samples at 120°C for 20 min diluted 1:1 in an alkaline environment (pretreatment) to revert DNA crosslinking. Stability was tested after 2 weeks of storage at ambient temperature followed by ≤10 weeks at 4°C. Analytical sensitivity and positivity rates (HC2, 18%; cobas pretreated, 46%; cobas untreated, 47%) were greater for cobas than HC2 (n = 682). After 6 weeks of storage, mean HC2 ratios were lower (mean 0.9, SD 6.3) but high variability limited statistical power to detect trends. Cobas threshold cycles (Ct's) increased in untreated (mean 2.1) but not pretreated samples (mean 0.3; n = 110; p≤0.0001). Overall, cobas had greater analytical sensitivity for samples in SurePath preservative. Although pretreatment introduced a manual sample transfer step and 30 min of incubation times, it improved stability without negatively affecting analytical sensitivity. While awaiting results of large trials to evaluate the clinical performance of cobas, the addition of the pretreatment step may improve the detection of HPV, especially after prolonged sample storage."
https://openalex.org/W2285935191,"The Ohio Department of Transportation has more than 60 facilities without sewer access generating approximately 19 million gallons of winter maintenance wash water. Off-site disposal is costly, creating the need for sustainable management strategies. The objective of this study was to conduct an exploratory feasibility analysis to assess wash water disposal and potential reuse as brine. Based on a comprehensive literature review and relevant environmental chemistry, a sampling protocol consisting of 31 water quality constituents was utilized for monthly sampling at three geographically distinct Ohio Department of Transportation garages during the winter of 2012. Results were compared to local disposal and reuse guidance limits. Three constituents, including a maximum copper concentration of 858 ppb, exceeded disposal limits, and many constituents also failed to meet reuse limits. Some concentrations were orders of magnitude higher than reuse limits and suggest pre-treatment would be necessary if wash water were reused as brine. These water quality results, in conjunction with copper chemical equilibrium modeling, show pH and dissolved carbon both significantly impact the total dissolved copper concentration and should be measured to assess reuse potential. The sampling protocol and specific obstacles highlighted in this paper aid in the future development of sustainable wash water management strategies."
