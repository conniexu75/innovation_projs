The aims of this study were to determine whether chlorogenic acid can prevent estrogen deficiency-induced osteoporosis and to analyze the mechanism of CGA bioactivity. The effect of CGA on estrogen deficiency-induced osteoporosis was performed in vivo. Sixty female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly among a sham-operated group and five ovariectomy (OVX) plus treatment subgroups: saline vehicle, 17α-ethinylestradiol (E2), or CGA at 9, 27, or 45 mg/kg/d. The rats’ femoral metaphyses were evaluated by micro-computed tomography (μCT). The mechanism of CGA bioactivity was investigated in vitro. Bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were treated with CGA, with or without phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002. BMSCs proliferation and osteoblast differentiation were assessed with 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and alkaline phosphatase, with or without Shp2 interfering RNA (RNAi). The results display that CGA at 27 and 45 mg/kg/day inhibited the decrease of bone mineral density (BMD) that induced by OVX in femur (p< 0.01), significantly promoted the levels of bone turnover markers, and prevented bone volume fraction (BV/TV), connectivity density (CoonD), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) (all p< 0.01) to decrease and prevented the trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), structure model index (SMI)(both p< 0.01) to increase. CGA at 1 or 10 μM enhanced BMSC proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. CGA at 0.1 to 10 μM increased phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) and cyclin D1. These effects were reversed by LY294002. CGA at 1 or 10 μM increased BMSC differentiation to osteoblasts (p< 0.01), Shp2 RNAi suppressed CGA-induced osteoblast differentiation by decreasing Shp2, p-Akt, and cyclin D1. This study found that CGA improved the BMD and trabecular micro-architecture for the OVX-induced osteoporosis. Therefore, CGA might be an effective alternative treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis. CGA promoted proliferation of osteoblast precursors and osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs via the Shp2/PI3K/Akt/cyclin D1 pathway."

It is involved in multiple interactions that are essential for the polymerase function. Most prominently it positions the polymerase complex onto the nucleocapsid, but also acts as a chaperone for the nucleoprotein. Mononegavirales phosphoproteins lack sequence conservation, but contain all large disordered regions. We show here that N- and C-terminal intrinsically disordered regions account for 80% of the phosphoprotein of the respiratory syncytial virus. But these regions display marked dynamic heterogeneity. Whereas almost stable helices are formed C terminally to the oligomerization domain, extremely transient helices are present in the N-terminal region. They all mediate internal long-range contacts in this non-globular protein. Transient secondary elements together with fully disordered regions also provide protein binding sites recognized by the respiratory syncytial virus nucleoprotein and compatible with weak interactions required for the processivity of the polymerase."

But their role in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and coronary artery disease (CAD) is still in infancy. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of gene expression and serum levels of CTRP3 and CTRP13 with CAD, metabolic and inflammatory markers in patients with and without T2DM. Serum levels of CTRP3, CTRP13, adiponectin and inflammatory cytokines and their gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were determined in 172 subjects categorized as group I (without T2DM and CAD), group II (with CAD but no T2DM), group III (with T2DM but no CAD) and group IV (with T2DM and CAD). Serum levels and gene expression of CTRP3, CTRP13 and adiponectin in the group I were higher compared to other groups. Inflammatory cytokines in the control group were lower than other groups too. CTRP3 serum levels have an independent association with BMI, smoking and CTRP3 gene expression; also CTRP13 serum levels has an independent association with BMI, HDL-C, insulin, HOMA-IR, HbA1c and TNF-α. Decreased serum levels of CTRP3 and CTRP13 were also associated with CAD. It appears that the decreased levels of CTRP3 and especially CTRP13 were associated with increased risk of T2DM and CAD. These findings suggest an emerging role of these adipokines in the pathogenesis of CAD, but further studies are necessary to establish this concept."

https://openalex.org/W2563796028,"Intervention into amyloid deposition with anti-amyloid agents like the polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is emerging as an experimental secondary treatment strategy in systemic light chain amyloidosis (AL). In both AL and multiple myeloma (MM), soluble immunoglobulin light chains (LC) are produced by clonal plasma cells, but only in AL do they form amyloid deposits in vivo We investigated the amyloid formation of patient-derived LC and their susceptibility to EGCG in vitro to probe commonalities and systematic differences in their assembly mechanisms. We isolated nine LC from the urine of AL and MM patients. We quantified their thermodynamic stabilities and monitored their aggregation under physiological conditions by thioflavin T fluorescence, light scattering, SDS stability, and atomic force microscopy. LC from all patients formed amyloid-like aggregates, albeit with individually different kinetics. LC existed as dimers, ∼50% of which were linked by disulfide bridges. Our results suggest that cleavage into LC monomers is required for efficient amyloid formation. The kinetics of AL LC displayed a transition point in concentration dependence, which MM LC lacked. The lack of concentration dependence of MM LC aggregation kinetics suggests that conformational change of the light chain is rate-limiting for these proteins. Aggregation kinetics displayed two distinct phases, which corresponded to the formation of oligomers and amyloid fibrils, respectively. EGCG specifically inhibited the second aggregation phase and induced the formation of SDS-stable, non-amyloid LC aggregates. Our data suggest that EGCG intervention does not depend on the individual LC sequence and is similar to the mechanism observed for amyloid-β and α-synuclein."

Here, we find that Sall4 is highly expressed in oocytes and early embryos. To investigate the roles of SALL4 in oogenesis, we generated Sall4 maternal specific knock-out mice by using CRISPR/Cas9 system, and we find that the maternal deletion of Sall4 causes developmental arrest of oocytes at germinal vesicle stage with non-surrounded nucleus, and the subsequent meiosis resumption is prohibited. We further discover that the loss of maternal Sall4 causes failure in establishment of DNA methylation in oocytes. Furthermore, we find that Sall4 modulates H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modifications by regulating the expression of key histone demethylases coding genes Kdm5b, Kdm6a, and Kdm6b in oocytes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the aberrant H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 cause mis-expression of genes that are critical for oocytes maturation and meiosis resumption.

Taken together, our study explores a pivotal role of Sall4 in regulating epigenetic maturation of mouse oocytes. In mammals, oocyte maturation is an important developmental process, which is prerequisite for the subsequent fertilization and embryo development. In mice, oocytes reside in the ovarian follicles, and follicles can be divided into five stages according to the developmental process: primordial follicle, primary follicle, secondary follicle, early antral follicle, and antral follicle (1van den Hurk R. Zhao J. Formation of mammalian oocytes and their growth, differentiation and maturation within ovarian follicles.Theriogenology. 2005; 63: 1717-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). During this process, the oocyte will undergo maturation as the follicle grows into antral follicle. Then the mature oocyte acquires the ability to resume meiosis with its nucleus forming surrounded nuclear (SN) 4The abbreviations used are: SNsurrounded nuclearDNMTDNA methyltransferaseESCembryonic stem cellNuRDnucleosome remodeling and deacetylaseqRT-PCRquantitative real time PCRIFimmunofluorescenceGVBDgerminal vesicle breakdown5mC5-methylcytosineUHPLC-MS/MSultra high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrople mass spectrometryRRBSreduced representation bisulfite sequencingSFsecondary follicleEAFearly antral folliclegDMRgerm cell differentially methylated regionPnpostnatal day n. conformation and the transcription quiescence occurring simultaneously. surrounded nuclear DNA methyltransferase embryonic stem cell nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase quantitative real time PCR immunofluorescence germinal vesicle breakdown 5-methylcytosine ultra high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrople mass spectrometry reduced representation bisulfite sequencing secondary follicle early antral follicle germ cell differentially methylated region postnatal day n. The oocyte maturation encompasses the following three main processes: nuclear maturation, cytoplasmic maturation, and epigenetic maturation. Comparing with the nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation, the underlying mechanism of oocyte epigenetic maturation is not fully understood. Previous studies have indicated that DNA methylation and histone modifications play functional roles in oocytes maturation. De novo DNA methylation starts to occur in the secondary follicle oocytes and completes when oocytes acquire the competence of resuming meiosis (2Smallwood S.A. Tomizawa S. Krueger F. Ruf N. Carli N. Segonds-Pichon A. Sato S. Hata K. Andrews S.R. Kelsey G. Dynamic CpG island methylation landscape in oocytes and preimplantation embryos.Nat. Genet. 2011; 43: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Among all the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), DNMT3A and DNMT3L are mainly responsible for the establishment of DNA methylome in oocytes (3Kaneda M. Okano M. Hata K. Sado T. Tsujimoto N. Li E. Sasaki H. Essential role for de novo DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a in paternal and maternal imprinting.Nature. 2004; 429: 900-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, as another important epigenetic modification, histone modifications have been demonstrated important for chromosome organization, chromosome segregation, and meiotic resumption during oocytes maturation (4Gu L. Wang Q. Sun Q.Y. Histone modifications during mammalian oocyte maturation: dynamics, regulation and functions.Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 1942-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, it remains elusive how histone modifications are regulated and to what extent the transcriptome is influenced during oocytes maturation. SALL4, as a zinc finger protein, was first identified in Drosophila. In humans, SALL4 mutations cause Okihiro syndrome, with multiple organs having developmental abnormalities (5Al-Baradie R. Yamada K. St Hilaire C. Chan W.M. Andrews C. McIntosh N. Nakano M. Martonyi E.J. Raymond W.R. Okumura S. Okihiro M.M. Engle E.C. Duane radial ray syndrome (Okihiro syndrome) maps to 20q13 and results from mutations in SALL4, a new member of the SAL family.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 1195-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In mice, Sall4 is primarily expressed in early embryos, embryonic stem cells (ESCs), primordial germ cells, and germ cells with different and specific functions. Sall4 null embryos die shortly after implantation on embryonic day 6.5 (6Sakaki-Yumoto M. Kobayashi C. Sato A. Fujimura S. Matsumoto Y. Takasato M. Kodama T. Aburatani H. Asashima M. Yoshida N. Nishinakamura R.

In ESCs, Sall4 can activate the pluripotent master gene Pou5f1 (7Zhang J. Tam W.L. Tong G.Q. Wu Q. Chan H.Y. Soh B.S. Lou Y. Yang J. Ma Y. Chai L. Ng H.H. Lufkin T. Robson P. Lim B.

Fujimura S. Nimura K. Takeda N. Toyooka Y. Fujimura Y. Aburatani H. Ura K. Koseki H. Niwa H. Nishinakamura R. Sall4 is essential for stabilization, but not for pluripotency, of embryonic stem cells by repressing aberrant trophectoderm gene expression.Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 796-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that SALL4 acts as an epigenetic regulator in ESCs by recruiting DNMTs, HDAC1, and HDAC2 to methylate CpG islands and deacetylate the histone tails in active chromatin regions (9Yang J. Corsello T.R. Ma Y. Stem cell gene SALL4 suppresses transcription through recruitment of DNA methyltransferases.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 1996-2005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In germ cell development, Sall4 plays essential roles in ensuring the correct specification and migration of primordial germ cells (10Yamaguchi Y.L. Tanaka S.S. Kumagai M. Fujimoto Y. Terabayashi T. Matsui Y. Nishinakamura R. Sall4 is essential for mouse primordial germ cell specification by suppressing somatic cell program genes.Stem Cells. 2015; 33: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In male mice, SALL4 interacts with PLZF and promotes the specification of spermatogonial progenitor cells (11Hobbs R.M. Fagoonee S. Papa A. Webster K. Altruda F. Nishinakamura R. Chai L. Pandolfi P.P. Functional antagonism between Sall4 and Plzf defines germline progenitors.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 284-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, whether Sall4 functions in oogenesis remains unknown. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether the maternal Sall4 plays a role in oocyte maturation and subsequent totipotency establishment. We first confirmed that Sall4 is highly expressed in oocytes at different developmental stages. Then we investigated the function and mechanism of SALL4 in oogenesis by specifically deleting Sall4 in oocytes. Our results indicate that maternal SALL4 functions as an epigenetic modulator and plays an essential role in the epigenetic maturation of oocytes. We first identified the expression pattern of Sall4 in oogenesis by conducting quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunofluorescence (IF) staining. Sall4 expression begins in primary follicle stage oocytes and continues accumulating as the oocytes grow (Fig. 1, A and B). During this period, SALL4 was localized in the nucleus (Fig. 1B). When germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) occurs, SALL4 diffuses into the cytoplasm (Fig. 1E, MII). After fertilization, SALL4 aggregates in the pronuclei but dramatically degenerates during the first cleavage. Then SALL4 re-expressed and accumulated until the formation of blastocyst (Fig. 1, D and E). The live cell imaging of oocytes collected from Sall4-mCherry transgenic mice further confirmed this expression and localization pattern of SALL4 (Fig. 1, C and F). These results imply that SALL4 may be a maternal factor and play important roles in oogenesis and preimplantation embryo development. To identify the effects of maternal SALL4 in oogenesis, we first generated Sall4fl/fl mice using CRISPR/Cas9 system. By crossing with Zp3-Cre or Gdf9-Cre transgenic mice, we then obtained Sall4fl/fl;Zp3-Cre and Sall4fl/fl;Gdf9-Cre mice in which Sall4 was deleted specifically in primary follicle stage or primordial follicle stage oocytes, respectively (Fig. 2A). The knock-out effects were validated by immunohistochemistry, genotyping, Western blotting, and IF staining (Figs. 3A and 2, B–D). Subsequently we found that both Sall4fl/fl;Zp3-Cre and Sall4fl/fl;Gdf9-Cre female mice were infertile (Table 1). Furthermore, hematoxylin and eosin staining indicated that antral follicles were absent in ovaries of both genotypes (Fig. 3, A and F). Apart from histological results, the non-SN conformation and high transcription activity in SALL4 null oocytes further indicated that they were immature (Fig. 3, B and C). Moreover, to identify whether SALL4 null oocytes were partially competent to resume meiosis, we co-cultured the WT or SALL4 null oocytes with WT granulosa cells in vitro for 16 h. The results showed that SALL4 null oocytes could not undergo GVBD (Fig. 3, D and E), indicating that SALL4 null oocytes were not even partially mature.FIGURE 3SALL4 null oocytes are immature.

IF staining showed that the contents and localization of NuRD complex core components and DNMT3B were not altered in SALL4 null oocytes (supplemental Fig. S1, A–C). Surprisingly, the nuclear localization of DNMT3A was obviously lost in SALL4 null oocytes (Fig. 4A), and the IF staining for 5-methylcytosine (5mC) showed that the SALL4 null oocytes were hypomethylated (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, using an ultrasensitive ultra high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrople mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) approach for absolute quantification analysis of 5mC demonstrated that the DNA methylation levels in SALL4 null oocytes was ∼75% lower than WT oocytes (Fig. 4C). To obtain a detailed DNA methylation profile of SALL4 null oocytes, we performed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) using secondary follicle (SF) stage and early antral follicle (EAF) stage oocytes from Sall4fl/fl;Zp3-Cre mice and Sall4fl/fl mice separately. The result showed that the whole genome of SALL4 null oocytes were extensively hypomethylated. Moreover, the maternal germ cell differentially methylated regions (gDMRs) and imprinting control regions were barely methylated. In addition, the repeated elements were also hypomethylated (Fig. 4D). The bisulfite sequencing PCR on maternal gDMRs (Igf2r and Mcst2) and repetitive sequence regions (Line1 and IAP-LTR) further confirmed the results of RRBS analysis (Fig. 4E). Therefore, the loss of SALL4 can cause de novo DNA methylation failure probably by influencing the nuclear deposition of DNMT3A. To further verify why SALL4 null oocytes cannot undergo maturation, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on SF and EAF stage oocytes from Sall4fl/fl;Zp3-Cre and Sall4fl/fl mice, respectively. The RNA-Seq results showed that more than 4,000 genes were mis-expressed in SALL4 null oocytes (Fig. 5, A and B). Specifically, SALL4 null SF and EAF stage oocytes showed 2,230 down-regulated genes (with 973 genes overlapped) and 2,030 up-regulated genes (with 738 genes overlapped) (Fig. 5, C and D). Then we conducted Gene Ontology analysis on the overlapped differentially expressed genes. There was a lot of phosphorylation, and oxidative stress response-related genes were highly expressed in SALL4 null oocytes. The transmission electron microscopy analysis also showed that the SALL4 null oocytes have much thinner zona pellucida, abnormal mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum (supplemental Fig. S2A), whereas the down-regulated genes in SALL4 null oocytes were mainly chromosome organization-, transcription regulation-, and cell cycle-related (Fig. 5E). Above all, SALL4 null oocytes showed obvious disorders in metabolism, transcriptome, and epigenome. Moreover, the aberrant expression of cell cycle-related genes can partially explain why SALL4 null oocytes cannot undergo GVBD. We then analyzed the correlation between the transcriptome disorders and DNA methylome abnormalities by comparing gene expression levels and methylation levels of gene promoter regions. In SALL4 null oocytes, the hypomethylated or hypermethylated genes relative to WT oocytes showed no correlation with gene expression levels (Fig. 5F), which indicates that DNA methylation cannot explain the transcriptome disorders in SALL4 null oocytes. In view of the extensive and dramatic alteration of transcriptome in SALL4 null oocytes, we inferred that SALL4 might regulate transcription through modulating some other epigenetic modifications. Therefore, we combined the published SALL4 ChIP-Seq data (GSE73390) (12Lovelace D.L. Gao Z. Mutoji K. Song Y.C. Ruan J. Hermann B.P. The regulatory repertoire of PLZF and SALL4 in undifferentiated spermatogonia.Development. 2016; 143: 1893-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with our RNA-Seq data to screen histone modification-related genes, which are regulated by SALL4. Then we focused on several histone lysine demethylase coding genes: Kdm5b, Kdm6a, and Kdm6b. In detail, the abnormal high expression level of Kdm5b, as well as the low expression levels of Kdm6a and Kdm6b in SALL4 null oocytes, were confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 6A). In addition, ChIP-Seq data and luciferase reporter assays showed SALL4 bound primarily at the promoter of these genes (Fig. 6B and supplemental Fig. S2B). Correspondingly, the level of H3K4me3 was lower, and the level of H3K27me3 was higher in SALL4 null oocytes compared with WT oocytes (Fig. 6, C and D, and supplemental Fig. S3A). Thus, we hypothesized that the abnormalities of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 levels might account for the transcriptome disorders in SALL4 null oocytes. To validate this hypothesis, we then injected Kdm5b mRNA and siRNAs targeting Kdm6a and Kdm6b together into postnatal day 10 (P10) WT oocytes, which was set as the experimental group. For control group oocytes, GFP mRNA and scramble siRNAs were injected. IF staining results demonstrated that the oocytes in experimental group could mimic the changes of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 observed in SALL4 null oocytes (Fig. 7A). After in vitro culture and maturation induction, the GVBD rate of oocytes was calculated. The results showed that ∼70% oocytes could undergo GVBD in control group, whereas the GVBD rate in experimental group was only 25% (Fig. 7, B and C). Moreover, RNA-Seq analysis was conducted on oocytes randomly collected from both experimental and control group separately. Then we analyzed the functions of overlapped mis-expressed genes in both the experimental group oocytes and the SALL4 null oocytes, and found that the overlapped mis-expressed genes were mainly related to responses of hormone stimulations and cell surface-linked signal transduction (Fig. 7D). Among these genes, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor alfha1 (Gfra1) was well studied in oogenesis. During oocytes maturation, human chorionic gonadotropin stimulates the granulosa cells to secret glial cell-derived neurotrophic factors, which further induce the oocytes to grow and mature (13Dole G.

Moreover, the platelet derived growth factor α (Pdgfa) and prolactin receptor (Prlr) have been reported to be essential for oocyte maturation by their functions in oocytes-granulosa cells interactions (16Sleer L.S.

In addition, the down-regulation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (Mtor) and homeobox A7 (Hoxa7) has been shown to be detrimental to oocyte growth (18Huntriss J. Hinkins M.

Haemost. 2015; 114: 969-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To further verify whether these oogenesis related genes are regulated by H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 levels, we performed ChIP-qPCR assays. Because of the shortage of oocytes, we applied ultra low input ChIP-qPCR to investigate the levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 on the promoter regions of Gfra1, Pdgfa, Prlr, Mtor, and Hoxa7. The results showed that the H3K4me3 levels on the promoters of these genes in SALL4 null oocytes are much lower than in the WT oocytes (Fig. 7E, upper panel), and the H3K27me3 levels on the promoters of these genes in SALL4 null oocytes are much higher than in the WT oocytes (Fig. 7E, lower panel). Therefore, we can conclude that H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 regulate the expression of Gfra1, Pdgfa, Prlr, Mtor, and Hoxa7 in oocytes. Above all, we verified that the proper levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 guard the normal transcriptome, which are critical for oocyte-granulosa cell interactions and oocyte growth.FIGURE 7Proper levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 are essential for oocyte maturation.

Dynamic changes in histone modifications precede de novo DNA methylation in oocytes.Genes Dev. 2015; 29: 2449-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, although the histone modifications in SALL4 null oocytes (low levels of H3K4me3 and high levels of H3K36me3 (Fig. 6E and supplemental Fig. S3A) are propitious for DNA methylation establishment, without SALL4, the de novo methylation still failed. Such contrary results have also been found in HDAC1/2 knock-out oocytes (22Ma P. de Waal E. Weaver J.R. Bartolomei M.S. Schultz R.M.

Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: E481-E489Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, de novo DNA methylation may also rely on specific factors apart from histone modifications. Furthermore, SALL4, HDAC1, and HDAC2 are all related to NuRD complex, which prompts us to put forward a hypothesis that NuRD complex may take parts in de novo DNA methylation during oogenesis. In the microinjection experiment, there were still 25% of oocytes that could undergo GVBD. One possible reason was that the follicles used for microinjection were obtained from P10.5 mice; however, SALL4 depletion occurred at P6.5 or earlier in Sall4fl/fl;Zp3-Cre mice. In addition, SALL4, as an important transcription factor, definitely can directly regulate other genes which play roles in oocyte maturation, even though the microinjection experiment still powerfully validated that the proper levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 were important for regulating transcriptome in oogenesis and were essential for oocytes maturation. Because of limited materials, previous studies mainly focused on how histone marks influenced the nuclear conformation, which are convenient to observe. However, how histone marks modulated transcriptome in oogenesis was less studied. In our study, we interpreted how H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modulated transcription of certain genes that were essential for oocytes maturation by oocytes microinjection, single-cell RNA-Seq assays and ultra low input ChIP-qPCR. In summary, we found that oocyte-specific Sall4 knock-out mice showed severe defects in oogenesis including impaired follicle development and meiosis resumption inhibition. We demonstrated that SALL4 null oocytes showed a severely abnormal transcriptome and aberrant epigenome including failure in DNA methylation establishment and histone modifications abnormalities. As for DNA methylation, SALL4 was indispensable for the nuclear localization of DNMT3A and thus essential for DNA methylation establishment in the process of oocytes maturation. As for histone modifications, SALL4 regulated the expression of Kdm5b, Kdm6a, and Kdm6b, which then modulated the levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3. In turn, the abnormal H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modifications led to mis-expression of many key genes essential for oocytes maturation (supplemental Fig. S3B). Overall, our present study elucidated a pivotal role of pluripotency factor, Sall4, in epigenetic maturation of mouse oocytes. Sall4fl/fl mice and Sall4-mCherry mice were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 system. All experiments were performed in accordance with the University of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Biological Research Ethics Committee of Tongji University. Primordial, primary, secondary, early antral, and antral follicles were obtained from Sall4fl/fl, Sall4fl/fl;Zp3-Cre female mice at P2.5, P6.5, P12.5, P17.5, and P22.5 as previously described (24Pedersen T. Peters H. Proposal for a classification of oocytes and follicles in the mouse ovary.J. Reprod. Fertil. 1968; 17: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Fully grown oocytes were isolated from 4–6-week-old mice 46 h after PMSG injection. Zygotes were obtained from the ampulla of the uterine tube of superovulated female mice after mating with male mice. Then two-cell, four-cell, eight-cell, morula, and blastocyst embryos were obtained by culturing zygotes in Quinn's Advantage medium (In Vitro Fertilization, Inc.). For SN/non-SN ratio calculation, we obtained oocytes from P21.5 Sall4fl/fl and Sall4fl/fl;Zp3-Cre female mice. Then we use Hoechst 33258 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to stain the nucleus DNA. Then we observed the nucleus of oocytes under fluorescence microscope and counted the oocytes in SN or non-SN conformation. Three independent experiments were performed for each WT and KO groups. For GVBD ratio calculation, we obtained oocytes from P21.5 S"

Deploying insulin granule-granule fusion to rescue deficient insulin secretion in diabetes.Diabetologia. 2012; 55: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The fundamental components of membrane fusion machinery are three SNARE proteins (syntaxin, SNAP-25 (synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa), and VAMP (vesicle-associated membrane protein)) and nSec/Munc18 (SM) protein, which act to remodel and activate the SNARE complex assembly (3Südhof T.C. Rothman J.E. Membrane fusion: grappling with SNARE and SM proteins.Science. 2009; 323: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). Each vesicle SNARE (v-SNARE) (VAMP) and target membrane SNARE (t-SNARE) (syntaxins, SNAP25) and SM protein constitute a family of isoforms (4Hong W. SNAREs and traffic.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 493-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) to enable combinatorial matching of cognate partners that underlie the molecular basis of distinct exocytotic events (4Hong W. SNAREs and traffic.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 493-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Interestingly, β-cells employ almost all of the major SM·SNARE complexes to mediate exocytosis of distinct insulin SG pools. The current thinking is that Munc18a·Syn-1A·VAMP2 complex mediates the pool of insulin SGs that dock onto plasma membrane (PM) for an indefinite period, called “predocked” SGs, until a strong Ca2+ stimulus evokes fusion (5Oh E.

The remaining SM·SNARE complex, Munc18c·Syn-4, was initially postulated to mediate biphasic GSIS by acting on predocked SGs in a manner redundant to Munc18a·Syn-1A (15Jewell J.L. Oh E. Thurmond D.C.

Furthermore, unlike β-cells, which employ redundant SM·SNARE complexes for exocytosis, Munc18c·Syn-4 in complex with VAMP2 and SNAP23 is the only SM·SNARE complex mediating glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissues, adipocyte, and muscle (15Jewell J.L.

The strongest evidence for the role of Syn-1A in insulin exocytosis has been provided by the study employing a global Syn-1A knock-out (KO) mouse (6Ohara-Imaizumi M. Fujiwara T. Nakamichi Y. Okamura T. Akimoto Y. Kawai J. Matsushima S. Kawakami H. Watanabe T. Akagawa K. Nagamatsu S. Imaging analysis reveals mechanistic differences between first- and second-phase insulin exocytosis.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), originally generated to examine neuronal plasticity, but it showed remarkably few neuronal phenotypic abnormalities (19Fujiwara T. Mishima T. Kofuji T. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Yamamoto A. Akagawa K. Analysis of knockout mice to determine the role of HPC-1/syntaxin 1A in expressing synaptic plasticity.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 5767-5776Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Instead, Syn-1A-KO mice showed profound defects in insulin exocytosis (6Ohara-Imaizumi M. Fujiwara T. Nakamichi Y. Okamura T. Akimoto Y. Kawai J. Matsushima S. Kawakami H. Watanabe T. Akagawa K. Nagamatsu S. Imaging analysis reveals mechanistic differences between first- and second-phase insulin exocytosis.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), specifically much fewer predocked SGs that were fusion-incompetent, and apparently without perturbation in newcomer SGs. This is of clinical relevance because levels of Syn-1A and cognate proteins are severely reduced in islets of T2D patients, postulated to contribute to insulin secretory deficiency (20Ostenson C.G. Gaisano H. Sheu L. Tibell A. Bartfai T. Impaired gene and protein expression of exocytotic soluble N-ethylmaleimide attachment protein receptor complex proteins in pancreatic islets of type 2 diabetic patients.Diabetes. 2006; 55: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, the global Syn-1A deletion can potentially affect neuronal and endocrine secretions that might influence β-cell function. In fact, recent reports by the original group that created the mouse demonstrated a perturbation in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis affecting corticosterone (21Fujiwara T. Kofuji T. Akagawa K. Dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in STX1A knockout mice.J. Neuroendocrinol. 2011; 23: 1222-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and catecholamine release (22Mishima T. Fujiwara T. Kofuji T. Akagawa K. Impairment of catecholamine systems during induction of long-term potentiation at hippocampal CA1 synapses in HPC-1/syntaxin 1A knock-out mice.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), two hormones that profoundly affect glucose homeostasis by their actions on insulin-sensitive tissues and secretion of islet hormones. Syn-1A is also present in α-cells to mediate glucagon secretion (23Andersson S.A. Pedersen M.G. Vikman J. Eliasson L. Glucose-dependent docking and SNARE protein-mediated exocytosis in mouse pancreatic alpha-cell.Pflugers Arch. 2011; 462: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which in turn might have paracrine influences on β-cells. It therefore behooves us to unequivocally reassess the role of Syn-1A in β-cell insulin exocytosis per se, employing a β-cell-specific KO mouse (Syn-1A-βKO). Our results confirmed that Syn-1A deletion in β-cells caused a reduction in number and fusion of predocked SGs, resulting in reduced first-phase GSIS. Unexpectedly, Syn-1A deletion reduced SG replenishment to releasable pools after stimulation and selective reduction in fusion of short-dock newcomer SGs; both underlie the reduced second-phase GSIS. This reduced biphasic GSIS in vivo resulted in hyperglycemia. Correct targeting was confirmed in 14 independent R1 ES cell clones by Southern blotting analysis (Fig. 1A), and two of these lines produced male chimeras for germ line transmission after aggregation. Mice that were heterozygous for floxed Syn-1A allele and heterozygous for RIP-Cre recombinase (Syn-1Aflox/+Cre+) were then crossed with heterozygous floxed Syn-1A mice (Syn-1Aflox/+Cre−) to generate litters that contained pups where the RIP-Cre had mediated excision of exons 2 and 3 of Syn-1A specifically in β-cells (Syn-1Aflox/floxCre+). The two control mice included mice that were homozygous for floxed Syn-1A allele but did not express Cre (Syn-1Aflox/floxCre−) and RIP-Cre mice (Syn-1A+/+Cre+) (Fig. 1A). There is concern that some rat insulin 2 promoter (RIP)-Cre strains, such as Tg(Ins2-Cre)Mgn, exhibit leaky expression of Cre in the mid-brain and ventral brain regions, including the hypothalamus (24Wicksteed B.

The pancreatic β-cell is a key site for mediating the effects of leptin on glucose homeostasis.Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 291-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We therefore chose another RIP-Cre strain, Tg(Ins2-Cre)Herr (27Herrera P.L. Adult insulin- and glucagon-producing cells differentiate from two independent cell lineages.Development. 2000; 127: 2317-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was reported to have a more restricted and punctate pattern of Cre expression in the brain, particularly in the hypothalamus, compared with the robust Cre leakage in other RIP-Cre strains, including the RIP-CreMgn and RIP-Cre/ERT. First, we confirmed this Tg(Ins2-Cre)Herr strain by sequencing of the specific 660-bp rat Ins2 promoter. Next, we confirmed that there was no or minimal brain leakage by performing total RNA analysis by quantitative PCR of the hypothalamus of our Syn-1A-βKO and RIP-Cre control mice using a sensitive quantitative RT-PCR protocol with high dynamic range. Hypothalamic expression levels of Cre were extremely low (supplemental Fig. S1A), with threshold (Ct) values (34.65 ± 1.13) below the cut-off Ct value of 30 for positive gene expression in both groups (supplemental Fig. S1B). Consistent with the extremely low Cre expression level, hypothalamic Syn-1A levels were equivalent in both mouse groups, indicating that no deletion of Syn-1A occurred in Syn-1A-βKO mouse hypothalamus. There was also no difference in expression in the Syn-1A cognate partners, including Munc18a, VAMP2, and SNAP25, or non-cognate SNARE proteins Syn-3 and VAMP8 (supplemental Fig. S1A). Islets were isolated from Syn-1A-βKO and control mice (12–14 weeks old) and subjected to Western blotting, which confirmed the reduction in Syn-1A levels without any effect on the levels of cognate Munc18a, VAMP2, and SNAP25 or non-cognate SNARE proteins (Fig. 1B). The residual Syn-1A in Syn-1A-βKO islets was due to Syn-1A present in non-β-cells shown on confocal microscopy. Here, in control mouse islets, Syn-1A localized to insulin-positive β-cells as well as glucagon-positive α-cells and somatostatin-positive δ-cells (Fig. 1C). In Syn-1A-βKO islets, Syn-1A was no longer present in insulin-positive β cells but still positive in glucagon-positive α-cells and somatostatin-positive δ-cells (Fig. 1D). To ensure that any defects on β-cell insulin secretion are attributable to Syn-1A effect per se, we assessed for possible changes in β-cell mass (supplemental Fig. S2A) by several parameters (β-cells per pancreatic area, islet number and size), which showed no differences between the three mouse groups. We also assessed serum glucagon levels (supplemental Fig. S2B), which were not different between the Syn-1A βKO mice and the two groups of control mice, consistent with the intact Syn-1A in the Syn-1A-βKO mouse α-cells (Fig. 1D). There is debate on whether RIP-Cre strains exhibit some glucose intolerance (28Lee J.Y. Ristow M. Lin X. White M.F. Magnuson M.A. Hennighausen L. RIP-Cre revisited, evidence for impairments of pancreatic β-cell function.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2649-2653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 29Fex M. Wierup N. Nitert M.D. Ristow M. Mulder H. Rat insulin promoter 2-Cre recombinase mice bred onto a pure C57BL/6J background exhibit unaltered glucose tolerance.J. Endocrinol. 2007; 194: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We therefore employed both Syn-1Aflox/flox and RIP-Cre mice as controls. An intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) showed that RIP-Cre mice exhibited mild (Fig. 2Ai) but not significant reduction in glucose tolerance compared with Syn-1Aflox/flox mice (AUC analysis in Fig. 2A, iii). In contrast, Syn-1A βKO mice exhibited higher glycemic levels than either Syn-1A flox or RIP-Cre control mice (Fig. 2A, i and iii (AUC determined above basal levels)). This was caused by much reduced plasma insulin levels in Syn-1A βKO mice (Fig. 2A, ii and iii (AUC determined above basal levels)), encompassing the first-phase peak and second-phase plateau responses, when compared with control Syn-1Aflox/flox and RIP-Cre mice (the two controls were not significantly different from each other (Fig. 2A, ii and iii)). Basal insulin levels were also lower in the Syn-1A-βKO mice compared with the control mice. The weights of Syn-1A-βKO mice (32.5 ± 3.1 g) were not different from those of control mice (RIP-Cre control, 31.5 ± 3.3 g; Syn-1A flox control, 31 ± 2.6 g) (Fig. 2B). We also examined the fed and fasting glucose and insulin levels (Fig. 2C). After an 18-h overnight fast, Syn-1A βKO mice had higher glucose (8.4 ± 1.1 mmol/liter; RIP-Cre control, 6.1 ± 1.12 mmol/liter; Syn-1A flox control, 5.4 ± 0.8, mmol/liter) and lower insulin levels (0.44 ± 0.08 ng/ml; RIP-Cre control, 0.68 ± 0.09 ng/ml; Syn-1A flox control, 0.72 ± 0.07 ng/ml). In the fed state, Syn-1A βKO mice exhibited a higher rise in glucose (11.2 ± 0.9 mmol/liter; RIP-Cre control, 9.02 ± 0.7 mmol/liter; Syn-1A flox control, 8.5 ± 1.1 mmol/liter) with a corresponding lower increase in insulin levels (0.69 ± 0.11 ng/ml; RIP-Cre control, 1.24 ± 0.14 ng/ml; Syn-1A flox control, 1.21 ± 0.18 ng/ml). The net increase of fed over fasting insulin levels was much higher in the control than Syn-1A βKO mice (Fig. 2C, ii). To examine the direct contribution of pancreatic islet insulin secretion to physiologic glucose stimulation, we performed islet perifusion assays (Fig. 3A). Syn-1A deletion in β-cells resulted in reduction of both first-phase (AUC determined above basal levels; Fig. 3B; Syn-1A-βKO, 1.98 ± 0.2 (ng/μg total insulin content) × min; Syn-1A flox control, 4.78 ± 0.59 (ng/μg total insulin content) × min; RIP-Cre control, 3.92 ± 0.26 (ng/μg total insulin content) × min) and second-phase (AUC determined above basal levels; Syn-1A-βKO, 1.74 ± 0.32 (ng/μg total insulin content) × min; Syn-1A flox control, 4.41 ± 0.42 (ng/μg total insulin content) × min; RIP-Cre control, 3.51 ± 0.4 (ng/μg total insulin content) × min) GSIS. The two control groups, Syn-1Aflox/flox and RIP-Cre, showed no difference from each other. Total islet insulin contents were similar between the three mouse groups (Fig. 3C), indicating that the reduced GSIS in Syn-1A-KO β-cells was not due to deficiency in insulin production. Reduction of first-phase GSIS can be predicted to be due to reduction of SG docking and/or fusion of predocked SGs with the PM. To examine SG docking at the PM, we performed EM morphometric analysis on Syn-1A-KO β-cells compared with control (Syn-1A flox and RIP-Cre) β-cells at basal and after a 15-min 16.7-mmol/liter glucose stimulation (Fig. 4A), the latter to assess SG recruitment to PM to replenish releasable pools after depletion caused by first-phase release. We first ruled out any effect of Syn-1A deletion on insulin SG biogenesis in that the diameters of SGs between the three groups were similar (Fig. 4B), and there was no difference in SG densities in basal conditions or after stimulation (Fig. 4C). Predictably, Syn-1A-KO β-cells showed a large reduction of ∼80% in the number of docked SGs in basal conditions (Fig. 4D; Syn-1A-βKO, 0.2 ± 0.06; Syn-1A flox control, 0.91 ± 0.21; RIP-Cre control, 1.05 ± 0.24), which would explain the reduced first-phase secretion, consistent with the results of the global Syn-1A-KO mouse (6Ohara-Imaizumi M. Fujiwara T. Nakamichi Y. Okamura T. Akimoto Y. Kawai J. Matsushima S. Kawakami H. Watanabe T. Akagawa K. Nagamatsu S. Imaging analysis reveals mechanistic differences between first- and second-phase insulin exocytosis.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). After 15-min glucose stimulation of control β-cells to secrete and deplete the releasable pools, there was sufficient recruitment of SGs to the PM to replace the exocytosed SGs and sustain second-phase GSIS. However, glucose stimulation of Syn-1A-KO β-cells caused an even greater reduction (than basal conditions) of >95% in morphologically docked SGs (Syn-1A-βKO, 0.06 ± 0.02; Syn-1A flox control, 1.23 ± 0.29; RIP-Cre control, 1.35 ± 0.33) (Fig. 4, A and D). Of note, glucose stimulation also caused a larger clearing of SGs further into the cell interior in Syn-1A-βKO β-cells (see image 3 in Fig. 4A) compared with basal conditions. This was assessed by detailed analysis in Fig. 4E showing that Syn-1A-βKO β-cells had a mild reduction in the number of SGs within 0–0.2 μm from the PM under basal conditions, which became very severe after glucose stimulation. In fact, this severe reduction in SGs also occurred within the deeper 0.2–0.4-μm concentric shell. Further into the cytoplasm from 0.4 to 1 μm, there was a larger accumulation of SGs in Syn-1A-βKO β-cells compared with control β-cells. These results indicate that Syn-1A depletion reduced the mobilization of SGs from the cell interior to the PM required to replenish the releasable pools (see Fig. 5) that sustain second-phase GSIS (Fig. 3). This action of Syn-1A on recruitment of SGs to the PM is novel.FIGURE 5Syn-1A deletion in mouse β-cells reduces the priming and mobilization of insulin SG pools.

Insulin SG exocytosis was elicited by a protocol consisting of a train of 10 500-ms depolarization pulses. Cell Cm changes elicited by the first two pulses have been previously postulated to approximate the size of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of primed and fusion-ready SGs (30Rorsman P. Renström E. Insulin granule dynamics in pancreatic β-cells.Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 1029-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Subsequent pulses estimate the rate of SG refilling or mobilization from reserve pool(s) to the RRP, where SGs are subsequently primed for fusion competence (30Rorsman P. Renström E. Insulin granule dynamics in pancreatic β-cells.Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 1029-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The size of the RRP and rate of SG mobilization are believed to correlate with first- and second-phase GSIS from pancreatic islets (30Rorsman P. Renström E. Insulin granule dynamics in pancreatic β-cells.Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 1029-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Fig. 5, A and B, shows representative recordings of Cm from Syn-1A flox control and Syn-1A-βKO mouse β-cells. When compared with control β-cells, Cm increases in Syn-1A-βKO β-cells were reduced at every depolarizing pulse (Fig. 5C). Fig. 5D shows that the size of RRP of SGs (ΔCm1st-2nd pulse) was reduced by 59% (Syn-1A-βKO, 1.3 ± 0.2 fF/pF; Syn-1A flox control, 3.2 ± 0.6 fF/pF). As would be predicted from the EM data (Fig. 4), the rate of SG refilling/mobilization (ΔCm3rd-10th pulse) was also reduced by 45% (Syn-1A-βKO, 3.9 ± 0.7 fF/pF; Syn-1A flox control, 7 ± 1.2 fF/pF).

https://openalex.org/W2566117230,"PRMT5 is the primary enzyme responsible for the deposition of the symmetric dimethylarginine in mammalian cells. In an effort to understand how PRMT5 is regulated, we identified a threonine phosphorylation site within a C-terminal tail motif, which is targeted by the Akt/serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinases. While investigating the function of this posttranslational modification, we serendipitously discovered that its free C-terminal tail binds PDZ domains (when unphosphorylated) and 14-3-3 proteins (when phosphorylated). In essence, a phosphorylation event within the last few residues of the C-terminal tail generates a posttranslational modification-dependent PDZ/14-3-3 interaction ""switch."" The C-terminal motif of PRMT5 is required for plasma membrane association, and loss of this switching capacity is not compatible with life. This signaling phenomenon was recently reported for the HPV E6 oncoprotein but has not yet been observed for mammalian proteins. To investigate the prevalence of PDZ/14-3-3 switching in signal transduction, we built a protein domain microarray that harbors PDZ domains and 14-3-3 proteins. We have used this microarray to interrogate the C-terminal tails of a small group of candidate proteins and identified ERBB4, PGHS2, and IRK1 (as well as E6 and PRMT5) as conforming to this signaling mode, suggesting that PDZ/14-3-3 switching may be a broad biological paradigm."

Transcriptome analyses of treated livers indicated multiple changes consistent with reversal of liver dysfunction that typifies NP-C disease. Significant improvements in liver pathology and function were achieved by this treatment regimen; however, NPC1 protein maturation and levels, disease progression, weight loss, and animal morbidity were not detectably altered. Vorinostat concentrations were >200 μm in the plasma compartment of treated animals but were almost 100-fold lower in brain tissue. Apolipoprotein B metabolism and the expression of key components of lipid homeostasis in primary hepatocytes from null (Npc1−/−) and missense (Npc1nmf164) mutant mice were altered by vorinostat treatment, consistent with a response by these cells independent of the status of the Npc1 locus.

https://openalex.org/W2564408837,"Chronic inflammation is known to be a key causative factor in tumor progression, but we do not yet fully understand the molecular mechanism through which inflammation leads to cancer. Here, we report that the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mouse model of chronic colitis is associated with increases in the serum level of IL-1β and the colonic epithelial expression of the cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan, syndecan-2. We further show that IL-1β stimulated the transcription of syndecan-2 via NF-κB–dependent FOXO3a activation in CCD841CoN normal colonic epithelial cells and early-stage HT29 colon cancer cells. Inflammatory hypoxia was observed in the colonic epithelia of mice with chronic colitis, suggesting that hypoxic stress is involved in the regulation of syndecan-2 expression. Consistently, experimental inflammatory hypoxia induced hypoxia inducible factor-1α–dependent FOXO3a expression and the p38 MAPK-mediated nuclear localization of FOXO3a. FOXO3a directly mediated syndecan-2 expression in both cell lines and the colonic epithelia of mice with DSS-induced colitis. Moreover, syndecan-2 expression was detected in azoxymethane/DSS-induced colon tumors. Together, these data demonstrate that inflammatory hypoxia up-regulates syndecan-2 via the IL-1β–NF-κB–FOXO3a pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2565668513,"Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome (HGPS, OMIM 176670, a rare premature aging disorder that leads to death at an average age of 14.7 years due to myocardial infarction or stroke, is caused by mutations in the LMNA gene. Lamins help maintain the shape and stability of the nuclear envelope in addition to regulating DNA replication, DNA transcription, proliferation and differentiation. The LMNA mutation results in the deletion of 50 amino acids from the carboxy-terminal region of prelamin A, producing the truncated, farnesylated protein progerin. The accumulation of progerin in HGPS nuclei causes numerous morphological and functional changes that lead to premature cellular senescence. Attempts to reverse this HGPS phenotype have identified rapamycin, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), as a drug that is able to rescue the HGPS cellular phenotype by promoting autophagy and reducing progerin accumulation. Rapamycin is an obvious candidate for the treatment of HGPS disease but is difficult to utilize clinically. To further assess rapamycin's efficacy with regard to proteostasis, mitochondrial function and the degree of DNA damage, we tested temsirolimus, a rapamycin analog with a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile than rapamycin. We report that temsirolimus decreases progerin levels, increases proliferation, reduces misshapen nuclei, and partially ameliorates DNA damage, but does not improve proteasome activity or mitochondrial dysfunction. Our findings suggest that future therapeutic strategies should identify new drug combinations and treatment regimens that target all the dysfunctional hallmarks that characterize HGPS cells."
https://openalex.org/W2561706117,"Tumor cells rely on aerobic glycolysis to generate ATP, namely the Warburg effect. 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) is well characterized as a glycolytic inhibitor, but its effect on cellular signaling pathways has not been fully elucidated. Herein, we sought to investigate the effect of 2-DG on ERK function in lung cancer cells. We found that 2-DG inhibits ERK phosphorylation in a time and dose-dependent manner in lung cancer cells. This inhibition requires functional LKB1. LKB1 knockdown in LKB1 wildtype cells correlated with an increase in the basal level of p-ERK. Restoration of LKB1 in LKB1-null cells significantly inhibits ERK activation. Blocking AMPK function with AMPK inhibitor, AMPK siRNA or DN-AMPK diminishes the inhibitory effect of 2-DG on ERK, suggesting that 2-DG-induced ERK inhibition is mediated by LKB1/AMPK signaling. Moreover, IGF1-induced ERK phosphorylation is significantly decreased by 2-DG. Conversely, a subset of oncogenic mutants of K-Ras, the main upstream regulator of ERK, blocks 2-DG-induced LKB1/AMPK signaling. These findings reveal the potential cross-talk between LKB1/AMPK and ERK signaling and help to better understand the mechanism of action of 2-DG."
https://openalex.org/W2567446650,"In recent years, various large-scale proteomic studies have demonstrated that mitochondrial proteins are highly acylated, most commonly by addition of acetyl and succinyl groups. These acyl modifications may be enzyme catalysed but can also be driven non-enzymatically. The latter mechanism is promoted in mitochondria due to the nature of the mitochondrial microenvironment, which is alkaline and contains high concentrations of acyl-CoA species. Protein acylation may modify enzyme activity, typically inhibiting it. We posited that organismal ageing might be accompanied by an accumulation of acylated proteins, especially in mitochondria, and that this might compromise mitochondrial function and contribute to ageing. In this study, we used R. norvegicus, C. elegans and D. melanogaster to compare the acylation status of mitochondrial proteins between young and old animals. We observed a specific age-dependent increase in protein succinylation in worms and flies but not in rat. Rats have two substrate-specific mitochondrial deacylases, SIRT3 and SIRT5 while both flies and worms lack these enzymes. We propose that accumulation of mitochondrial protein acylation contributes to age-dependent mitochondrial functional decline and that SIRT3 and SIRT5 enzymes may promote longevity through regulation of mitochondrial protein acylation during ageing."

Previous reports suggest that glycans, the most common posttranslational modifications, are involved in obesity-related diseases, but what type of glycan regulates adipogenesis during obesity remains unclear.

We found that a gene encoding β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase-1 (St6gal1), a key enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of α2,6-linked sialic acid in N-linked glycans, was most down-regulated in VATs from obese mice.

AA was applied using indwelling fixed needles bilaterally at points MA-IC1, MA-TF1, MA-SC, MA-AT1 and MA-TG one day prior to each exam. Placebo needles were used as control. Levels of anxiety were measured using a visual analogue scale before and after each intervention as well as before each exam. Additional measures included the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory, duration of sleep at night, blood pressure, heart rate and the extent of participant blinding. All included participants finished the study. Anxiety levels were reduced after AA and placebo intervention compared to baseline and the no intervention condition (p < 0.003). AA was better at reducing anxiety than placebo in the evening before the exam (p = 0.018). Participants were able to distinguish between AA and placebo intervention. Both AA and placebo interventions reduced exam anxiety in medical students. The superiority of AA over placebo may be due to insufficient blinding of participants."

The most prevalent serotypes among the clinical (n = 28) and normal flora (n = 32) isolates were serotypes 14 (46%) and 3 (31%), respectively. The most prevalent vaccine serotypes amongst the clinical isolates and the healthy individuals were pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) 13 and PCV10, respectively. PFGE revealed 34 pulsotypes with 9 common and 25 single types. Significant number of the normal isolates belonged to CT5 and CT6. On the other hand, significant number of clinical isolates belonged to CT8 as compared to the normal flora isolates. MLST showed 2 dominant sequence types.

There was no significant difference in other sequence types between clinical and normal flora isolates. Three polyclonal complexes including Sweden15A -25, Spain23F-1 and Spain9V-3 constituted 58% of the isolates. Our results suggest that the genetic diversity and transposon distribution were high among S. pneumoniae, particularly in the isolates containing erm(B) and double antibiotic resistant genes (erm/mef).

https://openalex.org/W2566159325,"Capreomycin is a potent ribosome-targeting antibiotic that is an essential component of current antituberculosis treatments, particularly in the case of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Optimal capreomycin binding and Mtb ribosome inhibition requires ribosomal RNA methylation in both ribosome subunits by TlyA (Rv1694), an enzyme with dual 2′-O-methytransferase and putative hemolytic activities. Despite the important role of TlyA in capreomycin sensitivity and identification of inactivating mutations in the corresponding Mtb gene tlyA, which cause resistance to capreomycin, our current structural and mechanistic understanding of TlyA action remains limited. Here, we present structural and functional analyses of Mtb TlyA interaction with its obligatory co-substrate for methyltransferase activity, S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM). Despite adopting a complete class I methyltransferase fold containing conserved SAM-binding and catalytic motifs, the isolated TlyA carboxyl-terminal domain exhibits no detectable affinity for SAM. Further analyses identify a tetrapeptide motif (RXWV) in the TlyA interdomain linker as indispensable for co-substrate binding. Our results also suggest that structural plasticity of the RXWV motif could contribute to TlyA domain interactions, as well as specific recognition of its two structurally distinct ribosomal RNA targets. Our findings thus reveal a novel motif requirement for SAM binding by TlyA and set the stage for future mechanistic studies of TlyA substrate recognition and modification that underpin Mtb sensitivity to capreomycin."
https://openalex.org/W2568895696,"Interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) could accurately diagnose Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tuberculosis) infection. However, these assays do not discriminate between latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and active tuberculosis disease (ATB). Here, a total of 177 subjects, including 65 patients with ATB, 43 subjects with LTBI, and 69 TB-uninfected controls (CON group) were enrolled. The concentration of IFN-γ, IP-10, and IL-2 was determined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after short-term (24h) or long-term (72h) stimulation with TB antigens including ESAT-6/CFP-10 (EC) and purified protein derivative (PPD).EC-stimulated IL-2 and gamma interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) release (24h and 72h) showed a good diagnostic performance in distinguishing between TB-infected and TB-uninfected individuals, but failed to discriminate between ATB and LTBI. After 72h of incubation, the release of IL-2 was higher in LTBI patients after stimulation with EC and PPD. The PPD-stimulated IL-2/IFN-γ ratio after 72h incubation had the diagnostic potential to discriminate between ATB and LTBI, with a sensitivity of 90.8% and a specificity of 97.7%. In addition, these new biomarkers, combined with T-SPOT test in a two-step strategy, were validated with high levels of accuracy in a prospective clinical-based cohort. Collectively, the PPD-stimulated IL-2/IFN-γ ratio after long-term incubation may be an alternative diagnostic biomarker in distinguishing between active TB patients and subjects with latent infection."
https://openalex.org/W2567621550,"Background Antiangiogenic treatment of glioblastomas with Bevacizumab lacks predictive markers. Myoinositol (MI) is an organic osmolyte, with intracellular concentration changes depending on the extracellular osmolality. Since Bevacizumab markedly reduces tumor edema and influences the tumor microenvironment, we investigated whether the MI concentration in the tumor changes during therapy. Methods We used 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure the MI concentrations in the tumor and contralateral control tissue of 39 prospectively recruited patients with recurrent glioblastomas before and 8–12 weeks after starting therapy. 30 patients received Bevacizumab and 9 patients were treated with CCNU/VM26 as control. We performed a survival analysis to evaluate MI as a predictive biomarker for Bevacizumab therapy. Results MI concentrations increased significantly during Bevacizumab therapy in tumor (p < .001) and control tissue (p = .001), but not during CCNU/VM26 treatment. For the Bevacizumab cohort, higher MI concentrations in the control tissue at baseline (p = .021) and higher differences between control and tumor tissue (delta MI, p = .011) were associated with longer survival. A Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a median OS of 164 days for patients with a deltaMI < 1,817 mmol/l and 275 days for patients with a deltaMI > 1,817 mmol/l. No differences were observed for the relative changes or the post treatment concentrations. Additionally calculated creatine concentrations showed no differences in between subgroups or between pre and post treatment measurements. Conclusion Our data suggest that recurrent glioblastoma shows a strong metabolic reaction to Bevacizumab. Further, our results support the hypothesis that MI might be a marker for early tumor cell invasion. Pre-therapeutic MI concentrations are predictive of overall survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with Bevacizumab."
https://openalex.org/W2561801790,"The most effective vaccine candidate of malaria is based on the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP), a major surface protein implicated in the structural strength, motility, and immune evasion properties of the infective sporozoites. It is suspected that reversible conformational changes of CSP are required for infection of the mammalian host, but the detailed structure and dynamic properties of CSP remain incompletely understood, limiting our understanding of its function in the infection. Here, we report the structural and mechanical properties of the CSP studied using single-molecule force spectroscopy on several constructs, one including the central region of CSP, which is rich in NANP amino acid repeats (CSPrep), and a second consisting of a near full-length sequence without the signal and anchor hydrophobic domains (CSPΔHP). Our results show that the CSPrep is heterogeneous, with 40% of molecules requiring virtually no mechanical force to unfold (<10 piconewtons (pN)), suggesting that these molecules are mechanically compliant and perhaps act as entropic springs, whereas the remaining 60% are partially structured with low mechanical resistance (∼70 pN). CSPΔHP having multiple force peaks suggests specifically folded domains, with two major populations possibly indicating the open and collapsed forms. Our findings suggest that the overall low mechanical resistance of the repeat region, exposed on the outer surface of the sporozoites, combined with the flexible full-length conformations of CSP, may provide the sporozoites not only with immune evasion properties, but also with lubricating capacity required during its navigation through the mosquito and vertebrate host tissues. We anticipate that these findings would further assist in the design and development of future malarial vaccines.

https://openalex.org/W2561815219,"We present the results of a gamified mobile device arithmetic application which allowed us to collect vast amount of data in simple arithmetic operations. Our results confirm and replicate, on a large sample, six of the main principles derived in a long tradition of investigation: size effect, tie effect, size-tie interaction effect, five-effect, RTs and error rates correlation effect, and most common error effect. Our dataset allowed us to perform a robust analysis of order effects for each individual problem, for which there is controversy both in experimental findings and in the predictions of theoretical models. For addition problems, the order effect was dominated by a max-then-min structure (i.e 7+4 is easier than 4+7). This result is predicted by models in which additions are performed as a translation starting from the first addend, with a distance given by the second addend. In multiplication, we observed a dominance of two effects: (1) a max-then-min pattern that can be accounted by the fact that it is easier to perform fewer additions of the largest number (i.e. 8x3 is easier to compute as 8+8+8 than as 3+3+…+3) and (2) a phonological effect by which problems for which there is a rhyme (i.e. ""seis por cuatro es veinticuatro"") are performed faster. Above and beyond these results, our study bares an important practical conclusion, as proof of concept, that participants can be motivated to perform substantial arithmetic training simply by presenting it in a gamified format."
https://openalex.org/W2569684919,"Sequential addition of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is often needed for patients coinfected with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) who develop HBV resistance to lamivudine after combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) containing only lamivudine for HBV. We aimed to assess the virological response of HBV to add-on TDF in patients coinfected with lamivudine-resistant HBV.Between November 2010 and December 2014, 33 HIV/HBV-coinfected patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV and 56 with lamivudine-susceptible HBV were prospectively included. TDF plus lamivudine was used to substitute zidovudine or abacavir plus lamivudine contained in cART in patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV infection, while patients with lamivudine-susceptible HBV infection received TDF plus lamivudine as backbone of cART. Serial determinations of plasma HBV DNA load, HBV serologic markers, and liver and renal functions were performed after initiation of TDF-containing cART.Of 89 patients included, 38.6% tested positive for HBV envelope antigen (HBeAg) at baseline. The plasma HBV DNA level at enrollment of lamivudine-resistant and lamivudine-susceptible group were 6.1 ± 2.2 log10 and 6.0 ± 2.2 log10 copies/mL, respectively (p = 0.895). The cumulative percentage of HBV viral suppression in lamivudine-resistant and lamivudine-susceptible group was 81.8% and 91.1% at 48 weeks, respectively (p = 0.317), which increased to 86.7% and 96.2% at 96 weeks, respectively (p = 0.185). At 48 weeks, 11 patients testing HBeAg-positive at baseline failed to achieve viral suppression. In multivariate analysis, the only factor associated with failure to achieve viral suppression at 48 weeks was higher HBV DNA load at baseline (odds ratio, per 1-log10 copies/mL increase, 1.861; 95% CI, 1.204-2.878). At 48 weeks, HBeAg seroconversion was observed in 5 patients (1 in the lamivudine-resistant group and 4 in the lamivudine-susceptible group; p = 0.166). During the study period, HBsAg levels decreased over time, regardless of lamivudine resistance. Loss of HBsAg was observed in 3 (3.4%) patients in the lamivudine-susceptible group.Add-on TDF-containing cART in patients coinfected with lamivudine-resistant HBV achieved a similar rate of HBV viral suppression compared to TDF-containing cART as initial regimen in patients coinfected with lamivudine-susceptible HBV. A higher baseline HBV DNA load and HBeAg positivity were associated with failure to achieve HBV viral suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2561037064,"The HIV-1 Nef accessory factor enhances viral infectivity, immune evasion, and AIDS progression. Nef triggers rapid down-regulation of CD4 via the endocytic adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) complex, a process linked to enhanced viral infectivity and immune escape. Here, we describe a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay to visualize the interaction of Nef with AP-2 and CD4 in living cells. Interacting protein pairs were fused to complementary non-fluorescent fragments of YFP and co-expressed in 293T cells. Nef interactions with both CD4 and AP-2 resulted in complementation of YFP and a bright fluorescent signal by confocal microcopy that localized to the cell periphery. Co-expression of the AP-2 α subunit enhanced the Nef·AP-2 σ2 subunit BiFC signal and vice versa, suggesting that the AP-2 α-σ2 hemicomplex interacts cooperatively with Nef. Mutagenesis of Nef amino acids Arg-134, Glu-174, and Asp-175, which stabilize Nef for AP-2 α-σ2 binding in a recent co-crystal structure, substantially reduced AP-2 interaction without affecting CD4 binding. A dimerization-defective mutant of Nef failed to interact with either CD4 or AP-2 in the BiFC assay, indicating that Nef quaternary structure is required for CD4 and AP-2 recruitment as well as CD4 down-regulation. A small molecule previously shown to bind the Nef dimerization interface also reduced Nef interactions with AP-2 and CD4 and restored CD4 expression to the surface of HIV-infected cells. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for previous observations that dimerization-defective Nef mutants fail to down-regulate CD4 and validate the Nef dimerization interface as a target site for antiretroviral drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2563863114,"In the past five years, several scientific articles have claimed that the increase some countries have registered in suicide rates since 2008 is somehow related to the economic crisis. Other research has suggested that the impact of specific economic problems on the probability of suicidal behavior is often mediated by other individual-level factors, mainly psychological and physical, whose negative influence is exacerbated by reductions in the availability of health and social care during an economic crisis. On the basis of almost 1,000 cases of suicide collected by the Institute of Forensic Medicine in the province of Milan, this article aims at testing whether suicidal probability during an economic crisis is influenced by the interaction between an individual's employment status and the presence of psychological or physical disease. Using a binary logistic regression model, this article demonstrates that the likelihood of suicide during an economic crisis is three times higher for persons affected by a severe disease, either physical or psychological, than for people who are not affected (OR = 3.156; 95% CI = 1.066-9.339; p = 0.38). Neither employment status nor the interaction between employment status and health status contributed to the difference between the suicide rate before and during the economic crisis."
https://openalex.org/W2564752067,"We have quantified the photomovement behavior of a suspension of Euglena gracilis representing a behavioral response to a light gradient. Despite recent measurements of phototaxis and photophobicity, the details of macroscopic behavior of cell photomovements under conditions of light intensity gradients, which are critical to understand recent experiments on spatially localized bioconvection patterns, have not been fully understood. In this paper, the flux of cell number density under a light intensity gradient was measured by the following two experiments. In the first experiment, a capillary containing the cell suspension was illuminated with different light intensities in two regions. In the steady state, the differences of the cell numbers in the two regions normalized by the total number were proportional to the light difference, where the light intensity difference ranged from 0.5-2.0 μmol m-2 s-1. The proportional coefficient was positive (i.e., the bright region contained many microorganisms) when the mean light intensity was weak (1.25 μmol m-2 s-1), whereas it was negative when the mean intensity was strong (13.75 μmol m-2 s-1). In the second experiment, a shallow rectangular container of the suspension was illuminated with stepwise light intensities. The cell number density distribution exhibited a single peak at the position where the light intensity was about Ic ≃ 3.8 μmol m-2 s-1. These results suggest that the suspension of E. gracilis responded to the light gradient and that the favorable light intensity was Ic."
https://openalex.org/W2567794245,"Management of the Mediterranean demersal stocks has proven challenging mainly due to the multi-species character of the fisheries. In the present work, we focus on the multi-species demersal fisheries of the Aegean Sea (eastern Mediterranean) aiming to study the effects of different management measures on the main commercial stocks, as well as to explore the economic viability of the fisheries depending upon these resources, by means of simulated projections. Utilizing the limited available data, our results demonstrated that, under the current exploitation pattern, the economic viability of the fleets is threatened, particularly if fuel prices increase. Additionally, the biological targets set for the most exploited species, such as hake, will not be met under the current management regime. The projections also showed that the only management scenario under which both resource sustainability and economic viability of the fisheries are ensured is the decrease of fleet capacity in terms of vessel numbers. In this case, however, measures to support the fisheries-dependent communities need to be implemented to prevent the collapse of local economies due to employment decrease. Scenarios assuming selectivity improvements would be also beneficial for the stocks but they showed low economic performance and their application would threaten the viability of the fleets, particularly that of the trawlers."
https://openalex.org/W2569292511,"Tropical montane ecosystems are biodiversity hotspots harbouring many endemics that are confined to specific habitat types within narrow altitudinal ranges. While deforestation put these ecosystems under threat, we still lack knowledge about how heterogeneous environments like the montane tropics promote population connectivity and persistence. We investigated the fine-scale genetic structure of the two largest subpopulations of the endangered El Oro parakeet (Pyrrhura orcesi) endemic to the Ecuadorian Andes. Specifically, we assessed the genetic divergence between three sites separated by small geographic distances but characterized by a heterogeneous habitat structure. Although geographical distances between sites are small (3–17 km), we found genetic differentiation between all sites. Even though dispersal capacity is generally high in parrots, our findings indicate that dispersal is limited even on this small geographic scale. Individual genotype assignment revealed similar genetic divergence across a valley (~ 3 km distance) compared to a continuous mountain range (~ 13 km distance). Our findings suggest that geographic barriers promote genetic divergence even on small spatial scales in this endangered endemic species. These results may have important implications for many other threatened and endemic species, particularly given the upslope shift of species predicted from climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2564647338,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and disabling, anxiety disorder resulting from exposure to life threatening events such as a serious accident, abuse or combat (DSM IV definition). Among veterans with PTSD, a common complaint is dizziness, disorientation and/or postural imbalance in environments such as grocery stores and shopping malls. The etiology of these symptoms in PTSD is poorly understood and some attribute them to anxiety or traumatic brain injury. There is a possibility that an impaired vestibular system may contribute to these symptoms since, symptoms of an impaired vestibular system include dizziness, disorientation and postural imbalance. To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the nature of vestibular related symptoms in veterans with and without PTSD. We measured PTSD symptoms using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-C) and compared it to responses on vestibular function scales including the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), the Vertigo Symptom Scale Short Form (VSS-SF), the Chambless Mobility Inventory (CMI), and the Neurobehavioral Scale Inventory (NSI) in order to identify vestibular-related symptoms. Our findings indicate that veterans with worse PTSD symptoms report increased vestibular related symptoms. Additionally veterans with PTSD reported 3 times more dizziness related handicap than veterans without PTSD. Veterans with increased avoidance reported more vertigo and dizziness related handicap than those with PTSD and reduced avoidance. We describe possible contributing factors to increased reports of vestibular symptoms in PTSD, namely, anxiety, a vestibular component as well as an interactive effect of anxiety and vestibular impairment. We also present some preliminary analyses regarding the contribution of TBI. This data suggests possible evidence for vestibular symptom reporting in veterans with PTSD, which may be explained by possible underlying vestibular impairment, worthy of further exploration."
https://openalex.org/W2570004897,"Animals utilize behavioral signals across a range of different contexts in order to communicate with others and produce probable behavioral outcomes. During play animals frequently adopt action patterns used in other contexts. Researchers have therefore hypothesized that play signals have evolved to clarify communicative intent. One highly stereotyped play signal is the canid play bow, but its function remains contested. In order to clarify how canid puppies use play bows, we used data on play bows in immature wolves (ages 2.7–7.8 months) and dogs (ages 2 to 5 months) to test hypotheses evaluated in a previous study of adult dogs. We found that young dogs used play bows similarly to adult dogs; play bows most often occurred after a brief pause in play followed by complementary highly active play states. However, while the relative number of play bows and total observation time was similar between dog and wolf puppies, wolves did not follow this behavioral pattern, as play bows were unsuccessful in eliciting further play activity by the partner. While some similarities for the function of play bows in dog and wolf puppies were documented, it appears that play bows may function differently in wolf puppies in regards to re-initiating play."

An increased renin-angiotensin system activity has been reported to play an important role in the pathological processes in these conditions. We compared the effect of aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor (DRI), with that of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) on albuminuria and urinary excretion of angiotensinogen, a marker of intrarenal renin-angiotensin system activity.We randomly assigned 237 type 2 diabetic patients with high-normal albuminuria (10 to <30 mg/g of albumin-to-creatinine ratio) or microalbuminuria (30 to <300 mg/g) to the DRI group or ARB group (any ARB) with a target blood pressure of <130/80 mmHg. The primary endpoint was a reduction in albuminuria.Twelve patients dropped out during the observation period, and a total of 225 patients were analyzed. During the study period, the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were not different between the groups. The changes in the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio from baseline to the end of the treatment period in the DRI and ARB groups were similar (-5.5% and -6.7%, respectively). In contrast, a significant reduction in the urinary excretion of angiotensinogen was observed in the ARB group but not in the DRI group. In the subgroup analysis, a significant reduction in the albuminuria was observed in the ARB group but not in the DRI group among high-normal albuminuria patients.DRI and ARB reduced albuminuria in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition, ARB, but not DRI, reduced albuminuria even in patients with normal albuminuria. DRI is not superior to ARB in the reduction of urinary excretion of albumin and angiotensinogen."
https://openalex.org/W2569489861,"We investigate how high seas closure will affect the availability of commonly consumed food fish in 46 fish reliant, and/or low income countries. Domestic consumption of straddling fish species (fish that would be affected by high seas closure) occurred in 54% of the assessed countries. The majority (70%) of countries were projected to experience net catch gains following high seas closure. However, countries with projected catch gains and that also consumed the straddling fish species domestically made up only 37% of the assessed countries. In contrast, much fewer countries (25%) were projected to incur net losses from high seas closure, and of these, straddling species were used domestically in less than half (45%) of the countries. Our findings suggest that, given the current consumption patterns of straddling species, high seas closure may only directly benefit the supply of domestically consumed food fish in a small number of fish reliant and/or low income countries. In particular, it may not have a substantial impact on improving domestic fish supply in countries with the greatest need for improved access to affordable fish, as only one third of this group used straddling fish species domestically. Also, food security in countries with projected net catch gains but where straddling fish species are not consumed domestically may still benefit indirectly via economic activities arising from the increased availability of non-domestically consumed straddling fish species following high seas closure. Consequently, this study suggests that high seas closure can potentially improve marine resource sustainability as well as contribute to human well-being in some of the poorest and most fish dependent countries worldwide. However, caution is required because high seas closure may also negatively affect fish availability in countries that are already impoverished and fish insecure."
https://openalex.org/W2570638336,"Natural resource users face a trade-off between present and future consumption. Using harmful methods or extracting unsustainably, lowers future consumption. Therefore, it is reasonable to posit that people with higher time preferences extract more as compared to people with lower time preferences. The present study combines experimental methods and questionnaire data in order to understand the relationship between individual time preferences and fishers’ extraction behavior. We elicit individual time preferences using an incentivized experiment, linking the resulting time preference measures to extraction data from a questionnaire, as well as data collected from a framed Common Pool Resource (CPR) experiment. Both the experiments and questionnaire were conducted with artisanal fishers in Zanzibar. Our findings suggest that the relationship between time preferences and CPR extraction is not as straightforward as predicted by classical economic theory. In contrast to earlier studies, we find that fishers’ time preferences are negatively correlated to their extraction rates. Our surprising findings can partly be explained by the fact that higher time preferences are associated with lower investment in extraction capability (the disinvestment effect of time preferences), and by fishers´ cognitive abilities."
https://openalex.org/W2565431180,"Background Ranong Province in southern Thailand is one of the primary entry points for migrants entering Thailand from Myanmar, and borders Kawthaung Township in Myanmar where artemisinin resistance in malaria parasites has been detected. Areas of high population movement could increase the risk of spread of artemisinin resistance in this region and beyond. Methods A respondent-driven sampling (RDS) methodology was used to compare migrant populations coming from Myanmar in urban (Site 1) vs. rural (Site 2) settings in Ranong, Thailand. The RDS methodology collected information on knowledge, attitudes, and practices for malaria, travel and occupational histories, as well as social network size and structure. Individuals enrolled were screened for malaria by microscopy, Real Time-PCR, and serology. Results A total of 619 participants were recruited in Ranong City and 623 participants in Kraburi, a rural sub-district. By PCR, a total of 14 (1.1%) samples were positive (2 P. falciparum in Site 1; 10 P. vivax, 1 Pf, and 1 P. malariae in Site 2). PCR analysis demonstrated an overall weighted prevalence of 0.5% (95% CI, 0–1.3%) in the urban site and 1.0% (95% CI, 0.5–1.7%) in the rural site for all parasite species. PCR positivity did not correlate with serological positivity; however, as expected there was a strong association between antibody prevalence and both age and exposure. Access to long-lasting insecticidal treated nets remains low despite relatively high reported traditional net use among these populations. Conclusions The low malaria prevalence, relatively smaller networks among migrants in rural settings, and limited frequency of travel to and from other areas of malaria transmission in Myanmar, suggest that the risk for the spread of artemisinin resistance from this area may be limited in these networks currently but may have implications for regional malaria elimination efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2567654561,"This study, a tribute to Aristotle's 2400 years, used a juxtaposition of valid Aristotelian arguments to the paradoxes formulated by Zeno the Eleatic, in order to investigate the electrophysiological correlates of attentional and /or memory processing effects in the course of deductive reasoning. Participants undertook reasoning tasks based on visually presented arguments which were either (a) valid (Aristotelian) statements or (b) paradoxes. We compared brain activation patterns while participants maintained the premises / conclusions of either the valid statements or the paradoxes in working memory (WM). Event-related brain potentials (ERPs), specifically the P300 component of ERPs, were recorded during the WM phase, during which participants were required to draw a logical conclusion regarding the correctness of the valid syllogisms or the paradoxes. During the processing of paradoxes, results demonstrated a more positive event-related potential deflection (P300) across frontal regions, whereas processing of valid statements was associated with noticeable P300 amplitudes across parieto-occipital regions. These findings suggest that paradoxes mobilize frontal attention mechanisms, while valid deduction promotes parieto-occipital activity associated with attention and/or subsequent memory processing."

Previous studies of human muscle architecture have focused on a single joint, two adjacent joints, or an entire limb. To date, no study has presented muscle architecture for the upper and lower limbs of a single cadaver. Additionally, muscle architectural parameters from elderly cadavers are lacking, making it difficult to accurately model elderly populations. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to present muscle architecture of the upper and lower limbs of a 104 year old female cadaver. The major muscles of the upper and lower limbs were removed and the musculotendon mass, tendon mass, musculotendon length, tendon length, pennation angle, optimal fascicle length, physiological cross-sectional area, and tendon cross-sectional area were determined for each muscle. Data from this complete cadaver are presented in table format. The data from this study can be used to construct a musculoskeletal model of a specific individual who was ambulatory, something which has not been possible to date. This should increase the accuracy of the model output as the model will be representing a specific individual, not a synthesis of measurements from multiple individuals. Additionally, an elderly individual can be modeled which will provide insight into muscle function as we age."

Methods 43 male Wistar rats underwent stereotactic surgery and concentric bipolar platinum-iridium electrodes were bilaterally implanted into one of the three brain sites. [18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose-PET (18FDG-PET) and computed tomography (CT) scans were performed at the 7th (without DBS) and 9th day (with DBS) after surgery. Stimulation period matched tracer uptake period. Images were acquired with a small-animal PET-CT scanner. Differences in glucose uptake between groups were assessed with Statistical Parametric Mapping. Results DBS induced site-specific metabolic changes, although a common increased metabolic activity in the piriform cortex was found for the three brain targets. mPFC-DBS increased metabolic activity in the striatum, temporal and amygdala, and reduced it in the cerebellum, brainstem (BS) and periaqueductal gray matter (PAG). NAcc-DBS increased metabolic activity in the subiculum and olfactory bulb, and decreased it in the BS, PAG, septum and hypothalamus. DM-DBS increased metabolic activity in the striatum, NAcc and thalamus and decreased it in the temporal and cingulate cortex. Conclusions DBS induced significant changes in 18FDG uptake in brain regions associated with the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuitry. Stimulation of mPFC, NAcc and DM induced different patterns of 18FDG uptake despite interacting with the same circuitries. This may have important implications to DBS research suggesting individualized target selection according to specific neural modulatory requirements."
https://openalex.org/W2566281531,"Background Active transport has great potential to increase physical activity in older adolescents (17–18 years). Therefore, a theory- and evidence-based intervention was developed aiming to promote active transport among older adolescents. The intervention aimed to influence psychosocial factors of active transport since this is the first step in order to achieve a change in behaviour. The present study aimed to examine the effect of the intervention on the following psychosocial factors: intention to use active transport after obtaining a driving licence, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, subjective norm, self-efficacy, habit and awareness towards active transport. Methods A matched control three-arm study was conducted and consisted of a pre-test post-test design with intervention and control schools in Flanders (northern part of Belgium). A lesson promoting active transport was implemented as the last lesson in the course ‘Driving Licence at School’ in intervention schools (intervention group 1). Individuals in intervention group 2 received this active transport lesson and, in addition, they were asked to become a member of a Facebook group on active transport. Individuals in the control group only attended the regular course ‘Driving Licence at School’. Participants completed a questionnaire assessing socio-demographics and psychosocial variables at baseline, post (after one week) and follow-up (after eight weeks). To assess intervention effects, multilevel linear mixed models analyses were performed. Results A sample of 441 older adolescents (56.8% female; 17.4 (0.7) years) was analysed. For awareness regarding the existence of car sharing schemes, a significant increase in awareness from baseline to post measurement was found within intervention group 1 (p = 0.001) and intervention group 2 (p = 0.030) compared to the control group in which no change was found. In addition, a significant increase in awareness from baseline to follow-up measurement was found within intervention group 1 (p = 0.043) compared to a decrease in awareness from baseline to follow-up measurement within the control group. Conclusions Overall, the intervention was not effective to increase psychosocial correlates of active transport. Future intervention studies should search for alternative strategies to motivate and involve this hard to reach target group."
https://openalex.org/W2570404502,"Objective Genotyping for CYP2D6 has the potential to predict differences in metabolism of nortriptyline. This information could optimize pharmacotherapy. We determined the costs and effects of routine genotyping for old aged Dutch depressed inpatients. Methods With a decision-tree, we modelled the first 12 weeks of nortriptyline therapy. Direct costs of genotyping, hospitalization, therapeutic drug monitoring and drugs were included. Based on genotype, patients could be correctly, sub-, or supratherapeutically dosed. Improvement from sub- or supratherapeutically dosed patients to correctly dosed patients was simulated, assuming that genotyping would prevent under- or overdosing of patients. In the base case, this improvement was assumed to be 35%. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed to determine uncertainty around the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results In the base case analysis, costs for genotyping were assumed €200 per test with a corresponding ICER at €1 333 000 per QALY. To reach a €50 000 per QALY cut-off, genotyping costs should be decreased towards €40 per test. At genotyping test costs < €35 per test, genotyping was dominant. At test costs of €17 per test there was a 95% probability that genotyping was cost-effective at €50 000 per QALY. Conclusions CYP2D6 genotyping was not cost-effective at current genotyping costs at a €50 000 per QALY threshold, however at test costs below €40, genotyping could be costs-effective."
https://openalex.org/W2570634594,"Existing literature suggests that feedback could effectively reduce false memories in younger adults. However, it is unclear whether memory performance in older adults also might be affected by feedback. The current study tested the hypothesis that older adults can use immediate feedback to adjust their memory strategy, similar to younger adults, but after feedback is removed, older adults may not be able to maintain using the memory strategy. Older adults will display more false memories than younger adults due to a reduction in attentional resources. In Study 1, both younger and older adults adjusted gist processing and item-specific processing biases based on the feedback given (i.e., biased and objective feedback). In Study 2 after the feedback was removed, only younger adults with full attention were able to maintain the feedback-shaped memory strategy; whereas, both younger adults with divided attention and older adults had increased false memories after feedback was removed. The findings suggest that environmental support helps older adults as well as younger adults to adopt a memory strategy that demands high attentional resources, but when the support is removed, older adults can no longer maintain such a strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2571418445,"In conservation studies, solely widespread species are often used as indicators of diversity patterns, but narrow-ranged species can show different patterns. Here, we assess how well subsets of narrow-ranged, widespread or randomly selected plant species represent patterns of species richness and weighted endemism in Gabon, tropical Africa. Specifically, we assess the effect of using different definitions of widespread and narrow-ranged and of the information content of the subsets. Finally, we test if narrow-ranged species are overrepresented in species-rich areas. Based on distribution models of Gabonese plant species, we defined sequential subsets from narrow-ranged-to-widespread, widespread-to-narrow-ranged, and 100 randomly arranged species sequences using the range sizes of species in tropical Africa and within Gabon. Along these sequences, correlations between subsets and the total species richness and total weighted endemism patterns were computed. Random species subsets best represent the total species richness pattern, whereas subsets of narrow-ranged species best represent the total weighted endemism pattern. For species ordered according to their range sizes in tropical Africa, subsets of narrow-ranged species represented the total species richness pattern better than widespread species subsets did. However, the opposite was true when range sizes were truncated by the Gabonese national country borders. Correcting for the information content of the subset results in a skew of the sequential correlations, its direction depending on the range-size frequency distribution. Finally, we find a strong, positive, non-linear relation between weighted endemism and total species richness. Observed differences in the contribution of narrow-ranged, widespread and randomly selected species to species richness and weighted endemism patterns can be explained by the range-size frequency distribution and the use of different definitions of widespread or narrow-ranged. We call for a reconsideration of the use of widespread species as an indicator of diversity patterns, and advocate using the full ranges of species when assessing diversity patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2564045358,"Detection of cancer at an early stage is pivotal for successful treatment and long term survival, yet early diagnosis requires sensitive and specific markers that can be easily detected by screening procedures. Differences in the surface structure of tumor and healthy cells, if sufficiently pronounced and discernible, may serve that purpose. We analyzed the luminal surface of healthy and neoplastic human colorectal tissues for the presence and architecture of the glycocalyx-a dense network of highly glycosylated proteins-using transmission electron microscopy. The ultrastructural analyses showed that 93% of healthy mucosae were covered by an intact glycocalyx. Contrarily, on over 90% of the surface of neoplastic cells the glycocalyx was absent. The sensitivity and specificity of our marker ""absence of a glycocalyx"" are excellent, being 91% (83-96%) and 96% (89-99%) for adenocarcinomas and 94% (73-100%) and 92% (85-97%) for precancerous polyps (means and 95% confidence intervals). Using a cell culture model we could demonstrate that a particulate probe targeting a cell surface receptor usually concealed beneath the glycocalyx can bind selectively to glycocalyx-free areas of a tumor cell layer. We propose that the absence of a glycocalyx may serve as novel type of tumor marker. If the absence of the glycocalyx can be detected e.g. via binding of imaging probes to non-shielded surface receptors of anomalously differentiated cells, this tumor marker could be used to enable early diagnosis of colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2568314943,"Objectives Left ventricular remodeling after acute myocardial infarction increases cardiovascular events and mortality. But few study was done in patients with preserved ejection fraction (EF > 40%). We investigate whether the strain and strain rate by 2D speckle tracking echocardiography could predict left ventricular remodeling after acute myocardial infarction in this cohort. Methods The 83 patients (average age 60.7 ± 12.3 y, 75 [90.4%] male) with new-onset acute myocardial infarction receiving echocardiography immediately, and 6 months after admission were grouped by the presence or absence of left ventricular remodeling. Strain and strain rate including longitudinal, circumferential, and radial direction were calculated. The average of strain and strain rate of which segmental longitudinal strains > – 15% were defined as the injury longitudinal strain (InjLS). Results Left ventricular remodeling occurred in 24 of 83 patients (28.9%). In univariate logistic regression analyses, gender, peak CK-MB, log BNP, use of statin before discharge, wall motion score index, and InjLS were significantly associated with left ventricular remodeling (p < 0.05). In multivariate analysis using the forward stepwise method, gender, CK-MB, and InjLS were independent predictors. The hazard ratio for InjLS was 1.48 (p = 0.04). Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses showed the area under the curve (AUC) of InjLS was largest (AUC = 0.75, cut-off value = –11.7%, sensitivity = 81%, specificity = 71%, p < 0.01). In ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction subgroup, InjLS was the only predictor according to ROC analysis (AUC = 0.79, p < 0.01, cut-off value = –11.4%, sensitivity = 88%, specificity = 77%) and multivariate logistic regression analysis (hazard ratio = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.22–2.88, p < 0.01). Conclusions InjLS was an excellent predictor for left ventricular remodeling after acute myocardial infarction in patient with preserved ejection fraction."
https://openalex.org/W2568382319,"Although significant progress has been made in understanding multisensory interactions at the behavioral level, their underlying neural mechanisms remain relatively poorly understood in cortical areas, particularly during the control of action. In recent experiments where animals reached to and actively maintained their arm position at multiple spatial locations while receiving either proprioceptive or visual-proprioceptive position feedback, multisensory interactions were shown to be associated with reduced spiking (i.e. subadditivity) as well as reduced intra-trial and across-trial spiking variability in the superior parietal lobule (SPL). To further explore the nature of such interaction-induced changes in spiking variability we quantified the spike train dynamics of 231 of these neurons. Neurons were classified as Poisson, bursty, refractory, or oscillatory (in the 13-30 Hz ""beta-band"") based on their spike train power spectra and autocorrelograms. No neurons were classified as Poisson-like in either the proprioceptive or visual-proprioceptive conditions. Instead, oscillatory spiking was most commonly observed with many neurons exhibiting these oscillations under only one set of feedback conditions. The results suggest that the SPL may belong to a putative beta-synchronized network for arm position maintenance and that position estimation may be subserved by different subsets of neurons within this network depending on available sensory information. In addition, the nature of the observed spiking variability suggests that models of multisensory interactions in the SPL should account for both Poisson-like and non-Poisson variability."
https://openalex.org/W2569208205,"Background Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an effective therapy for supporting infants with reversible cardiopulmonary failure. Still, survivors are at risk for long-term neurodevelopmental impairments, the cause of which is not fully understood. Objective To elucidate the effects of ECMO on the newborn brain. We hypothesized that the cerebral metabolic profile of neonates who received ECMO would differ from neonates who did not receive ECMO. To address this, we used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to investigate the effects of venoarterial and venovenous ECMO on cerebral metabolism. Methods 41 neonates treated with ECMO were contrasted to 38 age-matched neonates. Results All 1H-MRS data were acquired from standardized grey matter and white matter regions of interest using a short-echo (TE = 35 milliseconds), point-resolved spectroscopy sequence (PRESS) and quantitated using LCModel. Metabolite concentrations (mmol/kg) were compared across groups using multivariate analysis of covariance. Elevated creatine (p = 0.002) and choline (p = 0.005) concentrations were observed in the grey matter among neonates treated with ECMO relative to the reference group. Likewise, choline concentrations were elevated in the white matter (p = 0.003) while glutamate was reduced (p = 0.03). Contrasts between ECMO groups revealed lower osmolite concentrations (e.g. myoinositol) among the venovenous ECMO group. Conclusion Neonates who underwent ECMO were found to have an abnormal cerebral metabolic profile, with the pattern of abnormalities suggestive of an underlying inflammatory process. Additionally, neonates who underwent venovenous ECMO had low cerebral osmolite concentrations as seen in vasogenic edema."
https://openalex.org/W2568256646,"The hypervariable region I (HVRI) is persistently used to discern haplotypes, to distinguish geographic subpopulations, and to infer taxonomy in a range of organisms. Numerous studies have highlighted greater heterogeneity elsewhere in the mitochondrial DNA control region, however–particularly, in some species, in other understudied hypervariable regions. To assess the abundance and utility of such potential variations in orang-utans, we characterised 36 complete control-region haplotypes, of which 13 were of Sumatran and 23 of Bornean maternal ancestry, and compared polymorphisms within these and within shorter HVRI segments predominantly analysed in prior phylogenetic studies of Sumatran (~385 bp) and Bornean (~323 bp) orang-utans. We amplified the complete control region in a single PCR that proved successful even with highly degraded, non-invasive samples. By using species-specific primers to produce a single large amplicon (~1600 bp) comprising flanking coding regions, our method also serves to better avoid amplification of nuclear mitochondrial insertions (numts). We found the number, length and position of hypervariable regions is inconsistent between orang-utan species, and that prior definitions of the HVRI were haphazard. Polymorphisms occurring outside the predominantly analysed segments were phylogeographically informative in isolation, and could be used to assign haplotypes to comparable clades concordant with geographic subpopulations. The predominantly analysed segments could discern only up to 76% of all haplotypes, highlighting the forensic utility of complete control-region sequences. In the face of declining sequencing costs and our proven application to poor-quality DNA extracts, we see no reason to ever amplify only specific ‘hypervariable regions’ in any taxa, particularly as their lengths and positions are inconsistent and cannot be reliably defined–yet this strategy predominates widely. Given their greater utility and consistency, we instead advocate analysis of complete control-region sequences in future studies, where any shorter segment might otherwise have proven the region of choice."
