The emerging outbreak of Zika virus in the Americas has brought this once obscure pathogen to the forefront of global healthcare. Mostly transmitted by Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus mosquitoes, Zika virus infections have been further spread by international travel and have expanded to large, heavily populated regions of South, Central, and North America (Bogoch et al., 2016Bogoch I.I.

Synthetic biology is an emerging discipline that has great potential to respond to such pandemics. The increasing ability of synthetic biologists to repurpose and engineer natural biological components for practical applications has led to new opportunities for molecular diagnostics (Kotula et al., 2014Kotula J.W. Kerns S.J. Shaket L.A. Siraj L. Collins J.J. Way J.C. Silver P.A. Programmable bacteria detect and record an environmental signal in the mammalian gut.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Pardee K. Collins J.J. Synthetic biology devices for in vitro and in vivo diagnostics.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 14429-14435Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We previously developed two biotechnologies that dramatically lower the cost of and technical barriers to the development of synthetic biology-based diagnostics. The first technology, programmable RNA sensors called toehold switches, can be rationally designed to bind and sense virtually any RNA sequence (Green et al., 2014Green A.A. Silver P.A. Collins J.J. Yin P. Toehold switches: de-novo-designed regulators of gene expression.Cell. 2014; 159: 925-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The second technology, a freeze-dried, paper-based, cell-free protein expression platform, allows for the deployment of these toehold switch sensors outside of a research laboratory by providing a sterile and abiotic method for the storage and distribution of genetic circuits at room temperature (Pardee et al., 2014Pardee K. Green A.A. Ferrante T. Cameron D.E. DaleyKeyser A. Yin P. Collins J.J. Paper-based synthetic gene networks.Cell. 2014; 159: 940-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). We combined these technologies to create a platform for rapidly and inexpensively developing and deploying diagnostic sensors. In the context of the Zika virus outbreak, the paper-based sensors offer a solution to the critical challenges facing diagnosis of the virus. Standard serological approaches, such as antibody detection, are limited in diagnostic value due to cross-reactivity in patients that have previously been infected by other flaviviruses circulating in the region. As a result, accurate diagnosis requires nucleic acid-based detection methods, such as PCR and isothermal nucleic acid amplification (Lanciotti et al., 2008Lanciotti R.S. Kosoy O.L. Laven J.J. Velez J.O. Lambert A.J. Johnson A.J. Stanfield S.M. Duffy M.R. Genetic and serologic properties of Zika virus associated with an epidemic, Yap State, Micronesia, 2007.Emerg. Infect.

However, such techniques are relatively expensive, require technical expertise to run and interpret, and utilize equipment that is incompatible with use in remote and low-resource locations where surveillance and containment are critically needed. Here, we demonstrate the rapid development of a diagnostic workflow for sequence-specific detection of Zika virus that can be employed in low-resource settings (Figure 1). We have addressed limitations in the practical deployment of nucleic acid-based molecular diagnostics by combining isothermal RNA amplification with toehold switch sensors on our freeze-dried, paper-based platform. We automate the amplification primer and sensor design process using in silico algorithms and demonstrate a high-throughput pipeline to assemble and test 48 Zika sensors in less than 7 hr. Clinically relevant sensitivity is attained using our amplification and detection scheme, and we report no significant detection of the closely related Dengue virus. To further increase diagnostic capabilities, we develop a CRISPR/Cas9-based module that discriminates between Zika genotypes with single-base resolution. Finally, we employ a simple sample-preparation protocol to reliably extract viral RNA and demonstrate robust detection with this scheme using active Zika virus samples. Toehold switch sensors are programmable synthetic riboregulators that control the translation of a gene via the binding of a trans-acting trigger RNA. The switches contain a hairpin structure that blocks gene translation in cis by sequestration of the ribosome binding site (RBS) and start codon. Upon a switch binding to a complementary trigger RNA, sequestration of the RBS and start codon is relieved, activating gene translation (Figures 2A and 2B ) (Green et al., 2014Green A.A. Silver P.A. Collins J.J. Yin P. Toehold switches: de-novo-designed regulators of gene expression.Cell. 2014; 159: 925-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). To allow for colorimetric detection of trigger RNA sequences, the sensors can be designed to regulate translation of the enzyme LacZ, which mediates a color change by converting a yellow substrate (chlorophenol red-β-D-galactopyranoside) to a purple product (chlorophenol red). Toehold switch sensors for sequence-based detection of Zika virus were generated using a modified version of the previously developed in silico design algorithm (Supplemental Information) (Green et al., 2014Green A.A. Silver P.A. Collins J.J. Yin P. Toehold switches: de-novo-designed regulators of gene expression.Cell. 2014; 159: 925-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The modified algorithm screened the genome of the Zika strain prevalent in the Americas (Genbank: KU312312) for regions compatible with RNA amplification and toehold switch activation. The selected Zika genome regions were then computationally filtered to eliminate potential homology to the human transcriptome and to a panel of related viruses, including Dengue and Chikungunya. A total of 24 unique regions of the Zika genome compatible with downstream sensing efforts were identified. Two toehold switches, each utilizing a different design scheme, were designed for each region, resulting in a total of 48 sensors. The first design scheme, termed the A series, utilizes a modification to the original toehold switch (Green et al., 2014Green A.A. Silver P.A. Collins J.J. Yin P. Toehold switches: de-novo-designed regulators of gene expression.Cell. 2014; 159: 925-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) that reduces the size of the loop domain from 18 nts to 11 nts (Figure 2A) to discourage loop-mediated docking of the ribosome and therefore reduce leakage in the OFF state. The second design scheme, termed the B series, features a 12-nt loop and incorporates a more thermodynamically stable stem in order to lower OFF state gene expression (Figure 2B). In vitro assembly and initial screening of all 48 sensors took place in a 7 hr time period, with low costs associated with sensor development (DNA input $20 USD/sensor) and testing ($0.10–$1/test). All 48 sensors and 24 targeted genomic regions were assembled in-house using in vitro protocols. Toehold switches were constructed by ligating the sensors (∼130 nt) to a LacZ reporter element in a single 2 hr PCR-based step. Sensor performance screening to assess each sensor against its respective trigger RNA element (Zika genome fragment) was completed using low volume, cell-free transcription and translation reactions on paper. We found that 25 (52%) of the 48 sensors produce a fold change of five or greater in the presence of the appropriate trigger element (128–178 nucleotide regions of the Zika genome; Figures 2C, 2D, and S1). The top-ranked sensors exhibited activation as high as 34-fold over sensor alone (sensor 27B) and were activated in as quickly as 20 min after incubation at 37°C (sensors 7A and 8A). For all sensors, maximum fold change occurred within the first 90 min. Averaging the LacZ output from sensors not exposed to trigger RNA confirmed that the low background design of the series B toehold switch sensors successfully reduced signal leakage (Figure 2D, inset). We selected top performing sensors from both the A and B series for trigger RNA titration experiments and found that all chosen sensors were activated with as little as 30 nM of trigger RNA (Figure 3A). The sensors displayed a linear response to RNA concentration, providing semiquantitative information on input trigger RNA values (Figure S2A). Additionally, our top three sensors were highly orthogonal to each other when challenged with a high dose of trigger RNA from off-target Zika sequences (3,000 nM) (Figure S2B).Figure S2Sensor Specificity and Sensitivity, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Linear response of sensors 27B, 31B and 32B to corresponding RNA trigger at 0 nM, 3 nM, 30 nM and 300 nM.

Though the sensors displayed specificity for their respective Zika RNA trigger, they were unable to detect clinically relevant RNA concentrations. Zika viral loads have been documented as high as 202 × 106 copies/ml (365 fM) in urine (Gourinat et al., 2015Gourinat A.-C. O’Connor O. Calvez E. Goarant C. Dupont-Rouzeyrol M. Detection of Zika virus in urine.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2015; 21: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). However, viral loads in saliva and serum are reportedly even lower, with 3 × 106 copies/ml (4.9 fM) (Barzon et al., 2016Barzon L. Pacenti M. Berto A. Sinigaglia A. Franchin E. Lavezzo E. Brugnaro P. Palù G.

(2016). ZIKV-001: Infection of three rhesus macaques with French Polynesian Zika virus. https://zika.labkey.com/project/OConnor/ZIKV-001/begin.view. 2016.Google Scholar) and 7.2 × 105 copies/ml (1.2 fM) (Lanciotti et al., 2008Lanciotti R.S. Kosoy O.L. Laven J.J. Velez J.O. Lambert A.J. Johnson A.J. Stanfield S.M. Duffy M.R. Genetic and serologic properties of Zika virus associated with an epidemic, Yap State, Micronesia, 2007.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2008; 14: 1232-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar) in primate and patient serum, respectively. Accordingly, to increase the sensitivity of our diagnostic platform, we incorporated an isothermal RNA amplification technique known as NASBA (nucleic acid sequence-based amplification) into our workflow (Figure 1). NASBA is a promising candidate for use with our diagnostic scheme because it is known to be extremely sensitive and has a proven track record in field-based diagnostic applications (Cordray and Richards-Kortum, 2012Cordray M.S. Richards-Kortum R.R. Emerging nucleic acid-based tests for point-of-care detection of malaria.Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2012; 87: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The amplification process begins with reverse transcription of a target RNA that is mediated by a sequence-specific reverse primer to create an RNA/DNA duplex. RNase H then degrades the RNA template, allowing a forward primer containing the T7 promoter to bind and initiate elongation of the complementary strand, generating a double-stranded DNA product. T7-mediated transcription of the DNA template then creates copies of the target RNA sequence. Importantly, each new target RNA can be detected by the toehold switch sensors and also serve as starting material for further amplification cycles. NASBA requires an initial heating step (65°C), followed by isothermal amplification at 41°C (Figure 3B) (Guatelli et al., 1990Guatelli J.C. Whitfield K.M. Kwoh D.Y. Barringer K.J. Richman D.D. Gingeras T.R. Isothermal, in vitro amplification of nucleic acids by a multienzyme reaction modeled after retroviral replication.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87: 1874-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). NASBA was performed on trigger RNA corresponding to Zika genomic regions for sensors 27B and 32B. Trigger RNAs were spiked into either water or human serum (7%) to more closely mimic clinical samples. NASBA reactions were run for 2 hr and then applied to freeze-dried, paper-based sensors. We saw detection with Zika sensors from NASBA reactions initiated with as little as 3 fM of trigger RNA (Figure 3C), a value within the range of reported patient viral loads. Zika sensor detection of NASBA-amplified trigger RNA proved to be reliable on samples spiked into either serum or water (Figure S2C). Additionally, for reactions initialized with high concentrations of trigger RNA (> 300 fM), NASBA reaction times could be reduced to as little as 30 min (Figure S2D). NASBA reagents are compatible with freeze-drying (Figure S2E) and could therefore be easily deployed and utilized alongside our paper-based sensors. We also demonstrated that NASBA can be run in the absence of the initial heating step (65°C) (Figure S2F), further reducing the technical and power requirements for deployment. To move our experiments toward conditions more representative of those found in clinics worldwide, we focused on three key efforts: (1) testing sensor specificity against related viruses that share clinical symptoms, partial homology, and geographic range with Zika virus; (2) building a second-generation portable, battery-powered reader to provide lab-quality results in low-resource environments; and (3) developing a low-cost and tractable method for viral RNA extraction. Although our sensor design algorithm screened for Zika genomic sequences that are mostly distinct from those of related viruses, the targeted Zika sequences do share substantial similarity (51%–59%) with their Dengue virus counterparts (Figures S3A and S3B). To test the Zika sensors for possible cross-reactivity, we exposed the sensors to regions of the Dengue genome that share a degree of homology with regions targeted in the Zika genome. Sensors 27B and 32B were treated with high concentrations of RNA amplicons (3,000 nM) from either Zika or Dengue genomic regions. As seen in Figure 4A, Dengue RNA sequences failed to activate the toehold switch sensors. We also tested our NASBA primer sets for specificity to their targeted Zika sequences by applying the NASBA-mediated amplification and paper-based detection scheme to 300 fM inputs of the Dengue and Zika RNA in human serum (7%). Again, we did not see a response to the Dengue RNA sequences, demonstrating robust sequence specificity in our amplification and detection scheme (Figure 4B).Figure 4Moving toward a Field-Ready Diagnostic for Zika VirusShow full caption(A) Sequence specificity of Zika virus sensors 27B and 32B.

See also Figure S3. As part of our efforts to advance the paper-based sensor platform toward field-ready diagnostics, we designed a second-generation portable electronic reader to serve as an accessible, low-cost companion technology that provides robust and quantitative measurements of sensor outputs. The electronic reader was assembled using readily available consumer components, open-source code, and laser-cut acrylic housing, with a total cost of just under $250 (Figure S4 and Table S3). The reader is powered by a lithium ion battery (18.5 hr) that can be re-charged via micro USB and houses onboard data storage (4 GB) to resolve the need for an attached laptop during diagnostic reads (Pardee et al., 2014Pardee K.

To achieve sensitive detection of toehold switch signal output, an acrylic chip that holds the freeze-dried, paper-based reactions is placed into the reader between an LED light source (570 nm) and electronic sensors (Figure S4B). Using onboard electronics, each sample is read 29 times per minute, providing low-noise measurements of changes in light transmission due to LacZ-mediated color change. To demonstrate the utility of the companion reader, we monitored detection of 1 fM and 3 fM of Zika RNA amplicons that had been amplified in NASBA reactions for 2.5 hr. The reader detected significant signal from both samples, which are within the repo"
https://openalex.org/W2345350059,"Apoptosis is one type of programmed cell death. Increasingly, non-apoptotic cell death is recognized as being genetically controlled, or 'regulated'. However, the full extent and diversity of alternative cell death mechanisms remain uncharted. Here we surveyed the landscape of pharmacologically accessible cell death mechanisms. In an examination of 56 caspase-independent lethal compounds, modulatory profiling showed that 10 compounds induced three different types of regulated non-apoptotic cell death. Optimization of one of those ten resulted in the discovery of FIN56, a specific inducer of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis has been found to occur when the lipid-repair enzyme GPX4 is inhibited. FIN56 promoted degradation of GPX4. FIN56 also bound to and activated squalene synthase, an enzyme involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis, independent of GPX4 degradation. These discoveries show that dysregulation of lipid metabolism is associated with ferroptosis. This systematic approach is a means to discover and characterize novel cell death phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2346094579,"In metabolism, available free energy is limited and must be divided across pathway steps to maintain a negative ΔG throughout. For each reaction, ΔG is log proportional both to a concentration ratio (reaction quotient to equilibrium constant) and to a flux ratio (backward to forward flux). Here we use isotope labeling to measure absolute metabolite concentrations and fluxes in Escherichia coli, yeast and a mammalian cell line. We then integrate this information to obtain a unified set of concentrations and ΔG for each organism. In glycolysis, we find that free energy is partitioned so as to mitigate unproductive backward fluxes associated with ΔG near zero. Across metabolism, we observe that absolute metabolite concentrations and ΔG are substantially conserved and that most substrate (but not inhibitor) concentrations exceed the associated enzyme binding site dissociation constant (Km or Ki). The observed conservation of metabolite concentrations is consistent with an evolutionary drive to utilize enzymes efficiently given thermodynamic and osmotic constraints."
https://openalex.org/W2345463283,"We examined the contribution of endogenous cholinergic signaling to the acquisition and extinction of fear- related memory by optogenetic regulation of cholinergic input to the basal lateral amygdala (BLA). Stimulation of cholinergic terminal fields within the BLA in awake-behaving mice during training in a cued fear-conditioning paradigm slowed the extinction of learned fear as assayed by multi-day retention of extinction learning. Inhibition of cholinergic activity during training reduced the acquisition of learned fear behaviors. Circuit mechanisms underlying the behavioral effects of cholinergic signaling in the BLA were assessed by in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiological recording. Photostimulation of endogenous cholinergic input (1) enhances firing of putative BLA principal neurons through activation of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), (2) enhances glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the BLA, and (3) induces LTP of cortical-amygdala circuits. These studies support an essential role of cholinergic modulation of BLA circuits in the inscription and retention of fear memories."
https://openalex.org/W2346016739,"Apolipoprotein (apo) E4 is the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the mechanism by which it causes cognitive decline is unclear. In knockin (KI) mice, human apoE4 causes age-dependent learning and memory impairments and degeneration of GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Here we report two functional apoE4-KI phenotypes involving sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), hippocampal network events critical for memory processes. Aged apoE4-KI mice had fewer SWRs than apoE3-KI mice and significantly reduced slow gamma activity during SWRs. Elimination of apoE4 in GABAergic interneurons, which prevents learning and memory impairments, rescued SWR-associated slow gamma activity but not SWR abundance in aged mice. SWR abundance was reduced similarly in young and aged apoE4-KI mice; however, the full SWR-associated slow gamma deficit emerged only in aged apoE4-KI mice. These results suggest that progressive decline of interneuron-enabled slow gamma activity during SWRs critically contributes to apoE4-mediated learning and memory impairments.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJmYzY2N2JiMDE0N2JjN2M4ZDgwMzExMTkzNDM0MGQyMCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc3ODg0ODE4fQ.kpwmKncUJR92fHRJBqWWkg-UrGC79lAmjPVQCQeOKIX19qDAw7XkbqMlmPErUaE5RT41kkAO7jnNxDJ5ajPWJsLSzOGDMNMGyUFDmeC8lHUU-F6Tzwaqgszqo1LPmJRZUsGfMUfXXjq8TUlzbzoXLMU3uR3mXm5ypoDywXKsM3ZL4xB1R5FwVCj22wot0w5nLisBAYw9vijgA5eciryTASNXXG63CsuRsFLf09uBPNen_TeG8ECpcg6msFxxovGMxRI3Ci_-Ixuz4vpWZozYcn3A5GUO0dHoD2kU8glNtJSFVpLSA8MSid8B16TfmG_LkR0b0v955uanYXs94ALIvw(mp4, (59.06 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2346512951,"Pollard and colleagues demonstrate in vitro and in fission yeast that the LifeAct actin probe can affect actin filament nucleation and dynamics and perturb actin-dependent cellular processes unless low concentrations are used. When tagged with a fluorescent protein, actin is not fully functional1, so the LifeAct peptide fused to a fluorescent protein is widely used to localize actin filaments in live cells2. However, we find that these fusion proteins have many concentration-dependent effects on actin assembly in vitro and in fission yeast cells. mEGFP–LifeAct inhibits actin assembly during endocytosis as well as assembly and constriction of the cytokinetic contractile ring. Purified mEGFP–LifeAct and LifeAct–mCherry bind actin filaments with Kd values of ∼10 μM. LifeAct–mCherry can promote actin filament nucleation and either promote or inhibit filament elongation. Both separately and together, profilin and formins suppress these effects. LifeAct–mCherry can also promote or inhibit actin filament severing by cofilin. These concentration-dependent effects mean that caution is necessary when overexpressing LifeAct fusion proteins to label actin filaments in cells. Therefore, we used low micromolar concentrations of tagged LifeAct to follow assembly and disassembly of actin filaments in cells. Careful titrations also gave an estimate of a peak of ∼190,000 actin molecules (∼500 μm) in the fission yeast contractile ring. These filaments shorten from ∼500 to ∼100 subunits as the ring constricts."

How Pcdhs bind homophilically through their extracellular cadherin (EC) domains among dozens of highly similar isoforms has not been determined. Here, we report crystal structures for extracellular regions from four mouse Pcdh isoforms (α4, α7, β6, and β8), revealing a canonical head-to-tail interaction mode for homophilic trans dimers comprising primary intermolecular EC1:EC4 and EC2:EC3 interactions. A subset of trans interface residues exhibit isoform-specific conservation, suggesting roles in recognition specificity. Mutation of these residues, along with trans-interacting partner residues, altered the specificities of Pcdh interactions. Together, these data show how sequence variation among Pcdh isoforms encodes their diverse strict homophilic recognition specificities, which are required for their key roles in neural circuit assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2345570451,"Breast cancer is the second most common cancer and a leading cause of cancer death in women. Specifically, estrogen receptor-α (ERα)-negative breast cancers are clinically more aggressive and normally do not respond to conventional hormone-directed therapies such as tamoxifen. Although epigenetic-based therapies such as 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine and/or trichostatin A as DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, respectively, can regulate the expression of ERα, this can often lead to a number of side effects. Plant-based dietary compounds such as resveratrol and pterostilbene in novel combinatorial therapy provides new avenues to target these side effects and provide similar results with a higher level of safety. Here, we report that combinatorial resveratrol and pterostilbene leads to the reactivation of ERα expression in ERα-negative breast cancer cells in a time-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the ERα promoter in each cell type revealed an increase in enrichment of acetyl-H3, acetyl-H3lysine9 (H3K9) and acetyl-H4 active chromatin markers in the ERα promoter region after combinatorial treatment. This treatment also resulted in a significant change in HDAC and histone acetyl transferase (HAT) enzyme activity in these cells after 3 days of treatments. The combination resulted in a significant decrease in DNMT enzyme activity and 5-methylcytosine levels in MDA-MB-157 breast cancer cells. Moreover, reactivation of ERα expression by resveratrol combined with pterostilbene was found to sensitize ERα-dependent response to 17β-estradiol (E2)-mediated cellular proliferation and antagonist 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT)-mediated inhibition of cellular proliferation in ERα-negative breast cancer cells. E2 and 4-OHT further affected the ERα-responsive downstream progesterone receptor (PGR) gene in ERα reactivated MDA-MB-157 cells. Collectively, our findings provide a new and safer way of restoring ERα expression by regulating epigenetic mechanisms with the use of phytochemicals in combinatorial therapy. This combination can further provide effective treatment options for hormonal refractory breast cancer with available anti-hormonal therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2346994881,"Hepatic tissue engineering using decellularized scaffolds is a potential therapeutic alternative to conventional transplantation. However, scaffolds are usually obtained using decellularization protocols that destroy the extracellular matrix (ECM) and hamper clinical translation. We aim to develop a decellularization technique that reliably maintains hepatic microarchitecture and ECM components. Isolated rat livers were decellularized by detergent-enzymatic technique with (EDTA-DET) or without EDTA (DET). Histology, DNA quantification and proteomics confirmed decellularization with further DNA reduction with the addition of EDTA. Quantification, histology, immunostaining, and proteomics demonstrated preservation of extracellular matrix components in both scaffolds with a higher amount of collagen and glycosaminoglycans in the EDTA-DET scaffold. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray phase contrast imaging showed microarchitecture preservation, with EDTA-DET scaffolds more tightly packed. DET scaffold seeding with a hepatocellular cell line demonstrated complete repopulation in 14 days, with cells proliferating at that time. Decellularization using DET preserves microarchitecture and extracellular matrix components whilst allowing for cell growth for up to 14 days. Addition of EDTA creates a denser, more compact matrix. Transplantation of the scaffolds and scaling up of the methodology are the next steps for successful hepatic tissue engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2345577953,"The orbitofrontal cortex plays a central role in good-based economic decisions. When subjects make choices, neurons in this region represent the identities and values of offered and chosen goods. Notably, choices in different behavioral contexts may involve a potentially infinite variety of goods. Thus a fundamental question concerns the stability versus flexibility of the decision circuit. Here we show in rhesus monkeys that neurons encoding the identity or the subjective value of particular goods in a given context 'remap' and become associated with different goods when the context changes. At the same time, the overall organization of the decision circuit and the function of individual cells remain stable across contexts. In particular, two neurons supporting the same decision in one context also support the same decision in different contexts. These results demonstrate how the same neural circuit can underlie economic decisions involving a large variety of goods."
https://openalex.org/W2346284199,"Vitellogenin (Vg) plays vital role in oocytes and embryo development in insects. Vg is synthesized in the fat body, moves through haemolymph and accumulates in oocytes. Vitellogenin receptors (VgR) present on the surface of oocytes, are responsible for Vg transportation from haemolymph to oocytes. Here, we cloned and characterized these genes from Bemisia tabaci Asia1 (BtA1) species. The cloned BtA1Vg and BtA1VgR genes consisted of 6,330 and 5,430 bp long open reading frames, which encoded 2,109 and 1,809 amino acid (AA) residues long protein. The BtA1Vg protein comprised LPD_N, DUF1943 and VWFD domains, typical R/KXXR/K, DGXR and GL/ICG motifs, and polyserine tracts. BtA1VgR protein contained 12 LDLa, 10 LDLb and 7 EGF domains, and a trans-membrane and cytoplasmic region at C-terminus. Phylogenetic analyses indicated evolutionary association of BtA1Vg and BtA1VgR with the homologous proteins from various insect species. Silencing of BtA1VgR by siRNA did not affect the transcript level of BtA1Vg. However, BtA1Vg protein accumulation in oocytes was directly influenced with the expression level of BtA1VgR. Further, BtA1VgR silencing caused significant mortality and reduced fecundity in adult whiteflies. The results established the role of BtA1VgR in transportation of BtA1Vg in oocytes. Further, these proteins are essential for fecundity, and therefore these can be potential RNAi targets for insect control in crop plants."
https://openalex.org/W2345906604,"Objectives To demonstrate the image quality that can be obtained for multiple contrasts using ultra-high resolution MRI (highest nominal resolution: 350 μm isotropic) at 7T using appropriate motion-correction. Materials and Methods An MRI-based fat-excitation motion navigator (which requires no additional hardware) was incorporated into T1-weighted (MP2RAGE, 350 μm nominal isotropic resolution, total scan time 124 mins over 2 sessions. The MP2RAGE also provides quantitative T1-maps), 3D-TSE (380 μm nominal isotropic resolution, total scan time 58 mins) and T2*-weighted protocols (3D-GRE, 380 μm nominal isotropic resolution, total scan time 42 mins) on a 7T MR system. Images from each contrast are presented from a single healthy adult male volunteer (34 years) for direct comparison. The subject provided written consent in accordance with the local review board. Results Images of various brain structures are revealed at unprecedented quality for in-vivo MRI. The presented images permit, for example, to delimit the internal structure of the basal ganglia and thalamus. The single digitationes of the hippocampus are visible, and the gyrus dentatus can be visualized. Intracortical contrast was also observed in the neocortex, including the stria of Gennari of the primary visual cortex. Conclusions Appropriate motion-correction allows MRI scans to be performed with extended scan times enabling exceptionally high resolution scans with high image quality, with the use of a 7T scanner allowing large brain coverage for 350–380 μm isotropic voxels with total scan times for each contrast ranging from 42 to 124 minutes."

Restorative therapies based on nerve cell replacement, from extrinsic or intrinsic sources, have seen significant advances over the past decade. Interest in the therapeutic potential of cell replacement in Parkinson’s disease (PD) in particular has re-emerged with the new EU-funded clinical trial using fetal cells (Abbott, 2014Abbott A. Fetal-cell revival for Parkinson’s.Nature. 2014; 510: 195-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the development of optimized and efficient differentiation protocols for human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) (Kirkeby et al., 2012Kirkeby A.

Pioneering clinical trials, performed over the last decades using dopamine (DA) neuroblasts from fetal mesencephalon (still considered the gold-standard DA cell replacement in PD) have been encouraging but also raised significant concerns. While some grafted patients have displayed substantial long-term clinical benefit from the dopaminergic cell transplants placed in the caudate/putamen (Kefalopoulou et al., 2014Kefalopoulou Z. Politis M. Piccini P. Mencacci N. Bhatia K. Jahanshahi M. Widner H. Rehncrona S. Brundin P. Björklund A. et al.Long-term clinical outcome of fetal cell transplantation for Parkinson disease: two case reports.JAMA Neurol. 2014; 71: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), the outcome has been highly variable (Barker et al., 2013Barker R.A.

Fetal dopaminergic transplantation trials and the future of neural grafting in Parkinson’s disease.Lancet Neurol. 2013; 12: 84-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and a significant number of patients have also developed abnormal involuntary movements induced by the graft (graft-induced dyskinesias, or GID). This troublesome side effect, seen in the absence of any drug treatment, has so far not been possible to reproduce in rodent or primate models of PD. Recent studies have shown that these GIDs are dependent of serotonergic neurotransmission (Politis et al., 2011Politis M. Oertel W.H. Wu K. Quinn N.P. Pogarell O. Brooks D.J. Bjorklund A. Lindvall O. Piccini P. Graft-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson’s disease: high striatal serotonin/DAtransporter ratio.Mov. Disord. 2011; 26: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and that they can be suppressed by drugs acting on inhibitory autoreceptors located on the serotonin neurons (Politis et al., 2010Politis M. Wu K. Loane C. Quinn N.P. Brooks D.J. Rehncrona S. Bjorklund A. Lindvall O. Piccini P. Serotonergic neurons mediate dyskinesia side effects in Parkinson’s patients with neural transplants.Sci. Transl. Med. 2010; 2: 38ra46Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). However, the functional link between the serotonin system and dysregulated DA neurotransmission causing dyskinesias still remains elusive. The main reason for this is due to the fact that all attempts to reproduce this side effect in an authentic and clinically relevant animal model have so far failed. The goal of this study was to explore the mechanism underlying the induction of GIDs using a novel rat model where DA neurons from Cre-expressing donor rats (a knockin Cre driver line under the endogenous TH [tyrosine hydroxylase] promoter) are transplanted to the striatum in parkinsonian rats. The transplants are subsequently transduced to express, selectively within the grafted DA neurons, a novel bimodal pair of chemogenetic receptors (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs, or DREADDs) (Vardy et al., 2015Vardy E. Robinson J.E. Li C. Olsen R.H. DiBerto J.F. Giguere P.M. Sassano F.M. Huang X.P. Zhu H.

While these DREADDs have been shown to either increase or silence (depending on the DREADD expressed) axonal firing in DA neurons in vivo and in slice preparations (Mahler et al., 2014Mahler S.V.

This has allowed us to unequivocally determine the functional impact of ectopically transplanted DA neurons (placed in the striatum, which is the target structure for dopaminergic transmission from the A9 midbrain DA neurons and corresponds to the placement in caudate/putamen in patients). While previous studies have managed to silence a tonically active hESC transplant using optogenetic tools in mice (Steinbeck et al., 2015Steinbeck J.A. Choi S.J. Mrejeru A. Ganat Y. Deisseroth K.

Caiazzo M. Leo D. Dvoretskova E. Medrihan L. Colasante G. Giannelli S. Theka I. Russo G. Mus L. et al.Remote control of induced dopaminergic neurons in parkinsonian rats.J. Clin. Invest. 2014; 124: 3215-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), this study aims to achieve a selective and reversible bimodal regulation of the DA neurons contained in the transplant, imperative to dissect the underlying mechanisms of the GIDs. In this study, we show that in vivo transduction of transplanted Cre-expressing neurons using recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors carrying a Cre-inducible construct can be achieved with very high efficiency and that this method can be used to selectively regulate DA neuron function in a bimodal manner. With this model, we demonstrate unequivocally that an active DA neurotransmission is necessary for the therapeutic capacity of the fetal graft. Our data also point to the fact that the ectopic placement of the graft may result in a suboptimal function, and that this can be significantly enhanced using selective activation of the DA cells in the graft. We found that increase of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in the grafted DA neurons, obtained through activation of the metabotropic Gs-coupled DREADD (rM3Ds), is sufficient to induce significant GIDs in animals in the absence of any L-DOPA treatment. Building on these findings, we were able to identify the serotonin 5-HT6 receptor as an important activator of DA neurons in the graft and show that selective activation of this receptor using the potent 5-HT6 agonist ST1936 can induce significant GIDs with a phenotype very similar to L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) even in unprimed animals (i.e., animals that never received L-DOPA and thus never developed LIDs). Lastly, we show that this receptor is highly relevant for clinical transplantation as postmortem analysis of human fetal cell transplants to the putamen of PD patients shows expression of the receptor, as do human DA neurons grafts obtained from human fetal brain or differentiated hESCs. The experimental setup of this study (Figure 1A) was designed to allow for both the assessment of unperturbed therapeutic capacity of fetal DA neuroblasts after transplantation (TX) and for the assessment of chemogenetic activation (hM3Dq [Gq coupled] and rM3Ds [Gs coupled]) and silencing (KORD [Gi coupled]). The main activating DREADD combination, rM3Dq/hM3Ds, was selected to enable drive of the DA neurons with a simultaneous counteracting activity on the D2 autoreceptors. The Gi-coupled D2 receptor reduces intracellular cAMP when the synaptic DA concentration increases, with the result that the activation threshold for further release is increased. The activation of the hM3Ds actively counteracts this effect. The novel KORD receptor was matched with the hM3Dq to enable in vivo studies of bimodal regulation where one ligand could induce DA release (using CNO) and the other inhibit DA release (using salvinorin B, or SalB). These two groups, together with the rM3Ds/KORD group presented in Figure 6, enable us to compare the action of Gs- and Gq-coupled G protein activation in DA neurons. The DREADDs were specifically expressed in the mature DA neurons of the transplant through the induction of gene transcription using the Cre-loxP system. The Cre-recombinase was selectively expressed in the DA neurons of the graft through sourcing of TH-Cre ± fetal tissue from wild-type (WT) females bred with male TH-Cre homozygous knockin rats. The specificity of Cre expression was carefully examined in the adult TH-Cre rat to confirm that the Cre expression is restricted to only DA neurons in the ventral midbrain (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1B, available online). Unilateral grafting of fetal dopaminergic neurons into the striatum of 6-OHDA lesioned rats resulted in significant, yet partial, recovery in the stepping and cylinder motor performance tests (Figures 1D and 1E), as well as recovery in sensorimotor neglect and the typical overcompensation in amphetamine-induced rotations (Figures S1C and S1D). Selective expression of transgenes in the grafted DA neurons was efficiently achieved throughout the grafts using Cre-inducible AAV8 vectors injected in the centroid between the 3 × 2 μl transplant deposits (Figures 1F and 1G). Quantification of TH-positive dopaminergic neurons within the three graft tracts confirmed successful integration of a large number of graft-derived DA neurons into the host tissue, representing approximately 50% of the uninjured rat substantia nigra (SN) (Figures 1F and 1H). Graft-derived, dopaminergic projections (assessed specifically using the Cre-activated HA-tagged protein) were mainly localized to the striatum but were also found in the cerebral cortex and in the reverse direction along the medial forebrain bundle through the globus pallidus, with projections reaching as far as the SN (Figures 1G and S2A–S2E). Chemogenetic modulation of neuronal activity of the graft-derived TH neurons was achieved using three AAV8 vectors delivering the activation and inhibiting DREADD constructs in Cre-inducible (DIO, or double-floxed inverted orientation) expression cassettes. Histological analysis revealed that all three graft deposits could be transduced with a single stereotactic injection, achieving robust and highly specific transduction of TH-positive neurons of all three transgenes (Figures 1G, 1I, 1J, and S1E–S1L). The specificity and off-target function of this vector were evaluated in vivo in the striatum of WT rats without Cre expression (Figures 2A, 2B, S3A, and S3B) using both behavior test and postmortem analyses to confirm that both the vectors and the utilized ligands are biologically inert in the absence of Cre (Figures 6B and 6C). Of note is that the expression strength of the AAV-DIO-derived transgene does not correlate with TH (and thereby Cre) expression as it is driven by the pan-neuronal promoter Synapsin-1 and is strongly expressed also in DA neurons with TH levels very near the detection limit (Figures 2C–2E and S3C–S3H; Stuber et al., 2015Stuber G.D. Stamatakis A.M. Kantak P.A. Considerations when using cre-driver rodent lines for studying ventral tegmental area circuitry.Neuron. 2015; 85: 439-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The following AAV8 DREADD vectors were combined to allow for two types of bimodal regulation: Gq- and Gs-coupled activation using the same activating ligand (CNO, hM3Dq + rM3Ds, n = 11), or Gq-coupled activation using the CNO ligand and Gi-coupled inhibition using the novel orthogonal ligand SalB (hM3Dq + KORD, n = 13). In addition, the Gs was evaluated without the Gq (rM3Ds + KORD, n = 6), and a novel rat-codon-optimized, M4-based Gi DREADD was developed (increasing sequence homology from 90% to 98.2% without changes in the amino acid sequence) and utilized to evaluate the inhibitory function of the Gi on the function of the graft (rM4Di + eYFP, n = 6) (Figure 6). Both ligands CNO and SalB were confirmed to be otherwise biologically inert at the doses administered (Figures 2F, 6B, 6C, and S6). Local administration of CNO was able to produce a specific and repeatable DA release from the transplants of a peak amplitude similar to that of KCl (as measured by in vivo electrochemical detection methods) in animals receiving both vector mixes, but with slower reuptake rate (Figures 3A, 5D, S6B, and S6F). In animals receiving the hM3Dq + KORD combination, local administration of SalB 60 s before KCl injection could strongly suppress the KCl-induced DA release (Figures S6D and S6H). The inhibition was also rapid enough to preemptively terminate the Gq-mediated release, demonstrating in vivo bidirectional modulation (Figure 3B). Of note is that the recording of the DA release was performed at the centroid between the transplant deposits very close to the site of AAV injection to ensure that the release from terminals is recorded and that the highest fraction of transplanted DA neurons is transduced at the site of recording; i.e., a higher transduction rate is expected at the site of recording than that presented in Figure 1I. After systemic CNO administration, animals expressing the hM3Dq + rM3Ds combination displayed significantly improved motor performance in both the cylinder task and the stepping test in response to CNO, with some animals returning to prelesion levels (Figures 3D and 3F). In contrast, graft-induced recovery in these tests was abolished in animals with transduced hM3Dq + KORD grafts, following treatment with SalB, suppressing the therapeutic effect of the transplant entirely in the cylinder test and to a significant portion in the stepping test (Figures 3C and 3E), but not in the corridor test (Figures 3G and S4A). Interestingly, CNO treatment was sufficient to increase the performance in a complex sensorimotor integrative task, the disengage task that is earlier known to be only marginally improved by DA neuron grafts (Mandel et al., 1990Mandel R.J.

The therapeutic effect was measured as decreased response latency and was observed in both hM3Dq + rM3Ds and hM3Dq + KORD animals after CNO administration. During the acquisition of the behavior modulation data after CNO administration, hM3Dq + rM3Ds animals were observed to exhibit abnormal body posture, rotational locomotion, and spontaneous limb activity at the peak dose of CNO. hM3Dq + rM3Ds, but not hM3Dq + KORD, animals were found to display a significant and dose-dependent rotational bias away from the transplanted hemisphere (contralateral rotation) in response to CNO (Figures 4A and S4C). When observed in an unconstrained home-cage environment, the same treatment group displayed a broader spectrum of abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs), including both axial and orolingual repetitive movements, peaking around 60 min following CNO treatment and lasting for longer than 2 hr (Figures 4C and 5C ; Movie S1). Interestingly, neither the hM3Dq + KORD animals nor the lesion control animals developed any rotational behavior or AIMs in response to CNO. Thus, increase in cAMP, the principle intracellular activation mechanism of Gs-coupled G protein receptors, may be a critical mechanism behind GIDs. Indeed, when activating the graft by CNO-induced increase of cAMP using the rM3Ds DREADD alone, the rotational asymmetry was found to the same magnitude (Figure 6D).Figure 5Treatment with 5-HT6 Agonist ST-1936 Induces DA Release and GIDs through Direct Action on the Grafted DA NeuronsShow full caption(A) Rotational behavior following treatment of 5-HT agonists specifically targeting each of the three metabotropic, Gs-coupled, serotonin (5-HT) receptors, with 5-HT4 agonist BIMU8 (green) and 5-HT7 agonist AS19 (black) not inducing any rotational behavior, while 5-HT6 agonist ST-1936 (blue) induced a strong contralateral rotation in grafted hM3Dq + KORD animals (L-DOPA naive and not previously displaying GIDs on CNO), but not Lesion Ctrls (red).(B) Treatment with 5-HT6 agonist ST-1936 induced substantial AIMs in grafted hM3Dq + KORD animals (green) with only a weak, transient AIM score in Lesion Ctrls (red).(C) Comparison of the different manifestations of AIMs between treatments with CNO, apomorphine, and ST-1936.

To confirm that these findings were indeed due to presynaptic dysregulation and not postsynaptic receptor sensitivity, animals were treated with the DA agonist apomorphine. While the lesion control animals remained highly supersensitized to apomorphine in the ipsilateral striatum, both hM3Dq + rM3Ds and hM3Dq + KORD displayed significantly reduced rotational behavior and AIMs, consistent with graft-mediated reduction of postsynaptic receptor sensitivity (Figures 4B and 4D). As noted above, both clinical and preclinical evidence point to the serotonergic neurotransmission as an upstream event required for the maintenance of GIDs. However, the mechanism through which this activation is inducing dysplastic events via the graft remains elusive. Three of the seven families of serotonergic (5-HT) receptors present in the CNS are metabotropic and signal through the Gs cascade: 5-HT4, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7. Therefore, selective agonists toward these receptors were evaluated in the hM3Dq + KORD-treated animals, as they had yet to show any rotational asymmetry or AIMs. While the 5-HT4 (BIMU8) and 5-HT7 (AS19) agonist did not induce any rotational asymmetry, the selective 5HT-6 agonist ST-1936 induced both contralateral rotational behavior as well as AIMs very similar to that"
https://openalex.org/W2346728438,"The neuropeptide PDF promotes the normal sequencing of circadian behavioral rhythms in Drosophila, but its signaling mechanisms are not well understood. We report daily rhythmicity in responsiveness to PDF in critical pacemakers called small LNvs. There is a daily change in potency, as great as 10-fold higher, around dawn. The rhythm persists in constant darkness and does not require endogenous ligand (PDF) signaling or rhythmic receptor gene transcription. Furthermore, rhythmic responsiveness reflects the properties of the pacemaker cell type, not the receptor. Dopamine responsiveness also cycles, in phase with that of PDF, in the same pacemakers, but does not cycle in large LNv. The activity of RalA GTPase in s-LNv regulates PDF responsiveness and behavioral locomotor rhythms. Additionally, cell-autonomous PDF signaling reversed the circadian behavioral effects of lowered RalA activity. Thus, RalA activity confers high PDF responsiveness, providing a daily gate around the dawn hours to promote functional PDF signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2346441924,"Background Wasting and stunting are global public health problems that frequently co-exist. However, they are usually separated in terms of policy, guidance, programming and financing. Though both wasting and stunting are manifestations of undernutrition caused by disease and poor diet, there are critical gaps in our understanding of the physiological relationship between them, and how interventions for one may affect the other. The aim of this exercise was to establish research priorities in the relationships between wasting and stunting to guide future research investments. Methods and Findings We used the CHNRI (Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative) methodology for setting research priorities in health. We utilised a group of experts in nutrition, growth and child health to prioritise 30 research questions against three criteria (answerability, usefulness and impact) using an online survey. Eighteen of 25 (72%) experts took part and prioritised research directly related to programming, particularly at the public health level. The highest-rated questions were: “Can interventions outside of the 1000 days, e.g. pre-school, school age and adolescence, lead to catch-up in height and in other developmental markers?”; “What timely interventions work to mitigate seasonal peaks in both wasting and stunting?”; and “What is the optimal formulation of ready-to-use foods to promote optimal ponderal growth and also support linear growth during and after recovery from severe acute malnutrition?” There was a high level of agreement between experts, particularly for the highest ranking questions. Conclusions Increased commitment to rigorous evaluations of treatment and prevention interventions at the public health level, addressing questions of the timing of intervention, and the extent to which impacts for both wasting and stunting can be achieved, is needed to inform global efforts to tackle undernutrition and its consequences."
https://openalex.org/W2347123947,"Exposure to high-fat diet induces both, peripheral and central alterations in TLR4 expression. Moreover, functional TLR4 is required for the development of high-fat diet-induced obesity. Recently, central alterations in TLR4 expression have been associated with the modulation of visceral pain. However, it remains unknown whether there is a functional interaction between the role of TLR4 in diet-induced obesity and in visceral pain. In the present study we investigated the impact of long-term exposure to high-fat diet on visceral pain perception and on the levels of TLR4 and Cd11b (a microglial cell marker) protein expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. Peripheral alterations in TLR4 were assessed following the stimulation of spleenocytes with the TLR4-agonist LPS. Finally, we evaluated the effect of blocking TLR4 on visceral nociception, by administering TAK-242, a selective TLR4-antagonist. Our results demonstrated that exposure to high-fat diet induced visceral hypersensitivity. In parallel, enhanced TLR4 expression and microglia activation were found in brain areas related to visceral pain, the PFC and the hippocampus. Likewise, peripheral TLR4 activity was increased following long-term exposure to high-fat diet, resulting in an increased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Finally, TLR4 blockage counteracted the hyperalgesic phenotype present in mice fed on high-fat diet. Our data reveal a role for TLR4 in visceral pain modulation in a model of diet-induced obesity, and point to TLR4 as a potential therapeutic target for the development of drugs to treat visceral hypersensitivity present in pathologies associated to fat diet consumption."

Increasing the thermogenic activity of adipocytes holds promise as an approach to combating human obesity and related metabolic diseases. We identified induction of mouse PR domain containing 4 (Prdm4) by the small molecule butein as a means to induce expression of uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1), increase energy expenditure, and stimulate the generation of thermogenic adipocytes. This study highlights a Prdm4-dependent pathway, modulated by small molecules, that stimulates browning of white adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2345568447,"Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) are large Holarctic herbivores whose heterogeneous diet has led to the development of a unique gastrointestinal microbiota, essential for the digestion of arctic flora, which may include a large proportion of lichens during winter. Lichens are rich in plant secondary metabolites, which may affect members of the gut microbial consortium, such as the methane-producing methanogenic archaea. Little is known about the effect of lichen consumption on the rumen and cecum microbiotas and how this may affect methanogenesis in reindeer. Here, we examined the effects of dietary lichens on the reindeer gut microbiota, especially methanogens. Samples from the rumen and cecum were collected from two groups of reindeer, fed either lichens (Ld: n = 4), or a standard pelleted feed (Pd: n = 3). Microbial densities (methanogens, bacteria and protozoa) were quantified using quantitative real-time PCR and methanogen and bacterial diversities were determined by 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA genes. In general, the density of methanogens were not significantly affected (p>0.05) by the intake of lichens. Methanobrevibacter constituted the main archaeal genus (>95% of reads), with Mbr. thaueri CW as the dominant species in both groups of reindeer. Bacteria belonging to the uncharacterized Ruminococcaceae and the genus Prevotella were the dominant phylotypes in the rumen and cecum, in both diets (ranging between 16–38% total sequences). Bacteria belonging to the genus Ruminococcus (3.5% to 0.6%; p = 0.001) and uncharacterized phylotypes within the order Bacteroidales (8.4% to 1.3%; p = 0.027), were significantly decreased in the rumen of lichen-fed reindeer, but not in the cecum (p = 0.2 and p = 0.087, respectively). UniFrac-based analyses showed archaeal and bacterial libraries were significantly different between diets, in both the cecum and the rumen (vegan::Adonis: pseudo-F<0.05). Based upon previous literature, we suggest that the altered methanogen and bacterial profiles may account for expected lower methane emissions from lichen-fed reindeer."
https://openalex.org/W2346951338,"In this article we report a combined experimental and computational study concerning the effects of deuteration on the binding of histamine and two other histaminergic agonists to 3H-tiotidine-labeled histamine H2 receptor in neonatal rat astrocytes. Binding affinities were measured by displacing radiolabeled tiotidine from H2 receptor binding sites present on cultured neonatal rat astrocytes. Quantum-chemical calculations were performed by employing the empirical quantization of nuclear motion within a cluster model of the receptor binding site extracted from the homology model of the entire H2 receptor. Structure of H2 receptor built by homology modelling is attached in the supporting information (S1 Table) Experiments clearly demonstrate that deuteration affects the binding by increasing the affinity for histamine and reducing it for 2-methylhistamine, while basically leaving it unchanged for 4-methylhistamine. Ab initio quantum-chemical calculations on the cluster system extracted from the homology H2 model along with the implicit quantization of the acidic N–H and O–H bonds demonstrate that these changes in the binding can be rationalized by the altered strength of the hydrogen bonding upon deuteration known as the Ubbelohde effect. Our computational analysis also reveals a new mechanism of histamine binding, which underlines an important role of Tyr250 residue. The present work is, to our best knowledge, the first study of nuclear quantum effects on ligand receptor binding. The ligand H/D substitution is relevant for therapy in the context of perdeuterated and thus more stable drugs that are expected to enter therapeutic practice in the near future. Moreover, presented approach may contribute towards understanding receptor activation, while a distant goal remains in silico discrimination between agonists and antagonists based on the receptor structure."

Although previous studies have utilized geotagged photos to model travel patterns at individual locations, there is limited research on how these datasets can model international travel behavior and inter-country travel flows—a crucial indicator to quantify the interactions between countries in tourism economics. Realizing the necessity to investigate the potential of geotagged photos in tourism geography, this research investigates international travel patterns from two perspectives: 1) We apply a series of indicators (radius of gyration (ROG), number of countries visited, and entropy) to measure the descriptive characteristics of international travel in different countries; 2) By constructing a gravity model of trade, we investigate how distance decay influences the magnitude of international travel flow between geographic entities, and whether (or how much) the popularity of a given destination (defined as the percentage of tourist income in national gross domestic product (GDP)) affects travel choices in different countries. The results provide valuable input to various commercial applications such as individual travel planning and destination suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W2345402853,"Singing involves distinct respiratory kinematics (i.e. movements of rib cage and abdomen) to quiet breathing because of different demands on the respiratory system. Professional classical singers often advocate for the advantages of an active control of the abdomen on singing performance. This is presumed to prevent shortening of the diaphragm, elevate the rib cage, and thus promote efficient generation of subglottal pressure during phonation. However, few studies have investigated these patterns quantitatively and inter-subject variability has hindered the identification of stereotypical patterns of respiratory kinematics. Here, seven professional classical singers and four untrained individuals were assessed during quiet breathing, and when singing both a standard song and a piece of choice. Several parameters were extracted from respiratory kinematics and airflow, and principal component analysis was used to identify typical patterns of respiratory kinematics. No group differences were observed during quiet breathing. During singing, both groups adapted to rhythmical constraints with decreased time of inspiration and increased peak airflow. In contrast to untrained individuals, classical singers used greater percentage of abdominal contribution to lung volume during singing and greater asynchrony between movements of rib cage and abdomen. Classical singers substantially altered the coordination of rib cage and abdomen during singing from that used for quiet breathing. Despite variations between participants, principal component analysis revealed consistent pre-phonatory inward movements of the abdominal wall during singing. This contrasted with untrained individuals, who demonstrated synchronous respiratory movements during all tasks. The inward abdominal movements observed in classical singers elevates intra-abdominal pressure and may increase the length and the pressure-generating capacity of rib cage expiratory muscles for potential improvements in voice quality."

Here we used UT shear modulus measured using ultrasound shear wave elastography as an index of muscle stiffness/tension. The aims of this study were twofold: 1) to determine whether the UT muscle shear modulus is altered in athletes with rotator cuff tendinopathy compared to asymptomatic athletes, and 2) to detect optimal cut-off points of UT shear modulus in identifying athletes with rotator cuff tendinopathy. Forty-three male volleyball players (17 asymptomatic and 26 with rotator cuff tendinopathy, mean age = 22.9±3.5 years) participated in the study. UT shear modulus was quantified during active arm holding at 30° and 60° of shoulder abduction and passive arm positioning at 0°, 30° and 60° of shoulder abduction. During the active tasks, the UT shear modulus was higher in athletes with rotator cuff tendinopathy than the asymptomatic athletes (p = 0.002), regardless the arm position. During the passive tasks, athletes with rotator cuff tendinopathy exhibited a higher UT shear modulus than asymptomatic athletes only at 0° of shoulder abduction (13.0±2.5 kPa vs 10.2±1.8 kPa, p = 0.001). When considering the active task, an optimal cut-off shear modulus of 12.0 kPa at 30° of shoulder abduction (sensitivity = 0.84, specificity = 0.57, AUC = 0.757, p = 0.008) and 9.5 kPa at 60° of shoulder abduction (sensitivity = 0.88, specificity = 0.67, AUC = 0.816, p = 0.002) was detected. When considering the passive task at 0° of shoulder abduction, a cut-off of 12.2 kPa was found (sensitivity = 0.73, AUC = 0.817, p = 0.001). Findings from the present study show that monitoring passive and active UT muscle shear modulus may provide important information for the prevention/rehabilitation of rotator cuff tendinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2347110317,"Background Defining optimal routes for induction of mucosal immunity represents an important research priority for the HIV-1 vaccine field. In particular, it remains unclear whether mucosal routes of immunization can improve mucosal immune responses. Methods In this randomized two center phase I clinical trial we evaluated the systemic and mucosal immune response to a candidate HIV-1 Clade C CN54gp140 envelope glycoprotein vaccine administered by intramuscular (IM), intranasal (IN) and intravaginal (IVAG) routes of administration in HIV negative female volunteers. IM immunizations were co-administered with Glucopyranosyl Lipid Adjuvant (GLA), IN immunizations with 0.5% chitosan and IVAG immunizations were administered in an aqueous gel. Results Three IM immunizations of CN54 gp140 at either 20 or 100 μg elicited significantly greater systemic and mucosal antibodies than either IN or IVAG immunizations. Following additional intramuscular boosting we observed an anamnestic antibody response in nasally primed subjects. Modest neutralizing responses were detected against closely matched tier 1 clade C virus in the IM groups. Interestingly, the strongest CD4 T-cell responses were detected after IN and not IM immunization. Conclusions These data show that parenteral immunization elicits systemic and mucosal antibodies in women. Interestingly IN immunization was an effective prime for IM boost, while IVAG administration had no detectable impact on systemic or mucosal responses despite IM priming.

https://openalex.org/W2346087495,"High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most common and deadliest form of ovarian cancer. Yet it is largely asymptomatic in its initial stages. Studying the origin and early progression of this disease is thus critical in identifying markers for early detection and screening purposes. Tissue-based mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) can be employed as an unbiased way of examining localized metabolic changes between healthy and cancerous tissue directly, at the onset of disease. In this study, we describe MSI results from Dicer-Pten double-knockout (DKO) mice, a mouse model faithfully reproducing the clinical nature of human HGSC. By using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) for the unsupervised analysis of desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) datasets, tissue regions are segregated based on spectral components in an unbiased manner, with alterations related to HGSC highlighted. Results obtained by combining NMF with DESI-MSI revealed several metabolic species elevated in the tumor tissue and/or surrounding blood-filled cyst including ceramides, sphingomyelins, bilirubin, cholesterol sulfate, and various lysophospholipids. Multiple metabolites identified within the imaging study were also detected at altered levels within serum in a previous metabolomic study of the same mouse model. As an example workflow, features identified in this study were used to build an oPLS-DA model capable of discriminating between DKO mice with early-stage tumors and controls with up to 88% accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2346572636,"Several models have been studied on predictive epidemics of arthropod vectored plant viruses in an attempt to bring understanding to the complex but specific relationship between the three cornered pathosystem (virus, vector and host plant), as well as their interactions with the environment. A large body of studies mainly focuses on weather based models as management tool for monitoring pests and diseases, with very few incorporating the contribution of vector’s life processes in the disease dynamics, which is an essential aspect when mitigating virus incidences in a crop stand. In this study, we hypothesized that the multiplication and spread of tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) in a crop stand is strongly related to its influences on Frankliniella occidentalis preferential behavior and life expectancy. Model dynamics of important aspects in disease development within TSWV-F. occidentalis-host plant interactions were developed, focusing on F. occidentalis’ life processes as influenced by TSWV. The results show that the influence of TSWV on F. occidentalis preferential behaviour leads to an estimated increase in relative acquisition rate of the virus, and up to 33% increase in transmission rate to healthy plants. Also, increased life expectancy; which relates to improved fitness, is dependent on the virus induced preferential behaviour, consequently promoting multiplication and spread of the virus in a crop stand. The development of vector–based models could further help in elucidating the role of tri-trophic interactions in agricultural disease systems. Use of the model to examine the components of the disease process could also boost our understanding on how specific epidemiological characteristics interact to cause diseases in crops. With this level of understanding we can efficiently develop more precise control strategies for the virus and the vector."

https://openalex.org/W2345686518,"The study aimed to investigate the effect of fatigue on static and dynamic postural stability after completing a mountain ultra-marathon. Twelve male athletes participated in the study. Postural stability was assessed before and immediately after the race. Static postural stability was evaluated on a dynamometric platform with eyes opened (OE) and closed (CE). Dynamic postural stability was assessed with OE on an instrumented plate which allowed medio-lateral oscillations. Stabilometric data were affected by fatigue in the OE condition, concerning sway path velocity (p = 0.0006), sway area velocity (p = 0.0006), area of the confidence ellipse (p = 0.0016), maximal anterior-posterior (AP) (p = 0.0017) and medio-lateral (ML) (p = 0.0039) oscillations. In the CE condition the sway path velocity (p = 0.0334), the maximal ML oscillations (p = 0.0161) and the area of the confident ellipse (p = 0.0180) were also negatively influenced. Stabilogram diffusion analysis showed in the OE condition an increase of short-term diffusion coefficients considering the anterior-posterior direction (Dfys; p = 0.0023) and the combination of the two (Dfr2s; p = 0.0032). Equally, long term diffusion coefficients increased considering the anterior-posterior direction (Dfyl; p = 0.0093) and the combination of the two (Dfr2l; p = 0.0086). In CE condition greater values were detected for medio-lateral direction (Dfxl; p = 0.033), anterior-posterior direction (Dfyl; p = 0.0459) and the combination of the two (Dfr2l; p = 0.0048). The dynamic postural stability test showed an increase of the time spent with the edges of the plate on the floor (p = 0.0152). Our results showed that mountain ultra-marathon altered static stability more than dynamic stability. An involvement of cognitive resources to monitor postural stability after fatiguing could be the explanation of the worsening in the automatic task (quiet standing) and of the positive compensation in the less automatic task (dynamic standing on the instrumented plate)."

Inflation of reported fresh ART cycle live birth rates was assessed for all age groups of infertile women as the difference between fresh cycle live births with reference to number of initiated fresh cycles (excluding embryo banking cycles), as typically reported by the CDC, and fresh cycle live births with reference to total initiated fresh ART cycles (including embryo banking cycles).During 2013, out of 121,351 fresh non-donor ART cycles 27,564 (22.7%) involved embryo banking. The proportion of banking cycles increased with female age from 15.5% in women <35 years to 56.5% in women >44 years. Concomitantly, the proportion of thawed cycles decreased with advancing female age (P <0.0001). Exclusion of embryo banking cycles led to inflation of live birth rates in fresh ART cycles, increasing in size in parallel to advancing female age and utilization of embryo banking, reaching 56.3% in women age >44. The inflation of live birth rates in thawed cycles could not be calculated from the publically available CDC data but appears to be even greater.Utilization of embryo banking increased during 2013 with advancing female age, suggesting a potential age selection bias. Exclusion of embryo banking cycles from national ART outcome reports significantly inflated national ART success rates, especially among older women.Exclusion of embryo banking cycles from US National Assisted Reproductive Technology outcome reports significantly inflates reported success rates especially in older women."
https://openalex.org/W2346380226,"Neural interfaces which allow long-term recordings in deep brain structures in awake freely moving animals have the potential of becoming highly valuable tools in neuroscience. However, the recording quality usually deteriorates over time, probably at least partly due to tissue reactions caused by injuries during implantation, and subsequently micro-forces due to a lack of mechanical compliance between the tissue and neural interface. To address this challenge, we developed a gelatin embedded neural interface comprising highly flexible electrodes and evaluated its long term recording properties. Bundles of ultrathin parylene C coated platinum electrodes (N = 29) were embedded in a hard gelatin based matrix shaped like a needle, and coated with Kollicoat™ to retard dissolution of gelatin during the implantation. The implantation parameters were established in an in vitro model of the brain (0.5% agarose). Following a craniotomy in the anesthetized rat, the gelatin embedded electrodes were stereotactically inserted to a pre-target position, and after gelatin dissolution the electrodes were further advanced and spread out in the area of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). The performance of the implanted electrodes was evaluated under anesthesia, during 8 weeks. Apart from an increase in the median-noise level during the first 4 weeks, the electrode impedance and signal-to-noise ratio of single-units remained stable throughout the experiment. Histological postmortem analysis confirmed implantation in the area of STN in most animals. In conclusion, by combining novel biocompatible implantation techniques and ultra-flexible electrodes, long-term neuronal recordings from deep brain structures with no significant deterioration of electrode function were achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2345736096,"While most biological materials are insulating in nature, efficient extracellular electron transfer is a critical property of biofilms associated with microbial electrochemical systems and several microorganisms are capable of establishing conductive aggregates and biofilms. Though construction of these conductive microbial networks is an intriguing and important phenomenon in both natural and engineered systems, few studies have been published related to conductive biofilms/aggregates and their conduction mechanisms, especially in mixed-species environments. In the present study, current-producing mixed species biofilms exhibited high conductivity across non-conductive gaps. Biofilm growth observed on the inactive electrode contributed to overall power outputs, suggesting that an electrical connection was established throughout the biofilm assembly. Electrochemical gating analysis of the biofilms over a range of potentials (-600-200 mV, vs. Ag/AgCl) resulted in a peak-manner response with maximum conductance of 3437 ± 271 μS at a gate potential of -360 mV. Following removal of the electron donor (acetate), a 96.6% decrease in peak conductivity was observed. Differential responses observed in the absence of an electron donor and over varying potentials suggest a redox driven conductivity mechanism in mixed-species biofilms. These results demonstrated significant differences in biofilm development and conductivity compared to previous studies using pure cultures."
https://openalex.org/W2346383048,"Seed oils provide a renewable source of food, biofuel and industrial raw materials that is important for humans. Although many genes and pathways for acyl-lipid metabolism have been identified, little is known about whether there is a specific mechanism for high-oil content in high-oil plants. Based on the distinct differences in seed oil content between four high-oil dicots (20~50%) and three low-oil grasses (<3%), comparative genome, transcriptome and differential expression analyses were used to investigate this mechanism. Among 4,051 dicot-specific soybean genes identified from 252,443 genes in the seven species, 54 genes were shown to directly participate in acyl-lipid metabolism, and 93 genes were found to be associated with acyl-lipid metabolism. Among the 93 dicot-specific genes, 42 and 27 genes, including CBM20-like SBDs and GPT2, participate in carbohydrate degradation and transport, respectively. 40 genes highly up-regulated during seed oil rapid accumulation period are mainly involved in initial fatty acid synthesis, triacylglyceride assembly and oil-body formation, for example, ACCase, PP, DGAT1, PDAT1, OLEs and STEROs, which were also found to be differentially expressed between high- and low-oil soybean accessions. Phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct differences of oleosin in patterns of gene duplication and loss between high-oil dicots and low-oil grasses. In addition, seed-specific GmGRF5, ABI5 and GmTZF4 were predicted to be candidate regulators in seed oil accumulation. This study facilitates future research on lipid biosynthesis and potential genetic improvement of seed oil content."
https://openalex.org/W2346163531,"Purpose There have been conflicting reports regarding the association of perioperative blood transfusion (PBT) with oncologic outcomes including recurrence rates and survival outcomes in prostate cancer. We aimed to evaluate whether perioperative blood transfusion (PBT) affects biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) following radical prostatectomy (RP) for patients with prostate cancer. Materials and Methods A total of 2,713 patients who underwent RP for clinically localized prostate cancer between 1993 and 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. We performed a comparative analysis based on receipt of transfusion (PBT group vs. no-PBT group) and transfusion type (autologous PBT vs. allogeneic PBT). Univariate and multivariate Cox-proportional hazard regression analysis were performed to evaluate variables associated with BRFS, CSS, and OS. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate survival estimates for BRFS, CSS, and OS, and log-rank test was used to conduct comparisons between the groups. Results The number of patients who received PBT was 440 (16.5%). Among these patients, 350 (79.5%) received allogeneic transfusion and the other 90 (20.5%) received autologous transfusion. In a multivariate analysis, allogeneic PBT was found to be statistically significant predictors of BRFS, CSS, and OS; conversely, autologous PBT was not. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed significantly decreased 5-year BRFS (79.2% vs. 70.1%, log-rank, p = 0.001), CSS (98.5% vs. 96.7%, log-rank, p = 0.012), and OS (95.5% vs. 90.6%, log-rank, p < 0.001) in the allogeneic PBT group compared to the no-allogeneic PBT group. In the autologous PBT group, however, none of these were statistically significant compared to the no-autologous PBT group. Conclusions We found that allogeneic PBT was significantly associated with decreased BRFS, CSS, and OS. This provides further support for the immunomodulation hypothesis for allogeneic PBT."
https://openalex.org/W2346548265,"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, a gram-negative bacterium, has increasingly emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen. It is well-known for resistance to a variety of antimicrobial agents including cationic antimicrobial polypeptides (CAPs). Resistance to polymyxin B, a kind of CAPs, is known to be controlled by the two-component system PhoPQ. To unravel the role of PhoPQ in polymyxin B resistance of S. maltophilia, a phoP mutant was constructed. We found MICs of polymyxin B, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin and spectinomycin decreased 2-64 fold in the phoP mutant. Complementation of the phoP mutant by the wild-type phoP gene restored all of the MICs to the wild type levels. Expression of PhoP was shown to be autoregulated and responsive to Mg2+ levels. The polymyxin B and gentamicin killing tests indicated that pretreatment of low Mg2+ can protect the wild-type S. maltophilia from killing but not phoP mutant. Interestingly, we found phoP mutant had a decrease in expression of SmeZ, an efflux transporter protein for aminoglycosides in S. maltophilia. Moreover, phoP mutant showed increased permeability in the cell membrane relative to the wild-type. In summary, we demonstrated the two-component regulator PhoP of S. maltophilia is involved in antimicrobial susceptibilities and low Mg2+ serves as a signal for triggering the pathway. Both the alteration in membrane permeability and downregulation of SmeZ efflux transporter in the phoP mutant contributed to the increased drug susceptibilities of S. maltophilia, in particular for aminoglycosides. This is the first report to describe the role of the Mg2+-sensing PhoP signaling pathway of S. maltophilia in regulation of the SmeZ efflux transporter and in antimicrobial susceptibilities. This study suggests PhoPQ TCS may serve as a target for development of antimicrobial agents against multidrug-resistant S. maltophilia."
https://openalex.org/W2346533236,"Background Migrant sex workers are often highly marginalized and disproportionately experience health and social inequities, including high prevalence of HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and human rights violations. In recent years, research involving migrant sex workers has increased, yet many knowledge gaps remain regarding how best to protect research participant rights and welfare. Our objective was to identify key challenges and opportunities related to the responsible conduct of HIV research with migrant sex workers. Methods Focus groups and interviews conducted with 33 female sex workers ≥18 years old at the Guatemala-Mexico border from June 2013–February 2014 were analyzed. Participants were recruited through community outreach by a local HIV prevention organization to sex work establishments such as bars, hotels, street corners, and truck stops. Results Key themes influencing research engagement for migrant sex workers included researcher mistrust and fear related to research participation, rooted in the social isolation frequently faced by recent migrants; intersecting concerns related to immigration status, fear of criminalization, and compliance with sex work regulations; and perceived benefits and risks of HIV/STI testing for migrants (e.g., immigration implications, stigma) represent potential barriers and opportunities for the responsible conduct of research involving migrant sex workers. Conclusions Results highlight the intersection between the human rights vulnerabilities of migrant sex workers and barriers to research participation, including social isolation of migrants and policy/legal barriers related to immigration and sex work. Findings illustrate the need for researchers to develop population-tailored procedures to address fears related to immigration and criminalization, and to reinforce positive and non-stigmatizing relationships with migrant sex workers. Community-led efforts to reduce stigma and foster community organization and supports for migrant sex workers are recommended, as are broader policy shifts that move away from punitive legal approaches towards approaches that safeguard and prioritize the human rights of migrant sex workers."
https://openalex.org/W2345939851,"The topsoil around Beijing metropolis, China, is experiencing impacts of rapid urbanization, intensive farming, and extensive industrial emissions. We analyzed the concentrations of Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, Cd, and Cr from 87 topsoil samples in the pre-rainy season and 115 samples in the post-rainy season. These samples were attributed to nine land use types: forest, grass, shrub, orchard, wheat, cotton, spring maize, summer maize, and mixed farmland. The pollution index (PI) of heavy metals was calculated from the measured and background concentrations. The ecological risk index (RI) was assessed based on the PI values and toxic-response parameters. The results showed that the mean PI values of Pb, Cr, and Cd were > 1 while those of Cu, Ni, and Zn were < 1. All the samples had low ecological risk for Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, and Cr while only 15.35% of samples had low ecological risk for Cd. Atmospheric transport rather than land use factors best explained the seasonal variations in heavy metal concentrations and the impact of atmospheric transport on heavy metal concentrations varied according to the heavy metal types. The concentrations of Cu, Cd, and Cr decreased from the pre- to post-rainy season, while those of Ni, Pb, and Zn increased during this period. Future research should be focused on the underlying atmospheric processes that lead to these spatial and seasonal variations in heavy metals. The policymaking on environmental management should pay close attention to potential ecological risks of Cd as well as identifying the transport pathways of different heavy metals."
https://openalex.org/W2345476744,"Objective To investigate the impact of pre-operative deep brain stimulation (DBS) interdisciplinary assessments on post-operative hospitalizations and quality of life (QoL). Background DBS has been utilized successfully in Parkinson’s disease (PD) for the treatment of tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, off time, and motor fluctuations. Although DBS is becoming a more common management approach there are no standardized criteria for selection of DBS candidates, and sparse data exist to guide the use of interdisciplinary evaluations for DBS screening. We reviewed the outcomes of the use of an interdisciplinary model which utilized seven specialties to pre-operatively evaluate potential DBS candidates. Methods The University of Florida (UF) INFORM database was queried for PD patients who had DBS implantations performed at UF between January 2011 and February 2013. Records were reviewed to identify unintended hospitalizations, falls, and infections. Minor and major concerns or reservations from each specialty were previously documented and quantified. Clinical outcomes were assessed through the use of the Parkinson disease quality of life questionnaire (PDQ-39), and the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Score (UPDRS) Part III. Results A total of 164 cases were evaluated for possible DBS candidacy. There were 133 subjects who were approved for DBS surgery (81%) following interdisciplinary screening. There were 28 cases (21%) who experienced an unintended hospitalization within the first 12 months following the DBS operation. The patients identified during interdisciplinary evaluation with major or minor concerns from any specialty service had more unintended hospitalizations (93%) when compared to those without concerns (7%). When the preoperative “concern” shifted from “major” to “minor” to “no concerns,” the rate of hospitalization decreased from 89% to 33% to 3%. A strong relationship was uncovered between worsened PDQ-39 at 12 months and increased hospitalization. Conclusions Unintended hospitalizations and worsened QOL scores correlated with the number and severity of concerns raised by interdisciplinary DBS evaluations. The data suggest that detailed screenings by interdisciplinary teams may be useful for more than just patient selection. These evaluations may help to stratify risk for post-operative hospitalization and QoL outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2345584873,"The voltage- and Ca2+-activated, large conductance K+ channel (BK, maxi-K) is expressed in the collecting duct system of kidney where it underlies flow- and Ca2+-dependent K+ excretion. To determine if other Ca2+-activated K+ channels (KCa) may participate in this process, mouse kidney and the K+-secreting mouse cortical collecting duct (CCD) cell line, mCCDcl1, were assessed for TRPV4 and KCa channel expression and cross-talk. qPCR mRNA analysis and immunocytochemical staining demonstrated TRPV4 and KCa expression in mCCDcl1 cells and kidney connecting tubule (CNT) and CCD. Three subfamilies of KCa channels were revealed: the high Ca2+-binding affinity small-conductance SK channels, SK1and SK3, the intermediate conductance channel, IK1, and the low Ca2+-binding affinity, BK channel (BKα subunit). Apparent expression levels varied in CNT/CCD where analysis of CCD principal cells (PC) and intercalated cells (IC) demonstrated differential staining: SK1:PC<IC, and SK3:PC>IC, IK1:PC>IC, BKα:PC = IC, and TRPV4:PC>IC. Patch clamp analysis and fluorescence Ca2+ imaging of mCCDcl1 cells demonstrated potent TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ entry and strong functional cross-talk between TRPV4 and KCa channels. TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ influx activated each KCa channel, as evidenced by selective inhibition of KCa channels, with each active KCa channel enhancing Ca2+ entry (due to membrane hyperpolarization). Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) analysis of confluent mCCDcl1 cells grown on permeable supports further demonstrated this cross-talk where TRPV4 activation induce a decrease in TEER which was partially restored upon selective inhibition of each KCa channel. It is concluded that SK1/SK3 and IK1 are highly expressed along with BKα in CNT and CCD and are closely coupled to TRPV4 activation as observed in mCCDcl1 cells. The data support a model in CNT/CCD segments where strong cross talk between TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ influx and each KCa channel leads to enhance Ca2+ entry which will support activation of the low Ca2+-binding affinity BK channel to promote BK-mediated K+ secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2346219856,"Computational modeling of tertiary structures has become of standard use to study proteins that lack experimental characterization. Unfortunately, 3D structure prediction methods and model quality assessment programs often overlook that an ensemble of conformers in equilibrium populates the native state of proteins. In this work we collected sets of publicly available protein models and the corresponding target structures experimentally solved and studied how they describe the conformational diversity of the protein. For each protein, we assessed the quality of the models against known conformers by several standard measures and identified those models ranked best. We found that model rankings are defined by both the selected target conformer and the similarity measure used. 70% of the proteins in our datasets show that different models are structurally closest to different conformers of the same protein target. We observed that model building protocols such as template-based or ab initio approaches describe in similar ways the conformational diversity of the protein, although for template-based methods this description may depend on the sequence similarity between target and template sequences. Taken together, our results support the idea that protein structure modeling could help to identify members of the native ensemble, highlight the importance of considering conformational diversity in protein 3D quality evaluations and endorse the study of the variability of the native structure for a meaningful biological analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2346667261,"Mammalian S100B protein plays multiple important roles in cellular brain processes. The protein is a clinically used marker for several pathologies including brain injury, neurodegeneration and cancer. High levels of S100B released by astrocytes in Down syndrome patients are responsible for reduced neurogenesis of neural progenitor cells and induction of cell death in neurons. Despite increasing understanding of S100B biology, there are still many questions concerning the detailed molecular mechanisms that determine specific activities of S100B. Elevated overexpression of S100B protein is often synchronized with increased nitric oxide-related activity. In this work we show S100B is a target of exogenous S-nitrosylation in rat brain protein lysate and identify endogenous S-nitrosylation of S100B in a cellular model of astrocytes. Biochemical studies are presented indicating S-nitrosylation tunes the conformation of S100B and modulates its Ca2+ and Zn2+ binding properties. Our in vitro results suggest that the possibility of endogenous S-nitrosylation should be taken into account in the further studies of in vivo S100B protein activity, especially under conditions of increased NO-related activity."
https://openalex.org/W2345875780,"Studies in global androgen receptor knockout (G-ARKO) and orchidectomised mice suggest that androgen accelerates reperfusion of the ischaemic hindlimb by stimulating angiogenesis. This investigation used novel, vascular cell-specific ARKO mice to address the hypothesis that the impaired hindlimb reperfusion in G-ARKO mice was due to loss of AR from cells in the vascular wall.Mice with selective deletion of AR (ARKO) from vascular smooth muscle cells (SM-ARKO), endothelial cells (VE-ARKO), or both (SM/VE-ARKO) were compared with wild type (WT) controls. Hindlimb ischaemia was induced in these mice by ligation and removal of the femoral artery. Post-operative reperfusion was reduced in SM-ARKO and SM/VE-ARKO mice. Immunohistochemistry indicated that this was accompanied by a reduced density of smooth muscle actin-positive vessels but no change in the density of isolectin B4-positive vessels in the gastrocnemius muscle. Deletion of AR from the endothelium (VE-ARKO) did not alter post-operative reperfusion or vessel density. In an ex vivo (aortic ring culture) model of angiogenesis, AR was not detected in vascular outgrowths and angiogenesis was not altered by vascular ARKO or by exposure to dihydrotestosterone (DHT 10(-10)-10(-7)M; 6 days).These results suggest that loss of AR from vascular smooth muscle, but not from the endothelium, contributes to impaired reperfusion in the ischaemic hindlimb of G-ARKO. Impaired reperfusion was associated with reduced collateral formation rather than reduced angiogenesis."

This study was conducted to investigate the potential role of circulating CgA in monitoring clinical response in Chinese patients with advanced GEP-NETs. Eighty patients with advanced GEP-NETs treated in Peking University Cancer Hospital from September 2011 to May 2014 and 65 healthy individuals were included in this study. Serum CgA levels were analyzed for relationship with patient’s baseline characteristics and clinical outcome. Median CgA levels were significantly higher in patients with advanced GEP-NETs than in healthy individuals (93.8 ng/mL vs. 37.1 ng/mL; P<0.01), as well as significantly higher in patients with carcinoid syndrome or liver metastasis than in those without carcinoid syndrome (298.8 ng/mL vs. 82.9 ng/mL; P = 0.011) or liver metastasis (137.0 ng/mL vs. 64.4 ng/mL; P = 0.023). A CgA cutoff value of 46.2 ng/mL was used in this study with a sensitivity of 78.8% and specificity of 73.8%. Patients with CgA levels higher than 46.2 ng/mL had a worse prognosis than patients with CgA levels lower than 46.2 ng/mL (P = 0.045). Notably, a weak correlation was observed between changes in serum CgA levels and clinical response to the IP regimen as well as SSAs. Our data also indicate that serum CgA could be a useful indicator of patient prognosis though there is more research required in order to validate such claims."
https://openalex.org/W2345582711,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that attacks myelinated axons in the central nervous system. Induction of oral tolerance is a potent mechanism to prevent autoimmunity. The food yeast Candida utilis was used to test the therapeutic potential of oral tolerance induction in an animal model of human multiple sclerosis (MS). We constructed a C. utilis strain, which displays a fusion peptide composed of the encephalitogenic MOG35-55 peptide and the C. utilis Gas1 cell wall protein on its surface.By immunizing mice with MOG35-55 peptide experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in a mouse model. Feeding of mice with C. utilis that expresses MOG35-55 peptide on its surface was started seven days prior to immunization and was continued for ten days. Control animals were treated with wild-type fungus or left untreated. Untreated mice developed first clinical symptoms ten days post immunization (p. i.) with an ascending paralysis reaching maximal clinical disability at day 18 to 20 p. i.. Treatment with the wild-type strain demonstrated comparable clinical symptoms. In contrast, oral gavage of MOG35-55-presenting fungus ameliorated the development of EAE. In addition, incidence as well as maximal clinical disease severity were significantly reduced. Interestingly, reduction of disease severity also occurred in animals treated with heat-inactivated C. utilis cells indicating that tolerance induction was independent of fungal viability. Better disease outcome correlated with reduced demyelination and cellular inflammation in the spinal cord, lower T cell proliferation against rechallenge with MOG35-55 and more regulatory T cells in the lymph nodes. Our data demonstrate successful that using the food approved fungus C. utilis presenting the immunogenic MOG35-55 peptide on its surface induced an oral tolerance against this epitope in EAE. Further studies will reveal the nature and extent of an anti-inflammatory environment established by the treatment that prevents the development of an autoimmune disorder affecting the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2345346188,"Global inactivation of Trbp, a regulator of miRNA pathways, resulted in developmental defects and postnatal lethality in mice. Recently, we showed that cardiac-specific deletion of Trbp caused heart failure. However, its functional role(s) in skeletal muscle has not been characterized. Using a conditional knockout model, we generated mice lacking Trbp in the skeletal muscle. Unexpectedly, skeletal muscle specific Trbp mutant mice appear to be phenotypically normal under normal physiological conditions. However, these mice exhibited impaired muscle regeneration and increased fibrosis in response to cardiotoxin-induced muscle injury, suggesting that Trbp is required for muscle repair. Using cultured myoblast cells we further showed that inhibition of Trbp repressed myoblast differentiation in vitro. The impaired myogenesis is associated with reduced expression of muscle-specific miRNAs, miR-1a and miR-133a. Together, our study demonstrated that Trbp participates in the regulation of muscle differentiation and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2346659298,"Here, we investigate induction of immunological tolerance by lentiviral based gene therapy in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis, collagen II-induced arthritis (CIA). Targeting the expression of the collagen type II (CII) to antigen presenting cells (APCs) induced antigen-specific tolerance, where only 5% of the mice developed arthritis as compared with 95% of the control mice. In the CII-tolerized mice, the proportion of Tregs as well as mRNA expression of SOCS1 (suppressors of cytokine signaling 1) increased at day 3 after CII immunization. Transfer of B cells or non-B cell APC, as well as T cells, from tolerized to naïve mice all mediated a certain degree of tolerance. Thus, sustainable tolerance is established very early during the course of arthritis and is mediated by both B and non-B cells as APCs. This novel approach for inducing tolerance to disease specific antigens can be used for studying tolerance mechanisms, not only in CIA but also in other autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2345370840,"Clinical cohorts with time-to-event endpoints are increasingly characterized by measurements of a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms that is by a magnitude larger than the number of measurements typically considered at the gene level. At the same time, the size of clinical cohorts often is still limited, calling for novel analysis strategies for identifying potentially prognostic SNPs that can help to better characterize disease processes. We propose such a strategy, drawing on univariate testing ideas from epidemiological case-controls studies on the one hand, and multivariable regression techniques as developed for gene expression data on the other hand. In particular, we focus on stable selection of a small set of SNPs and corresponding genes for subsequent validation. For univariate analysis, a permutation-based approach is proposed to test at the gene level. We use regularized multivariable regression models for considering all SNPs simultaneously and selecting a small set of potentially important prognostic SNPs. Stability is judged according to resampling inclusion frequencies for both the univariate and the multivariable approach. The overall strategy is illustrated with data from a cohort of acute myeloid leukemia patients and explored in a simulation study. The multivariable approach is seen to automatically focus on a smaller set of SNPs compared to the univariate approach, roughly in line with blocks of correlated SNPs. This more targeted extraction of SNPs results in more stable selection at the SNP as well as at the gene level. Thus, the multivariable regression approach with resampling provides a perspective in the proposed analysis strategy for SNP data in clinical cohorts highlighting what can be added by regularized regression techniques compared to univariate analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2346975023,"We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of seven hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing strategies in blood donors.Three of the seven strategies were based on HCV diagnosis and reporting guidelines in Mexico and four were from previous and current recommendations outlined by the CDC. The strategies that were evaluated determine antibody levels according to the signal-to-cut-off (S/CO) ratio and use reflex Immunoblot (IMB) or HCV RNA tests to confirm true positive (TP) cases of chronic HCV infection. Costs were calculated from the perspective of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS). A decision tree model was developed to estimate the expected number of true positive cases and costs for the base-case scenarios and for the sensitivity analyses.Base-case findings indicate an extended dominance of the CDC-USA2 and CDC-USA4 options by the IMSS Mexico3 and IMSS-Mexico1 alternatives. The probabilistic sensitivity analyses results suggest that for a willingness-to-pay (WTP) range of $0-9,000 USD the IMSS-Mexico1 strategy is the most cost-effective of all strategies ($5,000 USD per TP). The IMSS-Mexico3, IMSS-Mexico2, and CDC-USA3 strategies are also cost-effective strategies that cost between $7,800 and $8,800 USD per TP case detected. The CDC-USA1 strategy was very expensive and not cost-effective.HCV antibody testing strategies based on the classification of two or three levels of the S/CO are cost-effective procedures to identify patients who require reflex IMB or HCV RNA testing to confirm chronic HCV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2345633141,"Neuronal responses to sensory stimuli or neuronal responses related to behaviour are often extracted by averaging neuronal activity over large number of experimental trials. Such trial-averaging is carried out to reduce noise and to diminish the influence of other signals unrelated to the corresponding stimulus or behaviour. However, if the recorded neuronal responses are jittered in time with respect to the corresponding stimulus or behaviour, averaging over trials may distort the estimation of the underlying neuronal response. Temporal jitter between single trial neural responses can be partially or completely removed using realignment algorithms. Here, we present a measure, named difference of time-averaged variance (dTAV), which can be used to evaluate the performance of a realignment algorithm without knowing the internal triggers of neural responses. Using simulated data, we show that using dTAV to optimize the parameter values for an established parametric realignment algorithm improved its efficacy and, therefore, reduced the jitter of neuronal responses. By removing the jitter more effectively and, therefore, enabling more accurate estimation of neuronal responses, dTAV can improve analysis and interpretation of the neural responses."
