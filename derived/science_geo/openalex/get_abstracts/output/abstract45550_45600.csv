https://openalex.org/W2079200533,"The primary patterning event in early vertebrate development is the formation of the mesoderm and its subsequent induction of the neural tube. Classic experiments suggest that the vegetal region signals the animal hemisphere to diverge from the pathway of forming ectoderm to form mesoderm such as muscle. Here we show that bovine basic FGF has a limited capacity to induce muscle actin expression in animal hemisphere cells. This level of expression can be raised to levels normally induced in the embryo by another mammalian growth factor, TGF-β, which by itself will not induce actin expression. We show that the Xenopus embryo contains an mRNA encoding a protein highly homologous to basic FGF. These results together with the identification of a maternal mRNA with strong homology to TGF-β, suggest that molecules closely related to FGF and TGF-β are the natural inducers of mesoderm in vertebrate development."
https://openalex.org/W2089543118,"We report that Vg1, a maternal mRNA localized to the vegetal hemisphere of frog eggs, encodes a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family of proteins. Furthermore, we show that Vg1 mRNA is distributed to presumptive endodermal cells after fertilization. Previous studies had shown that the vegetal end of a frog egg produces a signal that induces the overlying animal pole cells to form mesodermal tissue. More recently it has been shown that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and TGF-beta can participate in the induction of muscle. Together, these results lead us to propose that the formation of mesoderm during frog development is specified by the products of localized maternal mRNAs, including Vg1."

To determine the basis for this effect, we have examined the levels of mRNAs corresponding to fibronectin and alpha 2(I) procollagen in NRK-49 rat fibroblasts and L6E9 rat myoblasts treated with TGF-beta 1. TGF-beta 1 increased severalfold the levels of mRNAs for both proteins. The kinetics of this effect were similar for both mRNA species. The increase in fibronectin and alpha 2(I) procollagen mRNAs was detectable 2 h after addition of TGF-beta 1 to the cells and their maximal levels remained constant for several days. Actinomycin D, but not cycloheximide, inhibited the increase in fibronectin and alpha 2(I) procollagen mRNA levels induced by TGF-beta 1. The results indicate that TGF-beta 1 controls the composition and abundance of extracellular matrices at least in part by inducing a coordinate increase in the levels of fibronectin and type I collagen mRNAs."

https://openalex.org/W2120261738,"The specificity of casein kinase II has been further defined by analyzing the kinetics of phosphorylation reactions using a number of different synthetic peptides as substrates. The best peptide substrates are those in which multiple acidic amino acids are present on both sides of the phosphorylatable serine or threonine. Acidic residues on the NH2-terminal side of the serine (threonine) greatly enhance the kinetic constants but are not absolutely required. Acidic residues on the COOH-terminal side of the serine (threonine) are absolutely required. One position for which the occupation of an acidic residue is especially critical is the position located 3 residues to the COOH terminus of the phosphate acceptor site, although the presence of an acidic amino acid in the positions that are 4 or 5 residues removed may also provide an appropriate structure that will serve as a substrate for the kinase. Aspartate serves as a better amino acid determinant than glutamate. A relatively short sequence of amino acids surrounding the phosphate acceptor site appears to serve as the basis for the specificity of casein kinase II. The peptides in this study were also assayed with casein kinase I and the casein kinase from the mammary gland so that the specificities of these kinases could be compared to that of casein kinase II."
https://openalex.org/W2140443312,"We have identified in mice an allele of a new T cell receptor V beta gene, V beta 17a, whose product is bound by the monoclonal antibody KJ23a. Over 90% of T cell hybridomas prepared from V beta 17a+ T cells of SWR mice respond to allogeneic forms of the IE class II MHC protein, indicating that V beta 17a has an appreciable affinity for IE regardless of the other components of the T cell receptor. These results suggest a bias in the germ-line T cell receptor repertoire toward recognition of MHC proteins and indicate that the V beta portion of the receptor may form the most important contact points with MHC ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1977797997,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) can stimulate or inhibit growth of cells in vitro, as well as induce the transformed phenotype. Although widely distributed in animal tissue, the effects of TGF-beta in vivo are largely unknown, and a physiological role for the peptide hormone has not been demonstrated. The effect of TGF-beta on developing epithelial tissue in situ was studied by using slow-release plastic pellets containing TGF-beta to treat developing mouse mammary gland. Powerful inhibition of mammary growth and morphogenesis was observed. This growth-inhibited mammary tissue was histologically normal, and the inhibitory effect was fully reversible. Under the conditions of these experiments, TGF-beta displayed many of the characteristics expected of a physiologically active growth-regulatory molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1582095946,"The double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (p68 kinase) from interferon-treated human cell is a Mr 68,000 protein induced by interferon. By the use of a specific monoclonal antibody, we have been able to study the two distinct protein kinase activities characteristic of purified p68 kinase. The first activity is functional for endogenous phosphorylation of the enzyme (p68 kinase), whereas the second one is responsible for the phosphorylation of exogenous substrates such as eukaryotic initiation factor 2 and histone. When activated by dsRNA in the presence of Mn2+ and ATP, p68 kinase is autophosphorylated and is then capable of catalyzing phosphorylation of histone in the absence of dsRNA. Whereas binding of 8-azido-[alpha-32P] ATP (8-N3ATP) to p68 kinase is dependent on both dsRNA and Mn2+, phosphorylated p68 kinase binds 8-N3ATP independent of dsRNA. This is consistent with a dsRNA requirement for the autophosphorylation of p68 kinase, but not for the phosphorylation of exogenous substrates. p68 kinase is mainly associated with the ribosomal pellet. It could be recovered efficiently by a buffer containing both high salt and a nonionic detergent. Synthesis of p68 kinase is induced several-fold by interferon in different types of human cells. Partial proteolysis of [35S]methionine and an 8-N3ATP-labeled p68 kinase preparation by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease indicated the presence of a major Mr 48,000 polypeptide (p48) with a specific ATP-binding site. p48 probably contains the catalytic unit of p68 kinase and is analogous to a similar protein which we have previously described as a distinct protein present in a complexed form with p68 kinase. We now believe that the presence of p48 in previously purified kinase preparations was due to partial degradation of p68 kinase."

In most transgenic mice bearing this gene construct, massive tumors involving all the pancreatic acinar cells develop within a few days of pancreatic differentiation. Expression of the normal c-H-ras proto-oncogene in acinar cells leads to more subtle anomalies, but no tumors develop. Thus modest amounts of the mutant ras proteins are sufficient, in an otherwise normal genetic background, to lead to neoplastic transformation of differentiating pancreatic acinar cells. In contrast, a comparable elastase-myc construct produces no pancreatic tumors in transgenic mice."
https://openalex.org/W1576923208,"A fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, acetoxymethyl Quin2, was used to quantify changes in the cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) of confluent mouse osteoblasts. 1,25 - Dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25 - (OH)2D3, 10-100 pM), 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-(OH)D3, 10-100 nM), parathyroid hormone (PTH(1-84), 0.1-10 nM), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2, 10-1000 nM) all induced immediate (t less than 15 s) transient increases in [Ca2+]i, from a basal level of 135 +/- 8 nM to levels of 179-224 nM. These increases rapidly returned to a plateau approximately 10% higher than the basal level. 24,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol (24,25-(OH)2D2, 0.1-10 nM) induced a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i which remained elevated for 5 min before decreasing. The 1,25-(OH)2D3- and PTH-induced spikes were abolished by the prior addition of EGTA and Ca2+ entry blockers (verapamil, nifedipine, 1 microM) while the responses to 25-(OH)D3, 24,25-(OH)2D3, and PGE2 were unaffected. Addition of 1,25-(OH)2D3 + EGTA or PTH + EGTA caused enhanced Ca efflux. Addition of drugs which interfere with calcium sequestration by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (caffeine, 4 mM; 8-(diethyl-amino)-octyl 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate HCl, 0.5 mM) or mitochondria (antimycin, 10 microM; oligomycin, 5 microM) showed that 25-(OH)D3 and PGE2 mainly mobilized Ca2+ from ER. 1,25-(OH)2D3 and bovine PTH caused a transient increase in [Ca2+]i, 70% of which resulted from Ca2+ influx from outside the cells and 30% by release from the ER. The [Ca2+]i increase induced by 24,25-(OH)2D3 included a 30% contribution from the ER and 70% from the mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2069836703,"Genetic engineering is a powerful means of accelerating the evolution of new biological activities and has considerable potential for constructing microorganisms that can degrade environmental pollutants. Critical enzymes from five different catabolic pathways of three distinct soil bacteria have been combined in patchwork fashion into a functional ortho cleavage route for the degradation of methylphenols and methylbenzoates. The new bacterium thereby evolved was able to degrade and grow on mixtures of chloro- and methylaromatics that were toxic even for the bacteria that could degrade the individual components of the mixtures. Except for one enzymatic step, the pathway was fully regulated and its component enzymes were only synthesized in response to the presence of pathway substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1497236662,"The demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity of 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (N3dThd) against the infectivity and the cytopathic effect of human immunodeficiency virus has prompted an investigation of the mechanism by which this nucleoside analogue permeates the cell membrane. As with the transport of thymidine, the influx of N3dThd into human erythrocytes and lymphocytes was nonconcentrative during short incubation times (less than 5 min) which did not allow significant metabolism of this nucleoside. However, in contrast with thymidine transport, the initial velocity of N3dThd influx was strictly a linear function of nucleoside concentration (0.5-10 mM), without evidence of saturability; insensitive to micromolar concentrations of potent inhibitors of nucleoside transport (dipyridamole, 6-[(4-nitrobenzyl)thio]-9-beta-D-ribofuranosylpurine, and dilazep); insensitive to a 1000-fold excess of other nucleosides (thymidine, uridine, 2-chloroadenosine); and relatively insensitive to temperature, with Q10 values (37-27 degrees C) of 1.4 and 2.7 for N3dThd and thymidine, respectively, determined in erythrocytes. Although the above results indicate that N3dThd permeates the cell membrane chiefly by nonfacilitated diffusion and not via the nucleoside transporter, millimolar concentrations of this nucleoside analogue were observed to inhibit both zero-trans influx of thymidine and efflux of thymidine from [3H]thymidine-loaded erythrocytes. The partition coefficients (1-octanol:0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) of N3dThd and thymidine were determined to be 1.26 and 0.064, respectively. The unusual ability of N3dThd to diffuse across cell membranes independently of the nucleoside transport system may be attributed to the considerable lipophilicity imparted to this molecule by the replacement of the 3′-hydroxyl group of thymidine with an azido moiety."

https://openalex.org/W1544997431,"It has recently been proposed that degradation products of sphingolipids may serve as physiologic inhibitors of protein kinase C. The present study was performed to determine the effect of 1,2-diacylglycerols and phorbol esters, known activators of protein kinase C, on sphingomyelin metabolism. 1,2-Dioctanoylglycerol (diC8) caused time- and concentration-dependent reduction in the level of sphingomyelin labeled to equilibrium with [3H]choline. diC8 (200 micrograms/ml) reduced [3H]sphingomyelin to 81 +/- 3% of control (p less than 0.005) by 15 min, and the level was 58 +/- 5% of control after 1 h; an EC50 for this event was 56 micrograms/ml. To evaluate the mechanisms of stimulated hydrolysis, the sphingoid base backbone of sphingomyelin was labeled with [14C] serine, and the effects of diC8 were quantitated. diC8 (100 micrograms/ml) reduced the level of sphingomyelin to 66 +/- 7% of control by 1 h from 375 +/- 12 pmol/10(6) cells to 245 +/- 26 pmol/10(6) cells. There was a concomitant increase in ceramide from 89 +/- 4 pmol/10(6) cells to 252 +/- 27 pmol/10(6) cells consistent with activation of the enzyme, sphingomyelinase (EC 3.1.4.12). In support of this contention, 1,2-diacylglycerols appeared to enhance the activity of an acid, but not a neutral, sphingomyelinase in homogenates of GH3 cells. The 1,2-diacylglycerol, 1-oleyl-2-acetylglycerol, produced similar effects. In contrast, the phorbol esters, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, failed to stimulate sphingomyelin hydrolysis. Further, these effects of the 1,2-diacylglycerols occurred in cells down-modulated for protein kinase C. These studies demonstrate that 1,2-diacylglycerols stimulate sphingomyelin hydrolysis by a mechanism independent of the protein kinase C which mediates phorbol ester action. This is the first report of stimulated sphingomyelin hydrolysis by a physiologic effector molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1539709480,"The location of the active site of membrane-bound factor Xa relative to the phospholipid surface was determined both in the presence and absence of factor Va using fluorescence energy transfer. Factor Xa was reacted with 5-(dimethylamino)-1-naphthalenesulfonyl- glutamylglycylarginyl(DEGR) chloromethyl ketone to yield DEGR-Xa, an analogue of factor Xa with a fluorescent dye attached covalently to the active site. When DEGR-Xa was titrated with phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine vesicles containing octadecylrhodamine, fluorescence energy transfer was observed between the donor dyes in the active sites of the membrane-bound enzymes and the acceptor dyes at the outer surface of the phospholipid bilayer. Based on the dependence of the efficiency of singlet-singlet energy transfer upon the acceptor density and assuming kappa 2 = 2/3, the distance of closest approach between the active site probe and the surface of the phospholipid bilayer averaged 61 A in the absence of factor Va and 69 A in the presence of factor Va. These direct measurements show that the active site of factor Xa is located far above the membrane surface. Also, association of factor Xa with factor Va on the membrane surface to form the prothrombinase complex results in a substantial movement of the active site of the enzyme relative to the membrane surface. The 5-(dimethylamino)-1-naphthalenesulfonyl emission in the complete prothrombinase complex was distinct from that in any other combination of components. It therefore appears that the optimum conformation of the prothrombinase active site is achieved only when factor Va, Ca2+, and a membrane surface interact simultaneously with factor Xa. Thus, in addition to its previously demonstrated ability to stimulate factor Xa binding to membranes, factor Va, upon association with factor Xa on a phospholipid surface, allosterically induces a particular active site conformation in factor Xa and also positions the active site at the correct distance above the membrane for prothrombin activation."
https://openalex.org/W1550056485,"Abstract In GC cells, a growth hormone-producing rat pituitary cell line, 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (L-T3) rapidly stimulates the transcription rate of the growth hormone gene which parallels the level of chromatin-associated L-T3-receptor complexes (Yaffe, B. M., and Samuels, H. H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 6284-6291). In this study we have functionally mapped the elements of the gene which are involved in mediating basal and hormone-regulated expression. Stable transformation studies indicate that transcriptional regulation of the gene by L-T3 is mediated by sequences in the 5'-flanking region. Transient expression studies were performed using a series of chimeric plasmids in which 5'-flanking DNA was ligated to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Transient expression occurred only in cells which expressed the endogenous growth hormone gene. Sequences between -104 and +7 were found to be essential for basal expression. One of the most highly conserved regions (-105 to -145) contains elements which further enhance the level of basal expression but are not necessary for regulated expression by L-T3. DNA between -210 and -181 was found to be essential for stimulation by L-T3 and was shown to function most efficiently with the homologous rat growth hormone promoter (-104 to +7). Sequences from -206 to -198 show about 80% homology with a sequence in the 5'-flanking region of two other rat genes which are regulated by thyroid hormone. Glucocorticoid hormones, which also transcriptionally stimulate the rat growth hormone gene, elicited only minimal effects in both stable and transient expression studies. This suggests that the elements which mediate glucocorticoid regulation of the endogenous gene are found either upstream of the cloned 5'-flanking region (1800 base pairs) or 3' of the cap site."

https://openalex.org/W2043829695,"In a variety of human genetic diseases, replacement of the absent or defective protein provides significant therapeutic benefits. As a model for a somatic cell gene therapy system, cultured murine fibroblasts were transfected with a human growth hormone (hGH) fusion gene and cells from one of the resulting clonal lines were subsequently implanted into various locations in mice. Such implants synthesized and secreted hGH, which was detectable in the serum. The function of the implants depended on their location and size, and on the histocompatibility of the donor cells with their recipients. The expression of hGH could be modified by addition of regulatory effectors, and, with appropriate immunosuppression, the implants survived for more than 3 months. This approach to gene therapy, here termed ""transkaryotic implantation,"" is potentially applicable to many genetic diseases in that the transfected cell line can be extensively characterized prior to implantation, several anatomical sites are suitable for implantation, and regulated expression of the gene of therapeutic interest can be obtained."
https://openalex.org/W1595226323,"The complete amino acid sequence of human type beta 2 transforming growth factor (hTGF-beta 2) was determined by automated Edman degradation of S-pyridylethylated hTGF-beta 2 and selected fragments. Cleavage of hTGF-beta 2 by enzymatic and chemical techniques established all the fragments in an unambiguous sequence. Human TGF-beta 2 consists of two disulfide-linked, identical subunits. Each hTGF-beta 2 subunit is a single-chain polypeptide of 112 residues, with a calculated molecular weight of 12,720. Human TGF-beta 2 displays 71.4% sequence homology with the functionally related human TGF-beta 1, and is distantly related (23-40% amino acid identity) to porcine inhibins and activins, the carboxyl-terminal regions of human Mullerian inhibiting substance, and the putative decapentaplegic gene complex protein of Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1604269314,"Nitrogenase is composed of two separately purified proteins called the Fe protein and the MoFe protein. In Azotobacter vinelandii the genes encoding these structural components are clustered and ordered: nifH (Fe protein)-nifD (MoFe protein alpha subunit)-nifK (MoFe protein beta subunit). The MoFe protein contains an ironmolybdenum cofactor (FeMo cofactor) whose biosynthesis involves the participation of at least five gene products, nifQ, nifB, nifN, nifE, and nifV. In this study an A. vinelandii mutant strain, which contains a defined deletion within the nifH (Fe protein) gene, was isolated and studied. This mutant is still able to accumulate significant amounts of MoFe protein subunits. However, extracts of this nifH deletion strain have only very low levels of MoFe protein acetylene reduction activity. Fully active MoFe protein can be reconstituted by simply adding isolated FeMo cofactor to the extracts. Fe protein is not necessary to stabilize or insert this preformed FeMo cofactor into the FeMo cofactor-deficient MoFe protein synthesized by the nifH deletion strain. Extracts of the nifH deletion strain can carry out molybdate and ATP-dependent in vitro FeMo cofactor biosynthesis provided Fe protein is added, demonstrating that they contain the products encoded by the FeMo cofactor biosynthetic genes. These data demonstrate that the Fe protein is physically required for the biosynthesis of FeMo cofactor in A. vinelandii."
https://openalex.org/W1517296610,"We have established the generality of using detergents for facilitating the reactivation of 6 M guanidinium chloride-denatured rhodanese that was recently described for the nonionic detergent lauryl maltoside (LM) (Tandon, S., and Horowitz, P. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 15615-15618). We report here that not only LM but other nonionic as well as ionic and zwitterionic detergents also have favorable effects in reactivating the denatured enzyme. Not all detergents are useful, and the favorable effects occur over a limited concentration range. Above and below that range there is little or no effect. Zwittergents, which represent a homologous series with varying critical micelle concentrations (CMCs) are effective only above their CMCs. Induction phases occur in the progress curves of rhodanese refolded in the presence of the effective detergents, suggesting the presence of refolding intermediates that are apparently stabilized by detergent interactions. Gel filtration chromatography of rhodanese with and without LM suggests that even though the renaturation of the denatured enzyme requires detergent at concentrations above its CMC, the enzyme does not bind an amount of detergent equivalent to a micelle. It is suggested that renaturation of other proteins might also be assisted by inclusion of nondenaturing detergents, although the optimal conditions will have to be determined for each individual case."

https://openalex.org/W1594164433,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is composed of homologous polypeptide chains, termed A and B, that are expressed as mitogenically active A-A, B-B, or A-B dimers. Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated that PDGF B chain mRNA expression is stimulated in microvascular endothelial cells by phorbol esters (PMA), thrombin, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and blocked by agents that elevate cyclic AMP (cAMP). Here we report the first evidence that the expression of A chain mRNA is also regulated in these cells. PDGF A chain mRNA levels were increased 5-25-fold by phorbol esters, thrombin, and TGF-beta. Transcripts of four different sizes were induced. The increase in A chain mRNA stimulated by TGF-beta was more prolonged (peak 4 h, duration 48 h) than the increase stimulated by PMA and thrombin (peak 4 h, duration 8 h). Among the agents known to increase B chain mRNA levels, PMA was most efficacious, followed in decreasing order by thrombin and TGF-beta. However, for A chain mRNA induction by these same agents, the order was reversed; TGF-beta was most efficacious, followed in decreasing order by thrombin and PMA. Agents that elevate cyclic AMP, known to block induction of B chain mRNA, blocked A chain induction by thrombin but had less effect on A chain mRNA induced by TGF-beta. Thus PDGF A chain mRNA levels are regulated by the same agents that regulate B chain mRNA levels in microvascular endothelial cells. While the changes in A chain mRNA are qualitatively similar to the changes in B chain mRNA in microvascular endothelial cells, there are differences in the relative efficacies of these agents in the regulation of PDGF A and B chain genes. These differences suggest that the forms of PDGF produced by endothelial cells depend on the nature of the inducing stimulus."

https://openalex.org/W1489202660,"The apolipoproteins of trout plasma lipoproteins have been characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-glycerol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The high density lipoproteins (HDL) (1.085 less than d less than 1.21 g/ml) contain four apolipoproteins, two major species with Mr 25,000 (apoA-I-like) and Mr 13,000 (apoA-II-like) and two minor species (Mr 55,000 and 40,500). The very low density (d less than 1.015 g/ml) and low density lipoproteins (1.015 less than d less than 1.085 g/ml) contain two high Mr apolipoproteins (apoB-like) with Mr 260,000 and 240,000 (the smaller is the preponderant species in low density lipoproteins), as well as a third apolipoprotein with Mr 76,000. Type A apolipoproteins are present in the very low density lipoproteins, as are a group of apolipoproteins with Mr 9,000-11,000 (apoC-like). Egg yolk proteins appear in the plasma of females about 30 days after natural ovulation or after that induced by salmon gonadotropin and during massive intraovarian atresias, either spontaneous or induced by 17 alpha,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one. Two egg yolk proteins intimately associated with HDL have been identified. They may account for as much as 35% of total plasma proteins. Lipovitellin (Mr 112,000) is composed of two subunits in a 1:1 molar ratio (lipovitellin 1 with Mr 92,000 and lipovitellin 2 with Mr 20,000) and is present as a dimer with another yolk protein (Mr 10,000). These results show that resorption of the yolk during follicular atresia in an oviparous vertebrate is correlated with the presence of egg yolk proteins combined with HDL in the plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1520207758,"In this study the relationship between cell binding of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) and induction of differentiation by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) was examined. Binding of [3H]PDBu increased within 12 h of 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment, and a 60-130% increase in [3H]PDBu receptor levels was observed within 24 h. By 48 h, however, [3H]PDBu binding was not different from control. Scatchard analysis of [3H]PDBu binding showed no statistical differences in Kd value (Kd approximately equal to 30 nM) between 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated and control cells 22 h post-treatment; however, a 2-fold increase in Bmax was observed in treated (338 +/- 24 pmol/10(9) cells) compared to control cultures (170 +/- 14 pmol/10(9) cells). Stimulation of [3H]PDBu binding was dependent on 1,25-(OH)2D3 concentrations over a range of 1-100 nM. Homogenates from 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated HL-60 cells also demonstrated an increase (70%) in [3H]PDBu binding to the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme protein kinase C as assessed by incubation of cell homogenates with [3H]PDBu in the presence of saturating phosphatidylserine and calcium concentrations. This suggests that the increase in [3H]PDBu binding cannot be entirely explained by modulation of the latter two agents. Cycloheximide (5 microM), an inhibitor of protein synthesis, ablated the 1,25-(OH)2D3-stimulated increase in [3H]PDBu binding to intact HL-60 cells. These data demonstrate that an increase in [3H]PDBu binding occurs early in the course of 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced differentiation, results from an increased number of [3H]PDBu-binding site, and is dependent on protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2081239940,"Cell fusion experiments have implicated positive or negative regulatory factors in the cell type--specific expression of specialized endogenous genes. The inability to readily manipulate such genes has prevented characterization of the cis-acting DNA sequences that interact with these factors. A transfection-fusion technique, which combined stable gene transfer and formation of transient heterokaryons, was used to study this class of factors and their DNA binding sites. Messenger RNA directed by a quiescent, rat prolactin promoter region stably transferred into mouse fibroblasts was detected only after fusion to rat pituitary cells, implying that pituitary cells contain a positive cell type--specific factor or factors. Nuclear run-on assays showed that fusion activation is transcriptional. Fusion did not activate either a stably transferred rat growth hormone gene promoter or expression of the endogenous silent fibroblast prolactin or growth hormone genes. Analysis by 5'-deletion mutation identified a 30-base pair DNA sequence required for cell fusion activation of the rat prolactin promoter region. Comparison with previous results from direct cellular transfer of this region implies that transfection-fusion identifies novel regulatory DNA sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2079375464,"To test the functional capacity of a fission yeast chromosome in mouse cells, a strain of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, ED628 Int5, was constructed. A plasmid bearing the SV2NEO gene, which can confer G418 resistance to mouse cells, was integrated at the ura4 locus on S. pombe chromosome III. S. pombe Int5 chromosomes were introduced into mouse C127 cells by PEG-facilitated protoplast fusion. Here we describe two independent G418-resistant cell lines with distinct growth characteristics, F1.1 and F7.1, and examine the structure of material derived from S. pombe Int5 chromosome III in these lines. F1.1 is shown to contain a single rearranged block of chromatin from S. pombe chromosome III integrated into a mouse chromosome, maintained in the absence of selection. In contrast, the data for F7.1 are consistent with the presence of linear, unintegrated copies of S. pombe chromosome III, which are apparently intact and maintained in an unstable but autonomous state. The unstable maintenance of this chromosome may be due to defective centromere function leading to missegregation at mitosis or to over- or underreplication."
https://openalex.org/W2028486587,"The ribonucleocapsids of many plant viruses are extremely stable. The protein coat protects the RNA genome against degradation during the accumulation and spread of progeny virions. Chimeric single-stranded RNA molecules were transcribed in vitro from recombinant plasmids and later encapsidated, in vitro, into ribonucleoprotein particles (pseudoviruses) 60 nanometers long that resembled tobacco mosaic virus. Transcripts encoding an assayable enzyme, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), were packaged into pseudovirus particles to assess the utility of this single-stranded RNA delivery system in a wide range of cell types. In all cases, packaged CAT messenger RNA was uncoated and transiently expressed. Significantly higher levels of CAT activity were detected with packaged than with naked CAT messenger RNA after inoculation of plant protoplasts in the presence of polyethylene glycol or abrasive inoculation of intact leaf surfaces. Structural events that lead to the uncoating and expression of CAT messenger RNA showed no cell specificity. This observation may support the view that the comparatively restricted host range of a true plant virus results from events that occur later during the infection cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1568091461,"Using the [3H]inositol-labeled plasma membranes isolated from the differentiated human leukemic (HL-60) cells, the mode of inhibitory action of the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme protein kinase C in the chemotactic peptide, fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP)-induced, phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of phosphoinositides was investigated. In this cell-free membrane system, fMLP in the presence of GTP plus Ca2+, GTP in the presence of Ca2+, or Ca2+ alone could induce the formation of inositol bis- and trisphosphate (IP2 and IP3, respectively). When the intact cells were pre-treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, the fMLP- and GTP-induced formation of IP2 and IP3 was markedly reduced but the Ca2+-induced reactions were not reduced in the isolated membranes. This result suggests that protein kinase C impairs the coupling of the GTP-binding protein to the phospholipase C. In another experiment, preincubation of the isolated membranes with pure rat brain protein kinase C inhibited the fMLP-induced formation of IP2, but did not inhibit the GTP- or Ca2+-induced reaction. Under the same conditions, protein kinase C did not inhibit the fMLP-, GTP-, or Ca2+-induced formation of IP3. This result suggests that protein kinase C impairs additionally the coupling of the fMLP receptor to the GTP-binding protein leading to the formation of IP2. The reason for the failure of protein kinase C to inhibit the fMLP-induced formation of IP3 in the cell-free membrane system is unknown, but several possible mechanisms are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1539901397,"It has previously been demonstrated that rabbit tracheal epithelial cells in primary culture undergo terminal differentiation at confluence to yield cornified cells much in analogy to epidermal keratinocytes and that one biochemical marker of this process seems to be the accumulation of cholesterol sulfate by the cells. The current work addresses the possible causes of this accumulation. Our studies show that the stimulation of cholesterol sulfate is paralleled by an increased activity of the biosynthetic enzyme cholesterol sulfotransferase. Squamous differentiated cells exhibited 20- to 30- fold higher levels of this enzyme activity than that in undifferentiated cells. As with other markers of squamous cell differentiation, the increase in cholesterol sulfotransferase can be prevented by the inclusion of retinoids in the cell culture medium. Inhibition of sulfotransferase levels can be observed at concentration of retinoic acid as low as 10(-11) M. The enzyme activity is optimal at pH 7 in buffers containing 0.2 M NaCl and 0.01% Triton X-100. Apparent Michaelis constants for the substrates 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate and cholesterol are 1 microM and 0.6 mM, respectively. Our results indicate that the increase in cholesterol sulfotransferase is the proximate cause for the accumulation of cholesterol sulfate in rabbit tracheal epithelial cells during squamous cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1587498598,"We have investigated the regulation of ferritin synthesis during induction of Friend erythroleukemic cells by dimethyl sulfoxide. Northern blot analysis shows that mouse ferritin H and L mRNAs each contain approximately 1.1 kilobases. The levels of both mRNAs increase after addition of dimethyl sulfoxide in a biphasic manner. After a sharp rise in the first 6 h, the levels decline and then rise again over the next 90 h. These increases in mRNA levels reflect increased transcription of both mRNAs. Analysis of ferritin subunit synthesis surprisingly showed no corresponding increase in the rate of protein synthesis, suggesting that the additional mRNA was not in functional polysomes. These studies also indicated a novel processing of mouse ferritin H subunits. H subunits appear to be synthesized as a precursor of approximately 22,500. This form is not present in mature shells. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that the precursor is first processed to an intermediate form of 20,000 and then to the 18,000 component found in functional shells."
https://openalex.org/W2052507379,"There is much speculation about fragile sites on human chromosomes predisposing to specific chromosome rearrangements seen in cancer. Acute myelomonocytic leukemia is characterized by neoplastic chromosome rearrangements involving band 16q22 in patients who carry the rare fragile site at 16q22. This specific leukemic breakpoint is within the metallothionein gene cluster, which is here shown to be proximal to the rare fragile site (FRA16B) and to a common fragile site (FRA16C) in this region. Hence neither of these fragile sites are at the breakpoint in this leukemic chromosomal rearrangement."
https://openalex.org/W1533932716,"Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induces time-dependent changes in protein kinase C subcellular distribution and enzymatic activity in the human osteosarcoma cell line SaOS-2. Short (less than 60 min) incubations with PMA caused decreased cytosolic enzyme activity and a concomitant increase in particulate protein kinase; after 3 h, particulate protein kinase C activity also declined to reach less than 10% of basal activity by 24 h (Krug, E., and Tashjian, Jr., A. H., (1987) Cancer Res. 47, 2243-2246). In order to determine whether the loss in enzyme activity was due to decreased enzyme protein, Western blot analyses were performed using a polyclonal antibody against protein kinase C raised in rabbits. This approach confirmed the previously reported time-related changes: 80-kDa immunoreactive protein kinase C initially translocated from the cytosol to the particulate cell fraction and later disappeared completely from the particulate fraction. Loss of protein kinase C enzymatic activity thus results from actual loss of the 80-kDa protein; we found no evidence for generation of a calcium/phospholipid-independent protein kinase C-like form of the enzyme. Membrane association was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments using [35S]methionine-labeled cells. Brief exposure to PMA caused a marked loss in the [35S]methionine-labeled cytosolic protein kinase C band and an increase in the labeled particulate band. Protein kinase C immunoprecipitated from cells treated with PMA for 14 h displayed an increase in [35S]methionine label despite a greater than 80% loss of enzyme activity. The high specific radioactivity of the remaining 80-kDa protein leads us to conclude that long term treatment with PMA causes an increase in the rate of protein kinase C synthesis accompanied by a still greater increase in the rate of enzyme degradation in SaOS-2 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1557510721,"The transferrin receptor is a target protein for phosphorylation by activated intracellular protein kinase C (May, W. S., Sahyoun, N., Jacobs, S., Wolf, M., and Cuatrecasas, P. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 9419-9426). Recently we reported that the potent tumor-promoting agent phorbol diester or a synthetic diacylglycerol could mediate rapid down-regulation of the surface transferrin receptor in association with receptor phosphorylation in HL60 leukemic cells and suggested that this phosphorylation may provide a signal for receptor internalization. In this communication we have tested experimentally the predictions generated by the hypothesis that receptor phosphorylation may play such a role in the intracellular cycling of the transferrin receptor. Results indicate that phorbol diester-stimulated phosphorylation occurs stoichiometrically only on the surface-oriented receptor and precedes internalization. Using a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C, it was found that both phorbol diester-mediated receptor phosphorylation and down-regulation could be antagonized. While the mechanism of internalization of the phosphorylated receptor is not clear, phorbol diester treatment significantly increases the rate constant for endocytosis from 0.183 to 0.462 min-1, while inhibiting only slightly the rate constant for exocytosis of the internalized receptor from 0.113 to 0.079 min-1. Thus, we conclude that phorbol diester treatment affects intracellular cycling of receptors and establishes a new steady state distribution of surface and intracellular receptors. These data support a role for receptor phosphorylation as a trigger for internalization primarily by stimulating the process of transferrin receptor endocytosis while affecting the subsequent exocytosis of the receptor cycling only slightly."
https://openalex.org/W1483564414,"Abstract Rhodanese is oxidatively inactivated by several reagents, some of which are not normally considered oxidants. Rhodanese, in a form not containing persulfide sulfur (E), was inactivated by phenylglyoxal under conditions where disulfides are formed. There was the concomitant increase in the fluorescence of the apolar probe 1,1'-bi(4-anilino)naphthalene-5,5'-disulfonic acid (bisANS). At 0.2 mg/ml protein, there was no turbidity, while at 1 mg/ml, turbidity formed after an induction period of 23 min. Phenylglyoxal-inactivated E was extensively digested by endoproteinase glutamate C (V8 protease) to give two discrete high molecular weight fragments (Mr = 29,500 and 16,000). Enzymatically active E or ES, the form of rhodanese containing transferred sulfur (Mr = 33,000) was totally refractory to V8 protease and gave only small fluorescent enhancement of bisANS. Phenylglyoxal inactivated ES (reaction at arginine) gave very little fluorescence enhancement of bisANS and was not digested by V8. Hydrogen peroxide rapidly inactivated E (t1/2 less than 2 min) giving a slow increase in bisANS fluorescence (t1/2 greater than 10 min) identical to that observed with phenylglyoxal. The turbidity also increased after an induction period of approximately 30 min. Inactivation of E by hydrogen peroxide gave the same digestion pattern as that observed with phenylglyoxal inactivation. The turbidity was associated with the formation of disulfide-bonded structures that formed with the stoichiometry of E, 2E, 4E, 6E, 8E, etc. relative to the native enzyme, E. E was inactivated with several other reagents that lead to oxidatively inactivated rhodanese including NADH, dithiothreitol, mercaptoethanol, and m-dinitrobenzene. Enzyme inactivated with dithiothreitol or NADH gave an identical digestion pattern as above. In addition, with the exception of NADH which could not be used due to optical interference, each of the reagents gave rise to increased fluorescence of bisANS after inactivation. The results are consistent with a model in which the oxidized rhodanese resulting from diverse treatments is in a new conformation that has extensive exposed apolar surfaces and can form both noncovalent and disulfide-bonded aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W1532630389,"Limited tryptic digestion of protein kinase C purified from mouse brain generated a 36-kDa fragment which no longer required Ca2+ and phospholipid for activity or bound phorbol ester. Under appropriate conditions, the isolated fragment was stable for several months at 4 degrees C or upon freezing and storage at −70 degrees C. Kinetic characteristics of the fragment were similar to those for the intact protein kinase. Although the fragment did not require phospholipid for activity, anionic phospholipids affected the extent of its activity in a pH-, substrate-, and substrate concentration-dependent manner. This effect appeared to be due to complex formation between the phospholipid and substrate. The catalytic fragment thus permits detection of a second point of interaction of phospholipid with the protein kinase C system in addition to the already described phospholipid regulatory domain."
https://openalex.org/W1486150542,"Nitrogenase was isolated and purified from wild-type and a tungsten-resistant mutant (LM2) of Azotobacter vinelandii strain OP derepressed on medium containing 1-10 mM W. While the enzyme from the wild-type strain contained the polypeptides of the conventional enzyme, metal analysis of component 1 demonstrated the existence of one atom each of molybdenum and tungsten. Furthermore, the ESR spectrum of this protein contained three signals, two of which originated from S = 3/2 spin states. One of these signals is nearly identical to that of the conventional MoFe-protein while the other is hypothesized to originate from a W-containing cofactor. In spite of the presence of W, the substrate reduction pattern of this enzyme is the same as that of the conventional enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1485746636,"The mechanism by which 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) inhibits transcription of the beta-major Hb gene in vivo was investigated in differentiated Friend erythroleukemic cells (FELC). Steady-state nuclear RNA from untreated and DRB-treated FELC was analyzed by the S1 nuclease assay using [32P]DNA probes labeled at their 3' end close to the site of transcription initiation. DRB severely inhibited transcription of full-length beta-major Hb mRNA precursor molecules and did not increase the production of short, promoter-proximal transcripts. In addition, nascent beta-major RNA transcripts were labeled with [alpha-32P]UTP in nuclei isolated from DRB-treated FELC and untreated FELC and hybridized to separate restriction fragments spanning the entire beta-major Hb gene. DRB inhibited transcription of the promoter-proximal and promoter-distal beta-Hb DNA restriction fragments uniformly by 75-80% and did not detectably increase the amount of short transcripts. Moreover, a brief reversal of the DRB inhibition in vivo increased the number of short, nascent, promoter-proximal beta-Hb transcripts apparently as a result of reinitiation. These data indicate that DRB inhibited transcription of the beta-major Hb gene in vivo at initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2014138911,"On the basis of well-established principles of evolutionary biology and microbiology, I conclude that (i) the deliberate introduction of a novel bacterial strain to the environment is not substantially more dangerous than the accidental release of a smaller number of cells; (ii) distant organisms are less (rather than more) likely to yield dangerous hybrids than more closely related ones; and (iii) the complex attribute of pathogenicity is not likely to emerge from genetic alterations in nonpathogens. If these conclusions are correct, most engineered bacteria need not be regulated more strictly than the bacterial strains that have been tested in the field in the past. The only exceptions would be strains derived from cells, or appropriate genes, of microbes pathogenic for plants or animals. Microbiologists not only recognize the need to handle pathogens with caution: they have long accepted regulations, such as those governing transportation, that reinforce that recognition. It is remarkable that we can still be arguing, on the basis of analogies rather than firm scientific principles or evidence, about hypothetical disasters from kinds of organisms that are being produced in hundreds or thousands of laboratories without a trace of demonstrable harm. RAC required 6 years to adjust its initially conservative guidelines to the emerging understanding of the scientific realities, while maintaining public confidence. Since the level of public concern is not nearly as great today, EPA should be able to relax its excessive restrictions much more quickly. Even better would be a return to having RAC, or a single successor group, evaluate the problems of danger for all classes of engineered bacteria, since the applicable shared principles outweigh any specialized differences in the nature or use of the specific strains. But the regulations are unlikely to be unified in this way, or to be divested of unproductive restrictions, without broad encouragement from the scientific community-including, hopefully, many ecologists. The agenda has been set for too long by apocalyptic activists. To protect this promising field of research and technological application the scientific community must take initiative in helping the public and decision-makers to distinguish reasonable probabilities from remote fantasies."
https://openalex.org/W1552702738,"A highly purified amine N-sulfotransferase has been isolated from guinea pig liver that catalyzes sulfuryl group transfer from 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate to one of a large number of either primary or secondary amines forming the appropriate sulfamate and adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate. Amines as different as aniline, 2-naphthylamine, octylamine, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, desmethylimipramine, and cyclohexylamine serve as acceptors; the product of the last of these substrates is the sugar-substitute cyclamate. Amine N-sulfotransferase activity is dependent on the presence of an unprotonated amino group. The purified enzyme preparation also has O-sulfotransferase activities, suggesting that transfer to oxygen could represent an intrinsic function of the N-sulfotransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1531420003,"For the first time, the enzyme rhodanese had been refolded after thermal denaturation. This was previously not possible because of the strong tendency for the soluble enzyme to aggregate at temperatures above 37 degrees C. The present work used rhodanese that was covalently coupled to a solid support under conditions that were found to preserve enzyme activity. Rhodanese was immobilized using an N-hydroxymalonimidyl derivative of Sepharose containing a 6-carbon spacer. The number of immobilized competent active sites was measured by using [35S]SO3(2-) to form an active site persulfide that is the obligatory catalytic intermediate. Soluble enzyme was irreversibly inactivated in 10 min at 52 degrees C. The immobilized enzyme regained at least 30% of its original activity even after boiling for 20 min. The immobilized enzyme had a Km and Vmax that were each approximately 3 times higher than the corresponding values for the native enzyme. After preincubation at high temperatures, progress curves for the immobilized enzyme showed induction periods of up to 5 min before attaining apparently linear steady states. The pH dependence of the activity was the same for both the soluble and the immobilized enzyme. These results indicate significant stabilization of rhodanese after immobilization, and instabilities caused by adventitious solution components are not the sole reasons for irreversibility of thermal denaturation seen with the soluble enzyme. The results are consistent with models for rhodanese that invoke protein association as a major cause of inactivation of the enzyme. Furthermore, the induction period in the progress curves is consistent with studies which show that rhodanese refolding proceeds through intermediate states."
https://openalex.org/W1484545144,"Abstract To determine whether sequences contained within the small intervening sequence (IVS 1) or large intervening sequence (IVS 2) are involved in the regulated expression of the human beta-globin gene, chimeric genes containing portions of the human beta- and delta-globin genes were stably transfected into mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. Since MEL cells can be induced to differentiate in culture, the expression of the chimeric genes was compared to the expression of beta and delta both before and after the induction of erythroid differentiation. The expression of beta delta 1, a beta-globin gene containing delta IVS 1 in place of beta IVS 1, was comparable to the expression of a beta-globin gene both before and after erythroid differentiation. However, the base-line expression of human beta-globin genes containing delta IVS 2 in place of beta IVS 2 was dramatically decreased. Furthermore, the substitution of delta IVS 2 for beta IVS 2 prevented the regulated increase in expression of the beta-globin gene upon induction. The results also indicate that sequences present in beta IVS 2 are not sufficient for this induced increase in expression since the substitution of beta IVS 2 for delta IVS 2 in a delta gene does not increase the regulated expression of delta during differentiation. These experiments suggest that either the presence of delta IVS 2 in a beta gene interrupts sequences required for the induced expression of beta-globin or that sequences in beta IVS 2 act in concert with other beta globin sequences not present in the delta-globin gene to permit optimal expression."
https://openalex.org/W1513663437,"The short term metabolic effects of the in vivo administration of platelet-derived growth factor have been examined in the liver of the rat. Meal-fed male Wistar rats weighing between 150-180 g received an intraperitoneal injection of platelet-derived growth factor (17 units/100 g weight), transforming growth factor-beta (185 ng/100 g weight), or saline. At 5 min after injection, the livers were freeze-clamped. Samples of the tissue were subsequently assayed for metabolite content and enzyme activities. Platelet-derived growth factor injection caused an elevation in the liver content of pyruvate from 0.14 +/- 0.012 to 0.19 +/- 0.009 mumol/g wet weight liver (p less than or equal to 0.01) and an increase in the cytosolic phosphorylation potential [sigma ATP]/[sigma ADP][sigma Pi] from 6670 +/- 540 to 8970 +/- 750 (p less than or equal to 0.01). In addition an increase in the hepatic content of the hexose monophosphate pathway metabolites, 6-phosphogluconate (0.027 +/- 0.004 to 0.037 +/- 0.005 mumol/g wet weight) (p less than or equal to 0.05), ribulose 5-phosphate (0.013 +/- 0.001 to 0.017 +/- 0.001 mumol/g wet weight) (p less than or equal to 0.05) and combined sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and ribose 5-phosphate (0.052 +/- 0.007 to 0.062 +/- 0.004 mumol/g wet weight) (p less than or equal to 0.05) was observed. The elevation in the hexose monophosphate pathway metabolites resulted from a 1.3-fold elevation in the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [EC 1.1.1.49] when measured in a crude homogenate. Kinetic analysis performed on partially purified glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase demonstrated no significant change in the Km of the enzyme for either NADP+ or glucose 6-phosphate, while a 2.4-fold increase in the Vmax was observed. In view of the rapidity of the change in total measured enzyme activity and increase in the Vmax of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, it is postulated that platelet-derived growth factor causes a covalent modification of the existing enzyme. Transforming growth factor-beta caused no change in the hepatic metabolite content in the treated animals when compared to saline treated controls."

https://openalex.org/W1512619901,"It is known that phagocytic cells such as monocyte-macrophages and myeloid leukemia cells metabolize 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 to 10-oxo-19-nor-25-hydroxyvitamin D3. Now we have found that phagocytic cells metabolize 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 not only to 10-oxo-19-nor-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 but also to a new metabolite eluted just after 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on straight phase high pressure liquid chromatography with a 2-propanol-hexane solvent system. The new metabolite, produced by murine myeloid leukemia cells (M1), was isolated in pure form and identified as 8,25-dihydroxy-9,10-seco-4,6,10(19)-cholestatrien-3-one on the basis of mass, ultraviolet, infrared, and proton magnetic resonance spectra. The 8 alpha-hydroxy epimer of the putative metabolite was chemically synthesized in two steps starting from 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. The spectral data and chromatographic behavior of chemically synthesized 8 alpha,25-dihydroxy-9,10-seco-4,6,10(19)-cholestatrien-3-one coincided exactly with those of the isolated metabolite, indicating that the stereochemistry of the hydroxyl group at the 8-position is alpha. On the basis of the structural characteristics of the two metabolites produced from 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (the present metabolite and 10-oxo-19-nor-25-hydroxyvitamin D3), it is suggested that dioxygenases are involved in the production of these metabolites from 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in phagocytic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1573100926,"The influx of 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine (MeSAdo) into human HL-60 leukemia cells and erythrocytes was characterized in order to determine whether it is facilitated by the nonspecific nucleoside carrier system or by a separate transporter, as suggested by other reports. Initial velocities were measured at room temperature by means of inhibitor-stop and oil-stop assays. MeSAdo influx was strongly inhibited by Ado, dAdo, and nucleoside transport inhibitors including nitrobenzylthioinosine and dipyridamole. Ade was inhibitory only at concentrations in excess of 1 mM. Loss of nucleoside transport capacity during differentiation of HL-60 cells was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in MeSAdo influx rates. These results indicate that MeSAdo influx was mediated by the nonspecific nucleoside transport system. The kinetic data were consistent with a single saturable carrier and yielded Km values of 74 and 184 microM and Vmax values of 424 and 48 pmols/10(6) cells/min with HL-60 cells and erythrocytes, respectively, after correction for a substantial passive diffusion component, which accounted for over 50% of the influx of 1 mM MeSAdo. The passive diffusion of MeSAdo in the presence of a transport inhibitor was not rate-limiting for the salvage of 50 microM MeSAdo to methionine when HL-60 cells were cultured in methionine-deficient medium. The large contribution of passive diffusion to the influx of MeSAdo is consistent with its unusually high octanol/water partition ratio (5.7-fold greater than that of Ado)."
