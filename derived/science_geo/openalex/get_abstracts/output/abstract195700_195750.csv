There are also indications that in simple viruses containing ribonucleic acid the nucleic acid plays a dominant part in the infection. Thus, experiments with tobacco mosaic virus have shown that the protein can be changed chemically without affecting the activity and the genetic properties2; recently, it was even found3 that part of the protein can be removed from tobacco mosaic virus without destroying the activity."

Lately, I have shown4 that, by using thick layers of nuclear emulsions (300µ), and avoiding background effects by placing the specimens in a coal mine at a depth of 600 metres5, it is possible to follow the β-particle tracks to their origin and obtain a one-micron resolution."

https://openalex.org/W1991581437,"THE production of illusions of colour by intermittent visual stimulation has been familiar since the description of the ‘artificial spectrum top’ by Benham1 in 1895 ; but with the traditional arrangement of rotating black-and-white chequered disks the subjective sensations are not particularly vivid. Since the introduction of the electronic stroboscope to psychophysiological experiment by Walter, Dovey and Shipton2 in 1946, thousands of normal and clinical subjects have been subjected to intensive visual stimulation by flickering white light, and all report sensations of pattern, movement and colour. The descriptions vary greatly from subject to subject ; in some, the impressions are particularly intense only at certain frequencies. Most subjects have no difficulty in recognizing the illusory character of the colours : Margiad Evans3 describes them as “… pure ultra unearthly colours, mental colours, not deep visual ones. There was no glow in them but only activity and revolution”. None the less, the colours are ‘real’ enough to act as conditioned stimuli, for Brady4 has shown that subjects who have been conditioned to give a psycho-galvanic skin response to red light will give the ‘red’ response when stimulated with white light flickering at a particular frequency and at multiples of the critical rate."

https://openalex.org/W2053582857,"THAT embryonic tissues in vitro may be affected more drastically by fractionated, than by single, doses of X-rays was shown by Spear in 1932 1. Working with chick embryo fibroblasts, he demonstrated that the depression of activity of these cells is far greater with two 2½-min. exposures separated by 80 min. than with a single 5-min. exposure. In view of the possible significance of these findings for our understanding of the nature of embryonic damage resulting from X-irradiation, and in view of the general interest in the question of radiation hazards to the developing mammalian embryo, the present experiment was designed to determine whether there is a difference between the effects of single and fractionated doses of X-rays on developing mouse embryos in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2092667440,"IN 1937, Hirschmann and Wintersteiner1 reported the isolation of 17-dihydroequilenin from the urine of pregnant mares and expressed surprise that no evidence of the presence of dihydroequilin was obtained. (The nomenclature used here is that employed by Carol and his co-workers3,4,6.) Afterwards, the presence of β-dihydroequilin was detected in material derived from pregnant mares' urine by the dioxane hydrolysis procedure of Grant and Beall2, but isolation was not effected3."
https://openalex.org/W2057409636,"HYPOTHERMIA and hibernation have been subjects of increasing interest in recent years, yet there is a critical lack of observations on the biochemistry of these states. High levels of magnesium in serum have been related by several investigators to hibernation and cold exposure1. In the present studies levels of serum magnesium and other electrolytes, and serum specific gravities, were compared in bats in several series including both hibernating and non-hibernating conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2030169697,"SEXUAL selection may be an important component of the selection pressures determining changes of gene frequency in Mendelian populations, and a number of studies of Drosophila have been made with the object of assessing degree of competition for mates (see, for example, refs. 1 and 2) and have led to the conclusion that, while male vigour is an important factor, discrimination and preference between genotypes do occur and seem to be largely female attributes. In an attempt to assess the importance of mating preference as a factor affecting changes of gene frequency in some experimental populations described elsewhere3, we have come across a phenomenon which, as far as we can discover, has not been reported before."

The basal diet had the composition : whole soya bean flour, 25; groundnut cake flour, 14; sesame cake flour, 14; wheat flour, 14; rice flour, 14; Bengal gram flour, 14; vitaminized starch, 2 (containing adequate quantities of all B-complex vitamins except vitamin B12); shark liver oil, 2; Osborne and Mendel salt mixture, 1. At the end of the experiment, the animals were killed and the excised livers freed of blood clots and immediately chilled and used for measurement of dehydrogenase activities. Liver homogenates prepared in ice-cold M/15 phosphate buffer of pH 7.2 were used for the measurement of lactic, glutamic, succinic, butyric and choline dehydrogenase activities, according to the method described by Sreenivasa Murthy and Swaminathan1, using tetrazolium bromide as the hydrogen acceptor. Portions of the liver tissue were used for nitrogen estimation by the Kjeldahl method. The vitamin B12 content of the liver was measured microbiologically using L. leichmannii-4797 as the test organism."

https://openalex.org/W1984086976,"WHEN quantitative techniques are attempted for the analysis of serum proteins separated by electrophoresis on filter paper, it is recognized that the staining procedure, followed by removing the surplus stain, constitutes sources of error. In order to get more satisfactory reproducibility we apply on each paper strip (after electrophoresis but before staining) 0.02 ml. of a 0.05 per cent solution of polyethyl-enimine (Badische Anilin und Sodafabrik, Ludwigshafen (Germany)) in water. This polybase, —[—CH2—CH2—NH2—]n—, has the advantage of being stained by naphthalene black 12 B as well as by sudan black; therefore it can be used equally well as a reference substance for protein staining and lipoprotein staining. The molecule (mol. weight approx. 30,000–40,000) of the polybase (called ‘Polymine’) is of linear build and possesses such an affinity for cellulose that the stained spots cannot easily be eluted but must be estimated by direct-reading colorimetry. The paper strip α (see Fig. 1) shows the separation of normal serum proteins (Whatman paper No. 1, pH 8.6, 10 V./cm.) and a spot of 0.02 ml. ‘Polymine’ standard on each side. Strip α has been stained with naphthalene black and strip b with sudan black. It is well known that in pathological sera the uptake of dyes is variable; in such cases the ‘Polymine’ standard can serve as a reference because the solubility interrelationships between dye, solvent and polybase are constant."

https://openalex.org/W2095074231,"SOME pharmacological properties and clinical uses of 2 : 4-diamino-5-phenyl-thiazole hydrochloride (daptazole or amiphenazole) have been previously considered elsewhere1. It often appears to exert a mild respiratory stimulant effect in both unnarcotized and narcotized patients and animals. It has been used clinically as a buffer to depressed respiration in such conditions as pneumonia, asphyxia neonatorum and in the relief of respiratory depression following anaesthesia. It has further been employed in the treatment of barbiturate intoxication (usually in combination with ββ-methyl ethyl glutarimide (NP13, megimide or bemegride.) and opiate overdosage, and has been administered in combination with large doses of morphine in the relief of severe and prolonged pain. When used in this latter manner, it has appeared to minimize the onset of tolerance or addiction to morphine. It is effective both orally and parenterally, and has a high therapeutic index (greater than 10). Therapeutic doses (5–50 mgm.) are almost completely devoid of side effects, and large doses (more than 200 mgm.) have been safely tolerated by unnarcotized volunteers. In small doses (20–40 mgm.) it often appears to improve the mental outlook of depressed patients."
