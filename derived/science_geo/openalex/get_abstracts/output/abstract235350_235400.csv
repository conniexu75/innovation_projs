The epigenetic modification by methylation of cytosine in CpG dinucleotides is also mutagenic, but this is thought to occur by spontaneous deamination. Here we show that Aid and Apobec1 are 5-methylcytosine deaminases resulting in a thymine base opposite a guanine. Their action can thus lead to C → T transition mutations in methylated DNA, or in conjunction with repair of the T:G mismatch, to demethylation. The Aid and Apobec1 genes are located in a cluster of pluripotency genes including Nanog and Stella and are co-expressed with these genes in oocytes, embryonic germ cells, and embryonic stem cells. These results suggest that Aid and perhaps some of its family members may have roles in epigenetic reprogramming and cell plasticity. Transition in CpG dinucleotides is the most frequent mutation in human genetic diseases, and sequence context analysis of CpG transitions in the APC tumor suppressor gene suggests that DNA deaminases may play a significant role in tumor etiology.

DNA in multicellular organisms is generally maintained intact during development and in various adult tissues. Notable exceptions to this rule are recombination in lymphoid tissues and immunoglobulin diversification during B cell development. These are initiated by the Rag recombinase, and by Activation induced cytidine deaminase (Aid or Aicda), respectively. Aid is required both for somatic hypermutation and for class switch recombination of immunoglobulin genes (1Neuberger M.S. Harris R.S. Di Noia J. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Trends Biochem.

Immunol. 2002; 20: 165-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Aid is related to Apobec1, a known cytidine deaminase that acts on a specific RNA (for apolipoprotein B), converting a C residue to a U resulting in a premature stop codon (3Scott J. Cell. 1995; 81: 833-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although it was initially envisaged that Aid would also act on RNA (2Honjo T. Kinoshita K. Muramatsu M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 165-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), subsequent studies have shown that Aid can act as a cytosine deaminase on DNA in Escherichia coli (4Petersen-Mahrt S.K.

Importantly, loss of uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG), 1The abbreviations used are: UDG, uracil DNA glycosylase; 5meC, 5 methylcytosine; PGCs, primordial germ cells; EG, embryonic germ; ES, embryonic stem; E, embryonic day; mTDG, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum; RT, reverse transcription.1The abbreviations used are: UDG, uracil DNA glycosylase; 5meC, 5 methylcytosine; PGCs, primordial germ cells; EG, embryonic germ; ES, embryonic stem; E, embryonic day; mTDG, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum; RT, reverse transcription. which repairs U:G mismatches in DNA, affects both hypermutation and class switching (1Neuberger M.S.

Thus the current more widely accepted model envisages that Aid deaminates C to U in the DNA of immunoglobulin genes, leading to somatic mutations or class switch recombination depending on the subsequent pathway of DNA repair (1Neuberger M.S. Harris R.S. Di Noia J. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 305-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In addition to Aid and Apobec1, there are other members of this deaminase family, including Apobec2 and Apobec3g. Some of these can mutate DNA in E. coli (12Harris R.S. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1247-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) and single-stranded DNA in vitro (13Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. J. Biol.

Biol. 2004; 337: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Apobec3g is also known as the cellular Cem15 protein and is critical for innate immunity to retroviruses, partly by mutating viral single-stranded DNA (14Harris R.S. Bishop K.N. Sheehy A.M. Craig H.M. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Watt I.N. Neuberger M.S. Malim M.H. Cell. 2003; 113: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Thus Aid and Apobec3g (and perhaps other members of the family) have roles in acquired and innate immunity by mutating cytosine in DNA. An ancestral role of DNA deaminases in protecting the organism against invading DNA may hence have been adapted to mutating endogenous DNA to better combat pathogens (1Neuberger M.S. Harris R.S. Di Noia J. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 305-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Another mechanism for the protection of the genome against invading DNA such as transposable elements is by methylating their DNA at CpG dinucleotides (16Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2395-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). This leads to transcriptional silencing of transposons so that they cannot continue to spread. The methylation of cytosine also increases the rate of mutation of C (17Jones P.A. Baylin S.B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 415-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) so that methylated transposons accumulate mutations. It is generally thought that this occurs by spontaneous deamination (17Jones P.A. Baylin S.B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 415-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), because enzymes that can deaminate 5-methylcytosine (5meC) have not been identified. As a result the CpG dinucleotide has become depleted in species with CpG methylation. In addition to its role in genome defense, methylation is important for epigenetic gene regulation. This includes parental imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, and possibly more general gene regulatory mechanisms in development and differentiation (18Jaenisch R. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar, 19Li E. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 662-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). Recently it has been found that genomic patterns of DNA methylation are reprogrammed genome-wide in early embryos and in primordial germ cells (19Li E. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 662-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar, 20Reik W. Dean W. Walter J. Science. 2001; 293: 1089-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (2372) Google Scholar, 21Surani M.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Reprogramming may be necessary for resetting the epigenetic state of the gametic genomes so that totipotency is restored to the embryonic genome. Epigenetic reprogramming involves demethylation, which can occur passively as a result of DNA replication in the absence of DNA methyltransferase 1 (16Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2395-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar, 18Jaenisch R. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar, 19Li E. Nat. Rev.

However, the dramatic demethylation of the paternal genome in the zygote before replication of DNA (22Mayer W. Niveleau A. Walter J. Fundele R. Haaf T.

A number of mechanisms have been proposed for the loss of methylation (27Cedar H. Verdine G.L. Nature. 1999; 379: 568-569Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar), involving direct demethylation (28Bhattacharya S.K. Ramchandani S. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Nature. 1999; 397: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), oxidative demethylation (29Trewick S.C. Henshaw T.F. Hausinger R.P. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Nature. 2002; 419: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), 5meC base excision repair (30Zhu B. Zheng Y. Hess D. Angliker H. Schwarz S. Siegmann M. Thiry S. Jost J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5135-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), or nucleotide excision repair (27Cedar H. Verdine G.L. Nature. 1999; 379: 568-569Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, no enzyme activity has been convincingly identified that can initiate these reactions (31Ng H.H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D.

We have asked whether cytosine deaminases can deaminate 5meC in DNA. We found that Aid and Apobec1 have 5meC deaminase activities, resulting in a thymine base opposite a guanine. If this mismatch is repaired, a methylated cytosine is replaced by an unmethylated one. If it is not repaired, it results in a C → T transition mutation. The expression of Aid has previously been thought to be limited to lymphoid tissues, but embryonic tissues were not examined (34Muramatsu M. Sankaranand V.S. Anant S. Sugai M. Kinoshita K. Davidson N.O. Honjo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18470-18476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly we found that Aid and Apobec1 are colocalized within a cluster of pluripotency genes and are expressed in oocytes and primordial germ cells, which undergo epigenetic reprogramming. This suggests new roles for DNA mutators in the physiology and pathology of DNA methylation. Cloning and Expression of Sss I—The isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible Sss I expression cassette from the pCAL7 (New England Biolabs) plasmid was transferred into pACYC177 (NEB) by standard cloning techniques (details on request). The resulting plasmid, p15ASss I Kan, was transformed into a methylation restriction-deficient E. coli, ER1821 (Elisabeth Raleigh, NEB) (F-endA1 thi-1 supE44 spoT? rfbD? mcrA5 (mrr-hsdRMA-mcrB)1-::IS10) and checked for isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible methylation of DNA. We ensured the endogenous rpoB C1586 site could be methylated by bisulfite sequence analysis as described (23Oswald J. Engemann S. Lane N. Mayer W. Olek A. Fundele R. Dean W. Reik W. Walter J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 475-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, 25Hajkova P. Erhardt S. Lane N. Haaf T. El-Maarri O. Reik W. Walter J. Surani M.A. Mech. Dev. 2002; 117: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar) using rpoB-specific primers for bisulfite converted DNA (gttgttttttttgatagtagataggtagtg, ctcaatttataatccaaaacaacc). To quantitate the percentage methylation of a particular site, we isolated plasmid DNA from three independent cultures after induction of Sss I and digested them with CpG methylation-sensitive SnaBI. Digested or control undigested plasmids were transformed into a methylation non-restricting E. coli (ER1821). From this we were able to assess that in vivo methylation by Sss I caused protection of the restriction site on 82% of plasmids (unmethylated digested plasmid gave <1% transformation efficiency; see Fig. 1A). This was also consistent with the extent of methylation determined by agarose gel analysis of the digested plasmids (data not shown). Screening for DNA Deamination at 5meCpG—Rifampicin screening was done as published (4Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Harris R.S. Neuberger M.S. Nature. 2002; 418: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) with modifications. Bacterial strains containing Aid with Sss I, Sss I without Aid (but with empty vector pTrc99A), Aid alone, and pTrc99A alone were induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 24 h in culture. Rifampicin-resistant colonies were selected on 100 μg/ml rifampicin LB agar plates containing ampicillin (Aid plasmid) or kanamycin (Sss I plasmid) as appropriate. The median number of rifampicin resistant-colonies/number of viable cells was determined for each experiment consisting of 20 cultures/category (Aid and Sss I, vector and Sss I, Aid, vector). The CpG to CpA transition at the target site in rpoB was identified by a PCR assay that differentiates between the single nucleotide G or A at this position (1586). The screening primer (rpoB G → A: ctgagattacgcacaaacgtca) with a 3′-A can only anneal when a G → A transition has occurred at nucleotide position 1586 (1586G → A), giving an expected product of 429 bp using rpoB reverse (caccgacggataccacctgctg) as the second primer. For the locus control PCR, forward (rpoB forward: ttggcgaaatggcggaaaacc) and reverse primers (rpoB reverse) always produce a band of 627 bp, irrespective of mutations, acting as an internal control for success of the PCR. The PCR screen was performed on two randomly selected rifampicin colonies from each of the cultures within a category. The frequency of the 5meC transition was calculated from the number of 5meC transitions (at rpoB1586) to the total number of mutations. Preparation of Recombinant Aid and Apobec1—Human Aid was subcloned into a pET30 derived vector with a C-terminal His tag (plasmid sequences on request). Preparation of a rat Apobec1 expression vector was described previously (13Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19583-19586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Production and purification of recombinant protein was as described (13Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19583-19586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). UDG-based Deamination Assay—The assay was done as described previously (13Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19583-19586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Aid/Apobec1 samples (0.4-1 μl) were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in 10 μl of buffer R (40 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 40 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) with 2.5 pmol of 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotides, 3′-labeled with fluorescein. The oligonucleotides substrates SPM319-SPM330 are all based on 5′-biotin-ATAAGAATAGAATGAFFFFFA-ATGAATSSSSSATGAATAGTA-fluorescein-3′ where F and S are the first and second motifs indicated in Fig. 2B. Oligonucleotides were purified on streptavidin magnetic beads (Dynal) and washed at 70 °C. Deamination was monitored by incubating the bead-immobilized oligonucleotides at 37 °C for 1 h with excess uracil-DNA glycosylase (1 unit, New England Biolabs). Resultant cleaved oligonucleotides were subjected to 15-20% PAGE-urea gel electrophoresis, and the fluorescent signal was detected with a FLA-5000 scanner (Fuji). Percent conversions were calculated from the scanned images, percent conversion = pixel volume cleaved product (minus background)/pixel volume cleaved product (minus background) + pixel volume substrate (minus background). Data for rate calculations were based on numerous experiments on SPM320 and SPM348 for C deamination, and SPM347 and SPM359 for the 5meC deamination.

TDG-based Deamination Assay—Samples were treated as above, except that an excess (5 pmol) of the reverse complement oligonucleotide was added after the bead isolation reaction, heated to 90 °C, and allowed to anneal by cooling slowly to room temperature. Deamination of 5-methylcytosine was monitored by incubating the double-stranded, bead-immobilized oligonucleotides at 47 °C for 1 h, with excess thymine DNA-glycosylase (2 units, Trevigen). Products were resolved and analyzed as above. The 5meC containing oligonucleotides substrates SPM356-SPM363 are all based on 5′-biotin-ATAAGAATAGAATGAFFFFGAATGAATSSSSSGATGAATAGTA-fluorescein-3′ where F and S are the first and second motifs indicated in Fig. 2C, and each cytosine incorporated is methylated. Other oligonucleotides used were SPM279ATTATTGTTATTAAmeCGATTTGTTTATTTGTTTATTTATT-fluor, SPM281ATTATTGTTATTAGmeCGATTTGTTTATTTGTTTATTTATTT fluor, and SPM347ATTATTGTTATTAGmeCTATTTGTTTATTTGTTTATTTATTT-fluor. Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from various mouse tissues using Qiagen miniRNAeasy reagents (Qiagen, Germany). Random hexamer and SuperscriptII (Invitrogen) reagents were used to make cDNA. Primers for Aid (forward cagggacggcatgagacct and reverse tcagccttgcggtcttcaca), Apobec1 (forward ctctgtcatgatctggatagtcacac and reverse catcgcagcaacataagctcc), and Hprt (forward cctgctggattacattaaagcact and reverse gtcaagggcatatccaa) were used to amplify a PCR product from cDNA using Promega HotStarTaq. The amplification cycles were as follows: Aid and Apobec1, 95 °C 15 min, then 23-32 cycles of 94 °C 30 s, 65 °C 30 s, and 72 °C 30 s; Hprt, 95 °C 15 min, then 20-29 cycles of 94 °C 30 s, 55 °C 30 s, and 72 °C 30 s. For the amplification of Aid for 35-44 cycles, a nested approach was used with the first 20 cycles with outer primers (outer forward tttctttaccatttcaaaaatgtccg and outer reverse aatagtctttgaaggtcatgatccc) at 95 °C 15 min, 20 cycles of 94 °C 30 s, 63 °C 30 s, and 72 °C 30 s, then 15-24 cycles as above for Aid. The products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel, stained, scanned on a Fuji FLA-3000, and analyzed using Aidi v3 two-dimensional densitometry software. For Fig. 3C the intensity of the Hprt signal at 29 cycles was arbitrarily set to 100 units, and the intensity of the Aid signal at 32 cycles is displayed for each tissue relative to Hprt. Aid Mutates 5meC in E. coli—We were interested to see whether we could identify DNA deaminases that can deaminate 5meC. Using the deaminase motif we isolated cDNAs for candidate deaminases in the mouse genome, and screened these initially for expression in oocytes and other pluripotent tissues (data not shown). One of the cDNAs that was expressed in oocytes was Aid. We therefore tested Aid in a modified E. coli genetic system (4Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Harris R.S. Neuberger M.S. Nature. 2002; 418: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) which makes use of mutations of Cs in the rpoB gene leading to resistance to rifampicin. Aid mutates predominantly three Cs in the rpoB gene, one of which (position 1586) is in a CpG dinucleotide. We expressed the CpG specific methyltransferase Sss I in E. coli; bisulfite sequencing confirmed that the selectable rpoB gene was methylated at CpG residues including C1586 (not shown), and in vivo CpG methylation by Sss I was able to protect 82% of sites from restriction (Fig. 1A). We determined the relative frequency of deamination at the methylated C1586 in rpoB using rifampicin selection and a single nucleotide discriminating PCR assay (Fig. 1A). If the methylated C were not a substrate for Aid, there would be no increase in its mutation rate over that with Sss I alone. However, the mutation rate at the C1586 position of rpoB in three independent experiments was ∼8-fold higher in E. coli with both Sss I and Aid than in those having only Sss I (Fig. 1B, Table I). Thus this experimental system demonstrates Aid has a 5meC deaminase activity. It is not possible to directly compare the relative activities of Aid as a C deaminase (Aid versus vector background) to Aid as a 5meC deaminase (Aid and Sss I versus vector and Sss I), because the repair systems for U:G (without Sss I) and T:G (with Sss I) are different and their relative efficiencies are not known. The increase in frequency of mutation with expression of Sss I alone may be in part because of spontaneous deamination. Whether Apobec1 and Apobec3g can deaminate 5meC could not be tested in the E. coli assay, because they do not mutate the C1586 position.Table IMedian mutation frequency (×10-9), average -fold induction, and average percent transitions at rpoB1586 for three independent experiments Each median mutation frequency was determined from >16 independent cultures.ExperimentRifR-Fold inductionTransitions at rpoB1586Vector1190220010393Aid116002140094731100Vector + Sss I17602130075531000Aid + Sss I1780028400457234800 Open table in a new tab Aid and Apobec1 Deaminate 5meC in Vitro—We sought to confirm the 5meC deaminase activity of Aid biochemically, using the purified protein in a previously established DNA deamination assay (13Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19583-19586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Oligonucleotides were methylated at a single CpG, and upon incubation with Aid any T resulting from deamination of 5meC was detected using a thermostable thymine DNA glycosylase from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (mTDG). Aid showed strong deamination activity (Fig. 2A), which was dependent on the presence of the protein (lane 1 versus lane 2) and the substrate being single-stranded (lane 2 versus lane 6). Specific detection of deaminated 5meC by mTDG requires double-stranded DNA (lane 2 versus lane 4). Because mTDG can act on either T:G or U:G mismatches (35Hardeland U. Bentele M. Jiricny J. Schar P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2261-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (data not shown), we needed to verify that no U was produced from C that had remained unmethylated. UDG (36Lindahl T.

The methylated oligonucleotide reacted with Aid was also not cleaved by SMUG, an enzyme that recognizes a number of mismatches including U and 5-hydroxy meC, but not T (37Boorstein R.J. Cummings Jr., A. Marenstein D.R. Chan M.K. Ma Y. Neubert T.A. Brown S.M. Teebor G.W. J. Biol.

A catalytic inactive mutation of Aid (E58G) did not show any deamination activity toward either the unmethylated or methylated C (data not shown). These experiments clearly show that Aid produces T from 5meC in DNA by deamination. DNA deaminases require particular sequence motifs as targets, on unmethylated DNA Aid prefers the sequence WRC (A/T, A/G, C) in vivo and in vitro (8Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F.

In a subset of these oligonucleotides all Cs were replaced by 5meCs, and we found that the WRC motif is still the preferred target (Fig. 2C), with a minor difference. Although in the unmethylated oligonucleotides all four possible WRC targets were deaminated to the same extent, once methylated, there does appear to be a preference for AGC (Fig. 2C, lane 1 versus lane 2, lane 4 first motif versus lane 8 first motif). From Fig. 2A we estimate that the activity of Aid on 5meC is ∼3-fold lower than on C in the context AGC (SPM347 lane 2, SPM348 lane 8). Oligonucleotides containing both methylated and unmethylated targets demonstrate that the sequence context of each cytosine can render the deamination reaction of 5meC equivalent to C (Fig. 2C, lane 11, AA5meC versus ATC), or 5meC preferred to C (Fig. 2C, lane 12, AGmeC versus ATC). For the analysis in Fig. 2C we used three times as much enzyme than in Fig. 2B. From Coomassie and Western analysis (data not shown) we estimate a turnover of 60-70 fmol/min/μg for unmethylated (SPM320 and SPM348) and 20-25 fmol/min/μg methylated C deamination (SPM347 and SPM359) based on a 15-min incubation of 2.5 pmol of substrate and an ∼40% conversion rate using 1 and 3 μg of Aid, respectively. Deaminase activity on 5meC by purified Aid has been observed previously (7Bransteitter R. Pham P. Scharff M.D. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4102-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Apobec1 has also been shown to have C deaminase activity but could not be tested for 5meC deaminase activity in the E. coli assay. We previously showed that in vitro Apobec1 has a preference for NTC (13Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. J. Biol.

Thus both Aid and Apobec1 have 5meC deaminase activity in vitro that is affected by the sequence context. Aid and Apobec1 Genes Are Colocalized with Nanog and Stella and Are Expressed in Pluripotent Tissues—Aid is thought to be exclusively expressed in B cells undergoing class switch recombination or somatic hypermutation (34Muramatsu M.

However, bioinformatic analysis revealed a striking arrangement of the Aid and Apobec1 genes within a 200-kb cluster of pluripotency genes, including Nanog, Stella (Dppa3), and Gdf3 on mouse chromosome 6 (Fig. 3A). Nanog and Stella have important roles in embryonic stem (ES) cell identity (39Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Maruyama M. Maeda M. Yamanaka S.

Release of excess absorbed energy in the cell can cause lethal photooxidative damage. We identified a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, designated PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 1 (PIF1), that negatively regulates chlorophyll biosynthesis. pif1 mutant seedlings accumulate excess free protochlorophyllide when grown in the dark, with consequent lethal bleaching upon exposure to light. PIF1 interacts specifically with the photoactivated conformer of phytochromes A and B, suggesting a signaling pathway by which chlorophyll biosynthetic rates are tightly controlled during the critical initial emergence of seedlings from subterranean darkness into sunlight."

The cysteine residue in the active site of certain eukaryotic Prx enzymes undergoes reversible oxidation to sulfinic acid (Cys-SO2H) during catalysis, and sulfiredoxin (Srx) has been identified as responsible for reversal of the resulting enzyme inactivation in yeast. We have now characterized mammalian orthologs of yeast Srx with an assay based on monitoring of the reduction of sulfinic Prx by immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for the sulfinic state. Sulfinic reduction by mammalian Srx was found to be a slow process (kcat = 0.18/min) that requires ATP hydrolysis. ATP could be efficiently replaced by GTP, dATP, or dGTP but not by CTP, UTP, dCTP, or dTTP. Both glutathione and thioredoxin are potential physiological electron donors for the Srx reaction, given that their Km values (1.8 mm and 1.2 μm, respectively) are in the range of their intracellular concentrations, and the Vmax values obtained with the two reductants were similar. Although its pKa is relatively low (∼7.3), the active site cysteine of Srx remained reduced even when the active site cysteine of most Prx molecules became oxidized.

All of the Prx enzymes contain a conserved cysteine residue in the NH2-terminal region that is the primary site of oxidation by H2O2. The six mammalian Prx isoforms identified to date can be divided into three subgroups that have been designated 2-Cys, atypical 2-Cys, and 1-Cys (2Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Chang T.S. Jeong W. Kim K. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 5Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

The 2-Cys proteins, which include Prx I, II, III, and IV, contain an additional conserved cysteine in the COOH-terminal region, whereas members of the atypical 2-Cys (Prx V) and 1-Cys (Prx VI) subgroups do not. The extent of amino acid sequence identity among the three subgroups is low (<20%), whereas that among members of the 2-Cys subgroup is 60–80%. Among 2-Cys Prx isoforms, Prx I and II are localized in the cytosol, whereas Prx III is restricted to mitochondria, and Prx IV is present in the endoplasmic reticulum as well as in the extracellular space (2Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Chang T.S. Jeong W. Kim K. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). When overexpressed in various cell types, Prx I or Prx II efficiently lowered the intracellular level of H2O2 produced in response to cell stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor or tumor necrosis factor, inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-κB induced by tumor necrosis factor, and blocked the induction of apoptosis by ceramide (7Kang S.W.

In the catalytic cycle of 2-Cys Prx proteins, the sulfhydryl group (Cys-SH) of the conserved, H2O2-sensitive cysteine residue (Cys52 in mammalian Prx I) is selectively oxidized by H2O2 to Cys-SOH, which then reacts with the conserved Cys-SH (Cys173 in Prx I) located in the COOH terminus of the other subunit in the homodimer to form an intermolecular disulfide. The disulfide is subsequently and specifically reduced by thioredoxin (Trx) (2Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Chang T.S. Jeong W. Kim K.

Uhm T.B. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7022-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Given that the disulfide-forming cysteine residues (Cys52 and Cys173 in Prx I) of 2-Cys Prx enzymes are situated far apart, with their sulfur atoms separated by ∼13 Å (11Schroder E. Littlechild J.A.

Fold Des. 2000; 8: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (275) Google Scholar), formation of the disulfide is a slow process, and the sulfenic intermediate (Cys52-SOH) is occasionally further oxidized to sulfinic acid (Cys52-SO2H). Trx is not able to reduce this sulfinic acid moiety of Prx, so such hyperoxidation was thought to result in permanent inactivation of peroxidase activity (9Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Prokaryotic Prx enzymes, which do not contain the COOH-terminal GGLG motif of their eukaryotic counterparts, are insensitive to oxidative inactivation (14Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Science. 2003; 300: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Hyperoxidation of 2-Cys Prx enzymes has been detected in various cell types treated with H2O2. On examination of the redox state of Prx in several mammalian cell lines that had been metabolically labeled with 35S, however, we previously observed that the intensity of the 35S-labeled acidic spots corresponding to sulfinylated Prx I and Prx II on two-dimensional gels increased during exposure of cells to H2O2 and then decreased as the intensity of the spots corresponding to the respective reduced forms of the enzymes increased after removal of H2O2 in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (15Woo H.A.

This observation led us to propose that the sulfinylation reaction is actually reversible in cells (15Woo H.A. Chae H.Z. Hwang S.C. Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Kim K. Rhee S.G.

The enzyme responsible for the reduction of hyperoxidized Prx, sulfiredoxin (Srx), was subsequently identified in yeast on the basis of the observations that its expression was induced by H2O2 and that deletion of its gene resulted in a reduced tolerance to H2O2 (17Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Srx defines a protein family of lower and higher eukaryotes whose members possess a conserved cysteine residue. The fact that Srx is conserved only among eukaryotes is consistent with the observation that prokaryotic Prx enzymes are not susceptible to oxidative inactivation. Studies with the yeast enzyme showed that the reduction of Prx by Srx requires the conserved cysteine of Srx, ATP hydrolysis, Mg2+, and a thiol as an electron donor (17Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Sestrins, a family of proteins whose expression is modulated by the tumor suppressor p53, were recently shown to mediate reduction of hyperoxidized Prx in mammalian cells, whereas purified human Srx failed to catalyze such reduction (18Budanov A.V. Sablina A.A. Feinstein E. Koonin E.V. Chumakov P.M. Science. 2004; 304: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). We now show that purified recombinant mammalian Srx enzymes of human, rat, and mouse origin are capable of reducing the Cys-SO2H moiety of Prx I. In addition, depletion of Srx by RNA interference indicated that Srx is largely responsible for the reduction of Cys-SO2H of Prx I and II in A549 human lung carcinoma cells.

Rabbit antiserum to Trx2 was generated by injection with the purified human Trx2 protein. Monoclonal antibodies to GST and to lamin B were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Calbiochem, respectively, and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to protein disulfide isomerase were from Stressgen Biotechnologies. P81 cellulose phosphate paper was from Whatman, and iodo[1-14C]acetamide was from Amersham Biosciences. Cloning of Mammalian Srx cDNAs—The DNA sequences for human Srx (hSrx), rat Srx (rSrx), and mouse Srx (mSrx) were amplified from IMAGE clone 5735551 (Invitrogen), a rat brain cDNA library (Clontech), and a mouse liver cDNA library (Clontech), respectively, by the polymerase chain reaction. The human Srx cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI-XhoI site of pGEX4T-1 for expression of GST-hSrx or into the NdeI-BamHI site of pET-11a for expression of hSrx alone. The cDNAs for rSrx or mSrx, each containing a sequence encoding a factor Xasensitive cleavage site immediately upstream of the initiating methionine codon were subcloned into the EcoRI-XhoI site of pGEX4T-1 for expression of GST-Srx fusion proteins. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) or BL21 cells harboring the plasmids encoding hSrx or GST-Srx fusion proteins were cultured at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). After the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1 mm), the cultures were incubated for 3 h at 25 °C, and the cells were then lysed. For purification of hSrx, the cell lysates were prepared by ultrasonic treatment of cells in a solution containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene-sulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF). Proteins precipitated by ammonium sulfate (80% (w/v) saturation) were dissolved in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 m ammonium sulfate. After removal of debris by centrifugation, the soluble fraction was applied to a TSK Phenyl-5PW column that had been equilibrated with the same solution. The fractions containing hSrx were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon YM10 device), and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA. The dialyzed sample was applied to a Mono-Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with the same solution. The flow-through fraction was collected and dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA. The dialyzed sample was loaded onto a Mono-S HR 5/5 column that had been equilibrated with the same solution, and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.5 m. The fractions containing hSrx were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). GST-Srx proteins were isolated with the use of GSH-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The GST moiety was removed from the fusion proteins by digestion with proteases: factor Xa for rSrx and mSrx and thrombin for hSrx. The resulting digestion mixtures were applied to GSH-Sepharose, and the flow-through fractions were collected. The fractions containing rSrx or mSrx were dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA and then applied to a TSK Heparin-5PW column that had been equilibrated with the same solution. The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.5 m, and the fractions containing rSrx or mSrx were pooled and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. For purification of hSrx derived from GST-hSrx, the same procedure as that described above for hSrx was followed. The purity and concentration of protein preparations were evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining and by the Bradford assay. The concentration of the recombinant proteins was also determined from measurement of A280 and from the extinction coefficient of each protein calculated on the basis of its amino acid composition (22Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). Partial Purification of hSrx from A549 Cells—Lysates of A549 cells prepared in a solution containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm AEBSF were centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate (80% (w/v) saturation) precipitation. The precipitate was dissolved in a solution containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.7 m ammonium sulfate. After removal of debris by centrifugation, the soluble fraction was applied to a TSK Phenyl-5PW column that had been equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 m ammonium sulfate. The fractions corresponding to the peak of hSrx, detected by immunoblot analysis with antibodies to Srx, were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon YM10), and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Preparation of Sulfinic Prx I—Recombinant human Prx I (2 mg) was incubated in a 1-ml reaction mixture containing 150 μg of Trx1, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm H2O2, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). Oxidation was initiated by the addition of H2O2 and continued for 30 min at 30 °C. The addition of 20 μl of 100 mm H2O2 to the reaction mixture and further incubation for 30 min was repeated three times. The reaction mixture was then applied to Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6); after incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the resin was separated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 1 min. The resulting supernatant was again treated with Q-Sepharose. Sulfinic Prx I free of Trx1 was recovered from the supernatants, and the sulfinic oxidation state of Cys52 of the purified protein was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (13Yang K.S.

Assay of Srx Activity—Reduction of sulfinic Prx I (Ox-Prx I) was initiated by the addition of the indicated concentrations of Srx proteins to a reaction mixture (0.1 ml) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm creatine phosphate, creatine kinase (6.5 units/ml), and various amounts of Ox-Prx I, MgCl2, ATP, and a thiol donor such as GSH or the Trx system. After incubation for the indicated times at 30 °C, portions of the reaction mixture were removed and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for hyperoxidized Prx enzymes (α-Prx-SO2) and with antibodies to Prx I. The concentration of Ox-Prx I was determined from the intensity of the band corresponding to Ox-Prx I normalized by that of the band for Prx I. Cell Culture—HeLa (human cervical carcinoma) cells and A549 (human lung carcinoma) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium and Ham's F-12K medium, respectively, each supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. Determination of the Redox State of Srx—A549 cells grown on six-well plates were washed with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solutions and then exposed directly to 10% trichloroacetic acid to prevent postlysis disulfide exchange. The precipitates were washed twice with acetone and suspended in 100 μl of a reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 1 mm EDTA, 1.5% SDS, 1 mm AEBSF, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and either 20 mm NEM or 20 mm AMS. After incubation for 90 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of nonreducing SDS sample buffer. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 14% gel and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to Srx. Depletion of hSrx by RNA Interference—A small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex targeting the 5′-GGAGGUGACUACUUCUACU-3′ sequence in the open reading frame of human Srx mRNA as well as a control RNA duplex of random sequence were obtained from Dharmacon Research. A549 cells (4 × 106) were suspended in 100 μl of solution V (Amaxa Biosystems) with 1 μm siRNA and subjected to transfection by electroporation with program U-17 of the Nucleofector instrument (Amaxa Biosystems). Preparation of Recombinant Srx of Human, Mouse, and Rat Origin—Whereas yeast Srx was shown to reduce sulfinic Prx in the presence of ATP, Mg2+, and DTT (17Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar), hSrx was found to possess no such sulfinic reductase activity (18Budanov A.V. Sablina A.A. Feinstein E. Koonin E.V. Chumakov P.M. Science. 2004; 304: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of Srx from three mammalian species (human, mouse, and rat) and two yeast species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe) share only 25% identity (Fig. 1). The mammalian enzymes contain ∼30 additional residues at their NH2 termini, whereas the yeast enzymes have ∼15 additional residues in their central regions. To reevaluate the catalytic properties of hSrx, we prepared a GST-hSrx fusion protein that contains a thrombin-sensitive cleavage site between the two moieties. The major product (>90%) of thrombin digestion of GST-hSrx, however, even under conditions of limited proteolysis, was an Srx fragment (hSrx-ΔN16) whose molecular mass determined by mass spectrometry (12777.5 Da) corresponded to that calculated for hSrx lacking the NH2-terminal 16 amino acids (12776.4 Da). We also prepared recombinant full-length (not fused to GST) hSrx, but it was found to be unstable; freezing-thawing or storage overnight at 4 °C in solutions of various ionic strength or pH resulted in the aggregation of hSrx, whereas hSrx-ΔN16 remained stable under similar conditions (data not shown). We therefore prepared GST fusion proteins of mSrx and rSrx, which generated the respective full-length Srx protein as the main product (>95%) on cleavage with factor Xa (data not shown). The mouse and rat enzymes, either with or without the fused GST moiety, did not show instability on freezing and thawing. Assay of the Sulfinic Reductase Activity of Mammalian Srx with Antibodies Specific to Hyperoxidized Prx—We previously prepared antibodies to a sulfonylated (SO3H) peptide modeled on the active site sequence of mammalian 2-Cys Prx enzymes (15Woo H.A. Chae H.Z. Hwang S.C. Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Kim K. Rhee S.G. Science. 2003; 300: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). These antibodies (α-Prx-SO2) recognize sulfinylated and sulfonylated forms of Prx equally well and allow the immunoblot detection of sulfinic Prx I (Ox-Prx I) with high specificity in the presence of excess reduced Prx I (Re-Prx I). We therefore used these antibodies to monitor the reduction of Ox-Prx I (10 μm) by rSrx (1 μm) in the presence of ATP, an ATP-regenerating system (creatine phosphate, creatine kinase), Mg2+, and GSH. The immunoblot intensity of the band detected by α-Prx-SO2 gradually decreased with time of incubation with rSrx, whereas the intensity of the band detected with antibodies to Prx I remained unchanged (Fig. 2A). The rate of reduction of Ox-Prx I by Srx slowed gradually, but it was still possible to determine the initial rate by least squares linear regression analysis (typically with a correlation coefficient of >0.95). We also subjected the reduction reaction mixture both to two-dimensional PAGE (13Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Woo H.A. Hwang S.C. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38029-38036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), which separates the more acidic Ox-Prx I from Re-Prx I (Fig. 2B), and to a peroxidase assay, in which Prx-dependent H2O2 reduction is coupled to NADPH oxidation in the presence of Trx1 and TrxR (Fig. 2C). The results verified that the decrease in immunoblot intensity detected with α-Prx-SO2 was indeed attributable to the conversion of Ox-Prx I to Re-Prx I and was accompanied by the recovery of peroxidase activity. With the immunoblot assay, we measured the sulfinic reductase activity of GST-hSrx, hSrx-ΔN16, hSrx (immediately after purification), GST-rSrx, rSrx, GST-mSrx, and mSrx. The specific activities calculated from the initial rates were similar for all these mammalian recombinant enzymes (Fig. 3A), suggesting that neither attachment of GST nor deletion of 16 amino acids from the NH2 terminus had a substantial effect. The range of specific activities, 7–13 nmol/min/mg of protein, is equivalent to a turnover rate (kcat) of 0.1–0.18/min, indicating that the recombinant Srx proteins are highly inefficient enzymes. The reaction rate was also equally slow when measured with sulfinic Prx II as the substrate (data not shown). It was possible that the low enzymatic activity of the mammalian Srx proteins was an artifact of their recombinant nature. To examine this possibility, we partially purified Srx with a single hydrophobic chromatography step from an extract of human A549 cells. We did not purify the protein further because, like recombinant hSrx, it appeared to be unstable during storage. The partially purified protein (hSrx-A549) was assayed for Srx activity with the immunoblot assay. The amount of hSrx-A549 in the partially purified fraction was estimated from the immunoblot intensity obtained with antibodies to a peptide corresponding to the conserved COOH-terminal region of mammalian Srx enzymes. The specific activity of hSrx-A549 was found to be similar to that of rSrx (Fig. 3B), supporting the notion that mammalian Srx is truly an inefficient enzyme. Physiological Thiol Required for Sulfinic Reductase Activity of Srx—The reductase activity of yeast Srx requires a thiol electron donor such as DTT or Trx (17Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). We measured the activity of rSrx in the presence of several thiol donors including DTT, GSH, Trx1, a 14-kDa Trx-related protein (Trp14), and SpTrx. Trp14 contains a WCXXC motif like that of Trx but shares only 20% amino acid sequence identity with Trx (19Jeong W. Yoon H.W. Lee S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3142-3150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and SpTrx is a novel member of the Trx family of proteins that is expressed exclusively in spermatozoa and consists of a long NH2-terminal sequence of unknown function and a COOH-terminal sequence typical of thioredoxins (20Miranda-Vizuete A. Ljung J. Damdimopoulos A.E. Gustafsson J.A. Oko R. Pelto-Huikko M. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31567-31574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). With the exception of Trp14, all of these thiol donors exhibited similar activity with rSrx (Fig. 4A). The Srx reaction is predicted to generate a sulfinic phosphoryl ester (Cys-SO2-PO32–) intermediate as a result of phosphorylation of Cys-SO2H (17Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Although the active site cysteine of Trp14 is sufficiently nucleophilic and its redox potential is similar to those of other cellular thiol reductants, Trp14 likely is not able to support the Srx reaction probably because the negatively charged phosphorylated intermediate cannot approach the active site surface of Trp14, which appears to be highly negatively charged on the basis of the x-ray crystal structure (24Woo J.R. Kim S.J. Jeong W. Cho Y.H. Lee S.C. Chung Y.J. Rhee S.G. Ryu S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; : M407079200Google Scholar). To compare the efficacy of GSH and Trx, we analyzed the steady-state kinetics of the reactions supported by these two most abundant cellular thiol donors (Fig. 4, B and C). The Vmax values were identical (specific activity, 13 nmol/min/mg), and the Km values for Trx1 and GSH were 1.2 μm and 1.8 mm, respectively. Given that the intracellular concentrations in mammalian cells are in the range of 1–10 mm for GSH (25Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Raidals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 86-187Google Scholar) and 2–12 μm for Trx1 (26Holmgren A. Luthman M. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4071-4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), both GSH and Trx have the potential to be physiologically relevant electron donors for the Srx reaction. Nucleotide Specificity of Srx—We measured the sulfinic reductase activity of rSrx in the presence of various nucleotides. Reduction was supported by ATP but not by ADP or the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP (Fig. 5A). At 1 mm, GTP was as efficient as was ATP (Fig. 5B); in contrast, yeast Srx is not able to utilize GTP (17Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Compared with ATP and GTP, pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphates (CTP and UTP) were substantially less effective (Fig. 5B). Similarly, dATP and dGTP were effective, but dCTP and dTTP were far less so (Fig. 5C). The Km for AT"

High affinity transporters in the solute carrier SLC6A family function in removing monoamines from the neurosynaptic cleft. Emerging evidence suggests that these transporters are only one part of a system of transporters that work in concert to maintain brain homeostasis of monoamines. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a new human plasma membrane monoamine transporter, PMAT. The PMAT cDNA encodes a protein of 530 amino acid residues with 10–12 transmembrane segments. PMAT is not homologous to known neurotransmitter transporters but exhibits low homology to members of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter family. When expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes, PMAT efficiently transports serotonin (Km = 114 μm), dopamine (Km = 329 μm), and the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (Km = 33 μm). In contrast, there is no significant interaction of PMAT with nucleosides or nucleobases. PMAT-mediated monoamine transport does not require Na+ or Cl– but appears to be sensitive to changes in membrane potential. Northern blot analysis showed that PMAT is predominantly expressed in the human brain and widely distributed in the central nervous system.

These studies demonstrate that PMAT may be a novel low affinity transporter for biogenic amines, which, under certain conditions, might supplement the role of the high affinity transporters in the brain. In the central nervous system, monoamine neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, control a variety of physiological, behavioral, and endocrine functions (1Greengard P. Science. 2001; 294: 1024-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 2Carlsson A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1987; 10: 19-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Monoamine-mediated neurotransmission is also critically involved in a number of brain pathological processes such as Parkinson's disease, depression, schizophrenia, and drug addiction (1Greengard P. Science. 2001; 294: 1024-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 2Carlsson A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1987; 10: 19-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A key step that determines the intensity and duration of monoamine signaling is the transport of released monoamines into brain cells. This process is carried out by cell surface transporters that transport monoamines into presynaptic nerve terminals or neighboring glial cells where they can be recycled through repackaging into secretory vesicles or degraded by intracellular enzymes (3Amara S.G. Kuhar M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 73-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 4Torres G.E. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G. Nat. Rev.

Uptake of released monoamines into presynaptic neurons is mainly carried out by a family of Na+- and Cl–-dependent high affinity plasma membrane transporters, which includes the dopamine transporter (DAT), 1The abbreviations used are: DAT, dopamine transporter; ENT, equilibrative nucleoside transporter; KRH, Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit (buffer); MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; MPP+, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium; NET, norepinephrine transporter; OCT, organic cation transporter; PMAT, plasma membrane monoamine transporter; RT, reverse transcription; SERT, serotonin transporter; siRNA, small interfering RNA; SLC, solute carrier; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein. the serotonin transporter (SERT), and the norepinephrine transporter (NET) (3Amara S.G.

These transporters, which share high sequence similarity and belong to the solute carrier 6A (SLC6A) family, are the known targets for many psychostimulants, antidepressants, and neurotoxins (3Amara S.G. Kuhar M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 73-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 4Torres G.E. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G. Nat. Rev.

Several lines of evidence suggest that in addition to the SLC6A high affinity transporters (i.e. DAT, SERT, and NET), the brain expresses other transporters to regulate extracellular monoamine levels. First, a number of studies have described central nervous system monoamine uptake activities that exhibit properties distinct from the SLC6A high affinity transporters (6Mireylees S.E. Brammer N.T. Buckley G.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 4065-4071Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 7Inazu M. Kubota N. Takeda H. Zhang J. Kiuchi Y. Oguchi K. Matsumiya T.

Finally, recent studies from DAT and SERT knock-out mice also provide indirect evidence for the existence of alternative monoamine transporters in the brain (9Ravary A. Muzerelle A. Darmon M.

Simantov R. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2001; 126: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), or uptake by organic cation transporters (OCTs) (9Ravary A. Muzerelle A. Darmon M. Murphy D.L.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 35-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been proposed to explain these observations, an alternative could be that the brain expresses other monoamine transporters that have not yet been identified at the molecular level. In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of a novel plasma membrane monoamine transporter, PMAT. We show that PMAT is molecularly distinct from the classic monoamine transporters, is abundantly expressed in the human brain, and efficiently transports monoamine neurotransmitters. Our findings provide new insights into the complexity and potential compensatory mechanisms of regulating monoamine neurotransmitter levels in the brain. Cloning of PMAT—Using a BLAST search at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, we identified a hypothetical equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT)-like protein predicted by the human genome annotation project. Primers were designed to amplify a cDNA fragment from human kidney by RT-PCR. 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends were used to obtain the flanking region sequences as described previously (16Wang J. Su S.F. Dresser M.J. Schaner M.E. Washington C.B. Giacomini K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F1058-F1065PubMed Google Scholar). A pair of primers (5′-GAGAGGCTGCCATGGGCTCCGTGGGGAGC-3′ and 5′-CGGTCCTCGGAGGACTTTGCAGAACTTCAGTCC-3′) flanking the open reading frame were used to isolate the full-length cDNA from human kidney and brain by RT-PCR. BLAST was used in data base searching, and the Vector NTI Suite 8 software (InforMax, Frederick, MD) was used to analyze nucleotide and protein sequences. Northern Analysis—Human multiple tissue Northern blots (Clontech) were hybridized to a random primed 35S-dCTP-labeled cDNA fragment of PMAT for 16 h at 68 °C in PerfectHyb Plus hybridization buffer (Sigma) and washed under high stringency conditions (0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68 °C). Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) Construct and Fluorescence Microscopy—PMAT cDNA was subcloned into BglII and XbaI sites of the yellow fluorescence vector pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) and transfected into MDCK cells. Empty pEYFP-C1 vector was transfected into MDCK cells as a control. YFP positive cells were purified using the FACS Vantage S.E. flow cytometry sorter (BD Biosciences). Sorted cells were seeded on a chambered cover glass and visualized with a Leica Spectral confocal microscope. Expression and Functional Characterization in MDCK Cells—PMAT cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) and transfected into MDCK cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Stably transfected cell lines were obtained by G418 selection and cultured in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and G418 (200 μg/ml). For the transport experiments, cells were plated in 24-well plates and allowed to grow for 3 days. Transport assays were performed at 37 °C in Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit (KRH) buffer (5.6 mm glucose, 125 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing a 3H-labeled ligand. Uptake was terminated by washing the cells three times with ice-cold KRH buffer, and cells were solubilized and the radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Ascorbic acid (100 μm) and pargyline (10 μm) were present in experiments with monoamines to prevent oxidation. Sodium dependence was assessed in KRH buffer with isotonic replacement of NaCl with N-methyl-d-glucamine, whereas Cl– dependence was assessed in KRH buffer with chloride salts replaced by corresponding gluconate salts at equivalent molarity. Protein content in each uptake well was measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), and the uptake in each well was normalized to its protein content. The experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times, and results from the representative experiments are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. Kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear least-squares regression fitting as described previously (17Wang J. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2298-2302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Expression in Xenopus laevis Oocytes—cRNA of PMAT was synthesized and injected into defolliculated oocytes as described previously (17Wang J. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2298-2302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Uptake was measured on groups of 8–10 oocytes 2–3 days post-injection at 25 °C in transport buffer (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing a 3H-labeled ligand. Uptake was terminated by washing oocytes five times with ice-cold buffer. Individual oocytes were then solubilized in 10% SDS, and the radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. RNA Interference Study—Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) and Ambion (Austin, TX). The siRNA duplex with the sequences 5′-CAGCUUCAUCACGGACGUGtt-3′ (sense) and 5′-CACGUCCGUGAUGAAGCUGtt-3′ (antisense) was used (the lowercase letters represent the two-nucleotide overhang added artificially to the targeted sequence for RNA interference studies). Sense and antisense RNAs were annealed following the manufacturer's recommended procedures. The human astrocytoma cell line A172 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and PMAT- and vector-transfected MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. A172 cells were plated in 24-well plates at 3 × 104 cells/well, and PMAT- and vector-transfected MDCK cells were plated at 8 × 104 cells/well. Cells were grown for 24 h and then transfected with siRNA (40 pmol/well) using LipofectAMINE and OPTI-MEM I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen). Silencing was examined 48–72 h after transfection by uptake assays as described above. Control cells (i.e. mock cells) were treated with LipofectAMINE and OPTI-MEM I reduced serum medium without the siRNA. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed to examine PMAT mRNA expression using the PMAT-specific primers 5′-CGGGCGTGATGATCTCTCTGAGCCGC ATC-3′ and 5′-GGTTGAACACAGCCATGATGAGGATGGGCA-3′. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers (5′-CGTATTGGGCGCCTGGTCACCAGGGCTGCT-3′ and 5′-TTGAGGGCAATGC CAGCCCCAGCGTCGAAG-3′) were used as an internal control. Amplification conditions were 94° C for 1 min, 55° C for 1 min, and 72° C for 1 min. PMAT amplification was performed for 20 cycles for PMAT-transfected MDCK cells and for 36 cycles for A176 cells and vector-transfected MDCK cells. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase amplification was performed for 20 cycles for all samples. Cloning of PMAT—We initially identified PMAT from the draft human genome data base because of its sequence homology to ENTs (18Baldwin S.A. Beal P.R. Yao S.Y. King A.E. Cass C.E. Young J.D.

Using 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends and RT-PCR, we isolated a 2,112 base pair complementary DNA from human kidney poly(A)+ RNA. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 530 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 58 kDa (Fig. 1a). A BLAST search revealed that PMAT is not highly homologous to any known proteins and only exhibits low sequence identity (∼20%) to mammalian ENTs (SLC29A) (Fig. 1b). The PMAT gene was previously named human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 4(hENT4) and assigned to chromosome 7p22.1 (18Baldwin S.A. Beal P.R. Yao S.Y. King A.E. Cass C.E. Young J.D.

U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16899-16903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar). The deduced protein sequence of PMAT is identical to the hENT4 protein predicted from the human genomic DNA (GenBank™ accession number BK000627) (20Acimovic Y. Coe I.R. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 2199-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).

Gene orthologs of PMAT were also found in mouse (20Acimovic Y. Coe I.R. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 2199-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and rat. 2J. Wang, unpublished observation. Hydropathy analysis predicted the presence of 10–12 membrane-spanning domains in PMAT. An 11-transmembrane domain model is proposed in Fig. 1c. There is one potential N-linked glycosylation site (Asn-523), several putative protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (Ser-6, Ser-262, Ser-268, Ser-306, Ser-476, and Thr-338), and one cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site (Thr-199). Tissue Distribution—Expression of PMAT in various human tissues was examined by high stringency Northern blotting. A strong, single hybridization signal of 2.9 kb was detected in adult human brain and skeletal muscle (Fig. 2). Weak hybridization signals were also observed in kidney, heart, and liver. In the human brain, strong hybridization signals were found in all regions tested (cerebellum, cerebral cortex, medulla, occipital pole, frontal and temporal lobes, and putamen) and in the spinal cord (Fig. 2), suggesting that PMAT is widely distributed in the central nervous system. A BLAST search of the human expressed sequence tag data base also found PMAT expression in various brain regions and in cells of neuronal and glial origins. Membrane Localization—To determine whether PMAT is a plasma membrane or an intracellular transporter, we designed an expression construct that fused the YFP to the N terminus of PMAT. When expressed in MDCK cells and observed by confocal microscopy, the fusion protein was primarily localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3), suggesting that PMAT is a plasma membrane protein. Substrate Specificity—To ascertain the functional properties of PMAT, we used MDCK cells to establish a cell line stably expressing PMAT and screened a variety of radiolabeled compounds for uptake activity. Despite its sequence similarity to the equilibrative nucleoside transporters, PMAT does not significantly transport nucleosides and nucleoside analogs such as uridine, cytidine, thymidine, adenosine, inosine, guanosine, and azidothymidine (Fig. 4). There also was no significant uptake of nucleobases (e.g. uracil, cytosine, adenine, and hypoxanthine) or nucleotides (e.g. ATP). Instead, cells expressing PMAT exhibit a high transport activity for 3H-labeled 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) (Fig. 4), a neurotoxin that causes Parkinson's disease by selectively damaging dopaminergic nerve terminals. PMAT-mediated MPP+ uptake is time- and concentration-dependent with an apparent Michaelis constant (Km) of 33 ± 7 μm and a maximal transport rate (Vmax) of 2.8 ± 0.1 nmol per minute per milligram of protein (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Uptake of [3H]MPP+ by PMAT-transfected MDCK cells.a, time course of MPP+ (1 μm) uptake by PMAT and vector-transfected (control) cells. Vector-transfected cells (open circles) and PMAT-transfected cells (solid circles) were incubated at 37° C. b, concentration-dependent transport of [3H]MPP+. The PMAT-specific uptake was measured at 37° C for 1 min and calculated by subtracting the transport activity in control cells. Inset, Eadie-Hofstee plot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further define the substrate specificity of PMAT, we performed competition studies using [3H]MPP+ as the substrate. Several biogenic amines (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and histamine) significantly inhibited the [3H]MPP+ uptake (Fig. 6). The neurotransmitter acetylcholine also marginally inhibited PMAT-mediated [3H]MPP+ uptake. In contrast, various nucleosides, nucleobases, the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid, and other endogenous compounds exhibited no inhibitory effect (Fig. 6). Prototypical substrates of OCTs (e.g. tetraethylammonium and guanidine) and the organic anion transporters (e.g. p-aminohippuric acid) also did not significantly inhibit PMAT transport activity. These data indicate that PMAT mainly functions as a transporter for biogenic amines. We next tested whether biogenic amines are indeed substrates for PMAT by directly testing the uptake of radiolabeled compounds. At a substrate concentration of 1 μm and an incubation time of 1 min, PMAT-expressing MDCK cells showed 13- and 20-fold higher serotonin and dopamine uptake than did control cells (Fig. 7a). A 4- to 5-fold increase was also seen for norepinephrine and epinephrine. The increase in acetylcholine uptake is only ∼1.4-fold, suggesting that this neurotransmitter is a poor substrate for PMAT (Fig. 7a). To confirm that the observed enhanced uptake in MDCK cells was due to heterologous expression of PMAT, we also expressed PMAT in X. laevis oocytes. Compared with water-injected oocytes, oocytes injected with PMAT cRNA exhibited significantly enhanced uptake of MPP+, serotonin, and dopamine (Fig. 7b), further demonstrating that PMAT is a bona fide transporter for monoamines. Because of the sequence similarity of PMAT to the ENT transporters, the possibility that ENTs may as well transport monoamines was investigated. Cells stably transfected with the prototypic ENT transporter, human ENT1 (18Baldwin S.A. Beal P.R. Yao S.Y. King A.E. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Pflugers Arch. 2003; 447: 735-743PubMed Google Scholar, 22Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E. Davies A. Kwong F.Y. Coe I. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), showed no transport activity for MPP+ (data not shown), suggesting that there is no significant substrate overlap between PMAT and the ENTs. Together these data demonstrated that PMAT is functionally distinct from nucleoside transporters and has evolved, from the ENT gene family perhaps, to handle biogenic amines. Transport Kinetics—The transport kinetics of PMAT toward various monoamines was determined from initial rate studies (Fig. 8). PMAT-mediated monoamine uptake was saturable, and the kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) are summarized in Table I and compared with those of MPP+. Among the compounds tested, PMAT has the highest affinity for MPP+, followed by serotonin and dopamine and then by norepinephrine and epinephrine (Table I). Under the same experimental conditions, the apparent maximal transport velocities (Vmax) are significantly higher for the low affinity substrates. When the transport efficiency (Vmax/Km) was calculated and normalized to MPP+, PMAT exhibited comparable transport efficiencies for MPP+, serotonin, and dopamine, but much lower efficiencies for norepinephrine and epinephrine (Table I). The apparent affinities (Km) of PMAT for serotonin and dopamine are 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than those of SERT and DAT. However, compared with SERT or DAT stably expressed in MDCK or LLC-PK1 cells (23Gu H. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7124-7130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wu X. Gu H.H. Gene. 1999; 233: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the Vmax values of PMAT-mediated serotonin or dopamine transport are also 2–3 orders higher than the Vmax values of SERT or DAT. These data suggest that PMAT is a low affinity but high capacity transporter for serotonin and dopamine.Table IKinetic constants of PMATSubstrateKmVmaxVmax/Kmμmnmol/min/mg proteinMPP+33 ± 72.8 ± 0.11Serotonin114 ± 126.5 ± 0.20.67Dopamine329 ± 818.2 ± 0.20.65Norepinephrine2,606 ± 25820.6 ± 0.90.09Epinephrine15,323 ± 3,94738.4 ± 7.70.03 Open table in a new tab Ion Dependence—To determine the bioenergetics of PMAT-mediated transport, we investigated the effect of Na+ and Cl– gradients and membrane potential on PMAT-mediated MPP+ uptake. Replacement of Na+ or Cl– in the uptake medium had no effect on uptake activity (Fig. 9a), suggesting that PMAT-mediated transport does not involve a Na+ and Cl– cotransport mechanism. In contrast, depolarization of cells with increased extracellular K+ strongly reduced MPP+ uptake (Fig. 9b), indicating that transport is driven by the inside negative membrane potential. To exclude the possibility that the effect of K+ on PMAT could be a specific ionic effect, we conducted MPP+ uptake experiments in the presence of 10 mm barium with a normal extracellular K+ concentration. Barium is an effective potassium channel blocker that can greatly reduce membrane potential in MDCK cells (25Paulmichl M. Gstraunthaler G. Lang F. Pflugers Arch. 1985; 405: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 9c, barium substantially reduced PMAT-mediated MPP+ uptake at a low, normal, extracellular K+ concentration. These data suggest that the inhibitory effect of high external K+ on MPP+ uptake was unlikely due to a specific ion effect but rather related to changes in membrane potential. Interaction with Transport Inhibitors—To define the pharmacological properties of PMAT, we tested the sensitivity of PMAT to a number of known inhibitors of SERT, DAT, NET, and OCTs (Fig. 10). The calculated inhibition potencies (Ki) are summarized in Table II. Among the inhibitors tested, the cyanine dye decynium-22, an OCT inhibitor, had the highest inhibition potency (Ki = 0.10 μm). Yet, another potent OCT inhibitor, corticosterone, had no inhibitory effect at concentrations as high as 200 μm. The selective DAT inhibitor, GBR12935, inhibited PMAT with a Ki of 7.9 μm. The antidepressant drug fluoxetine (Prozac), a selective SERT inhibitor, and the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine, a potent inhibitor of both NET and SERT, only inhibited PMAT-mediated uptake at micromolar concentrations (Ki = 22.7 and 32.6 μm, respectively). The inhibition potencies of these inhibitors toward PMAT are 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than those for DAT, SERT, or NET, suggesting that PMAT is relatively insensitive to the high affinity inhibitors of the SLC6A monoamine transporters.Table IIInhibition potencies (Ki) of various compoundsInhibitorKiμmDecynium-220.10 ± 0.03GBR129357.9 ± 1.0Fluoxetine22.7 ± 6.1Desipramine32.6 ± 2.7Corticosterone450.5 ± 76.5 Open table in a new tab RNA Interference Study—To determine whether PMAT indeed plays a role in monoamine uptake in cells of brain origin, we performed siRNA studies in cultured human A172 astrocytoma cells. This cell line was chosen because it was derived from human brain, and we detected significant endogenous expression of PMAT mRNA by RT-PCR. Several double-stranded RNAs (21 bp) corresponding to different regions of PMAT cDNA were synthesized and tested for their ability to knock down PMAT expression in PMAT-transfected MDCK cells. Transfection of cells with one siRNA resulted in a significant and reproducible reduction in PMAT activity, as judged by serotonin uptake (∼63% decrease), with a corresponding reduction in PMAT mRNA expression level in transfected MDCK cells (Fig. 11). This siRNA was then used in A172 cells to test its effect on the cellular uptake of serotonin. In parallel with a reduced PMAT mRNA expression level in siRNA-treated A172 cells (Fig. 11a), a consistent decrease in serotonin uptake, ranging from 30–40%, was observed in cells treated with siRNA (Fig. 11b). These data indicate that the PMAT protein is produced in A172 cells and is functional in this cell line of human glial origin. However, because A172 is a cultured cancer cell line, the results obtained thus may not reflect what happens in vivo. In this study, we identified and characterized a novel human plasma membrane monoamine transporter that is abundantly expressed in the human brain and skeletal muscle. One surprising feature of PMAT is that the transporter is not related to known transporters that interact with monoamine neurotransmitters (i.e. SLC6A and OCTs) but belongs to the equilibrative nucleoside transporter family. Our data clearly demonstrated that, unlike the existing ENT members that mainly transport nucleosides and their structural analogs, PMAT specifically transports biogenic amines but does not interact with nucleosides and related compounds. The strong expression of PMAT mRNA in brain and skeletal muscle, tissues that are highly innervated by monoaminergic neurons, is consistent with its functional property. The characteristics of PMAT, such as Na+-independence, low affinity, and relative insensitivity to inhibitors of DAT, SERT, and NET coincide with earlier findings that described non SLC6A-mediated monoamine uptake activities in the brain (6Mireylees S.E. Brammer N.T. Buckley G.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 4065-4071Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 7Inazu M. Kubota N. Takeda H. Zhang J. Kiuchi Y. Oguchi K. Matsumiya T.

Neurosci. 2001; 13: 1349-1362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, PMAT may be responsible for some of these activities. Our results may also explain monoamine transport activities in brain regions that do not express the SLC6A high affinity transporters or in mice where these transporters are deleted by gene knock out. Additionally, the significant expression of PMAT in skeletal muscle suggests that this transporter may also play a role in sympathetic clearance of norepinephrine. The functional properties of PMAT seem to complement those of the SLC6A monoamine transporters. Whereas SERT, DAT, and NET function as Na+- and Cl–-dependent high affinity transporters, PMAT-mediated transport is Na+- and Cl–-independent and is of low affinity and high capacity in nature. It has been suggested that synaptic concentrations of neurotransmitters can transiently reach high concentrations in the millimolar range (26Bunin M.A. Wightman R.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4854-4860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where the high affinity transporters would be saturated. Under such conditions, PMAT, which saturates at much higher concentrations, may play an important role in neurotransmitter transport. Additionally, under conditions where the classic SLC6A transporters are inhibited pharmacologically, such as chronic use of antidepressants, PMAT may serve as a backup system for monoamine clearance. However, it is critical to point out that we have no direct evidence that PMAT participates in monoamine inactivation in brain or skeletal muscle. It is also possible that PMAT functions as a transporter for an unknown substrate that has yet not been assayed. Further investigations such as extensive substrate screening, detailed brain localization, and gene knock out studies are needed to elucidate the in vivo role of PMAT. Previously, members of the OCT family (SLC22A) have been shown to transport monoamines in a Na+-independent manner (27Koepsell H. Endou H. Pflugers Arch. 2003; 447: 666-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). A prominent member is OCT3, also known as the extraneuronal monoamine transporter. OCT3 transports epinephrine and norepinephrine with low affinities but does not transport serotonin or dopamine well (28Grundemann D. Schechinger B. Rappold G.A. Schomig E. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 349-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 29Wu X. Kekuda R. Huang W. Fei Y.J. Leibach F.H. Chen J. Conway S.J. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32776-32786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). OCT3 is mainly expressed in the placenta, heart, and liver and only weakly expressed in the human brain (28Grundemann D. Schechinger B. Rappold G.A. Schomig E. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 349-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 30Wu X. Huang W. Ganapathy M.E. Wang H. Kekuda R. Conway S.J. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F449-F458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, OCT3 may contribute to epinephrine and norepinephrine transport in localized brain regions. Taken together, the central nervous system seems to employ a complex transport system consisting of both high affinity transporters (DAT, SERT, and NET) and low affinity transporters (PMAT and OCT3) to transport monoamines over a wide concentration range. Brain disorders such as Parkinson's disease, depression, and drug addiction affect millions of people worldwide. Although the exact causes are unclear, the progression and treatment of these disorders are often associated with alteration of monoamine neurotransmitter levels in the central nervous system. Thus, the identification of a novel transport mechanism for monoamine neurotransmitters may provide opportunities to develop new drugs for the treatment of brain disorders.

Endothelial cell activation is mediated by many different extra-cellular signals, which result in overlapping yet distinct patterns of gene expression. Here we show, in DNA microarray analyses, that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and thrombin result in dramatic and rapid upregulation of Down syndrome critical region (DSCR)-1 gene encoding exons 4–7, a negative feedback regulator of calcium-calcineurin-NF-AT signaling. VEGF- and thrombin-mediated induction of DSCR-1 involves the cooperative binding of NF-ATc and GATA-2/3 to neighboring consensus motifs in the upstream promoter. Constitutive expression of DSCR-1 in endothelial cells markedly impaired NF-ATc nuclear localization, proliferation, and tube formation. Under in vivo conditions, overexpression of DSCR-1 reduced vascular density in matrigel plugs and melanoma tumor growth in mice. Taken together, these findings support a model in which VEGF- and thrombin-mediated induction of endothelial cell proliferation triggers a negative feedback loop consisting of DSCR-1 gene induction and secondary inhibition of NF-AT signaling. As a natural brake in the angiogenic process, this negative pathway may lend itself to therapeutic manipulation in pathological states.

The endothelium is highly malleable cell layer, constantly responding to changes within the extracellular environment and responding in ways that are usually beneficial, but at times harmful, to the organism.

The tight control of these processes is essential for homeostasis; endothelial cell activation, if excessive, sustained, or spatially and temporally misplaced, may result in vasculopathic disease. Under normal conditions, the activation signal may be terminated by negative feedback inhibition of downstream transcriptional networks. Such a mechanism has been well established for TNF-α (1Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar, 2Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D.

Sugiyama A. Wu S.Q. Abid R. Kodama T. Aird W.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thrombin signaling in the endothelium is mediated by a family of seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors, termed protease activated receptors (PAR) (16Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar). Currently, four members of the PAR family have been identified (PAR-1 to PAR-4). Of the various PAR family members, PAR-1 is the predominant thrombin receptor in endothelial cells (17O'Brien P.J. Prevost N. Molino M. Hollinger M.K. Woolkalis M.J. Woulfe D.S. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13502-13509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Once activated, PAR-1 is linked to a number of signal intermediates that include, but are not limited to, MAPK, protein kinase C, PI3K, and Akt (15Minami T. Sugiyama A. Wu S.Q. Abid R. Kodama T.

To identify such factors, we compared DNA microarray analyses of VEGF and thrombin-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). We found that under both conditions, the most highly induced gene was DSCR-1. The DSCR-1 gene (also known as MCIP-1), designated as such because it resides within the Down syndrome critical region of human chromosome 21, encodes a protein that binds to and inhibits the catalytic subunit of calcineurin (19Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that DSCR-1 acts as a “circuit breaker” in VEGF and thrombin signaling, serving in a negative feedback loop to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation and activation as well as angiogenesis. These results provide new insights into endothelial cell signaling and point to DSCR-1 as a potential therapeutic target for anti-angiogenesis and anti-inflammatory therapy.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Cell Culture—VEGF and TNF-α were obtained from Peprotec (Rocky Hill, NJ). Human thrombin, cyclosporine A, and SU1498 were obtained from Calbiochem. Hirudin and thrombin receptor activation peptide (TRAP; SFLLRNPNDKYEPF) were from Wako chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Human placenta growth factorPlGF) was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). HUVEC were grown in endothelial growth medium-2-MV (EGM-2-MV) BulletKit (Clonetics, San Diego, CA). HUVEC were used within the first eight passages. Mouse B16-melanoma cells (JCRB-0202) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum.Microarray Analysis—HUVEC were serum-starved overnight in medium containing EGM-2 and 0.5% fetal bovine serum and then treated with 50 ng/ml VEGF or 1.5 units/ml thrombin. RNA was harvested and purified with Trizol according to manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Preparation of cRNA and hybridization of probe arrays were performed according to the protocols of the manufacturer (Affimetrix, Santa Clara, CA).RNase Protection Assays and Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)— HUVEC were serum-starved in EBM-2 medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. 18 h later, HUVEC were pretreated for 30 min with cyclosporin A or SU1498 at the doses indicated or infected with adenovirus at multiplicity of infection = 40 and then incubated in the absence or presence of either 50 ng/ml VEGF, 1.5 units/ml thrombin, 10 ng/ml TNF-α, or 50–200 ng/ml PlGF. RNase protection assays were performed with a RPA III kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For RT-PCR, a Superscript First-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) was used with 5 μg of total RNA. Forward and reverse primers and amplification cycles as follows: Tissue factor (22 cycles), 5′-TCAGAGTTTTGAACAGGTGGGAACA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTCTCCTGGCCCATACACTCTACCG-3′ (reverse); E-selectin (22 cycles), 5′-CATGTGGAGCCACAGGACACTGGTCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCTGATTCAAGGCTTTGGCAGCTGCTG-3′ (reverse); angiopoietin-2 (20 cycles), 5′-ACAAATGTATTTGCAAATGTTCACAAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAAATCTGCTGGTCGGATCATCATGGT-3′ (reverse); PlGF (20 cycles), 5′-CCGGTCATGAGGCTGTTCCCTTGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCGCTGGGGTACTCGGACACGAC-3′ (reverse); P27 (26 cycles), 5′-CGCAGGAATAAGGAAGCGACCTGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGTTTGACGTCTTCTGAGGCCAGGCTT-3′ (reverse); P21 (18 cycles), 5′-AGCAAGGCCTGCCGCCGCCTCTTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGACAGGTCCACATGGTCTTCCTC-3′ (reverse); ADAMTS1 (20 cycles), 5′-AGCTTTCTTGCCATCAAAGCTGCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-A ACCTGGATGGTCAAGGGCTCTTT-3′ (reverse); interleukin-8 (23 cycles), 5′-TGTCAGTGCATAAAGACATACTCCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTTCTCCACAACCCTCTGCACCCAG-3′ (reverse); ICAM-1 (23 cycles), 5′-GTGCAAGAAGATAGCCAACCAATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGGAGTCGTTGCCATAGGTGACTG-3′ (reverse); cyclophilin A (23 cycles), 5′-TTCGTGCTCTGAGCACTGGAGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGACCCGTATGCTTTAGGATGAAG-3′ (reverse).Transfections and Analysis of Luciferase Activity—HUVEC were transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (20Minami T. Aird W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47632-47641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The serum-starved transfected cells were preincubated for 30 min with 1 μm cyclosporine A and then incubated with 50 ng/ml VEGF or 1.5 units/ml thrombin for 6 h.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Nuclear extracts purification and EMSAs were prepared as described previously (21Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). To test the effect of antibodies on DNA-protein binding, nuclear extracts were preincubated with antibodies of NF-ATc, NF-ATp (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO), GATA-2, -3, or -6 (Perseus Proteomics, Tokyo, Japan) for 30 min at room temperature.FACS Analysis—Ad-DSCR-1-, Ad-Control-, or Ad-DSCR-1 plus Ad-CANFAT-infected HUVEC were scraped, spun down for 5 min at 100 × g, re-suspended in PBS containing with 0.2% Triton X, and stained in 25 μg/ml propidium iodide and 50 ng/ml RNase A. Cells were counted on a FACS Calibur using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences), and the percentages of cells in the G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle were determined using ModFit LT software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME).Immunolocalization Studies—HUVEC were plated onto glass coverslips (Matsunami Glass, Osaka, Japan) in a 6-well plate at a density of 25,000 cells/slide. The cells were treated in the presence or absence of 1 unit/ml thrombin or 50 ng/ml VEGF for 1 h, fixed in ice-cold 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed with PBS, and subsequently incubated with primary anti-NF-ATc antibody (Affinity BioReagents). Following extensive washes in PBS, the cells were incubated with an Alexa-Fluor 594-labeled secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h. The slides were then washed in PBS, mounted in Crystal/Mount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA) with Hoechst (Sigma) for identification of nuclear localization, and examined by fluorescence microscopy. The degree of nuclear localization was quantified with NIH image.Tube Formation Assays—400-μl aliquots of type-I collagen gel (Koken, Tokyo, Japan) containing EGM-2-MV medium without basic fibroblast growth factor were used as described previously (22Minami T. Murakami T. Horiuchi K. Miura M. Noguchi T. Miyazaki J. Hamakubo T. Aird W.C. Kodama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20626-20635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVEC infected with Ad-Control or Ad-DSCR-1 were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well and incubated for 24 h in 5% CO2. The medium was removed, and HUVEC were covered with 400 μl of the gel. Cells were incubated with 1 ml of EGM-2-MV medium in the absence of basic fibroblast growth factor. Two days later, a branched capillary network was visualized under a microscope. Images from at least three different areas in each well were captured by a digital camera under a microscope.Matrigel Plug Assays—Matrigel (BD Biosciences) containing 50 ng of VEGF and either 109 plaque-forming units of Ad-Control, Ad-DSCR-1, or Ad-DSCR-1 plus Ad-CA-NFAT was injected subcutaneously into C57BL6 mice. After 14 days, matrigel plugs were removed for histological sections. Alternatively, the matrigel plugs were weighed and homogenized at 4 °C. The hemoglobin content was assayed with a Drabkin's reagent kit 525 (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Solid Tumor Model—1 × 106 logarithmically growing B16-melanoma cells were implanted subcutaneously into the right hind flank of C57BL6 mice. When the tumor reached about 50 mm3 in volume, it was injected with 5 × 109 plaque-forming units of Ad-DSCR-1 or Ad-Control. Tumor volume (mm3) was determined using length × width × height × 0.52 after caliper measurement.RESULTSDSCR-1 Is the Most Highly Induced Gene in VEGF- and Thrombin-treated Primary Human Endothelial Cells—Endothelial cell activation is not an all-or-none response. Indeed, different extra-cellular mediators engage the endothelium in ways that differ from one signal to the next. A major focus is to study the temporal and spatial dynamics of endothelial cell phenotypes. Using DNA microarrays, we carried out a global survey of mRNA in HUVEC treated in the absence or presence of growth factor (VEGF), serine protease (thrombin), or cytokine (TNF-α). Clustering analyses of the data revealed a far closer relationship between VEGF and thrombin than between other pairings (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table I). Of the various transcripts that were responsive both to VEGF and thrombin, DSCR-1 was the most highly induced at the earliest time point. At 1 h, VEGF resulted in 22.3-fold induction of DSCR-1, while thrombin induced DSCR-1 by 17.7-fold (Fig. 1B). The effect of VEGF and thrombin was no longer detectable at 24 and 18 h, respectively. Compared with VEGF and thrombin, TNF-α treatment of HUVEC resulted in far less induction of DSCR-1 (3.2-fold at 1 h) (supplemental Table I and data not shown).VEGF and Thrombin Selectively Induce the DSCR-1 Isoform Consisting of Exons 4–7 in Primary Human Endothelial Cells—The DSCR-1 gene includes seven exons and six introns. The first four exons are alternative and code for four different isoforms (23Fuentes J.J. Pritchard M.A. Estivill X. Genomics. 1997; 44: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 24Yang J. Rothermel B. Vega R.B. Frey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: E61-E68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 5′ promoter regulates expression of the first three isoforms, which are derived from alternative splicing. The most common of these contains exons 1, 5, 6, and 7. An intragenic region between exons 3 and 4 contains an alternative promoter which initiates transcription of the fourth isoform (exons 4, 5, 6, and 7) (Fig. 2A) (24Yang J. Rothermel B. Vega R.B. Frey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: E61-E68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine which isoform(s) is up-regulated by VEGF and thrombin, we performed RNase protection assays using riboprobes that span either exons 4 and 5 or exons 1 and 5 (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2C, the addition of VEGF or thrombin to HUVEC resulted in marked up-regulation of the DSCR-1 isoform encoded by exons 4–7, with maximal levels occurring at 1 h. In contrast, there was no detectable induction of the DSCR-1 isoform encoded by exons 1, 5, 6 and 7 (Fig. 2C, asterisk). Consistent with the DNA microarray data, TNF-α resulted in comparatively low levels of DSCR-1 induction. To determine whether DSCR encoding exons 1, 5, 6, and 7 is expressed in endothelial cells and to further test its inducibility, RT-PCR assays were performed using isoform-specific primers and cDNA from control or VEGF-, thrombin-, or TNF-α-treated HUVEC. Transcripts were detected only after 40 cycles of amplification and were not affected by the addition of extracellular mediators at 1 or 4 h. By comparison, the isoform encoded by exons 4–7 was detected in thrombin- and VEGF-treated HUVEC after just 21 PCR cycles (Fig. 2D). Together, these results suggest VEGF and thrombin and to a far lesser extent TNF-α result in the rapid and selective induction of the DSCR-1 isoform containing exons 4–7.Fig. 2DSCR-1 isoform consisting of exons 4–7 was selectively induced with VEGF and thrombin treatments in primary human endothelial cells.A, schematic representation of the human DSCR-1 gene. The mRNA consists of four alternative first exons (boxes 1–4) followed by three common exons (boxes 5–7). The broken line indicates the putative splicing isoforms. Shown are the two major DSCR-1 isoforms, DSCR-1 (exon 4–7) and DSCR-1 (exon 1567). B, schematic representation of the riboprobe used to distinguish the two DSCR-1 isoforms in RNase protection assays. The bold line indicates the protected fragment and the broken line the RNase-digested region. C, RNase protection assays were performed with [α-32P]UTP-labeled 361-bp riboprobe as shown in B and either 10 μg of yeast RNA (lane 2), 10 μg of total RNA from control (lane 3), VEGF-treated (lanes 4–6), thrombin-treated (lanes 7–9), or TNF-α-treated (lanes 10–12) HUVEC. The arrow indicates the protected fragment (280 bp) from the DSCR-1 (exon 4–7) isoform; the asterisk indicates the expected length (130 bp) from the DSCR-1 (exon 1567) isoform. An [α-32P]UTP-labeled human GAPDH riboprobe was hybridized with total RNA as an internal control. D, RT-PCR was performed with either DSCR-1 (exons 4–7) or DSCR-1 (exon 1567) isoform-specific primers, using RNA from control (-) and thrombin-, VEGF-, or TNF-α-treated HUVEC and 21- or 40-cycle amplification. GAPDH-specific primers were included as an internal control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)VEGF and Thrombin Induce DSCR-1 Expression in Primary Human Endothelial Cells via Flk-1/KDR and PAR-1, Respectively—VEGF has two high affinity receptors, Flt-1 and Flk-1/KDR. To determine which receptor mediates VEGF stimulation of DSCR-1, HUVEC were treated with the selective Flt-1 agonist, PlGF, or with VEGF in the absence or presence of the Flk-1/KDR selective inhibitor, SU1498. The addition of 50–200 ng/ml PlGF failed to induce DSCR-1 mRNA (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, VEGF-mediated induction of DSCR-1 was attenuated by pretreatment with 5 and 20 μm SU1498, by 74.2 and 84.4%, respectively (Fig. 3A, lanes 4–6). As an internal control for PlGF activity in HUVEC, agonist-treated endothelial cells were assayed for Flt-1 phosphorylation, using immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 3B, the addition of 100 ng/ml PlGF resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt-1. Taken together, these data suggest that VEGF increases DSCR-1 mRNA in endothelial cells through a Flk-1/KDR-dependent mechanism.Fig. 3VEGF-Flk-1/KDR- and thrombin-PAR1-mediated up-regulation of DSCR-1 mRNA.A, RT-PCR of DSCR-1 in HUVEC treated with 50 ng/ml PlGF (lane 2), 200 ng/ml PlGF (lane 3), pretreated with 5 μm SU1498 (lane 5), 20 μm SU1498 (lane 6), and treated in the absence (-) or presence (+) of 50 ng/ml VEGF for 1 h. Cyclophilin A-specific primers were added as an internal control. B, immunoprecipitation assays were performed in HUVEC treated with 100 ng/ml PlGF for 0, 5, 15, and 30 min. Total HUVEC lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) using anti-Flt-1 antibody, then immunoblotted (IB) with anti-phosphotyrosine antiboby (pTyr). The same blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-Flt-1 antibody (Flt-1). IgG is shown as a loading control. C, RNase protection assays were performed with either no RNA (lane 1, Probe), 10 μg of yeast RNA (lane 3), or 10 μg of total RNA from control HUVEC (lane 4), thrombin-treated HUVEC pretreated in the absence (lane 5) or presence of 0.5 and 5 units of hirudin (lanes 6 and 7, respectively) or HUVEC treated with 10 or 50 pmol of TRAP (lanes 8 and 9, respectively). Human GAPDH was used as an internal control. D, quantification of RNase protection assays. Densitometry was used to calculate the ratio of DSCR-1 and GAPDH signals (arbitrary relative expression level). Mean and S.D. values were derived from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Thrombin is known to signal through protease-activated receptors (PARs). PAR-1 is the most important thrombin receptor in endothelial cells. To demonstrate a potential role for PAR-1 in mediating the thrombin response, we employed RNase protection assays of HUVEC treated in the presence or absence of TRAP, a 14-amino acid PAR-1 agonist peptide. TRAP resulted in a dose-dependent increase in DSCR-1 mRNA levels. Moreover, thrombin-mediated induction of DSCR-1 was completely blocked by pretreatment with the thrombin-specific inhibitor, hirudin (Fig. 3, C and D). Taken together, these findings suggest that VEGF and thrombin mediate DSCR-1 induction in endothelial cells via Flk-1/KDR and PAR-1, respectively.VEGF- and Thrombin-induced DSCR-1 mRNA and Promoter Activity in Primary Human Endothelial Cells via a Calcineurin-dependent Signaling Pathway—Previous studies in non-endothelial cells have demonstrated an important biological role for DSCR-1 as a regulator of calcium-calcineurin-NF-AT signaling (25Wang Y.

To determine whether VEGF- and thrombin-mediated induction of DSCR-1 in endothelial cells is similarly dependent on calcineurin, we employed RNase protection assays with the calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporine A (CsA). VEGF-mediated induction of DSCR-1 was inhibited 64.1% by 10 nm CsA and 93.3% by 1 μm CsA (Fig. 4A, lanes 6–8). Similarly, thrombin stimulation of DSCR-1 was inhibited by pretreatment with 10 nm and 1 μm CsA (by 72.6 and 93.1%, respectively) (Fig. 4A, lanes 9–11). Next, we wished to determine whether the DSCR-1 promoter contained information for transducing the VEGF/thrombin-calcineurin-dependent signal. To that end, the human DSCR-1 promoter (-1664 to +83) was isolated and coupled to the luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 4B). The resulting DSCR-1-luc plasmid was transiently transfected into HUVEC. As shown in Fig. 4C, VEGF and thrombin induced DSCR-1 promoter activity by 3.2- and 2.6-fold, respectively, whereas TNF-α had no such effect. VEGF- and thrombin-mediated induction of the promoter was inhibited by 1 μm CsA (90.7 and 96.3%, respectively). Taken together, these results indicate that both VEGF-Flk-1/KDR and thrombin-PAR-1 signals induce DSCR-1 mRNA and promoter activity through a calcineurin-dependent pathway.Fig. 4The NF-AT and GATA motif is necessary for mediating VEGF and thrombin stimulation of DSCR-1 mRNA and promoter in endothelial cells.A, RNase protection assays were employed with either no RNA (lane 1, Probe), 10 μg of yeast RNA (lane 3), or 10 μg of total RNA from untreated HUVEC (lanes 4 and 5), VEGF-treated HUVEC (lanes 6–8), or thrombin-treated HUVEC (lanes 9–11), preincubated in the absence (-) or presence of 10 nm CsA (lanes 7 and 10) or 1 μm CsA (lanes 5, 8, and 11). GAPDH antisense riboprobe was hybridized with total RNA as an internal control. The results are representative of three independent experiments. B, schematic shows the deletion and/or mutant DSCR-1 promoter constructs. C, HUVEC were transiently transfected with the DSCR-1 (-1664/+83)-luc plasmid and exposed to 50 ng/ml VEGF, 1.5 units/ml thrombin, or 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 6 h in the absence (-) or presence of 1 μm CsA. The results show the mean and S.D. of luciferase light units (relative to untreated and minus CsA cells) obtained in triplicates from at least three independent experiments. D and E, HUVEC were transiently transfected with deletion and/or mutant constructs and exposed to 50 ng/ml VEGF or 1.5 units/ml thrombin for 6 h. Each plasmid was co-transfected with pRL-SV40 to normalize for transfection efficiency. Promoter activities were determined relative to the normalized activity from DSCR-1 (-1664/+83)-luc plasmid in untreated cells (D) or each untreated control (E). F, HUVEC were transiently transfected with (NF-AT)4-TATA-luc plasmid and exposed to 50 ng/ml VEGF, 1.5 unit/ml thrombin, or 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 6 h.

https://openalex.org/W2067199502,"The dominant mechanism for creating large irreversible strain in atomic crystals is the motion of dislocations, a class of line defects in the crystalline lattice. Here we show that the motion of dislocations can also be observed in strained colloidal crystals, allowing detailed investigation of their topology and propagation. We describe a laser diffraction microscopy setup used to study the growth and structure of misfit dislocations in colloidal crystalline films. Complementary microscopic information at the single-particle level is obtained with a laser scanning confocal microscope. The combination of these two techniques enables us to study dislocations over a range of length scales, allowing us to determine important parameters of misfit dislocations such as critical film thickness, dislocation density, Burgers vector, and lattice resistance to dislocation motion. We identify the observed dislocations as Shockley partials that bound stacking faults of vanishing energy. Remarkably, we find that even on the scale of a few lattice vectors, the dislocation behavior is well described by the continuum approach commonly used to describe dislocations in atomic crystals."
https://openalex.org/W2033573667,"Chronic exposure to elevated free fatty acids (lipotoxicity) induces uncoupling protein (UCP2) in the pancreatic β-cell, and therefore a causal link between UCP2 and β-cell defects associated with obesity may exist. Recently, we showed that lipid treatment in vivo and in vitro in UCP2(–/–) mice/islets does not result in any loss in β-cell glucose sensitivity. We have now assessed the mechanism of maintained β-cell function in UCP2(–/–) mice by exposing islets to 0.4 mm palmitate for 48 h. Palmitate treatment increased triglyceride concentrations in wild type (WT) but not UCP2(–/–) islets because of higher palmitate oxidation rates in the UCP2(–/–) islets. Dispersed β-cells from the palmitate-exposed WT islets had reduced glucose-stimulated hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential compared with both control WT and palmitate-exposed UCP2(–/–) β-cells. The glucose-stimulated increases in the ATP/ADP ratio and cytosolic Ca2+ are attenuated in palmitate-treated WT but not UCP2(–/–) β-cells. Exposure to palmitate reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in WT islets, whereas UCP2(–/–) islets had enhanced GSIS. Overexpression of recombinant UCP2 but not enhanced green fluorescent protein in β-cells resulted in a loss of glucose-stimulated hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential and GSIS similar to that seen in WT islets exposed to palmitate. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to increase the activity of UCP2. We showed that ROS levels were elevated in control UCP2(–/–) islets as compared with WT and UCP2(–/–) islets overexpressing UCP2 and that palmitate increased ROS in WT and UCP2(–/–) islets overexpressing UCP2 but not in UCP2(–/–) islets. Thus, UCP2(–/–) islets resisted the toxic effects of palmitate by maintaining glucose-dependent metabolism-secretion coupling. We propose that higher free fatty acid oxidation rates prevent accumulation of triglyceride in UCP2(–/–) islets, such accumulation being a phenomenon associated with lipotoxicity.

In the pancreatic β-cell, glucose is metabolized by glycolysis producing pyruvate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), both of which are transported into the mitochondria where pyruvate is metabolized by the tricarboxylic acid cycle to produce NADH and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2). Both cytosolic and mitochondrial sources of NADH along with mitochondrial FADH2 stimulate the electron transport chain (complexes I–IV) to pump H+ ions out of the mitochondrial matrix, thereby hyperpolarizing the inner mitochondrial membrane and generating the proton-motive force used to generate ATP by ATP synthase (1Erecinska M. Bryla J. Michalik M. Meglasson M.D. Nelson D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 273-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial ATP production from glucose is the key modulator of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), 1The abbreviations used are: GSIS, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion; UCP, uncoupling protein; WT, wild type; HFD, high fat diet; FFA, free fatty acids; ROS, reactive oxygen species; Δψm, mitochondrial membrane potential; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone; KRBH, Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate-HEPES; TG, triglycerides; DCF, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Rh123, rhodamine 123; MnTBAP, Mn(III) tetrakis-(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein. and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism has been estimated to produce 98% of β-cell ATP (1Erecinska M. Bryla J. Michalik M. Meglasson M.D. Nelson D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 273-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The members of the uncoupling protein (UCP) family are involved in regulating cellular ATP production and are localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane (2Boss O. Hagen T. Lowell B.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Uncoupling protein-1, -2, and -3 share a high degree of homology and are expressed in a tissue-specific manner (3Klingenberg M. Huang S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 271-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Data from several laboratories support a role for UCPs as “typical” uncouplers (4Echtay K.S. Winkler E. Klingenberg M. Nature. 2000; 408: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 5Echtay K.S. Roussel D. St Pierre J. Jekabsons M.B. Cadenas S. Stuart J.A. Harper J.A. Roebuck S.J. Morrison A. Pickering S. Clapham J.C. Brand M.D. Nature. 2002; 415: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar) that modulate the efficiency of ATP production (3Klingenberg M. Huang S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 271-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) by catalyzing the translocation of protons across the mitochondrial membrane to reduce the proton-motive force (4Echtay K.S. Winkler E. Klingenberg M. Nature. 2000; 408: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 5Echtay K.S. Roussel D. St Pierre J. Jekabsons M.B. Cadenas S. Stuart J.A. Harper J.A. Roebuck S.J. Morrison A. Pickering S. Clapham J.C. Brand M.D. Nature. 2002; 415: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). Moreover, UCP2 mediates proton leak within the normal environment of intact cells (6Krauss S. Zhang C.Y. Lowell B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). UCP2 is the only known uncoupling protein expressed in pancreatic β-cells (7Chan C.B. MacDonald P.E. Saleh M.C. Johns D.C. Marban E. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The human UCP2 promoter polymorphism –866 G/A is associated with a greater risk of obesity in Caucasians (8Esterbauer H. Schneitler C. Oberkofler H. Ebenbichler C. Paulweber B. Sandhofer F. Ladurner G. Hell E. Strosberg A.D. Patsch J.R. Krempler F. Patsch W. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Type 2 diabetic patients homozygous for the –866A allele polymorphism require a higher frequency of insulin treatments and have significantly lower glucose-induced insulin secretion (9Sasahara M. Nishi M. Kawashima H. Ueda K. Sakagashira S. Furuta H. Matsumoto E. Hanabusa T. Sasaki H. Nanjo K. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Individuals with the –866 A/A genotype also have enhanced UCP2 transcriptional activity and elevated UCP2 expression (10Sesti G. Cardellini M. Marini M.A. Frontoni S. D'Adamo M. Del Guerra S. Lauro D. De Nicolais P. Sbraccia P. Del Prato S. Gambardella S. Federici M. Marchetti P. Lauro R. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1280-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Human islets isolated from –866 A/A donors have lower GSIS than those isolated from –866 G/A heterozygous and G/G homozygous individuals (10Sesti G. Cardellini M. Marini M.A. Frontoni S. D'Adamo M. Del Guerra S. Lauro D. De Nicolais P. Sbraccia P. Del Prato S. Gambardella S. Federici M. Marchetti P. Lauro R. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1280-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, increased UCP2 expression in individuals with the homozygous –866 A allele is associated with a reduction in oxidative stress and coronary heart disease (11Dhamrait S.S. Stephens J.W. Cooper J.A. Acharya J. Mani A.R. Moore K. Miller G.J. Humphries S.E. Hurel S.J. Montgomery H.E. Eur. Heart J. 2004; 25: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These human studies suggest that the variation seen in insulin secretion from individual to individual may be in part due to the –866 G/A UCP2 promoter polymorphism and that increased UCP2 can attenuate GSIS by altering substrate oxidation. Induction of pancreatic β-cell UCP2 in vivo and in vitro has a negative impact on GSIS, likely by limiting increases in ATP production following dissipation of the proton gradient generated by glucose metabolism (12Hong Y. Fink B.D. Dillon J.S. Sivitz W.I. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Joseph J.W. Koshkin V. Zhang C.Y. Wang J. Lowell B.B. Chan C.B. Wheeler M.B.

What regulates UCP2 and the physiological role of this protein in the pancreatic β-cell are not well understood. It is known that free fatty acids (FFA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase the expression and activity of UCP2 (5Echtay K.S. Roussel D. St Pierre J. Jekabsons M.B. Cadenas S. Stuart J.A. Harper J.A. Roebuck S.J. Morrison A. Pickering S. Clapham J.C. Brand M.D. Nature. 2002; 415: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar, 15Echtay K.S. Murphy M.P. Smith R.A. Talbot D.A. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47129-47135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This is an important interaction because increased FFA metabolism leads to an increase in energy flux through the electron transport chain, which can lead to an increase in the production of ROS in β-cells (16Carlsson C. Borg L.A. Welsh N. Endo. 1999; 140: 3422-3428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Barbu A. Welsh N. Saldeen J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 190: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). UCP2 may be involved in this interaction by limiting the FFA-stimulated increase in ROS production by dissipating the excess energy (15Echtay K.S. Murphy M.P. Smith R.A. Talbot D.A. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47129-47135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). However, ROS-mediated activation of UCP2 is now thought to be an important determinant of impaired GSIS (18Krauss S. Zhang C.Y. Scorrano L. Dalgaard L.T. St Pierre J. Grey S.T. Lowell B.B. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1831-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). We propose that UCP2 may play a protective role in the β-cell by mitigating the consequences of excess FFA- and glucose-induced ROS production. However, in protecting from ROS the increased β-cell UCP2 activity down-regulates GSIS. Previously, we used a well characterized in vivo model in which mice were treated with a high fat diet (HFD) for 4.5 months, and we found that UCP2(–/–) mice were resistant to the effects of a HFD in terms of β-cell function. To understand the cellular responses of UCP2(–/–) β-cells to FFA, we utilized a well known in vitro model of lipotoxicity in which isolated islets or dispersed β-cells were treated with control medium or medium containing 0.4 mm palmitate for 48 h (6Krauss S. Zhang C.Y. Lowell B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 13Joseph J.W. Koshkin V. Zhang C.Y. Wang J. Lowell B.B. Chan C.B. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3211-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We then examined a number of key metabolic parameters involved in GSIS including insulin content, FFA metabolism, mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP/ADP ratio, cytosolic Ca2+ changes, and insulin secretion. We showed that UCP2(–/–) islets had no alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP/ADP ratio, and cytosolic Ca2+ responses after palmitate treatment, whereas wild type (WT) islets showed dysfunctional responses. We also found that palmitate did not increase ROS in UCP2(–/–) β-cells. Therefore UCP2(–/–) mice maintained robust glucose-dependent metabolism-secretion coupling after FFA exposure that reverted to a WT islet phenotype after UCP2 overexpression in UCP2(–/–) islets. Reagents—Carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP), ATP sulfurylase, pyruvate kinase, collagenase type V and type XI, ATP luciferase, d-luciferin, ATP, and ADP were all purchased from Sigma. Animals—Male UCP2 (WT) or UCP2 knockout (–/–) mice at 4 months of age were used in the present study and were bred from lines generated as described previously (13Joseph J.W. Koshkin V. Zhang C.Y. Wang J. Lowell B.B. Chan C.B. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3211-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 14Zhang C.Y. Baffy G. Perret P. Krauss S. Peroni O. Grujic D. Hagen T.

For the HFD studies, half of the mice were placed on either a control diet (rodent diet 8664, Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) or a HFD (D12451, Research Diets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ). The fat source was lard, comprising 45% of the total calories. The mice remained on the HFD or control diet for 4.5 months (13Joseph J.W. Koshkin V. Zhang C.Y. Wang J. Lowell B.B. Chan C.B. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3211-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests were performed as described previously (14Zhang C.Y. Baffy G. Perret P. Krauss S. Peroni O. Grujic D. Hagen T. Vidal-Puig A.J. Boss O. Kim Y.B. Zheng X.X. Wheeler M.B. Shulman G.I. Chan C.B. Lowell B.B. Cell. 2001; 105: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Plasma insulin levels were determined using a rat insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Crystal Chem, Chicago, IL). Adenoviral Vectors—Adenoviral vectors used in these studies are described elsewhere and include adenovirus expressing UCP2 (AdUCP2) (12Hong Y. Fink B.D. Dillon J.S. Sivitz W.I. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), adenovirus expressing enhanced yellow fluorescent protein driven by the rat insulin promoter-2 (AdRIP2EYFP) (19Kang G.X. Joseph J.W. Chepurny O.G. Monaco M. Wheeler M.B. Bos J.L. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Holz G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8279-8285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and adenovirus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter (AdEGFP) (7Chan C.B. MacDonald P.E. Saleh M.C. Johns D.C. Marban E. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was used as a control for the overexpression of UCP2 using AdUCP2. Real-time PCR Analysis of UCP2 mRNA Expression—UCP2 mRNA levels were detected by real-time PCR as described (13Joseph J.W. Koshkin V. Zhang C.Y. Wang J. Lowell B.B. Chan C.B. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3211-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Briefly, UCP2- and GAPDH-specific fluorescent probes were obtained from Biosearch Technologies Inc. (Novato, CA) (13Joseph J.W. Koshkin V. Zhang C.Y. Wang J. Lowell B.B. Chan C.B. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3211-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). UCP2 and GAPDH expression levels were measured simultaneously using a Taqman Universal PCR master mix and an ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Branchburg, NJ). All mRNA levels were quantified using a standard curve of a known amount of mouse cDNA (cDNAs were created from forward and reverse primers (13Joseph J.W. Koshkin V. Zhang C.Y. Wang J. Lowell B.B. Chan C.B. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3211-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar)). All cDNA PCR products that were used in the standard curve were purified using a MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The real-time PCR conditions were 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, and then 40 cycles for 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 53 °C. UCP2 mRNA levels were corrected for GAPDH levels by dividing UCP2 mRNA levels by GAPDH mRNA levels. There were no differences in GADPH levels between treatments. Western Blot Analysis of UCP2 Protein Expression—Ambient and virally induced expression of UCP2 was assessed by immunoblotting. UCP2 was detected using goat anti-UCP2 antibody (Research Diagnostic Inc., 1:400), and the secondary antibody was peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat (Jackson Immunoresearch, 1:5000). Pancreatic Islet Isolation—Pancreatic islets were isolated as described previously (13Joseph J.W. Koshkin V. Zhang C.Y. Wang J. Lowell B.B. Chan C.B. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3211-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 14Zhang C.Y. Baffy G. Perret P. Krauss S. Peroni O. Grujic D. Hagen T. Vidal-Puig A.J. Boss O. Kim Y.B. Zheng X.X.

Diabetes. 1967; 16: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2492) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pancreatic duct was perfused with 3 ml of collagenase (3 mg/ml). The pancreas was then chopped into 2-mm pieces and digested by shaking (50 rpm) for 10–15 min at 37 °C. Islets were partially isolated by sedimentation and then hand picked from the acinar tissue debris. Islet Dispersion—Freshly isolated islets were incubated for 8–9 min at room temperature in Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate-HEPES (KRBH) buffer with 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 5.6 mm glucose. KRBH buffer contained (in mm) 118 NaCl, 4.4 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 1.5 KH2PO4, 5 NaHCO3, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. Islets were further incubated in KRBH buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, trypsin (25 μg/ml, Sigma), and DNase I (2 μg/ml, Sigma) at 37 °C for 9 min with gentle pipetting every 2 min. The cells were washed twice in the islet culture medium RPMI (Roswell Park Memorial Institute) supplemented with 5.6 mm glucose, 0.25% HEPES (Sigma), 20 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 20 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen). Cells were then plated onto collagen-coated glass cover slips and allowed to attach overnight in islet culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Islet and Dispersed β-Cell Culture—Islets and dispersed β-cells were preincubated for 24 h in islet culture medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and then transferred to control medium (culture medium with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 0.25% (w/v) bovine serum albumin without free fatty acids (Sigma)) or palmitate medium (control medium with 0.4 mm palmitate) for 48 h. In some experiments using UCP2(–/–) islets or dispersed β-cells, UCP2 was reintroduced using AdUCP2 at the beginning of the 48-h culture period at a multiplicity of infection of 5 × 103. Islet Triglyceride Measurements—Triglycerides (TG) were extracted from groups of 100 islets by lipid extraction in a chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v) mixture as described elsewhere (21Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Briaud I. Harmon J.S. Kelpe C.L. Segu V.B. Poitout V. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). For the assay, the dry material derived from evaporation of the chloroform phase was resuspended in water in the presence of a detergent (Thesit or polidocanol (Sigma) 20% w/v in chloroform). TGs were measured enzymatically with a commercial kit (GPO Trinder; Sigma). Triolein (Sigma), which was dissolved in chloroform/methanol and processed similarly to samples, was used as the standard. Islet β-Oxidation—Palmitate oxidation in isolated islets was measured as described previously (23Chen S.Y. Ogawa A. Ohneda M. Unger R.H. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In brief, 50 islets per condition were incubated in KRBH experimental medium containing 2.8 or 22 mm glucose, 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 0.8 mm carnitine, and 1 μCi of [14C]palmitate (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 37 °C in an orbital water bath (100 cycles/min). The reaction was stopped by the addition of perchloric acid, and the evolved 14CO2 was captured with hyamine hydroxide with shaking for an additional 2 h. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Imaging—Glucose-induced changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) were quantified in dispersed β-cells. After the 48-h treatment period, cells were loaded with rhodamine 123 (2.6 μm Rh123 for 15 min) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Fluorescence was excited at 490 nm and measured at 530 nm. All membrane potential measurements were done at 37 °C. Images were captured and analyzed using the Merlin software (Olympus America, Life Sciences Resources, Melville, NY) as described elsewhere (13Joseph J.W. Koshkin V. Zhang C.Y. Wang J. Lowell B.B. Chan C.B. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3211-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 24Smukler S.R. Tang L. Wheeler M.B. Salapatek A.M. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3450-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Exposure time was 0.2 s, and images were acquired at ∼0.2 Hz. Rh123 is a fluorescent lipophilic cationic dye that specifically partitions into negatively charged mitochondrial membranes. Under these Rh123 loading conditions, hyperpolarization of the Δψm as seen after nutrient stimulation results in an increase in the Rh123 concentration in the mitochondrial membrane, leading to an aggregation of dye molecules and quenching of the fluorescence signal. Conversely, depolarization of Δψm allows the dye to redistribute from the mitochondria into the cytosol, resulting in an increase of the Rh123 signal (25Drucker D.J. Campos R. Reynolds R. Stobie K. Brubaker P.L. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Changes in fluorescence from 2.8 to 20 mm glucose were determined by comparison with the average base-line fluorescence over the first 50 s, which was arbitrarily assigned a value of 1.0. Assessment of the glucose-induced changes was done by averaging data between 500–700 s and comparing the normalized values to the base line. At the end of an experiment 1 μm FCCP was added to assess cell viability and to test the ability of the cell loaded with Rh123 to respond to changes in the Δψm induced by the chemical uncoupler. Islet GSIS, ADP, and ATP Determination—Groups of 25 islets were preincubated in experimental medium for two sequential 30-min periods at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Islets were then incubated for 2 h at the indicated glucose concentration (either 2.8 or 16.7 mm glucose) to assess insulin secretion. Islet DNA and insulin secretion measurements were performed as described previously (13Joseph J.W. Koshkin V. Zhang C.Y. Wang J. Lowell B.B. Chan C.B. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3211-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Islet ATP and ADP content was determined using these same islets at the end of the 2-h incubation period using the method of Tornheim and co-workers (26Schultz V. Sussman I. Bokvist K. Tornheim K. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 215: 302-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In brief, islet ATP and ADP were extracted from the 25 islets with 20 units of 10% (w/v) perchloric acid. After centrifugation, the supernatants were neutralized with 2 n KOH, 0.5 m triethanolamine and then freeze-dried (SpeedVac). Aliquots of each deproteinized sample were assayed for ATP directly with luciferase (Sigma). Other aliquots were treated with ATP sulfurylase in the presence of molybdate to hydrolyze the endogenous ATP to AMP and PPi. After boiling the samples to inactivate the sulfurylase, ADP was then converted to ATP with pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate for measurement with luciferase. Islet Insulin Content Measurements—At the end of a GSIS experiment and after extracting ATP and ADP, insulin was solubilized from the perchloric acid protein pellet by adding 0.5 n NaOH and heating to 60 °C for 10 min and then neutralized with 2 n HCl. Insulin secretion and insulin content were determined as described previously (27Brubaker P.L. Lee Y.C. Drucker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20728-20733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Brubaker P.L. So D.C.Y. Drucker D.J. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 3003-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ca2+Imaging—Ca2+ imaging was performed on dispersed β-cells plated on collagen-coated cover slips. Data collection was performed with the same equipment used for Rh123 imaging. After dispersion, cells were infected with AdRIP2EYFP and then cultured with either control or palmitate medium for 48 h. Cells were then loaded with 1 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) for 45 min at 37 °C. β-Cells were identified using the fluorescence of the EYFP driven by the rat insulin promoter (excitation 490 nm, emission 530 nm). Experiments were performed at 37 °C. Images were obtained with 340- and 380-nm excitation and a 510-nm cutoff emission filter. Exposures lasted 0.2 s, and images were acquired at ∼0.2 Hz. Images were collected and analyzed using the Merlin software (13Joseph J.W. Koshkin V. Zhang C.Y. Wang J. Lowell B.B. Chan C.B. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3211-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Data were averaged, and the standard error of the mean was plotted for data points every 40 s. Reactive Oxygen Species—ROS were detected in islets using 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF) (Sigma). Islets were loaded with 10 μm dye in KRBH buffer (containing 5.6 mm glucose) for 20 min at room temperature. Fluorescence of oxidized dye, reflecting cellular oxidation status, was measured with the equipment used for rhodamine 123 imaging (excitation/emission wavelengths 495/530 nm) in KRBH buffer in the presence of 5.6 mm glucose. Images were collected in 30-s intervals with 150-ms exposures and minimal intensity of exciting light. Islet ROS was quantified using standard curves obtained with solutions of the oxidized probe DCF. Statistics—Statistical significance was assessed by using either Student's t test or one-way or two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures followed by multiple Bonferroni comparisons. All data are expressed as means ± S.E. Islet Triglyceride, β-Oxidation, and Insulin Content—Increased islet TG are associated with an inhibition of GSIS. To ascertain the effects of a HFD on islet TG levels in vivo, mice were fed a HFD for 4.5 months (13Joseph J.W. Koshkin V. Zhang C.Y. Wang J. Lowell B.B. Chan C.B. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3211-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To confirm our previous results, where enhanced insulin secretion in UCP2(–/–) mice was observed after a HFD, an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed. Both basal and glucose-stimulated (10 min after intraperitoneal injection of glucose) insulin levels were significantly higher in UCP2(–/–) mice on the control or the HFD (Fig. 1A). There was no difference in islet TG concentrations between islets from WT and UCP2(–/–) mice on the control diet (Fig. 1B). After HFD treatment, WT islets had increased TG content compared with UCP2(–/–) islets (Fig. 1B). No detectable UCP2 mRNA or protein levels could be identified in UCP2(–/–) mouse islets infected with either no virus or a control adenovirus (AdEGFP) or when treated with 0.4 mm palmitate (data not shown). Culture of WT islets in 0.4 mm palmitate for 48 h increased UCP2 mRNA expression levels 8-fold over WT control medium-treated islets (UCP2/GAPDH ratio of 0.0372 ± 0.0013 versus 0.0047 ± 0.0001, respectively). UCP2 protein levels were also increased in palmitate-treated WT islets (Fig. 2A). In UCP2(–/–) islets, AdUCP2 increased UCP2 mRNA expression levels 435-fold over WT control medium-treated islets (UCP2/GAPDH ratio of 2.030 ± 0.2891 versus 0.0047 ± 0.0001, respectively). AdUCP2 increased UCP2 protein levels in UCP2(–/–) islets as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 2A). In the in vitro study in which islets were exposed to 0.4 mm palmitate for 48 h, islet TG content was not different between the groups of islets (WT, UCP2(–/–), and UCP2(–/–) overexpressing UCP2) treated with control medium (Fig. 2B).

Using an assay for ATP hydrolysis, we identified and screened small molecules with structural similarity to 15-deoxyspergualin and NSC 630668-R/1 for their effects on endogenous and Hsp40-stimulated Hsp70 ATPase activity. Several of these compounds modulated Hsp70 ATPase activity, consistent with the action of NSC 630668-R/1 observed previously (Fewell, S. W., Day, B. W., and Brodsky, J. L. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 910–914). In contrast, three compounds inhibited the ability of Hsp40 to stimulate Hsp70 ATPase activity but did not affect the endogenous activity of Hsp70. Two of these agents also compromised the Hsp70/Hsp40-mediated post-translational translocation of a secreted pre-protein in vitro. Together, these data indicate the potential for continued screening of small molecule Hsp70 effectors and that specific modulators of Hsp70-Hsp40 interaction can be obtained, potentially for future therapeutic use.

The constitutively expressed and stress-inducible 70-kDa heat shock proteins Hsc70 and Hsp70, respectively, are ubiquitous molecular chaperones that bind and release polypeptides in an ATP-dependent cycle. These chaperones contain three interdependent domains, which are a highly conserved 44-kDa N-terminal ATPase domain, an 18-kDa peptide binding domain, and a 10-kDa C-terminal helical lid domain (1Chappell T.G. Konforti B.B. Schmid S.L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 746-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Flaherty K.M. Deluca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B.

The lid domain gates the polypeptide binding pocket in an ATP-dependent fashion such that when ATP is bound in the N-terminal domain, the peptide binding channel is exposed and Hsp70s exhibit fast on and off rates for substrate binding. Transient interactions with peptide can stimulate ATP hydrolysis, triggering a conformational change in the chaperone (6Schmid D. Baici Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 7McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). This increases the affinity of Hsp70s for peptides by closing the lid domain on the peptide binding pocket and trapping bound substrates (8Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Rapoport T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Ultimately, peptide substrates are released concomitant with the exchange of ADP for ATP. Hsp70 function is regulated by and often dependent upon Hsp40 co-chaperones, which are defined by their homology to the DnaJ chaperone in Escherichia coli. Hsp40s stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp70s and, thus, stabilize the Hsp70-peptide complex. An ∼70-amino acid “J domain” defines the Hsp40 family and interacts with the ATPase domain of Hsp70 (for review, see Ref. 9Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Other regions in Hsp40 chaperones might interact with Hsp70 near its peptide binding domain (10Suh W.-C.

Because they are involved in protein folding and quality control, Hsp70 and Hsp40 co-chaperone functions represent a therapeutic target for human diseases caused by protein folding defects, such as cystic fibrosis (23Brodsky J.L.

Fang S.L. Xiao Y.F. O'Connor S.P. Nadler S.G. Lee D.W. Jefferson D.M. Kaplan J.M. Smith A.E. Cheng S.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C171-C178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Rubenstein R.C. Zeitlin P.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 278: C259-C267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Combined with modulators that enhance the activity of ΔF508-CFTR at the plasma membrane (30Yang H. Shelat A.A. Guy R.K. Gopinath V.S. Ma T. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Taddei A. Folli C. Pedemonte N. Galietta L.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol.

Hsp70 and Hsp40 also contribute to tumorigenesis (31Jolly C. Morimoto R.I. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 32Beere H.M. Green D.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 6-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Several unique tumor types exhibit elevated expression of these chaperones (33Ciocca D.R.

Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 873-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and overexpression of Hsp70 alone can lead to cellular transformation (37Volloch V.Z. Sherman M.Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3648-3651Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and tumorigenesis (38Seo J.S. Park Y.M. Kim J.I. Shim E.H. Kim C.W. Jang J.J. Kim S.H. Lee W.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, lowering the level of Hsp70 using antisense technology inhibits the proliferation of breast cancer cells by inducing apoptosis (39Nylandsted J. Rohde M. Brand K. Bastholm L. Elling F. Jaattela M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7871-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In addition, some viral oncogenes recruit cellular Hsp70 to inactivate growth control checkpoints (40Sullivan C.S. Pipas J.M. Virology. 2001; 287: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The large T antigen (TAg) of the DNA tumor virus, simian virus 40 (SV40), contains a J domain that stimulates Hsp70 to rearrange multiprotein complexes involved in cell cycle regulation (41Sullivan C.S. Cantalupo P. Pipas J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6233-6243Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus, modulators of Hsp70 and Hsp40 activity might also serve as anti-cancer drugs. Three compounds that modulate the ATPase activity of Hsp70 have been described. One compound, 15-deoxyspergualin (DSG), binds Hsp70 (KD = 4 μm) and stimulates its steady-state ATPase activity by 20–40% (42Nadler S.G. Eversole A.C. Tepper M.A. Cleaveland J.S. Ther. Drug Monit. 1995; 17: 700-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 43Brodsky J.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). DSG is currently being used in clinical trials to combat the rejection of transplanted kidneys (44Tanabe K. Tokumoto T. Ishikawa N. Shimizu T. Okuda H. Ito S. Shimmura H. Inui M. Harano M. Ohtsubo S. Manu M. Shiroyanagi Y. Yagisawa T. Fuchinoue S. Toma H. Transplant. Proc. 2000; 32: 1745-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and has been shown in vitro to modestly facilitate the trafficking of ΔF508-CFTR to the plasma membrane (28Jiang C. Fang S.L. Xiao Y.F. O'Connor S.P. Nadler S.G. Lee D.W. Jefferson D.M. Kaplan J.M. Smith A.E. Cheng S.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C171-C178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second compound that bears structural similarity to DSG was identified, NSC-630668-R/1 (designated R/1), which inhibits the endogenous and Hsp40-stimulated ATPase activity of Hsp70 by 48 and 51% (45Fewell S.W. Day B.W. Brodsky J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 910-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). R/1 also prevents the translocation of a pre-protein into yeast ER-derived vesicles, a process that requires cytosolic and lumenal Hsp70 and Hsp40 co-chaperones (45Fewell S.W. Day B.W. Brodsky J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 910-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Finally, 3′-sulfogalactolipids bind the ATPase domain of Hsp70 (46Mamelak D. Lingwood C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 449-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and inhibit the endogenous and Hsp40-stimulated steady-state ATPase cycle (47Whetstone H. Lingwood C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1611-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Given the importance of Hsp70-Hsp40 function on cellular physiology, it is imperative that additional modulators with unique properties be discovered. To this end we identified and then biochemically screened structural analogs of DSG and R/1 for their effects on the endogenous and Hsp40-stimulated ATPase activity of a yeast Hsp70. We employed a sensitive assay to measure the rate of Hsp70 ATP hydrolysis in the presence or absence of the different compounds and for the first time obtained unique classes of chaperone modulators. Identification and Synthesis of DSG/NSC 630668-R/1 Analogs— After computational comparison of the DSG and R/1 structures (Fig. 1 (45Fewell S.W. Day B.W. Brodsky J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 910-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)), analogs were identified by sub-structural analogy searches against libraries of compounds resident in the Developmental Therapeutics Program at the National Cancer Institute and in the University of Pittsburgh Center for Chemical Methodologies and Library Development. The following compounds were obtained from the Developmental Therapeutics Program: NSC 624392, NSC 624393, NSC 624903, NSC 624904, NSC 624905, NSC 624906, NSC 624907, NSC 624908, NSC 625194, NSC 625195, NSC 625512, NSC 625513, NSC 632006, and NSC 655302. The synthesis of SC-ααδ9 was previously described (48Wipf P. Cunningham A. Rice R.L. Lazo J.S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The ML2 and MAL3 series of compounds were prepared by Ugi and Biginelli reactions. The one-pot cyclocondensation of β-ketoesters 1, aromatic aldehydes 2, and urea 3 was performed in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature in the presence of catalytic amounts of HCl (49Wipf P. Cunningham A. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995; 36: 7819-7822Crossref Scopus (314) Google Scholar) or by heating in N,N-dimethylformamide to give heterocycle 4 (Fig. 2A). Although yields depended strongly on the substitution pattern and ranged from 33 to 84% for 4a-4e, purities determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (TIC MSD) were excellent and uniformly exceeded 90%. Subsequently, the N-1-substitued Biginelli dihydropyrimidinones 4a-4e were subjected to a second multicomponent reaction, the Ugi condensation (50Domling A. Ugi I.I. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2000; 39: 3168-3210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Studer A. Jeger P. Wipf P. Curran D.P. J. Org. Chem. 1997; 62: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Although standard thermal conditions provided disappointing conversions in this reaction, microwave conditions using the CEM Discover™ Microwave reactor were more successful. A stirred solution of 4a-e and amine in methanol was treated with aldehyde and n-butyl or isocyanide at room temperature. The mixture was then heated twice at 70 °C for 20–30 min in the microwave reactor. The MAL3 Ugi-Biginelli products were purified by column chromatography and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Finally, samples were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and stored at 4 °C. Structure-Activity Analysis—A computational conformational analysis was performed on R/1 using the Boltzman jump stochastic search method in Cerius2 (v.4.5 Accelrys, Inc.). Because R/1 is a very flexible molecule with many rotatable bonds, we decomposed the molecular model of R/1 into fragments containing 4–7 rotatable bonds and assumed that the minimum energy structure obtained for each was a good local approximation of the structure in the corresponding region of the whole molecule. Conformational energies were computed using Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF94) with no cutoffs. The resulting minimum energy conformer obtained for R/1 suggested that the presence of two carbamic ester moieties equally distributed between the two uracil rings (separated by six methylene groups) allows for the possibility of hydrogen bonding between the carbamic ester moieties and the hydrogen donors/acceptors from the uracil substituents and also hydrophobic interactions between the hydrocarbon chains that separate the two carbamic ester moieties from each other and from the uracil groups. These hydrophobic interactions may promote the packing of the hydrocarbon chain into a low energy conformer. Molecular mechanics-minimized models of the 31 test compounds were aligned with the hypothetical structure of R/1 described above using Cerius2 (for example, see Fig. 2B). These aligned structures and the activity data were then used to define descriptors for the dataset, including steric, electrostatic and hydrogen donor/acceptor fields along with dipole moment and ClogP descriptors. ATPase Measurements—Yeast Hsp70 (Ssa1p), Ydj1p, and SV40 large TAg were purified as described previously (22Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol.

Assays that approximate single turnover measurements of endogenous Hsp70 ATPase activity were performed at 30 °C on pre-formed [α32P]ATP-Hsp70 complexes according to published methods (21Sullivan C.S.

Biol. 1997; 265: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μg of Hsp70 was incubated with 100 μCi of [α32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 3000 Ci/mmol) on ice for 30 min in Complex buffer (100 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 300 mm KCl, 80 mm magnesium acetate) and 25 μm ATP in a final volume of 100 μl (Step 1, Fig. 3A). After this incubation, the [α32P]ATP-Hsp70 complex was purified from free [α32P]ATP on a NICK G-50 column (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C (Step 2, Fig. 3A). Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 10%, and 25-μg aliquots (∼0.6 μm Hsp70) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C no longer than 3 weeks. To assay ATP hydrolysis, individual aliquots were rapidly thawed and added to an equal volume of Complex buffer containing test compounds or Me2SO pre-equilibrated to 30 °C (Step 3, Fig. 3A). The final concentration of Hsp70 was ∼0.2–0.3 μm in these reactions. At the specified time points, 6-μl aliquots were removed and added to 2 μl of stop solution (2 m LiCl, 4 m formic acid, 36 mm ATP) on ice to quench ATP hydrolysis. Aliquots of each reaction time point were spotted onto thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates to determine the percentage of ATP hydrolyzed to ADP·Pi (21Sullivan C.S. Tremblay J.D. Fewell S.W. Lewis J.A. Brodsky J.L. Pipas J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5749-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 45Fewell S.W. Day B.W. Brodsky J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 910-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Data were obtained using different preparations of Hsp70. ATP turnover rates were calculated by using Kaleidagraph software (version 3.0.4) to fit the data to the single exponential equation,%Product=A×(1−exp(−kt))+C (Eq. 1) where the sum of the amplitude (A) represents the % of enzyme active sites that hydrolyze ATP to ADP·Pi, k is the rate of ATP hydrolysis in s-1, t is time in seconds, and the constant term (C) estimates the % of enzyme active sites that hydrolyze ATP to ADP·Pi at time 0 of the assay but also takes into account any contaminating ADP from the purchased isotope. Because ATP hydrolysis is rate-limiting for Hsp70s (7McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), this experiment provides an approximation of the first-order rate constant for ATP hydrolysis. In assays to which co-chaperones were added, 1 μg of TAg or 0.5 μg of Ydj1p (final concentrations of ∼0.2 μm) was incubated with the [α32P]ATP-Hsp70 complex for 60 s at 30 °C before the addition of drug or Me2SO unless indicated otherwise. ATP hydrolysis rates were calculated using the equation described above from data obtained at the 60-s time point and beyond. However, it should be noted that because Ydj1p has been shown to increase the dissociation of ATP from purified ATP-Hsp70 complexes by ∼10-fold (55Ziegelhoffer T. Lopez-Buesa P. Craig E.A. J. Biol.

TAg ATPase Assays—Steady-state measurements of TAg ATPase activity were performed at 30 °C in 20-μl reactions containing 1 μg of TAg (0.56 μm) and 0.1 μCi of [α32P]ATP in 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μm ATP, and 2.5% (v/v) Me2SO or 0.3 mm MAL3-90 or MAL3-101. Aliquots were quenched and analyzed as described above for Hsp70 ATPase assays. Purified T antigen mutant 5031 was a kind gift from J. Pipas (University of Pittsburgh). In Vitro Translocation Assays—The synthesis and translocation of wild type and an unglycosylated form of yeast prepro-α-factor (ppαF and ΔG-ppαF, respectively) into yeast ER-derived vesicles were performed using published methods (45Fewell S.W. Day B.W. Brodsky J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 910-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 57McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. J.

Rose M.D. Schekman R.W. Cell. 1992; 69: 353-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Translocation reactions were preincubated with the indicated compounds or Me2SO for 10 min on ice before addition of an ATP-regenerating system. Translocation efficiency was determined by calculating the percent of trypsin-resistant, signal sequence-cleaved (and for wild type, glycosylated) pαF relative to the total amount of ppαF and pαF in reactions lacking trypsin. In Me2SO-containing control reactions, 20–30% of the input ppαF is typically converted to pαF. The relative translocation efficiencies were determined by dividing the translocation efficiency of the MAL3-39- and MAL3-101-containing reactions by the efficiency in the Me2SO-containing control reactions. Identification of Novel Modulators of Hsp70 ATPase Activity—Based upon their structural similarity to R/1 and DSG, we identified and obtained 31 small molecules (molecular weight range 314–1040; see Table I). Compound R/1 is comprised of two uracil (2,4-pyrimidinedione) ring systems connected by a linker containing two N-substituted carbamic ester moieties, each holding two hydrogen bond acceptors and one hydrogen bond donor (Fig. 1). In addition, the substitutions at position 5 on the uracil rings also contain three hydrogen bond acceptors and one donor. Therefore, we sought compounds that would follow similar but non-identical ring, linker, and H-bonding capacities. Several closely related compounds were found by sub-structural searching of the Developmental Therapeutics Program data base at the National Cancer Institute: NSC 625512, NSC 625513, NSC 625194, NSC 625195, NSC 624908, NSC 624905, NSC 624904, NSC 624393, NSC 624906, and NSC 624903. The NSC compounds selected have one or two uracil rings with substituents bearing hydrogen bond donors or acceptors. Compounds with the ML and MAL prefix were obtained from the University of Pittsburgh Center for Chemical Methodologies and Library Development and have 2-dihydropyrimidinone rings with differing substituents (see “Materials and Methods” for synthesis; Fig. 2A). These substituents contain amide links instead of carbamic ester links found in R/1. The amide systems also contain hydrogen bond donor or acceptor features. The effect of SC-ααδ9, a Cdc25 phosphatase inhibitor (59Rice R.L. Rusnak J.M. Yokokawa F. Yokokawa S. Messner D.J. Boynton A.L. Wipf P. Lazo J.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15965-15974Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), was also examined, although there was no significant structural similarity with R/1 and DSG.Table IEffects of DSG and R/1 analogs on the rate of Hsp70 ATP hydrolysis ATPase assays were carried out as described under “Materials and Methods” with the indicated concentrations (0.1, 0.3, and 0.6 mm) of each compound. The rates of ATP hydrolysis were calculated using the formula % product = A × (1-exp(-kt)) + C, where the sum of the amplitude (A) represents the percentage of enzyme sites that hydrolyze ATP, k is the rate constant in s-1, t is time in seconds, and the constant term (C) estimates the percentage of enzyme sites that hydrolyze ATP at time 0.

Complexes of Hsp70 and [α-32P]ATP were formed on ice and purified from free [α-32P]ATP by gel filtration at 4 °C. The resulting [α32P]ATP-Hsp70 complexes were then incubated at 30 °C in the presence of the desired compound or solvent (Me2SO), and the conversion of Hsp70-bound ATP to ADP·Pi was monitored by thin layer chromatography (Fig. 3A). Because the radiolabeled ATP-Hsp70 complexes were purified from unbound nucleotide, this procedure estimates the rate of ATP hydrolysis and is more specific and sensitive than steady-state experiments that measure the full cycle of ATP binding, hydrolysis, and nucleotide exchange; however, the reader is referred to other studies in which these parameters were measured (see for example Refs. 7McCarty J.S.

These checkpoint responses involve the activation of signaling pathways that inhibit the replication of chromosomes with DNA lesions. In this study, we describe the isolation of a cDNA encoding a full-length version of Xenopus ATM. Using antibodies against the regulatory domain of ATM, we have identified the essential replication protein Mcm2 as an ATM-binding protein in Xenopus egg extracts. Xenopus Mcm2 underwent phosphorylation at Ser92 in response to the presence of double-stranded DNA breaks or DNA replication blocks in egg extracts. This phosphorylation involved both ATM and ATR, but the relative contribution of each kinase depended upon the checkpoint-inducing DNA signal. Furthermore, both ATM and ATR phosphorylated Mcm2 directly at Ser92 in cell-free kinase assays. Immunodepletion of both ATM and ATR abrogated the checkpoint response that blocks chromosomal DNA replication in egg extracts containing double-stranded DNA breaks. These experiments indicate that ATM and ATR phosphorylate the functionally critical replication protein Mcm2 during both DNA damage and replication checkpoint responses in Xenopus egg extracts.

In eukaryotic cells, various checkpoint control mechanisms guard the integrity of the genomic DNA throughout the cell cycle (for reviews, see Refs. 1Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 2Osborn A.J. Elledge S.J. Zou L.

Genet. 2002; 36: 617-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). For example, early in the cell cycle, these regulatory pathways block the entry into S phase if the genomic DNA suffers various types of damage. In cells that already have entered S phase, other checkpoint responses act to block further replication by inhibiting elongation at existing forks and by preventing the firing of any new replication origins. Finally, the presence of damaged or incompletely replicated DNA in the cell also prevents the entry into mitosis. These pathways contain sensor proteins that detect various nucleic acid structures and associated proteins at DNA replication forks or sites of DNA damage. The sensor proteins control the activity of effector proteins, which regulate cell cycle processes. A third class of proteins termed mediators or adaptors may facilitate interactions between sensor and effector proteins. Some checkpoint proteins may perform more than one of these functions.Members of the phosphoinositide kinase-related family of protein kinases function at or near the top of various checkpoint regulatory pathways. In vertebrates, the phosphoinositide kinase-related kinases include ATM and ATR (4Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). ATM plays a key role in the response of cells to double-stranded DNA breaks, which occur following ionizing radiation and other insults to the genome. On the other hand, ATR is involved in detecting DNA replication forks and any problems that might arise in these critical but transient structures during S phase (5Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 6Hekmat-Nejad M. You Z. Yee M. Newport J.W. Cimprich K.A. Curr.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). ATM is dispensable for cell viability, but absence of functional ATR is lethal, presumably because of its role in monitoring the success of DNA replication (9Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 397-402PubMed Google Scholar, 10de Klein A. Muijtjens M. van Os R. Verhoeven Y. Smit B. Carr A.M. Lehmann A.R. Hoeijmakers J.H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 479-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In view of the importance of ATM and ATR to the preservation of genomic integrity, it will be critical to elucidate how these kinases undergo activation during checkpoint responses and to identify their key downstream targets.One of the important functions of checkpoint pathways regulated by the phosphoinositide kinase-related kinases appears to be control of the DNA replication machinery in the cell (3Nyberg K.A. Michelson R.J. Putnam C.W. Weinert T.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 617-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The initiation of DNA replication is an elaborate process that involves the sequential recruitment of key replication proteins to future origins of DNA replication (11Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). Initially, the origin recognition complex recruits Cdc6 and Cdt1 to the DNA. In turn, these proteins allow the loading of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) 1The abbreviations used are: MCM, minichromosome maintenance; GST, glutathione S-transferase.1The abbreviations used are: MCM, minichromosome maintenance; GST, glutathione S-transferase. complex onto the DNA. Thereafter, this complex enables the binding of various additional proteins, notably Cdc45, to chromatin. The binding of Cdc45 and regulated phosphorylation by the kinases Cdc7 and Cdk2 are rate-limiting steps for the initiation of DNA replication (12Edwards M.C. Tutter A.V. Cvetic C. Gilbert C.H. Prokhorova T.A. Walter J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33049-33057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The MCM complex, possibly in conjunction with associated proteins, appears to represent a specific helicase activity that is essential for the replicative unwinding of DNA that begins at newly fired origins. Not surprisingly, the MCM complex appears to be subject to multiple levels of regulation during the cell cycle (reviewed in Refs. 13Bailis J.M. Forsburg S.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar and 14Forsburg S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 109-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar).Xenopus egg extracts have proven to be a valuable tool for functional analysis of checkpoint regulatory pathways. In this system, the addition of the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin to elicit replication blocks results in the accumulation of incompletely replicated DNA (15Dasso M. Newport J.W. Cell. 1990; 61: 811-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 16Kumagai A. Guo Z. Emami K.H. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1559-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This response results in the activation of Xchk1, the Xenopus homolog of the effector kinase Chk1 (16Kumagai A. Guo Z. Emami K.H. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1559-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In this context, the activation of Xchk1 requires the action of Xenopus ATR (Xatr) (5Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 6Hekmat-Nejad M. You Z. Yee M. Newport J.W. Cimprich K.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1565-1573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Moreover, DNA damage responses can also be studied in these extracts. In particular, the introduction of DNA with free double-stranded ends, which would mimic damaged DNA, into these extracts inhibits both DNA replication and entry into mitosis (17Guo Z. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Costanzo V. Robertson K. Ying C.Y. Kim E. Avvedimento E. Gottesman M. Grieco D. Gautier J. Mol.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3159-3169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As is the case in human cells, ATM is involved in checkpoint regulation in response to the presence of DNA with exposed double-stranded ends (18Costanzo V. Robertson K. Ying C.Y. Kim E. Avvedimento E. Gottesman M. Grieco D. Gautier J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).For this study, we set out to probe the function and regulation of ATM by searching for ATM-interacting proteins in Xenopus egg extracts. To initiate these experiments, we isolated a cDNA encoding the full-length version of Xenopus ATM (Xatm). Using antibodies against a previously undescribed region from the regulatory domain of Xatm, we identified Xenopus Mcm2 (Xmcm2) as a specific binding partner for Xatm. Moreover, we also found that Xmcm2 is a direct and efficient substrate of ATM. Further analyses indicated that Xmcm2 is likewise a specific target of ATR. Therefore, Xmcm2 is a direct target of the two major phosphoinositide kinase-related kinases involved in DNA-regulated checkpoint responses in this system.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of a cDNA Encoding Full-length Xatm—Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from Xenopus oocyte total RNA and subjected to first strand cDNA synthesis. A Xenopus oocyte cDNA library was constructed and ligated with adaptors using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech). 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends/PCR was performed using primer 5′-TGCCCACAATGACATGGTGGTGACACTC-3′ based on a sequence in the C-terminal half of Xatm and adaptor primer-1 from the Marathon cDNA kit. After a second PCR using nested primers (5′-GCAACAGATCGAGGCAAAGCAAGAGACTG-3′ and adaptor primer-2 from the Marathon cDNA kit), a 4.6-kb PCR product that encodes the N-terminal half of Xatm was obtained. A 9.2-kb fragment was amplified from the same library using two oligonucleotides (5′-ATGAGTCTTGCGCTACATGAGCTGCTGCTCTGC-3′ and 5′-GCAGAGCAGCAGCTCATGTAGCGCAAGACTCAT-3′) that were designed to span the full-length coding sequence of Xatm. Sequencing of both DNA strands from this fragment revealed an open reading frame of 3061 amino acids.Antibodies—A DNA fragment encoding amino acids 634–878 of Xatm was produced by PCR and cloned into a pET-His6 expression vector. The His6-Xatm-(634–878) protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, isolated on nickel-agarose, and used for production of antibodies at a commercial facility. These antibodies recognized the 350-kDa Xatm protein in Xenopus egg extracts by both immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. An anti-human BM28 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes Xmcm2, was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Control rabbit IgG was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. For anti-phospho-Ser92 antibodies against phosphorylated Xmcm2, the peptide CEDLTASQREAA (containing residues 87–97) was synthesized with a phosphate at Ser92 and an extra cysteine residue for conjugation to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Anti-phosphopeptide antibodies were prepared as described (20Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified antibodies against Xatr, Xchk2, Xchk1, and Xorc2 were as described previously (16Kumagai A. Guo Z. Emami K.H. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. J.

Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Extracts were treated with 50 μg/ml (dA)70-(dT)70 to induce checkpoint responses as described (21Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). To prepare extracts containing chromatin with double-stranded DNA breaks or DNA replication blocks, demembranated sperm nuclei (1000–3000/μl) were incubated in extracts containing 0.05 unit/μl EcoRI or 100 μg/ml aphidicolin, respectively. Caffeine was added at a final concentration of 5 mm to override checkpoint responses (5Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1559-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation and Immunodepletion—For immunoprecipitations, extracts (100 μl) were incubated with protein A-conjugated magnetic beads (Dynal, Inc.) containing anti-Xatm antibodies (5 μg) or with protein G-conjugated magnetic beads containing anti-BM28 antibodies (5 μg) for 45 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mm EGTA, and 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate and once with HEPES-buffered saline (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl) and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For immunodepletion of Xatm, interphase extracts (100 μl) were incubated with 30 μg of anti-Xatm antibodies bound to 120 μl of protein A-conjugated magnetic beads at 4 °C for 45 min. The same amount of control rabbit IgG was used for mock depletion. After the incubation, the beads were removed with a magnet, and the supernatants were treated again for a second round of depletion. Xatr was immunodepleted as described previously (24Yanow S.K. Gold D.A. Yoo H.Y. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41083-41092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Identification of Xatm-interacting Proteins by Mass Spectrometry— Anti-Xatm immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. Protein bands were excised, in gel-digested with trypsin as described previously (25Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar), and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry on an AnchorChip™ 384–600 target as described (26Thomas H. Havlis J. Peychl J. Shevchenko A. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2004; 18: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The peptide mass fingerprint acquired from the digest of a band at 120 kDa identified the Xenopus Mcm2 protein. Ten peptides were matched to its sequence within better than 50 ppm mass tolerance, covering 12% of the protein sequence. A data base search was performed against a non-redundant protein data base (Mass Spectrometry Protein Sequence Database) using Mascot software (Matrix Sciences Ltd., London, United Kingdom). The protein score of the hit was 100 and exceeded the threshold significance score of 74 (p < 0.05); and therefore, the identification was confident.Kinase Assays—For kinase assays of endogenous Xatm, egg extracts (50 μl) were treated as indicated and then incubated with Affiprep-protein A beads containing anti-Xatm antibodies (3 μg) for 40 min at 4 °C with rotation. The same amount of rabbit IgG was used for control samples. The beads were isolated and washed three times with 80 mm β-glycerol phosphate (pH 7.3), 20 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and twice with HEPES-buffered saline. The beads were resuspended in 50 μl of HEPES-buffered saline. Aliquots (10 μl) were incubated with 1 μg of PHAS-I or GST-Xmcm2 fragment as substrate at room temperature. Wild-type and kinase-inactive versions of recombinant human FLAG-tagged ATM and ATR were produced in 293T cells and assayed for kinase activity as described (27Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A.

To prepare GST-tagged peptide fragments of Xmcm2, DNA fragments encoding amino acids 62–122, 297–357, 485–545, and 757–817 of Xmcm2 were cloned into a pGEX vector. GST-tagged proteins were produced and purified from bacteria as described (28Yoo H.Y. Kumagai A. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G.

Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Point mutants in Xmcm2 were produced with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene).Isolation of Nuclear and Chromatin Fractions—Egg extracts (100–200 μl) containing 3000 sperm nuclei/μl were incubated under the indicated conditions, overlaid on a 1-ml sucrose cushion containing chromatin isolation buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 1 m sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 25 mm potassium gluconate, and 10 mm magnesium gluconate), and centrifuged at 6100 × g for 5 min. The pellets were washed twice with chromatin isolation buffer. After centrifugation, the pellets (nuclear fractions) were boiled in gel sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. For preparation of chromatin fractions, the pellets were washed once more with chromatin isolation buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The supernatant (nuclear soluble fraction) was removed, and the chromatin pellets were processed for SDS-PAGE. To elute proteins from nuclear fractions, nuclear pellets were incubated on ice for 10 min with 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6) containing 0.3 m NaCl and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The samples were centrifuged at 11,700 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation.Replication Assays—To monitor DNA replication, interphase extracts were incubated with 1000–3000 sperm nuclei/μl and 100 μg/ml cycloheximide in the presence of [α-32P]dATP as described (24Yanow S.K. Gold D.A. Yoo H.Y. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41083-41092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and Immunofluorescence—After incubation with EcoRI or aphidicolin, extracts were diluted, fixed, and layered on a sucrose cushion, and nuclei were pelleted onto coverslips as described (30Mills A.D. Blow J.J. White J.G. Amos W.B. Wilcock D. Laskey R.A. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 471-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Yan H. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence was performed using goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa 488 for anti-BM28 and anti-phospho-Ser92 antibodies, respectively. Chromatin was stained with Hoechst 33258 to visualize the DNA. Samples were viewed on a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope and imaged with a SpotRT CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments) at identical magnifications and exposure times.HeLa cells were treated with γ-irradiation, UV light, or hydroxyurea as indicated. Cells were processed 2 h after treatment with γ-irradiation or UV or 24 h after the addition of hydroxyurea to the culture. For localized UV damage, cells were overlaid with a 3-μm Isopore polycarbonate filter (Millipore) prior to irradiation with 100 J/m2 UV as described (32Ward I.M. Minn K. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9677-9680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and allowed to recover for 90 min prior to immunostaining. For immunoblotting, whole cell extracts were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE. For indirect immunofluorescence, cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips. After treatment, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and processed for microscopy. Mouse anti-BM28 monoclonal and rabbit anti-phospho-Ser108 polyclonal antibodies were used as primary antibodies, and either goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa 568 or goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa 488 was used as the secondary antibody at 1:250 dilution. TO-PRO-3 iodide (Molecular Probes, Inc.) or Hoechst 33258 was used to detect nuclear DNA. The coverslips were washed, mounted onto glass slides, and viewed with a Leica SP confocal microscope or a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope.RESULTSCloning of a Full-length Xenopus Homolog of ATM—To study the role of ATM in checkpoint responses in Xenopus egg extracts, we isolated a cDNA encoding a full-length homolog of Xenopus ATM (Xatm). A fragment containing the C-terminal half of Xatm was described previously (33Robertson K. Hensey C. Gautier J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7070-7079Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To identify the N-terminal region of Xatm, we cloned a 4.8-kb cDNA from a Xenopus oocyte Marathon cDNA library by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Next, using two primers for the predicted extreme 5′- and 3′-ends of Xatm, we amplified a 9.2-kb fragment from this library. Upon DNA sequencing of this fragment, we identified an open reading frame of 3061 amino acids that encodes the full-length Xatm protein (Fig. 1A). An alignment of the N-terminal half of Xatm with human ATM is shown in Supplemental Fig. S1. The predicted amino acid sequence of full-length Xatm shares 64% identity with human ATM. The previously identified kinase domain of Xatm (residues 2676–2981) is 88% identical between the two species, and the N-terminal regulatory domain (residues 1–2676) that has now been fully defined in this study is 61% identical to the corresponding region of human ATM.Xatm Undergoes Activation in Checkpoint-induced Extracts—Human ATM undergoes activation in response to double-stranded DNA breaks (see Ref. 34Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2652) Google Scholar). To investigate the regulation of Xatm, we first examined the effect of a defined DNA template with double-stranded DNA ends on Xatm in egg extracts. For this experiment, we utilized annealed oligomers consisting of (dA)70 and (dT)70. This template ((dA)70-(dT)70) can induce both DNA damage and DNA replication checkpoint responses effectively in egg extracts (17Guo Z. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). We incubated egg extracts with either no DNA or (dA)70-(dT)70, immunoprecipitated Xatm with anti-Xatm antibodies, and then assayed its kinase activity with PHAS-I as the substrate. As shown in Fig. 1B, the activity of Xatm from extracts containing (dA)70-(dT)70 was much higher than from extracts lacking DNA. Immunoprecipitates with control IgG contained negligible kinase activity.Caffeine is a well documented inhibitor of phosphoinositide kinase-related kinases such as ATM and ATR (4Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). To examine whether caffeine affects the activation of Xatm, we immunoprecipitated Xatm from extracts treated with (dA)70-(dT)70 in the absence or presence of caffeine and then assayed its kinase activity in the absence of caffeine. Interestingly, we found that Xatm underwent activation in both the absence and presence of caffeine (Fig. 1B). To confirm that Xatm is indeed sensitive to caffeine, we assayed its kinase activity in the presence of various concentrations of this compound. We observed that the kinase activity of the activated form of Xatm was totally suppressed when caffeine was present at a concentration of 0.5 mm or higher in the kinase assay incubation (Fig. 1C). We also found that Xatm was completely inhibited by 1 μm wortmannin (Fig. 1D), as is the case for human ATM (35Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Overall, these results indicate that Xatm, like human ATM, is sensitive to caffeine and wortmannin. However, the process leading to the activation of Xatm can still occur in the presence of caffeine. It has recently been proposed that the activation of human ATM involves intermolecular autophosphorylation of inactive ATM dimers (34Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2652) Google Scholar). One possibility is that the autophosphorylation activity of ATM is less sensitive to caffeine. Another scenario is that the activation of ATM can occur without autophosphorylation under some circumstances. Finally, since we need to assay activated Xatm in the absence of caffeine, it is possible that there is some caffeine-insensitive step upstream of autophosphorylation that is involved in the activation of ATM.Next, we examined the regulation of Xatm in response to lesions in chromosomal DNA. For this purpose, we added demembranated sperm chromatin to egg extracts to initiate the formation of reconstituted nuclei. We introduced double-stranded DNA breaks into the chromosomal DNA by including the restriction endonuclease EcoRI in the extracts (19Kobayashi T. Tada S. Tsuyama T. Murofushi H. Seki M. Enomoto T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3159-3169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we induced the formation of stalled replication forks in the chromatin by adding the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin. After 100 min, we isolated nuclear fractions from the incubations, extracted nuclear proteins with 0.3 m NaCl, and then immunoprecipitated the salt eluates with control or anti-Xatm antibodies. We observed that the activity of Xatm for PHAS-I increased in response to treatment with either EcoRI or aphidicolin (Fig. 1E). Similar amounts of Xatm protein were immunoprecipitated under all conditions. These results demonstrate that both double-stranded DNA breaks and replication blocks can elicit the activation of Xatm in egg extracts.Xatm Interacts Specifically with Xmcm2—The identification of ATM-interacting proteins could help to elucidate upstream and downstream regulators of ATM-dependent checkpoint responses. We searched for Xatm-interacting proteins by immunoprecipitating Xatm from Xenopus egg extracts with anti-Xatm antibodies and silver staining the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2A). Our interest was attracted by a band at ∼120 kDa because 32P labeling experiments indicated that this protein underwent cell cycle-regulated and checkpoint-dependent phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). In particular, the 120-kDa band was significantly phosphorylated in interphase egg extracts. This phosphorylation increased in both M phase extracts and interphase extracts containing (dA)70-(dT)70. The elevated phosphorylation in the presence of (dA)70-(dT)70 was reversed by caffeine. By comparison, Xatm displayed similar phosphorylation during interphase and M phase, but its phosphorylation also increased in interphase extracts containing (dA)70-(dT)70. This phosphorylation was likewise prevented by the addition of caffeine. Mass spectrometric analysis of a large-scale anti-Xatm immunoprecipitate from interphase egg extracts, which was stained with Coomassie Blue in this case, indicated that the 120-kDa band corresponds to Xmcm2 (see “Experimental Procedures”).Fig. 2Xatm interacts specifically with Xmcm2. A, interphase egg extracts containing (dA)70-(dT)70 were immunoprecipitated (IP) with control IgG (lane 2) or anti-Xatm antibodies (lane 3). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and silver staining. One band at ∼120 kDa (marked"

The extracellular region consisting of nine scavenger receptor cysteinerich (SRCR) domains also circulates in plasma as a soluble protein. By ligand binding analysis of a broad spectrum of soluble CD163 truncation variants, the amino-terminal third of the SRCR region was shown to be crucial for the binding of haptoglobin·hemoglobin complexes. By Western blotting of the CD163 variants, a panel of ten monoclonal antibodies was mapped to SRCR domains 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9, respectively. Only the two antibodies binding to SRCR domain 3 exhibited effective inhibition of ligand binding. Furthermore, analysis of purified native CD163 revealed that proteolytic cleavage in SRCR domain 3 inactivates ligand binding. Calcium protects against cleavage in this domain. Analysis of the calcium sensitivity of ligand binding to CD163 demonstrated that optimal ligand binding requires physiological plasma calcium concentrations, and an immediate ligand release occurs at the low calcium concentrations measured in acidifying endosomes. In conclusion, SRCR domain 3 of CD163 is an exposed domain and a critical determinant for the calcium-sensitive coupling of haptoglobin·hemoglobin complexes.

The haptoglobin (Hp) 1The abbreviations used are: Hp, haptoglobin; Hb, hemoglobin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; SRCR, scavenger receptor cysteine-rich; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; aa, amino acid; IL, interleukin.·hemoglobin (Hb) receptor CD163 is a 130-kDa macrophage protein belonging to a group of proteins constituting a subfamily of scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain proteins (1Kristiansen M.

Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). These proteins, including CD5, CD6, CD163, CD163b, and WC1, are membrane proteins with a short cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane segment, and an extracellular domain consisting exclusively of a variant number of consecutive class B SRCR domains (3Graversen J.H. Madsen M. Moestrup S.K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 4Gronlund J. Vitved L. Lausen M. Skjodt K. Holmskov U. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6406-6415Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The overall structure of the ∼100-aa class B SRCR domain is suggested to resemble the class A SRCR domain, which based on its crystal structure (5Hohenester E. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 6Sarrias M.R. Gronlund J. Padilla O. Madsen J. Holmskov U. Lozano F. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 24: 1-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is described as a six-stranded β-sheet cradling an α-helix. The class B domains differ from the class A domains by having four disulfide bridges instead of three. Furthermore, the class B domains are most common in multidomain mosaic proteins containing single SRCR domains associated to other functional domains, whereas the class A domains are most common in proteins exclusively composed of tandem repeats of SRCR domains. The SRCR domain structure is compatible with a role in molecular recognition, as shown for the membrane-proximal region of the three SRCR domains of CD6, which interacts with the activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (CD166) (7Bowen M.A. Aruffo A.A. Bajorath J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 40: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and for two of the SRCR domains in bovine WC1 that bind to an unknown counter receptor (8Ahn J.S. Konno A. Gebe J.A. Aruffo A. Hamilton M.J. Park Y.H. Davis W.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 72: 382-390PubMed Google Scholar). CD163 is the only protein of the class B SRCR domain protein subfamily identified as a receptor for an extracellular ligand. It binds with high affinity to the Hp·Hb complex (1Kristiansen M. Graversen J.H. Jacobsen C. Sonne O. Hoffman H.J. Law S.K.A. Moestrup S.K. Nature. 2001; 409: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar) that instantly forms in plasma when Hb is released from ruptured erythrocytes and is exposed to plasma Hp (0.3-2 g/liter) (9Dati F. Schumann G. Thomas L. Aguzzi F. Baudner S. Bienvenu J. Blaabjerg O. Blirup-Jensen S. Carlstrom A. Hyltoft-Petersen P. Johnson A.M. MilfordWard A. Ritchie R.F. Svendsen P.J. Whicher J. Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1996; 34: 517-520PubMed Google Scholar). This captor-receptor system controlling the metabolic route of Hb during limited hemolysis thereby protects against heme-mediated oxidative damages, in particular in the kidneys, that readily filtrate non-complexed Hb and take up Hb in the proximal tubules (10Gburek J. Verroust P.J. Willnow T.E. Fyfe J.C. Nowacki W. Jacobsen C. Moestrup S.K. Christensen E.I. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 423-430PubMed Google Scholar). CD163 has no measurable affinity for noncomplexed Hp or Hb (1Kristiansen M. Graversen J.H. Jacobsen C. Sonne O. Hoffman H.J. Law S.K.A. Moestrup S.K. Nature. 2001; 409: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). This Hp·Hb complex-specific recognition by CD163 explains the decrease in Hp concentration in plasma during accelerated hemolysis (11Bunn H.F. Rosse W. Braunwald E. Fauci A.S. Kasper D.L. Hauser S.L. Longo J.L. Jameson J.L. Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 681-691Google Scholar). Besides having a role in clearance of Hb from plasma, CD163 is suggested to have an immunomodulatory role (12Van den Heuvel M.M. Tensen C.P. van As J.H. van den Berg T.K. Fluitsma D.M. Dijkstra C.D.

First, clearance of the hemoglobin results in conversion of the heme molecule to CO, bilirubin, and Fe, which overall are suggested to have an anti-inflammatory effect (15Philippidis P. Mason J.C.

Second, ligand binding to CD163 is reported to induce tyrosine kinase- and calcium-dependent signaling and increased secretion of IL-6 and IL-10 (12Van den Heuvel M.M. Tensen C.P. van As J.H. van den Berg T.K. Fluitsma D.M. Dijkstra C.D. Dopp E.A. Droste A. Van Gaalen F.A. Sorg C. Hogger P. Beelen R.H.J. J.

Res. 2004; 94: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). CD163 also circulates in plasma (∼1-3 mg/liter) as a soluble protein with a size identical to that of the nine extracellular SRCR domains (17Moller H.J. Peterslund N.A. Graversen J.H. Moestrup S.K.

Methods. 2001; 252: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). During sepsis and other conditions affecting macrophage activity, the level of soluble CD163 may raise many-fold (19Moller H.J. de Fost M. Aerts H. Hollak C. Moestrup S.K. Eur. J. Haematology. 2004; 72: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 20Schaer D.J. Schleiffenbaum B. Kurrer M. Imhof A. Bächli E. Fehr J. Møller H.J. Moestrup S.K. Schaffner A. Eur. J.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 526: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It is not reported whether soluble CD163 binds any ligands. To delineate ligand binding properties of the membrane-associated and soluble CD163 protein and to identify the SRCR domains involved in ligand and antibody binding leading to endocytosis and signaling, we have performed a comprehensive analysis of a panel of recombinant CD163 variants and proteolytic fragments of CD163, including soluble CD163 circulating in plasma. Purified CD163, Ligand, and Antibodies—Full-length CD163 was purified from solubilized human spleen membranes as previously described (1Kristiansen M. Graversen J.H. Jacobsen C. Sonne O. Hoffman H.J. Law S.K.A. Moestrup S.K. Nature. 2001; 409: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Amino-terminal sequencing of CD163 fragments was carried out by the Edman degradation procedure as previously described (22Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H. Rasmussen H.H.

A polyclonal rabbit antibody has previously been described (1Kristiansen M. Graversen J.H. Jacobsen C. Sonne O. Hoffman H.J. Law S.K.A. Moestrup S.K. Nature. 2001; 409: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Construction of Plasmids for Expression of Recombinant Human CD163 Fragments—CD163 cDNA fragments extended with enzyme restriction sites were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the Pfu turbo polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and purified with the QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The PCR products were subcloned into the expression vector (pcDNA5/FRT or pSecTag2B from Invitrogen) by use of the appropriate restriction enzymes (HindIII and XhoI, New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) and the T4 DNA ligase (New England BioLabs). Plasmids were transformed using DH5α-competent cells (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), and plasmid DNA was isolated by the Qiagen Maxiprep method (Qiagen) and sequenced before transfection. The following eleven constructs designated according to their SRCR domain composition were subcloned and expressed: r-CD163SRCR1-3 (aa 1-362); r-CD163SRCR1-4 (aa 1-478); r-CD163SRCR1-5 (aa 1-574); r-CD163SRCR1-6 r-CD163SRCR1-8 (aa (aa 1-679); 1-922); r-CD163SRCR1-7 (aa 1-815); r-CD163SRCR1-9 (aa 1-1025), r-CD163SRCR2-9 (aa 149-1025), r-CD163SRCR3-9 (aa 256-1025), r-CD163SRCR4-9 (aa 363-1025), and r-CD163SRCR5-9 (aa 470-1025). Expression of Recombinant Human CD163 Fragments—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cells (BioWhittaker) were transfected using DOSPER liposomal transfection reagent or FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Stable transfected CHO clones were established by limited dilution and selection with 500 μg/ml Hygromycin B (Invitrogen) for constructs in the pcDNA5/FRT vector or 500 μg/ml Zeocin™ (Invitrogen) for constructs in the pSecTag2B vector. Clones were grown in serum-free medium for CHO cells (HyQ-CCM®5 from HyClone®, Logan, Utah) with 300 μg/ml Hygromycin B or 300 μg/ml Zeocin™. Cells were lysed in a solution of 10 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.6 mm CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100 (Merck), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), pH 7.4. The expression products were detected by Western blotting of growth medium and cell lysate using a rabbit polyclonal anti-CD163 antibody (1Kristiansen M. Graversen J.H. Jacobsen C. Sonne O.

Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—SPR analysis of the binding of Hb in complex with Hp (both the 1-1 and 2-2 phenotypes) to CD163 was carried out on a Biacore 2000 instrument (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). The Biacore sensor chips (type CM5) were activated with a 1:1 mixture of 0.2 mN-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and 0.05 mN-hydroxysuccimide in water. Purified recombinant proteins (r-CD163SRCR1-5, r-CD163SRCR1-6, r-CD163SRCR1-7, r-CD163SRCR1-8, r-CD163SRCR1-9) were immobilized in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, and the remaining binding sites were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. The SPR signal generated from immobilized recombinant CD163 proteins corresponded to 40-70 fmol of protein/mm2. Sensorgrams were generated using Hp (2-2)·Hb concentrations ranging from 5-1000 nm. The flow cells were regenerated with 1.6 m glycine-HCl, pH 3. For the reverse experiment, Hp (2-2)·Hb was immobilized as described above. The SPR signal generated from immobilized Hp (2-2)·Hb complex corresponded to 40-50 fmol of ligand/mm2. Data were recorded with a concentration of the recombinant proteins (r-CD163SRCR1-5, r-CD163SRCR1-6, r-CD163SRCR1-7, r-CD163SRCR1-8, r-CD163SRCR1-9) of 100 nm each diluted in the flow buffer. All binding data were analyzed using the Biamolecular Interaction Analysis evaluation program version 3.1. Analyses with a Panel of Monoclonal Anti-CD163 Antibodies—Immunoblots to a complete set of the CD163 truncation variants listed in Fig. 1 were probed with each monoclonal anti-CD163 antibody, and the domain location of the antibody epitope was defined on basis of the band pattern. SPR analyses were performed on a Biacore 2000 instrument as described above. Purified human full-length CD163 was immobilized to a sensor chip, and the SPR signal generated from immobilized CD163 corresponded to 36-60 fmol receptor/mm2. Each of the monoclonal anti-CD163 antibodies was injected and bound to the CD163 chip prior to incubation with the ligand (either Hp (2-2)·Hb or Hp (1-1)·Hb complex). Identification of Hp·Hb Binding Activity in Serum—Erythrocytes from EDTA-stabilized blood were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged, and hemolyzed by freezing. Hemolyzed erythrocytes were added to serum (1:100 v/v) from individuals with different Hp phenotypes (Hp (1-1), Hp (2-1), and Hp (2-2), respectively), incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and diluted 1:2 with 0.05 m Tris, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1% human serum albumin, 0.02% sodium-azide, pH 7.2, containing either 5 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EDTA. Diluted serum samples (250 μl) were applied to a Superdex™ 200 HR 10/30 column on a SMART™ chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) for gel filtration with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Tris buffer (with CaCl2 or EDTA) was used to equilibrate the column and elute the sample. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and analyzed for soluble CD163 in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described (23Moller H.J. Hald K. Moestrup S.K. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Investig. 2002; 62: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Hp phenotyping was performed by Western blotting of serum from healthy individuals. Identification of Hp·Hb Binding SRCR Domains in CD163—A panel of truncation variants of the SRCR domain region of CD163 was expressed (Fig. 1A) in stably transfected CHO cells. Fig. 1B shows Western blotting of the constructs expressed. Except for four of the constructs, the truncation variants were effectively secreted (lanes 3-7 and 10-11) to the cell culture medium. The non-secreted variants, which included the amino-terminal r-CD163SRCR1-3 and r-CD163SRCR1-4 constructs (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-2) and the constructs truncated in the amino-terminal part (r-CD163SRCR2-9 and r-CD163SRCR3-9) (lanes 8-9), accumulated in the cells, indicating abnormal folding and/or incomplete processing of these recombinant products. Binding of the secreted CD163 truncation variants to Hp·Hb as tested by precipitation with Hp·Hb-Sepharose beads revealed binding activity in the r-CD163SRCR1-5 variant and all larger variants (CD163SRCR1-6, CD163SRCR1-7, CD163SRCR1-8, and CD163SRCR1-9) encompassing the SRCR1-5 region. Accordingly, the variants were readily purified from conditioned growth media by Hp·Hb affinity chromatography. Fig. 2 shows SDS-PAGE of the purified r-CD163SRCR1-5 and r-CD163SRCR1-9 variants and their high affinity binding (Kd = 1-5 nm) to Hp·Hb as measured by SPR analyses. No binding to the r-CD163SRCR4-9 or r-CD163SRCR4-9 variants was seen (Fig. 1B), indicating that the amino-terminal third (SRCR1-3) of the extracellular CD163 domain is essential for ligand binding. Hp·Hb precipitation of the four non-secreted constructs (r-CD163SRCR1-3, r-CD163SRCR1-4, r-CD163SRCR2-9, and r-CD163SRCR3-9) accumulating in the cells did not reveal any binding activity (not shown). However, this finding might be due to an incomplete processing of these amino-terminal truncation variants; the finding therefore does not exclude that the corresponding parts of full-length native CD163 contain a binding site for Hp·Hb. Further information on the location of the ligand binding site was obtained by mapping the binding sites and analyzing ligand-inhibiting effects of a panel of ten monoclonal antibodies (Table I). Western blotting of the recombinant CD163 expression products and the proteolytic fragments revealed that four antibodies (Ber-MAC3, 5C6-FAT, Mac 2-48, Mac2-158) bind within SRCR domain 1 and two antibodies (EDhu1 and Ki-M8) bind to SRCR domain 3, whereas R-20, D11, GHI/61, and RM 3/1 bind to SRCR domains 4, 6, 7, and 9, respectively (Fig. 3, Table I). The SPR data revealed that only the antibodies EDhu1 and the Ki-M8 with binding epitopes in SRCR domain 3 of CD163 effectively compete for binding of Hp·Hb complexes to CD163 (Fig. 3, Table I). A partial inhibition was seen by the antibodies binding to domain 1, 4, and 9, suggesting that these antibodies may cause some steric hindrance or conformational change but not a direct blocking of ligand binding (Table I).Table IAnalysis of a panel of monoclonal anti-CD163 antibodiesMac2- 48Mac2-158Ber- MAC35C6- FATEDhu1KI-M8R-20D11GHI/61RM 3/1r-CD163SRCR1-3++++++−−−−r-CD163SRCR1-4+++++++−−−r-CD163SRCR1-5+++++++−−−r-CD163SRCR1-6++++++++−−r-CD163SRCR1-7+++++++++−r-CD163SRCR1-8+++++++++−r-CD163SRCR1-9++++++++++r-CD163SRCR2-9−−−−++++++r-CD163SRCR3-9−−−−++++++r-CD163SRCR4-9−−−−−−++++r-CD163SRCR5-9−−−−−−−+++CD163 amino-terminal fragmentaThe fragments seen after cleavage of CD163 in SRCR domain 3.

Major cleavage site at Asp-265. Open table in a new tab The indicated role of SRCR domain 3 in the Hp·Hb binding was further verified by analyzing cleavage products of affinity-purified native CD163 from spleen membranes. Limited proteolytic cleavage occurred spontaneously after exposure of native receptor to calcium-free condition, as apparent by SDS-PAGE showing the appearance of two major proteins bands of ∼90-95 and ∼35-40 kDa (Fig. 4, lane 1). No cleavage was seen when 5 mm calcium or 1 mm serine proteinase inhibitor (phenylmethyl-sulfonylfluoride) was added (not shown), indicating that calcium protects against proteinase activity. Western blotting using the mapped monoclonal antibodies (Table I), Triton X-114 precipitation (precipitates integral membrane proteins), and amino-terminal sequencing (data not shown) revealed that the 35-40-kDa band represents the amino-terminal part and the larger 90-95-kDa band the remaining carboxyl-terminal part, including the transmembrane segment. The amino-terminal sequencing disclosed cleavage in four close positions (the peptide bond amino-terminal of Asp-265, Arg-277, Ser-329, Ala-356) with Asp-265 being the primary site. The cleavage sites are all located in SRCR domain 3, thus indicating that this domain represents an exposed domain accessible for proteolytic attack. In contrast to the non-cleaved receptor, the cleavage products were not precipitable with Hp·Hb-beads (Fig. 4, lane 2), indicating that the structural integrity of domain SRCR 3 is essential for the ligand receptor interaction. Furthermore, the cleavage virtually abolished recognition of CD163 by the EDhu1 and Ki-M8 antibodies (Table I). This further indicates that the epitopes of these antibodies overlap with the Hp·Hb binding region of CD163. The ligand binding activity of the recombinant CD163 products encompassing SRCR 3 suggests that the soluble form of CD163 circulating in plasma is active in terms of ligand binding. To verify that soluble CD163 binds Hp·Hb complexes formed during hemolysis, we added Hb (lysed erythrocytes) to serum and measured the elution volume for plasma CD163. As seen in Fig. 5, the addition of Hb changed the elution volume of CD163 toward that of a protein of substantially larger size. The change was, as expected, more pronounced using serum from a person with the oligomeric high molecular mass Hp 2-2 and Hp 2-1 phenotypes compared with serum with the lower molecular mass Hp 1-1 phenotype. In accordance with the known calcium dependence of the Hp·Hb binding to CD163, no change in elution was seen when calcium was complexed to EDTA. Finally, we used the purified soluble ligand-binding r-CD163SRCR1-5 protein to characterize the calcium and pH sensitivity of Hp·Hb binding to the ligand binding site of CD163. As shown by SPR analysis (Fig. 6A), concentrations of calcium lower than the plasma concentration of calcium (∼2.2-2.5 mm) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in affinity. No binding was measured in calcium concentrations below 0.2 mm. Accordingly, low calcium concentrations strongly accelerated dissociation of Hp·Hb bound to CD163 at high calcium concentrations (Fig. 6B). An accelerated dissociation of the ligand was also seen when pH was lowered to 6.0-6.5. (Fig. 6C). In the present study we have analyzed a large spectrum of CD163 truncation variants and used various approaches to identify and characterize the ligand binding site of the CD163 molecule. Fig. 7 summarizes the mapping of the calcium-sensitive ligand binding site and the antibody epitopes. The blocking effect of the EDhu1 and Ki-M8 antibodies as well as the inactivation of ligand binding by cleavage in SRCR domain 3 pinpointed SRCR domain 3 as crucial for the CD163 recognition of Hp·Hb complexes. The position of the Hp·Hb site in the amino-terminal third of the receptor appears biologically meaningful in the sense that this part of the molecule may be spaced a favorable distance from the membrane, thereby facilitating binding of the ligand complexes, which have a size substantially larger than the extracellular part of CD163. The data presented here do not exclude involvement in ligand binding of adjacent regions to SRCR 3, such as SRCR domain 2. However, the fact that there is no blocking of ligand binding of the antibodies binding to domain 1 and 4 suggest that these domains are not parts of the ligand binding site, although they might contribute to the receptor folding and accessibility of the ligand. In addition to identifying the ligand binding region, the present study delineated the CD163 epitopes of a broad spectrum of CD163 antibodies, including the ligand-blocking EDhu-1 and Ki-M8 antibodies, which have been widely described in the literature in studies of the function of CD163 (12Van den Heuvel M.M. Tensen C.P. van As J.H. van den Berg T.K. Fluitsma D.M. Dijkstra C.D. Dopp E.A. Droste A. Van Gaalen F.A. Sorg C. Hogger P. Beelen R.H.J. J.

Res. 2004; 94: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the EDhu-1 antibody has been shown to induce a protein tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling, slowtype calcium mobilization, inositol triphosphate production, and secretion of IL-6 and granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (12Van den Heuvel M.M. Tensen C.P. van As J.H. van den Berg T.K. Fluitsma D.M. Dijkstra C.D. Dopp E.A. Droste A. Van Gaalen F.A. Sorg C. Hogger P. Beelen R.H.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 66: 858-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), whereas the Ki-M8 antibody has been shown to induce IL-10 secretion (15Philippidis P. Mason J.C. Evans B. Nadra I. Taylor K.M. Haskard D.O. Landis R.C. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Uptake of Hp·Hb also induces IL-10 secretion (15Philippidis P. Mason J.C. Evans B. Nadra I. Taylor K.M. Haskard D.O. Landis R.C. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), but it is unknown whether it is because of a direct receptor-mediated signal or because of the hemoglobin uptake leading to a heme-mediated cellular response. The effects of EDhu-1 and Ki-M8 antibodies are suggested to involve cross-linkage of CD163 in the membrane. It is therefore tempting to believe that the Hp·Hb complex, which is di- or multivalent in terms of CD163 recognition (depending on the Hp phenotype), also is able to cross-link CD163. In vitro binding of Hp·Hb complexes to purified CD163 does, in fact, support that CD163 cross-linkage can occur (1Kristiansen M. Graversen J.H. Jacobsen C. Sonne O. Hoffman H.J. Law S.K.A. Moestrup S.K. Nature. 2001; 409: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). The Hp·Hb complex is the first soluble ligand identified for SRCR domains in a membrane receptor. The known ligands to the canonic type A scavenger receptor bind to the collagenous part of this receptor and not to the SRCR domain (24Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). However, the CD6 protein, which has an extracellular domain consisting of three class B SRCR domains, is known to bind an integral membrane protein, the activated leukocyte adhesion protein, CD166 (7Bowen M.A. Aruffo A.A. Bajorath J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 40: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the SRCR domain 3 of CD6 has also been identified as the ligand-binding domain, and site-directed mutagenesis has shown that a highly variable SRCR region of this domain is important for the CD166 interaction (7Bowen M.A. Aruffo A.A. Bajorath J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 40: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the present study we further explored the previous observation (1Kristiansen M. Graversen J.H. Jacobsen C. Sonne O. Hoffman H.J. Law S.K.A. Moestrup S.K. Nature. 2001; 409: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar) that calcium is essential for binding of Hp·Hb to CD163. This is, to our knowledge, the only SRCR interaction reported to depend on calcium. However, calcium binding to many other endocytic receptors, including the low density lipoprotein receptor family proteins (25Rudenko G. Henry L. Henderson K. Ichtchenko K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 298: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 26Moestrup S.K. Kaltoft K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J. J. Biol.

Met. 2002; 13: 66-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), is a well known prerequisite for ligand binding. Interestingly, the present data revealed that a much higher calcium concentration is required to elicit ligand binding activity of CD163 compared with the low density lipoprotein receptor family proteins that bind calcium with very high affinity. It is therefore tempting to speculate that release of calcium from a low affinity calcium binding site in CD163 may cause ligand-receptor segregation in acidifying endosomes (28Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Gerasimenko O.V. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1335-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The SPR analysis in the present study showed that Hp·Hb bound to CD163 immediately dissociated when the calcium concentration was lowered to 0.2 mm. Decreasing pH to 6.5 also increased dissociation of Hp·Hb from CD163, although at a slower rate. In cell cultures (28Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Gerasimenko O.V. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1335-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), the calcium concentration in endosomes has been measured to be less than 10 μm when pH is 6.5. Under these conditions, the Hp·Hb complex may immediately dissociate from CD163. Such a calcium- and pH-dependent mechanism is different from the biological events causing ligand segregation from the low density lipoprotein receptor. This receptor uncouples its ligand by means of the YWTD propeller repeats that at low pH bind with affinity to ligand binding repeat (25Rudenko G. Henry L. Henderson K. Ichtchenko K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 298: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In accordance with the mapping of the Hp·Hb binding to the SRCR domain 3 region, the present data showed that the circulating soluble form of CD163 representing the extracellular domain of CD163 (17Moller H.J. Peterslund N.A. Graversen J.H. Moestrup S.K. Blood. 2002; 99: 378-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) is able to bind Hp·Hb complexes. The physiological implication of this interaction is not known. However, it is possible that it further prevent toxic effects of Hb or it may influence cellular signal pathways as previously proposed for soluble CD163 (21Frings W. Dreier J. Sorg C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 526: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Probably, soluble CD163 has little effect on the overall clearance of Hb during accelerated hemolysis because soluble CD163 has a ∼1000-fold lower plasma concentration than Hp, which therefore immediately may saturate soluble CD163 when high amounts of Hb are released into plasma from erythrocytes. In conclusion, the present study has provided new insight into the Hp·Hb-CD163 interaction and the role of the SRCR domains in calcium-sensitive ligand coupling and uncoupling. Future studies may define the structural basis of the calcium dependence and the structural change leading to formation of a receptor binding epitope when Hp and Hb join in a complex. Furthermore, the homologous structure of the SRCR domains in CD163 and related proteins suggests that a number of ligand-receptor interactions are yet to be defined in the family of SRCR receptors.

In a previous study, we have shown that the proteolytic activity of tPA enhances the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated signaling in neurons (Nicole, O., Docagne, F., Ali, C., Margaill, I., Carmeliet, P., MacKenzie, E. T., Vivien, D., and Buisson, A. (2001) Nat. Med. 7, 59–64). Here, we show that tPA forms a direct complex with the amino-terminal domain (ATD) of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor and cleaves this subunit at the arginine 260. Furthermore, point mutation analyses show that arginine 260 is necessary for both tPA-induced cleavage of the ATD of NR1 and tPA-induced potentiation of NMDA receptor signaling. Thus, tPA is the first binding protein described so far to interact with the ATD of NR1 and to modulate the NMDA receptor function.

Apart from this primary function in the regulation of intravascular fibrinolysis, tPA has been implicated over the last decade in a variety of brain functions both during development and in adults. tPA is widely expressed in the developing brain, and it is prominently present in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and amygdala of the adult brain (2Sumi Y.

During onto-genesis, growing axons secrete tPA to modulate cell extracellular matrix interactions (2Sumi Y. Dent M.A. Owen D.E. Seeley P.J. Morris R.J.

These include activation of extracellular proteolysis leading to a remodeling of the extracellular matrix and synaptic growth (9Baranes D. Lederfein D. Huang Y.Y. Chen M. Bailey C.H. Kandel E.R.

Brain Res. 1998; 811: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that the binding of tPA to the cell surface low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein could play a key role in L-LTP (18Zhuo M. Holtzman D.M. Li Y. Osaka H. DeMaro J. Jacquin M. Bu G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 542-549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). tPA has also been shown to play an important role in acute and chronic brain pathologies such as seizure (19Tsirka S.E. Gualandris A.

The hippocampal neurons of tPA-deficient mice are resistant to in vivo excitotoxin-induced degeneration (19Tsirka S.E. Gualandris A. Amaral D.G. Strickland S. Nature. 1995; 377: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Similarly, tPA potentiates the excitotoxic lesion induced following an intrastriatal injection of NMDA (1Nicole O. Docagne F. Ali C. Margaill I. Carmeliet P. MacKenzie E.T. Vivien D. Buisson A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 25Liberatore G.T. Samson A. Bladin C. Schleuning W.D. Medcalf R.L. Stroke. 2003; 34: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). After cerebral ischemia, neuronal damage induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion is also reduced in tPA-deficient mice and exacerbated when exogenous tPA is administered (21Wang Y.F. Tsirka S.E. Strickland S. Stieg P.E. Soriano S.G. Lipton S.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 228-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The idea that tPA contributes to the extent of the final damage induced by stroke has been later supported by other groups (26Nagai N. De Mol M. Lijnen H.R. Carmeliet P. Collen D.

Circulation. 2002; 106: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the deleterious effect of tPA in these processes, including enhanced microglial activation (28Rogove A.D. Tsirka S.E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 19-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), increased laminin degradation (29Chen Z.L. Strickland S. Cell. 1997; 91: 917-925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), and the potentiation of NMDA receptor-dependent signaling (1Nicole O. Docagne F. Ali C. Margaill I. Carmeliet P. MacKenzie E.T. Vivien D. Buisson A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the molecular mechanism by which tPA modulates the NMDA receptor-evoked Ca2+ influx. We show that tPA cleaves the amino-terminal domain (ATD) of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor at arginine 260 and that this specific cleavage is a necessary event for tPA-induced potentiation of NMDA receptor signaling. This study constitutes an important step toward the understanding of how tPA influences several physiological and pathological processes involving the glutamatergic signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Horse serum and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen. L(+)-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid was from Tocris (Bristol, United Kingdom). Human recombinant tPA was purchased from Boehringer Ingelheim (Paris, France). α-Casein was obtained from ICN Biomedicals (Aurore, OH), and human Lys-plasminogen was purchased from Calbiochem. Antibodies raised against the NR1 subunit (sc-9058) and His5 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany) and Qiagen (Courtaboeuf, France), respectively. 2,7-Bis-(4-amidinobenzylidene)-cycloheptan-1-one dihydrochloride (tPA-Stop) and tPA substrate spectrozyme XF-444 were purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). Plasmin and all the other chemicals were obtained from Sigma.Cortical Cultures—Neuronal cortical cultures were prepared from fetal mice (embryonic day 15–16). Dissociated cortical cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, and 2 mm glutamine and plated in 24-well dishes previously coated with poly-d-lysine and laminin. After 3 days in vitro, the cells were exposed to 10 μm Ara-C to inhibit glial proliferation. Cultures were used after 14 days in vitro (30Buisson A. Nicole O. Docagne F. Sartelet H. MacKenzie E.T. Vivien D. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1683-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).Immunoblotting—Protein samples were resolved on SDS-polyacryl-amide gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked with 5% dried milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with primary antibodies. After incubation with the corresponding biotinylated secondary antibody and peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin reagent, proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence ECL Plus immunoblotting detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK)-293 Cell Cultures and Transient Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (ATCC 1573-CRL) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Low confluency cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (31Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4810) Google Scholar) with a mixture containing NR1–1a/b (or NR1–1aR260A), NR2A, and enhanced green fluorescent protein plasmids (1, 1, and 0.3 μg/coverslip, respectively). After transfection, NMDA antagonists (200 μm AP5, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm kynurenic acid) were added to the culture medium. Experiments were performed within 36–48 h after transfection.Calcium Videomicroscopy Analysis—Transfected HEK-293 cells were loaded in the presence of a HEPES-buffered saline solution containing 5 μm fura-2/AM plus 0.1% pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes, Leiden, the Netherlands) (30 min, 37 °C) and incubated for an additional 30-min period in a HEPES-buffered saline solution. Experiments were performed at room temperature on the stage of a Nikon Eclipse inverted microscope equipped with a 75 W Xenon lamp and a Nikon 40×, 1.3 numerical aperture epifluorescence oil immersion objective. Fura-2 (excitation 340 and 380 nm, emission 510 nm) ratio images were acquired with a CCD camera (Princeton Instrument, Trenton, New Jersey) and digitized (256 × 512) using Metafluor 4.11 software (Universal Imaging Corporation, Cherter, Pennsylvania).Construction of His-tagged Recombinant ATD/Leucine-Isoleucine-Valine-binding Protein(LIVBP)-like Domain—The region of the NR1 subunit encoding amino acids 19–371 for NR1–1a or 19–389 for NR1–1b corresponding to the ATD was amplified from the full-length rat NR1–1a or NR1–1b cDNA, respectively, by using the upstream primer 5′-CGGGATCCCGCGCCGCCTGCGAC-3′ generating a BamHI restriction site and the downstream primer 5′-ATGGGTACCATTGTAGATGCCCAC-3′ containing an internal KpnI restriction site. PCR products were digested and inserted in pQE100-Double Tag vector (Qiagen), which encodes for His6 at the amino terminus of the insert. Recombinant proteins were purified from inclusion bodies of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced bacterial cultures (Escherichia coli, M15 strain) on a nickel affinity matrix as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen).Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis of either recombinant NR1-ATD (R260A and R217A) or full-length NR1–1a (R260A) was performed by using QuikChange® XL site-directed mutagenesis kit purchased from VWR International France (Fontenay-sous-Bois, France). All mutations were confirmed using an automated sequence analysis.Enzymatic Assay—Recombinant tPA (29 nm) was incubated in the presence of a tPA-specific fluorogenic substrate (5 μm) (Spectrozyme® XF444) and in the presence of either tPA-Stop® (10 nm) or recombinant ATD of NR1 (225 nm). The reaction was carried out at 25 °C in 100 mm Hepes (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 80 in a total volume of 100 μl. The amidolytic activity of tPA was measured as the change in fluorescence emission at 440 nm (excitation at 360 nm). The apparent inhibition constant, Ki′, was determined as described by Petersen et al. (32Petersen L.C. Sprecher C.A. Foster D.C. Blumberg H. Hamamoto T. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The data sets on the inhibition of proteases were analyzed in terms of the equation Vi = V0/(1 + [I]0/Ki′), where Vi and V0 are the inhibited and uninhibited rates, respectively, and [I]0 is the total concentration of inhibitor. Ki values were obtained by correcting for the effect of substrate (S) with the equation Ki = Ki′ (1 + [S]/Km) (2Sumi Y. Dent M.A. Owen D.E. Seeley P.J. Morris R.J. Development. 1992; 116: 625-637PubMed Google Scholar)MALDI-TOF Analysis—Proteins in Coomassie-stained gels were subjected to acetonitrile washing and reductive alkylation by iodoacetamide in ammonium carbonate (0.1 m) (30 min in the dark). Then, in-gel trypsin digestion (Roche Applied Science, EC 3.421.4) was allowed as described by Shevchenko et al. (33Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar). Peptides were resuspended in 20 μl of formic acid 1%, desalted by using Zip Tip C-18 (Millipore), and eluted with 50 and 80% acetonitrile. The desalted peptide mixture was dried and dissolved in 3 μl of formic acid 1%. The matrix used was a saturated solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in trifluoroacetic acid 0.1%. The sample and the matrix (1:1, v/v) were loaded on the target using the dried droplet method. MALDI-TOF spectra of the peptides were obtained with a Voyager-DE STR Biospectrometry Work station mass spectrometer (PE Biosystems Inc.). Analyses were performed in positive ion reflector mode, with an accelerating voltage of 20,000 V, a delayed extraction of 200 ns, and ∼250 scans were averaged. For subsequent data processing, the Data Explorer software (PE Biosystems Inc.) was used. Spectra obtained for the whole protein were calibrated externally using the [M+H]+ ion from Des-Arg bradykinin peptide (904.4681 Da) and ACTH peptide (2465.1989 Da). The trypsin autoproteolysis products (fragment-(132–142), 1153.57 Da and fragment-(56–75), 2163.06 Da) were used as the external calibration standard. A mass deviation of 0.1 Da was allowed in the data base searches.Homology Modeling—The sequence of the ATD of NR1 has been aligned with an alignment deduced from the structural superposition of the extracellular domain of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (1EWT, 1EWK) (34Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar) and four other proteins with a LIVBP fold (the atrial natriuretic peptide clearance receptor (1DP4), the amide receptor (1PEA), the ribose-binding protein (2DRI), and the leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding protein (2LIV)). The alignment and model have been built and optimized iteratively using Model Tool Server (35Douguet D. Labesse G. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 752-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and Modeler (36Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol.

Docagne F. Ali C. Margaill I. Carmeliet P. MacKenzie E.T. Vivien D. Buisson A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 7Fernandez-Monreal M. Lopez-Atalaya J.P.

To investigate the molecular mechanism through which tPA is able to modulate the NMDA receptor signaling, we developed a heterologous expression system of functional NMDA receptors. We transiently transfected HEK-293 cells with the cDNA encoding for NR1–1a and NR2A subunits of the NMDA receptor. The expression of NMDA receptor subunits was confirmed by immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting analyses (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1, in HEK-293 cells expressing NMDA receptors, tPA is able to potentiate NMDA receptor signaling, as it does in cortical neurons (1Nicole O. Docagne F. Ali C. Margaill I. Carmeliet P. MacKenzie E.T. Vivien D. Buisson A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The mRNA encoding for the NR1 subunit exhibits an alternative splicing in its 5′-region, generating isoforms characterized by the absence (a forms) or the presence (b forms) of a 21-residue insert (N1 cassette) encoded by exon 5 (37Sugihara H. Moriyoshi K. Ishii T. Masu M. Nakanishi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 826-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Because the exon 5 splicing is known to influence receptor properties (38Durand G.M. Bennett M.V. Zukin R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6731-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 39Hollmann M. Boulter J. Maron C. Beasley L. Sullivan J. Pecht G. Heinemann S.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6163-6175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have assessed its potential implication in tPA effect. We found that tPA increases NMDA-induced Ca2+ influx to the same extent in HEK-293 cells exhibiting NR1–1b/NR2A or NR1–1a/NR2A receptors (36.87 ± 10.9%, n = 32 and 31.37 ± 5.4%, n = 56, respectively, mean ± S.E.) (Fig. 1, A–C). Hence, the N1 cassette does not influence the tPA-induced potentiation of NMDA receptor signaling.tPA Induces a Single Cleavage of NR1 in Its ATD—To further investigate the mechanism of action of tPA on NMDA receptor signaling, we have examined whether tPA, per se, can cleave NR1. We have shown previously that the treatment of membrane preparations of cultured cortical neurons with tPA leads to the appearance of a cleaved form of NR1, with a molecular mass reduced to ∼25 kDa, recognized by an antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus of NR1 (1Nicole O. Docagne F. Ali C. Margaill I. Carmeliet P. MacKenzie E.T. Vivien D. Buisson A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). This suggests that the amino-terminal portion of the NR1 subunit is the region in which the cleavage occurs. Hence, to determine where tPA cleaves the amino terminus of NR1, we have generated a construct encoding for an amino terminus His-tagged corresponding to the first domain of NR1–1a (amino acid residues 19–371 of NR1, 39875 Da), termed ATD or LIVBP-like domain (Fig. 2A). Incubation of recombinant NR1-ATD with tPA shows that tPA is able to cleave NR1-ATD, in a dose-dependent manner, generating a cleaved fragment of 28 kDa detected by immunoblotting revealed with an antibody raised against the His-tag (Fig. 2B). In addition, tPA-Stop®, an inhibitor of tPA proteolytic activity, prevents the tPA-induced cleavage of both the full-length NR1 (of neuronal membrane preparations from cultured cortical neurons) and the recombinant NR1-ATD (Fig. 3A). Finally, as determined by the digestion pattern of the recombinant NR1-ATD generated by tPA or plasmin, we observed that although tPA induces a single cleavage of the ATD of NR1 subunit, plasmin leads to a complete degradation of the ATD (Fig. 3B).Fig. 2The proteolytic activity of tPA induces a single cleavage of the ATD of the NR1 subunit of NMDA receptor. A, map of the generated construct allowing the production of a recombinant form of the ATD of the NR1 subunit tagged with His6 at its amino terminus. B, immunoblotting was performed from the recombinant ATD-NR1 previously incubated with tPA (20 and 100 μg/ml) for 2 h at 37°C. Immunoblots were revealed with an antibody raised against His6 (WB 6xHIS).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Cleavage of the ATD of the NMDA receptor NR1 subunit is prevented by a synthetic tPA inhibitor, tPA-Stop®, and occurs independently of the plasminogen/plasmin system.

Immunoblots were revealed with an antibody raised against either NR1 or His6, respectively.

To address this question, we have used the recombinant ATD of NR1 to compete the ability of tPA to cleave a specific fluorogenic substrate (Spectrozyme®, XF444). Our data showed that the recombinant ATD of NR1 is able to compete with the tPA-specific substrate with a Ki of 0.234 ± 0.097 μm (Table I). Control experiments were performed in parallel in the presence of the tPA inhibitor tPA-Stop® with a Ki of 0.046 ± 0.015 μm (Table I).Table IKi values for the inhibition of tPA by the ATD of NR1 and tPA-Stop®[I][tPA]Substrate[S]KiμmμmATD-NR10.2250.029CH3SO2-d-Phe-Gly-Arg-AMC-AcOH50.239 ± 0.097tPA-Stop®0.0100.029CH3SO2-d-Phe-Gly-Arg-AMC-AcOH50.046 ± 0.015 Open table in a new tab tPA Cleaves the ATD of NR1 at the Arginine 260 —Next, to identify the exact location of the cleavage site, we analyzed both native (39 kDa) and tPA-cleaved (28 kDa) recombinant NR1-ATD using MALDI-TOF analysis. As summarized in Fig. 4, MALDI-TOF analysis allowed us to identify the putative cleavage site of the NR1–1a and NR1–1b subunits by tPA as the arginine in position 260 (Arg-260) and arginine 281 respectively (Fig. 4A). Sequence analyses revealed that the tPA-cleavage region “ISGNALRYAPDG” is highly conserved in NR1 subunits of NMDA receptors, whatever the species analyzed, and not found in other NMDA receptor subunits (data not shown). The analysis of the homology model of the ATD of the NR1 subunit (Fig. 4, B and C) shows that the Arg-260 is located close to the entry of a hydrophobic pocket for which no ligand has been described so far.Fig. 4Mass spectrometric analysis of both native and tPA-cleaved ATD of the NR1 subunit. A, recombinant ATD-NR1–1a and ATD-NR1–1b were incubated in the presence of tPA (20 μg/ml, 2 h, 37 °C) prior to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Mass spectrometry analyses of both full-length ATD-NR1–1a and ATD-NR1–1b and tPA-cleaved ATD-NR1–1a and ATD-NR1–1b were performed after in-gel digest procedure (tryptic digestion) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Peptides identified from corresponding full-length ATD-NR1 and tPA-cleaved ATD-NR1 are summarized in the Table I. The comparison of the peptidic profiles obtained between full-length ATD and tPA-cleaved ATD allows the identification of the tPA cleavage site. Peptide EISGNALR (bold characters) corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal peptide identified following cleavage induced by tPA. ISGNALRYAPDG was designed as the peptide containing the tPA cleavage site Arg-260 (recapitulative of three individual experiments for each isoform of NR1 subunit).

https://openalex.org/W1979192889,"The MarR family of transcriptional regulators comprises a subset of winged helix DNA-binding proteins and includes numerous members that function in environmental surveillance of aromatic compounds. We describe the characterization of HucR, a novel MarR homolog from Deinococcus radiodurans that demonstrates phenolic sensing capabilities. HucR binds as a homodimer to a single site within its promoter/operator region with Kd = 0.29 +/- 0.02 nM. The HucR binding site contains a pseudopalindromic sequence, composed of 8-bp half-sites separated by 2 bp. The location of the HucR binding site in the intergenic region between hucR and a putative uricase suggests a mechanism of simultaneous co-repression of these two genes. The substrate of uricase, uric acid, is an efficient antagonist of DNA binding, reducing HucR-DNA complex formation to 50% at 0.26 mM ligand, compared with 5.2 and 46 mM for the aromatic compounds salicylate and acetylsalicylate, respectively. Enhanced levels in vivo of hucR and uricase transcript and increased uricase activity under conditions of excess uric acid further indicate a novel regulatory mechanism of aromatic catabolism in D. radiodurans. Since uric acid is a scavenger of reactive oxygen species, we hypothesize that HucR is a participant in the intrinsic resistance of D. radiodurans to high levels of oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2011548937,"Mitochondrial respiration plays an important role in optimizing photosynthetic efficiency in plants. As yet, the mechanisms by which plant mitochondria sense and respond to changes in the environment are unclear, particularly when exposed to light. Here we describe the characterization of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant stm6, which was identified on the basis of impaired state transitions, a mechanism that regulates light harvesting in the chloroplast. The gene disrupted in stm6, termed Moc1, encodes a homologue of the human mitochondrial transcription termination factor (mTERF). MOC1 is targeted to the mitochondrion, and its expression is up-regulated in response to light. Loss of MOC1 causes a high light-sensitive phenotype and disrupts the transcription and expression profiles of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes causing, as compared with wild type, light-mediated changes in the expression levels of nuclear and mitochondrial encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunits and ubiquinone-NAD subunits. The absence of MOC1 leads to a reduction in the levels of cytochrome c oxidase and of rotenone-insensitive external NADPH dehydrogenase activities of the mitochondrial respiratory electron transfer chain. Overall, we have identified a novel mitochondrial factor that regulates the composition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in the light so that it can act as an effective sink for reductant produced by the chloroplast.

In plant cells, respiration within the mitochondrion not only provides ATP but also serves an important role in the maintenance of an appropriate reduction/oxidation (redox) state within the chloroplast (1Krömer S.

Through the use of metabolite shuttles within the inner envelope membrane of the chloroplast, reducing equivalents produced by photosynthetic electron transport activity can be exported and consumed within the mitochondrion through respiration (2Flügge U.-I.

Plant J. 2004; 37: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Two types of oxidases catalyze reduction of oxygen: a typical cyanide-sensitive cytochrome c oxidase and a cyanide-insensitive family of alternative oxidases. Cytochrome oxidase is coupled to ATP synthesis, whereas the alternative oxidase is not and possibly acts as a valve to allow oxidation of the ubiquinone pool (6Millenaar F.F. Lambers H. Plant Biol. (N. Y.). 2003; 5: 2-15Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A key signaling molecule in the chloroplast thylakoid membrane is plastoquinone (PQ), which according to its redox state appears to control gene transcription in the chloroplast (7Pfannschmidt T. Nilsson A. Allen J. Nature. 1999; 397: 625-628Crossref Scopus (476) Google Scholar) and to regulate light harvesting, which in turn appears to control the ratio of linear to cyclic electron flow in algal chloroplasts (8Finazzi G. Rappaport F. Furia A. Fleischmann M. Rochaix J.-D. Zito F. Forti G. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Because the redox state of the plastoquinone pool is affected by mitochondrial respiration in the dark (9Bulté L. Gans P. Rebéille F. Wollman F.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 72-80Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and possibly in the light, the mitochondrion has the capacity to influence both chloroplast function and development. Important evidence for the role of the respiratory chain in optimizing photosynthesis (10Dutilleul C. Driscoll S. Cornic G. DePaepe R. Foyer C.H. Noctor G. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 264-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 11Duby F. Matagne R.F. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 115-125PubMed Google Scholar, 12Huertas I.E. Colman B. Espie G.S.

Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 2010-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and the development of the chloroplast (14Gu D.M. Newton K.J. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) has come from analysis of mutants lacking various respiratory complexes, as well as through the use of various mitochondrial-specific inhibitors (15Gans P. Wollman F.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1228: 51-57Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). It is already known that the mitochondrial proteome changes in the light. For instance, in potato, expression of a nucleus-encoded internal rotenone-insensitive NADH dehydrogenase (NDA1) is switched on by light, probably to oxidize NADH produced during photorespiration (16Svensson A.S. Rasmusson A.G. Plant J. 2001; 28: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, there is no information about how expression of the mitochondrial genome is coordinated with the rest of the cell in response to light stress. One approach to identify components that are important for the redox-controlled regulation of photosynthesis, including factors possibly involved in mitochondrial gene expression, is to screen for mutants that are perturbed in state transitions. This is a redox-controlled mechanism that balances the excitation of the two photosynthetic reaction centers involved in linear electron flow, photosystems I and II (17Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 172: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 18Bonaventura C. Myers J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 189: 366-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). When the PQ pool, which is a component of the electron transport chain linking PSII and PSI, becomes more reduced, mobile light-harvesting antennae detach from PSII, following redox-activated phosphorylation, and dock with PSI, thus increasing the excitation of PSI and driving the PQ pool to become more oxidized (into so-called state 2). The reverse process occurs when the PQ becomes more oxidized (to achieve state 1) (19Allen J.F. Bennett J. Steinback K.E. Arntzen C.J. Nature. 1981; 291: 21-25Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 20Horton P. Allen J.F. Black M.T. Bennett J. FEBS Lett. 1981; 125: 193-196Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We and others have developed a rapid chlorophyll fluorescence-based screen to identify colonies of the model organism, the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, that are blocked in state transitions (the interconversion of state 1 and state 2) (21Fleischmann M.M.

Schmid G.H. Mullineaux C.W. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 61: 43-51Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mutants identified in such screens are beginning to identify the key genes involved in regulating state transitions (23Depège N. Bellafiore S. Rochaix J.-D. Science. 2003; 299: 1572-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Here we identify another gene that is important for state transitions. Surprisingly, the gene product is targeted to the mitochondrion, not the chloroplast, and is involved in regulating mitochondrial gene expression. Strains and Culture Conditions—The C. reinhardtii strain CC 1618 (arg7 cw15, mt-) was obtained from the Chlamydomonas Genetics Center Collection (Duke University, Raleigh, NC) and used as WT control in all experiments. WT13(mt+) is derived from the original WT 137c strain (Jacqueline Girard-Bascou, Paris, provided by Dr. Saul Purton, University College London, UK) and was used for segregation experiments. All strains used were cultivated mixotrophically in TAP medium (Tris acetate-phosphate, pH 7.0) by illumination with 40 μmol m-2 s-1 white light at 20 °C (24Harris E. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989Google Scholar) in a 12-h light-dark cycle to a cell density of 2 × 106 cells/ml. When required (for the arginine auxotroph strain CC1618) the medium was supplemented with 110 μg of arginine/ml. Mutant Construction and Genetic Analysis—Nuclear transformation was performed as described following the methods of Refs. 25Kindle K.L. Schnell R.A. Fernández E. Levebvre P.A. J.

Genetic crosses were performed with WT13 and the mutant as described by Ref. 24Harris E. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use.

Complementation—For complementation, a co-transformation strategy was established using the Cry1 gene as a dominant selectable marker conferring resistance to emetine (plasmid p613) (31Nelson J.A.E. Savereide P.B. Lefebvre P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4011-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) together with a 37-kb Moc1-containing cosmid. The cosmid was isolated from a cosmid library (kind gift of Dr. Saul Purton) by hybridization experiments using a specific probe derived from the 500-bp non-coding DNA region located between Moc1 and Toc1. Cells were grown in TAP medium, harvested in the late logarithmic growth phase (OD750 nm = 0.8) and resuspended in TAP-1/10 N. The suspension was used in glass bead transformations, and transformed cells were collected in TAP-1/10 N medium and incubated for 4 days. Cells were then resuspended in TAP medium and incubated for another 8 days. Again, cells were pelleted, resuspended in TAP, spread over TAP agar plates, and grown for 12 days. Successful complementation was confirmed by PCR using Moc1-specific primers and by the recovery of state transitions as assayed by fluorescence video imaging. Fluorescence Video Imaging, Pulse Amplitude-modulated Fluorescence Spectroscopy, and 77 K Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Screening of the mutants for state transitions defects was performed as described earlier (22Kruse O.

Samples were measured following illumination with 40 μmol m-2 s-1 620 nm light to gain state 2. For state 1 images, pictures were taken in the same white light briefly after an illumination period of 15 min entirely with 80 μmol m-2 s-1 710 nm (Schott filter, Germany) of PSI light. Alternatively, cells were adjusted to state 2 by incubation in the dark for 30 min under nitrogen atmosphere according to Ref. 9Bulté L. Gans P. Rebéille F. Wollman F.-A. Biochim. Biophys.

The purity of the preparations was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-D2 (for possible chloroplast contamination) and anti-Cyt c (for possible mitochondria contamination). Isolation of Nucleic Acids, Northern Analysis, and RT-PCR—Northern analysis was performed according to Ref. 35Michel K.-P. Krüger F. Pühler A. Pistorius E.K. Microbiology (N.Y.). 1999; 145: 1473-1484PubMed Google Scholar. RT-PCR was used for semiquantitative transcript analysis using the GeneCraft™ Invitrogen procedure. Prior to RNA isolation, cells were cultivated in the dark until OD750 nm = 0.6 and, if desired, incubated for a further 4–6 h under different light conditions. RNA isolation was performed following a protocol of C. Admundsen (biosci.cbs.umn.edu/~amundsen/chlamy/methods/RNA_prrep.html) as described earlier (29Strauss C. Mussgnug J.H. Kruse O. Photosynth. Res. 2001; 70: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and DNA isolation using the DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen). Immunoblotting—Protein analysis by immunoblotting was performed as described earlier by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose membranes (22Kruse O. Nixon P.J. Schmid G.H. Mullineaux C.W. Photosynth.

Anti-MOC1 was produced by GenoSys from a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated 13-amino-acid synthetic peptide identical to the MOC1 C terminus. All antisera were polyclonal and used in conjunction with the anti-rabbit-IgG (Sigma)/anti-mouse-IgG (Sigma) alkaline phosphatase reaction or the CDP Star (Roche Applied Science) reaction, respectively. Protein Phosphorylation—Phosphorylated proteins were detected by Western analysis using polyclonal anti-phosphothreonine (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) in state 1- and state 2-adapted cells as described earlier (22Kruse O.

Lipid Peroxidation—Lipid peroxidation was measured indirectly by the concentration of malonyldialdehyde and other carbonyl byproducts of lipid peroxidation, which form a colored complex in reaction with thiobarbituric acid that can be monitored at 532 nm (36Singh D.P. Varna K. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 314-319Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Enzyme Activity Measurements—Cytochrome oxidase activity was measured in isolated mitochondria using a cytochrome c oxidase assay kit (Sigma) following the technical instructions. NADH:Q oxidoreductase activity and external NADPH oxidation activity were measured in isolated mitochondria according to Ref. 16Svensson A.S. Rasmusson A.G. Plant J. 2001; 28: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar. Mitochondria were osmotically burst in 1 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm EGTA for 6 min at room temperature to permeabilize the membrane. Isolation of State Transition Mutants—To identify genes involved in state transitions within C. reinhardtii, we screened a library of potentially tagged nuclear mutants that was generated through the random insertion of plasmid pArg7.8, carrying the Arg7 gene, into the nuclear genome of the arginine auxotrophic strain, CC1618 (27Debuchy R. Purton S. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2803-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 28Gumpel N.J. Purton S. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 299-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). By selecting on medium lacking arginine, only colonies containing Arg7 inserted into the nuclear genome were able to grow. A plate-based fluorescence video-imaging screen, which involves the recording of chlorophyll fluorescence from individual colonies before and after illumination with light that induces state transitions in WT, was used to identify potential state transition mutants (stm) (22Kruse O. Nixon P.J. Schmid G.H. Mullineaux C.W. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 61: 43-51Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Of the 2 × 104 colonies screened, seven possible stm mutants were identified. The characterization of mutant stm6 is described here. stm6 Is Blocked in State 1 and Impaired in PSII-LHC Phosphorylation in the Light—Chlorophyll fluorescence assays conducted by fluorescence emission spectroscopy at 77 K (Fig. 1a) and chlorophyll video imaging with actinic 620 nm light at room temperature (Fig. 1b) revealed that stm6 was blocked in state 1. In contrast to the WT, light preferentially absorbed by PSII was unable to drive the cells into state 2, which is monitored by an increase in the fluorescence coming from PSI at 720 nm (Fig. 1a). It should be noted that a transition to state 2 was blocked to a far less extent when the PQ pool was driven reduced in the dark through anaerobiosis (data not shown). This result indicated that the observed block in state transitions in stm6 was primarily a defect observed in the light. Since state 2 is associated with the phosphorylation of threonine residues in the light-harvesting (LHC) antenna proteins of PSII (19Allen J.F. Bennett J. Steinback K.E. Arntzen C.J. Nature. 1981; 291: 21-25Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), anti-phosphothreonine antibodies were used to assess the level of phosphorylation in immunoblots. Stm6 showed a marked reduction in the phosphorylation levels of CP29 (P9) and LHC-P11 proteins upon illumination conditions (state 2) that promote phosphorylation of these proteins in WT (Fig. 1c). Interestingly, the phosphorylation levels of the P13 and P17 proteins in stm6 in state 2 were comparable with WT levels, indicating regulatory differences in the phosphorylation mechanism between the various LHC proteins. Furthermore, no differences between WT and mutant were obtained when cultivated for 12 h in the dark (state 1). Control immunoblots confirmed that stm6 still contained WT levels of LHC proteins (Fig. 1c). As transition to state 2 in the light is controlled by the reduction state of the PQ pool, it was important to confirm that the PQ pool could be driven to a reduced state in the light. To test this, chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were performed to determine the photochemical quenching parameter, qp, from which 1 - qp, which is a measure of the reduction state of the PQ pool, can be calculated (32Lunde C. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. Nature. 2000; 408: 613-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Under growth light conditions, the PQ pool was in a more reduced state in stm6 as compared with WT (1 - qp of 0.77 in stm6 and 0.59 in WT) (Table I).Table IRedox state of plastoquinone (1-qp), lipid peroxidation rates (malonyldialdehyde (MDA)), respiration rates, and external NADPH oxidation activity (NDB1) of WT, stm6, and B13 strains cultivated in standard growth lightWTstm6B13Cyanide-insensitive oxygen uptakeSet to 100130 ± 5105 ± 5External NADPH oxidation activitySet to 10040 ± 10No dataMDA concentrationSet to 100230 ± 20110 ± 151-qp = 1-(Fm′ - Fs)/(Fm′ - Fo′)0.59 ± 0.020.77 ± 0.020.60 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab Disruption of a Single mterf-type Gene Encoding for a Mitochondrial Protein Is Responsible for the Phenotype of stm6 —To test whether the Arg marker carried by plasmid pArg7.8-φX174 was tightly linked to stm6, crosses were performed between WT13 (mt+) and stm6 and the progeny scored for the existence of φX174 DNA (by PCR) and the ability to do state transitions as assessed by video imaging. Of the 50 progeny that contained φX174 DNA, all showed impaired state transitions. In contrast, all progeny lacking φX174 DNA showed normal state transitions (data not shown). These data suggested that stm6 was an Arg-tagged mutant. A combination of plasmid rescue and ligation-mediated suppression-PCR led to the identification of the site of insertion of the Arg marker in stm6 (Fig. 2a). Sequencing and PCR analysis revealed that stm6 contained an insertion of two pArg7.8 plasmids at a single site (Fig. 2a) and the deletion of ∼2 kb of genomic DNA (Fig. 2a). Subsequent sequence analysis and homology searches revealed that two genes were affected by the random integration of the two pArg7.8 plasmids. One gene was described previously as a nuclear transposon (Toc1) (37Day A. Schirmer-Rahire M. Kuchka M.R. Mayfield S.P. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1917-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); the second gene had not been described previously and was subsequently designated Moc1 (mterf-like gene of Chlamydomonas) (AF531421). PCR analysis in stm6 and WT using a 5′-specific Moc1-primer and a second primer derived from the Arg marker resulted in the amplification of a 1005-bp PCR product in stm6. This confirmed that the insertion caused a partial deletion of Moc1, leaving the 5′ region of the gene untouched. The precise site of insertion of the pArg7.8 plasmids was confirmed through sequencing PCR fragments spanning the insertion sites. Overall, ∼2 kb of the genome was deleted in stm6, extending from the 3′ region of Moc1 to the 5′ region of Toc1 (Fig. 2a). To confirm that disruption of Moc1 caused the phenotype of stm6, complementation experiments were performed using a cosmid containing the Moc1 gene, which had been isolated from a cosmid library (kind gift of Dr. Saul Purton). DNA sequencing and PCR analysis revealed that this cosmid contained a 12-kb insert consisting of the entire Moc1 gene together with 2 and 5 kb of upstream and downstream flanking sequences, respectively. No other large open reading frames were identified in the insert of the cosmid. Complementation was performed using a co-transformation approach using the Moc1-containing cosmid in combination with a second vector containing the Cry1 gene conferring emetine resistance as a dominant selectable marker (31Nelson J.A.E. Savereide P.B. Lefebvre P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4011-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Of ∼200 emetine-resistant colonies assessed, four were found to have incorporated the intact Moc1 gene into the genome. These four colonies were able to express MOC1 and perform WT-like state transitions as assessed by fluorescence video imaging. According to previous slightly different two-plasmid co-transformation approaches (65Stevens D.R. Rochaix J.D. Purton S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 23-30PubMed Google Scholar, 66Hippler M. Drepper F. Haehnel W. Rochaix J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7339-7344Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), a success rate of 2% with both transformed genes functionally expressed was expected. One of these colonies, B13, was examined in more detail and found to exhibit a clear WT phenotype with no perturbations in light acclimation (see Figs. 1, a and b, 4, and 6a and Table 1). In contrast, 9 out of the 200 emetine-resistant colonies that contained only fragments of the Moc1 gene as assessed by PCR were unable to perform state transitions. From these data, we conclude that Moc1 is required for functional light acclimation in C. reinhardtii.Fig. 6ATP level, cytochrome c, oxidase and NADH:Q oxidoreductase activity measurements in WT, stm6, and B13.a, ATP levels in cells of WT, stm6, and B13 grown in the light and dark. b, specific activities of cytochrome c oxidase and NADH:Q oxidoreductase in isolated mitochondria from WT and stm6 cells cultivated in the dark (D) and subsequently exposed to 6 h 200 μmol m-2 s-1 light (L).

Micol V. Hess D. Aebersold R. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8124-8130Google Scholar). RT-PCR experiments confirmed that Moc1 was not expressed in stm6 (Fig. 2b). Anti-peptide antibodies raised against MOC1 were used to confirm that MOC1 was targeted to the mitochondrion rather than the chloroplast (Fig. 2c). Overall, there were striking similarities to the 35-kDa human mTERF protein (34% based on alignments covering the full-length sequences) (Fig. 3) and their homologues in Drosophila melanogaster (DmTTF (39Roberti M. Polosa P.L. Bruni F. Musicco C. Gadaleta M.N. Cantatore P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1597-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)) and sea urchin (mtDBP (40Loguericio P.P. Roberti M. Musicco C. Gadaleta M.N. Quagliariello E. Cantatore P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1890-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)). Human mTERF binds downstream of tRNA genes and is thought to be involved in controlling the amount of tRNA and rRNA synthesized within the mitochondrion as well as the expression of other mitochondrial genes and consequently the functionality of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (41Fernandez-Silva P.

Interestingly, nine homologues to MOC1 with mTerf domains have been identified in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana, four of which are predicted to be targeted to the mitochondrion (At1g61980, At2g44020, At4g02990, At2g03050) and one of which is predicted to be targeted to the chloroplast (At5g55580). Analysis of the Chlamydomonas nuclear genome data base, plus DNA hybridization experiments (data not shown), suggest that there is only one copy of Moc1 in C. reinhardtii.

When fluorescently labeled Hsp104 was added to the preformed fibers, individual fibers were fluorescently decorated uniformly along the fiber length. However, the density of fluorescence differed from one fiber to another, indicating the presence of subspecies of Sup35NM fibers. The time course of fiber formation from monomer Sup35NM was delayed by Hsp104. Hsp104-mediated fragmentation of fibers was tested using bead-tethered fibers. In contrast with the recent report (Shorter, J., and Lindquist, S. (2004) Science 304, 1793–1797), Hsp104 alone was unable to sever the fibers. Yeast cell lysate or the Hsp104-deficient cell lysate plus Hsp104 caused ATP-dependent, guanidine hydrochloride-sensitive fragmentation of the fibers. Thus, in our experimental setup, Hsp104 plus other factor(s) in the yeast cytosol are required for severing yeast prion fiber.

The potential of xanthine oxidase to generate superoxide radical anion, hydrogen peroxide, and peroxynitrite has been extensively explored in pathophysiological contexts. Here we demonstrate that xanthine oxidase turnover at physiological pH produces a strong one-electron oxidant, the carbonate radical anion. The radical was shown to be produced from acetaldehyde oxidation by xanthine oxidase in the presence of catalase and bicarbonate on the basis of several lines of evidence such as oxidation of both dihydrorhodamine 123 and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide and chemiluminescence and isotope labeling/mass spectrometry studies. In the case of xanthine oxidase acting upon xanthine and hypoxanthine as substrates, carbonate radical anion production was also evidenced by the oxidation of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide and of dihydrorhodamine 123 in the presence of uricase. The results indicated that Fenton chemistry occurring in the bulk solution is not necessary for carbonate radical anion production. Under the conditions employed, the radical was likely to be produced at the enzyme active site by reduction of a peroxymonocarbonate intermediate whose formation and reduction is facilitated by the many xanthine oxidase redox centers. In addition to indicating that the carbonate radical anion may be an important mediator of the pathophysiological effects of xanthine oxidase, the results emphasize the potential of the bicarbonate-carbon dioxide pair as a source of biological oxidants.

Xanthine oxidoreductase is a complex enzyme comprising two identical subunits of Mr 145,000 each containing one molybdenum, one FAD, and two nonidentical iron sulfur centers (reviewed in Refs. 1Massey V.

Largely because of its easy isolation from cow milk, xanthine oxidoreductase has been used as a model protein for structural and mechanistic studies of redox enzymes for over 60 years. Although xanthine oxidoreductase has broad specificity for both oxidizing and reducing substrates, its conventionally accepted role is in purine metabolism, where it sequentially catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and of xanthine to uric acid. In mammals, the enzyme exists in two interconvertible forms: xanthine dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.204), which predominates in vivo, and xanthine oxidase (XO 1The abbreviations used are: XO, xanthine oxidase; bicarbonate, the sum of bicarbonate (HCO–3) and carbon dioxide (CO2) unless specified; DHR, dihydrorhodamine 123; DMPO, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide; DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid; peroxynitrite, the sum of peroxynitrite anion (ONOO–, oxoperoxonitrate (–1)) and peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH, hydrogen oxoperoxonitrate) unless specified; MS, mass spectrometry.1The abbreviations used are: XO, xanthine oxidase; bicarbonate, the sum of bicarbonate (HCO–3) and carbon dioxide (CO2) unless specified; DHR, dihydrorhodamine 123; DMPO, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide; DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid; peroxynitrite, the sum of peroxynitrite anion (ONOO–, oxoperoxonitrate (–1)) and peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH, hydrogen oxoperoxonitrate) unless specified; MS, mass spectrometry.; EC 1.1.3.22), which is the form usually isolated from biological sources. The enzyme is widely distributed throughout different mammalian tissues, but particularly high activities have been found in the liver and intestine (reviewed in Refs. 1Massey V. Harris C.M. Biochem.

The potential of the enzyme to generate superoxide radical anion and hydrogen peroxide has led to widespread interest in its roles in numerous pathological states, including ischemia-reperfusion, hypoxia-reoxygenation, multiple organ dysfunction, preservation-transplantation, and vascular disease (3Harrison R.

Possible roles of XO in pathological processes have been reinforced by the recent demonstration that it may also generate reactive nitrogen species such as peroxynitrite, which is a potent biological oxidant. Indeed, XO has been shown to be able to use both NADH and xanthine to reduce nitrite to nitric oxide (11Millar T.M. Stevens C.R. Benjamin N. Eisenthal R. Harrison R. Blake D.R.

Relevantly, XO has been proposed by Hodgson and Fridovich (17Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) to be able to generate yet another strong one-electron oxidant, the carbonate radical anion. Formation of this radical through Fenton chemistry was proposed to explain the low level chemiluminescence detected in incubations of acetaldehyde, XO, and bicarbonate at pH 10.2 (Reactions 1–3, 4–9) (17Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Buxton G.V. Elliot A.J. Radiat. Phys. Chem. 1986; 27 (1986): 241-243Google Scholar). There has been a renewed interest in the pathophysiological roles of the carbonate radical anion since its direct EPR detection from flow mixtures of peroxynitrite with the bicarbonate-carbon dioxide pair in aqueous solutions at physiological pH (19Bonini M.G. Radi R. Ferrer-Sueta G. Ferreira A.M. Augusto O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10802-10806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In addition to being considered an important mediator of peroxynitrite effects in vivo (reviewed in Refs. 20Radi R. Denicola A. Alvarez B. Ferrer-Sueta G. Rubbo H. Ignarro L.J.

A. 2004; 101: 743-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), whose relationship to the familial amyothophic lateral sclerosis disease remains under scrutiny. Recently, we proposed that XO turnover at neutral pH could be another route for the biological formation of the carbonate radical anion (Fig. 1) (21Augusto O. Bonini M.G. Amanso A.M. Linares E. Santos C.X.C. Menezes S.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 841-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). This proposition was based on the fact that the electrons coming from the oxidizing substrate flow through the many redox centers of XO, opening the possibility for production/escape of intermediates that are partially reduced/protonated such as the superoxide radical anion and the deprotonated peroxide (8Hodges G.R. Young M.J. Paul T. Ingold K.U. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The latter could react with surrounding carbon dioxide to produce peroxymonocarbonate that either leaves the active site and acts as a two-electron oxidant (26Bonini M.G. Fernandes D.C. Augusto O. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Richardson D.E. Yao H. Frank K.M. Bennet D.A. J. Am. Chem.

Santos C.X.C. Menezes S.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 841-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Here, we tested this proposal by using several methodologies to examine XO-mediated oxidation of acetaldehyde, hypoxanthine, and xanthine in the absence and presence of bicarbonate and catalase at neutral pH. Chemicals—XO (from bovine milk, grade III) was purchased from Sigma or Calbiochem. Both samples produced similar results, and XO from Sigma was used in most of the reported experiments. DHR was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Isotope-labeled water (H218O; 96.9%) was purchased from Isotec (Miamisburg, OH). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma, Merck, or Fluka and were analytical grade or better. Peroxynitrite was synthesized and quantified as previously described (19Bonini M.G. Radi R. Ferrer-Sueta G. Ferreira A.M. Augusto O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10802-10806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). All solutions and buffers were prepared with distilled water purified with a Millipore Milli-Q system. All buffers were treated with Chellex-100 to remove trace amounts of metal ion contaminants prior to use. Concentrations of carbon dioxide were calculated from the added bicarbonate concentrations by using pKa 6.4 (19Bonini M.G. Radi R. Ferrer-Sueta G. Ferreira A.M. Augusto O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10802-10806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). XO Activity—XO activity was monitored spectrophotometrically at 295 nm immediately before each set of experiments through its ability to oxidize xanthine to uric acid (ϵ = 9,600 m–1 s–1) (30Avis P.G. Bergel F. Bray R.C. J. Chem. Soc. 1956; : 1219-1226Crossref Google Scholar). In some experiments, XO activity was also monitored by superoxide radical anion production that was followed by cytochrome c Fe(III) (50 μm) reduction at 550 nm (Δϵ = 21,000 m–1 cm–1) (31McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DHR Oxidation—DHR was dissolved in acetonitrile to a 10 mm final concentration and stored under argon protected from light. DHR (80–100 μm) was incubated with the various systems, and its oxidation was monitored either spectrophometrically at 500 nm (ϵ = 78,800 m–1 s–1) or fluorimetrically (32Crow J.P. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). In the latter case, a TECAN Spectrafluor Plus fluorimeter was employed, and the wavelengths were selected through the use of optical filters as 492 and 535 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. Chemiluminescence Studies—Light emission was measured with a photocounting device consisting of a red-sensitive photomultiplier tube (9203BM Thor EMI Electron Tubes) cooled to –20 °C with a thermoelectric cooler (FACT 50 MKIII; EMI Gencom, Plainview, NY) as described elsewhere (33Cadenas E. Sies H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 34Miyamoto S. Martinez G.R. Medeiros M.H. Di Mascio P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6172-6179Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The potential applied to the photomultiplier was –1,200 V. The phototube output was connected to an amplifier discriminator (model 1121; Princeton Instruments, NJ), which transmitted the signal to a computer. Light emissions at specified wavelength intervals were obtained with cut-off filters (Melles Griot Inc., Carlsbad, CA) placed between the cuvette and the photomultiplier. All sample components were mixed and poured into a mirrored walls glass cuvette (35 × 7 × 55 mm) maintained at 25 °C. Concentrated peroxynitrite or acetaldehyde stock solutions were then injected into the cuvette until they reached the concentrations specified in the legend of Fig. 9. The infusion was made with a Havard apparatus pump 22, and the mixture was kept under continuous stirring. The chemiluminescence signal was monitored during the injection and after mixing of the reagents. EPR Spin Trapping Studies—EPR spectra were recorded at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C) on a Bruker EMX spectrometer equipped with an ER4122 SHQ 9807 high sensitivity cavity. The incubation mixtures were transferred to flat cells, and the spectra were typically recorded 1 min after the substrate addition. HPLC/Mass Spectrometry Studies—The enzymatic incubations were maintained for 4 h at room temperature, transferred to a refrigerator, and analyzed within 24 h. For analysis, they were injected into a Shimadzu HPLC system (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) connected to a Quatro II mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK). The HPLC system was composed of two LC-10AD VP pumps connected to an SPD-10AV VP UV-visible detector controlled by a communication bus module SLC-10AD VP A. HPLC separations were performed with a Phenomenex C-18 reverse phase column (50 × 1.0 mm; 3-μm particle size) (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) equipped with a C-18 reverse phase guard column (20 × 2.1 mm; 5-μm particle size) (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA). The columns were eluted with a gradient (0–20 min/0–40% B) of solvent A (water containing 0.1% acetic acid) and solvent B (acetonitrile/tetrahydrofuran (9:1 (v/v) containing 0.1% acetic acid) at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. The eluent was monitored at 254 nm and analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in the positive ion mode. The source temperature of the mass spectrometer was maintained at 110 °C, and the cone voltage was set to 25 V. The capillary potential and the high electrode potential were set to 3.0 and 0.5 kV, respectively. Full scan data were acquired in the range of 70–270 m/z by means of the Mass Lynx NT software (Micromass, Manchester, UK). Production of Radicals Monitored by DHR Oxidation—DHR oxidation to rhodamine occurs by a radical mechanism, and the process has been used to detect the production of radicals and ferryl intermediates (32Crow J.P. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Here we show that DHR (80 μm) is oxidized in incubations containing acetaldehyde (5 mm) and XO (10 milliunits/ml) in phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at 25 °C in the absence and presence of bicarbonate (100 mm) (Fig. 2). The small accelerating effect of bicarbonate on the initial rate of DHR oxidation (1.3 times) was reproducible but difficult to discriminate under these conditions where, most likely, Fenton chemistry in the bulk solution predominates (Reactions 1–3, 4–8). Indeed, DHR is oxidized by the hydroxyl radical but not by superoxide radical anion or hydrogen peroxide (32Crow J.P. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) that are produced during XO turnover (Reactions 1–3) (4Morpeth F.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 744: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 5McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5753-5760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Fridovich I. J. Biol.

Young M.J. Paul T. Ingold K.U. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the latter species can produce the hydroxyl radical (Reaction 4), because XO carries tightly bound iron ions (35Lloyd R.V. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17633-17636Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 36Britigan B.E. Pou S. Rosen G.M. Lilleg D.M. Buettner G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17533-17538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, the addition of catalase (200 units/ml) greatly inhibited DHR oxidation, and the accelerating effect of 100 mm bicarbonate became more pronounced (3.5 times) (Fig. 2). The further addition of iron-superoxide dismutase (30 units/ml) and DTPA (0.1 mm) marginally affected the DHR oxidation rate in the presence of bicarbonate (Fig. 2), suggesting that catalase addition was enough to minimize Fenton chemistry during acetaldehyde oxidation by XO. The iron-superoxide dismutase enzyme was used in these experiments, because it has not been reported to display the peroxidase activity that oxidizes the bicarbonate/carbon dioxide pair in contrast with the Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase enzyme (22Zhang H. Joseph J. Felix C. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14038-14045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 23Zhang H. Joseph J. Gurney M. Becker D. Kalyanaraman B.

Thus, the possibility of XO turnover producing the carbonate radical anion by mechanisms other than Fenton chemistry (Fig. 1) (21Augusto O. Bonini M.G. Amanso A.M. Linares E. Santos C.X.C. Menezes S.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 841-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) was further examined in the presence of catalase (200 units/ml). In most experiments, DTPA (0.1 mm) was also present. Under these conditions, the presence of bicarbonate (50–200 mm) accelerated DHR oxidation to an extent that was roughly dependent on the anion concentration (Fig. 3). The possibility of a higher rate of DHR oxidation being the result of a modulating effect of bicarbonate on enzyme activity (37Chen Y. Cann M.J. Litvin T.N. Iourgenko V. Sinclair M.L. Levin L.R. Buck J. Science. 2000; 298: 625-628Crossref Scopus (685) Google Scholar) was excluded by experiments showing that bicarbonate (100–200 mm) had marginal effects on cytochrome c-Fe(III) reduction by acetaldehyde/XO (data not shown). Relevantly, the rate of cytochrome c-Fe(III) reduction increased with the pH, whereas the rate of DHR oxidation decreased (Fig. 4). This behavior further excludes the possibility that DHR oxidation is being mediated by carbonate radical anions produced through Fenton chemistry in the bulky solution. In this case, a higher oxidation rate would be expected at alkaline pH, because the hydroxyl radical reacts much faster with the carbonate (Reaction 8) than with bicarbonate anion (Reaction 7) (17Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Buxton G.V. Elliot A.J. Radiat. Phys. Chem. 1986; 27 (1986): 241-243Google Scholar).Fig. 4Initial rates of DHR oxidation and cytochrome c-Fe(III) reduction by acetaldehyde/XO/catalase/bicarbonate as a function of the pH. The reaction mixtures contained acetaldehyde (5 mm), XO (10 milliunits/ml), catalase (200 units/ml), bicarbonate (100 mm), and DHR (80 μm) or cytochrome c-Fe(III) (50 μm) in phosphate buffer (250 mm) of the specified pH values and were incubated at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C). The values shown are the mean ± S.D. of three independent determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Replacement of acetaldehyde (1–5 mm) with hypoxanthine or xanthine (80–200 μm) as the oxidizing XO substrate, abolished the accelerating effects of bicarbonate on DHR oxidation (see, for instance, Fig. 5, inset). This was not surprising, because purines and their oxidation product uric acid, in particular, react very rapidly with the carbonate radical anion (21Augusto O. Bonini M.G. Amanso A.M. Linares E. Santos C.X.C. Menezes S.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 841-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 38Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24621-24626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In agreement, the addition of uric acid (80 μm) to the incubations containing acetaldehyde/bicarbonate/catalase/XO strongly inhibited DHR oxidation (Fig. 3, inset). Although uric acid has been described as an XO inhibitor (39Tan S. Radi R. Gaudier F. Evans R.A. Rivera A. Kirk K.A. Parks D.A. Pediatr. Res. 1993; 34: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), its inhibitory efficiency is not enough to explain the lack of DHR oxidation under the experimental conditions of Fig. 3. In order to circumvent the fast reaction between the carbonate radical anion and uric acid, the experiments using xanthine and hypoxanthine as substrates were performed in the presence of uricase. In addition, DHR oxidation was monitored by fluorescence due to its greater sensitivity as compared with UV-visible spectroscopy. Under these conditions, a clear effect of bicarbonate in accelerating DHR oxidation promoted by xanthine/XO/catalase and hypoxanthine/XO/catalase was observed (Fig. 5). Bicarbonate effects were undetectable in the absence of uricase (Fig. 5, inset). These results further indicate that uric acid, the final oxidation product of XO-mediated oxidation of hypoxanthine and xanthine, precludes carbonate radical anion detection through DHR oxidation. Indeed, due to solubility constraints, DHR should be used at low concentration (≤100 μm), and such concentrations are probably not enough to compete with uric acid for the carbonate radical anion (also see below). The above results suggest that oxidation of acetaldehyde, hypoxanthine, or xanthine by XO in the presence of bicarbonate and catalase at neutral pH produces a strong one-electron oxidant, most likely the carbonate radical anion. Production of Radicals Monitored by Spin Trapping—The carbonate radical anion does not produce stable radical adducts with the currently available spin traps, but it oxidizes DMPO, possibly to the corresponding cation radical that, upon water addition, produces the EPR-detectable DMPO/·OH radical adduct (Fig. 6, inset) (22Zhang H.

Thus, we examined the effect of bicarbonate addition (50–200 mm) on the yields of DMPO/·OH produced from acetaldehyde/XOD/catalase (Fig. 6). In the absence of bicarbonate, the resulting EPR spectrum was dominated by that of the DMPO/·COCH3 radical adduct (labeled as ○ in Fig. 6) (40Nakao L.S. Ouchi D. Augusto O. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 41Nakao L.S. Kadiiska M.B. Mason R.P. Grijalba M.T. Augusto O. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with some contribution of those of the DMPO/·OOH and DMPO/·OH radical adduct, particularly the first. Upon the addition of increasing concentrations of bicarbonate, the resulting EPR spectra presented increasing levels of the DMPO/·OH radical adduct (labeled as ×) (Fig. 6, B–D). The results shown in Fig. 6 are indicative of carbonate radical production but are not unambiguous, because the DMPO/·OH radical adduct is also produced from DMPO attack by the hydroxyl radical. To exclude a main role for the hydroxyl radical in the formation of the DMPO/·OH radical adduct detected under our experimental conditions (Fig. 6), we repeated the experiments in the presence of Me2SO (2 m) (Fig. 7, A and B). The latter does not react with the carbonate radical anion but does react with the hydroxyl radical to produce the methyl radical, which, in turn, reacts with DMPO to produce the DMPO/·CH3 radical adduct (22Zhang H. Joseph J. Felix C. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14038-14045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Zhang H. Andrekopoulos C. Joseph J. Chandran K.

The addition of Me2SO to the acetaldehyde/XO/catalase/bicarbonate system, however, did not produce the DMPO/·CH3 radical adduct or changed the yield of the DMPO/·OH radical adduct (Fig 7, A and B). In contrast, under our experimental conditions, tryptophan and a tyrosine analogue (4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) that react fast with the carbonate radical anion (21Augusto O. Bonini M.G. Amanso A.M.

Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Thus ENaC plays a pivotal role in Na+ and concomitant water (re)absorption across many epithelial tissues making it a centrally positioned effector for hormones and other factors that modulate systemic blood pressure and epithelial surface hydration (3Garty H.

Although it is accepted that ENaC activity is dynamically controlled by regulation of channel localization to the luminal plasma membrane and channel gating, little is known about the cellular control points impinging upon this modulation.Membrane phospholipids such as PI(4,5)P2 influence the activity of ion channels, including ENaC, by influencing channel open probability and membrane levels (5Ma H.P.

We have demonstrated previously that small G proteins within the Ras family (e.g. K-RasA) augment ENaC activity by stimulating PI3K signaling (8Staruschenko A. Patel P. Tong Q. Medina J.L. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37771-37778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with the phospholipid products of this lipid kinase (PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3) increasing channel open probability. Regulation of ENaC by other small G proteins has not been reported.RhoA and Rac1 are small, monomeric G proteins within the Rho family of GTPases (9Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem.

Similar to other small G proteins, these GTPases act as molecular switches cycling between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states. In the GTP-bound state, Rho GTPases interact with effector molecules such as Rho kinase to initiate downstream responses. Both RhoA and Rac1 as well as Rho kinase increase PI(4,5)P2 levels by activating PI(4)P 5-K (11Oude Weernink P.A. Schulte P. Guo Y. Wetzel J. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Haverland S. Voss M. Schmidt M.

Through this phospholipid second messenger and other adapter proteins, Rho GTPases influence vesicle movement impacting endocytosis as well as exocytosis of integral plasma membrane proteins (14Klussmann E.

Moreover, Rho GTPase signaling increases the membrane levels of the transient receptor potential channel TRPC5 through a PI(4)P 5-K-dependent process (21Bezzerides V.J. Ramsey I.S. Kotecha S. Greka A. Clapham D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Thus, although the possibility that RhoA regulates ENaC activity has not been directly studied, a variety of ion channels are now beginning to be recognized as final effectors for RhoA and other GTPases within this family.The current study asked whether Rho GTPases influence ENaC activity and whether phospholipid signaling was a component of this regulation. We find that RhoA and Rac1 increase ENaC activity with Rho kinase necessary for this activation. Similarly, the downstream RhoA-Rho kinase effector PI(4)P 5-K augments ENaC activity, and RhoA is unable to enhance ENaC activity when generation of PI(4,5)P2 is disrupted. The major effect of RhoA on ENaC was to increase the plasma membrane levels of this channel. We conclude that RhoA-Rho kinase signaling stimulates PI(4)P 5-K to increase PI(4,5)P2 levels with dependent increases in the plasma membrane levels of ENaC.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All chemicals were of reagent grade and were purchased from either Calbiochem, BioMol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), or Sigma unless noted otherwise.

Current through ENaC was the inward, amiloride-sensitive Na+ current with a bath solution containing (in mm) 160 NaCl, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4) and a pipette solution containing (in mm) 120 CsCl, 5 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4), 2.0 ATP, and 0.1 GTP. In experiments with GDPβS, the 0.1 mm GTP in the pipette was replaced with 2 mm GDPβS. For experiments in which proteins were added directly to the recording pipette, Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme was dissolved in the pipette solution at 5 μg/ml. Where specified, cells were incubated with 10 μm PD98059 (2′-amino-3′methoxyflavone, 5 h), 1 μm Y27632 ((+)-R-trans-4-(aminoethyl)-N-(4-pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide 2 HCl H2O, 1 h), 50 μm LY294002 (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one, 5 h), and 200 nm (5 h) or 50 μm (30 min) wortmannin. Current recordings were acquired with an Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) interfaced via a Digidata 1322A (Axon Instruments) to a personal computer running the pClamp 9 suite of software (Axon Instruments). All currents were filtered at 1 kHz. Both a family of test pulses (500 ms each), stepping by 20-mV increments form a holding potential of 30 to 60 mV to –100 mV, and voltage ramps (300 ms) from 100 to –120 mV were used to generate current-voltage (I-V) relations and to measure ENaC activity at –80 mV. Whole cell capacitance was routinely compensated and was approximately ∼ 8 pF for CHO cells. Series resistances, on average 2–4 megohms, were also compensated.Membrane Labeling Experiments—Membrane labeling experiments closely followed those described previously (27Ishizaki T. Uehata M. Tamechika I. Keel J. Nonomura K. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 976-983PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, COS-7 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged ENaC in the absence and presence of wild type, constitutively active, and dominant negative RhoA. 48 h after transfection cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 8.0) and subsequently incubated with 1 mm sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0) for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and extracted in gentle lysis buffer (1.0% Nonidet P-40), cleared, and normalized for total protein concentration. Pre-equilibrated streptavidin-agarose beads were agitated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μg of total protein. Agarose beads were then washed six times with gentle lysis buffer and subsequently resuspended in SDS sample buffer and 20 mm dithiothreitol, heated at 85 °C for 10 min, run on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of SDS, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-Myc antibody in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 5% dried milk and 0.1% Tween 20.Statistics—All patch clamp data are presented as mean ± S.E. Paired and unpaired data were compared using appropriate t tests with p ≤ 0.01 considered significant.RESULTSRho GTPases Increase ENaC Activity—To investigate the actions of Rho GTPases on ENaC, we focused on the two representative family members RhoA and Rac1. For these studies, we reconstituted human ENaC (hENaC) in CHO cells in the absence and presence of co-expressed wild type, constitutively active (G14V), and dominant negative (T19N) RhoA and wild type Rac1. hENaC was reconstituted by co-expressing α, β, and γ channel subunits together (0.5 μg/35 mm2 each cDNA). Fig. 1A shows a continuous recording of macroscopic Na+ currents evoked by a train of voltage ramps in a typical voltage clamp experiment performed on a CHO cell expressing ENaC before and after the addition of amiloride (10 μm) and the subsequent washout of this channel inhibitor. Fig. 1B shows typical currents from voltage clamp experiments performed on CHO cells containing ENaC alone and with co-expression of the various RhoA GTPases. Currents were elicited by applying test pulses (20-mV increments) from –120 to 100 mV in the absence (Fig. 1B, left) and presence (right) of 10 μm amiloride in the bathing solution. Overexpression of ENaC resulted in substantial amiloride-sensitive (IC50 at –80 mV ∼ 200 nm), inward Na+ currents that were not present in untransfected cells (not shown, see Refs. 7Tong Q. Gamper N.

Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41367-41379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Co-expression of wild type and constitutively active but not dominant negative RhoA markedly increased ENaC activity. The average amiloride-sensitive current density at –80 mV, as shown in Fig. 1C, in control experiments (hENaC alone) was 173.9 ± 17.4 pA/pF (n = 14). Co-overexpression of wild type RhoA and constitutively active RhoAG14V with hENaC significantly increased current density to 437.2 ± 82.0 pA/pF (n = 11) and 671.0 ± 65.2 pA/pF (n = 8), respectively. These results are consistent with RhoA in the GTP-bound state enhancing ENaC activity. In contrast, coexpression of dominant negative RhoAT19N, which prevents activation of endogenous RhoA and its effectors by forming unproductive complexes with Rho GTP exchange factors and effector proteins (24Feig L.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E25-E27Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), resulted in a statistically significant decrease in hENaC activity compared with control. Current density in this latter case was reduced 5.4 times to 32.5 ± 5.8 pA/pF (n = 12) indicating that dominant negative RhoA inhibits the actions of endogenous RhoA on hENaC.We next tested whether the positive effects of RhoA on ENaC were specific or a general feature of Rho GTPases by co-expressing ENaC plus Rac1. Co-expression of Rac1 with ENaC similar to RhoA resulted in increased ENaC activity (549.9 ± 85.7 pA/pF, n = 8). Overexpression of RhoA and its dominant negative and constitutively active forms as well as Rac1 had no effect on cell capacitance (not shown). These results showing RhoA and Rac1 augmentation of ENaC activity suggest that this may be a common feature shared by several members of the Rho family.We confirmed the effects of RhoA on ENaC using the C3 exoenzyme, which selectively ADP-ribosylates and thus inactivates Rho proteins. Ras, as well as other small G proteins outside the Rho family, are not targets for the C3 exoenzyme (25Aktories K. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 282-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Because the C3 exoenzyme is a protein that does not penetrate the cell plasma membrane, we added this protein directly to the intracellular patch pipette solution. Fig. 2 shows the inhibitory effect of 5 μg/ml C3 exoenzyme in cells co-expressing hENaC and wild type RhoA. Current density decreased from 454.0 ± 101.7 to 101.8 ± 25.8 pA/pF. In contrast, the C3 exoenzyme had little effect on ENaC activity in the absence of co-expression of RhoA.Fig. 2C3 exoenzyme attenuates activation of ENaC by RhoA. Summary graph of the amiloride-sensitive current density at –80 mV for hENaC alone and with co-expression of RhoA in the absence and presence of C3 exoenzyme (5 μg/ml) included in the intracellular pipette solution.

For these experiments, 2.0 mm GDPβS (a non-hydrolysable analogue of GDP) replaced the GTP in typical intracellular pipette solutions. Fig. 3A shows the effect of GDPβS in a representative cell overexpressing ENaC and RhoA. As GDPβS dialyzed the cytosol, ENaC activity decreased indicating that GTP is necessary for RhoA to enhance channel activity. Fig. 3B shows a summary graph of experiments testing the role of GTP in RhoA-dependent activation of ENaC.Fig. 3RhoA activates ENaC in a GTP-dependent manner.A, overlay of typical macroscopic current traces from a representative CHO cell co-expressing hENaC plus RhoA at the beginning of the experiment (start) and 1 and 2 min after dialyzing the cytosol with 2 mm GDPβS.

Our rationale was that RhoA most likely communicates with ENaC through a signaling cascade and Ras GTPases activate ENaC via the PI3K cascade, which is also known to be activated by Rho GTPases and to activate Rho GTPases. Fig. 4A shows overlays of hENaC currents from typical whole cell voltage clamp experiments elicited by standard voltage ramps before and after amiloride. Currents are from representative cells expressing hENaC plus RhoA in the absence (Fig. 4A, top) and presence (bottom) of pretreatment with Y27632 (1 μm, 1 h), which is an inhibitor of Rho kinase (26Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2518) Google Scholar, 27Ishizaki T. Uehata M. Tamechika I. Keel J. Nonomura K. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 976-983PubMed Google Scholar). As summarized in Fig. 4B, pretreating cells overexpressing hENaC and RhoA with Y27632 significantly decreased RhoA-dependent ENaC activity from 484.6 ± 66.9 to 128.0 ± 33.7 pA/pF. In contrast, neither the MAPK inhibitor PD98059 (10 μm, 5 h) nor the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin (200 nm, 5 h) and LY294002 (50 μm, 5 h) influenced RhoA actions on ENaC. We conclude from these results that Rho kinase (but not PI3K and MAPK) is necessary for RhoA-dependent activation of ENaC suggesting that this RhoA effector is positioned between the small G protein and the channel.Fig. 4RhoA increases ENaC activity via Rho kinase.A, overlays of representative macroscopic currents elicited by voltage ramps before and after amiloride (amil) under voltage clamp conditions from CHO cells transfected with hENaC plus RhoA in the absence and presence of pretreatment with the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 (1 μm, 1 h).

Thus we wondered whether activation of PI(4)P 5-K in response to RhoA-Rho kinase signaling played a role in enhancing ENaC activity. To test this possibility, we first asked whether overexpression of PI(4)P 5-K influenced ENaC in a manner similar to RhoA. Fig. 5A shows typical current traces before and after amiloride from representative cells expressing hENaC alone and with PI(4)P 5-K. All conditions are the same as Fig. 1 with currents elicited by voltage ramps. As summarized in Fig. 5B, co-expression of PI(4)P 5-K with ENaC significantly enhanced channel activity from 158.0 ± 32.9 to 588.7 ± 83.5 pA/pF. These results demonstrate that similar to RhoA, overexpression of its downstream effector PI(4)P 5-K augments ENaC activity suggesting that this effector is positioned between the small G protein and the channel and that the phospholipid products of this kinase transduce the stimulatory signal to ENaC.Fig. 5PI(4)P 5-K increases ENaC activity.A, overlays of representative macroscopic currents elicited by voltage ramps before and after amiloride (amil) under voltage clamp conditions from CHO cells transfected with hENaC alone and with PI(4,5)P 5-K.

Fig. 6 summarizes ENaC activity in the absence and presence of co-expressed RhoA in cells not pretreated and those pretreated with 50 μm wortmannin for 30 min to inhibit PI4K. At this dose and treatment time, wortmannin inhibits both PI3K and PI4K; however, our results shown in Fig. 4 excluded PI3K from playing a role in RhoA-mediated effects on ENaC, and thus wortmannin was used to test the role of PI4K and dependent synthesis of PI(4,5)P2 on RhoA-dependent activation of ENaC. Channel activity when ENaC was expressed alone decreased 3.2-fold from 123.3 ± 22.7 to 38.5 ± 7.3 pA/pF with wortmannin pretreatment. When expressed with RhoA, channel activity decreased 5.5-fold from 482.0 ± 44.8 to 88.1 ± 34.0 pA/pF with wortmannin pretreatment. These results clearly show that PI(4,5)P2 synthesis is necessary for RhoA-dependent activation of the channel with this phospholipid either being permissive for RhoA effects or downstream of the small GTPase in its signal transduction cascade to the channel. We believe the latter is more likely considering the results shown in Fig. 5 and the publications of others documenting RhoA- and Rho kinase-dependent activation of PI(4)P 5-K and associated increases in PI(4,5)P2 synthesis (11Oude Weernink P.A.

Because our results implicated PI(4,5)P2 as being downstream of RhoA signaling to ENaC, we tested whether RhoA and dominant negative as well as constitutively active mutants of this GTPase influenced ENaC levels in the plasma membrane. Fig. 7A shows a representative Western blot probed with anti-Myc antibody containing whole cell lysate from cells not transfected (negative control) and those overexpressing Myc-tagged ENaC alone and with co-expression of wild type, dominant negative (T19N), and constitutively active (G14V) RhoA. The membrane fractions (from 100 μg of total protein) and total cellular pools (from 50 μg of total protein) of ENaC are shown for each group. The membrane fraction was isolated by streptavidin precipitation of total cell lysates created from cells that had their plasma membrane proteins labeled with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin.

https://openalex.org/W1995158674,"Intramembrane cleaving proteases such as site 2 protease, gamma-secretase, and signal peptide peptidase hydrolyze peptide bonds within the transmembrane domain (TMD) of signaling molecules such as SREBP, Notch, and HLA-E, respectively. All three enzymes require a prior cleavage at the juxtamembrane region by another protease. It has been proposed that removing the extracellular domain allows dissociation of substrate TMD, held together by the extracellular domain or loop. Using gamma-secretase as a model intramembrane cleaving protease and Notch as a model substrate, we investigated whether activating and inactivating mutations in Notch modulate gamma-secretase cleavage through changes in oligomerization. We find that although the Notch epidermal growth factor repeats can promote dimer formation, most surface Notch molecules in mammalian cells are monomeric as are constitutively active or inactive Notch1 proteins. Using a bacterial assay for TM dimerization, we find that the isolated TMD of Notch and amyloid precursor protein self-associate and that mutations affecting Notch cleavage by gamma-secretase cleavage do not alter TMD dimerization. Our results indicate that ligand-induced reversal of controlled TMD dimerization by the Notch extracellular domain is unlikely to underlie the regulatory mechanism of intramembranous cleavage."

The myogenic bHLH factors form heterodimers with the ubiquitously expressed bHLH E-proteins and bind E-box (CANNTG) sites present in the promoters of several muscle-specific genes. Our previous studies have shown that the bHLH factor Sharp-1 is expressed in skeletal muscle and interacts with MyoD and E-proteins. However, its role in regulation of myogenic differentiation remains unknown. We report here that endogenous Sharp-1 is expressed in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts and is down-regulated during myogenic differentiation. Constitutive expression of Sharp-1 in C2C12 myoblasts promotes cell cycle exit causing a decrease in cyclin D1 expression but blocks terminal differentiation. Although MyoD expression is not inhibited, the induction of differentiation-specific genes such as myogenin, MEF2C, and myosin heavy chain is impaired by Sharp-1 overexpression. We demonstrate that the interaction of Sharp-1 with MyoD and E-proteins results in reduced DNA binding and transactivation from MyoD-dependent E-box sites.

The bHLH family has recently been classified into six phylogenetic groups A–F, which is based on sequence comparisons, DNA binding sites, as well as presence of conserved residues and specific domains (4Ledent V. Paquet O. Vervoort M. Genome Biology. 2002; (http://genomebiology.com/2002/3/6/research/0030)PubMed Google Scholar, 5Atchley W.R. Fitch W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5172-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The class A group includes factors such as MyoD and E-proteins, which bind to the E-box sequences CACCTG/CAGCTG. Class B includes the ubiquitously expressed Myc family, which also binds the E-box sequences CACGTG/CATGTG. The class C subfamily includes the bHLH-PAS proteins Sim1, HIF, and Clock that have an additional PAS domain and bind the sequence ACGTG/GCGTG. Class D is represented by Id proteins that lack a basic domain and therefore do not bind DNA and function as antagonists of class A proteins. Class E includes the Hairy and Enhancer of Split [E(Spl)] subfamily, which preferentially binds the N-box sequence CACGCG and is characterized by an orange domain as well as a tetrapeptide motif WRPW. Class F corresponds to the Coe family, which has an additional COE domain involved in dimerization and DNA binding. Skeletal muscle differentiation is regulated mainly by two families of transcription factors: the bHLH myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), which include MyoD, Myogenin, Myf5, and MRF4, and myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) factors, which belong to the MADS box family. All MRFs contain a conserved basic domain for DNA binding, and the HLH domain, which is required for heterodimerization with the ubiquitously expressed bHLH E-proteins E12, E47, or HEB (6Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Clin. Genet. 2000; 57: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Heterodimers of MRFs and E-proteins bind to E-box sequences (CANNTG) present in the promoters of muscle-specific genes (7French B.A. Chow K.L. Olson E.N. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell.

In addition to forming an auto- and cross-regulatory transcriptional loop, MRFs and MEF2 transcription factors physically interact and synergistically activate skeletal muscle specific promoters (9Black B.L.

Differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts is a multistep process that requires a coordinated sequence of molecular events, involving an initial withdrawal of cells from the cell cycle, followed by expression of terminal differentiation genes and subsequent fusion of cells into multinuclear myotubes. Consequently, regulators of cell cycle progression as well as terminal differentiation have been found to modulate myogenic differentiation. For instance, protooncogenes such as Ras, c-Jun, Fos, and cyclin D1 prevent cell cycle exit and inhibit differentiation of muscle cells (18Rao S.S. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5259-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 19Olson E.N. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Lassar A.B. Thayer M.J. Overell R.W.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Several regulators of differentiation genes have also been shown to inhibit myogenesis, which include Notch (22Kopan R.

Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), yet activation of muscle differentiation does not occur until cells are depleted of growth factors, which allows for a permanent exit from the cell cycle. The myogenic activity of MyoD in proliferating myoblasts is restrained through a variety of regulators. Although the precise mechanisms by which MyoD activity is inhibited is unclear, negative regulators of MyoD activity such as Id, Twist, Mist, MyoR, and Hes1 have been reported, which regulate MyoD activity through active or passive mechanisms. For instance, Id lacks a DNA binding domain and functions primarily by sequestration of E-proteins (28Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar), whereas Twist inhibits both MyoD and MEF2 activities (29Spicer D.B. Rhee J. Cheung W.L. Lassar A.B. Science. 1996; 272: 1476-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have indicated that MyoR interacts with E-proteins and binds to E-box sites to repress myogenesis (30Lu J. Webb R. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Mist1 homodimers bind E-box sites but also inactivate MyoD by forming inactive MyoD-Mist heterodimers (31Lemercier C. To R.Q. Carrasco R.A. Konieczny S.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1412-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In addition to these bHLH regulators, MyoD is associated with HDAC1 in proliferating myoblasts, and this interaction is important for inhibition of MyoD transcriptional activity (32Mal A. Sturniolo M. Schiltz R.L. Ghosh M.K. Harter M.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1739-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar).

Sharp-1 and Stra13 share the highest sequence homology with each other relative to the remaining family members (34Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P.

Both proteins can function as transcriptional repressors but lack a WRPW motif in the C terminus, which characterizes the remaining family members. Moreover, both Sharp-1 and Stra13 have been found to bind to the E box motif (CANNTG) (33Azmi S. Sun H. Ozog A. Taneja R. J. Biol.

We have shown recently that Sharp-1 is expressed in skeletal muscle (33Azmi S. Sun H. Ozog A. Taneja R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20098-20109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and can interact with both MyoD and E-proteins suggesting that it may regulate myogenesis. In this study, we have examined the role of Sharp-1 in regulation of myoblast differentiation. We demonstrate that endogenous Sharp-1 expression is down-regulated during muscle differentiation and that its constitutive overexpression in C2C12 myoblasts results in inhibition of terminal differentiation. Interestingly, Sharp-1-overexpressing cells exhibit an early exit from the cell cycle relative to control C2C12 cells, indicating that inhibition of muscle differentiation by Sharp-1 occurs independent of effects on cell cycle progression. Sharp-1 inhibits myogenic bHLH transcription factor activity by interaction with myogenic bHLH proteins. Thus, Sharp-1-overexpressing cells have reduced MyoD activity resulting in impaired expression of differentiation specific genes such as p21, myogenin, MEF2C, and MHC. The differentiation defect imposed by Sharp-1 overexpression can be partially rescued by forced re-expression of MyoD∼E47 tethered dimers indicating that the myogenic bHLH factors function downstream of Sharp-1. Our results provide evidence that Sharp-1 regulates myogenesis by inhibiting myogenic bHLH factor activity. Cell Culture and Generation of Stable Cell Lines Overexpressing Sharp-1—C2C12 cells were maintained in growth medium (GM) consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20% fetal bovine serum. For differentiation experiments, C2C12 cells were grown to confluence and then transferred to differentiation medium (DM), consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 2% horse serum. Differentiation media was replaced every 48 h. To obtain stable transfectants overexpressing Sharp-1, C2C12 cells were co-transfected with a 1:10 ratio of an expression vector for Sharp-1 (pCS2-Sharp-1) and the neomycin resistance plasmid pKJ-1. 48 h after transfection, cells were selected in medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). After 14–21 days, G418-resistant clones were isolated, expanded, and screened by RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. The expression levels of Sharp-1 in individual clones was determined by RT-PCR using primers RT18 (5′-TTTCCCTTGCTTGTCGTCCG-3′) and RT8 (5′-AGAGTAAGAGATGCTCTGCT-3′), which amplify a 573-bp fragment, and Western blot analysis using anti-Sharp-1 antibodies (kindly provided by Dr. B. Yan, University of Rhode Island). Two independent clones (2b and 2d) were used for all studies and showed an identical phenotype. C3H10T1/2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Equal amounts of extracted proteins (80 μg) were loaded, separated by 9% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred at 100 V for 1 h onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 2 h in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) containing 5% skimmed milk and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution. The following primary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:500: MyoD, Myogenin, p21, Cyclin D1, E2A.E12 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and EF-1α (Upstate Biotechnology). After incubation with primary antibody, membranes were washed in TBST (TBS with 0.1% Tween 20) containing 1% milk and then incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to HRP (Sigma) for 1 h. After three washes with the above solution and one wash with TBST, proteins were detected using ECL reagents. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from C2C12 and C2C12-Sharp-1 cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen). The amounts of RNA were normalized to the ubiquitous 36B4 transcripts as described previously (33Azmi S. Sun H. Ozog A. Taneja R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20098-20109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To detect endogenous Sharp-1 upon differentiation of C2C12 cells, primers RT8 and RT9 (33Azmi S. Sun H. Ozog A. Taneja R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20098-20109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were used, which amplified a 280-bp fragment. RT-PCR products were detected by Southern blot analysis with 32P-labeled Sharp-1 and 36B4 cDNA probes. The primers used for amplification of MEF2C (RT208 and RT209) are as follows: 5′-GTATGTCTCCTGGTGTAACA-3′ and 5′-GGATATCCTCCCATTCCTTG-3′. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was performed as described (33Azmi S. Sun H. Ozog A. Taneja R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20098-20109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, to detect myosin heavy chain (MHC) expression, C2C12 cells cultured in DM for 3 days were fixed in methanol for 20 min at 4 °C. Following a 30-min blocking step (5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline), plates were incubated with 1:400 dilution of MY-32, a monoclonal anti-skeletal myosin antibody (Sigma) specific for the myosin heavy chain, overnight at 4 °C. The primary complexes were detected using a biotinylated anti-mouse antibody (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA), and a horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin conjugate (Vector Laboratories). Specific immunocomplexes were visualized by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Fluka), resulting in brown immunoreactive sites. Bromodeoxyuridine Staining—Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was added to the media of growing cells at a concentration of 10 μm for 2–3 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with methanol for 20 min, and the endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% H2O2 for 10 min at 37 °C. After a phosphate-buffered saline wash, cells were incubated with 2 n HCl solution for 30 min. This was again followed by a phosphate-buffered saline wash, and subsequently the cells were incubated with 1:500 monoclonal anti BrdUrd antibody at 4 °C overnight. The remaining procedure was similar to immunostaining of cells as described above. Rescue/Differentiation Assay—C2C12-Sharp-1 cells were transfected with expression vectors for MyoD, MyoD∼E47 tethered construct, or an empty vector. Parental C2C12 cells were also transfected with empty vector as control. After 24 h, cells were switched to DM, and the culture was continued in the medium for 3 days. Differentiation was quantified by counting the number of multinucleated myotubes in at least four different fields. Cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer for Western blot analysis or fixed with ice cold methanol for immunostaining. Luciferase Assays—5 × 104 cells were plated 1 day before transfection in 24-well plates and transiently transfected with plasmids as indicated using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Empty expression vectors were added to normalize the amount of DNA in each well. Cells were harvested with passive lysis buffer, and luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Transfection efficiencies were normalized by co-transfecting 50 ng of the β-galactosidase plasmid pCH110 (Amersham Biosciences). All transfections were performed in duplicate at least three times. Gel Shift Assays—Sharp-1, E47, MyoD, and MyoD∼E47 tethered proteins were translated in vitro using the TnT-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega), and the efficiency of translation was monitored by Western blot analysis. Gel shift assays were performed using end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the E box site from the MCK enhancer (5′-GATCCAACACCTGCTGCCTGAG-3′), and one containing multimerized class A E-box sites (5′-GGCCGCAGCAGCTGGCACAGCAGCTGGCACAGCAGCTGGCAGC-3′). Binding reactions contained 40,000 cpm probe, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 80 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and varying amounts of in vitro translated proteins. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 20 min and fractionated on 5% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—To examine interaction with MyoD, E47, and MyoD∼E47, epitope-tagged myc-Sharp-1 was used. C3H10T1/2 cells were transfected with 4 μg of each expression vector individually or together as indicated in the figures. Cells were harvested 48 h post transfection and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol). The lysates were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μl of c-myc mouse monoclonal antibody (9E10). A 50% slurry (25 μl) of protein A-agarose beads was subsequently added to each sample, and the sample was incubated for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. After being rinsed with lysis buffer, the final bead pellet was resuspended in SDS loading buffer and subjected to protein gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot analysis was carried out as described above using MyoD or E47 antibody. Sharp-1 Expression Is Down-regulated during Muscle Differentiation—Our previous studies have indicated that Sharp-1 interacts with MyoD and E-proteins and inhibits MyoD-induced muscle differentiation in C3H10T1/2 fibroblast cells (33Azmi S. Sun H. Ozog A. Taneja R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20098-20109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To examine whether Sharp-1 expression is regulated during myogenesis, we examined the endogenous expression of Sharp-1 in the myoblast cell line C2C12. C2C12 cells cultured in growth medium (0 h) or in differentiation medium for up to 72 h were harvested and analyzed for Sharp-1 expression by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Sharp-1 mRNA (Fig. 1A) as well as protein (Fig. 1B) was expressed in proliferating myoblasts cells cultured in growth medium. However, when these cells were induced to differentiate by transfer to differentiation medium, Sharp-1 transcripts as well as protein were gradually down-regulated after 48 and 72 h. The down-regulation of Sharp-1 expression during C2C12 differentiation suggested that it may play a role in myogenesis. Constitutive Overexpression of Sharp-1 Inhibits C2C12 Myoblast Differentiation—To investigate the potential role of Sharp-1 in myogenic differentiation, we stably transfected C2C12 cells with an expression vector for Sharp-1. Cells were drug-selected, and several independent colonies were picked and analyzed for the ability to differentiate into myotubes. When placed in differentiation medium containing low serum, control C2C12 cells ceased to proliferate and within 3 days fused to form multinucleated fibers (Fig. 2A). In contrast, several Sharp-1-transfected clones (C2C12-Sharp-1) that were similarly analyzed (Fig. 2A), showed an almost complete block of myotube formation suggesting that overexpression of Sharp-1 inhibits morphological differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. We examined the level of Sharp-1 overexpression in clone #2b by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2B) and by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2C). The exogenously transfected Sharp-1 was expressed at ∼4-fold higher levels than the endogenous gene. To determine the mechanism by which Sharp-1 blocks myogenic differentiation, control C2C12 cells and C2C12-Sharp-1 cells were induced to differentiate in DM and analyzed for muscle differentiation markers by immunostaining and by Western blot analysis. Consistent with a defect in morphological differentiation, the expression of the terminal differentiation marker myosin heavy chain (MHC) was significantly lower in C2C12-Sharp-1#2b cells as assessed by immunostaining (Fig. 3A). Moreover, although MyoD expression was not reduced (Fig. 3B), the expression of myogenin and MEF2C, which are induced upon differentiation, was impaired in C2C12-Sharp-1 cells compared with control cells (Fig. 3, B and C). Similar results were obtained with another independent clone ((#2d), Fig. 2, and data not shown) indicating that the differentiation defective phenotype is not a clonal artifact. These results indicate that Sharp-1 inhibits myogenic differentiation at a step downstream of MyoD expression. Sharp-1 Does Not Delay Cell Cycle Exit of Myoblasts—The inability of the C2C12-Sharp-1 cells to differentiate could be due to defects in cell cycle progression or due to defects in terminal differentiation. To examine cell proliferation under growth and differentiation conditions, we performed BrdUrd incorporation assays. C2C12 cells and C2C12-Sharp-1 cells cultured in GM or in DM for 24 and 48 h were pulsed with BrdUrd for 2 h followed by immunostaining with anti-BrdUrd antibodies. The percentage of S-phase cells was calculated by counting the number of BrdUrd+ nuclei in four different fields relative to the total number of nuclei in each field. C2C12 cells cultured in growth medium had 75% cells in S-phase, whereas only 40% of C2C12-Sharp-1 cells were labeled with BrdUrd (Fig. 4A). Following transfer of cells to DM, as expected, the number of BrdUrd-positive cells was reduced in control C2C12 cells after 24 h (50%) and 48 h (30%). However, the number of S-phase cells was even more strikingly reduced in C2C12-Sharp-1 clones cultured in DM after 24 and 48 h (25 and 8%, respectively). To further substantiate these findings, we examined the expression of cyclinD1 by Western blotting. Previous studies have shown that cyclin D1 levels decline during differentiation of myoblasts (41Heller H. Gredinger E. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37307-37316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As expected, cyclin D1 levels were high in C2C12 cells cultured in GM (time 0) and declined when cells were shifted to DM. Consistent with the BrdUrd experiments, basal cyclin D1 levels were lower in C2C12-Sharp-1 cells cultured in GM (time 0) and declined to almost undetectable levels within 24 h of induction of differentiation (Fig. 4B). These experiments suggest that overexpression of Sharp-1 facilitates withdrawal of cells from the cell cycle, and thus the inhibition of differentiation in C2C12-Sharp-1 clones is unlikely to be due to a delay in the cell cycle exit of myoblasts. Interestingly, the expression of p21Cip1, another marker of cell cycle arrest, was induced in control C2C12 cells upon induction of differentiation but was not up-regulated in C2C12-Sharp-1 cells (Fig. 4B). p21Cip1 expression has previously been reported to be transcriptionally regulated by MyoD (42Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1018-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar, 43Otten A.D. Firpo E.J. Gerber A.N. Brody L.L. Roberts J.M. Tapscott S.J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 1151-1160PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the decreased p21Cip1 expression suggested that MyoD activity may be reduced in C2C12-Sharp-1 cells. Transcriptional Activity of MyoD Is Modulated by Sharp-1— Because MyoD expression is not down-regulated in C2C12-Sharp-1 clones, but myogenic differentiation is, we examined the possibility that MyoD activity is regulated by Sharp-1. To examine MyoD activity, we transfected the MyoD-dependent reporter 4Rtk-luc (44Weintraub H. Davis R. Lockshon D. Lassar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5623-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), which contains four tandem"

Each contains an initiator RNA primer that is removed prior to joining of the strands. Primer removal in eukaryotes requires displacement of the primer into a flap that is cleaved off by flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1). FEN1 employs a unique tracking mechanism that requires the recognition of the free 5′ terminus and then movement to the base of the flap for cleavage. Abnormally long flaps are coated by replication protein A (RPA), inhibiting FEN1 cleavage. A second nuclease, Dna2p, is needed to cleave an RPA-coated flap producing a short RPA-free flap, favored by FEN1. Here we show that Dna2p is also a tracking protein. Annealed primers or conjugated biotin-streptavidin complex block Dna2p entry and movement. Single-stranded binding protein-coated flaps inhibit Dna2p cleavage. Like FEN1, Dna2p can track over substrates with a non-Watson Crick base, such as a biotin, or a missing base within a chain. Unlike FEN1, Dna2p shows evidence of a “threading-like” mechanism that does not support tracking over a branched substrate. We propose that the two nucleases both track, Dna2p first and then FEN1, to remove initiator RNA via long flap intermediates.

During cellular DNA replication, the lagging strand is primed frequently to generate many RNA-initiated DNA segments called Okazaki fragments.

FEN1 is a structure-specific endonuclease that recognizes one intermediate of strand displacement. This is a double flap with a 1-nucleotide 3′-tail (11Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R.

Biochemical analyses showed that FEN1 employs a unique tracking mechanism in which it recognizes the free 5′-end of the flap and then moves to the base of the flap for cleavage (14Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of FEN1 and its homologues reveal a conserved flexible region, called the helical arch or loop domain, through which the flap was proposed to be threaded during tracking (15Ceska T.A. Sayers J.R. Stier G. Suck D. Nature. 1996; 382: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 16Hwang K.Y. Baek K. Kim H.Y. Cho Y. Nat. Struct.

Nature. 1995; 376: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The term “threading” is taken to mean that the flap passes through a fully enclosed hole in the protein. However, studies of substrate specificity indicated that the enzyme is able to cleave on a branched substrate that could not fit through the proposed hole (19Bornarth C.J. Ranalli T.A. Henricksen L.A. Wahl A.F. Bambara R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13347-13354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This indicates that FEN1 tracking does not employ a threading mechanism. The obligatory nature of tracking suggests that it is important for the protection of replication intermediates. Studies of enzyme properties and reconstituted assays indicate that FEN1 prefers short flap substrates and that coordinated strand displacement and cleavage result in frequent cuts (6Ayyagari R.

These results suggest that within the cell, flaps are removed when they are only a few nucleotides long. However, in some regions, stable structures can form within the flap as soon as the flaps arise, inhibiting the accessibility of the substrates to FEN1. These structures will inhibit FEN1 cleavage and allow the flap to get longer than normal (10Kao H.I. Veeraraghavan J. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

In this situation, flaps may get long enough for RPA coating, which inhibits FEN1 tracking for cleavage. These flaps are proposed to require another protein for efficient metabolism, the Dna2 helicase/nuclease (10Kao H.I. Veeraraghavan J. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

Genetic analyses indicated that FEN1 and Dna2p interact with each other both physically and genetically, suggesting the two enzymes work at a similar step of DNA replication (9Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition, Dna2p interacts with RPA biochemically and genetically, suggesting a model in which Dna2p and RPA process long flaps to produce short flaps that support cleavage by FEN1 (6Ayyagari R.

Nuclease activity of Dna2p is maximal under conditions in which Mg2+ is high and ATP is low or absent, and the helicase activity is best observed when nuclease activity is lowered by the presence of high ATP and lower Mg2+. One or the other of the two functional activities can be observed preferentially by changing the balance of ATP and Mg2+ (10Kao H.I. Veeraraghavan J. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

Kim D.W. Kim J. Kim J.H. Kim D.H. Kim H.D. Kang H.Y. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26632-26641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It was suggested that 3′-nuclease is not relevant for Dna2p because ATP and RPA inhibit this activity (10Kao H.I. Veeraraghavan J. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15014-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Bae S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol.

Although Dna2p could also bind from the internal single-stranded region prior to displacing the primer segment, this activity is weak and distributive (25Bae S.H. Kim D.W. Kim J. Kim J.H. Kim D.H. Kim H.D. Kang H.Y. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26632-26641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Generally helicases do not exhibit an end preference for substrate binding because a substrate flanked by difference lengths of primers at either end of a template could be utilized to determine the polarity of virtually all the helicases (27LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By this criterion, Dna2p is a unique helicase/nuclease (25Bae S.H. Kim D.W. Kim J. Kim J.H. Kim D.H. Kim H.D. Kang H.Y. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26632-26641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Despite several reports on Dna2p substrate specificity, the mechanism behind the free end preference remains unanswered. We wanted to know the events that occur when Dna2p encounters a flap substrate. We speculated that Dna2p employs a FEN1-like tracking mechanism, because both enzymes share a similar pathway in replication. To test this hypothesis, we utilized substrates capable of defining specific characteristics of the tracking process. Our observations in vitro reveal that Dna2p does indeed track on flap substrates. They suggest that this unique mechanism is used to protect against internal cleavage of replication intermediates during Okazaki fragment processing. Materials—Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Radionucleotides [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The T4 polynucleotide kinase (labeling grade), the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and ATP were from Roche Applied Science. Nuclease-free solutions and reagents were from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). All other reagents were the best available commercial grade. Enzyme Expression and Purification—Saccharomyces cerevisiae Dna2p was cloned into the Sf9 baculovirus expression vector (Invitrogen). The amplification/expression and purification conditions were the same as described previously (23Budd M.E. Choe W. Campbell J.L. J. Biol.

S. cerevisiae FEN1 was expressed in Escherichia coli, and it was subsequently purified under the same conditions described elsewhere (13Kao H.I. Henricksen L.A. Liu Y. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

Blocking primers were present in 10-fold excess over the annealed flap substrates. All radiolabeled primers were purified by gel isolation from 12 or 15% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gels. The 10-nucleotide markers were obtained by 5′-labeling the 10-bp markers from Invitrogen using [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and they were heat-denatured prior to loading of the gel.Table IOligonucleotide sequences (5′-3′)Downstream primersaThe boldface nucleotides represent the location of modification.

Open table in a new tab Enzyme Assays—Reactions were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 30 mm NaCl, and various ratios of MgCl2 and ATP. Enzyme stocks were diluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.02% Nonidet P-40. The “maximum-nuclease” assays include excess MgCl2 over ATP (2 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm ATP), whereas the “maximum-helicase” assays contain excess ATP over MgCl2 (1 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm ATP). Most assays were performed under one of these conditions. Each reaction contains 5-fmol substrates in a 20-μl reaction volume with different amounts of the enzymes as indicated in the figure legends. All the assays were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min (maximum-helicase conditions with substrates, enzyme, and ATP or maximum-nuclease conditions with substrates and enzymes). The reactions were initiated at 37 °C for 10 min with the addition of MgCl2 (for maximum-nuclease conditions, ATP was added with MgCl2 at the end of the preincubation time). Reactions were then stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 2× termination dye (95% formamide (v/v) with bromphenol blue and xylene cyanole). The denatured reactions were resolved on 12 or 15% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gels. Each gel was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed using Image-Quant version 1.2 software from Amersham Biosciences. In all studies, the quantitated amount of substrates and products were utilized to calculate the percentage of product formation from the product/(substrate plus product) ratio. The % product formation is indicated below each gel in the figures. This method allows for the correction of any loading errors among lanes. All assays were performed at least in triplicate, and representative assays are shown. To dissect out the multiple activities of Dna2p, we employed previously developed reaction conditions. One favors maximum-nuclease (MgCl2 > ATP) in which high MgCl2 supports nuclease activity, masking the helicase activity by cutting the flap substrate. The other favors maximum-helicase (ATP > MgCl2 and with a 5-min preincubation of the enzyme and substrate) in which excess ATP sequesters free MgCl2 reducing the nuclease activity and allowing helicase to interact with the substrates (10Kao H.I. Veeraraghavan J. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15014-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). By controlling these conditions, we can examine the cleavage properties of Dna2p nuclease and the influence of the helicase activity on Dna2p nuclease on different substrates. These conditions also allow us to monitor the tracking mechanism in the presence and absence of helicase activity with the wild-type protein. Dna2p Makes Multiple Cuts on a Long Flap—It was shown previously that Dna2p possesses a weak, distributive helicase activity. This is able to influence the positions of cleavage under maximum-helicase conditions, with a flap that is 27 nucleotides or longer (10Kao H.I. Veeraraghavan J. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15014-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Bae S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We first examined the patterns of nuclease cleavage under nuclease versus helicase conditions. Specifically we wanted to know whether Dna2p cleaves a long flap in a progressive fashion by making a series of cuts that shorten the flap in a stepwise manner. To accomplish this, we employed 38-nucleotide flap substrates labeled at either the 3′-or5′-end of the downstream primer (Fig. 1). Fig. 1, lanes 1–7 and 8–14, shows cleavages of the 5′-radiolabeled and 3′-radiolabeled substrates, respectively, compared under both conditions. 5′-Radiolabeled substrates show that longer cleavage products are released under maximum-helicase conditions (Fig. 1, compare lanes 2–4 to 5–7), similar to what was observed previously (10Kao H.I. Veeraraghavan J. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15014-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Bae S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38022-38031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This indicates that Dna2p progresses further toward the flap junction before allowing the first cleavage or that inhibiting the nuclease allows further translocation before cleavage. This is also consistent with the earlier report that the nuclease product is longer in the presence of ATP (30Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, most initial cleavages are not close to the base of the flap (38 nucleotides from the 5′-labeled end) under either condition. The downstream duplex was not unwound at all, consistent with other observations that the helicase activity is weak (10Kao H.I. Veeraraghavan J. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15014-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 26Bae S.H. Choi E. Lee K.H. Park J.S. Lee S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Examination of the 3′-substrates (Fig. 1, lanes 8–14) shows that majority of the products represent cleavages near the base of the flap. Because the products from the 3′-substrates reflect the sum of all cleavage events occurring on one substrate, the fact that these are distributed closer to the flap base under both conditions implies that each substrate sustained multiple progressive cuts by the nuclease. These results show progression but do not define whether the cleavage process is processive, i.e. carried out by the same protein. Several Dna2p proteins may collaborate to reduce the flap length. Dna2p Cleavage Requires a Free 5′ Terminus—Dna2p was found to prefer free 5′-ends (10Kao H.I. Veeraraghavan J. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15014-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Bae S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol.

Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38022-38031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We asked whether the end preference was influenced by the helicase function because the helicase had been reported to allow Dna2p to load internally, and Dna2p was shown to cleave some substrates in which end loading was not possible (23Budd M.E. Choe W. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16518-16529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 25Bae S.H. Kim D.W. Kim J. Kim J.H. Kim D.H. Kim H.D. Kang H.Y.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We tested substrates that contain a downstream primer with a 25-nucleotide flap (Fig. 2A). On one substrate a 17-nucleotide primer was annealed at the 5′-end of the flap (Fig. 2A, lanes 8–14). Under both maximal-nuclease and maximal-helicase conditions, Dna2p was able to cleave the 25-nucleotide flap (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–7). However, the presence of the 17-nucleotide terminal duplex prevented cleavage within the 8-nucletoide gap (Fig. 2A, lanes 8–14). The helicase activity moves the Dna2p on these substrates because we see cleavage closer to the flap base under helicase conditions (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 2–4 to 5–7). However, the presence of ATP in excess over MgCl2 and helicase function does not allow the bypass of the 5′-end requirement for Dna2p loading onto a substrate. A larger gap between the blocking primer and the flap base (53 nucleotides) also shows similar results as described below (Fig. 3A), ruling out the possibility that the eight nucleotides is too short for effective Dna2p binding. Apparently 5′-end loading is also a requirement for cleavage on these substrates even when the helicase is maximally active (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 5–7 to 12–14).Fig. 3Cleavage by Dna2p requires a tracking mechanism. A, Dna2p titration assay (0, 10, 50, and 100 fmol, as indicated by the triangles) under either maximum-nuclease or maximum-helicase conditions was employed. The assay conditions were the same as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lanes 1–7 contain 3′-radiolabeled 73-nucleotide double flap substrates (D3:T3:U1) and a poly(dT)16 primer, a non-complementary primer, as the no-blocking primer control. Lanes 8–14, 15–21, and 22–28 contain blocking primers B1, B2, and B3, respectively, that are annealed at distances leaving a gap of 53, 32, and 0 nucleotides from the first annealed nucleotide on the downstream duplex DNA. Lanes 1, 8, 15, and 22 are the substrate-only controls. Lanes 2–4, 9–11, 16–18, and 23–25 are under maximum-nuclease conditions, whereas lanes 5–7, 12–14, 19–21, and 26–28 are under maximum-helicase conditions. Schematic r"

It is an important drug target for the treatment of type II diabetes. DPP-IV is active as a dimer, and monomeric DPP-IV has been speculated to be inactive. In this study, we have identified the C-terminal loop of DPP-IV, highly conserved among prolyl dipeptidases, as essential for dimer formation and optimal catalysis. The conserved residue His750 on the loop contributes significantly for dimer stability. We have determined the quaternary structures of the wild type, H750A, and H750E mutant enzymes by several independent methods including chemical cross-linking, gel electrophoresis, size exclusion chromatography, and analytical ultracentrifugation. Wild-type DPP-IV exists as dimers both in the intact cell and in vitro after purification from human semen or insect cells. The H750A mutation results in a mixture of DPP-IV dimer and monomer. H750A dimer has the same kinetic constants as those of the wild type, whereas the H750A monomer has a 60-fold decrease in kcat. Replacement of His750 with a negatively charged Glu (H750E) results in nearly exclusive monomers with a 300-fold decrease in catalytic activity. Interestingly, there is no dynamic equilibrium between the dimer and the monomer for all forms of DPP-IVs studied here. This is the first study of the function of the C-terminal loop as well as monomeric mutant DPP-IVs with respect to their enzymatic activities.

Hence inhibition of DPP-IV may be effective in the treatment of type II diabetes. Understanding the catalytic mechanism of DPP-IV is thus essential to discovering inhibitors for the treatment of the disease.

The substrate specificity of DPP-IV is dictated by a proline-binding pocket and a Glu205-Glu206 motif at the active site (14Rasmussen H.B. Branner S. Wiberg F.C. Wagtmann N. Nat. Struct.

Only small size peptides are hydrolyzed by this class of enzymes because of the unique propeller structure and/or side opening substrates used to access the active site (14Rasmussen H.B. Branner S.

Among the shared properties, the most obvious difference between POP and DPP-IV is the relationship of catalytic activity with respect to its quaternary structure. POP exists in solution as a monomer and is active in such a form (15Fulop V. Bocskei Z. Polgar L. Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In contrast, DPP-IV is active only as a dimer or oligomer, and monomeric DPP-IV is speculated to be inactive, even though DPP-IV monomer has never been isolated and demonstrated to be inactive (14Rasmussen H.B. Branner S. Wiberg F.C. Wagtmann N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 19Lambeir A.M. Diaz Pereira J.F. Chacon P. Vermeulen G. Heremans K. Devreese B. Van Beeumen J. De Meester I. Scharpe S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1340: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structures of DPP-IV, two loops are located in the dimer interface and were proposed to be involved in dimer interaction, the C-terminal loop at the α/β hydrolase domain and the propeller loop extended from strand 2 of the fourth blade in the β-propeller domain (14Rasmussen H.B. Branner S. Wiberg F.C. Wagtmann N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 16Engel M. Hoffmann T. Wagner L. Wermann M. Heiser U. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Bode W.

Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 947-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The C-terminal loop of DPP-IV consists of the last 50 amino acid residues with two α-helices (amino acids 713-725 and 745-763) and one β-sheet (amino acids 726-744) interacting with the same region from the other monomer across a 2-fold axis (Fig. 1B). Both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions have been proposed to be responsible for dimer formation (12Polgar L. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 13Rosenblum J.S. Kozarich J.W. Curr. Opin. Chem.

This loop is highly conserved among the family of DPP-IV-containing prolyl dipeptidases (Fig. 2), though the functional importance of the loop has not been addressed experimentally.Fig. 2Conservation of the C-terminal loop among prolyl dipeptidases. The sequences are from the following GenBank™ accession numbers: NP_001926 (DPP-IV), Q12884 (FAP), NP_001927 (DPP6), AAG29766 (DPP8), AAL47179 (DPP9), and P42658 (DPP10). The conserved His (His750 for DPP-IV) is indicated by a green triangle and the catalytic triads by red stars, respectively. The alignment was done using ClustalW and TEXSHADE programs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In this article, the quaternary structures and catalytic activities were studied and compared among endogenous DPP-IV from human semen, recombinant wild-type and mutant DPP-IVs expressed in baculoviral-infected insect cells. The role of the highly conserved C-terminal loop for dimerization was investigated. For the first time, we have isolated and characterized the biochemical properties of monomeric mutant DPP-IV proteins altered at residue His750 of the loop, which is highly conserved among DPP-IV-containing prolyl dipeptidases (Fig. 2). Materials—The enzyme substrate H-Gly-Pro-pNA and dipeptide Gly-Pro were purchased from Bachem. Fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone. Lipofectin and the insect culture media, Grace and Express Five media, were from Invitrogen. Human liver cDNA library and linear viral vector were from Clontech. The ECL Western detection kit was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Q Sepharose™ High Performance, CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B and Superdex 200 prepacked-columns were from Amersham Biosciences. The chemical cross-linker dithiobis-succinimidyl propionate (DTSP) was from Pierce. Bovine adenosine deaminase (ADA) was from Roche Applied Science. Construction of the Secreted DPP-IV Expression Plasmid—The baculovirus expression plasmid pBac8-CD5 was constructed with the secretion tag CD5. Vector pBac-PAK8 (Clontech) was modified by inserting an MT-EGFP cassette at EcoRV site to facilitate the selection of the virus expressing EGFP (20Lee D.F. Chen C.C. Hsu T.A. Juang J.L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11873-11880Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). CD5 coding sequence was amplified by PCR from human Jurkat cell cDNA with the following primers: 5′-CGGGATCCATGCCCATGGGGTCTCT-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCCGAGGCAGGAAGC-3′. The CD5 cDNA fragment was released by digestion with BamH1 and XhoI before ligation into pBac-PAK8, resulting in pBac8-CD5. The expression plasmid of DPP-IV with the secretion tag CD5 is constructed as follows. The human cDNA fragment of DPP-IV containing amino acids 39-766 was amplified by PCR from a human liver cDNA library with the primers 5′-CCGCTCGAGAAAAACTTACACTCTA-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGACCTAAGGTAAAGAGAAACATTG-3′, and cloned into pCR®-Blunt II-Topo vector (Invitrogen). The DPP-IV cDNA was then released by digestion with XhoI and EcoRI before ligation into the vector pBac8-CD5. Site-directed mutagenesis of DPP-IV was carried out using Pfu Turbo DNA Polymerase (Stratagene). The primers used for generating H750A and H750E mutants are 5′-AGCACACCAAGAAATATATACCCAC-3′ and 5′-GTGGGTATATATTTCTTGGTGTGCT-3′ for H750E, and 5′-AGCACACCAAGCTATATATACCCAC-3′ and 5′-GTGGGTATATATAGCTTGGTGTGCT-3′ for H750A, respectively. All DPP-IV cDNA fragments cloned were sequenced to verify that they contain no additional mutations other than those desired. Insect Cell Culture, DNA Transfection, Virus Selection, and Amplification—Sf9 cells were grown in Grace medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 27 °C. The transfection of DNA to Sf9 cells, and the selection and amplification of the recombinant virus were carried out as described (21Chen Y.S. Chien C.H. Goparaju C.M. Hsu J.T. Liang P.H. Chen X. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 35: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For expression and purification purposes, Hi5 cells, instead of Sf9 cells, were used. Hi5 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0 TCID50 unit/cell (TCID50 is 50% tissue culture infectious dose), determined to be the optimal condition for protein expression as described (21Chen Y.S. Chien C.H. Goparaju C.M. Hsu J.T. Liang P.H. Chen X. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 35: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the cells were harvested at 72-h post-transfection. Purification of DPP-IV Proteins from Hi5 Insect Cells and Human Semen—The purification of wild-type recombinant DPP-IV was carried out as described (14Rasmussen H.B. Branner S. Wiberg F.C. Wagtmann N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). ADA affinity columns were prepared as described (22de Meester I. Vanhoof G. Lambeir A.M. Scharpe S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 189: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For the purification of both H750A and H750E mutant proteins, only the ADA column was used with the omission of Triton X-100 in both the washing and elution solutions. Human semen DPP-IV protein was purified from healthy Asian male donors as described (22de Meester I. Vanhoof G. Lambeir A.M. Scharpe S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 189: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The elution buffer for protein bound on an ADA column did not contain Triton X-100. Freezing at -80 °C does not change either the quaternary structure (determined by AUC) or the enzymatic activities of DPP-IV proteins described in this study. The purity of the protein was determined by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were visualized with Coomassie Blue. The amount of protein was determined by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—Purified proteins were run on a 4-20% gradient native polyacrylamide gel with the gel running system from Amersham Biosciences. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were conducted as described (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: A8:40-A8:51Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-DPP-IV antibody was generated in house using purified semen DPP-IV as the antigen. Kinetic Constant Determinations—To measure the kinetic parameters, the chromogenic substrate H-Gly-Pro-pNA was utilized to initiate the reaction, which was monitored at OD405 nm as a function of time (21Chen Y.S. Chien C.H. Goparaju C.M. Hsu J.T. Liang P.H. Chen X. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 35: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The enzyme concentrations used in the reaction were 10 nm for wild-type and H750A proteins, and 100 nm for the H750E protein, respectively. The initial rate was measured with less than 10% substrate depletion for the first 10 to 300 s. The steady state parameters, kcat and Km, were determined from initial velocity measurements at 0.5 to 5 Km of the substrate concentrations. Lineweaver Burk plots were analyzed using non-linear regression of the Michaelis-Menten equation. Correlation coefficients greater than 0.99 were obtained. Chemical Cross-linking in Intact Cells and Size Exclusion Chromatography—Chemical cross-linking in intact cells was conducted as described (24Kreis T.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 929-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Size exclusion chromatography was conducted at 4 °C. Purified proteins (0.5 ml at a concentration of 5 μm) were applied to a Superdex 200 10/30 column (10 × 300-310 mm) pre-equilibrated with PBS. The sample was eluted with the same buffer at 0.3 ml/min and 0.25 ml fractions were collected. The Superdex 200 10/30 column was calibrated with the Stokes Radii of ferritin (6.1 nm), catalase (5.22 nm), aldolase (4.81 nm), albumin (3.55 nm), ovalbumin (3.05 nm), and chymotrypsinogen A (2.09 nm) from Amersham Biosciences. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—DPP-IV proteins at concentrations of around 0.1 to 0.2 mg/ml (1.2-2.3 μm) were used for AUC analysis with either PBS, high salt (100 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 m Na2SO4, pH 7.5) or low salt (100 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) buffers as indicated. Buffer was changed using an Amicon device and DPP-IV proteins were allowed to equilibrate for at least 4 h or longer as indicated in the text at 25 °C after buffer changes. The sedimentation coefficients (S) of the enzyme were estimated by a Beckman-Coulter XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge with an An60Ti rotor as described (25Chang H.C. Chang G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23996-24002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity analysis was performed at 40,000 rpm at 25 °C with standard double sector aluminum centerpieces. The UV absorption of the cells was scanned every 5 min for 4 h. Sedimentation equilibrium was performed at 20 °C with six-channel open centerpieces and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 12 h. The data from both sedimentation velocity and sedimentation experiments were analyzed with the SedFit version 8.7 program to obtain molecular weights and sedimentation coefficients (25Chang H.C. Chang G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23996-24002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Sednterp version 1.07 program is used to obtain solvent density, viscosity, Stokes' radius (Rs) and anhydrous frictional ratio (f/fo). Dilution Experiment—Enzyme concentrations ranging from 200 to 1.6 nm were used in the dilution experiments. The experiments were carried out with consecutive 2-fold dilutions in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm DTT. The solution after dilution was incubated at 25 °C for 16 h to ensure attainment of dimer-monomer equilibrium. The reaction was initiated by adding the substrate H-Gly-Pro-pNA at a final concentration of 10 μm for both wild-type DPP-IV and H750A proteins. The initial rate of the reaction was recorded and converted to specific activity. Human DPP-IV Protein Is a Dimer in Intact Cells and in Vitro—From the crystal structures, the human recombinant DPP-IV was shown to be a homodimer whereas DPP-IV purified from porcine kidney is a homotetramer (14Rasmussen H.B.

In addition, previous studies showed that purified DPP-IV proteins from various sources migrated at sizes corresponding to either dimer or tetramer/oligomer according to gel filtration experiments (19Lambeir A.M. Diaz Pereira J.F. Chacon P. Vermeulen G. Heremans K. Devreese B. Van Beeumen J. De Meester I. Scharpe S. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1978; 253: 4617-4623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the physiologically relevant oligomerization state of DPP-IV, we performed chemical cross-linking in the DPP-IV-containing Caco-2 cells. The chemical cross-linker used was DTSP, a primary amine-specific cross-linker with moderate chain length. As shown in Fig. 3A, DPP-IV could form a dimer (240 kDa) in intact cells, twice the size of the monomer (∼120 kDa) (Fig. 3A, lane 2). The cross-linker DTSP is specific, because the addition of the DTT abolishes dimer formation (Fig. 3A, lane 1). The formation of dimer is DTSP-dependent since in the absence of DTSP, no dimer formation was observed (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). Next we determined whether endogenous DPP-IV purified from human semen (sDPP-IV) forms dimers in vitro. The purified protein was quite pure as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B, lane 1). By measuring its kinetic constants (kcat and Km values), we confirmed that purified sDPP-IV was as active as reported previously (Table I) (31Lambeir A.M. Proost P. Durinx C. Bal G. Senten K. Augustyns K. Scharpe S. Van Damme J. De Meester I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29839-29845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). On a native gel, sDPP-IV runs predominantly as a dimer of about 200 kDa with the presence of minor but higher molecular mass species (Fig. 3C, lane 1). It elutes at a position corresponding to a 400 kDa protein with a Stokes' radius of 5.9 nm, determined by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 4A and Table II). Cross-linking of the purified protein in vitro showed that the protein is dimeric with a mass of 250 kDa (data not shown). We then used AUC to determine the hydrodynamic properties of sDPP-IV. As shown in Fig. 5A, sDPP-IV is undoubtedly homodimeric with a sedimentation coefficient of 9.1 S (Table II) and a molecular mass of 225 kDa. Notably, there is only a single peak corresponding to the dimer in the AUC experiment, suggesting that the dimer is the predominant form under the conditions tested. For sDPP-IV, the value of the anhydrous frictional ratio f/fo is 1.4, indicating that the protein is non-spherical. Therefore, gel filtration does not provide an accurate measurement of sDPP-IV's quaternary structure and molecular weight, because of the protein's non-globular shape. The aberrant mobility in gel filtration was also observed in previous studies with DPP-IV proteins purified from either human fibroblast cells or urine (29Saison M. Verlinden J. Van Leuven F. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. Biochem. J. 1983; 216: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 32Kato T. Hama T. Kojima K. Nagatsu T. Sakakibara S. Clin.

https://openalex.org/W2107894529,"Mutations in the Cav2.1 alpha1-subunit of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels cause human diseases, including familial hemiplegic migraine type-1 (FHM1). FHM1 mutations alter channel gating and enhanced channel activity at negative potentials appears to be a common pathogenetic mechanism. Different beta-subunit isoforms (primarily beta4 and beta3) participate in the formation of Cav2.1 channel complexes in mammalian brain. Here we investigated not only whether FHM1 mutations K1336E (KE), W1684R (WR), and V1696I (VI) can affect Cav2.1 channel function but focused on the important question whether mutation-induced changes on channel gating depend on the beta-subunit isoform. Mutants were co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes together with beta1, beta3, or beta4 and alpha2delta1 subunits, and channel function was analyzed using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. WR shifted the voltage dependence for steady-state inactivation of Ba2+ inward currents (IBa) to more negative voltages with all beta-subunits tested. In contrast, a similar shift was observed for KE only when expressed with beta3. All mutations promoted IBa decay during pulse trains only when expressed with beta1 or beta3 but not with beta4. Enhanced decay could be explained by delayed recovery from inactivation. KE accelerated IBa inactivation only when co-expressed with beta3, and VI slowed inactivation only with beta1 or beta3. KE and WR shifted channel activation of IBa to more negative voltages. As the beta-subunit composition of Cav2.1 channels varies in different brain regions, our data predict that the functional FHM1 phenotype also varies between different neurons or even within different neuronal compartments."
https://openalex.org/W1973281870,"The conversion into abnormally folded prion protein (PrP) plays a key role in prion diseases. PrPC carries two N-linked glycan chains at amino acid residues 180 and 196 (mouse). Previous in vitro data indicated that the conversion process may not require glycosylation of PrP. However, it is conceivable that these glycans function as intermolecular binding sites during the de novo infection of cells on susceptible organisms and/or play a role for the interaction of both PrP isoforms. Such receptor-like properties could contribute to the formation of specific prion strains. However, in earlier studies, mutations at the glycosylation sites of PrP led to intracellular trafficking abnormalities, which made it impossible to generate PrP glycosylation-deficient mice that were susceptible to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or scrapie. We have now tested more than 25 different mutations at both consensus sites and found one nonglycosylated (T182N/T198A) and two monoglycosylated (T182N and T198A) mutants that rather retained authentic cellular trafficking properties. In vitro all three mutants were converted into PrPres. PrP mutant T182N/T198A also provoked a strong dominant-negative inhibition on the endogenous wild type PrP conversion reaction. By using the two monoglycosylated mutants, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing PrPC in their brains at levels of 2–4 times that of nontransgenic mice. Most interestingly, such mice proved readily susceptible to a challenge with either scrapie (Chandler and Me7) or with BSE. Incubation times were comparable or in some instances even significantly shorter than those of nontransgenic mice. These data indicate that diglycosylation of PrPC is not mandatory for prion infection in vivo. The conversion into abnormally folded prion protein (PrP) plays a key role in prion diseases.

In vitro all three mutants were converted into PrPres. PrP mutant T182N/T198A also provoked a strong dominant-negative inhibition on the endogenous wild type PrP conversion reaction. By using the two monoglycosylated mutants, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing PrPC in their brains at levels of 2–4 times that of nontransgenic mice. Most interestingly, such mice proved readily susceptible to a challenge with either scrapie (Chandler and Me7) or with BSE. Incubation times were comparable or in some instances even significantly shorter than those of nontransgenic mice. These data indicate that diglycosylation of PrPC is not mandatory for prion infection in vivo. Prion diseases include Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, Gerstmann-Straüssler-Scheinker syndrome, Kuru, and fatal familial insomnia in humans, scrapie in sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) 1The abbreviations used are: BSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy; PrP, prion protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ORF, open reading frame; moORF, mouse ORF; MEM, minimum Eagle's medium; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PE, phycoerythrin; PK, proteinase K; PI-PLC, phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C.1The abbreviations used are: BSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy; PrP, prion protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ORF, open reading frame; moORF, mouse ORF; MEM, minimum Eagle's medium; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PE, phycoerythrin; PK, proteinase K; PI-PLC, phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C. in cattle, transmissible mink encephalopathy in mink, feline spongiform encephalopathy in cats, and chronic wasting disease in cervids. Prion diseases are characterized by incubation times of up to several years or decades. The post-translational conversion of cellular protease-sensitive prion protein (PrPC syn. PrPsen) into its protease-resistant isoform (PrPres) is the key feature in these infectious diseases (1Bolton D.C. McKinley M.P. Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 218: 1309-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Cellular and pathological PrP are encoded by the same gene (Prnp) (2Basler K. Oesch B. Scott M. Westaway D. Walchli M.

The cellular isoform is bound to the external surface of the plasma membrane, whereas PrPres accumulates in late endosomes and lysosomes (7Taraboulos A. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. J.

In the fully matured protein both N-glycosylation sites are occupied. Analysis of hamster- or mouse-derived PrPres revealed that the glycan chains represent a mixture of bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary complex-type sugars with 70% of the galactose residues sialyzed (12Endo T.

A variety of experimental scrapie strains has been isolated and characterized in rodents, which show marked differences in the clinical phenotype, pathology, and in the biochemical features of PrPres. The existence of different strains still raises the question of how such a diversity can be encoded by a single protein composed of a defined amino acid sequence. Variations in the protein conformation and in the glycosylation of PrP have been postulated as modulators of the conversion and/or disease process and of prion strain properties (16Bessen R.A.

Prion strains can be distinguished (20Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Gen.

Nature. 1996; 383: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). Although some scrapie strains such as Chandler produce predominantly heavily diglycosylated PrPres, in others (e.g. Me7) monoglycosylated PrPres is favored (22Kuczius T. Haist I. Groschup M.H. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 178: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Comparison of the glycoforms of normal and abnormal hamster PrP showed that both contain generally the same N-linked oligosaccharides but at different ratios (23Rudd P.M. Endo T. Colominas C. Groth D. Wheeler S.F. Harvey D.J. Wormald M.R. Serban H. Prusiner S.B. Kobata A. Dwek R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13044-13049Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has recently been shown that the PrPC glycosylation can significantly affect the PrPres formation, if both are derived from different species (24Priola S.A. Lawson V.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6692-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of the glycans in prion infection and pathogenesis, we sought to develop transgenic mice that express mono- or nonglycosylated PrPC with retained authentic PrP trafficking. It is generally accepted that the surface expression of PrPC is necessary for a de novo prion infection of cells (25Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18217-18223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Taraboulos A. Scott M. Semenov A. Avrahami D. Laszlo L. Prusiner S.B. Avraham D. J.

Glycobiology. 1990; 1: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 31Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol.

Transgenic mice carrying this mutation were resistant to a scrapie infection and showed only low expression levels of PrPC (19DeArmond S.J. Sanchez H. Yehiely F. Qiu Y. Ninchak-Casey A. Daggett V. Camerino A.P. Cayetano J. Rogers M. Groth D. Torchia M. Tremblay P. Scott M.R. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1337-1348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the deletion of the second glycosylation site did not change the trafficking of the prion protein nor the fundamental susceptibility. However, expression levels that were achieved did not suffice to effectively support the infection cycle (19DeArmond S.J. Sanchez H. Yehiely F. Qiu Y. Ninchak-Casey A. Daggett V. Camerino A.P.

Another approach was based on the direct mutation of the attachment sites (N180Q/N196Q) (32Korth C. Kaneko K. Prusiner S.B. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2555-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) in vitro. However, viable transgenic mice based on this concept have not been reported to date. To reveal PrP glycosylation-deficient mutants with retained authentic subcellular trafficking, we systematically studied more than 25 different mutations at the consensus sites. Among those we found only three mutants lacking either one or both glycosylation sites and with no detectable change in their expression topology in neuroblastoma, Chinese hamster ovary, and murine fibroblast cells. In scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells, even mutants with hampered or blocked trafficking turned out to be convertible into their proteinase K-resistant isoform, but only mutants highly expressed on the surface promoted a de novo infection of cells. In addition, although being convertible itself, the unglycosylated mutant T182N/T198A showed a remarkable dominant-negative inhibition of the endogenous murine PrP conversion process in ScN2a cells. Similar effects have been reported in the literature and were explained by conversion inefficiencies of PrPC across species barriers (amino acids 112–187) (33Priola S.A. Biomed. Pharmacother. 1999; 53: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and/or an interference with the “protein X”-binding site, a proposed chaperone-like factor facilitating murine PrP conversion (amino acids 167, 171, 214, and 218) (34Telling G.C.

Finally, we produced transgenic mice overexpressing these glycosylation-deficient PrP mutants and that were proven to be susceptible to challenge with BSE and scrapie prion strains. Cloning of Glycosylation Consensus Site Mutants—Mutants of mAb 3F4 epitope-tagged mouse PrP-encoding constructs were designated T182X (where X indicates every possible amino acid) without or in combination with T198A. Mutations were introduced by site-directed PCR mutagenesis. The 3F4-tagged mouse ORF cDNA including 406 bp of the 3′-untranslated region cloned into the vector pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) (Invitrogen, AF286076) served as template. The following primers were used: ngly182.rev, 5′-GGT GGT GGT GAC CGT GTG CTG CTT GAT GGC aAT ATT GAC GC-3′ (bp 533–573 moORF; mutations are shown in boldface; at position bp 543 (lowercase letter) silent mutagenesis for an additional SspI restriction site); musnarxxho.rev, 5′-CCC CCC TCG AGG GCG CCA TCC CCA AAC AGT GGC TTC TTT GGT TG-3′ (bp 1138–1170 3′-untranslated region moPrnp, introducing an XhoI restriction site (boldface) at position bp 407 downstream of moORF); ngly198.seq, 5′-GCA CAC GGT CAC CAC CAC CAC CAA GGG GGA GAA tTT CGC CGA GAC CG-3′ (bp 555–601moORF; mutations are marked boldface; at position bp 588 (lowercase letter) silent mutagenesis for an additional ApoI restriction site); mu5.seq, 5′-GCG AAC CTT GGC TAC TGG CTG-3′ (bp 4–24); PI.rev, 5′-GGT GGT GGT GAC CGT GTG CTG CTT GAT SWW GAT ATT GAC GC-3′; PII.rev, 5′-GGT GGT GGT GAC CGT GTG CTG CTT GAT SSS GAT ATT GAC GC-3′; PIII.rev, 5′-GGT GGT GGT GAC CGT GTG CTG CTT GAT SSW GAT ATT GAC GC-3′; PIV.rev:, 5′-GGT GGT GGT GAC CGT GTG CTG CTT GAT SWS GAT ATT GAC GC-3′ (bp 533–573 moORF, S indicates G and C; W indicates A and T). For generation of T182X mutants, mu5.seq was used in combination with PI.rev, PII.rev, PIII.rev, or PIV.rev. By using these primers we did not obtain every amino acid at codon 182. Therefore, we used the following primers in combination with mu5.seq: Val182.rev, Gln182.rev, Glu182.rev, Asp182.rev, Lys182.rev, Met182.rev, Arg182.rev, or Trp182.rev corresponding to PI.rev-PIV.rev but encoding the specific amino acid. Amplicon and template were then cleaved by Bsu36I and BsteII, and the mutated PCR products were ligated into the vector again. The T198A mutation was introduced by primers ngly198.seq and musnarxxho.rev. Product and template were cleaved by BsteII and NarI. The T182A/T198A and T182N/T198A constructs were obtained by introducing the T198A mutation into the T182A or T182N cDNA by using Bsu36I and BsteII cleavage sites. For conversion experiments, PrP 3F4 epitope expressing mutants encoding T182A, T182N, T198A, T182A/T198A, and T182N/T198A were cloned into the retroviral vector pSFF (Z22761) (38Bestwick R.K. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5404-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) using BamHI and XhoI cleavage sites. For generation of transgenic mice, the corresponding mutants were cloned into the vector phgPrP (43Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Priola S.A. Kocisko D.A. Race R.E. Bessen R.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T.

The fidelity of each construct was confirmed by sequencing. All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany). Cloning of an N-terminal Deletion Mutant—This construct, missing the N-terminal signal sequence (amino acids 1–22), was produced by SOE-PCR (splicing by overlap extension) using the following primers: N-sig.seq, 5′-gaA TCA GTC ATC ATG AAG CGG CCA AAG CCT GGA GGG-3′; CMV.seq, 5′-cat atg cca agt acg ccc cct att gac g-3′; BsteII.rev, 5′-CAT CGG TCT CGG TGA AGT TCT CCC CCT TGG-3′; N-sig.rev, 5′-CGC TTC ATG ATG ACT GAT tct aga tct gc-3′. Three consecutive PCRs were performed as follows. The first used primers CMV.seq and N-sig.rev, and the second used primers N-sig.seq and BsteII.rev. A 3F4-tagged mouse ORF served as a template. Finally, the obtained PCR products were used as templates for the last PCR with primers CMV.seq and BsteII.seq. The fidelity was confirmed by sequencing. Cell Lines—Murine neuroblastoma (N2a) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA).

N2a cells were grown in MEM-NEAA, CHO cells in a 3:1 mixture Dulbecco's MEM and F-12, and murine fibroblast cells in RPMI 1640 and ScN2a cells in Opti-MEM or MEM-NEAA. Media were enriched with 10% FCS and contained penicillin/streptomycin. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Cells were grown in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Transient or Stable Expression of Mutant PrP in Cell Cultures—N2a and CHO cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and murine fibroblasts were transfected by CaPO4 (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's directions. For every construct at least two independent transfections were performed. The transfection efficiency was measured by FACS analysis using pEGFPn3 (Clontech, U57609). For N2a cells, transfection rates of about 70% were achieved. Antibiotic resistant clones of N2a and CHO cells were selected by using 500 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen), and when necessary the cells were subcloned and then maintained in 250 μg/ml Zeocin. For every construct we performed at least two transfections. FACS Analysis—Living cells (5 × 105) were resuspended in 100 μlof ice-cold PBS containing 2% FCS and were incubated (20 min, 4 °C) with mAb3F4 1:100. The cells were washed and incubated (20 min, 4 °C) with IgG GAM2a-FITC 1:200 or IgG GAM-PE 1:50 in cold PBS, 2% FCS, then washed twice, and resuspended in 200 μl of PBS, 2% FCS, and then 10,000 cells were analyzed by FACStarPlus (BD Biosciences). Calculations were made using the “Cellquest” program (BD Biosciences) on a Macintosh Quadra 650. Fluorescein (FITC)- and phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated second antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). To every FITC-labeled sample, 30 μl of DNA-binding propidium iodide solution (1 mg/ml) (Sigma) was added prior to measurement in order to stain dead cells for an electronic exclusion. (The signal of FITC is measured at 530 nm, whereas propidium iodide has its emission at about 570 nm.) For every construct we performed at least two transient transfections. As a control, cells were FACS-analyzed by adding a conjugate only. PrP Conversion in ScN2a Cells—PrP in vitro conversion assays were conducted by using a retroviral expression system for exogenous PrP (43Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Priola S.A. Kocisko D.A. Race R.E. Bessen R.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Chesebro B. Mol. Biotechnol. 1999; 13: 45-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ScN2a cells (3 × 105) were plated in medium and grown overnight. This medium was removed and replaced by another medium containing 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). After 2 h a retroviral supernatant in different dilutions was added and incubated overnight. The cells were split on a T-25 flask (for PrPC detection), a T-75 flask (for PrPres detection), and a 24-well plate (for immunohistochemistry) and were grown to confluence and treated as follows. For the detection of PrPC, cells from a confluent T25-flask were washed with PBS and resuspended with lysis buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate) to prepare a 10% cell homogenate, which could be then further analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For the detection of PrPres, cells from a confluent T-75 flask were harvested using 0.25% trypsin and pelleted at 800 rpm for 5 min. The cells were then resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate), and debris was removed by mild centrifugation. The samples were digested with proteinase K (PK 25 μg/ml, 37 °C, 1 h), and PMSF was added to stop digestion followed by a final centrifugation at 265,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. After resuspension and heat denaturation in sample buffer (final concentration 4% SDS, 100 mm Tris-HCl, 175.2 mm sucrose, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, pH 7.4), one-fourth from each sample was run on a 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by immunoblotting. Untransduced cells were loaded as a control, because initial experiments revealed no discrepancy between mock- and non-transduced cells (data not shown). Intrinsic Proteinase K Resistance of PrPC—Appropriate cell lysate equivalents were treated with one of the following procedures (at 37 °C): 25 μg/ml PK for 1 h, 1 μg/ml PK for 30 min, 0.5 μg/ml PK for 30 min, or 3.3 μg/ml PK for 10 min. The digestions were stopped by heat denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min. Samples were then pretreated with guanidinium HCl (final concentration 3 m) for 10 min at room temperature, and proteins were acetone-precipitated (final concentration 50%). The resulting pellets were resuspended in sample buffer, electrophoresed (16% gels), and immunoblotted using mAb 3F4 (44Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deglycosylation of PrPC—Where indicated, cell lysates were treated with 10 units/ml N-glycosidase F or 0.26–0.36 units/ml endoglycosidase H (both reagents were from Roche Applied Science) for 16 h at 37 °C before the samples were electrophoresed followed by immunoblotting. To avoid incomplete digestion, higher endoglycosidase H concentrations were used as described in earlier protocols (31Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21479-21487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Biotinylation of Cell Surface Proteins—Cell membrane proteins were biotinylated as described (45Petersen R.B. Parchi P. Richardson S.L. Urig C.B. Gambetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12661-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) using Sulfobiotin-X-NHS (Calbiochem), which is not able to enter intact cells and was immunoprecipitated with the mAb 3F4 as described (46Chen S.G.

Trypan blue staining (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) was carried out to exclude that sulfobiotin-X-NHS was labeling intracellular proteins because of cytoplasmic leakages. As additional control, we performed an immunoprecipitation using mAb β-actin for detection of intracellular actin. N2a cells were biotinylated, and the reaction was stopped or not stopped and afterward immunoprecipitated by β-actin. Only data from experiments were used in which no signal was detectable in the stopped sample. Immunoprecipitated PrPC was run on 13 or 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and biotinylated PrP was detected with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (1:1.000) followed by visualization with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). PI-PLC Release—N2a cells (80% confluent) from a T-75 flask were washed three times with MEM-NEAA and incubated with PI-PLC (0.1 units/ml in MEM-NEAA) (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 4 h. Following this treatment the supernatant was separated from floating cells by centrifugation (800 rpm, 5 min), and the proteins were then methanol-precipitated. The resulting pellet was resuspended in electrophoresis sample buffer. Cells were harvested and lysed (as described above for the detection of PrPC). The cell lysate and PI-PLC released proteins were analyzed on 13% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Identically treated tissue cultures without the addition of PI-PLC served as controls. Verification of Disulfide Bonds—Cells of a confluent T-75 flask were lysed in N-ethylmaleimide (Calbiochem) lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.8, 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm PMSF in PBS). After a mild centrifugation, supernatant proteins were heat-denatured at 95 °C for 5 min either under nonreducing (by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer: 400 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6% w/v SDS, 20% glycerin, 2 mm EDTA, pH 6.8, 0.01% bromphenol blue) or reducing conditions (sample buffer plus 5 μl dithiothreitol (300 mm dithiothreitol)). Reduced and nonreduced samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. One lane was spared because of probable diffusion of dithiothreitol in the gel. Solubility Assay—Cells from a T-75 flask were dissolved in 3 ml of solubility buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate), and debris was removed by mild centrifugation. PMSF (0.81 mm) was added, and the samples were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 265,000 × g, 4 °C for 1 h. The pellets were resuspended in sample buffer, and supernatants were precipitated as described above. Western Blotting—Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore) and blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 for 30 min. The membranes were incubated overnight in non-fat dry milk in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 with either mAb 3F4 (1:3.000), Ra5/7 (1:2.000), or mAb SAF70 (1:1.500). The membranes were washed three times in washing buffer (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) followed by incubation with GAM-PO (goat anti-mouse IgG peroxidase, 1:3.000) or SAR-PO (sheep anti-mouse IgG peroxidase, 1:3.000) (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) for 45 min. After another three washing steps, signals were visualized with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Mouse monoclonal antibody 3F4 (44Kas"

Extensive characterization of the effectors on which the G proteins act has suggested that the activated G protein α and βγ subunits function on the plasma membrane (3Neves S.R. Ram P.T. Iyengar R.

It has been thought that the post-translational addition of a lipid moiety to the α subunit and the γ subunit aids in the localization of Gα and Gβγ complex to the plasma membrane, where they act on the effector molecules (7Chen C.A. Manning D.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, there is little information about the properties of these proteins or the signaling they mediate in intact live mammalian cells, because studies attempting to observe G protein function in living mammalian cells have been limited. To visualize the impact of receptor activation and inactivation on the spatial distribution of G protein subunits, we tagged G protein subunits with the yellow and cyan mutant forms of the green fluorescent protein, YFP 1The abbreviations used are: YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; galT, galactosyl transferase.1The abbreviations used are: YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; galT, galactosyl transferase. and CFP, respectively. The fusion proteins were expressed in mammalian cell lines and observed after activating overexpressed or endogenous receptors using fluorescence-based imaging methods. Although we have previously obtained evidence indicating the direct involvement of the G protein γ subunit in receptor interaction (8Azpiazu I. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41742-41747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 9Kisselev O. Pronin A. Ermolaeva M. Gautam N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9102-9106Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of receptor activation on αo-CFP, β1, and different γ subunit types tagged with YFP in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing M2 muscarinic receptors. We discovered that γ-YFP translocated from the plasma membrane to the cell interior on receptor activation and translocated back to the plasma membrane on inactivation. The β subunit co-translocated with the γ subunit. The rapidity of the translocation process and proportion of βγ complex that translocated were dependent on the γ subunit type present in the expressed G protein. Experiments using a marker for the Golgi complex and a Golgi disrupting agent, brefeldin A, indicated that the βγ complex translocates to the Golgi complex. The translocation was sensitive to Gi/o- and Gq-coupled receptor stimulation. Endogenous receptors also stimulated Gβγ translocation. The translocation of the βγ complex is selective, because αo-CFP or a chimeric αo-q-CFP that couples to Gq-coupling receptors do not translocate from the plasma membrane in response to receptor stimulation. The rapidity of the Gβγ complex translocation process suggests that it is diffusion-mediated. Chemicals and Expression Constructs—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. CHO cells stably expressing the M2 muscarinic receptor (10Azpiazu I. Cruzblanca H. Li P. Linder M. Zhuo M. Gautam N. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3036-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and 5HT1A receptor (from Dr. D. Manning, University of Pennsylvania) have been described previously (12Liang W. Bidwell C.A. Collodi P.R. Mills S.E. J. Anim. Sci. 2000; 78: 2329-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). CHO cells were grown in CHO IIIa medium (Invitrogen) containing dialyzed fetal bovine serum (M2-CHO, M3-CHO, CHO) or charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (5HT1A-CHO) (Atlanta Biologicals), methotrexate (M2-CHO, M3-CHO), penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine, and fungizone. G418 and hypoxanthine/thymidine were added to 5HT1A-CHO medium. HT-1080 cells were grown in ATCC-2003 medium (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) containing dialyzed fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and fungizone. αo-CFP, αo-q-CFP, and β1-YFP constructs have been described previously (13Azpiazu I. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27709-27718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The citrine mutant of YFP and the non-oligomerizing forms of both CFP and YFP (14Zhang J. Campbell R.E. Ting A.Y. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 906-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar, 15Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar) were engineered by mutagenesis and used in the experiments. The γ5 and γ11 cDNAs were introduced downstream of YFP (γ11 was also introduced downstream of CFP) in the pENTRY vectors (Invitrogen). The αo, β1, and γ11 cDNAs were also cloned into pENTRY vectors. All constructs were checked by determining the nucleotide sequence and transferred to pDEST (Invitrogen) for mammalian expression. YFP-tagged galactosyl transferase (galT) was obtained from M. Philips, New York University Medical School. Imaging—Cells were cultured on glass coverslips and transiently transfected with appropriate combinations of different G protein subunits as described in the text and figure legends. The coverslips were washed with Hanks' buffer saline solution supplemented with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 1 mg/ml glucose and mounted on an imaging chamber with an internal volume of 25 μl (Warner Instruments). A fluid delivery system, including a programmable valve controller and Teflon valves (10 ms open/closure time), was used to deliver the buffer with or without agonist or antagonist through the chamber at a rate of 1 ml/min with a pressure-regulated flow controller (Automate Scientific). The cells were visualized with a Zeiss Axioscope fluorescent microscope using a 63× oil immersion objective (1.4 numerical aperture) and 100-W mercury lamp with a Hamamatsu CCD Orca-ER camera. The shutter, emission, and excitation filter wheels were controlled by a Sutter Lambda 10-2 optical filter changer (Sutter Instrument Company) run by MetaVue (Universal Imaging) software. The filter and beam splitter combinations (from Chroma Technology) were as follows: for CFP (CC), D436/20 excitation (x), D480/40 emission (m); for YFP (YY), D500/20 (x), D535/30 (m); a polychroic beam splitter (Chroma 86002BS); and 3 or 10% neutral density filters. In those cases where both CFP and YFP fusions were co-expressed in cells, the cells expressing relatively similar levels of the two fusions were selected based on emission intensities. Images were acquired at 20-s intervals. The exposure times were between 0.6 and 1.4 s. The cells were treated with pertussis toxin at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml 6-15 h prior to the analysis. To disrupt Golgi in the cells, 10 μm brefeldin A was used in the culture medium 6-10 h before cell analysis. CHO cells stably expressing M2 muscarinic receptors were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding G protein αo, β1 and γ11 subunits tagged with YFP. γ11 is a farnesylated γ subunit that is present in several mammalian tissues (16Morishita R. Ueda H. Kato K. Asano T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). YFP was attached to the N terminus of γ11, because we had earlier discovered that the tag did not affect receptor activation of the G protein and it does not affect the farnesylation that occurs at the C terminus of the subunit (13Azpiazu I. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27709-27718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The cells were imaged as described above. Images of individual cells before and after sequential exposure to an agonist, carbachol, and an antagonist, atropine, are shown in Fig. 1A and Supplemental Fig. 1 (Movie 1). The emission signal from γ11-YFP is initially localized to the plasma membrane. After M2 muscarinic receptor activation, the γ11-YFP translocates to the cell interior. Subsequent inactivation of the M2 receptor leads to the translocation of γ11-YFP back to the plasma membrane. Plots of the time courses of changes in the YFP emission intensity on the plasma membrane and the intracellular region where the translocated YFP signal localizes are shown in Fig. 1B (left and right panels). The t for the translocation of γ11-YFP protein in both directions is <20 s (Fig. 1B). When M2-CHO cells expressing αo-CFP, β1, and γ11-YFP were exposed to different concentrations of agonist and the translocation response measured, the translocation of Gβγ was exquisitely sensitive to the extent of receptor activation (Supplemental Fig. 1). To examine the impact of this translocation on the G protein α subunit, we co-expressed αo-CFP with β1 and γ11-YFP into the same cells. CFP was inserted downstream of Gly-92 of αo (13Azpiazu I. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27709-27718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). αo-CFP did not affect the translocation properties of γ11-YFP compared with native αo (Fig. 1C). As anticipated, based on our previous findings (13Azpiazu I. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27709-27718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the CFP emission increases with receptor activation and decreases with receptor inactivation due to the corresponding changes in the fluorescence resonance energy transfer occurring from CFP to YFP (Fig. 1C). This result indicates that the γ subunit translocation results from the activation of the α subunit in the G protein heterotrimer. Consistent with this result, pertussis toxin-treated M2-CHO cells expressing β1 and γ11-YFP do not show receptor-mediated translocation of γ11-YFP, demonstrating a requirement for both the endogenous αi subunit and receptor activation of a G protein for translocation to occur (data not shown). Although it is required for translocation of γ11-YFP, the α subunit itself does not translocate in response to receptor activation (Supplemental Fig. 1 (Movie 2)). To examine whether this selective translocation of the γ subunit included the β subunit, we co-expressed β1-YFP along with γ11-CFP and observed the response of β1-YFP to receptor stimulation. Fig. 1D shows that the β subunit co-translocates with the γ subunit consistent with extensive previous evidence that the β subunit is in a tight complex with the γ subunit (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar, 2Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar, 3Neves S.R. Ram P.T. Iyengar R. Science. 2002; 296: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). When the β1-YFP protein was co-expressed with untagged γ11, it also translocated, indicating that the fluorescent protein tag of γ11-YFP did not affect translocation (Supplemental Fig. 1). In a control experiment, when αo-CFP and β1-YFP were expressed in M2-CHO cells without γ11, very little receptor-dependent translocation of β1-YFP was detected, indicating that translocation was dependent on the presence of the γ11 subunit (data not shown). It is likely that γ11 subunit dependence of β subunit translocation is linked to the role of the γ subunit in receptor interaction. We then examined whether a distinctly different γ subunit type, γ5 (which has 33% identity at the primary structure level with γ11), translocates similarly. M2-CHO cells were transiently transfected with αo-CFP, β1, and γ5-YFP. Unlike γ11, which is farnesylated, γ5 is geranylgeranylated. The results of imaging the cells in the presence of agonist and antagonist are shown in Fig. 1E and Supplemental Fig. 1 (Movie 3). γ5-YFP translocates in response to the receptor state, although the proportion of γ5 translocated from the plasma membrane at steady state is distinctly less (Supplemental Fig. 1, compare Movie 2 with Movie 3), and the rate at which translocation occurs is also slower with a t of ∼1 min. To identify the organelle to which the G protein βγ complex was translocated, we co-expressed a trans Golgi complex marker, galT tagged with YFP (17Weiss T.S. Chamberlain C.E. Takeda T. Lin P. Hahn K.M. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14961-14966Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Chiu V.K. Bivona T. Hach A. Sajous J.B. Silletti J. Wiener H. Johnson II, R.L. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), with γ11-CFP in M2-CHO cells and imaged the cells after M2 activation. Overlaying the images of CFP and YFP emission showed that γ11-CFP was localized in the Golgi complex (Fig. 2A). To confirm this localization, we treated the transfected M2-CHO cells with brefeldin A, which is known to disrupt the Golgi complex (19Dinter A. Berger E.G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). When these cells were examined after agonist treatment, translocation of γ11-YFP to the cell interior could no longer be detected (Fig. 2B). Control cells expressing galT-YFP did not show galT localization, indicating that the Golgi complex was indeed disrupted in these cells (Fig. 2B). We then tested the generality of the receptor-mediated Gβγ translocation process in the following systems. To eliminate the possibility that translocation was peculiar to M2 receptors, we tested the ability of a distinctly different isoform of the acetylcholine receptor, M3, to induce translocation of βγ11. M3 couples to the Gq class of α subunits, whereas M2 couples to the Gi/o class (11Carroll R.C. Peralta E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3036-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In CHO cells stably expressing M3 receptors, we co-expressed β1 and γ11-YFP with a chimeric αo subunit containing the C-terminal tail of αq (Fig. 3A). This chimeric Gαo-q is activated by the M3 receptor (but not M2) as we have shown before (13Azpiazu I. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27709-27718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with pertussis toxin to prevent cross-activation of Gi proteins in CHO cells by M3 (CHO cells do not express Go (13Azpiazu I. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27709-27718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)). Fig. 3A shows that γ11-YFP translocated to the Golgi complex when M3 receptors were activated and translocated back to the plasma membrane when they were inactivated. To examine whether receptors other than muscarinic receptors can induce translocation, we performed similar experiments with CHO cells stably expressing 5HT1A receptors. γ11-YFP translocated as in the case of M2 and M3, depending on the activation state of the 5HT1A receptor (Fig. 3B). Translocation was not dependent on overexpression of receptors because an endogenous receptor in CHO cells, 5HT1B also induced translocation (Fig. 3C). To test whether a cell line from a different species could induce translocation, we transfected a human lung fibrosarcoma cell line (HT1080) with cDNAs for M2 receptors, αo-CFP, β1, and γ11-YFP and imaged the cells in the presence of agonist and antagonist as above. Translocation was induced, indicating that the process is not peculiar to CHO cells (Fig. 3D). Based on a variety of in vitro experiments, it has been thought that G proteins, which are peripherally associated with the plasma membrane, are activated by transmembrane receptors, and after subunit dissociation, act on effector molecules on the plasma membrane (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar, 2Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar, 3Neves S.R. Ram P.T. Iyengar R. Science. 2002; 296: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 7Chen C.A. Manning D.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Consistent with this proposal, known effectors of G proteins (such as adenylyl cyclase and ion-conducting channels) are membrane proteins, and others (such as phospholipase C isozymes) act on substrates localized to the plasma membrane (3Neves S.R. Ram P.T. Iyengar R. Science. 2002; 296: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 4Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar, 5Tang W.J.

Metab. 2001; 12: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The rapid translocation of the G protein βγ complex from plasma membrane to the Golgi complex in response to receptor stimulation is therefore very surprising. This hitherto unanticipated translocation suggests that the βγ complex may act on an effector molecule located in the Golgi complex. Gαi3 has previously been shown to be present in the Golgi, although receptor-dependent effects on this localization were not identified (17Weiss T.S. Chamberlain C.E. Takeda T. Lin P. Hahn K.M. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14961-14966Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The G protein βγ complex has been shown earlier to act on protein kinase D in the Golgi complex to regulate Golgi disassembly (20Jamora C. Yamanouye N. Van Lint J. Laudenslager J. Vandenheede J.R. Faulkner D.J. Malhotra V. Cell. 1999; 98: 59-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, that work did not identify the signaling pathway or its mechanistic basis that allowed the G protein βγ complex to act on the Golgi. The relationship between the translocation seen here and the previously reported action of Gβγ on protein kinase D in Golgi is not clear. It is possible that the function of an unidentified effector in Golgi is modulated by receptor-regulated translocation of Gβγ. There is now evidence that, in addition to its role in the plasma membrane, Ras acts on effectors in the Golgi complex (21Bivona T.G. Perez De Castro I. Ahearn I.M. Grana T.M. Chiu V.K. Lockyer P.J. Cullen P.J. Pellicer A. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Nature. 2003; 424: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). A recent report shows that a protein resident in the Golgi complex binds MEK when signaling is activated by a tyrosine kinase receptor (22Torii S. Kusakabe M. Yamamoto T. Maekawa M. Nishida E. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 33-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). These evidences for the Golgi complex acting as a distinct site for downstream elements of the tyrosine kinase signaling pathways makes the cytoplasmic surface of this organelle an attractive locale for integrating regulated cross-talk with G protein pathways through the translocation of the βγ complex seen here. Overall, the ability of one signaling arm of the G protein to spatially isolate its activity from the plasma membrane to an internal organelle demonstrates a novel mode by which G protein-mediated signaling can be spatially segregated. Another role for this translocation may be the rapid decrease in the concentration of the βγ complex in the plasma membrane resulting in a dampening of signaling activity because of the reduced concentration of heterotrimer available for activation. This effect can be further modulated by differential magnitudes and rates of translocation as seen in the case of γ11 and γ5. The rate of translocation of Gβγ back to the plasma membrane on receptor inactivation is as rapid as the translocation to the Golgi on activation of the receptor. Both processes occur within a time frame that suggests that translocation is diffusion-mediated rather than actively controlled. The rapid reversibility of the translocation suggests that the receptor can exert tight control over the signaling effects of the spatial segregation of Gβγ. The results here demonstrate that by imaging signaling activity in a live cell, previously unanticipated novel mechanisms underlying signaling can be identified. The ability to image the translocation of Gβγ in a living cell in response to a receptor agonist, as well as an antagonist, can be of value in the rapid, non-invasive, high throughput and high content screening of potential therapeutic compounds directed at G protein-coupled receptors. These receptors form the most important target of commercially available therapeutic drugs at present. We thank Dr. I. Azpiazu for help with image processing and valuable discussions. We thank Dr. D.

We investigated the capability of retinal ganglion cells of synthesizing melatonin, a highly reliable circadian marker that regulates retinal physiology, as well as the capacity of these cells to function as autonomous circadian oscillators. Chick retinal ganglion cells presented higher levels of melatonin assessed by radioimmunoassay during both the subjective day in constant darkness and the light phase of a light-dark cycle. Similar changes were observed in mRNA levels and activity of arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase, a key enzyme in melatonin biosynthesis, with the highest levels of both parameters during the subjective day. These daily variations were preceded by the elevation of cyclic-AMP content, the second messenger involved in the regulation of melatonin biosynthesis. Moreover, cultures of immunopurified retinal ganglion cells at embryonic day 8 synchronized by medium exchange synthesized a [3H]melatonin-like indole from [3H]tryptophan. This [3H]indole was rapidly released to the culture medium and exhibited a daily variation, with levels peaking 8 h after synchronization, which declined a few hours later. Cultures of embryonic retinal ganglion cells also showed self-sustained daily rhythms in arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase mRNA expression during at least three cycles with a period near 24 h.

The issue of which cell type(s) are responsible for melatonin synthesis within the retina is still open. Several approaches have been used to attempt to answer this question. For example, melatonin levels were assessed after the destruction of the inner retina of Xenopus (9Cahill G.M. Besharse J.C. Neuron. 1993; 10: 573-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and chick (19Thomas K. Tigges M. Iuvone P.M. Brain Res. 1993; 601: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Since melatonin synthesis persisted after this treatment, it was suggested that it takes place in photoreceptors (PRCs). 1The abbreviations used are: PRC, photoreceptor cell; AA-NAT, arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase; DD, constant darkness; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RGC, retinal ganglion cell; eRGC, embryonic retinal ganglion cell; INL, inner nuclear layer; LD, light-dark; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RIA, radioimmunoassay; ZT, zeitgeber time; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ANOVA, analysis of variance; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate.1The abbreviations used are: PRC, photoreceptor cell; AA-NAT, arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase; DD, constant darkness; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RGC, retinal ganglion cell; eRGC, embryonic retinal ganglion cell; INL, inner nuclear layer; LD, light-dark; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RIA, radioimmunoassay; ZT, zeitgeber time; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ANOVA, analysis of variance; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. In addition, it has been shown that the specific activity of arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AA-NAT) increases in retinal cell cultures by treatments that augment the proportion of PRCs (20Iuvone P.M. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1562-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, available evidence supports the idea that circadian clocks located in PRCs drive retinal melatonin rhythms independently of the rest of the retina (9Cahill G.M. Besharse J.C. Neuron. 1993; 10: 573-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, the possibility that another retinal cell type(s) is also able to synthesize melatonin cannot be formally ruled out at present. PRCs and oscillators located in the pineal gland of nonmammalian vertebrates are both photoreceptive and capable of producing melatonin during the night (9Cahill G.M. Besharse J.C.

Neurochem. 2001; 76: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Excitatory amino acids such as glutamate have been shown to mediate the photic entrainment of circadian rhythms through the retinohypothalamic tract (29Rusak B. Bina K.G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1990; 13: 387-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 30Ginty D.D. Kornhauser J.M. Thompson M.A. Bading H. Mayo K.E. Takahashi J.S. Greenberg M.E.

Corbella de Guido L.B. Robertson H.A. Rusak B. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Glutamate has also been shown to participate in several functions related to retinal physiology, light responsiveness, and survival and growth of RGCs (33Greenberger L.M. Besharse J.C. J. Comp. Neurol. 1985; 239: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 34Meyer-Franke A. Kaplan M. Pfrieger F.W. Barres B.A. Neuron. 1995; 15: 805-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Here we investigated RGCs as autonomous circadian oscillators examining their capacity to synthesize methoxyindoles. These studies comprised in vivo and ex vivo experiments using RGCs isolated from other retinal cell types and from systemic regulators. In the present report, we demonstrate that 1) chick RGCs synthesize a melatonin-like methoxyindole in a rhythmic manner with levels peaking during the day, and 2) cultures of purified embryonic retinal ganglion cells (eRGCs) biosynthesize a [3H]melatonin-like methoxyindole from a radioactive precursor with a significant daily variation and show a circadian rhythm in the expression of AA-NAT, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of this compound. Animal Handling—Cobb Hardig chicks were reared from hatching until day 7 on a 12:12-h light-dark (LD) cycle, at ∼25 °C with food and water ad libitum. Then a group of animals remained under the LD cycle while the other was released to constant darkness (DD) for 48 h, and on day 10, they were killed at different zeitgeber times (ZTs) during the subjective day and night in the same illumination condition they came from (ZTs 0 and 12 correspond to the phases of the previous LD cycle, at which lights were turned on and off, respectively). Both eyes were dissected out, and the eye cups were rinsed twice in 4 ml of cold 0.25 m sucrose, immediately frozen in liquid N2, and lyophilized. For animals maintained in DD or killed during the dark phase of the LD cycle, handling was carried out in dim red light (<3 lux), and the whole procedure (from animal decapitation to freezing of the eye-cups in liquid N2 and lyophilization) did not take longer than 1 min. Animal handling was performed according to Ref. 100Canadian Council on Animal Care the Local Animal Care Committee at the National University of Córdoba Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals. School of Chemistry, UNC, Córdoba1999: 1-50Google Scholar. Preparation of PRCs and RGCs—Highly enriched preparations in PRCs and RGCs were obtained as previously described by Guido et al. (35Guido M.E. Bussolino D.F. de Arriba Zerpa G. Deza S. Pasquaré S. Giusto N.M. Caputto B.L. Brain Res. Protoc. 1999; 4: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, after lyophilization, each retina was glued to adhesive tape by the RGC layer (white color), and this layer was separated from the rest of the retina by attaching another piece of tape to the pigment epithelium surface, pressing, and removing the second piece of adhesive tape with a cell layer attached. Each time this procedure is repeated, a different retinal layer is obtained attached to the tape. The pigment epithelium (dark gray color) was removed on the first piece of tape, whereas the PRC layer (orange color) was obtained attached to the second and third tapes, and cells from the inner nuclear layer (INL) were removed on the fifth and sixth. Remaining cells from the PRC layer and INL obtained on the fourth and seventh tapes, respectively, were discarded. This procedure was repeated eight times with each retina until a preparation of RGC was obtained on the basal tape. Purification and Culture of eRGCs from Chicken Embryos—eRGCs were purified from embryonic day 8 neural retinas dissected in ice-cold Ca2+-Mg2+-free Tyrode's buffer containing 25 mm glucose according to Brocco and Panzetta (36Brocco M.A. Panzetta P. Dev. Brain Res. 1999; 118: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were trypsin-treated and rinsed with soybean trypsin inhibitor and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). After dissociation, the cell suspension from 30–60 retinas was poured into Petri dishes pretreated with 10 μg/ml protein A followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min with an anti-chicken Thy-1 polyclonal antibody raised in our laboratory (36Brocco M.A. Panzetta P. Dev. Brain Res. 1999; 118: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). After exhaustive washing, the remaining bound RGCs were harvested in DMEM and seeded on coverslips treated with polylysine and 5 μg/ml laminin. Characterization of harvested cells was performed by double immuno-staining with RGC markers, as previously described (36Brocco M.A. Panzetta P. Dev. Brain Res. 1999; 118: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 37Brocco M.A. Panzetta P. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 328: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were as follows: a BSJ-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for chicken Thy-1 (38French P.W. Jeffrey P.L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1986; 16: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), mAb 2G12 against rodent Thy-1 (39Barnstable C.J. Dräger U.C. Neuroscience. 1984; 1: 847-855Crossref Scopus (267) Google Scholar), mAb anti-GAP-43 (clone GAP-7B10, Sigma), and an anti-neurofilament of 200 kDa (IgG fraction of the antiserum) (Sigma). Primary antibodies were omitted as a control of labeling. The coverslips were transferred to Petri dishes, containing 2.5 ml of B27 (Invitrogen)-supplemented DMEM and incubated at 37 °C under constant 5% CO2-air flow in a humid atmosphere. The following day, cultures were synchronized by exchange with fresh B27-DMEM medium (time 0). At different times from 0 to 72 h, cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for in situ hybridization studies. All procedures involving egg handling, retina dissection, and immunopanning of eRGCs were performed under dim light, whereas the incubation of eRGC cultures was carried out in the dark in a proper CO2 incubator under the conditions stated above. For the experiments with glutamate, on day 1, eRGC cultures were fed at time 0 with 100 μl of glutamate (100 μm final concentration) or of vehicle (B27-DMEM), in the dark and without medium replacement during the following days. At different times from 0 to 60 h, cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde as described below for in situ hybridization. Chicken Thy-1 Purification and Antiserum Preparation—Preparation of anti-chicken Thy-1 serum was performed as previously described (36Brocco M.A. Panzetta P. Dev. Brain Res. 1999; 118: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, Thy-1 was purified from chicken brains at 4 °C in the presence of protease inhibitors. Brains were homogenized, and after removing nuclei and cellular debris, the supernatant was spun down to obtain the membranes. They were treated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C under continuous stirring. After spinning down, the supernatant was applied to a lentil lectin-Sepharose 4B column. The bound material was eluted with 1-methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside in 0.01 m Tris buffer. Fractions reacting with mAbs to Thy-1 were pooled, concentrated, and run in a PAGE. The 23-kDa bands reactive to mAbs to Thy-1 were used for raising antisera in two rabbits, injecting intramuscularly the purified chicken Thy-1 plus complete Freund's adjuvant. Injections in the same manner and dose were repeated a week later. After 3 weeks and thereafter every 4–6 weeks, the antigen in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)/incomplete Freund's adjuvant was injected. Bleedings were done 10 days after each boost, and the sera from each animal were pooled and heat-inactivated. Synthesis of a [3H]Melatonin-like Indole in eRGC Cultures after Incubation with l-[5-3H]Tryptophan—Immunopurified eRGCs cultured as described above were synchronized by exchange with 2 ml of fresh B27-DMEM medium (76.4 μm of tryptophan) at time 0 and fed 25 μCi/ml l-[5-3H]tryptophan (25 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) with a specific activity of 323 μCi/μmol for 8 h at different phases across a 24-h period. After the end of labeling, the culture medium was separated from the cells and transferred to glass tubes. Then cells were resuspended, and media were mixed with 0.1 m HCl and kept on ice until melatonin extraction was carried out as described under “Melatonin Assay.” Before extraction, aliquots from the cells were collected for protein quantification (40Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211840) Google Scholar). Blanks (medium without cells incubated with [3H]tryptophan or zero time point of incubation) were included to discard the nonenzymatic production of melatonin or any eventual contamination during the extraction. In all cases, blanks were subtracted from the total radioactivity measured, and they represented less than 10–15% of the total labeling. Results of [3H]melatonin-like indole are presented as ng/mg protein (Fig. 7 and Table I). To calculate ng of methoxyindole produced, it was considered that 1 mmol of [3H]tryptophan (specific activity 323 μCi/μmole) generates 1 mmol of [3H]melatonin (e.g. 710 dpm/mg protein = 1 × 10-9 mmol = 0.232 ng).Table IMelatonin levels and synthesis of a [3H]melatonin-like indole in RGCs Shown on the left are levels of melatonin in cells of RGC cultures at embryonic days 8 (E8) and 15 (E15) and in RGC preparations at postnatal day 10 (P10) during the light phase of the LD cycle, assessed by RIA. Data are mean ± S.E. (n = 3/group). Shown on the right is synthesis of [3H]melatonin in cultures of eRGCs immunopurified at E8. After 1 day of culture, cells were synchronized by medium exchange and fed [3H]tryptophan (25 μCi/ml) for 4, 8, and 12 h. A radiolabeled melatonin-like indole from the cells and culture medium was isolated as described under ′Experimental Procedures.′ Data are mean ± S.E. from three or four independent experiments, performed in duplicates.Melatonin levels[3H]Melatonin-like indoleDevelopmental ageMelatoninTime of labelingCellsMediumdayng/mg of proteinhng/mg of proteinE80.20 ± 0.0540.47 ± 0.062.70 ± 0.32E150.61 ± 0.0381.77 ± 0.214.90 ± 0.40P102.28 ± 0.21120.70 ± 0.086.50 ± 0.70 Open table in a new tab Melatonin Assay—Retinal preparations were homogenized in 0.1 m HCl and melatonin was extracted with 5 ml of dichloromethane and determined in each sample by radioimmunoassay (RIA) as previously described (41Faillace M.P. Keller-Sarmiento M.I. Nicola Siri L. Rosenstein R.E. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1995-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or by two-dimensional TLC (42Klein D.C. Ntides A. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 31: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The organic phase was washed twice with 2% NaHCO3 and distilled water. For the RIA, aliquots of the organic phase dried under vacuum were resuspended in 100 μl of buffer and mixed with [3H]melatonin (20,000–24,000 dpm; specific activity 38.8 Ci/mmol) and 50 μl of a rabbit antiserum developed in our laboratory. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, 250 μl of saturated (NH4)2SO4 were added, and samples centrifuged at 5000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Radioactivity present in antigen-antibody complexes was assessed in the water-resuspended pellet. Intra- and interassay coefficients of variations for the RIA were 5 and 10%, respectively. The limit of detection for melatonin by RIA was 20 pg. The antiserum utilized was obtained by using N-succinyl-5-methoxytryptamine as immunogen, bound to bovine serum albumin (kindly supplied by Dr. Bernhard Manz, Hamburg, Germany) The utilization of RIA for the assessment of melatonin levels in chicken retinas was validated in parallel studies in which serial dilutions of retinal extracts of samples from retinal layers yielded displacement curves that were parallel to standard melatonin curves. The possible interference of serotonin in the RIA was ruled out, since this indoleamine was retained in the alkaline aqueous phase during extraction, and the cross-reaction of the melatonin antiserum with serotonin was <0.4%. No significant interference was seen with 5-methoxytryptamine, 5-methoxytryptophol, N-acetyltryptamine, N-acetylserotonin, or 5-hydroxytryptophol after assessing three different concentrations (10, 100, and 500 nm) for each compound, but among them, only 5-methoxytryptophol competed with the binding of [3H]melatonin to the antiserum at the highest concentration (500 nm) with a displacement lower than 15%. In addition, N-acetylserotonin and N-acetyltryptamine did not significantly displace [3H]melatonin binding to the anti-melatonin antiserum used, competing less than 2.5 and 0.2%, respectively. For the TLC, the organic phases containing the [3H]mehtoxyindoles from the labeling experiments of eRGC cultures were dried under vacuum and resuspended in 50 μl of chloroform/methanol (9:1). [3H]Melatonin and other methoxyindoles were separated by two-dimensional TLC on silica gel 60-precoated plates with fluorescent indicator UV254 (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) and developed in the first direction with a solvent system composed of chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid (90:10:1 by volume) and in the second direction with ethyl acetate (42Klein D.C. Ntides A. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 31: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Standards of tryptophan, N-acetyltryptamine, N-acetylserotonin, methoxytriptophol, methoxyindole acetic, and melatonin were visualized by UV. The radioactivity in the areas corresponding to melatonin and tryptophan was assessed by scraping and counting in a liquid scintillation counter. cAMP Level Assessment—Each retinal cell preparation was homogenized in 1 ml of 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanteine and boiled for 2 min. Homogenates were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cyclic AMP content was measured in the supernatants by RIA after acetylation with acetic anhydride/triethylamine as previously described (41Faillace M.P. Keller-Sarmiento M.I. Nicola Siri L. Rosenstein R.E. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1995-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, the acetylated products were incubated overnight with 125I-labeled cyclic AMP (15,000–20,000 dpm, specific activity 140 mCi/mmol) and a rabbit antiserum at 4 °C. After adding 2 ml of ethanol with 2% bovine serum albumin, the antigen-antibody complexes were precipitated by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 30 min, supernatants were separated by aspiration, and radioactivity was determined. Intra- and interassay coefficients of variations for the RIA were 5 and 10%, respectively. The limit of detection of cAMP by RIA was 20 fmol. RNA Isolation and Northern Hybridization—Total RNA from the PRC and RGC preparations was extracted following the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (43Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Ann. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref Scopus (62897) Google Scholar) using the TRIzol™ kit for RNA isolation (Invitrogen). Finally, the RNA was resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and kept frozen at -70 °C. 25 μg of total RNA from each sample was separated by electrophoresis in formaldehyde-agarose gels and then blotted onto charged nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary transfer using 10× SSC. RNA was fixed onto the membrane by UV irradiation for 2 min. Membranes were prehybridized at 42 °C for 2–4 h in a solution containing 5× SSC, 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, 5× Denhardt's solution, 7% SDS, and 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for ∼24–36 h in the hybridization buffer (Sigma) containing 3 million cpm/ml of 32P-radiolabeled probe. After hybridization, the membranes were washed once with 2× SSC and 1% SDS at 50 °C for 30 min and twice with 1× SSC and 1% SDS at 50 °C for 30 min. Finally, blots were exposed to the phosphor image (Storm; Fuji) overnight or to a BioMax film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 7–14 days. The hybridization signals developed in the film or after exposure to the phosphor image screen were assessed by optical densitometry using Scion Image Software, and the signal generated by α-tubulin mRNA was used as an internal standard. In Situ Hybridization—For the retinal sections, the eyes excised from 10-day-old chickens kept 48 h in DD were fixed for 2 h in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, at 4 °C and immersed in 30% sucrose in PBS at 4 °C for 2–3 days until they sank. Retinas embedded in frozen embedding compound were cut on a cryostat to obtain 10–12-μm-thick transversal sections mounted onto polylysine-coated slides. Slides containing retinal sections of the whole retina, retinal preparations (PRCs or RGCs) attached to the Scotch tape, or wells containing coverslips seeded with the same number of cells from the eRGC cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS for 5 min and treated as previously described by Guido et al. (44Guido M.E. Goguen D.M. Corbella de Guido L.B. Robertson H.A. Rusak B. Neuroscience. 1999; 90: 555-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Each slide was covered with the hybridization solution containing the 35S-labeled probe (1 × 106 cpm/slide) and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humid chamber. After washing, the slides containing the retinal preparations (PRCs or RGCs) by the Scotch tape method were resuspended in prewarmed 1 m NaOH, and the protein content was measured by Bradford's method (40Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211840) Google Scholar). The radioactivity present in the retinal preparations or in the eRGC cultures was determined in a liquid scintillation counter and normalized by the protein content of PRC and RGC preparations or per well for the eRGC cultures. Retinal sections were dipped in Kodak NTB2 emulsion, exposed for 2–4 weeks, and developed. Tissue sections of the whole retina were examined by confocal microscopy (laser-scanning microscopy image; LSMS Pascal inverted; Zeiss; objective C-apochromat 20×). Images from each retinal slide were taken by confocal reflection microscopy of silver grains from the 35S autoradiograms for selected mRNA in situ hybridization and the corresponding bright field laser transmission image of the same section generated by eosin fluorescence after the histological counterstaining by eosin/hematoxylin. Probes—Synthetic oligonucleotides were labeled with [35S]dATP or [32P]dATP by the 3′ end deoxynucleotidyl transferase reaction for in situ or Northern blot hybridization, respectively. Prior to use, labeling probes were centrifuged through a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences).

We show here that staurosporine, a ubiquitous inducer of apoptosis in mammalian cells, stabilizes cellular Top1 cleavage complexes. These complexes are formed indirectly as staurosporine cannot induce Top1 cleavage complexes in normal DNA with recombinant Top1 or nuclear extract from normal cells. In treated cells, staurosporine produces oxidative DNA lesions and generates reactive oxygen species (ROS). Quenching of these ROS by the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine or inhibition of the mitochondrial dependent production of ROS by the caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD prevents staurosporine-induced Top1 cleavage complexes. Down-regulation of Top1 by small interfering RNA decreases staurosporine-induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation. We propose that Top1 cleavage complexes resulting from oxidative DNA lesions generated by ROS in staurosporine-treated cells contribute to the full apoptotic response.

However, at that time, the mechanism of formation of these complexes and their role in apoptosis remained incompletely investigated. Apoptosis, the death program of the cell, plays a crucial role for development and for adult homeostasis. Staurosporine, an alkaloid kinase inhibitor, is widely used to study the mechanisms of cell death because of its unique ability to induce apoptosis in a wide variety of mammalian cells (2Bertrand R. Solary E. O'Connor P. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism(s) by which staurosporine initiates apoptosis is still unclear, it is now apparent that staurosporine induces apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway (3Duan S. Hajek P.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2459-2466PubMed Google Scholar). Staurosporine increases the permeability of mitochondrial outer membrane, thereby allowing the release of proteins normally located in the space between the inner and the outer mitochondrial membranes (5Gallego M.A. Joseph B.

Sharpe J.C. Cecconi F. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4385-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Some of these molecules are involved in the activation of caspases (cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and HtrA2/Omi), and others in nuclear modifications (endonuclease G and apoptosis inducing factor) (7Green D.R. Kroemer G. Science. 2004; 305: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2831) Google Scholar). After cellular exposure to staurosporine, activated caspase-3 feeds back on permeabilized mitochondria, which further dissipates the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) and induces the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) (8Ricci J.E. Munoz-Pinedo C. Fitzgerald P. Bailly-Maitre B. Perkins G.A. Yadava N. Scheffler I.E. Ellisman M.H. Green D.R.

DNA Top1 is an ubiquitous and essential enzyme as it relaxes DNA supercoiling ahead of replication and transcription complexes (9Pommier Y. Redon C. Rao V.A. Seiler J.A. Sordet O. Takemura H.

DNA relaxation is because of the induction of transient single-strand breaks, thereby allowing rotation of the DNA double helix around the intact phosphodiester bonds opposite to the enzyme-mediated DNA cleavages. Once the DNA is relaxed, Top1 readily religates the break and regenerates intact duplex DNA. Under normal conditions, the covalent Top1-cleaved DNA intermediates, referred to as “cleavage complexes,” are transient and remain at very low levels; the DNA religation (“closing”) step is much faster than the DNA cleavage (“nicking”) step. Top1 cleavage complexes can be schematically produced by two main mechanisms. First, Top1 cleavage complexes can be trapped by specific inhibitors such as camptothecin and its chemotherapeutic derivatives. These anticancer drugs specifically bind at the Top1-DNA interface and trap the cleavage complexes by preventing the DNA religation step (12Staker B.L. Hjerrild K. Feese M.D. Behnke C.A.

The second mechanism is related to DNA lesions that interfere with DNA nicking-closing activities of Top1. These modifications include frequent lesions such as oxidized bases (e.g. 8-oxoguanine), abasic sites, mismatches, and strand breaks (15Pourquier P. Pilon A.A. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Sharma A.

Recently, Top1 cleavage complexes have been observed in cells undergoing apoptosis following treatment with arsenic trioxide (18Sordet O. Liao Z. Liu H. Antony S. Stevens E.V. Kohlhagen G. Fu H.

DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the present study, we describe the staurosporine-induced apoptotic Top1 cleavage complexes, and we report the mechanism of their production and functional relevance. We demonstrate that Top1 cleavage complexes are related to DNA modifications during staurosporine-induced apoptosis rather than resulting from a direct drug-Top1 interaction. Our results suggest that staurosporine-induced Top1 cleavage complexes form in response to oxidative DNA lesions generated by radical oxygen species (ROS) and caspase activation. Finally we provide evidence for the functional role of Top1-DNA complexes in chromatin fragmentation during staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Drugs and Chemical Reagents—Staurosporine (STP) and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) were obtained from Sigma; camptothecin (CPT) was obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, NCI (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda); and the caspase peptide inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-dl-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk) was from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Stock solutions for STP, CPT, and Z-VAD-fmk were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and stored at -20 °C. Further dilutions were made in culture medium just before use. The final concentration of Me2SO in culture medium never exceeded 0.1% (v/v), which was nontoxic to the cells. NAC was diluted in culture medium prior to use. [2-14C]Thymidine was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease-1 (Ape1) was obtained from Sigma, and Top1 and formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg) were prepared as described previously (17Pourquier P. Ueng L.-M. Fertala J.

Cell Culture—The human leukemia (CEM and HL-60) and colon carcinoma (HCT116) cell lines (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively. Culture mediums were supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, CA) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin). The murine leukemia cell line P388 and its camptothecin-resistant, Top1-deficient subline, P388/CPT45 (21Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Urasaki Y. Gioffre C. Kohlhagen G. Pommier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), were gifts from M. R. Mattern and R. K. Johnson (GlaxoSmithKline). Detection of Cellular Top1-DNA Complexes—Top1-DNA complexes were detected using the in vivo complex of enzyme bioassay (22Subramanian D. Kraut E. Staubus A. Young D.C. Muller M.T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2097-2103PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 106 cells were lysed in 1% Sarkosyl and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. Cell lysate was layered on cesium chloride step gradients and centrifuged at 165,000 × g for 20 h at 20 °C. Twenty fractions (0.5 ml each) were collected from the bottom, diluted into an equal volume of 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.6, and applied to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, MA) by using a slot-blot vacuum manifold. Top1-DNA complexes were detected by immunoblotting using the C21 Top1 mouse monoclonal antibody (a kind gift from Dr. Yung-Chi Cheng, Yale University, New Haven, CT). Top1 Cleavage Complexes with Recombinant Top1 and Nuclear Extracts—3′-End-labeled DNA fragments were incubated with Top1 (17Pourquier P. Ueng L.-M. Fertala J. Wang D. Park H.-J. Essigman J.M.

Pommier Y. Blood. 1993; 81: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA fragments resulting from Top1 cleavage were separated by PAGE and visualized by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Detection of Oxidative DNA Lesions—CEM cells were labeled with [2-14C]thymidine (0.04 μCi/ml) for 24 h and chased for 12 h in radioisotope-free medium. After drug treatment, cells were permeabilized in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 70 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.05% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 15 min by gentle mixing. Fpg (100 ng/100-μl reactions) was added for 30 min at 25 °C, and DNA breaks were analyzed by alkaline elution as described previously (24Kohn K.W. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In Vitro Chromatin Digestion Assay—Nuclei were isolated from HL-60 cells as described previously (25Yoshida A. Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2576-2582PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclei (7 × 106) were resuspended in STKM buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 25 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2) and mixed with purified Ape1 (30 units) in the presence of 1 mm dithiothreitol. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. DNA was extracted by standard phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction procedures and analyzed by 1.3% agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA Fragmentation Assays—DNA fragmentation-related apoptosis was quantified by using the previously reported filter elution assay (26Bertrand R. Kohn K.W. Solary E. Pommier Y. Drug Dev. Res. 1995; 34: 138-144Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with [2-14C]thymidine (0.02 μCi/ml) for 2 days and chased overnight in radioisotope-free medium. After drug treatment, cells were loaded onto a protein-absorbing filter (Metricel® Membrane Filter, 0.8-μm pore size, 25 mm diameter; Pall Corp.), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 0.2% sodium Sarkosyl, 2 m NaCl, 0.04 m EDTA, pH 10.0. The filters were then washed with 0.02 m EDTA, pH 10.0. DNA was depurinated by incubation of filters in 1 m HCl at 65 °C and then released from the filters with 0.4 m NaOH at room temperature. Radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry in each fraction (wash, lysis, EDTA wash, and filter). DNA fragmentation was measured as the fraction of disintegrations/min in the lysis fraction plus EDTA wash relative to the total intracellular disintegrations/min. For sub-G1 analysis, DNA content was assessed by staining ethanol-fixed cells with propidium iodide and monitoring by FACScan (BD Biosciences). The number of cells with sub-G1 DNA were determined with a CellQuest program (BD Biosciences). Caspase-3 Activity—Caspase-3 activity was measured as described (27Sordet O. Rebe C. Plenchette S. Zermati Y. Hermine O. Vainchenker W. Garrido C. Solary E. Dubrez-Daloz L. Blood. 2002; 100: 4446-4453Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). Twenty micrograms of protein from the resulting supernatant was incubated in buffer assay (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% glycerol, 20 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of 100 μm of the fluorogenic peptide substrate Z-DEVD-AFC (Calbiochem). 7-Amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (AFC) released from the substrate was excited at 400 nm to measure emission at 505 nm. Fluorescence was monitored continuously at 37 °C for 20 min in a dual luminescence fluorimeter (SPECTRAmax® GEMINI XS, Molecular Devices). Enzyme activities were determined as initial velocities expressed as relative intensity/min/mg. Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed at 4 °C in buffer containing 1% SDS, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Diagnostics). Viscosity of the samples was reduced by brief sonication, and 20 μg of protein (Bio-Rad Protein Assay) were incubated in loading buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 4.6% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.003% bromphenol blue), separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, MA). After blocking nonspecific binding sites for 1 h by 0.2% casein in TPBS (phosphate-buffered saline, Tween 20 0.1%), the membrane was incubated for 2 h with primary antibody. Antibodies used include rabbit antihuman poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP; Roche Applied Science) (1:5,000 dilution) and mouse antihuman Top1 (clone C21) (1:1,000 dilution). After three washes in TPBS, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:20,000 dilution) or anti-mouse (1:5,000 dilution) antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h and then washed three times in TPBS. Immunoblot was revealed using enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce) by autoradiography. ROS Detection—Cells were exposed to 0.5 μm H2DCF-DA (Molecular Probes) for 5 min and then examined by phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy. All photomicrographs were taken at equal magnification (×20) and exposure times. Quantification of DCF fluorescence was determined with the Adobe Photoshop program and expressed as relative fluorescence intensity/cell. Top1 Silencing by RNA Interference—Top1 was silenced in HCT116 cells by the transfection of U6 promoter-driven DNA vectors stably expressing small interfering RNA (siRNA) hairpins targeting human Top1 (cDNA sequence, 5′-CTT GAC AGC CAA GGT ATT C-3′) or a negative control sequence (cDNA sequence, 5′-GCG TCC TTT CCA CAA GAT A-3′) as described (18Sordet O. Liao Z. Liu H. Antony S. Stevens E.V. Kohlhagen G. Fu H. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33968-33975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Staurosporine Induces Top1-DNA Complexes in Cells Undergoing Apoptosis—The presence of Top1-DNA complexes in genomic DNA can be detected after cesium chloride gradient centrifugation and fractionation from tissue culture cells or tumor samples (22Subramanian D. Kraut E. Staubus A. Young D.C. Muller M.T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2097-2103PubMed Google Scholar). In staurosporine-treated leukemia CEM cells, immunoblotting revealed the presence of Top1 in the DNA-containing fractions (fractions 7–10) (Fig. 1A). Unlike the Top1 inhibitor camptothecin, staurosporine was not able to generate Top1 cleavage complexes in normal DNA in the presence of recombinant human Top1 (Fig. 1B), indicating that staurosporine does not directly poison Top1. Cellular Top1-DNA complexes are therefore likely to be secondary to intracellular modifications induced by staurosporine. Given that staurosporine is a potent inducer of apoptosis, we tested whether the cellular Top1-DNA complexes resulted from the engagement of apoptotic pathway(s). In CEM cells, staurosporine induces detectable Top1-DNA complexes after 3 h (Fig. 2A), concomitantly with DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2B), and activation of caspases, which was demonstrated by the ability of cell lysates to cleave DEVD-AFC, a fluorogenic peptide substrate for caspase-3 and closely related caspases (Fig. 2C, top panel). Caspase activation was further confirmed by the caspase-dependent cleavage of PARP (Fig. 2C, bottom panel). Staurosporine-induced Top1-DNA complexes were also observed in the human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 2, D–F) and in human leukemia HL-60 cells (supplemental Fig. 2). Thus, the induction of Top1-DNA complexes by staurosporine can be observed in different human cell types as they undergo apoptosis. Staurosporine Induces Oxidative DNA Lesions—Because Top1 cleavage complexes can be produced by oxidative DNA lesions such as oxidized bases, abasic sites, and strand breaks (15Pourquier P. Pilon A.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8516-8523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), we investigated the generation of such lesions by staurosporine. Permeabilized CEM cells were exposed to purified formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg), an enzyme that converts oxidized purines (e.g. 8-oxoguanine) into DNA single-strand breaks (20Sutherland B.M. Bennett P.V. Sidorkina O. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). By using the alkaline elution assay (24Kohn K.W. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we observed that Fpg induced single-strand breaks in staurosporine-treated cells (Fig. 3A), indicating the presence of oxidative base damage. We also tested base damage in staurosporine-treated cells using recombinant apurinic endonuclease 1 (Ape1) that cleaves DNA adjacent to abasic sites (28Fan Z. Beresford P.J. Zhang D. Xu Z. Novina C.D. Yoshida A. Pommier Y. Lieberman J. Nat. Immun. 2003; 4: 145-153Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). As visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis, Ape1 induced chromatin fragmentation in nuclei from staurosporine-treated cells (Fig. 3B). Nuclear extracts from staurosporine-treated cells failed to cleave a normal duplex oligonucleotide containing a canonical Top1 cleavage site (29Bonven B.J. Gocke E. Westergaard O. Cell. 1985; 41: 541-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C), indicating that the effect of staurosporine is not on Top1 itself. Inhibition of ROS Prevents Apoptotic Top1-DNA Complexes—To further investigate whether apoptotic Top1-DNA complexes result from oxidative DNA lesions, we used 2′,7′-dichlorohydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA) to detect intracellular H2O2 and other peroxides (30LeBel C.P. Ischiropoulos H. Bondy S.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). Fluorescence microcopy showed that staurosporine increased ROS levels in CEM cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Then we investigated whether inhibition of ROS levels would affect the generation of Top1-DNA complexes. Treatment of CEM cells with the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) together with staurosporine prevented both staurosporine-induced ROS production (Fig. 4, A and B) and Top1-DNA complexes (Fig. 4C). Caspases have been involved recently in the production of ROS by staurosporine (8Ricci J.E. Munoz-Pinedo C. Fitzgerald P. Bailly-Maitre B. Perkins G.A. Yadava N. Scheffler I.E. Ellisman M.H. Green D.R. Cell. 2004; 117: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Consistently, inhibition of caspases by the peptide Z-VAD-fmk prevented staurosporine-induced ROS production (Fig. 4, A and B). Under these conditions, Z-VAD-fmk also prevented the formation of Top1-DNA complexes (Fig. 4C). Altogether, these findings support the hypothesis linking oxidative DNA damage with Top1-DNA complexes during apoptosis. Apoptotic Top1-DNA Complexes Contribute to DNA Fragmentation—As shown in Fig. 5A, NAC prevents apoptotic DNA fragmentation in staurosporine-treated CEM cells. To evaluate further its involvement in chromatin fragmentation during apoptosis, Top1 was down-regulated by siRNA hairpins targeting human Top1 (Fig. 5B). Top1 silencing reduced staurosporine-induced DNA fragmentation in HCT116 cells (Fig. 5C). Similar results were observed with another siRNA hairpin sequence targeting Top1 (supplemental Fig. 5). Apoptotic DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5D) and internucleosomal DNA laddering (Fig. 5E) were also reduced in P388/CPT45 cells deficient for Top1 (31Mattern M.R. Hofman G.A. Polsky R.M. Funk L.R. McCabe F.L. Johnson R.K. Oncol. Res. 1993; 5: 467-474PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest the contribution of Top1 cleavage complexes to apoptotic DNA fragmentation. This study reports the formation of Top1 cleavage complexes by staurosporine, a ubiquitous inducer of apoptosis in mammalian cells. These apoptotic Top1 cleavage complexes were observed in three human cell lines (two leukemia cell lines, CEM and HL-60, and one colon carcinoma cell line, HCT116) undergoing apoptosis. Staurosporine is a protein kinase inhibitor (32Tainton K.M. Ruefli A.A. Smyth M.J. Johnstone R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 16: 231-237Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) that cannot induce Top1 cleavage complexes in normal DNA in the presence of recombinant Top1 or nuclear extracts from normal cells (Figs. 1 and 3). Thus, the mechanism of formation of the apoptotic Top1 complexes induced by staurosporine is indirect rather than resulting from drug-Top1 interaction. We have observed that oxidative DNA lesions occur during staurosporine-induced apoptosis likely as a result of ROS production (Figs. 3 and 4), and we propose that staurosporine-induced apoptotic Top1 cleavage complexes result from these DNA modifications. Consistently, quenching of ROS with the antioxidant NAC prevents staurosporine-induced Top1 cleavage complexes (Fig. 4). Similarly, arsenic trioxide induces oxidative DNA lesions (33Kessel M. Liu S.X. Xu A. Santella R. Hei T.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 234: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and apoptotic Top1 cleavage complexes (18Sordet O. Liao Z. Liu H. Antony S. Stevens E.V. Kohlhagen G. Fu H. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33968-33975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), suggesting that the ROS-dependent formation of oxidative DNA lesions is a common mechanism for the trapping of Top1 cleavage complexes during apoptosis (34Sordet O.

In fact, cellular exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was recently shown to induce Top1 cleavage complexes (35Daroui P. Desai S.D. Li T.K. Liu A.A. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14587-14594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus we propose that staurosporine induces the generation of ROS that damage DNA (oxidized bases and abasic sites), thereby generating Top1 cleavage complexes in apoptotic cells (Fig. 6). It is also possible that some of the DNA breaks produced by apoptotic nucleases such as DFF40/CAD (36Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar), endonuclease G (37Li L.Y. Luo X. Wang X. Nature. 2001; 412: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar), or Ape1 (38Yoshida A. Urasaki Y. Waltham M. Bergman A.C. Pourquier P. Rothwell D.G. Inuzuka M. Weinstein J.N. Ueda T. Appella E.

Cellular exposure to staurosporine induces mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (3Duan S. Hajek P. Lin C. Shin S.K. Attardi G. Chomyn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1346-1353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which is followed by the release of cytochrome c and the downstream activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 (6Arnoult D. Gaume B. Karbowski M. Sharpe J.C. Cecconi F. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4385-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Activated caspase-3 was recently shown to feed back on permeabilized mitochondria and cleave the 75-kDa subunit (NDUFS1) of complex I, which leads to a disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) and the production of ROS (8Ricci J.E. Munoz-Pinedo C. Fitzgerald P. Bailly-Maitre B. Perkins G.A. Yadava N. Scheffler I.E. Ellisman M.H. Green D.R. Cell. 2004; 117: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial production of ROS is likely to contribute to Top1 cleavage complex formation because caspase inhibition by Z-VAD-fmk inhibits staurosporine-induced ROS and Top1 cleavage complexes (Fig. 4). Activation of caspases could therefore serve to generate ROS that lead to Top1 cleavage complexes during staurosporine-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6). Apoptotic Top1 cleavage complexes probably contribute functionally to apoptosis as silencing of Top1 (Fig. 5B) reduces apoptotic DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5C). Also, Top1-deficient cells (P388/CPT45) exhibit less staurosporine-induced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5D) and internucleosomal DNA laddering (Fig. 5E) than the parental cells (P388). These results should be interpreted with caution because P388/CPT45 cells were selected by continuous exposure to camptothecin (31Mattern M.R. Hofman G.A. Polsky R.M. Funk L.R. McCabe F.L. Johnson R.K. Oncol. Res. 1993; 5: 467-474PubMed Google Scholar), and other molecular changes within the apoptotic pathway may contribute to apoptotic defects in camptothecin-resistant cells (39Reinhold W.C. Kouros-Mehr H. Kohn K.W. Maunakea A.K. Lababidi S. Roschke A. Stover K. Alexander J. Pantazis P. Miller L. Liu E. Kirsch I.R. Urasaki Y. Pommier Y. Weinstein J.N. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1000-1011PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, our findings raise the possibility that Top1, which is abundant and ubiquitous in mammalian cells, could participate in apoptosis by directly generating DNA strand breaks. Like apoptotic endonucleases, Top1 is nonessential for apoptosis because Top1 silencing reduces but does not abrogate chromatin DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5C). However, the redundancy and the nonlinearity of endonuclease activation during apoptosis might have evolved to confer a robust pathway ensuring that deficiency in one of the apoptotic nuclease is not sufficient to abrogate DNA fragmentation. Top1-DNA complexes could also engage the apoptotic machinery in trans as trapping of Top1 by camptothecins is among the most efficient inducers of apoptosis (40Sordet O. Khan Q. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Curr. Med. Chem. Anticancer Agents. 2003; 3: 271-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Apoptotic Top1-DNA complexes could therefore serve to amplify the apoptotic process engaged by staurosporine (see Fig. 6), as well as other agents including arsenic trioxide (18Sordet O. Liao Z.

However, in contrast to tumor invasion of a host tissue, trophoblastic invasion during implantation is strictly regulated, temporospatially. Factors responsible for these important regulatory processes are presently unknown; however, studies indicate that cytokines and growth factors represent in the peri-implantation uterine milieu as the possible candidates. In this study we investigated the role of interleukin (IL) 12 in regulating trophoblast invasion and the expression of trophoblast proteases (matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and urokinase-type plasminogen activators) and their inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of metalloprotease (TIMP) 1, TIMP-2, and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1) using an in vitro tissue culture system of human choriocarcinoma cell line JEG-3. Our major findings show an anti-invasive role of IL-12, associated with an inhibitory effect on the proteases but with an opposite up-regulating influence on the protease inhibitor, TIMP-1, whereas TIMP-2 and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 remained unaltered. Stimulation of JEG-3 cells with IL-12 also induced interferon (IFN)-γ production, which when neutralized using a monoclonal anti-IFN-γ antibody, F12, abrogates its ability to down-regulate the MMPs. IL-12 also mediates an IFN-γ-dependent up-regulation of E-cadherin, thereby implying that alteration in cell-cell adhesion besides regulating the proteases and the inhibitors possibly contributes to the observed anti-invasive role of this cytokine. TIMP-1, although stimulated by IL-12, was found to be unaltered by antibody F12, thereby implying a possibility of an IL-12-dependent-IFN-γ independent regulation. These findings thereby suggest an important role of IL-12 in modulation of trophoblast proteases and their inhibitors besides regulating cell-cell interactions and invasion during implantation, with far reaching possibilities for understanding the mechanism(s) and regulations of invasion and metastasis.

Implantation is an excellent example of successive interactions between two dissimilar tissues, the receptive uterus and the developing blastocyst, each genetically distinct from the other. This two-way interaction is largely mediated by the intimate contact between the uterine luminal epithelium and the outermost polarized epithelial cells of the blastocyst, the trophoblast. Trophoblast cells are instrumental during implantation and placentation both in terms of molecular recognition and cross-talk at the feto-maternal interface as well as a repository of variety of cytokines and growth factors that influence both the conceptus and the maternal physiology in an autocrine, paracrine, or juxtacrine manner (1Petraglia F. Santuz M. Florio P. Simoncini T. Luisi S. Plaino L. Genazzani A.R. Genazzani A.D. Volpe A. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1998; 39: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 2Cross J.C. Werb Z. Fisher S.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). This represents a highly complex but coordinated process involving the participation of different trophoblast cell populations with specific functions (3Lala P.K. Hamilton G.S. Placenta. 1996; 17: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 4Chakraborty C. Gleeson L.M. McKinnon T. Lala P.K. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2002; 80: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The interaction begins as the blastocyst enters the uterine lumen and becomes apposed to the uterine epithelium with its trophoblast cells penetrating deeper into the endometrium. The basic hurdle encountered by the invading trophoblasts is the maternal extracellular matrix through which it has to migrate. This hurdle is overcome by the spectacular process of trophoblast invasion, similar to that of cancer invasion (5Soundararajan R. Rao A.J. Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol. 2004; 2: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 6Gao F. Chen X. Wei P. Gao H.J. Liu Y.X. Endocrine. 2001; 16: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) except that it is highly regulated and, thus, is often called pseudo-malignant. A number of metalloproteases and serine proteases has been associated with this invasive process, the proteolytic activity of which eventually contributes to the digestion of the maternal extracellular matrix by the trophoblast cells (7Karmakar S. Das C. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2002; 48: 210-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 8Isaka K. Usuda S. Ito H. Sagawa Y. Nakamura H. Nishi H. Suzuki Y. Li Y.F. Takayama M.

The tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs), TIMP-1 for MMP-9 and TIMP-2 for MMP-2, act as natural inhibitors, counteracting these metalloproteases (13Lambert E. Dasse E. Haye B. Petitfrere E. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2004; 49: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), whereas the plasminogen activator inhibitors, PAI-1 and PAI-2, inhibit uPA (14Durand M.K. Bodker J.S. Christensen A. Dupont D.M. Hansen M. Jensen J.K. Kjelgaard S. Mathiasen L. Pedersen K.E. Skeldal S. Wind T. Andreasen P.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 91: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Trophoblast invasion is spectacular, as it is tempo spatially regulated and, thus, clearly requires the participation of both the proteases as well their inhibitors (15Bischof P. Meisser A. Campana A. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2002; 55: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) in an appropriate stoichiometric amount, as too little or an excess of invasion can both result into pregnancy abnormalities like preeclampsia or choriocarcinoma.As mentioned before, successful implantation is the final outcome of an innumerable sequel of events orchestrated by the synchronized co-ordination between the fetal and maternal components involving the participation of a large number of cytokines, growth factors, hormones, lipid mediators, and local acting substances (16Dey S.K. Lim H. Das S.K. Reese J. Paria B.C. Daikoku T. Wang H. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 341-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar).IL-12 is a heterodimeric cytokine produced by antigen-presenting cells, phagocytes, and granulocytes (17Trinchieri G. Nat. Rev.

Despite few recognized direct effects on T-lymphocytes and NK cells, where it acts as a growth factor and an enhancer of cytotoxicity and activator of other cytokines, its in vivo action is possibly mediated through (interferon γ) IFN-γ (21Brunda M.J.

IL-12 has been tested in clinical trials in curing neoplasias and has been found to improve the survival of mice bearing a great variety of tumors (22Tannenbaum C.S. Wicker N. Armstrong D. Tubbs R. Finke J. Bukowski R.M. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 693-699PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tannenbaum C.S. Tubbs R. Armstrong D. Finke J.H. Bukowski R.M. Hamilton T.A. J.

Based upon these observations, we aimed to investigate the role of IL-12 on trophoblast invasion in terms of regulation of proteases (MMPs and uPA), protease inhibitors (TIMPs and PAI-1), and cell-matrix interactions using an in vitro tissue culture system of JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells due to its similarity in the expression profile of these proteases and their inhibitors to that of the first trimester extra villous trophoblast cells (7Karmakar S. Das C. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2002; 48: 210-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Use of JEG-3 cells in this study is also justified by the fact that several investigators have similarly used the same model system to study the various aspects of trophoblast invasion (25Kliman H.J.

Mouse monoclonal antihuman IFN-γ neutralizing antibody, F12, was procured from Abcam Ltd., Cambridge Science, Cambridge, UK. Polyclonal goat anti-human MMP-2, MMP-9, uPA, and PAI-1 and polyclonal rabbit antihuman TIMP-1 and -2 and E-cadherin were all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA. A secondary antibody system used for immunocytochemistry, the Universal LSAB kit, was procured from DAKO Laboratories, Glostrup, Denmark; 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cell proliferation assay kit was from Roche Applied Science. Dual luciferase reporter assay system, TransFast transfection reagent (Lipofectamine), and pGL-2 basic vector were all obtained from Promega, Madison, WI. Matrigel invasion chamber was from Biocoat, BD Biosciences. TRIzol reagent for RNA extraction was from Invitrogen. PCR primers were obtained from Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland with the remaining PCR chemicals from Promega. The gel purification kit was purchased from Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany. Tissue culture materials (fetal calf serum and Ham's F-12 media) were obtained from Invitrogen, and sterile plastic ware was from Corning-Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA. All other chemicals were from Sigma and were all of analytical grade.Cell Line—Human choriocarcinoma cell line, JEG-3, was procured from American Type Culture Collection (Parkville, MA). These were expanded in tissue culture flasks in F-12 media containing 10% fetal calf serum and the antibiotic/antimycotic solutions and maintained at 37 °C in a sterile humid atmosphere under 5% CO2 and 95% O2.Cytokine Challenge—Recombinant human IL-12 was used at concentrations of 200, 500, and 1000 pg/ml for 12 h. Recombinant human IFN-γ (rhIFN-γ) was used at a concentration of 500 units/ml. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay confirmed that the two cytokines used at the above-mentioned concentrations did not compromise with the viability of the cell (data not shown).Expression Vectors and Reporters—A 1716-bp (–1659 to +57 bp) promoter fragment of human MMP-2 (a gift from Sun Yi, Department of Molecular Biology, Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research, Ann Arbor, Michigan, MI) was excised from the pGEM-3Z vector by cleaving with Hind III and Kpn1 restriction enzymes. This was then gel-purified (Nucleo Spin extract) and cloned upstream to the pGL2 basic promoter less vector. A human MMP-9 promoter region of 689 bp (–670 to +19) and a human TIMP-1 promoter region (1718 bp) was also PCR-amplified and inserted upstream to the pGL2 basic vector.Transient Transfection and Reporter Gene Assay—JEG-3 cells plated in 12-well Transwells were incubated at 37 °C till 60–70% confluency. 2 μg each of the reporter vectors, MMP-2 promoter reporter construct (pMMP2-Luc), MMP-9 promoter reporter construct (pMMP9-Luc), or TIMP-1 promoter reporter construct (pTIMP1-Luc) were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, cells were incubated in serum- and antibiotic-free F-12 media with or without IL-12 or IFN-γ for 48 h and harvested, and a luciferase assay performed using a Sirius Luminometer V2.2 (Sirius Berthold detection system) with a measurement time of 10 s. Renilla luciferase activity was measured after quenching the light with Stop and Glow reagent. Luciferase values are the mean ± S.E. of four replicate wells represented by three independent experiments. The results were expressed as fold luciferase activity (relative light units) (0.5 μg of pRLSV40 control vector was also co transfected for normalization of the transfection efficiency).RNA Isolation and Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Cells from culture wells were harvested in TRIzol reagent following the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was prepared when 5 μg of the total RNA was reverse-transcribed as described earlier (7Karmakar S. Das C. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2002; 48: 210-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). 2 μl of cDNA prepared were then processed for PCR using deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 10× PCR buffer containing 1.5 mm MgCl2,Taq DNA polymerase (5 units/μl) and molecule-specific primers. IFN-γ (forward primer, 5′-TGA CCA GAG CAT CCA AAG A-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CTG ACT CCT TGT TTC-GCT TCC-3′; amplicon size, 214 bp; annealing temperature, 60 °C). The primer sequence and PCR conditions for MMP-2, MMP-9, uPA, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, PAI-1 and -2, E-cadherin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were followed as described earlier (7Karmakar S. Das C. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2002; 48: 210-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 30Shimonovitz S. Hurwitz A. Dushnik M. Anteby E. Eldar T. Yagel S. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1994; 171: 832-838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) in an Eppendorf Master cycler gradient PCR machine (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The cycle number (n = 30) was adjusted so that all reactions fell within the linear range of amplification. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is used as an internal standard as it is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues, and its expression was found to be unaltered after the cytokine challenge (data not shown). PCR products (amplicons) were analyzed using the Bio-Rad Quantity One program, and the specificity of bands was verified by sequencing (data not shown). To further establish the RT-PCR results, protein expression and localization studies were undertaken to get insight into the cytokine-mediated translational regulation of the above molecules.Immunocytochemistry—JEG-3 cells plated on coverslips at an initial density of 3 × 105 and grown till 70% confluence were challenged with IL-12 (500 pg/ml) for 12 h and processed for immunolocalization of MMPs and TIMPs after paraformaldehyde fixation (4% for 2 h at 4 °C) following the procedure as described earlier (31Barber A. Robson S.C. Myatt L. Bulmer J.N. Lyall F. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1158-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Primary antibodies, goat anti-human 1:200 (MMP-2, MMP-9, uPA, and PAI-1) and rabbit antihuman (TIMP-1 and -2) were used, and non-immune goat or rabbit serum used in the place of primary antibody served as the negative control. Proteins were immunolocalized after incubation with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature and were then visualized using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine hydrochloride, counterstained with Meyers hematoxylin (Sigma).Flow Cytometric Assessment—Fluorescence-activated cell sorter was used to quantitate the intracellular level of proteases and their inhibitors after IL-12 (500 pg/ml) challenge. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary Ab was used to label the proteins under study, the mean fluorescence was recorded using Coulter Counter, and the results were analyzed using Win MDI 2.8 Software.Zymography—Substrate gel zymography for the gelatinases (gelatin) and uPA (casein) were carried out to demonstrate the presence of gelatinolytic metalloproteases and caseinolytic serine protease uPA from JEG-3-conditioned media (7Karmakar S. Das C. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2002; 48: 210-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To further confirm that the gelatin-degrading activities in the conditioned media were indeed due to metalloproteases, gels were incubated in reacting buffer containing metalloprotease inhibitor, EDTA (1–5 mm). For casein zymography, gels were incubated with serine protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, for 1 h at 37 °C, and electrophoresis was performed as described above (data not shown).MMP and uPA Activity Assay—Activity assay were performed to further quantitate the above zymography findings. MMP activity assay was performed using the MMP substrate (7-methylcoumarin-4 acetyl-Pro-Leu-β-(2,4-dinitrophenylamino)-Ala-Ala-Arg amide). Briefly, culture spent media with or without IL-12 challenge (500 and 1000 pg/ml) was mixed with the MMP substrate and incubated at 37 °C followed by measurement of fluorescence intensity at 325-nm excitation and 395-nm emission.Urokinase activity was similarly estimated in conditioned media by a direct chromogenic assay using substrate S-2444 (Chromogenix, MoIndal, Sweden) in a reaction that does not involve plasmin formation from plasminogen (32Yagel S. Geva T.E. Solomon H. Shimonovitz S. Reich R. Yeheskel Z.F. Mayer M. Milwidsky A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 77: 1506-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), following the manufacturer's instruction. Final absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Furthermore, Matrigel invasion assay was performed to correlate the functional implications of MMP and uPA activities in terms of cellular invasion.Matrigel Invasion Assay; Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Crystal Violet Staining, and Cell Migration Assay—Matrigel-coated porous filters (8-μm pore size) in a 12-well format were used as a barrier in a Boyden chamber (33Albini A.

Placenta. 1998; 19: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) to assess the extent of invasion by JEG-3 cells. Cells at an initial density of 2 × 105 (in F-12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) were plated into the inserts and maintained in culture in the presence of IL-12 (500 pg/ml) or IFN-γ (500 units/ml) for 12 h. Membranes were then cut and removed from their insert housings and fixed in Karnovsky's fixative (4% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde for 6 h) along with the removal of non-invasive cells from the upper chamber using a cotton swab. The bottom surface containing the invaded cells were then processed by SEM (LEO 435 VP; Leo Electron Microscopy Ltd., Cambridge, England) or stained with crystal violet for calculating the invasion index.For crystal violet staining (34Carmen G. Rieppi M. Borsotti P. Innocenti S. Ceruti R. Drudis T. Scanziani E. Casazza A.M. Taraboletti G. Giavazzi R. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 3603-3607PubMed Google Scholar), membranes were stained with 0.5% crystal violet (in 20% methanol) for 5 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and visualized under an optical microscope using a drop of immersion oil on the membrane at 100× magnification, or the migratory cells attached to the bottom of the membrane were stained with 0.1% crystal violet in 0.1 m borate, pH 9, and 2% ethanol for 15 min at room temperature. The stained cells were extracted using extraction buffer (Dispase, BD Biosciences), and the number of invaded cells per membrane was determined by absorbance at 550 nm.Invasion index was expressed as the number of cells invading through the Matrigel “test membrane” relative to the invasion through the “control membrane.” Cellular invasion is the final outcome of large number of processes, involving broadly, cell-cell, and cell-matrix interactions, associated with cellular motility. Wound healing and cell-cell adhesion assays were further performed to study the intercellular interactions and cellular motility involved during invasion.Cell Motility Assay; Wound Healing Assay—Wound healing assay was performed to study the effect of IL-12 (500 pg/ml) on JEG-3 cell motility, following the procedure as mentioned earlier (35Shih Ie-M Hsu M.Y. Oldt III, R.J. Herlyn M. Gearhart J.D. Kurman R.J. Placenta. 2002; 23: 706-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Cells seeded in equal number into six well plates were grown till 70% confluence, scrapped with a sterile tip to create an artificial wound, and allowed to heal for the next 36 h. The number of individual cells in the wound was quantitated as an average from six independent fields under the microscope (Nikon Microphot FXA) at 100× magnification and expressed as percentage motility under the cytokine influence.Cell-Cell Adhesion Assay—JEG-3 cells in 24-well plates were grown till 100% confluency. Another lot of JEG-3 cells were labeled with [H3]thymidine overnight and trypsinized. Radiolabeled cells were then re-suspended in F-12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and added to the unlabeled, attached confluent cells. After 2 h on incubation, non-adherent cells were collected, and plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and collected in the same container. Bound cells were then trypsinized and collected in a separate container. Radioactivity was measured by a β-counter (Wallac), and the percentage of adherent cells was counted. A Western blot was further performed to elucidate the role of E-cadherin as a possible mediator of intercellular adhesion during invasion and motility.Western Blot—JEG-3 cells were gently removed from the culture flask by scrapping and washed with 0.01 m phosphate-buffered saline, and proteins were extracted using radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture. Western blot was performed with the supernatant (50 μg of total protein) obtained by centrifuging the lysate at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C following the procedure as described before (31Barber A. Robson S.C. Myatt L. Bulmer J.N. Lyall F. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1158-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) using a 1:200-diluted primary antibody for E-cadherin (200 μg/ml IgG). Bands were visualized using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine hydrochloride as chromogen (enhanced by nickel). Although E-cadherin protein expression was quantitated by Western blot, its actual cellular localization was only confirmed using confocal laser microscopy.Confocal Laser Microscopy—JEG-3 cells grown on coverslips till 70% confluency were challenged with IL-12 (500 pg/ml) or IFN-γ (500 units/ml) and incubated for the next 12 h under culture conditions. After incubation, cells were washed with 0.01 m phosphate-buffered saline and processed for confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad) for immunolocalization of E-cadherin using biotinylated secondary antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated avidin (Calbiochem-Novabiochem). Nuclei were counterstained with propidium iodide.IFN-γ Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—IFN-γ-specific purified coating antibody (anti-human IFN-γ polyclonal anti-sera (Endogen Inc.) from sheep serum was diluted (0.5–1.5 μg/ml) in the coating buffer. 100 μl of the diluted antibody was added to each well of 96-well Immulon-II plates, incubated overnight at 25–28 °C, and further processed following the manufacturer's instruction. Final color was developed using horseradish peroxide-streptavidin conjugate and tetramethyl benzidine as chromogen. Color was developed for 10–15 min, the reaction was stopped with H2SO4, and absorbance was read at 450 nm. All samples were analyzed in duplicate. The standard curve was linear from 15–10,000 pg/ml, and IFN-γ above this range were diluted. The inter-assay and intra-assay coefficient of variation was <10%.IFN-γ Neutralization Assay—To study the effect of IFN-γ on invasion, JEG-3 cells stimulated with IL-12 (500 pg/ml) were incubated with human IFN-γ neutralizing antibody (F12, Ab 8096, mouse monoclonal). ELISA was previously performed to monitor the antibody titration and determine the dose of the neutralizing Ab (data not shown). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was carried out to ascertain the safety dose of F12 monoclonal Ab (data not shown). Species-specific random IgGs were also used simultaneously to rule out the possibility of a nonspecific antibody-mediated response.Statistical Analysis—Each experiment was repeated three times, and statistical comparisons were made either by Student's paired t test or by one-way analysis of variance using Microcal Origin software (Microcal Software Inc.). A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be significant.RESULTSEffect of IL-12 on JEG-3 Cell Proteases and Inhibitors—To evaluate the role of IL-12 on the protease expression and bioactivity, JEG-3 cells stimulated with the above cytokine showed a dose-dependent reduction in the mRNA expression of both MMP-2 (Fig. 1A) and MMP-9 (Fig. 1B). Expression of the serine protease, uPA, was also found to be inhibited but only at a higher concentration of IL-12 even though it remains fairly constant at a lower dose (200 pg/ml) (Fig. 1C). TIMP-1, the natural in vivo inhibitor for MMP-9, was significantly up-regulated (Fig. 1D) after IL-12 challenge, although TIMP-2 and PAI-1 were both found to be unaltered (Fig. 1, E and F). Furthermore, the IL-12-mediated transcriptional regulation of MMP-2, MMP-9, and uPA were confirmed by luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 1G).The effect on protein expression and localization fo"

Our results indicate an intimate transcriptional relationship between the avian pineal and retina in addition to providing previously uncharacterized molecular elements that we hypothesize to be involved in circadian rhythm generation. Circadian biological rhythms are a pervasive property of most multicellular organisms, most eukaryotic microorganisms, and at least some prokaryotic taxa. It has been known for some time that circadian rhythms are genetically determined (1Pittendrigh C.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 16-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Circadian traits such as free-running periods (τ) and phase-angle (ψ) to entraining light cycles can be selected for, and mutations for these traits have been identified, leading to the isolation and characterization of molecular clock components (2Young M.W. Kay S.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 9: 702-715Crossref Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 3Rosbash M. Allada R. McDonald M. Peng Y. Zhao J. Novartis Found Symp. 2003; 253: 223-232PubMed Google Scholar). In the last 10–15 years, the mRNA and protein products of many of these “clock genes” have been shown to oscillate with a genotype-specific period, and their protein products have been shown to interact in vitro (4Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar, 5Shearman L.P. Sriram S. Weaver D.R. Maywood E.S. Chaves I. Zheng B. Kume K. Lee C.C. van der Horst G.T.

Cell. 2003; 112: 329-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar).These rhythmic profiles have suggested a generalized model for circadian rhythm generation that involves the transcription, translation, and feedback of these clock gene products on their own transcription. The proposed interlocking transcriptional/translational feedback loops are comprised of “negative elements” and “positive elements” which interact to drive overt rhythmicity (4Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar, 5Shearman L.P. Sriram S. Weaver D.R. Maywood E.S. Chaves I. Zheng B. Kume K. Lee C.C. van der Horst G.T.

Briefly, the negative elements in mammals are encoded by the period genes (per1-3), cryptochromes (cry1 and -2), and Rev-Erbα. These are transcribed in response to the dimerization of the positive elements, which include clock (clock) and the Bmals (Bmal1, 2) and their subsequent binding to E-boxes in the promoter regions of several genes. The negative element transcripts are then translated, oligomerize, and re-enter the nucleus where they inhibit their own and other gene transcription, closing the feedback loop.In vertebrates, circadian organization also relies on discrete neuroendocrine structures that drive and/or entrain downstream rhythms of biochemistry, physiology, and behavior. These structures include the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), 1The abbreviations used are: SCN, suprachiasmatic nucleus; LD, light-dark; DD, constant darkness; CT, circadian time; ZT, zeitgeber time; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.1The abbreviations used are: SCN, suprachiasmatic nucleus; LD, light-dark; DD, constant darkness; CT, circadian time; ZT, zeitgeber time; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. the pineal gland, and the retina. In mammals, the SCN serves as a master pacemaker, responsible for coordinating all downstream oscillators and rhythmic processes. In birds and many other non-mammalian vertebrates, however, the pineal gland, retina, and the avian homologue of the SCN are equally important in regulating overt rhythmicity. The avian pineal gland and retina share several key processes; 1) both are directly photoreceptive, 2) both contain circadian oscillators, and 3) both rhythmically synthesize and release the indoleamine neurohormone melatonin.The retinal clock regulates many local processes including rod outer-segment disk shedding, cGMP channel sensitivity (8Ko G.Y.

Neuroreport. 2002; 13: 2247-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Several of these processes that are controlled by the retinal clock also persist in vitro, wherein retinas grown in culture continue to generate oscillations under constant conditions (16Besharse J.C. Iuvone P.M. Nature. 1983; 305: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 17Chong N.W. Cassone V.M. Bernard M. Klein D.C. Iuvone P.M. Brain Res. Mol.

Under several experimental circumstances loss of the retinal clock in turn disrupts and/or abolishes the clock of the organism or output processes (24Cassone V.M. Menaker M. J. Exp.

Science. 2003; 301: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The retina also is responsible for integrating and relaying photic information to the SCN via retinal ganglion cells and the retinohypothalamic tract. This tract serves as the major pathway for entrainment of the SCN in mammals (28Moore R.Y. Speh J.C. Leak R.K. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 1: 89-98Crossref Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 29Cassone V.M. Speh J.C. Card J.P. Moore R.Y. J. Biol. Rhythms. 1988; 1: 71-91Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and has been an area of great focus in the search for the photopigment(s) existing in retinal ganglion cells that serves as the entraining photoreceptor of the system.Our previous transcriptome analyses (30Bailey M.J. Beremand P.D. Hammer R. Bell-Pedersen D. Thomas T.L. Cassone V.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2084-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) identified candidate molecular components of the avian pineal clock. Here, we determine candidate retinal clock transcripts under light dark and constant darkness conditions to better understand the molecular organization of the avian system. Subsequently, a comparative transcriptome analysis of the two data sets determined candidate molecular machinery regulating the circadian system of chicks within both pacemakers and circadian oscillators.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExperimental Animals—Chicks were obtained from Hyline International (Bryan, TX) and housed under a lighting schedule of 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness (LD 12:12) for 7 days with food and water continuously available. For microarray hybridizations chicks (n = 3/time point/experiment) were sacrificed by decapitation, and their retinas were dissected and pooled. Two separate retinal RNA sampling cycles were performed for array hybridizations. All DD dissections were performed using an infrared viewer. Animals were treated in accordance with Public Health Services guidelines; these procedures have been approved by the Texas A&M University Laboratory Animal Care Committee (AUP #2001–163).Microarray Production and Hybridization—The cDNA microarrays were prepared as previously described (30Bailey M.J. Beremand P.D. Hammer R. Bell-Pedersen D. Thomas T.L. Cassone V.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2084-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) based upon ∼4500 PCR products from each of the two pineal cDNA libraries constructed, for a total of ∼9000 ESTs. Briefly, the cDNA in plasmids from each library were PCR-amplified using flanking primers (SK and T7), purified by ethanol precipitation using ammonium acetate, and placed in the wells of 96-well plates at a concentration of 50 μg/ml in 3× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate). A GeneMachines OmniGrid microarrayer equipped with 8 Telechem SMP3 pins was used to spot the samples onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides (CEL Associates) in duplicate. Slides were stored desiccated at room temperature until their subsequent use. Before hybridization, the dried spots were hydrated gently over a steaming water bath and snap-dried, and the DNA was UV-cross-linked using a Stratalinker (Stratagene).Total RNA was harvested using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) every 4 h for 1 day in a light-dark cycle of 12 h light and 12 h darkness (12:12; lights on 0600 Central Standard Time; lights off 1800 Central Standard Time) and for 1 day in continuous darkness (DD). Times of sampling began 2 h after lights-n (zeitgeber time, ZT2) and continued every 4 h hence (ZT6, ZT10, ZT14, ZT18, ZT22). When lights would have normally turned on, the timer was disabled, and birds were placed in DD. They were then collected again every 4 h and designated circadian time (CT) CT2, CT6, CT10, CT14, CT18, and CT22. This sampling procedure was performed on two separate occasions. A total of four experimental microarray hybridizations were conducted for each time point, two from each respective biological sampling procedure.The total RNA samples were then amplified to produce aRNA using a MessageAmp Kit (Ambion). Randomly primed fluorescent probes were produced from aRNA (amplified RNA) samples using a Genisphere 3DNA Array 900MPX expression array detection kit. The fluorescent dye on probes derived from the experimental aRNA was Cy5, whereas the dye on control probes was Cy3. In all experiments the control sample was derived from retina harvested at midnight (ZT18) under LD conditions.Hybridizations and washes were conducted as suggested by Genisphere. The labeled arrays were scanned in an Affymetrix 428 array scanner. The images obtained were subsequently analyzed by GenePix-Pro software (Axon Instruments).Data Analysis—Data files were then further analyzed by GeneSpring 6.1 (Silicon Genetics). GeneSpring allows the data to be normalized in a variety of ways, allows the assignment of parameters and interpretations, and then allows the data to be filtered to determine differential expression. The current analysis used intensity-dependent LOWESS normalization. Intensity-dependent normalization is just one technique used to eliminate dye-related artifacts in two-color experiments such as this. At each time point the results for each gene were reported as an average obtained from four slides. The data are reported as the normalized ratio of Cy5 (experimental) to Cy3 (control at ZT18). Thus, the data reported for each time point are relative to the abundance of the same gene at midnight (ZT18).The criteria used to define rhythmic genes were those transcripts with a 2.0-fold or higher amplitude change in mRNA levels over a 24-h period relative to the gene respective mRNA abundance level at ZT18 in addition to exhibiting this oscillation in 3 of 4 hybridizations performed. Analysis at the 1.5-fold level was also performed, but not to the extent of examination as the 2.0-fold data set. Those gene sets that were determined to achieve the 1.5- and 2.0-fold criterions were analyzed statistically by one way analysis of variance, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Only statistically significant changes will be reported here. However, the entire dataset is available from the authors. 2M. J. Bailey, P. D. Bereman, R. Hammer, E. Reidel, T. L. Thomas, and V. M. Cassone, unpublished work.RESULTSTranscriptome Analysis—Of the ∼9000 cDNAs represented on the microarray, 546 classified transcripts oscillated with 1.5-fold amplitude, and 175 classified transcripts oscillated with 2-fold or greater amplitude in a light-dark cycle (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2). Upon examination of these transcripts under conditions of constant darkness, the number of oscillating transcripts observed was reduced to 383 at 1.5-fold and to only 49 at 2.0-fold or better (Supplemental Table 3 and 4). This percentage of rhythmic transcripts is similar to those found in the chick pineal gland (30Bailey M.J. Beremand P.D. Hammer R. Bell-Pedersen D. Thomas T.L. Cassone V.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2084-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and other experimental analyses of rhythmic processes using cDNA and/or oligonucleotide arrays (31Harmer S.L. Hogenesch J.B.

We restricted our most detailed analyses to those transcripts that varied by 2.0-fold or more.Functional Categories of Rhythmically Expressed Transcripts—Oscillating retina transcripts in LD and DD were classified according to proposed function. Components of the melatonin generating enzymatic cascade were represented, as were many chick orthologs associated with mammalian circadian clock function. Furthermore, functional analysis revealed transcripts in several broad categories that were also rhythmically expressed. Functional categories were divided into 20 categories: intermediary metabolism (A), development (B), melatonin biosynthesis (C), neuronal associated (D), disease related (E), hormones/growth factors (F), cell cycle/cell death (G), carrier proteins/transport/circulation (H), cytoskeleton/microtubule-associated (I), cell signaling (J), cell adhesion (K), RNA synthesis/stability (L), circadian clock (M), photoreception/phototransductive/visual cycle elements (N), ribosomal proteins/translation (O), stress response/host defense/chaperone (P), transcription factors (Q), protein modification (R), receptors (S), DNA synthesis/replication/binding (T), and miscellaneous functions that don't readily fit into a single category above (U). The stress response/chaperones and cytoskeletal classes under LD conditions had the highest number of oscillating transcripts, with 28 and 23, respectively. In DD the stress response/chaperones again had the largest classification, with eight, followed by the cytoskeletal, carriers, phototransduction, and ribosomal clusters, with five members in each. These functional classifications are indicated in Fig. 1, A and B, and also Supplemental Tables 1–4.Circadian Phase Analysis—Initial analysis of daily and circadian phase relationships revealed rhythmic transcripts that exhibited a diverse set of phases in the LD cycle. However, retinal transcripts rhythmically expressed in DD either accumulated primarily during the day or peaked during the night. These were clustered using a K-means clustering algorithm (GeneSpring) according to the phase of mRNA abundance. The clustering analysis revealed three primary clusters of peaking transcript abundance at CT22–2, CT6, and CT14 (Fig. 2). For each cluster a representative trace is shown indicating the average profile of all oscillating transcripts in each respective cluster. Cluster 1, which composed 20% of the unique DD transcript set, is indicative of transcripts peaking at approximately the onset of subjective dawn CT-22-CT-2; Cluster 2, 49% composed of the unique DD transcripts, at mid-subjective day CT-6; Cluster 3, composed 31% of the unique DD transcripts, at early subjective night CT-14. This distribution of phases is similar to previous findings of other groups (31Harmer S.L. Hogenesch J.B. Straume M. Chang H.S. Han B. Zhu T. Wang X. Kreps J.A. Kay S.A.

Under LD conditions the data indicated a rhythm in tryptophan hydroxylase mRNA such that levels were highest in the early night (ZT14), and hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase was highest at midnight (ZT18). AANAT mRNA exhibited a low amplitude rhythm that was highest during the night as well (Fig. 3A). These patterns corresponded favorably with Northern blot data employing radioactive probes derived from the microarray cDNAs corresponding to each respective gene (Fig. 3B). The rhythm in tryptophan hydroxylase persisted in DD with similar phase angles, whereas hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase and AANAT mRNA were not significantly rhythmic in DD at the 2.0-fold criterion (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3Examination of the melatonin biosynthetic pathway in the chick retina. A, the mRNAs encoding the melatonin biosynthesis pathway examined under LD conditions on the microarray indicated a robust rhythm in tryptophan hydroxylase (TrH) and hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT) mRNA such that transcript abundances were highest in the night. AANAT mRNA was highest during the late night, although with a lower amplitude. The rhythm in tryptophan hydroxylase and AANAT persisted in DD with similar phase angles, whereas hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase mRNA was not significantly rhythmic in DD. B, these patterns corresponded favorably with Northern blot data employing radioactive probes derived from the microarray cDNAs corresponding to each respective gene.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Clock Genes—Several mRNAs encoding putative orthologs of genes associated with circadian clock function were identified in the dataset. These include putative negative elements cryptochrome 1 (cry1), cryptochrome 2 (cry2), period 2 (per2), and period 3 (per3) (Fig. 4A). Under both LD and DD conditions cry1 and per3 exhibited rhythmic mRNA profiles, such that peak cry1 mRNA levels occurred during the midday (ZT6) in LD and mid-subjective day (CT6) in DD, and peak per3 mRNA levels occurred during the late (ZT22) night and subjective night (CT22). Although neither cry2 nor per2 mRNA levels were rhythmic in LD, per2 mRNA levels expressed a modest increase at CT10 in DD. These profiles and their phases were confirmed by Northern blot analyses (Fig. 4B). The putative positive elements clock, bmal1, and bmal2, as well as casein kinase 1 epsilon (ck1E) were examined. Analysis of the putative positive elements yielded a low amplitude rhythm in LD for bmal1 and bmal2, peaking in the early night, ZT14, whereas clock was not rhythmically expressed. In addition, no rhythm in ck1E mRNA abundance was observed. In DD, clock, bmal1, and bmal2 were rhythmically expressed, reaching peak mRNA abundance at CT10–14 (Fig. 4C).Fig. 4Analysis of chick retina clock genes.

Because the microarray was produced from cDNA libraries derived from chick pineal glands, it is important to point out here that retina-specific sequences (genes expressed in the retina but not the pineal gland), such as rhodopsin, are not represented here. Nonetheless, several genes associated with visual transduction were analyzed including melanopsin (Opn4) (35Provencio I. Jiang G. De Grip W.J. Hayes W.P. Rollag M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mRNA for all of these genes was expressed rhythmically under both LD and DD conditions with the exception of melanopsin. Although melanopsin was expressed predominantly in the late day through night in LD, there was no apparent circadian pattern of expression in DD.

Thus, the problem of transported retinaldehyde and by-products from one compartment to another and from the periphery into the retina is likely solved by transport proteins. One of these is purpurin (44Berman P. Gray P. Chen E. Keyser K. Ehrlich D. Karten H. LaCorbiere M. Esch F. Schubert D.

Inwardly rectifying potassium channel (KCNJ) genes encode a large and widespread eukaryotic Kir channel family that modulates excitability throughout the organism (1Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). A potentially equally large family of prokaryotic genes encoding putative bacterial Kir channels (KirBacs) was found in bacterial genomes (2Durell S.R. Guy H.R. BMC Evol. Biol. 2001; (http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/1/14)PubMed Google Scholar). One member, KirBac1.1, was successfully crystallized (3Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), and its structure is consistent with a potassium channel (4Doyle D.A.

Surprisingly, despite this detailed structural insight, there has been no functional characterization of any KirBac proteins and no evidence that KirBac1.1 functions as a channel. Potassium channel properties of KcsA (6Schrempf H. Schmidt O. Kummerlen R. Hinnah S. Muller D. Betzler M. Steinkamp T. Wagner R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5170-5178Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) were originally characterized using a 86Rb+ uptake assay of reconstituted purified proteins in liposomes (7Heginbotham L.

We cloned full-length KirBac1.1, purified it in milligram quantities, and used a similar liposome assay to study its function. Purified KirBac1.1 reconstituted in liposomes indeed forms a K+-selective conductance (K+∼ Rb+∼Cs+ >> Li+∼ Na+∼ NMGM+) 1The abbreviations used are: NMGM+, protonated NMG; NMG, N-methyl-d-glucamine; POPE, palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine; POPG, phosphatidylglycerol; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; TPNQ, TertiapinQ; CTX, charybdotoxin; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.1The abbreviations used are: NMGM+, protonated NMG; NMG, N-methyl-d-glucamine; POPE, palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine; POPG, phosphatidylglycerol; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; TPNQ, TertiapinQ; CTX, charybdotoxin; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. that is inhibited by Ba2+ and Ca2+. In contrast to KcsA, but consistent with eukaryotic Kir channels, KirBac1.1 is inhibited at low pH. This characterization of KirBac1.1 activity now paves the way for further correlation of structure and function in this model Kir channel. Molecular Biology—KirBac1.1 was cloned from genomic DNA of Burkholderia pseudomallei by PCR. For expression in Escherichia coli, an NcoI restriction site was attached at the 5′ end of KirBac1.1 and a segment of DNA coding for the amino acids “LVPR” followed by a BamHI site replaced the stop codon at the 3′ end by PCR. The product was subcloned into NcoI and BamHI sites of the pQE60 vector (Qiagen Inc.) resulting in a fusion construct coding for KirBac1.1, immediately followed by the amino acid sequence “LVPRGSRSHHHHHH” that contains a thrombin cleavage site and a His6 tag used for purification (Fig. 1, A and B). An extra glycine was introduced after the initiator methionine to keep the sequence in frame. Protein Purification—Transformed BL21*(DE3) were grown in 1-liter cultures to A600 ∼1.0, induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37C for 3 h, pelleted, and resuspended in 20 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, and two tablets of EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Diagnostics). Bacteria were lysed by sonication; decylmaltoside (Anatrace) was added to a final concentration of 30 mm and incubated at room temperature for 2–4 h. The mixture was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was applied to a cobalt affinity column. The column was washed with 20–30 bed volumes of wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 5 mm decylmaltoside) to minimize nonspecific binding. KirBac1.1 was eluted with 1–2 ml of wash buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. One liter of culture typically yielded ∼1 mg of KirBac1.1 protein and was concentrated to 1–8 mg/ml using 30-kDa centrifugal filters (Millipore) and stored in wash buffer with 20 mm imidazole. The concentration was quantified by Pierce protein assay or optical densitometry using an estimated molar extinction coefficient of 51910 m-1 cm-1 (10Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3372) Google Scholar). 86Rb+Uptake Assay—Composition of buffers is as follows: buffer A, 450 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 4 mm NMG, pH 7; buffer B, 450 mm sorbitol, 10 mm HEPES, 4 mm NMG, 50 μm KCl, pH 7.0. Lipids at 3:1 POPE:POPG (Avanti) were dried under nitrogen followed by vacuum centrifugation and stored in 4-mg aliquots at –4 °C in N2-filled glass tubes covered with parafilm. Lipid aliquots were resuspended (10 mg/ml in buffer A) using a bath sonicator, CHAPS was added to a final concentration of 37 mm, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 2 h before assay. Purified KirBac1.1 (or KcsA) was added (2–3 μg/ml lipid, volume of protein ∼0.5–3 μl per 100 μl of lipids) and incubated 30 min. Disposable polystyrene columns (Pierce, catalog number 29920) were packed with Sephadex G-50 (fine) beads (1 ml), swollen overnight in buffer A or B. Prespun columns (filled with Sephadex beads swollen in buffers A and B, respectively) were prepared immediately prior to use by centrifugation at 1500 × g (Beckman TJ6); centrifugation was stopped upon reaching the goal speed. Liposomes were formed by placing 100 μl of detergent-solubilized lipid/protein mixture directly on top of the gel bed of a prespun column A, and liposomes were collected into glass tubes by spinning at 1000 × g (2500 RPM Beckman TJ6) and immediately stopping upon reaching goal speed. Liposomes were used within 0.5–4 h. Immediately before flux measurements, extraliposomal solution was exchanged for buffer B by placing the suspension directly on top of the gel bed of a prespun column B, and liposomes were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g. 86Rb+ uptake was initiated by mixing liposomes with 4 volumes buffer B (final concentration of 86Rb+ at 1–5 μm). A 50-μl aliquot of the radioactive mixture was taken at the time points indicated, and extraliposomal 86Rb+ was removed by passage over a 0.5-ml Dowex cation exchange column in the NMGH+ form and eluting into scintillation vials with 1.5 ml of 400 mm sorbitol. Samples were mixed with scintillation fluid and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Dowex beads were washed in methanol and distilled water and converted to NMGH+ form by addition of HCl then NMG. Disposable polypropylene screening columns (Fisher, catalog number 11-387-50) were filled with 0.5 bed volume of the Dowex beads. Dowex columns were further prepared by applying 1 ml of bovine serum albumin (5 mg/ml) in 400 mm sorbitol to minimize nonspecific binding and 50 μl of liposome solution to minimize reduced recovery of liposomes that tended to occur with the first set of samples, followed by 2 ml of 400 mm sorbitol. Valinomycin was used to assay maximal 86Rb+ uptake. Cloning of Full-length KirBac1.1—We cloned KirBac1.1 (11Bhattacharyya J. Enkvetchakul D. Nelson D. Markova K. Cukras C. Jeliazkova I. Nichols C.G. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 78aGoogle Scholar) from genomic B. pseudomallei DNA (from bacterial lysate, a gift of Richard Titball and Tim Atkins, Defense Science and Technology Laboratory, Porton Down, Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK). The cloned sequence (see Fig. 1A) is identical to that published in the data base (B. pseudomallei Sequencing Group, ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/bps/) and differs from the protein crystallized by Kuo et al. (3Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), which contained a point substitution (A69V) and a 12-amino acid deletion from the C terminus). 86Rb+Uptake Liposomal Assay of Purified KirBac1.1 Protein—C-terminal His6-tagged KirBac1.1 (Fig. 1, A and B) was expressed in E. coli and purified over a cobalt column (see “Materials and Methods”). By Coomassie Blue stain and Western blot (Fig. 1C), purified KirBac1.1 migrates as a single major band (∼40 kDa), with a faint band at a slightly lower molecular mass on SDS-PAGE, consistent with the expected monomeric molecular mass (38.9 kDa including thrombin site and His6 tag). Purified KirBac1.1 was reconstituted into liposomes (POPE:POPG 3:1 ratio) formed with 450 and 0.05 mm internal and external [K+], respectively (see “Materials and Methods”). Liposomes that contain a K+-selective permeation pathway will generate a large negative internal potential due to this large K+ gradient that will drive uptake of tracer 86Rb+ added to the external solution, allowing uptake of 86Rb+ to be used as a surrogate for K+-selective channel activity. Fig. 2A shows 86Rb+ uptake into liposomes reconstituted with no protein, KirBac1.1, or KcsA, at neutral pH. Liposomes without protein demonstrate very low uptake rates (Fig. 2A). As a positive control, KcsA forms a K+-selective pathway when reconstituted in liposomes (8Heginbotham L. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 9Cuello L.G. Romero J.G. Cortes D.M. Perozo E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3229-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and shows rapid, Ba2+-inhibitable uptake (Fig. 2A). KirBac1.1 also demonstrates a robust 86Rb+ uptake, indicating that KirBac1.1 protein produces a K+ permeation pathway, selective for K+ over Cl-. KirBac1.1 is also markedly inhibited by externally applied 1 mm Ba2+ and Ca2+ (Fig. 2). Barium and Ca2+ sensitivity were assessed by Rb+ uptake at 30 s (i.e. before saturation), as a fraction of the uptake in the absence of divalents. KirBac1.1 inhibition by Ba2+ and Ca2+ are concentration-dependent, with half-maximal inhibition at ∼4 and ∼220 μm, respectively (Fig. 2B). KirBac1.1 Is Selective for K+over Na+—Potassium channels are highly selective for K+, Rb+, and Cs+ over other alkali metal ions (12Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1992: 352Google Scholar). In liposomes reconstituted with a cation permeation pathway, substitution of the internal permeant cation with a non-permeant cation would prevent development of negative internal liposomal potential and diminish 86Rb+ uptake. Using this strategy, we replaced internal K+ with Li+, Na+, Rb+, Cs+, or NMGH+ ions to assess cation selectivity of KirBac1.1 (Fig. 3A). Liposomes containing KirBac1.1, with K+, Rb+, or Cs+ as the internal cation, demonstrate significant uptake, consistent with these ions being permeant. Substitution with Na+, Li+, or NMGH+ resulted in minimal uptake of 86Rb+, indicating that these cations are not significantly permeant. The strong negative internal potential in liposomes is created secondarily to the large concentration gradient of permeant cations. The addition of permeant cations to the external solution will diminish this electrical gradient and decrease 86Rb+ uptake, allowing an alternative method of assessing cation selectivity. Liposomes with reconstituted KirBac1.1 were formed with 450 mm internal K+, 0.05 mm external K+, and varying concentrations of Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+, or NMGH+ ions were added to the external solution (Fig. 3B). Increasing external K+, Rb+, and to a slightly lesser extent Cs+, results in a decreased uptake of 86Rb+, again consistent with these ions, but not Li+, Na+ NMGH+, being permeant. These results show that KirBac1.1 forms a cation pathway with selectivity for K+, Rb+, and Cs+ over Li+, Na+, and NMGH+, blocked by divalent Ba2+ and Ca2+. Polyamines are the characteristic pore blockers of strongly rectifying eukaryotic Kir channels (1Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). We attempted to examine blocking of KcsA- and KirBac1.1-mediated 86Rb+ uptake by extraliposomally applied polyamines. Below 100 mm, there was no evidence of channel block by spermidine or spermine. At higher concentrations, valinomycin-dependent uptake is abolished, suggesting that these polycations collapse the electrochemical gradient, probably by destroying the liposomes (data not shown). We also tested toxin blockers of K+ channels, TertiapinQ (TPNQ), and charybdotoxin (CTX), which act through binding to the external side of the channel pore (13Heginbotham L. LeMasurier M. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 14Jin W. Lu Z. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13291-13299Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 15Miller C. Neuron. 1995; 15: 5-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). TPNQ selectively blocks two members of the Kir family, Kir3.1/3.4 and Kir1.1, but not Kir6; CTX blocks certain voltage- and calcium-activated potassium channels. In liposomes reconstituted with KirBac1.1 or KcsA, up to 1 mm extraliposomal and 10 μm intraliposomal TPNQ and CTX both failed to inhibit uptake (data not shown). All eukaryotic Kir channels are activated by the addition of phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane and it is believed that PIP2 or other negatively charged lipids are required for channel activity (16Enkvetchakul D. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). PIP2 is generally absent from prokaryotic membranes and obviously not necessary for activity of KirBac1.1 in pure POPE:POPG membranes, but experiments to examine the lipid requirements for channel activity are clearly warranted. Finally, ATP can activate many Kir channels by phosphorylation and specifically inhibits Kir6 sub-family channels by binding to the cytoplasmic domain of the channel (16Enkvetchakul D. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Addition of ATP at up to 10 mm (Na+ salt) was without effect on KirBac1.1 (data not shown). pH Modulation of KirBac1.1 Activity—Protons modulate eukaryotic Kir activity, and Kir1, Kir4, and Kir5 are particularly sensitive to inhibition by intracellular protons (17Jiang C. Qu Z. Xu H. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We examined the pH dependence of 86Rb+ uptake by KirBac1.1 in liposomes formed with an internal pH of 7.0 and then placed in varying external pH. As demonstrated previously (9Cuello L.G. Romero J.G. Cortes D.M. Perozo E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3229-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), the time course of 86Rb+ uptake was markedly inhibited by high external pH in liposomes reconstituted with KcsA (Fig. 4A). In contrast, KirBac1.1 demonstrated an opposite dependence on external pH and was completely inhibited at pH 5 and below (Fig. 4B). To achieve the indicated pH levels, three different external buffers were used, succinate (pH 3.5 and 5), HEPES (pH 7.4), and Tris (pH 7.4 and 9). Conceivably, the difference in activation of KirBac and KcsA could be due to the different buffers themselves, rather than proton concentration. We therefore examined the pH dependence of 86Rb+ uptake over narrower ranges using single buffer systems (Fig. 4B, left (Succinate) and right (HEPES)). While this precludes examination of a wide pH range, it is clear that there is activation of KcsA, but inhibition of KirBac1.1, below neutral pH. Unexpectedly, the activity curve for both KcsA and KirBac1.1 is shifted ∼1.5 pH units more alkaline in HEPES-buffered solutions compared with succinate-buffered solutions. The cause of the shift is unclear; pH of the solutions was confirmed using both a pH electrode and fluorometrically (phenol red), before and after the experiment to ensure stability. In the representative experiments of Fig. 4A, it is apparent that in KirBac1.1-containing liposomes there is a reduced valinomycin flux as pH is lowered below neutral. We examined this systematically using different protein preparations (Fig. 4C). Although more pronounced for KirBac1.1, it is apparent that both KirBac1.1 and KcsA are associated with a reduced valinomycin uptake, as pH is made more acidic. At pH 3.5, valinomycin flux is significantly reduced even in liposomes without protein, reflecting an additional non-protein component. To date, three prokaryotic potassium channels have been functionally characterized, KcsA, MthK and KvAP (6Schrempf H. Schmidt O. Kummerlen R. Hinnah S. Muller D. Betzler M. Steinkamp T. Wagner R.

Two of these (MthK and KvAP) represent ancestral homologs of eukaryotic Ca-activated (KCa) and voltage-gated (Kv) potassium channels, respectively. The available crystal structures provide a template for modeling and understanding the molecular basis of KCa and Kv channel activity. KcsA is something of an anomaly, being an acid-activated two-transmembrane helix channel without obvious eukaryotic descendents. The eukaryotic Kir (KCNJ1–7) gene family expresses Kir channels with critical roles in most cell types (1Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The defining structural feature of Kir channels is a conserved cytoplasmic domain (5Nishida M. MacKinnon R.

A prokaryotic Kir channel family has now appeared in the data base (2Durell S.R. Guy H.R. BMC Evol. Biol. 2001; (http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/1/14)PubMed Google Scholar), and the crystallization of one member (3Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar) provides a critical high-resolution structure of an archetypal Kir channel (KirBac1.1). Uniquely, KirBac1.1 is the only potassium channel protein to have been crystallized (3Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar) without any information regarding its function. The present data demonstrate that full-length KirBac1.1 does generate a potassium-selective permeation path in phospholipid membranes, with important regulatory features that are consistent with those of eukaryotic Kir channels. Ion Transport Properties of KirBac1.1—Both KirBac1.1 and KcsA generate permeability to K+ and the close analogues Rb+ and Cs+. Na+, Li+, and organic cations are essentially impermeable, and submillimolar Ca2+ or Ba2+ blocks both channels (8Heginbotham L. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The data indicate similar permeability to K+,Rb+, and Cs+ in KirBac1.1. In mammalian Kir channels, K+ is generally more permeant than Rb+ or Cs+. Residues Thr-141 and Ser-165 in Kir2.1 both contribute to conductance and block by Cs+ and Rb+ ions (21Thompson G.A. Leyland M.L. Ashmole I. Sutcliffe M.J. Stanfield P.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 526: 231-240Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Mutation of these two residues to alanine and leucine, respectively, leads to increased Rb+ permeation and large Cs+ permeation. Interestingly, the corresponding residues in KirBac1.1 are alanine and isoleucine (at positions 110 and 132 in Fig. 1A), which may explain the high Rb+ and Cs+ permeability indicated by the ion substitution experiments in Fig. 3. Further experiments exploring the role of these residues in controlling ion selectivity are warranted. pH Dependence of KirBac1.1—KcsA is activated under acidic extraliposomal conditions (Fig. 4), consistent with published studies (9Cuello L.G. Romero J.G. Cortes D.M. Perozo E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3229-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 13Heginbotham L. LeMasurier M. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In marked contrast, KirBac1.1 activity is inhibited in extraliposomal acidic conditions. In an attempt to examine intraliposomal pH dependence of activity, we formed liposomes in different pH and then washed them in external pH 7.0. There was no obvious dependence of either KirBac or KcsA activity on intraliposomal pH (data not shown). This suggests that neither KcsA nor KirBac1.1 are sensitive to intraliposomal pH. One possible interpretation is that both KcsA and KirBac1.1 are oriented unidirectionally with the pH sensor pointed extraliposomally. Alternatively, channels could be oriented bidirectionally and function only if the pH sensor is directed outward. However, an unavoidable possibility is that the pH gradient across the liposome will equilibrate to the extraliposomal pH, which thus modulates channels in either orientation. The cause of the differential effect of succinate versus HEPES buffer on KcsA and KirBac1.1 is unclear, but since both channels show similar parallel (∼1.5 pH units) shifts of activation curves, it seems likely that there is a systematic buffer effect on intraliposomal, extraliposomal, or intramembrane pH. Conceivably, diffusion of uncharged buffer into liposomes could cause acidification by succinic acid or uncharged HEPES. If functional channels are oriented with their pH sensors inwards, a differential diffusion could cause the observed shift in apparent extraliposomal pH dependence. The differential effect of buffer system could also result from a direct effect itself on the channels (22Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3711-3719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Any direct effect of the buffer would have to be the same on both KcsA and KirBac1.1 and would not affect the conclusion that KirBac1.1 is inhibited by extraliposomal protons, opposite to the pH sensitivity of KcsA. Inhibition by low cytoplasmic pH is a common feature of eukaryotic Kirs. Of the latter, Kir1.1 and Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channels are particularly sensitive to proton inhibition (16Enkvetchakul D. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Sackin H. Vasilyev A. Palmer L.G. Krambis M. Biophys.

While the mechanism of proton inhibition in eukaryotic Kir channels is still not entirely clear, it seems likely that common pH-sensing elements (24Schulte U. Fakler B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Casamassima M. D'Adamo M.C. Pessia M. Tucker S.J. J. Biol.

(Lond.). 2002; 543: 495-504Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) are present in the cytoplasmic domain of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic channels. Conclusions—KirBac1.1 has been crystallized, but there has been no functional characterization of any prokaryotic Kir proteins. The above data demonstrate that purified KirBac1.1 forms a potassium-selective permeation pathway when reconstituted into liposomes, with typical K+ channel ion selectivity as well as sensitivity to block by Ba2+ and Ca2+. In direct contrast to KcsA, but consistent with eukaryotic Kir channels, KirBac1.1 is inhibited in acidic conditions. The combination of functional characterization of mutant KirBac1.1 and crystallographic studies (3Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar) can now be used to take understanding of the mechanisms of activity and regulation of Kir channels to a new level. We are grateful to Rod MacKinnon for the gift of KcsA."
https://openalex.org/W2100514192,"Upstream of Byrd Station (West Antarctica), ice-penetrating radar data reveal a distinctive fold structure within the ice, in which isochronous layers are unusually deep. The fold has an axis more than 50 kilometers long, which is aligned up to 45° to the ice flow direction. Although explanations for the fold's formation under the present flow are problematic, it can be explained if flow was parallel to the fold axis ∼1500 years ago. This flow change may be associated with ice stream alterations nearer the margin. If this is true, central West Antarctica may respond to future alterations more than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2094757629,"Transcription factor NGFI-B (neuronal growth factor-induced clone B), also called Nur77 or TR3, is an immediate early gene and an orphan member of the nuclear receptor family. The NGFI-B protein also has a function distinct from that of a transcription factor; it translocates to mitochondria to initiate apoptosis. Recently, it was demonstrated that NGFI-B interacts with Bcl-2 by inducing a conformational change in Bcl-2, converting it from protector to a killer (Lin, B., Kolluri, S. K., Lin, F., Liu, W., Han, Y. H., Cao, X., Dawson, M. I., Reed, J. C., and Zhang, X. K. (2004) Cell 116, 527–540). After exposing rat cerebellar granule neurons to glutamate (100 μm, 15 min), NGFI-B translocated to the mitochondria. Growth factors such as the epidermal growth factor activate the MAP kinase ERK, the activity of which may determine whether a cell survives or undergoes apoptosis. In the present study we found that the epidermal growth factor activated ERK2 in cerebellar granule neurons and that this activation prohibited glutamate-induced subcellular translocation of NGFI-B. Likewise, overexpressed active ERK2 resulted in a predominant nuclear localization of green fluorescent protein-tagged NGFI-B. Thus, activation of ERK2 may overcome apoptosis-induced subcellular translocation of NGFI-B.

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAP, mitogen activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; gfp, green fluorescent protein; NGF, neuronal growth factor; NGFI-B, NGF-induced clone B. as a cell survival factor is widely known to initiate the activation of three major signaling pathways, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, the phosphatidylinositide 3-OH kinase/c-Akt kinase cascade, and the phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) pathway. The importance of the ERK pathway in neuronal cell survival has been well documented in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells where activation of the ERK signaling pathway inhibits apoptosis, whereas the down-regulation of ERK mediated by neuronal growth factor (NGF) withdrawal leads to apoptosis (1Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). EGF, when added to the culture medium, significantly reduces the glutamate-induced neuronal death in dissociated cerebellar neurons from fetal rats (2Gunn-Moore F.J. Tavare J.M. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 250: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 3Abe K. Saito H. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 14: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) as well as in other neuronal types (4Casper D. Blum M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1016-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system but also a potent excitotoxin (5Olney J.W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1986; 203: 631-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Overstimulation of glutamate receptors has been suggested as being involved during both acute and chronic neurodegeneration in the adult brain (6Choi D.W. Neuron. 1988; 1: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4220) Google Scholar) and involves cell death by apoptosis (7Ankarcrona M. Dypbukt J.M. Bonfoco E. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Lipton S.A. Nicotera P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 961-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). Transcription factor NGFI-B (Nur77 or TR3) is a member of the steroid-thyroid receptor superfamily, also called nuclear receptors (8Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6341) Google Scholar). NGFI-B was originally identified by virtue of its rapid induction by serum in fibroblasts and by NGF in PC12 (9Milbrandt J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 183-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 10Hazel T.G. Nathans D. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). NGFI-B is called an orphan nuclear receptor because of strong sequence homology to nuclear receptors, whereas no specific ligand has been identified (11Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Johnston M. Milbrandt J. Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Transcription of the immediate early gene NGFI-B is activated transiently, rapidly, and independently of protein synthesis in a variety of cell types by multiple stimuli, including growth factors (12Hazel T.G. Misra R. Davis I.J. Greenberg M.E. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3239-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Watson M.A. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell.

The activity of NGFI-B as a transcriptional activator appears to be under multiple levels of control. First, the mRNA induction varies with different inducing stimuli (15Bartel D.P. Sheng M. Lau L.F. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Second, the NGFI-B protein is differentially modified by multisite phosphorylation in response to different stimuli (12Hazel T.G. Misra R. Davis I.J. Greenberg M.E. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3239-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Fahrner T.J. Carroll S.L. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell.

Commun. 2002; 291: 1146-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which probably is important for modulating the cellular response to environmental change. The NGFI-B protein also has a function distinct from that of a transcription factor; it translocates to mitochondria to initiate apoptosis (20Li H. Kolluri S.K. Gu J. Dawson M.I. Cao X. Hobbs P.D. Lin B. Chen G. Lu J. Lin F. Xie Z. Fontana J.A. Reed J.C. Zhang X. Science. 2000; 289: 1159-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that NGFI-B interacts with Bcl-2 by inducing a conformational change in Bcl-2, converting it from protector to a killer (21Lin B. Kolluri S.K. Lin F. Liu W. Han Y.H.

The importance of NGFI-B in the apoptotic process was demonstrated earlier in knock-out experiments in T-cell hybridomas (22Woronicz J.D. Calnan B. Ngo V. Winoto A. Nature. 1994; 367: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 23Liu Z.G. Smith S.W. McLaughlin K.A. Schwartz L.M. Osborne B.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). EGF stimulation has been shown to lead to phosphorylation of NGFI-B in PC12 cells (12Hazel T.G. Misra R. Davis I.J. Greenberg M.E. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3239-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition, NGFI-B is a direct substrate for the MAP kinase ERK2 in vitro (19Slagsvold H.H. Ostvold A.C. Fallgren A.B. Paulsen R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 1146-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The objective of the present study was therefore to investigate whether EGF may use the ERK2 survival pathway to cross-talk to the apoptosis initiator NGFI-B. Specifically, we have asked if ERK2-mediated phosphorylation of NGFI-B may be involved in the subcellular translocation of NGFI-B in neuronal cells and if this occurs in the presence of apoptosis induced by glutamate. Furthermore, we have overexpressed the ERK2 protein and mimicked the effect of EGF stimulation on NGFI-B translocation. Basal Eagle's medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 25 mm HEPES, and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen. Poly-l-lysine, gentamicin sulfate, cytosine arabinofuranoside, trypan blue, glutamine, and 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were from Sigma. The Nur77 primary antibody (goat) and the heat shock protein-60 (HSP60) primary antibody (rabbit) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cy-3-conjugated mouse anti-goat and Cy-2-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit antibodies were from Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories (West Grove, Pennsylvania). The phospho-p44/42 MAPK monoclonal antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Enzyme-linked chemiluminescence ECL Plus was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. MEK inhibitor U0126 was obtained from Promega. Pure nitrocellulose membrane and the horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse antibody were from Bio-Rad. Cell Culture—Cerebellar granule neurons were obtained from 7–8-day-old albino rats (24Ciani E. Groneng L. Voltattorni M. Rolseth V. Contestabile A. Paulsen R.E. Brain Res. 1996; 728: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 25Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Balazs R. Jorgensen O.S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neurons were seeded on plastic dishes coated with 20 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (cell density of 2 × 105 cells/cm2) and cultured in basal Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 μg/ml gentamicin. To prevent the growth of non-neuronal cells, cytosine arabinofuranoside (10 μm final concentration) was added to the cultures 16–18 h after seeding. After 7–8 days in vitro, cultures were exposed to 100 μm glutamate at room temperature for 15 min in physiological buffer (154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 2.3 mm CaCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). At the end of glutamate exposure, cultures were washed and incubated in serum-free basal Eagle's medium (25 mm KCl). Control cultures were exposed to physiological buffer without glutamate for 15 min at room temperature before washing and incubation in serum-free basal Eagle's medium (25 mm KCl). In some cultures EGF (5 ng/ml) was present for 15 min (in physiological buffer) before and during the exposure of the cells. The procedure for handling animals used for cell cultures was approved by the appropriate animal care committee of the Norwegian government. CV1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. EGF (5 ng/ml) was added directly to the medium. In experiments with the MEK inhibitor U0126, the cells were pretreated with the inhibitor in the medium for 60 min, followed by co-treatment with EGF. Immunofluorescence Detection of NGFI-B and HSP60—Cerebellar granule cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 4 min at room temperature. Cells were then stained with an anti-Nur77 antibody (1:400 dilution) and anti-HSP60 antibody (1:400 dilution) overnight. Cy-3 conjugated mouse anti-goat (1:400 dilution) and Cy-2-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit (1:100 dilution) (60-min incubation at room temperature) were utilized as secondary antibodies. DAPI staining (final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml) was done in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Stained cells were examined with a Nikon Eclipse TE300DV fluorescence microscope using a SPOT RT Color camera and SPOT software. Western Blotting and Measurement of ERK Activity—Cerebellar granule cells or CV1 cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 2% SDS. Equal amounts of cell lysates were mixed and boiled with 2× Laemmli buffer reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred onto pure nitrocellulose membrane. After protein transfer, the membranes were incubated in TBS-T (100 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% nonfat milk and an antibody recognizing the MAP kinase in activated form, i.e. specific for ERK (p44mapk and p42mapk; ERK1 and ERK2) phosphorylated at Thr-202 plus Tyr-204 (diluted 1:2000) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse antibody (diluted 1:1500). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with ECL Plus. ERK kinase activity was measured as described (26Anderson N.G. Kilgour E. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10131-10135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Thoresen G.H. Guren T.K. Sandnes D. Peak M. Agius L. Christ-offersen T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In short, the cells were rinsed twice in saline and scraped into a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaO3V, and 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol. The lysate was centrifuged (15,000 × g) for 10 min. The supernatant was mixed with phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and washed twice with each of the buffers containing 10 and 35% ethylene glycol before elution of the ERK kinases with 60% ethylene glycol. The eluate was assayed for kinase activity in the presence of an inhibitor of protein kinase A (protein kinase inhibitor Sigma P-0300) using the myelin basic protein as the substrate. Transient Transfection of CV1 Cells—A calcium phosphate precipitation procedure was used for transient transfections. CV1 cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of the expressor plasmid NGFI-Bgfp chimera (generated by insertion of NGFI-B cDNA fused to the green fluorescent protein (gfp) sequence from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) into the pQBI-Ad-CMV5 mammalian transfection vector (QBI, Fremont, CA)) and 5 μgof one of the three ERK2 plasmids, namely pCMV5 ERK2 wild type, pCMV5 ERK2 K52R dominant negative, or pCMV5 ERK2-MEK1R4F dominant active (kindly provided by Dr. M. Cobb, University of Texas, South Western Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Pictures were captured using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope using a SPOT RT Color camera and SPOT software. Statistics—Statistical differences between multiple comparisons were analyzed by one-way repeated measures analysis of variance followed by a subsequent Dunnett's post hoc test (SigmaStat software). A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. EGF Protects Rat Cerebellar Granule Neurons from Cell Death Induced by Glutamate—To find out if EGF protects rat granule neurons from cell death, we treated cells with glutamate in the absence and presence of EGF. EGF significantly reduced the cell death induced by glutamate when EGF was present at the time of glutamate exposure (Fig. 1A). Cerebellar granule cells were treated with EGF or EGF in the presence of the MEK inhibitor U0126 to see if EGF turned on the MEK/ERK pathway. ERK showed some phosphorylation in control cells; however, when EGF was added the phosphorylation of ERK was increased (Fig 1B). The MEK inhibitor U0126 blocked this ERK activation. NGFI-B Translocates When Rat Cerebellar Granule Neurons Are Treated with Glutamate and EGF—In rat cerebellar granule cells that were untreated, NGFI-B co-stained with DAPI. Cerebellar granule cultures that were treated with glutamate showed NGFI-B in a different compartment than DAPI (Fig. 2A). In this case, NGFI-B co-stained with the mitochondrial marker HSP60 (Fig. 2B). When EGF was added to glutamate-treated cells, the majority of the cells showed NGFI-B staining similar to that of control cells. By adding the MEK inhibitor U0126, EGF no longer inhibited glutamate-induced translocation of NGFI-B (Fig. 3). Interestingly, cells treated with EGF expressed brighter staining than did control at 2 h. This brighter staining was diminished by adding U0126, indicating an ERK-dependent induction of the NGFI-B protein. CV1 Cells Express Activated ERK When Given EGF—CV1 cells, which are easily transfected, were utilized for overexpression experiments. CV1 cells showed ERK activation following EGF stimulation (Fig. 4). CV-1 cells were treated with EGF alone and EGF in the presence of the MEK inhibitor U0126. Cells were harvested at 10, 60, and 120 min. Western blot stained with phospho-p44/42 MAPK monoclonal antibody showed that ERK was strongly phosphorylated at 10 min and that this phosphorylation was strongly reduced at 60 and 120 min after treatment. The MEK inhibitor U0126 prevented the phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 4A). There was also a significantly higher activation of ERK at 10 min compared with 120 min after treatment and controls. This activity was diminished in the presence of U0126 (Fig. 4B). Thus, CV1 cells were a useful cell culture for studying the transient effects of the ERK action. NGFI-B Translocates When Overexpressed with ERK2—To investigate if NGFI-B translocates in CV1 cells when given EGF, we transfected CV1 cells with gfp-tagged NGFI-B and added EGF. Before EGF was added, NGFI-B showed a distribution in the entire cell. After 10 min of EGF treatment, NGFI-B was located mainly in the nucleus, and by 60 min NGFI-B was back to its original distribution in the entire cell (Fig. 5A). This result correlated with ERK activity in CV1 cells after EGF treatment (Fig. 4). We wanted to address the question of whether ERK2 was responsible for this translocation of NGFI-B. We co-transfected gfp-tagged NGFI-B together with ERK2, dominant negative ERK2 (ERK2K52R), and dominant active ERK2 (ERK2-MEK1R4F). The cells co-tranfected with gfp-tagged NGFI-B and ERK2 showed NGFI-B distribution in the entire cell. 10 min after adding EGF this distribution changed to show NGFI-B mainly in the nucleus. After 60 min following EGF addition, NGFI-B was distributed throughout the cell again (Fig. 5B). CV1 cells co-transfected with gfp-tagged NGFI-B and dominant negative ERK2 showed a distribution of NGFI-B in the entire cell before adding EGF. EGF did not affect this distribution either at 10 min or at 60 min. CV1 cells co-transfected with gfp-tagged NGFI-B and dominant active ERK2 showed a distribution of NGFI-B in the nucleus before adding EGF. EGF treatment did not affect this nuclear location (Fig. 5B). In this communication we show that EGF activates ERK2, which prohibits apoptosis-induced subcellular translocation of the orphan nuclear receptor and apoptosis initiator NGFI-B. Glutamate produces an insult-dependent continuum of apoptosis and necrosis in cultured cortical neurons, where necrosis predominates after intense insults but mild insults result in apoptotic cell death (28Cheung N.S. Pascoe C.J. Giardina S.F. John C.A. Beart P.M. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 1419-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In our experiments we treated the cells with 100 μm glutamate, which is a mild insult and thus initiates apoptosis rather than necrosis (29Slagsvold H.H. Rosseland C.M. Jacobs C. Khuong E. Kristoffersen N. Gaarder M. Fallgren A.B. Huitfeldt H.S. Paulsen R.E. Brain Res. 2003; 984: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). EGF treatment of the cerebellar granule neuron cultures protected the cells against apoptosis induced by glutamate when present during the apoptotic signal. Earlier studies have shown that EGF promotes the survival of primary cultured neurons from various regions of the brain (3Abe K. Saito H. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 14: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 4Casper D. Blum M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1016-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). When EGF was added to the culture medium 20 h prior to the addition of glutamate, glutamate-induced cell death was significantly reduced. EGF activates the MAP kinase pathway in rat cerebellar neurons, and it has been shown that activated ERK1/2 translocates into the nucleus to regulate gene expression by either direct or indirect phosphorylation (30Thomson S. Mahadevan L.C. Clayton A.L. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In contrast to the present study, these studies did not find any reduction in cell death when EGF was added only 1 h before glutamate was added. In cultured cortical neurons, EGF protected effectively against ischemia when administered 24–6 h prior to the ischemic insult, whereas the addition of EGF at the time of ischemia provided only modest protection (31Maiese K. Boniece I. DeMeo D. Wagner J.A. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3034-3040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies indicate that the neuroprotection seen by EGF treatment in some neurons was mainly gene-regulated. In our study EGF treatment at the time of glutamate treatment resulted in a 50% protection, demonstrating the presence of a protective mechanism that is rapid and independent of prior gene regulation. EGF stimulation has been shown earlier to lead to phosphorylation of NGFI-B in PC12 cells (12Hazel T.G. Misra R. Davis I.J. Greenberg M.E. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3239-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The NGFI-B protein is modified by multisite phosphorylation in response to different stimuli (12Hazel T.G. Misra R. Davis I.J. Greenberg M.E. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3239-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Fahrner T.J. Carroll S.L. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation takes place predominantly in the amino terminus (17Davis I.J. Hazel T.G. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Lau L.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Three specific phosphorylation sites have been identified. Phosphorylation of a residue in the DNA-binding region has been described in detail as having an effect on the transcriptional function of the protein (17Davis I.J. Hazel T.G. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Lau L.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 32Katagiri Y. Hirata Y. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31278-31284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently, an NGF-induced phosphorylation in the amino terminus of NGFI-B was characterized. This phosphorylation resulted in translocation of NGFI-B out of the nucleus (18Katagiri Y. Takeda K. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Ozato K. Guroff G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Another phosphorylation in the amino terminus of NGFI-B has been described and is mediated by ERK2, as demonstrated by phosphorylation experiments using ERK2 (mouse pp42mapk) in vitro. Recombinant ERK1 (human pp44mapk) was not able to phosphorylate NGFI-B (19Slagsvold H.H. Ostvold A.C. Fallgren A.B. Paulsen R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 1146-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This ERK2-specific phosphorylation has later been verified in vivo (33Castro-Obregon S. Rao R.V. del Rio G. Chen S.F. Poksay K.S. Rabizadeh S. Vesce S. Zhang X.K. Swanson R.A. Bredesen D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17543-17553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). NGFI-B is phosphorylated differentially by different stimuli such as membrane depolarization and growth factor treatment, and this observation is an attractive way of explaining how the same immediateearly transcription factor may mediate stimuli that induce divergent cellular responses (12Hazel T.G. Misra R. Davis I.J. Greenberg M.E. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3239-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Fahrner T.J. Carroll S.L. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6454-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For instance, NGF stimulates PC12 cells to undergo one round of replication followed by differentiation, whereas EGF does not promote differentiation, only proliferation of PC12 cells (34Boonstra J. Moolenaar W.H. Harrison P.H. Moed P. van der Saag P.T. de Laat S.W. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). NGFI-B has been reported to be necessary for apoptosis in different cell types (20Li H. Kolluri S.K. Gu J. Dawson M.I. Cao X. Hobbs P.D. Lin B. Chen G. Lu J. Lin F. Xie Z. Fontana J.A. Reed J.C.

Osborne B.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial targeting of NGFI-B induces apoptosis in a human prostate cancer cell line (20Li H. Kolluri S.K. Gu J. Dawson M.I. Cao X. Hobbs P.D. Lin B. Chen G. Lu J. Lin F. Xie Z. Fontana J.A. Reed J.C. Zhang X. Science. 2000; 289: 1159-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that NGFI-B interacts with Bcl-2 by inducing a conformational change in Bcl-2, converting it from a protector to a killer (21Lin B. Kolluri S.K. Lin F. Liu W. Han Y.H. Cao X. Dawson M.I. Reed J.C. Zhang X.K. Cell. 2004; 116: 527-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). NGFI-B also has a role in alternative, non-apoptotic programmed cell death (33Castro-Obregon S. Rao R.V. del Rio G. Chen S.F. Poksay K.S. Rabizadeh S. Vesce S. Zhang X.K. Swanson R.A. Bredesen D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17543-17553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). NGFI-B functions in the nucleus to induce proliferation, whereas it acts on mitochondria to induce apoptosis (35Kolluri S.K. Bruey-Sedano N. Cao X. Lin B. Lin F. Han Y.H. Dawson M.I. Zhang X.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8651-8667Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). MEK kinase 1 was shown to activate c-Jun amino-terminal kinase, which phosphorylated TR3, reduced its DNA binding activity, and resulted in loss of mitogenic function. The present report adds a new pathway to the sorting of NGFI-B between subcellular compartments. When rat cerebellar granule neurons were treated with glutamate, NGFI-B translocated to the mitochondria. After adding EGF to the medium, this translocation was blocked. By introducing the MEK inhibitor U0126 to the rat cerebellar granule cells, the effect of EGF on glutamate-induced translocation was eliminated. Interestingly, our results suggest that NGFI-B is induced as well as directly regulated by EGF. An increased level of the NGFI-B protein may alert the cells to respond by this pathway in the course of the cell death program. By overexpressing ERK2 and NGFI-B in CV1 cells we have determined that ERK2 is involved in the translocation of NGFI-B. In conclusion, these results suggest that EGF may exert rapid neuroprotection in rat cerebellar granule cells through the MEK/ERK pathway by the effect of ERK2 on NGFI-B localization. Thus, activation of ERK2 may overcome apoptosis-induced subcellular translocation of NGFI-B. This finding represents a novel and rapid growth factor survival pathway that is independent of gene regulation. We thank Mona Gaarder for expert technical assistance."

The 125-residue p14 FAST protein of reptilian reovirus has an ∼38-residue myristoylated N-terminal ectodomain containing a moderately apolar N-proximal region, termed the hydrophobic patch. Mutagenic analysis indicated sequence-specific elements in the N-proximal portion of the p14 hydrophobic patch affected cell-cell fusion activity, independent of overall effects on the relative hydrophobicity of the motif. Circular dichroism (CD) of a myristoylated peptide representing the majority of the p14 ectodomain suggested this region is mostly disordered in solution but assumes increased structure in an apolar environment. From NMR spectroscopic data and simulated annealing, the soluble nonmyristoylated p14 ectodomain peptide consists of an N-proximal extended loop flanked by two proline hinges. The remaining two-thirds of the ectodomain peptide structure is disordered, consistent with predictions based on CD spectra of the myristoylated peptide. The myristoylated p14 ectodomain peptide, but not a nonmyristoylated version of the same peptide nor a myristoylated scrambled peptide, mediated extensive lipid mixing in a liposome fusion assay. Based on the lipid mixing activity, structural plasticity, environmentally induced conformational changes, and kinked structures predicted for the p14 ectodomain and hydrophobic patch (all features associated with fusion peptides), we propose that the majority of the p14 ectodomain is composed of a fusion peptide motif, the first such motif dependent on myristoylation for membrane fusion activity.

Complex, multimeric viral fusion proteins mediate the fusion of viral envelopes to target cell membranes during virus entry into cells (1White J.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 675-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Membrane destabilization during the fusion process is dependent on a fusion peptide motif contained within these enveloped virus fusion proteins (2Blumenthal R. Clague M.J. Durell S.R. Epand R.M.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Conversely, these motifs are embedded internally within the amino acid sequence of the class II fusion proteins (e.g. alphaviruses and flaviviruses) and the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (7Whitt M.A. Zagouras P.

Structural predictions for fusion peptides based on CD or infrared spectroscopy have yielded conflicting results (9Martin I. Defrise-Quertain F. Decroly E. Vandenbranden M. Brasseur R.

Tamm L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 13097-13102Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The properties of conformational flexibility and environmentally induced structural changes may represent essential features of fusion peptides, intimately linked to their function in the fusion process (4Tamm L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Davies S.M. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Bradshaw J.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425 (S. M.

(16Han X. Bushweller J.H. Cafiso D.S. Tamm L.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) used a host-guest peptide design to render the influenza virus HA fusion peptide water-soluble. This approach facilitated structural determination of the fusion peptide by NMR spectroscopy in the context of a hydrophobic environment (i.e. detergent micelles). The structure is characterized by an N-terminal α-helix (residues 2–10) and a turn (residues 11–13) at both neutral pH and the fusion-triggering low pH. Although the C-terminal arm of the fusion peptide does not form a regular structure at pH 7, it forms a short 310-helix (residues 14–18) at pH 5 (4Tamm L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Han X. Bushweller J.H. Cafiso D.S. Tamm L.K. Nat. Struct.

Chem. 2002; 277: 22725-22733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). At low pH, both helices are amphipathic and place all bulky hydrophobic residues on the inner side of the V-shaped structure to create a hydrophobic pocket. The outer side of the N-terminal α-helix comprises a ridge of glycine residues that has been hypothesized to be an essential component of HA-induced fusion pore formation (4Tamm L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Aside from influenza HA, the only other defined atomic-resolution structures of fusion peptides are the “fusion loops” of the class II fusion proteins, determined in the context of the entire ectodomain of these proteins (18Bressanelli S. Stiasny K. Allison S.L. Stura E.A. Duquerroy S. Lescar J. Heinz F.X. Rey F.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 728-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 19Gibbons D.L. Vaney M.-C. Roussel A. Vigouroux A.

Nature. 2004; 427: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Unlike the helical class I fusion peptides, the internal class II fusion loops appear to be extended, flexible structures in both the solvent-exposed and membrane-bound forms (19Gibbons D.L. Vaney M.-C. Roussel A. Vigouroux A. Reilly B. Lepault J. Kielian M. Rey F.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 20Modis Y. Ogata S. Clements D. Harrison S.C. Nature. 2004; 427: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic pocket created by the helix-hinge-helix structure of the influenza HA fusion peptide is replaced in the class II fusion peptides by a hydrophobic bowl flanked by β-strands at the tip of the loop. The loop structure may assume the same basic conformation in different environments, contrary to the significant pH- and membrane-dependent changes in the structure of the class I HA fusion peptides (4Tamm L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Gibbons D.L. Vaney M.-C. Roussel A. Vigouroux A. Reilly B. Lepault J. Kielian M. Rey F.A.

The reovirus fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins are a new family of membrane fusion proteins, the only fusion proteins encoded by nonenveloped viruses (21Shmulevitz M. Duncan R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 902-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 22Dawe S.J. Duncan R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2131-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23Corcoran J.A. Duncan R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4342-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The FAST proteins represent a distinct class of membrane fusion proteins that are easily distinguished from the enveloped virus class I and class II fusion proteins by their exceedingly small ectodomains (∼20–40 residues) (21Shmulevitz M. Duncan R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 902-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 22Dawe S.J. Duncan R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2131-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23Corcoran J.A. Duncan R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4342-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as nonstructural viral proteins, the FAST proteins do not play a role in virus-cell fusion but instead are dedicated to promoting cell-cell fusion and multinucleated syncytium formation following their expression in transfected or virus-infected cells (21Shmulevitz M. Duncan R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 902-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 22Dawe S.J. Duncan R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2131-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The reptilian reovirus (RRV) p14 FAST protein is a 14-kDa protein with an ∼38-residue ectodomain that is myristoylated at its N terminus (23Corcoran J.A. Duncan R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4342-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that the p14 ectodomain displays myristoylation- and sequence-specific lipid mixing and cell-cell fusion activity. Structural analyses of ectodomain peptides by NMR and CD spectroscopy revealed that the p14 ectodomain possesses structural plasticity, and a moderately apolar region near the N terminus of the p14 ectodomain contains an extended loop structure flanked by proline hinges. We suggest that over half of the small p14 ectodomain comprises an N-terminally myristoylated fusion peptide motif with a protruding loop that is intimately involved in the membrane fusion process. Cells, Virus, and Antibody—Reptilian reovirus was isolated from the kidney of a python (Python regius) (24Ahne W. Thomsen I. Winton J. Arch. Virol. 1987; 94: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and obtained from W. Ahne (University of Munich, Munich, Germany). Vero and QM5 cells were maintained in medium 199 as previously described (23Corcoran J.A. Duncan R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4342-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The production of p14 polyclonal antiserum was described previously (23Corcoran J.A. Duncan R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4342-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Materials—All lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. The p14 hydrophobic patch peptide (myr-GSGPSNFVNHAPGEAIVTGLE-KGADKVAGT-amide) was synthesized with either a myristate moiety or an acetyl group at the N terminus. The p14 scrambled peptide (myr-GSFGEHNSNAVPKGAET-VGLIKGDAVPAGT-amide) was synthesized with a myristoylated N terminus. All peptides were synthesized by Dalton Chemical Laboratories (Toronto, Ontario, Canada), and purified to >95% purity by high pressure liquid chromatography. Plasmids, Cloning, and Sequencing—The procedure for cloning of p14 from RRV and the creation of p14-G2A and p14-V9T were described previously (23Corcoran J.A. Duncan R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4342-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The pcDNA3-p14 clone was used as the template to generate all p14-substituted constructs using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All constructs were confirmed by cycle sequencing (Thermo-Sequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit, United States Biochemical) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection, Cell Staining, and Syncytial Indexing—Vero cells were used for transient transfection with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) 3 h after seeding (70% confluency) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell monolayers were fixed with methanol and stained at various times post-transfection with Wright-Giemsa stain. Alternately, fixed cell monolayers were immunostained using polyclonal anti-p14 antiserum as described previously (23Corcoran J.A. Duncan R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4342-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and visualized on a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope at a magnification of ×200. Image-Pro Plus software (version 4.0) was used to capture images of stained cells. The relative ability of various p14 mutants to mediate syncytium formation was quantified by a syncytial index assay. The numbers of syncytial foci and syncytial nuclei present in five random fields of view were determined by microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained transfected cell monolayers at ×100 magnification and then compared with authentic p14. Results were reported as the percent of syncytial nuclei induced by authentic p14 (± the standard error) from three separate experiments. The ability of authentic p14 to induce syncytia was reproducible with 6.4 ± 0.76 syncytial foci and 111.5 ± 13.1 syncytial nuclei from five separate experiments. Radiolabeling and Immune Precipitation—QM5 cells were labeled at 14 h post-transfection for 1 h with 50 μCi of [3H]leucine (Amersham Biosciences)/ml leucine-free medium (Invitrogen Select-Amine kit). Radiolabeled cell lysates were prepared using radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Igepal (Sigma), 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS) and protease inhibitors (200 nm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin) as described previously (23Corcoran J.A. Duncan R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4342-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using rabbit polyclonal anti-p14 serum, and precipitates were analyzed by SDS-15% PAGE and Me2SO-PPO fluorography as described previously (23Corcoran J.A. Duncan R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4342-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Fluorescent Cell Staining—QM5 cells seeded on coverslips were transfected with p14 expression plasmids, and 6 h post transfection, cell monolayers were fixed with ice-cold methanol and stained using rabbit polyclonal anti-p14 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunochemicals) as described previously (23Corcoran J.A. Duncan R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4342-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Stained cells were visualized and photographed using a Zeiss LSM510 scanning argon laser confocal microscope and the ×100 objective. Circular Dichroism—The CD spectra were recorded using an AVIV Model 215 circular dichroism spectrometer (Proterion Corp., Piscataway, NJ). The peptide sample at concentrations of 10–80 μm in water was contained in a 1-mm path-length quartz cell that was maintained at 25 °C in a thermostated cell holder. For samples containing lipid, the lipid was first made into a dry film from a solution of chloroform and methanol. The film was hydrated by vortexing and freeze-thawing, and the lipid suspension was then sonicated to clarity to make small unilamellar vesicles. Data were analyzed with the Self Consistent Method for CD Analysis, version 3 (Selcon 3) (25Sreerama N. Venyaminov S.Y. Woody R.W. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). The CD data are expressed as the mean residue ellipticity. Secondary structure was estimated with the program Selcon3. Lipid Mixing Assay for Membrane Fusion—The ability of p14 peptides to promote lipid mixing was assessed using the resonance energy transfer assay of Struck et al. (26Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar) with large (0.1 μm) unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), and cholesterol (1:1:1 molar ratio) (Avanti Polar Lipids) as described previously (27Shmulevitz M. Epand R.F. Epand R.M. Duncan R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2808-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). One population of LUVs was labeled with 2 mol % each of N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)phosphatidylethanolamine and N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)phosphatidylethanolamine, and a 9:1 molar ratio of unlabeled to labeled liposomes was used in the assay. Fluorescence was recorded in an SLM Aminco Bowman Series II spectrofluorimeter (Fig. 7, A and B) or a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter (Fig. 7C), with the excitation and emission wavelengths set at 465 and 530 nm, respectively. A freshly prepared solution of the peptide in water (the p14 peptide precipitated in the presence of salt) or Me2SO was added to 2 ml of water in the cuvette containing 25, 50, or 100 μm LUVs. Fluorescence was recorded for several minutes, and then 20 μlof 10% Triton X-100 was added (final concentration 0.1%) to obtain the maximum fluorescence intensity value (Fmax). The initial fluorescence intensity prior to addition of p14 peptide (or using Me2SO alone), F0, was taken as zero. Percent lipid mixing at time t is given by: [(Ft - F0)/(Fmax - F0)]100. Runs were done in duplicate. Vesicles were kept on ice and used immediately after preparation. Solution NMR Spectroscopy—Initially, two samples were prepared by dissolving 5 mg of lyophilized acetyl-p14 peptide or 0.5 mg of myristoylated p14 peptide in a 500-μl solution of a 90% H2O and 10% 2H2O buffered at pH 7.2 with a 50 mm potassium phosphate. 1H NMR data sets (one-dimensional, one-dimensional WATERGATE (28Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3486) Google Scholar), TOCSY (29Griesinger C. Otting G. Wuthrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem.

Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4808) Google Scholar), and WATERGATE E-COSY (31Griesinger C. Sorensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1987; 75: 474-492Google Scholar)) were collected at 5 °C on a Bruker AVANCE 500 spectrometer. A further six one-dimensional NMR data sets were recorded between the pH range of 3 and 10 for each of the two samples for 0 and 450 mm NaCl. The pH values for one-dimensional 1H NMR data were determined from a standardized pH electrode designed for NMR tubes. All data sets were processed using Bruker XWIN software on a Silicon Graphics workstation. NMR Structure Calculations—For the acetyl-p14 peptide, the majority of the distance constraints were obtained from the 250-ms NOESY spectra. Cross-peak intensities were classified as very strong, strong, medium, or weak and roughly corresponded to interproton distance ranges of <2.0, 1.75–2.75, 2.5–3.5, and 3.5–5.0 Å. In cases where stereospecific assignments were not available, distances were adjusted according to the pseudoatom position. A total of 148 unique inter-residue constraints (114 sequential, 27 intermediate range (i + 2, i + 4), and 10 long range) were obtained with 185 unique inter-residue NOESY connections that aided with the conformation of some side chains. The E-COSY spectrum was used to determine the NH-Hα and Hα-Hβ 3JHH′ couplings, which are necessary for determining NH-Hα and Hα-Hβ dihedral angles. All structural calculations were performed based on previous procedures (32Wang P.L. Donaire A. Zhou Z.H. Adams M.W.W. Lamar G.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11319-11328Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 33Sham S. Calzolai L. Wang P.L. Bren K. Haarklau H. Brereton P.S. Adams M.W.W. La Mar G.N.

Briefly, an initial extended structure was built and used to generate a total of 100 embedded structures. To remove close contacts, the embedded structures were minimized with 1000 steps of conjugate gradient before proceeding to the restrained simulated annealing molecular dynamics (MD) calculations. During MD calculations, peptide dihedral angles (61IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 3471-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar) were forced to a trans-configuration for all residues. A nonbonded cut-off distance of 4.5 Å was used. A total of eight steps with a total simulation time of 120 ps was used for the MD simulations. At the beginning, all of the force constants for bonded, NOE, dihedral angle, and nonbonded interactions were scaled down from their full values. By the end of the third step, the force constants were scaled to their full values. In the last five steps, the temperature was decreased uniformly from 1000 to 300 K. The calculated structures were minimized with 2000 steps of conjugate gradient methods. A total of 14 structures were retained that had no violations of NOE constraints >0.4 Å or dihedral angle constraints >30° (Fig. 5A). The overall quality of these refined structures was examined with the program PROCHECK (37Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 38Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

With the exceptions of the random coil (Gly14-Thr31) all of the backbone dihedral angles reside in the well defined, acceptable regions of the Ramachandran plot. Features of a Potential Fusion Peptide Motif in the Small Ectodomain of p14—The only region of the RRV p14 FAST protein that possesses any hydrophobic character, aside from the transmembrane domain, is the N-terminal 21 residues of the ectodomain (Fig. 1), a region we termed the hydrophobic patch (HP). This region also contains a high percentage of glycine and alanine residues (6 of 20 = 30%) typical of fusion peptides (1White J.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 675-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In addition, insertion of an HA epitope tag between residues seven and eight, or substitution of Val9 with serine, eliminated p14-induced syncytium formation (23Corcoran J.A. Duncan R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4342-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) indicating this region is sensitive to mutation and important for membrane fusion activity. These results lead us to suspect that the p14 HP might serve as a fusion peptide. However, the p14 HP is considerably less hydrophobic than what is typically observed for fusion peptides of enveloped viruses (1White J.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 675-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Furthermore, analysis using the whole-residue hydrophobicity scale of Wimley and White (40Wimley W.C. White S.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar), which predicts the preference of a region of a peptide chain to partition into the hydrated interface of a lipid bilayer, also led to the question of whether the p14 HP has inherent membrane interaction potential. Therefore, we conducted a more comprehensive structural and functional analysis of the p14 ectodomain to more clearly define the properties and role of the p14 HP in membrane fusion. The p14 Ectodomain Hydrophobic Patch Exerts a Sequence-specific Effect on Membrane Fusion—Although there is little direct sequence conservation in the fusion peptides of different enveloped viruses, these motifs are frequently sensitive to even conservative substitutions (5Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Martin I. Ruysschaert J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8800-8807Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 41Cross K.J. Wharton S.A. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Steinhauer D.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4432-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To more fully investigate the importance of the p14 HP in the mechanism of p14-mediated fusion, amino acids within this region were altered in the context of the whole p14 protein. All 12 of the altered p14 constructs were expressed to similar levels in transfected cells, as determined by radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti-p14 antiserum (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, a qualitative assessment of surface localization by immunofluorescence also revealed that all of the mutant p14 constructs were trafficked to the plasma membrane of transfected cells, as demonstrated for a subset of p14 constructs in Fig. 2D. Therefore, decreased fusion activity due to any of the substitutions was unlikely to be the result of altered upstream steps in p14-induced syncytium formation (e.g. protein expression or trafficking to the plasma membrane). The ability of each construct to mediate membrane fusion was assessed by quantifying the formation of multinucleated syncytia in transfected Vero cells, and the results were expressed as a percent of authentic p14 fusion ability (Fig. 2C). Several observations were noted from this mutagenic analysis. First, the fusion ability of each construct did not always correlate with the overall hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic patch (residues 2–21); fusion did not necessarily increase with a more hydrophobic motif or decrease with a more hydrophilic one. For example the N10A and H11A constructs were both more hydrophobic than authentic p14 and yet were fusion-impaired (Fig. 2C). These results suggested that the p14 ectodomain HP exerts a sequence-specific role(s) in the fusion process. Second, although certain residues were tolerant to substitution, residues clustered within the N-proximal portion of the p14 HP were particularly sensitive to substitution. For example, the P13A, G14A, and E15A substitutions all displayed normal levels of fusion activity (Fig. 2C). Conversely, the H11A substitution was only partially tolerated; although the rate of fusion mediated by H11A was significantly decreased (Fig. 2C), syncytium formation progressed to complet"

Here signals from the fission yeast stress-activated MAPK Spc1 are shown to regulate Cgs2, a negative regulator of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) pathway. Pathway integration is achieved via Spc1-dependent binding of Atf1-Pcr1 heterodimer to an M26 DNA site in the cgs2+ promoter, which remodels chromatin to regulate expression of cgs2+ and targets downstream of protein kinase A. This direct interpathway connection co-ordinates signals of nitrogen and carbon source depletion to affect a G0 cell-cycle checkpoint and sexual differentiation. The Atf1-Pcr1-M26 complex-dependent chromatin remodeling provides a molecular mechanism whereby Atf1-Pcr1 heterodimer can function differentially as either a transcriptional activator, or as a transcriptional repressor, or as an inducer of meiotic recombination. We also show that the Atf1-Pcr1-M26 complex functions as both an inducer and repressor of chromatin remodeling, which provides a way for various chromatin remodeling-dependent effector functions to be regulated.

In the presence of sufficient nutrients haploid cells of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe proliferate by mitotic division. In response to depleted nitrogen and carbon source, cells of opposite mating types conjugate, undergo karyogamy, enter meiosis, and produce haploid spores that remain metabolically dormant until nutritional conditions improve. Ste11 (a TR-box transcription factor) and Mei2 regulate the induction of a set of meiosis-specific genes; overexpression of mei2+ or ste11+ is sufficient to drive sexual differentiation ectopically, even under conditions where nutrients are not limiting (1Sugimoto A.

Components of the PKA and stress-activated MAPK pathways are structurally and functionally conserved from fission yeast to humans. The MAPK pathway is required for expression of some genes under control of the PKA pathway (17Stettler S. Warbrick E. Prochnik S. Mackie S. Fantes P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the molecular basis for this connection is unknown. Atf1 protein forms heterodimers with Pcr1 (Mts2) protein (12Wahls W.P. Smith G.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1693-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16Kanoh J. Watanabe Y. Ohsugi M. Iino Y. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), but each of these proteins can also form homodimers that bind to DNA (12Wahls W.P. Smith G.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1693-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Atf1 and Pcr1 harbor basic, leucine zipper (bZIP) motifs characteristic of dimeric, DNA-binding transcription factors of the CREB/ATF family. The pcr1 mutants also exhibit defects in sexual development (13Kon N. Schroeder S.C. Krawchuk M.D. Wahls W.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7575-7583Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 16Kanoh J. Watanabe Y. Ohsugi M. Iino Y. Yamamoto M.

Biol. 1996; 16: 704-711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Atf1 and Pcr1 may function together in sexual differentiation. However, some stress responses require only Atf1 or Pcr1 (not both) (13Kon N. Schroeder S.C. Krawchuk M.D. Wahls W.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7575-7583Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Kon N. Krawchuk M.D. Warren B.G. Smith G.R. Wahls W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13765-13770Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This indicates that Atf1, Pcr1, and other bZIP proteins can form different combinations of homodimers and heterodimers, each of which regulates the expression of a specific set of genes in response to a particular stimulus. Atf1-Pcr1 heterodimer binds with high affinity and specificity to a DNA site at the ade6-M26 meiotic recombination hotspot; single base pair mutations at the “M26” DNA site coordinately affect protein-DNA complex formation and hotspot activation (12Wahls W.P. Smith G.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1693-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). By extension, if a complex containing Atf1 and Pcr1 directly regulates the transcription of any particular gene in response to a given stress, then one would expect that gene to contain an Atf1-Pcr1 binding site whose mutation (at the endogenous locus) recapitulates the effect of loss of Atf1-Pcr1 heterodimer itself. Here we report that the Atf1-Pcr1 heterodimer directly links the stress-activated MAPK and cAMP-dependent kinase pathways by regulating cgs2+.

Cells were grown with good aeration at 32 °C in rich YEL medium (0.5% yeast extract, 3% glucose) or defined PM medium (containing nitrogen and essential growth factors) to a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml. For nitrogen starvation, cells grown in complete PM were transferred to PM medium lacking nitrogen, cultured with good aeration at 32 °C, and harvested at the time points indicated. Cells were processed immediately for analysis of chromatin structure, for preparation of protein extracts, or for fixation.

A mutated PCR product of 858 bp in length was cloned into pURA4, and clones were subject to DNA sequencing to confirm the presence of the desired mutations and to eliminate clones with spurious mutations. pURA4-cgs2+-EcoRI was linearized by digestion with HpaI.

Emura Y. Baur M. Kohli J. Ohta K. Shibata T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 876-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In brief, intact chromatin within isolated nuclei was treated with a range of concentrations of micrococcal nuclease (MNase: 0, 10, 20, and 30 units/ml). Nuclei were extracted, and DNA was deproteinized, digested to completion with PstI and ClaI, fractionated by gel electrophoresis, and subject to Southern blotting using a probe that hybridizes to the 3′-end of the PstI-ClaI restriction fragment of cgs2+. Chromatin treated without MNase (0 units/ml) served as a control to ensure that DNA cleavage was catalyzed by the MNase, rather than by endogenous nucleases. Naked DNA treated with MNase served as a control to ensure that preferential DNA cleavage was dependent upon chromatin proteins, rather than being directed by DNA sequence alone. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting Analysis of DNA Content—Cells were transferred from defined minimal medium containing nitrogen to minimal medium lacking nitrogen and further cultured for the indicated times. One-ml samples of each culture were harvested by centrifugation, the cells were fixed for at least 15 min at –20 °C in 70% ethanol, washed with H2O, and stained with 1 μm Sytox Green (Molecular Probes). Cell suspensions were sonicated for 15 s at power level 2 with a microtip Branson Sonifier prior to analysis using a FACSCalibur machine (BD Biosciences). Data analysis was conducted using ModFit v3.0 software (Verity Software House, Inc.) with FL1-H channel maximum set at 125. A candidate gene approach for targets of Atf1-Pcr1 was used. We searched S. pombe genomic DNA sequence for genes that met two criteria: First, the genes should contain at least one copy of the M26 DNA site in the promoter region. Second, there should be some indication (experimental or hypothetical) that the genes have a role in sexual differentiation in response to nutritional stress conditions. The cgs2+ (pde1+) gene was selected as a good candidate for further study: It was identified in a screen for mutants unable to undergo normal meiosis (26DeVoti J. Seydoux G. Beach D. McLeod M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3759-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and independently in a screen for S. pombe cDNA clones that could suppress the heat-shock-sensitive phenotypes of iraΔ mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (27Mochizuki N. Yamamoto M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 233: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 28Matviw H. Li J. Young D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Cgs2 protein is a phosphodiesterase that has a major role in regulating the single cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway of fission yeast (9Maeda T. Watanabe Y. Kunitomo H. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9632-9637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26DeVoti J. Seydoux G. Beach D. McLeod M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3759-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 28Matviw H.

Biol. 1995; 15: 1479-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cgs2 cleaves an essential cofactor (cyclic AMP) to negatively regulate PKA, which is itself a negative regulator of mating and meiosis. As a consequence, cgs2Δ null mutants are partially sterile and are unable to undergo meiosis. They also continue to grow in stationary phase under stress conditions in which wild-type cells undergo a G0 cell-cycle arrest (26DeVoti J. Seydoux G. Beach D. McLeod M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3759-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The presence of an M26 DNA site located at positions –66 to –72 of the cgs2+ promoter region (Fig. 2A) suggested to us that Atf1-Pcr1 heterodimer (and the nitrogen stress-activated MAPK cascade) helps to regulate cgs2+ (and the energy-sensing PKA cascade) in response to nutritional deprivation. Spc1-dependent Binding of Atf1-Pcr1 to M26 DNA Site of cgs2+—The core DNA sequence of the M26 site in the cgs2+ promoter is flanked by different base pairs (5′-AATATGACGTCAA-3′) than the core of the M26 site at ade6+ (5′-TGGATGACGTGAG-3′). Because base pairs flanking the core region may be essential for binding of Atf1-Pcr1 heterodimer (30Fox M.E. Yamada T. Ohta K. Smith G.R. Genetics. 2000; 156: 59-68PubMed Google Scholar), we determined whether Atf1-Pcr1 complex could bind to the M26 site at cgs2+ in the context of the different flanking sequences. A gel mobility shift assay using partially fractionated protein extracts and a DNA fragment from the cgs2+ promoter (Fig. 2A) revealed one predominant protein-DNA complex and a number of less abundant protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 2B). Mutation of two base pairs within the M26 DNA site abolished formation of the predominant protein-DNA complex, demonstrating that one or more proteins in the extract bind directly to the M26 DNA site located in the promoter of the cgs2+ gene. The less abundant complexes were insensitive to mutations within M26 (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the proteins responsible for those complexes bind DNA sites distant from M26. Protein extracts obtained from atf1Δ, pcr1Δ, and spc1Δ null mutants were unable to produce M26-specific protein-DNA complexes under conditions in which wild-type extracts exhibited robust binding (Fig. 2C). Thus, the Atf1, Pcr1, and Spc1 proteins are essential for formation of a protein-DNA complex at the M26 DNA site. The diagnostic, M26-dependent protein-DNA complex in wild-type extracts was supershifted entirely by the addition of α-Atf1 or α-Pcr1 antibodies, but not by the addition of corresponding preimmune serum (Fig. 2D). We conclude that Atf1-Pcr1 heterodimer binds directly to the M26 DNA site of cgs2+ and that the stress-activated MAPK Spc1 is required for formation of the Atf1-Pcr1-M26 complex. Atf1-Pcr1-M26 Complex Regulates Expression of cgs2+—The Atf1-Pcr1-M26 complex forms avidly at the cgs2+ promoter (Fig. 2). To test whether this complex regulates expression of cgs2+in vivo, we introduced a mutated M26 DNA site (cgs2-EcoRI) into the endogenous cgs2+ locus (Fig. 2A). Cells were subject to nitrogen starvation, and expression of cgs2+ mRNA was analyzed by reverse transcription, real-time, quantitative PCR (24Giulietti A. Overbergh L. Valckx D. Decallonne B. Bouillon R. Mathieu C. Methods. 2001; 25: 386-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). In wild-type cells a rapid induction of cgs2+ expression was observed (Fig. 3A). Disruption of the Atf1-Pcr1-M26 complex, either by ablation of the M26 site or by loss of either subunit of the Atf1-Pcr1 heterodimer, abolished the induction of cgs2+ mRNA in response to nitrogen starvation (Fig. 3A). We conclude that Atf1-Pcr1 heterodimer is a transcription factor that directly regulates a known component of the PKA pathway, cgs2+. Atf1-Pcr1-M26 Complex Mediates Chromatin Remodeling at cgs2+—The finding that Atf1-Pcr1 heterodimer is a transcription factor that induces expression of cgs2+ is intriguing, because Atf1-Pcr1 activates the ade6-M26 meiotic recombination hotspot without substantially affecting transcription at ade6 (19Kon N. Krawchuk M.D. Warren B.G. Smith G.R. Wahls W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13765-13770Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Atf1-Pcr1-dependent modification of chromatin structure could mediate such disparate outcomes (13Kon N. Schroeder S.C. Krawchuk M.D. Wahls W.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7575-7583Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Yamada T. Mizuno K.I. Hirota K. Kon N. Wahls W.P. Hartsuiker E. Murofushi H. Shibata T. Ohta K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1792-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We therefore used micrococcal nuclease (MNase) mapping (25Mizuno K. Emura Y. Baur M. Kohli J. Ohta K. Shibata T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 876-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to determine the chromatin configuration of the cgs2+ promoter region in response to nitrogen starvation in the presence or absence of the Atf1-Pcr1-M26 complex. Treatment of chromatin with MNase revealed five prominent MNase cleavage sites mapping to a ∼150-bp region of the cgs2+ promoter centered upon the M26 DNA site (Fig. 4). The prominent cleavage sites were not present in naked (deproteinized) DNA, demonstrating that they required chromatin. In wild-type cells DNA cleavage was enhanced at four of the MNase sites after nitrogen starvation, demonstrating stress-induced increases in the accessibility of DNA within chromatin. Intact Atf1-Pcr1 complex was required for the stress-induced chromatin remodeling at each of those four MNase cleavage sites; this chromatin remodeling correlated positively with complex-dependent, stress-induced transcription of cgs2+ (Fig. 3). Interestingly, loss of Atf1-Pcr1 heterodimer led to a constitutive increase (not inducible by nitrogen starvation) in DNA accessibility at MNase sites 1 and 2 (Fig. 4, B and C). Atf1-Pcr1-M26 complex either directly suppresses chromatin accessibility at those sites or loss of Atf1-Pcr1 heterodimer allows access for additional chromatin remodeling factors that are otherwise excluded by Atf1-Pcr1. We conclude that Atf1-Pcr1-M26 complex has dual specificity as both an inducer and repressor of chromatin remodeling. The preceding data demonstrate that Atf1-Pcr1-M26 complex functions as a mediator of chromatin remodeling and transcription activation at a nexus of the stress-activated MAPK and PKA pathways. To build upon this conclusion, we determined whether the Atf1-Pcr1-M26 complex transduces signals from the MAPK Spc1 to regulate cgs2+ and, if so, whether those signals were subsequently required for regulation of PKA pathway targets. Stress-activated Kinase Spc1 Regulates cgs2+via Atf1-Pcr1-M26 Complex—The Spc1 kinase binds to and phosphorylates Atf1 in vitro (32Shiozaki K. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 33Wilkinson M.G. Samuels M. Takeda T. Toone W.M. Shieh J.-C. Toda T. Millar J.B.A. Jones N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2289-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and is required for binding of Atf1-Pcr1 to the M26 DNA site of cgs2+ (Fig. 2). We therefore used quantitative PCR analyses to determine whether Atf1-Pcr1-M26-dependent transcription of cgs2+ also required the Spc1 kinase. Cells lacking Spc1 alone or in combination with deficiencies in the other factors were incapable of inducing cgs2+ gene expression in response to nitrogen starvation (Fig. 3A). These data confirm a link between the stress-activated kinase pathway and the Atf1-Pcr1-M26 complex at cgs2+. The single and triple mutant phenotypes were indistinguishable, demonstrating that the Spc1-dependent induction of cgs2+ transcription is mediated predominantly, if not exclusively, by Atf1-Pcr1-M26 complex. Regulation of Targets Downstream of the cAMP-dependent Kinase Pathway—Cgs2 is a phosphodiesterase that cleaves cAMP, which is an essential cofactor for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase PKA. If Atf1-Pcr1-M26 complex-dependent regulation of cgs2+ feeds into the cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway, then attenuation of cgs2+ should affect the regulation of factors known to be downstream of PKA. We therefore used quantitative PCR to determine whether expression of the ste11+ gene, which encodes an inducer of sexual differentiation known to be under the control of the PKA pathway, required components of the Atf1-Pcr1-M26 complex and the MAPK Spc1. Nitrogen starvation induced a 20-fold increase in ste11+ mRNA levels, and this induction was strictly dependent upon the simultaneous presence of Atf1, Pcr1, and the Spc1 kinase (Fig. 3B). The induction kinetics of ste11+ were substantially slower than those of cgs2+, suggesting that regulation of ste11+ is an indirect, secondary consequence of Atf1-Pcr1 heterodimer functioning elsewhere. In support of this inference, there are no obvious binding sites for Atf1-Pcr1 heterodimer in the ste11+ promoter region and gel shift assays with ste11+ promoter fragments failed to reveal any Atf1-Pcr1-dependent protein-DNA interactions (data not shown). Notably, Spc1-dependent, Atf1-Pcr1-dependent induction of ste11+ transcription was strictly dependent upon the M26 DNA site of cgs2+ (Fig. 3B). We conclude that there is a direct connection between the MAPK and PKA signal transduction pathways and that this connection is mediated by the action of Atf1-Pcr1-M26 complex in the promoter of the cgs2+ gene (Fig. 1). The Interpathway Connection Regulates a G0 Cell Cycle Arrest—Stress-activated MAPK Spc1 and Atf1-Pcr1 heterodimer likely have multiple targets, so it was necessary to determine the biological relevance of the M26 DNA site at cgs2+. In fission yeast sexual differentiation is entered from the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In response to nutritional starvation diploid cells heterozygous at mat1 (the mating type locus) enter meiosis, whereas haploids or diploids homozygous at mat1 enter a G0 (G1) cell cycle arrest (5Yamamoto M. Cell Struct. Function. 1996; 21: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the presence of partners of opposite mating type the haploids in G0 conjugate and enter meiosis; otherwise, they remain at G0 arrest and can maintain viability for extended periods of time. The cgs2 null mutants (and other mutants that cannot repress the PKA pathway) fail to arrest in G0, and this likely contributes to their partial sterility (26DeVoti J. Seydoux G. Beach D. McLeod M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3759-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Similarly, the atf1Δ and pcr1Δ mutants are partially sterile and lose viability under stress, perhaps as a result of inability to arrest in G0 (16Kanoh J. Watanabe Y. Ohsugi M. Iino Y. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 18Watanabe Y. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 704-711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Takeda T. Toda T. Kominami K. Kohnosu A. Yanagida M. Jones N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6193-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the biological consequences of Atf1-Pcr1-M26 complex acting on the cgs2+ promoter, we examined cell cycle regulation in response to nitrogen starvation. The majority of wild-type cells entered G0 arrest by 16 h (Fig. 5A). Mutation of the cis-acting M26 site in the cgs2+ promoter reduced significantly the fraction of cells entering G0 arrest (Fig. 5B), demonstrating that M26 DNA site-dependent regulation of cgs2+ transcription is biologically meaningful. Loss of Atf1 or Pcr1 (or both) had similar consequences and there was no additivity of phenotypes in double mutants lacking M26 and Atf1 or Pcr1, again demonstrating a linear, dependent pathway relationship. Loss of Spc1 kinase eliminated the G0 arrest at 16 h (Fig. 5B), so it was not possible to make conclusions about pathway dependence from cell cycle data of double mutants harboring the spc1Δ allele. It is clear from the data, however, that signals from Spc1 kinase that are required for G0 arrest are not transduced exclusively via Atf1-Pcr1-M26 complex acting on the cgs2+ promoter. This is not surprising, because Spc1 kinase affects many downstream targets, of which only a subset would likely be dependent upon Atf1 and/or Pcr1.

https://openalex.org/W2150698354,"We examined the effect of conformational change at the β7 I-like/hybrid domain interface on regulating the transition between rolling and firm adhesion by integrin α4β7. An N-glycosylation site was introduced into the I-like/hybrid domain interface to act as a wedge and to stabilize the open conformation of this interface and hence the open conformation of the α4 β7 headpiece. Wild-type α4β7 mediates rolling adhesion in Ca2+ and Ca2+/Mg2+ but firm adhesion in Mg2+ and Mn2+. Stabilizing the open headpiece resulted in firm adhesion in all divalent cations. The interaction between metal binding sites in the I-like domain and the interface with the hybrid domain was examined in double mutants. Changes at these two sites can either counterbalance one another or be additive, emphasizing mutuality and the importance of multiple interfaces in integrin regulation. A double mutant with counterbalancing deactivating ligand-induced metal ion binding site (LIMBS) and activating wedge mutations could still be activated by Mn2+, confirming the importance of the adjacent to metal ion-dependent adhesion site (ADMIDAS) in integrin activation by Mn2+. Overall, the results demonstrate the importance of headpiece allostery in the conversion of rolling to firm adhesion.

Integrins are a family of heterodimeric adhesion molecules with noncovalently associated α and β subunits that mediate cell-cell, cell-matrix, and cell-pathogen interactions and that signal bidirectionally across the plasma membrane (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar, 2Takagi J. Springer T.A. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 141-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The affinity of integrin extracellular domains is dynamically regulated by “inside-out” signals from the cytoplasm. Furthermore, ligand binding can induce “outside-in” signaling and activate many intracellular signaling pathways (3Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A.

Cell. 2002; 110: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Integrin extracellular domains exist in at least three distinct global conformational states that differ in affinity for ligand (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4607-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar); the equilibrium among these different states is regulated by the binding of integrin cytoplasmic domains to cytoskeletal components and signaling molecules (4Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar, 6Vinogradova O. Velyvis A. Velyviene A. Hu B. Haas T.A. Plow E.F. Qin J. Cell. 2002; 110: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Integrin affinity regulation is accompanied by a series of conformational rearrangements. Electron micrographic studies of integrins αVβ3 and α5β1 demonstrate that ligand binding, in the absence of restraining crystal lattice contacts, induces a switchblade-like extension of the extracellular domain and a change in angle between the I-like and hybrid domains (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 7Takagi J. Strokovich K. Springer T.A. Walz T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4607-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Recent crystal structures of integrin αIIbβ3 in the open, high affinity conformation demonstrate that the C-terminal α7-helix of the β I-like domain moves axially toward the hybrid domain, causing the β hybrid domain to swing outward by 60°, away from the α subunit (8Xiao, T., Takagi, J., Wang, J.-h., Coller, B. S., and Springer, T. A. (2004) 432, 59–67Google Scholar). This conversion from the closed to the open conformation of the ligand-binding domains in the integrin headpiece also destabilizes the bent conformation and induces integrin extension in which the headpiece extends and breaks free from an interface with the leg domains that connect it to the plasma membrane. To stabilize the outward swing of the hybrid domain and the high affinity open headpiece conformation, glycan wedges have been introduced into the interface between the hybrid and I-like domains of β3 and β1 integrins (9Luo B-H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The relation between hybrid domain swing-out and high integrin affinity has also been strongly supported by the study of an allosteric inhibitory β1 integrin antibody SG19, which binds to the outer side of the I-like hybrid domain interface and prevents hybrid domain swing-out as shown by electron micrographic image averages (10Luo B-H. Strokovich K. Walz T. Springer T.A. Takagi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27466-27471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Allosteric inhibition by this mAb 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; MIDAS, metal ion-dependent adhesion site; LIMBS, ligand-induced metal binding site; ADMIDAS, adjacent to MIDAS; LMA, LIMBS, MIDAS, and ADMIDAS; MAdCAM-1, mucosal cell adhesion molecule-1. was confirmed because it did not inhibit ligand binding to the low affinity state but rather inhibited conversion to the high affinity state. Binding of SG19 mAb to the β1 wedge mutant was dramatically decreased compared with wild-type, further supporting induction of hybrid domain swing-out by the wedge mutant. Conversely, allosteric activating mAbs have been shown to map to the face of the β hybrid domain that is closely opposed to the α subunit in the closed conformation and therefore appear to induce the high affinity state by favoring hybrid domain swing-out (11Mould A.P.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) also support the conclusion that downward displacement of the α7-helix induces high affinity for ligand. A homologous α7-helix displacement in integrin α subunit I domains similarly induces high affinity for ligand (14Springer T.A. Wang J-h. Garcia K.C. Cell Surface Receptors. Elsevier, San Diego, CA2004: 29-63Google Scholar). It has long been known that integrin affinity for ligand is strongly influenced by metal ions, and recently the basis for this regulation has been deduced for the integrin α4β7 (15Chen J.F. Salas A. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The integrin α4β7 binds the cell surface ligand mucosal cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) and mediates rolling adhesion by lymphocytes in postcapillary venules in mucosal tissues and the subsequent firm adhesion in endothelium and trans-endothelial migration. These key steps in lymphocyte trafficking in vivo can be mimicked in vitro by introducing α4β7 transfected cells into parallel wall flow chambers with MAdCAM-1 coated on the lower wall. In Ca2+ and Ca2+/Mg2+, α4β7 mediates rolling adhesion, whereas in Mg2+, Mn2+, or when α4β7 is activated from within the cell, α4β7 mediates firm adhesion (15Chen J.F. Salas A. Springer T.A. Nat.

Mutation of these residues in β7, and studies of synergy between Ca2+ and Mg2+ and competition between Ca2+ and Mn2+, revealed the following (15Chen J.F. Salas A. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). 1) The middle of the three linearly arrayed sites, the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), is absolutely required for rolling and firm adhesion, and it can bind to MAdCAM-1 (and presumably coordinate) either through Ca2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+. 2) The adjacent to MIDAS (ADMIDAS) metal ion binding site functions as a negative regulatory site that stabilizes rolling adhesion. Its mutation results in firm adhesion in Ca2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+. Furthermore, Ca2+ exerts negative regulation at high concentrations at this site by favoring the closed I-like domain conformation, and Mn2+ activates integrins by competing with Ca2+ at this site and favoring an alternative coordination geometry seen in the open I-like domain conformation. 3) The ligand-induced metal binding site (LIMBS) functions as a positive regulatory site that favors firm adhesion. Its mutation results in rolling adhesion in Ca2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+. Furthermore, synergism between low concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ results from their binding to the LIMBS and MIDAS, respectively. Despite these advances in understanding the mechanism by which metal ions stabilize alternative conformations of integrin β I-like domains, several issues remain unresolved. How do the closed and open conformations of the α4β7 headpiece affect rolling and firm adhesion? Does metal ion occupancy at the LIMBS and ADMIDAS or outward swing of the hybrid domain have the strongest effect on I-like domain conformation? If changes occur at both metal binding sites and the I-like/hybrid domain interface, does one dominate the other, or can they be counterbalancing or additive? Here we address these questions and the importance of allostery at the I-like/hybrid domain interface by introducing a glycan wedge mutation into the β7 subunit to stabilize the open conformation of this interface.

Flow Chamber Assay—A polystyrene Petri dish was coated with a 5-mm diameter, 20-μl spot of 5 μg/ml purified h-MAdCAM-1/Fc in coating buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 10 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.0) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by 2% human serum albumin in coating buffer for 1 h at 37 °C to block nonspecific binding sites (16de Chateau M.

Cells were diluted to 1 × 106/ml in buffer A containing different divalent cations immediately before infusion in the flow chamber using a syringe pump. Cells were allowed to accumulate for 30 s at 0.3 dyne cm-2. Then, shear stress was increased every 10 s from 1 up to 32 dynes cm-2 in 2-fold increments. The number of cells remaining bound at the end of each 10-s interval was determined. Rolling velocity at each shear stress was calculated from the average distance traveled by rolling cells in 3 s. To avoid confusing rolling with small amounts of movement due to tether stretching or measurement error, a velocity of 2 μm/s, which corresponds to a movement of 1/2 cell diameter during the 3-s measurement interval, was the minimum velocity required to define a cell as rolling instead of firmly adherent (26Salas A.

Activation of α4β7 with a Glycan Wedge Mutation—The mutation Gln-324 → Thr in β7 introduced an N-glycosylation site at Asn-322 in the α4–β5 loop of the I-like domain (Fig. 1A), the same position as used previously for the wedge mutant in the highly homologous β3 subunit (9Luo B-H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Crystal structures have been defined for the β3 I-like/hybrid domain interface in both closed low affinity and open high affinity conformations (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A.

In the β3 subunit, the identical Asn residue has 5-fold more solvent-accessible surface area as determined with a 1.4-Å probe radius to simulate a water molecule in the open conformation (Fig. 1C) than in the closed conformation (Fig. 1B) of the hybrid/I-like interface. To approximate the size of the first four carbohydrate residues of an N-linked glycan, we used a 10-Å probe radius (see “Materials and Methods”), and we found that the Asn side chain was accessible in the open but not the closed conformation, as would be expected from visual inspection of the interface (Fig. 1, B and C). Similarly to other wedge mutants (9Luo B-H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the α4β7 wedge mutant was expressed somewhat less well than wild type in 293T transfectants (Table I). Immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE of [35S]cysteine- and -methionine-labeled α4β7 showed a 3,000 Mr increase for the Q324T mutant β7 subunit compared with wild type, confirming N-glycosylation of the introduced site (Fig. 1D).Table IExpression of α4β7 mutantsNameMutationExpression% WTWild type100 ± 12Glycan wedgeQ324T47 ± 3LIMBSD237A99 ± 20Wedge/LIMBSQ324T/D237A38 ± 10ADMIDASD147A70 ± 9Wedge/ADMIDASQ324T/D147A35 ± 8 Open table in a new tab During maturation and processing of α4β1 and α4β7, a portion of the intact α4 subunit, which migrates at 150,000 and 180,000 Mr, is cleaved to fragments of 80,000 and 70,000 Mr (28Holzmann B.

Activation of T lymphocytes increases cleavage of the α4 subunit (29Teixido J. Parker C.M. Kassner P.D. Hemler M.E. J. Biol.

Interestingly, addition of the glycan wedge markedly increased α4 subunit cleavage from 51% (wild type) to 90% (Q324T mutant) (Fig. 1C and Table II). This finding directly demonstrates that α4 integrin activation (see below) enhances proteolytic processing of the α4 subunit. This could result either from greater exposure of the cleavage site in open, extended α4β7 or longer residence in the post-endoplasmic reticulum compartments where processing occurs (34Bednarczyk J.L. Szabo M.C. McIntyre B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25274-25281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table IIEffect of the glycan wedge in α4β7 on cleavage of α4 subunitRadioactivity in each α4 subunit bandCleavageα4/180α4/150α4/80α4/70%WT1039252651Q324T28414990 Open table in a new tab The adhesive behavior in shear flow of 293T α4β7 cell transfectants was characterized by allowing them to adhere to MAdCAM-1 in a parallel wall flow chamber, incrementally increasing the wall shear stress, and determining the velocity of the adherent cells. In 1 mm Ca2+, 293T transient transfectants expressing wild-type α4β7 rolled with increasing velocity as shear stress was increased (Fig. 2). By contrast, wild-type transfectants were firmly adherent in 1 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 2). In Mn2+, adhesiveness was more activated than in Mg2+ because more cells accumulated and fewer cells detached at the highest wall shear stress of 32 dynes/cm2. By contrast with wild type, the α4β7 Q324T glycan wedge mutant mediated firm adhesion regardless of the divalent cation present (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the accumulation efficiency and shear resistance of the wedge mutant was identical in Ca2+, Ca2+/Mg2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ and similar to that of the wild-type α4β7 293T transfectants in Mn2+. Thus, integrin α4β7 was constitutively activated by the glycan wedge introduced into the hybrid/I-like domain interface. Mutation of the α4 cleavage site residue Arg-558 abolishes α4 subunit cleavage and has no effect on α4β1 adhesion on fibronectin or VCAM-1 (29Teixido J. Parker C.M. Kassner P.D. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1786-1791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Bergeron E. Basak A. Decroly E. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We tested the effect of the same mutation in α4β7 transfectants, and we found it to have no effect on adhesion in shear flow to MAdCAM-1 (data not shown). As described previously (15Chen J.F. Salas A. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), mutation of LIMBS residues stabilizes integrin α4β7 in the low affinity state. For example, the LIMBS mutant D237A mediates rolling adhesion regardless of the divalent cations that are present (Fig. 3A). The wedge/LIMBS double mutant (Q324T/D237A) was expressed as well as the wedge mutant in 293T transfectants (Table I). Compared with the LIMBS mutation, the wedge/LIMBS double mutation reproducibly increased the number of firmly adherent cells at low shear (1 and 2 dynes cm-2) in Ca2+/Mg2+ and Mg2+ (Fig. 3). In Mn2+, the wedge/LIMBS mutant mediated firm adhesion, whereas the LIMBS mutant mediated rolling adhesion (Fig. 3). These data show that the LIMBS is required for full activation by the wedge mutation in Ca2+, Ca2+/Mg2+, and Mg2+ (Q324T/D237A mutant in Fig. 3A compared with Q324T mutant in Fig. 2). Furthermore, activation by Mn2+ of the double wedge/LIMBS Q324T/D237A mutant definitively establishes that the LIMBS is not required for activation by Mn2+. Increased Firm Adhesion by Double ADMIDAS/Wedge Mutant—Mutation of the negative regulatory ADMIDAS activates firm adhesion even in Ca2+ (15Chen J.F. Salas A. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) (D147A mutant in Fig. 4 compared with wild type in Fig. 2). The double wedge/ADMIDAS Q324T/D147A mutant was somewhat less well expressed than the ADMIDAS D147A mutant (Table I). Nonetheless, the double Q324T/D147A mutant showed more firmly adherent cells in Ca2+ and Mn2+ than did the single D147A mutant (Fig. 4) or the single Q324T mutant (Fig. 2). Allosteric transition to the high affinity integrin headpiece conformation is proposed to involve rearrangement of the β I-like LIMBS, MIDAS, and ADMIDAS (LMA) sites, downward displacement of the β I-like α7-helix that connects to the hybrid domain, and outward swing of the β hybrid domain (5Takagi J.

Outward swing of the hybrid domain has been demonstrated by electron micrographic studies of liganded αVβ3 and α5β1 integrins and crystal studies of liganded αIIbβ3 but not in an αVβ3 crystal structure in which crystal lattice and headpiece-leg interactions presumably prevented swing-out when a ligand was soaked into crystals (8Xiao, T., Takagi, J., Wang, J.-h., Coller, B. S., and Springer, T. A. (2004) 432, 59–67Google Scholar, 18Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). Conversely, introduction of a glycan wedge into the β1 and β3 subunits has been demonstrated to induce high affinity for ligand by α5β1 and αIIbβ3 integrins (9Luo B-H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Both of these integrins recognize ligands with RGD sequences. We have extended these results here to the α4β7 integrin, which does not recognize RGD in its ligands and which mediates both rolling and firm adhesion. In α4β7, the glycan wedge converted rolling adhesion in Ca2+ and Ca2+/Mg2+ to firm adhesion, demonstrating that stabilizing the open conformation at the I-like/hybrid domain interface is sufficient to stabilize high affinity firm adhesion. Furthermore, we examined here for the first time the interplay between the LMA metal binding sites at the ligand-binding interface on the “top” of the β I-like domain and the interface with the hybrid domain on the opposite, “bottom” face of the I-like domain. We asked whether one of these two interfaces would dominate regulation of rolling or firm adhesion, or whether there would be mutuality in which mutations in each of these interfaces influenced the equilibrium between rolling and firm adhesion. The results demonstrate the latter. That is, stabilization of rolling adhesion by LIMBS mutation was partially counteracted by the wedge mutation in Ca2+/Mg2+ and Mg2+ and fully counteracted in Mn2+, where firm adhesion occurred. Conversely, stabilization of firm adhesion by the wedge mutation was fully counteracted by the LIMBS mutation in Ca2+, where rolling occurred, and largely counteracted in Ca2+/Mg2+ and Mg2+. Therefore, the equilibrium at the LMA sites strongly influences that at the β I-like/hybrid domain interface and vice versa, and changes in equilibrium at one site can counterbalance those at the other. The combined effects of the ADMIDAS and wedge mutations also demonstrated additive effects at the LMA sites and I-like/hybrid interface because changes at both of these sites stabilized firm adhesion more strongly than changes at either alone. Another notable finding of these studies is that Mn2+ can still activate firm adhesion when the LIMBS is mutated. Previously, the LIMBS and ADMIDAS were found to be positive and negative regulatory sites, respectively, and positive regulation by low Ca2+ concentrations was found to be intact when the ADMIDAS was mutated (15Chen J.F. Salas A. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This, together with structural considerations, suggested that negative regulation by high Ca2+ concentrations was effected at the ADMIDAS. Scatchard plots showed competitive rather than noncompetitive inhibition by Ca2+ of stimulation by Mn2+, suggesting that the ADMIDAS was also the stimulatory site for Mn2+. However, it was not possible to confirm the role of the ADMIDAS in stimulation of firm adhesion by Mn2+ because rolling adhesion occurred in LIMBS mutants even in Mn2+. By contrast, in the double LIMBS/wedge mutant, the equilibrium between rolling and firm adhesion is not far from that in wild type, and it is regulated by divalent cations. Mn2+ was found to fully activate firm adhesion by the LIMBS/wedge mutant, showing that the LIMBS is not required for regulation by Mn2+ and providing strong support for the previous conclusion that the ADMIDAS is the site for activation by Mn2+. Although much progress has been made recently in defining different integrin conformational states, questions remain about how signals are transduced from the cytoplasm to the ligand binding site and whether intermediate conformational states have intermediate affinity for ligand. It appears that to mediate rolling adhesion, integrins must be in one of the extended conformations rather than in the bent conformation (15Chen J.F. Salas A. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 37Salas A. Shimaoka M. Kogan A.N. Harwood C. von Andrian U.H. Springer T.A. Immunity. 2004; 20: 393-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The extended conformation with the closed headpiece is an intermediate in the conformational pathway between the bent conformation, which contains a closed headpiece, and the extended conformation with the open headpiece (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). The current study demonstrates that stabilization of the open headpiece by a glycan wedge at the β I-like/hybrid interface is sufficient to convert low affinity rolling adhesion to high affinity firm adhesion. It appears that the glycan wedge converts the extended conformation with the closed headpiece to the extended conformation with the open headpiece. Therefore, this study strongly suggests that within the extended integrin conformation, conversion of the closed to the open headpiece is sufficient to convert rolling adhesion to firm adhesion. In an intact integrin, marked separation in the plane of the membrane of the transmembrane domains of the integrin α and β subunits would also stabilize the open headpiece and therefore may be the mechanism for converting rolling adhesion to firm adhesion.

Here, we have reported the crystal structure of the biopterin-induced inhibitory complex of GTPCHI and GFRP and compared it with the previously reported phenylalanine-induced stimulatory complex. The structure reveals five biopterin molecules located at each interface between GTPCHI and GFRP. Induced fitting structural changes by the biopterin binding expand large conformational changes in GTPCHI peptide segments forming the active site, resulting in inhibition of the activity.

GFRP, which is a homopentamer (50 kDa), binds GTPCHI to mediate feedback inhibition by BH4 and feed-forward stimulation by phenylalanine (11Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K.

Gel filtration experiments have suggested that the resulting BH4-induced inhibitory or phenylalanine-induced stimulatory complex contains two GFRP pentamers and one GTPCHI decamer (14Hatakeyama K.

Bacterial GTPCHI catalyzes the first step in the de novo synthesis of folic acid, compared with BH4 in animals. The Escherichia coli GTPCHI molecule consists of two GTPCHI pentamers that are positioned in a head-to-head manner to form the active decameric enzyme with pseudo 52-point group symmetry (17Nar H.

This architecture has also been found in the animal GTPCHI structures (19Auerbach G. Herrmann A. Bracher A. Bader G. Gütlich M. Fischer M. Neukamm M. Garrido-Franco M. Richardson J. Nar H. Huber R.

Okada K. Hatakeyama K. Hakoshima T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1212-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The complex structure also revealed that the active site configuration of the stimulatory complex is similar to that of E. coli GTPCHI, which exists in an active form, indicating that GFRP and phenylalanine stabilize the active configuration of rat GTPCHI. In this study, we have reported a 2.8 Å crystal structure of the BH2-induced inhibitory complex of rat GTPCHI and GFRP. The structure reveals BH2-induced structural changes that further our understanding of how this protein complex regulates enzyme activity at the atomic level and how mutations isolated from patients cause hyperphenylalaninemia and DRD.MATERIALS AND METHODSProtein Purification and Crystallization—Rat GTPCHI and GFRP were expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (16Yoneyama T. Hatakeyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20102-20108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Crystals of the inhibitory complex were obtained as previously reported (21Maita N. Okada K. Hirotsu S. Hatakeyama K. Hakoshima T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1153-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For crystallization, BH2 and dGTP were used rather than BH4 and GTP because BH2 is much more stable in solution than BH4 and dGTP is not hydrolyzed by GTPCHI. The effects of these analogues on the formation of the inhibitory complex are comparable with those of BH4 and GTP, respectively (16Yoneyama T. Hatakeyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20102-20108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Data Collection—The crystal was transferred into a cryoprotectant solution (14% isopropanol, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 10% polyethylene glycol 300, 10% ethylene glycol, and 0.1 m MES-Na, pH 6) and then rapidly frozen by transferring into liquid nitrogen. During the data collection, the crystal atmosphere was maintained at 100 K with a cryostream. The x-ray diffraction data were collected at BL41XU of SPring-8. Measurements of x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectra of the crystals indicated the presence of zinc ions in the crystals. Following the XAFS measurements, we collected an intensity data set with the wavelength of the K absorption peak for the zinc atom (λ = 1.2818 Å) to verify the zinc ion positions on an anomalous difference Fourier map. The data were processed with MOSFLM (22Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The pseudo D5 symmetry of the arrangement of 10 GTPCHI subunits was identified in solutions of a rotation function calculated with the resolution range of 10-5 Å and an integration vector of 40 Å. The model was refined with crystallography NMR software (25Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J.

Clear electron densities for two GFRP pentamers were found in the map. The model was further refined by rounds of manual rebuilding with O (26Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar) and simulated annealing. The electron densities of the BH2 molecules were found at the interfaces of GTPCHI and GFRP in an initial Fo - Fc map. The refinement statistics are presented in Table I, Table II. The structure consists of one GTPCH decamer (residues 48-241 for each subunit), two GFRP pentamers (residues 1-84 for each subunit), ten BH2 molecules, ten zinc ions, ten sodium ions, and ten triphosphate parts of dGTP. The N-terminal regions (residues 12-48) of all GTPCHI subunits are disordered as observed in those of the stimulatory complex. Tentative sodium ions were found inside loop β1-β2 (residues 9-14) of GFRP. In the stimulatory complex, these sites were occupied by potassium ions.

Open table in a new tab RESULTSOverall Structure of the Inhibitory Complex—The inhibitory complex consists of one GTPCHI decamer (residues 48-241 for each subunit) and two GFRP pentamers (residues 1-84 for each subunit) (Fig. 1A). As in the previous GTPCHI structures, the GTPCHI monomer in our complex consists of an α-helical domain (αa-αd) and an α+β domain formed by five α-helices (αe-αi) and four β-strands (β1-β4) (Fig. 2A). These β-strands comprise a 20-stranded antiparallel β-barrel bearing a pseudo 5-fold axis in the GTPCHI pentamer. The GFRP monomer forms an (α+β) structure with a ββαββαββ topology. Five GFRP monomers form a homo-oligomeric 5-fold β-propeller structure where each monomer represents a blade of the propeller in the classical β-propeller protein. Two GFRP pentamers are docked at the top and bottom molecular surfaces of the torus-shaped GTPCHI decamer, sharing the same 5-fold axis. This sandwich structure, (GFRP)5-(GTPCHI)10-(GFRP)5, is essentially similar to that of the stimulatory complex (Fig. 1B) though several significant structural differences are found and will be discussed later.Fig. 2BH2 binding in the inhibitory complex.

Loop β3-β4 contacts GTPCHI at the outer region of the interfaces between GFRP and GTPCHI, whereas loops β1-β2 and β5-β6 make contact with GTPCHI at the innermost region of the interfaces. As in the stimulatory complex (20Maita N. Okada K. Hatakeyama K. Hakoshima T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1212-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), ten zinc ions (Fig. 1, red balls) were found at the active sites in the inhibitory complex and were verified on an anomalous difference Fourier map calculated with the data set collected with a wavelength for the K absorption edge of zinc atoms.Biopterin-binding Site—Biopterin is an essential ligand for the formation of the inhibitory complex (11Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260: 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 16Yoneyama T. Hatakeyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20102-20108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Ten BH2 molecules were found at each of the GTPCHI-GFRP interfaces (Fig. 1A). This observed stoichiometry is consistent with the results from previous studies that dealt with the binding of BH4 to the protein complex (30Yoneyama T. Hatakeyama K. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Like the phenylalanine molecules in the stimulatory complex (20Maita N. Okada K. Hatakeyama K. Hakoshima T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1212-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the BH2 molecules in our complex are completely buried inside the interfaces. The total buried accessible surface area of each GFRP-GTPCHI interface, including the five trapped BH2 molecules, was increased to 7,322 Å2, which is significantly larger than that area (4,546 Å2) without the BH2 molecules. Thus, BH2 binding enhances the association of GFRP with GTPCHI by occupying the spaces at the interfaces to increase the contact area.Interestingly, the BH2-binding sites are located at the molecular surface of GTPCHI rather than GFRP. The bound BH2 molecules make extensive interactions with GTPCHI, resulting in conformational changes in GTPCHI. This is in contrast to the phenylalanine-binding sites found in the stimulatory complex, where the GFRP pentamer forms phenylalanine binding cavities to accommodate the phenyl group (Fig. 1B). Each BH2 binding pocket is formed by a cleft between two neighboring GTPCHI subunits, designated A and B (Fig. 2B). These consist of the C-terminal region (residues 220-234) spanning β-strand 4, α-helices h and i from both subunits, and flanking regions of β-strands 1 and 2 (residues 118-120 and 148-150, respectively) from subunit B. The pterin ring of BH2 is located within the cleft and forms hydrogen bonds between the pyrimidine part of the ring and Glu-234(B) located at the bottom of the cleft. These interactions are reminiscent of those between a heme carboxylate and the pyrimidine part of the pterin in the nitric oxide synthase pterin-binding site (6Wei C.C. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2365-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). All hydrogen donor and acceptor atoms of the pterin ring participate in hydrogen bonding interactions (Fig. 2C). Two water molecules were found to mediate the interactions between BH2 and GTPCHI. Asp-118(B) and Arg-226(A) form direct hydrogen bonds with BH2 as well as a water (WAT2)-mediated hydrogen bond. Arg-232(A), which interacts with Glu-224(B), forms direct bonds with BH2. Arg-232(A) and Asp-228(B) trap another water molecule (WAT1), which mediates two hydrogen bonds to BH2. The main chain of Ser-219(A) and the side chain of Thr-231(B) participate in direct hydrogen bonds to BH2. It is noteworthy that the pyrimidine part of the pterin ring is associated with eight hydrogen bonds. This extensive interaction is consistent with the fact that inhibitory complex formation is induced by 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine and analogs that contain a pyrimidine structure like that found in biopterin (13Yoneyama T. Wilson L.M. Hatakeyama K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Structural Changes in GFRP—Compared with the GFRP structure in the stimulatory complex, no global structural change was found in the monomer and pentamer of GFRP in the inhibitory complex. We obtained small root mean square deviations of Cα carbon atoms (residues 2-83) between the GFRP structures of the stimulatory and inhibitory complexes, 0.64 Å for the pentamers and 0.42 Å for the monomers (Fig. 3, A and B). However, a local structural change was found in loop β3-β4 (residues 38-44) that interacts with GTPCHI residues located close to the biopterin-binding site (Fig. 1A). The aforementioned structural changes at the interface were correlated with an observed rotational movement of GFRP against GTPCHI. By fitting GFRP pentamers in the inhibitory and stimulatory complexes, we found that GTPCHI rotates approximately -4.0° around the 5-fold axis of the torus structure (Fig. 3D). Moreover, each GTPCHI monomer rotates by 3.3° around the second axis, nearly perpendicular to the 5-fold axis.Fig. 3Structural changes induced by BH2 binding.

In particular, large structural changes were localized at the loop regions between secondary structure elements and involved contacts with neighboring subunits and the active site. The most prominent structural changes in GTPCHI were found in three loop regions represented by loop αd-β1 (residues 106-121), loop β2-αe, (153-161), and loop αg-β4 (204-213). All these regions participate in forming the active site. The most significant structural changes were found in loop αd-β1, which exhibited positional shifts greater than 5 Å. These changes are directly linked to the structural changes in the biopterin-binding site. In the inhibitory complex, Asp-118 from subunit B shifted position and orientation to interact with both Arg-226 from subunit A and the bound BH2 molecule (Fig. 4A). This shift seems to trigger large conformational changes in residues 110-115 of the loop region containing Phe-113 and Glu-115 (Fig. 4B). We then superimposed the GTP molecule found in the crystal structure of E. coli GTPCHI and GTP (18Nar H. Huber R. Auerbach G. Fischer M. Hösl C. Ritz H. Bracher A. Meining W. Eberhardt S. Bacher A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12120-12125Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) with our GTPCHI·GFRP complexes. It was found that the side chains of Phe-113 and Glu-115 in the stimulatory complex were projected toward the active site to cover the guanine ring of the GTP bound at the active site (Fig. 4, B (red) and D (right)). In the inhibitory complex, however, Phe-113 and Glu-115 were flipped away from the active site (Fig. 4B, green), resulting in an open state of the active site (Fig. 4D, left). This peptide conformation was stabilized by the intrachain salt bridge between Asp-114 and His-117. The open state of the active site could be one of the reasons why GTPCHI activity is inhibited in the inhibitory complex, because it is likely that the guanine base of the GTP substrate could not be positioned in the correct orientation in the active site. In the stimulatory complex, Glu-115 is hydrogen-bonded to Arg-176 from subunit A (Fig. 4B), and the phenol ring of Phe-113 is stacked on the imidazole ring of His-134 from subunit A, which may contribute to stabilizing the conformation of the active histidine residue (Fig. 4C). These interactions are lost in the inhibitory complex.Fig. 4BH2-induced structural changes in the active site.

https://openalex.org/W2068596181,"The luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor involved in the synthesis and release of pituitary gonadotropins and in the proliferation and apoptosis of pituitary cells. Insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) is a tyrosine kinase receptor that has a mitogenic effect on pituitary cells. In this study, we used the αT3 gonadotrope cell line as a model to characterize the IGF-1R signaling pathways and to investigate whether this receptor interacts with the LHRH cascade. We found that IGF-1 activated the IGF-1R, insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Akt in a time-dependent manner in αT3 cells. The MAPK (ERK1/2, p38, and JNK) pathways were only weakly activated by IGF-1. In contrast, LHRH strongly stimulated the MAPK pathways but had no effect on Akt activation. Cotreatment with IGF-1 and LHRH had various effects on these signaling pathways. 1) It strongly increased IGF-1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase through activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor. 2) It had an additive effect on ERK1/2 activation without modifying the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK1/2. 3) It strongly reduced IGF-1 activation of Akt. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays and cell cycle analysis revealed that, in addition to having an additive effect on ERK1/2 activation, cotreatment with IGF-1 and LHRH also had an additive effect on cell proliferation. The LHRH-induced inhibition of Akt stimulated by IGF-1 was completely blocked by Safingol, a protein kinase C (PKC) α-specific inhibitor, and by a dominant negative form of PKCα. Finally, we showed that the inhibitory effect of LHRH on IGF-1-induced PKCα-mediated Akt activation was associated with a marked reduction in Bad phosphorylation and a substantial decrease in the ability of IGF-1 to rescue αT3 cells from apoptosis induced by serum starvation. Our results demonstrate for the first time that several interactions take place between IGF-1 and LHRH receptors in gonadotrope cells. The luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor involved in the synthesis and release of pituitary gonadotropins and in the proliferation and apoptosis of pituitary cells. Insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) is a tyrosine kinase receptor that has a mitogenic effect on pituitary cells. In this study, we used the αT3 gonadotrope cell line as a model to characterize the IGF-1R signaling pathways and to investigate whether this receptor interacts with the LHRH cascade. We found that IGF-1 activated the IGF-1R, insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Akt in a time-dependent manner in αT3 cells. The MAPK (ERK1/2, p38, and JNK) pathways were only weakly activated by IGF-1. In contrast, LHRH strongly stimulated the MAPK pathways but had no effect on Akt activation.

In the pituitary, LHRH-I (mammalian LHRH) stimulates the synthesis and the release of the gonadotropins, LH and FSH, and promotes cell proliferation and apoptosis in pituitary cells (1Lewy H. Ashkenazi I.E. Naor Z. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 203: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 2Imai A. Tamaya T. Vitam. Horm. 2000; 59: 1-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of LHRH-I are mediated by a cell surface receptor (LHRH-R) belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily (3Conn P.M. Crowley Jr., W.F. Annu. Rev.

LHRH-I binding to its cognate receptor leads to interaction of the receptor with heterotrimeric G proteins, including Gq/11. These G proteins in turn activate phospholipase C, leading to the production of diacylglycerol and the subsequent activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (5Naor Z. Harris D. Shacham S. Front.

Activation of LHRH-R also triggers calcium influx, resulting in an increase in intracellular calcium (16Conn P.M. Janovick J.A. Stanislaus D. Kuphal D. Jennes L. Vitam.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1310-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, multiple signal transduction pathways may mediate LHRH-I action in the pituitary gland.Like LHRH-I, IGF-1 is a mitogen in pituitary cells (22Childs G.V. Unabia G.

IGF-1 activates the intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) (27LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). This activation results in auto-phosphorylation of the receptor and phosphorylation of various intracellular substrates, including several insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins (IRS-1 to -4) and the Src homology collagen protein (28Dupont J. Dunn S.E. Barrett J.C. LeRoith D. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2003; 58: 325-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 is a multisite docking protein for numerous Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins, including the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the adapter protein, Grb2 (29Backer J.M.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). The binding of the IRS and Src homology collagen proteins to Grb2 and its associated guanine nucleotide exchange protein, mSos, leads to the activation of the Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway (27LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). The role of the different pathways activated by IGF-1 during proliferative and anti-apoptotic responses is cell type-specific. For example, in human intestinal smooth muscle cells (32Kuemmerle J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G411-G422Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 33Kuemmerle J.F. Bushman T.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G151-G158PubMed Google Scholar), IGF-1 induces growth by activating both the PI3K and MAPK-ERK1/2 pathways. In contrast, only the PI3K pathway is essential for IGF-1 signaling in proliferating MCF-7 cell lines (derived from human breast tumor) (34Dufourny B. Alblas J. van Teeffelen H.A. van Schaik F.M. van der Burg B. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 272: 23589-23597Google Scholar).IGF-1 and IGF-1R are both expressed in pituitary cells (35Bach M.A. Bondy C.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2588-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Like LHRH-I, IGF-1 treatment increases LH secretion by male rat pituitary cells (36Soldani R. Cagnacci A. Yen S.S.C. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 131: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Moreover, IGF-1 enhances the LH response to LHRH-I in pituitary cells from male rats (37Xia Y.X. Weiss J.M. Polack S. Diedrich K. Ortmann O. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 144: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), pigs (38Whitley N.C. Barb C.R. Utley R.V. Popwell J.M. Kraeling R.R. Rampacek G.B.

Sci. 2002; 70: 13-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). IGF-1 also regulates growth in pituitary gonadotrope cells (41Emons G. Muller V. Ortmann O. Schulz K.D. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 65: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). LHRH-I agonists inhibit cell proliferation in prostate cancer cells by interfering with some of the cellular mechanisms required for the mitogenic activity of IGF-1 (42Marelli M.M. Moretti R.M. Dondi D. Motta M. Limonta P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The degree of interaction between LHRH-I and IGF-1 signaling pathways in the pituitary gland remains unclear. In this study we have investigated these interactions by using αT3–1 gonadotrope cells derived from murine pituitary tumor cells. These cells produce the glycoprotein hormone α-subunit, the LHRH-R and SF-1. However, these cells do not produce LHβ, as they were derived from cells at an early stage of development during which LHβ was not produced. Although these cells do not express the α, LHβ, and FSHβ subunits (43Alarid E.T. Windle J.J. Whyte D.B. Mellon P.L. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 3319-3329PubMed Google Scholar, 44Windle J.J. Weiner R.I. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), they proliferate and express the LHRH receptor. Thus, αT3 cells provide a good model system for determining whether interactions exist between the LHRH-I and IGF-1 signaling pathways.In this study, we characterized interactions taking place between the IGF-1R and LHRH-R signaling pathways during cell proliferation and apoptosis in αT3 cells. We demonstrate for the first time that LHRH-I treatment enhances IGF-1-induced, MAPK-ERK1/2 and PKC signaling pathway-mediated cell proliferation, whereas it strongly diminishes the anti-apoptotic effect of IGF-1 through inhibition of PKCα-mediated Akt activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

Freshly removed anterior pituitary glands were washed twice in B1 buffer (0.25% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% deoxyribonuclease, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, 0.6 mm NaH2PO4, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4 12H2O, and 6 mm glucose) before being incubated with type I collagenase (4 mg/ml) and grade II dispase (2 mg/ml) in buffer B1 at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were centrifuged for 4 min at 200 × g and then incubated with 0.8% type V neuraminidase in B1 buffer for 10 min at 37 °C. After centrifugation (200 × g, 4 min), dispersed cells were cultured in DMEM without red phenol and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), fungizone (1.25 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (200 mm).Mouse gonadotrope αT3 cell lines and LβT2 cells were provided by Dr. P. Mellon (La Jolla, CA). MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, OVCAR, and SKOV cells were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). All cell lines were routinely cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 300 μg/ml l-glutamine.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were homogenized on ice in lysis buffer A (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with various protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and phosphatase inhibitors (100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate). Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration in the resulting supernatants was then determined using the BCA protein assay. Extracts containing 200 μg of protein were incubated with αIGF-1R, αIRS-1, or αIRS-2 (1:1000 dilution) for 16 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were precipitated by incubation with protein G-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C as described previously (45Dupont J. Karas M. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35893-35901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat milk dissolved in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 and then probed with the appropriate antibodies. After extensive washing, immune complexes were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system. The radiographs were scanned, and the optical density of each band was measured using the MacBas version 2.52 software (Fuji PhotoFilm). Western blotting was performed without immunoprecipitation using cell extracts containing 50 μg of protein.PI3K Assay—PI3K activity was determined as described previously (45Dupont J. Karas M. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35893-35901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared on ice in extraction buffer B (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 150 mm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol (v/v), 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 35 min at 40,000 × g at 4 °C. IRS-1, IRS-2, IGF-1R, or p85 were immunoprecipitated by incubating aliquots (containing 200 μg of total protein) of each of the supernatants with the appropriate antibodies (1:1000) overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected using protein G-agarose beads and washed as follows: once in PBS supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40 and 100 μm Na3VO4; twice in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm LiCl2, 100 μm Na3VO4; and finally once in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μm Na3VO4. Precipitates were then resuspended in 40 μl of a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. MnCl2 (10 μl of a 100 mm stock solution) and phosphatidylinositol (20 μg) were then added to each sample. PI3K assays were initiated by adding 10 μl of a 440 μm ATP solution containing 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were performed at room temperature and allowed to proceed for 10 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 20 μl of HCl (8N) and 160 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1). The reaction mixtures were then centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 4 min at 4 °C. The resulting organic phase was collected and subjected to silica gel TLC. TLC plates were developed by incubation in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (120:94:22.6:4) and then left to dry. Radioactivity was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Storm, Amersham Biosciences).Akt and ERK1/2 MAPK Activity Assays—Akt and ERK1/2 MAPK kinase activities were measured using the appropriate assay kits (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). αT3 cells were stimulated as described in the figure legends and lysed using cell lysis buffer. Cell lysates containing 200 μg of total protein were immunoprecipitated by incubation with immobilized Akt or phospho-ERK1/2 monoclonal antibodies, with gentle rocking for 3 h at 4 °C. After two washes with cell lysis buffer followed by two washes with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4,10 mm MgCl2), the immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 200 μm ATP and 1 μg of GSK-3 or Elk-1 fusion proteins. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 20 μl of 3× SDS loading buffer. Samples were analyzed by probing with the phospho-GSK-3α/β (Ser-21/9) or phospho-Elk-1 (Ser-383) antibodies.Cell Proliferation Assay—For growth studies, αT3 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (10,000 cells per well) in DMEM supplemented with 10% of FBS. After 1 day, cells were transferred to serum-free medium and allowed to grow for 24 h before being incubated with various stimulants (see figure legends for details). Growth was analyzed using the MTT assay as described previously (45Dupont J. Karas M. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35893-35901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Flow Cytometry and Cell Cycle Analysis—αT3 cultures, in which ∼75% of the cells were confluent, were washed and transferred to serum-free DMEM and allowed to grow for 24 h. Cells were subjected to various treatments (see figure legends for details). After treatment with IGF-1 (10 nm) and/or LHRH (10 nm) for 18 h, cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, and washed twice with PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in citrate buffer (250 mm sucrose, 40 mm trisodium citrate (pH 7.6), 5% Me2SO) and stored at -70 °C. Nuclei were obtained by incubating the cells first in 300 μl of solution A (3.4 mm trisodium citrate (pH 7.6), 1 mm Tris, 3 mm spermine tetrahydrochloride, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml trypsin) for 5 min at room temperature and then in 300 μl of solution B (3.4 mm trisodium citrate (pH 7.6), 1 mm Tris, 3 mm spermine tetrahydrochloride, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml ribonuclease A, and 500 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor) for 5 min at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with 30 μl of propidium iodide solution (1 mg/ml), and DNA staining was analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur system with the CellQuest software. Cell cycle analysis was performed using the ModfitLT™ software (version 2).Cell Death Assays—Apoptotic cells were detected by using terminal dUTP nick-end labeling assay with ApopTag Plus Peroxidase, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Intergen Co., Purchase, NY). One thousand cells were counted, and the values obtained were used to calculate the percentage of labeled cells.Transient Transfection of MCF-7 and αT3 Cells—MCF-7 and αT3 cells were plated out the day before transfection. Cells were transiently transfected using the LipofectAMINE transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of each DNA construct (mouse LHRH-R construct for MCF-7 cells and PKCα DN or focal adhesion kinase dominant negative for αT3 cells) or 1 μg of empty pcDNA3.1 vector (negative control). Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were transferred to serum-free DMEM and allowed to grow for 16 h before being stimulated with various ligands, see figure legends for details. Cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS, and total protein was extracted.Statistics—Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance using the Statview 5.0 software. Values are expressed as means ± S.E. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTSIGF-1R Signaling Pathways in αT3 Gonadotrope Cells—We first determined whether αT3 cells expressed the IGF-1 receptor (Fig. 1). Immunoblot analysis using an antibody recognizing the β-subunit of the IGF-1R revealed that αT3 cells did express the IGF-1R. NWTb3 (NIH-3T3 overexpressing the human IGF-1R) (46Blakesley V. Kato H. Roberts C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2764-2769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and the human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, were used as positive controls (Fig. 1). We then investigated the functionality of the IGF-1 receptor in αT3 cells. Serum-starved cells were exposed to 10 nm IGF-1 for different times (Fig. 2). We found that IGF-1 induced a rapid and substantial increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-1R β-subunit (15-fold increase after 1 min of treatment) and of IRS-1 (5-fold increase after 1 min of treatment). Tyrosine phosphorylation levels then declined over the next 30 min. IGF-1R is involved in two main signaling pathways: the PI3K/Akt pathway and the MAPK (ERK1/2, p38, and JNK1/2) pathway (28Dupont J. Dunn S.E. Barrett J.C. LeRoith D. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2003; 58: 325-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether these kinases were activated in response to treatment of αT3 cells with IGF-1. IGF-1 stimulated PI3K activity (data not shown) and resulted in a 5-fold increase in the levels of phosphorylated Ser-473 and Thr-308 Akt after 1 min of treatment. The level of phosphorylated Akt increased with the length of the treatment, reaching a maximum of 20-fold after 10 min (Fig. 2C). IGF-1 also stimulated phosphorylation of two downstream targets of Akt: the transcription factor FKHR and the kinase GSK3 α/β (Fig. 2D). Although the MAPKs, ERK1/2, p38, and JNK1/2, were present in the αT3 extracts, we detected only a small increase in the level of phosphorylation of these kinases in response to IGF-1 (Fig. 2E). Thus, our results indicate that αT3 cells are equipped with a functional IGF-1 receptor.Fig. 2IGF-1 signaling pathways in αT3 cells. Time course of IGF-1-stimulated IGF-1R (A), IRS-1 (B), Akt (C), GSK3α/β and FKHR (D), and MAPKs (ERK1/2, p38, and JNK1/2) (E) activation in αT3 cells. αT3 cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM overnight before treatment with 10 nm IGF-1 for 0, 0.5, 1, 10, 30, or 60 min. Whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with different antibodies (phosphotyrosine, phospho-MAPK (ERK1/2, p38, and JNK1/2), phospho-Akt Ser and Thr, phospho-GSK3α/β, and phospho-FKHR). The blots were then stripped and reblotted with appropriate antibodies to determine total proteins loading. The blots are typical examples of an experiment that was replicated three to four times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)LHRH-I Signaling Pathways in αT3 Gonadotrope Cells— Previous studies (48Perrin M.H.

https://openalex.org/W2060082730,"The basal transcription factor TFIID is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and 14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Although TBP alone binds to the TATA box of DNA and supports basal transcription, the TAFs have essential functions that remain poorly defined. In order to study its properties, TFIID was purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a newly developed affinity tag. Analysis of the final elution by mass spectrometry confirms the presence of all the known TAFs and TBP, as well as Rsp5, Bul1, Ubp3, Bre5, Cka1, and Cka2. Both Taf1 and Taf5 are ubiquitinated, and the ubiquitination pattern of TFIID changes when BUL1 or BRE5 is deleted. Purified TFIID binds specifically to promoter DNA in a manner stabilized by TFIIA, and these complexes can be analyzed by native gel electrophoresis. Phenanthroline-copper footprinting and photoaffinity cross-linking indicate that TFIID makes extensive contacts upstream and downstream of the TATA box.

TFIID supports basal transcription and activated transcription, both of which are enhanced by TFIIA. TFIID is a large, multisubunit complex that is essential for transcription by RNA polymerase II. It consists of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) 1The abbreviations used are: TBP, TATA-binding protein; CBP, calmodulin-binding peptide; TEV, tobacco etch virus; TAFs, TBP-associated factors; HA, hemagglutinin; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; CK2, casein kinase II; OP-Cu, copper-phenanthroline; AdMLP, Adenovirus major late promoter.1The abbreviations used are: TBP, TATA-binding protein; CBP, calmodulin-binding peptide; TEV, tobacco etch virus; TAFs, TBP-associated factors; HA, hemagglutinin; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; CK2, casein kinase II; OP-Cu, copper-phenanthroline; AdMLP, Adenovirus major late promoter. and at least 14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs) (1Sanders S.L. Jennings J. Canutescu A. Link A.J. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4723-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Although the sizes of these TAFs differ by organism, conserved domains reflect that these proteins have been conserved over the eukaryotic evolution (2Tora L. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). TBP is necessary and sufficient for binding to the TATA box sequence, although this binding is stabilized by the addition of TFIIA and TFIIB (3Buratowski S. Hahn S. Guarente L. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1989; 56: 549-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Yeast TFIIA is a complex of two proteins that binds TBP and makes contacts with the DNA immediately upstream of the TATA box (4Bleichenbacher M. Tan S. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 5Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Lee S. Sigler P.B. Science. 1996; 272: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 6Tan S. Hunziker Y. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Human TFIID also binds DNA in a TATA-specific fashion but makes additional downstream contacts that may allow binding to promoters lacking a TATA element (7Oelgeschlager T. Chiang C.M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In human and Drosophila melanogaster promoters, a significant element is the initiator region about 25 bp downstream of the TATA box. The two largest TAFs, hTaf1 and hTaf2, may contact the initiator region directly (8Chalkley G.E. Verrijzer C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4835-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Within Drosophila TFIID, it has been proposed that some of the histone-like TAFs interact with a downstream promoter element situated at approximately +30 relative to the transcription start site (9Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In yeast, the TATA box is usually situated 50–90 bp upstream of the transcription start sites, but no clear consensus sequences have emerged for a downstream promoter element or initiator region. Although the yeast system has been extremely useful for studying the genetics of TAFs, there have been comparatively few biochemical studies of yeast TFIID. Immunoaffinity purification of the complex has been successful, but yields are relatively low, and the procedure requires large amounts of antibodies. Nonetheless, analysis of immunopurified yeast TFIID by mass spectrometry led to the confirmation of TFIID composition and estimates of subunit stoichiometry (1Sanders S.L. Jennings J. Canutescu A. Link A.J. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4723-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Another study using DNase I protection found that yTFIID binding was centered on the TATA box but made additional contacts up to 45 bp downstream and 25 bp upstream (10Sanders S.L. Garbett K.A. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6000-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These additional contacts were not seen with TBP alone and were dependent upon the presence of TFIIA. Two other studies have used antibodies to map subunits within the TFIID complex (11Leurent C. Sanders S. Ruhlmann C. Mallouh V. Weil P.A. Kirschner D.B. Tora L. Schultz P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3424-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 12Leurent C. Sanders S.L. Demeny M.A. Garbett K.A. Ruhlmann C. Weil P.A. Tora L. Schultz P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the production of larger amounts of active TFIID would greatly facilitate studies of interactions with DNA and its role in the control of transcription. This paper describes the development of a multipart affinity tag that can be used to purify protein complexes. This tag was used to purify significant amounts of native yeast TFIID. The purified TFIID binds to DNA in a TATA-specific fashion. In combination with TFIIA, TFIID makes extended contacts with the DNA upstream and downstream of the TATA box. Dissection of these contacts indicates the orientation and provides additional structural information about TFIID. The purified TFIID supports basal transcription in vitro and can also mediate activated transcription in the absence of Mediator. In addition to the expected TAFs and TBP, mass spectrometry of the TFIID fraction identified several possible TFIID-associated proteins, including proteins that may be important for the regulation of transcription by ubiquitination. Construction of the HCHH-Taf13 Expression Construct—pRS315-HCHH was constructed in several steps. PCR was used to amplify the calmodulin binding domain and tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease site from pBS1479 (13Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar). The upstream primer was designed to add six additional histidine residues. This cassette was then ligated between a 458-bp fragment of the TFA1 promoter and a triple HA epitope tag. This combined module was subcloned from pUC19 into pRS315. The TAF13 coding region was inserted in-frame into a BglII site just downstream of the HA tags. Finally, an additional fragment encoding eight histidine residues was ligated into an NheI site to generate pRS315-HCHH-TAF13. The sequence of this plasmid is available upon request. YSB721 has a genotype of MATa ura3-52 leu2::PET56 trp1 his3Δ200 ade2-1 taf13Δ::HIS3 (pRS316-TAF13). YSB867 was constructed by plasmid shuffling to replace pRS316-TAF13 with pRS315-HCHH-TAF13. TFIID Purification—Twelve liters of 1.5× YPD supplemented with adenine and tryptophan were inoculated with 20 ml of a saturated culture of YSB867. Cells were grown in a fermentor for 40 h to an optical density at 590 nm, yielding 240 g of cells. 120 grams of frozen cells were ground with a pestle and mortar in the presence of liquid nitrogen. Cells were then thawed and resuspended in 90 ml of KBF1 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 150 mm potassium acetate (KOAc), 2.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). An equal volume of 425–600-μm glass beads was added, and cells were further lysed in a Bead-Beater (Bio-spec products) using 15 cycles of 20 s on, 100 s off. The supernatant was decanted, and any remaining beads and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 6 min in an SS-34 rotor. The KOAc concentration of the supernatant was adjusted to 650 mm. The sample was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min to allow extraction of nuclei, and the lysate was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g in a Beckman 45Ti rotor for 60 min. The clarified supernatant was diluted by a factor of 2 with KBF2 buffer (KBF1 lacking KOAc) and rotated overnight with 2.4 ml of Calmodulin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The slurry was poured into four short columns, washed with 5 column volumes of KBF1, and eluted in 7.2 ml of KBF3 elution buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm MgSO4, 5 mm EGTA, 350 mm KOAc, 2.5 mm mercaptoethanol). The elution fraction was diluted by a factor of 5 with KBF2 and loaded onto a Hi-S cation exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was developed by gradient elution in 6.5 ml from 75 to 675 mm KOAc. Fractions that contained TFIID were identified by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for TBP and multiple TAFs. 1.5 ml of the fractions eluting from 400 to 550 mm KOAc were pooled and incubated with 60 μl of TALON resin (Clontech) for 3 h and washed three times with 1 ml of KBF7-15 (15 mm imidazole, 25 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm MgSO4). The slurry was poured into a column and eluted with 4 elutions of 60 μl of KBF7-400 (the same buffer with 400 mm imidazole). The final eluate was dialyzed against KBF8 (25 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 150 mm KOAc, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm MgOAc) using dialysis membrane with a nominal molecular weight cut-off of 6–8000 (Spectrapor). The sample was concentrated by further dialysis against KBF8 containing 30% PEG-8000 until the volume was ∼120 μl. The dialysis steps were required to remove imidazole, leading to improved long term storage and reduced background in DNA binding experiments. Final protein concentration was determined by using a Bradford-style dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad). TFIID fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue (Sigma B2025) and by immunoblotting for TFIID components and ubiquitin (Affiniti UG9510). Mass Spectrometry—Approximately 15 μg of TFIID were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a MOPS-NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gradient gel. After staining with colloidal Coomassie Blue, 30 gel slices containing visible bands were excised, reduced, alkylated, and digested overnight with trypsin prior to analysis by mass spectrometry. Peptide digests were analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The liquid chromatography system consisted of an in-house prepared microscale capillary reversed phase column (outer diameter 360 μm, inner diameter 100 μm) packed with 5 μm/200 Å Magic C18 beads (Michrom BioResources) and an Agilent 1100 high pressure liquid chromatography pump. The mass spectrometer was a QSTAR Pulsar I (Applied Biosystems/MDS-Sciex). The protein digest was loaded onto the column using either a pressure cell or a Famos autosampler (LC Packings). The data were searched against the yeast protein data base (NCBI) using the ProID software package (Applied Biosystems). In addition, several unseparated protein complex samples were digested in solution with trypsin and then analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry as above. Although polyethylene glycol from these samples complicated analysis, peptides identified matched those proteins identified by gel electrophoresis. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—DNA probes were excised from plasmids with restriction enzymes and labeled on one strand by filling in with Klenow fragment and the appropriate combination of radioactive and unlabeled dNTPs. Adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP) sequences were from pUC-MLTATAwt and pUC-MLTATAmut2 (14Buratowski S. Hahn S. Sharp P.A. Guarente L. Nature. 1988; 334: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Probes containing about 115 bp of ADH1 or ADH2 promoter sequences were generated by annealing long oligonucleotides, extending with a single round of PCR, and cloning these fragments into pUC19ΔH3. Four point mutations were introduced to disrupt cryptic TATA boxes in each promoter (pUC-Adh1Pro and pUC-Adh2Pro). ADH1 and ADH2 promoters with mutated TATA boxes were generated using identical oligonucleotides except for the TATAA sequence that was changed to GCGTC (pUC-Adh1MutPro) and GGGCG (pUC-Adh2MutPro), respectively. All sequences are available upon request. Binding reactions were 10 μl and contained ∼2 μg of TFIID, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgOAc, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol, 0.3 μgof dGdC, and 10,000 cpm end-labeled probe. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, reactions were resolved on 1.6% agarose gels in 1× TGE (25 mm Tris base, 190 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA) with 2 mm MgOAc and/or 1% glycerol. The 4-mm thick gels were run at 7.5 V/cm for 50 min at room temperature. Gels were dried and exposed to film or a PhosphorImager plate for 40 min to overnight. Some reactions also included 0.5 μl of 2 μm recombinant TFIIA (a gift from Song Tan, Pennsylvania State University), 0.5 μlof2 μm recombinant TBP, and/or 0.5 μlof2 μm recombinant TFIIB. Phenanthroline-Copper Footprinting—EMSA was performed as above with some minor changes. To scale up the reaction, ∼4 μg of TFIID or 50 ng of TBP were used in combination with 100 ng of TFIIA and 25,000 cpm of probe. Low melting point agarose was used. Instead of drying the gel, copper-phenanthroline chemical footprinting was performed in gel (15Kuwabara M.D. Sigman D.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7234-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) for 10 min prior to quenching and overnight exposure of the wet gel to film. Gel slices containing TBP or TFIID-bound DNA complex and unbound DNA were excised and melted, phenol-extracted twice, chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and then counted using a scintillation counter. The samples were normalized to equalize radioactive counts, denatured, and resolved on an 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel (1× TBE, 8 m urea). These gels were fixed by soaking in 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager plate overnight. Results were analyzed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). DNA Photoaffinity Labeling—Nine different probes were constructed, each containing an 5-[N-(4-azidobenzoyl)-3-aminoallyl]-dUTP residue followed by a 32P-radiolabeled nucleotide (16Sengupta S.M. Persinger J. Bartholomew B. Peterson C.L. Methods. 1999; 19: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 17Bartholomew B. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5181-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Cross-linker and label were incorporated at a specific sites on the sense strand of 100 bp of ADH1 promoter sequence. Two point mutations were introduced in ADH1 to increase the number of sites for cross-linking. Following synthesis, probes were normalized for total counts. Binding reactions were prepared as above for EMSA. After incubation in the dark, cross-linking was activated by illumination with a long wavelength UV light for 4 min. DNA was nicked with DNase I (Ambion) and digested with S1 nuclease (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) prior to analyzing cross-linked proteins on a 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel for SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager plate overnight. The PhosphorImager was quantified, with background correction for each lane and normalization of each TAF relative to an unchanging band. In Vitro Transcription Reactions—Yeast TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIH, Mediator, and RNA polymerase II were purified as described (18Myers L.C. Leuther K. Bushnell D.A. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Methods. 1997; 12: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Yeast TBP (14Buratowski S. Hahn S. Sharp P.A. Guarente L. Nature. 1988; 334: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), full-length TFIIA (6Tan S. Hunziker Y. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and TFIIF (19Henry N.L. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23388-23392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were also purified for use in a specific transcription assay (20Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Briefly, transcription reactions with purified factors were incubated at 23 °C for 60 min with 100 ng of template plasmids pS(GCN4)2CG– and pJJ470 before being stopped by 6-fold dilution with stop solution (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.3 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml glycogen, and 12.5 units/ml ribonuclease T1). 10% SDS and proteinase K were added to remove protein prior to ethanol precipitation, denaturation, and analysis on a 7% acrylamide, 7 m urea TBE gel. Purification of TFIID—To facilitate purification of native TFIID, we designed a new affinity tag (Fig. 1A), which we designated HCHH. Although it shares some features with the TAP tag (13Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar), it is smaller (at 118 residues) and does not absolutely require protease cleavage for elution. The HCHH tag consists of an N-terminal 6-histidine tag followed by the calmodulin-binding peptide (CBP). This is followed by another stretch of 8 histidine residues with 10 residue linkers on either side. These elements are separated from a triple-HA epitope tag by a cleavage site for the TEV protease. The cleavage site may be used to separate the protein from the final affinity column or simply to remove the tag after it is no longer necessary. The HCHH tag was cloned into a low copy yeast shuttle vector downstream of the constitutive TFA1 promoter. For purification of TFIID, the open reading frame of the TFIID-specific TAF13 was cloned in-frame C-terminal to the HCHH tag. The expression plasmid was shuffled into a taf13Δ strain to create YSB867. No obvious growth differences were observed between the tagged strain and its parent, suggesting that the HCHH tag does not interfere with Taf13 function. Conditions for lysis of yeast cells and protein extraction were optimized for maximum levels of TFIID in the soluble fraction. The first purification step was chromatography on Calmodulin-Sepharose, from which proteins were eluted with a combination of EGTA and moderate salt. Because the EGTA was not compatible with immobilized metal affinity chromatography, the calmodulin eluate was run over a strong cation exchange column (Hi-S). Fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting, and those containing the HA epitope were pooled and bound to cobalt-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. From 120 g of yeast, ∼100 μg of the TFIID fraction were obtained. Assuming 5000 molecules of TFIID per cell (21Lee T.I. Young R.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1398-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and 2.5 × 1011 cells per purification, 100 μg of total protein means the procedure approaches a recovery of 4%. Quantitative immunoblotting yields an estimate of purity of about 30–50% so the final recovery is probably closer to 1–2%. Gel filtration chromatography and glycerol gradient analyses (not shown) confirmed that the purification yields a single complex with an apparent molecular mass of 700 kDa. Further purification by anion exchange chromatography also produced a single elution peak (data not shown). Quantitative immunoblotting of a typical purification gave a final concentration of ∼200 nm for TBP and ∼400 nm for Taf13, the tagged “entry point” for the purification (data not shown). Therefore, at least 50% of the recovered TAF complexes contain TBP. Identification of TFIID-associated Proteins—Proteins within the purified TFIID fractions were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The samples were analyzed both as whole complex digested in solution and as single bands after separation by SDS-PAGE and in gel digestion. Thirty individual band slices were excised from a gel similar to the one shown in the 1st lane of Fig. 1B for analysis. A parallel purification from an untagged strain was carried out to identify nonspecifically associated proteins (Fig. 1B, 2nd lane). All 14 TAFs and TBP were identified in the TFIID preparation, both in whole sample and individual band analyses. Multiple peptides for each TAF were observed, with sequence coverage ranging from 35 to 65%. Peptides from eight of the TAFs appeared in more than one gel band. In most cases this was because of cross-contamination of the excised gel slices and/or partial proteolysis. One prominent example of the latter was the identification of 37 peptides within one band of about 120 kDa, corresponding to a fragment of Taf1 that may be missing up to 198 residues from the N terminus. Another likely possibility is that some TAFs undergo post-translational modification. No phosphorylated peptides were identified by mass spectrometry. However, methylation on Taf5 was observed. 2R. Auty and S. Buratowski, manuscript in preparation. In cases where a TAF appeared in multiple bands, the band that clearly produced more peptides and sequence coverage than the others was the one annotated in Fig. 1B. In addition to the previously known TFIID subunits, several other proteins were identified in the purified fraction. Most of these correspond to bands in the mock-purified lane of Fig. 1B. For example, bands identified as Mes1, YGL245w, and Arc1 were seen in both lanes. These proteins are known to form a complex that binds tRNA (22Simos G. Segref A. Fasiolo F. Hellmuth K. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5437-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In addition, several abundant proteins that are often found as contaminants were identified. These include heat shock proteins, the translation elongation factor Tef1, and the Kem1 protein (23Gavin A.C. Bosche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A. Schultz J. Rick J.M. Michon A.M. Cruciat C.M. Remor M. Hofert C. Schelder M. Brajenovic M. Ruffner H. Merino A. Klein K. Hudak M. Dickson D. Rudi T. Gnau V. Bauch A. Bastuck S. Huhse B. Leutwein C. Heurtier M.A. Copley R.R.

There are some other proteins in the TAF13-HCHH purified lane that do not appear to be in the mock-purified lane (Fig. 1B). These included Cka1 and Cka2, components of the kinase CK2. Several of the other candidate TFIID-interacting proteins have roles in ubiquitination. The ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 and its heterodimer partner Bul1 were both identified with about 9% sequence coverage. Also, the ubiquitin protease Ubp3 and its targeting subunit Bre5 were also identified, with 15 and 48% sequence coverage, respectively. Although RSP5 is required for viability, the genes encoding Ubp3 and the adaptor proteins Bre5 and Bul1 can be deleted with no ill effects. The HCHH-tagged Taf13 was expressed in yeast strains deleted for either BRE5 or BUL1. Purified TFIID complexes from these strains and a wild-type strain were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin antibody (Fig. 2A). Multiple ubiquitinated proteins are observed in wild-type extracts (Fig. 2A, lane 1), although some groups of bands may represent multiple ubiquitinations of the same protein. Deletion of the deconjugase adaptor Bre5 results in enrichment of higher molecular weight species (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Conversely, deletion of the ligase adaptor Bul1 strongly reduces levels of several ubiquitinated species that co-purify with HCHH-TAF13. To test whether any of these ubiquitinated proteins are TAFs, TFIID was immunoprecipitated from FLAG-tagged Taf1, Taf2, and Taf5 strains. The precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody to confirm that equal amounts of TFIID were immunoprecipitated (data not shown) and with anti-ubiquitin antibody (Fig. 2B). The mobility shifts provided by the FLAG tag indicates clearly that Taf1 (Fig. 2B, lane 1) and Taf5 (Fig. 2B, lane 3) are ubiquitinated proteins. Furthermore, these proteins migrate similarly to the ubiquitinated proteins in the HCHH-Taf13 purification that are affected by deletions in Bre5 and Bul1. Although tagged Taf2 is present in Fig. 2B, lane 2, it is apparently not ubiquitinated and thus serves as a negative control. Although we and others have found bromodomain factor 1 (Bdf1) associated with TFIID in direct binding experiments (1Sanders S.L. Jennings J. Canutescu A. Link A.J. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4723-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 24Matangkasombut O. Buratowski R.M. Swilling N.W. Buratowski S.

Genet. 2003; 33: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), we did not detect Bdf1 in our TFIID preparation by mass spectrometry. This was not too surprising because we have found that Bdf1 association with TFIID is very sensitive to moderate salt levels. 3C. Sawa and S. Buratowski, unpublished data. We have also recently found that Bdf1 binds to and is phosphorylated by CK2 (26Sawa C. Nedea E. Krogan N. Wada T. Handa H. Greenblatt J. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4734-4742Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which is present in our TFIID preparation. When we used a more sensitive phosphorylation assay, a small amount of Bdf1 was observed (data not shown). This is in agreement with Sanders et al. (1Sanders S.L. Jennings J. Canutescu A. Link A.J. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4723-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), who also detected substoichiometric amounts of Bdf1 in their TFIID preparation by mass spectrometry. TFIID Binding to DNA Promoter Sequences—To test the ability of our purified TFIID to bind to typical yeast and adenoviral promoters, EMSAs were performed. Experiments using native acrylamide gels were unsuccessful, but agarose gels allowed detection of the large TFIID-DNA complex (Fig. 3). TFIID alone can retard a DNA fragment containing the AdMLP. The TFIID-DNA complex migrated much more slowly than the TBP-DNA complex. However, TFIID complexes were smeared in the gel, presumably due to dissociation during electrophoresis (Fig. 3, lane 2). Fig. 3, lane 3, shows that equimolar amounts of TFIIA strongly stabilized TFIID binding in this assay. TBP binding was also stabilized by TFIIA (Fig. 3, compare lanes 6 and 7). TFIIA by itself showed no binding to the probe (data not shown). The addition of extra TBP did not significantly increase the amount of TFIID binding (Fig. 3, compare lanes 2 and 4), suggesting that most of the purified TAF complexes contain TBP. Similar results were obtained when yeast ADH1 or ADH2 promoters were used (data not shown and see below). To test whether TFIID binding was dependent upon a functional TATA element, EMSA competition experiments were performed by adding increasing amounts of unlabeled AdMLP DNA fragments. Although a fragment containing a wild-type TATAA box was able to compete for TFIID, a similar fragment in which the TATAA sequence was mutated to GCGTC competed less efficiently (data not shown). Although competition by the mutant was much reduced, it was not completely eliminated. This suggests that additional contacts may be made on DNA apart from the TATA box. When the mutant AdMLP fragment was labeled, low levels of TFIID binding were still observed that were not seen with TBP alone (data not shown). Extensive Contacts between TFIID and Promoter Sequences—If TFIID makes additional contacts with promoter sequences outside of the TATA box, these should be observable using DNA footprinting techniques. Indeed, DNase I protection experiments suggest that mammalian TFIID makes extensive contacts with DNA downstream of the TATA element to at least 35 bp downstream of the initiation site (27Sawadogo M.

Here we report another long-necked fossil, Dinocephalosaurus, from southwestern China, recently collected in Middle Triassic marine deposits approximately 230 million years old.

The anticancer agent camptothecin specifically targets topo I. The mechanisms responsible for the regulation of topo I in cells, however, are not known. This study demonstrates that c-Abl-dependent phosphorylation up-regulates topo I activity. The c-Abl SH3 domain bound directly to the N-terminal region of topo I. The results demonstrate that c-Abl phosphorylated topo I at Tyr268 in core subdomain II. c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of topo I Tyr268in vitro and in cells conferred activation of the topo I isomerase function. Moreover, activation of c-Abl by treatment of cells with ionizing radiation was associated with c-Abl-dependent phosphorylation of topo I and induction of topo I activity. The functional significance of the c-Abl/topo I interaction is supported by the findings that (i) mutant topo I(Y268F) exhibited loss of c-Abl-induced topo I activity, and (ii) c-Abl–/– cells were deficient in the accumulation of protein-linked DNA breaks. In addition, loss of topo I phosphorylation in c-Abl-deficient cells conferred resistance to camptothecin-induced apoptosis. These findings collectively support a model in which c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of topo I is functionally important to topo I activity and sensitivity to topo I poisons.

Catalysis of the single-stranded nick involves the formation of a covalent bond between the 3′-end of the DNA strand break and the active-site tyrosine in the C-terminal region of topo I (5Lynn R.

Chem. 1989; 264: 13373-13376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following relaxation, reversal of the trans-esterification reaction results in religation of the phosphodiester bond and release of topo I. The reduction of torsional stress is essential to DNA replication (1Wang J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 54: 665-697Crossref Scopus (1644) Google Scholar, 4Champoux J.J. Methods Mol.

Despite the importance of topo I to cellular functions, little is known about the mechanisms responsible for the regulation of this enzyme. Human topo I is a nuclear protein with 765 residues, a predicted molecular mass of 91 kDa, and four domains. The N-terminal non-conserved domain from Met1 to Lys197 contains four putative nuclear localization signals, is sensitive to proteolysis, and can be deleted without effect on topo I activity (15Alsner J. Svejstrup J. Kjeldsen E. Sorensen B. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12408-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Liu L.F. Miller K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1988; 85: 2543-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The conserved core domain extends from Glu198 to Ile651 and is followed by a short linker domain from Asp652 to Glu696. The highly conserved C-terminal domain extends from Gln697 to Phe765, contains the active-site tyrosine at position 723, and is required for topo I activity (6Eng W.-K. Pandit S. Sternglanz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13373-13376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the core and C-terminal domains in covalent and noncovalent complexes with duplex DNA have shown that the enzyme clamps around B-form DNA (18Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Moreover, the linker region assumes a coiled-coil configuration and protrudes away from the rest of the protein (19Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). topo I is a cellular target for the plant alkaloid camptothecin (CPT) (3Liu L.F. Annu. Rev.

Updat. 1999; 2: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The available evidence supports a model in which CPT binds to the topo I/DNA complex subsequent to DNA cleavage and covalent attachment of topo I to DNA (23Hertzberg R.P. Caranfa M.J. Hecht S.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 24Svejstrup J. Christiansen K. Gromova I. Andersen A. Westergaard O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). CPT then stabilizes the cleavage complexes by inhibiting topo I-mediated DNA religation (25Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 191-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 26Pommier Y. Pourquier P. Fan Y. Strumberg D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 83-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). A CPT binding mode has been proposed in which CPT interacts with both DNA strands and topo I residues Arg364, Asp533, and Asn722 (18Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Stabilization of the cleavage complexes by CPT is believed to induce lethality as a result of collisions with proteins involved in DNA replication and transcription (25Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 191-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 26Pommier Y. Pourquier P. Fan Y. Strumberg D. Biochim. Biophys.

In addition, CPT-induced stabilization of the topo I/DNA complex is associated with conversion of single-stranded nicks to irreversible double-strand breaks (21Covey J.M. Jaxel C. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5016-5022PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hsiang Y. Lihou M. Liu L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5077-5082PubMed Google Scholar, 30Zhang H. D'Arpa P. Liu L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 2433-2439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Post-translational modification of topo I has been shown to regulate topo I activity. Protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation up-regulates topo I activity and thereby increases CPT sensitivity (37Pommier Y. Kerrigan D. Hartman K. Glazer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9418-9422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of the ubiquitously expressed c-Abl protein-tyrosine kinase is tightly regulated in cells (38Jackson P.

These findings have supported a role for nuclear c-Abl in converting DNA damage into signals that control the genotoxic stress response. Because c-Abl is activated by DNA strand breaks (45Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W.

Human U-937 myeloid leukemia cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and l-glutamine. Cells were treated with 10 μm CPT (Sigma). Irradiation was performed at room temperature using a Gammacell-1000 (Atomic Energy of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) under aerobic conditions with a 137Cs source emitting at a fixed dose rate of 0.76 gray/min as determined by dosimetry. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Cell lysates were prepared for immunoprecipitation as described (45Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Soluble proteins were incubated with anti-c-Abl (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-topo I (Topogen, Inc.) antibody as described (45Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-c-Abl or anti-topo I antibody. Antigen/antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL detection system, Amersham Biosciences). Fusion Protein Binding Assays—Glutathione S-transferase (GST) and GST-c-Abl-SH3 were purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose beads. Cell lysates were incubated with 2 μg of immobilized GST or GST-c-Abl-SH3 for 2 h at 4 °C. GST-Grb2-SH3 fusion protein was used as an extra control. The resulting protein complex were washed with lysis buffer and analyzed by immunoblot analysis with anti-topo I antibody. In the reciprocal experiment, GST-topo I or fragments of topo I linked to GST were separately incubated with lysates, and the adsorbates were analyzed by immunoblot analysis with anti-c-Abl antibody. Direct Interaction of c-Abl with topo I—Purified GST-c-Abl bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (∼10 μg) was incubated with 5 units of thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) for 4 h at 25 °C. 5 μg of c-Abl was incubated with 4 μg of GST-topo I bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline, and the adsorbates were eluted with 500 mm NaCl. The eluate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. The protein bands were excised and processed for trypsin digestion. The resulting peptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) (Voyager DE-PRO, ABI, Framingham, MA) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). ESI-MS and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) were performed using an electrospray ion trap (LCQ-DECA, Thermo Electron). The tryptic peptides were fractionated on a capillary HPLC C18 column coupled with a mass spectrometer. Tandem mass spectra were acquired using argon as the collision gas and sufficient collision energy to obtain complete sequence information on the precursor ion. MS and MS/MS data were then analyzed using the BioWorks 3.0 software package (Thermo Electron). In other experiments, c-Abl was incubated with GST-topo I, and adsorbates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Abl antibody. In Vitro Phosphorylation Studies—Purified GST-topo I (55Bharti A.K.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1993-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) was incubated with c-Abl or c-Abl(K290R) in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm MnCl2) containing [γ-32 P]ATP or unlabeled ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Kinase-active c-Abl and kinase-inactive c-Abl(K290R) were purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells (56Mayer B.J. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell.

Analysis of the c-Abl preparations by SDS-PAGE and protein staining demonstrated >90% purity. In certain experiments, c-Abl-phosphorylated GST-topo I was incubated with purified SHPTP1 protein-tyrosine phosphatase (57Kharbanda S. Bharti A. Pei D. Wang J. Pandey P. Ren R. Weichselbaum R.

The reaction products were analyzed (i) by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, (ii) in assays of topo I activity, and (iii) by mapping the phosphorylation site. Preparation of Nuclear Lysates—Nuclear lysates were prepared as described (36Rubin E. Pantazis P. Bharti A. Toppmeyer D. Giovanella B. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2433-2439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 58Deffie A.M. Batra J.K. Goldenberg G.J. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 58-62PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. topo I Activity Assays—topo I activity was measured by DNA relaxation assays as described (36Rubin E. Pantazis P. Bharti A. Toppmeyer D. Giovanella B. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2433-2439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in reaction buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm spermidine, and 5% glycerol. The gels were imaged using an Alpha-imager-2000 (Alpha Innotech). Percent supercoiled DNA was quantitated from the digital image using the ImageQuant software package. Identification of in Vitro Tyrosine Phosphorylation Sites—Purified GST-topo I was incubated with c-Abl and [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction products were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The topo I band was identified by Coomassie Blue staining and excised from the gel. In gel digestion with trypsin was performed as described (60Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 61Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). In brief, a corresponding slice of gel was cut into small pieces and dehydrated with acetonitrile. The content were rehydrated with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate and incubated at 56 °C for 1 h. Following dehydration with acetonitrile, gel pieces were suspended in trypsin (12.5 ng/μl) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. In gel digestion was carried out at 37 °C for 10–12 h. The peptides were extracted in 50% acetonitrile and 5% formic acid. For 32P-labeled topo I, the trypsin-digested peptides were fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC. Aliquots of the fractions were assayed for 32P. Positive fractions were subjected to Edman sequencing, and part of the digest was directly analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS using the Voyager DE-PRO. Edman sequencing was performed for 14 cycles, and the eluate of every cycle was assayed for 32P. Identification of in Vivo Tyrosine Phosphorylation Sites—Nuclei isolated in nuclear buffer (20 mm KH2PO4, 5mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EGTA) were resuspended in lysis buffer. The suspension was gently rotated for 1 h at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated with pre-equilibrated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid matrix (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA). The matrix was washed with lysis buffer containing 25 mm imidazole. Proteins were eluted with lysis buffer containing 100 mm imidazole, concentrated, and separated by SDS-PAGE. The topo I band was identified by staining, excised, and subjected to in gel trypsin digestion. The masses of the trypsin-digested peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Tyr268 in topo I was mutated to phenylalanine using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Analysis of Protein-linked DNA Breaks (PLDBs) and DNA Fragmentation—topo I PLDBs were assayed as described (62Beidler D.R. Tewari M. Friesen P.D. Poirier G. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16526-16528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Quantification of DNA fragmentation by alkaline elution assays was performed as described (63Solary E. Bertrand R. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Blood. 1993; 81: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of Sub-G1 DNA Content—Cells were fixed with ethanol and stained with propidium iodide. DNA content was assessed using a FACScan (BD Biosciences). c-Abl Associates with topo I—To determine whether c-Abl forms a complex with topo I, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Abl antibody. Analysis of the immunoprecipitates with anti-topo I antibody demonstrated the coprecipitation of c-Abl and topo I (Fig. 1A). In the reciprocal experiment, immunoblot analysis of anti-topo I immunoprecipitates with anti-c-Abl antibody confirmed the association of c-Abl and topo I in cells (Fig. 1B). Based on the total amounts of topo I and c-Abl in the lysates subjected to immunoprecipitation, ∼5% of the c-Abl pool and 4% of the topo I pool contribute to the formation of the c-Abl—topo I complexes. To further assess the interaction between c-Abl and topo I, cell lysates were incubated with GST, GST-Grb2-SH3, or GST-c-Abl-SH3. Analysis of the adsorbates on the glutathione beads by immunoblotting with anti-topo I antibody demonstrated binding of topo I to GST-c-Abl-SH3, but not to GST or GST-Grb2-SH3 (Fig. 1C). In other experiments, fragments of topo I linked to GST were incubated with cell lysates. Immunoblot analysis of the adsorbates with anti-c-Abl antibody demonstrated no detectable binding to topo I with a deletion of amino acids 1–210 (Fig. 1D). Localization of the c-Abl-binding site to the N-terminal region of topo I was confirmed by the demonstration that c-Abl bound to GST-topo I(1–250) (Fig. 1D). To assess direct interaction, purified recombinant c-Abl protein was incubated with GST-topo I linked to beads. After extensive washing, the adsorbates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Abl antibody. Fig. 1E shows a direct interaction of c-Abl with topo I. These results demonstrate that c-Abl binds directly to topo I and that the c-Abl SH3 domain associates with the N-terminal region of topo I. topo I Associates Directly with c-Abl—To determine the direct interaction, purified c-Abl was incubated with GST-topo I linked to beads. After extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the adsorbates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Two topo I-interacting proteins (140 and 100 kDa) were visualized by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). Both proteins were trypsin-digested, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS and ESI-MS/MS. The MALDI-TOF-MS-generated spectrum (data not shown) was subjected to a data base search using Protein Prospector. The protein was identified as the proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1 (p150, c-Abl) (NCBI accession number 125135 and Swiss-Prot accession number P00519). A fraction of tryptic peptides was also analyzed by ESI-MS/MS. The peptides were separated in a C18 capillary column, and a total ion chromatogram was recorded (Fig. 2B, upper panel). MS and MS/MS data were generated and analyzed using the BioWorks 3.0 software package to identify the protein. Based on the peptide sequence data (MS/MS), the protein was identified as c-Abl. Four peptides with a 1.5 or higher xc value were identified as c-Abl peptide sequences. A peptide at m/z 644.17 2+ (2+ indicates a doubly charged ion) was identified as a c-Abl peptide that eluted between 55 and 56 min (represented by the shaded area in Fig. 2B, upper panel), and a representative MS scan showing c-Abl peptide (Fig. 2B, middle panel). The MS/MS data analysis of the peptide at m/z 644.17 2+ (2+ indicates a doubly charged ion) (Fig. 2B, lower panel) identified c-Abl amino acids EAINKLESNLR. The y and b ion coverage of peptide fragments provided an xc value of 2.23. The other peptide sequences representing c-Abl were LKPAPPPPACTGK (xc = 3.02), LLSSVKEISDIVRR (xc = 2.97), and IASGTITK (xc = 1.9). The four peptide sequences with high xc values (representing y and b ion series) of C-Abl peptide clearly demonstrate that full-length c-Abl (140 kDa) and a fragment of c-Abl (100 kDa) bind topo I directly. The identification of c-Abl was further supported by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis and mass fingerprinting. c-Abl Phosphorylates and Activates topo I in Vitro—To determine whether c-Abl phosphorylates topo I, purified c-Abl was incubated with GST-topo I in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. GST and the c-Abl substrate GST-Crk-(120–225) (64Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) were included in similar reactions as controls. Analysis of the reaction products by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography demonstrated that, like Crk-(120–225), topo I is subject to c-Abl phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). As shown previously (45Kharbanda"
https://openalex.org/W2036995738,"α-Bungarotoxin, the classic nicotinic antagonist, has high specificity for muscle type α1 subunits in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In this study, we show that an 11-amino-acid pharmatope sequence, containing residues important for α-bungarotoxin binding to α1, confers functional α-bungarotoxin sensitivity when strategically placed into a neuronal non-α subunit, normally insensitive to this toxin. Remarkably, the mechanism of toxin inhibition is allosteric, not competitive as with neuromuscular nicotinic receptors. Our findings argue that α-bungarotoxin binding to the pharmatope, inserted at a subunit-subunit interface diametrically distinct from the agonist binding site, interferes with subunit interface movements critical for receptor activation. Our results, taken together with the structural similarities between nicotinic and GABAA receptors, suggest that this allosteric mechanism is conserved in the Cys-loop ion channel family. Furthermore, as a general strategy, the engineering of allosteric inhibitory sites through pharmatope tagging offers a powerful new tool for the study of membrane proteins. α-Bungarotoxin, the classic nicotinic antagonist, has high specificity for muscle type α1 subunits in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) 1The abbreviations used are: ACh, acetylcholine; nAChR, nicotinic ACh receptor; AChBP, ACh-binding protein; Bgtx, α-bungarotoxin; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid.1The abbreviations used are: ACh, acetylcholine; nAChR, nicotinic ACh receptor; AChBP, ACh-binding protein; Bgtx, α-bungarotoxin; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid. are prototypical members of the superfamily of ligand-gated pentameric ion channels. They are important for peripheral and central nervous system function and have long been known to mediate synaptic transmission at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction (1Karlin A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). The biochemical and molecular characterization of muscle nAChRs, the first representatives of the superfamily to be characterized in molecular terms, has been greatly facilitated by the availability of highly specific snake venom-derived α-neurotoxins, such as α-bungarotoxin (Bgtx). These small proteins are high affinity competitive antagonists that interact with a subset of agonist binding determinants to disrupt agonist binding (2Moise L. Zeng H. Caffery P. Rogowski R.S. Hawrot E. J. Toxicol. Toxin Rev. 2002; 21: 295-320Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the commercial availability of a large number of diversely labeled conjugates of Bgtx has led to major advances in the understanding of the biogenesis and developmental regulation of muscle nAChRs (3Akaaboune M. Grady R.M. Turney S. Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Neuron. 2002; 34: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, neuronal heteromeric nAChRs are not recognized by the α-neurotoxins, and comparably effective tools for their study are lacking. Biochemical and structural studies show that the major determinants responsible for Bgtx binding to muscle nAChRs are located in Loop C of the α-subunit. The structure of the molluscan acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP), a generally accepted model for the extracellular domain of homopentameric nAChRs, indicates that Loop C residues form a hairpin turn at the end of two conserved β strand motifs (β9 and β10). These β strands lie on the outer perimeter of the α subunit surface with the hairpin region in close proximity to the surface of the adjoining subunit. In heteromeric nicotinic receptors, the adjacent subunit is always a non-α (4Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K.

Neuron. 2004; 41: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). There is considerable evidence that Bgtx binding to the Loop C region prevents the association of acetylcholine (ACh) to its binding site, also in close proximity to Loop C, and as a consequence, the conformational changes leading to channel gating are precluded (7Harel M. Kasher R. Nicolas A. Guss J.M. Balass M. Fridkin M. Smit A.B. Brejc K. Sixma T.K. Katchalski-Katzir E. Sussman J.L. Fuchs S.

Menez A. Servent D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3216-3221Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast to muscle nAChRs, vertebrate heteromeric neuronal nAChRs are insensitive to Bgtx inhibition and lack high affinity Bgtx binding sites (11McGehee D.S. Role L.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 521-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). We have shown that as few as 5 amino acids from Loop C of the muscle type α1 subunit, when substituted into the homologous region of the Bgtx-insensitive neuronal α3 subunit, are sufficient to impart functional sensitivity to Bgtx (12Levandoski M.M. Lin Y. Moise L. McLaughlin J.T. Cooper E. Hawrot E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26113-26119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These studies, together with observations that Bgtx binds with high affinity to isolated short peptide fragments derived from α1 Loop C, led us to speculate that short sequences derived from α1 Loop C might be effective in transferring Bgtx sensitivity to a more distantly related target, such as the nicotinic β4 subunit, one of the widely expressed neuronal non-α subunits. If successful, we reasoned that such a sequence, which we term a pharmatope in analogy to epitope tagging, could provide a general tool for introducing pharmacological sensitivity into membrane proteins (2Moise L. Zeng H. Caffery P. Rogowski R.S. Hawrot E. J. Toxicol. Toxin Rev. 2002; 21: 295-320Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the study reported here, we wanted to determine whether insertion of an α1-derived pharmatope sequence into the neuronal β4 subunit could produce a high affinity Bgtx binding site. We tested this in Xenopus oocytes using functional neuronal heteromeric nAChRs produced by heterologous expression of the chimeric β4 subunit along with the Bgtx-insensitive α3 subunit. Two experimental β4 constructs were prepared: one with the pharmatope inserted en bloc into the L1 loop (4Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar), near the N terminus, and the other with the pharmatope replacing endogenous residues in the homologous Loop C region of β4. We asked whether Bgtx binding to these ectopic sites, distant from the subunit interfaces responsible for ACh binding, could inhibit ACh-evoked activity. We also wanted to determine by independent means whether a reporter Bgtx conjugate could be bound to surface receptors containing either of the two pharmatope-tagged β4 constructs. The observed pharmacological sensitivity introduced through one of the two pharmatope insertions provides novel insights into the conformational changes that couple activation of neuronal nAChRs to channel opening, and we emphasize for the first time an important role for the subunit interfaces distinct from those forming the agonist binding site. Chimeric Subunit Constructs—The α3 cDNA construct used in this study was in pcDNA3.1/Zeo, whereas β2 and β4 were in the pGEMHE vector provided by Charles Luetje. After linearization by restriction enzyme digestion, DNA was purified by ethanol precipitation, and in vitro RNA transcription was performed with the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit from Invitrogen. cRNA was purified by lithium chloride precipitation and stored at -80 °C. Chimeras were generated by QuikChange PCR mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the resulting plasmids were transformed into XL-1 Blue Supercompetent cells. Sequences were determined by PCR cycle sequencing. Oocyte Preparation and Injection—Oocytes were collected from mature Xenopus laevis by survival surgery and were prepared for injection essentially as described previously (12Levandoski M.M. Lin Y. Moise L. McLaughlin J.T. Cooper E. Hawrot E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26113-26119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 46 nL of cRNA and maintained in antibiotic-supplemented buffer for 2–6 days at 15 °C before recording. Equal parts of α to β subunit cRNA (0.125 μg/μl unless otherwise noted) were diluted into OR2 buffer (115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2,10mm HEPES, 0.003 mm atropine sulfate, pH 7.4). Electrophysiological Recordings—ACh-evoked currents were measured using the two-electrode voltage clamp method with a Warner OC-725C. Electrodes of resistance 0.5–2.0 megaohms were filled with 3 m KCl, and recordings were performed in a Warner RC-3Z chamber with an OC-725 bath clamp headstage attached. The flow of various drug solutions in OR2 into the chamber was regulated by solenoid valves driven by a Warner BPS-8 controller. The flow rate of the perfusion fluid was adjusted to 5 ml/min by gravity feed. As noted by others, neuronal nAChRs can display rundown with repeated agonist application (35Groot-Kormelink P.J. Luyten W.H.M.L. Colquhoun D. Sivilotti L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15317-15320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For each subunit combination, we perform rundown control determinations by measuring currents for the same dose (∼EC50) of ACh given 6–10 times over a period similar to that used for the experimental data acquisitions. In cases in which rundown is observed, values for ACh-evoked inward currents are corrected by linear interpolation. Co-application experiments were used to measure the onset of toxin block. After collecting initial responses evoked by a control dose of ACh, oocytes were incubated in a solution containing the desired Bgtx concentration for 15 min. To measure recovery from toxin block, ACh responses were collected from each oocyte prior to and after exposing the oocyte to Bgtx. Perfusion to wash out the Bgtx was commenced, and cell responsiveness to 100 μm ACh was determined at various times. Binding Assays with Radiolabeled Bgtx—Seven to eight days after cRNA injection, 100–200 oocytes were disrupted with a Brinkmann Kinematica Polytron homogenizer in 1–2 ml of homogenization buffer (83 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.9). The solution was diluted to 10 ml before centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in ND50 (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.1) and kept frozen at -80 °C for later use. Membranes (derived from 10 oocytes, at 10–50 mg of protein/ml) were incubated with 125I-Bgtx (5 nm) for 5 h at room temperature in incubation buffer (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 units of aprotinin) at a final volume of 400 μl (4–20 mg of protein). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm Bgtx. For the determination of competition by ACh, the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor diisopropyl fluorophosphate (200 μm) together with ACh (100 μm) were added to the membranes prior to the addition of 125I-Bgtx. At the end of the incubation period, the suspension was diluted with 5 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (10 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) and filtered through a double layer of DE81 filters soaked for 4 h in 20% bovine serum albumin in ND50 buffer. Radioactivity was determined on triplicate samples using a gamma counter. Binding Assays with a Fluorescent Conjugate of Bgtx—Intact oocytes expressing chimeric nAChRs were standardly incubated overnight in ND96 buffer (12Levandoski M.M. Lin Y. Moise L. McLaughlin J.T. Cooper E. Hawrot E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26113-26119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with 100 nm Alexa Fluor 647®-Bgtx, although significant binding could be observed after 1 h of incubation. The solution containing unbound Bgtx conjugate was removed, and the oocytes were rinsed five times before being examined by confocal scanning fluorescence microscopy using a filter set optimized for fluorescence emission at 633 nm. Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of 1 μm Bgtx prior to the addition of the Bgtx conjugate. No fluorescence was observed with oocytes expressing α3 and β4 subunits or with uninjected oocytes. Two Sites in the Extracellular Domain of β4 Targeted for Pharmatope Insertion—Initially, we compared the Loop C amino acid sequence from an α-bungarotoxin-sensitive α1 subunit found in a skeletal muscle type of nAChR (i.e. from Torpedo californica electric organ) with comparable regions from the toxin-insensitive rat α3 and β4 subunits. As shown in Fig. 1a, the putative Loop C region of β4 is highly variant but anchored by flanking invariant residues. In addition, it contains 4 fewer amino acid residues than Torpedo α1 and 3 less than rat α3. Also, β4 Loop C lacks the adjacent Cys residues (Cys-192–Cys-193; Torpedo α1 numbering) characteristic of all nicotinic α subunits (1Karlin A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). We replaced 7 contiguous residues from the presumed turn 7 of Loop C in β4 (i.e. VNPQDPS) with a sequence that we expected, based on NMR studies of receptor peptide fragments, to be sufficient to generate a high affinity Bgtx binding site (8Moise L.

Our candidate pharmatope sequence (WVYYTCCPDTP) was derived from the tip of Loop C in the Torpedo α1 subunit. The chimeric β4/α1[11]Loop-C subunit (Fig. 1a) contains a net addition of 4 amino acids in the Loop C region and is identical in length to the Loop C in α1. We produced a second chimeric construct, β4/α1[11]Helix, by inserting the same sequence, WVYYTCCPDTP, into a site distant from Loop C. We chose the L1 region very near the N terminus of the extracellular domain of β4. In the structure of the AChBP, the L1 loop follows a region (residues 1–13) that is α-helical (Fig. 1b). In nAChRs, the homologous L1 loop is most likely situated near the cusp of the receptor vestibule (4Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). The structures of related ligand-gated receptor subunits, from glycine receptors and GABAC receptors, accommodate natural sequence insertions in this region (4Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). The Pharmatope Sequence Is Well Tolerated—Heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes was used to prepare functional heteromeric nAChRs containing the β4 pharmatope constructs. As observed previously, the β4 subunit alone is incapable of forming functional ACh-gated ion channels; co-expression of an α subunit such as α3 or α4 is required (11McGehee D.S. Role L.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 521-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Therefore, cRNA corresponding to each β4 chimera was injected into Xenopus oocytes along with cRNA encoding the wild-type, Bgtx-insensitive rat α3 subunit. Neuronal nAChR (α3β4)-mediated currents were measured in the oocytes using the two-electrode voltage clamp recording technique as described previously (12Levandoski M.M. Lin Y. Moise L. McLaughlin J.T. Cooper E. Hawrot E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26113-26119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The β4/α1[11]Loop-C chimera, when co-expressed with α3, generated ACh-evoked currents comparable in size to those of wild-type β4 (Table I). β4/α1[11]Loop-C alone or when co-expressed with wild-type β4 did not generate functional nAChRs in oocytes (data not shown). The insertion of α1 Loop C residues does not convert the β4 subunit into an α subunit. As with wild-type β4, the β4/α1[11]Loop-C chimera must co-assemble with an agonist binding α-type subunit to generate functional nAChRs (15Duvoisin R.M. Deneris E.S. Patrick J. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1989; 3: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the nAChRs comprised of the β4/α1[11]Loop-C chimera and α3 were activated by ACh as in wild-type channels. We obtained an apparent EC50 for ACh of 121 μm, a value comparable with the EC50 of ∼100 μm reported for wild-type α3β4 nAChRs (12Levandoski M.M. Lin Y. Moise L. McLaughlin J.T. Cooper E. Hawrot E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26113-26119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that insertion of the pharmatope sequence, WVYYTCCPDTP, within the Loop C region of β4 does not disrupt subunit synthesis or co-assembly with the α3 subunit, critical steps required for generation of functional surface receptors. Pharmatope insertion into the L1 region (β4/α1[11]Helix construct) did not affect cell surface expression of functional receptors upon co-expression with α3 but did decrease the apparent EC50 for ACh ∼4-fold (Table I). Further investigations would be required to address the mechanisms by which this alteration in the L1 loop, which is distant from the ACh binding pocket, brings about the observed change in the EC50.Table IOocyte expression of pharmatope-tagged nAChRsSubunit cRNAs injectedACh-evoked response aMean value calculated from at least six responses to application of the EC50 concentration of ACh measured in oocytes from at least two different animalsEC50 for AChIC50 for BgtxμAμmnmα3 + β41.0100 ± 10bData from Levandoski et al.

Bgtx blocked ACh-evoked responses in oocytes expressing α3 and β4/α1[11]Loop-C subunits with remarkably high affinity. The IC50 for Bgtx block was 34 nm (Table I; Fig. 2a). In addition, we calculated the apparent Hill coefficient for Bgtx block of the β4/α1[11]Loop-C chimera to be ∼0.7, consistent with occupancy of a single Bgtx binding site per functional receptor being sufficient for functional inhibition. Next, we tested the reversibility of Bgtx inhibition of β4/α1[11]Loop-C following removal of the toxin from the oocyte perfusion. Bgtx block was long-lived, with an apparent t½ for dissociation of ∼140 min (Fig. 2b). In comparison, Bgtx block of native muscle type nAChRs expressed in oocytes is essentially irreversible over the same time interval (16Rosenthal J.A. Levandoski M.M. Chang B. Potts J.F. Shi Q.L. Hawrot E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7847-7855Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Bgtx Inhibition of nAChRs Containing β4/α1[11]Loop-C Does Not Involve the ACh Binding Site—Bgtx inhibits native muscle nAChRs by competitive antagonism at the agonist binding site; numerous studies have shown that agonists such as ACh inhibit radiolabeled α-neurotoxin binding to muscle-type nAChRs competitively (17Weber M. Changeux J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1974; 10: 15-34PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of toxin block in oocytes expressing α3 and chimeric β4/α1[11]Loop-C, we performed competition binding assays on isolated oocyte membranes using 125I-Bgtx (18Czajkowski C. Kaufmann C. Karlin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6285-6289Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In control experiments, we confirmed that 100 μm ACh decreases Bgtx binding to native α1 muscle-type receptors by ∼90% (Fig. 3). ACh binding to the agonist binding site prevents association of Bgtx with binding determinants that are common to the two ligands (2Moise L. Zeng H. Caffery P. Rogowski R.S. Hawrot E. J. Toxicol. Toxin Rev. 2002; 21: 295-320Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 7Harel M. Kasher R. Nicolas A. Guss J.M. Balass M. Fridkin M. Smit A.B. Brejc K. Sixma T.K. Katchalski-Katzir E. Sussman J.L. Fuchs S.

In contrast, 100 μm ACh has no significant effect on 125I-Bgtx binding to oocyte membranes containing nAChRs composed of α3 and β4/α1[11]Loop-C subunits. These results show that the functional Bgtx binding site in β4/α1[11]Loop-C-bearing receptors is structurally separate from the agonist binding site. Bgtx must therefore inhibit ACh-evoked responses in β4/α1[11]Loop-C-bearing receptors by an allosteric mechanism, not by steric occlusion of the agonist binding site. Bgtx Binds to Intact Oocytes Expressing nAChRs Containing the β4/α1[11] Helix Subunit—In contrast to β4/α1[11]Loop-C, which renders nAChRs sensitive to Bgtx inhibition, the chimeric β4/α1[11]Helix subunit does not (Table I). We next determined whether Bgtx binds to β4/α1[11]Helix-bearing nAChRs but without inhibiting the channel function. We incubated intact oocytes with a fluorescent derivative of Bgtx, Alexa Fluor 647®-Bgtx. Specific binding of the fluorescent Bgtx was evident in oocytes expressing either the β4/α1[11]Helix subunit or the β4/α1[11]Loop-C subunit along with wild-type α3 (Fig. 4). In both cases, fluorescent Bgtx binding could be blocked by an excess of unlabeled Bgtx, consistent with specific binding. Specific binding was not observed with uninjected oocytes, with oocytes expressing wild-type α3 and β4, nor with oocytes expressing β4/α1[11]Loop-C alone. In addition, the rates of dissociation of fluorescent Bgtx from oocytes expressing either of the two pharmatope-tagged β4 subunits were similar (data not shown). These results indicate that Bgtx binds to the pharmatope sequence introduced into either the N-terminal L1 region or the Loop C region of β4, but only in the latter position does it inhibit channel activation. We have shown that 11 contiguous amino acids from Loop C of the muscle-type α1 subunit have the capability to generate high affinity binding sites for Bgtx when introduced ectopically into the extracellular region of the non-α nAChR subunit, β4. Although insertion of the pharmatope sequence into the Loop C region produces Bgtx binding and functional block, the same pharmatope produces high affinity Bgtx binding but no detectable pharmacological activity when inserted into the N-terminal L1 loop. The ability of Bgtx to block ACh-evoked responses in nAChRs formed from co-expressed α3 and β4/α1[11]Loop-C subunits (Fig. 2; Table I) is unexpected based on the conventional view of Bgtx as a competitive inhibitor of ACh. Our results suggest that we have created an allosteric inhibitory site in β4. Furthermore, our findings are entirely consistent with structural considerations based on the crystal structure of the ACh-binding protein (Protein Data Bank accession code 1I9B), a homo-pentamer homologous to the extracellular domain of nAChRs (4Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Bgtx, the prototype of the α-neurotoxins, is a competitive inhibitor at the agonist binding site, which is situated at the subunit-subunit interface of the α subunit.(1Karlin A. Nat. Rev.

The introduction of a Bgtx-binding pharmatope into Loop C of the β4 subunit would be expected to direct Bgtx binding to the (+) face of the β4 subunit and diametrically away from the agonist binding site located at least one subunit interface away at the (-) face of the β4 subunit (Fig. 5). The distance from one subunit interface to the next, along the circumference of the extracellular domain at the level of Loop C, is predicted to be ∼40–50 Å. In comparison, Bgtx extends ∼40 Å in its longest dimension and, therefore, is incapable of interacting simultaneously with the pharmatope-tagged β4 Loop C and with Loop C of the α3 subunit. Consequently, no direct competitive interaction between ACh and Bgtx is expected based on the current structural model. The physical separation of the Bgtx binding site from the agonist binding site in β4/α1[11]Loop-C-bearing nAChRs offers the advantage that the full range of amino acid mutations can now be used to study the contribution of individual amino acids in Loop C to Bgtx binding. This has been technically difficult due to the overlap in determinants for Bgtx and agonist binding (19Tomaselli G.F. McLaughlin J.T. Jurman M.E. Hawrot E. Yellen G. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 721-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, mutational strategies can be used to improve further the affinity of Bgtx for the ectopic binding site. The proposed structural relationship of the Bgtx binding site relative to the agonist binding site in β4/α1[11]Loop-C-bearing nAChRs (Fig. 5) is strikingly reminiscent of the spatial relationship between the allosteric regulatory site in ligand-gated GABAA receptors and the agonist (GABA) binding site. Nicotinic and GABAA receptors belong to the same superfamily of Cys-loop ligand gated ion channels and share many structural features (1Karlin A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 4Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K.

In GABAA receptors, so-called inverse agonists of the β-carboline drug class bind at a subunit interface that is also responsible for the binding of the classic allosteric regulator, benzodiazepine (4Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

Today. 2003; 8: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Binding of benzodiazepine to this site potentiates the action of the neurotransmitter GABA, whereas binding of inverse agonists to the same site diminishes responsiveness to GABA, but not in a competitive manner. Current GABAA receptor models suggest that the inverse agonist binding site is at a subunit interface distinct from the GABA binding site and is formed by the Loop C region at the (+) face of the GABAA α subunit (e.g. α1) and the (-) face of the adjoining γ subunit (e.g. γ2 in the case of α1β2γ2, the most abundant GABAA receptor subtype in rat brain) (20Whiting P.J.

Meanwhile, the (-) face of the α subunit contributes to the adjoining GABA binding site in a manner homologous to the predicted contribution of the (-) face of the nicotinic β4 subunit to the ACh binding site in neuronal nAChRs (4Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

Today. 2003; 8: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which binding of inverse agonists to the benzodiazepine site in GABAA receptors produces inhibition of GABA-evoked currents is unknown, but a decrease in the frequency of GABA-evoked channel openings has been observed (25Rogers C.J. Twyman R.E. Macdonald R.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 475: 69-82Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The structural similarities between nicotinic and GABAA receptors suggest a mechanism common between the action of inverse agonists on GABAA receptors and the inhibition produced by Bgtx on β4/α1[11]Loop-C-bearing nAChRs. Furthermore, although several nicotinic potentiating ligands with allosteric characteristics have been described, their sites of action remain to be fully elucidated (26Pereira E.F. Hilmas C. Santos M.D. Alkondon M. Maelicke A. Albuquerque E.X. J. Neurobiol. 2002; 53: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 27Levandoski M.M. Piket B. Chang J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 471: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Our findings, together with analogies with the benzodiazepine site, would suggest that nicotinic non-α subunit interfaces should receive more attention as potential targets for drug discovery. What is the molecular mechanism responsible for the allosteric inhibition (Figs. 2 and 3) observed with chimeric β4/α1[11]Loop-C-bearing nAChRs? Based on the types of structural considerations described above, we propose that Bgtx interferes with rigid body-like subunit rotations that are normally essential for gating in neuronal nAChRs (Fig. 6). Such rotations along the subunit axis of quasi-symmetry have been suggested for the homomeric nAChRs, but to date, there is no direct evidence for this from the AChBP crystal structures (6Celie P.H. Van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. Van Dijk W.J. Brejc K. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 28Grutter T. Changeux J.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 459-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Based on electron microscopic studies of membranes enriched in muscle-type nAChR, it has been proposed that ACh binding evokes ∼15° axial rotations of the extracellular domain in the two α subunits of the receptor (29Unwin N. Nature. 1995; 373: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 30Unwin N. Miyazawa A. Li J. Fujiyoshi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1165-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 31Unwin N. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 32Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). However, no similar rotations in the non-α subunits, β1, γ, and δ, were observed, leading to models that emphasize the functional importance of α1 subunit rotations. Whether neuronal β subunits undergo ACh-evoked subunit rotations is currently unknown, but it is notable that the extracellular domains of neuronal β subunits have several features that make them more similar to α subunits than to the non-α subunits found in muscle-type nAChRs. Neuronal nAChR β subunits, unlike the muscle-type non-α subunits, contain the conserved Trp-149 (Torpedo numbering) and Tyr-93 (although β3, like α5, has a conserved aromatic Phe at this position) found in all α subunits, and their Loop F regions, located at the (-) face of the subunit interface, are identical in length to that of α subunits. This suggests that neuronal β subunits may be more likely to undergo subunit rotations akin to those seen in muscle-type α subunits. If such rotations are essential for gating, then a wrench-in-the-works-like interference due to a stabilization of the resting state subunit interface by bound Bgtx could be the mechanism underlying the functional blockade mediated by the β4/α1[11]-Loop-C subunit (Fig. 6). Alternatively, it is possible that Bgtx may prevent rotation of the α3 subunit by stabilizing the resting state β(+)α(-) interface of chimeric β4/α1[11]Loop-C subunit-containing nAChRs. In either case, the functional blockade of β4/α1[11]Loop-C subunit-containing nAChRs by Bgtx supports the view that rigid body-like subunit movements at subunit interfaces play an important role in receptor gating. Whether such movements are restricted to α subunits as suggested previously for muscle-type nAChRs or whether neuronal β subunits also undergo conformational movements of their extracellular domains remains to be fully elucidated. Previous studies have shown that neuronal nAChRs are pentameric with an expected stoichiometry of two α subunits and three β subunits (33Cooper E. Couturier S. Ballivet M. Nature. 1991; 350: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 34Anand R. Conroy W.G. Schoepfer R. Whiting P. Lindstrom J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11192-11198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This would suggest that our β4 chimera generate three potential Bgtx binding sites per receptor: two at the β(+)α(-) interfaces and one at the β(+)β(-) interface (Fig. 5). The Hill coefficient of ∼0.7, estimated from our dose-response analysis, argues that Bgtx needs to bind to only a single site on the receptor complex to produce functional inhibition. We do not presently know whether all three potential Bgtx binding sites per β4/α1[11]Loop-C-bearing receptor are capable of binding toxin and producing blockade. We have observed, however, that β4/α1[11]Loop-C-bearing receptors with α4 subunits substituting for α3 are somewhat less sensitive to Bgtx inhibition, suggesting that the (-) face of the α subunit may directly contribute to the introduced Bgtx binding site.2 This would suggest that it is binding to the β(+)α(-) interface that is responsible for the observed functional block. The successful introduction of a Bgtx-binding pharmatope into the extracellular domain of the β4 subunit suggests that similar modifications can be made to the other neuronal nAChR β subunits, and in preliminary studies, we find that insertion of a pharmatope sequence into Loop C of the rat β2 subunit also imparts functional Bgtx sensitivity. 2T. Sanders and E. Hawrot, unpublished observations. In addition, in those cases in which high affinity Bgtx binding is conferred in the absence of pharmacological sensitivity, such constructs would be of considerable utility for studies of receptor localization and metabolism given the many commercially available reporter group derivatives of Bgtx. The relatively small size of Bgtx (∼8 kDa) as compared with antibodies may offer a further advantage in tissue penetrance and accessibility. Finally, our findings offer the possibility that similar pharmatope sequences can be similarly inserted into the extracellular domains of other ligand-gated ion channels or, more broadly, into other membrane proteins for which appropriate probes are lacking.

To examine whether contractile performance and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transport of the diabetic heart can be rescued by targeting the kallikrein-kinin system, we studied left ventricular function and sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+ uptake after induction of streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus in transgenic rats expressing the human tissue kallikrein-1 gene. Six weeks after a single injection of either streptozotocin (70 mg/kg ip) or vehicle, left ventricular performance was determined using a Millar-Tip catheter system. The Ca2+-transporting activity of reticulum-derived membrane vesicles was determined in left ventricular homogenates as oxalate-supported 45Ca2+ uptake. Western blot analysis was used to quantify the reticular Ca2+-ATPase SERCA2a, phospholamban, and the phosphorylation status of the latter. Contractile performance and Ca2+ uptake activity were similar in nondiabetic wild-type and transgenic rats. Severely diabetic wild-type animals exhibited impaired left ventricular performance and decreased reticular Ca2+ uptake (-39% vs. wild-type rats, P<0.05, respectively). These changes were attenuated in diabetic transgenic rats that, in addition, exhibited a markedly increased phospholamban phosphorylation at the Ca2+/calmodulin kinase-specific site threonine17 (2.2-fold vs. diabetic wild-type rats, P<0.05). These transgene-related effects were abolished after treatment with the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist icatibant (Hoe 140). The SERCA2-to-phospholamban ratio, phosphoserine16-phospholamban levels, and the apparent affinity for Ca2+ of the uptake reaction did not differ between the groups. Increasing the activity of the kallikrein-kinin system by expressing a human kallikrein-1 transgene protects rat heart against diabetes-induced contractile and reticular Ca2+ transport dysfunctions. An increased phosphorylation of the SERCA2 regulatory protein phospholamban at threonine17 via a B2 receptor-mediated mechanism is thereby involved."

The epidermis arises from a single-cell layer ectoderm during embryogenesis. Large proliferative capacity is central to ectodermal cell and basal keratinocyte function. DP-1, a heterodimeric partner of E2F transcription factors, is highly expressed in the ectoderm and all epidermal layers during embryogenesis. To investigate the role of DP-1 in epidermal morphogenesis, we inhibited DP-1 activity through exogenous expression of a dominant-negative mutant (dnDP-1). Expression of the dnDP-1 mutant interferes with binding of E2F/DP-1 heterodimers to DNA and inhibits DNA replication, as well as cyclin A mRNA and protein expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that the cyclin A promoter is predominantly bound in proliferating keratinocytes by complexes containing E2F-3 and E2F-4. Thus, the mechanisms of decreased expression of cyclin A in the presence of dnDP-1 seem to involve inactivation of DP-1 complexes containing E2F-3 and E2F-4. To assess the consequences on epidermal morphogenesis of inhibiting DP-1 activity, we expressed dnDP-1 in rat epithelial keratinocytes in organotypic culture and observed that DP-1 inhibition negatively affected stratification of these cells. Likewise, expression of dnDP-1 in embryonic ectoderm explants produced extensive disorganization of subsequently formed epidermal basal and suprabasal layers, interfering with normal epidermal formation. We conclude that DP-1 activity is required for normal epidermal morphogenesis and ectoderm-to-epidermis transition.

It prevents loss of water and electrolytes, provides a barrier against the external environment, and is an integral component of the endocrine, immune, and nervous systems (for review, see Refs. 1Chuong C.M.

Genet. 2002; 3: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Two layers form the skin, the outer epidermis and the inner dermis. The epidermis is a complex stratified squamous epithelium formed by one basal and several suprabasal keratinocyte layers (for review, see Ref. 3Fuchs E. Byrne C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The epidermis is constantly subjected to mechanical and chemical insults; as a result, its upper layers are constantly shed and replenished by underlying keratinocytes. This process allows the removal of damaged cells without compromising barrier function. The basal layer contains undifferentiated keratinocytes with high proliferative capacity, which allows them to continuously replenish the suprabasal layers. The stem cells necessary for this process reside in various regions, including the basal layer, and bulge areas in the hair follicles (2Fuchs E. Raghavan S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 4Niemann C. Watt F.M.

In the mouse, as early as 9.5 days postcoitus (dpc), 1The abbreviations used are: dpc, days postcoitus; HA, hemagglutinin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; REK, rat epithelial keratinocytes; PFA, paraformaldehyde; β-gal, β-galactosidase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; dn, dominant-negative; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TCA, trichloroacetic acid; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; H&E, hematoxylin and eosin.1The abbreviations used are: dpc, days postcoitus; HA, hemagglutinin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; REK, rat epithelial keratinocytes; PFA, paraformaldehyde; β-gal, β-galactosidase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; dn, dominant-negative; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TCA, trichloroacetic acid; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; H&E, hematoxylin and eosin. the single-layered ectoderm begins to express epithelial markers such as keratins 8 and 18 (5Jackson B.W. ground C. Winter S. Franke W.W. Illmensee K. Differentiation. 1981; 20: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Between 9 and 12 dpc, the ectoderm undergoes stratification, producing a second transitory layer termed the periderm (for review, see Ref. 6Byrne C. Hardman M.J. Nield K. J. Anat. 2003; 202: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). At this stage, the epidermal keratins 14 and 5 are expressed (7Byrne C. Tainsky M. Fuchs E. Development. 1994; 120: 2369-2383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating the commitment of the embryonic ectoderm to form a mature epidermis. Further stratification of the ectoderm gives rise to the first signs of hair follicle induction (8McGowan K.M. Coulombe P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 469-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and to an intermediate layer termed the stratum intermedium, which differentiates and later gives rise to the first spinous and granular cell layers of the mature epidermis by 15–16 dpc. The final stages of differentiation include the formation of a stratum corneum and acquisition of barrier function, just before birth.An essential feature of both the ectoderm and the basal epidermal layer is their capacity to proliferate. The ectoderm needs to rapidly expand coordinately with the growing embryo, whereas basal keratinocytes must continuously replenish the epidermis and, in the event of wounding, generate enough new cells to efficiently repair the damage. Central to the control of cell proliferation is the E2F family of transcription factors. This family consists of two subgroups of proteins, termed E2F and DP. To date, seven E2f and two Dp genes have been identified (9De Bruin A. Maiti B. Jakoi L. Timmers C. Leone G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42041-42049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 10Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). In most cases, the functional E2F unit consists of a heterodimer composed of one E2F and one DP protein. The E2F/DP network regulates the expression of genes necessary for transit through G1 to S phase of the cell cycle, and for DNA replication (for review, see Refs. 10Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar, 11La Thangue N.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 587-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 12Stevaux O. Dyson N.J.

E2F/DP factors fulfill other functions unrelated to G1/S progression, such as modulation of apoptosis, DNA repair, mitosis, and expression of homeobox genes (12Stevaux O. Dyson N.J. Curr. Opin.

DP-1 also mediates interactions with other factors that are probably involved in chromatin modulation (25de la Luna S. Allen K.E. Mason S.L. La Thangue N.B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 212-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26Hsu S.I.-H. Yang C.M. Sim K.G. Hentschel D.M. O'Leary E. Bonventre J.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2273-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Targeted inactivation of the Dp-1 locus in mice causes severe abnormalities in the development of extraembryonic tissues, which lead to embryonic lethality between 10.5 and 11.5 dpc (27Kohn M.J. Bronson R.T. Harlow E. Dyson N.J. Yamasaki L. Development. 2003; 130: 1295-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), although the precise mechanisms leading to this phenotype remain unclear.The early embryonic lethality of DP-1-/- mice precludes the investigation of the role that DP-1 proteins play in the development of the epidermis. To address this issue, we examined the alterations in keratinocyte growth and epidermal morphogenesis after functional inactivation of DP-1, using primary keratinocyte monolayers and organotypic cultures exogenously expressing a dominant-negative DP-1 mutant. We demonstrate that interference with DP-1 activity abrogates normal proliferation of basal keratinocytes, development of the epidermis from the embryonic ectoderm, and keratinocyte stratification.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and Antibodies—Chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Primary antibodies and their suppliers are as follows: E2F-1, and E2F-2 from Neomarkers; cyclin A, cyclin E, E2F-3, E2F-4, E2F-5, and DP-1 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-HA (PRB-101P) from Covance, E7 anti-β-tubulin from the Iowa University Hybridoma Bank; p21 from Calbiochem; p27 from BD Biosciences Transduction Laboratories, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from Biogenesis. The anti-involucrin antibody was purchased from Babco. Anti-keratin 14 and anti-keratin 10 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Neomarkers. Secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories.Plasmids and Recombinant Adenoviruses—In situ hybridization experiments were conducted using a cDNA probe corresponding to the C terminus and 3′-untranslated region of murine DP-1 (28Dagnino L. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Mech. Dev. 1997; 66: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding a C-terminal HA-tagged murine DP-1 mutant lacking amino acid residues 103–126, herein termed dnDP-1, was generated by PCR. The dnDP-1 or β-gal cDNAs were cloned into pAdtrack-CMV, which were used to generate the corresponding recombinant adenoviruses using the pAdEasy system (29He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3229) Google Scholar). All pAdEasy adenoviruses generated also encode green fluorescent protein (GFP). Viral stocks were amplified in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, purified through CsCl gradients, and titered by dilution assay in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Titers were expressed as colony-forming units, based on the number of GFP-positive cells observed with each dilution.In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization experiments were conducted on 8-μm frozen sections from developmentally staged CD-1 embryos (28Dagnino L. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Mech. Dev. 1997; 66: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30Dagnino L. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 553-563PubMed Google Scholar). The sections were fixed in 4% PFA, digested with proteinase K (20 μg/ml, 7.5 min, 25 °C), and acetylated (0.1 m triethanolamine, pH 8.0, and 25% acetic anhydride, 10 min, 25 °C). Tissue sections were dehydrated with ethanol, allowed to air-dry, and hybridized to a [α-33P]UTP-labeled sense or antisense DP-1 probe (40,000 cpm/μl). After hybridization, the sections were rinsed, treated with RNase A (20 μg/ml, 37 °C, 30 min), and sequentially washed with 2× SSC, 1× SSC, 0.5× SSC (37 °C, 10 min), and 0.1× SSC (65 °C, 30 min). After dehydration, sections were coated with photographic emulsion (Kodak NBT-2) and stored for 1–3 weeks. After development, the tissues were stained with Harris' hematoxylin and eosin. These experiments were conducted three times using embryos from different litters, with similar results.Embryonic Ectoderm Explant Cultures and Histology—Vibrissae explant cultures were established from CD-1 embryos, modifying procedures described previously (31Botchkarev V.A. Botchkareva N.V. Roth W. Nakamura M. Chen L.-H. Herzong W. Lindner G. McMahon J.A. Peters C. Lauster R. McMahon A.P. Paus R. Nat.

In particular, 12.5–13.5 embryos were harvested, and vibrissa pads were isolated and placed on sterile gelatin sponges (Gelfoam; Upjohn) with the ectoderm side up. The sponges were transferred to culture inserts in a two-chamber tissue culture system; the lower chamber contained DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml; Invitrogen). Explants were cultured at 37 °C, with growth medium changes every 2 days. For adenovirus-mediated gene transfer experiments, 1-day-old explants were immersed for 5 h at 37 °C in serum-free DMEM containing the appropriate adenovirus used at 108 colony-forming units/ml. The infection medium in the upper and lower insert chambers was removed, and fresh FBS-containing DMEM was added to the lower chamber. At the end of the culture periods, explants were washed with PBS, embedded in Tissue-Tek (OCT compund; Sakura) or 7.5% gelatin, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections (7 μm) were obtained, fixed in 4% PFA, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and mounted using Permount (Fisher Scientific). For β-gal staining, PFA-fixed cryosections were washed twice with PBS, incubated in the dark for 16–20 h at 37 °C in a solution containing 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml X-gal, and 0.02% Nonidet P-40 in PBS (35Kulessa H. Turk G. Hogan B.L.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6664-6674Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The stained tissues were washed twice in PBS, fixed in 4% PFA (4 °C, 16 h), dehydrated with 2-propanol as the final step instead of xylene (to prevent leaching of the blue precipitate), and mounted using Permount.REK Organotypic Cultures—REK cells were plated on a basal lamina-containing collagen substrate and cultured to allow stratification as described previously (36Tammi R.H. Tammi M.I. Hascall C.C. Hogg M. Pasonen S. MacCallum D.K. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 113: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In brief, to first generate a basal lamina, confluent MDCK monolayers were cultured onto collagen gels in a Transwell insert for 22 days. The cells were lysed (Buffer H: 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5) and solubilized (0.2% deoxycholate in buffer H, followed by 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in buffer H), and the basal lamina-coated collagen was extensively rinsed with DMEM. Confluent REK monolayers seeded onto the prepared collagen were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 8% FBS at the air-liquid interface for up to 9 days to allow stratification.Direct and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Frozen sections from embryonic explants or REK organotypic cultures (7 μm) were fixed with 4% PFA and permeabilized (0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, 4 °C, 15 min). After two PBS washes, the sections were blocked in PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 5% goat serum (2 h, 22 °C), followed by incubation with the appropriate primary antibody (1 h, 22 °C). After three 20-min PBS washes, the cells were probed with a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody at 22 °C for 1 h. After removal of the secondary antibody, the cells were rinsed twice, incubated with Hoescht 33258 (10 μg/ml) in PBS for 5 min at 22 °C, rinsed five times with PBS, and mounted in anti-fade medium (DakoCytomation). GFP was visualized in fixed sections by direct fluorescence. Photomicrographs were obtained with a Leica DMIRBE microscope equipped with an Orca II digital camera (Hamamatsu, Japan), using Openlab 3.0 software (Improvision, Coventry, UK).Cell Culture and Adenovirus Infection—Primary epidermal keratinocytes were isolated from 2-day-old CD-1 mice and cultured in Ca2+-free Eagle's minimum essential medium (Cambrex Bio Science) supplemented with 8% FBS previously treated with Chelex resin (Bio-Rad) and epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml, Invitrogen), as described previously (37D'Souza S.J.A. Pajak A. Balazsi K. Dagnino L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23531-23538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All experiments were conducted 3–6 days after keratinocyte isolation. REK cells, a line of rat neonatal epidermal keratinocytes (38Baden H.P. Kubilus J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1983; 80: 124-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 39MacCallum D.K. Lillie J.H. Skin. Pharmacol. 1990; 3: 86-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were a generous gift from Drs. E. Maytin and V. Hascall, and were cultured as monolayers in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 8% FBS. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in DMEM containing 8% FBS. Viral infections were conducted by incubating primary keratinocytes in serum- and Ca2+-free Eagle's minimum essential medium with the appropriate adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 50 for 3–4 h, followed by culture in normal growth medium. Under these conditions, ≥90% of primary mouse keratinocytes were infected, as confirmed by X-gal staining or GFP fluorescence, respectively, in cells infected with β-gal- or GFP-encoding virus. Adenovirus infection of REK cells was conducted in serum-free DMEM, at a multiplicity of infection of 200, followed by culture in normal growth medium for 24 h before fluorescence-activated cell sorting.Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation Assays—Whole-cell keratinocyte extracts were prepared for immunoblot and analyzed as described previously (40Vespa A. Darmon A.J. Turner C.E. D'Souza S.J.A. Dagnino L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11528-11535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation experiments, keratinocytes were harvested and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 250 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.4 mm NaF, 0.4 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, and 0.1 mm EDTA). Lysates were pre-cleared by incubation with protein A and protein G-Sepharose (2 h, 4 °C; Amersham Biosciences), before being incubated at 4 °C for 16 h with the appropriate primary antibody for immunoprecipitation. Incubation with secondary antibodies (2 h, 22 °C) was followed by protein A or protein G-Sepharose, as appropriate (2 h, 22 °C), and extensive washes with lysis buffer A. Immune complexes bound to the Sepharose beads were dissociated with sample buffer (5 min, 95 °C) and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Whole-cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer A. Each binding reaction was prepared and analyzed using 5–25 μg of cellular protein as described previously (37D'Souza S.J.A. Pajak A. Balazsi K. Dagnino L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23531-23538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).[3H]dThd Incorporation into DNA, Flow Cytometry, and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting—Incorporation of [3H]dThd into DNA was measured from TCA-insoluble keratinocyte fractions as described previously (37D'Souza S.J.A. Pajak A. Balazsi K. Dagnino L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23531-23538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For flow cytometry analysis, keratinocytes were infected at 0 or 48 h after isolation and harvested at the indicated times after infection. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS, trypsinized, fixed using cold methanol (-20 °C), and analyzed immediately or stored in methanol at -20 °C. Just before analysis, cells were washed with PBS, and suspended for 30 min in 50 mm HEPES with 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, to prevent clumping. The cells were treated with RNaseA (50 μg/ml, final) and propidium iodide (10 μg/ml), and analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using the CellQuest program. The data were analyzed using ModFit software. REK cells were infected with adenovirus encoding GFP and β-galactosidase or GFP and dnDP-1, and 24 h later, they were harvested and suspended in PBS with 10% FBS (1–2 × 106 cells/ml). Cells were sorted using a FACS Vantage sorter (BD Biosciences), using an Enterprise II laser (488 nm). Viable cells with GFP fluorescence were isolated and plated on collagen substrates (300,000 cells/sample) to form organotypic cultures.Cyclin A mRNA Abundance—Cyclin A mRNA levels were measured using a quantitative reverse transcription PCR method (15D'Souza S.J.A. Vespa A. Murkherjee S. Maher A. Pajak S. Dagnino L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10626-10632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) from total RNA prepared from cultured keratinocytes infected with recombinant adenovirus encoding β-gal or dnDP-1 or from uninfected controls. Reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification was conducted on at least two different RNA samples (1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed, and cDNA equivalent to 0.1 μg RNA was used in each PCR reaction). The primers used were, for cyclin A, 5′-CCCCCAGAAGTAGCAGAGTTTGTG and 5′-CATGTTGTGGCGCTTTGAGGTAGG, which amplify a 400-bp fragment, and for GAPDH, 5′-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC and 5′-GTTGCCATCAACGACCCCTT, or 5′-GCTTCACCACCTTCTTGATGTCATC and 5′-GTTGCCATCAACGACCCCTT. PCR fragments obtained at 18, 20, 22, and 24 amplification cycles were resolved by electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized to appropriate 32P-labeled probes. The signals were detected and quantified using filmless autoradiographic analysis (Canberra Industries) and normalized to GAPDH products amplified in the same reactions. For each cDNA, amplification was quantified by filmless autoradiographic analysis at multiple PCR cycles (18–24 cycles). Amplification of all cDNAs tested was logarithmic within these parameters.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays were conducted as described by Shang et al. (41Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar), with some modifications. In particular, keratinocyte cultures were incubated with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, harvested by scraping in buffer B (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.4, and 10 mm dithiothreitol), and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. Cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed in 450 μl of buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each pepstatin and aprotinin) for 10 min on ice. Chromatin was sonicated to an average size of 500–2000 bp. After centrifugation to remove cellular debris, the chromatin was diluted 10-fold with dilution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100). 1 ml of the diluted chromatin, corresponding to 2 × 106 cells, was precleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose (45 μl of a 50% slurry), 2 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and 2 μg of normal rabbit IgG for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation to remove the protein A-Sepharose, the chromatin was subjected to immunoprecipitation, using 2 μg of the appropriate rabbit anti-E2F antibody. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to five 10-min washes with ice-cold dilution buffer, followed by sequential washes with low-salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100), high-salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 2 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS), LiCl buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.25 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1% sodium deoxycholate), and three Tris-EDTA (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 1 mm EDTA) washes. The chromatin was eluted by incubating thrice with 100 μl of elution buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3 and 1% SDS, 10 min, 22 °C). After cross-linking reversal and proteinase K digestion, the chromatin was purified through Qiagen PCR purification columns, eluting the samples in 30 μl of H2O. Amplification of a 300-bp fragment containing cyclin A promoter sequences was conducted with 5 μl of purified chromatin and specific primers (5′-CGGACGCCCTCATTGGTTTATT-3′ and 5′-ATTCTCTTGGTCTTCCTGATGC-3′).RESULTSDP-1 Expression in Embryonic Ectoderm and Stratified Epidermis—To begin to understand the role of DP-1 during epidermal morphogenesis, we first analyzed its patterns of expression in embryonic ectoderm and epidermis. In situ hybridization analysis of the single-cell layered ectoderm in 10.5-dpc embryos revealed DP-1 expression (Fig. 1). DP-1 transcripts were also detected in 14.5-dpc embryos, in which the ectoderm had given rise to the stratum intermedium and stratum basale (Fig. 1). DP-1 expression increased substantially in fully stratified epidermis in 17.5-dpc embryos. At this stage, DP-1 transcripts were detected in all epidermal layers and epidermal appendages, including the hair follicles (Fig. 1). Thus, DP-1 is likely to play an important role in the ectoderm-to-epidermis transition, as well as in keratinocyte stratification in the fully developed epidermis.Inhibition of E2F/DP DNA Binding Activity and Interaction wi"
https://openalex.org/W2094098428,"We have employed the hybrid hammerhead ribozyme-based gene discovery system for identification of genes functionally involved in muscle differentiation using in vitro myoblast differentiation assay. The major muscle regulatory genes (MyoD1, Mylk, myosin, myogenin, and Myf5) were identified endorsing the validity of this method. Other gene targets included tumor suppressors and cell cycle regulators (p19ARF and p21WAF1), FGFR-4, fibronectin, Prkg2, Pdk4, fem, and six novel proteins. Functional involvement of three of the identified targets in myoblast differentiation was confirmed by their specific knockdown using ribozymes and siRNA. Besides demonstrating a simple and an effective method of isolation of gene functions involved in muscle differentiation, we report for the first time that overexpression of Fem, a member of the sex-determining family of proteins, caused accelerated myotube formation, and its targeting deferred myoblast differentiation. This functional gene screening is not only helpful in understanding the molecular pathways of muscle differentiation but also to design molecular strategies for myopathologic therapies.

Hammerhead ribozymes (HH-Rz) are among the smallest catalytic RNAs that have been used widely in molecular biology, biotechnology, and biomedicine (3Stage-Zimmermann T.K. Uhlenbeck O.C.

These RNAs fold into their active conformation by the binding of metal ions and cleave oligoribonucleotides at specific sites (NUX, where N can be any nucleotide and X can be A, C, or U) by mechanisms that have been widely studied in the last two decades (8Verma S. Vaish N.K. Eckstein F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 532-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 9Takagi Y. Suyama E. Kawasaki H. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Biochem. Soc.

Hammerhead ribozymes recognize the target gene sequence by recognition arms at the 5′- and 3′-ends of its catalytic core. Thus for making a gene-specific ribozyme, its recognition arms (7-9 nucleotides each) are designed to include sequence complementary to the target mRNA. Randomization of these 7-9 nucleotides in each arm yields a large variety of ribozymes capable of targeting multiple mRNA substrates. Such a pool of randomized ribozymes (library) expressed from a pol III promoter were generated and used as an efficient gene discovery system (11Kruger M. Beger C. Li Q.X. Welch P.J. Tritz R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; : 133-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In contrast to the DNA microarrays and yeast two-hybrid systems, the ribozyme-based screening system has the potential to isolate genes directly involved in the phenomenon of interest. In this system, a randomized ribozyme library is expressed into the cells that are screened for a loss or gain of a biological phenotype. Isolation and sequence analysis of ribozymes from selected cells depicting the phenotype of interest was performed. The putative target mRNAs for the ribozymes isolated from cells were then predicted by DNA data base searches. Successful inactivation of a specific gene in vivo by ribozymes depends on the appropriate design of the expression vector, level of expression, and its subcellular localization. Various improvements in designing ribozymes and their level of expression have been made in this regard (14Koseki S. Tanabe T. Tani K. Asano S. Shioda T. Nagai Y. Shimada T. Ohkawa J. Taira K. J.

Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 252: 257-265PubMed Google Scholar). Besides target gene accessibility that plays a major role has been improved by designing the hybrid ribozymes that coupled the cleavage activity of hammerhead ribozymes with the unwinding activity of RNA helicase (22Warashina M.

These helicase-coupled hybrid ribozymes were far more effective in the cleavage of target mRNAs than their conventional counterparts (25Kawasaki H. Taira K. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Wadhwa R. Ando H. Kawasaki H. Taira K. Kaul S.C. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, libraries of hybrid ribozymes with randomized binding arms were predicted to have enhanced efficiency for rapid isolation of functional genes. Indeed, these were successfully used for isolation of genes involved in apoptosis (25Kawasaki H. Taira K. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Kawasaki H. Onuki R.

In the present study, we have used this novel, simple, efficient, and powerful method for isolation of genes involved in muscle differentiation in an in vitro cellular model system. Skeletal muscle differentiation is characterized by muscle-specific gene expression, terminal withdrawal of cells from the cell cycle, their fusion into multinucleated cells, and assembly of the contractile apparatus (34Taylor M.V. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R964-R966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of studies in the recent past has unraveled the role of myogenic transcription factors, chromatin-modifying enzymes in initiation, and regulation of muscle differentiation (35McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 36Pownall M.E. Gustafsson M.K. Emerson Jr., C.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 747-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Characterization of signaling cascades and gene functions involved in muscle differentiation is extremely valuable for understanding the biology of muscle disorders including myopathies, muscular dystrophy, and spinal muscular atrophy that involve deregulation of muscle differentiation (37Amack J.D. Mahadevan M.S. Dev. Biol. 2004; 265: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mouse myoblast cell line, C2C12, provides an easy and convenient system to study myocyte differentiation. These cells can be differentiated in culture medium containing horse serum and harvested at various time points to characterize the expression profiles of known cell cycle and myogenic regulatory factors by immunoblot analysis (38Shen X. Collier J.M. Hlaing M. Zhang L. Delshad E.H. Bristow J. Bernstein H.S. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 226: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We were able to interrupt differentiation of C2C12 cells by introduction of a randomized ribozyme library. Functional involvement of the predicted targets was confirmed by specific knockdown of genes by ribozymes or siRNA. We demonstrate (i) the isolation of key regulators of muscle differentiation by the Rz-mediated functional gene discovery system validating the worth of this gene discovery system, (ii) the functional involvement of the tumor suppressor genes (p19ARF and p21WAF1) in muscle differentiation implicating the significance of cell cycle regulation, and (iii) a novel gene (fem1) function involved in muscle differentiation. Construction of Randomized Hammerhead Ribozyme Libraries—Chemically synthesized oligonucleotides encoding ribozyme sequences with randomized substrate binding arms and a pol III termination sequence were converted to double-stranded sequences by PCR as described previously (27Kawasaki H. Onuki R. Suyama E. Taira K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After digestion with Csp45I and KpnI, the fragments were cloned downstream of the tRNA promoter in pUC-dt, and ribozymes were transcribed in vitro using AmpliScribe T7 transcription kit (Epicenter Technologies, Madison, WI) (25Kawasaki H. Taira K. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Kawasaki H. Onuki R. Suyama E. Taira K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To generate poly(A)-connected Rz expression vectors, we inserted a poly(A) sequence of 60 nucleotides between the ribozyme and pol III termination sequence (Fig. 1, A and B). In the case of Rz expression retroviral vectors, ribozyme libraries were inserted into EcoRI and BamH I sites in the pMX-puro vector (25Kawasaki H. Taira K. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Infection, and Screening for Functional Genes—Mouse myoblasts C2C12 were used for assay. These were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin and fungizone (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air in a humidified incubator. Cells were induced to undergo muscle differentiation by culturing in the medium supplemented with 2% horse serum. pMX-puro/Rz library (8-10 μg of DNA per 10-cm dish) was transfected into mouse packaging cells, PLAT-E, using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Cells were incubated with the DNA mixture overnight at 37 °C and then transferred at 32 °C for 48 h in normal Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to allow the packaging of DNA into the infectious viral particles. Culture medium was collected, filtered, and used as viral solution after an addition of polybrene (8 μg/ml). C2C12 cells were infected for 16 h followed by selection in puromycin (2 μg/ml)-supplemented medium for 24-48 h. Selected cells were then induced to differentiate. Undifferentiating and dividing cells were isolated from the differentiating nondividing cells by ring isolation. These were expanded and re-subjected to differentiating medium in a second round of selection. Undifferentiating clones were similarly tested through the third round of differentiation. RNA was prepared from undifferentiating clones using Isogen (Invitrogen). Total RNA (2 μg) was used for reverse transcriptase-PCR. It was reverse-transcribed using lower primer (5′-TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTG GTA C-3′) and MMLV transcriptase (42 °C, 90 min). Reverse-transcribed product was subjected to PCR amplification using upper (5′-tcc ccg gtt cga aac cgg gca-3′) and lower primers (94 °C-52 °C-72 °C/30 s each, 20 cycles). The amplified PCR product (∼150 bp) was cloned into a TA cloning vector (Promega) and sequenced using the T7 primer. Construction of Gene-specific Ribozymes and siRNA Expression Vectors—RNA polymerase III-driven hammerhead ribozyme expression plasmids for p19ARF and p21WAF1 were made as described (26Wadhwa R. Ando H. Kawasaki H. Taira K. Kaul S.C. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 39Kato Y. Kuwabara T. Warashina M. Toda H. Taira K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15378-15385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The empty vector containing the tRNA sequence but without ribozyme was used as a negative control. For construction of siRNA expression vectors, the U6 promoter vector was used (40Miyagishi M. Taira K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Target sites for siRNA were selected using an algorithm (www.igene-therapeutics.co.jp). Sequences of the Rz and siRNA sites chosen for different genes are listed in Table II. In a typical example, sense (5′-caccGttGCtCACTtCAAGAGAGgtgtgctgtccCTCTCTTGGAGTGGGCGGCtttttt-3′) and antisense (5′-GCATaaaaaaGCCGCCCACTCCAAGAGAGggacagcacacCTCTCTTGaAGTGaGCaaC-3′) oligos were made; bold letters represent the target site sequence. C to T and G to A mutations (shown by lowercase bold letters) were inserted in the sense strand only. 5 μl of 100 μm sense and antisense oligos for a target site were mixed and annealed in 100-150 mm NaCl in a final volume (20 μl) using thermal cycler (99 °C for 2 min; 72 °C to 4 °C slope in 2 h). Annealed oligos were diluted (1:200), and 2 μl was ligated to a BspM I cut and gel-purified pciPur vector (40Miyagishi M. Taira K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) using high ligation kit (Takara). Plasmid DNA prepared from the transformed bacteria was sequenced with a vector primer (CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC) for confirmation of the integrity of the cloned DNA fragments.Table IITarget site sequences of ribozymes and siRNA constructsRz/siRNATarget site sequenceRz 19-1ccgctgctgnactccctcaRz 19-2agaacctgcnacccatgctRz 19-3cctcacagtnaccaagaacRz 19-4gatcctctcnagcctcaacRz 19-5aagagctgcnacgtgaacgRz 21-1gaccgaaganacaacggcaRz 21-4cctcctgganacagcccgcsiRNA 19-84gttgctcacttcaagagagsiRNA 19-440gtgagaacatcaagatatcsiRNA 21-59agagttgattgaattcaacsiRNA 21-625atagatttctatcatttcasiRNA Fem-1000atttcatgttataaaggacsiRNA Fem-2203gtcataaacttgcacagac Open table in a new tab Analysis of Functional Involvement of Genes during Muscle Differentiation—C2C12 cells were transfected with specific ribozyme or with siRNA gene knockdown constructs using LipofectAMINE™ PLUS (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were selected in puromycin (2.5 μg/ml)-supplemented medium for 2-4 days and then subjected to differentiation. Vector-transfected cells were used as control. Myotube formation was monitored in control and in gene knockdown cells. Expression of muscle-specific genes in control and gene knockdown cells were analyzed by Western blotting with specific antibodies as given below. Western Blot Analysis—Immunoassays were performed as described (26Wadhwa R. Ando H. Kawasaki H. Taira K. Kaul S.C. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Anti-myogenin (F5D, Santa Cruz), anti-p21WAF1 (C-19, Santa Cruz), anti-V5 (Invitrogen), and anti-actin (Chemicon) antibodies were used. The immunocomplexes formed were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using ECL PLUS kit (Amersham Biosciences). Immunostaining—C2C12 cells and its derivatives (transfected with either expression or siRNA plasmids for fem1 as indicated) were induced for differentiation by incubating in the growth medium supplemented with 2% horse serum. Cells were fixed with methanol/acetone (1:1) at various time points and then stained with anti-MHC antibody (Novocastra). Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes) antibody was used as secondary antibody. The cells were examined on a Carl Zeiss microscope. Abrogation of C2C12Differentiation with Randomized Hybrid Ribozyme Library—To explore the genes functionally involved in muscle differentiation, C2C12 myoblasts were infected with randomized ribozyme library and subjected to differentiation medium as shown in Fig. 1C. Whereas control (empty vector-infected) cells formed full myotubes in 72-96 h in differentiation medium (Fig. 2, panels a and c), cells infected with the randomized ribozyme library showed significant abrogation of myotube formation (Fig. 2, panels b and d). Undifferentiating cells that continued to divide formed small colonies against the background of differentiating cells that fused to form myotubes (Fig. 2, panel b). We isolated 96 and 12 undifferentiating clones from the Rz- and empty vector-infected cultures, respectively (Fig. 2). Cells were expanded to 60-70% confluency in 48- and 24-well plates for second and third rounds of selection for undifferentiating clones. We obtained 67 undifferentiating clones from the Rz-infected culture and none from the empty vector-infected culture. Ribozymes were recovered from the undifferentiating cells by reverse transcriptase-PCR, and the sequence of these ribozymes was obtained as shown in the scheme in Fig. 1C and described under “Materials and Methods.” Candidate Genes for C2C12Differentiation—Known key regulators of muscle differentiation by three rounds of selection, we isolated 67 independent undifferentiating C2C12 derivative clones. Ribozyme sequences recovered from these clones matched with 33 different target sites that aligned to 24 different mRNAs (Table I). Five (MyoD1, Mylk, myosin, myogenin, and Myf5) out of the twenty-four were the genes specifically expressed in muscles. Myf5 is the first gene to be expressed followed by myogenin, myoD, and myf6 during embryonic muscle development in mice. Its expression is detected in mononucleated myoblasts whereas myogenin and myoD accumulate in mono- and multinucleated myogenic cells (41Rohwedel J. Maltsev V. Bober E. Arnold H.H. Hescheler J. Wobus A.M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 87-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). MyoD and Myf5 are master regulatory genes for myogenic determination, and myogenin and myosin (muscle structural proteins) are important for terminal differentiation and lineage maintenance (42Wei Q. Paterson B.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 43Franchini M. Recent Prog. Med. 2003; 94: 478-483PubMed Google Scholar). Although Mylk (myosin light chain kinase), and myosin are known to be involved mainly in muscle contractility (44Lazar V. Garcia J.G. Genomics. 1999; 57: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), our data suggest that they may also be involved in muscle differentiation. Based on the characteristics and known function of the isolated genes, their detection strongly validated the use of ribozyme-based functional gene discovery approach.Table IRibozyme sequences and their putative target genesNo.Rz sequenceNo.Putative target1gcttctatngccgccac4Myogenic differentiation 1 (Myod1)2tcatcatagnagtcgtc3Myogenic differentiation 1 (Myod1)3gcttctatngccgccac3Myogenic differentiation 1 (Myod1)4gacgacttntatgatga3Myogenic differentiation 1 (Myod1)5agcactgtncaggccag2Myosin light chain kinase (Mylk)6ttcagcgcnagctgtcg3Myosin heavy polypeptide 47aaaacgcanactcctgt1Myosin X mRNA8agcaccctgntcaacccca2Myogenin (Myog)9gaggaagtncactacc2Myogenic factor 5 (Myf5)10ccaagagtngcagcctt3Myogenic factor 5 (Myf5)11gggcaactnaaaaagaa2Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (p27)12ttcccaggnacaggctag4Alternative reading frame exon 1, p19ARF13tgtgtgtnttaattatt3Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21)14agcagcgtnaggcctctg3Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (Fgfr4)15agtaagagnaaggtata2Fibronectin 116cattctgcncagaccat1Fibronectin 117tataccttnctcttact2Fibronectin 118gacaactgnactcgcgt3Protein kinase, cGMP-dependent, type II-Prkg219cnacagggnagggggac2Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 420tcggcgtcnatcatat35-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor 2 A-Htr2a21taaaagctnagcctcga2Fem-1 homolog (C. elegans) (fem1c)22tagggcatnccaggcga4Fem-1 homolog (C. elegans) (fem1c)23tcgcctggnatgcccta1Fem-1 homolog (C. elegans) (fem1c)24tgctcgcgcnatccgcg3GCIP-interacting protein p2925cgccatgtnagaaccgg2Zinc finger protein 100 (Zfp100)26gtccactngccaacta4RIKEN cDNA 9330159N0527aagtcatgnaggcttgc4RIKEN cDNA 9030407H2028ttctcgctgnagtttat3RIKEN cDNA 1700025D1929tggagacanaatggaa2RIKEN cDNA 2410015A1530gggcgtgtnaggtgtgt2RIKEN cDNA 4933405K1831tctgggtggnaaatctta1RIKEN cDNA 6820443O0632tgccctgtnatgtttg1RIKEN cDNA A630095P1433gtgcctggnaccccccc1RIKEN cDNA A930024E05 Open table in a new tab Genes Involved in Extracellular Signaling: Fibronectin and FGFR4—Five ribozymes matched to three independent sites on fibronectin. Integrin-mediated cell adhesion to extracellular matrices provides signals essential for cell cycle progression and differentiation (45Bouzeghrane F. Mercure C. Reudelhuber T.L. Thibault G. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2004; 36: 343-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Differences in fibronectin conformations were shown to alter the quantity of bound subunits of integrin and regulate differentiation. Treatment of myoblasts with specific inhibitors of proteoglycan synthesis (sodium chlorate and β-d-xyloside) substantially affected the deposition and assembly of the extracellular matrix (ECM) constituents (glypican, fibronectin, and laminin) and meddled their differentiation without affecting the expression of muscle differentiation regulators (MyoD, MEF2A, and myogenin). Treatment of differentiated myoblast with RGDS peptides completely inhibited myogenesis without affecting myogenin expression. Interestingly, antibodies specific for the RGD binding site in fibronectin abolished myoblast differentiation (46Osses N. Brandan E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C383-C394Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 47Morla A.O. Mogford J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Based on these data, it was concluded that the expression of myogenin is not sufficient to successfully drive muscle formation and that ECM is required to complete the skeletal muscle differentiation process. FGFs were identified as powerful stimulators of myoblast proliferation and inhibitors of myoblast differentiation in vitro. In chick embryos, most if not all, replicating myoblasts, but not the differentiated muscle cells, expressed high levels of the FGF receptor FREK/FGFR4. It preceded MyoD expression that signals the onset of terminal differentiation suggesting an important role of the FGF receptor in muscle differentiation and one of the earliest molecular markers (49Marcelle C. Wolf J. Bronner-Fraser M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 100-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It was shown that an inhibition of FGFR4, but not FGFR1 signaling affects Myf5, MyoD, and myosin heavy chain expression and dramatic loss of limb muscles. Conversely, overexpression of FGF8 in somites promoted FGFR4 expression and muscle differentiation. FGFR4 signaling was denoted as a crucial step in the cascade of molecular events leading to terminal muscle differentiation (50Marics I. Padilla F. Guillemot J.F. Scaal M. Marcelle C. Development. 2002; 129: 4559-4569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In light of this information, our screening assay for functional genes is proved to be highly efficient, easy and informative. Tumor Suppressors and Cell Cycle Regulator Genes—Three of the twenty-four target genes were the tumor suppressors and cell cycle regulators (p27, p19ARF, and p21WAF1). During muscle differentiation, muscle-specific gene induction and transition of cells from the proliferative stage to form post-mitotic multinucleated myotubes are regulated through highly ordered and temporally separable events. Cell cycle arrest is critical for muscle differentiation and involves the inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (51Andres V. Walsh K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 52Adams G.R. Haddad F. Baldwin K.M. J. Appl.

Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C658-C666Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The level of p27 protein gradually increases with differentiation (54Franklin D.S. Xiong Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1587-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). p19ARF is an upstream regulator of p53 and p21WAF1 (inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase). By inhibiting the cyclin-dependent kinase, p21WAF1 regulates the activity of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb); hypophosphorylated pRb binds to E2F and causes G0 cell cycle arrest. p21 expression is also activated by a muscle-specific transcriptional regulator, MyoD, independent to that of p53 and causes cell cycle withdrawal (55Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1018-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). p21-/- mice display increased cell number and enhanced cell cycle progression of myogenic progenitor cells and impaired muscle differentiation and regeneration (56Hawke T.J.

Imbalzano A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41486-41491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD, decreased muscle cell proliferation phenotype), caused by the absence of dystrophin, involves an increased expression of p21WAF1. Interestingly, an appropriate transient transfection of p21-antisense oligos improved their proliferation (58Endesfelder S. Bucher S. Kliche A. Reszka R. Speer A. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In light of these data, isolation of cell cycle regulators as functionally involved in muscle differentiation was justified. We further tested the functional role of p19ARF and p21WAF1 by their specific knockdown using Rz and siRNA. Target sites for p19ARF and p21WAF1 are shown in Table II. Efficacy of the ribozymes to knockdown their targets (p19ARF and p21WAF1) was examined by exogenous expression of epitope-tagged proteins and Western blotting with tag-specific antibodies. We found that all the five p19ARF Rz constructs and the two p21WAF1 Rz constructs could bring down the expression of their respective targets by 30-50% (data not shown). We next traced the formation of C2C12 myotubes in control and p19ARF-Rz transfected myoblasts and found that 2 of 5 ribozymes (19-2 and 19-4) resulted in delayed tube formation (Fig. 3A). This was also accompanied by a decrease in myogenin; an established marker for myotube formation. The p19ARF Rz derivatives also showed a lower level of p21WAF1 and myogenin compared with the vector-transfected control cells. Of note, the effect of different p19ARF Rzs on p21WAF1 and myogenin was well correlated with their effect on differentiation potential; the Rzs that effectively reduced p21WAF1 and myogenin-constrained myoblast differentiation. We next targeted p21WAF1 with ribozymes. Interestingly, one of the two p21WAF1 ribozymes that caused sharp decrease in myogenin resulted in significant delay in myotube formation (Fig. 3B). Whereas control cells formed full myotubes in 60 h, the 21-4 Rz-transfected cells showed a high population of un-aligned myoblasts. A more efficient knockdown of p19ARF and p21WAF1 was attempted with siRNAs (target sites are shown in Table II). One of the p19ARF siRNA (19-440) and both of the p21WAF1 siRNA (21-59 and 21-625) (Fig. 3C) resulted in decreased expression of the respective target genes and myogenin. This was accompanied by significantly delayed myotube formation (Fig. 3D). These data confirmed the functional involvement of p19ARF and p21WAF1 in myoblast differentiation. A Novel Function of Sex-determining Family Protein-fem—Caenorhabditis elegans Fem genes (fem1, fem2, and fem3) are centrally involved in male sexual development including initiation of spermatogenesis in XX (hermaphrodite) worms, and the entire spectrum of male differentiation in XO animals (59Doniach T. Hodgkin J. Dev. Biol. 1984; 106: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 60Kimble J. Edgar L. Hirsh D. Dev. Biol. 1984; 105: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Fem proteins are conserved in mice and human, suggesting their function in similar pathways. These contain 6-7 contiguous copies of a motif (ANK repeats) found in cell cycle-regulating proteins (the cdc10 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the SWI6 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Notch gene of Drosophila, and the lin-12 and glp-1 genes of C. elegans) (61Spence A.M. Coulson A. Hodgkin J. Cell. 1990; 60: 981-990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The Fem2 sequence is related to protein serine/threonine phosphatases of Type 2C (PP2C) and exhibits magnesium-dependent casein phosphatase activity that is critical for its function in male development in worms (62Chin-Sang I.D. Spence A.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2314-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Murine homologues fem1a and fem1b are expressed during embryogenesis; the fem1a expression is enriched in adult heart and skeletal muscle, and fem1b is highly expressed in adult testis suggesting their unique tissue-specific functions (63Ventura-Holman T. Maher J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 64Ventura-Holman T. Lu D. Si X. Izevbigie E.B. Maher J.F. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 314: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fem proteins are negatively regulated by Tra-2, which prevents male development; a balance between the opposing activities of Tra-2A and Fem-3 determines sex-specific cell fates in somatic tissues. Overexpression of fem-3 could overcome the feminizing effect of Tra-2 and cause widespread masculinization of XX somatic tissues (65Mehra A. Gaudet J. Heck L. Kuwabara P.E. Spence A.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In our screen, seven ribozymes that hit three independent sites of murine Fem homolog (fem1c) were isolated. We decided to analyze the functional involvement of the Fem protein in muscle differentiation by its specific knockdown with siRNA. Target sites are shown in Table II. Cells were transfected with siRNAs and selected in puromycin after which equal numbers of vector and fem siRNA-transfected cells were plated. We found that Fem-siRNAs improved the proliferation potential of myoblasts (Fig. 4A, compare panels b and c with a). We next transfected cells with expression plasmid for fem1 and found that these cells showed early tube formation compared with the control cells (Fig. 4B, compare panels c and d with a and b). Transfection of fem1 siRNAs (Fem-1000 and Fem-2203) caused remarkable delay in tube formation as visualized by phase contrast microscopy (Fig. 4B, compare panels e and f with a and b) and immunostaining with anti-myosin heavy chain antibody (Fig. 4C). This was accompanied by decrease in myogenin level (Fig. 4D). In the absence of antibodies specific to Fem1, specificity of Fem-siRNAs to its target was ensured by exogenous expression of V5-tagged fem, and its analysis by anti-V5 antibodies. We found that these siRNAs were highly specific to Fem1 and caused up to 55% reduction in the protein level (Fig. 4E). Taken together, we have exposed a novel function of the Fem1 protein by employing a ribozyme-based functional gene discovery system. Novel Gene Functions for Muscle Differentiation—Our screen has identified six novel genes (GenBank™ accession numbers: 1700025D19, 2410015A15, 4933405K18, 6820443O06, A630095P14, and A930024E05 (Table I) putatively involved in muscle differentiation. Further studies on specific knockdown of these genes are warranted. These studies will not only enhance our understanding of the functional biology of muscle differentiation but may also provide information for therapy of muscle diseases. Taken together, we have demonstrated (i) an effective use of a randomized ribozyme library for identifying genes for muscle differentiation, (ii) the validity of this approach by specific knockdown of some mRNAs, and (iii) the functional involvement of tumor suppressors (p19ARF and p21WAF1) and a sex-determining protein Fem1 in muscle differentiation. We thank M. Miyagishi for help in siRNA vector construction."

We addressed the difference in exposure of GCAP-2 structure to protein kinase and a protease as indicators of conformational change caused by binding and release of Ca2+. We have found that unlike its homolog, GCAP-1, the C terminus of GCAP-2 undergoes phosphorylation by cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases (CNDPK) present in the retinal extract and rapid dephosphorylation by the protein phosphatase PP2C present in the retina. Inactivation of the CNDPK phosphorylation site in GCAP-2 by substitutions S201G or S201D, as well as phosphorylation or thiophosphorylation of Ser201, had little effect on the ability of GCAP-2 to regulate retGC in reconstituted membranes in vitro.

Photoisomerized rhodopsin triggers hydrolysis of cGMP through the activation of the G-protein transducin, which stimulates cGMP phosphodiesterase and thus causes cGMP-gated channels to close (see Refs. 1Pugh Jr., E.N.

Rods and cones rapidly recover to their resting potential after excitation induced by a brief non-saturating exposure to light. They also adapt to a constant background illumination by decreasing the amplitude and accelerating the kinetics of their electrical responses to a standard test flash (see Refs. 1Pugh Jr., E.N.

Reopening of the cGMP-gated channels during recovery and light adaptation requires acceleration of cGMP synthesis by guanylyl cyclase, a process controlled by the level of intracellular free Ca2+. In the dark, Ca2+ extruded from the photoreceptor outer segment by a Na+/K+,Ca2+ exchanger re-enters the outer segment through the open cGMP-gated channels so that the free intracellular outer segment Ca2+ concentrations reach 250 nm in mammals and 350–450 nm in lower vertebrates (4Woodruff M.L.

In the light, cGMP is hydrolyzed, and these channels close while the exchanger continues to extrude Ca2+ ions from the photoreceptor outer segment; therefore, Ca2+ concentrations decrease nearly 10-fold (4Woodruff M.L.

GCAPs are a separate subfamily within the broader family of neuronal calcium sensor proteins that includes many recoverin-like proteins. The recoverin-like neuronal calcium sensor proteins have four EF-hand-type Ca2+-binding domains and an N-terminal Gly residue acylated with fatty acid residues. Only three of the EF-hand structures in GCAPs are true Ca2+-binding domains in which Ca2+ sensitivity is adjusted to the range within which the intracellular free Ca2+ varies between light and dark by intracellular free Mg2+ (12Peshenko I.V.

The NMR structure was established only for the Ca2+-loaded form of GCAP-2 and does not include the C-terminal portion of the protein; therefore, the exact conformational changes that occur when dissociation of the Ca2+ ions causes GCAP-2 to transition into the activator conformation are not immediately apparent. In our present study, we used the accessibility for the CNDPK phosphorylation of a Ser201 residue proximal to the C terminus of GCAP-2 and limited proteolysis by protease V8 to assess the conformational changes in GCAP-2 related to the binding and release of Ca2+. Our data indicate that the C terminus of GCAP-2 undergoes a conformational Ca2+-dependent switch that releases the C terminus from a constraint created by the Ca2+-loaded structure of GCAP-2 and changes the exposure of the regions between EF-hands 2 and 3 and between EF-3 and -4.

Photoreceptor outer segment membranes were isolated under infrared illumination from frozen dark-adapted bovine retinas (Lawson and Lawson) using sucrose density gradient centrifugation and were washed in low salt buffer to remove endogenous GCAPs as described previously (12Peshenko I.V.

Soluble Retinal Extract (S100)—Fresh bovine eyes obtained at a local slaughterhouse were dark-adapted for 2 h on ice, dissected under infrared light, and homogenized in 0.5 ml of buffer A (5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl) per retina on ice by 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected and centrifuged in 200-μl aliquots in a Beckman A100 rotor for 30 min at 80,000 rpm. The supernatant fraction, S100, was collected and used immediately or divided into aliquots, frozen in dry ice, and stored at -70 °C. Typical total protein concentration in the S100 fraction was near 40 mg/ml Phosphorylation Assay—Unless indicated otherwise, a typical phosphorylation reaction contained 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 6 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 μm ATP or 10 μm ATPγS (Sigma), ∼10 μCi of [32P]- or [35S]ATPγS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 300 μm 8-Br-cGMP (Sigma). After incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 2 volumes of a Laemmli sample SDS buffer containing 4 mm EGTA and was boiled for 5 min. Phosphorylated proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE in 15% polyacrylamide gel, fixed in 7.5% acetic acid, 10% methanol solution, stained with Coomassie Blue, destained in 7.5% acetic acid, 10% methanol, and covered with thin polyethylene film exposed on Kodak Bio Max or X-Omat AR at room temperature. Adding EGTA in the sample buffer was required to prevent the appearance of multiple bands of GCAPs because of Ca2+ binding during PAGE. The thiophosphorylation reaction contained 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm 8-Br-cGMP, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20,000 units of PKG Iα, 5.0 mm ATPγS, and 60 μm GCAP-2. The reaction was incubated at 23 °C for 2 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, the reaction mixture was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. Protein Phosphatase Assay—Wild-type GCAP-2 was 32P-labeled in the presence of PKG Iα as described above, except instead of quenching the reaction by adding SDS sample buffer, the unincorporated label was removed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50. The phosphatase reaction typically contained 1 μg of [32P]GCAP-2 (∼1 μCi/μg), 10 μl of S100 protein fraction in 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris 7.5, and 6 mm dithiothreitol in a total volume of 20 μl. Fenvalerate, okadaic acid, and microcystine were added from 100× concentrated stock solution in Me2SO, and the corresponding volume of Me2SO was added in control samples even though Me2SO had no noticeable effect on the phosphatase activity because of low concentrations. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min. the reaction was stopped by adding 2 volumes of a Laemmli sample SDS-buffer containing 4 mm EGTA and was boiled for 3 min followed by SDS-PAGE and radioautography as described above. Immunoblot—Proteins were transferred from SDS-polyacrylamide gel onto Immobillon P membrane (Millipore) for 20 h at 60 V, stained for GCAP-2 using polyclonal rabbit antibody ΔNP24 (20Dizhoor A.M. Olshevskaya E.V. Henzel W.J. Wong S.C. Stults J.T. Ankoudinova I. Hurley J.B. J. Biol.

Glu-C Proteolysis—The reaction contained 20 μl of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, either 500 μm CaCl2 or 100 μm EDTA, 46 μg of purified GCAP-2, and 0.18 μg of Staphylococcus aureus protease V8 (Sigma). The components were mixed at room temperature and incubated for 7 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by heating to 100 °C for 5 min. 10-μl aliquots from each reaction were then loaded on a capillary C4 column. Peptides eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid were directly infused into a Sciex API III electrospray mass spectrometer and scanned for positive ions with m/z values between 600 and 1200. Mass spectrometry data were processed using Sciex MacProMass and MacSpec software. RetGC Assay—All experiments were conducted under infrared light as described (12Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16903-16906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The assay mixture (25 μl) contained 30 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm Ca2+/EGTA buffer, 1 mm free Mg2+, zaprinast and dipyridamole (25 μm each), leupeptin and aprotinin (10 μg/ml each), 0.3 mm ATP, 4 mm cGMP, 1 mm GTP, ∼1 μCi of [α-32P]GTP, 0.1 μCi of [8-3H]cGMP, 1 μl of washed bovine outer segment membranes (3.7 mg/ml rhodopsin), and purified recombinant GCAP-2 or its mutants as indicated in the figure legends. The products of the reaction were analyzed by TLC using fluorescent plastic polyethyleneimine cellulose as described (17Hurley J.B. Dizhoor A.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 708-718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+/EGTA buffers were prepared as described (21Tsien R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and the final free Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations in the reaction mixture were calculated using the algorithm of Marks and Maxfield (22Marks P.W. Maxfield F.R. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 193: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Ca2+/EGTA buffers were calibrated using Ca2+ fluorescence dyes Fluo-3 and X-rhod FF (Kd of 325 nm and 17 μm, respectively) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). According to the NMR spectroscopy study by Ames et al. (15Ames J.B. Dizhoor A.M. Ikura M. Palczewski K. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19329-19337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), the overall folding of Ca2+-loaded GCAP-2 resembles recoverin, a Ca2+-binding protein that affects rhodopsin kinase activity (23Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. McKay D.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 709-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and neurocalcin (24Vijay-Kumar S. Kumar V.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). All attempts to solve the three-dimensional structure of the Ca2+-free activator form of GCAP-2 were unsuccessful, so there is no direct structural information available on how Ca2+ release or binding can trigger conformational changes in the GCAP-2 molecule. Moreover, the C-terminal portion of GCAP-2 was not resolved in the NMR structure of Ca2+-loaded GCAP-2. Reversible dimerization of Ca2+-free GCAP-2 (25Olshevskaya E.V. Ermilov A.N. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25583-25587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) poses an additional challenge for the study because binding and release of Ca2+ not only affects the conformation of GCAP-2, but also alters GCAP-2/GCAP-2 interaction. To assess the possible structural change between Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-free GCAP-2, we studied the effects of Ca2+ on site-specific phosphorylation and limited proteolysis of GCAP-2. The RRKSAMF sequence at the C terminus of the GCAP-2 molecule (20Dizhoor A.M. Olshevskaya E.V. Henzel W.J. Wong S.C. Stults J.T. Ankoudinova I. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25200-25206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) is a typical consensus recognition site for both cGMP- and cAMP-dependent kinases, so three different purified CNDPKs can phosphorylate the C-terminal Ser in GCAP-2 in vitro (Fig. 1, A–D). Purified PKG I phosphorylates GCAP-2 with low efficiency in the absence of added cyclic nucleotide, and the addition of cGMP enhances the phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, lanes b and c). GCAP-1 lacks such a sequence (26Palczewski K. Subbaraya I. Gorczyca W.A. Helekar B.S. Ruiz C.C. Ohguro H. Huang J. Zhao X. Crabb J.W. Johnson R.S. Walsh K.A. Gray-Keller M.P. Detwiler P.B. Baehr W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), and we did not observe phosphorylation of GCAP-1 by CNDPK under the same conditions (Fig. 1, A and B, lane e). Unlike wild-type GCAP-2, a chimera mutant, in which the C-terminal region downstream of EF-4 was substituted with the corresponding fragment from the related recoverin-like protein neurocalcin (19Olshevskaya E.V. Boikov S. Ermilov A.N. Krylov D. Hurley J.B. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10823-10832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), did not undergo phosphorylation under these conditions (not shown). Deletion (mutant CΔ1) of the last nine amino acid residues, including Ser201, from GCAP-2 (19Olshevskaya E.V. Boikov S. Ermilov A.N. Krylov D. Hurley J.B. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10823-10832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) also completely abolished phosphorylation (Fig. 1, A and B, lane d). Apparently, the C terminus in GCAP-2 was the only part in GCAP-2 that was phosphorylated. To ensure that the CNDPK site Ser201 was the only site of phosphorylation in GCAP-2, we substituted Ser201 with either Gly or Asp and found that both mutations completely abolished 32P incorporation in GCAP-2 (Fig. 1C). In the presence of N-myristoyltransferase, GCAP-2 is expressed in E. coli predominantly as a fatty acylated protein (16Olshevskaya E.V. Hughes R.E. Hurley J.B. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14327-14333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); however, a variable small fraction of GCAP-2 that remains non-acylated is often present in such preparations and appears in SDS-PAGE as a minor band just above the acylated GCAP-2 (16Olshevskaya E.V. Hughes R.E. Hurley J.B. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14327-14333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). When both myristoylated and non-myristoylated forms are present in preparation of GCAP-2, they incorporate the 32P label catalyzed by purified PKA and PKG (Fig. 1D). Hence, myristoylation is not required for GCAP-2 to become a substrate for CNDPK. PKA, PKG II, and, at a lower level, PKG I have been reported in photoreceptors (27Lee R.H. Brown B.M. Lolley R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15860-15866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gamm D.M. Barthel L.K. Raymond P.A. Uhler M.D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 2766-2773PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with that report, we have found that the retinal extract contains soluble GCAP-2 kinase activity stimulated by cGMP or its slow hydrolyzable analog, 8-Br-cGMP (Fig. 1, D and F). To minimize potential interference from phosphorylation of the endogenous GCAP-2, we extracted soluble retinal proteins (S100 fraction) at normal ionic strength when GCAP-2 remained mostly associated with the membrane fraction (16Olshevskaya E.V. Hughes R.E. Hurley J.B. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14327-14333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although the S100 fraction contains an ∼33-kDa endogenous protein (presumably phosducin) that is highly phosphorylated by the CNDPK (27Lee R.H. Brown B.M. Lolley R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15860-15866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Pagh-Roehl K. Lin D. Su L. Burnside B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6475-6488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this band migrates substantially higher than GCAP-2 and therefore does not interfere with the analysis. Using 8-Br-cGMP produces more stable and reproducible results because the S100 fraction, even isolated from the dark-adapted retina, contains substantial traces of cGMP phosphodiesterase activity (not shown). In the presence of cyclic nucleotide, purified recombinant GCAP-2 becomes phosphorylated by the S100 fraction. The Ser201 in GCAP-2 was the only site for the protein kinase activity present in the S100 fraction, and it was phosphorylated only by CNDPK. Removing the CNDPK site from GCAP-2 either by deletion or a by the point mutation S201D (Fig. 1, C and E) completely suppresses phosphorylation of GCAP-2 by the retinal extract, as does the removal of CNDPK activator (Fig. 1F). Although in other proteins phosphorylation can alter their electrophoretic mobility, phosphorylation of Ser201 in GCAP-2 (either of bovine or mouse origin) does not affect its electrophoretic mobility in denaturing SDS gel (Fig. 1, G and H). Dephosphorylation of GCAP-2—GCAP-2 can be phosphorylated by CNDPK present in the S100 fraction, but the efficiency of phosphorylation in that case is drastically lower (>10-fold lower, data not shown) compared with purified CNDPK because the S100 fraction also contains a protein phosphatase (Fig. 2). Purified 32P-labeled GCAP-2, phosphorylated by PKG Iα and added to the retinal S100 fraction, becomes rapidly dephosphorylated (Fig. 2, A and D). The loss of radioactivity was due to phosphatase activity, not protein degradation, because leupeptin and aprotinin did not prevent the loss of the 32P label from prephosphorylated GCAP-2 (not shown), and the integrity of GCAP-2 was not compromised after incubation with S100 (Fig. 2B). Inhibitors of protein phosphatases PP1, PP2A, and PP2B (such as Fenvalerate, microcystine, and okadaic acid) do not affect dephosphorylation of [32P]GCAP-2, even at concentrations high enough to completely inhibit these protein phosphatases (Fig. 2). Similarly, neither bromotetramisole (an alkaline phosphatase inhibitor) nor the removal of Ca2+ by EGTA inhibits dephosphorylation. Inhibition of the [32P]GCAP-2 dephosphorylation occurred only when Mg2+ was removed from the reaction mixture by EDTA. EDTA is the only inhibitor of the fourth type of protein phosphatase, the Mg2+-dependent phosphatase PP2C, which is also present in the retina (30Klumpp S. Selke D. Fischer D. Baumann A. Muller F. Thanos S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 51: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, A, C, and D). Phospho-GCAP-2 appears to be the first PP2C-specific substrate identified in photoreceptors. The only covalent modification in GCAP-2 isolated from bovine retinas was fatty acylation (16Olshevskaya E.V. Hughes R.E. Hurley J.B. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14327-14333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and the presence of potent phosphatase PP2C in retinal extract (30Klumpp S. Selke D. Fischer D. Baumann A. Muller F. Thanos S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 51: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) may account for the lack of phosphorylated GCAP-2 after its isolation from the retina. Therefore, it remains unclear to what extent GCAP-2 can be phosphorylated in vivo. ATP is known to potentiate the stimulation of retGC by GCAP-2 in vitro (31Gorczyca W.A. Van Hooser J.P. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3217-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 32Laura R.P. Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol.

The light-activated photoreceptor-specific phosphodiesterase PDE6 can hydrolyze both cGMP and cAMP, and Ca2+-dependent regulation of adenylyl cyclase can regulate cAMP levels in rods (29Pagh-Roehl K. Lin D. Su L. Burnside B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6475-6488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Willardson B.M. Wilkins J.F. Yoshida T. Bitensky M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1980; 255: 11619-11624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, either PKA or PKG could potentially affect retGC activity or Ca2+ sensitivity via phosphorylation of GCAP-2. However, neither inactivation of the phosphorylation site in GCAP-2 (Fig. 3) nor inclusion of CNDPK and its activators directly into the retGC assay reaction (not shown) had an effect on retGC regulation. Only a small change (<15%) in maximal activity of retGC was observed when Ser201 was substituted with either Gly or negatively charged Asp residues. Yet the potentiating effect of ATP on retGC activity remained present in both GCAP-2 mutants (Fig. 3). To completely exclude the possibility that PP2C, which is present in outer segment membranes, interferes with the analysis, we used modification by a thiophosphate group that can be transferred to proteins by protein kinases but cannot be removed by protein phosphatases. Prior to use in retGC assay, GCAP-2 was incubated with PKG Iα and ATPγS, after which 92% of GCAP-2 became unavailable for subsequent phosphorylation using [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 4A). Neither the affinity for guanylyl cyclase nor the Ca2+ sensitivity of the cyclase regulation by GCAP-2 changed after the Ser201 thiophosphorylation of GCAP-2 (Fig. 4, A and B). Apparently, the effect of ATP on retGC activation is because of either ATP binding by retGC (33Tucker C.L. Laura R.P. Hurley J.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11995-12000Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or phosphorylation of retGC itself (37Aparicio J.G. Applebury M.L. J. Biol.

The replication studies reported here and in Ref. 1Maas R. Cell. 2001; 105: 945-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar deal with the miniplasmid RepFIC, isolated from Escherichia coli pathogen 307 (2Saadi S. Maas W.K. Hill D.F. Bergquist P.L. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1836-1846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RepFIC origin is prototypic of pathogenic plasmids of E. coli, Salmonella, and Shigella. The four peptides expressed by mini-RepFIC are essential and sufficient for the in vivo once/cell cycle activation associated with replication (3Maas R. Wang C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2163-2168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Maas R. Wang C. Maas W.K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3823-3827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The minimal replicon used in these studies is 3000 base pairs in size and fully regulated, with each plasmid unit essentially replicating once during the cell cycle. In a previously reported optimal recovery of transformants approximately every plasmid molecule transferred by electroporation initiates replication (1Maas R. Cell. 2001; 105: 945-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Such conditions “imprint” the altered L-DNA conformation of plasmid maintenance, characterized by lowered linking number or helical density (1Maas R. Cell. 2001; 105: 945-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The imprinting of L-DNA maintenance led to its isolation in pure form and facilitated its characterization. Thus, it could be established by electron microscopy that L-DNA is intact and supercoiled and has significantly lowered solubility in aqueous solutions as well as altered electrophoretic mobility (1Maas R. Cell. 2001; 105: 945-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). L-DNA has sometimes been overlooked because it partitions into phenol chloroform. The altered conformation is imprinted under specific circumstances at the time of transformation for other E. coli plasmids such as pBR, mini-F, and cloned OriC. Exclusive maintenance of DNA in the L-conformation results in filamentous growth, suggesting inhibition of cell division when L-DNA does not revert to B. Thus, the topological transition of L-DNA to B-DNA is of importance for optimal growth and suggests that the transition was selected in the course of evolution. As expected of a plasmid activated for replication, RepFIC plasmid in the L-conformation efficiently transforms E. coli hosts. When associated proteins including the DNA-methyltransferases have been stringently removed from transferred L-DNA, transformation efficiency decreases by 5 orders of magnitude (1Maas R. Cell. 2001; 105: 945-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Efficiency is restored by activation of the methyltransfer metR regulon after DNA entry, emphasizing the importance of de novo methylation to replication (1Maas R. Cell. 2001; 105: 945-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The interpretation derived from the previous work is that initiation of replication is associated with a significant increase in the level of methylation. Whether de novo methylation is retained or not in the parental strands after DNA duplication was not addressed in Ref. 1Maas R. Cell. 2001; 105: 945-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar and has been partially analyzed in this work. Prevention of rapid remethylation (5Boye E. Lobner-Olesen A.

Cell. 2001; 105: 945-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). L-DNA is methylated in both strands by dam-methyltransferase at frequent intervals both in vivo and in vitro at sequences different from GATC (1Maas R. Cell. 2001; 105: 945-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The methylated tetramers are here identified and shown to be methylated at adenine in one strand and guanine in the other. The obligatory assortment of parental strands then results in tetramers that are alternatively methylated at adenine or guanine in each transmitted parental strand (7Meselson M. Stahl F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1958; 44: 671-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of purine methylation is consistent with one of the two bases being demethylated, in all probability methylguanine. The phenotype of conditional ExoIII mutants of E. coli led to the educated guess that ExoIII conforms L-DNA to B in the cell. ExoIII in fact catalyzed in vitro the L to B transition in the absence but not in the presence of purine methylation. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—The following E. coli strains were used as hosts: C600 (thi-1 thr-1 leuB6 lacY1 tonA21 supE44 mcrA), JT4000 (Δlon-510), GM3819 (dam-16::KanR), GM31 F- (dcm-6), and GM2198 (dam-13::Tn9 dcm-6). The miniplasmid used, pRM3930, consists of the RepFIC basic replicon and the streptomycin-spectinomycin resistance cassette Ω. Growth of Bacteria Cultures—Cultures bacteria were grown in tryptone-yeast extract medium (Difco), with added 0.1% glucose, and 50 μg of spectinomycin/ml. Other supplements are described in the figure legends. Preparation of Plasmid DNA and Restriction Analysis—DNA was prepared with Qiagen plasmid mini Kits as recommended by the manufacturer. Associated proteins were then removed by “salt stripping” as previously described (1Maas R. Cell. 2001; 105: 945-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The enzymes were purchased from Roche Applied Science (EcoRII) and New England Biolabs. The reaction volumes were 10 μl/lane, containing four to five units of enzyme. DNA analysis was by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. ExoIII Reactions—ExoIII was purchased from New England Biolabs. ExoIII does not degrade circular intact DNA (8Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York, NY1992Google Scholar), making the basis for enzyme units described in the New England Biolabs catalog irrelevant to this work. ExoIII exhibited topoisomerase activity toward L-DNA and presumably bound to cognate loci, calculated to be at least 39 in number/replicon sequence. Fifty New England Biolabs units/lane were used and found to be sufficient. The enzyme was “inactivated” as recommended by the manufacturer at 70 °C for 20 min. The reaction volumes were 10 μl/lane. Newly Characterized Methylation of A, G, and C in Replicon DNA—The replication switch-off associated with methylation of one strand and seen in the transformation of dam- hosts with methylated plasmids (6Russell D.W. Zinder N.D. Cell. 1987; 50: 1071-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) is observed with RepFIC only when dam-dcm- hosts are transformed. This suggests that dam-methyltransferase (dam-Mtase) 1The abbreviations used are: Mtase, methyltransferase; ds, double-stranded; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate. and dcm-methyltransferase (dcm-Mtase) of E. coli, contrary to current dogma, methylate a common sequence. The cutting activity of restriction enzymes is recognized in vitro by the electrophoretic separation of resulting double-stranded (ds) fragments. ds fragments are obtained when the cognate restriction sequence has an axis of symmetry (8Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York, NY1992Google Scholar). The pneumococcal enzyme DpnI makes blunt cuts at 5′-meA↓T in GATC. dam-Mtase methylates the As in both strands. When DpnI was used to restrict RepFIC L-DNA, a 2.5-kb fragment with no GATC sequences was shredded to fragments <100 base pairs in length (1Maas R. Cell. 2001; 105: 945-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), suggesting that DpnI cuts DNA at additional loci different from 5′-meA↓T. The most numerous alternating Pyr-Pyr-Pur-Pur loci by a factor of ∼10 in RepFIC are 5′-CCAG and its complementary sequence 5′-CTGG. Some of these loci were first identified serendipitously by piperidine digestion (9Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar) in a control experiment that will be described briefly below. Methylation is at A in 5′-CCAG and the opposite internal G, respectively (see Fig. 2B). The DpnI cuts are inferred to be at C↓meA and T↓meG (Table I) with an axis of symmetry at the blunt cut.Table IThe dam- and dcm-methyltransferases of E. coliSequence methylatedDNA conformationMethylation typeRestriction enzymeMethylationRestriction cutsEssentialBlockedDamGATCCanonicalDpnIYesGA ↓ TCCT ↑ AGDamCCAG-3′LDe novoDpnIYesCC ↓ AG-3′GGTC-5′GG ↓ TC-5′EcoRIIYesC ↓ CAG-3′DcmCCAG-3′CanonicalEcoRIIYesC ↓ CAG-3′GGTC-5′DamCCAGG-3′LDe novoEcoRIIYesC ↓ CAGGCGTCC-5′GGTC ↑ CDcmCCAGG-3′CanonicalEcoRIIYesC ↓ CAGGGGTCC-5′GGTC ↑ C Open table in a new tab 5′-CCAG and its complement is part of the 5-mer sequence 5′-CCWGG (where W = A or T), restricted at CC of each strand by EcoRII in the absence of cytosine methylation (10Palmer B.R. Marinus M.G. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 143: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Because the pentamer sequence is methylated by dcm-Mtase (10Palmer B.R. Marinus M.G. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 143: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), investigation of purine methylation of the sequence demands the absence of cytosine methylation. 5′-CCWGG occurs eight times in RepFIC, four times in one orientation and four times in the other (see Fig. 2). MvaI cuts 5′-CCWGG regardless of methylation. In the gel of Fig. 1, plasmid isolated from a Dam+Dcm+ host was restricted by MvaI (lane 2) and not by EcoRII (lane 3). Thus, in the presence of both methyltransferases, methylation prevents EcoRII restriction of all loci. The calculated length between loci 6 and 7 (Figs. 1 and 2) is 1258 base pairs, providing a convenient diagnostic fragment for restriction at these two loci. The diagnostic fragment was indeed obtained by digestion with MvaI and is indicated in lane 2 of Fig. 1. Plasmid isolated from a Dcm+dam- strain is equally resistant to digestion by EcoRII (lane 7). Thus, cytosine methylation is sufficient for blocking EcoRII restriction. EcoRII treatment of completely unmethylated DNA produced an extensive smear, suggesting numerous previously unknown methylation loci as already proposed (1Maas R. Cell. 2001; 105: 945-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and an extended specificity for EcoRII restriction outside the 5′-CCWGG pentamer (lane 5). Similar smears are seen when plasmid DNA is treated with pancreatic DNase, an enzyme that makes single-stranded cuts in ds DNA. They are also seen when DNA methylated at purines is treated with piperidine. In this second case single-stranded cuts form the basis for Maxam-Gilbert sequencing (9Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar). The sequence 5′-CCWGG contains a 5′-CC doublet in each strand. The simplest explanation for the single-stranded cuts that are proposed is that EcoRII cuts both strands at C↓C in 5′-CCWGG with an axis of symmetry through W, whereas it cuts 5′-CCAG/CTGG once at 5′-C↓CAG. Shortening of the cognate EcoRII sequence from pentamer to tetramer increases the number of cognate loci 5-fold from 8 to 39, with 31 of them predicted to be cut by EcoRII in one strand only (Table I). Finally, cytosine methylation prevents cutting of all 5′-CCWGG and 5′-CCAG sequences (lane 7), whereas purine methylation does not (lane 9). The results of lane 9 demonstrate a dual pattern of dam-methylation that is explained by susceptibility of each plasmid molecule to EcoRII ds cuts at the four 5′-CCWGG loci in one orientation or alternatively at the four 5′-CCWGG loci in the other orientation (the analysis is illustrated in Fig. 2). When one parental strand is methylated at adenine and the other at guanine, semiconservative assortment of parental strands (7Meselson M. Stahl F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1958; 44: 671-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) dictates that one offspring inherits methylated adenine and the other inherits methylated guanine. One concludes from the alternative sensitivity of plasmid populations to EcoRII cuts that one-strand methylation of adenines or of guanines is systematically removed after duplication. The extreme sensitivity of L-DNA and not H-DNA to piperidine (1Maas R. Cell. 2001; 105: 945-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 9Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar, 11Johnston B.H. Rich A. Cell. 1985; 42: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) suggests that methylguanines and not methyladenines are demethylated or replaced in the tetramers after DNA duplication, including those within the pentamers. Methylguanine in L-DNA cannot be identified directly, because the marker deoxy-7-methylguanosine is not available. The analysis illustrated in Fig. 2 identifies ds cuts at all 5′-CCWGG loci except for those designated as 1 and 4 in the map of Fig. 1. A strategy that serendipitously identified the sequence 5′-CCAG and its complement 5′-CTGG for methylation was as follows. In the course of doing in vivo footprinting of the origin (4Maas R. Wang C. Maas W.K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3823-3827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 146-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), controls were carried out by piperidine hydrolysis of isolated plasmid to confirm that there was no methylation of purines in the origin region, because the origin has no canonical GATC sequences. The piperidine-treated DNA was used as template in thermally cycled primer extensions with Taq polymerase and a radioactive precursor (4Maas R. Wang C. Maas W.K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3823-3827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Separation of the extended primers by denaturing PAGE revealed that the assumption of no methylation was incorrect, for there were nick signals at the two tetramers. Such a strategy, using sequencing lanes for location of the nicks (4Maas R. Wang C. Maas W.K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3823-3827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and plasmid isolated from a dam- host as control should directly identify all As and Gs that become methylated irrespective of recognition by a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme. Although straightforward, the experiments are beyond the scope of this work. The fragments of lane 9 add up to a 6-kb length, whereas the miniplasmid is 5-kb in size. Amplification of the DNA was eliminated by the complete in-lab sequencing of five plasmid preparations originating from five isolated transformants of a Dam+dcm- host and one transformant of a Dam+Dcm+ host. Both lane 3 and lane 7 demonstrate that when methylation prevents restriction, EcoRII shifts the equilibrium between normal density DNA, named H in my previous publication (1Maas R. Cell. 2001; 105: 945-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and L-DNA toward L. The transition to L facilitates replication (1Maas R. Cell. 2001; 105: 945-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), suggesting that methylation and methylation restriction systems provide an advantage at the time of DNA transfer. Could the absence of optimal replication explain the apparent protection from infecting DNA in the phenomenon of restriction of phage infection? ExoIII as an Enzyme That Alters DNA Helical Density—The topological transition of L-DNA to H is known to occur at the end of each cycle of replication. A reaction analogous to the transition has been demonstrated in vitro by treatment of H-DNA with one of the type I topoisomerases and subsequent treatment of the low linking number reaction product with a type II topoisomerase. Having obtained evidence for the loss of guanine methylation from DNA raises the possibility that in vivo specific demethylation of L-DNA is essential for the transition. Hosts containing L-RepFIC have absolute sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, possibly as a result of the presence of methylguanine in L-DNA, and do not grow in rich media containing as little as 1 mm hydrogen peroxide. One expects that cells unable to shift the helical density of their DNA from L to H as a result of the presence of methylguanine in their DNA have the same phenotype. ExoIII mutants are exquisitely sensitive to hydrogen peroxide (13Imlay J.A. Linn S. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). A 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity of ExoIII on ds DNA oligonucleotides has given the enzyme its name. ExoIII possesses multiple hydrolytic activities toward the sugar phosphate backbone, all determined with in vitro generated substrates and described in Ref. 8Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York, NY1992Google Scholar. ExoIII removes from the 3′-end of duplex polymers up to three mispaired nucleotides. In nicked substrates the nick can be enlarged to a gap. In addition ExoIII makes incisions at apurinic and apyrimidinic sites in vitro (14Little J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 679-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These activities do not apply to covalently closed circular genetic elements, and they do not explain the sensitivity of ExoIII mutants to hydrogen peroxide. It has been published, however, that ExoIII may generate a particular DNA conformation required to induce heat shock response, defining an ExoIII topological activity in vivo (15Paek K.H. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 763-770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The action of commercially available ExoIII was explored in this work with in vivo isolated plasmid preparations containing mixtures of H- and L-DNA and one preparation containing L-DNA only. Three preparations originated from a Dam+ host and three from a dam- host. The results are shown in Fig. 3. Comparison of each untreated sample (odd-numbered lanes) with the adjacent ExoIII-treated sample shows that ExoIII lowers the electrophoretic mobility of L-DNA and L-DNA only to the lowest in the gel (labeled LL). Dam-methylation does not affect the reaction. The above results were obtained in 0.66 mm magnesium (Mg2+) buffer. To test whether more Mg2+ was required for an additional reaction, the following experiment, shown in Fig. 4, was done. LL-DNA was prepared by ExoIII treatment of L- and H-DNA mixtures, because the relative insolubility of L-DNA (1Maas R. Cell. 2001; 105: 945-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) hampers its purification by extraction from gels. The pure material seen in Fig. 3 (lane 3) can only be obtained from cells where the L-conformation has been imprinted, i.e. only from Dam+ cells. The reaction tubes were maintained at 70 °C for 20 min (Fig. 4, step I). Mg2+ (lanes 3 and 7) or Mg2+ + ExoIII (lanes 4 and 8, indicated by arrows) was added in a second step. The addition of Mg2+ regardless of the addition of fresh ExoIII resulted in a clear transition of LL-DNA, but only when the DNA was isolated from a dam- host (lanes 7 and 8). ExoIII does not degrade intact circular DNA (8Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York, NY1992Google Scholar). L-DNA is circular and supercoiled (1Maas R. Cell. 2001; 105: 945-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The clarity of the lanes in the position where linear molecules are expected and below the H band, as well as the lack of increase in ethidium-bromide staining material at the bottom of the gel (not shown), confirm that there was no degradation by ExoIII. The transition of LL-DNA in lanes 7 and 8 was most likely to H-DNA, an interpretation that was easier to see with the naked (and protected) eye directly on the UV transilluminator. The purpose of the treatment at 70 °C was inactivation of ExoIII. The L to H transition proceeded in the absence of further addition of ExoIII, suggesting either that the transition was spontaneous or that ExoIII is not inactivated once bound to DNA. The latter seems more likely. When all possible purines were methylated as they normally are in L-DNA, the addition of Mg2+ resulted in diffuse bands of low helical density (lanes 3 and 4). The diffuse bands of LL-DNA could indicate Mg2+ promoted nicking as is seen with topoisomerases and poor staining caused by inefficient intercalation of ethidium bromide in the nicked structure. Postreplicative specific loss of guanine methylation and the in vitro topological activity of ExoIII can be integrated in a model that is considered in the following “Discussion.” This work has provided evidence for methylation in both strands of the tetramer sequence motif 5′-CCWG at guanine, adenine, and cytosine in E. coli. The sequence, which contains three G-C pairs, is present 39× in 3000 base pairs. Seventeen of the tetramers are located in the 48% G-C origin sequence. Full methylation optimizes initiation of the duplication process (1Maas R. Cell. 2001; 105: 945-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) by stabilizing the prereplicative L-DNA conformation. The activated state of replication cannot be removed until methylguanines are replaced or demethylated. L-DNA that is hemimethylated at de novo purines appears to act as a checkpoint for reversal of specific programmed methylation. As will be discussed, de novo methylated cytosines may be removed as well by an analogous pathway. ExoIII is here proposed to play a pivotal role in the reversal of DNA modifications that alter DNA function. ExoIII conditional mutants exhibit filamentous growth like E. coli where maintenance of the RepFIC plasmid has been imprinted as L, suggesting that sufficient ExoIII is essential for the L to H transition. This in turn suggests that LL-DNA is an activated intermediate for the alteration or removal of DNA units that interfere with the B-helix. Once interference is removed, the ExoIII reaction is completed. It would be interesting to determine whether combining the ExoIII mutation known as xth with a dam mutation relieves both the filamentous growth phenotype and sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide. Relief of filamentous growth would signify that in the absence of a requirement for demethylation of methylguanine, a type II topoisomerase could promote the L to H transition. Relief of sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide would suggest that the sensitivity is indeed due to the presence of methylguanine in DNA. Just as mammals methylate cytosine de novo during development (16Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4574) Google Scholar), E. coli methylate adenine and guanine de novo during replication, resulting in changing patterns of methylation during each replication cycle and leading to the conclusion that one common feature of de novo DNA methylation is the optimization of DNA replication. The properties of the two major methyltransferases in E. coli as well as those of cognate restriction enzymes used in sequence identification are summarized in Table I. Interestingly, the same motif that is methylated de novo by dam-Mtase is methylated by dcm-Mtase, the latter not found in all E. coli strains. In vivo dam-methylated L-DNA appears to be identical to DNA alkylated in vitro (1Maas R. Cell. 2001; 105: 945-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The major product of in vitro ds DNA alkylation is N7-methylguanine (9Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar, 11Johnston B.H. Rich A. Cell. 1985; 42: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The major methylated purine product by a large factor after exposure of E. coli to alkylating agents is also N7-methylguanine (17Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 110Google Scholar). The indications thus are that methylguanine in L-DNA is modified at N7. It is likely that methylguanines are demethylated rather than excised for the following reason. E. coli adapt rapidly when exposed to mutagenic methylating agents (18Samson L. Cairns J. Nature. 1977; 267: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Adaptation is via the inducible protein Ada, specific for removing methyl adducts from the O6 position of methylguanine (18Samson L. Cairns J. Nature. 1977; 267: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 19Sassanfar M. Dosanjh M.K. Essigmann J.M. Samson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2767-2771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The O6 position is vital to hydrogen bonding (20Watson J.D. Crick F.H.C. Nature. 1953; 171: 737-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (8554) Google Scholar), and not surprisingly a system evolved for removing the modification, certain to be mutagenic in view of improper O6-methyl pairing opposite the 4-amino group of cytosine. The question arises why does E. coli demethylate a minor product of methylation when N7-methylguanine is the major modification product and is in fact removed. One explanation, the simplest, is that O6-methylguanine is a functional intermediate marked for demethylation. The methyl group of O6-methylguanine is transferred to cysteine-S of the Ada protein itself (21Schendel P.F. Defais M. Jeggo P. Samson L. Cairns J. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 135: 466-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Methylated Ada protein is a transcriptional activator of the ada operon (22Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 5575-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The Ada enzyme is also known as O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (23Demple B. Jacobsson A. Olsson M. Robins P. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13776-13780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ada operon transcribes one additional protein that has been named AlkB (24Kataoka H. Yamamoto Y. Sekiguchi M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 1301-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kataoka H. Sekiguchi M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 198: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The in vitro activity of AlkB is unknown. In vivo absence of AlkB sensitizes the cell to killing by the methylating agent MMS (24Kataoka H. Yamamoto Y. Sekiguchi M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 1301-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Could AlkB take part in the methyl group transfer from N7 to O6 and thus be part of the guanine demethylation reaction? There is an additional protein in E. coli that has the potential to demethylate O6-methylguanine. It is not inducible. Ada and the noninducible DNA methyltransferase remove methyl groups from both O6-methylguanine and O4-thymine, neither one of which is a major product of in vivo alkylation reactions. Ada protein displays greater efficiency in the demethylation of O6-meG and the noninducible enzyme in the demethylation of O4-meT. The noninducible protein is conserved in yeast and man, where it has the same preferential activity toward O4-meT (19Sassanfar M. Dosanjh M.K. Essigmann J.M. Samson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2767-2771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The similarities of the two DNA methyltransferases and the conservation of O4-meT-DNA methyltransferase through the evolutionary ladder suggest a normal biological function for both DNA methyltransferases that is advantageous but does not necessarily reflect a response to mutagen exposure. 7-Methylguanine remains in the DNA helical wall of Z-DNA (26Moller A. Nordheim A. Nichols S.R. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4777-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and presumably in the helical wall of L-DNA (1Maas R. Cell. 2001; 105: 945-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Exposure in the wall of the helix could be one recognition basis for base alterations. Methylcytosine on the other hand is frequently found in supercoiled B-DNA. Thus, when methylcytosine is removed it is recognized on a different basis. A strategy used by the scientist in the laboratory to identify methylcytosine in DNA is to convert it to uracil (27Grigg G. Clark S. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). The strategy appears to have its biological counterpart, and furthermore ExoIII is involved in the removal of uracil from DNA. Methylcytosine is altered in vivo by hydrolytic deamination to thymine. When dcm-methyltransferase is overproduced in E. coli, G-C → T-A transitions are increased (29Bandaru B. Gopal J. Bhagwat A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7851-7859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting saturation of a system that normally corrects the meC → T transitions. Unambiguous correction of the mismatch at the modified base further suggests that transitions and their reversion are part of DNA metabolism. In fact, the enzyme responsible for meC → T transitions has been described in E. coli (30Yebra M.J. Bhagwat A.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14752-14757Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). dcm-methyltransferase deaminates its own product 5-methylcytosine to thymine in the absence of methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (30Yebra M.J. Bhagwat A.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14752-14757Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 31Sharath A.N. Weinhold E. Bhagwat A.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14611-14616Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Methyl transfer within T in G-T mismatches from C5 to O4 could provide an intermediate analogous to O-methylguanine, giving rise to uracil when demethylated. Uracil opposite G in DNA is corrected by an active dedicated glycosylase, conserved from bacteria to man, and the correction is dependent on ExoIII in E. coli and presumably on the ExoIII homolog HAP1 in man. Thus, the above series of reactions provides a fool-proof system for the unambiguous removal of meC. The methylcytosine removal process ends in mutation, however, when the T-to-U transition followed by U excision does not take place. It has been suggested that DNA “damage” results from metabolites present in the cell (32Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4378) Google Scholar, 33Mackay W.J. Han S. Samson L.D. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3224-3230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This work provides evidence that methylation of guanine, a modification that optimizes replication, is a normal cellular process that is reversed, deactivating replication. Methylated bases are in fact detected in the DNA of cells that have not been exposed to exogenous mutagens (34Park J.W. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7467-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 35Tan B.H. Bencsath F.A. Gaubatz J.W. Mutat. Res. 1990; 237: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Under the circumstances DNA “lesions” (36Gonzalgo M.L. Jones P.A. Mutat. Res. 1997; 386: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) can be explained by the failure to revert programmed DNA alterations. An understanding of mechanisms that regulate DNA function by reversible alterations of the DNA structure or the code itself could lead to new therapeutic approaches for reducing cancer risk, because insufficiencies in DNA metabolism as well as mutagenic agents may result in damaging mutagenesis. The technical assistance of Frank Alessandro was invaluable. I have appreciated discussions with many colleagues, particularly Werner K. Maas. I am indebted to Ashok Bhagwat for the generous gift of high quality EcoRII. I am also grateful for the generosity of my chairman, Claudio Basilico."
