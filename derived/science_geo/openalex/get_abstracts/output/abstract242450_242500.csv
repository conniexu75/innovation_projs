https://openalex.org/W2003579943,Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection causes chronic liver diseases and is a global public health problem. Detailed analyses of HCV have been hampered by the lack of viral culture systems. Subgenomic replicons of the JFH1 genotype 2a strain cloned from an individual with fulminant hepatitis replicate efficiently in cell culture. Here we show that the JFH1 genome replicates efficiently and supports secretion of viral particles after transfection into a human hepatoma cell line (Huh7). Particles have a density of about 1.15-1.17 g/ml and a spherical morphology with an average diameter of about 55 nm. Secreted virus is infectious for Huh7 cells and infectivity can be neutralized by CD81-specific antibodies and by immunoglobulins from chronically infected individuals. The cell culture-generated HCV is infectious for chimpanzee. This system provides a powerful tool for studying the viral life cycle and developing antiviral strategies.

https://openalex.org/W1967268303,"Rapid, multiplexed, sensitive and specific molecular detection is of great demand in gene profiling, drug screening, clinical diagnostics and environmental analysis. One of the major challenges in multiplexed analysis is to identify each specific reaction with a distinct label or 'code'. Two encoding strategies are currently used: positional encoding, in which every potential reaction is preassigned a particular position on a solid-phase support such as a DNA microarray, and reaction encoding, where every possible reaction is uniquely tagged with a code that is most often optical or particle based. The micrometer size, polydispersity, complex fabrication process and nonbiocompatibility of current codes limit their usability. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of dendrimer-like DNA-based, fluorescence-intensity-coded nanobarcodes, which contain a built-in code and a probe for molecular recognition. Their application to multiplexed detection of the DNA of several pathogens is first shown using fluorescence microscopy and dot blotting, and further demonstrated using flow cytometry that resulted in detection that was sensitive (attomole) and rapid."

Overexpression of genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes or transcription factors have resulted in tomatoes with improved carotenoid or flavonoid content, but never with both3,4,5,6,7. We attempted to increase tomato fruit nutritional value by suppressing an endogenous photomorphogenesis regulatory gene, DET1, using fruit-specific promoters combined with RNA interference (RNAi) technology. Molecular analysis indicated that DET1 transcripts were indeed specifically degraded in transgenic fruits. Both carotenoid and flavonoid contents were increased significantly, whereas other parameters of fruit quality were largely unchanged. These results demonstrate that manipulation of a plant regulatory gene can simultaneously influence the production of several phytonutrients generated from independent biosynthetic pathways, and provide a novel example of the use of organ-specific gene silencing to improve the nutritional value of plant-derived products."

Recent imaging data indicate similarities in the underlying neuronal network. We hypothesized that placebo analgesia is a special case of reward processing and that placebo treatment could modulate emotional perception in the same way as does pain perception. The behavioral part of this study indicates that placebo treatment has an effect on how subjects perceive unpleasant pictures. Furthermore, event-related fMRI demonstrated that the same modulatory network, including the rostral anterior cingulate cortex and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, is involved in both emotional placebo and placebo analgesia. These effects were correlated with the reported placebo effect and were predicted by the amount of treatment expectation induced on a previous day. Thus, the placebo effect may be considered to be a general process of modulation induced by the subjects’ expectations. Placebo analgesia and reward processing share several features.

These effects were correlated with the reported placebo effect and were predicted by the amount of treatment expectation induced on a previous day. Thus, the placebo effect may be considered to be a general process of modulation induced by the subjects’ expectations. The neuroscientific basis of placebo analgesia was firmly established when Levine et al. (Levine et al., 1978Levine J.D. Gordon N.C. Fields H.L. The mechanism of placebo analgesia.Lancet. 1978; 2: 654-657Abstract PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar) discovered that the placebo response could be blocked using the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, indicating involvement of the endogenous opioid system. Following this finding, complex experimental designs have elucidated several components underlying the placebo analgesia response. For instance, a robust and replicable correlation has been shown between the degree of expected efficiency of the treatment (treatment expectation) and the reported decrease in pain rating following placebo treatment (placebo-induced analgesia) (Price, 1999Price D. Placebo analgesia.in: Price D.D. Psychological Mechanisms of Pain and Analgesia. I.A.S.P. Press, Seattle, WA1999: 155-181Google Scholar, Wall, 1999Wall P. The placebo and the placebo response.in: Wall P. Melzack R. Textbook of Pain. Churchill Livingstone, New York1999: 1419-1430Google Scholar). One strategy for induction of treatment expectations has been to lower the noxious stimulation level (after an initial exposure) when a nonspecific treatment, i.e., placebo, was applied, without informing the subjects about this procedure (Montgomery and Kirsch, 1997Montgomery G.H. Kirsch I. Classical conditioning and the placebo effect.Pain. 1997; 72: 107-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, Price et al., 1999Price D.D. Milling L.S. Kirsch I.

Coleman G. The role of conditioning and verbal expectancy in the placebo response.Pain. 1990; 43: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). After the learning phase, a new placebo treatment was followed by a noxious stimulation that was once again set to the pretreatment level. The placebo effect was highly enhanced compared to when no such prior manipulation was performed (Voudouris et al., 1989Voudouris N.J. Peck C.L. Coleman G. Conditioned response models of placebo phenomena: further support.Pain. 1989; 38: 109-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, Voudouris et al., 1990Voudouris N.J. Peck C.L. Coleman G. The role of conditioning and verbal expectancy in the placebo response.Pain. 1990; 43: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) or when the subjects were fully informed about the manipulation (Montgomery and Kirsch, 1997Montgomery G.H. Kirsch I. Classical conditioning and the placebo effect.Pain. 1997; 72: 107-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Another strategy to induce treatment expectation has been to first induce analgesia with a specific drug (e.g., an opioid) and to then administer a placebo treatment, informing the subjects that the same drug was used although it actually consisted of a nonspecific treatment (Amanzio and Benedetti, 1999Amanzio M. Benedetti F. Neuropharmacological dissection of placebo analgesia: expectation-activated opioid systems versus conditioning-activated specific subsystems.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 484-494PubMed Google Scholar). Both strategies are much more effective than just informing subjects falsely about the efficiency of a treatment, i.e., placebo without any active manipulation. In other words, placebo has been shown to be crucially dependent on learning effects. This is exemplified by the strong correlation between treatment expectations and the placebo effect (Price et al., 1999Price D.D. Milling L.S. Kirsch I. Duff A. Montgomery G.H. Nicholls S.S. An analysis of factors that contribute to the magnitude of placebo analgesia in an experimental paradigm.Pain. 1999; 83: 147-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Expectations are fundamental in all emotional processes, allowing the individual to interact with an upcoming emotional or motivational situation before it actually occurs. It has been postulated that the ventral tegmental area (VTA) modulates a reward network, including the amygdala, the orbitofrontal cortex (Obfc), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the striatum, through dopaminergic projections in order to accomplish reward learning (Schultz, 2002Schultz W. Getting formal with dopamine and reward.Neuron. 2002; 36: 241-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). One critical component in this process is reward expectation, which includes a similar dopamine-dependent activation in part of this network during the anticipation phase. The neural correlate of expectation has been shown in several functional imaging studies of emotion in general, and of reward processing specifically (Breiter et al., 2001Breiter H.C. Aharon I.

It has been suggested that the ventral striatum responds in a linear fashion to the degree of the reward both during the anticipatory (Breiter et al., 2001Breiter H.C. Aharon I. Kahneman D. Dale A.

Reward processing also includes components other than learning, such as motivational and affective-emotional processes (Berridge and Robinson, 2003Berridge K.C. Robinson T.E. Parsing reward.Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 507-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Similarly, apart from being important for learning, reward expectation has a direct effect on the emotional experience. Different reward expectations and outcomes directly influence how we feel and how a subsequent specific stimulation is emotionally experienced (Mellers, 2000Mellers B.A. Choice and the relative pleasure of consequences.Psychol. Bull. 2000; 126: 910-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The rationale for the direct effect of reward expectation on emotional experience may be interpreted in the light of emotional experience being a bias signal for cognitive processes (Bechara et al., 1997Bechara A. Damasio H. Tranel D. Damasio A.R. Deciding advantageously before knowing the advantageous strategy.Science. 1997; 275: 1293-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (2319) Google Scholar, Damasio, 1996Damasio A.R.

Recently, functional imaging studies have described underlying neuronal networks involved in the placebo analgesia process (Lieberman et al., 2004Lieberman M.D. Jarcho J.M. Berman S. Naliboff B.D.

Placebo-induced changes in FMRI in the anticipation and experience of pain.Science. 2004; 303: 1162-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar) and their effect on the pain matrix (Lieberman et al., 2004Lieberman M.D. Jarcho J.M. Berman S. Naliboff B.D. Suyenobu B.Y. Mandelkern M. Mayer E.A. The neural correlates of placebo effects: a disruption account.Neuroimage. 2004; 22: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, Wager et al., 2004Wager T.D. Rilling J.K. Smith E.E.

Placebo-induced changes in FMRI in the anticipation and experience of pain.Science. 2004; 303: 1162-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar), although no relationship has yet been proven between treatment expectation and the placebo response in the brain. Pain is a composite perception and includes sensory, motivational, and central control processing (Melzack and Casey, 1968Melzack R. Casey K.L. Sensory, motivational and central control determinants of pain.in: Kenshalo D.R. The Skin Senses. CC Thomas, Springfield, IL1968: 423-439Google Scholar). The medial pain system, which includes the ACC and the insula, is thought to be involved in the emotional-motivational aspect of pain processing (Vogt et al., 1993Vogt B.A. Sikes R.W. Vogt L.J. Anterior cingulate cortex and the medial pain system.in: Vogt B.A. Gabriel M. Neurobiology of Cingulate Cortex and Limbic Thalamus. Birkhäuser, Boston1993: 313-344Crossref Google Scholar). Regions activated by noxious stimulation and specifically belonging to the medial pain system (Peyron et al., 2000Peyron R. Laurent B. Garcia-Larrea L. Functional imaging of brain responses to pain. A review and meta-analysis (2000).Neurophysiol. Clin. 2000; 30: 263-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar, Vogt et al., 1993Vogt B.A. Sikes R.W. Vogt L.J.

Lieberman M.D. Williams K.D. Does rejection hurt? An FMRI study of social exclusion.Science. 2003; 302: 290-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (2261) Google Scholar). Moreover, a similar network takes part in the processing of unpleasant emotions (Phillips et al., 2003Phillips M.L. Drevets W.C. Rauch S.L. Lane R. Neurobiology of emotion perception I: The neural basis of normal emotion perception.Biol. Psychiatry. 2003; 54: 504-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). Apart from the involvement of similar regions in the processing of pain and emotion, both placebo analgesia (Lieberman et al., 2004Lieberman M.D. Jarcho J.M. Berman S. Naliboff B.D. Suyenobu B.Y. Mandelkern M. Mayer E.A. The neural correlates of placebo effects: a disruption account.Neuroimage. 2004; 22: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, Petrovic et al., 2002Petrovic P.

Placebo-induced changes in FMRI in the anticipation and experience of pain.Science. 2004; 303: 1162-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar) and emotional regulation (Bishop et al., 2004Bishop S.

Neurosci. 2004; 7: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, Ochsner et al., 2002Ochsner K.N. Bunge S.A. Gross J.J. Gabrieli J.D. Rethinking feelings: an FMRI study of the cognitive regulation of emotion.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2002; 14: 1215-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar) are associated with increased activation in a modulatory network that includes the rostral ACC (rACC) and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC)/lateral Obfc (lObfc). This suggests a functional-anatomical relationship between placebo analgesia and emotional regulation in which a top-down modulation of the pain or emotional network is implemented. There are thus similarities between placebo analgesia and reward processing, especially as both involve anticipation of a positive outcome and are highly dependent on expectations. The main difference is that the concept of a placebo effect involves a reduced aversion, while the reward concept is associated with a pleasant experience. Here we suggest that placebo analgesia is actually a special case of reward processing, in agreement with recent theoretical considerations (Fields, 2004Fields H. State-dependent opioid control of pain.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, Vase et al., 2004Vase L. Price D.D. Verne G.N. Robinson M.E. The contribution of changes in expected pain levels and desire for pain relief to placebo analgesia.in: Price D.D. Bushnell M.C. Psychological Methods of Pain Control: Basic Science and Clinical Perspectives, Progress in Pain Research and Management, Volume 29. IASP Press, Seattle2004: 207-232Google Scholar). If this is the case, the mechanisms underlying the placebo analgesia effect must be viewed as a general process not specifically coupled to pain. We therefore suggest that the placebo phenomenon may be applied to any emotional experience. To test this hypothesis, we probed for placebo effects in the setting of unpleasant emotional experience induced by standardized affective pictures. In order to generate a strong placebo effect, we induced a treatment expectation in the group of participating subjects 1 day prior to the test day using drugs that have well-described specific effects on the emotional experience (anxiolytic drug and blocker of the anxiolytic drug). This procedure was termed an “expectation manipulation” in analogy with previous similar active manipulations preceding placebo analgesia (Amanzio and Benedetti, 1999Amanzio M. Benedetti F.

On day 2, we tested for behavioral placebo effects and whether the same underlying network was involved in emotional placebo as in placebo analgesia (Lieberman et al., 2004Lieberman M.D. Jarcho J.M.

Top-down modulation of perceptions is often an effect of regulation through secondary sensory regions and limbic networks (Mesulam, 1998Mesulam M.-M. From sensation to cognition.Brain. 1998; 121: 1013-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar).

Thus we hypothesized that activation of the extrastriate cortex and the amygdala should be attenuated, while activation of the prefrontal regions and the rACC should be augmented by the placebo treatment in the present study of visual emotional processing. If these physiological effects truly mirror a placebo mechanism, they should also be most evident in the subjects that demonstrated the strongest behaviorally measured placebo response (Wager et al., 2004Wager T.D. Rilling J.K. Smith E.E. Sokolik A. Casey K.L. Davidson R.J. Kosslyn S.M. Rose R.M. Cohen J.D. Placebo-induced changes in FMRI in the anticipation and experience of pain.Science. 2004; 303: 1162-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Given the relationship between treatment expectation and placebo response, we also tested whether the placebo-dependent responses in the brain directly correlated with the degree of expectation. The degree of expectation was approximated to the reported behavioral effect of the specific treatment preceding the placebo procedure. We enrolled 15 healthy subjects in a 2 day experiment to study the placebo effect on visual emotional processing using a set of standardized affective pictures (IAPS) (Lang et al., 1995Lang P. Bradley M. Cuthbert B. International Affective Picture System (IAPS): Technical Manual and Affective Ratings. The center for research in psychophysiology, University of Florida, Gainseville, FL1995Google Scholar). On the first day, anxiolytic and anxiolytic-blocker drugs were used in order to modulate the experience of unpleasant pictures. Specific treatment induced an expectancy effect for the drugs, which is an important factor in the induction of a placebo response. On the second day, the subjects were treated with the placebo while viewing the same type of unpleasant pictures. The underlying neural response was simultaneously measured using event-related fMRI. On day 1, the subjects were shown three presentation blocks (with a duration of approximately 5 min each) of pseudorandomly mixed unpleasant and neutral pictures. The subjects were asked to rate the mean perceived unpleasantness of the viewed unpleasant pictures at the end of each presentation block using a visual analog scale ranging from 0 to 100. After the first presentation in which no drugs had been given (presentation block 1; unpleasantness rating = 51.0; range = 30–76), the subjects were treated with a low dose of benzodiazepine intravenously (midazolam, 0.015 mg/kg), which dramatically decreased the unpleasantness rating in each subject during the second presentation (presentation block 2; unpleasantness rating = 29.0; range = 8–52) (Figure 1A ). This effect was completely reversed in the third presentation (presentation block 3; unpleasantness rating = 60.9; range = 25–88) for all subjects by pretreating them intravenously with a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist (flumazenil, 0.25 mg) (Figure 1A). The subjects were informed of the possible effect of the anxiolytic and the anxiolytic blocker drugs on their perception of emotions before the experiment and before each picture presentation block. Thus, on the first day a robust expectation of the treatment effect was induced (i.e., the experience of the drug treatment and the given information), which is an important component in the placebo response. The subjects were further told that both the anxiolytic drug and the anxiolytic blocker would be used again on day 2 in the fMRI experiment. On day 2, the subjects underwent the event-related fMRI s"

https://openalex.org/W2116301223,"During viral infection, fusion of the viral envelope with endosomal membranes and nucleocapsid release were thought to be concomitant events. We show here that for the vesicular stomatitis virus they occur sequentially, at two successive steps of the endocytic pathway. Fusion already occurs in transport intermediates between early and late endosomes, presumably releasing the nucleocapsid within the lumen of intra-endosomal vesicles, where it remains hidden. Transport to late endosomes is then required for the nucleocapsid to be delivered to the cytoplasm. This last step, which initiates infection, depends on the late endosomal lipid lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) and its putative effector Alix/AIP1, and is regulated by phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) signalling via the PtdIns(3)P-binding protein Snx16. We conclude that the nucleocapsid is exported into the cytoplasm after the back-fusion of internal vesicles with the limiting membrane of late endosomes, and that this process is controlled by the phospholipids LBPA and PtdIns(3)P and their effectors."

This prompted us to address the capacity of the Tudor domain to function as a general methylarginine-binding protein module.

Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar) with the following mutagenic oligonucleotides, 5′-TGG AAA TAG AAA GGA GCA AAA T-3′ and 5′-ATT TTG CTC CTT TCT ATT TCC A-3′, and using the T7 promoter primer and the universal primer as flanking oligonucleotides. Peptides and Purification of GST-Tudor Proteins—GST fusion proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL-21 cells (Invitrogen) by induction with a final concentration of 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Following induction, cells were spun down, resuspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (1× PBS: 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) in the presence of Complete™ (Roche Applied Science) protease inhibitor mixture and subsequently broken down by sonication (5 pulses of 15 s each). Cell debris were discarded through centrifugation for 20 min at 18,000 × g. GST fusion proteins were then purified using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). For GST pull-down experiments, fusion proteins were kept on glutathione-agarose as a 50% slurry in 1× PBS. Alternatively, GST fusion proteins were eluted from the beads with 60 mm glutathione in PBS adjusted to pH 7.5. The peptides (RG)4 and (RsDMAG)4 were synthesized at W. M. Keck Biotech Resource Center. In Vivo Methylation Assays and Tudor Binding Assays—HeLa cells were grown for 3 h in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) dialyzed fetal calf serum and 10 μCi/ml l-[methyl-3H]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 85 Ci/mmol) in the presence of translation inhibitors (100 μg/ml cycloheximide and 40 μg/ml chloramphenicol) as described previously (11.Cote J. Boisvert F.M. Boulanger M.C. Bedford M.T. Richard S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 274-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In parallel, labeling was performed with l-[35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 175 Ci/mmol) under the same conditions to control for the efficient inhibition of translation. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl containing 0.01% phenyl-methanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg of aprotinin/ml, and 1 μg of leupeptin/ml). The cellular debris were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 20 μl of 50% slurry of the purified glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins bound to glutathione-agarose. 250 ng of GST fusion protein was utilized per “pull-down” assay. Once the incubation was complete, the beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with 1× PBS to remove the unbound proteins. The bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the labeled proteins were visualized by fluorography using En3Hance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Methylase Inhibitor Treatment and Immunoblotting Assays—HeLa cells were incubated for 20 h with either the vehicle (Me2SO) or the methyltransferase inhibitor 5′-deoxy-5′-(methyl-thio)adenosine (MTA) (Sigma) or adenosine-2′,3′-dialdehyde (AdOx) (Sigma), each at a final concentration of 250 μm. The treated cells were lysed in lysis buffer and incubated with the GST-Tudor fusion proteins as described above. The bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with anti-SYM10, -SYM11, or -Sam68 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), anti-SmB/D monoclonal antibody ana128 (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA), anti-SmE (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or anti-actin (Sigma). The secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (ICN Pharmaceuticals), and chemiluminescence was used for protein detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Tudor Blot Overlay Assay—HeLa cell lysates were prepared with lysis buffer as described above, and the cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 with 2% nonfat dry milk. The membranes were then incubated with 1 μg/ml purified GST-SMN-Tdr in the same buffer for 16 h at 4 °C. The filters were washed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20, and the bound GST-SMN-Tdr was visualized by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibodies. The anti-GST antibodies were raised in rabbits using purified GST as an antigen. The secondary antibody was a goat anti-rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (ICN Pharmaceuticals), and chemiluminescence was used for protein detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Peptide Binding Assays—Biotin was added at the N terminus of each peptide using EZ-Link™ N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (Pierce). For the peptide/GST-Tudor binding assays the peptides were bound to streptavidin-agarose (Sigma) to generate peptide affinity columns, and these were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with increasing concentrations (10–40 ng) of purified GST-Tudor proteins in lysis buffer. The beads were washed with lysis buffer, and the bound GST-Tudor proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibodies. Cell-permeable Peptides and Immunofluorescence Staining—HeLa cells were plated on glass coverslips cells and incubated for 3 h with 20 μm (RG)4 or (RsDMAG)4 peptides coupled at their N termini with the Antennapedia internalization sequence peptide (rhodamine-RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKKC) using Sulfo-SMCC (Pierce Endogen). The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS, pH 7.4, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS. The peptide intake by the cells was visualized directly using the rhodamine fluorescence tag on the peptide. Indirect immunofluorescence staining was performed using ana128 anti-SmB/D antibodies at 1:10 in 1× PBS. The secondary antibody (1:300) was an Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse antibody from Invitrogen. The nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and the cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Tudor Domains Bind Endogenous Methylated Proteins—We generated a recombinant fusion protein consisting of GST fused to amino acids 90–149 of SMN encompassing the Tudor domain (GST-SMN-Tdr). The fusion protein was coupled to glutathione-agarose and incubated with extracts prepared from HeLa cells grown in the presence of l-[methyl-3H]methionine and translation inhibitors, a procedure that results in the labeling of endogenously methylated proteins (11.Cote J. Boisvert F.M. Boulanger M.C. Bedford M.T. Richard S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 274-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Interestingly, GST-SMN-Tdr bound several methylated cellular proteins that were not bound by GST alone (Fig. 1A). To determine whether this observation could be generalized, we used two additional Tudor domains for our analysis: one from SPF30 and the other from TDRD3. A proteomic analysis of the complete repertoire of the mammalian splicing machinery identified SPF30 (also known as SMNrp) and TDRD3 (55.Neubauer G. King A. Rappsilber J. Calvio C. Watson M. Ajuh P.

Genet. 1998; 7: 2149-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast, TDRD3 (REFSEQ, NM_030794.1), which has a predicted molecular mass of 73 kDa, is known to be expressed based on the presence of several expressed sequence tags but is uncharacterized. To determine whether the Tudor domains of SPF30 and TDRD3 also interact with methylated proteins, GST pull-down experiments were performed as above, with lysates prepared from in vivo [3H]methionine-labeled extracts. Similar to GST-SMN-Tdr, GST-SPF30-Tdr and GST-TDRD3-Tdr bound several methylated proteins from the HeLa cells extract that were not bound by GST alone (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–5). Although the different Tudor domains bound many proteins that appeared similar, each Tudor domain had a unique profile of interacting proteins. The same experiment was performed in parallel using a traditional in vivo metabolic labeling (Fig. 1B, lanes 6–10, 35S-methionine) to obtain the profile of all of the proteins that bound these Tudor domains, regardless of the methylation status. The relative amount of the GST-Tudor proteins used in pull-down experiments was visualized by Coomassie staining (Fig. 1C). The Tudor Domains of SMN, SPF30, and TDRD3 Contact Directly sDMA-containing Polypeptides—Our in vivo labeling experiment demonstrated that Tudor domains predominantly bound methylated proteins in the cell but did not address whether the proteins contained methylated arginines. HeLa cell extracts were incubated with GST-Tudor domains or GST alone, and the bound proteins were immunoblotted with the sDMA-specific antibodies SYM10 and SYM11 (61.Boisvert F.M. Cote J. Boulanger M.C. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 1319-1330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 62.Boisvert F.M. Cote J. Boulanger M.C. Cleroux P. Bachand F. Autexier C. Richard S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 957-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Each Tudor domain bound several cellular sDMA-containing proteins from the subset of polypeptides recognized by SYM10/11 (Fig. 2A, lanes 3–5). It is known that SMN binds methylated p80-coilin and Sm proteins (29.Brahms H. Meheus L. de Brabandere V. Fischer U. Luhrmann R. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1531-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 30.Friesen W.J. Massenet S. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Dreyfuss G. Mol.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2720-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Indeed p80-coilin, SmB/B′, and SmD1/SmD3 were confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-p80-coilin and Sm antibodies (Fig. 2B). As predicted from the structural analysis of the Tudor domain (42.Selenko P. Sprangers R. Stier G. Buhler D. Fischer U. Sattler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) the E134K amino acid substitution that was introduced within GST-SMN-Tdr abolished the binding to sDMA-containing interactors (Fig. 2A, lane 6). Arginine methylation was shown previously to enhance the binding of Sm proteins to the SMN complex (29.Brahms H. Meheus L. de Brabandere V. Fischer U. Luhrmann R. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1531-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 30.Friesen W.J. Massenet S. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1111-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). To ask whether the methyl mark was required for the binding of Sm proteins to the isolated Tudor domains, we performed GST-pull-down assays with protein extracts prepared from HeLa cells grown in the presence or not of 250 μm MTA, a competitive inhibitor of methyltransferases. This treatment resulted in a reduction of ∼50% of the methylated epitopes recognized by SYM10 (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 1 and 2), whereas the levels of Sam68 protein remained equivale"

Pentameric IgM has a single J chain, which is absent in the hexamer. The μ (heavy) chain of IgM has five N-linked glycosylation sites. Asn-171, Asn-332, and Asn-395 are occupied by complex glycans, whereas Asn-402 and Asn-563 are occupied by oligomannose glycans. The glycosylation of human polyclonal IgM from serum has been analyzed. IgM was found to contain 23.4% oligomannose glycans GlcNAc2Man5–9, consistent with 100% occupancy of Asn-402 and 17% occupancy of the variably occupied site at Asn-563. Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) is a member of the collectin family of proteins, which bind to oligomannose and GlcNAc-terminating structures. A commercial affinity chromatography resin containing immobilized MBL has been reported to be useful for partial purification of mouse and also human IgM. Human IgM glycoforms that bind to immobilized MBL were isolated; these accounted for only 20% of total serum IgM. Compared with total serum IgM, the MBL-binding glycoforms contained 97% more GlcNAc-terminating structures and 8% more oligomannose structures. A glycosylated model of pentameric IgM was constructed, and from this model, it became evident that IgM has two distinct faces, only one of which can bind to antigen, as the J chain projects from the non-antigen-binding face. Antigen-bound IgM does not bind to MBL, as the target glycans appear to become inaccessible once IgM has bound antigen. Antigen-bound IgM pentamers therefore do not activate complement via the lectin pathway, but MBL might have a role in the clearance of aggregated IgM.

Antigen-bound IgM pentamers therefore do not activate complement via the lectin pathway, but MBL might have a role in the clearance of aggregated IgM. The glycoprotein IgM is the major antibody produced in the primary immune response to foreign antigens. It exists both as part of the B cell antigen receptor on the surface of B cells and as a secreted glycoprotein. Human secreted IgM is a multimeric molecule consisting of five (pentameric) (Fig. 1) or six (hexameric) 190-kDa subunits, each of which consists of two heavy (μ) and two light chains. Pentameric IgM has also a single 20-kDa J chain, which is absent in hexameric IgM (1Randall T.D. King L.B. Corley R.B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1971-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The μ (heavy) chains consist of five Ig domains termed Vμ, Cμ1, Cμ2, Cμ3, and Cμ4. Interchain disulfide bridges occur in the Cμ2, Cμ3, and Cμ4/tail domains at Cys-337, Cys-414, and Cys-575, respectively. Light chains are attached to Cys-136 in the Cμ1 domain. The polymerization of IgM requires Cys-575 (2Wiersma E.J. Shulman M.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5265-5272PubMed Google Scholar), located on the 18-residue tail piece, at the C terminus of each Cμ4 domain. In contrast to the Ig domains, the tail piece has no defined secondary or tertiary structure (3Wormald M.R. Wooten E.W. Bazzo R. Edge C.J. Feinstein A. Rademacher T.W. Dwek R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), but is required for the polymerization of monomeric IgM (4Baker M.D. Wu G.E. Toone W.M. Murialdo H. Davis A.C. Shulman M.J. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 1724-1728PubMed Google Scholar). The J chain is attached via Cys-14 and Cys-68 to the penultimate amino acid of two μ chains in pentameric IgM (Cys-575) (5Mestecky J. Schrohenloher R.E. Nature. 1974; 249: 650-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 6Chapuis R.M. Koshland M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the absence of a J chain during polymerization, cells secrete solely hexameric IgM (8Randall T.D. Brewer J.W. Corley R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18002-18007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The J chain also binds to the poly-Ig receptor, which mediates epithelial transcytosis (9Brandtzaeg P. Prydz H. Nature. 1984; 311: 71-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Human secreted IgM has five N-linked glycosylation sites on each μ chain, located at Asn-171, Asn-332, Asn-395, Asn-402, and Asn-563. The J chain contains a single N-linked glycosylation site at Asn-48. The light chains (κ or λ) contain no conserved N-linked glycosylation sites. Glycosylation is vital to IgM secretion and B cell surface presentation (10Sitia R. Rubartelli A. Hammerling U. Mol. Immunol. 1984; 21: 709-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Oligomannose structures have been shown to occupy two N-linked sites on IgM at Asn-402 and Asn-563 (11Chapman A. Kornfeld R. J. Biol.

These oligosaccharides may present a target for serum mannan-binding lectin (MBL). 1The abbreviations used are: MBL, mannan-binding lectin; MASP, MBL-associated serine protease; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; TNP, 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; 2-AB, 2-aminobenzamide; NP, normal phase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; CH, constant heavy. 1The abbreviations used are: MBL, mannan-binding lectin; MASP, MBL-associated serine protease; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; TNP, 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; 2-AB, 2-aminobenzamide; NP, normal phase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; CH, constant heavy. MBL, also known as mannan/mannose-binding protein, is a member of the collectin family of proteins (13Malhotra R. Haurum J. Thiel S. Sim R.B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1437-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). MBL is synthesized in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream. It binds calcium-dependently to sugars that have hydroxyl groups on C-3 and C-4 orientated in the equatorial plane of the pyranose ring (14Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). This gives MBL affinity for mannose, fucose, and GlcNAc (15Turner M.W. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 532-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) present on the surfaces of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi (16Holmskov U. Malhotra R. Sim R.B. Jensenius J.C. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), but not generally for human glycoprotein glycans, the structures of which usually terminate in galactose or sialic acid. It binds to sugar residues via the carbohydrate recognition domain (lectin) heads. The affinity of a single carbohydrate recognition domain for carbohydrate is very weak (10-3 m) (17Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but multiple carbohydrate recognition domain binding leads to much greater avidity. The levels of MBL in human serum vary greatly between individuals (15Turner M.W. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 532-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), from <50 ng/ml to >10 μg/ml. MBL has a structure and function similar to those of the complement protein C1q and participates in the host defense response through two major pathways. First, it acts directly as an opsonin, promoting phagocytosis of foreign material to which it has bound. Second, it triggers the lectin pathway of complement activation (18Vorup-Jensen T. Petersen S.V. Hansen A.G. Poulsen K. Schwaeble W. Sim R.B. Reid K.B. Davis S.J. Thiel S. Jensenius J.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2093-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 19Hajela K.

MBL circulates bound to MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) (19Hajela K. Kojima M. Ambrus G. Wong K.H. Moffatt B.E. Ferluga J. Hajela S. Gal P. Sim R.B. Immunobiology. 2002; 205: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Three MASPs have been characterized to date: MASP-1 and MASP-2 (20Matsushita M. Fujita T. J. Exp.

Jensenius J.C. Immunity. 2001; 15: 127-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). MASP-2 has been shown to cleave complement components C4 and C2, resulting in the formation of the C3 convertase C4b2a. The biological roles of MASP-1 and MASP-3 are unknown, although MASP-1 is known to cleave fibrinogen and activate Factor XIII (19Hajela K. Kojima M. Ambrus G. Wong K.H. Moffatt B.E. Ferluga J. Hajela S. Gal P. Sim R.B. Immunobiology. 2002; 205: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Glycoproteins, including the immunoglobulins, consist of a collection of glycosylated variants (glycoforms) in which a single amino acid sequence is diversified by the variable processing of glycans at each of the glycosylation sites. Some of these subpopulations may have glycans that are ligands for MBL. This has been demonstrated for IgG. MBL has been shown to bind agalactosyl glycoforms of IgG (known as IgG-G0) in which the single Asn-297 N-linked site in the IgG γ chain is occupied by glycans that have terminal GlcNAc residues (23Malhotra R. Wormald M.R. Rudd P.M. Fischer P.B. Dwek R.A. Sim R.B. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). IgG-G0 accounts for ∼35% of normal serum IgG (24Butler M. Quelhas D. Critchley A.J. Carchon H. Hebestreit H.F. Hibbert R.G. Vilarinho L. Teles E. Matthijs G. Schollen E. Argibay P. Harvey D.J. Dwek R.A. Jaeken J. Rudd P.M. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 601-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). MBL also binds polymeric forms of serum IgA (25Roos A. Bouwman L.H. van Gijlswijk-Janssen D.J. Faber-Krol M.C. Stahl G.L. Daha M.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2861-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), but the IgA glycans to which MBL binds have not been identified. There are conflicting reports about whether MBL interacts with IgM. Immobilized human myeloma IgM does not bind to human MBL (26Roos A. Bouwman L.H. Munoz J. Zuiverloon T. Faber-Krol M.C. Fallaux-van den Houten F.C. Klar-Mohamad N. Hack C.E. Tilanus M.G. Daha M.R. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 655-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), although mouse IgM and, to a lesser extent, human and bovine IgM can bind to immobilized rabbit MBL (27Nevens J.R. Mallia A.K. Wendt M.W. Smith P.K. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 597: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Rat MBL has also been reported to bind human IgM (28Koppel R. Solomon B. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 2001; 49: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The oligomannose structures that occupy Asn-402 and Asn-563 are potential ligands for MBL binding (28Koppel R. Solomon B. J.

Electron microscopy studies have shown that a considerable conformational change occurs in the IgM pentamer when it has bound to antigen. This might allow IgM to expose its oligomannose glycans upon antigen binding, providing a potential mechanism of clearance of IgM after its initial recognition via an MBL-dependent pathway (3Wormald M.R. Wooten E.W. Bazzo R. Edge C.J. Feinstein A. Rademacher T.W. Dwek R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). IgM interacts efficiently with the complement system and constitutes a first line of defense against infection. However, hexameric IgM is 20 times more efficient at activating complement compared with pentameric IgM (1Randall T.D. King L.B. Corley R.B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1971-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 29Davis A.C. Roux K.H. Shulman M.J. Eur. J.

The complement activation by IgM is attributed to C1q binding. The charged residues Asp-417, Glu-418, and His-420 in the Cμ3 domain of IgM have been proposed as the binding site for C1q on IgM (31Perkins S.J. Nealis A.S. Sutton B.J. Feinstein A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1345-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Here, we present the first comprehensive report of normal human serum IgM glycosylation and identify glycoforms of human serum IgM that do bind to MBL. Using molecular modeling, we have constructed a complete structure of glycosylated pentameric IgM and have assessed the accessibility of the identified oligomannose structures as binding targets for MBL. Antibodies and Antisera—Rabbit antiserum against recombinant MBL was adsorbed to remove anti-mannan antibodies and rheumatoid factors as described previously (32Arnold J.N. Radcliffe C.M. Wormald M.R. Royle L. Harvey D.J. Crispin M. Dwek R.A. Sim R.B. Rudd P.M. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 6831-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Protein Concentration—Protein samples (25 μg in any volume) were concentrated for general SDS-PAGE analysis by incubation with slow rotation at room temperature for 30 min with a 5-μl packed volume of StrataClean™ resin (Stratagene, Zuidoost, The Netherlands). The samples were then spun at 13,000 rpm for 1 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The resin was resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (200 mm Tris, 8 m urea, 2% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8) and loaded onto the gel. IgM was concentrated by chloroform/methanol precipitation adapted from the procedure described previously (33Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3108) Google Scholar). To 100 μl of IgM sample (in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 0.5 mm EDTA) was added 400 μl of methanol. This was vortexed and spun at 13,000 rpm for 30 s, and 100 μl of chloroform was added, vortexed, and spun again. To this was added 300 μl of water, followed by vortexing and spinning. There was a phase separation; the upper phase was removed and discarded; and 300 μl of methanol was added and vortexed. The precipitated IgM was pelleted by spinning at 13,000 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant was removed and discarded, and the pellet was dried in a vacuum centrifuge (Savant SpeedVac®, Thermo LifeSciences, Basingstoke, UK) for 30 min. This pellet was dissolved in 30 μl of sample buffer for SDS-PAGE analysis. Large-scale IgM Purification from Human Serum—The purification method was adapted from that of Johnstone and Thorpe (34Johnstone A. Thorpe R. Immunochemistry in Practice. 2nd Ed. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, UK1987Google Scholar). 1 liter of citrated pooled normal human plasma (HDS Supplies, High Wycombe, UK) was made 20 mm CaCl2 and left overnight at 4 °C to clot. The clot was filtered through muslin. IgM was precipitated from the serum at low salt by dialysis against 3 × 10 liters of 2 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0. The sample was centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C; the supernatant was discarded; and the pellet washed twice by resuspension in 100 ml of 2 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, at 4 °C. The pellet was redissolved in 100 ml of Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.3) at room temperature and centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 20 min at room temperature to remove undissolved material. A 50-ml sample was then applied to a Sepharose 4B gel filtration column (2.6 × 100 cm; Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) pre-equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at 4 °C, and the fractions judged to contain IgM by SDS-PAGE analysis were pooled. The sample was run through 215 ml of Matrex Blue B resin (3.2 × 30 cm; Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) pre-equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The flow-through fractions containing IgM were collected and pooled. IgM still contained small amounts of IgG and IgA identified by SDS-PAGE analysis and direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (γ chain-specific; A3187, Sigma, Poole, UK) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human IgA (α chain-specific; Sigma). IgG was removed using a 5-ml HiTrap-protein G column (Amersham Biosciences AB), and IgA was removed by passage through an anti-IgA (α chain-specific)-Sepharose column (A2691, Sigma). The final IgM was judged by SDS-PAGE analysis to be >95% pure and was dialyzed against Dulbecco's PBS (8.2 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 139 mm NaCl, and 3 mm KCl, pH 7.4; Oxoid Ltd., Hampshire, UK) containing 0.5 mm EDTA. Small-scale IgM Purification from Human Serum Using an ImmunoPure® IgM Purification Kit—The ImmunoPure® IgM purification kit was purchased from Pierce. The column was rabbit MBL-conjugated to a 4% beaded agarose support (5 ml), sold as a kit for purification of mouse IgM from ascites fluid. The column was run using human serum according to the directions of the manufacturer. The column was pre-washed with 5 ml of ImmunoPure® MBP (mannan-binding protein) column preparation buffer (Tris, sodium chloride, sodium azide, and EDTA, pH 7.4) at room temperature and then equilibrated with 20 ml of ImmunoPure® IgM binding buffer (Tris, sodium chloride, calcium chloride, and sodium azide, pH 7.4) at 4 °C. Human serum (500 μl) from citrated plasma as described above diluted 1:1 with ImmunoPure® IgM binding buffer was applied to the column at 4 °C and allowed to enter the resin completely. An additional 500 μl of ImmunoPure® IgM binding buffer was added and also allowed to enter the resin. The column was then incubated at 4 °C for 30 min and washed with 42 ml of ImmunoPure® IgM binding buffer. Bound protein was eluted at room temperature with 8 ml of ImmunoPure® IgM elution buffer (Tris, sodium chloride, sodium azide, and EDTA, pH 7.4). The bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and found to be a complex mixture containing <5% IgM. The material in the buffer as described above was run on a 10-ml anti-human IgM-agarose column (Medical Research Council Immunochemistry Unit), and the column was washed with 10 mm Hepes, 1 m NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. IgM was eluted from the column with 3 m MgCl2, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The fractions containing protein (detected by reading the absorbance at 280 nm) were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm Hepes, 1 m NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. The material was passed through a 1-ml HiTrap-protein G column (Amersham Biosciences AB) to remove IgG. IgM was judged to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE analysis. Preparation of 2,4,6-Trinitrophenyl (TNP)-conjugated Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and TNP-BSA-Sepharose—TNP-BSA was prepared by mixing 10 ml of 1% BSA in PBS and 0.5 mm EDTA with 2 ml of 5% (w/v) picrylsulfonic acid solution (P2297, Sigma). The pH was monitored to keep the mixture neutral to prevent BSA precipitation, and the mixture was left for 4 h at room temperature. TNP-BSA was then dialyzed exhaustively at 4 °C against PBS and 0.5 mm EDTA. TNP-BSA-Sepharose was prepared with 2 g of cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences AB) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Excess binding sites on the resin were blocked with 100 mm ethanolamine HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.5, and mixed by rotating for 2 h at room temperature. The resin was then equilibrated with PBS and 0.5 mm EDTA. The final resin contained 5 mg of TNP-BSA/ml of packed Sepharose. Purification and Arthrobacter ureafaciens Sialidase (ABS)/Bovine Testis β-Galactosidase (BTG) Treatment of Anti-TNP-BSA IgM from Human Serum—IgM was low salt-precipitated from 1 liter of pooled human serum (citrated pooled normal human plasma from HDS Supplies) and redissolved as described above. The IgM solution in Tris-buffered saline was spun at 60,000 rpm for 45 min to diminish lipid contamination, which formed as a layer at the meniscus. The material was passed through 5 ml of TNP-BSA-Sepharose in PBS and 0.5 mm EDTA. Bound material was eluted using 0.2 m glycine HCl, pH 2.2, and dialyzed against PBS and 0.5 mm EDTA. The major proteins eluted were IgM, IgG, Factor H, and IgA (identified by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry) (data not shown). IgG and IgA were removed as described above. Factor H was removed from the preparation by running the material through a 10-ml MRC OX23-Sepharose column (35Sim R.B. Day A.J. Moffatt B.E. Fontaine M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 13-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The final preparation was judged to be >95% pure IgM by SDS-PAGE analysis. The preparation was then treated with the exoglycosidases ABS (EC 3.2.1.18) at 3 milliunits/ml and BTG (EC 3.2.1.23) at 1 unit/ml to cleave the complex glycans on IgM to a terminal GlcNAc (a residue that would bind MBL). anti-TNP-BSA IgM (4.8 μg) in 4 ml of PBS was incubated with 30 microunits of ABS and 20 milliunits of BTG for 16 h at 37 °C and for several days at 4 °C. IgM Quantification by ELISA—The wells of an ELISA plate (Maxisorp, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 100 μl of 10 μg/ml goat anti-human IgM (μ chain-specific; H15000, Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in 0.1 m NaHCO2, pH 9.5. The wells were incubated overnight at 4 °C; blocked with 400 μl of PBS and 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature; and washed three times with 200 μl of PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.5 mm EDTA. IgM preparations were serially diluted in PBS and 0.1% Tween 20. IgM from the large-scale preparation was quantified from absorbance readings at 280 nm (extinction coefficient of 1.18 for 1 mg/ml) (34Johnstone A. Thorpe R. Immunochemistry in Practice. 2nd Ed. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, UK1987Google Scholar) and incubated, as a standard, for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed three times with PBS and 0.1% Tween 20, incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human IgM (μ chain-specific; 1:2000 dilution; A3437, Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, and washed again. 100 μl of p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (N1891, Sigma) was added; and the absorbance was read at 405 nm after 30 min. SDS-PAGE Separation of the J Chain and Western Blotting for the J Chain—The J chain has an apparent molecular mass similar to that of the Ig light chain on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. To separate these proteins for analysis of N-linked glycans, 20 μg of pooled normal human IgM was run on a Tricine-10–20% acrylamide gradient precast gel (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) for 70 min at 150 V in 1× NuPAGE® MES SDS running buffer (NP0002, Invitrogen). These gels were stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain (LC3065, Invitrogen) for 30 min and destained in water to visualize the bands. Western blotting was performed to locate the position of the J chain on the gel. An unstained gel was soaked in Western transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 0.2 m glycine, and 20% (v/v) methanol) for 10 min. A transfer membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) was prepared by soaking for 10 s in methanol, for 15 min in water, and for 15 min in transfer buffer. The semidry blot was run at 1.2 mA/cm2 for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was blocked with 1% (w/v) milk solution for 2 h at room temperature, washed three times for 5 min each with PBS and 0.1% Tween 20, and then incubated for 1 h with 0.5 μg/ml mouse anti-human J chain antibody (MCA693, Serotec, Oxford, UK) in the wash buffer. The membrane was washed three times, incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (γ chain-specific; 1:2000 dilution; A3438, Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times, and visualized using Sigma FAST™ 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium tablets (B5655, Sigma). This identified the position of the J chain that was separated the light chain. Removal of N-Linked Glycans for Analysis—Human IgM (20 μg) prepared by the large-scale method or by small-scale method using an ImmunoPure® IgM purification kit was run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by in-gel N-linked glycan release using peptide N-glycanase F (1000 units/ml; glycopeptidase, EC 3.5.1.52) as described previously (36Küster B.

Normal Phase (NP) HPLC and Weak Anion Exchange HPLC—Labeled glycans were separated by NP-HPLC (39Guile G.R. Rudd P.M. Wing D.R. Prime S.B. Dwek R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 210-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) and weak anion exchange HPLC (40Zamze S. Harvey D.J. Chen Y.J. Guile G.R. Dwek R.A. Wing D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 243-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Glycan profiles from NP-HPLC were calibrated against a dextran ladder prepared from hydrolyzed and 2-AB-labeled glucose oligomers (39Guile G.R. Rudd P.M. Wing D.R. Prime S.B. Dwek R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 210-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Glycans were assigned glucose units, and glycan structure/composition was predicted by reference to a glycan data base using the program PeakTime. 2E. Hart, R. A. Dwek, and P. M. Rudd, unpublished data. Exoglycosidase Digestions—Exoglycosidases were used to confirm the structures of glycans present in the preparations in conjunction with NP-HPLC (37Radcliffe C.M. Diedrich G.

Enzymes were used at the concentrations recommended by the manufacturers, and digestions were carried out using 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, for 16 h at 37 °C. The following enzymes were supplied by Glyko Inc. (Upper Heyford, UK): ABS (1–2 units/ml), almond meal α-fucosidase (3 milliunits/ml; EC 3.2.1.51), BTG (1 unit/ml), jack bean α-mannosidase (100 milliunits/ml; EC 3.2.1.24), Streptococcus pneumoniae β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (120 units/ml; EC 3.2.1.52), and bovine kidney fucosidase (100 units/ml; EC 3.1.1.51). Europa Bioproducts (Cambridge, UK) supplied S. penumoniae recombinant sialidase expressed in E. coli (1 unit/ml; Nanl; EC 3.2.1.18). The glucosidase II was prepared in the Glycobiology Institute. Mass Spectrometry—Non-2-AB-labeled N-linked glycans were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry from 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (41Royle L. Mattu T.S. Hart E. Langridge J.I. Merry A.H. Murphy N.

Here we identified novel PTEN-binding PDZ domains within the MAST205-related proteins, syntrophin-associated serine/threonine kinase and MAST3, characterized the regions of PTEN involved in its interaction with distinctive PDZ domains, and analyzed the functional consequences on PTEN of PDZ domain binding. Using a panel of PTEN mutations, as well as PTEN chimeras containing distinct domains of the related protein TPTE, we found that the PTP and C2 domains of PTEN do not affect PDZ domain binding and that the C-terminal tail of PTEN (residues 350–403) provides selectivity to recognize specific PDZ domains from MAGI-2, hDlg, and MAST205. Binding of PTEN to the PDZ-2 domain from MAGI-2 increased PTEN protein stability. Furthermore, binding of PTEN to the PDZ domains from microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinases facilitated PTEN phosphorylation at its C terminus by these kinases.

Alterations in the function of the PTEN phosphatase tumor suppressor protein are of major relevance for the incidence of a wide variety of human cancers, as well as for the occurrence of inherited growth disorders, grouped as PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes (1Eng C. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 22: 183-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Structurally, PTEN protein is composed of an N-terminal phosphatase catalytic domain and a C-terminal phospholipid-binding C2 domain; the integrity of both domains is required for full PTEN phosphatase activity and binding to membranes (2Lee J.-O.

The analysis of tumor specimens, tumor cell lines, and model organisms defective in PTEN protein expression has shown that the 3-phosphoinositide phosphatase activity of PTEN toward the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate is crucial for the control of cell growth, cell cycle, cell motility and migration, and apoptosis (3Maehama T.

In this regard, PTEN possesses a C-terminal tail (last 54 amino acids; residues 350–403), which harbors at its far C terminus a functional PDZ domain-binding motif (residues Thr401–Lys402–Val403–COOH). PDZ domains are modular protein interaction domains that in most cases recognize C-terminal motifs on their target proteins, playing important roles in protein targeting and/or protein complex assembly during cell signaling (22Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 23Fan J.-S. Zhang M. Neurosignals. 2002; 11: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24Hung A.Y.

The molecular basis of the protein-protein interactions mediated by PDZ domains has been extensively investigated by using peptides that mimic C-terminal binding motifs occurring in their cognate binding proteins (25Doyle D.A.

However, very little is known about the involvement of other parts of the PDZ domain-binding proteins in conferring strength and/or specificity to the interaction with their counterpart PDZ domains. PDZ domains that bind to PTEN include the PDZ-2 domain from the scaffolding proteins MAGI-1/2/3, the PDZ-2 domain from the human homologue of the Drosophila Dlg, hDlg/SAP97, and the unique PDZ domain from the Ser/Thr kinase MAST205 (12Adey N.B.

In the present study, using a panel of PTEN mutations and PTEN chimeras containing distinct domains of the related protein TPTE (31Chen H. Rossier C. Morris M.A. Scott H.S. Gos A. Bairoch A.

In addition, we show that PTEN also binds to the PDZ domains from the MAST205-related protein kinases, SAST 1The abbreviations used are: SAST, syntrophin-associated serine/threonine kinase; MAST, microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; mAb, monoclonal antibody. and MAST3. We further demonstrate that binding of PTEN to specific PDZ domains diminishes its degradation rate and facilitates its phosphorylation by MAST kinases. Our results suggest a regulatory role of PDZ domain binding on PTEN function by controlling its stability and phosphorylation status.

PTEN single amino acid substitutions, truncations, and deletions subcloned into pRK5 or pGEX were obtained by PCR oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids pRK5 GST and pRK5 GST-PDZ-2/MAGI-2 were made by PCR amplification of GST and GST-PDZ-2/MAGI-2 from pGEX-4T and pGEX-4T PDZ-2/MAGI-2, respectively, followed by subcloning into pRK5. The plasmids pJG4-5 PDZ-2/MAGI-2, pJG4-5 PDZ-2/MAGI-3, pJG4-5 PDZ/MAST205, pJG4-5 PDZ/MAST3, pJG4-5 PDZ/MAST4, and pJG4-5 PDZ/SAST, encoding the corresponding PDZ domains fused at their N terminus to the B42 transcription activation domain, were obtained by direct subcloning from the pGEX constructs indicated above. The plasmids pEG202 PTEN, encoding PTEN fused at its N terminus to the LexA DNA-binding domain, were obtained by subcloning the entire PTEN coding sequence (residues 1–403), wild type or single amino acid substitutions, or PTEN truncation or deletion mutants into pEG202. To obtain the plasmid pRK5 HA-TPTE-(215–551), a TPTE fragment (residues 215–551) was amplified by PCR from pCDNA3 HA-TPTE encoding the full-length human TPTE (31Chen H. Rossier C.

The chimeras HA-PTEN-TPTE (PTEN-(1–185)/TPTE-(405–551)), HA-TPTE-PTEN (TPTE-(215–404)/PTEN-(186–403)), HA-TP2 (TPTE-(215–539)/PTEN-(350–403)), HA-TP3 (TPTE-(215–551)/PTEN-(369–403)), and HA-TP4 (TPTE-(215–551)/PTEN-(376–403)) were constructed by PCR using primers that were complementary to the fused regions of PTEN and TPTE. The chimeras HA-TPTE-ITKV (TPTE-(215–551)/PTEN-(400–403)) and TPTE-TKV (TPTE-(215–551)/PTEN-(401–403)) were constructed by PCR using primers that were complementary to the last TPTE residues plus the PTEN-ITKV or TKV N-terminal residues, followed by the PTEN stop codon. All the chimeras were tagged at their N terminus with the HA epitope, and their identity was verified by DNA sequencing. The plasmids pRK5 HA kinase/MAST205 (residues 430–741, ETD...

The nucleotide sequences of all primers used in the construction of plasmids and mutagenesis are available upon request. The anti-HA monoclonal antibody (mAb) was 12CA5, and the anti-c-Myc (A-14) polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cell Culture, Transfection, Cell Lysis, and [35S]Methionine Labeling of Proteins—COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 mm Na4P2O7). The cell lysates were centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatants were used for GST pull-down assays, co-immunoprecipitation, or immunoprecipitation as indicated. For [35S]methionine pulse-chase experiments, transfected COS-7 cells were incubated for 1 h in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and cells were then labeled for 4 h with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml), followed by a pulse of different times in nonradioactive medium supplemented with an excess of cold methionine (1 mm). GST Fusion Proteins, GST Pull-down, Immunoprecipitation, and Co-immunoprecipitation—The GST fusion proteins containing the different PDZ domains were expressed in bacteria and purified with glutathione-Sepharose using standard procedures. For GST pull-down experiments, COS-7 cells transfected with the expression plasmids encoding HA-tagged recombinant proteins were lysed as indicated above, and 0.3–0.5 mg of the cell lysates were incubated for 2 h on ice with 3 μg of the GST fusion proteins, followed by the addition of glutathione-Sepharose beads and further incubation for 2 h under constant shaking. Samples were washed four times with HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% glycerol), resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions, and analyzed by immunoblot with the anti-HA 12CA5 mAb. For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, COS-7 cells were separately transfected with pRK5 HA-PTEN, wild type or mutations, and with pCMV Myc-MAGI-2. 0.3–0.5 mg of cell lysates from each type of transfected cell was mixed in pairwise combinations and incubated for 2 h on ice, followed by further incubation (16 h, 4 °C) in the presence of the anti-Myc antibody. Protein A-Sepharose was then added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, under constant shaking. Samples were washed and processed for immunoblot as for the GST pull-down assays. For immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled HA-PTEN proteins, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA 12CA5 mAb and protein A-Sepharose, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis, autoradiography, and quantitative analysis using a PhosphorImager. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EGY48 (MATα, trp1, his3, ura3, LEU2::LexA-op6-LEU2) was transformed with the lacZ reporter plasmid pMW107 (URA3 marker, LexA-op4-lacZ) together with pairwise combinations of the pEG202 PTEN (HIS3 marker) and the pJG4-5 PDZ (TRP1 marker) plasmids, and co-transformants were selected by plating on supplemental medium lacking Ura, His, and Trp (selective medium). Semi-quantitative yeast two-hybrid experiments were performed for each combination of pEG202 and pJG4-5 plasmids. As a control, the empty pEG202 vector was co-transformed with each pJG4-5 PDZ plasmid. Three independent co-transformant colonies were used to inoculate separately 3 ml of selective medium supplemented with 2% dextrose; after overnight growth, the cultures were diluted (1:25) in 5 ml of fresh selective medium supplemented with 2% galactose plus 1% raffinose and incubated for an additional 3–4 h to reach an A600 of 0.5–0.8. Cultures (0.1–1 ml) were collected by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in 0.8 ml of buffer Z (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Cells were lysed by adding 50 μl of CHCl3 plus 50 μl of 0.1% SDS and incubated in the presence of the β-galactosidase substrate, o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (4 mg/ml in buffer Z; 160 μl per sample), for 15 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding 0.4 ml of 1 m Na2CO3. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside hydrolysis was measured by absorbance at 420 nm. The cell density of the cultures was measured, before cell lysis, from separate aliquots by absorbance at 600 nm. The arbitrary units of β-galactosidase activity were calculated from the formula A420/A600 × volume of culture (ml) × time (min). In Vitro Kinase Assays—COS-7 cells transfected with the expression plasmids pRK5 HA kinase/MAST3, HA kinase/SAST, HA kinase/MAST205, or HA kinase + PDZ/MAST205 were lysed in lysis buffer. The cell lysates were centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatants were incubated for 4 h on ice in the presence of the anti-HA 12CA5 mAb. Protein A-Sepharose was then added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, under constant shaking. Samples were first washed three times with HNTG buffer and then with kinase reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol). The immune complexes were mixed with the GST-PTEN fusion proteins previously expressed in bacteria and purified with glutathione-Sepharose using standard procedures. The mixture was washed with kinase reaction buffer and then resuspended in 50 μl of the same buffer supplemented with 5 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Samples were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C, heated to 90 °C for 5 min in SDS sample buffer, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. PTEN Binds to Multiple PDZ Domains—PTEN possesses at its C terminus a functional PDZ domain-binding motif (Thr401-Lys402-Val403-COOH; TKV) that binds specific PDZ domains from MAGI-1/2/3, hDlg, and MAST205 (12Adey N.B.

Cowan N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7625-7635Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 37Lumeng C. Phelps S. Crawford G.E. Walden P.D. Barald K. Chamberlain J.S. Nat.

Masuko N. Koci M. Ushio Y. Saya H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As shown by GST pull-down assays (Fig. 1A), the PDZ domains from SAST and MAST3 also bind to HA-tagged PTEN, whereas the PDZ domain from MAST4 or the PDZ-2 domain from pDlg do not. Yeast two-hybrid analysis was also performed to test the interaction of PTEN wild type and V403A mutation with the distinct PDZ domains. PTEN wild type bound to the PDZ domains of MAGI-2, MAGI-3, MAST205, MAST3, and SAST, but not to the PDZ domain of MAST4. The V403A mutation, within the PDZ-binding motif, did not bind to any PDZ domain (Table I). Thus, multiple PDZ domains specifically interact with the tumor suppressor PTEN. To compare the recognition of the TKV PTEN motif by some of its counterpart PDZ domains (PDZ-2/MAGI-2, PDZ-2/hDlg, and PDZ/MAST205), C-terminal truncations were generated on the background of the HA-PTEN recombinant protein, and the binding of the truncated proteins was tested by pull-down assays using GST-PDZ-2/MAGI-2, GST-PDZ-2/hDlg, or GST-PDZ/MAST205 recombinant fusion proteins, as above (Fig. 2). Progressive amino acid deletions within the TKV motif differentially affected the recognition by the distinct PDZ domains. Thus, GST-PDZ-2/MAGI-2 did not bind to PTEN-(1–400), -(1–401), or -(1–402), whereas PDZ-2/hDlg and PDZ/MAST205 bound to PTEN-(1–400) but not to PTEN-(1–401) or -(1–402), indicating that certain C-terminal PTEN truncations are able to interact with some PDZ domains (Fig. 2, lanes 4–6). Moreover, individual alanine substitution of residues within the PTEN PDZ-binding motif affected differentially the binding of the distinct PDZ domains. The mutation T401A bound to PDZ-2/MAGI-2 and PDZ/MAST205 but not to the PDZ-2/hDlg; the mutation K402A had no effect on the association; and the mutation V403A inhibited the association of the three PDZ domains (Fig. 2, lanes 7–9). Most interestingly, the mutation K402W also abrogated binding to the PDZ domains from MAGI-2, MAGI-3, hDlg, and MAST205 (Fig. 2, lane 12). The inhibitory effect of the K402W mutation was also observed when the binding to the full-length Myc-MAGI-2 was tested by co-immunoprecipitation (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that the C-terminal motif of PTEN is important in the definition and specificity of the interaction with different PDZ domains, and these results suggest a distinct permissiveness of the PTEN PDZ-binding motif for recognition of specific PDZ domains from MAGI-2, hDlg, and MAST205.Table ISemi-quantitative yeast two-hybrid analysis of PTEN interaction with PDZ domainsPDZ-2/MAGI-2PDZ-2/MAGI-3PDZ/MAST205PDZ/MAST3PDZ/MAST4PDZ/SASTunitsaArbitrary units of β-galactosidase activity (×103) are shown as the mean ± S.D. of at least three separate experiments.

COS-7 cells were transfected with pRK5 alone (vector) or pRK5 HA-PTEN wild type (w.t.) or different mutations, as indicated. Equal amounts of cellular lysates (0.3 mg) were subjected to pull-down with equivalent amounts (3 μg) of GST-PDZ-2/MAGI-2, GST-PDZ-2/MAGI-3, GST-PDZ-2/hDlg, or GST-PDZ/MAST205, as indicated. The presence of HA-PTEN proteins in enriched pull-down pellets and in total lysates (40 μg) was analyzed by immunoblot using anti-HA mAb. All experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results, and a representative experiment is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The PTEN C-terminal Tail Contains Specific Recognition Determinants for Distinct PDZ Domains—The PTEN-related protein TPTE lacks a region similar to the PTEN C-terminal tail and does not possess a C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif (31Chen H.

As a consequence, TPTE does not bind PDZ domains (Fig. 4A, lane 3). To further investigate the molecular requirements of PTEN for PDZ domain binding, deletion PTEN mutants and chimeras containing distinct domains of PTEN and TPTE were engineered with an N-terminal HA epitope (Fig. 3A) and tested for binding. The chimera containing the PTP domain of TPTE followed by the C2 domain and the C-terminal tail of PTEN (TPTE-(215–404)/PTEN-(186–403) (TPTE-PTEN)) bound to PDZ-2/MAGI-2, PDZ-2/hDlg, or PDZ/MAST205, whereas the chimera containing the PTP domain of PTEN followed by the C2 domain of TPTE (PTEN-(1–185)/TPTE-(405–551) (PTEN-TPTE)) did not bind to any of these three PDZ domains (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 4, respectively; and data not shown). Furthermore, a PTEN mutation lacking the C2 domain but retaining the C-terminal tail (PTEN-(Δ189–349) (PTEN ΔC2)) bound to PDZ-2/MAGI-2, PDZ-2/hDlg, and PDZ/MAST205 as PTEN wild type did (Fig. 4B, lane 3; and data not shown). Most interestingly, chimeras containing the PTP and C2 domains of TPTE, followed by the ITKV or the TKV C-terminal PTEN residues (TPTE-(215–551)/PTEN-(400–403) and TPTE-(215–551)/PTEN-(401–403)) only bound to PDZ/MAST205 (Fig. 4C, lanes 3 and 4). These results demonstrate that both the PTP and the C2 domains of PTEN are dispensable for PTEN-PDZ domain interaction, and these results suggest the existence of molecular determinants within the PTEN C-terminal tail, in addition to the ITKV C-terminal motif, necessary for recognition of specific PDZ domains.

https://openalex.org/W1993336164,"Multiple genetic alterations occur in melanoma, a lethal skin malignancy of increasing incidence. These include mutations that activate Ras and two of its effector cascades, Raf and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Induction of Ras and Raf can be caused by active N-Ras and B-Raf mutants as well as by gene amplification. Activation of PI3K pathway components occurs by PTEN loss and by AKT3 amplification. Melanomas also commonly show impairment of the p16(INK4A)-CDK4-Rb and ARF-HDM2-p53 tumor suppressor pathways. CDKN2A mutations can produce p16(INK4A) and ARF protein loss. Rb bypass can also occur through activating CDK4 mutations as well as by CDK4 amplification. In addition to ARF deletion, p53 pathway disruption can result from dominant negative TP53 mutations. TERT amplification also occurs in melanoma. The extent to which these mutations can induce human melanocytic neoplasia is unknown. Here we characterize pathways sufficient to generate human melanocytic neoplasia and show that genetically altered human tissue facilitates functional analysis of mutations observed in human tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2032141866,"Required for the assembly and maintenance of eukaryotic cilia and flagella, intraflagellar transport (IFT) consists of the bidirectional movement of large protein particles between the base and the distal tip of the organelle. Anterograde movement of particles away from the cell body is mediated by kinesin-2, whereas retrograde movement away from the flagellar tip is powered by cytoplasmic dynein 1b/2. IFT particles contain multiple copies of two distinct protein complexes, A and B, which contain at least 6 and 11 protein subunits, respectively. In this study, we have used increased ionic strength to remove four peripheral subunits from the IFT complex B of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, revealing a 500-kDa core that contains IFT88, IFT81, IFT74/72, IFT52, IFT46, and IFT27. This result demonstrates that the complex B subunits, IFT172, IFT80, IFT57, and IFT20 are not required for the core subunits to stay associated. Chemical cross-linking of the complex B core resulted in multiple IFT81-74/72 products. Yeast-based two-hybrid and three-hybrid analyses were then used to show that IFT81 and IFT74/72 directly interact to form a higher order oligomer consistent with a tetrameric complex. Similar analysis of the vertebrate IFT81 and IFT74/72 homologues revealed that this interaction has been evolutionarily conserved. We hypothesize that these proteins form a tetrameric complex, (IFT81)2(IFT74/72)2, which serves as a scaffold for the formation of the intact IFT complex B.

Yeast-based two-hybrid and three-hybrid analyses were then used to show that IFT81 and IFT74/72 directly interact to form a higher order oligomer consistent with a tetrameric complex. Similar analysis of the vertebrate IFT81 and IFT74/72 homologues revealed that this interaction has been evolutionarily conserved. We hypothesize that these proteins form a tetrameric complex, (IFT81)2(IFT74/72)2, which serves as a scaffold for the formation of the intact IFT complex B. Eukaryotic cilia and flagella are specialized organelles found at the periphery of cells of diverse organisms. These cellular appendages have been adapted for multiple uses such as bulk fluid movement, cellular motility, and sensing extracellular signals (1Bray D. Cell Movements: From Molecules to Motility.

The significance of these organelles in human health is becoming increasingly obvious as the list of diseases associated with cilia and flagella continues to expand.

Although the functions of cilia and flagella have evolved considerably, all of these organelles appear to be assembled via the same ancient process known as intraflagellar transport or IFT 1The abbreviations used are: IFT, intraflagellar transport; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; DFDNB, 1,5-diflouro-2,4-dinitrobenzene; DMA, dimethyl adipimidate; BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome; HA, hemagglutinin; BD, DNA-binding domain; AD, DNA activation domain; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography.

Biol. 2003; 19: 423-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). IFT is an intracellular, bidirectional movement of protein particles along the length of cilia and flagella (14Kozminski K.G.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 993-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), whereas retrograde transport of particles to the cell body is driven by cytoplasmic dynein-1b/2 (18Pazour G.J. Dickert B.L. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 19Porter M.E. Bower R. Knott J.A. Byrd P. Dentler W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 693-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The IFT particles are composed of at least 17 proteins that form two distinct complexes known as A and B (17Cole D.G. Diener D.R.

A. 1997; 94: 4457-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Complex A contains six subunits ranging from 43 to 144 kDa, whereas complex B contains at least 11 subunits ranging from 20 to 172 kDa (12Cole D.G. Traffic. 2003; 4: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The IFT motors and particle proteins are well conserved in ciliated organisms (13Scholey J.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 423-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, defects in the anterograde motor, kinesin-2, result in reduced delivery of axonemal building blocks and either shortened or absent flagella (15Kozminski K.G. Beech P.L.

Mutations that affect specific Chlamydomonas IFT particle proteins also result in flagellar assembly phenotypes. For example, deletion of the complex B genes, IFT88 (4Pazour G.J. Dickert B.L. Vucica Y. Seeley E.S. Rosenbaum J.L. Witman G.B. Cole D.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar) and IFT52 (25Brazelton J.B. Amundsen C.D. Silflow C.D.

Miller M.S. Geimer S. Leitch J.M. Rosenbaum J.L. Cole D.G. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 262-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). As in Chlamydomonas, IFT mutants in other ciliated organisms are also characterized by defects in ciliary assembly (13Scholey J.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 423-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Whereas functional studies of IFT have progressed rapidly, little is known about the structure of the IFT particles and complexes. Sequence analysis does reveal that many of the IFT particle proteins contain sequence motifs that are predicted to form protein-protein binding domains (12Cole D.G. Traffic. 2003; 4: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These domains include tetratricopeptide repeats (28Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), WD-40 repeats (29Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar), coiled-coil domains (30Adamson J.G. Zhou N.E. Hodges R.S. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1993; 4: 428-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and novel degenerate repeats termed WAA repeats found only in IFT particle proteins (27Pedersen L.B. Miller M.S. Geimer S. Leitch J.M. Rosenbaum J.L. Cole D.G. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 262-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Some of these domains, such as tetratricopeptide and WD repeats, are well known for mediating transient protein-protein interactions, whereas coiled-coil domains typically mediate more stable or long term interactions. Transient protein-protein interactions would probably be useful in the binding, transport, and release of specific IFT cargoes, such as radial spoke complexes (31Qin H. Diener D.R. Geimer S. Cole D.G. Rosenbaum J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Transient interactions might also play a role in the assembly, disassembly, and rearrangement of the large IFT particles that occur at the base and tip of the organelle (32Iomini C. Babaev-Khaimov V. Sassaroli M. Piperno G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). More stable interactions such as those generated by coiled-coils could serve to keep the smaller units such as complexes A and B intact. Here we report on the cloning of the Chlamydomonas IFT81 gene, which encodes a protein predicted to form extensive coiled-coils (33Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3471) Google Scholar). IFT81 is shown to be an integral component of a salt-stable fraction of complex B, which also contains IFT88, IFT74, IFT72, IFT52, IFT46, and IFT27 and is now termed the complex B core. IFT74 and IFT72 are both derived from the same gene and are often referred to as IFT74/72 (31Qin H. Diener D.R. Geimer S. Cole D.G. Rosenbaum J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). With increased ionic strength, IFT172, IFT80, IFT57, and IFT20 completely dissociate from complex B and appear to be independent of each other. To investigate potential protein-protein interactions within the complex B core, a combination of chemical cross-linking, immunoprecipitation, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was utilized. With this approach, we identified cross-linked products that contained only IFT81 and IFT74/72. Subsequent yeast-based two-hybrid analysis suggested that IFT81 interacts directly with IFT74/72 through a predicted coiled-coil domain. IFT81 was also found to homodimerize in the yeast two-hybrid system. Last, yeast-based three-hybrid analysis supports the hypothesis that IFT81 and IFT74/72 form a higher order oligomer that is consistent with the tetrameric complex (IFT81)2(IFT74/72)2. Strains and Reagents—C. reinhardtii strains CC-124, CC-125, and fla2ts (CC-1390) were obtained from the Chlamydomonas Center (available on the World Wide Web at www.chlamy.org/) and maintained on solid TAP medium (34Gorman D.S. Levine R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1665-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar) under continuous light. To harvest flagella, cells were grown in liquid TAP medium under a 16:8 light/dark cycle, bubbling continuously with air. Cloning of IFT81—A Chlamydomonas cDNA expression library (generously provided by P. Lefebvre) was screened using a set of four anti-IFT81 monoclonal antibodies, 81.1–81.4 (17Cole D.G. Diener D.R. Himelblau A.L. Beech P.L. Fuster J.C. Rosenbaum J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 993-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), as directed by the manufacturer (Stratagene). One clone, p10C, cross-reacted with three of the four antibodies (all but 81.2) and was found to contain the 3′-end 1018 nucleotides of the IFT81 cDNA. The initial and largest open reading frame of p10C encoded the carboxyl-terminal 129 amino acids (14.0 kDa) of the IFT81 protein. In a separate experiment, sucrose density gradient-purified IFT proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as described previously (17Cole D.G. Diener D.R. Himelblau A.L. Beech P.L. Fuster J.C. Rosenbaum J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 993-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The IFT81 protein band was excised from the two-dimensional gel, digested with trypsin, and fractionated by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Edman degradation of two isolated tryptic peptides yielded the following sequences: tr-16, YHMLHCQLHITDQNIK; tr-18, NAEGGGSGAVFSEE. The former peptide was encoded by p10C, whereas the latter was used as a template to design degenerate PCR primers for amplification of additional IFT81 cDNA sequence. This approach allowed us to identify an additional 516 bp of cDNA sequence. In order to complete the sequencing of the IFT81 cDNA, additional cDNA clones were obtained by screening the cDNA library. The IFT81 cDNA sequence was later verified with a full-length cDNA clone (accession number AV630357) (35Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Sato S. Fukuzawa H. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 36Asamizu E. Miura K. Kucho K. Inoue Y. Fukuzawa H. Ohyama K. Nakamura Y. Tabata S. DNA Res. 2000; 7: 305-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In order to sequence the IFT81 gene, p10C was used to probe a Chlamydomonas genomic BAC library (Clemson University Genomics Institute, Clemson, SC) (available on the World Wide Web at www.genome.clemson.edu/). Three BAC clones containing the IFT81 gene were verified by PCR, and one was chosen for sequencing to identify the intron/exon structure. Sequencing primers are available upon request. Northern Analysis—CC-124 gametes were deflagellated by pH shock, and total RNA was isolated and stored as described previously (27Pedersen L.B. Miller M.S. Geimer S. Leitch J.M. Rosenbaum J.L. Cole D.G. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 262-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For electrophoresis, total RNA was fractionated on 1.2% formaldehyde agarose gels and then transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-N; Amersham Biosciences) and probed with 32P-labeled probes according to Ref. 37Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.37-7.52Google Scholar. Ribosomal RNA stained with ethidium bromide was used as the loading control. Flagellar Isolation—Flagella were isolated from Chlamydomonas by pH shock as described by Witman et al. (38Witman G.B. Carlson K. Berliner J. Rosenbaum J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1972; 54: 507-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) with minor modifications as follows. Cells (16–32 liters) were harvested using a Pellicon tangential flow cell concentrator (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) to a volume of 1–2 liters. Cells were then collected by centrifugation at 900 × g for 2 min at 25 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended into 4–6 liters of fresh M1 medium (39Sager R. Granick S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1953; 56: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and placed under light with continuous air bubbling until nearly all cells were flagellated. Flagellated cells were concentrated as described above, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 500 ml of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2; 50% sucrose was added to a final concentration of 5% 10 min prior to deflagellation. The addition of 5% sucrose increased the yield of IFT proteins present in the excised flagella. To initiate deflagellation, 0.50 m acetic acid was added to lower the pH of vigorously stirred cells to 4.6. After 30 s, deflagellation was confirmed using phase-contrast microscopy, and the suspension was quickly neutralized to a pH of 7.2 using 0.50 m KOH; the cell suspension was placed immediately on ice. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C or on ice. Protease inhibitors were added to the following final concentrations: 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.7 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5.0 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. After 10 min of cooling, most of the cell bodies were removed by centrifugation at 900 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was layered over 13 ml of 30% sucrose cushions in 50-ml conical tubes and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in a swinging bucket rotor. Flagellar supernatants were pooled and further centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. Flagellar pellets were resuspended in HMEK buffer (10 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 25 mm KCl, pH 7.2) with protease inhibitors present and then centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 16,100 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and flagellar pellets were stored indefinitely at –80 °C. Preparation and Sizing of the Complex B Core—Flagellar matrix samples were prepared by resuspension of frozen flagellar pellets in HMEK buffer + 300 mm NaCl (HMEK-300) with protease inhibitors. Flagella were mechanically sheared by pipetting at least 80 times with a 200-μl pipettor. Axonemal and insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 10 min at 4 °C; the supernatant was considered to be the flagellar matrix consisting primarily of soluble flagellar proteins. Sucrose density gradients (10–25%) were made in 14 × 89-mm tubes with solutions containing HMEK-300. The flagellar matrix was centrifuged through the gradients for 16 h at 37,000 rpm using an SW41-Ti rotor (Beckman) at 5 °C. Gradient fractions (∼525 μl) were collected from the bottom using capillary tubing and a peristaltic pump with a flow rate of 1.05 ml/min. Although complex B partially dissociated under these gradient conditions, a core group of complex B subunits including IFT88, IFT81, IFT74, IFT72, IFT52, IFT46, and IFT27, remained together with a sedimentation value of 11.0 S. Sedimentation standards used were as follows: thyroglobulin, 19.3 S, catalase, 11.3 S, bovine serum albumin, 4.65 S, ovalbumin, 3.5 S, and bovine heart cytochrome c, 1.86 S. In order to determine the diffusion coefficient for the complex B core, the ∼11 S sucrose gradient fractions were pooled and loaded onto an FPLC 1.6 × 60-cm Sephacryl S-300 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column equilibrated in HMEK-300. This was repeated with three separate preparations of 11 S complex B core. The complex B core proteins co-eluted at an average peak volume of 40.5 ml, corresponding to a diffusion coefficient of 1.80 × 10–7 cm2 s–1. Gel filtration standards used included thyroglobulin (2.6 × 10–7 cm2 s–1), apoferrition (3.24 × 10–7 cm2 s–1), alcohol dehydrogenase (4.76 × 10–7 cm2 s–1), and bovine serum albumin (6.3 × 10–7 cm2 s–1). The column bed and void volumes were determined with blue dextran and ATP, respectively. The apparent molecular mass of the complex B core were determined with the Svedberg equation (40Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry Part II: Techniques for the Study of Biological Structure and Function. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco, CA1980: 605-607Google Scholar),M=SRT/D(1−vρ)eq.1 where R is the gas constant, T is temperature in Kelvin, ν is the partial specific volume of the protein, ρ is the solution density, and S and D are the experimentally derived sedimentation and diffusion coefficients, respectively. The partial specific volume was assumed to be 0.72 cm3/g, and the solution density was assumed to be 1.00 g/cm3. Preparation of Anti-IFT81 Resin—Three monoclonal antibodies raised against IFT81, 81.1, 81.3, and 81.4 (17Cole D.G. Diener D.R. Himelblau A.L. Beech P.L. Fuster J.C. Rosenbaum J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 993-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), were partially purified from mouse ascites fluid using CM-Affi-Gel Blue (Bio-Rad) following the recommended procedures. Antibodies were further purified using protein G-conjugated Sepharose beads (Sigma) as described by Harlow and Lane (41Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 70-76Google Scholar). Protein G-purified antibodies were concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml using Centriprep-30 spin columns (Amicon) preincubated with 5% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline and rinsed thoroughly with deionized water just prior to use. Concentrated antibodies were dialyzed against conjugation buffer containing 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.4, 0.5 m NaCl and then conjugated to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The anti-IFT81 resin was then blocked using 1.0 m ethanolamine, pH 8.0, for 2 h at room temperature. Chemical Cross-linking—Sucrose gradient fractions enriched in the complex B core were pooled and divided into equal aliquots. Gradient fractions were treated with the chemical cross-linkers 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DFDNB; Pierce) or dimethyl adipimidate (DMA; Pierce) at final concentrations of 0.0, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mm for 10 min on ice before being quenched with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The complex B core was then bound to anti-IFT81 antibody resin. The supernatant was removed, and the resin was washed three times with 15 bed volumes of HMEK-300. The proteins were eluted from the resin by boiling in an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer. Immunoprecipitates were separated on 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, or 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) and visualized with Coomassie Blue. Protein bands containing cross-linked products were excised from the gels, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Resulting peptide masses were compared with expected IFT81 and IFT74/72 peptides using Protein Prospector (43Clauser K.R. Baker P.R. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Yeast-based Two- and Three-hybrid Analysis—Hybrizap 2.1 yeast two-hybrid vectors and the YRG-2 yeast strain were obtained from Stratagene, whereas the yeast three-hybrid pBridge vector was obtained from BD Biosciences. All IFT81 constructs for this analysis were PCR-amplified and subcloned using a full-length cDNA clone, LCL077g05_r (Accession number AV630357; Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Kisarazu, Chiba, Japan) (35Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Sato S. Fukuzawa H. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 36Asamizu E. Miura K. Kucho K. Inoue Y. Fukuzawa H. Ohyama K. Nakamura Y. Tabata S. DNA Res. 2000; 7: 305-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), as a template. The IFT81 constructs used for two-hybrid and three-hybrid analyses include 81F (amino acids 1–683), 81CC12 (amino acids 125–683), 81N (amino acids 1–128), 81CC1 (amino acids 125–454), 81CC2 (amino acids 446–632), and 81C (amino acids 625–683). In brief, all PCR products of IFT81 were first ligated into TOPO Zero-Blunt pcr4 vectors according to the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Each cDNA insert was excised by restriction digest and ligated into the two-hybrid vectors, pAD-GAL4–2.1 and pBD-GAL4-Cam, using T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen) according to standard procedures. The cloning of the IFT74/72-Mid construct containing amino acids 210–397 was previously described (31Qin H. Diener D.R. Geimer S. Cole D.G. Rosenbaum J.L. J.

Total Chlamydomonas RNA was isolated from strain CC-124 30 min after deflagellation as previously described (27Pedersen L.B. Miller M.S. Geimer S. Leitch J.M. Rosenbaum J.L. Cole D.G. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 262-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the ThermoScript reverse transcription-PCR system (Invitrogen). Second strand synthesis was carried out using the following IFT74/72 gene-specific primers: upper primer, 5′-ATGGACAGGCCCTCTAGCCGCG-3′; lower primer, 5′-TACACCACGTTCTTGAC-3′. The resulting full-length IFT74/72 cDNA was cloned into the TOPO Zero-Blunt pcr4 vector and used as a template to PCR-amplify IFT74/72 cDNA to prepare the AD and BD two-hybrid constructs as described above for IFT81. The resulting IFT74/72 constructs are 74F (amino acids 1–641), 74N (amino acids 1–137), 74CC1 (amino acids 137–457), 74NCC1 (amino acids 1–457), 74MID (amino acids 210–610), and 74CC2 (amino acids 424–563). Three-hybrid analysis utilized the pBridge vector (BD Biosciences), which contains two multiple cloning sites, MCS-1 and MCS-2. MCS-1 generates a DNA-binding domain (BD) fusion protein under the regulation of the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter, whereas MCS-2 is responsible for expression of a second protein under the regulation of the MET25 promoter. The full-length 74F was ligated into the pBridge MCS-1 using the EcoRI and SalI restriction sites, whereas 81F was ligated into MCS-2 using the NotI and BglII restriction sites producing the pBri-74F-81F plasmid. As a control, 74F was ligated into MCS-1 without placing any inserts into MCS-2 producing the plasmid, pBri-74F. All yeast media were made according to the Hybrizap 2.1 manual (Stratagene). Yeast transformations were essentially performed as described by Gietz and Woods (44Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2077) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast were grown on solid YAPD (20 g/liter Difco peptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 20 g/liter agar, 40 mg/liter adenine sulfate, 2% (v/v) glucose, pH 5.8) medium for 2–3 days. Cells (25 μl/transformation) were transferred to 1.0 ml of sterile water and centrifuged for 5 s at 16,000 × g. Cell pellets were resuspended with 1.0 ml of sterile 100 mm LiOAc at 30 °C and incubated for 5 min at 30 °C. Cells were split into equal aliquots representing the number of transformations and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 s. The supernatant was removed, and the following reagents were added to the cell pellet in order, 240 μl of polyethylene glycol 3350 (50% w/v, filter-sterilized), 36 μl of 1.0 m LiOAc, 60 μl of sheared salmon sperm (2.0 mg/ml, boiled 5 min, and set on ice for at least 30–60 s), 3 μl of plasmid DNA (0.2–1 μg/μl). Each sample was vortexed vigorously for 3 min and then incubated for 20 min at 42 °C. Cells were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 s and then gently resuspended in 200 μl of sterile water with wide bore pipette tips and plated onto appropriate dropout media. Yeast whole cell lysates were prepared using the yeast protein extraction reagent, YPER (Pierce), and analyzed by Western blotting to confirm fusion protein expression. Anti-Gal4-AD a"

We have determined the crystal structures of the HCV polymerase complexed with two indole-based allosteric inhibitors at 2.3- and 2.4-Å resolution. The structures show that these inhibitors bind to a site on the surface of the thumb domain. A cyclohexyl and phenyl ring substituents, bridged by an indole moiety, fill two closely spaced pockets, whereas a carboxylate substituent forms a salt bridge with an exposed arginine side chain. Interestingly, in the apoenzyme, the inhibitor binding site is occupied by a small α-helix at the tip of the N-terminal loop that connects the fingers and thumb domains. Thus, these molecules inhibit the enzyme by preventing formation of intramolecular contacts between these two domains and consequently precluding their coordinated movements during RNA synthesis. Our structures identify a novel mechanism by which a new class of allosteric inhibitors inhibits the HCV polymerase and open the way to the development of novel antiviral agents against this clinically relevant human pathogen.

It is estimated that more than 170 million people worldwide are infected by this virus (3Cohen J. Science. 1999; 285: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). There is no vaccine available for HCV, and the current therapy, based on interferon and ribavirin, is poorly tolerated and of limited efficacy. Therefore, there are intense research efforts toward the development of new drugs targeting essential HCV enzymes and in particular the polymerase. The HCV nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B) is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) responsible for replication of the viral genome. NS5B can initiate RNA synthesis by two different mechanisms: primer-independent initiation from the 3′ terminus of the viral genome, also known as de novo initiation (4Zhong W. Uss A.S. Ferrari E.

The three-dimensional structures of soluble forms of the HCV polymerase genotype 1b, ΔC21 and ΔC55, lacking the last 21 and 55 C-terminal residues, respectively, have been reported (8Ago H. Adachi T.

These structures revealed a classical “right hand” shape formed by the palm, thumb, and fingers domains as initially defined in the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (11Ollis D.L. Brick P. Hamlin R. Xuong N.G. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) and showed the presence of an extension in the fingers, the so-called fingertip subdomain, containing two loops, Λ1 and Λ2 (secondary structure nomenclature according to Ref. 9Bressanelli S.

As a result, the polymerase has a relatively closed and spherical appearance, and the active site cavity, to which the RNA template and the NTP substrates have access via two positively charged tunnels, is completely encircled.

Crystal structures of NS5B bound to a short RNA template or to NTPs have also been solved (20O'Farrell D. Trowbridge R. Rowlands D. Jager J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 21Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Rey F.A. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3482-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in all these structures, ligand binding occurred without rearrangements in the enzyme domains. Moreover, the structure of the NS5B-GTP complex showed that, in addition to the active site, GTP can also bind to an exposed site on the thumb domain in close proximity to the tip of the fingertip Λ1 loop (21Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Rey F.A. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3482-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). This external GTP site, 30 Å away from the polymerase catalytic center, was proposed to exert a regulatory activity by modulating the interactions between the fingers and thumb domains during RNA synthesis. Recently, the structure of the HCV polymerase genotype 2a (this enzyme shares 70% sequence identity with the 1b polymerase) was reported (22Biswal B.K. Cherney M.M. Wang M. Chan L. Yannopoulos C.G. Bilimoria D. Nicolas O. Bedard J. James M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18202-18210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This study revealed two conformations of the enzyme: closed, similar to the apo1b polymerase structure, and a more opened structure. Interestingly, in the opened conformation the tip of the fingertip Λ1 loop, which is α-helical in the closed conformation of the polymerase, moved away from the thumb domain and adopted a β-hairpin-like structure. The discovery and characterization of a number of structurally diverse non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNIs) of the HCV polymerase have been reported (22Biswal B.K. Cherney M.M. Wang M. Chan L.

These molecules inhibited the polymerase at a stage preceding the elongation step and non-competitively with RNA template or NTPs (24Tomei L. Altamura S. Bartholomew L. Biroccio A. Ceccacci A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Despite these common features in the mechanism of inhibition, structural, genetic, and biochemical evidence suggest that HCV NNIs bind to different sites on the polymerase. Specifically, crystallographic studies indicate that inhibitors based on thiophene, phenylalanine, or dihydropyranone scaffolds bind in a hydrophobic cleft in the thumb domain near the C terminus of the polymerase and 10–15 Å from the external GTP site (21Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Rey F.A. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3482-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 22Biswal B.K. Cherney M.M. Wang M. Chan L. Yannopoulos C.G. Bilimoria D. Nicolas O.

Ekker A. Wang L. Thomson J.A. Dragovich P.S. Fuhrman S.A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7575-7581Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Conversely, a combination of genetic and biochemical data suggests that a second group of NNIs, comprising compounds based on the structurally related benzimidazole and indole core, binds at the exposed GTP site (24Tomei L. Altamura S. Bartholomew L. Biroccio A. Ceccacci A. Pacini L. Narjes F. Gennari N. Bisbocci M. Incitti I. Orsatti L. Harper S. Stansfield I. Rowley M. De Francesco R. Migliaccio G. J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In agreement with this hypothesis, resistance to these inhibitors arises through mutation of Pro-495, a residue involved in the interaction with the external GTP molecule, and enzyme binding and inhibition are antagonized by GTP (24Tomei L. Altamura S. Bartholomew L. Biroccio A. Ceccacci A. Pacini L. Narjes F. Gennari N. Bisbocci M. Incitti I. Orsatti L. Harper S. Stansfield I. Rowley M. De Francesco R. Migliaccio G. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 13225-13231Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Benzimidazole- and indole-derived NNIs have provided encouraging results as anti-HCV agents. In a recent study indole-based inhibitors were shown to be devoid of off-target activities and presented encouraging pharmacokinetic profiles in preclinical animal studies (27Harper S. Pacini B. Avolio S. Di Filippo M. Migliaccio G. Laufer R. De Francesco R. Rowley M. Narjes F. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 1314-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, a benzimidazole polymerase inhibitor has entered into Phase I/II clinical trials (28McHutchison J.G. Patel K. Hepatology. 2002; 36: S245-S252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we describe the crystal structures of the HCV polymerase in complex with two indole-derived NNIs. These structures reveal a novel inhibitory binding site in the polymerase and open the way to the design of new NNIs for treatment of HCV infection. Furthermore, our structures suggest a mechanism of inhibition, with the inhibitor displacing part of the fingertip loop anchoring the fingers domain to the thumb domain, which may also be relevant for the inhibition of other viral RdRps. Protein Expression and Purification—A variant of HCV NS5B (genotype 1b, strain BK) lacking 55 C-terminal residues (ΔC55) and a P495L point mutant (24Tomei L. Altamura S. Bartholomew L. Biroccio A.

Protein overexpression was performed by induction of mid-log phase BL21 DE3 E. coli cells with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 22 h at 18 °C in LB medium. Harvested bacteria were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2% β-octylglucoside, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and Complete™ EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets) and lysed with a cell disruptor (Costant System). Lysate was incubated with DNase I (5 units/ml) in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 and clarified by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was loaded onto a heparin column pre-equilibrated with buffer A-Hep (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2% β-octylglucoside, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT) at 4 °C, and the protein was eluted with a salt gradient in 700 mm NaCl. Protein fractions were pooled and diluted with the A-Hep buffer without NaCl to reach 150 mm NaCl and loaded onto an ion-exchange Resource S column pre-equilibrated in A-S buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2% β-octylglucoside, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm DTT). The column was washed in buffer with 300 mm NaCl, and the protein was subjected to a linear gradient from 300 mm to 1 m NaCl. The protein elutes at ∼500 mm NaCl. Fractions were loaded onto a Sephadex G75 gel filtration column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2% β-octylglucoside, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm DTT. The protein was analyzed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry and confirmed to be >95% pure, with an experimental mass of 59,555 Da (theoretical mass 59,561 Da). The full-length NS5B protein and the ΔC21 protein, a NS5B variant with the last 21 C-terminal residues deleted, were expressed and purified as described previously (29Tomei L. Vitale R.L. Incitti I.

Crystallization and Data Collection—NS5B-ΔC55 crystals were grown as described previously (9Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Roussel A. Incitti I. Vitale R.L. Mathieu M. De Francesco R. Rey F.A. Proc. Natl.

Inhibitor soakings were performed by transferring crystals in a solution containing 100 mm MES, pH 6.0, 14% polyethylene glycol 8,000, 14% 2-propanol, 10 mm DTT, 10 mm MnCl2, and 2.5 mm of compound 1 or 2. Soaking was performed for only 20–30 min as crystals had the tendency to crack ∼40–60 min after inhibitor addition. Crystals were then transferred for 1 min to a cryoprotectant solution containing 100 mm MES, pH 6.0, 14% polyethylene glycol 8,000, 14% 2-propanol, 18% 2-methyl-2,5-pentanediol, 10 mm DTT, 5 mm MnCl2, and 1.25 mm compound 1 or 2. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K from cryo-cooled crystals at the ID14-H1 beam-line at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). Data were processed with MOSFLM and scaled with SCALA (31Collaborative Computational project N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The two structures of the ΔC55 polymerase-inhibitor complexes were solved by the molecular replacement method with the program AMoRe from CCP4 (31Collaborative Computational project N.

No electron density was present for residues 22–35, 148–152, and 532–536, which were therefore excluded from the refinement. Both structures satisfy all the criteria set by the program PROCHECK (32Laskowsky R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and all amino acids lie in allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Inhibition of HCV Polymerase—The key pharmacophore elements of the allosteric inhibitors used in this study include a central scaffold of a 6,5-fused ring system, which proved to be optimal (27Harper S.

The only difference between the two inhibitors resides in the indole N-acetyl substituent. Both compounds inhibited the purified enzyme with IC50 values in the low nm range and subgenomic HCV RNA replication in the sub-μm range (Table I). Inhibition was independent of the form of recombinant polymerase used as both full-length and C-terminally truncated ΔC21 and ΔC55 were inhibited with similar IC50 values (for compound 2 the IC50 values for the full-length and ΔC21 enzymes were 22 and 100 nm, respectively).Table IPotency of compounds 1 and 2* Compound 1, 3-cyclohexyl-1-(2-morpholin-4-yl-2-oxoethyl)-2-phenyl-1H-indole-6-carboxylic acid; compound 2, 3-cyclohexyl-1-(2-{methyl[(1-methylpiperidin-3-yl)methyl]amino)-2-oxoethyl)-2-phenyl-1H-indole-6-carboxylic acid† N.A., not active up to 10 μm Open table in a new tab * Compound 1, 3-cyclohexyl-1-(2-morpholin-4-yl-2-oxoethyl)-2-phenyl-1H-indole-6-carboxylic acid; compound 2, 3-cyclohexyl-1-(2-{methyl[(1-methylpiperidin-3-yl)methyl]amino)-2-oxoethyl)-2-phenyl-1H-indole-6-carboxylic acid † N.A., not active up to 10 μm Inhibitor Binding and Polymerase Conformational Change— The crystal structures of the ΔC55 polymerase in complex with compound 1 (2.3-Å resolution) and compound 2 (2.4-Å resolution) were obtained by soaking procedures. In both cases, analysis of the initial electron density map showed clearly defined electron density for the inhibitor (supplemental Fig. 6). However, different from what was predicted (24Tomei L. Altamura S. Bartholomew L. Biroccio A. Ceccacci A. Pacini L. Narjes F. Gennari N. Bisbocci M. Incitti I. Orsatti L. Harper S. Stansfield I. Rowley M. De Francesco R. Migliaccio G. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 13225-13231Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), binding did not occur at the exposed GTP binding site but instead 8 Å from it in a site occupied in the apoenzyme by the small α-helix A at the tip of the fingertip Λ1 loop (Fig. 1). This loop anchors the fingers to the thumb in the apoenzyme and opens in the direction of the solvent, becoming partially disordered in the inhibitor-bound structures with no electron density present for residues 22–35 (Fig. 1). Electron density was also missing for residues 148–152, part of the fingertip Λ2 loop that is adjacent to the Λ1 loop and also connects the fingers and thumb (Fig. 1). This region is already flexible in the ΔC55 apostructure (9Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Roussel A. Incitti I. Vitale R.L. Mathieu M. De Francesco R. Rey F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13034-13039Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) but is completely disordered in the inhibited structures, presumably because of the lack of stabilization provided in the apoenzyme by the interaction between Λ2 Val-147 and Λ1 Met-36. Another consequence of the displacement of α-helix A and the resulting weaker interaction between the thumb and fingers is a slight opening of the polymerase. Indeed, when the palm and thumb domains of the inhibited structure and the apostructure are superimposed, we observed a rigid body rotation of the fingers of 2–4° in a clockwise direction with respect to the palm. Furthermore, the differences in Cα positions in the fingers domain varied between 0.5 and 2.1 Å (Fig. 1B). It cannot be excluded that the rearrangement of the polymerase domains may have been limited in the crystals by packing interactions and thus could be even larger in solution. Indeed, crystals could be soaked in the presence of the inhibitor only for a relatively short amount of time. An opening of the polymerase, following inhibitor binding, might prevent either the correct positioning of RNA and NTPs required for catalysis or the translocation of the template and product. Inhibitor-Enzyme Interactions—Despite having a different indole N-acetyl substituent (Table I) the two inhibitors bind almost identically to the polymerase (Fig. 2A). In fact only two carbon atoms of the N-acetyl substituent are in van der Waals contact distance with the backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of Leu-492 and Gly-493 (Fig. 2B), explaining the similar binding modes and IC50 values for the two molecules (Table I). The inhibitor-polymerase interaction is mainly hydrophobic. The only exception is a salt bridge formed by the carboxylate group of the inhibitor and the guanidinium group of Arg-503. Plausibly, Arg-503 and the proximal His-428 side chains create a positive electrostatic potential favorable for the binding of acidic ligands (Fig. 2B). The cyclohexyl and the phenyl ring substituents likely contribute to most of the binding energy by filling two closely spaced pockets of the binding site. The side chains of Leu-392, Ala-395, Thr-399, Ile-424, Leu-425, His-428, and Phe-429 form a deep pocket, filled almost completely by the cyclohexyl group of the inhibitor, whereas the Val-37, Leu-392, Ala-393, Ala-396, Leu-492, and Val-494 side chains form a narrower pocket occupied by the inhibitor phenyl ring (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, none of these residues changed conformation compared with the apoprotein. The indole core bridges the two groups and also contributes both in filling the pockets and in the interaction with the protein. One side of the indole moiety points toward the pocket interior and interacts with the Val-494 and Trp-500 side chains, whereas the other side makes van der Waals contacts with the exposed Pro-495 pyrrol ring on the external lower side of the pocket (Fig. 2B). The latter interaction likely explains the lack of inhibition by this class of compounds of the NS5B P495L point mutant (Table I) (24Tomei L. Altamura S. Bartholomew L. Biroccio A. Ceccacci A. Pacini L. Narjes F. Gennari N. Bisbocci M. Incitti I. Orsatti L. Harper S. Stansfield I. Rowley M. De Francesco R. Migliaccio G. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 13225-13231Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The structures suggest several ways to improve the potency of this class of inhibitors (Fig. 2B). In the direction perpendicular to the plane of the indole moiety the occupancy of the pocket is not complete, and slightly bulkier moieties may increase the contact area by approaching Val-494. Substituents inserted at the para-position of the phenyl ring could extend into a protein hydrophobic cleft (designated as “a” in Fig. 2B), significantly increasing the surface contact area. The N-acetamide substituent could be modified to form hydrogen bonds with the backbone oxygens of Leu-492 and Gly-493. Finally, a larger group could substitute for one of the carboxylate oxygens, so as to extend the inhibitor into a second hydrophobic region (designated as “b” in Fig. 2B), while keeping with the other oxygen the polar interaction with the side chain of Arg-503 (Fig. 2, A and B). In agreement with this hypothesis, a structurally related indole-scaffolded inhibitor, containing the same cyclohexyl and phenyl substituents and an additional elongated amide extension in this position, inhibits the NS5B polymerase with a subnanomolar IC50. 2S. Harper, unpublished data. Indole-based NNIs and Other Small Molecule Binding Sites—Comparison of the NS5B-GTP complex structure (21Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Rey F.A. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3482-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) with our structures shows that the binding sites for GTP and for the indole-based inhibitors are close in space but clearly distinct. The GTP molecule lies on a shallow surface in proximity to the fingertip α-helix A, whereas the inhibitor fills the pocket occupied in the apoenzyme by the same α-helix (Fig. 2, A and C). Moreover, GTP binding is not associated with any protein conformational change (21Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Rey F.A. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3482-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), whereas inhibitor binding requires a displacement of the α-helix A and part of the Λ1 loop (Fig. 2, C and D). However, GTP and inhibitors make some common interactions with polymerase atoms (Fig. 2, B and C). Both molecules are at van der Waals contact distances with Pro-495, although they lie on opposite sides of the pyrrol ring. Further, both molecules interact with the Arg-503 side chain; the GTP molecule establishes one water-mediated hydrogen bond, whereas the inhibitor forms a salt bridge via its carboxylate group (Fig. 2, B and C). Interestingly, in the NS5B-GTP complex the ribose moiety of GTP hydrogen bonds the guanidinium group of Arg-32 (Fig. 2C). This interaction may contribute to tightening the association of the fing"
https://openalex.org/W2021123893,"A mathematical model of glycolysis in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei was developed previously on the basis of all available enzyme kinetic data (Bakker, B. M., Michels, P. A. M., Opperdoes, F. R., and Westerhoff, H. V. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 3207–3215). The model predicted correctly the fluxes and cellular metabolite concentrations as measured in non-growing trypanosomes and the major contribution to the flux control exerted by the plasma membrane glucose transporter. Surprisingly, a large overcapacity was predicted for hexokinase (HXK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), and pyruvate kinase (PYK). Here, we present our further analysis of the control of glycolytic flux in bloodstream form T. brucei. First, the model was optimized and extended with recent information about the kinetics of enzymes and their activities as measured in lysates of in vitro cultured growing trypanosomes. Second, the concentrations of five glycolytic enzymes (HXK, PFK, phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase, and PYK) in trypanosomes were changed by RNA interference. The effects of the knockdown of these enzymes on the growth, activities, and levels of various enzymes and glycolytic flux were studied and compared with model predictions. Data thus obtained support the conclusion from the in silico analysis that HXK, PFK, and PYK are in excess, albeit less than predicted. Interestingly, depletion of PFK and enolase had an effect on the activity (but not, or to a lesser extent, expression) of some other glycolytic enzymes. Enzymes located both in the glycosomes (the peroxisome-like organelles harboring the first seven enzymes of the glycolytic pathway of trypanosomes) and in the cytosol were affected. These data suggest the existence of novel regulatory mechanisms operating in trypanosome glycolysis.

These data suggest the existence of novel regulatory mechanisms operating in trypanosome glycolysis. Trypanosomatid parasites (Trypanosoma and Leishmania) are responsible for serious diseases of mankind in tropical and subtropical countries worldwide. These diseases affect millions of people, and hundreds of millions are at risk of becoming infected. Unfortunately, available treatments are largely inadequate. Currently used drugs are inefficacious and toxic. There is a desperate need for new effective and safe drugs, particularly in view of the development and spreading of drug resistance (1.Barrett M.P.

Glycolysis plays an important role in the energy metabolism of these protozoan organisms, notably of Trypanosoma brucei when it lives in the blood of its mammalian host, causing a disease called sleeping sickness or human African trypanosomiasis in man and nagana in cattle (2.Michels P.A.M.

(2003) Kinetoplastid Biology and Disease http://www.kinetoplastids.com/content/2/1/11,Google Scholar). This bloodstream form of T. brucei is entirely dependent on the conversion of the blood sugar glucose into pyruvate for its ATP supply. Oxidative metabolism involving mitochondrial Krebs cycle enzymes and oxidative phosphorylation are largely repressed. Therefore, glycolysis has been perceived as a potentially good target for anti-trypanosome drugs. Moreover, the glycolytic pathway in trypanosomatids is organized in a unique manner: the majority of the glycolytic enzymes are sequestered inside peroxisome-like organelles, designated glycosomes (Fig. 1) (2.Michels P.A.M. Hannaert V. Bringaud F. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 482-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 3.Hannaert, V., Bringaud, F., Opperdoes, F. R., and Michels, P. A. M.

Our previous research has shown that this unusual organization of the pathway and the long evolutionary distance between trypanosomatids and other organisms have led to the endowment of distinct kinetic, regulatory, and structural properties to most of the trypanosomatid glycolytic enzymes. These properties are currently being exploited for the structure-based design of parasite enzyme-selective inhibitors to be used as lead drugs (6.Verlinde C.L.M.J. Hannaert V. Blonski C. Willson M. Périé J.J. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Opperdoes F.R. Gelb M.H. Hol W.G.J. Michels P.A.M. Drug Resist. Update. 2001; 4: 50-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). All enzymes involved in the glycolysis of T. brucei have been purified previously (either the authentic enzymes from parasites grown in rats or enzymes expressed from recombinant genes in Escherichia coli), and their kinetic properties have been determined (7.Misset O. Bos O.J.M. Opperdoes F.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 8.Bakker B.M. Westerhoff H.V. Michels P.A.M. J. Bioenerg.

These data and the information about the enzymes' subcellular organization and specific activities in lysates of trypanosomes grown in rats have been used to develop an in silico model of glycolysis in the parasite (10.Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The fluxes and cytosolic metabolite concentrations as predicted by the model were in accordance with data experimentally determined in non-growing trypanosomes under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Following the principles of Metabolic Control Analysis (11.Kacser H. Burns J.A. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1973; 27: 65-104PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Heinrich R. Rapoport T.A. Eur. J.

Portland Press Ltd., London1997Google Scholar), which imply that, in general, there is no single rate-limiting step in a metabolic pathway, but that control can be shared among several steps, the model was subsequently used to calculate what controls the flux of trypanosome glycolysis under physiological conditions. Moreover, the extent to which different enzymes should be inhibited to achieve a certain decrease in glycolytic flux was estimated (14.Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14551-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 15.Helfert S. Estevez A.M. Bakker B. Michels P. Clayton C. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Such information may be relevant for choosing optimal drug targets (16.Bakker B.M. Westerhoff H.V. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 106: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). According to the computer simulation, under physiological conditions, most control is exerted by the glucose transporter, but can be shifted to a set of four enzymes, aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH 1The abbreviations used are: GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HXK, hexokinase; PFK, phosphofructokinase; PYK, pyruvate kinase; RNAi, RNA interference; PGAM, phosphoglycerate mutase; ENO, enolase; UTR, untranslated region. ; EC 1.2.1.12), phosphoglycerate kinase (EC 2.7.2.3), and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.8), at high glucose concentrations and/or when a small increase occurs in the level of the transporter. Similarly, these five steps appear to have the most prominent effects on the flux if their levels are decreased. Surprisingly, trypanosomes seemed to possess a substantial overcapacity of hexokinase (HXK; EC 2.7.1.1), phosphofructokinase (PFK; EC 2.7.1.11) and pyruvate kinase (PYK; EC 2.7.1.40), the kinases that are often thought to control glycolysis (17.Boiteux A. Hess B. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1981; 293: 5-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 18.Rapoport T.A. Heinrich R. Jacobasch G. Rapoport S. Eur. J.

Indeed, the results predicted for the glucose transporter (trypanosome hexose transporter) were essentially confirmed by experiments showing that 40% of the total flux control is exerted by the trypanosome hexose transporter (20.Bakker B.M. Walsh M.C. Ter Kuile B.H. Mensonides F.I. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This implies that earlier claims that glucose transport is the only rate-limiting step exaggerated the role of the transporter (21.Grünberg J. Sharma P.R. Deshusses J. Eur. J.

In this work, we present our further analysis of the control of glycolytic flux in bloodstream form T. brucei. First, the model was optimized and extended with recent information about the kinetics of enzymes (25.Chevalier N. Rigden D.J. Van Roy J. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A.M. Eur. J.

Moreover, it was modified on the basis of activities of enzymes as measured in lysates of in vitro cultured growing bloodstream form trypanosomes. Such cells were then used for experimentally determining fluxes after either overexpression of enzymes or their depletion through RNA interference (RNAi). We first set out to check whether HXK, PFK, and PYK are indeed in large excess. Subsequently, two other cytosolic enzymes, phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM; EC 5.4.2.1) and enolase (ENO; EC 4.2.1.11), were studied. The results of these experiments and a comparison of the data obtained experimentally and in silico have been used to gain further insight in the control and regulation of glucose metabolism in these parasites. Bloodstream form T. brucei strain 427 (cell line 449 (29.Biebinger S. Wirtz L.E. Lorenz P. Clayton C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), constitutively expressing the E. coli tetracycline (tet) repressor gene integrated in its genome) was cultured at 37 °C in water-saturated air with 4% CO2 in HMI-9 medium containing 20% heat-inactivated bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 0.2 μg/ml phleomycin (Cayla), the selectable marker for the Tet repressor construct. Tetracycline was used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Cultures were harvested at densities of 1–3 × 106 cells/ml (the exponential growth phase range is 0.2–5 × 106 cells/ml) by centrifugation at 1900 × g for 10 min. Cells used for enzyme activity assays were washed twice with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm leupeptin, 0.25 μm E-64, 10 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl-)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 750 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was kept on ice until assays were performed. For most experiments in molecular biology, standard methodologies were used (30.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar), or protocols were followed as provided by the suppliers of enzymes used for various forms of DNA and RNA manipulation. PCR was performed with either genomic DNA from T. brucei (1 μg) or plasmid DNA (100 ng), the four deoxynucleotides (1 mm each), a sense and antisense primer (10 pmol each), and Taq DNA polymerase (2.5 units; TaKaRa) in a reaction volume of 50 μl. Amplification involved a denaturation step at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, hybridization at a temperature specific for the primer sets chosen for 60 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 60 s. The number of cycles required was determined visually after electrophoresis and ethidium staining of the DNA. Amplification was stopped by incubation at 72 °C for 7 min. Semiquantitative PCR was used to assess changes in RNA levels resulting from RNAi. First, cDNA was prepared using the RevertAid H minus first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas). 1 μg of total RNA purified both from trypanosomes in which RNAi was induced and from cells in which it was not induced was treated with DNase for 30 min. Subsequently, cDNA was synthesized using 0.2 μg of random primers and 200 units Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase in the presence of 20 units of RNase inhibitor at 25 °C for 10 min, followed by 42 °C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by heating at 70 °C for 10 min. The cDNA was stored at–20 °C. 0.2 μg of cDNA was used as a template for PCR with 0.04 mm each dATP, dTTP, and dGTP and 0.01 mm [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), 10 pmol of a sense and antisense primer, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase in a reaction volume of 50 μl. The number of cycles (denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, hybridization at a temperature specific for the primer sets chosen for 60 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 60 s), terminated with a single 7-min incubation at 72 °C, was chosen such that the experiment remained within the linear range of amplified DNA/cycle. This was tested by migration of the amplified radioactive DNA on a polyacrylamide gel and measuring the 32P signal of the bands using a PhosphorImager. Constructs for Conditional Gene Knockouts—To attempt to create conditional knockout HXK and PFK strains, three constructs were made for each HXK and PFK. First, for inducible expression of a new gene, a DNA fragment containing the full-length gene flanked with HindIII and BamHI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, was introduced into vector pHD677 (29.Biebinger S. Wirtz L.E. Lorenz P. Clayton C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This places the gene under the control of a T. brucei procyclic acidic repetitive protein promoter to which the tet operator has been fused. Furthermore, the vector provides a 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of a procyclic acidic repetitive protein gene and a 3′-UTR of a variant surface glycoprotein gene for the inserted gene. The vector has also a hygromycin gene that will be constitutively expressed in trypanosomes and a sequence of the ribosomal repeat spacer with a unique NotI restriction site. Linearization of the construct with NotI permits its insertion by homologous recombination into this transcriptionally silent region of the genome. Two other constructs were made for the HXK and PFK genes to disrupt both their alleles. These constructs were made with a pBluescript-based vector containing a G418 (neomycin) or blasticidin resistance cassette (pBS-TubNeo and pBS-Blast, respectively). (The latter one was made from pBS-Hyg by replacing the hygromycin gene with the blasticidin gene; pBS-Tub and pBS-Hyg were kindly donated by Dr. Christine Clayton (Zentrum fuer Molekular Biologie Heidelberg, Universität Heidelberg).) For HXK, which is encoded by two tandemly linked genes, a 540-bp fragment of the 5′-part of the coding region and a 572-bp region of the unique 5′-UTR were amplified and placed on either side of the cassettes. These constructs should allow the disruption of one or both genes of the two HXK alleles by homologous recombination upon transfection of trypanosomes. For PFK, which is encoded by only a single gene, a 405-bp region of the 5′-UTR and a 417-bp region of the 3′-UTR were amplified and fused to the genes conferring antibiotic resistance. Constructs for RNAi—To induce RNAi of HXK, PFK, PGAM, ENO, and PYK, constructs were prepared for the tetracycline-inducible synthesis of an intramolecular (hairpin) double-stranded RNA molecule. This was achieved by cloning, in an direct inverted arrangement, a gene-specific PCR fragment in the sense orientation and the corresponding but somewhat shorter fragment (32–50 bp) in the antisense orientation in either plasmid pHD1136 or pHD677. pHD1136 differs from pHD677 in providing a 3′-UTR of the actin gene to the inserted DNA fragment and having a blasticidin resistance marker gene. The following fragments were cloned: HXK, a 323-bp fragment of the 3′-UTR of the second gene in the HXK locus in the sense orientation and a 280-bp fragment in the antisense orientation in pHD1136 (clone pRH3′, selected for RNAi studies); PFK, 466-bp (sense) and 418-bp (antisense) fragments of the 3′-UTR in pHD1136 (clone pRP3′); ENO, 499-bp (sense) and 434-bp (antisense) fragments of the 5′-part of the coding region in pHD677 (clone pHD677-ENO); PGAM, 550-bp (sense) and 500-bp (antisense) fragments of the coding region in pHD677 (clone pHD677-PGAM); and PYK, 432-bp (sense) and 400-bp (antisense) fragments of the 3′-end of the gene including a small part of its 3′-UTR in pHD677 (clone pHD677-PYK). All RNAi constructs were prepared for chromosomal integration in the ribosomal repeat spacer. To minimize off-target effects in RNAi studies, the specificity of all gene fragments selected for making RNAi constructs was checked by performing BLAST searches against the genome data base of T. brucei (available at www.geneDB.org/genedb/tryp/blast.jsp). Trypanosomes were cultured to a density of 1.6 × 106 cells/ml; centrifuged; washed with 5 ml of Cytomix supplemented with 0.5% glucose, 1 mm hypoxanthine, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (31.Van den Hoff M.J.

Biol. 2004; 262: 53-86PubMed Google Scholar); and resuspended in 0.4 ml of the same solution. The trypanosome suspension was incubated with 10 μg of linearized DNA and subsequently subjected to a single discharge using a Genetronics BTX ECM630 electroporator at settings of 1250 V, 25 ohms, and 50 microfarads to obtain a pulse with a voltage of 1000 V and a time constant of 260 μs. After dilution of the cell in 12 ml of culture medium, it was split into 24 wells of a microtiter plate. An antibiotic to select positive transfectants was added after 24 h. The antibiotic used was hygromycin (Sigma) at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml, blasticidin (Invitrogen) at 5 μg/ml, or G418 (Invitrogen) at 2 μg/ml. Antibiotic-resistant cells were detectable after 7–10 days. If antibiotic-resistant cultures appeared in >3 of 24 wells, limiting dilution was performed to ascertain the existence of cloned cell lines. Correct integration of constructs into the genome was checked by Southern blotting and hybridization and/or PCR, and expression of newly introduced genes was checked by reverse transcription-PCR. Enzyme assays were performed as described previously: HXK, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9), PFK, triose-phosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.1), GAPDH, phosphoglycerate kinase, and glycerol kinase (EC 2.7.1.30) (33.Misset O.

Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay based on Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described previously (27.Hannaert V. Albert M.A. Rigden D.J. da Silva Giotto M.T. Thiemann O. Garratt R.C. Van Roy J. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P. A.M.

Primary polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against purified proteins (either natural proteins purified from blood-stream form trypanosomes as described by Misset et al. (7.Misset O.

The rate of glucose consumption was determined by measuring the production of tritiated water, exchanged for “bulk” water in the aldolase-catalyzed reaction as described by Bontemps et al. (35.Bontemps F. Hue L. Hers H.G. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), by incubation of 1 × 108 trypanosomes with 0.3 μCi/ml d-[3-3H]glucose (Amersham Biosciences) in 2 ml of HMI-9 medium at 37 °C for 30 min. For determination of the rate of pyruvate and glycerol production, minimally 5 × 107 trypanosomes were cultured in 2 ml of HMI-9 medium at 37 °C for 30–45 min. Batches of cells were lysed before and after culturing for a certain period of time, respectively, and the reactions were stopped by addition of 7% (final concentration) HClO4. The extracts were incubated for 10 min on ice and centrifuged, and the supernatant was neutralized with 3 m KOH/KHCO3, followed by another centrifugation step. The supernatant thus obtained was kept on ice, and the amounts of pyruvate and glycerol present in it were measured by their quantitative conversion into other metabolites with the concomitant oxidation of NADH, followed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. The rate of oxygen consumption was monitored polarographically at 37 °C in a thermostatted vessel with a Clark-type electrode as described (20.Bakker B.M. Walsh M.C. Ter Kuile B.H. Mensonides F.I.

A kinetic model of glycolysis in bloodstream form T. brucei was previously constructed (10.Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), modified (14.Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol.

J. 2001; 357: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The model was further extended for this study. (i) For better comparison between the model and experiments, Vmax values in the model were modified on the basis of measurement of specific activities of enzymes in lysates of in vitro cultured trypanosomes. (Earlier versions were based on data from trypanosomes isolated from rats, which were unable to grow ex vivo.) (ii) Reversible Michaelis-Menten rate equations with one substrate and one product for PGAM and ENO were included into the model, as kinetic data had become available. (iii) The aldolase equation was corrected; the equilibrium constant is now independent of the adenine nucleotide concentrations. (iv) Kinetic parameters of glucose transport, glycerol kinase, phosphoglycerate kinase, PGAM, and ENO were updated based on new experimental data. All numerical calculations of the T. brucei model were carried out using the program Jarnac (36.Sauro, H. M. (2000) Proceedings of the 9th International Meeting on BioThermoKinetics: Jarnac, a System for Interactive Metabolic Analysis, in Animating the Cellular Map (Hofmeyr, J. H. S., Rohwer, J.

Details on the extensions of the model (rate equations, differential equations, and parameter values) are provided in the Supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” Extension of the Metabolic Model—In this study, we compared the effects of knockdown of enzyme activities on glycolytic flux in bloodstream form trypanosomes with predictions made by the kinetic model of this pathway. To this end, the model was first updated with the most recent information. Previous model versions (10.Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 15.Helfert S. Estevez A.M. Bakker B. Michels P. Clayton C. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) were based on specific enzyme activities and enzyme concentrations measured in lysates of T. brucei strain 427, purified from infected rats (7.Misset O. Bos O.J.M. Opperdoes F.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This laboratory-adapted strain can grow in rats to very high densities (>109 cells/ml of blood, 103 to 104-fold higher than in their natural hosts) and cause acidosis of the blood or hypoglycemia. This may have affected the levels of glycolytic enzymes in the trypanosomes. Moreover, once taken from the animal and purified over an ion-exchange column, the trypanosomes do not grow anymore. For the experimental test of the model described in this study, we used an in vitro cultured cell line of growing trypanosomes derived from strain 427. The maximal densities to be reached are 5 × 106 cells/ml. Enzyme activities were measured again, now in lysates of different batches of these trypanosomes harvested at different cell densities. The specific activities appeared to be rather constant during the exponential phase of growth (cell densities between 1 and 3 × 106 cells/ml). The average values as measured for independently grown batches of cells and the Vmax values used in the model are given in Supplemental Table S1. At higher cell densities, when the growth rate is retarded and cells start entering the stationary phase, higher specific activities were found for several enzymes, notably triose-phosphate isomerase, HXK, and phosphoglycerate kinase (data not shown). Additionally, the model was modified with improved kinetic data for glycerol kinase, extended by incorporation of PGAM and ENO, and the reactions catalyzed by aldolase, phosphoglycerate kinase, and the glucose transporter were slightly mod"
https://openalex.org/W2150186914,"Helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) is an isothermal in vitro DNA amplification method based upon the coordinated actions of helicases to separate double-stranded DNA and DNA polymerases to synthesize DNA. Previously, a mesophilic form of HDA (mHDA) utilizing the Escherichia coli UvrD helicase, DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment, two accessory proteins, MutL and single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB), was developed (1). In an effort to improve the specificity and performance of HDA, we have cloned and purified a thermostable UvrD helicase (Tte-UvrD) and the mutL homolog (Tte-MutL) from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis. Characterization of the Tte-UvrD helicase shows that it is stable and active from 45 to 65 degrees C. We have found that the Tte-UvrD helicase unwinds blunt-ended DNA duplexes as well as substrates possessing 3'- or 5'-ssDNA tails. Tte-UvrD was used to develop athermophilichelicase-dependent amplification (tHDA) system to selectively amplify target sequences at 60-65 degrees C. The tHDA system is more efficient than mHDA, displaying heightened amplification sensitivity without the need for the MutL and SSB accessory proteins. Amplification independent of MutL corresponds with studies demonstrating that maximal Tte-UvrD helicase activity does not require the mutL homolog. The tHDA system allows for rapid amplification and detection of targets present in genomic DNA. The expeditious nature and simplistic design of the tHDA platform makes the technology ideal for use in diagnostic applications requiring rapid identification of organisms at the point-of-need."
https://openalex.org/W2170754372,"The calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT) pathway represents a crucial transducer of cellular function. There is increasing evidence placing the sarcolemmal calcium pump, or plasma membrane calcium/calmodulin ATPase pump (PMCA), as a potential modulator of signal transduction pathways. We demonstrate a novel interaction between PMCA and the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin, in mammalian cells. The interaction domains were located to the catalytic domain of PMCA4b and the catalytic domain of the calcineurin A subunit. Endogenous calcineurin activity, assessed by measuring the transcriptional activity of its best characterized substrate, NFAT, was significantly inhibited by 60% in the presence of ectopic PMCA4b. This inhibition was notably reversed by the co-expression of the PMCA4b interaction domain, demonstrating the functional significance of this interaction. PMCA4b was, however, unable to confer its inhibitory effect in the presence of a calcium/calmodulin-independent constitutively active mutant calcineurin A suggesting a calcium/calmodulin-dependent mechanism. The modulatory function of PMCA4b is further supported by the observation that endogenous calcineurin moves from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane when PMCA4b is overexpressed. We suggest recruitment by PMCA4b of calcineurin to a low calcium environment as a possible explanation for these findings. In summary, our results offer strong evidence for a novel functional interaction between PMCA and calcineurin, suggesting a role for PMCA as a negative modulator of calcineurin-mediated signaling pathways in mammalian cells. This study reinforces the emerging role of PMCA as a molecular organizer and regulator of signaling transduction pathways."

In addition to its Cdk binding-dependent functions, cyclin D1 regulates cellular differentiation in part by modifying several transcription factors and nuclear receptors. The molecular mechanism through which cyclin D1 regulates the function of transcription factors involved in cellular differentiation remains to be clarified. The histone acetyltransferase protein p300 is a co-integrator required for regulation of multiple transcription factors. Here we show that cyclin D1 physically interacts with p300 and represses p300 transactivation. We demonstrated further that the interaction of the two proteins occurs at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ-responsive element of the lipoprotein lipase promoter in the context of the local chromatin structure. We have mapped the domains in p300 and cyclin D1 involved in this interaction. The bromo domain and cysteine- and histidine-rich domains of p300 were required for repression by cyclin D1. Cyclin D1 repression of p300 was independent of the Cdk- and retinoblastoma protein-binding domains of cyclin D1. Cyclin D1 inhibits histone acetyltransferase activity of p300 in vitro. Microarray analysis identified a signature of genes repressed by cyclin D1 and induced by p300 that promotes cellular differentiation and induces cell cycle arrest.

D-type cyclins fluctuate in abundance during cell cycle progression, induced by mitogenic stimulation, and in the case of cyclin D1 serve as a key target in oncogenic and mitogenic signaling.

The domains conserved between p300 and CBP include a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain, a bromo domain, three cysteine- and histidine-rich domains (CH), and a cell cycle regulatory domain (CRD1). p300 was initially cloned as an E1A interacting protein (14Rikitake Y.

Virol. 1990; 64: 4421-4427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p300 also forms a physical bridge between transcription factors and the basal transcription apparatus to coordinate regulation of gene transcription. The subdomains of p300 that encode HAT function alter the acetylation of lysine residues on histones, thereby altering accessibility of transcription factors to target gene promoters. The bromo domain of p300 recognizes and facilitates binding of p300 to acetylated lysine residues of histones and transcription factors such as p53 (18Bottomley M.J. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 464-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Direct acetylation of transcription factors by p300 also alters transcription factor activity (19Fu M. Wang C. Wang J.

The somatic mutations of p300 in human cancers and cell lines include the bromo and CH3 domains. Finally, hematological malignancies are induced in mouse models inactivating these proteins, supporting the view that p300/CBP functions as a tumor suppressor (29Shigeno K. Yoshida H. Pan L. Luo J.M.

Because of the evidence that p300 is a rate-limiting transcriptional co-integrator and tumor suppressor, it has been hypothesized that additional cell cycle components may regulate p300 function and thereby coordinate growth factor and differentiation signals or functionally inactivate the putative tumor suppressor function of p300 during tumor progression (25Iyer N.G. Ozdag H. Caldas C. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4225-4231Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Here studies were conducted to examine the mechanisms underlying the physiologically relevant role of cyclin D1 as an inhibitor of PPARγ function and adipocyte differentiation (10Wang C.

Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6159-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). As p300 is a limiting factor in PPARγ function, we assessed the role of cyclin D1 in regulating p300 function. We show that cyclin D1 physically interacts with p300 and represses p300 transactivation independent of its Cdk- and pRb-binding domains. Microarray analysis identified a signature of genes that are repressed by cyclin D1 and induced by p300. Collectively, our results suggest that cyclin D1 plays an important role to modulate p300 activity and its target gene expression.

The medium was changed after 5 h; cells were treated with ligand or vehicle as indicated in the figure legends, and luciferase activity was determined after 24 h. Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency with β-galactosidase or Renilla reporters as an internal control. Luciferase assays were performed at room temperature with an Autolumat LB 953 (EG & G Berthold) (34Watanabe G. Howe A. Lee R.J. Albanese C. Shu I.W. Karnezis A.N. Zon L. Kyriakis J. Rundell K.

The fold effect was determined by comparison to the empty expression vector cassette, and statistical analyses were performed using the Mann Whitney U test. The PPARγ-specific ligand, rosiglitazone, and troglitazone were purchased from Calbiochem; the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), was from Sigma.

The coding region of mouse cyclin D1 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number S78355) was inserted into the MSCV-IRESGFP vector at the EcoRI site upstream of the IRES driving expression of GFP. MSCV retroviruses were prepared by transient co-transfection with helper virus into 293T cells, by using calcium phosphate precipitation. The retroviral supernatants were harvested 48 h after transfection (44Muller A.J. Young J.C. Pendergast A.M. Pondel M. Landau N.R. Littman D.R. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. Cyclin D1+/+ and cyclin D1-/- MEFs were incubated with fresh retroviral supernatants in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene for 24 h, cultured for 6 more days, and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS-Vantage SE, BD Biosciences) for GFP-positive cells. RNA Isolation, Oligonucleotide Microarray, and Data Analysis— Total RNA was isolated from mouse p300+/+ and p300-/- MEFs or from cyclin D1-/- MEFs infected with either MSCV-IRESGFP vector or MSCV-cyclin D1-IRESGFP and was used to probe Affymetrix U74Av2 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Probe synthesis and hybridization were performed according to the manufacturer's manual (see eukaryotic target preparation section at www.affymetrix.com/support for details). Single array analysis and comparison analysis were performed after scanning the genechips, and all chips were scaled by setting up the “Target Signal” at 500 under “All Probe Sets.” The data were then transferred to the data base. Two sets of arrays (either p300+/+ versus p300-/- or cyclin D1 versus vector control), three samples within each group, were compared, and nine comparison analyses were generated. The genes with change calls consistently increased or decreased were selected using the Affymetrix Data Mining Tools and were further filtered based on absolute analysis using the t test and detection calls. To visualize expression difference of the selected genes, color coding was performed using Matlab software. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—293T cells were transfected with expression vectors for cyclin D1 and p300. Thirty hours after transfection, the cells lysates were prepared in 600 μl of cell lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.4 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with proteinase inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics, catalog number 1836145)). 600 μg of cellular lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation with 10 μl of anti-p300 or cyclin D1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads at 4 °C overnight. Normal rabbit IgG was used as a negative control. The beads were washed with 800 μl of cell lysis buffer five times, resuspended in 30 μl of cell lysis buffer plus 6 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and denatured by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were dissolved in 10% SDS-PAGE. The membrane was blotted with either anti-p300 or anti-cyclin D1 antibody (DCS-6, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at room temperature for 1 h and then washed three times with 0.05% Tween 20/phosphate-buffered saline. The membrane was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. The immunoreactive proteins were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP analysis was performed as described previously (45Hulit J. Wang C. Albanese C. Di Vizio D. Mahmood R. Augenlicht L.H. Russell R. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7598-7611Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). 2 × 107 cyclin D1+/+ or cyclin D1-/- MEF cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% charcoal-dextran-stripped serum for 3 days. Upon treatment, the cells were cross-linked by adding 1.0% formaldehyde buffer containing 100 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA-Na, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EGTA-Na, Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, directly to culture medium for 10 min at 37 °C. The medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice using ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors. The cells were then lysed with 1% SDS lysis buffer and incubated for 10 min on ice. The cell lysates were sonicated to shear DNA to lengths between 200 and 500 bp, and the samples were diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl). To reduce nonspecific background, the cell pellet suspension was precleared with 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein-A-agarose, 50% slurry (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 2 h at 4 °C with agitation. Chromatin solutions were precipitated overnight at 4 °C with rotation using 4 μg of antibodies to either FLAG (Sigma) or p300 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). For a negative control, rabbit or mouse IgG was incubated with the supernatant fraction for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry was added for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation to collect the antibody-histone complex and washed extensively following the manufacturer's protocol. Input and immunoprecipitated chromatin were incubated at 65 °C overnight to reverse cross-linking. After proteinase K digestion for 1 h, DNA was extracted using a Qiagen spin column kit. Precipitated DNAs were analyzed by PCR of 30 cycles. The oligonucleotides used for PCR to identify the PPARE in the mouse lipoprotein lipase (LPL) promoter were 5′-AAACCCCTCCTCTCTGCCTC-3′ and 5′-CCTCGGAGGAGGAGTAGGAG-3′.

Briefly, HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with expression vectors for p300, either with expression vector of cyclin D1 or control vector. Cells were grown in 100-mm culture dishes for 36 h after transfection, collected by scraping in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in 300 μl of cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated on ice for 30 min to extract the whole cell proteins. For immunoprecipitation the protein concentration was adjusted to 1 μg/μl in 500 μl cell lysis buffer and was incubated with 5 μg of p300 antibodies (N15, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 2 h with rotation. Protein A-agarose (30 μl) was then added, and the mixture was rotated slowly overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were pelleted by gentle centrifugation and washed three times with cell lysis buffer. The beads were then washed with HAT buffer (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 10 mm butyric acid, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) (47Gu W. Roeder R.G.

https://openalex.org/W2043379423,"Pirin is a recently identified eukaryotic protein implicated in transcriptional activation and apoptosis. Homologues of Pirin are highly conserved in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but their function remains poorly understood. We present here the crystal structure of the yhhW gene product, a putative Pirin homologue, from Escherichia coli and confirm its structural similarity to Pirin. The YhhW protein displays a bicupin fold with a single N-terminal metal coordination site. Molecular surface comparisons of YhhW and Pirin with structurally similar proteins suggested quercetin as a potential ligand. We demonstrate that both bacterial and human Pirins have quercetinase activity, which is inhibited by the addition of typical inhibitors of the quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase reaction. We also demonstrate the release of carbon monoxide as a reaction product. This is the first report of enzymatic activity for any member of the Pirin family and may be an important connection to their roles in transcriptional regulation.

This is the first report of enzymatic activity for any member of the Pirin family and may be an important connection to their roles in transcriptional regulation. Pirin is a recently identified protein that is localized to subnuclear dotlike structures in a wide variety of human tissues (1.Wendler W.M. Kremmer E. Forster R. Winnacker E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8482-8489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Pirins are highly conserved among mammals, plants, fungi, and prokaryotes and have been classified as a subfamily of the cupin superfamily on the basis of both sequence and structural similarity (1.Wendler W.M. Kremmer E. Forster R. Winnacker E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8482-8489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 2.Dunwell J.M. Microb. Comp. Genomics. 1998; 3: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The cupin superfamily is one of the most functionally diverse protein classes and includes both enzymatic and nonenzymatic members, ranging from isomerases and epimerases that are involved in the modification of cell wall carbohydrates to nonenzymatic storage proteins in plant seeds and transcriptional cofactors in humans (2.Dunwell J.M. Microb. Comp. Genomics. 1998; 3: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cupin proteins typically maintain a highly conserved GX5HXHX3,4-EX6G metal-binding motif, along with a GX5PXGX2HX3N motif, and a conserved β-barrel fold. The structure of human Pirin (hPirin), 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: hPirin, human Pirin protein; quercetin, 3,3′,4′,5,7-pentahydroxyflavone; kojic acid, 5-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-4H-pyran-4-one; r.m.s., root mean square. the only structure of a Pirin determined to date, also displays two cupin domains, consistent with other bicupin family members (3.Pang H.

The function of Pirin is not known, and no enzymatic activity has been described for any of the homologues. Early studies demonstrated the ability of hPirin to interact with the nuclear factor I/CCAAAT box transcription factor (NF-I) (1.Wendler W.M. Kremmer E. Forster R. Winnacker E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8482-8489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and the oncoprotein B cell lymphoma 3-encoded (Bcl-3) in vivo (4.Dechend R. Hirano F. Lehmann K. Heissmeyer V. Ansieau S. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. Leutz A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3316-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), suggesting that hPirin may be involved in the modulation of NFI/CTF1 transcriptional activation or possibly in other nuclear processes, such as DNA replication or repair (1.Wendler W.M. Kremmer E. Forster R. Winnacker E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8482-8489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As observed with hPirin and its homologues, proteins involved with such fundamental cellular processes are highly conserved throughout evolution. Recent studies of tumor metastasis in advanced colorectal cancer have also implicated Pirin in cellular responses to polysaccharide-K, a chemoimmunotherapeutic agent from mushrooms (5.Yoshikawa R. Yanagi H. Hashimoto-Tamaoki T. Morinaga T. Nakano Y. Noda M. Fujiwara Y. Okamura H. Yamamura T. Oncol. Rep. 2004; 12: 1287-1293PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of hPirin homologues in plants have suggested a possible involvement of these proteins in programmed cell death, seed germination, and seedling development. The Lepirin gene from tomato exhibited dramatically increased mRNA levels in response to both camptothecin- and fusmonisin-B1-induced programmed cell death, which, when taken together with the hPirin interaction studies, implies a possible relationship between the Le-pirin-encoded protein and NF-κB-associated pathways in plant defense mechanisms (6.Orzaez D. de Jong A.J. Woltering E.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 46: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The insertion mutants of the hPirin homologue from Arabidopsis display phenotypes of reduced germination levels in the absence of stratification and an abscisic acid-imposed delay in germination and early seedling development (7.Lapik Y.R. Kaufman L.S. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1578-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These studies highlight the apparent importance of Pirin proteins in fundamental cellular processes of numerous species. Until very recently, there had been no reports on the characterization of hPirin homologues in prokaryotes. Investigations of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 indicated that the putative Pirin-encoding gene was highly induced under severe salt stress and other stress conditions (8.Hihara Y. Muramatsu M. Nakamura K. Sonoike K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 574: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This work also demonstrated the gene to be negatively regulated by an LysR-type transcriptional regulator located immediately upstream of the gene but in the divergent direction (8.Hihara Y. Muramatsu M. Nakamura K. Sonoike K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 574: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To date, hPirin is the only structure representative of this protein subfamily. Since investigations of bacterial homologues are under-represented in the literature, we undertook structure-based functional analysis of YhhW for comparative purposes. Although the overall sequence identity is not high (28% identity) and the bacterial variant is 60 residues shorter in length than that of its human counterpart, the N-terminal region is very well conserved, particularly for residues forming the metal binding site. Here we present the crystal structure of YhhW refined to 2.0 Å. The structure aligns well with that of hPirin. Active site analysis has allowed us to identify the antioxidant quercetin as an enzymatic substrate, and we demonstrate that both YhhW and hPirin have activity similar to that of quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase, a non-Pirin member of the bicupin family. Additionally, we have been able to confirm the release of carbon monoxide during the reactions of both proteins and have shown that activity can be precluded by inhibitors of quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase. This is the first report of quercetinase activity in either humans or Escherichia coli and the first report of enzyme activity for any member of the Pirin family. Protein Preparation, Crystallization, and X-ray Diffraction Data Collection—Recombinant YhhW was expressed as a selenomethionine derivative in DL41 (DE3) E. coli cells under control by the T7 promoter in LeMaster medium (9.Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). The expression construct contained a C-terminal hexahistidine tag that permitted facile purification using batch elution over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). The final yield was 200 mg of pure protein/liter of E. coli culture with no additional purification steps. The protein was concentrated to 10 mg ml-1 in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, and 300 mm NaCl for crystallization. All reagents for protein expression and purification were purchased from BIOSHOP Canada. All crystallization reagents were purchased from Hampton Research. Protein crystals of YhhW were generated through hanging drop vapor diffusion by mixing 2 μl of protein solution with 2 μl of well solution. The final crystallization condition contained 26% polyethylene glycol 400, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.6, and 0.1 m cadmium chloride. The hPirin expression construct was generously provided by Dr. Zihe Rao from the Laboratory of Structural Biology, Tsinghua University. The protein was expressed in DL41 (DE3) E. coli cells under kanamycin selection, as per the previous reports (10.Zeng Q. Li X. Bartlam M. Wang G. Pang H. Rao Z. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1496-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The cells were then lysed, and the protein was purified in a similar manner to YhhW. hPirin was purified to homogeneity via a single nickel affinity step. Data were collected at cryogenic temperature (100 K) using 35% polyethylene glycol 400 as a cryoprotectant at the 19-BM beamline of the Structural Biology Center, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory (Chicago, IL) using a 3 × 3 mosaic CCD detector. Reflections were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (11.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The space group was P3221 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 62.769 Å, c = 98.053Å. Structure Determination and Refinement—The YhhW crystal structure was determined by single anomalous dispersion using a selenomethionine derivative. The heavy atom positions for six of seven selenomethionine positions, along with five cadmium positions, were identified using SOLVE (12.Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar, 13.Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Density modification was performed by RESOLVE (12.Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar, 13.Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The figure of merit of phasing following density modification was 61% in RESOLVE. RESOLVE traced 153, or 66%, of the residues in the asymmetric unit. This starting model and the phase from RESOLVE were used for unrestrained refinement with iterative water refinements using REFMAC5 (15.Murshudov G.N. Vagub A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). The new model, consisting of 218 of the 242 residues in the construct, was built using the refined phases by ARP/wARP 6.0 (16.Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar). The remaining residues were added manually, and the complete model was refined using REFMAC5 (15.Murshudov G.N. Vagub A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) and CNS (17.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). Although density was observed for three histidines of the purification tag, none was apparent for the side chains of residues Val138 and Gln139, which have been modeled as glycine. A total of 207 water molecules and six cadmium ions have been added to the final model. The structure factors and coordinates have been deposited under the accession code 1TQ5 in the Protein Data Bank. Fold recognition and comparison were carried out using the Protein Structure Comparison Service, incorporating secondary structure matching, at the European Bioinformatics Institute (available on the World Wide Web at www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/ssm) to search the Secondary Structure Classification of Proteins data base (18.Krissinel E.

Activity Assays—The quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase activities of YhhW and hPirin were assayed at 295 K for 5 min in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 60 μm quercetin in Me2SO, and 18.5 nm enzyme. Activity was observed by following the decrease in the absorbance maximum for quercetin, which occurs at 384 nm at pH 8.0. The inhibitors kojic acid, sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, and 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrochloride were dissolved in Me2SO and added to the reactions at a final concentration of 50 nm (20.Steiner R.A.

Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry—The iron and copper content of the YhhW protein sample was analyzed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry on a SpectrAA-20Plus instrument (Varian) employing an air-acetylene flame through the Analytical Services Unit at Queen's University. The detection wavelengths were 324.8 nm (0.5-nm slit width) and 248.3 nm (0.2-nm slit width) for copper and iron, respectively. Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry—YhhW samples were treated with 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm diethyldithiocarbamate and concentrated to 1.8 mg ml-1 in water, equivalent to a greater than 70-fold molar excess of each chelating reagent relative to the amount of protein present. Samples not subjected to metal chelation were concentrated to 1.3 mg ml-1 in water. For both samples, the concentrate flow-through was collected, and the metal content measured as a control. All samples were processed, and the metal content was determined at the Queen's Facility for Isotope Research, Department of Geology, Queen's University. The amounts of magnesium, manganese, iron, cobalt, copper, zinc, and cadmium were quantified for each sample. Detection of CO Liberation—The release of carbon monoxide (CO) during the reaction was monitored in amber glass vials with a total reaction volume of 250 μl following displacement of the headspace gas for 10 s with 1% O2. A solution of quercetin in reaction buffer was used as a standard. Increasing CO levels in the headspace were monitored using a RGA3 gas chromatograph (Trace Analytical, Menlo Park, CA) equipped with a 13× molecular sieve and a chemical-spectrophotometric detector that measures, at 254 nm, elemental mercury from the reaction of CO with HgO (23.Odrcich M.J. Graham C.H. Kimura K.A. McLaughlin B.E. Marks G.S. Nakatsu K. Brien J.F. Placenta. 1998; 19: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The Crystal Structure of YhhW—The structure of YhhW, a putative member of the Pirin family, was determined using the single anomalous dispersion method from a single selenomethionine derivative crystal (Fig. 1). The structure was refined to 2.0 Å with R and R-free values of 20.2 and 27.2%, respectively (Table I). For the final structure, 90.2% of residues were in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, whereas 8.2 and 1.6% were in the additionally allowed and generously allowed regions of the plot, respectively. We have attributed the high R-free value to inherent problems with this crystal form, the data from which present a slightly skewed intensity distribution as calculated in Truncate (24.French S. Wilson K. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1978; 34: 517-525Crossref Scopus (894) Google Scholar) (See Supplementary Material). The space group was P3221 with one monomer in the asymmetric unit. The final model contained all of the 231 residues encoded by the native protein; however, no side chain density was observed for residues Val138 and Gln139. Thus, these residues were modeled as glycine. This model also contained 207 water molecules and six cadmium ions, one of which was clearly located at the conserved metal coordination site. All cadmium ions exhibited full occupancy in the refined structure. Interestingly, the histidine purification tag was partially visible in the refined structure and was involved in the bridging of YhhW with a symmetry-related molecule through interactions mediated by cadmium atoms. Two purification tag histidine residues coordinate a cadmium ion in a small cleft between the N- and C-terminal domains. The histidine lying between these residues is rotated to face a symmetry-related molecule, where it is involved in the coordination of a symmetry-related cadmium ion. The remaining cadmium sites were located on the molecular surface, where they were involved in less elaborate intermolecular bridging (see Supplementary Material). Structural alignment with the previously determined human Pirin structure was excellent (Fig. 2), displaying only a root mean squared (r.m.s.) deviation of 1.81 Å despite an overall sequence identity of 28% (18.Krissinel E.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Structural comparisons of YhhW. A, human Pirin (1J1L) (B) and quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase (Protein Data Bank code 1JUH) (C) and glycinin g1 (D) (Protein Data Bank code 1FXZ) (48.Adachi M. Takenaka Y. Gidamis A.B. Mikami B. Utsumi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Although there is little sequence similarity between the Pirins and quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase, the charge, localization, shape, and size of the active sites are most similar among the bicupins (49.Nicholls A. Sharp K. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5316) Google Scholar). As an example, although glycinin g1 maintains the bicupin topology, it lacks a comparable ligand binding site in the corresponding domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) YhhW is composed of two structurally similar domains arranged face to face. Each domain is composed of two antiparallel β-sheets, with seven β-strands forming a β-sandwich. The N- and C-terminal domains are cross-linked, with strand β1 forming part of one sheet of the C-terminal domain. A single-turn helix connects β1 in the C-terminal domain to β2 of the N-terminal domain. A second domain cross-link occurs between residues Asp136 to Lys141, which join strands β13 to β14. The more apparent difference between YhhW and hPirin occurs at the C terminus. For hPirin, the C terminus extends back toward the N-terminal domain in close proximity to the metal binding site and contains a long α-helix (3.Pang H. Bartlam M. Zeng Q. Miyatake H. Hisano T. Miki K. Wong L.L. Gao G.F. Rao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1491-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). YhhW does not contain an extended C terminus. The metal binding site of YhhW is located within the N-terminal domain and is accordingly positioned in hPirin. Density for a cadmium ion, added as part of the crystallization condition, is clearly visible between residues His57, His59, and His101 (Fig. 1). Specifically, the metal is ligated by His59 and His101 with respective bond lengths of 2.28 and 2.54 Å between the ϵ-nitrogens and the metal. Two water molecules are also involved in the coordination of cadmium and are located 2.47 and 2.67 Å from the cation. A break between strands β5 and β6 appears to provide sufficient flexibility in this region to permit the formation of the metal binding site. Iron is observed in the hPirin structure, and the coordination involves Glu103 in addition to the three histidine residues (3.Pang H. Bartlam M. Zeng Q. Miyatake H. Hisano T. Miki K. Wong L.L. Gao G.F. Rao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1491-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Whereas Glu103 is conserved in YhhW, it is not involved in the coordination of the cadmium ion. Rather, Glu103 of YhhW is hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of Gln91, which positions Glu103 away from the coordinated metal. A slight rotation of His57 that precludes its involvement of cadmium ligation is also observed in YhhW but is not seen in hPirin. Attempts of Identification of the Coordinated Divalent Cation—Atomic absorption spectroscopy was initially employed to quantify the levels of copper and iron in the protein samples. The calculated molar ratio of copper to iron was 1.43. The concentrations of these metal ions were significantly higher than those of the buffer alone. To complement this result, the metal content of YhhW protein samples was determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. No significant amounts of magnesium, manganese, cobalt, or cadmium were found in any of the samples tested. The blank-subtracted molar ratios of zinc/copper/iron were 4.05:1.18:1 for the sample receiving no treatment with EDTA or diethyldithiocarbamate and 7.79:1.62:1 for the sample treated with chelating reagents. Pirin and YhhW Are Structurally Similar to Quercetin 2,3-Dioxygenase—The molecular surface of YhhW was compared with that of hPirin (Protein Data Bank code 1J1L) (3.Pang H. Bartlam M. Zeng Q.

Chem. 2004; 279: 1491-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) as well as with members of the bicupin class that displayed good structural alignments with YhhW (Fig. 2). These included a glyoxylate-induced protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.46 Å r.m.s. deviation, Protein Data Bank code 1SQ4), 5-keto-4-deoxyuronate isomerase from E. coli (2.79 Å r.m.s. deviation, Protein Data Bank code 1X8M), canavalin from jack bean (2.35 Å r.m.s. deviation, Protein Data Bank code 2CAU) (25.Ko T.P. Day J. McPherson A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and soybean β-conglycinin beta homotrimer complexes (2.41 Å r.m.s. deviation, Protein Data Bank code 1IPJ) (26.Maruyama N. Adachi M. Takahashi K. Yagasaki K. Kohno M. Takenaka Y. Okuda E. Nakagawa S. Mikami B. Utsumi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3595-3604Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Of particular interest was the localization of a deep charged pocket in the N-terminal domain of YhhW and hPirin immediately next to the metal coordination site. This region was most similar in charge, shape, and size to that of quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase (Protein Data Bank code 1JUH) (Fig. 2) (22.Fusetti F. Schroter K.H. Steiner R.A. van Noort P.I. Pijning T. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Egmond M.R. Dijkstra B.W. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Additionally, manual docking of the quercetin substrate into the pockets of YhhW and hPirin suggested that this compound might be appropriate for catalysis by these proteins (data not shown). The sequence conservation between YhhW and quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase is poor, despite the conservation of the metal coordination residues. Fig. 3 presents the structure-based sequence alignment of YhhW with quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase from Aspergillus japonicus. Cupin motif 1, GX5HXHX3,4EX6G, demonstrates good sequence similarity, but the structural alignment suggests that a slight conformational difference occurs at the metal binding site, since His57 of YhhW is not well aligned with the corresponding histidine residue from quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase (Fig. 3). This is consistent with the rotation of His57 away from the coordinated cadmium in the YhhW crystal structure (Fig. 1). In contrast, cupin motif 2, GX5PxGX2HX3N, displays poor sequence conservation between these proteins, although both generally conform to the consensus sequence. Of particular note is the lack of sequence conservation outside of the cupin motifs in the N-terminal domain. The global folds of YhhW and hPirin aligned reasonably well with reported structures of quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase (2.8 and 2.9 Å r.m.s. deviation, respectively), a copper-containing enzyme with an N-terminal domain that is structurally conserved with the Pirin family (3.Pang H.

The structural conservation of hPirin with other bicupin proteins, including quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase, had been previously reported; however, the quercetinase activity of hPirin was not investigated (3.Pang H. Bartlam M. Zeng Q. Miyatake H. Hisano T. Miki K. Wong L.L. Gao G.F. Rao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1491-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The copper binding site of quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase is formed by three histidines (His66, His68, and His112), a glutamate residue, and a single water molecule. These residues are thought to be functionally equivalent to His55, His57, His101, and Glu103 of YhhW. The N-terminal domain of YhhW aligns well with that of quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase with only 1.05 Å r.m.s. deviation for 66 equivalent residues, whereas the N-terminal domain alignment of hPirin with quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase displays an r.m.s. deviation of only 1.5 Å for 84 equivalent residues, when all atoms, including the metal coordination residues, are considered as part of the alignment (27.Cohen G.E. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1160-1161Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Quercetin Is a Substrate for YhhW and hPirin—hPirin and YhhW were assessed for their ability to utilize quercetin as a substrate. Quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase converts quercetin to 2-protocatechuoylphloroglucinol carboxylic acid and carbon monoxide (Fig. 4A6). Reactions were carried out similarly to those of quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase (28.Oka T. Simpson F.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 43: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Striking modifications in the absorbance spectrum of quercetin were noted immediately upon the addition of enzyme. The typical ab"

Skeletal muscle maximal aerobic performance (VO2max) was assessed in ad libitum (AL) and CR rats aged 8-10 months and 35 months using a pump-perfused hindlimb model to match oxygen delivery to muscle mass between groups. Whereas there was a 46% decline in muscle mass-specific VO2max between 8-10 mo (524+/-13 micromol x min(-1) x 100 g(-1); mean+/- SE) and 35 mo (281+/-54 micromol x min(-1) x 100 g(-1)) in AL rats, not only did CR rats begin at the same point in 8-10 mo old rats (490+/-42 micromol x min(-1) x 100 g(-1)), we found no decline in 35 mo old CR animals (484+/-49 micromol x min(-1) x 100 g(-1)). Interestingly, although most markers of oxidative capacity began at a lower point in young adult CR animals, CR rats exhibited a higher in situ activity of complex IV at VO2max. This activity allows the young adult CR animals to exhibit normal aerobic capacity despite the lower oxidative enzyme activities. In stark contrast to the 19-41% decline in activities of citrate synthase, complexes I-III, and complex IV in homogenates prepared from the plantaris muscle and mixed region of gastrocnemius muscle with aging in AL rats, no age-related decline was found in CR animals. Thus, our results showed that CR preserves aerobic function in aged skeletal muscles by facilitating a higher in situ function of complex IV and by preventing the age-related decline in mitochondrial oxidative capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2118891938,"GRP94, the endoplasmic reticulum paralog of Hsp90, is regulated by adenosine nucleotides that bind to its N-terminal regulatory domain. Because of its weak affinity for nucleotides, the functionally relevant transition in GRP94 is likely to be between the unliganded and nucleotide-bound states. We have determined the structure of the unliganded GRP94 N-domain. The helix 1-4-5 subdomain of the unliganded protein adopts the closed conformation seen in the structure of the protein in complex with inhibitors. This conformation is distinct from the open conformation of the subdomain seen when the protein is bound to ATP or ADP. ADP soaked into crystals of the unliganded protein reveals an intermediate conformation midway between the open and closed states and demonstrates that in GRP94 the conversion between the open and closed states is driven by ligand binding. The direction of the observed movement in GRP94 shows that nucleotides act to open the subdomain elements rather than close them, which is contrary to the motion proposed for Hsp90. These observations support a model where ATP binding dictates the conformation of the N-domain and regulates its ability to form quaternary structural interactions.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13451-13459Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), reflecting the central role of that chaperone in the conformational maturation of cellular kinases and other signal transduction polypeptides. Given the importance of the processes mediated by GRP94 and Hsp90 and their potential as therapeutic targets, the mechanism of action of these chaperones has been under intensive investigation. Hsp90 chaperones are organized into three distinct structural domains: N-terminal, middle, and C-terminal. The N-terminal domain is the site of regulatory ligand binding, the middle domain is the likely site of client protein interaction, and the C-terminal domain contains an obligatory dimer interface. Like cytoplasmic Hsp90 (10Obermann W.M. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 11Panaretou B. Prodromou C.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), GRP94 is regulated by nucleotide binding to its N-terminal domain (2Randow F. Seed B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Hsp90 inhibitors such as geldanamycin and radicicol bind to the N-domain and compete for the ATP binding site (12Stebbins C.E.

Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Although Hsp90 chaperone activity involves cycles of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, the mechanistic consequences of this reaction have yet to be determined. By analogy to MutL (14Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and DNA gyrase (15Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), two members of the GHKL family to which Hsp90s belong (16Dutta R. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), models of Hsp90 function posit that the so-called “lid” region of the N-domain (a subset of the helix 1-4-5 subdomain comprised of helices 4 and 5 and the loop that connects them; see Fig. 1) closes over the ligand binding cavity in response to nucleotide binding and/or hydrolysis. This closing of the lid is then thought to result in the dimerization of the two N-domains thereby forming a “clamp” structure whose pivot point is the obligatory dimer interface in the C-terminal domain (17Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4383-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This model has been controversial, however, as the helix 4 and 5 motions have not been observed experimentally for Hsp90, and a recent kinetic study is consistent with a model where N-domain dimerization and, hence, the chaperone clamp structure, does not occur (18McLaughlin S.H. Ventouras L.A. Lobbezoo B. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 813-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In contrast to Hsp90, recent structural studies of GRP94 have shown that adenosine nucleotide binding leads to a large conformational rearrangement in the helix 1-4-5 subdomain of the N-domain (19Immormino R.M. Dollins D.E. Shaffer P.L. Soldano K.L. Walker M.A. Gewirth D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46162-46171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) compared with its counterpart in the inhibited form of the protein (see Fig. 3, A and B). This rearrangement, which results in a switch between the “closed” (inhibitor-bound) and “open” (ATP- and ADP-bound) conformations, exposes a predominantly hydrophobic surface contributed by residues Phe-78, Val-82, Met-85, Met-86, Ile-89, Ser-92, Leu-93, Tyr-94, Met-178, Gln-182, Thr-188, and Leu-191 that was shown in the structure to serve as an N-domain dimerization interface (19Immormino R.M.

The nucleotide-dependent open conformation of GRP94 was shown to arise as a consequence of a 5-amino acid insertion that extends helix 4 and that, within the Hsp90 family, is unique to GRP94 (Fig. 1). This insertion in GRP94 forms an additional pocket adjacent to the adenine binding cavity that allows binding to specific ligands such as N-ethylcarboxamido adenosine (NECA) 2The abbreviations used are: NECA, N-ethylcarboxamido adenosine; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. (20Soldano K.L. Jivan A. Nicchitta C.V. Gewirth D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48330-48338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The insertion also correlates with a lack of ATP hydrolysis activity in the ER chaperone (21Rosser M.F. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22798-22805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5152-5156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Together these suggest that GRP94 and Hsp90, although sharing extensive structural and sequence homology, employ different regulatory mechanisms. The two ligand-dependent conformations of GRP94 were detected by comparing the inhibitor-bound forms of GRP94 (radicicol, NECA, 2-Cl-dideoxyadenosine) (20Soldano K.L. Jivan A. Nicchitta C.V. Gewirth D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48330-48338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) with the nucleotide-bound forms (19Immormino R.M. Dollins D.E. Shaffer P.L. Soldano K.L. Walker M.A. Gewirth D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46162-46171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, it is likely that the physiologically relevant transition in GRP94 is between the nucleotide-bound state and the unliganded state. Similarly, to understand the mechanism of action of Hsp90 inhibitors such as geldanamycin and radicicol and to fully exploit the structure of the protein in the design of novel high affinity inhibitors, it is necessary to have a description of both the nucleotide-bound and unliganded states of the molecule. To date the structure of unliganded GRP94 has not been described. Modeling studies that placed adenosine nucleotides into the inhibitor-bound conformation of GRP94 led to the prediction that the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-196 would have to be repositioned for nucleotide binding to occur (20Soldano K.L. Jivan A. Nicchitta C.V. Gewirth D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48330-48338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Although this has been borne out experimentally, the conformational changes in GRP94 seen by comparing the inhibitor-bound and nucleotide-bound forms are much larger than is necessary to accommodate the nucleotide (19Immormino R.M. Dollins D.E. Shaffer P.L. Soldano K.L. Walker M.A. Gewirth D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46162-46171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the model proposed for Hsp90, the lid elements of the N-domain (helices 4 and 5) were proposed to close over the nucleotide binding cavity in response to nucleotide binding (17Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4383-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the experimental observation for GRP94 was just the opposite, namely that helices 4 and 5 opened away from the ligand binding cavity in response to nucleotide binding (see Fig. 3, A and B). To more closely address the physiologically relevant transition in GRP94, we have now determined the structure of the unliganded form of the GRP94 N-terminal domain. From this structure, we show that the conformation adopted in the absence of ligand is identical to the closed conformation seen in the inhibitor-bound form. Additionally, we have soaked adenosine nucleotides into crystals of unliganded GRP94, thereby divorcing the packing of the protein into a crystalline lattice from conformational changes caused by nucleotide binding. The structure of this nucleotide-soaked crystalline complex reveals an intermediate state trapped between the open and closed conformations. Together these studies show that the nucleotide-bound and unliganded forms of GRP94 represent distinct structural states, that inhibitors act to stabilize the closed, unliganded conformation, and that the 5′ substituent of adenosine nucleotides is responsible for driving the conformation into the open state. Protein Purification and Crystallization—GRP94-(69-337Δ287-327) (the Δ287-327 is hereafter referred to as Δ41 to reflect the number of residues deleted) and GRP94-(69-337) were overexpressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase fusions and purified by affinity chromatography followed by proteolysis to remove the glutathione S-transferase tag, ion exchange, and gel filtration, as described previously (20Soldano K.L. Jivan A. Nicchitta C.V. Gewirth D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48330-48338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Crystals of unliganded GRP94-(69-337Δ41) were grown at 18 °C by the vapor diffusion method. The protein solution contained 25-30 mg/ml protein, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The reservoir solution contained 38% polyethylene glycol 400, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 40-70 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Unliganded GRP94-(69-337) was crystallized in a similar manner except that the reservoir solution contained 175-200 mm MgCl2 instead of 40-70 mm MgCl2, which presumably reflects the high proportion of charged residues in the linker region. Equal volumes of protein and reservoir solutions were mixed before incubation. Crystals with typical dimensions 0.3 × 0.1 × 0.5 mm appeared after 2-3 days. Crystals were stabilized by gradual replacement of the mother liquor with 46% polyethylene glycol 400, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 100 mm MgCl2 (250 mm MgCl2 for the intact N-domain crystals). Concentrated solutions of ADP or NECA were added to stabilized crystals of unliganded GRP94-(69-337Δ41) to a final concentration of 5 or 1 mm, respectively, and allowed to soak for 24 h. After stabilization crystals were removed from the droplet with nylon loops and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—High resolution data sets for ADP-soaked GRP94-(69-337Δ41) were collected at the Advanced Photon Source on beamline 19ID using a CCD detector. Data sets for the unliganded GRP94-(69-337), unliganded GRP94-(69-337Δ41), and NECA-soaked GRP94-(69-337Δ41) were collected on a RaxisII detector using home source X-rays. The data were processed using HKL2000 (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar) except for the ADP-soaked complex, which was processed with XDS (24Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3233) Google Scholar). Initial phases for each GRP94-(69-337Δ41) data set were obtained by molecular replacement (MolRep) using the entire protein component of GRP94-(69-337Δ41)-NECA (PDB code 1U2O) except for the ADP soaked GRP94-(69-337Δ41) data set that utilized only the core region (residues 69-166 and 200-337), as determined by difference distance matrix analysis (19Immormino R.M.

The protein component of the GRP94-(69-337)-N-propylcarboxamido adenosine complex (PDB code 1U04) was used as the search model for the unliganded GRP94-(69-337) data. Initial models were refined iteratively by manual rebuilding in O (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr.

In later rounds of refinement, ligands and solvent molecules were added, and restrained individual B-factors were used. Structure validation was performed using Mage, KiNG, and Mol-Probity (28Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall III, W.B. de Bakker P.I. Word J.M. Prisant M.G. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C.

Crystallization and Structure Determination—The structure of the unliganded N-terminal domain of GRP94-(69-337Δ41), in which 4 Gly residues replace the charged linker domain, was solved by molecular replacement and refined against 2.2-Å diffraction data. The protein component of the GRP94-(69-337Δ41)-NECA complex (PDB code 1U2O) (20Soldano K.L. Jivan A. Nicchitta C.V. Gewirth D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48330-48338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) was used as the search model. The structure of the intact, unliganded GRP94 N-domain was crystallized and solved by molecular replacement in a similar manner and refined against 3.25-Å diffraction data. Because crystals of unliganded GRP94-(69-337Δ41) diffracted better than crystals of the unliganded intact domain, we used the charged linker deletion construct for most of the experiments and comparisons described in this report. We had previously shown that the charged linker was disordered in crystals of the intact domain (19Immormino R.M. Dollins D.E. Shaffer P.L. Soldano K.L. Walker M.A. Gewirth D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46162-46171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Soldano K.L. Jivan A. Nicchitta C.V. Gewirth D.T. J. Biol.

The dissociation constants for ligand binding to wild type GRP94 and GRP94(Δ41) are the same for all ligands tested to date. 3R. M. Immormino and D. T. Gewirth, unpublished data. Ligand-containing complexes were prepared from crystals of the unliganded protein by stabilizing the crystals in protein-free precipitant solutions and then soaking them in stabilizer solutions containing 5 mm ADP or 1 mm NECA. Many of the crystals soaked in ADP cracked under this treatment, and only those crystals that remained intact were used for further analysis. Soaked crystals were cryoprotected, flash-cooled, and subjected to data collection. Crystals of unliganded GRP94-(69-337Δ41) that were soaked in ADP-containing solutions diffracted to 2.4 Å and underwent a space group change from P212121 to P21212. The space group change reflects the gain of symmetry around a crystallographic dyad and corresponds to a switch from two molecules to one molecule per asymmetric unit. This change also led to a concomitant halving of the b axis. Because of these changes, molecular replacement was also used to solve the structure of the ADP- and NECA-soaked complexes, again using all or structurally conserved portions of the protein component of 1U2O. Structures were refined using CNS (27Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). Water and solvent molecules were added in later stages of refinement independently and without reference to the solvent configuration in the molecular replacement search model. For the ADP-soaked crystal, electron density for residues 167-195 was poor, and so these residues were omitted from the final model. Well defined electron density was observed for the ADP ligand. For the NECA-soaked crystal, clear electron density was observed for all but residues 167-169 and 184-186, which are in loop regions connecting helices 3 and 4 and helices 4 and 5, respectively. Portions of the 2 Fo-Fc electron density maps for all 3 structures are shown in Fig. 2. The Apoprotein N-domain Adopts the Closed Conformation—To date we have observed two distinct conformations of the GRP94 N-domain, each associated with different classes of bound ligands. The closed conformation was observed in GRP94 bound to the high affinity inhibitors NECA, 2Cl-dideoxyadenosine, and radicicol (20Soldano K.L. Jivan A. Nicchitta C.V. Gewirth D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48330-48338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) as well as geldanamycin. 3R. M. Immormino and D. T. Gewirth, unpublished data. The open conformation was seen in GRP94 bound to the adenosine nucleotides ATP, ADP, and AMP (19Immormino R.M. Dollins D.E. Shaffer P.L. Soldano K.L. Walker M.A. Gewirth D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46162-46171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The open and closed conformations differ in the relative positions of helices 4 and 5 along with helix 1 and strand 1. These rearrangements arise from the need to avert potential clashes between the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-196 in the closed conformation with the α and β phosphates of the bound adenosine nucleotide. Because Gly-196 is reoriented to avoid these clashes, helices 4 and 5 are forced to move as well, leading to the rearrangement of helix 1 and strand 1. By analogy with Hsp90 and other members of the GHKL family, adenosine nucleotides are likely physiological ligands for GRP94. Because the binding constant for adenosine nucleotides to GRP94 is weak and ATP hydrolysis above background has not been detected (21Rosser M.F. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22798-22805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5152-5156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the relevant physiological transition for the chaperone is expected to be between the nucleotide-bound form and the unliganded form. We therefore compared the structure of the unliganded form of GRP94-(69-337Δ41) with that of the open and closed conformations. The NECA-bound GRP94-(69-337Δ41) complex (PDB code 1U2O) was used as a representative closed complex, although similar results hold when the radicicol or geldanamycin-GRP94 complexes are used as well. We used distance difference matrix analysis (25Richards F.M. Kundrot C.E. Proteins. 1988; 3: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) to align the structurally invariant regions of the unliganded protein with the open and closed conformations. As seen from the overlay of the open, closed, and unliganded structures in Fig. 3, unliganded GRP94 adopts a conformation that recapitulates the closed, or inhibitor-bound form (Figs. 3, A and C). The root mean square deviation between all Cα atoms in the NECA-bound closed form and the unliganded form is 0.26 Å. Although solved at lower resolution, the structure of the intact, unliganded N-domain also adopts the closed conformation, indicating that the presence or absence of the charged linker does not affect the response to ligand binding. This suggests that in GRP94 the effect of high affinity inhibitors such as NECA, geldanamycin, and radicicol is to fix the N-terminal domain in the unliganded, closed conformation and to disfavor the open conformation. Because only the open conformation exposes the N-domain dimer interface (19Immormino R.M. Dollins D.E. Shaffer P.L. Soldano K.L. Walker M.A. Gewirth D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46162-46171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the effect of “locking” the protein in the closed conformation is to prevent GRP94 quaternary interactions. Soaked-in Nucleotides Lead to an Intermediate Conformation of the N-domain—Although not yet observed experimentally, models of Hsp90 action posit that the helix 4/5 lid element closes over the nucleotide binding cavity in response to nucleotide occupancy (17Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4383-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two surprising observations, however, arose from the co-crystal structures of the ATP-, ADP-, and AMP-bound forms of GRP94 that distinguish GRP94 from Hsp90. First, a large conformational shift was seen in helices 1, 4, and 5 in response to nucleotide binding (19Immormino R.M. Dollins D.E. Shaffer P.L. Soldano K.L. Walker M.A. Gewirth D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46162-46171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Second, these elements opened away from, rather than closed over, the binding cavity in response to the bound nucleotide. With regard to the first observation, modeling showed that potential clashes between the protein and the phosphates of the nucleotide could be relieved by moving the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-196 by as little as 1.7 Å away from the nucleotide. Instead of this modest rearrangement, however, the co-crystal structure of nucleotide-bound GRP94 revealed a 10.8-Å displacement of the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-196. This extraordinary motion of Gly-196 resulted in the large scale rearrangement of helices 1, 4, and 5, the incorporation of strand 1 into helix 1, and the exposure of an N-domain dimer interface. Because both the magnitude and the direction of these motions were unexpected and did not correspond to the Hsp90 model, we sought to see whether a change in the protein environment would yield a different outcome when nucleotides bound. In addition, we asked whether the motions we observed were the direct effect of nucleotide binding or whether nucleotides bound only to proteins that had first adopted the open conformation. To answer these questions we soaked ADP into stabilized crystals of unliganded GRP94-(69-337Δ41). We used crystals of this construct because they diffracted better than crystals of the intact N-domain. Because the protein was already incorporated into a crystal lattice before the introduction of nucleotide, any rearrangements of the protein in the soaked crystal would be due to nucleotide binding rather than selective trapping of conformational states that were compatible with a crystal lattice. The structure of the ADP-soaked GRP94 is shown in Fig. 4A. Nucleotide binding displaces the polyethylene glycol precipitant and the labile solvent molecules from the adenine binding cavity, and clear electron density was observed for the bound ADP (Fig. 2B). The soaked-in ADP ligand adopts the same compact conformation seen in the co-crystal structure of GRP94-ADP, and the soaked-in ligand makes the same direct- and solvent-mediated hydrogen bonds as in the co-crystallized complex. As in the co-crystallized complex, ligand-induced rotations around Gly-198 lead to the displacement of the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-196 fro"

Although EphB6 is expressed both in a variety of embryonic and adult tissues, biological functions of this receptor are largely unknown. In the present study, we examined the function of EphB6 in cell adhesion and migration. We demonstrated that EphB6 exerted biphasic effects in response to different concentrations of the ephrin-B2 ligand; EphB6 promoted cell adhesion and migration when stimulated with low concentrations of ephrin-B2, whereas it induced repulsion and inhibited migration upon stimulation with high concentrations of ephrin-B2. A truncated EphB6 receptor lacking the cytoplasmic domain showed monophasic-positive effects on cell adhesion and migration, indicating that the cytoplasmic domain is essential for the negative effects. EphB6 is constitutively associated with the Src family kinase Fyn. High concentrations of ephrin-B2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EphB6 through an Src family kinase activity. These results indicate that EphB6 can both positively and negatively regulate cell adhesion and migration, and suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor by an Src family kinase acts as the molecular switch for the functional transition.

Interaction between cell surface receptors that contain tyrosine kinase activity and their cognate ligands is one of the fundamental mechanisms by which metazoan cells communicate. Generally, ligand binding to receptor tyrosine kinases induces dimerization or oligomerization of receptor monomers, which leads to activation and potentiation of their intrinsic catalytic activity and phosphorylation of tyrosine residues. These phosphotyrosines serve as binding sites for cytoplasmic signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 and phosphotyrosine-binding domains (1Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of both receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases has been highly conserved throughout evolution and includes a set of invariant amino acid residues and consensus motifs that participate in the phosphotransfer reaction (2Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar, 3Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2295) Google Scholar). Through the identification of novel receptor tyrosine kinases, it has become apparent that some receptor tyrosine kinases have diverged to incorporate alterations in conserved amino acid residues in the kinase domain and to function as signal-transducing molecules that lack catalytic activity. These include ErbB3 (4Guy P.M. Platko J.V. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 5Kim G.J.

Despite the lack of kinase activity, these molecules can transduce extracellular signals across the plasma membrane and mediate biological functions. The best-studied example is the ErbB3 receptor of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, which plays crucial roles in development by heterodimerizing with kinase-active ErbB receptors and then modulating their ligand affinities and functions (1Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that a targeted gene disruption of Ryk in mouse causes cleft palate (16Halford M.M. Armes J. Buchert M. Meskenaite V. Grail D. Hibbs M.L. Wilks A.F. Farlie P.G. Newgreen D.F. Hovens C.M. Stacker S.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, the homolog of Ryk, Derailed, acts as a repulsive axon guidance receptor by interacting with Wnt5 (17Bonkowsky J.L. Yoshikawa S. O'Keefe D.D. Scully A.L. Thomas J.B. Nature. 1999; 402: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 18Yoshikawa S. Bonkowsky J.L. Kokel M. Shyn S. Thomas J.B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings indicate that kinase-defective receptor molecules have been conserved in evolution and play crucial roles in signaling for normal development. Eph receptors form the largest known subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases, and to date, the Eph subfamily contains 16 members in vertebrates (19Committee Eph Nomenclature Cell. 1997; 90: 403-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 20Menzel P. Valencia F. Godement P. Dodelet V.C. Pasquale E.B. Dev. Biol. 2001; 230: 74-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (see Eph nomenclature web site (cbweb.med.harvard.edu/eph-nomenclature/) for update). The Eph receptors interact with a family of ligands, ephrins. All the ephrins are membrane-attached, either via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (ephrin-A1-A6) or a transmembrane domain (ephrin-B1-B3). The Eph receptors are also grouped into two classes, EphA receptors (EphA1-A10) and EphB receptors (EphB1-B6). These groupings roughly correspond to the receptor-ligand interaction (i.e. ephrin-As show binding preference for EphA receptors, and ephrin-Bs for EphB receptors), although there is a wide variation in affinity within each group, and some interactions cross the group boundary. Eph receptors and ephrins have been implicated in many developmental processes, including axon guidance, synaptogenesis, embryonic compartmentation, and vascular development (21Flanagan J.G. Vanderhaeghen P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 309-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 22Frisén J. Holmberg J. Barbacid M.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1429-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The Eph-ephrin interaction has also been shown to regulate cell adhesion and migration. Although in most cases the Eph-ephrin interaction exerts repulsive or inhibitory functions, ephrins have been reported to have attractive or adhesive effects in several biological systems (25Stein E. Lane A.A. Cerretti D.P. Schoecklmann H.O. Schroff A.D. Van Etten R.L. Daniel T.O. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 26Gao P.P. Yue Y. Cerretti D.P. Dreyfus C.

Nature. 2000; 408: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms by which they can mediate differential functions remain to be elucidated. EphB6 was identified in efforts to clone novel receptor tyrosine kinases in mouse (28Gurniak C.B. Berg L.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 777-786PubMed Google Scholar) and in human (29Matsuoka H. Iwata N. Ito M. Shimoyama M. Nagata A. Chihara K. Takai S. Matsui T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), by a PCR-based screening and a low stringency library screening, respectively. Although the extracellular region of the EphB6 receptor shares all the structural features of other Eph family members, the cytoplasmic “kinase domain” has several critical amino acid substitutions and fails to show catalytic activity in vitro (28Gurniak C.B. Berg L.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 777-786PubMed Google Scholar, 29Matsuoka H. Iwata N. Ito M. Shimoyama M. Nagata A. Chihara K. Takai S. Matsui T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). EphB6 is highly expressed in the developing and adult nervous system and thymus and is expressed at low levels in other tissues, including heart, kidney, and liver. Several reports have demonstrated that EphB6 transduces signals and plays roles in T cell functions (30Freywald A. Sharfe N. Roifman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3823-3828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 31Freywald A. Sharfe N. Rashotte C. Grunberger T. Roifman C.M. J. Biol.

Tremblay J. Wu J. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1762-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but its biological functions in cellular behavior are still largely unknown. In the present study, we examined functions of EphB6 in cell adhesion and migration. We demonstrate that, upon stimulation with ephrin-B2, the kinase-defective EphB6 receptor exerts biphasic functions: EphB6 promotes cell adhesion and migration in response to low concentrations of ephrin-B2, whereas EphB6 induces repulsion and suppresses migration when stimulated with high concentrations of ephrin-B2. The cytoplasmic domain is essential for repulsion and inhibition of migration, because a truncated EphB6 that lacks the cytoplasmic domain promotes cell adhesion and migration in monophasic and dose-dependent manners. In addition, when exposed to high concentrations of ephrin-B2, EphB6 is tyrosine phosphorylated by an Src family kinase, which constitutively associates with the receptor. Our results indicate that the kinase-defective EphB6 receptor can regulate cell adhesion and migration by exerting both positive and negative effects and suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor may act as a switch on the functional transition from adhesion/attraction to de-adhesion/repulsion. Expression Constructs—The coding region of human EphB6 cDNA (nucleotide numbers 754-3819, GenBank™ accession number D83492 (29Matsuoka H. Iwata N. Ito M. Shimoyama M. Nagata A. Chihara K. Takai S. Matsui T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)) was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen) (pcDNA-EphB6). To express a truncated form of EphB6 (EphB6ΔC), the sequence that corresponds to most of the intracellular domain (amino acids 625-1021 (29Matsuoka H. Iwata N. Ito M. Shimoyama M. Nagata A. Chihara K. Takai S. Matsui T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 1The abbreviations used are: HEK, human embryonic kidney; AP, alkaline phosphatase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PDZ, PSD95/Dlg/ZO-1; PTB, protein tyrosine-binding; SH2, Src homology 2; SHIP-1, Src homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-1; PP2, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine; PP3, 4-amino-7-phenylpyrazol-[3,4-d]pyrimidine. 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). To establish cell lines that stably express the full-length or a truncated EphB6 receptor, cells were transfected with EphB6 expression constructs (pcDNA-EphB6 or pcDNA-EphB6ΔC) using FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) and cultured in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 (Sigma). G418-resistant clones were isolated by limited dilution and expanded. Multiple clones that show high expression of the receptors were established for each construct and used in the experiments described here. Establishment and maintenance of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell clones that express EphB6 (CHO-HEP cells) have been previously described (35Shimoyama M. Matsuoka H. Tamekane A. Ito M. Iwata N. Inoue R. Chihara K. Furuya A. Hanai N. Matsui T. Growth Factors. 2000; 18: 63-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Affinity Probe in Situ—Affinity probe in situ was performed as previously described (36Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Briefly, unfixed cells were incubated with ephrin-B2-AP or AP for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, cells were briefly fixed with 8% formaldehyde (3 min), washed, and heated for 60 min at 65 °C to inactivate endogenous APs. Ligand binding was detected by incubation with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Cell Adhesion Assays—Twenty-four-well plates were coated with serial dilutions of ephrin-B2-Fc or Fc in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 4 °C overnight, incubated with 2% BSA in PBS for 60 min, and then washed with DMEM. Cells were detached non-enzymatically with Cell Dissociation Solution (Sigma), washed twice with DMEM, and plated in triplicate onto wells in DMEM at 2 × 105 cells per well. Cells were then allowed to adhere for 30 min at 37 °C. For quantification, non-adhering cells were washed away, and the remaining adhering cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 10% methanol. The cells were then lysed and quantified. For observation of cell morphology, 1 × 105 cells per well were plated and cultured in DMEM containing 1% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C for 48 h. Cell Migration Assays—For the transfilter migration assay, the lower side of filter inserts (8-μm pore size, Transwell, Corning Inc.) was coated with different concentrations of ephrin-B2-Fc or Fc (R&D systems) in PBS containing 5 mg/ml BSA at 4 °C overnight, blocked with 2% BSA at room temperature for 60 min, and then washed with DMEM. 1 × 105 cells were placed in the top chamber, and allowed to migrate to the underside of the filter overnight in DMEM containing 1% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 10% methanol. After washing with water, the upper side of the filter was gently wiped, and the cells migrated and attached to the lower side were quantified and photographed. Each condition was tested in triplicate per experiment, and each experiment was repeated 3-5 times with consistent results. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were lysed in cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1× protease inhibitors mixture (Sigma), 2 mm sodium vanadate, 25 mm sodium fluoride). After 15 min of incubation on ice, the cell lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 × g to remove insoluble material. The lysates were pre-cleared by incubating with 50% slurry protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C. Primary antibody (anti-EphB6 antibody (R&D Systems) or anti-pan-Src antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)) was incubated with 50% protein G-Sepharose in PBS for 2 h at 4 °C. The antibody-protein G-Sepharose complex was then washed and mixed with the pre-cleared lysates and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. The immunocomplexes were pelleted by centrifugation, washed five times, and boiled for 3 min in Laemmli sample buffer. The lysates were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, 7.5% or 10% polyacrylamide gel). After transfer of the proteins onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, the filters were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, and treated with anti-EphB6 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1 μg/ml), or anti-pan-Src antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 0.2 μg/ml). For treatment with anti-Fyn antibody and the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10, the filters were blocked with 5% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline. Detection was performed using the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences). For inhibition of Src family kinases, cells were serum-starved for 20 h and pretreated with PP2, PP3 (Calbiochem) or Me2SO for 1 h, and then incubated in the culture medium containing ephrin-B2-Fc (12.5 μg/ml) for 30 min. Stable Expression of EphB6 in HEK293T Cells—To investigate the function of EphB6 in cellular behavior, we established HEK293T cells that stably express the full-length human EphB6 cDNA (HEK-EphB6 cells). High expression of EphB6 was detected by immunoblotting using antibody against the extracellular domain of EphB6 (Fig. 1A). HEK293T cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1 vector did not express detectable levels of EphB6 (Fig. 1A). In the studies described below, several independent clones that express a high level of EphB6 protein were used, and similar results were obtained. We first tested whether the EphB6 receptor expressed on HEK293T cells could interact with a cognate ligand. Although the Eph-ephrin interaction generally shows a high degree of promiscuity, ephrin-B2 has been shown to be the major ligand that binds to EphB6 with a significant affinity (37Munthe E. Rian E. Holien T. Rasmussen A. Levy F.O. Aasheim H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We therefore performed a ligand-binding assay using the extracellular domain of ephrin-B2 fused to an alkaline phosphatase (AP) tag (ephrin-B2-AP) as a probe (affinity probe in situ) (36Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Strong binding was observed on the surface of HEK-EphB6 cells (Fig. 1B), whereas neither parental HEK293T cells (data not shown) nor vector-transfected HEK293T cells (Fig. 1B) showed detectable binding activity. Control AP did not bind to either HEK-EphB6 cells or vector-transfected HEK293T cells (Fig. 1B). These results confirmed that in HEK-EphB6 cells the EphB6 receptor is expressed on cell surface and can interact with ephrin-B2. Immobilized Ephrin-B2 Exerts Dual Effects on HEK-EphB6 Cell Adhesion and Morphology—Previous studies have shown that interactions between kinase-active Eph receptors and ephrins can regulate cell adhesion (25Stein E.

Because EphB6 is catalytically inactive, we examined whether this receptor also has the ability to modulate cell adhesion. HEK-EphB6 cells were plated onto a substratum coated with different concentrations of ephrin-B2-Fc, and cell adhesion to substratum was measured 30 min later. As shown in Fig. 2A, HEK-EphB6 cells showed enhanced adhesion to the substratum coated with low concentrations of ephrin-B2-Fc. A dose-dependent promotion of cell adhesion was observed between 0.04 and 1.0 μg/ml ephrin-B2-Fc. When the ligand concentration was further increased (5.0-12.5 μg/ml), however, adhesion of HEK-EphB6 cells decreased to background levels. Immobilized Fc showed no effects on adhesion of HEK-EphB6 cells. Adhesion of vector-transfected control cells was not significantly affected by the ephrin-B2-Fc-containing substratum. In a separate set of experiments, ephrin-B2-Fc was pre-clustered with anti-human IgG-Fc and used for the assay. Pre-clustered ephrin-B2-Fc showed similar dual effects on adhesion of HEK-EphB6 cells (data not shown). This cell adhesion assay was performed under stringent conditions, in which the wells were pre-coated (blocked) with a high concentration of BSA, and the cells were allowed to attach to substratum for 30 min, so there was essentially no basal level of cell adhesion. We therefore could not determine whether high concentrations of ephrin-B2 in fact actively induced repulsion of HEK-EphB6 cells, or had no effect on cell adhesion. To verify this, HEK-EphB6 cells were incubated on ephrin-B2-Fc-coated substratum for 48 h, and the morphology of cells was observed (Fig. 2B). When the substratum was coated with 0.2 μg/ml ephrin-B2, HEK-EphB6 cells showed a slight spreading morphology compared with the cells on the control substratum. In contrast, the substratum coated with higher concentrations of ephrin-B2 caused dramatic changes to cell morphology; the cells became rounded and formed aggregates that protruded from the substratum, indicating that high concentrations of ephrin-B2 induced cell repulsion and de-adhesion from the substratum. Control cells plated on ephrin-B2-Fc-coated substratum showed no morphological changes. Ephrin-B2-Fc did not affect the rate of cell proliferation or cell death (data not shown). These results indicate that the EphB6 receptor exerts dual functions that lead to either cell adhesion/spreading or repulsion/rounding, depending on the ligand concentrations. Biphasic Effects of Ephrin-B2 on Migration of HEK-EphB6 Cells—Because many signaling molecules regulating cell adhesion are also involved in cell migration, we next examined if ephrin-B2 affects migration of HEK-EphB6 cells. To test this, we set up a transfilter assay system, in which a membrane with defined uniform pore size separates upper and lower chambers. The lower side of porous membrane was coated with different concentrations of ephrin-B2-Fc or Fc. HEK-EphB6 cells were then plated in the upper chamber and allowed to migrate to the lower side of the filter overnight. When the porous membrane was coated with different concentrations of ephrin-B2-Fc, HEK-EphB6 showed a biphasic behavior in cell migration (Fig. 3, A and B). In response to low concentrations (0.04-1.0 μg/ml) of ephrin-B2-Fc, migration of HEK-EphB6 cells was stimulated in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, when the cells were tested with high concentrations (5.0-12.5 μg/ml) of ephrin-B2-Fc, cell migration was significantly reduced. Remarkably, at 12.5 μg/ml ephrin-B2-Fc, fewer HEK-EphB6 cells migrated to the lower side of membrane compared with the control, indicating that ephrin-B2 inhibits HEK-EphB6 cell migration at this concentration. The Fc-coated membranes exerted no obvious effects on HEK-EphB6 cell migration, and migration of control HEK293T cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1 vector was not affected by ephrin-B2-Fc or Fc (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained in experiments in which the membranes were coated with pre-clustered ephrin-B2-Fc (data not shown). To investigate whether the effects of ephrin-B2-Fc on cell migration are dependent on cell types, we tested CHO cell lines that stably express EphB6 (CHO-HEP cells) (35Shimoyama M. Matsuoka H. Tamekane A. Ito M. Iwata N. Inoue R. Chihara K. Furuya A. Hanai N. Matsui T. Growth Factors. 2000; 18: 63-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) in this cell migration assay. As observed in HEK-EphB6 cells, migration of CHO-HEP cells was stimulated by lower concentrations of ephrin-B2-Fc, and inhibited by higher concentrations of ephrin-B2-Fc (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that the biphasic effect in cell migration represents a global function of EphB6 and is not restricted to a small subset of cell types. The biphasic response of HEK-EphB6 cells and CHO-HEP cells in the cell migration assay was consistent with the results of cell adhesion assay described above. Moreover, the ephrin-B2 concentrations at which the transition of effects (promotion to inhibition) was observed were comparable between the two assays (i.e. between 1 and 5 μg/ml). A Truncated EphB6 Receptor Exerts Monophasic Stimulatory Effects on Cell Adhesion and Migration—The results of the cell adhesion and migration assays suggest that EphB6 mediates two types of signaling (adhesion/attraction and de-adhesion/repulsion) in response to different concentrations of ephrin-B2. Because the EphB6 receptor is devoid of tyrosine kinase activity, we were next interested in whether the cytoplasmic domain of EphB6 is essential for mediating signals for the biphasic responses in cell adhesion/migration. To test this, we constructed a truncated form of EphB6 that lacks most of the cytoplasmic domain (EphB6ΔC). The cytoplasmic region of EphB6ΔC has only four amino acids and lacks all the known signaling motifs conserved among the Eph receptors, including the two juxtamembrane tyrosine residues that are the major autophosphorylation sites in kinase-active Eph receptors (42Ellis C.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2657-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells were stably transfected with an EphB6ΔC expression construct, and several independent clones were established (HEK-EphB6ΔC cells). As in HEK-EphB6 clones, expression and ligand binding activity of the truncated receptor were confirmed by immunoblotting and affinity probe in situ using ephrin-B2-AP, respectively (Fig. 4). HEK-EphB6ΔC cells were then tested for adhesion activity to ephrin-B2-coated substratum (Fig. 5A). At all concentrations of ephrin-B2 used in the assay, HEK-EphB6ΔC cells always showed a dose-dependent enhancement in cell adhesion. In striking contrast to HEK-EphB6 cells, cell adhesion of HEK-EphB6ΔC was not inhibited by high concentrations of ephrin-B2. After 48-h incubation, HEK-EphB6ΔC cells showed a spreading morphology not only at low concentrations, but also at high concentrations of ephrin-B2-Fc (Fig. 5B). Consistent with these results, in the transfilter assay, HEK-EphB6ΔC cells showed a monophasic and dose-dependent promotion of migration in response to ephrin-B2-Fc (Fig. 5, C and D), and inhibition of cell migration at high concentrations of ephrin-B2-Fc was not observed. The degree of cell migration induced by low concentrations of ephrin-B2-Fc was slightly lower than that observed for HEK-EphB6 cells, suggesting that the cytoplasmic domain may also be involved in signaling for stimulation of cell migration. These results indicate that the extracellular domain of EphB6 is capable of promoting cell adhesion and migration in response to low concentrations of ephrin-B2, but the cytoplasmic domain is essential for cell repulsion and inhibition of migration induced by high"

The preassembled glycan added to nascent chains is composed of 2 N-acetyl glucosamines, 9 mannoses, and 3 terminal glucose residues. Two glucose residues are rapidly trimmed by ER-resident glucosidases, and the generated monoglucosylated N-glycan directs association of the nascent polypeptide with the lectin chaperones calnexin (Cnx) and calreticulin (Crt) and with the glycoprotein-specific oxidoreductase ERp57 (2.Ellgaard L.

For most glycoproteins, transient association with Cnx, Crt, and ERp57 is not essential, but contributes to the efficiency of the maturation process. Although Cnx and Crt share the same ligand specificity, they bind a distinct set of polypeptides, possibly because the first is membrane-bound whereas the latter is soluble in the ER lumen. It has been shown in fact that Cnx binds to membrane-proximal glycans whereas Crt binds to glycans that emerge deeper into the lumen (7.Parodi A.J. Biochem.

Stamp G. Owen M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7398-7404Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). An unexpected recombination event resulted in the generation of a second mouse strain expressing a shorter version of Cnx (sCnx). Cnx-deficient mice and mice expressing sCnx were phenotypically identical. Directly after birth, their size, respiration, and feeding were normal. At 8–10 days after birth, they were one-third lighter than their littermates, and they progressively developed severe motor abnormalities. Most of the mice either died or had to be sacrificed within 4 weeks (16.Denzel A. Molinari M. Trigueros C. Martin J.E. Velmurgan S. Brown S. Stamp G. Owen M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7398-7404Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), showing the incapacity of Crt to fully replace Cnx activity. Because of severe breeding difficulties of the original Cnx-deficient strain, only the strain expressing sCnx was continued (16.Denzel A. Molinari M. Trigueros C. Martin J.E. Velmurgan S. Brown S. Stamp G. Owen M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7398-7404Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Here we made use of embryonic fibroblasts derived from these mice to better characterize the function of Cnx and Crt during protein folding. We first established that sCnx originated from an alternative splicing of the Cnx gene that removed several functional residues, thus selectively depleting cells of Cnx activity. No evidence of compensatory unfolded protein response (UPR) was found, indicating the lack of substantial protein-folding defects at the cellular level upon eradication of Cnx activity. Despite the fact that Crt and Cnx share the same specificity for monoglucosylated N-glycans, Crt did not normally associate with orphan Cnx substrates upon selective depletion of Cnx activity. Rather, enhanced association of nascent chains with BiP was observed. Three cellular Cnx substrates, the folding-competent BACE501 and the folding-defective BACE457 and BACE457Δ were expressed in cells selectively depleted of Cnx activity to determine whether the membrane-bound versus soluble status, the number of protein-bound N-glycans, or the substrate folding competence affected the capacity of Crt to associate with orphan Cnx substrates. None of these specific Cnx substrates associated with Crt upon eradication of Cnx activity. Crt did associate with orphan Cnx substrates only in virus-infected cells and, preferentially, with orphan Cnx substrates of viral origin. These results showed an intriguing diversity among cellular protein and viral proteins expressed in infected cells in the use of and in the dependence on the Cnx/Crt chaperone system. Cell Lines, Transient Transfections, and Viral Infections—wt and S-CNX mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal calf serum/penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.). For infections, cells were plated in 6-cm Petri dishes to 70–80% confluence and incubated for 30–60 min at room temperature with the selected virus diluted to 30 plaque-forming units per cell in RPMI/0.2% bovine serum albumin, pH 6.8. The inoculum was replaced with cell culture medium, and incubation proceeded for 4 h. Cells were then metabolically labeled. For transfections, cells plated at 90% confluence were transfected with BACE expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction for adherent cells and as described in Ref. 17.Paganetti P. Calanca V. Galli C. Stefani M. Molinari M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar. Metabolic Labeling, Preparation of Cell Extracts, Immunoprecipitations, and EndoH Treatments—Virus-infected (4 h after infection) or transiently transfected cells (17 h after transfection) were starved for 30 min in Met/Cys-free medium, pulsed for 10 min with 150 μCi of [35S]Met/Cys in 1 ml of starvation medium/dish and chased for the times indicated in the figures with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5 mm cold Met/Cys. Postnuclear supernatants were prepared by solubilization of cells in 800 μl/dish of ice-cold 2% CHAPS in Hepes buffer saline, pH 6.8, containing 20 mm ice-cold N-ethylmaleimide, protease inhibitors (HBS), and 10 units of apyrase/dish (Sigma) to rapidly deplete cellular ATP for anti-BiP immunoprecipitations. Cell extracts were prepared by 10 min of centrifugation at 10,000 × g and analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitations were performed by adding protein A beads (Sigma, 1:10 w/v swollen in HBS) and the selected antibody to the cell extracts. Incubations were for 1–4 h in a cold room. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with HBS/0.5% CHAPS and resuspended in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Gels were exposed to BioMax (Kodak) films and scanned with an Agfa scanner. The influenza virus strain X-31 was a kind gift from J. Brunner. Antibodies were kind gifts from A. Helenius (calnexin and HA), I. Braakman (PDI), T. Wileman (ERp57), J. C. Perriard (VSV G protein), W. Nauseef (calreticulin), and P. Paganetti (BACE). Antibody to BiP is commercially available (StressGen). The plasmids for BACE and for VSV G protein expression were kind gifts from P. Paganetti and K. Ueberla, respectively. For EndoH treatment, the selected glycoprotein was immunoisolated from the cell extracts with specific antibody and denatured before incubation for 1 h at 37 °C with 1 milliunit of EndoH (Roche Applied Science) in HBS-0.5% CHAPS. Immunoblotting—Cells were washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 2% CHAPS. Equal amounts of proteins were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were decorated with antibodies to selected ER chaperones and stained with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Immune complexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (LAS system). Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For indirect immunofluorescence, MEF were plated 24 h before the experiment on alcian bluetreated glass cover slips, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed at room temperature for 20 min in serum-free medium (SFM)-Hepes containing 3.7% formaldehyde. Cells were washed twice in SFM-Hepes and twice with phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.05% saponin (PS) for 15 min. Cells were incubated with primary antibody diluted in PS for 45 min, washed 15 min with PS, and then incubated with conjugated secondary antibody diluted in PS for 30 min. Cells were rinsed with PS, then with water, and mounted in Mowiol. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—1.2 × 106 wt or S-CNX MEF were plated in 6-cm dishes. After 12 h, cells were lysed in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and RNA isolated according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Two micrograms of RNA were used for cDNA production by SuperScriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) primed by oligo(dT) (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed using TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) with Cnx-specific primers: Forw (atggaagggaagtggttactgtgt) and Rev (cccggacat gtgagtcggaggcttccatttgccctt). Gene sequencing was performed on an ABI Prism 310 instrument (Applied Biosystems). Characterization of sCnx—We first assessed intracellular expression and localization of sCnx by indirect immunofluorescence of semipermeabilized cells. sCnx conserved the N-terminal ER-targeting signal sequence and the C-terminal ER retention motif of full-length Cnx, because it co-localized with the ER marker BiP (Fig. 1A). Replacement of Cnx with sCnx did not affect cell viability and did not trigger a compensatory up-regulation of other ER-resident proteins such as BiP, PDI, ERp57, or Crt (Fig. 1B) showing that MEF expressing sCnx (S-CNX MEF) were not under debilitating ER stress. Analysis of sCnx transcripts (see “Experimental Procedures”) revealed a deletion of 417 base pairs (Fig. 1C), from base 307 to 725, because of excision of the Cnx exons four, five, and six (Fig. 1D). The gene product was characterized by the substitution G103V, and by the deletion of 139 residues (Lys104–Leu242) (Fig. 1E) resulting in faster electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 1B). Among the residues deleted are those involved in glucose binding that mediates association of Cnx with substrates (Tyr165, Lys167, Tyr186, Met189, and Asp217) (18.Schrag J.D. Bergeron J.J. Li Y. Borisova S. Hahn M. Thomas D.Y. Cygler M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 633-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), two cysteines involved in a surface-exposed disulfide bond required for substrate binding (Cys161 and Cys195), and the conserved Asp118 involved in the coordination of a calcium ion. Thus, deletion of the Cnx glycan binding site and of other residues possibly involved in maintenance of the native Cnx architecture did not affect cell viability, ER morphology, and did not trigger a UPR in cultured cells (Fig. 1). However, it did cause the same phenotypic alteration at the organism level as deletion of Cnx (16.Denzel A. Molinari M. Trigueros C. Martin J.E. Velmurgan S. Brown S. Stamp G. Owen M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7398-7404Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). sCnx Does Not Associate with Newly Synthesized Glycoproteins—We next determined whether sCnx binds to newly synthesized proteins in the ER. wt and S-CNX cells were pulsed for 10 min with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine and chased for 0–60 min with unlabeled amino acids. Detergent extracts were immunoprecipitated with antibody raised to the cytosolic tail of Cnx and of sCnx (Fig. 2A). Several labeled cellular proteins coprecipitated with Cnx. Most of these proteins were chased away in 60 min, indicating that they were Cnx substrates that associated transiently with the ER lectin (Fig. 2A, wt). Deletion of the 139 residues upon alternative splicing of the Cnx gene abolished association of labeled cellular polypeptides with sCnx (Fig. 2A, S-CNX). Calreticulin Does Not Normally Associate with Orphan Calnexin Substrates—Cnx and Crt associate with a wide array of substrates because they bind monoglucosylated N-glycans, which are transiently exposed by all glycosylated polypeptides expressed in the ER (19.Hammond C.

To verify if Cnx inactivation resulted in changes in Crt specificity, acquiring novel substrates, the detergent extracts of wt and of S-CNX cells were immunoprecipitated with Crt-specific antibodies (Fig. 2B). The arrowhead (also shown in C) shows the only Cnx substrate that clearly associates more abundantly with Crt upon deletion of Cnx activity. Thus, analysis of the immunoprecipitates did not reveal significant differences in Crt-associated polypeptides in wt versus S-CNX cells. More specifically, there was no indication that Crt acquired new substrates upon selective depletion of Cnx activity (Fig. 2B). To better analyze this, wt and S-CNX MEF were pulse-labeled, chased for 3 min, detergent-solubilized, and Cnx and Crt immunoprecipitates were analyzed in the same gel (Fig. 2C). In wt cells, the pattern of cellular proteins associating with Cnx (Fig. 2C, lane 1) and Crt (lane 2) was only partially overlapping. Cnx associates with newly synthesized proteins of all sizes, whereas Crt associates preferentially with larger polypeptides. The black lines in Fig. 2C show a selection of 14 labeled polypeptides of molecular masses between 30 and 100 kDa that associate with Cnx but not with Crt in wt cells. None of these Cnx substrates were found to associate with Crt upon Cnx inactivation (lane 3). Thus, most cellular Cnx substrates remain inaccessible to Crt upon selective eradication of Cnx activity. Lanes 4–6 in Fig. 2C are controls showing that deletion of Cnx activity prevents substrate association (lane 4) and that cell incubation with the glucosidase inhibitor castanospermine, which prevents trimming of N-glycans to the monoglucosylated form, substantially inhibits association of newly synthesized polypeptides with Cnx and Crt (lanes 5 and 6, respectively). Association of newly synthesized polypeptides with Crt was unaffected by Cnx inactivation. However, this was not true for substrate association with the other abundant ER chaperone BiP/GRP78. This was significantly increased, especially at early chase times (0 and 5 min of chase, Fig. 2D), indicating increased association of BiP with nascent chains upon Cnx inactivation. Overall, substrate association with BiP and with Crt remained transient in S-CNX cells. Together with the findings reported above (depletion of Cnx did not trigger UPR and viability of S-CNX cells was normal), this was a further indication that (most) newly synthesized cellular proteins remained folding-competent upon selective deletion of Cnx activity. Association with ER Chaperones and Maturation of β-Secretase in wt Cells and in Cells Expressing sCnx—Unbiased analysis of labeled cellular proteins (Fig. 2) did not show the dramatic increase of Crt-associated radioactivity that would be expected if Crt replaces Cnx and would associate with orphan Cnx substrates upon Cnx inactivation. We next specifically tested the competence of Crt to associate with selected cellular Cnx substrates and analyzed whether membrane-bound versus soluble status or extent of N-glycosylation made a difference. To this end, three variants of human BACE were individually transfected in the two cell lines. BACE457Δ is a soluble, diglycosylated protein, and BACE457 and BACE501 are type I membrane proteins with 2 and 4 N-glycans, respectively. BACE457Δ and BACE457 are folding-incompetent and are eventually degraded from the ER (25.Molinari M. Calanca V. Galli C. Lucca P. Paganetti P.

Recombinant BACE457Δ and BACE457 became major Cnx (black lines in lane 3, Fig. 3, A and B, respectively) and BiP substrates in transiently transfected wt MEF (lane 7). Both glycoproteins did not associate with Crt (lane 5). BACE501 associated abundantly with Cnx and BiP (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 7, respectively) and weakly with Crt (Fig. 3C, lane 5). As is shown for endogenous glycoproteins (Fig. 2), sCnx did not associate with the recombinantly expressed BACE variants (Fig. 3, A–C, lane 4) and Crt did not associate with the BACE variants even after deletion of Cnx activity (Fig. 3, A–C, compare lane 5 with 6). Instead, normalization for the slightly lower expression level of the recombinant proteins in S-CNX MEF revealed a moderate increase of BiP binding. Altogether, the data shown in Figs. 2 and 3 confirmed the clear distinction between Cnx and Crt substrates. Furthermore, the data show that orphan Cnx substrates remain inaccessible to Crt even upon eradication of Cnx activity, no matter whether the substrate protein is membrane-bound (BACE457 and BACE501), soluble (BACE457Δ), weakly glycosylated (BACE457 and BACE457Δ) or more heavily glycosylated (BACE501), folding-competent (BACE501), or folding-incompetent (BACE457 and BACE457Δ). We next determined whether selective depletion of Cnx activity affected maturation of BACE501. Native BACE501 is released from the ER and is subject to complex glycosylation in the Golgi that decreases electrophoretic mobility and renders BACE501 N-glycans EndoH-resistant (28.Huse J.T.

Both the molecular mass increase and the acquisition of EndoH resistance, as a further estimate of the rate of BACE501 export from the ER, occurred with similar efficiency and kinetics in wt and S-CNX MEF (Fig. 3D). SFV Glycoproteins Associate More Abundantly with Calreticulin in S-CNX Cells—Analysis of cellular polypeptides showed that the substrate specificity of Crt did not change upon Cnx depletion. We next analyzed the fate of four viral envelope glycoproteins that served as models in the past years to elucidate functioning of the ER folding machinery: the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, Ref. 30.Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), the hemagglutinin (HA) of the influenza virus (20.Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 31.Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2961-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and E1 and p62 of the Semliki forest virus (SFV, Ref. 32.Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 2000; 288: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Cells were infected with SFV 4 h before pulse-chase analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”). Folding of SFV glycoproteins E1 and p62 involves transient interaction with BiP, Cnx, Crt, PDI, and with the oxidoreductase ERp57 (33.Molinari M. Helenius A. Nature. 1999; 402: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Native E1/p62 heterodimers leave the ER and transit through the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane. Infection of wt and S-CNX MEF with SFV shuts down synthesis of cellular proteins. During the pulse, therefore, radioactivity is only incorporated in viral polypeptides, and analysis of cell lysates in nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels only shows the viral glycoproteins E1 and p62 expressed in the ER, E2 generated by a convertase-mediated cleavage of p62 in the Golgi, and the viral capsid (C) expressed in the host cell cytosol (Fig. 4A). Conversion of p62 in E2 determines the rate of SFV glycoprotein maturation and was slightly accelerated in S-CNX cells (Fig. 4A). In wt MEF SFV glycoproteins transiently associated with Cnx (Fig. 4B) and Crt (Fig. 4C). The ERp57-containing mixed disulfides, formed as transient intermediates of the oxidative folding process (33.Molinari M. Helenius A. Nature. 1999; 402: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), were equally distributed in the Cnx- and Crt-bound fractions, because ERp57 forms functional complexes with both ER lectins (wt in Fig. 4, B and C, respectively). In S-CNX cells, viral glycoproteins and mixed disulfides did not co-precipitate with sCnx and associated more abundantly, but still transiently, with Crt (S-CNX, Fig. 4, B and C, respectively). After a 72-min chase, in wt cells, a significant amount of viral proteins was still associated with Cnx and Crt; upon depletion of Cnx activity, release from Crt was slightly faster. Thus, maturation of SFV glycoproteins progressed normally without Cnx. Unlike the cellular proteins previously investigated, SFV glycoproteins did associate more abundantly with Crt in the absence of functional Cnx. Association with ER Chaperones and Maturation of VSV G Protein in wt Cells and in Cells Expressing Non-functional Calnexin—We next analyzed the behavior of a glycoprotein considered a classic Cnx substrate with undetectable association with Crt in wt cells, the VSV G protein (9.Peterson J.R. Ora A. Van P.N. Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 30.Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). wt and S-CNX MEF were infected with VSV 4 h before pulse-chase analysis. Oxidative folding of the VSV G protein is sequentially assisted by BiP and Cnx (30.Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Acquirement of the native structure is monitored by following the formation of the native B2 epitope with the specific monoclonal antibody I14 (34.Doms R.W. Ruusala A. Machamer C. Helenius J. Helenius A. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Here we made use of I14 to compare the kinetics of G protein maturation in the two cell lines by pulling down from detergent extracts prepared after several chase times the fraction of native G protein. The amount of I14 reactive-labeled G protein increased at the same rate in both cell lines to about 20 min of chase, and then weakly decreased, again with similar kinetics after the 40 min chase, upon release from cells of viral particles containing labeled G protein (Fig. 5A and data not shown). Consistently, there was no difference, if any a slight acceleration in S-CNX cells, in the rate at which the G protein acquired EndoH-resistant glycans (Fig. 5B). Thus, as for the proteins tested above, maturation of VSV G protein was not affected by Cnx depletion, even though in wt cells, Cnx is the lectin chaperone of choice for the G protein. We next determined whether in the case of the G protein Crt did intervene during folding in S-CNX MEF.

Here we focus on the role of class IA phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and specific phosphoinositides in the steps of GLUT4 arrival and fusion with the membrane, using L6 muscle cells expressing GLUT4myc. To this end, we detected the availability of the myc epitope at the cell surface or intravesicular spaces and of the cytosol-facing C-terminal epitope, in cells and membrane lawns derived from them. We observed the following: (a) Wortmannin and LY294002 at concentrations that inhibit class IA PI 3-kinase reduced but did not abate the C terminus gain, yet the myc epitope was unavailable for detection unless lawns or cells were permeabilized, suggesting the presence of GLUT4myc in docked, unfused vesicles. Accordingly, GLUT4myc-containing vesicles were detected by immunoelectron microscopy of membranes from cells pretreated with wortmannin and insulin, but not insulin or wortmannin alone. (b) Insulin caused greater immunological availability of the C terminus than myc epitopes, suggesting that C terminus unmasking had occurred. Delivering phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) to intact cells significantly increased lawn-associated myc signal without C terminus gain. Conversely, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) increased the detection of C terminus epitope without any myc gain. We propose that insulin regulates GLUT4 membrane arrival, fusion, and C terminus unmasking, through distinct phosphoinositides. PI(3,4,5)P3 causes arrival and fusion without unmasking, whereas PI3P causes arrival and unmasking without fusion.

Insulin promotes the uptake of glucose into muscle and fat tissues through a rapid gain in surface-bound glucose transporters (1.Cushman S.W. Wardzala L.J. J. Biol.

Insulin changes this steady-state resulting in a net gain in surface GLUT4 (4.James D.E. Brown R. Navarro J. Pilch P.F.

Of significance, insulin resistance and diabetes are accompanied by defective GLUT4 gain at the plasma membrane of muscle and fat cells (9.Kahn B.B. Simpson I.A. Cushman S.W. J. Clin.

Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1180-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar).It is well established that signaling from class IA phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase is required for the insulin-dependent net gain in surface GLUT4 (12.Cheatham B.

Biol. 2002; 12: 1871-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), but the specific step(s) in GLUT4 cycling that are regulated are not elucidated. We have recently shown that class IA PI 3-kinase is required for the insulin-dependent acceleration of GLUT4 transit through the recycling endosome (16.Foster L.J. Li D. Randhawa V.K. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44212-44221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A second input of class IA PI 3-kinase in muscle cells is the spatial-temporal actin remodeling and its possible contribution to segregating specific signaling molecules (17.Khayat Z.A. Tong P. Yaworsky K. Bloch R.J. Klip A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 279-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Patel N. Rudich A. Khayat Z.A. Garg R. Klip A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4611-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether fusion of insulin-sensitive GLUT4 vesicles with the plasma membrane is a regulated step, nor which phosphoinositides participate in this event. Indeed, class II PI 3-kinase C2α is also activated by insulin (19.Brown R.A. Domin J. Arcaro A. Waterfield M.D. Shepherd P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14529-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The major product of class IA PI 3-kinase in vivo is PI(3,4,5)P3 (20.Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar, 21.Ruderman N.B. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 14529-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) is PI3P, whereas both enzymes can lead to the formation of PI 3,4-bisphosphate.Here we implement the simultaneous detection of exofacially and cytosolically facing epitopes of GLUT4myc to score the arrival and fusion of GLUT4myc-containing vesicles at the plasma membrane of myotubes, and the effect of insulin, PI(3,4,5)P3, and PI3P, in these events. An myc epitope in the first exofacial loop of GLUT4myc would face the extracellular milieu in intact cells and the intravesicular space in adhered/docked vesicles, whereas the C terminus of the transporter would always face the cytosol. Epitopes were immunodetected in membrane lawns and in intact or permeabilized muscle cells. We show that wortmannin (100 nm) and LY294002 (25 μm) cause accumulation below the plasma membrane of unfused GLUT4-containing vesicles. These results suggest that class IA PI 3-kinase regulates the membrane fusion step, because class II PI 3-kinase-C2α is not affected by these doses of the inhibitors (22.Domin J. Pages F. Volinia S. Rittenhouse S.E. Zvelebil M.J. Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the C terminus of GLUT4myc was more available for antibody recognition after insulin action, suggesting unmasking of this epitope in response to the hormone. Carrier delivery of PI(3,4,5)P3 caused significant GLUT4myc arrival and membrane fusion while barely allowing C-terminal detection. Conversely, PI3P caused GLUT4myc arrival and C-terminal exposure but not fusion. We propose that insulin regulates GLUT4 membrane arrival, fusion, and C-terminal unmasking, through distinct phosphoinositides.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Constructs—PI(3,4,5)P3, PI3P, PI(4,5)P2, and carrier (neomycin) were from Echelon Biosciences Inc. (Salt Lake City, UT). Monoclonal (9E10) and polyclonal (A-14) anti-c-myc antibodies, polyclonal (H-61) antibody against the intracellular loop region (amino acids 230-290) of GLUT4, and polyclonal (N-20) antibody sc1606 against the first exofacial loop region of GLUT4 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit anti-GLUT4 anti-serum was raised to the 12 C-terminal residues of GLUT4 (23.Sargeant R.J. Paquet M.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody against caveolin was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Enhanced green fluorescent protein fused to mycGLUT4 (GLUT4myc-eGFP), a kind gift from Dr. J. Pessin (SUNY, Stoneybrook, NY), was subcloned into pcDNA3 (24.Shigematsu S. Khan A.H. Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Cell Culture, cDNA Transfections, and Phosphoinositide Delivery—L6 rat myoblasts stably expressing GLUT4 with an exofacial myc epitope (L6-GLUT4myc) and L6-wild-type myoblasts were differentiated into myotube monolayers as described (25.Kishi K. Muromoto N. Nakaya Y. Miyata I. Hagi A. Hayashi H. Ebina Y. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 550-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 26.Ueyama A. Yaworsky K.L. Wang Q. Ebina Y. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E572-E578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, differentiating L6-wild-type myotubes were transfected with 3 μg of GLUT4myc-eGFP cDNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as specified by the manufacturer, and analyzed 48 h post-transfection. Distinct phosphatidylinositol phosphates and carrier (neomycin) were prepared and applied to cells essentially as described previously (27.Sweeney G. Garg R.R. Ceddia R.B. Li D. Ishiki M. Somwar R.

Neomycin was used as carrier to deliver the phosphatidylinositol phosphates. No effect of neomycin alone was observed on either glucose uptake or GLUT4myc surface levels (27.Sweeney G. Garg R.R. Ceddia R.B. Li D. Ishiki M. Somwar R. Foster L. Neilsen P.O. Prestwich G.D. Rudich A. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32233-32242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Similarly, we did not observe an effect of neomycin treatment alone on the various GLUT4 traffic events examined in this study.Immunodetection of GLUT4myc on Plasma Membrane Lawns—Plasma membrane lawns from L6-myotubes were prepared by modification of a protocol developed for 3T3-L1 adipocytes (28.Sweeney G.

Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were serum-starved for 4 h then subjected to the diverse pretreatments or stimuli at 37 °C for the indicated time periods (the times chosen were those yielding a maximal response to each stimulus). Cells were then placed on ice, washed twice in ice-cold PBS (pH 7.5) and incubated with ice-cold hypotonic swelling buffer (23 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5) 3 times for 2 min. Cells were then sonicated 3 times for 2 s on ice in sonication buffer (70 mm KCl, 30 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) using a Hert System sonicator (Misonix Inc., Farmingdale, NY), at 30% output. Lawns were fixed with 4% (v/v) para-formaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 15 min, and the reaction was quenched with 0.1 m glycine in PBS for 10 min. Intact lawns were used to detect cell surface- and cytosol-exposed epitopes. To detect intra-vesicular myc epitopes, fixed lawns were permeabilized for 15 min at room temperature with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Where indicated, lawns were incubated with PBS, PBS supplemented with 150 or 500 mm NaCl, or PBS supplemented with 650 mm LiCl but without NaCl for 7 min on ice before or after fixation. Following these steps, lawns were washed quickly three times with PBS and, depending on the primary antibody, blocked with 5% (v/v) goat serum or 3% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Lawns were labeled for 1 h at room temperature or 7 h at 4 °C with primary antibodies (monoclonal or polyclonal anti-myc, 2 μg/ml; polyclonal anti-C terminus of GLUT4, 1:200; polyclonal anti-cytosolic loop GLUT4, 4 μg/ml; polyclonal anti-exofacial loop GLUT4, 4 μg/ml; polyclonal anti-caveolin, 1.5 μg/ml) and for 45 min with secondary antibodies (A488-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit or anti-goat IgGs, 10 μg/ml; Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit or anti-goat IgGs, 10 μg/ml) at room temperature, as indicated. Coverslips were washed twice with PBS and mounted using Dako mounting solution. Lawns from eGFP-GLUT4myc-transfected L6-wild-type cells were treated with or without insulin and labeled with monoclonal anti-myc antibody (2 μg/ml) followed by Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (10 μg/ml).Immunofluorescence of Rounded-up L6-GLUT4myc Myoblasts—L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts pretreated for 20 min with or without 100 nm wortmannin at 37°C were detached from the substratum using Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS at 37 °C. During re-attachment of cells to glass coverslips (10 min), they were left untreated or treated with insulin and/or wortmannin at 37°C as indicated. Cells were then fixed with PFA and processed for epitope detection in intact cells, or cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 as described previously (16.Foster L.J. Li D. Randhawa V.K. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44212-44221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Where indicated, L6 myoblast monolayers treated with or without 100 nm insulin for 10 min at 37 °C were used to quantify the total cellular signal of immunodetectable myc or C terminus epitopes, after fixation with 4% PFA and permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100. Then cells were immunolabeled with monoclonal anti-myc (2 μg/ml) or polyclonal anti-C terminus (1:200) antibody followed by A488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (10 μg/ml) or Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (10 μg/ml), respectively. Quantitative analysis of GLUT4 labeled by anti-myc and/or anti-C terminus antibody at the periphery of rounded-up cells was performed by blind counting of at least 300 cells per condition. The number of the positive cells was expressed as a percentage of the total cells.Confocal Microscopy Image Acquisition, Quantitation, and Statistical Analysis—Images were obtained using a Zeiss Axiovert 100M laser scanning confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510, Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) at room temperature using a ×100 objective at the same gain setting unless indicated otherwise. The gain detector was set using cells or plasma membrane lawns labeled with only secondary antibody and images were analyzed using Image software (National Institutes of Health). Lawns were individually outlined, and pixel intensity within each lawn was determined then expressed as intensity per unit area. Background intensity was determined using areas outside of lawns and was subtracted from each reading. At least 50 plasma membrane lawns were examined for each experimental condition. Results are reported as -fold values relative to the indicated control condition in each figure. Statistical analysis was performed using the paired Student's t test or ANOVA with Turkey's multiple comparisons (Graph-Pad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Where no error bars are present, the values were too small to show on the columns (except for conditions assigned a value of 1.0).Detection of GLUT4myc C Terminus by Immunoelectron Microscopy—The method of (30.Parpal S.

Faseb J. 2002; 16: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) for immunodetection of GLUT4 on plasma membrane lawns by electron microscopy was used with slight modification. L6 myoblasts differentiated into myotubes on Formvar-coated nickel grids (300 mesh) were serum-deprived, then treated with vehicle (Me2SO) or 100 nm wortmannin for 20 min prior to 100 nm insulin (10 min) at 37°C. Lawns were generated as described above from cells grown on coverslips, fixed with 4% PFA and 0.05% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and blocked with 2% goat serum in PBS. Detection was preceded with C terminus GLUT4 antibody (20 μg/ml) in PBS containing 2% goat serum (60 min), followed by 6 nm-gold-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:25 dilution, 60 min). Lawns were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde for 10 min followed by 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 10 min and washed with PO4 buffer three times for 2 min each followed by washing with dH2O for 2 min. Lawns were stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate for 10 min prior to dehydration with ethanol. Finally lawns were dried with a critical point dryer CPD 030 (Bal-Tec, Liechtenstein). Transmission electron microscopy examination was done with a Tecnai 20 at room temperature (FEI, Hillsboro, OR).RESULTSThe experimental premise of this study is that epitopes on different regions of GLUT4myc can be exploited to determine whether GLUT4myc is fully inserted into the plasma membrane, or whether it lies in vesicles adhered/docked to the cytosolic leaflet of the membrane. The myc epitope inserted between transmembrane helices 1 and 2 is expected to face the extracellular milieu when fully fused with the membrane, or the intravesicular space of vesicles docked onto the membrane. Plasma membrane lawns that would retain docked but unfused vesicles would not have the vesicular myc epitope available for antibody decoration unless the vesicles are permeabilized with detergent once the lawns are generated. Conversely, the last 15 amino acids of the C terminus end or the large cytosolic loop between helices 6 and 7 of the transporter would be available for antibody decoration whether GLUT4myc is inserted into the plasma membrane or present on docked vesicles. The availability of the C terminus or cytosolic antigens for antibody recognition on membrane lawns would, however, be affected by endogenous proteins that might bind to these sites. In this case, high salt or other chaotropic agents that might remove the putative bound proteins would increase C terminus (or cytosolic loop) antigenicity. Hence, differences between the relative gains in antibody-accessible myc and the C terminus (or cytosolic loop) epitopes in lawns from control and insulin-stimulated cells would suggest differences in the status of GLUT4myc at the plasma membrane.Like in skeletal muscle (11.Zierath J.R.

Fig. 1 shows that exposing lawns from wild-type cells to monoclonal anti-myc antibody followed by Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG did not produce any fluorescent signal. Under the same settings of confocal fluorescence image acquisition, lawns from L6-GLUT4myc myotubes rendered a substantial signal that was higher in cells pretreated with insulin relative to basal state cells. Omission of the primary antibody eliminated the fluorescent signal (data not shown). Under the conditions of fluorescence acquisition used, the C-terminal epitope of wild-type myotubes was not detectable on membrane lawns. However, as expected, when the detector gain was markedly increased, a fluorescence signal was detected that was higher by 1.88 ± 0.55-fold, n = 5 (p < 0.05) by t test, in lawns from insulin-pretreated cells than from unstimulated cells assigned a value of 1.00. These results exclude the possibility that endogenous GLUT4 contributes to the gain of C terminus signal observed on lawns of GLUT4myc cells. This behavior is expected given that in L6-GLUT4myc myotubes GLUT4myc is expressed at almost 100-fold higher levels than the endogenous GLUT4 (which is low in these cells compared with muscle or adipose tissue) (34.Huang C. Somwar R. Patel N. Niu W. Torok D. Klip A. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2090-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We have previously determined that GLUT4myc traffic in L6-GLUT4myc cells is not affected by such overexpression (8.Li D. Randhawa V.K. Patel N. Hayashi M. Klip A. J. Biol.

Moreover, the t1/2 of GLUT4myc internalization is 3.5 min (similar to that of GLUT4 or IRAP in adipose cells) and insulin stimulates GLUT4myc recycling by 2-fold (comparable to the 2-fold gain in surface GLUT4 in parental L6 cells and mature skeletal muscle). Immunoprecipitated GLUT4myc-containing compartments via the GLUT4 C terminus (so-called GLUT4 vesicles) exclude GLUT1, and peroxide-dependent ablation of transferrin receptor compartments loaded with horse-radish peroxidase-transferrin spare 50% of GLUT4, 2V.

The plasma membrane content of caveolin was previously shown not to change in response to insulin (37.Teruel T. Hernandez R. Lorenzo M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2563-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The gain in myc epitope caused by insulin pretreatment of cells for 10 min was 1.62 ± 0.05-fold relative to the basal value (p < 0.005). Wortmannin (100 nm) and LY294002 (25 μm) completely inhibit class IA PI 3-kinase activation (12.Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell.

Remarkably, pretreatment of myotubes with 100 nm wortmannin abolished the insulin-dependent gain in myc epitope detection while preserving nearly half of the gain in GLUT4myc C terminus signal (1.42 ± 0.03-fold, p < 0.005 compared with unstimulated cells equally pretreated with wortmannin). As in the case of 100 nm wortmannin, pretreatment with 25 μm LY294002 abolished the insulin-dependent gain in myc epitope detection on membrane lawns, while preserving significant gain in C terminus epitope (1.40 ± 0.03-fold, p < 0.05 compared with unstimulated cells equally pretreated with LY294002) (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Wortmannin and LY294002 arrest GLUT4myc vesicle fusion with the membrane. L6-GLUT4myc myotubes were treated with vehicle (Me2SO) or 100 nm wortmannin (Wm) (A) or 25 μm LY 294002 (B) for 20 min as indicated followed by incubation without (basal) or with 100 nm insulin for 10 min. Plasma membrane lawns were prepared and processed for detection of myc epitope, C-terminal GLUT4, or caveolin by confocal fluorescence microscopy.

Such a situation would render GLUT4myc-containing vesicles docked onto plasma membrane lawns. Triton X-100 is typically used to permeabilize para-formaldehyde-fixed plasma- and endo-membranes by extracting lipids and allowing antibody penetration (38.Miozzari G.F. Niederberger P. Hutter R. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 90: 220-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined if Triton X-100 treatment changed the insulin-dependent gain in myc and C terminus epitopes on plasma membrane lawns from L6 myotubes pretreated with 100 nm wortmannin with and without insulin stimulation (Fig. 3). Triton X-100 did not affect the detection of either epitope in plasma membrane lawns from basal or insulin-treated cells. However, Triton X-100 revealed an insulin-dependent gain in myc epitope in lawns from cells pretreated with wortmannin plus insulin (1.36 ± 0.01-fold above basal cells pretreated with wortmannin, p < 0.005). By contrast, there was no change in the immunoreactivity of the C terminus upon Triton X-100 treatment of membrane lawns.Fig. 3Triton X-100 reveals latent myc epitope on plasma membrane lawns from wortmannin-pretreated, insulin-stimulated myotubes. L6-GLUT4myc myotubes were pretreated with vehicle or 100 nm wortmannin (Wm) for 20 min as indicated, followed by incubation without or with insulin (100 nm for 10 min). Plasma membrane lawns were then labeled and processed for detection of myc or C-terminal epitopes of GLUT4myc by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Where indicated, lawns were treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 after fixation (solid bars). The fluorescence intensity per lawn was quantified from at least 50 plasma membrane lawn pieces for each condition per experiment as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and is expressed as -fold change per unit area over the basal (mean ± S.E.) obtained fr"

The activity of the N-terminal truncated hTERT promoter, lacking the c-Myc recognition (E-box) region but containing multiple Sp1/Sp3 sites, was also significantly inhibited by C6-ceramide, indicating a role for ceramide in the regulation of Sp1/Sp3 function. Partial inhibition of Sp1 expression using small interfering RNA resulted in a significant inhibition of the hTERT promoter. Treatment with C6-ceramide inhibited the trans-activation function of overexpressed Sp1, whereas it induced the repressor effects of exogenous Sp3 on the hTERT promoter. The interaction between Sp1 and hTERT promoter DNA was significantly reduced in response to ceramide as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. In contrast, the promoter DNA-binding activity of Sp3 was slightly increased in response to C6-ceramide, resulting in the increased ratio of Sp3/Sp1 on the hTERT promoter, which was concomitant with the reduced recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the promoter. Furthermore, mutations of various Sp1/Sp3 recognition sequences significantly attenuated the activity of the promoter in the presence or absence of ceramide, demonstrating the importance of multiple Sp1/Sp3 recognition sites for the promoter activity. Mechanistically, the data demonstrated that C6-ceramide reduced the acetylation of Sp3 protein and partially blocked the activation of the hTERT promoter by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. The roles of endogenous long chain ceramide generated in response to gemcitabine in the inhibition of hTERT promoter activity and the regulation of Sp3 acetylation were also demonstrated.

All four members contain three zinc finger binding domains for DNA binding located at the C-terminal region and varying stretches of serine/threonine domains at the N-terminal region (23Suske G.

Sp1, Sp2, and Sp3 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas Sp4 is found mainly in neuronal tissues. Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 share a high homology in sequence, binding patterns, and structure. They contain activation and inhibitory domains, and Sp1 has an inhibitory domain located at the extreme N terminus, whereas Sp3 possesses an inhibitory domain located near the zinc finger domains. Sp2 is the least homologous of the family, and it binds with high affinity to GT-rich sequences of various promoters (23Suske G.

However, the role of Sp family proteins on ceramide-mediated regulation of the hTERT promoter has not been examined previously. In this study, we present data that show, for the first time, that treatment of A549 cells with C6-ceramide, and not its biologically inactive analog dihydro-C6-ceramide, results in the inhibition of the hTERT promoter activity by altering the functions of Sp1 and Sp3. The data show that whereas the overexpression of Sp1 enhances the promoter activity of hTERT, overexpression of Sp3 modulates its activity. More importantly, C6-ceramide blocks the trans-activation function of Sp1 and induces the repressor function of Sp3 on the promoter activity. Furthermore, results demonstrate that one of the mechanisms that regulate the activity of the hTERT promoter by ceramide involves the alterations of the ratio of Sp3/Sp1 bound to the hTERT promoter, leading to its inhibition. Mechanistically, the data reveal, for the first time, that modulation of the activity of the hTERT promoter in response to both exogenous and endogenous ceramides might be linked to the regulation of the acetylation state of Sp3 protein.

Transient Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assay—Transient co-transfection of A549 cells with pGL3-plasmids containing hTERT promoter sequences upstream of firefly luciferase and an expression vector containing β-galactosidase cDNA (Promega) were performed using Effectene (Qiagen) as we described previously (12Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C. Birbes H. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol.

After co-transfections for 24 h, cells were treated with or without ceramide for an additional 24 h, and luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer (Berthold) and was normalized to β-galactosidase activity obtained using the β-galactosidase assay system (Promega) as described by the manufacturer. Normalization of firefly luciferase activity was also performed using the cotransfection of Renilla luciferase containing plasmid with a thymidine kinase promoter (Promega). Sp1 and Sp3 Plasmids, siRNAs, and Transfections—The full-length human Sp1 and Sp3 cDNAs cloned in pCMV4 plasmid were kindly provided by Dr. Jon Horowitz (North Carolina State University). The siRNAs against Sp1 and Sp3 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and transfections of cells with siRNA molecules were performed using a Nucleofector transfection device and reagents (Amaxa) or Effectene (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturers. Mutagenesis of the Sp1/Sp3 Recognition Sites on hTERT Promoter DNA—Mutation of the Sp1/Sp3 binding sites found in the hTERT core promoter was performed by the generation of point mutations from the wild-type to a TTT motif. The point mutations were generated using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the mutant sequences were confirmed by direct sequencing at the DNA Sequencing Core Facility (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitation was performed by preclearing 100 μg of cell extract diluted in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.1% Nonidet P-40 or IGEPAL, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl) with Protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C with end-to-end rotation. Ten μg of primary antibodies, anti-Sp1 (sc-59G; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Sp3 (sc-644; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), were added for 60 min at 4 °C, and the protein-antibody complexes were pulled down using protein A/G-agarose beads for 60 min at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times sequentially with 500 μl of 1× phosphate-buffered saline, NETN, 0.1% SDS-NETN, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) with 0.5% IGEPAL. The agarose beads were then resuspended in 10 μl of 1× PBS and 10 μl of loading buffer. After incubation at 95 °C for 5 min, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE as described previously (3Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar), and the levels of acetylation and total Sp1 or Sp3 levels were examined by Western blot analysis. Primary antibodies anti-Sp1, anti-Sp3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Upstate Biotechnology), or anti-acetyl lysine (Upstate Biotechnology) were added at 1:1000 dilution in milk solution. Equal loading of proteins in Western blots was determined by measuring the nuclear isoform of actin (28Manelli-Oliveira R. Machado-Santelli G.M. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 115: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 29Fidlerova H. Masata M. Malinsky J. Fialova M. Cvackova Z. Louzecka A. Koberna K. Berezney R. Raska I. J.

The levels of nuclear lamina protein, lamin B, were detected using anti-lamin B antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The secondary antibodies, anti-goat and anti-rabbit (Jackson Immunochemicals), were used at a 1:2500 dilution. The proteins were visualized using ECL chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP was performed using a ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) on cells that were treated with and without C6-ceramide for 24 h. The proteins bound to DNA were cross-linked using formaldehyde at a final concentration of 1% for 20 min at room temperature. Then protein-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated using primary antibodies for Sp1 and Sp3 (as described above). After the reversal of the cross-links by heating to 65 °C for 4 h, the DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and precipitated by ethanol. Then the association of Sp1 and Sp3 with the hTERT promoter was measured by PCR using the Advantage GC Genomic PCR Kit (Clontech) with a final GC Melt concentration of 0.5 m. The primers used for the amplification of the core hTERT promoter region were 5′-GGTACCGACCCCCGGGTCCGCCCGGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAGCTTGCTGCCTGAAACTCGCGCCG-3′ (reverse). The thermocycler (Biometra) PCR program was as follows: 94 °C for 3 min, 68 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min (1 cycle); 30 cycles with 94 °C for 0.5 min, 68 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min; and 94 °C for 0.5 min, 68 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 5 min. The samples were run on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Measurement of Endogenous Ceramide Levels by High Performance Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy (LC/MS)—The endogenous ceramide levels in cellular fractions enriched in nuclei were measured by LC/MS as described previously (19Kraveka J.M. Li L. Bielawski J. Obeid L.M. Ogretmen B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 419: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The ceramide levels were normalized to total protein amounts of the extracts. Cellular fractions enriched in nuclei were prepared by suspending cell pellet in a sucrose buffer containing 300 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm NaF. The cellular suspension was incubated for 30 min on ice, and the cell membrane was broken with passing through an insulin syringe about 4–5 times. Then samples were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and nuclei were lysed using 1× CHAPS buffer on ice for 1 h followed by 4× freeze/thaw cycles. Then samples were cleared with centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses of the data were performed using Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Role of Ceramide in the Regulation of the Activity of hTERT Promoter—The inhibition of telomerase activity by ceramide at various concentrations for 24 h in A549 cells has been linked to decreased hTERT mRNA expression, which was due to the inactivation of its promoter (16Ogretmen B. Kraveka J.M. Schady D. Usta J. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32506-32514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). First, to confirm the role of ceramide in the regulation of hTERT promoter, A549 cells were transiently transfected with the pGL3 plasmid, which contains the core promoter region of hTERT, spanning –279 to +5 (Fig. 1A). Cells were then treated with the sub-IC50 concentration (12Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C. Birbes H. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24901-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) of C6-ceramide (at 10 μm for 24 h), and hTERT promoter activity was measured using luciferase assay in cell extracts as described under “Materials and Methods.” As seen in Fig. 1B, treatment of these cells with C6-ceramide for 24 h resulted in a significant decrease (about 40%) in the activity of hTERT promoter when compared with untreated controls. Next, to examine whether the inhibition of the hTERT promoter by C6-ceramide is specific, the effects of its biologically inactive analog, d-erythro-dihydro-C6-ceramide, on the activity of the promoter were determined. It was found that treatment with d-erythro-dihydro-C6-ceramide (10 μm for 24 h) did not have any significant effect on the activity of the hTERT promoter (Fig. 1B), showing that the inhibition of the hTERT promoter by ceramide is specific and not due to the presence of exogenous lipids in the media. Furthermore, to determine whether the results obtained using d-erythro-C6-ceramide were stereospecific, transfectants were also treated with l-erythro-C6-ceramide, and no change in the activity of the hTERT promoter was observed (Fig. 1B). Also, the effects of C6-ceramide on the activity of the SV40 promoter in A549 cells were examined, and as seen in Fig. 1C, treatment with ceramide did not have any significant effect on the activity of the SV40 promoter in these cells. These data show that the inhibition of hTERT promoter by C6-ceramide is not due to a general effect on the transcriptional machinery. Previously, a role for c-Myc in ceramide-induced inhibition of hTERT promoter was demonstrated (16Ogretmen B. Kraveka J.M. Schady D. Usta J. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32506-32514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, although there are six putative Sp1/Sp3 recognition sequences, roles of ceramide in Sp1/Sp3-dependent regulation of hTERT promoter had not been examined. Therefore, to assess the role of Sp1/Sp3 transcription factors in ceramide-mediated inhibition of hTERT promoter, another pGL3 reporter plasmid containing an N-terminal truncated hTERT promoter DNA cloned upstream of luciferase, which lacks the c-Myc recognition (E-box) sequence but contains several putative Sp1/Sp3 recognition sites, was used (see Fig. 1A). After transfections, luciferase activity was measured in lysates obtained from cells treated with 10 μm C6-ceramide for 24 h. The data showed that treatment of cells with ceramide also resulted in the inhibition of the activity of hTERT promoter lacking the E-box sequence about 50% (Fig. 1D), similar to the inhibition of the full-length hTERT core promoter by ceramide. These data suggest that ceramide plays a role in the regulation of Sp1/Sp3-dependent control of the activity of hTERT promoter, in addition to the regulation of c-Myc. Role of Sp1/Sp3 in Ceramide-induced Regulation of the hTERT Promoter—Since the hTERT core promoter contains several Sp1/Sp3 binding sites (see Fig. 1A), and ceramide significantly inhibited hTERT promoter with and without the E-box sequence, we hypothesized that ceramide might also play a role in the inhibition of hTERT promoter via regulating the activity of Sp1/Sp3 transcription factors. First, the role of Sp1 on the activity of hTERT promoter was examined using siRNA against Sp1. The partial inhibition of Sp1 expression, confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 2A, lower panel), resulted in a significant decrease in the activity of the hTERT promoter by about 60%, demonstrating that Sp1 plays an important role in the activity of the promoter. Interestingly, partial inhibition of the expression of Sp3 by siRNA also caused a slight decrease in the activity of the promoter (Fig. 2B). The expression levels of Sp3 in response to Sp3-specific siRNA as compared with scrambled siRNA were determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2B, lower panel, lanes 2 and 1, respectively). The specificity of the Sp1 siRNA was also confirmed in these experiments, in which treatment of cells with siRNA against Sp1 did not have any inhibitory effects on the expression of Sp3 (Fig. 2B, lower panel, lane 3). The levels of actin were similar in these samples (Fig. 2, A and B, lower panels, lanes 3 and 4 and lanes 4–6, respectively). To further examine the role of ceramide in the regulation of the functions of Sp1/Sp3 on the hTERT promoter, Sp1 or Sp3 was co-expressed with the pGL3-hTERT-luciferase plasmid in A549 cells, and their effects on hTERT promoter activity were examined in the presence or absence of 10 μm C6-ceramide for 24 h. The results showed that the overexpression of Sp1 (Fig. 3A, upper panel, lane 1) caused an about 2-fold increase in the activity of hTERT promoter, which was almost completely blocked by 10 and 20 μm C6-ceramide (Fig. 3B). In contrast, overexpression of Sp3 (Fig. 3A, lower panel, lane 5) resulted in a slight decrease in hTERT promoter activity (about 30%); however, ceramide at 10–20 μm significantly enhanced the repressor effect of exogenously expressed Sp3, resulting about 75–80% inhibition, respectively, in the promoter activity (Fig. 3C). In addition, overexpression of Sp3 in the absence or presence of 20 μm ceramide blocked the trans-activation function of exogenously overexpressed Sp1 on hTERT promoter activity when Sp1 and Sp3 together were co-expressed in A549 cells (Fig. 3D). These results demonstrate for the first time that ceramide negatively regulates the trans-activation function of Sp1 and/or enhances the suppressor function of Sp3, which play important roles in regulating the activity of the hTERT promoter.

https://openalex.org/W2036592479,"A number of RGD-type integrins rely on a synergistic site in addition to the canonical RGD site for ligand binding and signaling, although it is still unclear whether these two recognition sites function independently, synergistically, or competitively. Experimental evidence has suggested that fibrinogen binding to the RGD-type integrin αIIbβ3 occurs exclusively through the synergistic γ400-411 sequence, thus questioning the functional role of the RGD recognition site. Here we have investigated the respective role of the fibrinogen γ400-411 sequence and the RGD motif in the molecular events leading to ligand-induced αIIbβ3-dependent Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell or platelet spreading, by using intact fibrinogen and well characterized plasmin-generated fibrinogen fragments containing either the RGD motif (fragment C) or the γ400-411 sequence (fragment D), and CHO cells expressing resting wild type (αIIbβ3wt), constitutively active (αIIbβ3T562N), or non-functional (αIIbβ3D119Y) receptors. Our data provide evidence that the γ400-411 site by itself is able to initiate αIIbβ3 clustering and recruitment of intracellular proteins to early focal complexes, mediating cell attachment, FAK phosphorylation, and Rac1 activation, while the RGD motif subsequently acts as a molecular switch on the β3 subunit to trigger cell spreading. More importantly, we show that the premier functional role of the RGD site is not to reinforce cell attachment but, rather, to imprint a conformational change on the β3 subunit leading to maximal RhoA activation and actin cytoskeleton organization in CHO cells as well as in platelets. Finally, αIIbβ3-dependent RhoA stimulation and cell spreading, but not cell attachment, are Src-dependent and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-independent and are inhibited by the Src antagonist PP2.

Plasma fibrinogen is one of the most abundant soluble adhesion molecules present in blood vessels and serves as a ligand to a variety of vascular cells, including platelets, endothelial cells, and monocytes. Fibrinogen is primarily involved in the maintenance of hemostasis by mediating platelet aggregation, clot formation, and wound healing. In addition, together with thrombin-converted insoluble fibrin, fibrinogen also functions as a component of the extracellular matrix in non-hemostatic normal or pathological processes promoting placenta development, angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, metastasis, as well as a variety of vascular and renal diseases (1Bini A. Haidaris P. Kudryk B.J. Bikfalvi A. Encyclopedic Reference of Vascular Biology and Pathology. Springer Verlag, New York2000: 107-125Google Scholar). Both fibrinogen and fibrin expose multiple interacting sites that serve as adhesion motifs for vascular cell receptors. Undoubtedly, the first and best characterized of these binding sites are those interacting with the β3 integrins, the platelet-specific αIIbβ3 fibrinogen receptor (2Bennett J.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 936: 340-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and the αvβ3 vitronectin receptor (3Smith J.W. Ruggeri Z.M. Kunicki T.J. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12267-12271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human fibrinogen contains three putative β3 integrin binding sites, two RGD motifs within the Aα chain, Aα95-98 (RGDF) and Aα572-575 (RGDS) (4Doolittle R.F. Watt K.W.K. Cottrell B.A. Strong D.D. Riley M. Nature. 1979; 280: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and a non-RGD dodecapeptide sequence in the γ chain (C-terminal γ400-411) (5Kloczewiak M. Timmons S. Lukas T.J. Hawiger J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Although fibrinogen binding to αvβ3 relies essentially on the Aα572-575 RGDS sequence (3Smith J.W. Ruggeri Z.M. Kunicki T.J. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12267-12271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), binding to αIIbβ3 involves, in addition to the RGDS site, the non-RGD dodecapeptide γ400-411 sequence (5Kloczewiak M. Timmons S. Lukas T.J. Hawiger J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Evidence for the functional importance of these fibrinogen motifs in β3 integrin ligand binding emerged from biochemical cross-linking and site-directed mutagenesis studies (6Plow E.F. Haas T.A. Zhang L. Loftus J. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21785-21788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), as well as from genetic analysis of naturally occurring αIIbβ3 variants in patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (7French D.L. Seligsohn U. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), characterized by complete loss of fibrinogen binding due to single point mutations within the β propeller of the αIIb subunit or the A domain of the β3 subunit, that function as contact sites for the γ400-411 sequence and the RGD motif, respectively. With the recently published crystal structure of the extracellular domains of αvβ3 (8Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar) and αIIbβ3 (9Xiao T. Takagi J. Coller B.S. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2004; 432: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), the precise contact sites of the RGD motif with the β3 subunit have been defined with residue Asp ligated to a Mn2+ held in the metal ion-dependent adhesion site of the βA domain and stabilized by additional contacts with residues Tyr-122, Arg-214, and Asn-215 of the βA domain. Despite the higher affinity of the RGDS peptide for αIIbβ3 as compared with the γ400-411 dodecapeptide, experimental evidence has suggested that neither of the two RGD sequences in fibrinogen significantly contributes to the binding of αIIbβ3 to either surface-bound or soluble fibrinogen (10Farrell D.H.

Blood. 1996; 88: 2967-2972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in contrast, binding of αvβ3 to fibrinogen appears to rely essentially on the Aα572-575 RGDS sequence (3Smith J.W. Ruggeri Z.M. Kunicki T.J. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12267-12271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

These data highlight the predominant role of the γ chain residues 408-411 in both αIIbβ3-mediated cell adhesion to surface-bound fibrinogen and αIIbβ3-mediated platelet aggregation and question the precise functional role of the Aα572-575 RGDS sequence in integrin αIIbβ3-fibrinogen recognition.

Wortmannin and prostaglandin E1 were purchased from Sigma and PP2 and PP3 from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). Plasmin-generated fibrinogen fragments D and C, a gift from Dr. D. R. Phillips (COR Therapeutics, South San Francisco, CA), were generated essentially as described by Strickland et al. (20Strickland D.K. Morris J.P. Casellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and were purified by conventional size exclusion chromatography. cDNA Constructs, Transfection, and Cell Culture—The pTG2328-β3D119Y plasmid was obtained from Dr. F. Lanza. The cDNA construct β3T562N was generated by PCR mutagenesis using standard procedures and pcDNA3-β3wt as a template. Expression of wild type, αIIbGFPβ3, αIIbβ3GFP, and other mutant human αIIbβ3 integrins in CHO cells was performed as described previously (21Schaffner-Reckinger E. Gouon V. Melchior C. Plançon S.

CHO transfectants were cultured under standard tissue culture conditions in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell Adhesion Assays—Adhesion assays were carried out as described previously (23Chen P. Melchior C. Brons N.H. Schlegel N. Caen J. Kieffer N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38628-38635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, for each experiment, 3 × 104 washed cells were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature with or without inhibitors, then added to the ligand-coated wells (20 μg/ml) and cell adhesion was allowed to occur at 37 °C. At given time points, the cells were microphotographed in the wells without prior washing of the plates or discharge of non-adherent cells. For all αIIbβ3-dependent cell adhesion assays, αvβ3 receptor function was blocked by the addition of 10 μm of the αvβ3 inhibitor RO65-5233/001 (Roche Applied Science). For cell adhesion inhibition assays, the cells were either preincubated with 10 μm wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor), 10 μm PP2 (Src inhibitor), or 10 μm PP3 (as a negative control for PP2), all dissolved in Me2SO, or with Me2SO alone, as a vehicle control (final concentration 0.1%). Immunofluorescence Microscopy and Flow Cytometry—Cells adherent on glass coverslips precoated with 20 μg/ml fibrinogen, fragment D, or fragment C were fixed for 10 min at 4 °C with 3% paraformaldehyde, 2% sucrose in PBS, pH 7.4, rinsed twice with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% heat-denatured bovine serum albumin. Immunofluorescent staining was performed using specific primary antibodies and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Polymerized actin was stained with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). Microphotographs were taken using a Leica DC 300F digital camera and the Leica IM1000 1.20 software. Flow cytometry analysis of antibody binding to CHO transfectants or platelets was performed as previously described (23Chen P. Melchior C. Brons N.H. Schlegel N. Caen J. Kieffer N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38628-38635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). FAK Tyrosine Phosphorylation and GTPase Activity Assays—Petri dishes were coated with 20 μg/ml of fibrinogen, fragment D, or fragment C, blocked with bovine serum albumin and finally washed twice with serum-free Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium. CHO cells were either kept in suspension or added to the coated Petri dishes. Following incubation at 37 °C, adherent cells were chilled on ice and lysed in situ. For focal adhesion kinase (FAK) tyrosine phosphorylation assays, cells were lysed in buffer containing 2% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 20 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 50 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride. Phosphorylated FAK was detected by immunoblotting of cell lysates with a polyclonal antibody specific for the phosphorylated FAK residue Tyr-397. The blot was then stripped and reprobed with a FAK-specific polyclonal antibody to monitor total FAK loading. Quantification of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was performed by densitometric scanning of the autoradiograms (HP ScanJet 5p Scanner and QuantiScan software, Biosoft). Rho family GTPase activity determination was performed as described by Ren et al. (24Ren X.-D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Briefly, adherent cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 4% glycerol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and a mix of serine and cysteine protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), and the cell lysates were incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose beads coated with 20-30 μg of bacterially expressed GST-Rhotekin RBD (25Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol.

The GST-Rhotekin RBD and GST-PAK1B PBD constructs were obtained from M. A. Schwartz and J. G. Collard, respectively. Bound Rac1-GTP and RhoA-GTP as well as total Rac1 and RhoA (70 μg of total cell lysate) were analyzed by Western blot using mAb against Rac1 or RhoA. Quantification of GTPase activity was performed by densitometric scanning of the autoradiograms, and the relative RhoA or Rac1 activity was expressed as the percentage of the total amount of RhoA or Rac1 present in whole cell lysates. Platelet Preparation and Adhesion Assays—Acid-citrate-dextrose-anti-coagulated blood (1:7, v/v) was obtained from healthy donors. After centrifugation at 200 × g for 15 min at room temperature, the platelet-rich plasma was carefully removed, adjusted to pH 6.5 with acid-citrate-dextrose-anti-coagulated blood, and centrifuged at 1200 × g for 15 min at room temperature in the presence of 1 μm prostaglandin E1. Platelets were then gently resuspended and subsequently washed twice in a buffer containing 35 mm citrate acid, pH 6.5, 5 mm glucose, 1 μm prostaglandin E1, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl. For adhesion assays, washed resting platelets or platelets stimulated for 20 min at 37 °C with either 0.5 mm MnCl2 or D3GP3 mAb were resuspended in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium and added to ligand-precoated glass coverslips saturated with 1% heat-denatured bovine serum albumin. Platelet adhesion was then allowed to occur at 37 °C and at given time points platelets were fixed for 15 min at 4 °C with 1% paraformaldehyde, 2% sucrose in PBS, pH 7.4. Polymerized actin filaments were visualized by phalloidin staining as described before. A Two-step Mechanism Underlies αIIbβ3-dependent CHO Cell Spreading on Fibrinogen—Integrins αvβ3 and αIIbβ3 mediate cell adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen through two distinct molecular mechanisms: while αvβ3-dependent cell adhesion to fibrinogen relies essentially on the C-terminal Aα572-575 RGDS recognition site in the fibrinogen α chain (15Cheresh D.A. Berliner S.A. Vicente V. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1989; 58: 945-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), αIIbβ3-mediated cell adhesion is mediated primarily through the γ chain C-terminal γ400-411 sequence (11Farrell D.H. Thiagarajan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 226-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cheresh D.A. Berliner S.A. Vicente V. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1989; 58: 945-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This distinct receptor-ligand interaction could easily be demonstrated in the cell adhesion assay used here by studying the inhibitory effect of the RGDS peptide or various anti-β3 antibodies on CHO cell clones expressing similar amounts of either αvβ3 or αIIbβ3, as demonstrated by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). The morphology of CHO cells during cell adhesion is shown in Fig. 1B. Non-adherent cells appeared as small round cells with a refringent peripheral rim, whereas attached cells were enlarged, flattened cells with small protrusions that had lost their peripheral refringency, and fully spread cells exhibited a fibroblastoid morphology. Because of the presence of a chimeric hamster αv/human β3 integrin in CHO αIIbβ3 cells, control experiments were performed in the presence of 10 μm RO65-5233/001, a selective inhibitor of αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins, or in the presence of the αvβ3-blocking antibody LM609. Whereas these inhibitors completely blocked adhesion of CHO αvβ3 cells, they had no effect on CHO αIIbβ3 cell adhesion (Fig. 1C). All subsequent αIIbβ3-dependent adhesion assays were therefore performed in the presence of RO65-5233/001. The effect of the RGDS peptide or the RGD-containing mAb MA-16N7C2 on the cell morphology is shown in Fig. 1D. Pretreatment of the cells with RGDS or MA-16N7C2 totally inhibited CHO αvβ3wt cell spreading as well as cell attachment to intact fibrinogen, whereas these inhibitors prevented essentially CHO αIIbβ3wt cell spreading, but still allowed cell attachment. In addition, αvβ3-dependent cell adhesion was inhibited with antibodies directed against various epitopes of the β3 subunit, whereas these antibodies did not impair αIIbβ3-mediated cell adhesion to fibrinogen. Shown is a representative result obtained with the anti-β3 mAb P37, which prevented αvβ3-dependent CHO cell spreading by 80%, but had no major inhibitory effect on αIIbβ3-dependent CHO cell spreading (Fig. 1E). Loss-of-function point mutations have been identified in the β3 integrin subunit of Glanzmann's thrombasthenia patients that directly affect the RGD interaction with the β3 subunit A domain. Among these, the Asp-119 → Tyr mutation, which interferes with the β3 metal ion-dependent adhesion site, completely inhibits fibrinogen-dependent platelet aggregation (27Loftus J.C. O'Toole T.E. Plow E.F. Glass A. Frelinger III A.L. Ginsberg M.H. Science. 1990; 249: 915-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Here we have tested whether CHO cells expressing this mutant αIIbβ3D119Y receptor with a non-functional RGD recognition site were still able to interact with immobilized fibrinogen. As expected, CHO αIIbβ3D119Y mutants failed to spread on immobilized fibrinogen (28Bajt M.L. Loftus J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20913-20919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but underwent attachment, suggesting that the initial step of cell adhesion is unaffected by this mutation and relies on the αIIb subunit interaction with the γ400-411 sequence (Fig. 1F). These results provide evidence that, in contrast to αvβ3, the αIIbβ3-fibrinogen interaction is a two-step mechanism involving two distinct contact sites in fibrinogen that function independently, the first step mediating cell attachment and relying on the γ400-411 sequence, and the second step leading to cell spreading, and mediated through RGD recognition. CHO αIIbβ3wt Cells Plated on Fragment D Are Blocked at the Cell Attachment Stage—Previous studies have shown that resting αIIbβ3 in platelets is able to mediate cell adhesion to intact fibrinogen as well as plasmin-generated fibrinogen fragment D (16Savage B. Bottini E. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28812-28817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Savage B. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11227-11233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the specific involvement of the fibrinogen γ400-411 recognition site in the two-step adhesion process, we have used fibrinogen fragment D, which contains the γ400-411 site but is devoid of the RGD motifs, and fragment C, which corresponds to the C-terminal part of the fibrinogen α chain and only contains the Aα572-575 RGDS sequence, as αIIbβ3 ligands (Fig. 2, A and B). When plated on fragment D, CHO αIIbβ3wt cells attached but were unable to spread, in contrast to cells plated on intact fibrinogen. On fragment C, the cells failed to attach and spread, indicating that resting αIIbβ3 expressed in CHO cells is unable to interact with the RGDS site exposed in fragment C in the absence of receptor activation through the αIIb-γ400-411 interaction (Fig. 2C). A time-course experiment performed over a period of 4 h further showed that the cells plated on fragment D were blocked at this attachment stage (data not shown). These findings support the concept that the fibrinogen γ400-411 site in fragment D initiates cell attachment but cannot mediate irreversible cell spreading in the absence of the RGD site. Attachment of CHO αIIbβ3wt Cells to Fragment D Induces αIIbβ3 Clustering and Recruitment of Intracellular Cytoskeletal and Adaptor Proteins into Focal Complexes—To determine whether CHO αIIbβ3wt cell attachment to fibrinogen fragment D merely corresponded to receptor-ligand interaction or whether this interaction by itself was able to initiate outside-in signaling events leading to αIIbβ3 clustering, we investigated the subcellular localization of αIIbβ3 in cells plated on fragment D or fragment C. Interestingly, in CHO αIIbβ3wt cells attached to fragment D, αIIbβ3 was already well organized in small adhesion contacts at the cell periphery, giving the cells a stellar shape morphology (Fig. 3A). However, these cells were essentially devoid of actin stress fibers and exhibited submembranous actin staining, in contrast to cells plated on intact fibrinogen that displayed a fibroblastoid morphology with well structured stress fibers connected to mature focal adhesions. When plated on fragment C, the diffuse staining of β3 and the absence of actin filaments confirmed the absence of specific αIIbβ3-dependent adhesion structures in these cells. We next analyzed recruitment of typical components of focal adhesions to these αIIbβ3-dependent adhesion structures generated on fibrinogen fragment D. To demonstrate that all the immunostained adhesion contacts were also positive for αIIbβ3, we used CHO cells expressing an autofluorescent αIIbβ3GFP or αIIbGFPβ3 integrin (22Plançon S. Morel-Kopp M. Schaffner-Reckinger E. Chen P. Kieffer N. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A perfect colocalization of immunostained paxillin and autofluorescent αIIbβ3GFP is shown in Fig. 3B, demonstrating that on fibrinogen fragment D, only integrin αIIbβ3 is engaged in adhesion structures. An identical result was also obtained with cells expressing αIIbGFPβ3 (data not shown). For further experiments, CHO cells expressing wild type αIIbβ3 were used. Interestingly, the cytoskeletal proteins talin and vinculin, as well as tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were found in these adhesion structures (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that the αIIb-γ400-411 interaction induces first wave signaling events leading to integrin clustering and to the recruitment of cytoskeletal, scaffolding, and signaling proteins into adhesion structures that resemble focal complexes (30Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3735) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of an RGD site, the cells are blocked at this attachment stage, suggesting that a synergistic αIIbβ3-RGD interaction is required to trigger additional signaling events allowing full cell spreading. The Spontaneously Active αIIbβ3T562N Mutant Mediates CHO Cell Spreading on Fibrinogen Fragment D—Ligand-induced outside-in signaling relies on the long range propagation of conformational changes in the β3 integrin subunit that are transmitted from the ligand binding pocket to the cytoplasmic tail, necessary for the formation of mature focal adhesions. These ligand-induced conformational changes can be monitored with well characterized monoclonal antibodies, which identify ligand-induced binding site (LIBS) neoepitopes (31Frelinger A.L. Lam S.C. Plow E.F. Smith M.A. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12397-12402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), exposed on the β3 integrin subunit following RGD or fibrinogen binding and not present on the unoccupied resting receptor. To determine whether αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling necessary for cell spreading requires a physical interaction of the RGD recognition motif with the β3 subunit or whether it can be brought about by a conformational change within the β3 subunit independent of the RGD interaction, we investigated the adhesive properties of CHO cells expressing the constitutively active αIIbβ3T562N receptor (32Kashiwagi H.

ICAM-1 dissociation kinetics were measured while LFA-1 affinity was dynamically shifted by the addition of allosteric small molecules. High affinity LFA-1 dissociated 10-fold faster when bound to monomeric compared with dimeric ICAM-1, corresponding to bond lifetimes of 25 and 330 s, respectively. Downshifting LFA-1 into an intermediate affinity state with the small molecule I domain allosteric inhibitor IC487475 decreased the difference in dissociation rates between monomeric and dimeric ICAM-1 to 4-fold. When LFA-1 was shifted into the low affinity state by lovastatin, both monomeric and dimeric ICAM-1 dissociated in less than 1 s, and the dissociation rates were within 50% of each other. These data reveal the respective importance of LFA-1 affinity and proximity in tuning bond lifetime with ICAM-1 and demonstrate a nonlinear increase in the bond lifetime of the dimer versus the monomer at higher affinity.

There is strong evidence correlating shifts in I domain conformation to affinity changes in binding ICAM-1. Mutations in I domain residues stabilized distinct structural conformations correlating to LFA-1 affinity. ICAM-1 equilibrium binding constants increase over 4 orders of magnitude ranging between low (i.e. 1600 μm), intermediate (i.e. 9 μm), and high affinity (i.e. 0.15 μm) (5.Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.H.

Allosteric small molecules provide a powerful tool for directing leukocyte adhesion; however, the interrelationships between bond kinetics, LFA-1 conformation, valence in binding ICAM-1, and adhesion stability remain ill-defined.Concomitant with a shift in affinity is a rapid redistribution of LFA-1 into high density clusters on the plasma membrane. We have reported recently that within seconds of activation, LFA-1 on neutrophils reorganizes from a uniform surface distribution to form both small punctate clusters (<1 μm2) and large caps (∼3 μm2) (1.Lum A.F.

Clustering of LFA-1 on leukocytes tethered to inflamed endothelium in shear flow is a key step in adhesion strengthening and the transition from cell rolling to arrest (1.Lum A.F. Green C.E. Lee G.R.

To emulate affinity and molecular scale clustering of LFA-1 on activated leukocytes, we engineered a cell-free LFA-1 expression system by fusing the α-β subunits at the C terminus with an inserted leucine zipper motif. The C termini of two heterodimers were bound to each Fab arm of an anti-leucine zipper antibody covalently attached to the surface of a latex microsphere. We tested the hypothesis that two adjacent LFA-1 binding to an ICAM-1 homodimer could facilitate rebinding and exponentially prolong bond lifetime. Binding of fluorescent ICAM-1 to LFA-1 on beads was monitored in real time by flow cytometry while shifting LFA-1 conformation and affinity state with soluble agonists and antagonists.Dissociation of monomeric ICAM-1 from high affinity LFA-1 was ∼10-fold faster than dimeric ICAM-1. This difference was attributed to the ability of the dissociated leg of the ICAM-1 dimer to rebind to an adjacent LFA-1 as it is held in proximity by the remaining LFA-1 bond. Adhesion of neutrophils to beads presenting dimeric ICAM-1 in shear flow was sustained beyond 10 min, while monomeric ICAM-1 beads dissociated within 100 s. These data highlight the physiological significance of regulation of both LFA-1 affinity and LFA-1 spatial proximity in tuning bond lifetime and adhesion stability when binding to ICAM-1 homodimer.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—The following antibodies were used: anti-leucine zipper (324C), anti-CD18 activating antibody (240Q) (1.Lum A.F.

Recombinant human ICAM-1 (monomeric full-length, molecular mass is 85 kDa as confirmed by native polyacrylamide gel) and chemotactic stimulus interleukin-8 (IL-8) were purchased from R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN. Anti-CD18 FITC, anti-CD54 FITC, and mouse IgG1 were purchased from Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA. Goat anti-mouse FITC was purchased from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc. Gaithersburg, MD. Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) was bought from Sigma.Assembly of LFA-1 on the Microsphere—Amino microsphere latex beads (diameter = 6 μm, 2.7% solids, latex) (Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) were mixed (Eppendorf Thermomixer R, Brinkmann Instruments) with a sulfosuccinimidyl maleimide-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester cross-linker (0.125 × 10–3 m) (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer's protocol. A sulfhydryl group was added to anti-leucine zipper 324C by incubating 324C with a sulfhydryl linker (Pierce). 324C-SH was mixed (450 rpm) with the amino cross-linker beads for 2 h at 8 °C. Beads were washed and stored at a final concentration of 107 beads/ml at 4 °C. Directly prior to experimentation, LFA-1 (20 μg/ml) was mixed with 105 beads/100-μl sample at 37 °C at 450 rpm for 30 min. The bivalent binding structure of the antibody allows for clustering of the LFA-1 into a dimer-like configuration presented on the bead surface. The cell-free system offers the opportunity to prescribe LFA-1 distribution in a manner that shifts the binding spectrum toward bivalent driven adhesion of ICAM-1.LFA-1 Activation, Inhibition, and Detection—Cell-free LFA-1 on beads was washed and resuspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without Ca2+ or Mg2+ (Invitrogen) and incubated (all incubations were performed at 37 °C at 450 rpm for 30 min unless otherwise noted) with CaCl2 (1.5 mm), MgCl2 (3 mm), and/or 240Q (10 μg/ml). Without washing, fluorescently labeled (AlexaFluor488, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) dimeric ICAM-1 (20 μg/ml) was added to the beads and incubated. Beads were washed and resuspended in 150 μl of PBS, and mean fluorescence intensity was detected by flow cytometry. For inhibition of binding, IC487475 (1 μm), TS1/22, TS1/18, or TS2/4 (20 μg/ml) was added prior to activation and incubated at 37 °C, 450 rpm for 15 min. Without wash, MgCl2 (3 mm) and ICAM-1 (20 μg/ml) were introduced and incubated for 20 min.Binding kinetics of ICAM-1-AlexaFluor488 (10 μg/ml) to beads were measured by adding ICAM-1 immediately prior to flow cytometry readings. ICAM-1 association and dissociation were measured for 3 × 105 beads in 300 μl of PBS aliquots for up to 40 min at room temperature. In the indicated samples, there was a 10-min incubation at room temperature with MgCl2 (or MnCl2, 3 mm) and/or 240Q (10 μg/ml) before the addition of ICAM-1 with the activator remaining in the solution throughout the flow cytometry reading. Dissociation of bound ICAM-1 was continuously detected after the introduction of small molecule inhibitor IC487475 (1 μm), small molecule lovastatin (100 μm), addition of TS1/22 (100 μg/ml), or dilution in the presence of unlabeled ICAM-1. The inhibitory reagents were introduced through polyethylene tubing inserted into the cytometer tube. For dissociation of bound ICAM-1 with dilution, 1 ml of PBS was added containing unlabeled dimeric ICAM-1/Ig 20 times the concentration of the labeled ICAM-1.To detect conformation, LFA-1 beads were treated with by MgCl2 (3 mm), 240Q (10 μg/ml), or IC487475 (1 μm) during a 15-min incubation. KIM127 was incubated with the samples for an additional 15 min. Samples were washed and incubated for 15 min with goat anti-mouse FITC, and mean fluorescent intensities (MFI) were read by flow cytometry (FACScan flow cytometer, Pharmingen).Neutrophil Isolation and Activation—Whole blood was drawn from healthy subjects by venipuncture into sterile syringes with heparin (10 units/ml of blood, Elkins-Sinn, Inc., Cherry Hill, NJ) as described previously (1.Lum A.F. Green C.E. Lee G.R. Staunton D.E. Simon S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20660-20670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Neutrophils were isolated from whole blood using a density gradient media (Robbins Scientific Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Neutrophils were washed once with HEPES buffer (10 mm KCl, 110 mm NaCl, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and were maintained at room temperature in a calcium-free HEPES buffer for up to 4 h. Neutrophils were activated by addition of antibody 240Q (10 μg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature in HEPES buffer, human serum albumin (0.1%), and CaCl2 (1.5 mm). Kinetic experiments were performed as described for the LFA-1 microspheres.ICAM-1 Bead Assembly—Carboxylate microspheres (diameter = 10 μm) were purchased from Polysciences, Inc. (Warrington, PA). 500 μlof beads were washed twice in 1.5 ml of MES buffer, pH 5.0 (Sigma), resuspended in 200 μl of MES, and sonicated for 15 min. 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide, hydrochloride (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), was added at 1 mm, and beads were incubated for 5 min at room temperature and at 500 rpm. Monomeric ICAM-1 (70 μg/ml) or dimeric ICAM-1/Ig (32 μg/ml) was mixed with the beads for 1 h at room temperature and at 500 rpm. Glycine (Sigma) was added (10 mm), and beads were mixed for 30 min at room temperature at 500 rpm. Blockaid blocking solution (Molecular Probes) was added (200 μl) and incubation continued for an additional 15 min. ICAM-1 beads were washed in PBS and resuspended in 1.5 ml of PBS. Site densities were obtained by Quantum Simply Cellular Beads (Bangs Laboratories, Fishers, IN) to be ∼6000 sites/μm2 for monomeric and dimeric beads as identified by anti-CD54.Adhesion of Neutrophils to Beads Presenting Monomeric and Dimeric ICAM-1—Neutrophils were mixed with 10-μm fluorescent latex beads (Fluoresbrite Carboxyl YG 10 Micron Microspheres) with ICAM-1 derivatized to their surface. Samples contained 1 × 106 neutrophils/ml, 2 × 106 beads/ml, and a small magnetic stir bar. Mac-1 blocking antibody 2LPM19c (test volume 10 μl) and/or 240Q (10 μg/ml) was preincubated for 10 min with the cell suspension without beads. For samples stimulated with IL-8 (5 nm), beads and stimulus were added immediately prior to reading on the flow cytometer. Samples were maintained at 37 °C within a mixing chamber with a magnetic motor as described previously (22.Tsang Y.T. Neelamegham S. Hu Y. Berg E.L. Burns A.R. Smith C.W. Simon S.I. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4566-4577PubMed Google Scholar). The magnetic motor coupled with a magnetic stir bar created a shear field (shear stress ∼1.0 dyne/cm2) within the test tube and initiated collisional interactions. Neutrophil capture of ICAM-1-coated beads was continuously monitored by their characteristic forward and right angle light scatter properties and gated in order to exclude unbound beads. Neutrophil-bead adhesion was quantitated on green fluorescence on fluorescence histograms. Quantal increases in fluorescence appeared as peaks in the fluorescence histogram corresponding to populations of neutrophils binding increasing numbers of beads (22.Tsang Y.T. Neelamegham S. Hu Y. Berg E.L. Burns A.R. Smith C.W. Simon S.I. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4566-4577PubMed Google Scholar). To distinguish relative levels of bead capture within the stimulated neutrophil population, neutrophil-bead interactions were quantitated as the average number of beads per neutrophil according to Equation 1, beads/neutrophil=∑i=15i(NBi)N+∑j=15NBj(Eq. 1) where N represents the number of nonadherent neutrophils, and NBi represents the number of neutrophil-bead aggregates bound to between 1 and 5 beads. Aggregates larger than 5 beads were not notably seen in this assay.Dissociation of ICAM-1 beads from neutrophils was induced after 2 min by removing the cytometer sample tube for not more than 10 s during reading and adding inhibitor (1 μm IC487475, 100 μm lovastatin, 100 μg/ml TS1/22, or 4 μl of 1:100 Me2SO:PBS). Cytometer reading resumed and dissociation was modeled as rate of bead/polymorphonuclear leukocyte disaggregation.Data Analysis—Data were analyzed using Graphpad Prism version 4.0 for Windows (Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego). Constants koff (dissociation rate constant) and kobs (observed rate constant) were obtained by performing one-phase exponential decay (Y = specific binding × e–kT + nonspecific binding) and one-phase exponential association (Y = Ymax (1 – e–kT)) curve fits of the real time data, respectively. The kon (association rate constant) was calculated as kon = (kobs – koff)/(ICAM-1-Alexa). Data points were calculated by taking the average fluorescence over 5–25 s, depending on the rate of change. KD, the equilibrium affinity constant, was calculated as koff/kon for kinetic experiments with ICAM-1 binding to the LFA-1 beads. KD was calculated as the EC50 value in a dose-response curve for ICAM-1 binding to the neutrophils. Statistical significance was determined (p ≤ 0.05) by a one-way analysis of variance with a Newman-Keuls multiple comparison post-test or by two-way analysis of variance.RESULTSLFA-1 expressed on the leukocyte membrane can shift its conformation in response to inside-out signaling via chemokine stimulation or extracellularly by addition of divalent cations (23.Hogg N.

LFA-1 heterodimer captured at the C terminus by an antibody covalently attached to microspheres was predominantly expressed in a low affinity state but retained the flexibility to shift conformation and boost affinity for ICAM-1. Cell-free LFA-1 increased binding to dimeric ICAM-1/Ig by 150% over base line in response to the addition of divalent cations Mg2+ or Mn2+, but by only 20% in response to Ca2+ (Fig. 1). Addition of mAb 240Q, which is associated with allosterically stabilizing CD18 into a ligand binding conformation (1.Lum A.F. Green C.E. Lee G.R. Staunton D.E. Simon S.I. J. Biol.

Addition of the allosteric small molecule IC487475, which binds with high affinity to the I domain (i.e. ∼10 nm), also abrogated ICAM-1 binding stimulated by Mg2+ (Fig. 1b). Pretreatment with mAb TS1/18, which binds to an allosterically sensitive domain on the β subunit (25.Huang C. Lu C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3156-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), blocked 65% of ICAM-1 binding in the presence of Mg2+. A nonblocking control, anti-CD11a TS2/4 (18.Huang C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19008-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), increased ICAM-1 binding in the presence of Mg2+ by 25% (data not shown). These data indicate that cell-free LFA-1 retains the capacity to increase affinity for the ICAM-1/Ig dimer through activation by divalent cation or by allosteric mAb 240Q. Moreover, ICAM-1 binding can be sterically blocked by TS1/22 or allosterically inhibited by binding of a small molecule to the I domain.Antibodies that recognize specific epitopes on the β subunit can report on integrin conformation and activation. KIM127 binding has been correlated recently with the extended conformation of LFA-1 and is associated with intermediate or high affinity ligand binding (11.Salas A. Shimaoka M. Kogan A.N. Harwood C.

This activation reporter was used to determine the mechanism by which IC487475 and 240Q allosterically alter the affinity for ICAM-1. In the absence of divalent cations, binding of KIM127 was 2-fold above an IgG isotype-matched control, indicating that a fraction of the LFA-1 adopted a conformation other than the bent low affinity state in the absence of stimulation (data not shown). Activation of LFA-1 with Mg2+ increased KIM127 binding by 40%, which was augmented to 60% upon addition of 240Q (Fig. 1c). IC487475 did not significantly decrease LFA-1 recognition by KIM127 despite its ability to abrogate Mg2+-induced ICAM-1 binding. This suggests that IC487475 can downshift LFA-1 affinity at the IDAS in the absence of inducing a bent conformation of the heterodimer.Kinetic Analysis of ICAM-1 Binding by Fluorescence Flow Cytometry—Leukocytes can shift LFA-1 conformation and increase avidity within seconds of contact at vascular sites of inflammation (26.Ley K.

Env mediates both virus binding to the cell surface and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes allowing productive viral entry. Env consists of an extracellular surface component (SU) and an associated transmembrane subunit (TM) harboring an amino-terminal fusion peptide (1Hunter E. Swanstrom R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 157: 187-253PubMed Google Scholar). SU and TM are derived from the same polyprotein precursor (1Hunter E. Swanstrom R. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65 (and table of contents): 371-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) is a complex deltaretrovirus characterized by several multispliced mRNAs that encode for regulatory proteins. However, despite the large phylogenetic distance (13Benit L. Dessen P. Heidmann T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11709-11719Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) between HTLV and simple gammaretroviruses, HTLV and murine leukemia viruses (MLVs) share a common general organization of Env (14Kim F.J.

Furthermore, the HTLV Env receptor, the glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) (21Manel N. Kim F.J. Kinet S. Taylor N. Sitbon M. Battini J.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), is a multimembrane-spanning molecule, like all identified gammaretrovirus receptors (22Tailor C.S. Lavillette D. Marin M. Kabat D. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2003; 281: 29-106PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, we sought to identify GLUT1 determinants that are involved in the different steps of HTLV Env-mediated viral entry. GLUT1, a member of the class I family of glucose transporters, together with GLUT2, GLUT3, and GLUT4 (23Joost H.G. Thorens B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) and GLUT14 (24Wu X. Freeze H.H. Genomics. 2002; 80: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), is a uniport carrier that passively facilitates glucose transport across membranes by switching between two conformational states (25Appleman J.R. Lienhard G.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8221-8227Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Biochemical data and modelization indicate that GLUT1 is a type 2 integral membrane protein composed of 12 transmembrane domains that delineate 6 extracellular loops (ECL) (26Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). GLUT3, the closest isoform of GLUT1, has a similar predicted structure with six ECL but does not allow HTLV Env-mediated binding and infection. All six GLUT1 and GLUT3 ECL sequences present extensive residue differences and their carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tails confer different cell trafficking properties to the two transporters (27Inukai K. Shewan A.M. Pascoe W.S. Katayama S. James D.E. Oka Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Using GLUT1-GLUT3 chimeras and single residue mutants, we identified 7 amino acids in the GLUT1 ECL6 as the sole determinant able to confer HTLV Env binding properties to GLUT3. However, this determinant was not sufficient to mediate viral entry. Indeed, we found that GLUT1 harbors other non-binding determinants whose concomitant presence in GLUT3 was required for viral entry, thereby demonstrating the dual importance of GLUT1 binding and post-binding events for HTLV infection. Plasmids—All chimeric and point mutant constructs were derived from pCHIX.GLUT1 and pCHIX.GLUT3, each harboring two COOH-terminal HA tags (21Manel N. Kim F.J. Kinet S. Taylor N. Sitbon M. Battini J.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The fragments encompassing the extracellular loops were exchanged using the following restriction sites (positions refer to GLUT1 coding sequence): MscI (206), ApaI (461), SacI (781), StuI (1017), and ApaI (1188). The ApaI sites at position 461 in GLUT1 and position 1188 in GLUT3, the SacI site in GLUT1, as well as point mutations N45Q, E426A, Q427A, and L428A in GLUT1 were introduced by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol. PCR-amplified regions and ligation boundaries were checked by automated DNA sequencing. pLXSN.NotI was obtained by inserting a NotI linker in place of the HpaI site of pLXSN (28Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7 (984-986, 989-990): 980-982PubMed Google Scholar). The GLUT1-HA, GLUT3-HA, and the chimeric constructs were subcloned in pLXSN.NotI using the flanking NotI-BamHI restriction sites. Cells—Human 293T and bovine MDBK cells were grown in DMEM with high glucose (4.5 g/liter) with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. MDBK cells were provided by P. Mangeat (Centre de Recherche en Biochimie Macromoléculaire, Montpellier, France) and O. Schwartz (Institut Pasteur, Paris). Transient transfection of 293T was performed by the calcium phosphate method. Protein Expression and Immunoblots—293T cells were transfected and lysed as described (21Manel N. Kim F.J. Kinet S. Taylor N. Sitbon M. Battini J.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Unboiled lysates were loaded on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes after migration. Membranes were blocked in PBS containing 5% powdered milk and 0.5% Tween 20, probed with a 1:5000 dilution of a 12CA5 anti-HA mouse antibody (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, followed by incubation with a 1:20,000 dilution of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoblots were subsequently washed three times with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and revealed by chemiluminescence (ECL+, Amersham Biosciences). Binding Assay—5 × 105 cells were detached with PBS containing 1 mm EDTA and centrifuged at 4 °C, and the cell pellet was resuspended in cold DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were further incubated with either control supernatant obtained from pCDNA-transfected 293T cells or HRBD surpernatant obtained from 293T cells transfected with a vector encoding the HRBD-EGFP fusion protein (29Manel N. Kinet S. Battini J.L. Kim F.J. Taylor N. Sitbon M. Blood. 2003; 101: 1913-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Following incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed one time with 1 ml of PBS, 2% fetal bovine serum, 0.01% sodium azide, and resuspended in 500 μl of the same buffer. Cells were analyzed with a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Infections—A replication-defective LacZ retroviral vector was pseudotyped with either HTLV-2 or VSV-G envelopes as described previously (30Kim F.J. Manel N. Boublik Y. Battini J.L. Sitbon M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Stable MDBK cell lines were plated at 75,000 cells per well (12-well plates), and infections were performed in triplicate with two viral dilutions. Viral dilutions ranged between 1/2 and 1/200, depending on the titer of the original viral stock. Fresh medium was added 24 h later, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside staining was performed at 48 h. Infection foci were counted under conditions where the viral dilution showed at least two foci but not more than 1000 for all wells. Glucose Uptake—The hexose uptake assay was adapted from Manel et al. (21Manel N. Kim F.J. Kinet S. Taylor N. Sitbon M. Battini J.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) using 2-deoxy-d-[1-3H]glucose (Amersham Biosciences). 105 MDBK stably expressing the panel of chimeric constructs were seeded in 6-well plates. The next day, cells were washed in PBS, incubated in serum-free DMEM, washed in serum/glucose-free DMEM, and incubated for 20 min in 500 μl of serum/glucose-free DMEM. Uptake was initiated by adding labeled deoxyglucose to a final concentration of 0.1 mm (2 μCi/ml), and cells were incubated for an additional 10 min. Cells were then washed three times in PBS and solubilized in 400 μl of 0.1% SDS. Three μl were used for Bradford normalization, and 3H incorporation in the remainder of the samples was counted. Transductions—Retroviral vector particles were obtained by transfecting 293T cells with a VSV-G expression vector (31Battini J.L. Rasko J.E. Miller A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), a gag-pol expression vector (30Kim F.J. Manel N. Boublik Y. Battini J.L. Sitbon M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and a control or GLUT1-expressing pLXSN.NotI vector. MDBK cells stably expressing these vectors were obtained by transduction using viral supernatants followed by selection in G418 (1 g/liter). The Sixth Extracellular Loop of GLUT1 Mediates HTLV Env Binding—GLUT1 and GLUT3 share 63% amino acid sequence identity. Based on secondary structure predictions (26Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we delineated six homologous fragments, each containing a single ECL (Fig. 1A), by either natural or introduced restriction sites and generated a series of GLUT1-GLUT3 chimeric molecules. Chimeras referred to by the parental origin of each ECL (1 or 3) were evaluated for HTLV Env binding (Fig. 1C). Most chimeras, with the exception of 133311 and 331333, were expressed at similar levels as parental constructs (Fig. 1B). HTLV Env binding was measured using soluble HTLV Env RBD protein fused to GFP (HRBD) (15Kim F.J. Manel N. Garrido E.N. Valle C. Sitbon M. Battini J.L. Retrovirology. 2004; 1: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 29Manel N. Kinet S. Battini J.L. Kim F.J. Taylor N. Sitbon M. Blood. 2003; 101: 1913-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). An increase in HRBD binding, as revealed by the appearance of a new peak of highly fluorescent cells, was only observed upon expression of 333311, 333331, and 133311, to levels similar to that observed in GLUT1-transfected cells (Fig. 1C). These chimeras have the GLUT1 sixth fragment that harbors ECL6 in common. We derived two additional chimeric constructs in which all residues were those of GLUT3 with the exception of either 12 residues (residues 420–431) or the 7 residues (residues 423–429) that constitute the GLUT1 ECL6 (Fig. 2A). Both chimeras, designated 333331 (12Overbaugh J. Miller A.D. Eiden M.V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65 (and table of contents): 371-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and 333331 (7Anderson M.M. Lauring A.S. Burns C.C. Overbaugh J. Science. 2000; 287: 1828-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), respectively, were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 2B) and increased HRBD binding (Fig. 2C). Therefore, the 7 amino acids of GLUT1 ECL6 were sufficient to confer HTLV Env binding activity to GLUT3. Glu426, Gln427, and Leu428 are found only in GLUT1 ECL6 (Fig. 3A). Individual mutation of E426A, but not Q427A or L428A, dramatically reduced HRBD binding as compared with wild-type GLUT1 (Fig. 3B), despite similar levels of expression of all three mutants (Fig. 3C). These data indicate the crucial role of a single residue, Glu426, in HTLV Env binding to GLUT1. Determinants of HTLV Env-mediated Infection on GLUT1— We next sought to determine whether ECL6-dependent HTLV Env binding to GLUT1-GLUT3 chimeras was sufficient to lead to subsequent viral entry and infection. Since most cell lines, including 293T cells, are readily infectable by HTLV Env-harboring virions, we used bovine MDBK cells that are relatively resistant to HTLV Env-mediated infection (32Trejo S.R. Ratner L. Virology. 2000; 268: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 33Sutton R.E. Littman D.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7322-7326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been shown recently that ectopic expression of GLUT1 in MDBK cells significantly increases HTLV Env-mediated infection (34Coskun A.K. Sutton R.E. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4150-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). MDBK cells were stably transduced with GLUT1, GLUT3, chimeric retroviral vectors, or a control empty vector. Infection of these cells with HTLV Env-pseudotyped virions consistently demonstrated titers that were 1–2 logs higher on GLUT1-expressing MDBK cells than on control or GLUT3-expressing cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, control VSV-G-pseudotyped virions had similar titers on all MDBK populations. Interestingly, MDBK cells expressing a GLUT3 construct harboring the GLUT1 HTLV Env binding domain, namely 333331 and 333331 (12Overbaugh J. Miller A.D. Eiden M.V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65 (and table of contents): 371-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and 333331 (7Anderson M.M. Lauring A.S. Burns C.C. Overbaugh J. Science. 2000; 287: 1828-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), did not show increased susceptibility to HTLV Env-mediated infection (Fig. 4). This indicated that GLUT1 ECL6 was not sufficient to mediate HTLV entry and prompted us to evaluate whether other precise GLUT1 determinants were involved in post-binding events. Indeed, ectopic expression of 333311 and 133331 led to slight increases in HTLV Env-mediated infection (p < 0.001), and cells expressing a GLUT chimera that combined fragments 1, 5, and 6 (133311) showed infection levels similar to that mediated by GLUT1 (Fig. 4). As these data pointed to the role of ECL1 and -5 in post-binding events, it was important to assess whether Env binding was necessary for infection. To this end, ECL6 point mutants (E426A, Q427A, and L428A) were evaluated for HTLV Env-mediated infection. Only E426A, which was not able to bind HRBD, showed a quasi-complete drop of HTLV Env-mediated infection (Fig. 5A). The Q427A mutation, which did not affect Env binding, led to less important, albeit significant, decreases in HTLV titers (Fig. 5A; p < 0.02). The L428A mutation had no effect on HTLV titers. Thus, as binding via Glu426 is required for infection, residue Gln427 in ECL6 is likely to be involved in post-binding events. Irrespective of HTLV Env binding properties, all chimeras increased deoxyglucose uptake. Expression of both 333311 and 333331 (12Overbaugh J. Miller A.D. Eiden M.V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65 (and table of contents): 371-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) chimeras led to an increase in uptake similar to that observed for parental GLUT1 (Table I). The E426A mutant significantly increased glucose uptake but to a lesser extent when compared with wild-type GLUT1. These data confirm correct targeting, folding, and transport function of these chimeras.Table IFunctional properties of GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT1-GLUT3 chimeras, and GLUT1 mutantsConstructaChimeras are identified according to the presence of parental GLUT1 (“1”) or GLUT3 (“3”) ECL. “(7)” and “(12)” indicate the number of residues derived from GLUT1 ECL6 (Fig. 2)Mean glucose uptake ± S.E.bMean glucose uptake values are expressed as percentage relative to control.

Additional chimeric molecules that harbored GLUT1 ECL6 in combination with either the GLUT1 amino-terminal intracellular tail (residues 1–12) or ECL1 alone (residues 34–66) were generated. Increased viral titers were observed only with the latter construct (data not shown), demonstrating that post-binding events mediated by the first fragment of GLUT1 in the GLUT3 context were solely due to the extracellular loop. GLUT1 N-Glycosylation Is Not Required for HTLV Env-mediated Infection—N-Glycosylation of several retroviral receptors has previously been shown to inhibit viral entry (35Marin M. Lavillette D. Kelly S.M. Kabat D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2936-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 36Dunn K.J. Yuan C.C. Blair D.G. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4704-4711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Miller D.G. Miller A.D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5346-5352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Miller D.G. Miller A.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 78-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Wilson C.A. Eiden M.V. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5975-5982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since GLUT1 has a N-glycosylation site at Asn45 in ECL1, we evaluated the influence of this site on HTLV Env-mediated infection. The GLUT1 N45Q mutant had the expected increased electrophoretic migration as compared with wild-type GLUT1, due to suppression of this N-glycosylation site (data not shown). However, neither HTLV Env-mediated binding (data not shown) nor infection were affected (Fig. 5B). Therefore, the requirement of HTLV ECL1 in HTLV Env-mediated infection does not depend on its N-linked glycosylated chain. The binding of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 Env to GLUT1 could be conferred to the heterologous GLUT3 glucose transporter by substitution of 7 amino acids constituting the sixth extracellular loop of GLUT1 (ECL6). However, productive viral entry required the presence of additional determinants located in loops 1 and 5, neither of which appeared to influence binding. This functional dichotomy of GLUT1 with regard to HTLV Env binding and subsequent viral entry steps was further supported by results obtained with the Q427A mutation in ECL6. Indeed, although GLUT1 Q427A exhibited full binding abilities, this mutant had a significant decrease in HTLV Env-mediated viral entry. Elucidation of the interactions between Gln427 in ECL6 and ECL5 in addition to those with the more remote amino-terminal ECL1 will likely provide further clues with regard to the conformational changes that contribute to both the glucose transporter and HTLV Env receptor and possibly other cellular functions (40Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Fischbarg J. Golde D.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) of GLUT1. Disruption of GLUT1 single N-glycosylation had no effect on HTLV Env binding and infection. Nevertheless, various patterns of GLUT1 glycosylation have been described (41McMahon R.J. Frost S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12094-12099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The impact of these modifications as well as other post-translational modifications of GLUT1 on HTLV Env binding and HTLV Env-mediated infection remains to be determined. Mutation of Glu426 in GLUT1 strongly reduced HTLV Env binding and infection; however, it only mildly affected glucose uptake (Table I). Furthermore, disruption of the glucose uptake activity of GLUT1 by introducing the Q161C mutation did not alter HTLV Env binding and infection (data not shown). This indicates that these different activities are mediated by distinct domains on GLUT1. It will thus be of interest to determine the mechanism involved in the inhibition of GLUT1 activity by HTLV Env (21Manel N. Kim F.J. Kinet S. Taylor N. Sitbon M. Battini J.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The distinct trafficking properties of GLUT1 and GLUT3, previously documented in an epithelial cell line, depend on their COOH-terminal intracellular domains (27Inukai K. Shewan A.M. Pascoe W.S. Katayama S. James D.E. Oka Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In agreement with this report, we also observed that the COOH-terminal intracellular domain of GLUT1 and GLUT3 was responsible for differences in localization, with GLUT1 accumulating mainly into cytoplasmic vesicles and GLUT3 present predominantly at the plasma membrane (data not shown). However, these differences in overall compartmentation did not appear to influence HTLV Env binding and post-binding events in all constructs we tested. For example, introduction of the GLUT3 cytoplasmic tail in the GLUT1 background did not modify HTLV Env binding (data not shown). Similarly, 133311 and 333331 chimeras, which shared the same major vesicular localization as GLUT1, showed comparable HTLV Env binding due to the presence of the GLUT1 ECL6, while only 133311 allowed HTLV Env-mediated infection. Mapping of viral entry or binding determinants on gammaretrovirus receptors has also made use of chimeric molecules (10Lauring A.S. Cheng H.H. Eiden M.V. Overbaugh J. J.

Virol. 2004; 78: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), but the presence of receptor determinants that distinctively control Env binding and post-binding viral entry has not been reported. In contrast, binding and post-binding entry determinants located within the viral Env have been characterized for an increasing number of gammaretroviruses (22Tailor C.S. Lavillette D. Marin M. Kabat D. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2003; 281: 29-106PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of MLV, a disulfide bond-mediated association of SU and TM is isomerized upon binding into an intrasubunit disulfide bond in the SU. This event, which is dependent on a highly conserved CXXC (CWLC) motif in the MLV SU (20Sitbon M. d'Auriol L. Ellerbrok H. Andre C. Nishio J. Perryman S. Pozo F. Hayes S.F. Wehrly K. Tambourin P.

Virol. 2001; 75: 3685-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HTLV-Env also harbors a similar motif in its SU (CIVC). It is therefore tempting to propose that a similar isomerization occurs in HTLV Env, following binding to GLUT1 ECL6. It remains to be determined whether the post-binding events controlled by GLUT1 determinants are involved in the SU isomerization process. In addition, although no co-receptor has been formally identified for GLUT1, it will be of interest to determine whether these post-binding determinants act through the recruitment of co-receptors or co-factors or alternatively through conformational changes in GLUT1 that favor membrane fusion and productive virion entry. We thank S. Perkovska and G. Boissonnet for their help with the generation of some of the constructs, N. Taylor for insightful discussion and critical reading of the manuscript, and all the members of our laboratory for stimulating input."

To examine whether leptin synthesis and lipolysis are influenced by P2 purinergic receptor activation, the effects of ATP and other nucleotides on leptin secretion and glycerol release have been investigated in differentiated rat white adipocytes. Firstly, insulin-induced leptin secretion was inhibited by nucleotide treatment with the following efficacy order: 3′-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl ATP (BzATP) > ATP ≫ UTP. Secondly, treatment of adipocytes with ATP increased both intracellular Ca2+ concentration and cAMP content. Intracellular calcium concentration was increased by ATP and UTP, but not BzATP, an effect attributed to phospholipase C-coupled P2Y2. On the other hand, cAMP was generated by treatment with BzATP and ATPγS, but not UTP, indicating functional expression of adenylyl cyclase-coupled P2Y11 receptors in white adipocytes. Thirdly, lipolysis was significantly activated by BzATP and ATP, which correlated with the characteristics of the P2Y11 subtype. Taken together, the data presented here suggest that white adipocytes express at least two different types of P2Y receptors and that activation of P2Y11 receptor might be involved in inhibition of leptin production and stimulation of lipolysis, suggesting that purinergic transmission can play an important role in white adipocyte physiology.

Obesity results from a chronic disequilibrium between caloric intake and energy expenditure and is a major risk factor for hypertension, cardiovascular disorders, and metabolic syndromes, including insulin-independent diabetes and dyslipidemia. Lipolysis is the hydrolysis of the ester bonds in triacyl-glycerol, which is composed of three fatty acids esterified to glycerol. Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) 1The abbreviations used are: HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; BzATP, 3′-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl ATP; fura-2/AM, fura-2 pentaacetoxymethyl ester; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); [Ca2+]i, intracellular free calcium concentration; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; α,βMeATP, adenosine 5′-(α,β-methylene) triphosphate. is thought to be a key enzyme for the mobilization of triglycerides deposited in adipose tissue. HSL-mediated lipolysis is stimulated by catecholamines and other lipolytic hormones with phosphorylation of HSL by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and perilipin-mediated translocation of the enzyme from the cytoplasm to the lipid droplet (1.McKnight G.S. Cummings D.E. Amieux P.S. Sikorski M.A. Brandon E.P. Planas J.V. Motamed K. Idzerda R.L. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1998; 53: 139-161PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Clifford G.M. Londos C. Kraemer F.B.

Dysregulation of the lipolytic pathway has been one of the major hypotheses linking insulin resistance to hyperlipidemia in metabolic disease, obesity, and diabetes mellitus (5.Bergman R.N. Mittelman S.D. J. Basic Clin. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1998; 9: 205-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 6.Reaven G.M. Chang H. Ho H. Jeng C.Y. Hoffman B.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: E23-E30PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, identification of molecules that control food intake has generated new targets for drug development in the treatment of obesity and related disorders (7.Schwartz M.W. Woods S.C. Porte Jr., D. Seeley R.J. Baskin D.G. Nature. 2000; 404: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (4884) Google Scholar). Leptin is a 16-kDa hydrophilic protein mainly secreted from white adipocytes, which is considered to signal the size of adipose tissue stores to the brain and plays a key role in regulating body weight (8.Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11755) Google Scholar, 9.Pelleymounter M.A. Cullen M.J. Baker M.B. Hecht R. Winters D. Boone T. Collins F. Science. 1995; 269: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (3869) Google Scholar). Leptin has widespread effects on other physiological responses such as immune function, hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, renal function, reproduction, and neuroendocrine function (10.Mora S. Pessin J.E. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2002; 18: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Therefore, an understanding the regulation of two important adipocyte-specific physiological processes, lipolysis and leptin production, is very important. It is well known that the sympathetic nervous system is involved in the regulation of lipolysis and mobilization of lipid stores from white adipose tissue and is a key regulator of leptin production (11.Rayner D.V. Trayhurn P. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 79: 8-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 12.Trayhurn P. Duncan J.S. Rayner D.V. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that β-adrenergic receptor mediates the effect of the sympathetic nervous system on leptin expression by activating cyclic AMP (cAMP)/protein kinase A signaling pathways (13.Gettys T.W. Harkness P.J. Watson P.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4054-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 14.Rayner D.V. Simon E. Duncan J.S. Trayhurn P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Previously, Lee and Pappone (15.Westfall D.P. Todorov L.D. Mihaylova-Todorova S.T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 303: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) suggested that other neuronal factors besides the adrenergic system may also be involved in the sympathetic activity and proposed extracellular ATP as a candidate, because it is often co-localized in the vesicles of many sympathetic neurons and is released simultaneously with norepinephrine. The various physiological effects of P2 purinergic receptor stimulation have been well studied in brown adipocytes, including increases in cytosolic calcium levels and membrane conductance (16.Pappone P.A. Lee SC. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), enhancement of cellular metabolism (17.Lee S.C. Pappone P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C679-C686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), stimulation of exocytosis (18.Lee S.C. Pappone P.A. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2297-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and regulation of cell proliferation (19.Wilson S.M. Barsoum M.J. Wilson B.W. Pappone P.A. Cell Prolif. 1999; 32: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These all indicate ATP is a factor that mediates important aspects of sympathetic stimulation in brown adipocytes. However, little is known about the effects of purinergic activation on white adipocytes. Therefore, to define the signal transduction of purinergic receptors and their physiological roles in rat white adipocytes, we tested the effects of purinergic agonists on the levels of intracellular calcium and cAMP and two important aspects of adipocyte-specific physiology, lipolysis, and leptin production. Here we report that extracellular ATP elicits the elevation of cAMP and cytosolic Ca2+ through the activation of two different purinergic receptors, P2Y2 and P2Y11. The activation of cAMP-protein kinase A signaling pathways with the stimulation of P2Y11 increases lipolysis and decreases leptin production. Materials—ATP, UTP, α,β-methylene ATP, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATPγS), (±)-sulfinpyrazone, Triton X-100, EGTA, EDTA, Trizma base, trichloroacetic acid, bovine serum albumin, collagenase Type II, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Medium 199 (M199), fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics were purchased from Invitrogen. Fura-2 pentaacetoxymethyl ester (fura-2/AM) and fluo-4 acetoxmethyl ester (fluo-4/AM) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). [α-32P]dCTP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The anti-HSL antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Constantine Londos (National Institutes of Health). Cell Culture—Fibroblastic preadipocytes were isolated from adipose tissue and cultured according to a previously reported method (20.Mitchell S.E. Rees W.D. Hardie L.J. Hoggard N. Tadayyon M. Arch J.R. Trayhurn P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The inguinal fat pads from 14-day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (8 per group) were removed under sterile conditions and washed in a buffer containing 135 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 1.25 mm Na2HPO4, and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The fat pads were transferred to fresh buffer containing collagenase type II (1 mg/ml), 3.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and glucose (0.5 mg/ml). Following incubation for 1 h at 37 °C in a shaking water bath, the digest was filtered through sterile 250-mm nylon mesh. The digested tissue was centrifuged at 250 × g for 10 min, and mature adipocytes were removed by aspiration. The pellet containing the stromal-vascular fraction was resuspended in M199 supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and fungizone (100 units/ml, 100 mg/ml, and 2.5 mg/ml, respectively), and refiltered. Red blood cells were lysed by hypotonic shock (21.Atkin S.L. Hipkin L. Radcliffe J. White M.C. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1995; 31: 657-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The suspension was centrifuged (250 × g for 10 min) and cells were counted using a hemocytometer. The cell preparation (mainly fibroblastic preadipocytes) was adjusted to a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/ml in M199 containing 10% fetal calf serum. After 48 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, differentiation was induced by addition of medium supplemented with 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 0.25 μm dexamethasone, and 10 μg/ml insulin. After another 48 h, the induction medium was removed and replaced by M199 containing 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with insulin (10 μg/ml) alone (22.Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The medium was changed every 2 days. Fully differentiated adipocytes were obtained after treatment with the above medium containing insulin for 7 days. Preparation of Epididymal Adipocytes—Epididymal adipocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion of the epididymal fat pads of male Sprague-Dawley rats (45.Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and after being washed free of enzyme, were suspended 1:5 (v/v) in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 5 mm glucose. Aliquots of cell suspension (600 ml) were incubated without or with each nucleotide for lipolysis and incubated in a quartz cuvette with 10 μm fura-2/AM at 37 °C for 40 min under continuous stirring for calcium measurement. Western Blot Analysis—Adipocytes were plated in 60-mm tissue culture dishes and treated with nucleotides for various times as indicated. After treatment, the cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with lysis buffer (250 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.5), 2% SDS, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol). Equivalent amounts of proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Immunoblot analysis was performed as we previously described (32.Hur E.M. Park Y.S. Lee B.D. Jang I.H. Kim H.S. Kim T.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Kim K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5852-5860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Signals were detected with an ECL detection system (Neuronex Co., Korea). Determination of Intracellular Ca2+ Level—The level of intracellular Ca2+ was measured using the fluorescence Ca2+ indicator fura-2/AM as previously described (23.Suh B.C. Son J.H. Joh T.H. Kim K.T. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1622-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the differentiated adipocytes were harvested from 100-mm culture plates by 0.25% (w/v) trypsinization, the cells were washed with serum-free M199 medium. Then cell suspensions were incubated in a quartz cuvette with 3 μm fura-2/AM at 37 °C for 40 min under continuous stirring. The cells were then resuspended in Locke's solution (154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). In Ca2+-free Locke's solution, CaCl2 was omitted, and 100 μm EGTA was included. Sulfinpyrazone (250 μm) was added to all solutions to prevent dye leakage (24.Di Virgilio F. Fasolato C. Steinberg T.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Changes in fluorescence ratio were measured at the dual excitation wavelengths of 340 nm and 380 nm and the emission wave-length of 500 nm. [Ca2+]i was calculated using the equation: [Ca2+]i = Kd[(R - Rmin)/(Rmax - R)](Sf2/Sb2), where Rmax and Rmin are the ratios obtained when fura-2 is saturated with Ca2+ and when EGTA is used to remove Ca2+, respectively. To obtain Rmin and Rmax, the fluorescence ratios of the cell suspension were measured successively at final concentrations of 4 mm EGTA, 30 mm Trizma base, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 4 mm CaCl2. Sf2 and Sb2 are the proportionality coefficients of Ca2+-free fura-2 and saturated fura-2, respectively. Calibration of the fluorescence signal in terms of [Ca2+]i was performed according to the method of Grynkiewicz et al. (25.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy—To record fluorescence images, adipocytes cultured on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips were loaded with 5 μm fluo-4/AM dye. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, cells were washed two times in Locke's solution to remove excess dye. Adipocytes containing lipid droplets were selected under the microscope. Measurements of intracellular calcium were performed with the Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad) equipped with a ×40 objective 0.75 numerical aperture. The calcium-sensitive Fluo-4 dye was excited by the 488 nm line from an argon laser, and the emission fluorescence monitored at 515/30 nm was selected by a band-pass filter. During fluorescence data collection, each scan of a 512 × 512 pixel image took 0.35 s, and the interval between each image scan was ∼5 s. Images were stored and processed with laser pix software (Bio-Rad). The region of interest distributed across the image provided an intensity versus time graphic output. Measurement of Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate—Concentration of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) in cells was determined by [3H]IP3 competition assay as we previously described (23.Suh B.C. Son J.H. Joh T.H. Kim K.T. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1622-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To determine the IP3 concentration, mature adipocytes were stimulated with agonists for the indicated periods of time, and the reaction was terminated by aspirating the medium off the cells followed by addition of 0.3 ml of ice-cold 15% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid containing 10 mm EGTA. The samples were left on ice for 30 min to extract water-soluble inositol. The extract was then transferred to an Eppendorf tube, and trichloroacetic acid was removed by four times of extractions with diethyl ether. Finally, the extract was neutralized with 200 mm Trizma base, and its pH was adjusted to about 7.4. 20 μl of the cell extract was added to 20 μl of assay buffer (0.1 m Tris buffer containing 4 mm EDTA and 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and 20 μl of [3H]IP3 (0.1 μCi/ml). Then 20 μl of solution containing the binding protein was added, and the mixture was incubated for 15 min on ice and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of water, and 1 ml of scintillation mixture was added to measure the radioactivity. IP3 concentration in each sample was determined based on a standard curve and expressed as picomoles/μg of protein. The IP3-binding protein was prepared from bovine adrenal cortex according to the method of Challiss et al. (26.Challiss R.A. Chilvers E.R. Willcocks A.L. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, the adrenal cortex obtained freshly from local slaughter house was demedullated and decapsulated, and the remaining cortex was homogenized in homogenization buffer (1.68 g of NaHCO3 and 0.16 g of dithiothreitol per liter, pH 8.0). The homogenate was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction is harvested and recentrifuged at 38,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in the buffer and rehomogenized with glass homogenizer. The protein concentration was about 20 mg/ml as determined by BCA protein assay. Measurement of [3H]cAMP—Intracellular cAMP generation was determined by [3H]cAMP competition assay as we described previously (27.Choi B.H. Chae H.D. Park T.J. Oh J. Lim J. Kang S.S. Ha H. Kim K.T. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 422-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with some modification. To determine the cAMP production induced by agonists, white adipose cells were stimulated with agonists for 20 min in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro 20-1724 (5 μm), and the reaction was quickly terminated by three repeated cycles of freezing and thawing. The samples were then centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cAMP assay is based on the competition between 3H-labeled cAMP and unlabeled cAMP present in the sample for binding to a crude cAMP-binding protein prepared from bovine adrenal cortex according to the method of Brown et al. (28.Brown B.L. Albano J.D. Ekins R.P. Sgherzi A.M. Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 561-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Each sample was incubated with 50 μl of 3H-labeled cAMP (5 μCi) and 100 μl of binding protein for 2 h at 4 °C. Separation of the protein-bound cAMP from the unbound cAMP was achieved by adsorption of the free cAMP into charcoal (100 μl) followed by centrifugation at 22,000 × g at 4 °C. 1.2 ml of scintillation mixture was added to 200 μl of supernatant to measure the radioactivity. The cAMP concentration in the sample was determined based on a standard curve and expressed as picomoles. RNA Extraction, Northern Blot Analysis, and Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from differentiated adipocytes using TRIzol reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) according to the manufacturers' protocol. Northern blot analysis was performed as previously described (51.Lee J.H. Kim K.T. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 634-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For quantitative real-time PCR, total RNA was reversely transcribed using an iScript™ cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturers' instructions. For detection and quantification, a MyiQ™ real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) was used. PCR reactions were performed using an iQTM SYBR Green Supermix kit (Bio-Rad). PCR was carried out in a final volume of 20 μl using 0.5 μm of each primer, cDNA, and 10 μl of the supplied enzyme mixture containing the DNA double strand-specific SYBR Green I dye for detection of PCR products. PCR was performed with a 3-min preincubation at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. PCR products were verified by melting curve analysis, agarose gel electrophoresis, and DNA sequencing. The following primers were used: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (forward, 5′-GCCATCAATGACCCCTTCATT; reverse, 5′-GCTCCTGGAAGATGGTGATGG) leptin (forward, 5′-TCACCCCATTCTGAGTTTTGTC; reverse, 5′-CGCCATCCAGGCTCTCT). Relative value of gene expression was analyzed using the 2-ΔΔC(T) method (29.Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar). Measurement of Leptin Production—By using cultured rat adipocytes grown in 12-well plates, we measured the effects of various nucleotides on leptin production. Leptin concentration in the medium was determined using a sensitive and specific rat leptin RIA kit (Linco Inc., St. Charles, MO). Lipolysis Measurements—Glycerol release was measured as previously described (30.Dole V. Neinertz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2595-2599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the differentiated adipocytes cultured in 24-well plates (in M199 medium) were stimulated with agents for the indicated time period in the figure legends. After stimulation, 1 ml of hydrazine buffer containing 50 mm glycine, pH 9.8, 0.05% hydrazine hydrate, 1 mm MgCl2 supplemented with 0.75 mg/ml ATP, 0.375 mg/ml NAD, 25 μg/ml glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 0.5 μg/ml glycerol kinase was added to 200 μl of collected media. After incubation for 40 min at room temperature, absorbance was measured at 340 nm, and glycerol release was calculated. Preparation of Cytosolic and Fat Cake Fractions for SDS-PAGE—Cytosolic and fat cake fraction from adipocytes were obtained for immunoblot as described previously (2.Clifford G.M. Londos C. Kraemer F.B. Vernon R.G. Yeaman S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5011-5015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Briefly, after differentiated adipocytes in 100-mm culture plates were stimulated as indicated, the cells were lysed in 150 μl of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 225 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, and 50 mm NaF (buffer A). Following lysis, cells were kept on ice for 15 min for the floating fat cake to solidify. The lysate was then vortexed vigorously and centrifuged at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The cytosolic fraction was aspirated from the solidified fat cake below, and 100 μl of cytosol was added to an equal volume of ×2 sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. The fat cake fraction was respun at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and any contaminating cytosol was aspirated and discarded. The fat cake was warmed to room temperature, 100 μl of SDS sample buffer was added, and the solution was vortexed thoroughly. Following centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, the fat cake protein extract was aspirated from the floating fat layer below for PAGE. Analysis of Data—All quantitative data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Comparison between two groups was analyzed using Student's unpaired t test, and differences were considered to be significant when p was <0.05. Adipogenic Differentiation—Fibroblastic preadipocytes were harvested from the subcutaneous fat depot of suckling rats, cultured, and induced to differentiate into mature adipocytes (20.Mitchell S.E. Rees W.D. Hardie L.J. Hoggard N. Tadayyon M. Arch J.R. Trayhurn P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). After induction by treating cells with dexamethasone, isobutylmethylxanthine and insulin, cells containing lipid droplets consistent with the overall morphological appearance of adipocytes were observed under the light microscope (see Fig. 3G). Histological staining of differentiated cells with oil red O confirmed the presence of lipid within the intracellular vesicles (data not shown). On the other hand, cells grown in the absence of inducing agents had the morphological appearance of fibroblasts without lipid droplets (data not shown). Inhibition of Leptin Secretion by ATP—Previous studies reported that differentiated adipocytes secreted leptin into the incubation medium in response to insulin (20.Mitchell S.E. Rees W.D. Hardie L.J. Hoggard N. Tadayyon M. Arch J.R. Trayhurn P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of purinergic activation on the insulin-induced leptin secretion from white adipocytes, we treated cells with 300 μm ATP. Time course studies demonstrated that insulin-induced leptin secretion occurred in a time-dependent manner, which was suppressed by ATP treatment (Fig. 1A). This suggests that the purinergic receptor may be a negative regulator of leptin secretion. Fig. 1B shows that BzATP, an analog of ATP, also suppressed the insulin-induced leptin secretion under the same conditions, whereas UTP had little effect. It is well known that glucocorticoids stimulate leptin secretion (31.Slieker L.J. Sloop K.W. Surface P.L. Kriauciunas A. LaQuier F. Manetta J. Bue-Valleskey J. Stephens T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5301-5304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), whereas cAMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A antagonize insulin-stimulated leptin secretion (13.Gettys T.W. Harkness P.J. Watson P.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4054-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B also shows that the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, enhanced leptin secretion, whereas forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase, and isoproterenol, a β-adrenergic receptor agonist, reduced leptin secretion. To determine whether the inhibitory effect of purinergic receptor activation is due to blocking early insulin signaling or leptin synthesis, we examined the effect of ATP analogs on dexamethasone-induced leptin secretion. Fig. 1C shows that the nucleotides also reduced leptin secretion induced by dexamethasone, implying that the inhibitory role of purinergic receptor is via leptin synthesis but not the early insulin signaling pathway. Increases in [Ca2+]i, IP3, and cAMP by Purinergic Receptor Stimulation—To determine whether the suppression of leptin production by ATP is mediated via G protein-coupled P2 purinergic receptor activation, we tested the activity of the receptors. Activation of phospholipase C and adenylyl cyclase was monitored by measuring the changes in intracellular Ca2+, IP3, and cAMP levels in response to ATP treatment. Firstly, we observed [Ca2+]i changes elicited by ATP. Exposure of adipocytes to ATP (300 μm) resulted in an increase in [Ca2+]i in the presence of 2.2 mm extracellular CaCl2. The increase in ATP-induced [Ca2+]i peaked within 10 s after stimulation and then declined to the basal level within 2 min. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, ATP still induced an increase in [Ca2+]i, suggesting that this increase was partly due to mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores. However, BzATP did not elevate [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2A). To determine the effects of ATP on phospholipase C activation, we stimulated the differentiated adipocytes with ATP and examined the turnover of phosphoinositides. ATP caused concentration-dependent IP3 formation in the cells with an EC50 and a maximum effective concentration of 10 ± 3 and 300 ± 11 μm, respectively (Fig. 2B). The time course of IP3 production induced by maximally effective concentration (300 μm) of ATP shows that addition of ATP to the cells evoked a rapid increase in the level of IP3 that peaked at 30 s after ATP addition and then declined to the basal level (Fig. 2C). These results clearly suggest that phospholipase C-coupled P2 receptors were expressed in the differentiated adipocytes. To determine whether adenylyl cyclase-coupled P2 receptors were also expressed, we measured changes in cAMP contents upon ATP treatment. Treatment of cells with ATP (300 μm) increased cAMP contents by ∼13-fold, suggesting the presence of adenylyl cyclase-coupled P2 receptors (Table I). Table I shows the effects of different nucleotides and ATP analogs on [Ca2+]i rise, IP3, and cAMP generation. In the elevation of [Ca2+]i and IP3, ATP and UTP were equally effective, but BzATP had little effect. On the other hand, treatment with ATP, ATPγS, or BzATP caused a dramatic increase in cAMP contents, but the effect of UTP was not significant. These results suggest that there are at least two different kinds of P2 purinergic receptors in differentiated white adipocytes.Table IEffect of nucleotides and ATP analogs on [Ca2+]i rise, IP3, and cAMP generation in white adipocytesTreatment"

Although most cellular proteins are ubiquitinated, ubiquitination cannot be linked directly to a specific E3 for a large fraction of these proteins, and the substrates of most E3 enzymes are unknown. We have developed a luminescent assay to detect ubiquitination in vitro, which is more quantitative, effective, and sensitive than conventional ubiquitination assays. By taking advantage of the abundance of purified proteins made available by genomic efforts, we screened hundreds of purified yeast proteins for ubiquitination, and we identified previously reported and novel substrates of the yeast E3 ligase Rsp5. The relevance of these substrates was confirmed in vivo by showing that a number of them interact genetically with Rsp5, and some were ubiquitinated by Rsp5 in vivo. The combination of this sensitive assay and the availability of purified substrates will enable the identification of substrates for any purified E3 enzyme.

The ubiquitin pathway is conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution and is implicated in numerous cellular processes (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). Proteins modified by the ubiquitin pathway are processed for degradation, endocytosis, protein sorting, and subnuclear trafficking (2Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, 3Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is catalyzed by three enzymes termed E1 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; b-Ub, biotinylated ubiquitin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TCEP, tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate; CTD, C-terminal domain. (ubiquitin-activating enzyme), E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme), and E3 (ubiquitin protein ligase). E3 regulates the specificity of the reaction by binding directly to substrates (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar, 3Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). The E3-substrate interaction is implicated in an increasing number of diseases, including neurodegeneration, immunological disorders, hypertension, and cancers. For example, numerous E3 enzymes such as Fbw7, Skp2, Mdm2, and VHL and their respective substrates, cyclin E, p27, p53, and HIF, have been linked to tumor progression (4Wong B.R. Parlati F. Qu K.

Cancer. 2004; 40: 2217-2229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The therapeutic importance of understanding ubiquitination has been underscored recently by the success of anticancer strategies that affect the ubiquitin pathway (6Orlowski R.Z. Expert Rev. Anticancer Ther. 2004; 4: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Most, if not all, proteins are regulated by the ubiquitin pathway. A recent proteomic approach identified over a thousand proteins that are ubiquitinated in yeast under normal conditions (7Peng J. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Cheng D. Marsischky G. Roelofs J. Finley D. Gygi S.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). This study, which likely did not detect many nonabundant proteins or proteins that are ubiquitinated under specific conditions (e.g. stress and nutrition), underlines the breadth of the ubiquitin system. Current estimates also predict that there are hundreds of E3 enzymes in eukaryotic genomes (8Willems A.R. Schwab M. Tyers M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 133-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) whose role is to ubiquitinate these proteins. Despite the biomedical importance of E3 enzymes and great advances in understanding the mechanics of the ubiquitin system, a very small fraction of E3 enzymes has been linked to specific substrates, and currently, the scarcity of identified E3-substrate pairs in the literature is a major bottleneck in the ubiquitin field. Rsp5 is a yeast E3 enzyme, and many of its substrates have not yet been characterized. It belongs to the Nedd4 family of E3 ligases (9Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which contain a C2 domain, WW domains, and a catalytic HECT domain (Fig. 1A). WW domains are protein-protein interaction modules that usually bind substrates directly by recognizing (L/P)PXY sequences (PY motifs) (10Kanelis V. Rotin D. Forman-Kay J.D. Nat. Struct.

The best characterized role of this E3 family is to ubiquitinate transmembrane proteins and to regulate their endocytosis (9Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Rsp5 has been implicated in various other biological functions, such as mini-chromosome maintenance, mitochondrial inheritance, actin cytoskeleton maintenance, drug resistance, regulation of intracellular pH, biosynthesis of fatty acids, and protein sorting at the trans-Golgi network (2Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, 14Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Andre B. Mol.

Rsp5 also regulates the activity of RNA polymerase II in response to DNA damage by ubiquitinating Rpb1, the large subunit of the holoenzyme (16Huibregtse J.M. Yang J.C. Beaudenon S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3656-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 17Beaudenon S.L. Huacani M.R. Wang G. McDonnell D.P. Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell.

The mammalian Rsp5 homolog, Nedd4 (or Nedd4-2), binds to the PY motifs of the plasma membrane-localized epithelial sodium channel and regulates its endocytosis (10Kanelis V. Rotin D. Forman-Kay J.D.

Cell. 2001; 104: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). In this study, the yeast Rsp5 E3 ligase was used as a model to develop an in vitro ubiquitination assay in order to discover substrates for Rsp5 from among large numbers of purified GST-tagged proteins. Traditional immunoblotting (Western blot) assays used to monitor ubiquitination were unsuitable for this purpose because they are difficult to standardize, not quantitative, and not amenable to genome-scale analysis. We elected to develop a ubiquitination assay based on luminescence (AlphaScreen™ technology) in order to achieve higher sensitivity, greater throughput, and the potential for automation (22Warner G. Illy C. Pedro L. Roby P. Bosse R. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Rouleau N. Turcotte S. Mondou M.H. Roby P. Bosse R. J. Biomol. Screen. 2003; 8: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The assay measures the proximity of biotinylated ubiquitin (b-Ub) and GST-tagged substrate proteins (22Warner G. Illy C. Pedro L. Roby P. Bosse R. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Rouleau N. Turcotte S. Mondou M.H. Roby P. Bosse R. J. Biomol. Screen. 2003; 8: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The luminescent assay was used to screen 188 purified yeast proteins for ubiquitination by Rsp5. We identified novel substrates as well as proteins already known to interact with Rsp5. The relevance of the novel substrates was confirmed in vivo by showing that their overexpression compromised the viability of strains deficient in Rsp5 function and by experiments demonstrating that a novel protein that produced a very strong signal in the luminescence assay was also ubiquitinated in vivo. Purification of Yeast E2 Enzymes—Yeast E2 genes UBC1 and UBC4 were cloned into pET15b plasmids as described (24Kus B.M. Caldon C.E. Andorn-Broza R. Edwards A.M. Proteins. 2004; 54: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). All proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). Transformed cells were grown at 37 °C to an A590 of 0.6 in 2 liters of Luria broth, and expression was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 12 h of induction at 16 °C, the cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 μm ZnCl2, 0.5 mm tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP)), and protease inhibitor tablets (1 tablet/50 ml of buffer, Roche Applied Science) containing 5 mm imidazole. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and His-tagged proteins were purified from the clarified lysate on a 2-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow agarose column (Qiagen). Bound proteins were washed with binding buffer supplemented with 30 mm imidazole and eluted with binding buffer supplemented with 500 mm imidazole. Purification yielded 57 mg of Ubc4 and 22 mg of Ubc1 (at a concentration of 9.5 and 3.7 mg/ml, respectively). Purification of Yeast E3 Rsp5, Mutant Rsp5 C777A, and Rsp5 HECT Domain—The GST-Rsp5 expression plasmid (pGEX-6P2-RSP5) was a generous gift from Dr. Linda Hicke, and the GST-Rsp5 C777A expression plasmid (pGEX-6P2-RSP5 C777A) was a generous gift from Dr. Dale Haines. The HECT domain of Rsp5 was PCR-amplified from the GST-Rsp5 expression plasmid (pGEX-6P2-RSP5) using forward and reverse primers specific to the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. The PCR product was subcloned into the pGEX-6P1 plasmid to create GST-HECT. GST-Rsp5, GST-Rsp5 C777A, and GST-HECT were expressed in E. coli using the same method as described for the E2 enzymes except that imidazole was omitted from the binding buffer. The recombinant proteins were purified from the cell lysate on a column containing 3 ml of glutathione-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences), washed once with 50 ml of binding buffer, followed by a wash with 25 ml of PreScission cleavage buffer (PCB: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP, 10% glycerol). Rsp5, Rsp5 C777A, and HECT were proteolytically cleaved from the GST moiety by incubating the resin for 4 h with 1 ml of PCB containing 40 units of PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences). Extensive cleavage reactions resulted in precipitation of Rsp5 and HECT. By using this protocol, we recovered 4.8 mg of Rsp5 (at 1.2 mg/ml), 3.2 mg of Rsp5 C777A (at 1 mg/ml), and 8 mg (at 0.8 mg/ml) of the HECT domain. Purification of Yeast GST-CTD—The GST-CTD expression vector (pET21a-GST-TEV-CTD) was constructed by Dr. Nova Fong 2N. Fong, unpublished data. and generously provided by Dr. David Bentley. GST-CTD was expressed in E. coli and purified using the same method as described for the GST-Rsp5 except that proteins were eluted with binding buffer containing 15 mm glutathione. The purification yielded 22 mg of GST-CTD (at 2 mg/ml). Purification of Yeast GST-tagged Substrates—The collection of yeast strains expressing GST proteins (25Zhu H. Bilgin M. Bangham R. Hall D. Casamayor A. Bertone P. Lan N. Jansen R. Bidlingmaier S. Houfek T. Mitchell T. Miller P. Dean R.A. Gerstein M. Snyder M. Science. 2001; 293: 2101-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Michael Snyder. Culture of the yeast strains and expression of recombinant GST proteins were carried out as described previously (25Zhu H. Bilgin M. Bangham R. Hall D. Casamayor A. Bertone P. Lan N. Jansen R. Bidlingmaier S. Houfek T. Mitchell T. Miller P. Dean R.A. Gerstein M. Snyder M. Science. 2001; 293: 2101-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar). Proteins were purified from 50 ml of growth media using 100 μl of glutathione-Sepharose resin and eluted in 100 μl of binding buffer containing 15 mm glutathione (Amersham Biosciences). The final yield of purified proteins varied from 10 to 200 μg. Purified proteins at concentrations calculated to be greater than 1 μm were used in the ubiquitination assay. Protein Analysis—All purified proteins were resolved on 4–12% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels (NOVEX) and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (Sigma B-7920) and immunoblotted using a mouse monoclonal α-GST antibody (B-14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or mouse monoclonal α-His antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Protein yield was measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) followed by gel densitometry using Gene Genius Bioimaging System, GeneSnap, and Genetools software (all from SynGene). Purified proteins were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. In Vitro Ubiquitination (Luminescence) Assays—Standard ubiquitination reactions contained 3 μlof5× assay buffer (250 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgOAc, 2.5 mm TCEP, 500 mm NaCl, and 50% glycerol), 1 μg of biotinylated ubiquitin (b-Ub), 0.16 μg of yeast E1, 3.8 μg of Ubc4 E2, 4 μg of Ubc1 E2, 1.2 μg of Rsp5 E3, 8 pmol of GST-tagged substrate, and 3.3 mm ATP (Sigma). E1 and b-Ub were purchased from Boston Biochem. Where indicated, Rsp5 was substituted with an equal amount of Rsp5 C777A or 0.52 μg of HECT domain. Water was added to each of the reactions to bring the final volume of all reactions to 15 μl. ATP was either omitted or added last in order to minimize autocatalytic ubiquitination reactions by the ubiquitination enzymes. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 4 h at room temperature and stopped by boiling in 5 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 3 m urea, or by diluting the samples 100–1000-fold with AlphaScreen assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). To prepare the ubiquitination reactions for analysis using AlphaScreen, the samples were diluted 270-fold with AlphaScreen assay buffer (unless otherwise indicated) and transferred to 384-well OptiPlate-NEW microplates containing 10 μl of AlphaScreen anti-GST acceptor and streptavidin donor beads (both at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml). This dilution step brings the concentration of b-Ub and GST proteins into the nanomolar range, which corresponds to the binding capacities of AlphaScreen beads. Plates were incubated at 23 °C for 1 h and analyzed on an AlphaQuest HTS analyzer. A homogenous assay format was also developed in which similar conditions were used (not shown). AlphaScreen GST detection kits, analyzer, and microplates were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Detection of Ubiquitination by Immunoblotting—Completed ubiquitination reactions (15 μl) were boiled in 3× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved by gel electrophoresis on 4–12% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels or 12% polyacrylamide gels. GST-tagged substrate proteins were detected using a 1:2000 dilution of the α-GST antibody. In Vivo Overexpression Yeast Experiments—The rsp5-1 strain and the corresponding wild-type strain (FY56 and FW1808, respectively) were generously provided by Dr. Andrew Emili and were transformed with purified plasmids obtained from the GST fusion protein overexpression library. To assay lethality at restrictive and permissive temperatures, strains were grown in 1-ml 96-well plates (Ultident) in liquid Ura– synthetic drop-out media containing 2% glucose and then spotted onto solid plates containing 2% glucose or 2% galactose using a 96-well pin (Ultident). Plates were grown at the indicated temperatures for 40 h. In Vivo Ubiquitination Experiments—The rsp5-1 and the corresponding wild-type strains expressing the desired GST proteins were grown to log phase in Ura–synthetic drop-out media containing 2% raffinose. The temperature was then shifted to 37 °C; the expression of the GST proteins was induced by the addition of galactose to 2%, and growth was continued at the restrictive temperature for 2 h. The cells were then harvested, and the GST proteins were purified from the cells as described except that 50 μm LLNL (Sigma), 1 μm chloroquine (Sigma), and 1 μm MG-132 (Boston Biochem) was added to the lysis buffers in addition to benzamidine and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The proteins extracted from the mutant and wild-type strains were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and probed with α-GST and α-ubiquitin (Covance) antibodies. Development of the Luminescent Ubiquitination Assay—The new luminescent assay was designed to monitor the ubiquitination of GST fusion proteins in reactions containing purified E1, E2, and E3 (Rsp5) enzymes, b-Ub, and ATP (Fig. 1B). As a starting point for assay development, we measured Rsp5-dependent ubiquitination of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Rpb1, a known Rsp5 substrate, by using Western blots. Once these assay conditions were established, we developed the initial luminescent assay conditions using CTD as the substrate. Furthermore, the ubiquitination of four other in vitro GST-tagged substrates of Rsp5 (Ybr196c, Ypr084w, Ynl136w, and Ydr203c, which were discovered in the course of the study) and five proteins not ubiquitinated by Rsp5 in vitro (GST alone, Yer177w, Ycl040w, Yor057w, and Yar015w) was also reconstituted and monitored using both Western blot and luminescent assays. Fig. 2A shows the detection of ubiquitination using the luminescent assay, and Fig. 2B shows the ubiquitination of these same proteins as detected by Western blot. Ubiquitination of the Rsp5 substrates was 6–11-fold greater in the presence of Rsp5 (Fig. 2A). Significantly lower luminescence was observed in the negative controls, and no ubiquitination was seen on Western blots (Fig. 2B). To ensure that the luminescent signal was dependent on the ubiquitination enzyme cascade, we independently titrated each of the assay components. There was a dose-dependent response to all assay components (Fig. 2C). Reactions containing Ycl040w and Yer177w, which were not ubiquitinated by Rsp5 in vitro according to Western blot analysis, did not produce significant signal over background (not shown). Compared with Western blots, the luminescent assay required 270-fold less biotinylated product to produce an optimal signal (Fig. 3). Finally, we observed a time-dependent response until the reactions containing GST-CTD and Ybr196c were completed after ∼2 h (Fig. 2C). On average, the standard error of measurement in the luminescence assay was ±9.8% (Fig. 4). The greatest source of error was the variability in the enzymatic reaction and not the detection reaction or substrate concentrations (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Assay variability. A, the purification of 14 proteins was repeated between four and six times, and each separately purified protein was incubated in a ubiquitination reaction. The luminescent signal generated by each reaction is represented by a point on the graph to show the reproducibility of the assay. On average, the S.E. is 9.8% of the mean. B, ubiquitination of Ybr196c and Ypr084w was performed, and each reaction was divided into 8 aliquots. Independent detection reactions were then performed (n = 8) for each substrate (the error bars are not seen due to low variability). C, 10 independent ubiquitination and detection reactions were performed for Ybr196c and Ypr084w by using the luminescent assay (n = 10). D, 10 independent ubiquitination detection reactions were performed with Ybr196c and Ypr084w, and for each experiment the luminescent signal was normalized to the signal generated by Ybr196c. Inter-assay variability was determined by using these normalized results. A and D, the absolute luminescence values were normalized to the signal produced by the substrate Ybr196c.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Screen for Ubiquitinated Substrates of Rsp5—The luminescence assay allows for a direct comparison of the relative level of ubiquitination between different proteins and provides sensitivity and speed at low cost, although in its current format it cannot distinguish between mono- and polyubiquitination. To explore the feasibility of using the assay for substrate discovery, we screened for substrates of Rsp5. 188 GST fusion proteins were purified from a yeast overexpression library (25Zhu H. Bilgin M. Bangham R. Hall D. Casamayor A. Bertone P. Lan N. Jansen R. Bidlingmaier S. Houfek T. Mitchell T. Miller P. Dean R.A. Gerstein M. Snyder M. Science. 2001; 293: 2101-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar). 130 of these were selected at random, and 58 were selected because they contained a PY motif, which is a potential target for the Rsp5 WW domains. Equal amounts of purified substrate proteins were subjected to standardized reactions, and Rsp5-dependent ubiquitination was monitored. In the presence of Rsp5, nine substrates generated signal that was higher than CTD (supplemental Table I). GST alone generated a low background signal (0.01 units, Fig. 5 and supplemental Table I). As expected, most of the proteins that generated strong luminescent signal contain a PY motif (Fig. 5), and on average, these proteins produced higher signal (p > 0.01, t test). The WW domains of Rsp5 therefore appeared to retain specificity for PY motifs in the in vitro assays. The nine proteins generating signal higher than CTD were designated as potential substrates of Rsp5. To provide evidence that Rsp5 recognizes substrates through its WW domain in the screen, we selected six of these substrates and tested their ubiquitination by a construct of Rsp5 harboring the HECT domain alone, and lacking the C2 and WW domains, or with a mutant Rsp5 in which the catalytic cysteine was mutated to alanine (Rsp5-C777A) to render it catalytically inactive. The full-length Rsp5 was able to ubiquitinate the six substrates much more efficiently than did either the HECT domain alone or the Rsp5 mutant (Rsp5-C777A) (26Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). The HECT domain alone and the wild-type Rsp5 possessed equal specific activity as monitored by their auto-ubiquitination, a property of some E3 enzymes (not shown). These results suggest that substrate recognition (likely via the Rsp5-WW domains), as well as catalytic activity of Rsp5, is required for efficient substrate ubiquitination in these assays. Monitoring Poly- or Mono-ubiquitination Using a Western Blot Assay—In order to provide further evidence for covalent attachment of ubiquitin to the novel substrates, and to determine the ubiquitin chain topology, we used a Western blot assay. Fig. 2B demonstrates that all the proteins whose ubiquitination was detected in the luminescent assay were visibly ubiquitinated on the Western blot. Most of the proteins were polyubiquitinated or ubiquitinated on multiple lysines, except for Ybr196c, and possibly Ydr404c, which appeared to be either mono- or di-ubiquitinated. Proteins whose ubiquitination was not detected by the luminescent assay did not appear to be ubiquitinated on the Western blot (Fig. 2B). Genetic Interactions between Novel Substrates and Rsp5 in Vivo—To provide genetic evidence for the relevance of the substrates discovered in the biochemical screens, we tested the genetic interaction of strains overexpressing the putative substrates in a strain harboring a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rsp5 (rsp5-1) (27Wang G. Yang J. Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). 34 wild-type and rsp5-1 strains were transformed with GST fusion protein expression plasmids. All of the transformed rsp5-1 strains grew normally at 30 °C, and none were able to grow at 37 °C (not shown). Colony growth was monitored at the weakly permissive temperature (35 °C) at which overexpression of the Rsp5 substrates would be predicted to be lethal. 11 of the overexpressed proteins caused lethality in the rsp5-1 strains (Fig. 7). 8 of these 11 toxic proteins were from the group representing highly ubiquitinated Rsp5 substrates; 2 were from the moderately ubiquitinated proteins, and 1 was from the weakly ubiquitinated proteins, revealing a positive correlation between the extent of substrate ubiquitination in vitro and toxicity in yeast cells. Rsp5-dependent in Vivo Ubiquitination of a Novel Substrate, Ydl203c—Several of the substrates identified in our in vitro luminescence screen had been described previously as in vivo substrates for Rsp5 (e.g. CTD, Bul1, and Hpr1). To test whether a novel in vitro substrate identified in our screen, Ydl203c (which gave a high luminescence signal similar to the above listed known substrates, see Fig. 5 and Table I) is also an in vivo substrate of Rsp5, we investigated in vivo ubiquitination of Ydl203c in Rsp5 and rsp5-1 mutant strains, and we compared it to a protein that gave a very weak signal in the luminescence assay, GST. We opted to focus on in vivo ubiquitination rather than on protein stability because not all ubiquitinated proteins in the cell are degraded. In addition, ubiquitination of a small fraction of a cellular pool of a protein can be detected, even if its total cellular level may not be altered significantly. We thus monitored the in vivo ubiquitination of GST-Ydl203c or GST alone in rsp5-1 and wild-type yeast cells at the restrictive temperature. These proteins (and any attached ubiquitins) were purified in the presence of proteasome and lysosome inhibitors, and equal amounts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-ubiquitin antibodies. As seen in Fig. 8, GST-Ydl203c, but not GST alone, was strongly ubiquitinated in the Rsp5 but not rsp5-1 mutant cells, suggesting Ydl203c is an in vivo substrate for Rsp5.Table IEvidence for physiological relevance of novel substrates†The level of ubiquitination as measured by the biochemical assay, see Fig. 5 and supplemental Table S1.‡Polyubiquitination or monoubiquitination as measured by Western blot, see Fig. 6C.ζBased on the inability of the HECT domain alone mutant to ubiquitinate the novel substrates, see Fig. 6 A and B.ξGenetic interaction, see Fig. 7.§Rsp5-substrate interaction detected in large scale proteome-wide screens.*Evidence (from this study and other studies) supporting that the putative substrate is part of Rsp5-dependent pathways (also see Fig. 8).

The incretin hormone, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) stimulates insulin secretion by potentiating events underlying membrane depolarization and exerting direct effects on exocytosis. In the present study, we identified a novel role for GIP in regulating KV1.4 channel endocytosis. In GIP receptor-expressing HEK293 cells, GIP reduced A-type peak ionic current amplitude of KV1.4 via activation of protein kinase A (PKA). Using mutant forms of KV1.4 with Ala-Ser/Thr substitutions in a potential PKA phosphorylation site, C-terminal phosphorylation was shown to be linked to GIP-mediated current amplitude decreases. Proteinase K digestion and immunocytochemical studies on mutant KV1.4 localization following GIP stimulation demonstrated phosphorylation-dependent rapid endocytosis of KV1.4. Expression of KV1.4 protein was also demonstrated in human β-cells; GIP treatment resulting in similar decreases in A-type potassium current peak amplitude to those in HEK293 cells. Transient overexpression in INS-1 β-cells (clone 832/13) of wild-type (WT) KV1.4, or a T601A mutant form resistant to PKA phosphorylation, resulted in reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion; WT KV1.4 overexpression potentiated GIP-induced insulin secretion, whereas this response was absent in T601A cells. These results strongly support an important novel role for GIP in regulating KV1.4 cell surface expression and modulation of A-type potassium currents, which is likely to be critically important for its insulinotropic action.

Incretins act by potentiating the events underlying membrane depolarization in addition to exerting direct effects on exocytosis. These events ultimately depend upon incretin interaction with its cognate seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor and activation of proximal signal transduction pathways. In the case of GIP, these include stimulation of the adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) module, and activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (6.Ehses J.A. Lee S.S. Pederson R.A.

There is little known regarding the effect of incretins on membrane repolarization of the β-cells (5.MacDonald P.E. Wheeler M.B. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 1046-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar).Voltage-gated potassium channels (KV channels) belong to the six-transmembrane family of K+ channels consisting of KV1 to KV11 subfamilies (9.Ottschytsch N. Raes A. Van Hoorick D. Snyders D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7986-7991Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and are involved in repolarization of excitable cells (10.Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA2001: 131-143Google Scholar). They are of interest as potential therapeutic targets in diabetes, because blockade of KV channels would be expected to prolong the pancreatic β-cell action potential, sustain the opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, and thereby potentiate glucose-induced insulin release (5.MacDonald P.E. Wheeler M.B. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 1046-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Mammalian KV1.Xs have been cloned and characterized in heterologous expression systems, and they generate at least two different types of outward potassium currents classified on the basis of their inactivation properties: delayed rectifier steady-state currents, which do not rapidly inactivate, and A-type transient currents, which inactivate rapidly by N-type inactivation (11.Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Neuron. 1991; 7: 547-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 12.Kurata H.T. Wang Z. Fedida D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 505-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Delayed rectifier current is produced by KV1.1, KV1.2, KV1.3, KV1.5, and KV1.6, and A-type current is produced by KV1.4 (13.Brahmajothi M.V. Campbell D.L. Rasmusson R.L. Morales M.J. Trimmer J.S. Nerbonne J.M. Strauss H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 581-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 14.Jerng H.H. Pfaffinger P.J. Covarrubias M. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2004; 4: 343-369Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Although both types of currents are present in pancreatic β-cells, most of the studies have concentrated on the delayed-rectifier KV channels. The current study focused on a potential role for GIP in the regulation of KV1.4, a prominent member of the KV1 family and one of several channel proteins giving rise to potassium currents proposed to be involved in the regulation of insulin secretion. Using GIPR-expressing human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells, we demonstrated that GIP decreases peak current amplitude of KV1.4 via a process involving PKA activation. In parallel studies, KV1.4 was shown to be expressed in human pancreatic β-cells, and GIP decreased A-type potassium current amplitude in these cells. Additionally, GIP was shown to induce phosphorylation and dynamin-dependent endocytosis of KV1.4 and transient overexpression in INS-1 (832/13) β-cells of wild-type (WT) KV1.4, or a T601A mutant form resistant to PKA phosphorylation, resulted in reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion; WT overexpression potentiated GIP-induced insulin secretion, whereas the loss of PKA-dependent phosphorylation (T601A cells) ablated this effect. These results therefore provide compelling evidence for a role for GIP-induced down-regulation of KV1.4, via phosphorylation-dependent endocytosis of the channel protein, in the modulation of insulin secretion.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of a GIPR-HEK293 Cell Line—HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich), and penicillin-streptomycin (50 IU/ml, 50 μg/ml, Invitrogen) and transfected with GIPR/pcDNA3 plasmid, expressing rat pancreatic islet GIP receptor cDNA under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000™ reagent (Invitrogen) for 4 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stably transfected cells were selected with G418 (Invitrogen), and GIPR-HEK293 cell clones were analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR to check GIPR mRNA expression levels and by Western blotting to confirm GIPR protein expression, respectively.cDNA Constructions of KV1.4 Plasmids and Transient Transfections in GIPR-HEK293 Cells—KV1.4 cDNA was cloned into the pEGFP-N2 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and various constructs, as detailed under “Results,” were prepared by PCR with HindIII and EcoRI insertions for directed cloning. Site-directed mutant constructs were prepared using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All transfection plasmids were prepared using the Plasmid Midi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). GIPR-HEK293 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/glass coverslip in 35-mm dishes. On the following day, transfection was performed with 1.5 μg of the indicated KV1.4 plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000™ transfection reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions.Enzyme Activity Assay of PKA—PKA activity was measured using a PKA kinase activity assay kit (Stressgen, Mississauga, Ontario) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The enzyme activity was normalized to protein concentration and shown as the relative activity to control.KV1.4 protein Purification and in Vitro Phosphorylation—KV1.4 cDNA was prepared by PCR and subcloned into the pGex4T3 vector (Amersham Biosciences). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-KV1.4 fusion protein was purified from BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli expressing pGex4T3/KV1.4. GST fusion proteins were induced by treatment with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) for 4 h, and the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in PBST-100, pH 7.4 (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA) and sonicated (Branson Ultrasonic Corp, Brandury, CT) to release the proteins. GST-KV1.4 fusion protein was affinity-purified using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) column, and bound protein was eluted with 100 mm NaCl solution containing 25 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma). After affinity purification, KV1.4 proteins were released from GST fusion protein through thrombin digestion. In vitro phosphorylation reactions were performed at 30 °C in a volume of 40 μl of MES buffer (50 mm MES, pH 6.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and initiated with the addition of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and unlabeled ATP to a final concentration of 100 μm. For determination of the time course of phosphorylation of target protein, 50 μg of KV1.4 protein was incubated with 5 μg/ml recombinant PKA catalytic subunit (active PKA, Sigma) or GIP-treated GIPR-HEK293 cellular extracts for 1 min to 2 h. Protein phosphorylation was determined by terminating the reactions with 2 × SDS sample buffer, resolving the samples on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels, and drying the gels for autoradiography.Western Blot Analysis—Proteins (25 μg of protein/well) from each sample were separated on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) membranes. Probing of the membranes was performed with antibodies against KV1.4 and β-tubulin. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG secondary antibodies.Islet Isolation and Cell Culture—Human islets were isolated from the pancreas of adult organ donors using collagenase duct perfusion, gentle dissociation, and density gradient purification at the Ike Barber Islet Transplantation Laboratory (Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, Canada) (15.Warnock G.L.

Islets were dispersed to single cells and plated on laminin-coated glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes in CMRL Medium-1066 (Mediatech, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin (50 IU/ml-50 μg/ml, Invitrogen).Electrophysiological Studies—To record ionic current, we used a superfusion solution containing the following (in mm): NaCl, 135; KCl, 5; MgCl2, 1; sodium acetate, 2.8; HEPES, 10; CaCl2, 1; adjusted to pH 7.4 using NaOH. The patch pipettes were filled with the pipette solution containing (in mm): KCl, 130; EGTA, 5; MgCl2, 1; HEPES, 10; Na2ATP, 4; GTP, 0.1; adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH. All chemicals were from Sigma. Whole cell current recording and data analysis were done using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pClamp 8 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), and pipettes with a resistance of 1-3 MΩ were used. HEK293 cells were depolarized to +60 mV for 900 ms from a holding potential of -100 mV. All whole cell recordings were performed at room temperature (20-23 °C).Proteinase K Digestion Experiments—For proteinase K digestion (16.Manganas L.N. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol.

Cells incubated with 100 nm GIP for indicated periods of time were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and incubated with 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.4) with 200 μg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were then harvested, and proteinase K digestion was quenched by adding ice-cold PBS containing 6 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 25 mm EDTA. This was followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, and probing of the membranes was performed with antibodies against GFP and β-tubulin. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG secondary antibodies.Confocal Microscopy—GIPR-HEK293 cells were transfected with WT or mutant forms of KV1.4-EGFP plasmids and treated for 10 min with GIP (100 nm). Cells were then fixed and immunostained successively with α-GFP antibody and a secondary Alexa fluor® 488 dye-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. Cell nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole, and transfected cells were imaged using a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (Axioskop2).Islet Embedding in Agar and Confocal Microscopy—Human islets were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After spinning down, islets were resuspended in PBS, mixed with an equal volume of 2% agar solution, and added to a mold. Agarose-embedded sections were processed for a double immunostaining for KV1.4 and insulin. The sections were incubated with KV1.4 and insulin antibodies and visualized with Alexa fluor® 488-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody and Texas Red® dye-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. Cell nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole and imaged using a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (Axioskop2). All imaging data were analyzed using the Northern Eclipse program (version 6).Insulin Secretion—β-INS-1 cells (clone 832/13) were kindly provided by Dr. C. B. Newgard (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). Cells were cultured in 11 mm glucose RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 unit/ml penicillin G-sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. INS-1 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well. On the following day, transfection was performed with 2 μg of control vector, pEGFP-N2, mutant T601A KV1.4-EGFP, or WT KV1.4-EGFP. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000™ reagent (Invitrogen) for 4 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. On the following day, cells were treated with GIP and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in Krebs-Ringer buffer with HEPES (KRBH) buffer (115 mm Nacl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm NaHCO3, 1.28 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) containing low (2.5 mm) or high glucose (25 mm). Insulin release into the medium was determined using a radioimmunoassay kit (Linco Research Inc., St. Charles, MO).Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. with the number of individual experiments presented in the figure legend. Data were analyzed using the non-linear regression analysis program PRISM (GraphPad, San Diego, CA), and significance was tested using Student's t test or analysis of variance with a Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test (p < 0.05) as indicated in the figure legends.RESULTSGIP Decreases Peak Current Amplitude of KV1.4 in GIPR-HEK293 Cells—GIPR-expressing HEK293 cells (GIPR-HEK293) were used as an in vitro model system to characterize the modulation of KV1.4 currents by GIP treatment. HEK293 cells were stably transfected with a rat islet GIPR cDNA construct under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The resulting GIPR-HEK293 cell clones transiently transfected with KV1.4-EGFP cDNA (GIPR-HEK293-KV) demonstrated voltage-activated, rapidly inactivating outward currents (Fig. 1A) with properties similar to KV1.4 currents previously reported in insulin-secreting cells (5.MacDonald P.E. Wheeler M.B. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 1046-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Administration of GIP-(1-42) to GIPR-HEK293-KV cells resulted in a decrease in peak current amplitude that was initiated within 1 min and decreased by 44.0 ± 5.7% at 5 min (Fig. 1, A and B). The decrease in peak current amplitude was not observed in GIP-(1-42)-treated HEK293 cells, which do not express the GIPR (Control-I), or in GIPR-HEK293-KV cells treated with the non-insulinotropic truncated form of GIP (GIP-(19-30); Control-II). The effect of GIPonthedecreaseofpeakcurrentamplitudewasconcentration-dependent, with 1 nm GIP producing a significant reduction (Fig. 1C). Other macroscopic properties of KV1.4 were next studied to determine whether GIP affects the gating properties of KV1.4. As shown in Fig. 1 (D-F), GIP did not alter the properties of activation (V0.5 Control = -27.6 ± 2.5 mV versus V0.5 GIP = -25.1 ± 1.1 mV), inactivation (V0.5 Control = -54.5 ± 2.7 mV versus V0.5 GIP = -52.9 ± 1.7 mV) or recovery from inactivation (τControl = 4.6 ± 0.6 s versus τGIP = 4.9 ± 0.3 s), indicating that the effect of GIP is not mediated by changes in the macroscopic gating properties of KV1.4.GIP Activates PKA in GIPR-HEK293-KV Cells and GIP-stimulated PKA Activation Is Involved in the Decrease of KV1.4 Peak Current Amplitude—Mechanisms involved in the decrease of KV1.4 peak current amplitude by GIP treatment were next studied. The possibility that changes in KV1.4 peak current amplitude were linked to activation of adenylyl cyclase and PKA was first examined, because this is a well established GIP signaling module involved in the regulation of insulin secretion. Treatment of GIPR-HEK293-KV cells with 100 nm GIP resulted in increased PKA activity (Fig. 2A), apparent 10 min after initiation of GIP treatment, thereafter quickly decreasing with time. GIP stimulation was concentration-dependent, with an EC50 value of 2.10 ± 0.22 nm (Fig. 2B). To establish that GIP-induced activation of PKA was associated with decreases in KV1.4 peak current amplitude, H-89 and (Rp)-cAMP, selective inhibitors of PKA, were applied during electrophysiological recordings. The inhibitor H-89 significantly blocked GIP-stimulated PKA activation (Fig. 2, A and B) and the decreases of KV1.4 peak current amplitude (Fig. 2C). Similarly, the cAMP antagonist (Rp)-cAMP eliminated the effect of GIP on KV1.4 peak current amplitude (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that GIP-stimulated PKA activation is involved in the regulation of KV1.4.Fig. 2GIP activates PKA in GIPR-HEK293-KV cells and PKA activation is involved in the decrease in KV1.4 ionic currents. A, time course of PKA activation responses to GIP and effect of H-89. GIPR-HEK293-KV cells were stimulated for the indicated periods of time with 100 nm GIP in the presence or absence of H-89. H-89 (10 μm) was added to cells during a 30-min preincubation as well as during GIP stimulation. PKA activity assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, concentration-response effect of GIP on PKA activation and effect of H-89. GIPR-HEK293-KV cells were stimulated for 10 min with the indicated concentrations of GIP in the presence or absence of H-89. H-89 (10 μm) was added to cells during 30-min preincubation as well as during GIP stimulation. C, electrophysiological recordings. GIPR-HEK293-KVcells were incubated in the presence or absence of PKA inhibitor, H-89, or cAMP antagonist, (Rp)-cAMP. Current was recorded at zero time (Control) and 5 min after initiating GIP treatment (GIP). Peak current amplitudes at +60 mV were normalized to cell capacitance and represented as percentage ratio to Control (maximum = 1). All data represent the mean ± S.E. from four to six independent experiments, and significance was tested using Student's t test or analysis of variance with a Newman-Keuls post hoc test, where the asterisk represents p < 0.05 versus basal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)GIP-stimulated PKA Activation Resulted in the Phosphorylation of KV1.4 and Decreases in KV1.4 Peak Current Amplitude—To determine whether PKA could phosphorylate KV1.4, purified recombinant KV1.4 protein was incubated with the catalytic subunit of PKA and [32P]ATP in vitro. PKA-induced phosphorylation of KV1.4 protein was apparent 1 min after the initiation of PKA treatment, and it was sustained for 2 h (Fig. 3A). Similar rapid onset and sustained phosphorylation of KV1.4 was observed with GIP-treated GIPR-HEK293-KV cellular extracts (Fig. 3B), indicating the involvement of GIP-stimulated PKA activation for the phosphorylation of KV1.4. To identify the functional region of KV1.4 involved in GIP-mediated phosphorylation, electrophysiological responses to GIP were recorded in KV1.4 mutants with deletions at the N or C termini. As shown in Fig. 3C, ΔN147 KV1.4, with 147 amino acids deleted from the N terminus, showed delayed inactivation compared with WT KV1.4. The delayed inactivation has been previously shown to result from deletion of an N-terminal inactivating “ball” domain, which acts as an intracellular tethered blocker of the open channel (12.Kurata H.T. Wang Z. Fedida D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 505-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). GIP was found to retain the ability to reduce peak current amplitude expressed by ΔN147 KV1.4. On the other hand, the mutant ΔC55 KV1.4, with 55 amino acids deleted from C terminus, demonstrated no responsiveness to GIP (Fig. 3C). These results therefore indicate that the C terminus in KV1.4 is responsible for GIP-mediated effects. Inspection of the amino acid composition of the C terminus of KV1.4 revealed several motifs that are potentially involved in regulating its subcellular localization and interaction with other proteins. The VXXSL motif is critical for glycosylation and surface membrane localization of the channel (18.Li D. Takimoto K. Levitan E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11597-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and the sequence ETDV is the binding site for PDZ domain proteins, such as PSD-95 and SAP-97 (19.Tiffany A.M. Manganas L.N. Kim E. Hsueh Y.P. Sheng M. Trimmer J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 20.Wong W. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 444-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Additionally, we found a potential PKA phosphorylation site, SSTSSS, in the C terminus of KV1.4. To determine whether phosphorylation of KV1.4 is linked to GIP-mediated decreases in current amplitude, studies were performed on the effect of substituting alanine for each of the phosphorylatable serine and threonine residues: S599A, S600A, T601A, S602A, S603A, and S604A. When in vitro phosphorylation of the purified alanine-substitution mutants was examined, all proteins, except T601A, were phosphorylated by PKA (Fig. 3D). Electrophysiological recordings showed that GIP was able to reduce peak current amplitude with GIPR-HEK293 cells expressing S599A, S602A, S603A, and S604A, but not T601A (Fig. 3E). The mutant S600A was not functionally expressed in the plasma membrane (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that phosphorylation of KV1.4 by GIP-stimulated PKA activation is linked to the decrease in peak current amplitude and phosphorylation of Thr-601 in the C terminus is a critical step in this process.Fig. 3GIP-stimulated PKA activation resulted in the phosphorylation of KV1.4 and decreases in ionic current. A and B, in vitro phosphorylation of KV1.4 by PKA. 50 μg of purified KV1.4 protein was incubated for the indicated periods of time at 30 °C in kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of recombinant protein kinase A catalytic subunit (A) and GIP-stimulated GIPR-HEK293 cellular extracts (B). The reactions were terminated by boiling in SDS sample buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were Coomassie-stained to visualize protein, dried, and exposed to x-ray film to visualize incorporated 32P. C, electrophysiological recordings. Schematic diagram of the KV1.4 serial deletion constructs and their functional elements are presented. Peak current amplitudes are shown at the far right, for comparison between WT and N-terminally deleted (ΔN147) or C-terminally deleted mutants (ΔC55) of Kv1.4. Currents were recorded at zero time (black bar) and 5 min after GIP treatment (white bar), and peak current amplitudes at +60 mV were normalized to cell capacitance and represented as percentage ratio (maximum = 1). In the right panel, examples of current traces of WT, ΔN147, and ΔC55 of Kv1.4 ± GIP were shown, and the scale bar indicates 10 nA. D, in vitro phosphorylation of mutant KV1.4 by PKA. 50 μg of purified mutant KV1.4 protein was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C in kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of recombinant protein kinase A catalytic subunit. Reactions were performed as described in A and B. E, electrophysiological recordings. Peak current amplitudes are shown at the far right, for comparison between WT and the site-directed mutants (S599A, T601A, S602A, S603A, and S604A) of Kv1.4. Currents were recorded at zero time (black bar) and 5 min after GIP-treatment (white bar) and peak current amplitudes at +60 mV were normalized to cell capacitance and represented as percentage ratio (maximum = 1). On the right panel, examples of current traces of WT and the mutants of Kv1.4 ± GIP were shown, and the scale bar indicates 10 nA. All data represent the mean ± S.E. from four"

We found that calpain activity increased in response to RANKL in both cell types based on α-spectrinolysis and that μ-calpain, rather than m-calpain, was activated during RANKL-supported osteoclastogenesis in RAW 264.7 cells. Overexpression of μ-calpain clearly augmented RANKL-supported osteoclastogenesis in RAW 264.7 cells, thereby implicating its pivotal role in this process. Cell-permeable calpain inhibitors, including calpastatin and calpeptin, were sufficient to suppress RANKL-supported osteoclastogenesis based on decreased expression of the osteoclastogenic marker, matrix metalloproteinase 9, and the generation of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells in both cell types. Calpain inhibitors suppressed NF-κB activation via inhibition of the cleavage of inhibitor of NF-κB(IκBα)in RAW 264.7 cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that μ-calpain is essential to the regulation of RANKL-supported osteoclastogenesis via NF-κB activation.

Bone is a specialized organ that provides invaluable benefits such as support, locomotion, bone marrow, electrolytes, and protection of internal organs. Bone remodels in a constant manner throughout the life span, and its homeostasis is delicately maintained via bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts (1Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar, 2Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Science. 2000; 289: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar). Hence, the balancing of these two processes is a necessary prerequisite to the maintenance of normal bone condition. On the other hand, unbalanced bone homeostasis may lead to severe bone defects, such as osteoporosis or osteopetrosis.Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells, derived from hematopoietic myeloid precursors of monocyte/macrophage lineage, which express the receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK). 1The abbreviations used are: RANK, receptor activator of NF-κB; RANKL, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand; BMMs, bone marrow-derived monocyte/macrophages; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL, interleukin; FBS, fetal bovine serum; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; SEAP, secreted alkaline phosphatase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.1The abbreviations used are: RANK, receptor activator of NF-κB; RANKL, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand; BMMs, bone marrow-derived monocyte/macrophages; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL, interleukin; FBS, fetal bovine serum; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; SEAP, secreted alkaline phosphatase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. These cells are tightly regulated by systemic or local factors, such as RANKL, which is generated by osteoblasts and bone marrow stromal cells in response to various stimuli, including vitamin D3, parathyroid hormone, TNF-α, thyroid hormone, lipopolysaccaride, IL-1, IL-11, histamine, fibroblast growth factor-2, insulin-like growth factor-1, and CpGpDNA (3Lee S.K.

TNF receptor-associated factor plays a key role in mediating various extracellular signals that lead to osteoclastogenesis and eventually bone resorption (10Wong B.R. Josien R. Lee S.Y.

Previous studies have shown that knock-out mice devoid of either the RANKL gene or its receptor RANK gene show severe osteopetrosis, thereby highlighting their importance in osteoclastogenesis (12Kong Y.Y.

A. 2000; 97: 1566-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar).It has been suggested that calpain, a calcium-dependent intracellular cysteine protease, plays a major role in various cellular processes in mammals, such as signal transduction, cell growth, differentiation and fusion, apoptosis, necrosis, etc. (14Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). Calpain is composed of a superfamily with 14 known members and can be divided into ubiquitous and tissue-specific isozymes in mammals (15Huang Y. Wang K.K. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 78: 355-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Structurally, ubiquitous μ- and m-calpains are heterodimers with an identical small subunit (30K) and different large subunits (80K) sharing 55-65% similarity (16Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar).Calpain executes limited proteolysis of its own substrates and is considered a modulator of various intracellular signaling pathways (14Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar, 15Huang Y. Wang K.K. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 78: 355-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (404) Google Scholar). For instance, calpain is known to degrade IκBα, c-Jun, and c-Fos in vitro, all of which are essential molecular players in osteoclastogenesis (17Milligan S.A. Owens M.W. Grisham M.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Pariat M. Salvat C. Bebien M. Brockly F. Altieri E. Carillo S. Jariel-Encontre I. Piechaczyk M. Biochem.

Rep. 1997; 24: 51-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, calpain may play a master role in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis through limited proteolysis of these molecules.Uncontrolled calpain activity resulting from altered calcium homeostasis often leads to irreversible damage to cells, as exemplified in myocardial infarction, stroke, and brain ischemia (20Wang K.K. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 20-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 21Kunimatsu M. Tada T. Narita Y. Ozaki Y. Liu Z.Q. Shearer T.R. Sasaki M. Cardiovasc.

Dis. 2003; 13: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is tightly regulated by an endogenous inhibitor, calpastatin (24Wendt A. Thompson V.F. Goll D.E. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that the calpain-calpastatin system is involved in pre-osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation (25Murray S.S. Grisanti M.S. Bentley G.V. Kahn A.J. Urist M.R. Murray E.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 233: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), its function in the regulation of RANKL-supported osteoclastogenesis remains unclear. To date, it has been only weakly suggested to play a part in implant particle-induced osteoclastogenesis (26Clohisy J.C. Hirayama T. Frazier E. Han S.K. Abu-Amer Y. J. Orthop. Res. 2004; 22: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).Clarifying the role of calpain in RANKL-supported osteoclastogenesis may shed light on the development of a novel therapeutic intervention(s) that can arrest bone resorption. In the present study, the role of calpain in the regulation of RANKL-supported osteoclastogenesis was therefore examined by using a murine RAW 264.7 cellular system and/or bone marrow-derived macrophage/monocyte progenitors capable of differentiating into multinucleated osteoclasts in the presence of RANKL and/or M-CSF. Here we report that μ-calpain regulates RANKL-supported osteoclastogenesis. It should be noted that this is the first report to demonstrate the role of calpain in the regulation of RANKL/RANK signaling.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA). RAW 264.7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, also purchased from the ATCC, containing sodium bicarbonate (1.5 g/liter), l-glutamine (4 mm), glucose (4.5 g/liter), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen). Bone marrow monocyte/macrophage (BMMs) lineage progenitors were collected from the femur and tibia of 4-5-week-old C57BL/6J mice and cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with l-glutamine (4 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), murine M-CSF (10 ng/ml) (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and 20% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured in 6-well plates and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Culture media were changed every other day.In Vitro Osteoclastogenesis—RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in 6-well plates for 7 days in a medium containing RANKL (20 ng/ml) (R & D Systems). RANKL (20 ng/ml) was also added to BMMs (2 × 105) cultured in 6-well plates with α-minimum Eagle's medium containing M-CSF (10 ng/ml). To determine whether calpain is involved in RANKL-supported osteoclastogenesis, media containing cell-permeable calpain inhibitors, including calpastatin peptide (1 μm) and calpeptin (5 μm) (Calbiochem), were added to each well in the presence of RANKL and/or M-CSF. On day 7, TRAP staining was performed to evaluate TRAP(+)-multinucleated osteoclast formation. Protein was also extracted to compare the expression of osteoclastogenic markers on immunoblotting as described later. For statistical evaluation, each experiment was repeated four times independently.Plasmids and Transfection—Human full-length μ-calpain cDNA in pSRD (1.5 μg) and human calpain small subunit cDNA in pcDNA3.1 (1.5 μg) (kindly provided by Dr. Hiroyuki Sorimachi, University of Tokyo, Japan) were co-transfected into RAW 264.7 cells (5 × 105)in the presence or absence of RANKL using Superfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). To examine whether calpain augments RANKL-supported osteoclastogenesis, RAW 264.7 cells were pre-cultured with media containing RANKL (20 ng/ml) for 2 days. On day 3, each cDNA was transfected to evaluate augmentation of osteoclastogenesis by calpain. Four days after transfection, cells were stained to evaluate TRAP(+)-multinucleated osteoclast formation. To compare the expression of other osteoclastogenic markers, protein was extracted. For statistical evaluation, each experiment was repeated six times independently.Mouse TRAP Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—The amount and activity of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase form 5b (TRAP5b) in the conditioned media were analyzed with a mouse TRAP assay kit (SBA Sciences, Turku, Finland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 100 μl of standard TRAP and conditioned medium were added to each well pre-coated with monoclonal antibody against mouse TRAP5b. Then 25 μl of releasing agent was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at room temperature on a horizontal orbital microplate shaker at 950 rpm. Each well was washed three times with 300 μl of 1× washing buffer. After washing, 100 μl of substrate solution was added to each well, mixed thoroughly, and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Finally, 25 μl of stop solution was added to each well, and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm. For statistical evaluation, each experiment was repeated four times independently.TRAP Staining—After 7 days of culturing, RANKL and/or M-CSF-treated RAW 264.7 cells and/or BMMs were fixed with a solution containing acetone and citrate for 30 s and washed twice with double distilled water. TRAP staining was performed with a kit purchased from Sigma according to the manufacturer's instructions. TRAP(+) cells with four or more nuclei were scored as multinucleated osteoclasts under light microscopy. For statistical evaluation, cell counting was done using four different fields of view and was repeated four times.TRAP Promoter Assay—The reporter plasmid, pTRAP-Luc, containing a 1.85-kb KpnI-BglII fragment of the mouse TRAP promoter (kindly provided by Dr. Hiroshi Takayanagi, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan) was transfected into RAW 264.7 cells using Superfect (Qiagen). Three hours after transfection, RANKL and/or calpain inhibitors were added to the cells. Luciferase activity was examined 24 h after treatment by using a luciferase activity assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). For statistical evaluation, each experiment was repeated four times independently.Immunoblotting—RAW 264.7 cells and BMMs treated with RANKL and/or M-CSF in conjunction with calpain inhibitors were harvested at 1,200 × g and suspended with 100 μl of lysis buffer containing Tris/Cl, pH 7.4 (10 mm), NaCl (150 mm), 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, and EDTA (2 mm) and supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Diagnostics). Cells were then incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 15, 000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, supernatants were collected, and the amount of protein was quantified. Equal amounts of protein were mixed with 2× SDS sample buffer and directly subjected to electrophoresis on a 4-20% BisTris glycine gel (Invitrogen). Separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and incubated with the following antibodies: cathepsin K (Calbiochem), α(II)-spectrin (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), α-actin (Sigma), μ- and m-calpains (Triple Point Biologics Inc., Forest Grove, OR), IκBα (C21) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and MMP9 (Sigma).In Vitro IκBα Cleavage—Murine RAW 264.7 cells (9 × 104) cultured in a 6-well plate with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS were treated with recombinant RANKL (20 ng/ml) (R & D Systems) in a time-dependent manner to confirm that RANKL-induces IκBα cleavage. Cell-permeable calpain inhibitors, including calpeptin (5 μm) and ALLM (1 μm), were added to the media in the presence of RANKL to verify that calpain inhibition decreases RANKL-induced IκBα cleavage. The cells were also subjected to a proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (1 μm). Each cell was then divided into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions using a nuclear extract kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cytoplasmic fractions were subjected to immunoblot for detection of decreased IκBα. Each band was quantified using NIH Image. For statistical evaluation, each experiment was repeated four times independently.Calpain Activity Assay—Murine RAW 264.7 cells (9 × 104) were cultured in media containing RANKL (0, 5, 20, and 50 ng/ml) (R & D Systems) in a 6-well plate. The media were changed every other day. On day 7, conditioned media were examined for TRAP activity. At the same time, the cytoplasmic fractions were used to measure calpain activity with a calpain activity assay kit (Biovision, Mountain View, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested at 1,200 × g and lysed with extraction buffer provided by the manufacturer. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatants were collected. After quantification of protein in the supernatant, 50 μg of protein was used for the calpain activity assay with Ac-LLY-AFC, a fluorescent calpain substrate. Recombinant human m-calpain and calpastatin were used for positive and negative controls, respectively. The samples were read in a fluorometer equipped with 400-nm excitation and 505-nm emission filters. For statistical evaluation, each experiment was repeated four times.Pathway Profiling SEAP Assay—A Mercury™ pathway profiling system (BD Biosciences) was used to confirm signaling pathways affected by calpastatin in murine RAW 264.7 cells. 1 μg of each reporter plasmid (TAL-SEAP (negative control), pSEAP2 (positive control), and pNF-κB-SEAP) was transfected into the cells (9 × 104) by using Superfect (Qiagen). Transfection efficiency for each plasmid was calibrated with the positive control. After transfection, media containing 10% serum were changed to media containing 0.5% serum in order to minimize any background. Twelve hours later, 1 μm of calpastatin peptide (Calbiochem) was added to the cells in the presence of RANKL (20 ng/ml) (R & D Systems). Twenty four hours after treatment with calpastatin peptide, conditioned media were subjected to a SEAP assay using a Great EscAPe SEAP chemiluminescence detection kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For statistical evaluation, each experiment was repeated three times independently.Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from RAW 264.7 cells treated with RANKL by using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized with 0.2 μg of total RNA using an Omniscript reverse transcription kit (Qiagen) with oligo(dT)20 (Invitrogen). Real time RT-PCR for each target was performed with Light Cycler Fast Start DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics) using a Smart Cycler® system (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). Primers were designed on the basis of mouse GAPDH (GenBank™ accession number NM_001001303), m-calpain (GenBank™ accession number NM_009794), and μ-calpain (Gen-Bank™ accession number NM_007600) as follows: 1) 5′-GAPDH, AGAACATCATCCCTGCATCC; 2) 3′-GAPDH, AGTTGCTGTTGAAGTCGC; 3) 5′-μCAPN, GCATGAGTGCCTATGAGATGAG; 4) 3′-μCAPN, AGAATGGAAGAACAAAGGCAA; 5) 5′-mCAPN, AACGCCAAGACATCAAGTC; and 6) 3′-mCAPN, TCAAAGTCGATGATTAGCTCG.Statistical Analyses—Statistical analyses were performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (version 10) (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Differences between treated and control groups were analyzed with the t test or the Scheffe test in a one-way analysis of variance, and a p value of less than 0.01 was considered significant. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. unless otherwise indicated.RESULTSα(II)-Spectrinolysis Suggested Calpain Activation in Response to RANKL—Although it has been suggested that calpain is activated by TNF-α, the role of calpain in the regulation of RANKL-supported osteoclastogenesis is not well understood. Therefore, calpain activation in response to RANKL was examined based on α(II)-spectrinolysis in a murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cellular system. By using this method, calpain activation can be readily detected by the proteolysis of full-length α(II)-spectrin (240 kDa), a well known calpain substrate, to its breakdown product (150 kDa). As shown in Fig. 1A, the continuous addition of RANKL to RAW 264.7 cells for 7 days increased the amount of α(II)) spectrin breakdown product, suggesting that calpain was activated in response to RANKL. In contrast, the cell-permeable calpastatin peptide decreased the level of α(II)) spectrin breakdown product, suggesting that calpastatin suppresses RANKL-induced calpain activation in RAW 264.7 cells.To confirm whether RANKL-induced calpain activation also occurs in normal pre-osteoclasts, RANKL was added to cultured BMM progenitors, which were obtained from C57BL/6J mice, for 5 days in the presence of M-CSF. As shown in Fig. 1B, the amount of α(II)) spectrin breakdown product (150 kDa) increased, suggesting that calpain activation in response to RANKL indeed occurs in normal pre-osteoclasts. Calpastatin peptide also decreased the level of α(II)) spectrin breakdown product, suggesting that calpastatin suppresses RANKL-induced calpain activation in normal pre-osteoclasts.Calpain Activity Increased in a RANKL-dependent Manner in RAW 264.7 Cells—To examine further calpain activation in response to RANKL, calpain activity was assayed with synthetic Ac-LLY-AFC, a fluorescent calpain substrate, using RAW 264.7 cell lysates treated with RANKL. Various concentrations of RANKL (0, 5, 20, and 50 ng/ml) were added to the cells every other day and were allowed to incubate for 7 days to generate fully differentiated, multinucleated osteoclasts as shown in Fig. 2A-2.Fig. 2RANKL induces an increase in both calpain and TRAP activities in RAW 264.7 cells. A-1, RANKL treatment (0, 5, 20, and 50 ng/ml) for 7 days increased both calpain and TRAP activities in a dose-dependent manner. Each of the samples shown A-2 was used for calpain and TRAP activity assays. TRAP and calpain activities were indicated as units/liter (units/liter) and relative fluorescence unit (RFU)/mg of protein, respectively. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of four independent experiments. A-2, RANKL treatment for 7 days induced the generation of fully differentiated osteoclasts. B-1, RANKL decreased immature μ-calpain judging from immunoblot with specific antibody capable of detecting its extreme N-terminal region. In contrast, m-calpain did not show such changes in response to RANKL. α-Actin was used for a loading control. B-2, real time RT-PCR showed that levels of μ- and m-calpain mRNA were unchanged in response to RANKL.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The temporal correlation between osteoclastogenic markers and increased endogenous calpain activity in response to RANKL provided an important clue that calpain is involved in the regulation of RANKL-supported osteoclastogenesis. Therefore, we examined changes in calpain and TRAP activities by using supernatants and media from RANKL-treated and -untreated RAW 264.7 cells.As shown in Fig. 2A-1, calpain and TRAP activities simultaneously increased in a RANKL-dependent manner. These results suggested that calpain is critically involved in RANKL-supported osteoclastogenesis. Although additional factors may exist, RANKL-induced calpain activation is likely the result of a transient increase in the level of cytoplasmic Ca2+ due to the activation of phospholipase C and the subsequent release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (27Bharti A.C. Takada Y. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5940-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar).RANKL-activated μ-Calpain in RAW 264.7 Cells—The N-terminal ends of μ- and m-calpain are autoproteolyzed when activated by an increase in calcium concentration (14Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). In order to confirm which calpain species is/are activated in response to RANKL, changes in the amount of their latent forms were examined by using immunoblot. The antibodies used in this experiment recognized only the N-terminal ends of each species, thus the N-terminal processed form (resulting from activation) was not identified. Examination of changes in the amount of latent form represents a reliable parameter by which to analyze calpain activation in response to RANKL.As shown in Fig. 2B-1, RANKL treatment activated μ-calpain in a dose-dependent manner and thus decreased the amount of its latent full-length form. Because this change could have been the result of a decreased amount of μ-calpain mRNA, we checked its mRNA level upon RANKL treatment. As shown in Fig. 2B-2, we detected neither an increase nor a decrease at the mRNA level. Therefore, we concluded that this decrease in latent full-length form was indeed a consequence of μ-calpain activation. These data provide compelling evidence that μ-calpain is activated by RANKL in RAW 264.7 cells. It is also important to note that no significant changes in the level of full-length m-calpain or m-calpain mRNA were revealed as indicated in Fig. 2, B-1 and -2.Calpain Inhibitors Suppressed RANKL-supported Osteoclastogenesis in RAW 264.7 Cells—To investigate further the calpain involvement in RANKL-supported osteoclastogenesis, calpain inhibitors were added to RAW 264.7 cells in the presence of RANKL. TRAP staining clearly demonstrated that both cell-permeable calpastatin peptide, an endogenous calpain inhibitor, and calpeptin sufficiently suppressed the generation of TRAP(+)-multinucleated cells (Fig. 3, A-1 and -2). Immunoblot analyses revealed a decrease in the level of osteoclastogenic markers, including cathepsin K (data not shown) and MMP9 compared with control cells that were not treated with calpain inhibitors (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Calpain inhibitor decreases RANKL-supported osteoclastogenesis in RAW 264.7 cells. A-1, calpain inhibitors, including calpastatin (1 μm) and calpeptin (5 μm), were sufficient to suppress the generation of TRAP(+)-multinucleated cells in murine RAW 264.7 cells. Images of both TRAP(+)-mononuclear and multinucleated cells were obtained after 7 days of treatment (original magnification, ×100). The representative pictures were chosen for comparison. Each arrow indicates a TRAP(+)-multinucleated cell. A-2, TRAP(+)-multinucleated cells were counted under a microscope, and cells with four or more nuclei with TRAP(+) staining were counted as TRAP(+)-multinucleated cells. Count was performed with four different fields for each sample. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of four independent experiments. **, significantly different between calpain inhibitor-treated and -untreated samples; p < 0.01.

Black triangles indicate MMP9 and α-actin (loading control). C, activation of the TRAP promoter by RANKL was inhibited by calpain inhibitors, including calpastatin, calpeptin, and ALLM. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of four independent experiments. **, significantly different between calpain inhibitor-treated and -untreated samples; p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In addition, we verified that calpain inhibitors suppress TRAP promoter activity judging from a pTRAP-luciferase assay system that measures changes in luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 3C, RANKL treatment resulted in the activation of the TRAP promoter in RAW 264.7 cells, which was in turn arrested by calpain inhibitors.Calpain Inhibitors Suppressed RANKL-supported Osteoclastogenesis in Normal Pre-osteoclasts—We then confirmed that our findings in RAW 264.7 cells also occur in normal pre-osteoclasts using bone marrow-derived monocyte/macrophage progenitors. As shown in Fig. 4, A-1 and -2, cell-permeable calpastatin peptide and"

Because phosphorylation is known to regulate various cellular mechanisms, we investigated the impact of phosphorylation by roscovitine-sensitive cyclin-dependent kinase (RSC) on the localization and functional properties of IE63. We demonstrated first that IE63 was phosphorylated on Ser-224 in vitro by CDK1 and CDK5 but not by CDK2, CDK7, or CDK9. Furthermore, by using roscovitine and CDK1 inhibitor III (CiIII), we showed that CDK1 phosphorylated IE63 on Ser-224 in vivo. By mutagenesis and the use of inhibitors, we demonstrated that phosphorylation on Ser-224 was important for the correct localization of the protein. Indeed, the substitution of these residues by alanine led to an exclusive nuclear localization of the protein, whereas mutations into glutamic acid did not modify its subcellular distribution. When transfected or VZV-infected cells were treated with roscovitine or CiIII, an exclusive nuclear localization of IE63 was also observed. By using a transfection assay, we also showed that phosphorylation on Ser-224 and Thr-222 was essential for the down-regulation of the basal activity of the VZV DNA polymerase gene promoter. Similarly, roscovitine and CiIII impaired these properties of the wild-type form of IE63. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of CDK1-mediated IE63 phosphorylation for a correct distribution of IE63 between both cellular compartments and for its repressive activity toward the promoter tested.

Following recovery of the host, VZV establishes latency in the cells of the dorsal root ganglia and reactivates after numerous years to produce herpes zoster, or shingles, usually observed in elderly or immunocompromised patients (1Flisser A. Tapia-Conyer R. Contrib. Microbiol. 1999; 3: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Molecular events leading to the establishment and the maintenance of the virus latency as well as to its reactivation are still poorly understood. It appears to be the result of a balance between cellular factors, viral proteins, and the host immune system (2Lungu O. Annunziato P.W. Contrib. Microbiol. 1999; 3: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The viral genome encodes 71 open reading frames (ORFs) (3Davison A.J. Scott J.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1986; 67: 1759-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar) that are presumed to be expressed during lytic infection in a sequential cascade composed of three broad kinetic classes as follows: immediate-early (IE), early, and late, a characteristic of all herpesviruses (4Cohen J.I. Straus S.E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia2001: 2707-2730Google Scholar, 5Ruyechan W.T. Hay J. Webster R.G. Granoff A. Encyclopedia of Virology. Academic Press, London1999: 1878-1884Crossref Google Scholar). IE gene-encoded proteins are the first to be active because they act as regulators on their own expression, as well as on the transcriptional and post-transcriptional activation of early and late genes. Among the IE proteins, IE62 is the major regulating factor with regard to its transactivation properties on all three classes of viral genes (6Inchaupse G. Nagpal S. Ostrove J.M.

During latency, the expression of viral proteins that are also present during lytic infection is an original feature that VZV does not share with other alphaherpesvirus (12Croen K.D. Ostrove J.M. Dragovic L.J. Strauss S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9773-9777Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). IE63 was the first protein detected in a latency context such as an animal model (17Debrus S. Sadzot-Delvaux C. Nikkels A.F. Piette J. Rentier B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3240-3245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and human tissue sections (15Lungu O. Panagiotidis C.A. Annunziato P.W. Gershon A.A. Silverstein S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This protein is encoded by VZV ORF63 and ORF70 and is the putative homologue of HSV ICP22. It has an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa and is present in the virion tegument (20Spengler M. Niesen N. Grose C. Ruyechan W.T. Hay J. Arch. Virol. 2001; 17: 71-79Google Scholar). IE63 is abundantly produced at the first stage of infection (17Debrus S. Sadzot-Delvaux C. Nikkels A.F. Piette J. Rentier B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3240-3245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is essential for VZV replication (21Sommer M.H. Zagha E. Serrano O.K. Ku C.C. Zerboni L. Baiker A. Santos R. Spengler M. Lynch J. Grose C. Ruyechan W.T. Hay J. Arvin A.M. J. Virol. 2001; 17: 8224-8239Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Its activity as a potential transcription factor is subject to controversy. It has been shown to exert positive or negative effects on gene transcription, depending on the promoter and the cell type studied (22Jackers P. Defechereux P. Baudoux L. Lambert C. Massaer M. Merville-Louis M.P. Rentier B. Piette J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3899-3903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, others claimed that IE63 played only a minor role in the control of VZV gene expression (23Kost R.G. Kupinsky H. Straus S.E. Virology. 1995; 209: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in our laboratory, IE63 has been shown recently in transient transfection assay to down-regulate the expression of VZV DNA polymerase gene (24Bontems S. Di Valentin E. Baudoux L. Rentier B. Sadzot-Delvaux C. Piette J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21050-21060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). More recently, our laboratory has also demonstrated that IE63 is a transcriptional repressor of some VZV and cellular promoters, and its activity is directed toward the assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex (25Di Valentin E. Bontems S. Habran L. Jolois O. Markine-Goriaynoff N. Vanderplasschen A. Sadzot-Delvaux C. Piette J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). An interesting feature of the VZV IE63 protein is its cellular localization during the different phases of VZV infection. Indeed, at the first stage of infection, IE63 is predominantly present in the nucleus (17Debrus S. Sadzot-Delvaux C. Nikkels A.F. Piette J. Rentier B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3240-3245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while during latency, the protein exhibits an exclusive cytoplasmic localization (15Lungu O. Panagiotidis C.A. Annunziato P.W. Gershon A.A. Silverstein S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7080-7085Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). It can be found both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus when reactivation occurs (15Lungu O. Panagiotidis C.A. Annunziato P.W. Gershon A.A. Silverstein S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7080-7085Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The presence of the IE63 protein and its cellular localization modification might reflect an important role in the latency process. It has been shown recently that the IE63 protein is phosphorylated by casein kinase-1 and -2 (CK-1 and -2) and by cellular kinases on residues located predominantly at the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein (24Bontems S. Di Valentin E. Baudoux L. Rentier B. Sadzot-Delvaux C. Piette J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21050-21060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Stevenson D. Xue M. Hay J.

Virol. 2004; 78: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These phosphorylations are required for the regulation activity of IE63 and its correct cellular distribution (24Bontems S. Di Valentin E. Baudoux L. Rentier B. Sadzot-Delvaux C. Piette J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21050-21060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). IE63 has also been shown to be a substrate of the ORF47 product, one of the VZV-encoded kinases (27Kenyon T.K. Lynch J. Hay J. Ruyechan W.T. Grose C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8854-8858Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). There is more and more evidence that herpesviruses need CDK activity for replication. For example, HSV-1 has been shown to require CDK activity for efficient replication in many cell types, and inhibitors of CDK prevent infection (28Schang L.M. Phillips J. Schaffer P.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5626-5637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, it has been demonstrated that the Epstein-Barr virus lytic program promotes specific cell cycle-associated activity involved in the progression from G1 to S phase (29Kudoh A. Daikoku T. Sugaya Y. Isomura H. Fujita M. Kiyono T. Nishiyama Y. Tsurumi T. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Also, VZV needs a CDK activity for replication as inhibitors of the specific kinases are able to prevent VZV replication (30Taylor S.L. Kinchington P.R. Brooks A. Moffat J.F. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2853-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Among the inhibitors that impair correct replication of herpesvirus, roscovitine is a purine derivative that inhibits CDK1/cyclin B, CDK2/cyclin A or E, CDK5/p35, CDK7/cyclin H, and CDK9/cyclin T (31Bain J. McLauchlan H. Elliott M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). It has been shown that roscovitine prevents VZV replication, results in decreased immediate-early gene expression and abnormal localization of IE63 proteins, and inhibits DNA replication, and it does so without causing cytotoxicity or apoptosis in the host cells (30Taylor S.L. Kinchington P.R. Brooks A. Moffat J.F. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2853-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to analyze the role of IE63 phosphorylation by roscovitine-sensitive cyclin-dependent kinases (RSCs) on its cellular localization and its regulatory properties. RSCs are either implicated in the cell cycle (CDK1, CDK2, and CDK7), transcription (CDK7 and CDK9), or neuronal functions (CDK5). CDK1 (or Cdc2) is a serine/threonine kinase with a molecular mass of 34 kDa, which is responsible for the control of G2/M progression (32King R.W. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 563-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). CDK5 (or neuronal Cdc2-like kinase) is a 33-kDa protein exclusively active in neuronal cells and plays a multifunctional role, including neurite outgrowth, axonal guidance, cytoskeleton assembly, membrane transport, synaptic function, dopamine signaling, and drug addiction (10Baudoux L.

For this, we used the CDK inhibitors, roscovitine and CDK1 inhibitor III (CiIII), and a mutational approach to investigate the importance of two potential phosphorylation sites, serine 224 and threonine 222. These two residues were shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by CDK1 and CDK5 and in vivo by CDK1, and their phosphorylation is important for IE63 cellular distribution and for its gene down-regulation activity in transient transfection assay. Plasmids—pcDNA-IE63wt that encodes IE63 under the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter was described previously (24Bontems S. Di Valentin E. Baudoux L. Rentier B. Sadzot-Delvaux C. Piette J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21050-21060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We also used the pGEX-5x-63wt (24Bontems S. Di Valentin E. Baudoux L. Rentier B.

Mutations were introduced into the IE63 gene in both the pcDNA-IE63wt and the pGEX-5x-63wt by PCR using the site-directed mutagenesis kit system (Stratagene). For this, several sets of primers were synthesized (Eurogentec). Two types of mutations were generated: substitution of a serine or a threonine by an alanine residue (S224A, T222A, and S224A/T222A) or substitution of a serine or a threonine by a glutamic acid (S224E, T222E, and S224E/T222E). The pcDNA-IE63-FULL, in which all the phosphorylation sites for CK1, CK2, CDK1, and CDK5 were substituted by alanine (S15A, S150A, S157A, S165A, T171A, S173A, S181A, S185A, S186A, S197A, S200A, T201A, S203A, T222A, S224A, and T244A), was generated in our laboratory by S. Bontems using the same protocol. The pcDNA-IE63-REV224S and pcDNA-IE63-REV224S/222T were obtained by reversion of the mutations of Ser-224 and Thr-222 from pcDNA-IE63-FULL. All constructions were subsequently sequenced to verify that no unwanted mutations were introduced during the PCRs. The plasmid pPol-luc, where the luciferase reporter gene was under the control of the VZV DNA polymerase gene promoter, was described previously (24Bontems S. Di Valentin E. Baudoux L. Rentier B. Sadzot-Delvaux C. Piette J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21050-21060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells—Vero cells (a monkey kidney cell line, ATCC CCL-81) used in this study were grown in essential minimum Eagle's medium (EMEM) (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (BioWhittaker) and 1% l-glutamine (BioWhittaker). Cell-free virus was prepared from VZV-infected MeWo cells as described previously (24Bontems S. Di Valentin E. Baudoux L. Rentier B. Sadzot-Delvaux C. Piette J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21050-21060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Supernatant containing cell-free virus was added to Vero cells previously resuspended in EMEM, 10% FBS. Infection of Vero cells was propagated by mixing VZV-infected Vero cells with uninfected cells (1:4). ND7 cells (a donation from Dr. Latchman, Institute of Child Health, University College, London, UK) were obtained from a fusion of murine neuroblastoma cells with primary nerve cells from rat dorsal root ganglia (59Wood J.N. Bevan S.J. Coote P.R. Dunn P.M. Harmar A. Hogan P. Latchman D.S. Morrison C. Rougon G. Theveniau M. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1990; 241: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). They were grown in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker) supplemented with l-glutamine and 5% FBS (Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitation—IE63 was immunoprecipitated from Vero extracts with a monoclonal mouse antibody raised against the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein (24Bontems S. Di Valentin E. Baudoux L. Rentier B. Sadzot-Delvaux C. Piette J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21050-21060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). CDK1 was immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts from Vero cells by using an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide mapping at the carboxyl terminus of human CDK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). CDK2 was immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts from Vero cells with rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus of human CDK2 (Calbiochem). CDK5 was immunoprecipitated from either ND7 or nuclear extracts from Vero cells using rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide mapping at the carboxyl terminus of CDK5 of human origin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CDK7 from Vero cells with a mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences), and CDK9 from Vero cells using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Preparation of total and nuclear cellular extracts was performed as described previously (24Bontems S. Di Valentin E. Baudoux L. Rentier B. Sadzot-Delvaux C. Piette J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21050-21060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were incubated for 2 h with antibodies in the immunoprecipitation buffer (0.5 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) that included a mixture of phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, and 0.5 mm β-glycerophosphate), and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). 120 μl of Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) were then incubated for an additional 2 h with the complexes kinase-antibodies. The resin was then washed five times with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with the protease and phosphatase inhibitors mixture. In Vitro Kinase Assays—GST-63wt protein was expressed from the pGEX-5x-63wt vector and GST-CTD protein from the pGEX-5x-CTD vector. Proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutated GST-63 proteins were expressed and purified following the same protocol. In vitro kinase assays were performed by using either nuclear extracts from Vero cells (A) or recombinant (B and D) or immunoprecipitated kinases (C) as follows. A, 50 μg of nuclear extracts from Vero cells were mixed with 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B-bound GST-63 protein and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN Pharmaceuticals) in the CDK1 kinase assay buffer (see below). B, several concentrations of recombinant CDK1 were added to 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B-bound GST-63 protein and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN Pharmaceuticals) in the CDK1 assay buffer. C, 10 μg of eluted GST-IE63 and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN Pharmaceuticals) were added to the resin-bound kinases. D, 50 units of recombinant CK1 and CK2 were added to 5 μg of glutathione-Sepharose 4B-bound GST-63 wild-type or GST-IE63-S224A/T222A protein and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN Pharmaceuticals) in the CK1 and CK2 assay buffer. Roscovitine (Calbiochem), an inhibitor of CDK1, -2, -5, -7, and -9, and CDK1 inhibitor III (Calbiochem), an inhibitor of CDK1, were used in these experiments at 25 and 60 μm, respectively. Histone H1 (Calbiochem) was used as positive control for the experiments with CDK1, -2, and -5, whereas GST-CTD was a positive control for the experiments with CDK7 and -9. The assay performed with GST alone constituted the negative control (-). All reactions were performed in the appropriate kinase buffer (CDK1: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA; CDK2: 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2; CDK5: 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 30 mm MgCl2; CDK7: 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2; CDK9: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2; CK1: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2; CK2: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 140 mm KCl) and supplemented with the protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures. In any case, samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, heat-denatured, and loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After migration, the gel was dried, autoradiographed, and analyzed by PhosphorImaging (Amersham Biosciences). The phosphorylation level was quantified by densitometry (%). In Vivo Kinase Assays—Vero cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 expressing wild-type or mutated IE63 proteins (IE63wt, IE63-S224A/T222A, IE63-FULL, IE63-REV224S, and IE63-REV224S/222T) or with pcDNA3.1 as control plasmid(-) using the FuGENE 6 transfectant reagent (Roche Applied Science). 6 h post-transfection, 32Pi (ICN Pharmaceuticals) was added to the supernatant at a final concentration of 500 μCi/ml for 24 h. Roscovitine and CiIII were used in this experiment at 25 and 60 μm, respectively. IE63 was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal mouse antibody. After extensive washes, samples were heat-denatured and loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, before PhosphorImager detection. The phosphorylation level was quantified by densitometry and is reported as a percentage relative to wild-type IE63 (%). The expression and immunoprecipitation of IE63 proteins were confirmed by Western blotting (WBα-IE63). Immunofluorescence—Vero cells were seeded on cover slides into 10-mm dishes and grown in EMEM (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% FBS (BioWhittaker) and 1% l-glutamine. The cells were transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA-IE63wt or mutated using FuGENE 6 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). VZV-infected Vero cells were also used in these experiments as a positive control. Transfected or infected Vero were either treated or not with 25 μm roscovitine or 60 μm CiIII, 6 h after transfection or infection. 48 h post-transfection or post-infection, the cells were fixed with a solution of acetone/methanol (v/v) for 20 min at -20 °C. After fixation, the nonspecific sites were saturated with a milk-blocking solution (1.5% in PBS) and then incubated with primary antibody. In these experiments, a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against IE63 (9A12) (26Stevenson D. Xue M. Hay J. Ruyechan W.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 658-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako) were used. The cells were observed by fluorescent microscopy (Nikon) after being previously counterstained with a 1% (v/v) Evans Blue solution. Positive cells were counted and classified according to the IE63 cellular localization: N > C for a major nuclear staining, N = C for an equal distribution of the protein between nucleus (N) and cytoplasm (C), and N < C for a major cytoplasmic staining. Average percentages are the results of at least three independent experiments with 100 positive cells counted per experiment. Activity Test—Transient transfection studies were carried out with Vero cells seeded into 35-mm diameter 6-well cluster dishes using the FuGENE 6 transfectant reagent (Roche Applied Science). The plasmid pPol-luc was used as reporter vector and pcDNA3.1-, pcDNA-IE63wt, pcDNA-IE63-S224A, pcDNA-IE63-T222A, pcDNA-IE63-S224A/T222A, pcDNA-IE63-S224E, and pcDNA-IE63-S224E/T222E were used as expression vectors. An equimolar ratio of cytomegalovirus promoter was used in each independent experiment. The amounts of DNA were adjusted with herring sperm DNA. Transfected Vero cells were either treated or not with 25 μm roscovitine or 60 μm CiIII, 6 h after transfection. 24 h post-transfection, luciferase assays were performed using the “Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay, High Sensitivity” kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For each experiment, the concentration of proteins in each sample was measured to normalize the results. Data from luciferase assays were collected from at least five independent transfection experiments. p values were calculated using the graphpad quickcalcs software (www.graphpad.com). For the comparison of two means, an unpaired t test was chosen. For significantly different values, the p value was <0.05; for not significantly different values, the p value was ≥0.05.

https://openalex.org/W1970960004,"The glycan shield of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope protein presents many potential epitopes for vaccine development. To augment immune responses to HIV, type 1 (HIV-1), envelope-associated carbohydrate antigens, we are defining peptide mimics of HIV-associated carbohydrate antigens that function as antigen mimotopes that upon immunization will induce antibodies cross-reactive with carbohydrate antigens. We have previously defined peptides with a putative sequence tract RYRY that mimic concanavalin A-binding glycans. To imitate the multivalent binding of carbohydrates, we compared the avidity of a linear (911) and cyclic peptide (D002) reactive with concanavalin A presented in a multiple antigen peptide (MAP) format. The affinity of the MAP-D002 peptide was higher than that of the peptide MAP-911, whereas the avidity of D002 peptide was lower than that of 911. Serum from mice immunized with MAP-911 had lower titer for oligomannose-9 than those elicited by MAP-D002 under the same conditions, but both immunogens elicited antibodies that can block the binding of GP120 to dendritic cells. Antibodies that bind to the studied MAPs were found in a preparation of normal human immunoglobulin for intravenous use. Those that were purified on 911 bound back to 911 and D002, whereas anti-D002 antibodies were specific only for D002. Human antibodies reactive with both mimotopes and with a mannosyl preparation were observed to bind to envelope protein. These results suggested the potential to fine-tune the antibody response to carbohydrate antigens by modifying structural features of peptide mimotope-based immunogens."
https://openalex.org/W2017161880,"ParG is the prototype of a group of small (<10 kDa) proteins involved in accurate plasmid segregation. The protein is a dimeric DNA binding factor, which consists of symmetric paired C-terminal domains that interleave into a ribbon-helix-helix fold that is crucial for the interaction with DNA, and unstructured N-terminal domains of previously unknown function. Here the ParG protein is shown to be a transcriptional repressor of the parFG genes. The protein assembles on its operator site initially as a tetramer (dimer of dimers) and, at elevated protein concentrations, as a pair of tetramers. Progressive deletion of the mobile N-terminal tails concomitantly decreased transcriptional repression by ParG and perturbed the DNA binding kinetics of the protein. The flexible tails are not necessary for ParG dimerization but instead modulate the organization of a higher order nucleoprotein complex that is crucial for proper transcriptional repression. This is achieved by transient associations between the flexible and folded domains in complex with the target DNA. Numerous ParG homologs encoded by plasmids of Gram-negative bacteria similarly are predicted to possess N-terminal disordered tails, suggesting that this is a common feature of partition operon autoregulation. The results provide new insights into the role of natively unfolded domains in protein function, the molecular mechanisms of transcription regulation, and the control of plasmid segregation.

The results provide new insights into the role of natively unfolded domains in protein function, the molecular mechanisms of transcription regulation, and the control of plasmid segregation. Plasmids are of inherent interest because of their contribution to bacterial genome plasticity, as model systems for investigating a variety of biological processes, and for their utility in gene cloning technology. The role of plasmids in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance and other properties is also particularly significant (1.Hayes F. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 235: 1-17PubMed Google Scholar). The events that contribute to stable plasmid inheritance can be unraveled by analyzing the molecular mechanisms that underlie plasmid segregation. The active segregation of low copy number plasmids typically requires two plasmid-encoded proteins, one of which is most commonly a member of the ParA superfamily of Walker-type ATPases. The second protein is a DNA binding factor that interacts directly with a cis-acting partition site (2.Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2003; 56: 145-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The assembly of the ParA- and DNA-binding proteins on the partition site engenders a nucleoprotein complex that is required for the directional movement of paired plasmids away from the cell median (3.Li Y. Dabrazhynetskaya A. Youngren B. Austin S. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Plasmid movement is most likely mediated by ATP-dependent polymerization of the ParA protein or by its depolymerization (4.Barillà D. Rosenberg M.F. Nobbmann U. Hayes F. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1453-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Unknown host factors are also probably required during segregation, for example as tethers for plasmid pairing at the mid-cell position. The partition locus of multidrug-resistance plasmid TP228 consists of the tandem parF and parG genes and additional essential sequences located upstream of these genes (5.Hayes F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 528-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The ParF protein (22.0 kDa), a member of a distinctive subgroup of the ParA family, and ParG protein (8.6 kDa) assemble on the upstream region; ParG binds to this locus, and ParF is recruited through interactions with ParG, thereby forming a nucleoprotein complex whose precise architecture is likely to be crucial for correct partitioning (6.Barillà D. Hayes F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). ParG is dimeric (6.Barillà D. Hayes F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), consisting of a pair of unstructured N-terminal tails and intertwined, symmetric C-terminal domains that adopt a ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) 1The abbreviations used are: RHH, ribbon-helix-helix; CDO, catechol 2,3-dioxygenase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; IR, inverted repeat; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation. fold similar to that of the Arc/MetJ family of DNA binding transcriptional repressors (7.Golovanov A.P. Barillà D. Golovanova M. Hayes F. Lian L.Y. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1141-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The interaction of ParG with its binding sites in the region 5′ of parFG is presumed to occur via the double-stranded antiparallel β-structure of the RHH domain that is inserted into the DNA major groove in a manner analogous to Arc/MetJ-type transcriptional repressors (8.Somers W.S. Phillips S.E. Nature. 1992; 359: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 9.Gomis-Ruth F.X. Sola M. Acebo P. Parraga A. Guasch A. Eritja R. Gonzalez A. Espinosa M. del Solar G. Coll M.

Plasmid partition genes are organized in operons whose expression is precisely regulated. The control of partition gene expression is mediated, at least in part, by transcriptional autoregulation exerted by one or both of the partition proteins (11.Kusukawa N. Mori H. Kondo A. Hiraga S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 208: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12.Friedman S.A. Austin S.J. Plasmid. 1988; 19: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 13.Hayes F.

Microbiol. 2001; 40: 621-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The importance of this regulation is revealed by the perturbation that takes place in segregation when partition genes are overexpressed, especially when the partition site is coresident (11.Kusukawa N. Mori H. Kondo A. Hiraga S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 208: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13.Hayes F. Radnedge L. Davis M.A. Austin S.J. Mol.

Youngren B. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Inappropriate production of partition proteins might result in their permanent occupation of the partition site, which could interfere with the migration of replication and transcription complexes (17.Youngren B. Austin S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18.Sawitzke J.A. Li Y. Sergueev K. Youngren B. Brendler T. Jones K. Austin S. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2447-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The experiments presented here establish that the flexible N termini of dimeric ParG are essential for the organization of a stable quaternary protein complex on the parFG operator site and thus play a crucial regulatory role. This is achieved by transient associations between the flexible and folded domains in complex with the target DNA. Strains and Media—Escherichia coli was grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium with appropriate antibiotics when needed. MacConkey agar plates with 1% maltose were used for two-hybrid assays. Strain DH5α was used for cloning, BL21(DE3) (Novagen) for protein overproduction and reporter assays, and SP850 (19.Shah S. Peterkofsky A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3238-3242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was employed for two-hybrid analysis. Plasmids and Proteins—The parG gene previously was amplified by PCR and cloned in pET22b(+) for ParG overproduction and in pT18 and pT25 vectors for two-hybrid analysis (6.Barillà D. Hayes F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Deletions in which 27, 57, and 90 bp were removed from the 5′-end of parG were constructed by PCR amplification and also cloned in pET22b(+), pT18, and pT25 vectors. Deletion proteins were purified as described for full-length ParG (6.Barillà D. Hayes F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A 117-bp DNA fragment covering the parFG promoter region and the first 30 bp downstream of the parF translational start was amplified using oligonucleotides 5′-CGTCGAATTCCATATTAACCTTTACTC-3′ and 5′-GATAGGATCCTTTCGGATT-3′. This fragment was cloned in the BamHI site of plasmid pDM3.0 (20.Macartney D.P. Williams D.R. Stafford T. Thomas C.M. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2167-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to generate a transcriptional fusion to the xylE reporter gene (pDM-Oper). Two-hybrid Analysis—ParG-mediated association and functional complementation of the T18 and T25 fragments of the catalytic domain of Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase leads to cAMP synthesis, which triggers transcriptional activation of the maltose operon (6.Barillà D. Hayes F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This results in red colonies on MacConkey plates with maltose at 30 °C or white colonies when this operon is not activated (21.Karimova G. Pidoux J. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). Pentapeptide scanning mutagenesis of ParG produced by the pT25 vector was performed as described previously (22.Hallet B. Sherratt D.J. Hayes F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1866-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23.Hayes F. Hallet B.

Genet. 2003; 37: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) with the aim of assaying the effect of the insertions on protein dimerization using two-hybrid analysis. Chemical Cross-linking—Chemical cross-linking was performed using dimethyl pimelimidate (10 mm) (Sigma) as cross-linking agent and 20 μm protein according to the protocol detailed elsewhere (6.Barillà D. Hayes F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Sedimentation Velocity Analysis—Proteins (∼1 mg/ml) were centrifuged in a 1.2-cm path length two-sector aluminum centerpiece cell in an An-60 Ti analytical rotor at 50,000 rpm in an Optima XL-I ultracentrifuge (Beckman) at 20 °C. Solute concentration changes were detected by Rayleigh interference and by monitoring A275. Results were subjected to g(s*) analysis (25.Stafford III, W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) using DCDT+ Version 1.13 (26.Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and to whole boundary analysis using Sedfit Version 8.0 (27.Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3065) Google Scholar). CDO Reporter Assays—E. coli BL21(DE3) was transformed with pDM3.0 or pDM-Oper or with pDM-Oper and pET22b derivatives carrying full-length parG or 5′-parG deletions. A colony was inoculated in Luria-Bertani broth under selective conditions and incubated at 37 °C until A600 ∼0.5. Cells were incubated for an additional 1 h before pelleting and resuspending in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with 10% acetone. After sonication, the cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. CDO activity was measured by monitoring the A375 change for 1 min at 24 °C with 0.2 mm catechol. Measurements were performed at least in triplicate, each from an independent culture containing the plasmids. One CDO unit is the amount of enzyme that oxidizes 1 μmol catechol/min at 24 °C (28.Sala-Trepat J.M. Evans W.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 20: 400-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Biotinylated DNA substrates were a 48-bp oligonucleotide corresponding to the parFG operator (FS-48), a replica of this oligonucleotide in which one half of the palindrome was randomized (HS-48), and a shorter fragment (HS-23) covering one half-site (see Fig. 3E). Oligonucleotides (1 nm) were incubated at 25 °C for 20 min in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5% glycerol, 0.05 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) with different amounts of ParG proteins. Reactions were electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide native gels in TBE (Tris borate-EDTA) buffer and blotted onto positively charged nylon membranes (Roche Applied Science). DNA was immobilized by UV cross-linking and detected using the LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce). Surface Plasmon Resonance—Surface plasmon resonance measurements used a Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore AB). The surface of the CM5 sensor chip (Biacore) was sensitized using the Amine Coupling kit (Biacore AB) and coated with extravidin (Sigma). The same oligonucleotides used in EMSA were bound to the chip surface with the same resonance units to facilitate comparison of results between different substrates. An oligonucleotide with an identical base composition to FS-48 but with an unrelated sequence was bound to one flow cell as a reference. Proteins were injected in running buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.005% Tween 20) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Data were reference-subtracted using the oligonucleotide of unrelated sequence and analyzed using Biaevaluation 3.1 software (Biacore AB). Ferguson Analysis—Δ9ParG-FS-48 and Δ9ParG-HS-48 complexes and accurate protein standards were electrophoresed in polyacrylamide gels ranging from 7 to 12% and stained with Coomassie Blue. Logarithms of the relative migrations of each species were plotted against acrylamide concentration. The log10 of the negative slope of each line (retardation coefficient) was plotted against the log10 of the molecular weight, and molecular weights of protein-DNA complexes were determined from the resulting linear plot (29.Orchard K. May G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3335-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism (CD) Measurements—CD spectra in the near UV region (250-320 nm) were measured in a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter using a path length of 0.1 cm at 20 °C. ParG (10 μm) and FS-48 (1.25-20 μm) were prepared in CD buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl) and incubated at 20 °C for 20 min before recording the CD spectra. The stoichiometry of the ParG-FS-48 complex was determined by normalizing the change of ellipticity at 273 nm of the DNA in solution and in complex with ParG. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR measurements were performed on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer with a triple resonance CryoProbe. Sequence-specific resonance assignment of ParG used three-dimensional 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC and NOESY-HSQC spectra with uniformly 15N-labeled protein (1 mm). Spectra were acquired at T = 293 K. Proton chemical shifts were referenced to the methyl resonance of sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate at 0 ppm. Chemical shift mapping analysis used proteins (50-100 μm) in buffer containing 90% H2O, 10% 2H2O, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mm arginine, 40 mm glutamate, pH 5.5. Arginine and glutamate were added to reduce protein aggregation and to increase the concentration of soluble protein (30.Golovanov A.P. Hautbergue G.M. Wilson S.A. Lian L.Y. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8933-8939Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Time domain spectral data were processed by NMRPipe (31.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar), and spectra were visualized and assigned with NmrView (32.Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). Weighted amide chemical shift differences δ in spectra 1 and 2 resulting from deletion mutations or DNA binding were measured as shown in Equation 1 δ1−2=(δ1H−δ2H)+((δ1N−δ2N)/10)2(Eq. 1) where δH and δN are proton and nitrogen chemical shifts, respectively. If signals disappeared from the spectra, arbitrary values of δ >0.1ppm were assigned solely to represent this. NMR Analysis of Protein Complexes with FS-48—FS-48 oligonucleotide (80 μm) in 2 ml of NMR buffer was split in four equal aliquots. Concentrated protein solutions (50 μl) were added to 0.5 ml of DNA solution so that the concentration of dimeric protein in each case was <75 μm, allowing only one binding site to be occupied on each oligonucleotide. ParG Dimerization Does Not Require the Unstructured N-terminal Tail—ParG self-association can be monitored in vivo using a two-hybrid system based on reconstitution of adenylate cyclase activity in E. coli (6.Barillà D. Hayes F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21.Karimova G. Pidoux J. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). A set of ParG derivatives with insertions at 13 different positions was constructed by pentapeptide scanning mutagenesis (22.Hallet B. Sherratt D.J. Hayes F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1866-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23.Hayes F. Hallet B. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 571-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 24.Hayes F. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). None of nine insertions in the ParG N-terminal tail detectably affected the association with wild-type ParG in two-hybrid analysis (Fig. 1A). In contrast, all four pentapeptide insertions in the folded domain abolished heterodimerization with wild-type ParG (Fig. 1A). The preceding pentapeptide insertions influence the sequence and composition of the ParG flexible tail but alter tail length less dramatically. More radical modifications of the N-terminal tail involved deleting 9, 19, and 30 residues (Δ9ParG, Δ19ParG, and Δ30ParG, respectively) (Fig. 1A). These deletions were chosen on the basis of NMR data that showed variations in the dynamic characteristics of the N-terminal domain, suggesting that this domain is not wholly a random coil (7.Golovanov A.P. Barillà D. Golovanova M. Hayes F. Lian L.Y. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1141-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The deletion variants both interacted with wild-type ParG (Fig. 1B) and self-associated (Fig. 1C) in the two-hybrid system as readily as full-length ParG. In chemical cross-linking, ParG principally forms dimeric species (6.Barillà D. Hayes F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Δ9ParG, Δ19ParG, and Δ30ParG displayed similar patterns over a range of incubation temperatures (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, sedimentation velocity measurements revealed the predominant presence of a single dimeric species for each of the three proteins (Fig. 1E), similar to results obtained from analytical ultracentrifugation studies of full-length ParG (6.Barillà D. Hayes F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Taken collectively, the two-hybrid, cross-linking, and sedimentation velocity data conclusively demonstrate that the N-terminal mobile tail of ParG plays no detectable role in dimerization. ParG Is the Autorepressor of the parFG Genes and Interacts with an Operator Site That Overlaps the Putative parFG Promoter—A 259-bp fragment upstream of the parF translational start codon is necessary for plasmid partitioning (5.Hayes F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 528-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and is bound by ParG (6.Barillà D. Hayes F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The 80-bp region immediately upstream of the parF initiation codon includes an inverted repeat (IR) that consists of imperfect 16-bp half-sites separated by a 4-bp spacer (see Fig. 3E). In silico analysis pinpointed the probable parFG promoter to the 5′-end of the 80-bp region. The candidate -10 and -35 elements for this promoter each contain 4/6 matches to the consensus promoter for σ70 of E. coli, with optimal separation of the boxes. The -10 element overlaps the left half-site of the 36-bp IR (Fig. 2, inset). This organization suggests that the IR is an operator site implicated in regulation of parFG expression. To assess the role of the upstream region in parFG expression, a xylE transcriptional fusion was constructed by cloning a 117-bp fragment covering the promoter, IR, and 5′-end of parF in a promoterless xylE cassette in plasmid pDM3.0 (Fig. 2). This fusion produced 301 ± 15 catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (CDO) units, compared with the low activity of the promoterless plasmid (∼0.5 CDO units), demonstrating that the parFG promoter is indeed located in the short region immediately upstream of the parF translational start. The ParG protein was provided from a pET22b(+) expression vector, and its effect in CDO assays was examined to assess whether it was a transcriptional repressor of the parFG promoter. Expression of the parF-xylE fusion was reduced 20-fold from 360 ± 25 CDO units in the presence of pET22b(+) to 18 ± 7 units in the presence of ParG (Fig. 2). To test the role of the IR in this repression, the rightward half of the palindrome was scrambled to a similar sequence to that present in the in vitro substrate HS-48 (Fig. 3). CDO production from a construct containing the mutated IR was similar to that from the unmutated plasmid, demonstrating that promoter activity is unaltered by the mutations. However, ParG repressed expression from this promoter only 3-fold. These results demonstrate that ParG is a transcriptional repressor of parFG expression and that the IR is an operator site required for this repression. The interaction between ParG and the IR region was explored further by EMSA with a biotinylated 48-bp oligonucleotide covering the IR (FS-48) (Fig. 3E). ParG formed two well defined complexes (I and II) with this substrate that eventually resolved into the more slowly migrating species (II) at high protein concentration (Fig. 3A). ParG did not retard a half-site of the IR located on either a 23-bp oligonucleotide (HS-23) (Fig. 3A) or on a 28-bp substrate bearing 6-bp extensions on both ends of the half-site (data not shown). In contrast, a substrate (HS-48) in which the right half-site of FS-48 was randomized formed a single complex with a migration similar to complex I (Fig. 3A). Thus, although ParG does not associate with an isolated half-site (HS-23), addition of the unrelated sequence in HS-48 stabilizes the interaction, perhaps by the association of ParG dimers bound to opposite half-sites. In this case, ParG bound to the intact half-site might be positioning additional ParG protomers non-specifically on the randomized sequences. The stoichiometry of ParG bound to FS-48 was assessed by a variation of the Ferguson method (33.Ferguson K.A. Metabolism. 1964; 13: 985-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar) adapted for protein-DNA complexes (29.Orchard K. May G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3335-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Gel filtration, analytical ultracentrifugation, and dynamic light scattering showed that the mobile tail of ParG greatly increases its hydrodynamic radius. 2F. Hayes, D. Barillà, and E. Carmelo, unpublished data. To reduce this effect, Δ9ParG was selected for Ferguson analysis as it retains the activities of full-length ParG in EMSA (see following section) but lacks approximately one-third of the tail. A set of protein standards and complexes I and II formed between Δ9ParG and FS-48 or HS-48 were analyzed in gels containing 7-12% acrylamide. The relative migrations of the main bands were plotted against the polyacrylamide concentrations of the gels (Fig. 4A). The retardation coefficients were represented against the molecular masses, and the sizes of the nucleoprotein complexes were estimated from the resulting plot (Fig. 4B). This yielded molecular masses of 72 and 101 kDa for complexes I and II, respectively. These figures are in close agreement with the 64.5 kDa calculated for complexes formed by FS-48 and two Δ9ParG dimers (29.5 kDa DNA + 2 × 17.5 kDa protein) and 99.5 kDa for FS-48 and four Δ9ParG dimers (29.5 kDa DNA + 4 × 17.5 kDa protein). The ParG:FS-48 binding stoichiometry was also analyzed by CD measurements, showing an increase of ellipticity at 273 nm caused by the titration of ParG with FS-48 compared with the free DNA. Fig. 4C shows the quantitative monitoring of that change, plotted as a percentage of the maximum change. The plot indicates that the ellipticity variations attain a plateau at a 4:1 molar ratio of ParG dimers:FS-48, establishing a complex similar to the previously described complex II. The N-terminal Tail Is Required for Repression and Modifies the Interaction of ParG with Its Operator Site—The Δ9ParG, Δ19ParG, and Δ30ParG derivatives were examined for repression of the parF-xylE reporter to assess whether the unstructured tail influences transcriptional repression by ParG (Fig. 2). Expression of the fusion was strongly repressed by Δ9ParG (13 ± 6.6 CDO units), producing a repression ratio very similar to that determined for full-length ParG (Fig. 2). In contrast, repression of the parFG promoter was dramatically reduced for Δ19ParG and Δ30ParG, which had repression ratios of only 2.3- and 1.5-fold, respectively. Thus the unstructured tail of ParG plays a crucial role in transcriptional repression of the parFG promoter, and increasingly longer deletions of the tail are accompanied by progressively weaker repression. The involvement of the N-terminal tail in the interaction of ParG with the operator was investigated further by EMSA (Fig. 3, B-D). Δ9ParG and Δ19ParG displayed patterns of binding to FS-48 that were very similar to those observed for ParG: complex I was most evident at low protein concentrations, with the appearance of complex II at higher protein:DNA ratios. For Δ9ParG and Δ19ParG, a large proportion of the substrate was bound into complex II at the highest protein concentration (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, interaction of Δ30ParG with FS-48 produced a smeared band with a different migration from either complexes I or II, suggesting that the association of Δ30ParG with the substrate was particularly perturbed (Fig. 3D). The singular behavior of Δ30ParG was emphasized by experiments with HS-48, with which the protein failed to form a defined complex, only smearing it from the unbound position. In contrast, Δ9ParG and Δ19ParG both associated with HS-48 with similar patterns as full-length ParG, producing complex I in each case. Like ParG, none of the deletion proteins interacted detectably with HS-23. Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed to quantitate the ParG-operator interactions. Using a Biacore 3000 instrument, a CM Sensor Chip (Biacore) was extravidin coated and derivatized with FS-48 in Flow-Cell (FC) 1, HS-48 in FC2, and 48 bp of unrelated DNA as a reference in FC3. Proteins were passed over the chip surfaces at 0.05-5 μm (monomer equivalents) for 60 s (association) and allowed to wash off subsequently for 450 s (dissociation). ParG and the N-terminal deletion variants bound strongly to FS-48 at a concentration of 0.5 μm (Fig. 5A), and a similar effect was observed at every protein concentration tested (data not shown). Nevertheless, the interaction with this target was different between the proteins. Δ9ParG reproducibly gave the strongest response with FS-48, as opposed to Δ19ParG whose response was much weaker. Sensorgrams of ParG, Δ9ParG, and Δ19ParG had noticeably curved association and dissociation phases, strikingly different from those of Δ30ParG, which presented a much flatter pattern particularly in the dissociation phase when the slope was almost horizontal. The observation in EMSA analysis that ParG established two different complexes with FS-48 suggested that ParG and the N-terminal deletion derivatives follow a complex model in operator site binding. None of the kinetic models proposed by BIAevaluation 3.1 software gave a satisfactory close curve fitting for thi"

We report here the isolation and the structural and functional characterization of a new lipomannan variant present in the Pseudonocardineae, Saccharothrix aerocolonigenes, designated SaeLM. Using a range of chemical degradations, NMR experiments, and mass spectrometry analyses, SaeLM revealed a mannosylphosphatidyl-myo-inositol (MPI) anchor glycosylated by an original carbohydrate structure whereby an (α1→6)-Manp backbone is substituted at >80% of the O-2 position by side chains composed of Manp-(α1→2)-Manp-(α1→. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis indicated a distribution of SaeLM glyco-forms ranging from 19 to 61 Manp units, which centered on species containing 37 or 40 Manp units. SaeLM induced a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2)-dependent production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) by human THP-1 monocyte/macrophage cell lines and interestingly was found to be the strongest inducer of this pro-inflammatory cytokine when compared with other LAM/LM-like molecules.

The non-reducing termini of the arabinosyl side chains can be substituted by capping motifs, yielding to the classification of LAM into three families. LAM from slow growing mycobacteria bearing mannose caps, i.e. mono- or (α1→2)-di- or tri-mannoside units, are designated as ManLAM. In contrast, LAM from fast growing mycobacteria capped by phospho-myo-inositol units or not capped at all are termed PILAM and AraLAM, respectively (4.Nigou J. Gilleron M. Puzo G. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). LAM and LM exhibit a broad spectrum of immunomodulatory activities, including the ability to modulate the production of macrophage-derived Th1 pro-inflammatory cytokines, most commonly TNF-α and IL-12. For example, ManLAM are able to inhibit the LPS-induced production of IL-12 and TNF-α (7.Knutson K.L. Hmama Z. Herrera-Velit P. Rochford R. Reiner N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 645-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 8.Nigou J. Zelle-Rieser C. Gilleron M. Thurnher M. Puzo G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7477-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). So, ManLAM contributes, via an immunosuppressive effect, to the persistence of slow-growing mycobacteria in the human reservoir. ManLAM anti-inflammatory activity has also been shown to require the interaction of ManLAM with the mannose receptor and/or dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing non-integrin via the mannose capping motifs (8.Nigou J.

In contrast, PILAM are able to induce the release of a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the activation of Toll-like receptors 2 (TLR-2) (11.Gilleron M. Himoudi N. Adam O. Constant P.

This activity is likely to require PI caps, because AraLAM does not show any activity (14.Guerardel Y. Maes E. Elass E. Leroy Y. Timmerman P. Besra G.S. Locht C. Strecker G. Kremer L. J. Biol.

Early studies demonstrated that LM from Mycobacterium sp. induce expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (15.Barnes P.F. Chatterjee D. Abrams J.S. Lu S. Wang E. Yamamura M. Brennan P.J. Modlin R.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 541-547PubMed Google Scholar). A set of recent reports have shown that LM from both pathogenic and non-pathogenic mycobacterial species, independent of their origin, were potent stimulators of TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-12 (16.Vignal C.

Porcelli S.A. Briken V. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 2067-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Furthermore, LM was shown to activate macrophages in a TLR-2-dependent, and TLR-4- and TLR-6-independent manner (16.Vignal C. Guerardel Y. Kremer L. Masson M. Legrand D. Mazurier J. Elass E. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 2014-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17.Quesniaux V.J. Nicolle D.M. Torres D. Kremer L. Guerardel Y. Nigou J. Puzo G. Erard F. Ryffel B. J.

Indeed, according to their activity, lipoglycans are therefore likely to favor either the persistence or the killing of the corresponding mycobacteria (3.Nigou J. Gilleron M. Rojas M. Garcia L.F. Thurnher M. Puzo G. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).

The molecular bases of LM/LAM pro-versus anti-inflammatory activities are not yet fully understood. Nevertheless, it seems clear that LM or the lipomannan moiety of LAM bear the intrinsic capacity to induce the production of TNF-α and IL-12 (16.Vignal C. Guerardel Y. Kremer L. Masson M. Legrand D.

However, the presence of the arabinan moiety on LAM inhibits the pro-inflammatory activity, presumably by masking the mannan core (23.Sidobre S. Nigou J. Puzo G. Riviere M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2415-2422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 24.Sidobre S. Puzo G. Riviere M. Biochem.

Also, the type of capping motifs may then direct LAM activity toward a pro-(PILAM) or anti-(ManLAM) inflammatory activity (3.Nigou J. Gilleron M. Rojas M. Garcia L.F. Thurnher M. Puzo G. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Further insights into deciphering these complex molecular interactions could benefit from the structural and functional characterization of LAM variants. Indeed, lipoglycans are not restricted to members of the mycobacteria, and a number of non-mycobacterial lipoglycans have been isolated and characterized in several actinomycete genera, including Rhodococcus (25.Garton N.J. Gilleron M. Brando T. Dan H.H. Giguere S. Puzo G. Prescott J.F. Sutcliffe I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31722-31733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 26.Gibson K.J.

Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 854-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and Tsukamurella (22.Gibson K.J. Gilleron M. Constant P. Brando T. Puzo G. Besra G.S. Nigou J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22973-22982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the latter study, we demonstrated that LAM from Tsukamurella paurometabola (TpaLAM) possesses a similar structural prototype when compared with mycobacterial LAM, with distinct mannan and arabinan domains, yet had weak biological activity (22.Gibson K.J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 22973-22982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); however, upon chemical degradation of the arabinan domain, the resulting lipomannan moiety elicited a powerful pro-inflammatory response as previously demonstrated with ManLAM (16.Vignal C. Guerardel Y. Kremer L. Masson M. Legrand D. Mazurier J. Elass E. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 2014-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the TpaLAM lipomannan moiety is composed of a linear (α1→6)-Manp chain linked to the MPI anchor demonstrating that this structure alone is sufficient in providing pro-inflammatory activity, and that, importantly, the branched t-Manp units are not necessarily required (22.Gibson K.J.

In the present study we report the isolation, structural, and functional characterization of a LM molecule from the Pseudonocardineae, Saccharothrix aerocolonigenes (31.Stackebrandt E. Rainey F.A. Ward-Rainey N.L. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1997; 47: 479-491Crossref Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). The investigation revealed an original structure, and, furthermore, we demonstrate that LM possessed potent pro-inflammatory activity. As such, the structure/function relationship of the lipomannan is discussed, enabling further insights into the molecular basis of lipoglycan-mediated inflammatory responses. Bacteria and Growth Conditions—S. aerocolonigenes, type strain DSM 40034 (S. aerocolonigenes subsp. aerocolonigenes, recently renamed as Lechevaliera aerocolonigenes (32.Labeda D.P. Hatano K. Kroppenstedt R.M. Tamura T. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2001; 51: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)) was purchased from DSMZ, Germany. It was routinely grown at 30 °C in GYM streptomyces medium, which contained 4 g of glucose, 4 g of yeast extract, and 10 g of maltose per liter of deionized water supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) Tween 80. Cells were grown to late log phase and harvested by centrifugation, washed, and lyophilized. Purification of SaeLM—Purification procedures were adapted from protocols established for the extraction and purification of mycobacterial lipoglycans (33.Nigou J. Gilleron M. Cahuzac B. Bounery J.D. Herold M. Thurnher M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23094-23103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 34.Ludwiczak P. Gilleron M. Bordat Y. Martin C. Gicquel B. Puzo G. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were delipidated at 60 °C by mixing in CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1, v/v) overnight. The organic extract was removed by filtration, and the delipidated biomass was resuspended in deionized water and disrupted by sonication (MSE Soniprep, 12 micro amplitude, 60 s on then 90 s off for 10 cycles, on ice). The cellular glycans and lipoglycans were further extracted by refluxing the broken cells in 50% ethanol at 65 °C overnight. Contaminating proteins and glucans were removed by enzymatic degradation using protease and α-amylase treatments followed by dialysis. The resulting extract was resuspended in buffer A, 15% propan-1-ol in 50 mm ammonium acetate, and loaded onto an octyl-Sepharose CL-4B column (50 × 2.5 cm) and eluted with 400 ml of buffer A at 5 ml/h, enabling the removal of non-lipidic moieties. The retained lipoglycans were eluted with 400 ml of buffer B, 50% propan-1-ol in 50 mm ammonium acetate. The resulting lipoglycans were resuspended in buffer C, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate (w/v), 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris, pH 8, to a final concentration of 200 mg/ml and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-200 HR column (50 × 2.5 cm) and eluted with buffer C at a flow rate of 5 ml/h. Fractions (1.25 ml) were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by periodic acid-silver nitrate staining. The resulting lipoglycan fractions were pooled, dialyzed extensively against water, lyophilized, and stored at -20 °C. Preparation of Deacylated SaeLM—Deacylated SaeLM (dSaeLM) was obtained by incubating 100 μg of SaeLM with 200 μl of 0.1 n NaOH for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by extensive dialysis against water. MALDI/MS—The matrix used was 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid at a concentration of 10 μg/μl, in a mixture of water/ethanol (1:1, v/v). 0.5 μl of SaeLM, at a concentration of 10 μg/μl, was mixed with 0.5 μl of the matrix solution. Analyses were performed on a Voyager DE-STR MALDI-TOF instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) using linear mode detection. Mass spectra were recorded in the negative mode using a 300-ns time delay with a grid voltage of 95% of full accelerating voltage (24 kV) and a guide wire voltage of 0.05%. The mass spectra were mass assigned using external calibration. Fatty Acid Analysis—200 μg of SaeLM was deacylated using strong alkaline hydrolysis (200 μl of 1 m NaOH at 110 °C for 2 h). The reaction mixture was neutralized with HCl, and the liberated fatty acids were extracted three times with chloroform and, after drying under nitrogen, were methylated using three drops of 10% (w/w) BF3 in methanol (Fluka) at 60 °C for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of water, and the fatty acid methyl esters were extracted three times with chloroform. After drying, the fatty acid methyl esters were solubilized in 10 μl of pyridine and trimethyl-silylated using 10 μl of hexamethyl-disilazane and 5 μl of trimethylchlorosilane at room temperature for 15 min. After drying under a stream of nitrogen, the fatty acid derivatives were solubilized in cyclohexane before analysis by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Glycosidic Linkage Analysis—Glycosyl linkage composition was performed according to the modified procedure of Ciucanu and Kerek (35.Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3157) Google Scholar). The per-O-methylated SaeLM was hydrolyzed using 500 μl of 2 m trifluoroacetic acid at 110 °C for 2 h, reduced using 350 μl of a 10 mg/ml solution of NaBD4 (NH4OH 1 m/C2H5OH, 1:1, v/v), and per-O-acetylated using 300 μl of acetic anhydride for 1 h at 110 °C. The resulting alditol acetates were solubilized in cyclohexane before analysis by GC and GC/MS. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DMX-500 spectrometer equipped with a double resonance (1H/X)-BBi z-gradient probe head. SaeLM (20 mg) was exchanged in D2O (D, 99.97% from Euriso-top, Saint-Aubin, France), with intermediate lyophilization, then re-dissolved in 0.4 ml of Me2SO-d6 (D, 99.8% from Euriso-top), and analyzed in 200-× 5-mm 535-PP NMR tubes at 343 K. Data were processed on a Bruker-X32 workstation using the xwinnmr program. Proton and carbon chemical shifts are expressed in ppm and referenced relative to internal Me2SO signals at δH 2.52 and δC 40.98. The one-dimensional (1D) proton (1H) spectra were recorded using a 90° tipping angle for the pulse and 1 s as recycle delay between each of the 387 acquisitions of 1.64 s. The spectral width of 3,064 Hz was collected in 16,000 complex points that were multiplied by a Gaussian function (LB = -1, GB = 0.4) prior to processing to 32,000 real points in the frequency domain. After Fourier transformation, the spectra were base-line corrected with a fourth order polynomial function. The 1D 31P spectrum was measured at 202.46 MHz at 343 K and phosphoric acid (85%) was used as external reference (δP 0.0). The spectral width of 20 kHz was collected in 16,000 complex points that were multiplied by an exponential function (LB = 1 Hz) prior to processing to 32,000 real points in the frequency domain. The scan number was 256. Two-dimensional (2D) spectra were recorded without sample spinning, and data were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode using the time-proportional phase increment method. The 2D 1H-13C Heteronuclear Multiple Quantum Correlation (HMQC) and 1H-31P HMQC-HOHAHA were recorded in the proton-detected mode with a Bruker 5-mm 1H broad band tunable probe with reverse geometry. The globally optimized alternating-phase rectangular pulses (GARP) sequence (36.Shaka A.J. Barker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar) at the carbon or phosphorus frequency was used as a composite pulse decoupling during acquisition. The 1H-13C HMQC spectrum was obtained according to Bax and Subramanian pulse sequence (37.Bax A. Subramanian S. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 67: 565-569Google Scholar). Spectral widths of 25,154 Hz in 13C and 2200 Hz in 1H dimensions were used to collect a 2,048 × 512 (time-proportional phase increment) point data matrix with 56 scans/t1 value expanded to 4,096 × 1,024 by zero filling. The relaxation delay was 1 s. A sine bell window shifted by π/2 was applied in both dimensions. A 1H-13C HMBC spectrum was obtained using the Bax and Summers pulse sequence (38.Bax A. Summers M.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 2093-2094Crossref Scopus (3258) Google Scholar). Spectral widths of 25,154 Hz in 13C and 3,064 Hz in 1H dimensions were used to collect a 2,048 × 480 (time-proportional phase increment) point data matrix with 80 scans/t1 value expanded to 4,096 × 1,024 by zero filling. The relaxation delay was 1 s. A sine bell window shifted by π/2 was applied in both dimensions. A 1H-31P HMQC-HOHAHA spectrum was obtained using the Lerner and Bax pulse sequence (39.Lerner L. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 69: 375-380Google Scholar). Spectral widths of 1,620 Hz in 31P and 3,064 Hz in 1H dimensions were used to collect a 2,048 × 80 (time-proportional phase increment) point data matrix with 16 scans/t1 value expanded to 4,096 × 1,024 by zero filling. The relaxation delay was 1 s. A sine bell window shifted by π/2 was applied in both dimensions. The 2D 1H-1H HOHAHA spectrum was recorded using a MLEV-17 mixing sequence of 110 ms (40.Bax A. Davies D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar). The spectral width was 3,064 Hz in both F2 and F1 dimensions. 450 spectra of 4,096 data points with 24 scans/t1 increment were recorded. The 2D 1H-1H ROESY spectrum was acquired at a mixing time of 300 ms (41.Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 63: 207-213Google Scholar). The spectral width was 3,064 Hz in both dimensions. 512 spectra of 2,048 data points with 24 scans/t1 increment were recorded. TNF-α Production by Macrophages—A THP-1 monocyte/macrophage human cell line was maintained in continuous culture with RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C, as non-adherent cells. Purified native or modified SaeLM as well as the other stimuli were added in duplicate or triplicate to monocyte/macrophage cells (5 × 105 cells/well) in 24-well culture plates and then incubated for 20 h at 37 °C. Stimuli were previously incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml polymyxin B (Sigma) known to inhibit the effect of (contaminating) LPS (12.Adams L.B. Fukutomi Y. Krahenbuhl J.L. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4173-4181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the TLR dependence of TNF-α-inducing SaeLM activity, monoclonal anti-TLR-2 (clone TL2.1, eBioscience) or anti-TLR-4 (clone HTA125, Serotec) antibodies or an IgG2a isotype control (clone eBM2a, eBioscience) at concentrations of 10 and 20 μg/ml were added together with SaeLM to THP-1 cells. Supernatants from THP-1 cells were assayed for TNF-α by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using commercially available kits and according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems). LPS was from Escherichia coli 055:B5 (Sigma), ManLAM and LM were from Mycobacterium bovis BCG, and mahTpaLAM was from T. paurometabola (22.Gibson K.J. Gilleron M. Constant P. Brando T. Puzo G. Besra G.S. Nigou J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22973-22982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A lipoglycan that migrated in SDS-PAGE between Mycobacterium tuberculosis ManLAM and LM was purified from S. aerocolonigenes (Fig. 1). The lipoglycan contained mannose as the sole carbohydrate, myo-inositol, glycerol, and fatty acids. The predominant fatty acids identified by GC were 14-methylpentadecanoic (iC16:0) (33%), palmitic (C16:0) (20%), and octadecenoic (C18:1) (33%), with smaller amounts of stearic (C18:0) (6%), and various isomers of heptadecanoic (C17) (altogether 8%) acids. The lipoglycan exhibited the same basic components of a structure related to mycobacterial LM and was subsequently termed SaeLM. Mannan Backbone—The 1H NMR anomeric region of SaeLM was dominated by three signals at δ 5.03 (Ia1), δ 4.98 (IIa1), and δ 4.84 (IIIa1), with nearly identical intensities (Fig. 2A). As revealed by the 1H-13C HMQC spectrum, their corresponding anomeric carbons resonate at δ 101.4 (Ia1), δ 102.4 (IIa1), and δ 99.4 (IIIa1) (Fig. 2E). Anomeric proton and carbon resonances of the different spin systems were assigned from 2D 1H-13C HMQC (Fig. 2, D and E) and HMBC (Fig. 2C) and 1H-1H HOHAHA (Fig. 3C) and ROESY (Fig. 3D) experiments based on our previous studies with mycobacterial LAMs and LMs (42.Gilleron M.

Biol. 1999; 285: 2147-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The assignments are summarized in Table I. Spin systems Ia, IIa, and IIIa were unambiguously assigned to 2-α-Manp, t-α-Manp, and 2,6-α-Manp, respectively, in agreement with per-O-methylation data. The α-anomeric configuration was demonstrated through the magnitude of their 1JH1,C1 coupling constants determined as 174, 171, and 169 Hz for spin systems Ia, IIa, and IIIa, respectively (α-O-Me-Manp: 1JH-1,C-1 170 Hz; β-O-Me-Manp: 1JH-1,C-1 161 Hz (44.Bock K. Pedersen C.J. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Transac. 1974; 2: 293Crossref Google Scholar)). The pyranose ring was deduced from their δC-5 at 74.7, 73.1, and 74.2, respectively, and the presence on the 1H-13C HMBC spectrum (Fig. 2C) of cross-peaks between their H-1 and their respective C-5. 1H and 13C chemical shifts of spin system IIa (Table I) indicated an unsubstituted t-Manp unit (42.Gilleron M.

In this study, we report the x-ray crystal structure of the Bre5 NTF2-like domain and show that it forms a homodimeric structure that is similar to other NTF2-like domains, except for the presence of an intermolecular disulfide bond in the crystals. Sedimentation equilibrium studies reveal that under non-reducing conditions, the Bre5 NTF2-like domain is exclusively dimeric, whereas a disulfide bond-deficient mutant undergoes a monomer-dimer equilibrium with a dissociation constant in the midnanomolar range, suggesting that dimer formation and possibly also disulfide bond formation may modulate Bre5 function in vivo. Using deletion analysis, we also identify a novel N-terminal domain of Ubp3 that is necessary and sufficient for interaction with Bre5 and use isothermal titration calorimetry to show that Bre5 and Ubp3 form a 2:1 complex, in contrast to other reported NTF2-like domain/protein interactions that form 1:1 complexes. Finally, we employ structure-based mutagenesis to map the Ubp3 binding surface of Bre5 to a region near the Bre5 dimer interface and show that this binding surface of Bre5 is important for Ubp3 function in vivo. Together, these studies provide novel insights into protein recognition by NTF2-like domains and provide a molecular scaffold for understanding how Ubp3 function is regulated by Bre5 cofactor binding.

Studies over the last decade have provided important mechanistic insights into catalysis and substrate specificity of Ub conjugation by the E1/E2/E3 multiprotein system (1Pickart C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). However, relatively little mechanistic information is available on the proteins that mediate deubiquitination, despite mounting evidence that these proteins play as important a regulatory role in cellular processes as their Ub-conjugating counterparts (4Fischer J.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2003; 229: 43-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Deubiquitination is catalyzed by deubiquitinating proteases, which are classified into five groups based on sequence homology: ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs), ubiquitin-specific processing proteases (USPs in humans and UBPs in yeasts), OTU-domain ubiquitinaldehyde-binding proteins, Jab1/Pad1/MPN domain-containing metalloenzymes, and the ataxin-3-like proteases (5Kim J.H.

Aravind L. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Among the deubiquitinating protease families, UBPs represent the most widespread deubiquitylating enzymes across evolution. In particular, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome encodes for 16 UBPs and only one ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (13Amerik A.Y. Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Biol.

In the human genome, there appears to be at least 4 and 63 distinctive genes encoding ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases and UBPs/USPs, respectively (14Wing S.S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 590-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The observation that UBPs are abundant and broadly conserved in many species including bacteria, yeast, and humans, suggests that they might play important specific roles in regulating diverse biological processes. The molecular basis for how different UBPs select their cognate substrates and mediate distinct cellular functions is still unclear. Unlike the highly conserved ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases, the UBP family exhibits homology only in two regions that surround the catalytic Cys and His residues, thus called the Cys box (∼19-amino acid) and His box (60–90-amino acid) regions. Homology among the UBP enzymes is restricted to a roughly 350-residue catalytic core domain, whereas the UBPs contain variable N-terminal extensions, occasional C-terminal extensions, or insertions in the catalytic domains. Whereas the functions of these additional UBP domains are not well understood, recent studies have suggested that they function in substrate recognition, cofactor association (15Papa F.R. Amerik A.Y.

Whereas the human herpesvirus-associated USP has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for deubiquitination of its specific substrate, the p53 tumor suppressor (19Li M. Chen D. Shiloh A. Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Qin J. Gu W. Nature. 2002; 416: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar), other characterized UBPs have been shown to require additional protein cofactors for activity. For example, USP10, one of the human UBPs, required the Ras-GAP Src homology 3-binding protein, G3BP1, for catalytic activity (20Soncini C. Berdo I. Draetta G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3869-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Ubp3, the yeast homologue of human USP10, has been shown to form a complex with the Bre5 cofactor to specifically deubiquitinate the Sec23 (21Cohen M. Stutz F. Belgareh N. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Dargemont C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and β′-COP (22Cohen M. Stutz F. Dargemont C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51989-51992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) subunits of the COPII and COPI complexes that regulate anterograde and retrograde transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus (21Cohen M. Stutz F. Belgareh N. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Dargemont C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), respectively. Further analysis of the Ubp3-Bre5 complex reveals that Bre5 is an essential cofactor for Ubp3-mediated catalysis (21Cohen M. Stutz F. Belgareh N. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Dargemont C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Taken together, it appears that Bre5 is a key component of Ubp3-mediated function, although the molecular basis for this is currently not known. Yeast Bre5 has two recognizable domains, a nuclear transfer factor 2 (NTF2) domain at the N terminus (residues 8–140) and an RNA recognition motif (RRM) at the C terminus (residues 419–481), and Ubp3 contains no recognizable domains outside of its C-terminal catalytic domain. Although NTF2-like domains are found in many proteins with diverse functions, (23Bayliss R. Leung S.W. Baker R.P. Quimby B.B. Corbett A.H. Stewart M.

Indeed, deletion analysis of Bre5 reveals that its NTF2 domain, but not the RNA-binding domain, is necessary and sufficient to bind Ubp3 and is required for Ubp3 function in vivo (21Cohen M. Stutz F. Belgareh N. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Dargemont C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 22Cohen M. Stutz F. Dargemont C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51989-51992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), suggesting that the NTF2 domain of Bre5 may directly associate with Ubp3 to regulate its deubiquitination activity. The NTF2-like domains from NTF2 (23Bayliss R. Leung S.W. Baker R.P. Quimby B.B. Corbett A.H. Stewart M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2843-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 24Bullock T.L.

These studies reveal that this domain forms homo- or heterodimers with low micromolar affinity (30Chaillan-Huntington C. Butler P.J. Huntington J.A. Akin D. Feldherr C. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and that the NTF2-like dimers bind protein targets, some of which contain FXFG or FG repeats. Interestingly, although the various NTF2-like domain structures have similar overall dimeric folds, the region of the NTF2-like domain that is used for recognition of these repeats is not conserved among the different proteins, possibly reflecting the relatively low primary sequence homology between the NTF2-like domains (25Fribourg S. Conti E. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and their diverse biological roles (26Senay C. Ferrari P. Rocher C. Rieger K.J. Winter J. Platel D. Bourne Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48395-48403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Indeed, the observation that Ubp3 does not contain FXFG or FG repeats within its primary sequence suggests that its mode of recognition by the NTF2-like domain of Bre5 may also be novel. In this study, we employ biochemical and structural analysis to show that the NTF2-like domain of Bre5 forms a tight homodimer that directly associates with a folded domain within the N terminus of Ubp3. We also use the crystal structure of the Bre5 NTF2-like domain to inform structure-based mutagenesis to further characterize the molecular basis for the Bre5-Ubp3 interaction in vitro and show the importance of this interaction in vivo. Together, these studies provide new insights into protein recognition by NTF2-like domains and provide a molecular scaffold for understanding how Ubp3 function is regulated by Bre5 cofactor binding. Protein Preparation—The UBP3 gene was amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA and inserted into the pGEX5T expression vector for further subcloning. Ubp3 fragments encoding residues 1–912 (full-length), 50–912, 104–912, 189–912, and 260–912 were subcloned into the PET28a expression vector as C-terminal His6-tagged fusion proteins. DNA encoding residues 181–260 and 181–282 of Ubp3 was subcloned into the PGEX4T-1 expression vector for the preparation of N-terminal GST fusion proteins. DNA encoding residues 1–146 of Bre5 was PCR-amplified from pBTM116 and cloned into the pGEX4T-1 expression vector for the preparation of the N-terminal GST fusion protein. All Ubp3 and Bre5 expression plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) for protein expression. Transformed bacteria were initially grown at 37 °C to an absorbance of 0.7–0.9 at 600 nm, and protein overexpression induced by addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside followed by overnight growth at 15 °C. Cells were disrupted by sonication in a solution containing PBS buffer supplemented with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For the purification of His-tagged protein, the protein was partially purified using an Ni2+-NTA resin as described by the manufacturer and further purified using anion exchange (Q-Sepharose) and gel filtration (Superdex-200) in PBS buffer. For purification of GST-tagged proteins, the supernatant was partially purified using glutathione resin (Novagen) as described by the manufacturer. Unfused Bre5-(1–146) was prepared by treating a slurry of the resin-bound GST fusion proteins with thrombin (10 units/mg fused protein) overnight at 4 °C, and the untagged Bre5 protein was eluted with PBS buffer. Bre5-(1–146) was further purified with gel filtration (Superdex-75) in PBS buffer. Protein purity was judged to be greater than 90% by SDS-PAGE, and the protein was concentrated to 10–20 mg/ml in PBS for storage at -70 °C. Selenomethionine-derivatized Bre5-(1–146) was overexpressed from pGEX4T-Bre5-(1–146) transformed bacterial strain B834 (DE3) (Novagen) and grown in MOPS-based minimal medium. Selenomethionine-derivatived protein was purified and stored essentially as described for the underivatized protein. All site-directed Bre5-(1–146) mutations were prepared with the appropriate primers and the QuikChange mutagenesis kit essentially as described by the manufacturer (Stratagene), and the mutant proteins were purified essentially as described for the wild-type protein. The secondary structure of Bre5 protein fragments was analyzed using circular dichroism on a 62A DS spectropolarimeter (Aviv Associates, Lakewood, NJ) by using 300 μl of the respective sample at 10 °C. The protein concentration was about 30 μm in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Sedimentation Equilibrium Analysis of Bre5—The oligomerization properties of Bre5-(1–146) and the C117A mutant were analyzed using sedimentation equilibrium on a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 100 mm NaCl. Three starting protein concentrations (0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 mg/ml) and three centrifugation speeds (22,000, 30,000, and 40,000 rpm) were used with absorption optics for analysis. After equilibrium at each speed, as assessed by comparison of absorbance optics using the MATCH program, data editing was performed using the REEDIT program (both programs were provided by the National Analytical Ultracentrifugation Facility, Storrs, CT). The NONLIN program (31Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar) was used to globally fit several scans for each set of experiments. NONLIN fits used an effective reduced molecular weight of σ. For models of associating systems, σ was held at the correct value based on the known monomer molecular weight of the proteins and equilibrium constants were fitted as lnK. These values were converted to dissociation constants with the appropriate molar units. The fit quality of the models for all of the experiments was determined by examination of residuals and by minimization of the fit variance. In Vitro Bre5-Ubp3 Binding Studies—For pull-down assays, GST-Bre5-(1–146) protein (50 μm in PBS buffer) was incubated with purified His-Ubp3 deletion constructs (50 μm in PBS buffer) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by immobilization on 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS buffer, and 10-μl aliquots were mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS-loading buffer and analyzed on SDS-PAGE. All isothermal titration calorimetry measurements were carried out using a MicroCal VP-ITC isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal, Inc.), and each experiment was carried out in duplicate. Untagged Ubp3-(181–282) protein was diluted to 50 μm in PBS buffer and added to the 1.4-ml sample cell, and a 0.3–0.5 mm solution of wild-type or mutant Bre5-(1–146) protein titrant was loaded into the injection syringe. For each titration experiment, a 60-s delay at the start of the experiment was followed by 35 injections of 10 μl of the titrant solution. The sample cell was stirred at 300 rpm throughout and maintained at 15 °C. Titration data were analyzed using the Origin 5.0 software supplied by MicroCal Inc., and data sets were corrected for base-line heats of dilutions from control runs as appropriate. The corrected data were then fit to a theoretical titration curve describing one binding site per titrant. The area under each peak of the resultant heat profile was integrated and plotted against the molar ratio of Ubp3 to Bre5. A nonlinear best fit binding isotherm for the data was used to calculate Ubp3/Bre5 stoichiometry, dissociation constant, and standard enthalpy change. In Vivo Sec23 Deubiquitination and Growth Assays—Yeast cultures were grown either in rich medium (YPD; Q-Biogen) or in minimal medium (SD) containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base with ammonium sulfate, 2% dextrose, and supplemented with appropriate nutrients (32Orci L.

Yeast transformations were performed with standard procedures and preparation of the Bre5Δ strain as previously described (22Cohen M. Stutz F. Dargemont C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51989-51992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The preparation of fusion proteins between Bre5 or its truncated versions with the LexA DNA binding domain expressed from the pBTM116 plasmid has been previously described (22Cohen M. Stutz F. Dargemont C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51989-51992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The point mutations in Bre5-HisY42D, Bre5-HisR139D, and Bre5-HisY42R139D as well as the C-terminal His tag were introduced by PCR, and the resulting products were cloned into BamH1/XhoI sites of the P426-ADH plasmid (33Clemens K.E. Brent R. Gyuris J. Munger K. Virology. 1995; 214: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Yeast cells grown in YPD or minimal medium were collected during the exponential growth phase (A600 = 2 or 0.8, respectively). Total protein extracts were prepared by the NaOH-TCA lysis method (21Cohen M. Stutz F. Belgareh N. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Dargemont C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Protein samples were separated by 7% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, probed with appropriate antibodies, and detected with chemiluminescence protein immunoblotting reagents (Pierce). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Sec23p (1:400 dilution) were kindly provided by B. Lesch and R. Schekman, and mouse monoclonal antibody anti-His and rabbit polyclonal antibody anti-Lex were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and Invitrogen, respectively. Growth assays of vector-transformed cells at different pH values were carried out as described above except that parallel growths were carried out at pH 6.5 and 8.0, and growth was monitored by cell plating. Crystallization and Structure Determination of Bre5-(1–146)—Crystals of Bre5-(1–146) were grown at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. 2 μl of protein solution at 14 mg/ml (0.87 mm) in buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm DTT, and 100 mm NaCl) was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 25% polyethylene glycol 3350, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 0.25 m ammonium sulfate and equilibrating over 0.5 ml of reservoir solution. Crystals grew to a typical size of 200 × 100 × 100 μm over 3 days and were flash frozen in a reservoir solution supplemented with 20% glycerol for storage in solid propane prior to data collection. Single wavelength native and three-wavelength (peak, inflection, and remote) multiple anomalous diffraction data for selenium-derivatized crystals were collected on beamline X25 at the Brookhaven National Laboratories using an ADSC Quantum-4 CCD detector at 100 K. All data were processed with the HKL 2000 suite (HKL Research Inc.), and the relevant statistics are summarized in Table I. Three selenium sites were identified using CNS and SOLVE (34Brunger A.T.

Phases were combined using CNS, and the resulting experimental electron density map was improved by solvent flipping density modification. The program O (36Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A Found. Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13016) Google Scholar) was used to build the model of the protein using the selenomethionine positions as guides. Model refinement employed simulated annealing and torsion angle dynamic refinement protocols in CNS with iterative manual adjustments of the model using the program O, with reference to 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps. Toward the later stages of refinement, individual atomic B-factors were adjusted, and solvent molecules were modeled into the electron density map. The final model was checked for errors with a composite-simulated annealing omit map. A final round of refinement resulted in a model with good refinement statistics and geometry (Table I).Table IData collection, phasing, and structure refinement statisticsData statisticsSe-MADNativeSpace groupP6122P6122a (Å)90.90190.909b (Å)90.90190.909c (Å)195.220194.866Wavelength (Å)0.97950.97940.95000.9790Resolution (Å)50-2.150-2.150-2.150-2.1Unique reflections28,58028,70028,80328,566Completeness (%)aValues in parentheses are from the highest resolution shell99.5 (100)99.5 (100)99.5 (100)99.2(99.6)Multiplicity21.221.221.810.4I/Io38.1 (13.5)46.5 (10.5)43.8 (7.4)28.3 (8.7)Rmerge (%)bRmerge = Σ|I - 〈I〉|/Σ〈I〉7.3 (28.9)6.7 (37.0)8.0 (51.7)7.6 (37.9)Phasing (SOLVE)FOM0.53Z-score23.3Refinement statisticsResolution (Å)50-2.1Rfree (%)cRfree = ΣT||Fo| - |Fc||/ΣTb|Fo| (where T is a test data set of 5% for Bre5 of the total reflections randomly chosen and set aside prior to refinement)21.8Rworking (%)dRworking = Σ||Fo| - |Fc||/Σ|Fo|19.4No. of protein atoms/B-factors (Å2)2103/33.2No. of protein atoms/B-factors (Å2)146/42.9Root mean square deviationsBond length (Å)0.033Bond angle (degrees)2.4a Values in parentheses are from the highest resolution shellb Rmerge = Σ|I - 〈I〉|/Σ〈I〉c Rfree = ΣT||Fo| - |Fc||/ΣTb|Fo| (where T is a test data set of 5% for Bre5 of the total reflections randomly chosen and set aside prior to refinement)d Rworking = Σ||Fo| - |Fc||/Σ|Fo| Open table in a new tab Mapping and Characterization of the Bre5 Binding Site in Ubp3—We employed a GST-Bre5 fusion protein harboring the NTF2-like domain of Bre5 ((GST-Bre5-(1–146)) and His6-tagged Ubp3 fusion proteins to map the Bre5 binding site in Ubp3. Initial pull-down experiments (data not shown) revealed that GST-Bre5-(1–146) did not show detectable interaction with the C-terminal catalytic domain of Ubp3 (residues 389–912). Based on this, we tested whether the N-terminal region of Ubp3 mediated Bre5 interaction. To address this possibility, we prepared a series of N-terminal Ubp3 deletion constructs (deleting about 50 residues at a time) for GST pull-down experiments. Specifically, we prepared His6 fusion proteins containing Ubp3-(1–912), -(50–912), -(150–912), -(189–912), and -(260–912) (Fig. 1a). As can be seen in Fig. 1b, each of the Ubp3 deletion constructs, except for Ubp3-(260–912), were pulled down with GST-Bre5-(1–146) at levels comparable with the intact protein. The His-Ubp3-(260–916) deletion construct did not show any pull-down with GST-Bre5-(1–146). These experiments revealed that a region within residues 189–260 of Ubp3 is necessary for interaction with the Bre5 NTF2-like domain. A secondary structure prediction of Ubp3 using PSIpred reveals two contiguous regions of high secondary structure, residues 280–912, roughly corresponding to the Ubp3 catalytic domain, and residues 186–272, roughly corresponding to the region of Ubp3 that we identified is involved in Bre5 interaction. Taken together, our studies suggested that residues 186–272 of Ubp3 constitute a folded protein domain that mediates Bre5 interaction. In order to directly test this hypothesis, we prepared two new recombinant Ubp3 constructs in which GST was fused to either residues 181–260 (GST-Ubp3-(181–260)) or residues 181–282 (GST-Ubp3-(181–282)). These GST fusion proteins were overexpressed in E. coli and purified by GST affinity, followed by thrombin cleavage to remove the GST component. In agreement with secondary structure predictions, a CD spectrum of these Ubp3 domains was consistent with the presence of a mainly helical protein domain (Fig. 1c). To determine whether recombinant Ubp3-(181–282) was sufficient for interaction with the NTF2-like domain of Bre5, we carried out a series of additional biochemical experiments. We first prepared a 2:1 stoichiometric complex of Bre5-(1–146) and Ubp3-(181–282) (since we expected an NTF2-like domain dimer to bind one Ubp3 subunit) and subjected the complex to gel filtration analysis. As can be seen from Fig. 1d, the two protein fragments coelute as a homogeneous complex. GST-pull-down studies employing GST-Bre5-(1–146) and untagged Ubp3-(181–260) and Ubp3-(181–282) also showed that the Ubp3 N-terminal domains bound to Bre5 as efficiently as full-length Ubp3 (Fig. 1b). These studies suggest that a region within residues 181–260 of Ubp3 is necessary and sufficient for interaction with the NTF2-like domain of Bre5. We recently reported that Bre5 and Ubp3 forms an active deubiquitination complex that cleaves off ubiquitin from Sec23, a COPII subunit essential for the transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus (22Cohen M.

https://openalex.org/W2073421203,"Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) is regulated solely by alterations in gene expression that involve changes in rates of PEPCK mRNA transcription and degradation. A tetracycline-responsive promoter system was used to quantify the half-life of various chimeric β-globin-PEPCK (βG-PCK) mRNAs in LLC-PK -F+ cells. The control βG mRNA was extremely stable (t½ = 5 days). However, βG-PCK-1 mRNA, which contains the entire 3′-UTR of the PEPCK mRNA, was degraded with a half-life of 1.2 h. RNase H treatment indicated that rapid deadenylation occurred concomitant with degradation of the βG-PCK-1 mRNA. Previous studies indicate that PCK-7, a 50-nucleotide segment at the 3′-end of the 3′-UTR, binds an unidentified protein that may contribute to the rapid decay of the PEPCK mRNA. However, the chimeric βG-PCK-7 mRNA has a half-life of 17 h. Inclusion of the adjacent PCK-6 segment, a 23-bp AU-rich region, produced the βG-PCK-6/7 mRNA, which has a half-life of 3.6 h. The βG-PCK-3 mRNA that contains the 3′-half of 3′-UTR was degraded with the same half-life. Surprisingly, the βG-PCK-2 mRNA, containing the 5′-end of the 3′-UTR, was also degraded rapidly (t½ = 5.4 h). RNA gel shift analyses established that AUF1 (hnRNP D) binds to the PCK-7, PCK-6, and PCK-2 segments with high affinity and specificity. Mutational analysis indicated that AUF1 binds to a UUAUUUUAU sequence within PCK-6 and the stem-loop structure and adjacent CU-region of PCK-7. Thus, AUF1 binds to multiple destabilizing elements within the 3′-UTR that participate in the rapid turnover of the PEPCK mRNA.

RNA gel shift analyses established that AUF1 (hnRNP D) binds to the PCK-7, PCK-6, and PCK-2 segments with high affinity and specificity. Mutational analysis indicated that AUF1 binds to a UUAUUUUAU sequence within PCK-6 and the stem-loop structure and adjacent CU-region of PCK-7. Thus, AUF1 binds to multiple destabilizing elements within the 3′-UTR that participate in the rapid turnover of the PEPCK mRNA. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) 1The abbreviations used are: PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; βG-PCK, β-globin-PEPCK; bGH, bovine growth hormone; DRB, 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzamidazole; AUF1, AU factor 1; Dox, doxycycline; nt, nucleotide; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; UTR, untranslated region. catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate, a rate-limiting step in gluconeogenesis. However, this activity is not regulated by allosteric mechanisms or by covalent modifications (1.Hanson R.W. Patel Y.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1994; 69: 203-281PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, it is regulated by mechanisms that affect the level of the PEPCK mRNA and subsequently determine the level of the PEPCK protein. In liver, transcription of the PEPCK gene is inhibited by insulin and is activated by glucocorticoids, thyroid hormone, and glucagon, which acts through cAMP. Within the renal proximal tubule, parathyroid hormone and angiotensin II increase cAMP levels and cause an increased transcription of the PEPCK gene (2.Liu X. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F347-F355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Watford M. Mapes R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The level of the PEPCK mRNA in rat kidney is also increased rapidly following the onset of metabolic acidosis (4.Hwang J.J. Curthoys N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9392-9396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter adaptation is initiated within 1 h and reaches a 6-fold induction within 7 h. The 6-fold induced level of PEPCK mRNA is sustained in the kidneys of rats that are made chronically acidotic (4.Hwang J.J. Curthoys N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9392-9396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The time required for an mRNA to change from one steady state to another is usually proportional to its half-life (5.Hargrove J.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1163-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, rapid induction of an mRNA is feasible only if the mRNA has a rapid turnover. Previous studies have shown that the PEPCK mRNA is degraded rapidly in liver and in hepatoma cells (6.Hod Y. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7747-7752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in rat kidney cortex (1.Hanson R.W. Patel Y.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1994; 69: 203-281PubMed Google Scholar), and in LLC-PK1-F+ cells (7.Holcomb T. Liu W. Snyder R. Shapiro R. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F340-F346PubMed Google Scholar), a line of porcine proximal tubule-like cells selected for their ability to grow in the absence of glucose (8.Gstraunthaler G. Handler J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: C232-C238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have also demonstrated that the half-life of the PEPCK mRNA is increased in liver in response to cAMP (9.Liu J. Hanson R.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 104: 89-100PubMed Google Scholar) and glucocorticoids (10.Petersen D.D. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Increased stability may also contribute to the sustained induction of renal PEPCK mRNA during chronic acidosis (4.Hwang J.J. Curthoys N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9392-9396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, selective mRNA stabilization may play an important role in the physiological regulation of PEPCK gene expression. However, the mechanisms that cause the rapid turnover and selective stabilization of the PEPCK mRNA are unknown. The presence of a destabilizing cis-element within the 3′-UTR of the PEPCK mRNA was previously demonstrated using DRB, a polymerase II inhibitor, to determine the half-life of a chimeric β-globin-PEPCK mRNA expressed in LLC-PK1-F+-cells (11.Hansen W.R. Barsic-Tress N. Taylor L. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F126-F131PubMed Google Scholar). The parent β-globin (βG) mRNA decayed with a half-life of >30 h, whereas the chimeric βG-PCK-1 mRNA, containing the complete 3′-UTR of PEPCK mRNA, decayed with a half-life of 5 h. RNA gel shift assays using a cytosolic extract of rat renal cortex identified two protein binding interactions, but only one exhibited properties characteristic of specific binding (12.Laterza O.F. Taylor L. Unnithan S. Nguyen L. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 279: F866-F873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high affinity and specific interaction mapped to the PCK-7 segment of the 3′-UTR of the PEPCK mRNA, whereas the low affinity and nonspecific interaction mapped to the PCK-6 segment. However, functional studies using luciferase constructs suggested that both segments contribute to the rapid decay of the PEPCK mRNA (12.Laterza O.F. Taylor L. Unnithan S. Nguyen L. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 279: F866-F873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the contribution of individual segments of the 3′-UTR to the stability of the PEPCK mRNA were quantified by analyses of the half-lives of multiple βG-PCK reporter constructs expressed from a tetracycline (Tet)-regulated promoter. Direct binding assays demonstrated that AUF1 binds to each of the segments that function as instability elements. Mutational analyses identified specific sequences within the PCK-6 and PCK-7 segments that bind AUF1. The results demonstrated that multiple AUF1 binding sites contribute to the rapid turnover of PEPCK mRNA. Materials—Male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories.

Construction of pBSSK-PCK Transcription Vectors and Generation of DNA Templates—The various segments of the 3′-UTR of the PEPCK mRNA that were used in this study are illustrated in Fig. 1. The pBSSK-PCK-1, pBSSK-PCK-2, pBSSK-PCK-6, and pBSSK-PCK-7 plasmids and templates were prepared as described previously (12.Laterza O.F. Taylor L. Unnithan S. Nguyen L. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 279: F866-F873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pBSSK-PCK-6/7 plasmid was constructed by annealing two oligonucleotides and ligating into pBlueScriptII-SK(–), which was previously digested with Asp718 and XbaI. The sequences of the forward and reverse oligonucleotides were 5′-GTACCGTATGTTTAAATTATTTTTATACACTGCCCTTTCTTACCTTTCTTTACATAATTGAAATAGGTATCCTGACCA-3′ and 5′-CTAGTGGTCAGGATACCTATTTCAATTATGTAAAGAAAGGTAAGAAAGGGCAGTGTATAAAAATAATTTAAACATACG-3′, respectively. The underlined bases represent the partial Asp718 and XbaI sites. The pBSSK-PCK-6/7 template was obtained by digesting the plasmid with BssHII and SpeI. The PCK-7 RNA was divided into three subfragments, PCK-8 (bp 2546–2572), PCK-9 (bp 2558–2587), and PCK-10 (bp 2567–2595). Double-stranded oligonucleotides encoding the PCK-8, PCK-9, and PCK-10 RNAs were cloned into pBlueScriptII-SK(–) that was previously digested with Asp718 and XbaI. The pBSSK-PCK-8, pBSSK-PCK-9, and pBSSK-PCK-10 templates were obtained by digesting the plasmids with BssHII, SacI, and XbaI. pBSSK-PCK-Mut-6, pBSSK-PCK-Mut-1, pBSSK-PCK-Mut-2, pBSSK-PCK-Mut-3, and pBSSK-PCK-Mut-4 were also constructed by annealing double-stranded oligonucleotides and ligating them into pBlueScriptII-SK(–). The template for the pBSSK-PCK-Mut-6 construct was obtained by digesting the plamids with BssHII, SacI, and XbaI, whereas the PCK-Mut-1, Mut-2, Mut-3, and Mut-4 templates were obtained by digestion of the plasmids with BssHII and XbaI. UV Cross-linking of RNA-Protein Complexes—The cross-linking experiments were performed with minor modifications of the procedure of You et al. (13.You Y. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2931-2940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were prepared as described for the RNA gel shift experiments, except that, following RNase T1 digestion, they were transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate and exposed to shortwave (254 nm) radiation for 5 min in a UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene). The samples were transferred to 1.5-ml microfuge tubes, and an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 3% (w/v) SDS, 184 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), and 0.2% (w/v) bromphenol blue was added. The samples were heated in boiling water for 5 min and then resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. In Vitro Transcription—In vitro transcription of 32P-labeled and unlabeled RNAs was performed as described previously (12.Laterza O.F. Taylor L. Unnithan S. Nguyen L. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 279: F866-F873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the products were purified using Bio-Rad Micro Bio-Spin P30 columns. The 32P-labeled RNAs were quantified by scintillation counting, and diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water was added to adjust the sample to the desired concentration. The absorbance of the unlabeled RNAs was measured at 260 nm, and the concentration of the transcripts was calculated using extinction coefficients determined from the nucleotide composition. RNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—An aliquot of rat renal cortical extract (12.Laterza O.F. Taylor L. Unnithan S. Nguyen L. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 279: F866-F873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing ∼1–8 μg of protein (14.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or 40–400 ng of recombinant AUF1 was preincubated for 10 min at room temperature in binding buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg of yeast tRNA, 40 units of RNAsin, 10% glycerol, and 10–40 fmol of 32P-labeled RNA. A 30-, 200-, 300-, or 500-fold excess of competitor RNA was added with the labeled RNA. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and then 1 μl of RNase T1 was added and the samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The samples were separated on 5% native polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were dried and exposed overnight to a PhosphorImager screen. In the supershift experiments, the various antibodies were preincubated with the rat renal cytosolic extract for 20 min at room temperature and then added to the binding buffer. Construction of TetβG-PCK Vectors—A tetracycline-regulated promoter system (15.Xu N. Loflin P. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) was utilized to map the segments within the 3′-UTR of the PEPCK mRNA that function as instability elements. A chimeric β-globin/growth hormone gene was cloned into the pTRE2 plasmid to yield pTetβG. This construct contains a Tet-responsive promoter, the coding region of rabbit β-globin (βG) gene, and the 3′-nontranslated region and polyadenylation site of bovine growth hormone (bGH) cDNA. The 3′-UTR of the rat PEPCK cDNA (corresponding to nucleotides 2008–2595) was PCR-amplified using forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers that introduced SpeI and XbaI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The sequence of the forward primer was 5′-GCACTAGTGGGCGAATTGGGTACTAG-3′, whereas that of the reverse primer was 5′-CGTGGTCTAGATACCTATTTCAATTATGTAAAGAAAGG-3′, where the underlined sequences are the SpeI and XbaI sites, respectively. The amplified sequence was then cloned into the SrfI site of pPCRScript-SK(+). The resulting plasmid pPCR-PCK-1 was then digested with SpeI and XbaI to yield a 604-bp fragment that was subsequently cloned into pTetβG at the SpeI site to yield pTβG-PCK-1. pTβG-PCK-1 was digested with BssHII and EcoRV restriction enzymes to release a 224-bp 3′-fragment. The remaining plasmid was blunted and re-ligated to produce pTβG-PCK-2. The 224-bp fragment was blunted and inserted into pTetβG that was previously linearized with EcoRV to produce pTβG-PCK-3. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the PCK-6, PCK-7, and PCK-6/7 sequences (12.Laterza O.F. Taylor L. Unnithan S. Nguyen L. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 279: F866-F873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were synthesized with SpeI and XbaI overhangs and inserted in pTet-βG that was previously digested with SpeI to yield pTβG-PCK-6, pTβG-PCK-7, and pTβG-PCK-6/7, respectively (Fig. 1). Thus, all of the chimeric βG-PCK mRNAs retained the bGH 3′-UTR that is contained in the control βG-PCK mRNA. Creation of TβG-PCK Stable Cell Lines—LLC-PK1-F+ cells were obtained from Dr. Gerhard Gstraunthaler and cultured as previously described (8.Gstraunthaler G. Handler J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: C232-C238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lines that stably express the TβG-PCK-1, TβG-PCK-2, TβG-PCK-3, TβG-PCK-6, TβG-PCK-7, and TβG-PCK-6/7 constructs were made by calcium phosphate cotransfection (16.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar) of the pTβG-PCK plasmid and pcDNA 3.1/Hygro (Invitrogen) into 8C cells, a line of LLC-PK1-F+ cells that overexpress the tTA protein. 2J. M. Schroeder and N. P. Curthoys, unpublished data. At 24 h post-transfection, the medium was removed, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and then fresh medium containing 0.2 mg/ml G418 was added. At 48 h post-transfection and every 2 days thereafter, fresh medium containing 0.2 mg/ml G418 and 0.6 mg/ml hygromycin B was added. After 14–21 days, individual colonies were isolated and expanded. After the cells were split onto 10-cm plates, the hygromycin B concentration was reduced to 0.2 mg/ml. The cell lines were tested for Dox responsiveness by maintaining the cells for 48 h in medium in the presence or absence of 0.5 μg/ml Dox. Total RNA was harvested from the cells and analyzed on a Northern blot. Half-life Analysis—For pulse-chase analysis, cells expressing the βG-PCK-1 mRNA were initially grown in medium minus Dox and then transferred to medium containing 50 ng/ml Dox for 48 h. This level of Dox was determined to be sufficient to completely shut off transcription from the Tet promoter. The cells were then washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and grown for 3 h in fresh medium minus Dox to create a pulse of βG-PCK-1 mRNA. Subsequently, 1 μg/ml Dox was added to inhibit transcription. RNA samples were isolated at various times following re-addition of Dox and subjected to Northern analysis to follow the decay of the newly synthesized βG-PCK-1 mRNA. Alternatively, the various TβG-PCK-expressing LLC-PK1-F+ cells were grown for 5–7 days in medium minus Dox. At time zero, 1 μg/ml Dox was added to each plate. At 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h post-Dox treatment, RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern analysis. RNase H Treatment—RNase H treatment (17.Porter D. Curthoys N.P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) was performed to selectively cleave the 3′-ends of the chimeric βG-PCK-1 mRNAs that were isolated from the pulse-chase experiments. The 21-nt PCK oligo 5′-GCCCAAGATTTTTTTCTCCCC-3′ that encodes the template strand of the PEPCK cDNA from bp 2199–2219 was synthesized by Macromolecular Resources (Fort Collins, CO). A 30-mer of oligo(dT) was used to remove the poly(A) tail of the mRNA. The RNA samples were precipitated from Formazol by adjusting the final concentration of NaCl to 0.2 m and adding 4 volumes of ethanol. After 5 min at room temperature, the RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended in 25 μl of DEPC-treated water. The cleavage reaction was performed in a final volume of 12.5 μl containing 10 μg of RNA, 1.0 μl of RNase H, and 50 pmol of the PCK oligo with or without addition of 50 pmol of oligo(dT). The mixture was incubated at 55 °C for 60 s, and then 1.5 μl of 10× RNase H buffer (0.5 m Hepes, pH 7.4, 1.0 m NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm dithiothreitol), prewarmed to 62 °C, was added, and the reaction was incubated at 62 °C for 15 min. An additional unit of RNase H (freshly diluted to 1 unit/μl with 1× RNase H buffer) was added, and the sample was incubated at 62 °C for 15 min. Thereafter, 29 μl of denaturing buffer (20 μl of Formazol, 3 μl of 10× MOPS, and 6 μl of 37% formaldehyde solution) was added to stop the reaction. The sample was incubated at 55 °C for 5 min and then stored on ice. The RNase H-treated RNAs were subjected to Northern blot analysis as described previously (11.Hansen W.R. Barsic-Tress N. Taylor L. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F126-F131PubMed Google Scholar), except that 10 μl of a RNase H gel loading buffer (50% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol, and 25 μl/ml of 10 mg/ml ethidium bromide) was added to the samples, and a 1.2% agarose gel containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm sodium acetate was used. The blot was hybridized with the bGH probe. Northern Analyses—Total cellular RNA was isolated using the TRIzol® reagent, and the RNA concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. A 507-bp fragment of rabbit β-globin cDNA was excised by restricting pRSV-βG (18.Gorman C. Padmanabhan R. Howard B.H. Science. 1983; 221: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) with HindIII and BglII. A 2.0-kb fragment of the 18 S ribosomal RNA cDNA from Acanthamoeba castellanii was excised by restricting pAr2 (19.D'Alessio J.M. Harris G.H. Perna P.J. Paule M.R. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3822-3827Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with HindIII and EcoRI. A 228-bp bGH fragment was excised from pPCRScript-bGH with SphI. The fragments were separated on a 1% agarose gel, excised, and purified using the GENECLEAN kit. The synthesis of oligo-labeled cDNA probes and Northern analysis were performed as described previously (11.Hansen W.R. Barsic-Tress N. Taylor L. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F126-F131PubMed Google Scholar). The blots were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and the intensity of the resulting digital image of each band was quantified using Molecular Dynamics software. The level of the chimeric β-globin mRNA was divided by the corresponding level of 18 S rRNA to correct for errors in sample loading. For half-life studies, the log of normalized data were then plotted versus the time after the addition of doxycycline. The reported values are the mean ± S.E. of data obtained from triplicate samples. The line representing the best fit of the data points was determined by a KaleidaGraph program that weights each data point based upon its standard deviation. Half-life Analysis of βG-PCK-1 mRNA—A tetracycline-regulated promoter (Tet-off system) was used to determine the half-life of the βG-PCK-1 mRNA. Stably transformed cells were maintained in the presence of 50 ng/ml doxycycline (Dox) to suppress synthesis of the βG-PCK-1 mRNA. A transcriptional pulse was created by removing Dox from the medium for 3 h and was subsequently chased by adding 1 μg/ml Dox to selectively inhibit transcription of the TβG-PCK-1 mRNA. RNA samples were isolated from the cells at various intervals following initiation of the chase, and the levels of βG-PCK-1 mRNA and 18 S rRNA were quantified by Northern analysis (Fig. 2A). This analysis demonstrated that degradation of βG-PCK-1 mRNA is initiated after a brief lag (30 min) and then proceeds with a very rapid half-life (t½ = 1.2 h). Deadenylation of βG-PCK-1 mRNA—Rapid degradation of mammalian mRNAs is usually initiated by the binding of specific protein(s) to unique element(s) within the 3′-UTR (20.Parker R. Song H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 21.Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). The RNA-binding protein(s) subsequently recruit a poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (22.Gao M. Fritz D.T. Ford L.P. Wilusz J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and the exosome (23.van Hoof A. Parker R. Cell. 1999; 99: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) to remove the poly(A) tail and accomplish a rapid 3′ → 5′ exonucleolytic degradation, respectively. RNase H treatment of the RNAs isolated from the βG-PCK-1 mRNA half-life analysis was performed to determine whether deadenylation precedes the decay of the PEPCK mRNA. Incubation of the RNA isolated immediately after the 3-h pulse (0-h sample) with a complementary oligonucleotide and oligo(dT), followed by treatment with RNase H, produced a 315-nt fragment (Fig. 2B). This fragment corresponded to the expected length of the fully deadenylated 3′-end of the βG-PCK-1 mRNA. Digestion of the same RNA sample in the presence of only the complementary oligonucleotide produced larger fragments containing ∼500 nt. Thus, the newly synthesized βG-PCK-1 mRNA contained a significant poly(A) tail. Identical treatment of RNAs isolated from the later time points demonstrated that the βG-PCK-1 mRNA undergoes a rapid deadenylation that occurs concomitant with the decay of the mRNA. Mapping of the Instability Elements within the 3′-UTR of PEPCK—Further half-life analyses were performed using cells grown in the absence of Dox to maximally induce expression of the chimeric PEPCK mRNAs. Selective decay of the reporter mRNA was subsequently initiated by the addition of 1 μg/ml Dox. Northern blot analysis was performed using RNAs isolated from 8C cells that stably express the parent TetβG construct. This analysis determined that the control βG mRNA is extremely stable and decays with a half-life of ∼5 days (Fig. 3). Northern analysis also indicated that the βG-PCK-1 mRNA was degraded with a half-life of 1.8 h, consistent with the previous pulse-chase analysis. Previous RNA gel shift analysis indicates that a protein in cytosolic extracts of rat kidney cortex binds specifically to PCK-7, a 50-nt segment of the 3′-UTR of the PEPCK mRNA (12.Laterza O.F. Taylor L. Unnithan S. Nguyen L. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 279: F866-F873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the PCK-7 segment was sufficient to cause the rapid destabilization of the PEPCK mRNA, the turnover of the βG-PCK-7 mRNA was determined. Northern blot analyses revealed that the βG-PCK-7 mRNA was degraded with a half-life of 17 h (Fig. 3). Therefore, insertion of just the PCK-7 segment only partially destabilized the chimeric mRNA and was not sufficient to produce the rapid turnover observed with βG-PCK-1 mRNA. Thus, additional sequences within the 3′-UTR may be needed to constitute the complete instability element of the PEPCK mRNA. Sequence analysis of the 3′-UTRs of human, rat, and mouse PEPCK mRNAs revealed the presence of a conserved 16-nt AU sequence that is located immediately upstream of the PCK-7 segment. This sequence is part of a 23-nt segment termed PCK-6 that binds a protein in a rat renal cytosolic extract with low affinity (12.Laterza O.F. Taylor L. Unnithan S. Nguyen L. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 279: F866-F873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the PCK-6 segment was inserted into the parent TetβG vector to generate pTβG-PCK-6. LLC-PK1-F+ cells were stably transfected with this construct, and half-life analyses were performed. The βG-PCK-6 mRNA decayed with a half-life of only 6 h (Fig. 3). To determine whether the PCK-6 and PCK-7 segments act synergistically, cells that stably express pTβG-PCK-6/7 were subjected to half-life analysis. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the βG-PCK-6/7 mRNA decayed with a half-life of 3.6 h (Fig. 4). This half-life was significantly lower than that observed with either βG-PCK-7 or the βG-PCK-6 mRNA but was still greater than that observed with the full-length PCK-1 segment. Therefore, additional sequences within the 3′-UTR may be needed to constitute the complete instability element of the PEPCK mRNA. To test this hypothesis, cells expressing constructs containing longer segments of the 3′-UTR of the PEPCK mRNA were generated. The PCK-3 segment contains 224 nt from the 3′-end of the PEPCK mRNA that includes the PCK-6/7 segment (Fig. 1). Half-life analysis performed using RNAs isolated from cells expressing the βG-PCK-3 mRNA established that this mRNA decayed with a half-life of 3.6 h, the same as observed with the βG-PCK-6/7 mRNA (Fig. 4). Thus, the PCK-6/7 segment contains all of the instability elements within the PCK-3 segment. The half-life of the βG-PCK-2 mRNA that contains the 5′-end of the 3′-UTR of the PEPCK mRNA was also determined. Previous RNA gel shift assays with 32P-labeled PCK-2 RNA and rat renal cytosolic extracts failed to demonstrate the formation of a RNA-protein complex (12.Laterza O.F. Taylor L. Unnithan S. Nguyen L. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 279: F866-F873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the βG-PCK-2 mRNA, when expressed in the porcine kidney cells, decayed with a half-life of 5.4 h (Fig. 4). Thus, the half-life analyses of the PCK-1, PCK-6, PCK-7, and PCK-2 constructs establish that the 3′-UTR of the PEPCK mRNA contains multiple instability elements that contribute to the rapid turnover that is observed with the full-length chimeric mRNA. AUF1 Binds within the 3′-UTR of the PEPCK mRNA—UV cross-linking analysis was performed to identify the proteins within rat renal cytosolic extracts that bind within the PCK-6/7 segment. Proteins with apparent molecular mass values that range from 40 to 100 kDa were found to be associated with the PCK-6/7 RNA (Fig. 5A). Identical patterns of labeled proteins were observed when PCK-1 and PCK-7 were incubat"
https://openalex.org/W2015606406,"The parasitic protozoan Leishmania specifically manipulates the expression of host macrophage genes during initial interactions, as revealed by mRNA differential display reverse transcription-PCR and cDNA microarray analyses. The genes that are down-regulated in mouse (J774G8) or human (U937) macrophages upon exposure to Leishmania include small RNA transcripts from the short interspersed element sequences. Among the short interspersed element RNAs that are down-regulated is 7SL RNA, which is the RNA component of the signal recognition particle. Because the microbicidal functions of macrophages profoundly count on vesicular protein transport processes, down-regulation of 7SL RNA may be significant in the establishment of infection by Leishmania in macrophage phagolysosomes. To evaluate whether down-regulation of 7SL RNA results in inhibition of signal recognition particle-mediated vesicular protein transport processes, we have tested and found that the targeting of proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane and the secretion of proteins by macrophages are compromised in Leishmania-infected J774G8 and U937 cells. Knocking down 7SL RNA using small interfering RNA mimicked the effect of exposure of macrophages to Leishmania. The overexpression of 7SL RNA in J774G8 or U937 cells made these cells resistant to Leishmania infection, suggesting the possible biological significance of down-regulation of 7SL RNA synthesis in the establishment of infection by Leishmania. We conclude that Leishmania down-regulates 7SL RNA in macrophages to manipulate the targeting of many proteins that use the vesicular transport pathway and thus favors its successful establishment of infection in macrophages.

Pathogenic microbes often develop strategies to evade host immune responses, learn to adapt to the host environment, and/or manipulate the host system to make it more hospitable for the establishment of infection and propagation (1Kane M.M. Mosser D.M. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2000; 7: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 2Handman E. Bullen D.V.

Any microbe interacting with the mammalian immune system is subjected to ultimate phagocytosis by blood mononuclear phagocytes or tissue macrophages, and it is then cytolyzed to death inside macrophage phagolysosomes (2Handman E. Bullen D.V. Trends Parasitol. 2002; 18: 332-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 3Denkers E.Y.

The parasitic protozoan Leishmania has the uncanny ability to evade the immune reactions of macrophages and is able to establish infection inside macrophage phagolysosomes and to propagate inside tissue macrophages (1Kane M.M. Mosser D.M. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2000; 7: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 2Handman E. Bullen D.V.

Butcher B.A. Trends Parasitol. 2005; 21: 35-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To survive inside the macrophage and to escape immunity, Leishmania has developed mechanisms that deactivate macrophage immune functions, including inhibition of the respiratory burst and interleukin-12 and nitric oxide synthesis and down-regulation of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules as well as promotion of the synthesis of inhibitory cytokines such as transforming growth factor-β and interleukin-10 and induction of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (5Bogdan C. Gessner A. Solbach W. Röllinghoff M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 6Bertholet S. Dickensheets H.L. Sheikh F. Gam A.A. Donnelly R.P. Kenney R.T. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 2095-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cytokines and especially γ-interferon are essential contributors to macrophage activation to promote the effective killing of parasites (5Bogdan C. Gessner A. Solbach W. Röllinghoff M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 6Bertholet S. Dickensheets H.L. Sheikh F. Gam A.A. Donnelly R.P. Kenney R.T. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 2095-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Many of the functions carried out by macrophages, including destruction of intracellular parasites such as Leishmania, are enhanced by their activation by extracellular factors. Proper targeting of the receptor molecules specific for those activating factors on the cell surface is thus very important for the optimal function of macrophages. We hypothesize that, in the early stages of infection, Leishmania manipulates the expression of cell-surface receptors of the macrophages, making the cells unable to respond to their external stimuli.It has become increasingly apparent that, in addition to their phagocytic and immunomodulatory properties, macrophages have an extensive secretory capability that includes secretion of protein molecules such as lysozymes, lysosomal acid hydrolases, neutral proteases, lipases, arginase, protease inhibitors, phospholipase inhibitors, complement factors, blood coagulation factors, and several cytokines (7Hamilton T.A. Ohmori Y. Tebo J.M. Kishore R. Pathobiology. 1999; 67: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 8Hamilton T.A. Ohmori Y. Tebo J. Immunol. Res. 2002; 25: 229-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Macrophage secretion involves synthesis on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SRP, signal recognition particle; DD-RT, differential display reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; MBSA, maleylated bovine serum albumin; BSA, bovine serum albumin. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SRP, signal recognition particle; DD-RT, differential display reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; MBSA, maleylated bovine serum albumin; BSA, bovine serum albumin. cotranslational glycosylation and translocation into the lumen of the ER, transport to the Golgi, and vesicular transport to the plasma membrane. The fusion of the secretory vesicle membrane and plasma membrane then occurs with the re-establishment of the membrane bilayer structure, thereby maintaining the integrity of the cell while expelling vesicle contents to the external milieu (9Sollner T.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The secretion of many cytokines by macrophages is of particular importance because those cytokines interact with macrophages and T- or B-cells and assist in the control and fine-tuning of the immune response. Our proposal is that Leishmania successfully establishes infection in macrophages by down-regulating the biosynthesis of 7SL RNA, which in turn results in inhibition of protein targeting into the ER lumen and plasma membrane and secretion of protein molecules by macrophages.The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a ribonucleoprotein machine that delivers certain nascent polypeptides to specific recognition components on the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane for translocation of secretory or membrane proteins (10Koch H.G. Moser M. Muller M. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 146: 55-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Doudna J.A. Batey R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The RNA component of the SRP (7SL RNA) contains two elements related to the human and rodent Alu families of interspersed repetitive DNA sequences connected by a unique sequence, the S domain (11Doudna J.A. Batey R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). 7SL RNA associates with six proteins in mammalian cells termed SRP72, SRP68, SRP54, SRP19, SRP14, and SRP9 (11Doudna J.A. Batey R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).All proteins destined for the secretory pathway must first be targeted to the ER. In mammalian cells, this targeting reaction primarily occurs cotranslationally via the SRP pathway. Proteins targeted to the cell membrane for either secretion or integration typically have an N-terminal signal peptide that directs them to their destinations. As the nascent polypeptide chain exits the ribosome, it is recognized and bound by the SRP. The SRP-ribosome complex then binds to the SRP receptor, which resides in the target membrane. Once bound, the paused translation machinery docks with a protein-translocating pore, or channel, and the SRP releases the signal peptide (10Koch H.G. Moser M. Muller M. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 146: 55-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Doudna J.A. Batey R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Translation resumes with the growing peptide integrating into or passing through the membrane. The SRP pathway is essential in all organisms examined to date except the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12Hann B.C. Walter P. Cell. 1991; 67: 131-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar).To substantiate our hypothesis that Leishmania actively manipulates macrophages in the initial phases of its establishment of infection, we studied the differential expression of genes in cultured macrophages exposed to virulent Leishmania promastigotes (the insect form of the parasite) compared with unexposed macrophages. Exposure of cultured mouse macrophages to virulent Leishmania promastigotes for 2-6 h caused significant decreases in the levels of small RNA transcripts from short interspersed element sequences in the cells (13Ueda Y. Chaudhuri G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19428-19432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We report here the data from our differential display reverse transcription (DD-RT) PCR and cDNA microarray analyses showing the differential expression of specific abundant mRNAs in Leishmania-exposed macrophages. We hypothesize that the altered expression of these genes may lead to the non-apoptotic growth arrest of host cells favoring the parasitism of Leishmania. We further characterize the down-regulation of one of the short interspersed element RNAs, 7SL RNA, in Leishmania-exposed macrophages and present evidence that this down-regulation leads to inhibition of vesicular protein transport in macrophages, perhaps favoring leishmanial parasitism in the phagolysosomes of these cells. We also show that the overexpression of 7SL RNA in macrophages confers resistance to the cells against Leishmania infection, at least in vitro.MATERIALS AND METHODSLeishmania, Trypanosoma, and Macrophages—The promastigotes and amastigotes of Leishmania amazonensis (LV78), Leishmania major (Friedlin), and Leishmania donovani (DD8) were used in this study. The promastigotes were grown at 25 °C in M199 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (13Ueda Y. Chaudhuri G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19428-19432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Amastigotes were maintained in mouse tail base lesions or in infected J774G8 cultures (14Mishra M. Porter-Kelley J. Singh P.K. Bennett J.R. Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Virulent promastigotes are those that are differentiated from amastigotes, freshly isolated from infected macrophages (14Mishra M. Porter-Kelley J. Singh P.K. Bennett J.R. Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Avirulent promastigotes are cloned laboratory stock of Leishmania that has been maintained in axenic culture medium for >10 years and that has lost its infectivity in cultured macrophages or in mice (15Seay M.B. Heard P.L. Chaudhuri G. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 5129-5137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trypanosoma brucei procyclics (16Walker Jr., R. Saha L. Hill G.C. Chaudhuri M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 139: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. Minu Chaudhuri (Department of Microbiology, Meharry Medical College). We used the mouse macrophage cell line J774G8 and the human monocytic leukemia cell line U937 in our study. These cells were grown in tissue culture flasks in RPMI 1640 medium with 20% heat-inactivated (56 °C, 30 min) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C as described (13Ueda Y. Chaudhuri G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19428-19432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 14Mishra M. Porter-Kelley J. Singh P.K. Bennett J.R. Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). U937 cells were differentiated into macrophages with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 ng/ml) for 24 h as described (17Guizani-Tabbane L. Ben-Aissa K. Belghith M. Sassi A. Dellagi K. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 2582-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The macrophages were incubated with the parasite cells at a macrophage/parasite ratio of 1:10 at 37 °C for 2-6 h for exposure experiments (13Ueda Y. Chaudhuri G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19428-19432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 14Mishra M. Porter-Kelley J. Singh P.K. Bennett J.R. Chaudhuri G. Biochem.

Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 465-474Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar).DD-RT-PCR and Microarray Analyses—Comparative gene expression analyses of unexposed and virulent L. amazonensis-exposed J774G8 cells were done by DD-RT-PCR as well as mouse cDNA microarray analyses similar to those described previously (13Ueda Y. Chaudhuri G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19428-19432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 19Tripathi M.K. Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Total RNA was isolated from subconfluent cultured cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). For isolation of RNA from unexposed macrophages, we added an equivalent number of parasite cells after addition of TRIzol to the macrophages so that the contribution of Leishmania RNA, if any, in the subsequent microarray hybridization was countered. The RNA quality was checked by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis. DD-RT-PCR analysis was performed as described previously (13Ueda Y. Chaudhuri G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19428-19432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). For cDNA microarray analysis, total RNAs (40 μg) from unexposed and exposed cells were labeled in reverse transcription reactions (SuperScript II kit, Invitrogen) with Cy3-labeled dCTP and Cy5-labeled dCTP (Amersham Biosciences), respectively (19Tripathi M.K. Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20Tripathi M.K. Misra S. Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 329: 508-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Four microarrays were used for this study. In every second replicate experiment, the fluorescent deoxyribonucleotides were swapped. Purified cDNA probes labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 were mixed per pair and hybridized to mouse cDNA microarray chips (Mouse Research Genetics 5K) in the Vanderbilt Microarray Shared Resource Core Facility. The slides were scanned with a GenePix 4000A microarray scanner (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA), and the images were analyzed using GenePix Pro 3 software. A uniform scale factor was applied to normalized signal intensities between Cy5 and Cy3. Flagged spots and spots with an average intensity below 2.5-fold above the background were not retained for further analysis. The log2(Cy5/Cy3) ratio of the other spots was calculated for each slide. To compare the results from the different samples, data from each slide were normalized in log space to have a mean of 0 and an S.D. of 1 by using the Cluster program (21Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13138) Google Scholar). Genes with significant changes in mRNA levels were identified using the SAM (significant analysis of microarrays) procedure (22Tusher G.V. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9705) Google Scholar), a validated statistical technique for identifying differentially expressed genes across high density microarrays. This procedure provides a list of “significant” genes and an estimate of the false discovery rate, which represents the percentage of genes that could be identified by chance (22Tusher G.V. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9705) Google Scholar).Primer Extension and Nuclear Run-on Analyses—The levels of 7SL RNA in the control and parasite-exposed macrophages were determined by primer extension analysis using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. β-Actin mRNA levels were evaluated as a normalization control. The primers used were as follows: 7SL RNA, 5′-ATGCCGAACTTAGTGCGG-3′; and β-actin, 5′-TACACTGTAGCTGTCTTCAGACA-3′. The primers were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (23Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). Nuclear run-on analysis was performed as described (23Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar).RT-PCR Evaluation of 7SL RNA Levels—Total RNA was isolated from cells and analyzed for 7SL RNA or β-actin by RT-PCR analysis (Amersham Biosciences). β-Actin was used as a loading control. Total RNAs (5 μg) were treated with DNase I (Promega Corp.) and reverse-transcribed with SuperScript II and random hexanucleotides as primers. The resulting first-strand cDNAs were used as templates to amplify 7SL RNA (157 bp; 5′-GGAGTTCTGGGCTGTAGTGC-3′ and 5′-ATCAGCACGGGAGTTTTGAC-3′) and β-actin (353 bp; 5′-GCTCGTCGTCGACAACGGCTC-3′ and 5′-CAAACATGATCTGGGTCATCTTCTC-3′).Knockdown of 7SL RNA Gene Expression—The small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for human 7SL RNA were designed based on the nucleotide sequence (GenBank™ accession number X04248) using the software available at the Invitrogen web site (rnaidesigner.invitrogen.com/sirna) and custom-synthesized by Invitrogen. The nucleotide sequences of the siRNA pair (SR) and its respective control (SRC) are as follows (the number indicates the location of the sequence in 7SL RNA; see Ref. 24Ullu E. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 3303-3310Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar): SR110, 5′-UCCGCACUAAGUUCGGCAU-3′/5′-AUGCCGAACUUAGUGCGGA-3′; and SRC110, 5′-UCCACUAAGUUCGGGCCAU-3′/5′-AUGGCCCGAACUUAGUGGA-3′. We used Trans-Messenger reagent and protocols (Qiagen Inc.) for the transfection of macrophages with the siRNAs. RNAs were purified from the siRNA-treated cells using TRIzol reagent and treated with DNase I before RT-PCR analysis (19Tripathi M.K. Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20Tripathi M.K. Misra S. Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 329: 508-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Overexpression of 7SL RNA in Cultured Macrophages—Human 7SL cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number X04248) (24Ullu E. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 3303-3310Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was amplified from cDNA (made from RNA isolated from U937 cells) using a BglII site-anchored forward primer (5′-GGAGATCTGCCGGGCGCGGTGGCGCGTGC-3′) and a HindIII site-anchored reverse primer (5′-GGAAGCTTAGAGACGGGGTCTCGCTATG-3′). The sequence-verified, amplified cDNA (315 bp) was digested with BglII/HindIII and cloned behind the H1 RNA promoter in plasmid pSUPER (19Tripathi M.K. Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) at the BglII/HindIII sites to obtain plasmid pSUPER-7SL. We mutated the 7SL RNA gene in pSUPER-7SL simultaneously (G193A, G194A, and G198A) to create a nonfunctional 7SL RNA. These Gly residues are highly conserved across the genera and are essential for the function of 7SL RNA (25Liao X. Selinger D. Althoff S. Chiang A. Hamilton D. Ma M. Wise J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1607-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 26Kuglstatter A. Oubridge C. Nagai K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We used the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis reagents and protocols (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (27Tripathi M.K. Misra S. Khedkar S.V. Hamilton N. Irvin-Wilson C. Sharan C. Sealy L. Chaudhuri G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17163-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) to accomplish the mutagenesis. Mutation was verified by nucleotide sequencing. We named the mutated plasmid pSUPER-7SL*. pSUPER-7SL or pSUPER-7SL* and pcDNA3.0 were cotransfected at a ratio of 10:1 into cultured macrophages using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described (27Tripathi M.K. Misra S. Khedkar S.V. Hamilton N. Irvin-Wilson C. Sharan C. Sealy L. Chaudhuri G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17163-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Control cells were transfected only with pcDNA3.0, which contains the G418 resistance gene. Recombinant cells were selected with G418 (200 μg/ml). To overexpress 7SL RNA in cells that express either enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) or secreted alkaline phosphatase and that are resistant to G418, we cotransfected them with pSUPER-7SL or pSUPER-7SL* and pTK-Hyg (a selection vector that confers hygromycin resistance; Clontech) and selected for cells that were resistant to both G418 (200 μg/ml) and hygromycin (200 μg/ml). Control cells were transfected only with pTK-Hyg. The overexpression of 7SL RNA in the transfected cells was evaluated by RT-PCR as described above.Evaluation of Protein Targeting to the ER—To evaluate the effect of Leishmania- or siRNA-induced knockdown of 7SL RNA in macrophages on the targeting of proteins to the ER, we employed a commercially available plasmid construct (Clontech) designed to test this cellular process. The Living Color ER targeting vector pECFP-ER (Clontech) encodes a fusion protein consisting of ECFP, the ER targeting sequence of calreticulin cloned at the 5′-end, and the sequence encoding the ER retrieval sequence (KDEL) cloned at the 3′-end. ECFP-ER is a soluble protein that localizes in the lumen of the ER in transfected cells. We stably transfected macrophages with the pECFP-ER plasmid. Cultured J774G8 or undifferentiated U937 cells (in 6-well tissue culture plates) were transfected with the pECFP-ER plasmid (1 μg) using Lipofectamine 2000 (27Tripathi M.K. Misra S. Khedkar S.V. Hamilton N. Irvin-Wilson C. Sharan C. Sealy L. Chaudhuri G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17163-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were obtained after selection with G418 (200 μg/ml). U937 cells were differentiated before exposure to virulent Leishmania promastigotes as described above. Virulent Leishmania-exposed or unexposed cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were mounted on slides with ProLong mounting medium (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and visualized using an Olympus BX60 epifluorescence microscope with a ×100 objective lens. Images were recorded with an Optronics CCD camera (DEI-750). To evaluate whether the disappearance of the ECFP-ER protein in the Leishmania-exposed cells is due to proteasome-mediated degradation, we used the potent, membrane-permeable proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Sigma) (28Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). MG132 was reconstituted in Me2SO to obtain a 10 μm stock solution. Macrophages were treated with 1 μm MG132 for 24 h.Evaluation of Protein Targeting to the Plasma Membrane—To evaluate the effect of Leishmania- or siRNA-induced knockdown of 7SL RNA in macrophages on the concentration of a membrane receptor, we assayed the level of macrophage scavenger receptor AII molecules on the surface of these cells. Scavenger receptor AII is highly abundant on the surface of macrophages (29Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We used maleylated bovine serum albumin (MBSA), an artificial ligand for this receptor (29Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), to probe this molecule. BSA was maleylated (∼55 maleyl groups/molecule) using maleic anhydride (29Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). MBSA was radiolabeled with 125I using the ICl-catalyzed reaction (29Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Binding of 125I-MBSA to macrophages was measured as follows. After an overnight culture, the medium was removed from the 24-well dishes, and cells were washed twice with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 0-50 μg of protein/ml of 125I-MBSA in 125 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing 4% fatty acid-free BSA and 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), in a total volume of 250 μl (total binding). Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of 1 mg of unlabeled MBSA/ml of incubation mixture. At the end of the incubation, the cell monolayer was washed twice with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% BSA and then twice with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were solubilized in 1.5 ml of 1 m NaOH and assayed for protein content, and the radioactivity was counted (29Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The specific binding was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific binding of 125I-MBSA from the total binding. The curves generated by the specific binding data were transformed into plots of the ratio of cell-bound to free 125I-MBSA versus cell-bound 125I-MBSA according to the method of Scatchard (see Ref. 30Sarret P.

The ordinate of the Scatchard plots (bound/free) represents the amount of specifically bound ligand (fmol of MBSA/mg of cellular protein) divided by the concentration of unbound ligand in the reaction mixture (fmol of MBSA/ml). The dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated from the slopes, and the maximal binding capacity (Bmax) was obtained from the x axis intercept (30Sarret P. Esdaile M.J. McPherson P.S. Schonbrunn A.

https://openalex.org/W2020302255,"The novel dicistronic transcript encoded by the Drosophila melanogaster stoned gene was recognized as being unusual in that the protein encoded by the first open reading frame, stoned-A (STNA), contains no internal methionine residues in a protein of 93 kDa. The dicistronic nature of the stoned locus and the lack of methionine residues in STNA is conserved across dipteran species. A second methionine-free cistron, encoding Snapin, was identified in Drosophila and also found to be dicistronic, the second open reading frame (ORF) encoding a methyltransferase. We have replaced the methyltransferase cistron with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and used this dicistronic construct to show that the GFP cistron is translated in Drosophila S2 cells. The insertion of in-frame AUG codons into the snapin ORF attenuates the translation of GFP, and the level of attenuation correlates with the number of inserted AUGs. Increasing the efficiency of translation-initiation of the Snapin cistron also attenuates the translation of GFP. This indicates that failure to initiate translation at the first AUG allows ribosomes to scan through the Snapin ORF and to initiate translation of the second cistron, unless new AUG codons are inserted. These data are used to interpret the expression of the stoned locus and in particular, to explain the altered stoned protein levels in the stoned-temperature-sensitive mutant allele, which replaces a lysine with a methionine codon early in the first, stonedA, cistron.

These data are used to interpret the expression of the stoned locus and in particular, to explain the altered stoned protein levels in the stoned-temperature-sensitive mutant allele, which replaces a lysine with a methionine codon early in the first, stonedA, cistron. Although not unknown in eukaryotes, true dicistronic mRNAs (as opposed to alternatively spliced mRNAs) are rare. Where they do occur, they seem to fall into two categories. The first is best exemplified by the situation in certain eukaryotic viruses where a single mRNA can produce several proteins (1Wang F. Petti L. Braun D. Seung S. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 945-954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1988; 344: 320-325Crossref Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). In this case there exists internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) 1The abbreviations used are: IRES, internal ribosome entry site; ORF, open reading frame; uORF upstream open reading frame; GFP, green fluorescent protein; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; ICR, intercistronic region. in the mRNA, where the necessity of the m7G 5′ cap to initiate ribosome binding is obviated (3Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Hence two or more translational products can be synthesized from a single mRNA. Cellular genes that do not contain the 5′ terminal cap but allow internal ribosome binding in the 5′ leader sequence have been identified (4Peabody D. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2695-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and a non-viral dicistronic mRNA, with proposed IRES between the cistrons, has been recognized as an alternative transcript from the Adh locus in Drosophila (5Brogna S. Ashburner M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2023-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Whereas the 1st open reading frame (ORF) encodes the ADH protein, the function of the protein produced from the 2nd ORF (Adhr) is unknown (5Brogna S. Ashburner M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2023-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and so the evolutionary rationale for arranging two genes in this way is not clear. A screen of the Drosophila genome data bases for possible dicistronic mRNAs yielded a number of single transcripts encoding two ORFs. Many were like the Adh locus with at least the possibility that IRES sequences might be present. Among these loci, some gave rise to alternative spliced mRNA variants with one monocistronic and another dicistronic, still other dicistronic loci produced a single transcript. A possible mechanism for translating IRES-deficient dicistronic transcripts involves the scanning of the ribosome from the termination signal at the end of the first ORF, and the reinitiation of translation at the beginning of the second ORF. The best studied of this type of mRNA is represented by the GCN4 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (6Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6442-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In this case four small (3–4 codons) ORFs (uORFs), upstream of the structural gene, translationally regulate the expression of the main ORF in response to amino acid starvation (7Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 8Abastado J.P. Miller P.F. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It is proposed that this occurs via the starvation-induced phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2, making it unavailable as a substrate for the GDP/GTP exchange factor eIF2B. After translating the first uORF, it is presumed that the absence of an active eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi complex allows the 40 S ribosomal subunit to scan through uORFs 2–4, but at the same time gives the 40 S ribosome subunit time to recharge with eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi to allow reinitiation of translation at the AUG of the main ORF (7Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 8Abastado J.P. Miller P.F. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Although this proposed model is incomplete, there is ample genetic evidence that the status of the eIF2 and other members of the initiation complex, play a role in regulating the reinitiation of translation at the main ORF (9Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A similar combination of small uORFs has been shown to regulate the translation of mammalian ATF4 in response to environmental stress (10Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11269-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). However, it has been proposed that the ability to reinitiate translation downstream of uORFs is dependent on the small size of these ORFs and, were there to be a large uORF, reinitiation at the 2nd ORF AUG would be considerably attenuated, if indeed it would happen at all (11Kosak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3438-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 12Kosak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 5225-5232Google Scholar). A third possible mechanism for translation of the second ORF in dicistronic mRNAs is “context-dependent leaky scanning” (13Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 299: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), where the AUG of the first ORF is in a suboptimal configuration, and so a population of ribosomes fail to initiate at this AUG and continue scanning the mRNA to initiate translation at the AUG of the second ORF. However, there are major constraints on this method of translating downstream ORFs (13Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 299: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). There are a few eukaryotic examples where the mechanism of translation of the second ORF is still in doubt. One of these is the stoned (stn) locus from Drosophila melanogaster (14Andrews J. Smith M. Merakovsky J. Coulson M. Kelly L.E. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1699-1711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stoned locus encodes a single transcript of 8.4 kb, and when cDNAs corresponding to this transcript were isolated, it was observed that they included two tandemly arranged ORFs of 2.5 and 3.7 kb (known as stnA and stnB) with a 55-bp intercistronic region (ICR) (14Andrews J. Smith M. Merakovsky J. Coulson M. Kelly L.E. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1699-1711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both ORFs have been shown to be translated in vivo (14Andrews J. Smith M. Merakovsky J. Coulson M. Kelly L.E. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1699-1711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structurally the stoned proteins (STNA and STNB) were novel, although subsequently genes corresponding to STNB homologues have been identified in mammals (15Martina J.A. Bonangelino C.J. Aguilar R.C. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1111-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 16Walther K. Krauss M. Diril M.K. Lemke S. Ricotta D. Honing S. Kaiser S. Haucke V. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and Caenorhabditis elegans. There are no equivalents of the STNA gene upstream of the STNB cistrons in either C. elegans or mammalian STNB ORFs. One notable feature of the D. melanogaster STNA protein is its lack of internal methionine residues. In a protein of 95 kDa, this is unusual. Here we report the comparison of the stoned locus from a number of insect species, and the identification of another D. melanogaster dicistronic locus where the first ORF contains no in-frame AUG codons. We use this second locus to investigate the effect of in-frame AUG codons on the translation of a second ORF and conclude that the absence of in-frame AUG codons in the first ORF is essential for efficient translation of downstream ORFs. This data is then used to interpret the phenotype associated with a mutation at the stoned locus that inserts a methionine in place of a lysine at position 35 in the stnA ORF. Generating the Snapin::GFP Dicistronic Constructs—The Snapin ORF was isolated by PCR from D. melanogaster genomic DNA using the oligonucleotides 5′-GAATTCTGCAATGGATTCGG-3′ and 5′-TCATGACGAACAGTAATTG-3′. These oligonucleotides included the ATGs that initiate the Snapin and methyltransferase cistrons, and create a 5′ EcoRI site and a 3′ BspHI site. This fragment was then cloned into EcoRI and NcoI cut pALX-190 (a gift from Alex Andrianopolous, University of Melbourne, and consisting of the GFP ORF cloned into the Bluescript (Stratagene) vector) to generate pALX-190:AW. The dicistronic fragment was then removed from pALX190 using EcoRI and XbaI and cloned into the Drosophila expression vector pAc5.1/V5-HisA (Invitrogen) to produce plasmid pAcD1. All further manipulations were carried out in pALX-190:AW and then cloned into pAc5.1. The Snapin was tagged with a myc epitope by inserting annealed oligonucleotides 5′-AGACAGAAACTTATTTCTGAAGAAGATCTTGTGCA-3′ and 5′-CAAGATCTTCTTCAGAAATAAGTTTCTGTTCTTGCA-3′ into PstI cut pALX-190:AW, and subcloned into pAc5.1 to produce pAcD2. This places the myc tag at position +150 bp in the Snapin ORF. An in-frame ATG codon was inserted along with the myc tag using the same site and annealed oligonucleotides, 5′-AATGGAACAGAAACTTATTTCTGAAGAAGATCTTGTGCA-3′ and 5′-CAAGATCTTCTTCAGAAATAAGTTTCTGTTCCATTTGCA-3′, to produce pAcD3. The pAcD4 clone containing an inserted ATG at position 338 was produced from pAcD2 by inserting annealed oligonucleotides 5′-GTCACGATGAAGCTT-3′ and 5′-GTCACAAGCTTCATC-3′ into the BstEII site at position 338 in the Snapin ORF. The pAcD5 clone containing both ATG150 and ATG338 was constructed by inserting the same two oligonucleotides into the BstEII site of pAcD3. A third ATG codon was inserted again at the BstEII site of pAcD3 using annealed oligonucleotides, 5′-GTCACGATGAAGCTTATGGCC-3′ and 5′-GTCACGGCCATAAGCTTCATC-3′, to produce pAcD6. The GFP in all of these constructs was then myc-tagged by cutting the pAcD2-D6 constructs with BspEI and XbaI and inserting annealed oligonucleotides: 5′-CCGGTCTCGAGGAACAGAAACTTATTTCTGAAGAAGATCTTA-3′ and 5′-CTAGTAAGATCTTCTTCAGAAATAAGTTTCTGTTCCTCGAGA-3′, thus creating a novel XhoI site at the 3′ end of the GFP ORF. To create the “optimized” version of pAcD2 and pAcD3, these two constructs were used as templates for PCR using oligonucleotides: 5′-GAATTCAAAATGGATTCGGACAGC-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTCTTCAGAAATAAGT-3′. This replaces the normal 5′-TGCAATGG-3′ Snapin translation initiation site with 5′-CAAAATGG-3′. The PCR fragment was then cut with EcoRI and BamHI and used to replace the EcoRI(1)-BglII(190) fragment in pAcD2 and pAcD3 to produce pAcD2(Opt) and pAcD3(Opt), respectively. The composition of all constructs was confirmed by sequencing. A monocistronic GFP in pAc5.1 was prepared by removing the EcoRI/XbaI fragment from pALX-190 and inserting it directly into pAc5.1 to produce pAcM1. The stnA::GFP fusion constructs were created by PCR from either wild-type or stnts genomic DNA. The constructs that included the small upstream ORF were generated using oligonucleotides 5′-GTGGTACCAACTATTTGCAGACC-3′ and 5′-GGATGCTGCAGGATGATCC-3′, creating 5′ KpnI and a 3′ PstI sites. These fragments were cloned into pAc5.1 DNA followed by the insertion of the PstI-XbaI fragment from pALX-190, containing GFP in-frame. The version of STNA without the small uORF was constructed by using sequential rounds of PCR with wild-type genomic DNA. First a PCR fragment was generated using 5′-GACCAATCTCGGTGCCTCCGC-3′ and the same 3′ oligonucleotide described above. This fragment was then used as a template with 5′-GACCAATCTCGGTACCTCCGC-3′ and the same 3′ oligonucleotide. This again generated a PCR fragment with 5′ KpnI and 3′ PstI sites. The remainder of the construction was as described above. All DNA for transfection was prepared using a Qiagen Midi-prep DNA purification system according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfections—D. melanogaster S2 cells were grown in Invitrogen Schneider's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 22 °C. For transfection, cells (40–60% confluent) were washed in fresh medium and Effectene (10 μl), Enhancer (8 μl) (Qiagen), and DNA (1 μg) were added to give a final volume of 2.6 ml of culture as per the manufacturer's instructions (www.qiagen.com/transfectiontools/cell_list/default.asp). All cell cultures were incubated with the Effectene/DNA for 72 h, unless otherwise stated, before being assayed for GFP fluorescence. Because the transfection efficiency varied between cultures, the lysates were initially subjected to Western blotting, and the blots were used to quantify the levels of Snapin or STNA. Blots were then re-run with loadings that approximately equalized the amounts of Snapin/STNA. Only the ratios of proteins within a transfection are used for comparative analysis. Immunohistochemistry—Cells were fixed using Histochoice (Astral Scientific). Rabbit anti-GFP antibodies (Chemicon) and monoclonal anti-c-Myc (Sigma-Aldrich) were used at 1/50 dilution, and secondary antibodies Alexa 594-conjugated anti-rabbit and Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse (Molecular Probes) were used at 1/250 dilution. Images were captured using an Olympus inverted microscope with an Olympus CCD camera. Comparative GFP fluorescing images were taken at the same aperture and exposure time with the lowest fluorescent transfection being used as the baseline for generating a clear image of individual cells. Negative images were generated using Adobe Photoshop. Fly Stocks and Crosses—All Drosophila stocks were maintained at 22 °C in a 12-h light/dark cycle. Flies for the preparation of head extracts were all 4 days post-eclosion. The “wild-type” used for all the studies was the white-eyed w1118 strain obtained from the Bloomington stock center. The stoned alleles stnts, stnc, and stn13–120 have been described previously (17Miklos G.L.G. Kelly L.E. Coombe P.E. Leeds C. Lefevre G. J. Neurogenet. 1987; 4: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 18Petrovich T.Z. Merakovsky J. Kelly L.E. Genetics. 1993; 133: 955-965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the stoned strains had the white-eyed mutation crossed into them. The stn13–120 allele is embryonic lethal and is maintained as a heterozygote balanced over FM7. The stnc/stn13–120 heterozygotes were generated by crossing stn13–120/FM7 females with stnc males. Western Blots—Harvested S2 cells were lysed by boiling directly in SDS sample buffer, and loaded onto 15% SDS gels. For Drosophila extracts, flies were lightly anesthetized by placing on ice. Their heads were then removed using a scalpel and rapidly homogenized in SDS sample buffer, boiled, and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min, and loaded onto 7% SDS gels. The sample buffer for fly heads contained no reducing agent. Western blots were stained with 0.2% Ponceau S (Sigma) in 3% trichloroacetic acid, and the stained blots scanned to ensure equivalent loading of material. The blots were then probed with anti-STNA antibodies (14Andrews J. Smith M. Merakovsky J. Coulson M. Kelly L.E. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1699-1711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 1/20,000, anti-STNB antibodies (19Kelly L.E. Phillips A.M. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) at 1/5000, anti-myc (Sigma-Aldrich) at 1/500, or anti-GFP (Chemicon) at 1/500. Secondary antibodies, anti-mouse or anti-rabbit, labeled with horseradish peroxidase were used, and the blots were developed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation of the blots was performed by scanning the Ponceau-stained blots and the ECL films, and using MacBas version 2.1 (Fuji Photo) to determine the pixel intensity of the area of the band. Identification of Stoned Homologous Sequences in Other Organisms—The 3′ nucleotide sequence of the D. melanogaster stnA ORF was used to BLAST against the NCBI trace archives of various species. Sequences detected in this way were then translated in all three reading frames and compared with the carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence of STNA and the amino-terminal sequence of STNB from D. melanogaster. Both of these amino acid sequences appear highly conserved across species. The intercistronic sequences were then extracted. Where possible, 5′ extensions of translation products from the contigs identified in these BLAST searches were then compared with the D. melanogaster STNA sequence to obtain amino acid sequence alignments. In this way the presumptive amino acid sequence of the STNA proteins were identified. Where it was possible to identify a complete STNA ORF, all but the Apis melifora STNA amino acid sequence were found to be free of internal in-frame AUG codons. Structural Comparisons of Two Dicistronic Transcripts in Drosophila and Anopheles Species—In the recently released Anopheles gambiae and Drosophila species genomes, we have identified equivalent genomic arrangements of STNA- and STNB-encoding ORFs. Although the sequences that flank the ICRs are highly conserved, the ICRs themselves are entirely divergent (Fig. 1A), and range in length from 15 (Drosophila simulans) to 101 bp (Drosophila pseudoobscura). It would appear that the sequence of the ICR per se is of little consequence. However, in all of the cases where the complete stnA ORF can be identified, no internal in-frame AUG codons are present. This is despite the fact that an amino acid comparison of the STNA proteins from D. melanogaster and A. gambiae show only 37% identity (Fig. 1B), and in evolutionary terms, it might be expected that there would be random mutations that substituted methionine for other residues that would be of little consequence to the overall structure and function of the STNA protein. The D. melanogaster STNA protein contains 30 leucine and 28 isoleucine residues that, with a single base change, could produce a methionine codon and a relatively conservative amino acid substitution. Hence, in a protein of some 850 amino acids, the likelihood that the absence of in-frame AUG codons evolved by chance seems low. The absence of internal methionine codons in the STNA ORF appears to be a highly selected property of STNA in these species. In contrast, the STNB proteins from D. melanogaster and A. gambiae show some five amino acid residues, in conserved regions, which are substitutions of leucine/isoleucine for methionine. This indicates that, overall, there is no evolutionary prejudice against methionine substitutions at the stoned locus. In screening 100 proteins from various eukaryotic sources and of random size that were held in a local data base of synaptic proteins, the average methionine content was found to be 2.5% with the range being from 1.2 to 5.5%. This average is consistent with expectations (20Lehninger A.E. Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Worth Publishers, New York1975: 102Google Scholar). However, one protein was found that contained no internal methionine residues. Drosophila Snapin is an evolutionarily highly conserved protein, consisting of 134 amino acid residues, but containing no internal methionines. The mammalian Snapin (21Ilardi J.M. Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) does contain internal methionines, but at the lower end of the range of methionine content in the randomly selected proteins. This lack of methionines in D. melanogaster Snapin might therefore be a chance event. However, when the D. melanogaster Snapin transcript was investigated, it too was found to be dicistronic (Flybase CG32951), with the 2nd ORF containing a highly conserved methyltransferase protein (Flybase CG9960). The ICR between Snapin and the methyltransferase protein is 21 bp in length and there is no evidence of an IRES sequence (Fig. 1A). The sequence flanking the Snapin/methyltransferase protein ICR has no nucleotide sequence identity, nor nucleotide content similarity, to those surrounding the STNA/STNB ICR. It might be concluded that despite the similarity in ICR-adjacent sequences in the stoned genes, they are unlikely to play a role in translation-initiation at the 2nd ORF. In contrast to the conserved adjacent location of the stoned ORFs, the Snapin and methyltransferase protein genes in A. gambiae are found at very separate locations on chromosome 3. The A. gambiae Snapin protein also contains 3 internal methionine residues, showing that the absence of methionine residues is not a structural or functional requirement of this protein in insects. Both ORF Are Translated in a Snapin/GFP Dicistronic Construct in Drosophila S2 Cells—In an initial series of experiments we constructed a dicistronic gene that included the complete Snapin ORF, the intercistronic region, and initiating AUG of the 2nd ORF, but with the methyltransferase cistron replaced by GFP. For this investigation, Snapin was chosen over STNA as both Snapin and GFP have similar molecular weights and would run in the same region on SDS-PAGE. This reduces the effect of differential transfer efficiency because of size when quantifying data on Western blots. The Snapin/GFP construct was then transfected into Drosophila S2 cells. As compared with a monocistronic GFP, there was a reduction in the fluorescence level in cells transfected with the dicistronic construct (data not shown), however, the transfected cells still showed strong fluorescence, indicating that the GFP cistron was efficiently translated in those cells, with maximum fluorescence obtained at 72 h post-transfection. To be able to determine the production of the Snapin protein in S2 cells, Snapin was tagged with a myc epitope inserted at the PstI site at nucleotide 150 in the Snapin ORF. The tagging had no effect on the level of fluorescence in cells transfected with this construct. Using double labeling of transfected cells, we concluded that the expression of GFP was restricted to those cells that were also expressing Snapin (Fig. 2A). However, it was also apparent that whereas GFP was cytosolic, the Snapin protein appeared to localize to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A). This necessitated the use of whole cell lysates rather than just cytosolic extracts in subsequent Western blot experiments. We then tagged the GFP protein with the myc epitope (see Fig. 2B and “Materials and Methods”). This allowed the use of the same anti-myc antibody to identify both GFP and Snapin on blots and to compare their stoichiometry. Western blots of cultures transfected with this construct showed that both GFP and Snapin were present and could be identified using the anti-myc antibody (Fig. 2C). A time course of expression of Snapin and GFP showed that GFP, as a function of total cell protein, was maximal at 72 h post-transfection (Fig. 2D), and subsequently reduces as the cells continue to grow and the plasmid is diluted out or degraded. During this time course the expression levels of Snapin and GFP were also measured (Fig. 2E). The ratio of GFP to Snapin remained constant throughout the first 96-h post-transfection, but at 168 h there is a decrease in Snapin levels, indicating that it is less stable than GFP in S2 cells over extended periods. It is interesting that the stoichiometry of Snapin to GFP was always in favor of GFP and that the ratio of GFP/Snapin did not vary significantly over the first 96 h (Fig. 2E). It seems unlikely, therefore, that the ratio in favor of GFP at the early time points is due entirely to the preferential degradation of Snapin. Addition of In-frame AUG Codons to the Snapin ORF Attenuate Translation of a Second ORF—We then introduced a series of in-frame AUG codons into the Snapin ORF. These constructs were transfected into S2 cells. In all cases, the introduction of in-frame AUG codons attenuated the GFP signal both in terms of fluorescence (Fig. 3A) and the GFP::myc signal on Western blots (Fig. 3B). Although there was considerable variation in transfection efficiency, we found that for any given construct the ratio of GFP/Snapin was invariant. The effect of a single AUG insertion on the level of GFP as compared with Snapin was determined either by its position in the ORF or, more likely, by the sequence context surrounding the AUG (Fig. 3D). Comparing wild-type with AUG150 and AUG338 the ratio of GFP to Snapin was 1.77 in the AUG-free construct, dropped to 1.1 in AUG150 but to 0.25 in AUG338 (Fig. 3C). The ratio dropped further to 0.055 when AUG130 and AUG338 were combined, and the addition of a third AUG at position 342 reduced the GFP signal even further (Fig. 3C). Obviously the presence of in-frame AUG codons in the Snapin ORF has a significant effect on the translation efficiency of the GFP ORF. We also observed an extra Snapin protein species on the blots (arrow in Fig. 3B). This protein derives from the Snapin ORF as it reacts with the anti-myc antibodies but not with anti-GFP antibodies, and is present in constructs where the GFP is not myc-tagged (data not shown). Indeed its molecular weight corresponded to that expected from a truncation derived from initiation of translation at AUG150. The level of expression of this truncated protein as a proportion of the Snapin is quite variable (10–45% of full-length Snapin levels), although it is always less or equal to the reduction in the GFP/Snapin ratio associated with AUG150. This variability may indicate a lack of stability of the truncated protein as compared with the full-length Snapin. Although the amino acids surrounding the myc tags are different, which might produce differences in the affinity of the anti-myc antibodies, this data does suggest that translation initiation at the 2nd (GFP) ORF is independent of the prior translation and termination of the 1st (Snapin) ORF. Termination/reinitiation would be expected to produce either equal quantities of Snapin and GFP, or less GFP than Snapin, whereas the data (Fig. 2E) suggests that more GFP is produced than Snapin. Translation of the GFP ORF is therefore unlikely to be because of reinitiation. “Optimizing” the Snapin Initiating AUG Attenuates GFP Translation—The stoichiometry of the two proteins in the AUG-free construct, and presence of the truncated Snapin protein in AUG150, suggested that the translation of the 2nd ORF occurs through context-dependent leaky scanning where the scanning ribosome fails to initiate translation at the start of the Snapin ORF. If the efficiency of translation initiation of Snapin were increased, then it might be expected that translation of the GFP ORF might be accordingly decreased. The sequence surrounding the initiating AUG in Snapin is far from the consensus sequence for Drosophila initiation (Fig. 4A) (22Cavener D.R. Ray C.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). We therefore optimized the sequence preceding the Snapin initiating AUG to bring it closer to the consensus sequence (Fig. 4A) and placed this in the dicistronic constructs. Consistent with the leaky scanning model, this optimized sequence reduced the stoichiometry of GFP to Snapin in both the AUG-free construct as well as those where in-frame AUGs have been inserted in the Snapin ORF (Fig. 4B). This indicates that the level of tran"

Human U1 snRNA genes share similar promoter architectures as that of U6 genes but are transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Herein, we report that CK2 inhibits U1 snRNA gene transcription by RNA polymerase II. Decreased levels of endogenous CK2 correlates with increased U1 expression, whereas CK2 associates with U1 gene promoters, indicating that it plays a direct role in U1 gene regulation. CK2 phosphorylates the general transcription factor small nuclear RNA-activating protein complex (SNAPC) that is required for both RNA polymerase II and III transcription, and SNAPC phosphorylation inhibits binding to snRNA gene promoters. However, restricted promoter access by phosphorylated SNAPC can be overcome by cooperative interactions with TATA-box-binding protein at a U6 promoter but not at a U1 promoter. Thus, CK2 may have the capacity to differentially regulate U1 and U6 transcription even though SNAPC is universally utilized for human snRNA gene transcription.

Thus, CK2 may have the capacity to differentially regulate U1 and U6 transcription even though SNAPC is universally utilized for human snRNA gene transcription. Protein kinase CK2 is an important regulator of cellular growth (1Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar, 2Pinna L.A. J.

Ahmed K. Histol. Histopathol. 2001; 16: 573-582PubMed Google Scholar). CK2 is a tetrameric enzyme composed of two catalytic subunits, α and α′, and two copies of the regulatory β subunit (6Niefind K. Guerra B. Ermakowa I. Issinger O.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5320-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). One role for CK2 is to function as a regulatory protein that controls gene transcription. For example, general RNA synthesis in yeast is impaired when a temperature-sensitive mutant of the CK2 α′ subunit is shifted to a restrictive temperature (7Hanna D.E. Rethinaswamy A. Glover C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25905-25914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This decline in total RNA synthesis also suggests that expression of highly transcribed genes encoding ribosomal (r), transfer (t), and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) 1The abbreviations used are: snRNA, small nuclear RNA; TBP, TATA-box-binding protein; SNAPc, small nuclear RNA-activating protein complex; PTF, proximal sequence element transcription factor; PSE, proximal sequence element; RNAi, RNA interference; RT, reverse transcription; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DRB, d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole; HA, hemagglutinin. is sensitive to levels of functional CK2. In yeast CK2 is important for active RNA polymerase III transcription (8Hockman D.J. Schultz M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 892-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and yet, paradoxically, CK2 has been proposed to be the terminal effector in a DNA damage response pathway that represses RNA polymerase III transcription (9Ghavidel A. Schultz M.C. Cell. 2001; 106: 575-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In humans, CK2 exhibits differential effects on gene transcription during the cell cycle. During mitosis, CK2 inhibits RNA polymerase III transcription, whereas at other stages CK2 can stimulate transcription (10Hu P. Samudre K. Wu S. Sun Y. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 81-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The nature of the regulation is dictated by CK2 target selection. One key target for CK2 is the general transcription factor TFIIIB (11Ghavidel A. Schultz M.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2780-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 12Johnston I.M. Allison S.J. Morton J.P. Schramm L. Scott P.H. White R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3757-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13Hu P. Wu S. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 699-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). There are at least two versions of human TFIIIB that function for transcription of distinct classes of genes (14Schramm L. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2593-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The Brf1·TFIIIB complex functions for 5 S rRNA and tRNA transcription and is composed of the TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) and the TBP-associated factors, Bdp1 and Brf1. The Brf2·TFIIIB complex functions for U6 snRNA transcription and is composed of TBP plus Bdp1 but Brf2 instead of Brf1. Brf1·TFIIIB phosphorylation during M phase results in the selective release of Bdp1 from tRNA promoters (15Fairley J.A. Scott P.H. White R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5841-5850Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Hernandez and co-workers (10Hu P. Samudre K. Wu S. Sun Y. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 81-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) further demonstrated that Bdp1 is the critical CK2 target within Brf2·TFIIIB for mitotic repression of U6 transcription. Because Bdp1 is a shared component of both TFIIIB complexes, CK2 may target this factor to repress global RNA polymerase III transcription. However, CK2 inhibitors also interfere with Brf1·TFIIIB binding to the TFIIIC complex (12Johnston I.M. Allison S.J. Morton J.P. Schramm L. Scott P.H. White R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3757-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which itself recognizes intragenic promoter elements of 5 S rRNA and tRNA genes, suggesting that CK2 also has a stimulatory role in RNA polymerase III transcription through enhanced preinitiation complex assembly. Consistent with this positive role, CK2 can also activate RNA polymerase III transcription in human cells (12Johnston I.M. Allison S.J. Morton J.P. Schramm L. Scott P.H. White R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3757-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and in this process may additionally phosphorylate RNA polymerase III itself (13Hu P. Wu S. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 699-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Together, these data point to an important but complex role for CK2 control of RNA polymerase III transcription. Human U6 snRNA genes are interesting because they are transcribed by RNA polymerase III and yet their promoters are similar to other snRNA genes, such as U1 and U2, which are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (16Lobo S.M. Hernandez N.T. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription: Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 127-159Google Scholar, 17Hernandez N. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 63: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Consequently, the mechanisms regulating human snRNA gene transcription by RNA polymerases II and III may also be shared. Nonetheless, the RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes do not use TFIIIB and, thus, rely on other factors for regulatory intervention. Regardless of polymerase specificity, all human snRNA genes contain a distal sequence element encompassing an octamer element that is recognized by Oct-1. Additional sites for the Sp1 (19Ares Jr., M. Chung J.S. Giglio L. Weiner A.M. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 808-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and STAF (20Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) transcriptional activator proteins are adjacently located to the distal sequence element at some snRNA genes (21Hernandez N. McKnight S. Yamamoto K. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor1992: 281-313Google Scholar). Oct-1 activates snRNA transcription by direct protein contacts (22Mittal V. Ma B. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1807-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Ford E. Strubin M.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2772-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with the basal transcription factor called the snRNA-activating protein complex (SNAPC) (25Sadowski C.L. Henry R.W. Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1535-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), which is also referred to as the proximal sequence element transcription factor (PTF) (26Murphy S. Yoon J.B. Gerster T. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3247-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). SNAPC binds to the proximal sequence element (PSE) common to the core promoters of human snRNA genes and functions for both RNA polymerase II and III transcription (18Henry R.W. Ford E. Mital R.

Sadowski C.L. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Nature. 1995; 374: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 28Henry R.W. Ma B. Sadowski C.L. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The largest subunit SNAP190 plays a centrally important role in human snRNA gene transcription first by serving as the scaffold for SNAPC assembly though interactions with most other members of SNAPC (34Ma B. Hernandez N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5027-5035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 35Ma B. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8067-8078Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Once the complex is assembled, SNAP190 further recognizes the PSE through its Myb DNA binding domain (30Wong M.W. Henry R.W. Ma B. Kobayashi R. Klages N. Matthias P. Strubin M. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 368-377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is also the direct target for Oct-1 (23Ford E. Strubin M. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3528-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 36Mittal V. Cleary M.A. Herr W. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1955-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In an unexpected twist, SNAP190 can make DNA contacts within the U1 distal sequence element and stimulate the binding of Oct-1 to this enhancer, suggesting that in some contexts coordinated binding of the activator and general transcription machinery is important for transcriptional activation (24Hovde S. Hinkley C.S. Strong K. Brooks A. Gu L. Henry R.W. Geiger J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2772-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Human U6 snRNA genes, but not U1 genes, also contain a TATA box that is located adjacently to the PSE, and this promoter arrangement dictates that transcription occurs by RNA polymerase III (37Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Cell. 1989; 58: 55-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The TATA box is recognized by the TBP component of the Brf2·TFIIIB complex (35Ma B. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8067-8078Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 38Hinkley C.S. Hirsch H.A. Gu L. LaMere B. Henry R.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 43056-43064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). SNAPC, through its SNAP190 subunit, stimulates TBP binding to the U6 TATA box as an early critical step in RNA polymerase III transcription (35Ma B. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8067-8078Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 38Hinkley C.S. Hirsch H.A. Gu L. LaMere B. Henry R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18649-18657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). TBP is also required for human snRNA gene transcription by RNA polymerase II (25Sadowski C.L. Henry R.W. Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1535-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), but how TBP is recruited to these TATA-less promoters is unclear. Nonetheless, it is likely that SNAPC contributes to TBP activity at these genes. SNAPC and TBP co-purify extensively during the biochemical fractionation of SNAPC (27Henry R.W. Sadowski C.L. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Nature. 1995; 374: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and those fractions enriched for SNAPC and TBP can reconstitute U1 snRNA transcription in vitro from extracts that have been depleted of endogenous TBP (25Sadowski C.L. Henry R.W. Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1535-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, SNAPC plays a pivotal role in snRNA gene transcription by providing core promoter recognition, serving as a target for transcription activation by Oct-1, and coordinating TBP activity and preinitiation complex assembly for both RNA polymerases II and III. Additional RNA polymerase II general transcription factors are also required for U1 transcription including TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, and TFIIF (42Kuhlman T.C. Cho H. Reinberg D. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2130-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As in RNA polymerase III transcription, CK2 also has a complex role in regulating RNA polymerase II transcription. CK2 phosphorylation of TFIIA and TFIIE stimulates preinitiation complex assembly at the adenovirus major late promoter, whereas TFIIF phosphorylation can stimulate RNA polymerase II elongation. In contrast, CK2 phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II inhibits transcription, potentially by impairing elongation (43Cabrejos M.E. Allende C.C. Maldonado E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The striking parallel between RNA polymerase II and III transcription of human snRNA genes prompted an investigation into the role of phosphorylation in U1 transcription. In this study we report that CK2 inhibits overall U1 snRNA gene transcription by RNA polymerase II and can phosphorylate SNAPC to inhibit its DNA binding. Interestingly, cooperative interactions of SNAPC with TBP at U6 but not at U1 promoter DNA can overcome the repressive effects of CK2. Together, these data suggest that CK2 may differentially affect preinitiation complex assembly for RNA polymerase II and III transcription of human snRNA genes depending upon the promoter architecture. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays from HeLa cells were performed using the anti-CK2α(Ab245), anti-CK2β(Ab278) antibodies (44Yu I.J. Spector D.L. Bae Y.S. Marshak D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) as well as anti-SNAP43 (CS48) and anti-TBP antibodies described previously (45Hirsch H.A. Jawdekar G.W. Lee K.A. Gu L. Henry R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5989-5999Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Enrichment of genomic sequences in the immunoprecipitation reactions was measured by PCR as previously described (45Hirsch H.A. Jawdekar G.W. Lee K.A. Gu L. Henry R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5989-5999Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). RNA interference (RNAi)—CK2α and CK2α′ cDNA were generated with a T7 promoter at both ends by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using total RNA from HeLa cells as a template. The primers for CK2α are CK2α forward, 5′-GCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGAAATAATGAAAAAGTTGTTG-3′, and CK2α reverse, 5′-GCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGCTCTTGCAGTAAGCCGTGAC-3′. The primers for CK2α′ are CK2α′ forward, 5′-GCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGCAACAATGAGAGAGTGGTTG-3′, and CK2α′ reverse, 5′-GCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGTCTGTTGATGGTC GTATCGC-3′. LacZ cDNA with a T7 promoter at both ends was generated by PCR using pPelican-lacZ as a template. The primers used are lacZ forward, 5′-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACGATAACCACCACGCTCATCG-3′, and lacZ reverse, 5′-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGCGTTACCCAACTTAATCGCC-3′. Resultant cDNAs were subjected to in vitro transcription with T7 polymerase to produce double-stranded RNA. After DNase I treatment, double-stranded RNA was incubated with recombinant Dicer, and resultant Dicer-generated small interfering RNA were purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Approximately 250 ng of Dicer-generated small interfering RNA for lacZ, CK2α, or CK2α plus 250 ng of CK2α′ Dicer-generated small interfering RNA were transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 30 h later, and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was carried out using Titan One Tube RT-PCR System (Roche Applied Science). The primers used to amplify U1 primary transcript are U1prim forward, 5′-ACTTGCTGCTTCACCACGAA-3′, and U1prim reverse, 5′-ACAGCCTCATACGCCTCACT-3′. The primers used to amplify the total U1 snRNA population are U1 forward, 5′-ATACTTACCTGGCAGGGGAG-3′, and U1 reverse, 5′-CAGGGGAAAGCGCGAACGCA-3′. RT-PCR products were separated by 3% Tris borate EDTA-agarose electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized with Kodak imaging software. In Vitro Transcription Assays—In vitro transcription of human U1 and U6 snRNA genes were performed as described previously (37Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Cell. 1989; 58: 55-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The HeLa cell nuclear extracts were preincubated with Dignam buffer D either with or without recombinant CK2 and kinase inhibitors for 60 min at 30 °C before initiating transcription by the addition of transcription buffers, nucleotide triphosphates, and DNA templates. The amounts of recombinant CK2 and kinase inhibitors used are indicated in the legend to Fig. 2. Transcripts were separated by denaturing PAGE and visualized by PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—GST-SNAP190-(1–719) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) using the vector pSBet-GST-SNAP190-(1–719) and was purified for in vitro kinase assays by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant mini-SNAPC containing SNAP190-(1–719), SNAP43, and SNAP50 was co-expressed in E. coli using the vector combination pSBet-GST-SNAP190-(1–719) and pET21-His-SNAP43/HA-SNAP50. Recombinant mini-SNAPC was affinity-purified using glutathione-agarose beads followed by digestion with thrombin to release the complex from the GST tag and dialysis against Dignam buffer D containing 80 mm KCl. Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Kinase Assays—For the experiment presented in Fig. 3A, 180 μl of HeLa cell nuclear extract (∼10 mg/ml) was incubated with 20 μl of rabbit anti-SNAP43 (CS48 (27Henry R.W. Sadowski C.L. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Nature. 1995; 374: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar)), anti-SNAP190 (CS398, CS402 (30Wong M.W. Henry R.W. Ma B. Kobayashi R. Klages N. Matthias P. Strubin M. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 368-377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), anti-CK2α (Ab245 (44Yu I.J. Spector D.L. Bae Y.S. Marshak D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)), or preimmune antibodies covalently coupled to protein-G agarose beads. Recovered proteins were analyzed by Western blot using a mouse monoclonal antibody against CK2α (Transduction Laboratories). For Fig. 3B, 40 μl of HeLa cell nuclear extract was used for each immunoprecipitation. After extensive washing with HEMGT-150 buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Tween 20, 150 mm KCl), the beads were suspended in 40 μl of HEMGT-150 buffer containing 2 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, 150 mCi/ml), and the samples were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. The beads were then washed extensively in HEMGT-150 buffer, and proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. For Fig. 3C, 100 μl of HeLa cell nuclear extracts were used for immunoprecipitation. After kinase reactions, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Radiolabeled proteins were detected first by autoradiography. Subsequently, Western blot analyses were performed using anti-SNAP190 (CS402) antibodies. For Fig. 5, B and C, ∼5 μg of GST-SNAP190-(1–719) was bound to glutathione-agarose beads (10 μl). Immobilized GST-SNAP190-(1–719) was incubated with 10 μl of HeLa cell nuclear extract for 30 min at 30 °C. The beads were washed extensively with HEMGT-150. In vitro kinase assays were then performed directly on the beads. Kinase reactions were also performed using untreated GST-SNAP190-(1–719) plus 10 units of recombinant CK2 (New England Biolabs). Where indicated, kinase reactions were performed in the presence of 20 nm [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]GTP with or without d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB; Sigma) or 3,3′,4′,5,7-pentahyroxyflavone (quercetin; Sigma). Tryptic Phosphopeptide Mapping—To obtain material for thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis, ∼1 μg of GST-SNAP190-(1–719) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by using HeLa cell nuclear extracts or recombinant CK2. Phosphorylated GST-SNAP190-(1–719) was gel purified before digestion with sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega). The tryptic fragments from each of these reactions were spotted individually or were combined at a 1:1 ratio and spotted onto a cellulose TLC plate. Peptides were separated in the first dimension by electrophoresis in pH 1.9 buffer (formic acid (88% w/v)/glacial acetic acid/distilled H2O, 25:78: 897, v/v/v) and in the second dimension by chromatography in chromatography buffer (n-butanol/pyridine/glacial acetic acid/distilled H2O, 15:10:13:12, v/v/v/v) before detection by PhosphorImager analysis (46van der Geer P. Hunter T. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Endogenous SNAP190 was immunoprecipitated, phosphorylated in vitro in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The ∼190-kDa radioactive protein corresponding to SNAP190 was excised and hydrolyzed in 5.7 n HCl for 1 h at 100 °C. Recovered phosphoamino acids were vacuum-dried and dissolved in 10 μl of pH 1.9 buffer containing cold phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine mixture. The mixture was separated by one-dimensional electrophoresis (500 V) on cellulose TLC plates (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 1 h at 0 °C in pH 2.5 buffer (67% pH 3.5 buffer (glacial acetic acid, pyridine, water, 50:5:945, v/v/v, containing 0.5 mm EDTA) and 33% pH 1.9 buffer (glacial acetic acid, 88% formic acid, water, 78:25:897, v/v/v)). Unlabeled amino acid standards were visualized by spraying the cellulose plates with ninhydrin. The 32P-labeled amino acid residues were visualized by autoradiography with a PhosphorImager. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Approximately 100 ng of purified mini-SNAPc and/or 30 ng of TBP were preincubated alone or with 15 or 150 units CK2 and/or 7 mm ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were then performed using DNA probes containing a wild-type mouse U6 PSE with a wild-type or mutant human U6 TATA box as described previously (38Hinkley C.S.

Science. 1997; 275: 1136-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). CK2 Inhibits U1 snRNA Gene Transcription—The conservation of similar promoter architectures among the human snRNA gene family suggests that these genes could be coordinately regulated. That CK2 regulates human U6 snRNA gene transcription by RNA polymerase III (13Hu P. Wu S. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 699-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) prompted us to examine whether CK2 similarly regulates human snRNA gene transcription by RNA polymerase II. First, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to determine whether endogenous CK2 could associate with the promoter regions of both U6 and U1 snRNA genes. As shown in Fig. 1A, both U6 and U1 promoter regions were enriched in immunoprecipitation reactions using anti-CK2α antibodies (lane 7), whereas U1 but not U6 promoter regions were enriched in the anti-CK2β immunoprecipitation reactions (lane 8). Similar results were obtained in experiments performed with different antibodies directed against CK2α and CK2β (data not shown). Possibly the epitopes recognized by the CK2β antibodies may be occluded by other transcription factors at the U6 promoter. However, this result stands in contrast with that noted previously (13Hu P. Wu S. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 699-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) wherein a more robust CK2β association with this U6 promoter was noted and only weak U1 promoter association by any CK2 subunit was detected. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear, but differences in chromatin immunoprecipitation or cell growth conditions could potentially affect promoter recovery by CK2 antibodies. The levels of U1 and U6 promoter recovery in this reaction were less than that those observed in either anti-SNAP43 (lane 6) or anti-TBP (lane 9) reactions but markedly greater than that seen in reactions using IgG (lane 5). No significant enrichment of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase exon 2 or U1 upstream regions was observed in any reactions. Therefore, endogenous CK2 associates with the promoter regions of both U1 and U6 genes and suggests the possibility that CK2 could additionally affect human snRNA gene expression by RNA polymerase II. To test whether endogenous CK2 influences human U1 gene expression in living cells, CK2 levels were reduced by RNAi, and the effect on U1 snRNA production was monitored by RT-PCR (Fig. 1B). As a negative control, RNAi was also performed using lacZ-specific RNA. Because it was demonstrated that phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II contributes to 3′ processing of human U2 snRNA (48Jacobs E.Y. Ogiwara I. Weiner A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 846-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 49Medlin J.E. Uguen P. Taylor A. Bentley D.L. Murphy S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), it was possible that CK2 could also play a role in U1 3′ processing. Therefore, in this experiment different primer combinations were used to detect either the primary U1 snRNA transcript that is normally processed rapidly or the total U1 snRNA steady state population. Lanes 1–5 (top panel) show that amplification of the U1 p"
