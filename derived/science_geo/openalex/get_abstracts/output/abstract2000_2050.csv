https://openalex.org/W1500910904,"Choleragen catalyzed the hydrolysis of NAD to ADP-ribose and nicotinamide; nicotinamide production was dramatically increased by L-arginine methyl ester and to a lesser extent by D- or L-arginine, but not by other basic amino acids. Guanidine was also effective. Nicotinamide formation in the presence of L-arginine methyl ester was greatest under conditions previously shown to accelerate the hydrolysis of NAD by choleragen (Moss, J., Manganiello, V. C., and Vaughan, M. (1976) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 73, 4424-4427). After incubation of [adenine-U14C]NAD and L[3H]arginine with coleragen, a product was isolated by thin layer chromatography that contained adenine and arginine in a 1:1 ratio and has been tentatively identified as ADP-ribose-L-arginine. Parallel experiments with [carbonyl-14C]NAD have demonstrated that formation of the ADP-ribosyl-L-arginine derivative was associated with the production of [carbonyl-14C]nicotinamide. As guanidine itself was active and D- and L-arginine was equally effective in promoting nicotinamide production, whereas citrulline, which possesses a ureido rather than a guanidino function, was inactive, it seems probable that the guanidino group rather than the alpha-amino moiety participated in the linkage to ADP-ribose. Based on the assumption that the ADP-ribosylation of L-arginine by choleragen is a model for the NAD-dependent activation of adenylate cyclase by choleragen, it is proposed that the active A protomer of choleragen catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of an arginine, or related amino acid residue in a protein, which is the cyclase itself or is critical to its activation by choleragen."
https://openalex.org/W2018472585,"Flagellin, the protomeric subunit of bacterial flagella, contains no cysteine. We have detected the incorporation of trace quantities of 35S-cysteine into flagellin, highly purified and then resolved by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, to measure mistranslation in vivo. Under normal conditions, this value is about 6 X 10(-4) pmoles cysteine per pmole flagellin. This value is greatly increased during growth in low concentrations of streptomycin and neomycin, antibiotics which are known to stimulate misreading in vitro. Of the specific types of misreading which streptomycin stimulates in vitro, only misreading of the CGU and CGC arginine codons could give rise to illegitimate incorporation of cysteine. In agreement, partial arginine starvation increases the incorporation of 35S-cysteine into flagellin in a relA- mutant, with or without streptomycin, but has no such effect in its isogenic relA+ partner- Assuming from these results that 35S-cysteine incorporation into flagellin reflects misreading of CGU/C coda, we deduce a misreading probability per codon in the range of 10(-4)."
https://openalex.org/W1547259066,"After chondroitinase digestion of bovine nasal and tracheal cartilage proteoglycans, subsequent treatment with trypsin or trypsin followed by chymotrypsin yielded two major types of polypeptide-glycosaminoglycan fragments which could be separated by Sepharose 6B chromatography. One fragment, located close to the hyaluronic acid-binding region of the protein core, had a high relative keratan sulfate content. This fragment contained about 60% of the total keratan sulfate, but less than 10% of the total chondroitin sulfate present in the original proteoglycan preparation. The weight average molecular weight of the keratan sulfate-enriched fragment was 122,000, as determined by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation. The chemical and physical data indicate that this fragment contains an average of 10 to 15 keratan sulfate chains, if the average molecular weight of individual chains is assumed to be about 8,000, and about 5 chondroitin sulfate chains attached to a peptide of about 20,000 daltons. The other population of fragments was derived from the other end of the proteoglycan molecule, the chondroitin sulfate-enriched region, and contained mainly chondroitin sulfate chains. About 90% of the total chondroitin sulfate, but only 20 to 30% of the total keratan sulfate was recovered in these fragments. On the average, approximately 5 chondroitin sulfate chains and 1 keratan sulfate chain could be linked to the same peptide. Another 10 to 20% of the total keratan sulfate, originally found in or near the hyaluronic acid-binding region, was not separated from the chondroitin sulfate-enriched fragments. Hydroxylamine could be used to liberate a large molecular size, chondroitin sulfate-enriched fragment (Kav 0.54 on Sepharose 2B) from the proteoglycan aggregates. The remainder of the protein core, containing the keratan sulfate-enriched region, was bound to hyaluronic acid with the link proteins and recovered in the void volume on the Sepharose 2B column."
https://openalex.org/W1541936125,"The present studies concern the roles of synthesis and degradation of the large subunit of (Na+ + k+)-adenosine triphosphatase (NaK-ATPase) in the response to triiodothyronin (T3). Single doses of either the diluent of T3 (50 mug/100 g body weight) were given to two pairs of surgically thyroidectomized rats. Twenty hours after injection, the rats received 3H- or 35S-labeled methionine administered as a constant injusion into the tail vein for 1 h. The kidneys were removed either 8 h or 20 h after infusion and the eight kidneys were divided into pairs, as follows. I, 3H (diluent)/35S (T3); II, 35S (diluent)/3H (T3); III, 3H (diluent)/35S (diluent); IV, 3H (T3)/35S (T3). Partially purified NaK-ATPase was prepared from the pooled homogenates and prepared from the pooled homogenates and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAG-electrophoresis). The large subunit of NaK-ATPase was identified by (Na+ + mg2+)-dependent and K+-sensitive incorpotation of 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP. This component had an estimated molecular weight of 92,000 and migrated as a single peptide in gels of varying total carylamide concentration, with respect to: (1) Coomassie blue staining, (b) (Na+ + Mg2+)-dependent, K+-sensitive incorporation of 32P from [gamma-32-P]ATP, and (c) T3-dependent enhanced incorporation of labeled methionine. T3 augmented incorporation of labeled methionine into the large subunit by 44% 8 h after infusion of the amino acid and by 61% 20 h after infusion. Incorporation of methionine into two adjacent polypeptides in the SDS gels was unaffected by thyroid status. The effect otical NaK-ATPase was assessed by a double label technique. Pairs of thyroidectomized rats were injected with either the diluent or 50 mug of T3/100 g body weight at 48-h after the first injection (diluent or T3, i.e. Day zero). Kidney cortices were processed on either Day 4 or Day 6; the partially purified NaK-ATPase fraction was prepared, labeled with [gamma-32P]ATP, and analyzed by SDS-PAG-electrophoresis. The degredation rate constants of the large subunit were similar; 0.145 and 0.124 day-1 for the hypothyroid and T3-treated groups, respectively. Thus, the T2-dependent increase in incorporation of labeled methionine into the large subunit appears to result from enhanced synthesis and this increase is sufficient to account for the entire increase in both the number of the activity of the NaK-ATPase units."
https://openalex.org/W1575474722,"1. Five subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon) of an ATPase from a thermophilic bacterium PS3 were purified in the presence of 8 M urea by ion exchange chromatography. Then the ATPase activity was reconstituted by mixing the subunit solutions and incubating them at 20-45 degrees, at pH 6.3 to 7.0. 2. Mixtures containing beta + gamma or alpha + beta + delta regained ATP-hydrolyzing activity, but mixtures of alpha + beta and beta + delta did not. Combinations not including beta were all inactive. 3. The ATPase activity reconstituted from alpha + beta + delta was thermolabile and insensitive to NaN3, whereas the activities obtained from mixtures containing beta and gamma were thermostable and sensitive to NaN3, like the native ATPase. 4. The assemblies containing both beta and gamma subunits had the same mobility as the native ATPase molecule on gel electrophoresis, those without the gamma subunit moved more rapidly toward the anode. 5. Subunits epsilon and delta did not inhibit the ATPase activity of either the assembly (alpha + beta + gamma) or the native ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1512501067,"Abstract In thyroidectomized rats, a single injection of L-2,,5,2'-triiodothyronine (T3) (50mug/100 g body weight) elicited at 45% increase in (Na+ + k+)-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (NaK-ATPase) activity of the membrane-rich fraction of renal cortex at the optimal time of response, 48 h after injection. Three successive doses of T3 (50 mug/100 g body weight), given on alternate days, increased NaK-ATPase by 67% in the renal cortex but had no significant effect on the outer medulla or the papilla. Moreover, T3 had no effect on Mg2+-dependent adenosine trisphatase (MgATPase) in cortex, cedulla, or papilla. Three doses of T3 (50 mug/100 g body weight) given on alternate days to thyroidectomized rats elecited a 134, 79, and 46% increase in Vmax for ATP, Na4, and K+, respectively. There were no changes in the Km for ATP or the K1/2 values for Na+ and K+. Two methods were used to estimate the effect of T3 on the number of NaK-ATPase units (assumed to represent the number of Na+ pump sites); rat renal plasma membrane fractions were incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP, Mg2+, and Na+; the 32P-labeled membrane protein yeild was quantitatively dependent on Na+ and was hydrolyzed on addition of K+. There was a linear correlation between the specific activity of NaK-ATPase (Vmax) and the amount of phosphorylated intermediate formed, in renal cortical membrane fractions from thyroidectomized rats given T3 or the diluent. There was also a linear correlation between the specific activity of NaK-ATPase (Vmax) and the amount of [3H]ouabain specifically bound (Na+-, Mg2+-, APT-dependent) to the NaK-ATPase preparation. Injection of T3 resulted in a 70% increase in NaK-ATPase activity, a 79% increase in formation of the phosphorylated intermediate, and a 65% increase in the [H]ouabain specifically bound to the NaK-ATPase system. The T3-dependent increases in Vmax for ATP, Na+, and K+ and the proportionate increases in the phosphorylated intermediate and in the amount of [3H]ouabain bound indicate that T3 increases the number of NaK-ATPase units and that this increase accounts for the increase in NaK-ATPase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1602093697,"The relative effectiveness of the ligands Mg2+, Na+, and ATP in preparing sodium plus potassium ion transport adenosine triphosphatase for phosphorylation was studied by means of a rapid mixing apparatus. Addition of 2 mM MgC12, 120 mM NaC1, and 5 muM [gamma-32P]ATP simultaneously to the free enzyme gave an initial phosphorylation rate of about 0.3 mu mol-mg-1-min-1 at 25 degrees and pH7.4. Addition of Mg2+ to the enzyme beforehand, separately or in combination with Na+ or ATP, had little effect on the initial rate. Addition of Na+ only to the enzyme beforehand increased this rate 1.5- to 3-fold. Early addition of ATP 130 ms before Na+ plus Mg2+ increased the rate 6- to 7-fold. Early addition of Na+ plus ATP was most effective; it increased the rate about 10-fold. The data indicate that Na+ and ATP bind in a random order and that each ligand potentiates the effect of the other. The rate of dissociation of ATP from the enzyme was estimated by a chase of unlabeled ATP of variable duration. This rate was slowest in the presence of Mg2+ (k = 540 min-1), most rapid in the presence of Na+ (k = 2000 min-1), and intermediate (k = 1100 min-1) in the absence of metal ions. The effect of Na+ concentration on the rate of phosphorylation was estimated when Na+ with Mg2+ was added to the enzyme-ATP complex. The rate followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a maximum of 2.9 mu mol-mg-1 and a Km of 8 mM. The effect of Na+ concentration was also estimated on the increment in the rate of phosphorylation produced by the presence of Na+ with the enzyme-ATP complex beforehand. The increment followed the same kinetics with a maximum of 3.75 mu mol-mg-1-min-1 and a Km of 5.4 mM. In both cases estimation of the Hill coefficient failed to show cooperativity between binding sites for Na+. In contrast, the dependence of ouabain-sensitive ATPase activity on Na+ concentration in the absence of K+ indicated two sites for Na+ with apparent Km values of 0.16 and 8.1 mM, respectively."

Furthermore, the preparation exhibits nearly the same activity if the nonionic detergent dodecyl octaoxyethyleneglycol monoether is substituted for the added phospholipid. The delipidated ATPase is soluble in the detergent and retains activity for several days. This is the first report of the Ca2+-ATPase retaining high activity with less than about 30 mol of phospholipid bound per mol of polypeptide."

https://openalex.org/W1584470588,"Cross-linking reagents have been used to link covalently adjacent subunits of solubilized spinach chloroplast coupling factor 1, which is a latent ATPase. 1,5-Difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, dimethyl-3,3'-dithiobispropionimidate, and dimethylsuberimidate are able to form bridges of 3 to 11 A between amino groups, and hydrogen peroxide and the o-phenanthroline-cupric ion complex catalyze the oxidation of intrinsic sulfhydryl groups. The five individual subunit bands (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon) and several new aggregate bands can be separated by means of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The same four fastest moving aggregate bands, as characterized by their mobilities, migrate more slowly than the heaviest subunit band and appear with all of the cross-linkers employed. The subunit composition of the aggregate bands has been determined through the use of the reversible cross-linkers, dimethyldithiobispropionimidate, (o-phenanthroline)2Cu(II), and H2O2, and two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in which aggregates are separated in the first dimension, the disulfide cross-links are cleaved, and the individual subunits present in the aggregates are separated in the second dimension. The subunits are detected by Coomassie brilliant blue staining and by labeling some of the sulfhydryl groups of the gamma and epsilon subunits with radioactive N-ethylmaleimide. The results obtained indicate that the alpha and beta subunits can cross-link directly with each of the other subunits, that two beta subunits are adjacent, and that gamma epsilon, gamma epsilon 2, alpha delta, and beta delta aggregates are present. A minimal subunit stoichiometry consistent with these results is alpha 2 beta 2 gamma delta epsilon 2. A possible structural model of the coupling factor is derived from the data. Similar, but less extensive, experiments have been carried out with the heat-activated coupling factor (which is an ATPase); no differences in the spatial arrangement of subunits are detected from the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis of the cross-linked aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W1548538265,"From Acanthamoeba castellanii, we have purified four proteins each of which alone causes a solution of F-actin to gel. The four active proteins have subunit molecular weights of about 23,000, 28,000, 32,000 and 38,000, respectively; the last three may be dimers in their native proteins. Together, these four proteins account for about 97% of the gelation activity of the whole extract; not more than about 3% of the total activity of the unfractionated extract can be due to a 250,000-dalton polypeptide. Another protein fraction, purified by agarose chromatography, induces shrinking (syneresis) of gels formed from F-actin and any of the gelation factors. That fraction contains a high Ca2+-, low (K+,EDTA)-ATPase and a major polypeptide of 170,000 daltons both of which bind to actin in the shrunken gel pellet. The active fraction does not contain the previously described Acanthamoeba myosin (Pollard, T. D., and Korn, E. D. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 4682-4690)."
https://openalex.org/W1504086631,"Native Glu-human plasminogen (Mr approximately 92,000 with NH2-terminal glutamic acid) is able to combine directly with streptokinase in an equivalent molar ratio, to yield a stoichiometric complex. The plasminogen moiety in the complex then undergoes streptokinase-induced conformational changes. As a result of such, an active center develops in the plasminogen moiety of the complex. This proteolytically active complex then activates plasminogen in the complex to plasmin and at least two peptide bonds are cleaved in the process. The data presented in this paper reveal that initially an internal peptide bond of plasminogen (in the complex) is cleaved to yield a two-chain, disulfide-linked plasmin molecule. The heavy chain (Mr approximately 67,000 with NH2-terminal glutamic acid) of this plasmin molecule has an identical NH2-terminal amico acid as the native plasminogen. The light chain (Mr approximately 25,000 with NH2-terminal valine) of plasmin is known to be derived from the COOH-terminal portion of the parent plasminogen molecule. A second peptide is then cleaved from the NH2-terminal end of the heavy chain of plasmin producing a proteolytically modified heavy chain (Mr =60.000 with NH2-terminal lysine). This cleavage of the NH2-terminal peptide from the heavy chain of plasmin is shown to be mediated by the dissociated free plasmin present in the activation mixture. Plasmin in the streptokinase-plasmin complex is unable to cleave this NH2-terminal peptide. This same NH2-terminal peptide can also be cleaved from native Glu-plasminogen or from the Glu-plasminogen-streptokinase complex by free plasmin and not by a complex of streptokinase-plasmin. From these studies we conclude (a) in the streptokinase-plasminogen complex, the NH2-terminal peptide need not be released prior to the cleavage of the essential Arg-Val peptide bond which leads to the formation of a two chain plasmin molecule and (b) that this peptide is cleaved from the native plasminogen or from the heavy chain of the initially formed plasmin in the streptokinase complex by free plasmin and not by the plasmin associated with streptokinase. In agreement with this, plasmin associated with streptokinase was unable to cleave the NH2-terminal peptide from the isolated native heavy chain possessing glutamic acid as the NH2-terminal amino acid; whereas free plasmin readily cleaved this peptide from the same isolated Glu-heavy chain."
https://openalex.org/W1548097551,"Characteristics of the exchange reactions catalyzed by beef heart submitochondrial particles give new insight into energy transducing steps of oxidative phosphorylation. The uncoupler-insensitive portion of the total Pi in equilibrium HOH exchange in presence of ATP, ADP, and Pi is the intermediate Pi in equilibrium HOH exchange, that is the exchange occurring with Pi formed by hydrolysis of ATP prior to release of Pi from the catalytic site. The exchange of medium Pi with HOH is as sensitive to uncouplers as the Pi in equilibrium ATP exchange and net oxidative phosphorylation, demonstrating a requirement of an uncoupler-sensitive energized state, probably a transmembrane potential or proton gradient, for bringing medium Pi to the reactive state. The covalent bond forming and breaking step at the catalytic site (ADP + Pi in equilibrium ATP + HOH) appears relatively insensitive to uncouplers. Thus to the extent that uncouplers dissipate transmembrane proton-motive force, it is unlikely that such a force is used to drive ATP formation by direct protonations of Pi oxygens. When only Pi and ADP are added and formation of ATP from added ADP by adenylate kinase and subsequent ATP hydrolysis are adequately blocked, no Pi in equilibrium HOH exchange can be observed, demonstrating a requirement of energization by ATP binding and cleavage for such an exchange. This uncoupler-insensitive energization is suggested to represent a conformationally energized state that can be used reversibly to develop a transmembrane protonmotive force accompanying ADP and Pi release. Rates of various exchanges as estimated by improved procedures are compatible with all oxygen exchanges occurring by dynamic reversal of ATP hydrolysis at the catalytic site."
https://openalex.org/W1542244804,"13C nmr spectral parameters were measured for intact bovine nasal cartilage tissue, the purified proteoglycan aggregate, and chondroitin 4-sulfate. A comparison of integrated intensities obtained for four different samples of fresh tissue with an ethylene glycol standard indicated that at least 80% of the total glycosaminoglycan carbons in the tissue contributed to the spectrum. This result was confirmed by intensity measurements obtained at 56 degrees on fresh tissue and at 37 degrees after extensive papain digestion of fresh tissue. Spin lattice relaxation times and nuclear Overhauser enhancements were analyzed in terms of the following models of molecular motion: (a) single correlation time; (b) log X2 distribution of correlation times; and (c) anisotropic motion. The analysis indicates that the segmental motions of glycosaminoglycan chains are characterized by a broad distribution of correlation times centered at about 50 ns. Slow motion contributions to glycosaminoglycan line widths were reduced by dipolar decoupling (gammaH2/2pi = 65 kHz). Collagen intensity was observed in dipolar decoupled spectra, but not in scalar decoupled spectra of intact tissue, showing that the type II collagen in cartilage undergoes anisotropic motion like the type I collagen in tendon. Only glycosaminoglycan resonances were observed in spectra of a solution of proteoglycan aggregate before and after chondroitinase digestion. After subsequent digestion with papain, protein resonances were observed. These results suggest that the protein portions of the proteoglycan aggregate structure, in contrast with the glycosaminoglycan chains, have restricted backbone mobility and consequently a defined backbone structure."

https://openalex.org/W1605464194,"The ability of various kinds of RNA molecules to activate the ATP hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by the p transcription termination factor from Escherichia coli has been studied. The most active RNA polymers are those containing cytidylate residues and very little ordered structure. Free poly(C) is the most active homopolymer; it is 45 times more active than poly(U), which is the only non-cytidine containing RNA that has detectable activity. Poly(C) has no activity when complexed with poly(I) or when the chain lengths are shorter than 22 nucleotides long. Although cytidylate residues are important they need not be frequent; a random copolymer of uridine and cytidine nucleotides with as few as 1 cytidylate residue out of 20 is as active as poly(C). The extent of activation with poly(C) depends on the ratio of p to poly(C). Poly(C) becomes saturated with p at a ratio of 1.8 ng of p/pmol poly(C), which is equivalent to one p monomer/27 nucleotides. A further increase in this ratio leads to a reduction in p activity. Decreasing the length of the poly(C) does not alter the observed saturation value but does decrease the rate of ATP hydrolysis when the RNA is in excess. The possible relevance of these results to p termination activity is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1984910898,"Myosin and paramyosin have been purified from the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. The properties of the myosin in general resemble those of other myosins. The native molecule is a dimer of heavy (210,000 dalton) polypeptide chains and contains 18,000 and 16,000 dalton light chains. When rapidly precipitated from solution, it forms small, bipolar aggregates, about 150 nm long, consistent with the expected molecular structure of a rigid rod with a globular head region at one end. Its ATPase activity is stimulated by CA2+ and EDTA. The myosin binds to F actin in a polar and ATP-sensitive manner, and the Mg2+-ATPase is activated by either F actin or nematode thin filaments. Dialysis of myosin to low ionic strength produces very long filaments. When a myosin-paramyosin mixture is dialyzed under the same conditions, co-filaments form which consist of a myosin cortex, surrounding a paramyosin core. Some properties of myosins from the mutants E675 and E190, which have functionally and structurally altered body wall muscles, are compared with those of wild-type myosin. These myosins behave normally in in vitro tests. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of the myosin heavy chain composition."
https://openalex.org/W1842427001,"Inside-out membrane vesicles of human red cells, prepared according to the method of Steck et al. (1970) Science 168, 255-257) have sufficiently low cation permeability to allow the examination of the side-specific interactions of ligands with the asymmetric sodium pump complex. In accordance with the known properties of the pump in intact cells the following results were observed: (a) ATP-dependent sodium influx and (b) maximal (sodium, potassium)-ATPase with K+ present inside the vesicles with larger than or equal to 20 micronM ATP. With much lower [ATP], K+ inhibited sodium-activated ATPase. K+ was inhibitory at either surface. Inhibition was different on the two sides since cytoplasmic (extravesicular) Na+ counteracted inhibition by cytoplasmic (extravesicular) K+ but not inhibition by K+ at the plasma or external membrane surface, i.e. intravesicular K+. A decrease in the steady state level of the phosphenzyme intermediate of sodium-activated ATPase was caused also by K+ at either surface. The effect of cytoplasmic K+ is compatible with its competitive inhibition of activation of phosphorylation of the enzyme by cytoplasmic Na+. At 37 degrees, the inhibitory effect of external K+ is due to interaction with the phosphoenzyme to form a stable complex of K+ with the dephosphenzyme resulting in a decreased overall reaction rate but increased turnover of the phosphoenzyme (E-P + K leads to EK + Pi). At 0 degree, external K+ inhibits by interacting with the unphosphorylated enzyme to form an occluded enzyme-K complex. This results in a decreased overall rate but relatively small change in apparent turnover of the phosphoenzyme. At 0 degree, but not at 37 degrees, external Na+ counteracted the inhibitory effects of external K+."
https://openalex.org/W1492922819,"The purification of p protein to homogeneity from Escherichia coli has shown that its RNA-dependent ATPase activity is physically inseparable from its termination activity.

The reaction is not affected by a Zn2+ ion chelator and is inhibited by 1 mM Zn2+. With Mg2+ present, the activity is essentially constant from pH 7 to pH 9.7. pATPase is sensitive to p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and to N-ethylmaleimide.

https://openalex.org/W1607086761,"Both the formation and decay of phosphorylated ATPase, and Ca2+ release from and rebinding to transport sites alpha sites) on the enzyme have been investigated in the pre- and post-steady states by means of rapid mixing acid quench technique and a stopped flow technique, respectively. At a relatively high concentration of enzyme (10 muM protein) and a low concentration of free Ca2+ (1.42 muM), rapid changes in the Ca2+ affinity of the transport sites could be monitored with the use of a Ca2+ indicator dye, Arsenazo III. As the enzyme becomes phosphorylated, Ca2+ is released. In the early stages, the ratio of Ca2+ released to acid-stable phosphoenzyme is less than 2, while at the maximum of Ca2+ release, which occurs later than the maximum phosphorylation, it is greater than 2. Assuming that phosphorylation of the enzyme releases both Ca2+ bound to it (Ikemoto, N. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 7219), these data are consistent with the sequential formation of two acid-stable intermediates differing in Ca2+ affinity and a third acid-labile phosphorylated species of low Ca2+ affinity. The changes in Ca2+ affinity are probably related to changes in the structure of the ATPase transport protein that are involved in the Ca2+ translocation in the intact sarcoplasmic reticulum. As the ATP is being used up, Ca2+ rebinding occurs concomitantly with the decay of phosphoenzyme. The comparison of the time courses of Ca2+ rebinding with that of dephosphorylation in the post-steady state suggests that interactions among phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated ATPase molecular may also be involved in the Ca2+ affinity changes."

Treatment of the enzyme with trypsin (5 mug/mg of F1 for 3 min) reduced the ADP to zero, abolished coupling activity, but had no effect on the ATPase activity, stability, or membrane-binding capability of the F1. When the trypsin concentration was varied between 0 and 5 mug/mg of F1, tightly bound ADP was removed to varying degrees, and a correlation was seen between amount of residual tightly bound ADP and residual coupling activity. Gel filtration of the native F1 in high ionic strength buffer containing EDTA also caused complete loss of tightly bound ADP and coupling ability, whereas ATPase activity, stability, and membrane-binding capability were retained. The ADP-depleted F1 preparations were unable to rebind normal amounts of ADP or any ATP in simple reloading experiments. The results strongly suggest that tightly bound ADP is required for ATP synthesis and for energy-coupled ATP hydrolysis on F1. The results also suggest that ATP synthesis and energy-linked ATP hydrolysis rather than involving one nucleotide binding site on F1, involve a series or cluster of sites. The ATP hydrolysis site may represent one component of this cluster. The results show that nonenergy-coupled ATP hydrolysis on F1 can occur in the absence of tightly bound ADP or ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1573975524,"A heat-stable protein has been detected in Saccharomyces cerevisiae which inhibits mitochondrial ATPase activity. The protein inhibitor has been isolated from extracts prepared by brief heat treatment of unbroken cell suspensions. The isolated inhibitor is a small basic protein (molecular weight close to 7000, isoelectric proint 9.05) devoid of tryptophan, tyrosine, and cysteine as well as proline. The NHP2-terminal amino acid is serine. The ultraviolet absorption spectrum shows the vibrational fine structure of the phenyl-alanine band. Like the ATPase inhibitor from bovine heart mitochondria the yeast inhibitor is rapidly destroyed by trypsin. It is also inactivated by the yeast proteinases A and B. Radioimmunological analysis indicates that the inhibitor is synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes. Its accumulation seems to be connected to the formation of the mitochondrial ATPase complex, since its specific activity is greatly reduced both in extracts obtained from the F1-ATPase-deficient nuclear mutant pet 936 and from the cytoplasmic petite mutant D 273-10B-1."
https://openalex.org/W1593535214,"Temporal patterns of biosynthesis of the sarcoplasmic reticulum protein, calsequestrin, were analyzed and compared with rates of ATPase synthesis in primary cultures of rat skeletal muscle cells. Rates of synthesis were measured by the incorporation of radioactive leucine into the isolated proteins. Cells at various stages of differentiation were incubated for 2 h with tritium-labeled leucine and extracted with detergent. The extracts were incubated with antibodies specific against calsequestrin or the ATPase and immunoprecipitates were separated by disc gel electrophoresis. Incorporation of radioactivity into bands identified as calsequestrin or the ATPase was analyzed by counting of gel slices. In Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DME medium) containing 0.1 volume of horse serum and 0.005 volume of chick embryo extract, the cells began to fuse after about 50 h in culture, forming multinucleated myotubes. Calsequestrin synthesis was barely detectable after 24 h in culture. After 44 h, before fusion of myoblasts began, the rate of calsequestrin synthesis increased severalfold. The rate of synthesis continued to increase until about 72 h and then diminished. If cells were transferred at 44 h to DME medium containing 0.2 volume of fetal calf serum and 0.08 volume of chick embryo extract, fusion was delayed by about 20 h. In this medium the rate of calsequestrin synthesis diminished after a peak at 44 h but, by contrast, the rate of synthesis of the ATPase increased dramatically following fusion at about 80 h. If cells were transferred at about 40 h to DME medium containing 0.1 volume of horse serum and only 60 muM Ca2+ the cells did not fuse and, again, the rate of calsequestrin synthesis was diminished after a peak at about 40 h. By contrast the rate of ATPase synthesis increased sharply in spite of the lack of fusion. Both proteins were degraded with a half-life of about 20 h. These studies show that the synthesis of calsequestrin, an extrinsic membrane protein, and the ATPase, an intrinsic protein of the same membrane, are synthesized under separate control."
https://openalex.org/W1504578981,"The arginine-binding reagents, butanedione and phenylglyoxal, inhibit the ATPase and the ATP-P, exchange activities of an ATP synthetase preparation (complex V) isolated from bovine heart mitochondria. The second order rate constants for inhibitor-enzyme interaction derived from the analysis of inhibition kinetics of ATPase and ATP-P, exchange activities are, respectively, 6.4 and 15.4 M-’ min-I for butanedione as inhibitor and 36.8 and 69.2 M-’ min-’ for phenylglyoxal as inhibitor. These data indicate that phenylglyoxal is the more effective inhibitor and ATP-P, exchange is the more susceptible activity. The estimated reaction orders with respect to inhibitor concentration varied between 0.77 and 1.15, thus suggesting an approximately equimolar inhibitor-enzyme interaction for inhibition of either ATP hydrolysis or ATP-P, exchange. The inhibition of ATPase activity by phenylglyoxal appeared to be noncompetitive with respect to ATP. Data for ATP-P, exchange could not be similarly analyzed because of substrate inhibition at high ATP concentrations, which became more effective in the presence of phenylglyoxal. ADP protects against phenylglyoxal inhibition of the ATPase activities of complex V and soluble ATPase (F,) from mitochondria, and as tested with complex V the degree of protection is a function of ADP concentration. Little protection is afforded by ADP against phenylglyoxal inhibition of complex V ATP-P, exchange activity. In complex V, both activities are protected, however, by 2,4-dinitrophenol, while no protective effect of the uncoupler was observed on the inhibition of ATPase activity of soluble F,. In submitochondrial particles butanedione inhibited the equilibrium binding of the uncoupler 2-azido-4nitrophenol to the mitochondrial uncoupler-binding site. The above results are consistent with the possible presence in F, (ATPase) of an essential arginyl residue involved in ATPase activity and a second and more susceptible argi"

https://openalex.org/W1559981307,"A calorimetric titration method was used to study ADP binding to native myosin. Data were analyzed by assuming that the myosin molecule has n independent and identical sites for ADP binding. The enthalpy change (deltaH), the binding constant (K), and n were determined. In 0.5 M KCl, 0.01 M MgCl2, and 0.02 M Tris/HCl (pH 7.8), we found: at 0 degrees, deltaH = -57.1 +/- 3.2 kJ-mol-1, log K = 6.42 +/- 0.13, n = 1.49 +/- 0.07; at 12 degrees, deltaH = 73.1 +/- 3.2 kJ-mole-1, log K = 6.08 +/- 0.13, and n = 1.74 +/- 0.07. The average heat capacity change on ADP binding to myosin between 0 and 12 degrees is thus -1.4 +/- 0.4 kJ-mol-1-K-1. Reasonably consistent results were obtained at 25 degrees, suggesting ADP binding to myosin is as strongly exothermic as at lower temperatures, although further interpretation of this result seems unwarranted, mainly because of the instability of myosic at this temperature. The number of protons released on binding of ADP to myosin was determined in separate experiments. The value was 0.19 +/- 0.02 at both 0 and 12 degrees. The reaction of protons with Tris thus contributes about -9.5 kJ-mol-1 to the observed heat on ADP binding."

Reactions leading to formation of fd duplex-replicative (RFII) structures have been reconstituted with purified proteins from E. coli. Maximal synthesis requires the combined action of E. coli binding protein, DNA elongation factor I, DNA elongation factor II preparations (which are a mixture of dna Z and DNA elongation factor III), DNA polymerase III, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, Mg2+, dATP, dGTP, dCTP, dTTP, and ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP. In contrast to crude extracts of E. coli, purified protein fractions do not distinguish between fd DNA and phiX174 DNA in duplex DNA formation. The addition of crude fractions of E. coli to the purified components listed above selectively permits fd RFII formation and prevents phiX RFII formation. This selective inhibition was used as an assay to isolate proteins essential for this phenomenon; they include RNase H, discriminatory factor alpha, and discriminatory factor beta."
https://openalex.org/W1608222244,"Spinach chloroplasts were incubated in the dark with methyl acetimidate in order to amidinate and thereby protect free amino groups. An energy-dependent attack on the coupling factor (CF1) of these amidinated chloroplasts by trinitrobenzenesulfonate was apparent in a second reaction, as long as the reagent was applied in the light or after an acid-base transition. Trinitrophenyl residues approached one each on the alpha and beta subunits, and two to three on the gamma subunit polypeptide of CF1. Accompanying trinitrophenylation was an inhibition of the ATPase activity of CF1 due to a major decrease in the affinity for ATP; however, neither the maximal ATPase rate nor the ability of the protein to serve as a coupling factor for EDTA-extracted chloroplasts was affected. Trinitrophenylation and consequent inhibition of ATPase were 50% prevented by the presence of phosphate, or ADP, or ATP during exposure to trinitrobenzenesulfonate. The protective effects of adenylates were additive with those of phosphate. The ratio of trinitrophenyl groups on the three subunits concerned was the same whether phosphate or ATP was providing 50% protection, or whether neither was present. It is inferred that a conformational change occurs in the amidinated coupling factor when a proton activity gradient is placed across the membranes, and effective ligands tend to prevent the resulting exposure of free amino groups from a previously hidden location."

https://openalex.org/W1523781457,"The heavy polypeptide chains of human Glu-plasmin and human Lys-plasmin have been isolated in native solvents, after partial reduction and carboxymethylation of the corresponding plasmins. Two major forms of each heavy chain can be eluted, after adsorption to Sepharose/lysine, utilizing a gradient of epsilon-aminocaproic acid as the eluant. The elution profile of these heavy chains is practically identical to the elution behavior previously observed for human Glu- and Lys-plasminogen, and human Glu- and Lys-plasmin adsorbed to these columns. Sedimentation velocity analysis of the heavy chain of human Glu-plasmin, in the presence of epsilon-aminocaproic acid, demonstrated that a gross conformational alteration occurs in this peptide accompanying binding of this amino acid. A much smaller conformational alteration occurs under similar circumstances with the human Lys-plasmin heavy chain. We find that the NH2-terminal peptide released in the Glu-plasminogen to Lys-plasminogen and Glu-plasmin to Lys-plasmin conversions is also released in the Glu-plasmin heavy chain to Lys-plasmin heavy chain conversion. This reaction is catalyzed at a significant rate only by plasmin and not by urokinase. Finally, no strong interaction between streptokinase and the isolated plasmin heavy chains is observed."

https://openalex.org/W1571540953,"Myosin was extracted from frozen squid brain and purified by a modification of the procedure of Pollard et al. (Pollard, T.D., Thomas, S.M., and Niederman, R. (1974) Anal. Biochem. 60, 258-266). Myosin was eluted from Bio-Gel A-15m column as a single peak of (K+-EDTA)-activated ATPase ((K+-EDTA)-ATPase) activity with an average partition coefficient (Kav) of 0.22. In sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis, the purified myosin showed a predominant band with similar electrophoretic mobility as the heavy chain of rabbit skeletal muscle myosin, and two less intense bands near the bottom of the gel. No actin band was seen. The properties of the (K+-EDTA)-ATPase activity were: (a) the time course of the reaction was biphasic at 25 degrees but linear at 32 degrees; (b) the optimum rate of reaction was obtained between 0.3 and 0.8 M KCl; (c) the pH optimum was between 8.0 and 9.0; (d) the reaction was specific for ATP with an apparent Km of 0.19 mM. ATPase activity in 0.06 M KCl and 5 mM MgCl2 was increased about 1.5 times by a 10-fold excess of rabbit skeletal muscle F-actin and about 5 times by a 40-fold excess. The actin activation was inhibited slightly by the addition of 0.2 mM CaCl2 and completely by the addition of 10 mM CaCl2. Myosin formed arrowhead patterns with rabbit skeletal muscle F-actin as observed by electron microscopy of negatively stained samples. It also aggregated in bipolar filaments which attached to decorated actin filaments at different angles, as well as formed cross-connections and ladder-like patterns between actin filaments. These two forms of interactions between myosin and actin were abolished by treatment with MgATP."

The purified ATPase, containing both fragments, transports Ca2+ when incorporated into vesicles containing excess phospholipid. The two fragments can only be dissociated in solutions containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Ca2+ transport activity is restored in SDS-dissociated preparations in a series of steps involving dilution with 5 volumes of 5% phospholipids in 0.75% sodium cholate, incubation in ice for 30 min, and passage through an anion exchange column. Vesicles formed in this procedure regain high Ca2+ transport activity if they are incubated in SDS solution at 24 degrees for less than 20 min. However, the extent of renaturation diminishes if the vesicles are incubated for longer periods and little acitivity is recovered in vesicles incubated longer than 60 min at 24 degrees."

Essentially all of the bound  ATP and ADP was removed by trypsin treatment. The trypsin-treated ETPH had increased ATPase activity, undiminished NADH oxidase and succinate oxidase activity, but energy-coupling activity (ATP-driven reversed electron transfer) was abolished. Removal of half the ATP and ADP occurred at low levels of trypsin and was associated with loss of half of the coupling activity. Gel filtration of ETPH in high ionic strength buffer also removed ADP and ATP from the particles, resulting in loss of energy-coupling activity, while ATPase activity was increased. The results support the contention that the tightly bound ADP is essential in energy coupling in mitochondria. Tightly bound ATP may also play an essential role."

Conversely, antiserum against the large subunit (the catalytic subunit Mr = 96,000) partially inhibits phosphorylation of the enzyme, but does not interfere with the binding of [3H]ouabain to the enzyme.

Separately, Mn2+ and SO4(2-) have no significant effect. In the presence of glucose-6-P, Mn2+ activates the enzyme, but SO4(2-) inhibits; MnSO4 synergetically increases the enzyme activity. Mn2+ reduces the Ka for glucose-6-P to one-tenth of the control value; SO4(2-) increases the Ka 5-fold; however, MnSO4 has no effect on Ka. MnSO4, like glucose-6-P, increases the Vmax of the enzyme in the presence of its substrate, UDP-glucose; it slightly increases the Km for UDP-glucose. In the presence of glucose-6-P, Mn2+ increases and SO4(2-) decreases the Vmax of the enzyme, but neither has an effect on the Km for UDP-glucose. At physiological concentrations of UDP-glucose and glucose-6-P, either Mn2+ or MnSO4 at concentrations less than 1 mM increases the enzyme activity as much as 8 mM glucose-6-P does.

https://openalex.org/W1488320108,"The reaction of bovine cardiac myosin with the site-specific purine disulfide analog of ATP, 6,6'-dithiobis (inosinyl imidodiphosphate), was studied to determine the stoichiometry of labeling and subunit location of the reactive cysteines. The analog inactivates myosin by forming a mixed disulfide between the thiopurine nucleotide and certain key cysteines. The thiopurine nucleotide was displaced quantitatively by 14CN to form the more stable thiocyanato-enzyme derivatives. In cardiac myosin, the reactive cysteines could be categorized into three classes, nonessential, critical, and noncritical. The modification of the critical cysteines (two per myosin) inactivated the EDTA and Ca2+ ATPase activities, the latter to a lesser extent. The nonessential cysteines (two to three per myosin) and the noncritical cysteines (two per myosin), differentiated by their rates of reaction, had no effect on the ATPase activities after modification. Thiocyanato-modified myosin was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis to determine the distribution of 14CN in the subunits. The critical cysteines were found on the 21,000-dalton light chain (LC1) and the noncritical cysteines on the heavy chains. More specifically, the critical cysteine modified in cardiac LC1 (determined from the products after cyclization and chain cleavage at the thiocyanatoalanyl residues) was shown to be the thiol residue whose surrounding amino acid sequence is homologous to that of the single cysteine of the skeletal myosin alkali light chains, confirming the likely similar structure and function of these light chains in the two different muscle types."
https://openalex.org/W1568015783,"Bovine cardiac myosin ATPase activity was rapidly inactivated by the purine disulfide analog of ATP,6,6'-dithiobis(inosinyl imidodiphosphate). Kinetic investigations showed that this analog acted as a site-specific reagent at 0 degrees with a Ki of 130 muM and a half-life of 8.2 min at saturating inhibitor concentrations. Concentrations (50 to 500 muM) of ATP, adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), or ADP that saturated the active site caused an enhancement in the rate of inactivation, indicating the purine disulfide analog was not reacting at the active site. Under these conditions saturation kinetic data were still observed with Ki values remaining unchanged (120 muM) but with the half-life of inactivation decreasing to 6.0 min (ATP) and 4.6 min (AMP-PNP) at saturating inhibitor concentrations. At concentrations greater than 0.5 mM ATP, AMP-PNP, or ADP there was a decrease in the rate of inactivation, implying protection by these nucleotides. However, saturation kinetics of inactivation could no longer be demonstrated, implying a change in the mechanism of inactivation. A comparison of the inactivation of the Mg2+, Ca2+, and EDTA-ATPase activities of cardiac myosin after modification by the purine disulfide analog showed that the Mg2+- and Ca2+ATPase activities plateaued at approximately 60% and 40%, respectively, while the EDTA-ATPase activity continued to decrease to below 10%. This evidence supports the suggestion that the purine disulfide analog was not reacting at the active site. Equilibrium dialysis experiments were used to measure the binding of [8-3H]AMP-PNP to native cardiac myosin, the thiopurine nucleotide-modified myosin, and the derivative formed by displacing the thiopurine nucleotide by cyanide (thiocyanato-myosin). Native myosin bound a total of 2.1 mol of AMP-PNP with a binding constant of 6.0 X 10(6) M-1. There was a 15 to 40% decrease in the number of AMP-PNP binding sites in the enzyme derivatives, but the active sites appeared not to be blocked since the association constants remained essentially unchanged (KA=3.9 X 10(6) M-1 for thiopurine nucleotide-myosin and 12.0 X 10(6) M-1 for thiocyanato-myosin). The kinetic studies and the binding experiments indicate that the purine disulfide analog reacts at a specific site other than the active site but do not offer support to earlier suggestions from skeletal myosin studies that this site is a possible ATP control site."
