https://openalex.org/W1594663644,"Predefined changes in a known DNA sequence were introduced by a general method. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides complementary to positions 582 to 593 of the viral DNA strand of the bacteriophage phiX174 am3 mutant (pGTATCCTACAAA), and to the wild type sequence in this region (pGTATCCTACAAA), were synthesized and used as specific mutagens. Each of these oligonucleotides was incorporated into a complete circular complementary strand when used as primer on a genetically heterologous viral strand template, by the combined action of subtilisin-treated Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and T4 DNA ligase. Incomplete duplexes were removed or were inactivated by nuclease S1 and the products were used to transfect spheroplasts of E. coli. Both oligonucleotides induced specific mutations at high efficiency when used with heterologous template (15% mutants among progeny phage). The am phages isolated by this procedure are phenotypically gene E mutants, and contain A at position 587 of the viral strand. They thus appear identical with am3 and provide evidence that the change G leads to A at position 587 is sufficient to produce a defective E function. Since the template for the induction of am mutants carried another genetic marker (sB1), the strains carrying the induced mutations have the new genotype am3 sB1. It should be possible to introduce the am3 mutation into any known mutant strain of phi174 using this same oligonucleotide. Both possible transition mutations were induced in these experiments. In principle, the method could also induce transversions, insertions, and deletions. The method should be applicable to other circular DNAs of similar size, for example recombinant DNA plasmids."

https://openalex.org/W1654622166,"The antibiotic edenine induces binding of multiple 40 S ribosomes to reovirus messenger RNAs, producing complexes that sediment rapidly in glycerol gradients. Rapidly sedimenting complexes were also obtained with tobacco mosaic virus RNA and rabbit globin mRNA in the presence of edeine. Following ribonuclease digestion of the heavy complexes, nuclease-resistant 32P-labeled reovirus fragments protected by 40 S ribosomes in the presence of edeine were recovered and fingerprinted. The sequence complexity of the protected material supports the interpretation that 40 S subunits are distributed at many internal sites in each messenger RNA. Additional experiments indicate that binding of the multiple 40 S subunits occurs from a single entry site which involves the 5' terminus of the message. This, in turn, implies that in the presence of edeine 40 S ribosomes are able to move along the mRNA chain, attaching initially near the 5' end, then advancing to make room for the next subunit. We suggest that in the absence of antibiotics, also, a 40 S ribosome might bind near the 5' terminus and then advance, stopping where it encounters the first AUG triplet. The effect of edeine might be to interfere with the AUG recognition process, thus allowing the 40 S ribosome to continue unhalted along the message. The present experiments with edeine provide the first direct evidence that 40 S ribosomal subunits are capable of moving along the mRNA chain."

https://openalex.org/W2028916257,"PROCESS formation can be induced in clonal neuroblastoma cells by a macromolecule termed glial factor which has been identified in medium conditioned by cultured C-6 glioma cells1. Fibre outgrowth can also be elicited in cultures of peripheral sensory neurones2 by the well-characterised mouse sub-maxillary gland nerve growth factor (NGF)3, which has been shown to be a different entity from glial factor4. We report here that glioma-conditioned medium (GCM), the source of glial factor, can support both survival and fibre formation of isolated chick sensory neurones and that neither NGF nor glial factor are responsible for this effect."

https://openalex.org/W1518721573,"The rate of denaturation of hemaglobin and other proteins by mechanical shaking is strongly affected by organic solvents. A group pf solvents,including alcohols and ketones, was found to stabilize proteins at low concentrations, although these same organic solvents denatured proteins at high concentrations. The stabilizing effect of alcohols increased with increasing chain lenghts. The second group of solvents, including toluene and chloroform, showed only a destabilizing effect, while the third group of solvents such as formamide and pentane had no effect over a wide range of concentrations. Organic solvents may be used to protect or denature a specific protein in solutions containing various proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1547543864,"Cystathionine beta-synthase has been purified from human liver more than 3000-fold by a series of steps including high speed centrifugation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, chromatography on hydroxylapatite and DEAE-cellulose, gel filtration, preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and glycerol density gradient centrifugation. The enzyme obtained is homogeneous as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in four different systems: native, isoelectric focusing, in sodium dodecyl sulfate, and in 8 M urea. The native enzyme has an estimated molecular weight of 94,000 and is composed of two apparently identical subunits of 48,000. The pure enzyme has a specific activity of 160 units/mg of protein and contains tightly bound cofactor, pyridoxal 5' -phosphate. It is possesses serine sulfhydrase as well as cystathionine synthase activity. It has a broad pH optimum from 8.4 to 9.0, apparent Km values for L-serine of 1.15 mM and for L-homocysteine of 0.59 mM, and a pI of 5.2 The enzyme is stable over a pH range from 6.5 to 8.0 in phosphate buffers and can be stored in 40% glycerol at -15 degrees C for at least 1 month."
https://openalex.org/W109284476,"Mitochondria from rat renal cortex were incubated with physiological concentrations of glutamate, or glutamine, or both. Changes in medium ammonia, glutamate, glutamine, and aspartate were measured and fluxes through glutamate dehydrogenase, glutaminase, and glutamate oxalacetate transaminase were calculated at different pH levels in vitro and in mitochondria from animals in which metabolic acidosis was induced in vivo. In the presence of glutamate alone as substrate, aspartate formation was always large with respect to ammonia formation. Lowering the pH from 7.4 to 6.8 decreased aspartate production but resulted in no consistent increase in ammonia formation. At pH 7.4 the deamination pathway accounted for 21% and, at pH 6.8, 26% of the total glutamate utilization. When glutamine was the only substrate and glutamate was generated inside the mitochondria, the deamination pathway accounted for 39% of the glutamate utilization at pH 7.4 and 32% at pH 6.8. At pH 7.4 fluxes through glutaminase, glutamate dehydrogenase, and glutamate oxalacetate transaminase were all high with respect to the fluxes measured at pH 6.8. With both glutamine and glutamate as substrates, glutamate metabolism occurred almost exclusively by transamination and the deamination pathway was negligible. Ammonia generation by mitochondria isolated from animals subjected to 7 days of NH&l acidosis was increased 235% in the presence of both substrates. Glutamate deamination was markedly accelerated and contributed one-half of the augmented ammonia synthesis. With glutamine as substrate, glutamate dehydrogenase flux increased 4-fold while glutaminase flux rose a-fold. In the presence of both glutamine and glutamate, the increase in glutamate dehydrogenase flux was even more marked, rising 50-fold compared to control. The increase in glutamate dehydrogenase flux could not be explained entirely by an increase in glutamate dehydrogenase enzyme activity, enhanced glutamate transport, an alteration in the mitochondrial oxidation-reduction state or by equilibrium considera"
https://openalex.org/W1504611001,"Clone 15B cells, derived from Chinese hamster ovary cells and deficient in a specific UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:glycoprotein N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity, synthesize glycoproteins with altered oligosaccharide units. Glycopeptides prepared from these glycoproteins contain large quantities of a glycopeptide with the composition (Man)5(GlcNAc)2-Asn whereas parent cells have only small amounts of this glycopeptide. The structure of the glycopeptide was determined by the combination of methylation analysis, acetolysis, Smith periodate degradation, and alpha- and beta-mannosidase digestion. Its complete structure is Manalpha 1 leads to 6[Manalpha1 leads to 3]-Manalpha1 leads to 6[Manalpha 1 leads to 3]-Manbeta1 leads to 4 GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 4 GlcNAc leads to Asn-peptide. The structures of two other glycopeptides found in smaller quantities in clone 15B but not detected in the parent cells were determined and are Manalpha 1 leads to 6 [Manalpha 1 leads to 3]-Manalpha1 leads to 6Manbeta 1 leads to 4 GlcNAcbeta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc-Asn-peptide and Manalpha 1 leads to 3 Manalpha 1 leads to 6[Manalpha 1 leads to 3] Manbeta 1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc-Asn-peptide. It is proposed that the (Man)5(GlcNAc)2-Asn unit is the physiologic acceptor for the particular N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase which is deficient in clone 15B cells and that this reaction is necessary for complex oligosacchari-e biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1565086399,"The reaction between nitrosylhemoglobin and an excess of deoxymyoglobin has been used to study the kinetics of ligand dissociation from Hb4(NO)4 and Hb4(no)1 species. The kinetics of the dissociation of the first NO molecule from Hb4(no)4 was studied by the ligand replacement method. The results indicate that: (a) the ligand dissociation reaction in Hb4(NO)4 is a cooperative process. This is consistent with the results of Moore and Gibson (Moore, E.G., and Gibson, Q.H. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 2788-2794). (b) alpha and beta chains in the T state formed by adding IHP to Hb4(NO)4 show kinetic heterogeneity. (c) A similar kinetic heterogeneity is shown by alpha and beta chains in the species Hb4NO in the absence of IHP.(d) The value for the NO dissociation rate constant calculated from the slow phases observed in (b) and (c) is similar to that estimated for the R state. These results suggest that the R to T transition brought about with or without inositol hexaphosphate changes the ligand affinity of one type of the chains much more than of the other. On the basis of IR and EPR studies, it is suggested that alpha chains undergo larger functional changes in R to T transition (or vice versa) in nitrosylhemoglobin. The kinetic parameters for HbNO are compared with those of HbO2 and HbCO and the implications of the results for the reaction mechanism are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1563135275,"This communication describes a novel effect of actinomycin D (AcD) in inhibiting the nuclear processing or turnover of estrogen receptors in the human breast cancer cell line. MCF-7. In the absence of AcD, estradiol treatment results in rapid (5 min) hormone binding and translocation of unfilled cytoplasmic receptors (Rc) and binding of unfilled nuclear receptors (Rn). Thereafter, filled nuclear receptors (RnE) progressively deplete and, by 3 to 5 h, 70% are lost or processed. We now show that 1 to 2 micrometer AcD or chromomycin A3, both of which intercalate at G-C base-pairs on DNA, selectively and completely block RnE processing. In contrast, estrogen binding, translocation of receptor complex, and RnE accumulation in the nucleus are completely insensitive to AcD inhibition. At 1 to 2 micrometer, all other intercalators and inhibitors tested, including other inhibitors of transcription and replication, or inhibitors of translocation or of other functions, fail to prevent binding, translocation, or the nuclear processing step. AcD intranslocation, or the nuclear processing step. AcD inhibition of RnE processing is dependent on dose; at lower doses (100 nM decreasing to 1 nm), progressively greater RnE depletion occurs. AcD completely prevents RnE depletion if given together with or within 30 min after estradiol; at any time between 30 min and 5 h after estradiol, the processing of RnE is stopped instantly by addition of AcD. Because of the complexity of actinomycin action, several mechanisms can be proposed to explain its effect on nuclear ER levels."

https://openalex.org/W1522521252,"A method is described for preparation of apolipoamide dehydrogenase which gives quantitative removal of FAD. Active holoenzyme can be reconstituted by incubation with FAD. Reconstitution of apoenzyme with 8-Cl-FAD results in the fixation of most of the flavin to the protein in a covalently bound form. The portion noncovalently bound was shown to be unmodified 8-Cl-FAD. The covalently bound flavin has an absorption spectrum quite different from that of 8-Cl-FAD. It has a single band in the visible with a maximum at 459 nm (extinction coefficient of 22 mM-1 cm-1) and a shoulder at 480 nm. Model reactions between 8-Cl-Flavin (riboflavin or FAD) and organic thiols (thiophenol, beta-mercaptoethanol, or N-acetylcysteine) give products with spectra which are similar to that of FAD covalently bound to lipoamide dehydrogenase. The products of the model reactions have a single visible band with a maximum at 480 nm (extinction coefficient of 23.6 mM-1 cm-1 to 28.4 mM-1 cm-1) and a shoulder at 460 nm. The products of the model reaction and the covalently bound FAD of lipoamide dehydrogenase appear to be the result of a nucleophilic attack on the carbon at position 8 of the flavin ring by a thiolate anion, displacing the chloride. Thus, the product of the model reaction is 8-(RS)-flavin, and the product of the reaction between 8-Cl-FAD and protein probably has a cysteinyl residue covalently attacked at position 8 of FAD. Reconstitution of apoliopoamide dehydrogenase with 8-Cl-FAD gives two enzyme products which are fractionated by ammonium sulfate. Enzyme fractionating between 20% and 45% ammonium sulfate is monomeric and contains covanently bound FAD. Enzyme fractionating between 55% and 75% ammonium sulfate is dimeric and contains both covalently bound FAD and noncovalently bound 8-Cl-FAD. Both protein fractions contain one FAD per protein subunit and both are active with physiological substrates with Km values for NAD and dihydrolipoamide similar to those of native lipoamide dehydrogenase. The maximum turnover rates differ dramatically. Enzyme fractionating between 55% and 75% ammonium sulfate has a Vmax which is 61 times slower than native enzyme. Enzyme fractionating between 20% and 45% ammonium sulfate has a Vmax which is 7400 times slower than native enzyme. These slower rates are partially explainable by the oxidation-reduction potentials of the modified enzymes. Both covalently bound FAD and noncovalently bound FAD appear to reside in the native flavin binding site of the enzyme. However, once dimerization of the protien has taken place, the noncovalently bound 8-Cl-FAD cannot be induced to form a covalent bond with the protein except under protein denaturing conditions. The implications of these findings are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1537572219,"Hepatic microsomal heme oxygenase, the rate-limiting enzyme in heme degradation, is rapidly and markedly stimulated in selenium-deficient rats but not in controls, after a single injection of phenobarbital sodium. This stimulation occurred as early as 2 h and reached an 8- to 10-fold maximum 6 h following the drug. These observations suggest that phenobarbital rapidly and markedly enhances the degradation of hepatic heme in selenium deficiency. The cause for this rapid phenobarbital-mediated stimulation of heme degradation was investigated. It could not be ascribed to either accelerated turnover of cytochrome P-450, or enhanced lipid peroxidation possibly resulting from the concomitant lack of glutathione peroxidase in selenium deficiency. For these reasons, the metabolism of hepatic heme in the selenium-deficient rat liver was further examined during the 6-h period following phenobarbital. These studies indicated that whereas heme was synthesized much faster and to a greater extent in the selenium-deficient rat liver than in the control, its utilization in the formation of hemoproteins such as cytochrome P-450 and tryptophan pyrrolase was apparently impaired in selenium deficiency. Such defective utilization of heme in the 6-h period following phenobarbital could effectively result in a relative excess of unutilized free heme; hence the consequent stimulation of microsomal heme oxygenase for its disposal."

The hybrid molecule was reconstituted effectively from a reduced mixture of Fragment A and the lectin subunit by oxidation with o-phenanthroline and CuSO4. The monovalent hybrid protein was partially purified and found to be toxic to L cells. The toxicity of the hybrid protein on the cells was blocked by the addition of either N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, which specifically binds to the lectin, or by anti-Fragment A antibody."
https://openalex.org/W2139864850,"Abstract The presence of mRNA coding for creatine kinase M (Mck) and creatine kinase B (B-CK) RNA from myogenic and fibrogenic cell cultures, embryonic muscle, and embryonic brain tissue was demonstrated by in translation a heterologous cell-free protein-synthesizing system from rabbit reticulocytes. The products were isolated by sensitive immunochemical methods and their identity with isolated M-CK and B-CK was shown by the following criteria: (a) the vitro synthesized creatine kinases react with the specific antibody against these antigens; (b) the labeled peptides co-migrate with purified creatine kinase on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels single bands; (c) the labeled peptides form homo- and heterodimers with isolated enzymatically active creatine kinase, thus behaving like authentic creatine kinases. The assay was shown to be reproducible and gave a linear response with increasing amounts of RNA, allowing relative quantitation of mRNA polysomal RNA for the creatine kinases M and B. MRNA for M-CK was detected polusomal RAN and total cellular RNA from myogenic cells. It is also present polysomal RNA from enbryonic muscle and the fraction binding to oligo(dT)-cellulose. mRNA for B-CK could be found RNA extracted from young myogenic cultures and the fraction of polysomal embryonic brain RNA binding to oligo(dT)-cellulose."

https://openalex.org/W1541679890,"The cyclic dodecapeptide analog of the linear polyhexapeptide of tropoelastin crystallizes from water on raising of the temperature and thereby demonstrates an inverse temperature transition implying dominant intermolecular hydrophobic interactions. The temperature profiles of turbidity (TP tau) of the cyclododecapeptide are analogous to those of the polyhexapeptide where increases in concentration lead to translations of the profiles to lower temperature without sharpening of the transition. The demonstration of increase in order with increase in temperature for the cyclododecapeptide in water and the similarity of TPtau's lends credence to the view that increases in temperature lead to increases in order, specifically, for the linear polyhexapeptide and, generally, for the precursor protein of the elastic fiber wherein the repeating hexapeptide occurs."

https://openalex.org/W1596348372,"Rat liver poly(A)-containing RNA was translated in an ascites cell-free system. Labeled protein precipitable by antibody directed against rat serum albumin was identified as pre-proalbumin based on its size and partial NH2-terminal sequence. However, when an ascites membrane fraction was added to the translation reaction, the albumin antibody-precipitable material was smaller than pre-proalbumin. Partial NH2-terminal sequence analysis of this protein revealed that it was proalbumin. Conversion of pre-proalbumin to proalbumin by the ascites membrane fraction was complete and precise--i.e. no serum albumin was observed. Reconstitution in vitro of the processing of pre-proalbumin to its stable intracellular form, proalbumin, provides a method for studying the initial proteloytic event involved in secretion of rat serum albumin."

https://openalex.org/W1628722111,"Monolayer cultures of pituitary cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]leucine for several minutes and the incorporated radioactivity was analyzed by immunoprecipitation and electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate containing polyacrylamide gels. Following a 3-min labeling period, a peak of radioactivity with a mobility similar to that of preprolactin was observed, as well as radioactivity co-migrating with prolactin. Competition with unlabeled prolactin demonstrated the specificity of the immunoprecipitation reaction. After 5 min of pulse-labeling followed by 5-min chase in medium with unlabeled leucine, only a product with the mobility of prolactin remained. Addition of a membrane fraction from dog pancreas to a wheat germ cell-free translation system containing pituitary mRNA resulted in the conversion of preprolactin to prolactin. Partial sequence analysis demonstrated that the processed product contained the correct NH2 terminus of prolactin. Thus, both intact pituitary cells and a cell-free heterologous system are able to synthesize preprolactin and cleave it to prolactin offering strong evidence that preprolactin is the biosynthetic precursor to prolactin."

https://openalex.org/W1533698512,A method is described for the isolation of a homogeneous preparation of dense granules from procine platelets. The purified dense granule fraction contained approximately 400 nmol of 5-hydroxytryptamine/mg of protein and appeared to be homogeneous when examined by electron microscopy. Isolated dense granules transport exogenously added 5-hydroxytryptamine via two mechanisms: 1) a carrier-mediated process predominating at low substrate concentrations and 2) a diffusion-controlled process predominating at high substrate concentrations. Temperature studies revealed an apparent energy of activation of 14.9 kcal/mol for the carrier-mediated transport. Kinetic data yielded a Km of 3.3 micron and a Vmax of 0.79 nmol/min/mg of protein for the mediated transport process. Steady state uptake was sensitive to changes in medium osmotic pressure and a decline in uptake below 300 mosM was correlated with release of endogenous 5-hydroxytryptamine. The transport was inhibited by a number of structural analogs of 5-hydroxytryptamine. These results demonstrate the existence of a carrier-mediated transport system for 5-hydroxytryptamine in the membranes of the platelet dense granules.

https://openalex.org/W2159584703,"Vero, a cell line derived from African green monkey kidney, normally contains a single species of tRNAPhe (tRNA2Phe), containing a hypermodified base, wye (originally called Y), next to the 3' end of the anticodon. When methionine is removed from the growth medium, there appears a new tRNAPhe species (tRNA1Phe) lacking the wye base and eluting early from reversed phase chromatography columns. Its appearance is not due to the cessation of cell growth. Addition of methionine to cells containing both species of tRNAPhe leads to the disappearance of tRNA1Phe. When [methyl-3H5methionine is added in the presence of actinomycin D, which blocks new RNA synthesis, label appears in the wye base of tRNA2Phe. These results are consistent with the model that tRNA1Phe is an undermodifed precursor of tRNA2Phe and that methionine is required for modification to the mature form."

https://openalex.org/W1854074729,"The tRNA genes of bacteriophage T5 are located in four clusters on the continuous heavy DNA strand (Chen, M.-J., Locker, J., and Weiss, S.B. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 536--547). Three of the four clusters are within the DNA C segment; the fourth cluster, to which only tRNAArg has been localized, maps in a 3.02 kilobase (kb) region of which 1.99 kb are at the right end of the C segment and 1.03 kb at the left end of the D segment. In order to localize the tRNAArg gene further and to define its relationship to the C-D nick, we devised a suitable method for preparing T5 DNA fragments whose ends correspond to the position of the T5 DNA nicks contained in the light DNA strand. In this method, DNA is denatured, partially renatured, and digested with low concentrations of S1 nuclease. Agarose-gel electrophoresis of these digests gives a pattern of bands which correlate in size with the pattern expected from the nicked structure of T5 DNA. Annealing of individual purified T5 [35P]tRNA species to the T5 DNA fragments transferred to nitrocellulose filters shows that tRNAArg hybridizes exclusively to the D fragment and is therefore localized to 1.03 kb at the 5' (left) end of the heavy strand of the D segment. This finding suggests that the promotor for this early gene is to the right of the C-D nick in T5 DNA; hence, the C-D nick does not coincide with this early promotor."
