Information regarding its occurrences, physical properties, chemical analysis, and X-ray diffraction data are included."
https://openalex.org/W2002022202,"Measurements of magnetospheric ultralow-frequency plasma waves (period tau, approximately 18 to 150 seconds) on the ground under continuous daylight conditions in the Antarctic and under alternate day-night solar illumination at the conjugate station in Quebec indicate a significant local time dependence in the transmission properties of the ionosphere for waves of these periods. When the Antarctic station is compared with the Quebec station, the tilt (with respect to the ionosphere) of the orientation plane of the waves is observed to be larger at local noon than at local night."

https://openalex.org/W1967827068,An artificial cloud in the cloudless atmosphere at a temperature below 0 degrees C was formed by introducing pellets of Dry Ice into air containing more water vapor than would be present at the saturation point with respect to ice. Such clouds could be utilized to establish radiative equilibrium between ground and air so as to inhibit the cooling of selective arctic surface regions under clear skies.
