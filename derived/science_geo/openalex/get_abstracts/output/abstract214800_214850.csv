https://openalex.org/W2061905027,PREVIOUS work1 has shown that the intravenous injection of large numbers of live Brucella abortus into chickens results in the appearance in the serum of a viral inhibitor with the properties of interferon. Inhibitor reached maximum levels about 12 h after inoculation. It was also reported that large numbers of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) particles produced maximum levels of interferon in chickens about 12 h after intravenous inoculation. Injection of large doses of other gram-positive and -negative bacteria or bacterial endotoxins failed to produce demonstrable inhibitors in the circulation of chickens at 6–8 h.

https://openalex.org/W2079655106,"Cross-correlation analysis reveals a close correlation between the waves in an electroencephalogram and slow membrane transients of single neurons of the sensorimotor cortex of cats during spontaneous activity, augmenting and recruiting responses, and after local application of strychnine. Time-series correlation coefficients up to 0.7 have been computed. It is suggested that the waves of the electroencephalogram reflect an integration of the changes of membrane potentials in both the cell bodies and dendrites of cortical neurons."

These responders were considered heterozygous for this trait since their mating resulted in at least one nonresponder offspring. Of 31 offspring from 10 breeding pairs (nonresponder × heterozygous responder) 14 were responders. There was no evidence that this trait is sex-linked. This finding confirms the view that, in guinea pigs, development of an immune response to the aforementioned conjugates is a genetically transmitted autosomal, unigenic Mendelian dominant trait."

https://openalex.org/W2005069251,"Comparison of the survival times of homografts of BN skin on 3-day-old Lewis rats born of mothers of the same isogenic strain with those of BN grafts on infant Lewis hosts that had developed in an F(1) (Lewis x BN) hybrid, gave no evidence of maternally induced tolerance as a result of development in an antigenically alien environment. On the contrary, the significantly shorter median survival time of the grafts on the hybrid-derived Lewis group suggests that sensitization had occurred as a consequence of natural exposure during gestation to small numbers of maternal cells."

https://openalex.org/W2396573551,IN man there exists a large number of abnormal genetically determined haemoglobins. To our knowledge no abnormal haemoglobins are yet reported found in domestic animals. When investigating the haemoglobin phenotypes of experimental sheep with the technique of starch-gel electrophoresis an animal having atypical haemoglobin was found.
https://openalex.org/W2026800011,"In Cryptochiton stelleri (Polyplacophora), variation in the size of the glandular oviduct parallels the cyclic variation in the size of the gonad. In Katharina tunicata the digestive gland reaches its maximum size in the fall then decreases to a minimum size in the spring when the gonad is at its maximum size. These variations are not due to changes in the water content of the glandular oviduct and digestive gland."

https://openalex.org/W2058070520,"Gyllensten and Malmfors1 examined inter alia the cross-sectional area and myelinated fibre distribution of the optic nerve in mice reared in the light or in the dark. In mice reared in complete darkness for 20 and 30 days, delay in myelination of the optic nerve fibres caused a reduction in the number of myelinated fibres of some 12 per cent. The number of larger fibres was affected to a greater extent than the number of smaller ones. At 20 days the cross-sectional area of the optic nerve was reduced by 3.4 per cent and at 30 days it was increased by 0.4 per cent; this was said to be insignificant. This latter finding prompts me to report some preliminary observations and a new experimental technique for light deprivation."

https://openalex.org/W2057884948,"IT is known that many proteolytic enzymes—trypsin, chymotrypsin, thrombin, papain and others—hydrolyse peptide, amide and ester bonds. Pepsin, however, is generally believed to hydrolyse the peptide bonds only, without exhibiting the esterase activity1. This conclusion is based on observations which suggest that pepsin does not hydrolyse the ester bonds in several esters of N-substituted amino-acids and peptides, but no special investigation of the esterase activity of pepsin has been published."

https://openalex.org/W2024548490,"SEVERAL examples have recently been reported of the partial or complete recovery of the native conformation and the biological activity of a protein following the reduction of all disulphide bridges under strongly denaturing conditions, such as 8 M urea or 5 M guanidine hydrochloride. The examples include insulin1, ribonuclease2, lysozyme3, and pepsinogen4. In each case the recovery was induced by removing the reducing agent and denaturing solvent and allowing the disulphide bridges to re-form spontaneously through re-oxidation of sulphydryl groups by atmospheric oxygen."

https://openalex.org/W2052380134,"THE mesoionic 1,3,4-thiadiazoles, I, were first reported by Busch1, who assigned a bicyclic structure to the compounds. Schoenberg2 later re-examined the structure of Busch and offered a resonance hybrid structure, now accepted as being typical of a large group of heterocycles described as being mesoionic3. We became interested in the mesoionic 1,3,4-thiadiazoles as a natural extension of our interest in the pharmacology and pharmaceutical chemistry of the sydnones II4–7. It occurred to us that since the two ring systems are isoelectronic (that is, being mesoionic they both possess an aromatic, positively charged, 5-membered ring, and a balancing negative charge on an exocyclic atom) the possibility might exist that the two ring systems could also be bioisosteric. That is, the ring itself may behave as a pharmacologically active functional group and that this already expressde similarity between the ring systems may impart similar pharmacological activity. A more conservative speculation would be that perhaps the mesoionic 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring system would have some prominent pharmacological activity."
https://openalex.org/W1991294673,"In blood smears of a cockroach a small cell occurs which is frequently paired with a larger anucleate cytoplasmic body. The larger body in such pairs is free of nucleic acid, but contains polysaccharides, as demonstrated by the periodic acid-Schiff reaction. At one extreme of a series of these associations, the cell is completely distinct from the cytoplasmic body. At the other extreme the nucleus of the cell is within and apparently a part of the larger body. A graded series of pairs suggests a mechanism resembling phagocytosis in which the cytoplasmic body either gains or regains cell status by retaining the nucleus of the ingested member."

https://openalex.org/W2026037915,"IN the past few years, oxygen equilibria of various normal and abnormal adult human haemoglobin types have been studied. No differences were observed between normal Hb-A (&α2β2) and the β-chain abnormalities Hb-S (ref. 1), Hb-C (ref. 2) and Hb-E (ref. 3). Investigations of the isolated Hb-A2′ (α2δ2) and its abnormal variant Hb-A2 revealed a considerable increase in oxygen affinity when compared with normal Hb-A (ref. 4). Hb-Lepore, which is composed of normal α-chains and ‘β’ chains being related to the β-chain of Hb-A as well as to the δ-chain of Hb-A2 (ref. 5), showed a high affinity for molecular oxygen similar to that of Hb-A2 (ref. 1). The affinities of the α-chain lacking abnormal haemoglobin types Hb-H (β4) and Hb-Bart's (γ4) for molecular oxygen were found to be extremely high, while no Bohr effect or haem–haem interactions were detectable6,7."

https://openalex.org/W1971980864,"THE proceedings of the first World Conference on Histone Biology and Chemistry were summarized in a recent article by Bonner and Ts'o1. Part of the reported discussion dealt with the probable relationship between DNA replication and histone synthesis. It was pointed out that 5-fluorodeoxyuridine blocks DNA synthesis but allows the synthesis of histone to proceed in an essentially normal manner. This evidence was cited to support the view that DNA replication and histone synthesis are not necessarily coupled although they usually accompany one another. Similar conclusions have been reached by Plaut2, who investigated the pattern of nucleoprotein synthesis in Drosophila polytene chromosomes by means of the pulse-labelling technique. He found that the labelling patterns resulting from brief exposures to tritiated precursors of DNA (H3 thymidine) and protein (H3 lysine, H3 histidine) were distinctly different. In summary, DNA labelling was often restricted to certain sites along the chromosome, while protein labelling was found to be more or less continuous. The present report, based on the results of cytophotometric investigations, furnishes further evidence in support of the view that DNA replication and histone synthesis may not be coupled."

Therefore, metabolic inhibitors such as cyanides modify these exchanges between cell and surrounding medium by decreasing Na+ efflux and K+ influx."

There is evidence that thyroid activity varies during the œestrous cycle, with maximal activity during œestrus2–4. Thyroidectomized cows failed to show physical signs of heat1,5. A low level of protein-bound iodine in the blood of infertile cows has also been demonstrated6. The levels of thyroid and thyrotrophic hormones in the blood of Friesian cows during œestrous cycle as compared to those affected with ovarian inactivity and cystic ovaries have been investigated as follows."
