The ratio is (1.6 +/- 0.2) x 10(-2). The hundredfold enrichment of deuterium means that at least 0.3 percent of a terrestrial ocean was outgassed on Venus, but is consistent with a much greater production."
https://openalex.org/W1992753487,"The difference in the stable sulfur isotope ratios of sulfate and sulfide in marsh pore water was used to verify the uptake of hydrogen sulfide by the salt marsh cordgrass Spartina alterniflora in a North Carolina salt marsh. Most of the plant sulfur derived from pore-water sulfide was recovered as sulfate, an indication that the sulfide had been oxidized within the plant. The analysis of the sulfur isotope ratios of other coastal halophytes may be a useful technique for determining whether sulfide is taken up by plants in saline wetlands."

The structures observed show radial gaps, segmentation, irregular patterns within concentric rings, add the formation of spiral precipitation bands instead of sets of parallel Lisegang bands."
https://openalex.org/W2011770845,"A nearly complete skeleton of early Eocene Diacodexis, the oldest known member of the mammalian order Artiodactyla, is described. Its slender, elongate limb elements indicate that Diacodexis was highly cursorial and closer in postcranial adaptations to tragulids and other primitive ruminants than to living or extinct nonruminant artiodactyls. Its skeletal specializations call into question the widespread notion that Diacodexis was the ancestor of all later artiodactyls."
https://openalex.org/W2014705497,High calcium ion and low magnesium ion concentrations in sediment pore waters in cores from the Galápagos Mounds Hydrothermal Field on the flank of the Galápagos Spreading Center are believed to be due to a calcium-magnesium exchange reaction between circulating seawater and basement basalt. The nonlinearity of the calcium ion and magnesium ion gradients indicates that these discharging hydrothermal solutions on the ridge flank are upwelling at the rate of about 1 centimeter per year through the pelagic sediments of the Mounds Field and at about 20 centimeters per year through the hydrothermal mounds themselves.
https://openalex.org/W1996723055,"A Vendian (Late Proterozoic Z) age has been determined for the Boston Basin by comparison of a microflora from the Cambridge Argillite with other late Precambrian assemblages. The microfossils, which include Bavlinella cf. faveolata, are preserved as petrifactions in pyrite. This age designation for the sedimentary rocks of the Boston Basin should allow for the reinterpretation of the structure of the basin and its regional correlations."
https://openalex.org/W1981563700,"The surface temperature effects of the 18 May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Volcano were examinedfor 1 day immediately after the eruption; 24-hour temperature differences and Model Output Statistics errors as well as the detailed temporal evolution of surface temperature at selected stations were used. During the daytime hours immediately after the eruption, the temperature was suppressed by the volcanic plume by as much as 8 degrees C. That night, low-level volcanic dust produced temperature enhancements of up to 8 degrees C. These effects quickly diminished the next day as the volcanic dust cloud dissipated and moved toward the east. The net local effect of the eruption appears to be warming, in contrast to cooling which might be expected over climatic time scales."
https://openalex.org/W2009188673,"An Upper Paleolithic site with blade technology was excavated at Nazlet Khater, Egypt. Radiocarbon dates center around 31,500 years ago, indicating that the Egyptian Nile Valley was not an isolated enclave where blade technology appeared late in comparison with other eastern Mediterranean areas. This site fills a gap in the record of human history in Egypt between 40,000 and 20,000 years ago."
https://openalex.org/W4246643488,"During the decade following Dam's first observations on the hemorrhagic syndrome the combined efforts of several groups of investigators have solved many of the important problems connected with the new vitamin. Sources of vitamin K were discovered, methods of extraction and purification devised, the isolation effected, the structure of K(1) worked out and then verified by synthesis, and a promising start made on the therapeutic applications. In addition, simple water soluble compounds with antihemorrhagic properties have been supplied for clinical work. Preliminary results with these compounds are encouraging."
https://openalex.org/W2031034344,Current observational knowledge bearing on the evolution of elliptical and disk galaxies is reviewed. Particular emphasis is placed on identifying the factors that appear common to all galaxies of a particular type as opposed to those that seem to depend on environmental conditions. The success of various classes of galactic formation and evolution models used to confront these data is evaluated.

https://openalex.org/W1974218813,"Oil-importing developing countries will need more energy during the 1980's to sustain development and to support their subsistence sectors. Development plans must be revised to reflect the potentially disastrous effects of high-cost oil on foreign exchange reserves and on national indebtedness. Energy use efficiency must be increased, and wider use must be made of domestic sources of energy-of conventional fossil and hydro sources and of new and renewable options such as biomass and other solar resources. The international community can help by careful management of world financial flows and trade agreements, expansion of capital assistance, and provision of technical assistance. The importance of improving levels of scientific and technical expertise in the less-developed countries is a challege to the worldwide scientific and engineering community."
