Synaptic vesicles are loaded with neurotransmitter by means of specific vesicular transporters. Here we show that expression of BNPI, a vesicle-bound transporter associated with sodium-dependent phosphate transport, results in glutamate uptake by intracellular vesicles. Substrate specificity and energy dependence are very similar to glutamate uptake by synaptic vesicles. Stimulation of exocytosis--fusion of the vesicles with the cell membrane and release of their contents--resulted in quantal release of glutamate from BNPI-expressing cells. Furthermore, we expressed BNPI in neurons containing GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) and maintained them as cultures of single, isolated neurons that form synapses to themselves. After stimulation of these neurons, a component of the postsynaptic current is mediated by glutamate as it is blocked by a combination of the glutamate receptor antagonists, but is insensitive to a GABA(A) receptor antagonist. We conclude that BNPI functions as vesicular glutamate transporter and that expression of BNPI suffices to define a glutamatergic phenotype in neurons."

https://openalex.org/W2120753520,"Insulin stimulates the transport of glucose into fat and muscle cells. Although the precise molecular mechanisms involved in this process remain uncertain, insulin initiates its actions by binding to its tyrosine kinase receptor, leading to the phosphorylation of intracellular substrates. One such substrate is the Cbl protooncogene product1. Cbl is recruited to the insulin receptor by interaction with the adapter protein CAP, through one of three adjacent SH3 domains in the carboxy terminus of CAP2. Upon phosphorylation of Cbl, the CAP–Cbl complex dissociates from the insulin receptor and moves to a caveolin-enriched, triton-insoluble membrane fraction3. Here, to identify a molecular mechanism underlying this subcellular redistribution, we screened a yeast two-hybrid library using the amino-terminal region of CAP and identified the caveolar protein flotillin. Flotillin forms a ternary complex with CAP and Cbl, directing the localization of the CAP–Cbl complex to a lipid raft subdomain of the plasma membrane. Expression of the N-terminal domain of CAP in 3T3-L1 adipocytes blocks the stimulation of glucose transport by insulin, without affecting signalling events that depend on phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase. Thus, localization of the Cbl–CAP complex to lipid rafts generates a pathway that is crucial in the regulation of glucose uptake."

https://openalex.org/W1963804798,"The Drosophila retina is patterned by a morphogenetic wave driven by the Hedgehog signaling protein. Hedgehog, secreted by the first neurons, induces neuronal differentiation and hedgehog expression in nearby uncommitted cells, thereby propagating the wave. Evidence is presented here that the zebrafish Hedgehog homolog, Sonic Hedgehog, is also expressed in the first retinal neurons, and that Sonic Hedgehog drives a wave of neurogenesis across the retina, strikingly similar to the wave in Drosophila . The conservation of this patterning mechanism is unexpected, given the highly divergent structures of vertebrate and invertebrate eyes, and supports a common evolutionary origin of the animal visual system."

Evidence exists that these metabolites affect renal function and, in particular, blood pressure regulation. To examine this possibility, blood pressure and renal arachidonic acid metabolism were examined in mice with a targeted disruption of the soluble epoxide hydrolase gene. Systolic blood pressure of male soluble epoxide hydrolase-null mice was lower compared with wild-type mice in both the absence and presence of dietary salt loading. Both female soluble epoxide hydrolase-null and wild-type female mice also had significantly lower systolic blood pressure than male wild-type mice. Renal formation of epoxyeicosatrienoic and dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids was markedly lower for soluble epoxide hydrolase-null versus wild-type mice of both sexes. Although disruption of soluble epoxide hydrolase in female mice had minimal effects on blood pressure, deletion of this gene feminized male mice by lowering systolic blood pressure and altering arachidonic acid metabolism.

CYP-dependent metabolism of AA (Fig. 1) generates three primary classes of metabolites: mid-chain cis-trans-conjugated dienols (5-, 8-, 9-, 11-, 12- and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs)); ω-terminal alcohols (16- through 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids); and, cis-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15 epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs)) (13Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Harris R.C. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 163-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EETs have been shownin vitro to be efficiently hydrated to their corresponding dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) by sEH (5Zeldin D.C. Kobayashi J. Falck J.R. Winder B.S. Hammock B.D. Snapper J.R.

Most notably, evidence exists for a role of these AA metabolites as modulators of salt and water regulation by the kidney (9Capdevila J.H. Wei S. Yan J. Karara A. Jacobson H.R. Falck J.R.

Biol. 1997; 407: 255-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, studies of the isolated perfused rabbit kidney (18Carroll M.A. Balazy M. Margiotta P. Falck J.R. McGiff J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12260-12266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that 5,6-, 8,9-, and 11,12-EET are vasodilators of the renal microcirculation. Other studies demonstrated that 8,9-EET is a vasoconstrictor of the rat renal artery (19Katoh T. Takahashi K. Capdevila J. Karara A. Falck J.R. Jacobson H.R. Badr K.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F578-F586PubMed Google Scholar) and that 11,12-EET is a potent vasodilator of the preglomerular vasculature of rat kidney (20Imig J.D. Navar L.G. Roman R.J. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 2364-2370PubMed Google Scholar). The demonstrated abilities of EETs to directly activate smooth muscle K+ channels (21Hu S. Kim H.S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 230: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and to inhibit the renal Na+-K+-ATPase (22Satoh T. Cohen H.T. Katz A.I. J. Clin.

Biol. 1996; 152: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) are potential mechanisms by which the vasodilatory and antihypertensive actions of EETs may be achieved. In the rabbit cortical collecting duct, 14,15-DHET is a potent inhibitor of vasopressin-stimulated water reabsorption (24Hirt D.L. Capdevila J. Falck J.R. Breyer M.D. Jacobson H.R. J. Clin.

Physiol. 1987; 253: F464-F470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dietary salt loading of rats causes increased urinary excretion of EETs and DHETs concomitant with induction of renal CYP-dependent epoxygenase activity (9Capdevila J.H. Wei S. Yan J. Karara A.

Capdevila J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2414-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Furthermore, administration of the CYP inhibitor clotrimazole decreased EETs excretion and was associated with an increase of blood pressure. Thus, experimental evidence supports a role for CYP- and sEH-dependent metabolites of AA in blood pressure regulation by virtue of their influence on renal hemodynamics and natriuresis.In this study, the importance of sEH for blood pressure regulation was examined. Mice with a targeted disruption of the sEH gene were produced and compared with wild-type littermates with respect to systolic blood pressure, pulse, and renal AA metabolism in the presence and absence of dietary salt loading. We demonstrate that sEHdeletion is associated with decreased blood pressure, indicating for the first time that sEH expression levels are an important determinant of blood pressure in vivo. Evidence is also presented to support that aberrant renal AA metabolism is an important determinant of the effects of sEH deletion on blood pressure regulation. Importantly, these results identify sEH as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in hypertension.DISCUSSIONTwo distinct mammalian epoxide hydrolases with differing substrate selectivities have been identified. The microsomal form, mEH, plays a pivotal role in the protection against the toxicity of a diverse group of highly reactive epoxide intermediates of xenobiotic metabolism (1Argiriadi M.A. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Christianson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10637-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 30Seidegard J. Ekstrom G. Environ. Health Perspect. 1997; 105 (Suppl. 4): 791-799PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, gene targeting studies have demonstrated that mEH is a key determinant in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene carcinogenesis by virtue of its role in the production of the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite (27Miyata M. Kudo G. Lee Y.H. Yang T.J. Gelboin H.V. Fernandez-Salguero P. Kimura S. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23963-23968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Although sEH is also capable of metabolizing xenobiotic epoxides to their corresponding diols (2Grant D.F. Storms D.H. Hammock B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17628-17633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Grant D.F. Greene J.F. Pinot F. Borhan B. Moghaddam M.F. Hammock B.D. McCutchen B. Ohkawa H. Luo G. Guenthner T.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), its ability to efficiently hydrate endogenous fatty acid epoxides (4Borhan B. Mebrahtu T. Nazarian S. Kurth M.J. Hammock B.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 5Zeldin D.C. Kobayashi J. Falck J.R. Winder B.S. Hammock B.D. Snapper J.R. Capdevila J.H. J. Biol.

The data presented in this study support a physiological function for sEH. For example,sEH-null mice exhibit markedly reduced rates of EETs conversion to DHETs, demonstrating the quantitative importance of sEH for normal AA metabolism in the liver and kidney. Furthermore, malesEH-null mice also exhibited reduced SBP compared with sex matched, wild-type littermate controls, thus establishing the importance of this enzyme in blood pressure regulation.Dahl salt-sensitive rats respond to high dietary salt by the development of hypertension, whereas Dahl salt-resistant counterparts remain normotensive (34Rapp J.P. Hypertension. 1982; 4: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In addition, Dahl salt-sensitive but not Dahl salt-resistant rats exhibit increased renal AA epoxygenase activity in response to dietary salt loading (26Makita K. Takahashi K. Karara A. Jacobson H.R. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2414-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Similarly, Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats respond to excess dietary salt by induction of renal AA epoxygenase activity and increased output of urinary AA epoxygenase metabolites (9Capdevila J.H. Wei S. Yan J. Karara A. Jacobson H.R. Falck J.R. Guengerich F.P. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21720-21726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas clotrimazole inhibition of renal CYP-dependent AA epoxygenase activity produces a clotrimazole-dependent, salt-sensitive hypertension in rats (26Makita K. Takahashi K. Karara A. Jacobson H.R. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2414-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that renal AA epoxygenase activity is also increased during the developmental phase of hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat model of hypertension (35Yu Z. Huse L.M. Adler P. Graham L. Ma J. Zeldin D.C. Kroetz D.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1011-1020PubMed Google Scholar). Among the biological activities attributed to EETs in the kidney are inhibition of Na+ transport in proximal tubule (15Romero M.F. Madhun Z.T. Hopfer U. Douglas J.G. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukot. Res. 1991; 21: 205-208Google Scholar), inhibition of Na+ reabsorption, K+ secretion and vasopressin-induced water flow in the collecting duct (15Romero M.F. Madhun Z.T. Hopfer U. Douglas J.G. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukot. Res. 1991; 21: 205-208Google Scholar, 24Hirt D.L. Capdevila J. Falck J.R. Breyer M.D. Jacobson H.R. J. Clin.

Biochem. 1991; 14: 199-207PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of renal Na+-K+-ATPase (22Satoh T. Cohen H.T. Katz A.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 23Ominato M. Satoh T. Katz A.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 152: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), as well as vasodilation and activation of K+ channels of renal vascular smooth muscle (18Carroll M.A. Balazy M. Margiotta P. Falck J.R. McGiff J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12260-12266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hu S. Kim H.S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 230: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with these published studies, which strongly suggest a critical role for renal CYP-dependent AA epoxygenase metabolism in the regulation of blood pressure. sEH-null mice exhibited reduced renal production of DHETs and a concomitant increase in the rate of EETs formation. Given that the balance of evidence favors an antihypertensive role for EETs, it is not surprising that malesEH-null mice also exhibit lower SBP compared with wild-type male mice. However, because a dramatic reduction in the rate of renal DHETs production was also evident, diminution of the hypertensive effects of one or more DHETs metabolites is equally possible. It is important to note that these data cannot directly implicate EETs or DHETs in the reduced blood pressure phenotype of sEH-null male mice. Indeed, it remains a possibility that these compounds act indirectly after further metabolism by other enzymes such as cyclooxygenase (19Katoh T. Takahashi K. Capdevila J. Karara A. Falck J.R. Jacobson H.R. Badr K.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F578-F586PubMed Google Scholar) or by stimulating the synthesis of vasoactive prostaglandins (14Sakairi Y. Jacobson H.R. Noland T.D. Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Breyer M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F931-F939PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the effect of sEH deletion on SBP may be entirely independent of renal AA metabolism. However, our data demonstrate very clearly that sEH deletion is associated with decreased SBP in male mice concomitant with changes in renal AA metabolism. Although it is very likely that these two phenomena are causally linked, definitive direct proof of linkage requires further study.Dietary slat loading did not cause a significant increase of SBP or renal EETs formation for any of the groups studied. Thus, we were unable to assess the importance of sEH in salt-induced hypertension, a response known to be strain-dependent in rats (37Ma Y.H. Schwartzman M.L. Roman R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: R579-R589PubMed Google Scholar, 38Stec D.E. Trolliet M.R. Krieger J.E. Jacob H.J. Roman R.J. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 1329-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, dietary salt loading did more clearly define the particularly intriguing finding of a gender-dependent effect ofsEH deletion. Although sEH-null male mice had lower SBP than did male wild-type mice, sEH-null female mice did not differ significantly from female wild-type mice. MalesEH-null mice most closely resembled female null and female wild-type mice with respect to SBP, particularly with dietary salt loading. The expression of sEH mRNA and protein was also markedly lower in female versus male wild-type mouse kidney. These data provide important corroboration of the importance of sEH in blood pressure regulation, because the lower SBP of female mice and malesEH-null mice was associated with reduced renalsEH expression. In essence, sEH deletion had the effect of feminizing male mice with respect to SBP. Female renal AA metabolism appeared to produce less EETs compared with males as indicated by the lower rate of DHETs formation by femaleversus male wild-type mice; the apparent complete conversion of all EETs to DHETs by both sexes of wild-type mice; and the much lower rate of renal EETs formation by female versus malesEH-null mice. These data are more consistent with a hypertensive role for DHETs rather than an antihypertensive role for EETs. However, as mentioned previously, causal linkage between the aberrant renal metabolism and lower SBP caused by sEHdeletion requires further study.In summary, the data presented in this study identify an important role for sEH-dependent AA metabolism in renal function and control of blood pressure regulation. Although the importance of sEH in female mice remains uncertain, sEHdeletion was clearly associated with a significant decrease of renal DHETs formation from EETs and a significantly lower blood pressure in male mice. Consistent with the data in this report, sEH has been identified as the major contributor to EETs hydrolysis in human liver (31Zeldin D.C. Moomaw C.R. Jesse N. Tomer K.B. Beetham J. Hammock B.D. Wu S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Furthermore, increased urinary excretion of AA epoxygenase metabolites during pregnancy-induced hypertension has been documented (39Catella F. Lawson J.A. Fitzgerald D.J. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5893-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, further study of sEH-dependent AA metabolism in human kidney and its importance to blood pressure regulation warrants investigation. Given that sEH deletion had no discernible detrimental effects on the health and viability of null mice, inhibition of renal sEH represents a potentially attractive means of pharmacological intervention in hypertension. The development and use of such compounds to achieve selective sEH inhibition in vivo has been demonstrated by Hammock and co-workers (40Morisseau C. Goodrow M.H. Dowdy D. Zheng J. Greene J.F. Sanborn J.R. Hammock B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8849-8854Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A number of hypolipidemic compounds, which are also peroxisome proliferators, induce the expression of renal sEH (33Pinot F. Grant D.F. Spearow J.L. Parker A.G. Hammock B.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 41Loury D.N. Moody D.E. Kim B.W. Hammock B.D. Biochem.

Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This may have important implications in drug therapy, particularly for patients at risk for the development of hypertension. Identification of allelic variants that increase (i.e. gene duplications) or decrease (i.e. loss of function mutations)sEH expression and/or catalytic activity may also prove valuable for assessing risk of hypertension in humans. Mammalian soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH)1 is a cytosolic enzyme expressed in multiple tissues that catalyzes the conversion of a diverse group of epoxides to their corresponding diols (1Argiriadi M.A. Morisseau C.

Chem. 1993; 268: 17628-17633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The broad spectrum of xenobiotic epoxides metabolized by this enzyme suggests a role in the protection of cells against the potentially harmful effects of these compounds (3Grant D.F. Greene J.F.

However, sEH hydrates fatty acid epoxides most effectively, with epoxides of arachidonic acid (AA) being among the best substrates (4Borhan B. Mebrahtu T. Nazarian S. Kurth M.J. Hammock B.D. Anal.

This metabolism may result in the formation of metabolites with greater or less biological activity, indicating that sEH may have important physiological functions. Intracellular metabolism of AA by prostaglandin H2 synthase, lipoxygenases, and the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) monooxygenase system generates a number of metabolites, collectively termed eicosanoids, with important biological and cell signaling roles (7Imig J.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 120: 173-192PubMed Google Scholar, 8Spokas E.G. Rokach J. Wong P.Y. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 120: 213-247PubMed Google Scholar, 9Capdevila J.H. Wei S. Yan J. Karara A.

CYP-dependent metabolism of AA (Fig. 1) generates three primary classes of metabolites: mid-chain cis-trans-conjugated dienols (5-, 8-, 9-, 11-, 12- and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs)); ω-terminal alcohols (16- through 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids); and, cis-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15 epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs)) (13Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Harris R.C. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 163-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EETs have been shownin vitro to be efficiently hydrated to their corresponding dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) by sEH (5Zeldin D.C. Kobayashi J. Falck J.R. Winder B.S. Hammock B.D. Snapper J.R. Capdevila J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6402-6407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence exists for a variety of renal functions attributable to EETs and DHETs generated by CYP-dependent epoxygenase activity and sEH, respectively. Most notably, evidence exists for a role of these AA metabolites as modulators of salt and water regulation by the kidney (9Capdevila J.H. Wei S. Yan J. Karara A. Jacobson H.R. Falck J.R.

Biol. 1997; 407: 255-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, studies of the isolated perfused rabbit kidney (18Carroll M.A. Balazy M. Margiotta P. Falck J.R. McGiff J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12260-12266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that 5,6-, 8,9-, and 11,12-EET are vasodilators of the renal microcirculation. Other studies demonstrated that 8,9-EET is a vasoconstrictor of the rat renal artery (19Katoh T. Takahashi K. Capdevila J. Karara A. Falck J.R. Jacobson H.R. Badr K.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F578-F586PubMed Google Scholar) and that 11,12-EET is a potent vasodilator of the preglomerular vasculature of rat kidney (20Imig J.D. Navar L.G. Roman R.J. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 2364-2370PubMed Google Scholar). The demonstrated abilities of EETs to directly activate smooth muscle K+ channels (21Hu S. Kim H.S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 230: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and to inhibit the renal Na+-K+-ATPase (22Satoh T. Cohen H.T. Katz A.I. J. Clin.

Biol. 1996; 152: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) are potential mechanisms by which the vasodilatory and antihypertensive actions of EETs may be achieved. In the rabbit cortical collecting duct, 14,15-DHET is a potent inhibitor of vasopressin-stimulated water reabsorption (24Hirt D.L. Capdevila J. Falck J.R. Breyer M.D. Jacobson H.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1805-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and inhibits osmotic water flow in the toad urinary bladder (25Schlondorff D. Petty E. Oates J.A. Jacoby M. Levine S.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F464-F470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dietary salt loading of rats causes increased urinary excretion of EETs and DHETs concomitant with induction of renal CYP-dependent epoxygenase activity (9Capdevila J.H. Wei S. Yan J. Karara A.

Capdevila J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2414-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Furthermore, administration of the CYP inhibitor clotrimazole decreased EETs excretion and was associated with an increase of blood pressure. Thus, experimental evidence supports a role for CYP- and sEH-dependent metabolites of AA in blood pressure regulation by virtue of their influence on renal hemodynamics and natriuresis. In this study, the importance of sEH for blood pressure regulation was examined. Mice with a targeted disruption of the sEH gene were produced and compared with wild-type littermates with respect to systolic blood pressure, pulse, and renal AA metabolism in the presence and absence of dietary salt loading. We demonstrate that sEHdeletion is associated with decreased blood pressure, indicating for the first time that sEH expression levels are an important determinant of blood pressure in vivo. Evidence is also presented to support that aberrant renal AA metabolism is an important determinant of the effects of sEH deletion on blood pressure regulation. Importantly, these results identify sEH as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in hypertension. DISCUSSIONTwo distinct mammalian epoxide hydrolases with differing substrate selectivities have been identified. The microsomal form, mEH, plays a pivotal role in the protection against the toxicity of a diverse group of highly reactive epoxide intermediates of xenobiotic metabolism (1Argiriadi M.A. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Christianson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10637-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 30Seidegard J. Ekstrom G. Environ. Health Perspect. 1997; 105 (Suppl. 4): 791-799PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, gene targeting studies have demonstrated that mEH is a key determinant in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene carcinogenesis by virtue of its role in the production of the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite (27Miyata M. Kudo G. Lee Y.H. Yang T.J. Gelboin H.V. Fernandez-Salguero P. Kimura S. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23963-23968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Although sEH is also capable of metabolizing xenobiotic epoxides to their corresponding diols (2Grant D.F. Storms D.H. Hammock B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17628-17633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Grant D.F. Greene J.F. Pinot F. Borhan B. Moghaddam M.F. Hammock B.D. McCutchen B. Ohkawa H. Luo G. Guenthner T.M. Biochem.

The data presented in this study support a physiological function for sEH. For example,sEH-null mice exhibit markedly reduced rates of EETs conversion to DHETs, demonstrating the quantitative importance of sEH for normal AA metabolism in the liver and kidney. Furthermore, malesEH-null mice also exhibited reduced SBP compared with sex matched, wild-type littermate controls, thus establishing the importance of this enzyme in blood pressure regulation.Dahl salt-sensitive rats respond to high dietary salt by the development of hypertension, whereas Dahl salt-resistant counterparts remain normotensive (34Rapp J.P. Hypertension. 1982; 4: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In addition, Dahl salt-sensitive but not Dahl salt-resistant rats exhibit increased renal AA epoxygenase activity in response to dietary salt loading (26Makita K. Takahashi K. Karara A. Jacobson H.R. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2414-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Similarly, Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats respond to excess dietary salt by induction of renal AA epoxygenase activity and increased output of urinary AA epoxygenase metabolites (9Capdevila J.H. Wei S. Yan J. Karara A. Jacobson H.R. Falck J.R. Guengerich F.P. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21720-21726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas clotrimazole inhibition of renal CYP-dependent AA epoxygenase activity produces a clotrimazole-dependent, salt-sensitive hypertension in rats (26Makita K. Takahashi K. Karara A. Jacobson H.R. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2414-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that renal AA epoxygenase activity is also increased during the developmental phase of hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat model of hypertension (35Yu Z. Huse L.M. Adler P. Graham L. Ma J. Zeldin D.C. Kroetz D.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1011-1020PubMed Google Scholar). Among the biological activities attributed to EETs in the kidney are inhibition of Na+ transport in proximal tubule (15Romero M.F. Madhun Z.T. Hopfer U. Douglas J.G. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukot. Res. 1991; 21: 205-208Google Scholar), inhibition of Na+ reabsorption, K+ secretion and vasopressin-induced water flow in the collecting duct (15Romero M.F. Madhun Z.T. Hopfer U. Douglas J.G. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukot. Res. 1991; 21: 205-208Google Scholar, 24Hirt D.L. Capdevila J. Falck J.R. Breyer M.D. Jacobson H.R. J. Clin.

Biochem. 1991; 14: 199-207PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of renal Na+-K+-ATPase (22Satoh T. Cohen H.T. Katz A.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 23Ominato M. Satoh T. Katz A.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 152: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), as well as vasodilation and activation of K+ channels of renal vascular smooth muscle (18Carroll M.A. Balazy M. Margiotta P. Falck J.R. McGiff J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12260-12266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hu S. Kim H.S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 230: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with these published studies, which strongly suggest a critical role for renal CYP-dependent AA epoxygenase metabolism in the regulation of blood pressure. sEH-null mice exhibited reduced renal production of DHETs and a concomitant increase in the rate of EETs formation. Given that the balance of evidence favors an antihypertensive role for EETs, it is not surprising that malesEH-null mice also exhibit lower SBP compared with wild-type male mice. However, because a dramatic reduction in the rate of renal DHETs production was also evident, diminution of the hypertensive effects of one or more DHETs metabolites is equally possible. It is important to note that these data cannot directly implicate EETs or DHETs in the reduced blood pressure phenotype of sEH-null male mice. Indeed, it remains a possibility that these compounds act indirectly after further metabolism by other enzymes such as cyclooxygenase (19Katoh T. Takahashi K. Capdevila J. Karara A. Falck J.R. Jacobson H.R. Badr K.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F578-F586PubMed Google Scholar) or by stimulating the synthesis of vasoactive prostaglandins (14Sakairi Y. Jacobson H.R. Noland T.D. Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Breyer M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F931-F939PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the effect of sEH deletion on SBP may be entirely independent of renal AA metabolism. However, our data demonstrate very clearly that sEH deletion is associated with decreased SBP in male mice concomitant with changes in renal AA metabolism. Although it is very likely that these two phenomena are causally linked, definitive direct proof of linkage requires further study.Dietary slat loading did not cause a significant increase of SBP or renal EETs formation for any of the groups studied. Thus, we were unable to assess the importance of sEH in salt-induced hypertension, a response known to be strain-dependent in rats (37Ma Y.H. Schwartzman M.L. Roman R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: R579-R589PubMed Google Scholar, 38Stec D.E. Trolliet M.R. Krieger J.E. Jacob H.J. Roman R.J. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 1329-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, dietary salt loading did more clearly define the particularly intriguing finding of a gender-dependent effect ofsEH deletion. Although sEH-null male mice had lower SBP than did male wild-type mice, sEH-null female mice did not differ significantly from female wild-type mice. MalesEH-null mice most closely resembled female null and female wild-type mice with respect to SBP, particularly with dietary salt loading. The expression of sEH mRNA and protein was also markedly lower in female versus male wild-type mouse kidney. These data provide important corroboration of the importance of sEH in blood pressure regulation, because the lower SBP of female mice and malesEH-null mice was associated with reduced renalsEH expression. In essence, sEH deletion had the effect of feminizing male mice with respect to SBP. Female renal AA metabolism appeared to produce less EETs compared with males as indicated by the lower rate of DHETs formation by femaleversus male wild-type mice; the apparent complete conversion of all EETs to DHETs by both sexes of wild-type mice; and the much lower rate of renal EETs formation by female versus malesEH-null mice. These data are more consistent with a hypertensive role for DHETs rather than an antihypertensive role for EETs. However, as mentioned previously, causal linkage between the aberrant renal metabolism and lower SBP caused by sEHdeletion requires further study.In summary, the data presented in this study identify an important role for sEH-dependent AA metabolism in renal function and control of blood pressure regulation. Although the importance of sEH in female mice remains uncertain, sEHdeletion was clearly associated with a significant decrease of renal DHETs formation from EETs and a significantly lower blood pressure in male mice. Consistent with the data in this report, sEH has been identified as the major contributor to EETs hydrolysis in human liver (31Zeldin D.C. Moomaw C.R. Jesse N. Tomer K.B. Beetham J. Hammock B.D. Wu S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Furthermore, increased urinary excretion of AA epoxygenase metabolites during pregnancy-induced hypertension has been documented (39Catella F. Lawson J.A. Fitzgerald D.J. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5893-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, further study of sEH-dependent AA metabolism in human kidney and its importance to blood pressure regulation warrants investigation. Given that sEH deletion had no discernible detrimental effects on the health and viability of null mice, inhibition of renal sEH represents a potentially attractive means of pharmacological intervention in hypertension. The development and use of such compounds to achieve selective sEH inhibition in vivo has been demonstrated by Hammock and co-workers (40Morisseau C. Goodrow M.H. Dowdy D. Zheng J. Greene J.F. Sanborn J.R. Hammock B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8849-8854Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A number of hypolipidemic compounds, which are also peroxisome proliferators, induce the expression of renal sEH (33Pinot F. Grant D.F. Spearow J.L. Parker A.G. Hammock B.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 41Loury D.N. Moody D.E. Kim B.W. Hammock B.D. Biochem.

Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This may have important implications in drug therapy, particularly for patients at risk for the development of hypertension. Identification of allelic variants that increase (i.e. gene duplications) or decrease (i.e. loss of function mutations)sEH expression and/or catalytic activity may also prove valuable for assessing risk of hypertension in humans. Two distinct mammalian epoxide hydrolases with differing substrate selectivities have been identified. The microsomal form, mEH, plays a pivotal role in the protection against the toxicity of a diverse group of highly reactive epoxide intermediates of xenobiotic metabolism (1Argiriadi M.A. Morisseau C.

These data provide important corroboration of the importance of sEH in blood pressure regulation, because the lower SBP of female mice and malesEH-null mice was associated with reduced renalsEH expression. In essence, sEH deletion had the effect of feminizing male mice with respect to SBP. Female renal AA metabolism appeared to produce less EETs compared with males as indicated by the lower rate of DHETs formation by femaleversus male wild-type mice; the apparent complete conversion of all EETs to DHETs by both sexes of wild-type mice; and the much lower rate of renal EETs formation by female versus malesEH-null mice. These data are more consistent with a hypertensive role for DHETs rather than an antihypertensive role for EETs. However, as mentioned previously, causal linkage between the aberrant renal metabolism and lower SBP caused by sEHdeletion requires further study. In summary, the data presented in this study identify an important role for sEH-dependent AA metabolism in renal function and control of blood pressure regulation. Although the importance of sEH in female mice remains uncertain, sEHdeletion was clearly associated with a significant decrease of renal DHETs formation from EETs and a significantly lower blood pressure in male mice. Consistent with the data in this report, sEH has been identified as the major contributor to EETs hydrolysis in human liver (31Zeldin D.C. Moomaw C.R. Jesse N. Tomer K.B. Beetham J. Hammock B.D. Wu S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Furthermore, increased urinary excretion of AA epoxygenase metabolites during pregnancy-induced hypertension has been documented (39Catella F. Lawson J.A. Fitzgerald D.J. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5893-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, further study of sEH-dependent AA metabolism in human kidney and its importance to blood pressure regulation warrants investigation. Given that sEH deletion had no discernible detrimental effects on the health and viability of null mice, inhibition of renal sEH represents a potentially attractive means of pharmacological intervention in hypertension. The development and use of such compounds to achieve selective sEH inhibition in vivo has been demonstrated by Hammock and co-workers (40Morisseau C. Goodrow M.H. Dowdy D. Zheng J. Greene J.F. Sanborn J.R. Hammock B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8849-8854Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A number of hypolipidemic compounds, which are also peroxisome proliferators, induce the expression of renal sEH (33Pinot F. Grant D.F. Spearow J.L. Parker A.G. Hammock B.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 41Loury D.N. Moody D.E. Kim B.W. Hammock B.D. Biochem.

Identification of allelic variants that increase (i.e. gene duplications) or decrease (i.e. loss of function mutations)sEH expression and/or catalytic activity may also prove valuable for assessing risk of hypertension in humans.

But it was soon found that the critical current density Jc of the supercurrents that can pass through these polycrystalline materials without destroying superconductivity is remarkably small1,2. In many materials, Jc is suppressed at grain boundaries2,3,4, by phenomena such as interface charging and bending of the electronic band structure5,6,7,8,9. Partial replacement (‘doping’) of the yttrium in YBa2Cu3O7-δ with calcium has been used to increase grain-boundary Jc values substantially, but only at temperatures much lower than 77 K (ref. 9). Here we show that preferentially overdoping the grain boundaries, relative to the grains themselves, yields values of Jc at 77 K that far exceed previously published values. Our results indicate that grain-boundary doping is a viable approach for producing a practical, cost-effective superconducting power cable operating at liquid-nitrogen temperatures."

Recently, it was shown that tyrosine 1062 in RET represents a binding site for SHC adaptor proteins and is crucial for both RAS/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/AKT signaling pathways. In the present study, we characterized how these two pathways diverge from tyrosine 1062, using human neuroblastoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor cell lines expressing RET at high levels. In response to GDNF stimulation, SHC bound to GAB1 and GRB2 adaptor proteins as well as RET, and SHC and GAB1 were highly phosphorylated on tyrosine. The complex formation consisting of SHC, GAB1 and GRB2 was almost abolished by replacement of tyrosine 1062 in RET with phenylalanine. Tyrosine-phosphorylated GAB1 was also associated with p85 subunit of PI3-K, resulting in PI3-K and AKT activation, whereas SHC-GRB2-SOS complex was responsible for the RAS/ERK signaling pathway. These results suggested that the RAS and PI3-K pathways activated by GDNF bifurcate mainly through SHC bound to tyrosine 1062 in RET. Furthermore, using luciferase reporter-gene assays, we found that the RAS/ERK and PI3-K signaling pathways are important for activation of CREB and NF-kappaB in GDNF-treated cells, respectively.

There are two main pathways by which cholesterol is converted to bile acids (2Björkhem I. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 455-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Russell D.W. Setchell K.D.R.

The major pathway, also called the classic or neutral pathway, is initiated by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1),1located in the endoplasmic reticulum of liver cells. The alternate or acidic pathway is initiated by mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27), which is present not only in the liver but in extrahepatic organs as well, particularly the lungs (5Duane W.C.

The synthesis of bile acids via the classic pathway also involves sterol 27-hydroxylase, which facilitates oxidation of the steroid side chain (2Björkhem I. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 455-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Russell D.W. Setchell K.D.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4737-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency in humans results in a marked reduction in total bile acid synthesis, an increase in whole body cholesterol synthesis and the accumulation of cholestanol in tissues (8Salen G.

Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, the disease arising from this deficiency, is characterized by several conditions including accelerated atherosclerosis (11Björkhem I. Boberg K.M. Scrivner C.R.

In Cyp27knockout mice there is a dramatic reduction in total bile acid synthesis, but these animals do not develop cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (12Rosen H. Reshef A. Maeda N. Lippoldt A. Shpizen S.

First, there have been several recent discoveries relating to the mechanisms through which feedback regulation of bile acid synthesis is articulated via nuclear receptors (13Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1999; 10: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 14Del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. J. Biol.

Therefore, we wanted to study these mechanisms and related aspects of sterol metabolism in an animal model in which the rate of bile acid synthesis was impaired. Second, in our initial evaluation ofCyp27 −/− mice, we found that they were hypertriglyceridemic when maintained on a low fat, conventional rodent diet. This observation was potentially important because of earlier findings of an association between hepatic very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-triacylglycerol secretion and the rate of bile acid synthesis (17Beil U. Crouse J.R. Einarsson K. Grundy S.M. Metabolism. 1982; 31: 438-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Dobs A.S. Prasad M. Goldberg A. Guccione M. Hoover D.R. Cardiovasc.

Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Third, the measurement in vivo of the rate of sterol synthesis in the liver and major extrahepatic organs ofCyp27 −/− mice, represented a new, more quantitative approach to further investigating the putative role of 27-hydroxycholesterol as a regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis (20Lund E. Breuer O. Björkhem I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25092-25097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Esterman A.L. Baum H. Javitt N.B. Darlington G.J. J.

Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 738-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fourth, our initial investigation ofCyp27 −/− mice revealed that they had a significant enlargement of their livers and adrenal glands. Such organomegaly is not seen in mice that lack cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, but which retain a functional alternate pathway of bile acid synthesis (23Schwarz M. Russell D.W. Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The studies reported here show that sterol 27-hydroxylase plays a more global role in bodily lipid metabolism than has been documented previously. Surprisingly, the loss of the sterol 27-hydroxylase-initiated pathway of bile acid synthesis and the resultant marked compensatory increase in cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity is accompanied by dramatic changes in hepatic fatty acid metabolism and circulating plasma VLDL-triacylglycerol concentrations.RESULTSThe data in Table I show that although there was no difference in body weights of adult maleCyp27 −/− and Cyp27 +/+mice, there was a marked increase in the mass of the liver (40%) and adrenal glands (45%) in the Cyp27 −/− animals. When maintained on a conventional low fat, low cholesterol rodent diet, the Cyp27 −/− mice also manifest a 30% increase in plasma total cholesterol concentration and a 2-fold increase in plasma total triacylglycerol concentration. They maintained normal plasma levels of glucose, corticosterone, ACTH, and testosterone (Table II). In theCyp27 −/− mice the molar ratio of cholesterol in gallbladder bile was double that in theCyp27 +/+ controls. This was due to the fact that the biliary cholesterol concentration in these animals was unchanged, whereas the concentrations of bile acid and phospholipid fell significantly (Table II).Table IBody and organ weights in Cyp27+/+ and Cyp27−/− miceWeightGenotypeCyp27+/+Cyp27−/−Whole body (g)28 ± 1 (20)27 ± 1 (22)Liver (g)1.44 ± 0.03 (20)2.05 ± 0.04 (22) 1-aStatistically different from value for Cyp27 +/+ group (p < 0.05).Small intestine (g)1.16 ± 0.04 (5)1.05 ± 0.04 (5)Kidney (g)0.37 ± 0.01 (7)0.32 ± 0.01 (10) 1-aStatistically different from value for Cyp27 +/+ group (p < 0.05).Lung (g)0.16 ± 0.01 (7)0.15 ± 0.01 (5)Spleen (g)0.08 ± 0.01 (10)0.07 ± 0.01 (10)Adrenal (mg)4.2 ± 0.1 (14)6.1 ± 0.2 (14) 1-aStatistically different from value for Cyp27 +/+ group (p < 0.05).Brain (g)0.47 ± 0.01 (11)0.44 ± 0.01 (11) 1-aStatistically different from value for Cyp27 +/+ group (p < 0.05).Testis (g)0.25 ± 0.01 (10)0.23 ± 0.01 (10)Age-matched Cyp27+/+ and Cyp27−/−male mice were fed ad libitum a cereal-based rodent diet without added cholesterol.

Open table in a new tab Fractionation of pooled plasma by fast protein liquid chromatography (Fig. 1) showed that the increment in the cholesterol (Fig. 1 A) and triacylglycerol (Fig. 1 B) concentrations in the Cyp27 −/−mice was confined to VLDL. In contrast to the plasma cholesterol level, the concentration of cholesterol in most tissues, and in the whole animal, was the same in both genotypes (Figs. 2, A and B). There were two exceptions. One was the adrenal gland, which in theCyp27 −/− mice had not only a 48% higher concentration of cholesterol (Fig. 2 A), but also significant levels of two non-cholesterol sterols, the concentration of which totaled 9.8 ± 0.6 mg/g. These sterols, which were not detected in the adrenals of the Cyp27 +/+ mice, were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as the two forms of lathosterol (5α-cholest-7-en-3β-ol and 5α-cholest-8-en-3β-ol). The other exception was the lungs, which had a slightly reduced cholesterol concentration in the Cyp27 −/− mice (from 5.3 ± 0.1 to 4.7 ± 0.2 mg/g). Trace amounts of the two forms of lathosterol (about 4% of total tissue sterol content) were also found in lung tissue from theCyp27 −/− animals.

This analysis was done by determining the mRNA levels for each of the target proteins in concert with measuring enzyme activities and the rates of various metabolic processes associated with the expression of these proteins. The first set of data relate to various enzymes and receptors involved in regulating bile acid synthesis. As shown in Fig. 3, the Cyp27 −/−mice lacked sterol 27-hydroxylase, and manifest an ∼10-fold increase in the mRNA for cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). The expression of oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B1) in theCyp27 −/− mice was only 40% of that seen in the Cyp27 +/+ controls, whereas the expression of sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) was 2.4-fold higher in theCyp27 −/− animals. The expression of the small heterodimer partner (SHP) in the Cyp27 −/− mice was reduced to only 35% of that in the Cyp27 +/+controls, whereas the mRNA levels for both the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) showed a slight elevation in the Cyp27 −/− mice.The enzyme activity data shown in Fig. 4agree well with the RNA measurements shown in Fig. 3, as exemplified by the 5-fold increase in cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity in theCyp27 −/− mice (Fig. 4 A). Total bile acid synthesis in these mice, as measured by the rate of fecal bile acid excretion, averaged 47% of that in theCyp27 +/+ controls (Fig. 4 B). In these same Cyp27 −/− mice, bile acid pool size was only 27% of that in the Cyp27 +/+ mice (Fig. 4 C), and there was a marginal, but nonsignificant (p > 0.05), increase in the ratio of cholic to muricholic acid in the pool (Fig. 4 D). There was no discernible difference in the level of the apical sodium bile acid co-transporter protein in the ileum ofCyp27 −/− and Cyp27 +/+mice (data not shown). The marked contraction in bile acid pool size resulted in a dramatic reduction in the efficiency of intestinal cholesterol absorption (from 54 to 4%) (Fig. 4 E). This reduction in turn contributed to a 2.5-fold increase in fecal neutral sterol excretion in the Cyp27 −/− mice (Fig. 4 F). Although the concentration of bile acids in the gallbladder bile of Cyp27 −/− mice was only 37% of that in Cyp27 +/+ animals (Table II), the species of bile acid were similar in both genotypes with cholic acid predominating in both cases (data not shown).Figure 4Various parameters of bile acid metabolism and level of intestinal cholesterol absorption inCyp27 +/+ andCyp27 −/− mice. Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity (A), fecal bile acid excretion (B), bile acid pool size (C), and composition (D), intestinal cholesterol absorption (E), and fecal neutral sterol excretion (F) were measured inCyp27 +/+ and Cyp27 −/−male mice fed a basal rodent diet without added cholesterol as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In mice of both genotypes, cholic and muricholic together constituted more than 95% of bile acids in the intestinal pool (D). Fecal neutral sterols consisted of cholesterol and its derivatives, coprostanol, epicoprostanol, and cholestanone (F). Values represent the mean ± 1 S.E. of data from 5 Cyp27 +/+ and 7 Cyp27 −/− mice, respectively, for all parameters except fecal bile acid excretion in which case measurements were made in 10 Cyp27 +/+ and 12Cyp27 −/− mice, respectively. *,p < 0.05 compared with value forCyp27 +/+ animals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The marked increase in plasma VLDL-triacylglycerol concentrations in the Cyp27 −/− mice prompted us to investigate the level of expression of several key enzymes involved in hepatic fatty acid metabolism. As shown in the first panel of Fig. 5, there was a 50% increase in the mRNA level of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), which preferentially activates transcription of genes encoding the enzymes of fatty acid synthesis. Consistent with this change were 1.7- and 2.5-fold increases in the expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase, respectively. There was also a 3.7-fold increase in the mRNA level for steroyl-CoA desaturase, which catalyzes the conversion of stearic to oleic acid. Although the expression of acyl-CoA synthase was unchanged, there was a 50% increase in the mRNA level for acyl-CoA oxidase.These northern analysis data are consistent with the various metabolic measurements described in Fig. 6. These show that in the Cyp27 −/− mice there was a 2.4-fold increase in hepatic triacylglycerol concentrations (Fig. 6 A), a 70% increase in hepatic fatty acid synthesis (Fig. 6 B), and a marked shift in hepatic fatty acid composition characterized by about a 70% increase in the proportion of oleic (18:1) to stearic acid (18:0) (Fig. 6 C). Together, the data in Figs. 5 and 6 reveal a major association between sterol 27-hydroxylase and hepatic fatty acid and triacylglycerol metabolism.Figure 6Hepatic triacylglycerol concentration, fatty acid synthesis, and fatty acid composition inCyp27 +/+ andCyp27 −/− mice. Cyp27 +/+ and Cyp27 −/−male mice that had been fed a basal rodent diet without added cholesterol were used either for the determination of hepatic triacylglycerol concentration (A) and fatty acid composition (C), or for the measurement of the rate of hepatic fatty acid synthesis (B) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values for each parameter represent the mean ± 1 S.E. of data from 10 mice of each genotype. *, p < 0.05 compared with value for +/+ animals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The remaining set of mRNA measurement data defines the levels of expression of enzymes involved in hepatic cholesterol synthesis, two of the receptors that facilitate the uptake and intrahepatic handling of lipoprotein cholesterol, and the liver X receptor α, a nuclear receptor that regulates the expression of several lipogenic enzymes (Fig. 7). The first panel shows a 50% increase in the expression of SREBP-2, which activates transcription of genes encoding the enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis. Consistent with this result was a 2.8- and 2.7-fold increase in the mRNA levels for HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA reductase, respectively. There was also a 50% increase in the expression of the LDL and high density lipoprotein (scavenger receptor, class B, type 1) receptors, but little change in the mRNA level for the liver X receptor α.Figure 7Relative amount of mRNA for SREBP-2, HMG CoA synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, and several lipoprotein receptors in the livers of Cyp27 +/+ andCyp27 −/− mice.

In theCyp27 −/− mice there were 4-fold increases in cholesterol synthesis in the liver and adrenal gland (Fig. 8 A). Significant increases in synthesis also occurred in the lung (2.9-fold), spleen (2.4-fold), and small intestine (1.8-fold). In contrast, there was little or no change in the rates of sterol synthesis in the other extrahepatic organs, including the residual carcass, which comprised mainly skin, muscle, adipose tissue, stomach, and large intestine. There was a trend toward lower rates of sterol synthesis in the kidneys of Cyp27 −/− mice. Summation of the rates of synthesis per whole organ (insetFig. 8 B) showed that whole animal sterol synthesis in theCyp27 −/− mice was 2.5-fold greater than in theCyp27 +/+ controls. About 90% of the increase in whole body synthesis was attributable to hepatic synthesis. In contrast to the variable effect of CYP27 deficiency on sterol synthesis in the extrahepatic organs, little or no change in the rates of fatty acid synthesis occurred in tissues such as the adrenal gland, lung, or small intestine (data not shown).Figure 8Tissue sterol synthesis in the liver and extrahepatic organs of Cyp27 +/+ andCyp27 −/− mice. The rate of sterol synthesis in the liver and extrahepatic organs ofCyp27 +/+ and Cyp27 −/−male mice fed a basal rodent diet without added cholesterol was measured in vivo as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The rates of synthesis expressed per g of tissue (A) were multiplied by respective whole organ weights to obtain whole organ synthesis rates normalized per 100 g body weight (B). These whole organ rates were added to give values for whole animal sterol synthesis per 100 g body weight (inset of B). Values represent the mean ± 1 S.E. of data from 4 to 7 mice of each genotype for all organs except the liver in which case measurements were made in 9Cyp27 +/+ and 9Cyp27 −/−mice.

When fed only the basal diet,Cyp27 +/+ and Cyp27 −/−mice had 5.2 ± 0.2 (n = 7) and 7.2 ± 0.2 (n = 9) g of liver per 100 g of body weight, respectively. However, in matching Cyp27 −/−mice fed a diet supplemented with cholic acid for 10 days, relative liver weight contracted significantly to 5.9 ± 0.1 g/100 g of body weight. In contrast, adrenal gland enlargement was not reversed by cholic acid feeding. Thus, on the basal diet, theCyp27 +/+ and Cyp27 −/−mice had 14.4 ± 0.7 (n = 5) and 22.8 ± 1.3 (n = 5) mg of adrenal/100 g of body weight, respectively. In the cholic acid-fed Cyp27 −/−mice this value remained at 22.8 ± 1.6 (n = 5) mg/100 g of body weight. The hepatomegaly in theCyp27 −/− mice was also almost fully reversed when chenodeoxycholic acid was fed in place of cholic acid (data not shown).The metabolic effects of cholic acid supplementation in theCyp27 −/− mice are shown in Fig. 9. This treatment restored intestinal cholesterol absorption to normal levels (Fig. 9 A), and suppressed the rate of sterol synthesis in the adrenal gland (Fig. 9 B) and liver (Fig. 9 C) to values significantly below those seen in Cyp27 +/+ mice fed the basal diet alone. Cholic acid supplementation also essentially normalized hepatic fatty acid synthesis (Fig. 9 D), and triacylglycerol concentrations in both the liver (Fig. 9 E) and plasma (Fig. 9 F) of the Cyp27 −/− mice.Figure 9Various parameters of sterol and triacylglycerol meta"
https://openalex.org/W2131716450,"When DNA replication is inhibited during the synthesis (S) phase of the cell cycle, a signaling pathway (checkpoint) is activated that serves to prevent mitosis from initiating before completion of replication. This replication checkpoint acts by down-regulating the activity of the mitotic inducer cdc2-cyclin B. Here, we report the relation between chromatin structure and induction of the replication checkpoint. Chromatin was competent to initiate a checkpoint response only after the DNA was unwound and DNA polymerase alpha had been loaded. Checkpoint induction did not require new DNA synthesis on the unwound template strand but did require RNA primer synthesis by primase. These findings identify the RNA portion of the primer as an important component of the signal that activates the replication checkpoint."

It mediates selective uptake of lipoprotein lipid and stimulates efflux of [3H]cholesterol to lipoproteins. SR-BI-mediated [3H]cholesterol efflux was proposed to be independent of ligand binding. In this study, using anti-mSR-BI antibody KKB-1 and two mSR-BI mutants with altered ligand binding properties, we demonstrated that SR-BI-mediated [3H]cholesterol efflux to lipoproteins was correlated with ligand binding and lipid uptake activities of the receptor. The KKB-1 antibody, which blocked lipoprotein binding without substantially altering the cholesterol oxidase-accessible cellular [3H]cholesterol, also blocked [3H]cholesterol efflux to HDL and LDL. One of the SR-BI mutants, which has a double substitution of arginines for glutamines at positions 402 and 418 (Q402R/Q418R), exhibited a high level of LDL binding and lipid uptake from LDL, but lost most of the corresponding HDL receptor activity. This mutant could mediate efficient [3H]cholesterol efflux to LDL, but not to HDL.

This mutant could mediate efficient [3H]cholesterol efflux to AcLDL, but not to HDL or LDL. These results suggest that SR-BI-stimulated [3H]cholesterol efflux to lipoproteins critically depends on ligand binding to this receptor and raise the possibility that the mechanisms of selective lipid uptake and [3H]cholesterol efflux may be intimately related.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 781-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first step in reverse cholesterol transport is the efflux of free cholesterol from peripheral tissues to extracellular lipoprotein acceptors. A standard approach for measuring cholesterol efflux has been labeling cultured cells with [3H]cholesterol and then measuring transfer of the label into culture medium with or without a suitable acceptor (e.g. serum, purified lipoproteins, phospholipid vesicles, etc.) (3Rothblat G. Bamberger M. Philips M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 628-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 4Oram J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 645-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The efflux efficiency of serum is closely associated with its α-lipoprotein content, and both HDL1 and lipid-free apoA-I can function as acceptors in in vitro efflux assays (reviewed in Ref. 2Rothblat G.H. de la Llera-Moya M. Atger V. Kellner-Weibel G. Williams D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 781-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In most of the studies using HDL and serum as acceptors, it is likely that the movement of cholesterol was bidirectional (into as well as out of the cells) (2Rothblat G.H. de la Llera-Moya M.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 781-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), even though only efflux of labeled cholesterol was measured. The molecular mechanisms underlying [3H]cholesterol efflux studied in cultured cell assays and cholesterol transport in vivo have not yet been defined in detail, and their precise relationships remain to be demonstrated. The mechanisms of lipid-free apoA-I- and HDL particle-mediated cholesterol efflux are not identical. Lipid-free apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux is unidirectional, resulting in the net loss of cellular cholesterol and phospholipid (5Gillotte K.L. Davidson W.S. Lund-Katz S. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1918-1928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Important insights into this mechanism have come from studies of Tangier disease. Subjects with homozygous Tangier disease exhibit an almost complete absence of plasma HDL and the accumulation of cholesteryl ester in many tissues (see reviews in Refs. 6Oram J.F. Yokoyama S.J. J.

Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). SR-BI, a member of the CD36 superfamily of proteins, plays a key role in HDL and cholesterol metabolism as a receptor mediating selective cholesterol uptake (influx) from HDL to cells (14Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). Tall and co-workers (18Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. Moya M.L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) were the first to directly demonstrate that transfection-mediated overexpression of SR-BI in cultured cells increases the rate of [3H]cholesterol efflux from the cell to HDL particles, but not to free apoA-I. This is consistent with recent studies that show that lipid-free apoA-I is a poor ligand for SR-BI (19Liadaki K.N. Liu T. Xu S. Ishida B.Y. Duchateaux P.N. Krieger J.P. Kane J. Krieger M. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21262-21271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). There is also a correlation between the level of SR-BI expressed by a variety of cultured cells and the rate of [3H]cholesterol efflux from those cells (18Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. Moya M.L.

Importantly, SR-BI can increase the rate of [3H]cholesterol efflux to reconstituted cholesterol-free HDL particles, suggesting that SR-BI can mediate netcholesterol efflux and could potentially contribute to netcholesterol efflux in some circumstances in vivo (18Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. Moya M.L. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Unlike cholesterol efflux to lipid-free apoA-I, SR-BI-mediated transfer of cholesterol between HDL or other soluble carriers and cells is a bidirectional (exchange) process (20Stangl H. Hyatt M. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32692-32698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It is likely that the direction of net cholesterol movement in this process depends on the relative concentrations of cholesterol in the plasma membrane and the acceptor particles. SR-BI can also bind to LDL and mediates the bidirectional exchange of cholesterol between cells and LDL particles in vitro (20Stangl H. Hyatt M. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32692-32698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which SR-BI promotes cellular cholesterol efflux to (or exchange with) lipoproteins has been the subject of several recent studies (21de la Llera-Moya M. Rothblat G.H.

They showed that CD36, which was known to bind HDL (23Calvo D. Gomez-Coronado D. Lasuncion M.A. Vega M.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Thus, the abilities of SR-BI to mediate efficient selective lipid uptake and efficient [3H]cholesterol efflux are correlated. They also reported that phosphatidylcholine vesicles, which are poor ligands for SR-BI relative to phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylinositol vesicles (26Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), can serve as acceptors for SR-BI-mediated [3H]cholesterol efflux (21de la Llera-Moya M. Rothblat G.H.

Furthermore, they discovered that transfection-mediated SR-BI overexpression by COS cells can alter the “lipid organization” of the cells' plasma membranes, as measured by an assay of cellular cholesterol accessibility to the enzyme cholesterol oxidase added to the extracellular medium (21de la Llera-Moya M.

The molecular changes underlying the SR-BI-dependent change in cholesterol accessibility to the oxidase have not yet been defined. Based on these and other findings, Rothblat et al. (2Rothblat G.H. de la Llera-Moya M. Atger V. Kellner-Weibel G. Williams D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 781-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,21de la Llera-Moya M.

They suggested that this proposed binding-independent SR-BI-mediated efflux might be a consequence of the altered cell-surface lipid organization (2Rothblat G.H. de la Llera-Moya M. Atger V.

The generation in our laboratories of two reagents for the analysis of the structure and function of SR-BI has provided an opportunity to further explore the mechanism of SR-BI-mediated [3H]cholesterol efflux. The first of these reagents, which follows from the earlier work of Temel et al. (27Temel R.E. Trigatti B. DeMattos R.B. Azhar S. Krieger M. Williams D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13600-13605Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), is a high titer, specific rabbit anti-murine SR-BI antiserum that blocks HDL binding and lipid uptake (see below). The second is a set of SR-BI mutants that exhibit altered ligand binding properties, e.g.loss of ability to bind HDL, but not LDL (Ref. 28Gu X. Lawrence R. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9120-9130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar and see below). The cDNAs encoding these mutants were isolated from a randomly mutated library of murine (m)SR-BI cDNAs using the retrovirus library-based activity dissection method (28Gu X. Lawrence R. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9120-9130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). One of these mutants has a double substitution of arginines for glutamines at positions 402 and 418 (Q402R/Q418R). This mutant SR-BI is as effective as wild-type mSR-BI in functioning as an LDL receptor, mediating high affinity LDL binding and uptake of metabolically active cholesterol from LDL; but it has lost most of the corresponding HDL receptor activity exhibited by the wild-type receptor (28Gu X. Lawrence R. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9120-9130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Another previously unreported mutant with a Met-to-Arg substitution at position 158 (M158R) has diminished HDL and LDL receptor activities, but apparently normal acetylated LDL (AcLDL) receptor activity. In this report, we examined the effects of the blocking antibody and the Q402R/Q418R and M158R mutations on SR-BI-mediated cellular [3H]cholesterol efflux. We also tested the effect of the anti-SR-BI blocking antibody on the plasma membrane lipid organization (the size of the cholesterol oxidase-accessible cholesterol pool). The results strongly suggest that HDL and LDL binding to SR-BI is a prerequisite for SR-BI-mediated efflux of cholesterol to these lipoproteins. Human HDL, LDL, AcLDL, 125I-HDL,125I-LDL, DiI-labeled HDL, DiI-labeled LDL, DiI-labeled AcLDL, and Alexa-labeled HDL were prepared as described previously (14Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S.

To generate ldlA[M158R] cells, ldlA-7 cells grown in 100-mm dishes were cotransfected with 10 μg of pcM158R plasmid (see below) and 1 μg of pBK-CMV plasmid (Stratagene) using the GenePORTER transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stably transfected cells were selected in Ham's F-12 medium containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (medium A) supplemented with 5% FBS (medium B) and 500 μg/ml G418 for 2 weeks. They were then labeled with anti-mSR-BI KKB-1 antiserum (1:1000 dilution; see below) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000 dilution; Cappel, West Chester, PA). Individual cells with high levels of M158R expression were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and cloned as described previously (28Gu X. Lawrence R. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9120-9130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, eight additional clones of ldlA-7 cells expressing the Q402R/Q418R mutant and one additional clone expressing wild-type mSR-BI were also isolated. For [3H]cholesterol efflux, immunofluorescence, immunoblotting, and [3H]cholesteryl ester formation assays (see below), untransfected or transfected ldlA-7 cells were plated on day 0 in 6-well (250,000 cells/well) or 24-well (50,000 cells/well) dishes in medium A supplemented with 5% newborn calf lipoprotein-deficient serum (NCLPDS) (medium F). For125I-HDL and 125I-LDL binding studies, the cells were plated in 24-well dishes in medium B in place of medium F. New Zealand White rabbits were immunized by intravenous injection of 1013 particles of Ad.mSR-BI, a recombinant adenovirus encoding mSR-BI (17Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Serum was obtained 6 weeks post-injection or later, and IgG fractions were prepared using protein A-Sepharose column purification (Sigma). Control serum and associated IgG were obtained from a non-immunized New Zealand White rabbit. ldlA-7 and ldlA[mSR-BI] cells were plated on day 0 as described above. On day 2, cells were washed once with medium A and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with 0.5 ml of medium C (medium A containing 0.5% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin) containing one of the following: no additions, nonimmune serum (1:1000 dilution), anti-mSR-BI KKB-1 serum (1:1000 dilution), nonimmune IgG (50 μg/ml), or anti-mSR-BI KKB-1 IgG (50 μg/ml). 55 μl of medium C containing 500 μg/ml either 125I-HDL or125I-LDL were then added to each well (final lipoprotein concentration of 50 μg of protein/ml). After incubation at 37 °C for an additional 1.5 h, the cells were washed, and cell-associated 125I-HDL and 125I-LDL were measured as described previously (14Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S.

COS M6 cells were transiently transfected with the expression vector pcDNA1 without a cDNA insert (empty control vector) or with pcDNA1 containing mSR-BI cDNA (pcDNA1-mSR-BI) using the GenePORTER transfection reagent. Briefly, cells were plated at 500,000 cells/dish in 100-mm dishes in medium D (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine) supplemented with 10% FBS (medium E) on day 0. On day 1, cells were transfected with 10 μg of the indicated plasmids according to the manufacturer's instruction. On day 2, cells were harvested with trypsin and replated in 24-well dishes at a cell density of 150,000 cells/well in medium E. After incubation at 37 °C for 5 h, the medium was aspirated, replaced with 1 ml of labeling medium (medium D containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1 μCi/ml [1,2-3H]cholesterol added in ethanol), and incubated at 37 °C overnight. On day 3, the cells were washed twice with medium D, and 1 ml of equilibration medium 1 (medium D containing 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin) was added to each well. On day 4, the cells were washed twice with medium D and incubated with 0.5 ml of medium D containing no additions, nonimmune serum (1:1000 dilution), or anti-mSR-BI KKB-1 serum (1:1000 dilution) for 45 min at 37 °C. 55 μl of medium D containing 2 mg of protein/ml HDL were then added to each well (final HDL concentration of 200 μg of protein/ml). After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, the [3H]cholesterol contents of the cells and the media were determined as follows. The efflux media were collected and clarified by centrifugation for 1 min with a desktop microcentrifuge, and the radioactivity in 100 μl of each supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting (LSC). Cells were solubilized with 400 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature, and the amount of [3H]cholesterol in 100 μl of each lysate was determined by LSC. Total cellular [3H]cholesterol was calculated as the sum of the radioactivity in the efflux medium plus the radioactivity in the cells and was used to calculate the [3H]cholesterol efflux (percent of total [3H]cholesterol released into the medium). Control or mSR-BI-expressing COS M6 cells were prepared, labeled with [3H]cholesterol, and equilibrated as described above. Cells were then incubated with 0.5 ml of medium D containing no additions, nonimmune serum, or anti-mSR-BI KKB-1 serum for 45 min at 37 °C as described above for the efflux assay. 55 μl of medium D containing 5 units/ml cholesterol oxidase were then added to each well (final cholesterol oxidase concentration of 0.5 units/ml). After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the cells were washed once with medium D, and the lipids were extracted with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2) and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography on Silica Gel 60 plates using hexane/methanol/ethyl ether (96:15:8) and cholesterol, 4-cholesten-3-one, and cholesterol oleate as internal standards (21de la Llera-Moya M.

The radioactivity in the bands corresponding to [3H]cholestenone, [3H]cholesterol, and [3H]cholesteryl ester was determined by LSC. On day 0, cells were plated in either 6- or 24-well plates as described above. On day 1, the medium in each well was replaced with 2 ml (6-well plates) or 1 ml (24-well dishes) of labeling medium (medium A containing 10% heat-inactivated NCLPDS (or FBS) and 1 μCi/ml [1,2-3H]cholesterol). On day 3, cells were washed once with medium A and then incubated in 2 ml (1 ml for 24-well dishes) of equilibration medium 2 (medium A containing 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin). On day 4, cells were washed once with medium A. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 45 min with 1 ml (0.5 ml for 24-well dishes) of medium A with or without anti-mSR-BI KKB-1 serum (1:1000 dilution). After a single washing with medium A, 1 ml (0.5 ml for 24-well dishes) of efflux medium (medium A containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) and the indicated amount of lipoproteins with or without antibody (1:1000 dilution)) was added to each well. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C. At the indicated times, 120 μl of efflux medium were removed from the wells and clarified by centrifugation for 1 min in a microcentrifuge. The radioactivity in 100 μl of the supernatant was then measured by LSC. At the end of the incubation, the remaining efflux medium was discarded, and the cells were lysed in 800 μl (400 μl for 24-well dishes) of lysis buffer for 30 min at room temperature. The radioactivity in 100 μl of each cell lysate was determined by LSC, and efflux (expressed as percent of total cellular [3H]cholesterol) was calculated as described above for COS M6 cells. The use of this cell lysate method to quantify the levels of cell-associated [3H]cholesterol was validated in several experiments by a direct compa"

To explore the influence of heterodimerization on the subcellular distribution of these receptors in living cells, we developed a series of fluorescent-protein chimeras. The steady-state distribution of the yellow fluorescent protein-RXR was more nuclear than the unliganded green fluorescent protein (GFP)-VDR. Coexpression of RXR-blue fluorescent protein (BFP) promoted nuclear accumulation of GFP-VDR by influencing both nuclear import and retention. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy (FRET) demonstrated that the unliganded GFP-VDR and RXR-BFP form heterodimers. The increase in nuclear heterodimer content correlated with an increase in basal transcriptional activity. FRET also revealed that calcitriol induces formation of multiple nuclear foci of heterodimers. Mutational analysis showed a correlation between hormone-dependent nuclear VDR foci formation and DNA binding. RXR-BFP also promoted hormone-dependent nuclear accumulation and intranuclear foci formation of a nuclear localization signal mutant receptor (nlsGFP-VDR) and rescued its transcriptional activity. Heterodimerization mutant RXR failed to alter GFP-VDR andnlsGFP-VDR distribution or activity. These experiments suggest that RXR has a profound effect on VDR distribution. This effect of RXR to promote nuclear accumulation and intranuclear targeting contributes to the regulation of VDR activity and probably the activity of other heterodimerization partners.

A member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, the vitamin D receptor (VDR)1, mediates effects of calcitriol on bone development and maintenance, calcium homeostasis, immune functions, endocrine functions, vitamin D metabolism, and cellular proliferation and differentiation. Like other class II nuclear receptors, such as the thyroid hormone receptor, the retinoic acid receptor, and many orphan receptors, VDR requires heterodimerization with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) for high affinity binding to target genes (1Sone T. Kerner S. Pike J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23296-23305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Blumberg B. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3149-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). VDR and RXR can heterodimerize in the absence of calcitriol, and these heterodimers regulate basal transcriptional activity of target genes and exert transcriptional silencing functions (3Tagami T. Lutz W.H. Kumar R. Jameson J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The addition of calcitriol stabilizes the heterodimers and promotes their binding to the vitamin D response elements (4Carlberg C. Saurat J.H. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 1996; 1: 82-86PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of heterodimerization in VDR functions led us to investigate the spatial and temporal relationships between these receptors in living cells.Recently we and others have used green fluorescent protein chimeras of VDR to study the receptor distribution in living cells (5Racz A. Barsony J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19352-19360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 6Michigami T. Suga A. Yamazaki M. Shimizu C. Cai G. Okada S. Ozono K. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1998; 70: 94-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Unlike the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which stays in the cytoplasm without the ligand, the unliganded VDR distributes evenly between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This indicates that the regulation of VDR distribution is more complex than the regulation of GR distribution. The fact that VDR distribution is similar to thyroid hormone receptor distribution (8Zhu X.G. Hanover J.A. Hager G.L. Cheng S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27058-27063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) raised the possibility that heterodimerization with RXR could account for the partial nuclear localization of both VDR and thyroid hormone receptor.Most of what we know about the subcellular distribution of RXR comes from immunohistological and cell fractionation studies. In these studies, RXR was found in the nuclei of normal human skin cells (9Reichrath J. Mittmann M. Kamradt J. Muller S.M. Histochem. J. 1997; 29: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the rat kidney (10Sugawara A. Sanno N. Takahashi N. Osamura R.Y. Abe K. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3175-3180Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the human pituitary (11Sanno N. Sugawara A. Teramoto A. Abe Y. Yen P.M. Chin W.W. Osamura R.Y. Neuroendocrinology. 1997; 65: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). RXR was also detected in the cytoplasm by cell fractionation experiments (12Janssen J.J. Kuhlmann E.D. van Vugt A.H. Winkens H.J. Janssen B.P. Deutman A.F. Driessen C.A. Curr. Eye Res. 1999; 19: 338-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although a nuclear localization of RXR is to be expected, looking in live cells sometimes gives surprises, as has been the partial cytoplasmic localization of the thyroid hormone receptor (8Zhu X.G. Hanover J.A. Hager G.L. Cheng S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27058-27063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In a recent paper, focusing on the localization of an orphan nuclear receptor, the transiently expressed mouse GFP-RXRβ was found in the nuclei of phaeochromocytoma cells (36Katagiri Y. Takeda K., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans J. Ozato K. Guroff G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Because previous studies indicated that VDR preferentially associates with RXRα to stimulate transcription (13Kephart D.D. Walfish P.G. DeLuca H. Butt T.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 408-419PubMed Google Scholar), the subcellular localization of the RXRα had to be explored in detail. Even less is known about the subcellular location of the VDR/RXR heterodimers. Receptors that heterodimerize with RXR are not only synthesized in the cytoplasm but reside in the cytoplasm to some degree before ligand binding. Thus, heterodimerization may influence subcellular localization of RXR or its partner receptors. Using transcriptionally active and stably expressed yellow, green, and blue fluorescent protein chimeras of RXR and VDR and their mutants, we visualized the differences in the distribution of VDR and RXR in living cells by confocal laser-scanning microscopy.Current developments of multicolor fluorescent protein variants also allow visualization of protein interactions in living cells by fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy (FRET) (14Periasamy A. Day R.N. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 58: 293-314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This method was used to demonstrate homodimerization of Pit-1 transcription factor and heterodimerization of Pit-1 with cEts-1 in the cell nucleus (15Day R.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1410-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) as well as the association of retinoic acid receptors and estrogen receptors with coactivators (16Chauchereau A. Georgiakaki M. Perrin-Wolff M. Milgrom E. Loosfelt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8540-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Here, we adapted FRET to establish that GFP-tagged VDR and RXR heterodimerize in living cells and used this technique to explore the distribution of heterodimers.Recent results reveal that transcriptional activities of nuclear receptors and other signaling proteins could be regulated by the control of translocation across the nuclear membrane (17Johnson C. Van Antwerp D. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We generated a cell line stably expressing GFP-VDR that allowed us to correlate nuclear receptor content with basal transcriptional activity. Our experiments revealed that RXR promotes nuclear accumulation of VDR. To study the mechanisms of this RXR effect we explored both nuclear import and export of the unliganded VDR by mutational analysis and by temperature changes.During hormone-induced receptor activation, a redistribution from the cytoplasm into the nucleus has been shown in living cells for GFP chimeras of the mineralocorticoid receptor (18Fejes-Toth G.

Endocrinol. 1997; 129: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We found earlier that the cytoplasmic portion of VDR-GFP also translocates into the nucleus in a ligand-dependent fashion (5Racz A. Barsony J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19352-19360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 6Michigami T. Suga A. Yamazaki M. Shimizu C. Cai G. Okada S. Ozono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33531-33538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The mechanisms controlling VDR translocation, however, remained to be elucidated. Nuclear import of proteins involves the binding of their nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences to import receptors (22Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 931-934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Kohler M. Haller H. Hartmann E. Exp. Nephrol. 1999; 7: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recently, NLSs have been identified in the VDR (7Hsieh J.C. Shimizu Y. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Haussler C.A. Jurutka P.W. Haussler M.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 70: 94-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24Luo Z. Rouvinen J. Maenpaa P.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The effects of mutations in these NLS regions have not yet been evaluated in living cells, and the NLS has not yet been identified in the RXR sequence. We used mutational analysis to clarify the impact of heterodimerization on the rapid calcitriol-induced VDR translocation and correlate it with changes in transcriptional activity. Here we coexpressed a heterodimerization-competent RXR with an NLS mutant of the GFP-VDR to demonstrate that RXR also interacts with the nuclear import machinery.Ligand-induced intranuclear pattern changes, including foci formation, have been reported for the GR (19Htun H.

Here, we report similar hormone-induced intranuclear foci of YFP-RXR and GFP-VDR. In addition, we used FRET microscopy to study ligand-induced changes in the intranuclear distribution of the GFP-VDR/RXR-BFP heterodimers. We used mutational analysis to explore a connection between DNA binding and nuclear foci formation and used FRET microscopy to visualize the effect of RXR to promote DNA binding of VDR in living cells.DISCUSSIONOur experiments with green and blue fluorescent chimeras of the receptors and FRET microscopy provided the initial evidence for the distribution of VDR/RXR heterodimers in living cells. Confocal microscopy also allowed us to recognize that dimerizing RXR facilitates nuclear accumulation of VDR. In addition, we observed that VDR, RXR, and their respective heterodimers all responded to hormone by forming intranuclear bright foci. Mutational analysis showed a correlation between receptor distribution and transcriptional activity and between nuclear foci formation and DNA binding.At first, we generated N-terminal-tagged GFP-VDR and YFP-RXR and a C-terminal-tagged RXR-BFP expression plasmids. The transcriptional activities of the tagged receptors were confirmed by luciferase reporter assays, and the expression of the correct size proteins were confirmed by Western blot analysis. We also cloned cell lines to stably express the GFP-VDR (GL48) and the YFP-RXR (CYR) to establish reproducible systems for the investigation of hormone-independent and hormone-dependent receptor trafficking. Previously, we and others used alternate GFP chimeras of VDR to show hormone-dependent translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus (5Racz A. Barsony J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19352-19360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 6Michigami T. Suga A. Yamazaki M. Shimizu C. Cai G. Okada S. Ozono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33531-33538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy on GL48 cells confirmed our previous findings on the steady-state subcellular distribution of VDR by showing that unliganded GFP-VDR remained evenly distributed between the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 2).Our finding on the steady-state nuclear localization of YFP-RXRα in living cells was expected from previous immunolocalization studies, and it is similar to the nuclear localization of the transiently expressed GFP-RXRβ in PC12 cells (36Katagiri Y. Takeda K., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans J. Ozato K. Guroff G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In contrast, the presence of YFP-RXR in the cytoplasm is new and suggests that heterodimers of VDR and RXR could also form in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the difference between the steady-state localization of RXR and VDR raised the possibility that heterodimerization could influence the distribution of either VDR or RXR.FRET microscopy has not been used extensively in the nuclear receptor field. Here, utilizing a heterodimerization mutant of RXR as a control, we located dimers of RXR-BFP and GFP-VDR for the first time in intact living cells. These FRET studies showed that the tagged receptors are competent to form heterodimers; therefore, they were suitable for studies on the impact of dimerization on subcellular trafficking. FRET results demonstrated that most of the VDR formed dimers with the RXR without the ligand and that these heterodimers were predominantly in the nucleus in a diffuse pattern excluding the nucleoli.Our experiments showed that the dimerization-competent RXR can shift the VDR from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, but the dimerization-deficient RXR is ineffective. This effect of RXR on VDR distribution could involve changes in either VDR export or import across the nuclear envelope. We tested the effect of RXR on VDR export by taking advantage of the differences in their temperature sensitivity. Lowering the temperature of GL48 cells induced export of GFP-VDR into the cytoplasm, but GFP-VDR/RXR-BFP heterodimers were less sensitive to temperature change and remained in the nucleus (Fig. 5). This finding suggests that the export mechanisms for the heterodimer differ from that of VDR. It is possible that export receptors are involved because both VDR and RXR have leucine-rich sequences, which could serve as nuclear export signal (37Hopper A.K. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 803-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of these GFP-tagged receptors opens several potential avenues for the investigations of these export mechanisms.We also found that RXR influences nuclear import of VDR. This is most apparent in our experiments with the nlsGFP-VDR, which harbors a mutation in one of the nuclear localization signals of the VDR (7Hsieh J.C. Shimizu Y. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Haussler C.A. Jurutka P.W. Haussler M.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 70: 94-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This mutation severely compromised nuclear import of VDR but did not completely abolish it. The remaining import is likely to be mediated by other domains of the VDR, such as the one suggested within the hinge region (24Luo Z. Rouvinen J. Maenpaa P.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, we did not find any defect in nuclear import when we deleted this region of GFP-VDR. 2J. Barsony, unpublished data. The ability of RXR to bring the NLS mutant GFP-VDR into the nucleus can be explained by a piggyback mechanism. Such a mechanism was reported to bring the NLS mutant of progesterone receptor into the nucleus by homodimerizing wild-type receptors (38Guiochon-Mantel A. Loosfelt H. Lescop P. Christin-Maitre S. Perrot-Applanat M. Milgrom E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 41: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The effect of RXR could also be indirect; RXR could weaken the VDR interactions with cytoplasmic docking sites, as suggested by a recent report showing that RXR increases the solubility and perhaps assists the folding of the retinoic acid receptor inEscherichia coli (39Li C. Schwabe J.W. Banayo E. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2278-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Finally, RXR could also act by complexing with Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones (40Holley S.J. Yamamoto K.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1833-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Interestingly, RXR not only influenced the steady-state distribution of thenlsGFP-VDR but also restored the effect of calcitriol to induce a rapid nuclear accumulation of the mutant receptors (Figs. 6and 7). This effect is unexpected and implies a role for RXR in the regulation of VDR nuclear import.We found a strong correlation between the ability of RXR to shift VDR into the nucleus and to regulate its transcriptional activity. First, the increase in the nuclear VDR content correlated with an increase in basal transcriptional activity by VDR both in GL48 and CV-1 cells. This hormone-like effect of RXR is consistent with the phantom ligand effect of RXR described earlier (41Schulman I.G. Li C. Schwabe J.W. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This effect on basal activity may be physiologically important, since previous studies indicate that the unliganded VDR can activate several target genes (42Castillo A.I. Jimenez-Lara A.M. Tolon R.M. Aranda A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1141-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 43Dabrowski M. Robinson E. Hughes S.V. Bland R. Hewison M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 142: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Second, RXR facilitated hormone-independent nuclear localization of thenlsGFP-VDR and increased basal transcriptional activity by the nlsGFP-VDR. Third, RXR restored the ability of thenlsGFP-VDR to accumulate in the nucleus after calcitriol addition and to activate the reporter gene after calcitriol addition. This indicates that the regulation of VDR nuclear import by RXR may play a role in hormone-dependent transcriptional regulation. Such regulation could explain how, in some target tissues, changes in the ratio between RXR and VDR can influence calcitriol-induced transcription (44Whitfield G.K. Hsieh J.C. Nakajima S. MacDonald P.N. Thompson P.D. Jurutka P.W. Haussler C.A. Haussler M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1166-1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Kahlen J.P. Carlberg C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4307-4313Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Potentially, the regulation of protein trafficking across the nuclear envelope by RXR is a general mechanism that controls the activity of many transcriptional regulators.Regulation of subnuclear trafficking can be one of the ways RXR influences the speed and specificity of transcriptional activities. Here we found that hormone induces YFP-RXR and GFP-VDR to accumulate in foci (Figs. 1 and 2). Our earlier finding that a DNA binding mutant of GFP-GR failed to form foci (46Barsony J. Carroll J. McKoy W. Renyi I. Gould D.L. Htun H. Hager G.L. Microsc. Microanal. 1997; 3 Suppl. 2: 131-132Crossref Google Scholar) and our present finding that the DNA binding mutant of GFP-VDR also fails to form nuclear foci suggest that these foci could signify receptor binding to DNA target sites. This notion is further supported by the FRET experiments, which show that calcitriol treatment causes focal accumulation of heterodimers in the nucleus (Fig. 3). The use of the heterodimerization mutant of RXR-BFP for control makes this argument even more powerful. Moreover, coexpression of RXR-BFP restored the ability of thenlsGFP-VDR to form foci and activate transcription after calcitriol treatment (Figs. 7 and 9). The dimerization-deficient form of RXR-BFP had no effect. This observation is in agreement with earlier findings on the effect of calcitriol to promote binding of VDR/RXR heterodimers to vitamin D response elements (47Thompson P.D. Jurutka P.W. Haussler C.A. Whitfield G.K. Haussler M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8483-8491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 48Lemon B.D. Freedman L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1006-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and suggests that RXR could promote DNA binding by influencing intranuclear targeting of VDR. A local change in receptor dynamics could account for the calcitriol-induced accumulation of heterodimers in discrete subnuclear regions and warrant further investigations by photobleaching techniques.Multicolor fluorescent protein tagging and advanced microscopy methods allowed us to visualize subcellular distribution of VDR, RXR, and their respective heterodimers in living cells. These studies revealed that RXR heterodimerization plays a key role in the translocation and nuclear targeting of VDR, which could explain tissue-specific differences in VDR distribution observed previously by immunocytology (25Prüfer K. Veenstra T.D. Jirikowski G.F. Kumar R. J. Chem. Neuroanat. 1999; 16: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We also visualized the ligand-dependent interaction of heterodimers with possible DNA binding sites by FRET imaging and found a correlation between intranuclear foci formation and transcriptional activity by mutational analysis. Mutational analysis also indicated that nuclear targeting is independent of DNA binding. As the RXR forms heterodimers with other nuclear receptors and associates with coactivators and corepressors, RXR could also regulate the activity of other partners by regulating subcellular trafficking. The techniques described here open the possibility of exploring the location and kinetics for a multitude of regulatory protein interactions and exploring the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in living cells. Proteins of the nuclear receptor superfamily mediate response to hormones or intracellular signals into transcriptional responses and regulate an array of important cellular functions. A member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, the vitamin D receptor (VDR)1, mediates effects of calcitriol on bone development and maintenance, calcium homeostasis, immune functions, endocrine functions, vitamin D metabolism, and cellular proliferation and differentiation. Like other class II nuclear receptors, such as the thyroid hormone receptor, the retinoic acid receptor, and many orphan receptors, VDR requires heterodimerization with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) for high affinity binding to target genes (1Sone T. Kerner S. Pike J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23296-23305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Blumberg B. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3149-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). VDR and RXR can heterodimerize in the absence of calcitriol, and these heterodimers regulate basal transcriptional activity of target genes and exert transcriptional silencing functions (3Tagami T. Lutz W.H. Kumar R. Jameson J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The addition of calcitriol stabilizes the heterodimers and promotes their binding to the vitamin D response elements (4Carlberg C. Saurat J.H. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 1996; 1: 82-86PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of heterodimerization in VDR functions led us to investigate the spatial and temporal relationships between these receptors in living cells. Recently we and others have used green fluorescent protein chimeras of VDR to study the receptor distribution in living cells (5Racz A. Barsony J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19352-19360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 6Michigami T. Suga A. Yamazaki M. Shimizu C. Cai G. Okada S. Ozono K. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1998; 70: 94-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Unlike the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which stays in the cytoplasm without the ligand, the unliganded VDR distributes evenly between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This indicates that the regulation of VDR distribution is more complex than the regulation of GR distribution. The fact that VDR distribution is similar to thyroid hormone receptor distribution (8Zhu X.G. Hanover J.A. Hager G.L. Cheng S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27058-27063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) raised the possibility that heterodimerization with RXR could account for the partial nuclear localization of both VDR and thyroid hormone receptor. Most of what we know about the subcellular distribution of RXR comes from immunohistological and cell fractionation studies. In these studies, RXR was found in the nuclei of normal human skin cells (9Reichrath J. Mittmann M. Kamradt J. Muller S.M. Histochem. J. 1997; 29: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the rat kidney (10Sugawara A. Sanno N. Takahashi N. Osamura R.Y. Abe K.

Neuroendocrinology. 1997; 65: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). RXR was also detected in the cytoplasm by cell fractionation experiments (12Janssen J.J. Kuhlmann E.D. van Vugt A.H.

In many cases RNA-binding proteins contain short signature domains that bind RNA and anchor the protein such that functional domains align (13Ramos A. Gubser C.C. Varani G. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Much less is known about the mechanisms by which RNA-binding proteins regulate mRNA stability. Plasminogen activators (PAs)1are serine proteases that catalyze the conversion of plasminogen to the broad spectrum protease, plasmin. Plasmin is the major fibrinolytic enzyme in blood and also participates in a number of physiological and pathological processes involving localized proteolysis such as tissue remodeling and tumor cell invasion and metastasis (15Vassalli J.D.

Nature. 1994; 370: 14-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). PA activity is regulated in large part by type-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), a 50-kDa glycoprotein found in plasma, platelets, and a variety of cell types (17Kruithof E.K. Enzyme (Basel). 1988; 40: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). PAI-1 expression is regulated by growth factors, cytokines, and hormones, including agents that regulate cellular cAMP levels (18Heaton J.H. Gelehrter T.D. Mol.

HTC rat hepatoma cells synthesize tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and PAI-1. These cells respond to cyclic nucleotides with a dramatic (50-fold) increase in tPA activity secondary to a 90% decrease in PAI-1 activity and mRNA. The decrease in PAI-1 mRNA is due primarily to a 3-fold increase in the rate of mRNA degradation (21Heaton J.H. Kathju S. Gelehrter T.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 53-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By transfecting HTC cells with chimeric constructs containing the β-globin coding sequence and portions of the PAI-1 3′-UTR, we have shown that sequences in the PAI-1 3′-UTR are able to confer cyclic nucleotide regulation onto the heterologous transcript. Analysis of deletion and insertion constructs demonstrated that the 3′-most 134 nt of the PAI-1 mRNA by itself is able to mediate this response. This cyclic nucleotide-responsivesequence (CRS) includes a 75-nt U-rich region at its 5′ end and a 24-nt A-rich region at its 3′ end (22Heaton J.H. Tillmann-Bogush M. Leff N.S. Gelehrter T.D. J.

RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (R-EMSA) experiments have shown that the PAI-1 CRS forms complexes with HTC cell cytoplasmic proteins, and UV cross-linking studies have demonstrated binding proteins ranging in size from 38 to 76 kDa. Most of these proteins interact with the A-rich portion of the PAI-1 CRS. Mutations in the A-rich regions abolish both RNA-protein complex formation and cyclic nucleotide regulation of message decay in transfected HTC cells, suggesting that these RNA-binding proteins may be important regulators of mRNA stability (23Tillmann-Bogush M.

Here we report the isolation and cloning of one of these proteins and demonstrate its specific interaction with PAI-1 mRNA. Detailed analysis of nucleic acid and protein data bases demonstrates that this PAI-1 mRNA-binding protein includes blocks of sequence that are highly conserved in a number of metazoans. Thus, we have identified and cloned a novel RNA-binding protein that reveals a family of proteins with a previously unidentified domain that may define a new RNA-binding motif.

M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (1989)Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, pp. 4.7 andA.1C, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar) using as template either plasmid DNA linearized with the appropriate restriction enzyme or PCR products, including a T3 RNA polymerase site. The DNA template was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with T3 or T7 RNA polymerase in transcription buffer containing RNase inhibitor, ATP, CTP, GTP, and [32P]UTP (100 μCi of 800 Ci/mmol). The labeled RNA was purified by electrophoresis through a 6% polyacrylamide, 8m urea gel, eluted from the gel, and ethanol-precipitated. Unlabeled competitor RNA was prepared by in vitro transcription using the AmpliscribeTM T3 transcription kit according the protocol provided by the manufacturer. R-EMSA and UV cross-linking analyses were carried out essentially as described previously (23Tillmann-Bogush M. Heaton J.H. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1172-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For R-EMSA, HTC cell polysomes or purified recombinant protein were incubated with 32P-labeled RNA (∼200,000 dpm/reaction) for 20 min at room temperature in buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 5 mmMgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 5% gylcerol, 1 mm dithiotreitol, 8 units of RNase inhibitor, and 10–25 μg of tRNA. Following consecutive incubations with RNase T1 (1 unit/μl) and heparin (5 μg/μl), electrophoresis was carried out at 4 °C in 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (40:1 acrylamide-bisacrylamide). For UV cross-linking analyses, proteins were incubated with 32P-labeled RNA (∼106dpm/reaction) as described for R-EMSA. Following the heparin incubation, reactions were exposed to UV light (UV Statalinker 1800, Statagene) at a distance of 2.5 cm for 10 min (1.8 μJ/cm2) and incubated for 10 min with RNase A and RNase T2. Reactions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. For competition studies protein was incubated with unlabeled RNA competitor for 10 min at room temperature prior to addition of radiolabeled RNA. HTC cell polysomes (60 μg/reaction) were incubated with32P-labeled (∼106 dpm/reaction) or unlabeled (∼7 ng/reaction) CRS RNA and R-EMSA carried out as described above. In each gel, 4 of 16 lanes had R-EMSA reactions with radiolabeled RNA. High molecular weight complexes were located by a 1-h exposure to x-ray film at room temperature. Complexes from labeled and unlabeled reactions were excised and eluted from the gel by overnight incubation in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiotreitol, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% SDS (25Ranish J.A. Hahn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19320-19327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins from 32 such reactions were pooled, concentrated by acetone precipitation, separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (ProBlott, PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue and submitted to the Protein and Carbohydrate Structure Facility of The University of Michigan Biomedical Research Core Facility, where N-terminal sequencing was carried out, using a PE Applied Biosystems model 494 protein sequencer. The cDNA encoding “hypothetical protein” (DKFZp564M2423, GenBankTM accession number AL080119) was kindly provided by the Resource Center and Primary Data base of the German Human Genome Project (Resource Center and Primary Database, Berlin). The cDNA was amplified by PCR using a high fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to include the entire protein coding sequence. The forward primer (DKFZ bp 71–95) was synthesized with a mutation at bp 83–85 to create an Nde I site. The reverse primer (DKFZ 1270–1244) has 1 bp altered to create aBam HI site. The 1200-bp product was inserted into theNde I/Bam HI sites of the vector pET-15b, generating the construct pET-15b/DKFZ for expression of “hypothetical protein” with an N-terminal histidine tag and thrombin cleavage site. Ligation products were transformed into E. coli AG-1 cells, and the subclone was verified by PCR and DNA sequencing. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS were transformed with purified pET-15b/DKFZ plasmid, and protein expression was induced with 2 mm IPTG. The recombinant protein was purified by Ni2+ chelation using the His-binding resin according to the supplier's protocol and was concentrated using Centricon 3 concentrators. An iterative search of the nonredundant protein data base with PSI-BLAST (26Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar) was carried out to identify proteins with statistically significant similarity to the protein we have isolated. The data base of expressed sequence tags was searched using the gapped version of TBLASTN. Query sequence was filtered for low complexity regions using SEG (27Wootton J.C. Federhen S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 554-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), since its RGG repeats nonselectively retrieve many unrelated proteins with similar low-complexity regions. Gibbs sampling as implemented in a computer program PROBE (28Neuwald A.F. Liu J.S. Lipman D.J. Lawrence C.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1665-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) was used to identify conserved sequence regions shared by all members of the family. This ungapped multiple alignment provided a seed for another round of BLAST searches in an attempt to identify distantly related sequences. Finally, we used HMMER programs (29Eddy S.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar) to produce a Hidden Markov Model, which was also used to search the protein data base. Both BLAST seed and Hidden Markov Model of this protein family are available to interested researches upon request. Identified sequences were searched against PFAM (30Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Howe K.L. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar) and Blocks+ (31Henikoff J.G. Greene E.A. Pietrokovski S. Henikoff S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 228-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) to determine whether they have any previously known sequence motif(s). To isolate proteins that interact with the rat PAI-1 CRS, we have used an RNA affinity approach, using the 134-nt sequence of the rat PAI-1 CRS shown in Fig.1 A. HTC polysomal proteins were incubated with 32P-labeled or unlabeled CRS and separated by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The high molecular weight complex (Fig. 1 B, brackets) was excised from the gel, and the proteins were eluted from the gel slices. Proteins from 32 such reactions, representing ∼2 mg of starting polysomal protein, were pooled, concentrated by acetone precipitation, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 1 C shows that three protein bands are visible in the Coomassie Blue-stained gel. In a parallel experiment, proteins from the SDS-PAGE gel were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (ProBlott, PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and stained with Coomassie Blue. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the major band (Fig. 1 C,arrow) yielded 19 amino acids of N-terminal sequence. The sequence was submitted to a BLAST search of the nonredundant protein data base and two entries with 18 identical N-terminal amino acids were found: hypothetical protein (GenBankTMaccession number AL080119) and “CGI-55” (GenBankTM accession number AF151813). Both sequences represent human proteins with an as yet unknown function and appear to be splice variants; CGI-55 has a 6-amino acid insertion after position 202 in hypothetical protein (Fig. 1 D). The CGI-55 sequence potentially codes for a 43.2-kDa protein, but is a composite of a several ESTs (32Lai C.H. Chou C.Y. Ch'ang L.Y. Liu C.S. Lin W. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and is not yet cloned as a single sequence. The cDNA for hypothetical protein was cloned by the German Cancer Research Center (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum) and was kindly provided to us by the Resource Center and Primary Data base of the German Genome Project (Resource Center and Primary Database, Berlin). While the amino acid sequence does not indicate an RNA recognition motif (RRM) or a K-homology (KH) domain, the sequence does include an RGG box at amino acid positions 343–359, an RG-rich region at amino acid 163–184, and an Arg-rich region at amino acid 126–137, motifs frequently found in RNA-binding proteins (11Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 D). In addition, there is a potential protein kinase A phosphorylation site a serine 74, indicating that the protein function could be regulated by cyclic nucleotides. The coding region of the cDNA for hypothetical protein was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pET-15b vector downstream from the sequence coding for a histidine tag and a thrombin cleavage site, and the plasmid was expanded in E. coli AG-1. The subclone was verified by PCR and DNA sequencing and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. Expression was induced by 2 mmIPTG and the protein partially purified by Ni2+ chelation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Proteins in the column eluate were separated by SDS-PAGE, and as shown in Fig.2 (lane 3), the major product appears as a triplet. To determine which protein band represents hypothetical protein, we carried out a thrombin digestion, which is expected to cleave at the thrombin site and remove the N-terminal His-tag and associated amino acids. Thrombin digestion resulted in approximately a 2000-dalton decrease in the size of each band in the triplet (Fig. 2, lane 4), demonstrating that all three bands represent the hypothetical protein. The different sizes most likely are the result of premature translation termination due to differences in codon usage frequency between bacteria and eukaryotes (24Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (1989)Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, pp. 4.7 andA.1C, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar, 33Dieci G. Bottarelli L. Ballabeni A. Ottonello S. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 18: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Western analysis with anti-His antibody confirmed that all three bands carry the His-tag. NorthWestern analysis demonstrated that a protein that migrates at the same location binds 32P-labeled PAI-1CRS (data not shown). To confirm that the recombinant human hypothetical protein binds to the rat PAI-1 CRS, we have carried out both R-EMSA and UV cross-linking experiments. Purified recombinant protein was incubated with32P-labeled PAI-1 CRS and R-EMSA carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig.3 A illustrates that the recombinant protein binds in a concentration-dependent fashion (lanes 1–5). Binding is competed by increasing amounts of identical unlabeled sequence (lanes 6–8) but not by a 100-fold molar excess of the bacterial CAT RNA sequence (lane 11). The U-rich region of the PAI-1 CRS (nt 2926/3024), which by itself does not form the major R-EMSA complex with HTC cell cytoplasmic proteins (23Tillmann-Bogush M. Heaton J.H. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1172-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), competes only weakly for CRS interaction with the recombinant protein (lane 9). More significantly, a portion of the rat PAI-1 mRNA (nt 2125/2296) that does not confer cyclic nucleotide regulation of message stability (22Heaton J.H. Tillmann-Bogush M. Leff N.S. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14261-14268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) also fails to compete for binding (lane 10). Similar results were obtained by UV cross-linking experiments. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the RNA-protein complex migrates with an apparent molecular mass of ∼50 kDa, similar in size to the major band seen with HTC cytoplasmic proteins (23Tillmann-Bogush M. Heaton J.H. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1172-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Binding is dependent on protein concentration (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–5) and is competed by unlabeled CRS (lanes 6–8), but not by CAT (lane 11) or PAI-1 2125/2296 (lane 10). The presence of faster migrating bands observed in the presence of unlabeled PAI 2125/2296 suggests that the apparent decrease in the binding complex is probably caused by cross-linking between the labeled probe and the unlabeled competitor RNA rather than by competition for the same binding protein. The U-rich region of the PAI-1 CRS (nt 2926/3024) at 100-fold molar excess competes somewhat, but less well than the full sequence. These results confirm that the protein isolated from an R-EMSA complex is a PAI-1 RNA-binding protein, which we have named PAI-RBP1. Interestingly, the recombinant protein, which migrates on SDS-PAGE as a triplet, forms only a single UV cross-linked complex with PAI-1 CRS, suggesting that the smaller, C-terminal truncated forms are not able to bind. To further define the sequence within the PAI-1 CRS required for binding to the PAI-RBP1, we carried out binding experiments with portions of the CRS. Fig.4 A shows diagrammatically the regions of the CRS used to generate radiolabeled probes. In R-EMSA the 3′ portion of the CRS (nt 2926/2966, lane 4) and the entire U-rich portion (nt 2926/3024, lane 6) fail to bind. Mutations in the A-rich region of the CRS, which we have shown eliminate binding to HTC cytoplasmic proteins (23Tillmann-Bogush M. Heaton J.H. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1172-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), severely decrease or abolish the ability of the RNA to bind to the recombinant RBP1 (lanes 8 and 10). As expected, neither labeled CAT mRNA nor the PAI 2125/2296 appears to interact with the RBP1. Thus, the PAI-RBP1 appears to interact primarily with the A-rich portion of the CRS confirming that the newly isolated PAI-RBP1 has sequence specificity and binding properties similar to that of the major 50–53-kDa HTC cytoplasmic protein (23Tillmann-Bogush M. Heaton J.H. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1172-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The initial search of the protein data base using the 19-amino acid sequence produced only the two sequences with the identical N-terminal amino acids. The data base has grown considerably since, and we have now done an extensive search, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” for similarity to the entire hypothetical protein and DKFZp564M2423 cDNA sequence. This search has revealed several other proteins with a high degree of similarity, particularly in the C-terminal portion. These similar proteins are found in nine different species, including Arabidopsis,Drosophila, chicken, mouse, and rat (Fig.5). The availability of new members of the family permitted us to generate a multiple alignment and to identify their common motifs; the alignment revealed that these proteins share several blocks of conserved sequence (Fig. 5). This domain, which we propose has a function in RNA binding, is located at the C-terminal of all the proteins in this family and, apart from a relatively short stretch of RGG repeats, appears to be a compact entity. The C-terminal RGG box is located between the last two sequence blocks and the RG-rich and Arg-rich regions are N-terminal to the conserved blocks. A number of the other proteins in the family have the RGG box. Thus, PAI-RBP1/hypothetical protein is a member of a family of proteins that share a putative novel RNA binding motif. We report here the identification of a novel rat cytoplasmic protein isolated based on its ability to form R-EMSA complexes with the rat PAI-1 mRNA cyclic nucleotide-responsive sequence. N-terminal sequence data reveal identity with a human sequence, hypothetical protein (GenBankTM accession number AL080119) of unknown function. We have expressed the human sequence in bacteria and analyzed its binding properties. Our results demonstrate that the human protein is a PAI-1 mRNA-binding protein; we now refer to this gene product as PAI-1 RNA-binding protein or PAI-RBP1. Recombinant human PAI-RBP1 binds the A-rich portion of the rat PAI-1 CRS and fails to interact with the isolated U-rich portion. Mutations of the A-rich sequence severely decrease binding. In addition, the specificity of PAI-RBP1 binding is demonstrated by its failure to form a complex with either the bacterial CAT RNA or an upstream, noncyclic nucleotide-responsive region of the PAI sequence. We have reported previously that the PAI-CRS forms complexes with HTC cell cytoplasmic proteins ranging in size from 38 to 76 kDa (23Tillmann-Bogush M. Heaton J.H. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1172-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The binding specificity and the size of the complex seen in Fig. 3 B indicate that PAI-RBP1 is similar to the 50–53-kDa HTC cell cytoplasmic protein and may, in fact, be the human homologue of that rat protein. Because the PAI-1 mRNA binding site is a cyclic nucleotide-responsive sequence, it would be reasonable to expect that binding activity of PAI-RBP1 may be influenced by its phosphorylation state. The recombinant protein was expressed in bacteria and, therefore, not posttranslationally processed as it might be in mammalian cells, possibly explaining the high concentration of protein required for binding. As seen in Fig. 2, the partially purified protein migrates on SDS-PAGE as a triplet. The size of the smaller products is consistent with a C-terminal truncation at the beginning of or within the RGG box. One of the arginines and four of the glycines in this region are coded by rare codons in bacteria and could cause premature termination (24Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (1989)Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, pp. 4.7 andA.1C, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar, 33Dieci G. Bottarelli L. Ballabeni A. Ottonello S. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 18: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Only a single RNA-protein complex is detected in UV cross-linking experiments (Fig. 3 A), strongly suggesting that the most C-terminal portion is required for RNA recognition. A number of proteins that interact with RNA transcripts have been identified and structural domains involved in RNA recognition described (11Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 12Cusack S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). While the majority of known RNA-binding proteins function in RNA processing or translation, several proteins that interact with mRNAs and influence transcript stability have been identified. The iron response element-binding proteins were among the first for which a clear relationship between binding and mRNA stability has been demonstrated (10Rouault T. Klausner R. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1997; 35: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Members of the Elav family of proteins, including HuR and HuB (HelN1), bind RNA through RRMs and have been reported to stabilize AU-rich element-containing RNAs (8Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 34Jain R.G. Andrews L.G. McGowan K.M. Pekala P.H. Keene J.D. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In contrast, the AUF-1 family of proteins (also called hnRNP D), bind AU-rich element regions and enhance degradation of the transcript (36Loflin P. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1884-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 37DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). AUF-1 proteins have two RRMs, as well as a C-terminal RGG that appears to be important for binding (38Kajita Y. Nakayama J. Aizawa M. Ishikawa F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22167-22175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 39DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Long L. Wagner B.J. Brewer G. J. Biol.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). αCP-1 and αCP-2 are KH domain (41Makeyev A.V. Chkheidze A.N. Liebhaber S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24849-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) poly(rC)-binding proteins and play an important role in regulation of α-globin and tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA stability (2Chkheidze A.N.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2532-2538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Vigilin is a KH-domain protein that is induced in Xenopus oocytes by estrogen and binds to and stabilizes vitellogenin mRNA (7Dodson R.E. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12249-12252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). PAI-RBP1 does not have a recognizable RRM or KH domain. It does, however, have an RGG box at amino acid positions 343–359 (Fig.1 D), as well as an RG-rich (amino acids 126–137) and an Arg-rich (amino acids 163–184) motif, which places it in the general category with RNA-binding proteins (11Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 12Cusack S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is of particular interest that this protein, which may be involved in a cyclic nucleotide-mediated regulation event, has a potential protein kinase A site (RKES) at serine 74. We have identified several additional proteins from the data base that share significant similarity with PAI-RBP1 in the C-terminal region (Fig. 5). Interestingly, UV cross-linking experiments, which show a single protein-RNA complex, suggest that the most C-terminal region is required for RNA binding. All members of the protein family shown in Fig. 5 were used to search PFAM, a large data base of more than 2000 protein domain families (30Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Howe K.L. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar), and failed to retrieve any previously known protein domain. Furthermore, these proteins did not show any significant matches when searched against a collection of short sequence motifs contained in Blocks+ (31Henikoff J.G. Greene E.A. Pietrokovski S. Henikoff S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 228-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results argue that PAI-RBP1 and its homologues comprise a novel family of proteins. Because PAI-RBP1 was isolated based on its RNA binding property, and because most members of the family have a similar RGG box in the C-terminal region and an additional Arg-rich motif, we suggest they constitute a family of novel RNA-binding proteins. In fact, two of the identified proteins are annotated in the protein data base as nuclear RNA-binding proteins. We also searched the data base of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) using TBLASTN and found evidence that the C-terminal, putative RNA-binding domain is conserved in more than 10 different metazoan species, which include, in addition to those shown in Fig. 5, Xenopus, zebrafish, and pig. A search of the human EST data base shows that the mRNA is expressed in a wide range of tissues, including pancreas, liver, lung, muscle, ovary, and brain. These findings strongly suggest that PAI-RBP1 has a more general biological role involving regulation of mRNA stability or processes requiring interaction with RNA. Thus far homologues of RBP1 have been found only in metazoans, and their role may be related to regulatory mechanisms that were developed after the emergence of multicellular organisms. However, a protein of statistically marginal similarity to PAI-RBP1 is found in yeast. This protein, Stm1p, binds G-quartet DNA and purine motif DNA triplets, but not double-stranded DNA (43Nelson L.D. Musso M. Van Dyke M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5573-5581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). While it remains possible that Stm1p can bind RNA, its limited similarity to PAI-RBP1 is probably a relic of divergent evolution. PAI-RBP1 appears to have four splice variants (two alternative splice sites). CGI-55 differs from PAI-RBP1 (hypothetical protein) by the insertion of 6 amino acids at position 202. An incomplete sequence for a rat homologue of unknown function from intestinal epithelium (44Sykes D.E. Weiser M.M. Differentiation. 1992; 50: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number U21718) has also been reported. This cDNA codes for an additional 15 amino acid sequence inserted after amino acid position 226 of PAI-RBP1 (Fig.1 D). Using primers complementary to the human PAI-RBP1, we have cloned the rat homologue from an HTC cell cDNA library (45Zeheb R. Gelehrter T.D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This cDNA sequence indicates a variant that includes both the 6 amino acid and 15 amino acid inserts. In addition, a scan of the human genome found ESTs that include the 15-amino acid insertion with and without the 6 amino acid insert. Thus, four variants of the rat and human PAI-RBP1 are possible. Such variations could alter RNA binding properties and/or the function of the RNA-protein complex. Experiments are in progress to construct each of these variants and to analyze their RNA binding properties. We thank Owen Wittekindt and Laura Thill for expert technical assistance.

These results demonstrate that ER export and initiation of COPII vesicle formation in mammalian cells is under kinase regulation. coat complex I/II endoplasmic reticulum guanine nucleotide exchange factor vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate protein kinase A protein kinase A peptide inhibitor μ isozyme of protein kinase C phosphatidylinositol 3 Components comprising the cytosolic coat complex II (COPII)1 are now recognized to be involved in cargo selection and export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (1Barlowe C.

Export from the ER is initiated by the activation of the small GTPase Sar1 through exchange of GDP for GTP by the membrane-associated Sec12 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). This activation step leads to the recruitment of the COPII subunits Sec23/24 from the cytosol to the membrane to form a tertiary complex that interacts with cargo and cargo receptors, initiating selection prior to export (3Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 4Kuehn M.J. Herrmann M. Schekman R. Nature. 1998; 391: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Subsequent recruitment of the Sec13/31 complex allows the selected cargo to be exported from the ER by budding vesicles. Following COPII-mediated sorting from the ER, cargo-containing COPII vesicles are believed to fuse to form pre-Golgi intermediates containing tubular elements (5Rowe T. Dascher C. Bannykh S. Plutner H. Balch W.E. Science. 1998; 279: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Pre-Golgi intermediates are the first step in the exocytic pathway involved in the retrieval of recycling components to the ER using the coat complex I (COPI) components (6Kreis T.E. Lowe M. Pepperkok R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 677-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), thus separating forward moving cargo from the membrane-bound components of the COPII budding and fusion machinery (2Aridor M.

The integration of these two sorting steps enables the forward moving cargo to be selectively delivered to the Golgi complex for transport to the cell surface (7Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T.

Cell. 1999; 98: 59-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) have previously implicated kinases and phosphatases in regulating transport between the ER and Golgi compartments. More recently, a qualitative morphological study using indirect immunoflourescence suggested that H89, an isoquinolinesulfonamide that is frequently used as a selective serine/threonine and protein kinase A inhibitor, was involved in a late step of COPII vesicle coat assembly following Sar1 activation (13Lee T.H. Linstedt A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2577-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We have now examined quantitatively the step in ER export directly regulated by H89 sensitive kinase(s) utilizing purified COPII components to follow the ordered recruitment of COPII to membranes, COPII-mediated vesicle formation, and cargo export. We show that Sar1 recruitment to ER membranes is sensitive to kinase activation, demonstrating that the first step in COPII vesicle formation, Sar1 activation, is under kinase regulation. Recombinant wild type Sar1a was expressed and purified as described previously (14Rowe T. Balch W.E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: C49-C53Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Sec23/24 and Sec13/31 COPII coat subunits were purified from rat liver cytosol as described previously (3Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Antibodies to Sec23, Sar1a, and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) were described previously (3Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). GTPγS was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. H89, PKI, and PKD inhibitor peptides were purchased from Calbiochem. Sec23 recruitment (two-stage recruitment assay with salt wash) was performed as described previously (7Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 875-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). For Sar1 binding, microsome membranes, prepared as described previously (8Rowe T. Aridor M. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 895-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) (20–40 μg), were incubated in the presence of wild type Sar1 (0.1 μg) and Sec23/24 (0.7 μg) or rat liver cytosol (200 μg) in a final volume of 60 μl in a reaction mix containing 36 mm Hepes pH 7.2, 70 mm KOAc, 2.5 mmMgOAc, 250 mm sorbitol, 1.8 mmCaCl2+, 5 mm EGTA, and 100 μm GDP in the presence or absence of an ATP-regenerating system as described previously (11Davidson H.W. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4216-4226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following incubation, the reactions were layered on a 15% sucrose cushion (180 μl) containing 75 mm KOAc and 2 mm MgOAc. The reactions were centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. The membrane-containing pellet was solubilized with Laemmli SDS-sample buffer (15Laemmli U.K. Nature (Lond.). 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantitative immunoblotting (8Rowe T. Aridor M. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 895-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). All experiments presented were performed at least twice with identical results. In vitrovesicle formation assay was performed with purified COPII components utilizing wild type Sar1 (2 μg), Sec23/24 (1 μg), and Sec13/31 (12 μg) as described previously (3Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). All experiments presented were performed at least twice with identical results. The formation of COPII vesicles requires the sequential recruitment of the Sar1 GTPase and the Sec23/24 coat complex followed by the Sec13/31 complex (16Matsuoka K. Orci L. Amherdt M. Bednarek S.Y. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. Yeung T. Cell. 1998; 93: 263-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated biochemically that the recruitment of the Sec23/24 coat complex to ER membranes requires Sar1 activation and ATP (3Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 7Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 875-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 17Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4389-4399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, and as expected, ATP is also required for the recruitment of Sec13/31 (13Lee T.H. Linstedt A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2577-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). One possible explanation of the need for ATP was that ER membranes need to be primed with ATP prior to Sar1 activation and COPII recruitment. Alternatively, Sar1 activation may be initiated prior to the ATP-dependent step, which is then required for Sec23/24 recruitment and coat assembly. To test these two possibilities, ER membranes were incubated in a “stage 1” reaction in the presence of crude cytosol with or without ATP and/or the nonhydrolyzable form of GTP, GTPγS, for 10 min at 32 °C as described previously (7Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 875-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). Following incubation, the membranes were either transferred to ice or collected by centrifugation, the latter being resuspended for further incubation in “stage 2” in the presence or absence of ATP or GTPγS for an additional 10 min at 32 °C prior to transfer to ice. At the end of the incubation, the membranes were then collected by centrifugation, solubilized, and analyzed for Sec23/24 recruitment using immunoblotting (7Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 875-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, preincubation of ER membranes in the presence of cytosol led to COPII recruitment (as analyzed by Sec23 binding); this occurred only in the presence of both ATP and GTPγS, the latter being necessary to activate the endogenous cytosolic Sar1 (7Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 875-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Moreover, a similar pattern was observed in the stage 2 incubation, as Sec23/24 binding to the membranes was not detected when membranes were primed with ATP alone nor when endogenous cytosolic Sar1 was first activated by the addition of GTPγS in the stage 1 incubation. Therefore, Sar1 activation cannot be separated from the ATP-dependent step. The above results suggested that ATP may be required for Sar1 recruitment and activation. To analyze this possibility directly, we measured the recruitment of both Sar1 and Sec23/24 to membranes by using purified Sar1 and Sec23/24 COPII subunits. To assure membrane-dependent Sar1 activation, we utilized recombinant wild type Sar1 and supplemented all incubations with GDP (100 μm) in the presence or absence of GTPγS (100 μm). We have previously demonstrated that the mammalian Sar1 has a 10-fold higher affinity for GDP over GTP, assuring that only GEF-driven activation of Sar1 is measured in our assay (18Kuge O. Dascher C. Orci L. Rowe T. Amherdt M. Plutner H. Ravazzola M. Tanigawa G. Rothman J.E. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated in the presence or absence of ATP, with or without GTPγS, and in the presence of crude cytosol or wild type Sar1 and Sec23/24 subunits for 15 min at 32 °C. At the end of the incubation, the reactions were layered on top of a 15% sucrose cushion and centrifuged to remove the unbound COPII components from the membrane-bound forms. The recruitment of endogenous cytosolic Sar1 was dependent on the addition of GTPγS and ATP (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, when purified COPII components were utilized, efficient membrane binding of Sar1 required both the addition of ATP and GTPγS. Therefore, the Sar1 recruitment and activation step involving GTP, which initiates COPII assembly, requires ATP. The dependence of Sar1 on ATP suggests the possible involvement of a protein kinase activity in the initiation of ER export. Two recent reports have suggested that the kinase inhibitor H89 could block general ER-to-Golgi traffic, whereas a variety of other kinase inhibitors had no detectable affect (12Jamora C. Yamanouye N. Van Lint J. Laudenslager J. Vandenheede J.R. Faulkner D.J. Malhotra V. Cell. 1999; 98: 59-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 13Lee T.H. Linstedt A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2577-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To determine whether the H89-sensitive kinase affected the first step, Sar1 binding to the membranes, we incubated microsomal membranes in the presence of ATP, GTPγS, purified Sar1, Sec23/24, and increasing concentrations of the kinase inhibitor H89. H89 abolished both Sar1 and the subsequent Sec23/24 interaction with the membranes at a K i of 25 μm (Fig. 2 A). The inhibition of Sar1 recruitment led to a parallel inhibition of Sec23/24 recruitment, albeit at a slightly higher H89 concentration (Fig. 2 B). As Sec23/24 recruitment is absolutely dependent on Sar1 activation (3Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 7Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 875-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 8Rowe T. Aridor M. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 895-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the increased concentration of H89 required to block Sec23/24 recruitment may reflect the minimal levels of Sar1 activity sufficient to support maximal Sec23/24 recruitment. A similar inhibition of Sec23/24 and Sar1 recruitment was observed when whole cytosol was utilized (not shown). We next analyzed the role of the H89-sensitive kinase in regulating cargo export from the ER. We utilized an in vitro budding assay containing ER microsomes incubated with the purified COPII coat components Sar1, Sec23/24, and Sec13/31 to focus directly on the ER export step involving the kinase (3Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 8Rowe T. Aridor M. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 895-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), thereby eliminating the possibility that inhibition reflects COPI-dependent recycling steps from the Golgi. The assay follows the mobilization of a reporter cargo molecule, VSV-G, which is released from dense ER membranes into a more slowly sedimenting COPII-containing vesicle fraction, using differential centrifugation. Microsomes were incubated with the purified COPII components in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of H89. As we have previously reported, the addition of purified COPII led to efficient mobilization of VSV-G to the vesicle fraction (∼15–30%) (Fig.3 A, lane 2, compare medium speed (M) with high speed (H)), similar to the amount of VSV-G that is mobilized to vesicles when microsomes are incubated with whole cytosol (not shown) (3Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Incubation of microsomes with increasing concentrations of H89 led to the complete inhibition of cargo export from the ER at a concentration consistent with its ability to block Sar1 recruitment (Fig. 2). Given that H89 is a specific inhibitor of PKA at nanomolar concentration, whereas the concentration of H89 required to inhibit COPII recruitment was in the μm range, it is unlikely that protein kinase A was the target for H89 inhibition. Indeed, related inhibitors of PKA such as H8 or KT5720 do not inhibit ER-to-Golgi transport (13Lee T.H. Linstedt A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2577-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have analyzed the effects of a specific protein kinase A peptide inhibitor, PKI (K i, 36 nm). Concentrations of up to 250 nm PKI failed to affect Sar1 and Sec23/24 recruitment (Fig.2 C) or COPII vesicle formation (Fig. 3 B, see below). These results are consistent with the inability of other PKA inhibitors to block ER-to-Golgi transport (12Jamora C. Yamanouye N. Van Lint J. Laudenslager J. Vandenheede J.R. Faulkner D.J. Malhotra V. Cell. 1999; 98: 59-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 13Lee T.H. Linstedt A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2577-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). H89 was also utilized previously as an inhibitor of serine/threonine kinases of the PKC family. However, related inhibitors such as H7 or chelerythrine do not affect ER-to-Golgi transport (13Lee T.H. Linstedt A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2577-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent morphological observations raised the possibility that the μ isozyme of protein kinase C (PKD) involved Golgi disassembly may also be involved in the transport of VSV-G between the ER and the Golgi (12Jamora C. Yamanouye N. Van Lint J. Laudenslager J. Vandenheede J.R. Faulkner D.J. Malhotra V. Cell. 1999; 98: 59-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Like the PKI peptide substrate, using a specific PKD peptide substrate to antagonize PKD function, we failed to interfere with COPII vesicle budding compared with that observed for the control, scrambled peptide (Fig.3 B, lanes 3–5). PKD peptides also failed to inhibit Sar1 and Sec23/24 recruitment to membranes (Fig.2 C). Thus, although the identity of the H89-sensitive kinase(s) involved in ER export remains unknown, it does not appear to be either PKA or the isoform of PKD that mediates Golgi disassembly (12Jamora C. Yamanouye N. Van Lint J. Laudenslager J. Vandenheede J.R. Faulkner D.J. Malhotra V. Cell. 1999; 98: 59-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) nor a host of other known kinases (13Lee T.H. Linstedt A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2577-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It is also unlikely to involve phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)-lipid kinases as we have previously shown that wortmannin, a PI3-specific inhibitor, has no effect on the export of either soluble or transmembrane cargo from the ER (19Brown W.J. DeWald D.B. Emr S.D. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Other soluble lipid kinases, including PI4-kinases, are unlikely to be involved given that we were unable to prime membranes by preincubating them with ATP. Furthermore, the addition of purified COPII components, in the absence of cytosol, supports efficient export. However, further experiments are necessary to address the potential role of lipid kinases, as a PI4-kinase of unknown function has been demonstrated to be enriched on ER membranes (20Wong K. Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13236-13241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that an H89-sensitive kinase initiates Sar1 recruitment, the first step in COPII vesicle formation. Our conclusions differ significantly from a recent report in which H89 was proposed to affect a late, but not early, step in COPII vesicle formation (13Lee T.H. Linstedt A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2577-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); that report based its conclusion on experimental results in which H89 was observed to inhibit GTPγS stabilization of the Sec13/31 complex to membranes. It was assumed that the inclusion of GTPγS in the assay was sufficient for passive Sar1 activation. In contrast, we now demonstrate that the recruitment and activation of Sar1 by GTPγS is dependent on ATP and inhibited by H89. These results are consistent with the requirement for physiological temperatures for recruitment of COPII to membranes in vitro and with the relatively low affinity of Sar1 for guanine triphosphate nucleotides in the absence of a Sar1 specific exchange activity (3Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 7Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 875-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 8Rowe T. Aridor M. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 895-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 17Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4389-4399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, Sar1 binding of GTPγS is not passive and requires the Sec12 GEF. Consistent with this observation, in the present experiments we have observed that in the absence of Sar1 activation by Sec12, the recruitment of the Sec23/24 complex, and as a consequence, the subsequent recruitment of the Sec13/31 complex, cannot occur. Indeed, the inability morphologically to detect ER export sites using indirect immunofluorescence based on the detection of recruited Sec13/31 complex (13Lee T.H. Linstedt A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2577-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), is entirely consistent with our results that demonstrate that the primary step affected by the H89-sensitive kinase is the first step, Sar1 recruitment and activation. Control of small GTPase activation by kinases is not unprecedented. Activation of Ras through the recruitment of the Grb2·SOS GEF complex is initiated by protein tyrosine kinases (21Scita G. Tenca P. Frittoli E. Tocchetti A. Innocenti M. Giardina G. Di Fiore P.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy to Ras, recruitment and activation of Sar1 through Sec12, a transmembrane GEF, may be regulated by a membrane-associated kinase. This conclusion is consistent with our observations that recruitment of Sar1 is the limiting component in our budding reaction (3Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In preliminary in vitro experiments we have failed to detect direct phosphorylation of either Sar1 or Sec12 during the formation of COPII vesicles. However, further studies are required to establish or preclude a role for Sar1 or Sec12 phosphorylation during these potentially transient events involved in coat assembly. Alternatively, our previous studies have suggested a role for cargo in modulating the COPII export machinery (17Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4389-4399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although it remains to be seen whether cargo availability per se can regulate kinase and Sar1 activation, ER chaperones, which interact with cargo during the folding cascade, may mediate these events, thereby linking cargo availability to ER export. This interpretation is consistent with the role of the ER resident chaperone Ig heavy chain-binding protein (BIP) in activation of ER stress receptor kinases in response to misfolded cargo in the ER (22Sidrauski C. Chapman R. Walter P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), an event that leads to a global up-regulation of the exocytic pathway (23Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). Additional targets for kinase activity may therefore include proteins of the ER folding and selection machinery that can interact with cargo prior to its association with the recruited COPII coat (24Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 25Herrmann J.M. Malkus P. Schekman R. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 5-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 26Aridor M. Balch W.E. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Placing ER budding under kinase control would allow the export machinery to respond to extracellular signaling pathways, thus integrating the secretory pathway with cellular physiology. We have previously demonstrated that activation of IgE receptors in mast cell lines enhances ER export (27Bannykh S. Aridor M. Plutner H. Rowe T. Balch W.E. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; LX: 127-137Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and that ER export is regulated by a calphostin C-sensitive, diacylglycerol-binding protein (28Fabbri M. Bannykh S. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26848-26857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that modulation of kinase activity plays a major role during mitosis, leading to cessation of ER export and dispersal of ER export sites (29Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We propose that the ability of the ER export machinery to integrate with kinase signaling cascades may represent an important first step in the general function of cargo selection by COPII machinery in the exocytic pathway in mammalian cells (26Aridor M. Balch W.E. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). We thank Dr. Vivek Malhotra for PKD peptide inhibitors and valuable discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2117158748,"We showed that muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh)-stimulation increased the cellular content of cADPR in the pancreatic acinar cells from normal mice but not in those from CD38 knockout mice. By monitoring ACh-evoked increases in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] i) using fura-2 microfluorimetry, we distinguished and characterized the Ca2+ release mechanisms responsive to cADPR. The Ca2+ response from the cells of the knockout mice (KO cells) lacked two components of the muscarinic Ca2+ release present in wild mice. The first component inducible by the low concentration of ACh contributed to regenerative Ca2+spikes. This component was abolished by ryanodine treatment in the normal cells and was severely impaired in KO cells, indicating that the low ACh-induced regenerative spike responses were caused by cADPR-dependent Ca2+ release from a pool regulated by a class of ryanodine receptors. The second component inducible by the high concentration of ACh was involved in the phasic Ca2+ response, and it was not abolished by ryanodine treatment. Overall, we conclude that muscarinic Ca2+signaling in pancreatic acinar cells involves a CD38-dependent pathway responsible for two cADPR-dependent Ca2+ release mechanisms in which the one sensitive to ryanodine plays a crucial role for the generation of repetitive Ca2+ spikes. We showed that muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh)-stimulation increased the cellular content of cADPR in the pancreatic acinar cells from normal mice but not in those from CD38 knockout mice. By monitoring ACh-evoked increases in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] i) using fura-2 microfluorimetry, we distinguished and characterized the Ca2+ release mechanisms responsive to cADPR. The Ca2+ response from the cells of the knockout mice (KO cells) lacked two components of the muscarinic Ca2+ release present in wild mice. The first component inducible by the low concentration of ACh contributed to regenerative Ca2+spikes. This component was abolished by ryanodine treatment in the normal cells and was severely impaired in KO cells, indicating that the low ACh-induced regenerative spike responses were caused by cADPR-dependent Ca2+ release from a pool regulated by a class of ryanodine receptors. The second component inducible by the high concentration of ACh was involved in the phasic Ca2+ response, and it was not abolished by ryanodine treatment. Overall, we conclude that muscarinic Ca2+signaling in pancreatic acinar cells involves a CD38-dependent pathway responsible for two cADPR-dependent Ca2+ release mechanisms in which the one sensitive to ryanodine plays a crucial role for the generation of repetitive Ca2+ spikes. cyclic ADP-ribose inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate acetylcholine cytosolic Ca2+ concentration CD38 knockout cells Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR),1 first found in sea urchin eggs, mobilizes Ca2+ by a mechanism independent of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) pathway (1Clapper D.L.

That both cADPR and its synthetic enzyme are ubiquitously present in mammalian and invertebrate tissues (9Walseth T.F. Aarthus R. Zeleznikar Jr., R.J. Lee Jr., H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1094: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 10Rusinko N. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11725-11731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that cADPR is a type of cellular Ca2+-mobilizing messenger, playing a role in Ca2+ signaling in a variety of cells. The best characterized mediator for the signal is IP3 (11Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6136) Google Scholar), and the possibility has been raised that cADPR is a different class of mediator. How cells differentiate between these signals is a question of fundamental importance. One possibility is that they act on their respective receptors in different Ca2+ pools. The major purpose of the present study is to determine their contributions to overall Ca2+ signaling. We started by depicting the precise concentration response curves for Ca2+ mobilization with or without cADPR. This could be achieved by using CD38 knockout mice because the majority of cADPR has been ascribed to the activity of ADP-ribosyl cyclase of CD38 (12Takasawa S. Tohgo A. Noguchi N. Koguma T. Nata K. Sugimoto T. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26052-27054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By estimating the change in the cellular content of cADPR and monitoring the muscarinic Ca2+ response in pancreatic acinar cells, either from normal or CD38 knockout mice (13Kato I. Yamamoto Y. Fujimura M. Noguchi N. Takasawa S. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1869-1872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), we have successfully separated the CD38- and therefore cADPR-dependent component from the inositol phosphate-sensitive component. Thus, this paper provides insight into the mechanism of cADPR-dependent Ca2+ mobilization mediated by CD38 activities, which is independent of IP3-dependent Ca2+mobilization in muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor signaling. Mice lacking CD38 were generated by homologous recombination. The generation and genotyping of the mice have been described in detail previously (13Kato I. Yamamoto Y. Fujimura M. Noguchi N. Takasawa S. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1869-1872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The mice used for each experiment were derived from ICR background and were from the same litter or the same family. Fragments of pancreatic tissue from both normal ICR (CD38+/+) and CD38 knockout ICR mice (CD38−/−) were excised and treated with enzymes at 37 °C. Single pancreatic acinar cells used for the fluorescence and/or whole-cell current measurements were prepared using collagenase (200 units/ml; Wako, Osaka, Japan) for 3 min and trypsin (0.5 mg/ml; Sigma type XI) for 2 min and then with the same collagenase for 1 min, similar to the procedure described previously (14Maruyama Y. Petersen O.H. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The pancreatic acini used for the measurements of the cell content of cADPR and IP3 were prepared using collagenase (1000 units/ml) alone for 10 min. We used a Ca2+-free solution to avoid any contribution of external Ca2+ to the signaling in pancreatic acinar cells. The Ca2+-free solution contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 4.2 KCl, 1.13 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 adjusted with NaOH). Fluorescence experiments were carried out using a solution containing 0.5 mm EGTA. Pretreatment of the cells with ryanodine (Calbiochem) was performed at 37 °C for 5 min using the Ca2+-free solution (15Fukushi Y. Ozawa T. Nishiyama A. Kase H. Wakui M. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 1996; 178: 399-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The reagent was removed by washing the cells several times with the experimental solution before the fluorescence measurements (16Fukushi Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 364: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The single pancreatic acinar cells were incubated with 1 μmfura-2/AM (Dojin Chemical Institute, Kumamoto, Japan) for 40 min at 37 °C and then washed several times with the normal solution and kept at room temperature until use. The cells, attached to a glass coverslip, were placed in a small chamber (400 μl) mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope and perfused continuously (0.5 ml/min) with a stream of the experimental solution. This arrangement permitted a rapid exchange of the bathing solution (17Fukushi Y. Ozawa T. Wakui M. Nishiyama A. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 1995; 176: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The fluorescence was measured by an epifluorescence inverted microscope system described previously (18Ikeda M. Kurokawa K. Maruyama Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 447: 711-728Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Fukushi Y. Ozawa T. Kanno T. Wakui M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 336: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Single acinar cells were alternately illuminated at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm by a rotating sector mirror at 3-ms—1-s intervals. The emission was monitored at 510 nm. Cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] i) changes were monitored as changes in the fluorescence ratio for excitation at 340 and 380 nm (F340/F380). The [Ca2+] i was determined from the ratio of fluorescence traces at the two excitation wavelengths (340/380 nm) (20Grynkiewicz G. Ponie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The single pancreatic acinar cells were subjected to standard whole-cell patch-clamp recordings for the injection of reagents (IP3, cADPR, and Ca2+), in a manner similar to the procedure described previously (21Maruyama Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 417: 343-359Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Okamoto H. Takasawa S. Tohgo A. Nata K. Kato I. Noguchi N. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 306-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes were pulled from plain hematocrit glass capillaries by a two-stage puller (PP-83, Narishige, Tokyo) coated with beeswax. The current signals were amplified by a List EPC-7 amplifier (List Electronics, Darmstadt, Germany), appropriately low pass filtered (200–500 Hz) and displayed on an oscilloscope screen and a digital chart recorder. The cells were immersed with external solution containing (mm): 145 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES at pH 7.2 (by NaOH). Patch pipettes were filled with a solution (pipette solution) containing (mm): 144 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 0.1 EGTA, 10 HEPES at pH 7.2 (by NaOH). For loading of the reagents, 20 μm cADPR (Molecular Probes), 20 μmIP3 (Wako, Osaka), or 200 μmCaCl2 were included in the pipette solution. In the last case, EGTA was eliminated from the pipette solution. The pipette resistance when filled with the pipette solution was 3–5 megaohms. The establishment of the whole-cell recordings was monitored with repetitive voltage pulses superimposed on the holding potential, and it appeared as a sudden increase of capacitative current during the application of a train of short suction onto the patch pipette. The pulses were interrupted soon after the current responses started. The series resistance of the whole-cell recordings was 10–15 megaohms, which was measured with a trimmer system of the amplifier after the current response evoked by the reagent recovered to the resting level. All the experiments were carried out at room temperature (24 °C). Proteins were extracted with 9 volumes of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 supplemented with CompleteTM (one table/50 ml, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) from mouse tissues. The proteins (50 μg) were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. After blocking with 5% skim milk, the membrane was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with an anti-CD38 polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide fragment of mouse CD38 (residues 283–301, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The concentration of antibody was 0.4 μg/ml with 5% skim milk. After rinsing, the membrane was further incubated at room temperature for 1 h with a secondary antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase and developed using an ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (6Takasawa S. Ishida A. Nata K. Nakagawa K. Noguchi N. Tohgo A. Kato I. Yonekura H. Fujisawa H. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30257-30259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Okamoto H. Takasawa S. Tohgo A. Nata K. Kato I. Noguchi N. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 306-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The cADPR content was measured in either the presence or absence of ACh as described (23Takasawa S. Akiyama T. Nata K. Kuroki M. Tohgo A. Noguchi N. Kobayashi S. Kato I. Katada T. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2497-2500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, the suspension of enzymatically dispersed pancreatic acini (about 20 mg wet weight/ml) in 1-ml test tubes was incubated for 60 s (with or without ACh), the supernatant was discarded after centrifugation at 600 × g for 1 min at 4 °C, and the preparation was then stocked at −80 °C. The acinar preparation was homogenized in 9 volumes of perchloric acid solution (2.5%, v/v). The homogenates were stored at −80 °C and later defrosted and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g. The supernatant (330–350 μl) of the homogenates was then mixed with 150 μl of a suspension of Norit A (27 mg/ml in H2O, Nacalai tesque, Kyoto, Japan). After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the samples were again centrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed three times with 1.0 ml of H2O, resuspended in a pyridine-ethanol-H2O mixture (10:50:40, v/v/v), and incubated for 120 min at 37 °C. After a further centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and evaporated (Speedvac, Savant Instrument Inc., Farmingdale, NY). The evaporated materials eluted from Norit A charcoal were resuspended with 50 μl of H2O and then incubated at 25 °C for 2 h with bovine alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) and venom phosphodiesterase (Worthington Biochemical) at final concentrations of 50 and 2 units/ml, respectively, in 100 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 400 mm KCl. This enzyme treatment was effective for degrading nucleotides that weakly cross-react with the anti-cADPR antibody (24Takahashi K. Kukimoto I. Tokita K. Inageda K. Inoue S. Kontani K. Hoshino S. Nishina H. Kanaho Y. Katada T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by adding a solution of trichloroacetic acid (at a final concentration of 4%, w/v) and kept on ice for 20 min. A clear supernatant was obtained after centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 10 min. An aliquot (10–20 μl) of the supernatant was immediately neutralized with a solution of 2 m Tris base and subjected to the procedure of cADPR measurement. As a control, another aliquot was heated at 95 °C for 10 min before being neutralized and analyzed by the radioimmunoassay. This heat treatment converted cADPR to ADP-ribose, resulting in no cross-reaction with the anti-cADPR antibody. The immunoreactivity of all the samples was abolished by the heat treatment. The recovery of cADPR, monitored by the recovery of [3H]cADPR added in each homogenate, was 74.2 ± 2.92% (n = 8). Correction was introduced for the recovery of cADPR. The cellular content of IP3 was estimated with ad-myo-inositol 1,4,5-[3H]trisphosphate assay system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) either in the presence or absence of ACh. The suspension of enzymatically dispersed pancreatic acini (about 20 mg wet weight/ml) in 1-ml test tubes was incubated for 60 s (with or without ACh), the supernatant was discarded after centrifugation at 600 × g for 1 min at 4 °C, and the preparation was then stocked at −80 °C. The cells were homogenized in 200 ml of ice-cold 10% (v/v) perchloric acid with an ultrasonic processor (Astrason®, Heat Systems, Farmingdale, NY) for 10 s. Then, the samples were neutralized by the addition of 1.5 mKOH, 60 mm HEPES. After sedimentation of KClO4by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was used for the IP3 measurement. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical significance was analyzed with Student's t test. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. By Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody against mouse CD38, we detected no CD38 expression in the pancreatic acinar cells from CD38 knockout mice, but its expression was detected from those of the wild type mice (Fig.1 A). In addition, by radioimmunoassay, we scarcely detected cADPR in the cells from the knockout mice, but it was detected in the wild type mice (Fig.1 B). Thus, the majority of the cellular cADPR content was caused by the activity of the ADP-ribosyl cyclase of CD38. Fig. 2 shows the changes in the cellular content of cADPR (Fig. 2 A) and IP3 (Fig. 2 B) in response to ACh ranging from 40 nm to 4 μm. The cADPR content was increased by the ACh stimulation in the acini from wild mice but not in those from the knockout mice. In contrast, the IP3 content was increased similarly in both types of acini. However, we were not certain that the method employed to measure the cADPR and IP3 contents was sensitive enough to detect the difference in content at different ACh concentrations. The difference is shown in later sections in terms of changes in the cellular Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+] i) by fura-2 microfluorimetry. Pancreatic acinar cells possess two types of Ca2+ activated ion channels (25Maruyama Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 406: 299-313Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). One is selective for monovalent cations (26Maruyama Y. Petersen O.H. Nature. 1982; 299: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 27Maruyama Y. Petersen O.H. Nature. 1982; 300: 61-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and the other for Cl−, and both are poorly dependent on membrane potentials between −60 mV and 60 mV but highly dependent on [Ca2+] i (25Maruyama Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 406: 299-313Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Thus, increases and decreases of [Ca2+] i should be reflected by the activity of these channels. To demonstrate the presence of normal Ca2+release mechanisms responsible for IP3 (28Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 29Maruyama Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 463: 729-746Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (30Marty A. Tan Y.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 419: 665-687Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 31Wakui M. Osipchuk Y.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1990; 63: 1025-1032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and cADPR-mediated signaling, we injected these reagents directly into the single cells with the whole-cell recording technique and monitored the Ca2+-dependent current activities (Ca2+ responses). Here, at a holding potential of −40 mV achieved by the whole-cell recordings, Ca2+-dependent current responses were expected to emerge as large inward currents carried by both Cl− and monovalent cations. Shortly after the establishment of the whole-cell recordings (delay of 1–3 s) when the pipette included IP3, cADPR, or Ca2+, we observed a large deflection of the inward current at the membrane potential of −40 mV (Fig.3, 3/3 in each reagent injections). However, without the reagents there were no responses (3/3). That all the reagents successfully induced Ca2+ responses in the single acinar cells from both the wild and knockout mice indicated that the Ca2+ releasing machinery was well preserved in both types of cells. Close inspection of the records revealed that there might have been differences between the responses of the wild type and knockout cells to cADPR and/or IP3. That is, there was a longer response to cADPR and a shorter response to IP3 in the knockout cells than in those of the wild type. The reduction in cADPR hydrolase activity in the knockout pancreatic acinar cells (13Kato I. Yamamoto Y. Fujimura M. Noguchi N. Takasawa S. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1869-1872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) may explain their prolonged response to cADPR. The cooperative action of cADPR for enhancing IP3-induced Ca2+ responses (32Thorn P. Gerasimenko O. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2038-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) may explain the shortened response to IP3 because cADPR was eliminated in the knockout cells. However, further study is needed to determine the precise mechanisms of the reagent sensitivity. Based on the above results, we employed fura-2 microfluorimetry and compared the ACh-induced pancreatic Ca2+ responses of the wild (CD38+/+) and CD38 knockout mice (CD38−/−) in a wide range of ACh concentrations from 10 to 20,000 nm. We used a Ca2+-free solution containing 0.5 mm EGTA to avoid any contribution of external Ca2+ to the signaling in pancreatic acinar cells in the later experiments with fura-2 microfluorimetry. Table I summarizes the results in terms of the peak magnitude, the onset time after the application of ACh, and the frequency of the periodic responses. The real traces of the responses are shown in Fig.4 for 40 and 400 nm ACh.Table IMagnitude, frequency, and onset of Ca 2+ release induced by ACh in single pancreatic acinar cells of CD38 +/+ and CD38 −/− miceAChMagnitudeFrequencyOnsetμmnmper minsCD38+/+ 0.01 (n = 50)21.6 ± 6.1 0.02 (n = 20)100.5 ± 7.32.60 ± 0.3223.3 ± 3.9 0.04 (n = 57)228.8 ± 19.93.00 ± 0.4919.4 ± 1.4 0.4 (n = 126)230.4 ± 7.71.93 ± 0.1719.4 ± 1.2 4 (n = 68)379.4 ± 17.610.6 ± 0.6 20 (n = 28)363.8 ± 21.97.6 ± 0.5CD38−/− 0.01 (n = 44)14.5 ± 2.2 0.02 (n = 31)19.9 ± 3.71-ap < 0.001 different from control value.0.06 ± 0.001-ap < 0.001 different from control value.55.1 ± 8.91-ap < 0.001 different from control value. 0.04 (n = 116)82.8 ± 5.21-ap < 0.001 different from control value.0.78 ± 0.041-ap < 0.001 different from control value.32.3 ± 4.91-ap < 0.001 different from control value. 0.4 (n = 89)215.0 ± 11.61.10 ± 0.1722.7 ± 1.8 4 (n = 86)283.2 ± 8.61-bp < 0.01 different from control value.13.1 ± 1.5 20 (n = 56)301.5 ± 8.51-bp < 0.01 different from control value.7.6 ± 0.9Prestimulating level CD38+/+ (n = 267)143.2 ± 3.2 CD38−/− (n = 292)151.3 ± 3.1Each value is expressed as means ± S.E.

Open table in a new tab Each value is expressed as means ± S.E. Magnitude was measured by subtracting the prestimulated level of [Ca2+] i from the peak response. The threshold concentration of ACh that induced a detectable Ca2+ response was 10 nm, and the response was a transient deflection with no significant difference observed in the two types of pancreatic acinar cells. A difference appeared at 40 nm ACh. Immediately after the application of 40 nm ACh, the cells from CD38+/+ mice showed a repetitive Ca2+ response (oscillations) during the ACh application, lasting for 2–3 min. In contrast, that of CD38−/− was sporadic with the same ACh stimulation (Fig. 4 A). However, at 400 nm ACh, the difference between the responses from CD38+/+ and CD38−/− mice became less than that at 40 nmACh, and both responses showed large phasic increases in the fura-2 signals (Fig. 4 B). The numerical data of the [Ca2+] i increases in Table I were plotted against the ACh concentration (Ca2+response curve) in Fig. 5, Aand B. The magnitude response curve from the knockout mice (CD38−/−) was smoothly graded with the increasing ACh concentrations. However, that of CD38+/+ showed two prominent phases separated at the concentration of 400 nmACh. This feature was also seen in the Ca2+ index (18Ikeda M. Kurokawa K. Maruyama Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 447: 711-728Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), which reflects the mixed information of both the magnitude and frequency of the response. Both response curves were replotted in Fig.5, C and D, where the Ca2+ response from the knockout mice (CD38−/−) was subtracted from that of the wild type (CD38+/+) at each ACh concentration. Two prominent peaks were seen in the diagrams at the values of 40 and 4000 nm, indicating that two CD38-dependent phases, in other words, two cADPR-dependent phases, separated at 400 nm, are present in the ACh-induced release of internal Ca2+. One was induced by low ACh concentrations up to 400 nm (the first cADPR-dependent component) and the other by high concentrations of ACh over 400 nm (the second cADPR-dependent component). Because cADPR has been postulated to be an endogenous modulator of the ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release mechanism (33Mészáros L.G. Bak J. Chu A. Nature. 1993; 364: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 34Lee H.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 35Ozawa T. Nishiyama A. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we next examined the effect of ryanodine on the pancreatic ACh-induced Ca2+responses from normal cells. The results were compared with the Ca2+ responses from the knockout cells. Fig. 6 shows the fura-2 signals in both types of cells treated either with or without ryanodine (500 μm) prior to the ACh stimulation (40 or 400 nm). The 40 nm ACh stimulation, without ryanodine, induced repetitive and sporadic transient responses in the wild and knockout mice, respectively, as described in Fig.4 A. In contrast, with ryanodine, the same stimulation induced a sporadic transient response and no response in the wild and knockout mice, respectively. Comparing these records, we noticed that the response to 40 nm ACh stimulation in the wild type cells with ryanodine resembled that of knockout mice without ryanodine (Fig. 6 A). The diagram in Fig. 6 Csummarizes the effects of ryanodine on the ACh-induced Ca2+responses in pancreatic acinar cells from the wild mice, showing that ryanodine abolished the first cADPR-dependent component but not the second component. The complex effects of ryanodine on the knockout cells depended on the ACh concentration. That is, at concentrations of ACh from 10 to 400 nm, we could not detect any significant effect of ryanodine on the magnitude of the Ca2+ response in knockout cells (Fig. 6 D). In contrast, it enhanced the response at concentrations of ACh over 400 nm. It was noteworthy that the respective concentrations of ACh corresponded to the first and second cADPR-dependent components normally present in the wild type cells. The effect of ryanodine at concentrations of ACh corresponding to the first cADPR-dependent component could be interpreted as indicating either that ryanodine treatment depletes the first cADPR-sensitive Ca2+ pool or that it inhibits the Ca2+ release from the pool. Either interpretation could be deduced from the result that ryanodine eliminated the first cADPR-dependent component from the wild cells and was without effect on the knockout cells. However, we prefer the first interpretation because the basal [Ca2+] i level was higher in the ryanodine-treated cells than that in both the wild and knockout cells without the treatment. The basal [Ca2+] i without ryanodine was 143.2 ± 3.2 nm (n = 269) in the wild cells and 151.3 ± 3.1 nm (n = 292) in the knockout cells. With ryanodine it was 234.6 ± 4.6 nm(n = 68) in the wild cells and 247.5 ± 2.6 nm (n = 87) in the knockout cells. Comparing the ACh-induced Ca2+ responses in pancreatic acinar cells from normal mice (CD38+/+ wild type: normal cells) with those of CD38 knockout mice (CD38−/− type: KO cells), we distinguished the CD38- and therefore cADPR-dependent component from the overall muscarinic Ca2+ signaling. The major findings are that: 1) ACh stimulation increased the cellular content of cADPR in the normal cells but not in KO cells; 2) the Ca2+ response curve in the normal cells was separated into two phases at 400 nm ACh; 3) in contrast, the Ca2+ response curve from KO cells was a smoothly graded one, and it lacked the two components inducible by ACh at concentrations below 400 nm (the first cADPR-dependent component) and over 400 nm (the second cADPR-dependent component) usually present in normal cells; 4) the first cADPR-dependent component contributed to the generation of repetitive Ca2+ spikes; 5) ryanodine treatment eliminated the first cADPR-dependent component (Fig. 6). IP3 and cADPR are established Ca2+-mobilizing messengers that activate internal IP3 and ryanodine receptors, respectively (36Taylor C. Marshall I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 403-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 37Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 38Berridge M.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 56: 291-306Crossref Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Because we scarcely detected cADPR formation in KO cells, the majority of Ca2+ release in these cells could arise from Ca2+ pools insensitive to cADPR but sensitive to IP3 and/or yet unknown messengers. Thus, the IP3-sensitive pool obviously plays an important role in pancreatic Ca2+ responses, and it steadily contributes to the Ca2+ release in a wide range of ACh concentrations as evidenced by the smoothly graded response curve from KO cells in Fig.5 A. The superposition of cADPR on IP3 and/or yet unknown messengers manifested two prominences on the curve, suggesting the presence of two subdivisions of cADPR-sensitive Ca2+pools (the first and second cADPR-dependent components described above). The first cADPR-dependent Ca2+ pool is strictly sensitive to ryanodine, but the second one is rather resistant as evidenced by Fig. 6 C. A large part of the Ca2+ release is from the first cADPR-dependent pool at concentrations of ACh up to 40 nm, as shown in Table I and Fig. 4. The contribution of this pool promotes the sharp repetitive spikes (Fig. 4 A), which could be advantageous for the fine control of Ca2+-dependent cell function (39Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3288) Google Scholar). That the repetitive spikes were severely impaired in the knockout mice suggests that they depend on cADPR formation. Thus, it could be that cADPR is one of the crucial messengers for maintaining the repetitive Ca2+ spikes. However, we cannot exclude the possible contribution of IP3. It has been reported in other cells that IP3 is generated in an oscillatory manner (40Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takashima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). We do not know the detailed pattern of cADPR and IP3 formation in our cells; however it is likely that the ACh stimulation generates both messengers in a repetitive or oscillatory fashion. The synchronized formation of these two messengers may generate various patterns of repetitive Ca2+ spikes under cooperation with increased cellular Ca2+, which is ascribed mainly to the first cADPR-dependent Ca2+ pool. The critical concentration of ACh that switched the mode of the Ca2+response from the repetitive spike to the phasic deflection was 400 nm (Table I, “Frequency”). Based on the above findings, it could be that the messenger formation is no longer repetitive but rather phasic over this concentration of ACh. The significance of the second cADPR-dependent Ca2+ pool could be that it serves as the resource of the phasic release of Ca2+. Ryanodine was able to induce Ca2+ release at an exceedingly high rate (Fig. 6 D) with concentrations of ACh over 400 nm in KO cells. This may have resulted from a complex mechanism that involves enhanced sensitivity to ryanodine in the second cADPR-sensitive Ca2+ pool. Such an enhancement may have arisen from the constant lack of cADPR in the KO cells (Fig.1 B). The presence of CD38 in the Ca2+ release mechanism is of particular importance. The CD38-mediated Ca2+ signaling may be associated directly with the receptor stimulation (Fig. 2 A). This signaling pathway may be separated from that of IP3 since both the formation of cADPR (Fig. 2 A) and its contribution to the Ca2+release (Fig. 5 A) are large at 40 nm ACh, at which concentration the contribution of IP3 is still low. It is likely that muscarinic stimulation activates both signaling pathways in parallel and that they contribute synergistically to the overall Ca2+ signaling in pancreatic acinar cells. However, the precise underlying mechanism of cADPR formation after the muscarinic ACh stimulation remains unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1996933769,"The two opposite signaling pathways that stimulate NF-kappaB activation and apoptosis are both mediated by tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and its cytosolic associated proteins. In this study, we demonstrate that the proteolytic cleavage of receptor interacting protein (RIP) by caspase-8 during TNF-induced apoptosis abrogates the stimulatory role of RIP on TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation. The uncleavable RIPD324A mutant was less apoptotic, but its ability to activate NF-kappaB activation was greater than the wild type counterpart. Ectopic expression of the pro-apoptotic C-terminal fragment of RIP inhibited TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation by suppressing the activity of I-kappaB kinasebeta (IKKbeta) which phosphorylates I-kB, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB, and triggers its ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The C-terminal fragment of RIP also enhanced the association between TNFR1 and death domain proteins including TNFR1 associated death domain (TRADD) and Fas associated death domain (FADD), resulting in the activation of caspase-8 and stimulation of apoptosis. The present study suggest that the C-terminal fragment of RIP produced by caspase-8 activates death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), attenuates NF-kappaB activation, and thereby amplifies the activation of caspase-8 which initiates the downstream apoptotic events.

The enzymes consist of two major parts: the membrane embedded hydrophobic F0 part involved in proton translocation across the membrane and the hydrophilic F1 part containing the nucleotide- and phosphate-binding sites (for review see Refs. 1Weber J.

Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 1966; 41: 445-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the reverse direction, the enzymes hydrolyze ATP and generate a transmembrane Δμ̃H+. Whereas in chloroplasts and mitochondria this direction is inhibited by special regulations (for review see Refs. 12Vinogradov A.D. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 41-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 13Kramer D.M. Wise R.R. Frederick J.R. Alm D.M. Hesketh J.D. Ort D.R. Crofts A.R. Photosynth. Res. 1990; 26: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), ATP hydrolysis has an important physiological function in bacteria.The proton motive force, Δp, is given by the following equation. Δp=ΔμH+F=−2.3RTFΔpH+ΔϕEquation 1 (ΔpH being the transmembrane pH difference and Δϕ the transmembrane electric potential difference). According to the chemiosmotic theory (11Mitchell P. Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 1966; 41: 445-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the two components of Δp are thermodynamically equivalent, i.e. a change of ΔpH by one unit will result in the same change of the ATP/ADP equilibrium as a shift of Δϕ by 59 mV (at 23 °C). For thylakoid membranes, chromatophores, and some bacterial F0F1-ATPases, it appears that ΔpH and Δϕ are also kinetically equivalent, i.e. the rate of ATP synthesis is changed by the same factor when either Δϕ is changed by 59 mV or ΔpH is changed by one unit (14Gräber P.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 14: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 19Gräber P. Schlodder E. Witt H.T. Biochim. Biophys.

Melandri B.A. Gräber P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11057-11063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This phenomenon is called Δμ̃H+ activation, or only activation and occurs also under physiological conditions (24Ort D.R. Oxborough K. Annu. Rev. Plant. Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 46: 269-291Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This physiological regulation of the activity has to be distinguished from treatments (with lauryl dimethylamine oxide (LDAO), trypsin, or heat, for example) that increase the rate of ATP hydrolysis by partial denaturation of the enzyme and are sometimes also called activation. The fraction of active enzymes increases with increasing Δμ̃H+ and the two components, ΔpH and Δϕ, appear to be equivalent in this respect in chloroplasts (14Gräber P. Junesch U. Schatz G.H. Ber. Bunsenges. Physik. Chem. 1984; 88: 599-608Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus, Δϕ is more effective than ΔpH (23Turina P. Rumberg B. Melandri B.A. Gräber P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11057-11063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and there are indications that in mitochondria this might also be the case (21Harris D.A. von Tscharner V. Radda G.K.

The stability of the metastable active state is influenced by a variety of parameters, like ADP, Mg2+, and Pi concentration, and in chloroplasts F0F1-ATP synthase also by the redox state of the enzyme (14Gräber P.

(29Fischer S. Etzold C. Turina P. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Gräber P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 30Fischer S. Gräber P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the data gave hints that the E. coli enzyme too might be activated by Δμ̃H+. Therefore, we decided to investigate this phenomenon in more detail. Activation by Δμ̃H+ is detected most easily by measuring the increase of the uncoupled rate of ATP hydrolysis after the enzyme has been exposed to a Δμ̃H+ (31Junesch U. Gräber P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 275-288Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and with this reconstituted system we were able to carry out these experiments.RESULTSEF0F1 was reconstituted into liposomes at a concentration of 30 nm. The proteoliposomes were concentrated by centrifugation to about 1 μmEF0F1 and stored at room temperature for up to 3 days. The rate of ATP synthesis was measured before and after centrifugation and on every following day. Centrifugation caused about 45% loss of ATP synthesis activity, i.e. from 65 to 35 s−1. For comparison with our previous ATP synthesis data, all the following enzyme concentrations were corrected by this factor. A correction factor was also applied to compensate for the 10% loss of ATP synthesis activity observed after 3 days of storage.ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by proteoliposomes after centrifugation was measured with an ATP regenerating system in the absence and presence of uncouplers (nigericin and valinomycin). At 4 mmATP, the steady state rate in the absence of uncouplers was 40 s−1; it increased after addition of valinomycin to 80 s−1 and after addition of nigericin to 210 s−1. The 5-fold increase of the rate indicates that in the absence of uncouplers, proton transport-coupled ATP hydrolysis generates Δμ̃H+ across the membrane, and its back pressure limits the rate. When the proton permeability of the membrane was increased by the uncouplers nigericin and valinomycin, this back pressure was released, and the rate was increased. The stimulation by a factor 5 indicates a good coupling between ATP hydrolysis and proton transport, i.e. a good efficiency of reconstitution of the enzyme into the liposomes. The same experiment was carried out with 100 μm ATP. In this case, the coupled rate was 15 s−1 and was also increased 5-fold after uncoupling.Activation of ATP Hydrolysis by Δμ̃H+To investigate whether reconstituted EF0F1 can be activated by Δμ̃H+, the experiments were carried out as follows. EF0F1 proteoliposomes were incubated for 2 min in acidic medium, and Δμ̃H+ was generated by addition of the basic medium (Δϕ/ΔpH jump). One second after the Δϕ/ΔpH jump, the Δμ̃H+ was collapsed by addition of an uncoupler (nigericin), and, simultaneously, ATP hydrolysis was started by adding [γ-32P]ATP. ATP hydrolysis was stopped after various times between 1 and 20 s by addition of perchloric acid and the released Pi was measured. In the following, the rate of ATP hydrolysis measured in this way is called pre-energized ATP hydrolysis.For comparison ATP hydrolysis was measured under identical conditions but without pre-energization. In this case, after incubation in the acidic medium, the uncoupler was added simultaneously with the basic medium, so that no Δμ̃H+ was generated. After one second, [γ-32P]ATP was added, and ATP hydrolysis was assayed as described above. In the following, the rate of ATP hydrolysis measured under these conditions, i.e.without pre-energization, is called the basal rate. Both the basal and the pre-energized rates of ATP hydrolysis are assayed under the same experimental conditions (composition of medium, substrates, uncouplers, inhibitors etc.) except for the enzyme that has been exposed to Δμ̃H+ or left untreated. Notice that both the pre-energized and the basal rates of ATP hydrolysis were measured under uncoupled conditions.In a first set of experiments the effect of pre-energization on ATP hydrolysis was measured in the presence of 10 mmPi for ADP concentrations between 20 and 100 μm (Fig. 1,A–C) and in the absence of ADP and Pi (Fig.1 D). Throughout these experiments, Δμ̃H+ was the same during pre-energization, with pHin = 4.9, pHout = 8.3 (ΔpH = 3.4), and a [K+]out/[K+]inratio of 100 mm/0.5 mm, equivalent to a Nernst potential of 134 mV. The data for the pre-energized and basal rates are shown in filled and open circles respectively, and the rates of ATP hydrolysis are given by the sloped lines.In the presence of 100 μm ADP (Fig. 1 A), the rate of ATP hydrolysis was increased from 3 to 26 s−1by pre-energization, i.e. an activation factor of about 9 was obtained. The high rate was observed only transiently and decayed to a level close to the basal one within about 15 s. When the ADP concentration in the reaction medium was lowered to 50 μm(Fig. 1 B) or to 20 μm (Fig. 1 C), the pre-energized rates were not affected. In contrast, the basal rates obtained were higher for lower ADP concentrations, and this resulted in a lower activation factor (6.4 and 3.6 for 50 and 20 μmADP, respectively). In the absence of added ADP and Pi(Fig. 1 D), the pre-energized and basal rates were nearly the same and were about two times higher compared with the pre-energized rates in the presence of ADP and Pi. Under pre-energized conditions, the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis show a small lag (Fig. 1,A–C). The most likely explanation for this lag is a delay in reaching a complete dissipation of Δμ̃H+ under these experimental conditions. In such cases the rates in Fig. 1 refer to the highest slope of the curves.These results can be summarized as follows: (i) In the presence of ADP and phosphate, the rate of ATP hydrolysis is low but it can be increased by pre-energization. (ii) Once Δμ̃H+ is dissipated the high activity decays back to the basal activity within 10 to 20 s. (iii) In the absence of ADP and Pi the enzyme activity is already high and cannot be further increased by pre-energization.Throughout these experiments, ATP was always present during pre-energization, being present in the basic medium. In some experiments, ATP was omitted from the basic medium, and, correspondingly, the ATP concentration in the uncoupling medium was increased to reach the same final concentration of 100 μmATP in the reaction medium. The same basal rates and pre-energized rates were obtained compared with the measurements shown in Fig.1 A. This indicates that the presence of ATP during pre-energization is not required for activation.ADP and Pi Inhibition of the Basal ATP Hydrolysis RateIn further experiments, we measured the effects of increasing concentrations of ADP and Pi on the basal rate of ATP. Fig. 2 shows the results obtained in the presence of either 10 mm Pi or 100 μm ADP alone and in the presence and absence of both. The two substrates alone inhibited the ATP hydrolysis rate, to 23 and 42% of the maximal rate, respectively. The inhibition was much more pronounced when both substrates were present together, leaving 2.5% of the maximal rate. Note that the experimental conditions for the measurements shown in Fig. 2 are similar to those of Fig. 1(A and D, open circles). The only difference is that in this case acidic medium, basic medium, and uncoupling medium were first mixed, and then the proteoliposomes were added. Because the rates are the same within experimental error, it appears that the inhibitory effect of ADP and Pi was not caused by preincubation in the acidic medium.Figure 2ATP hydrolysis without pre-energization at different ADP and Pi concentrations. Proteoliposomes (10 μl) were mixed with 80 μl of reaction medium containing 20 μl of acidic medium (+Δϕ), 50 μl of basic medium (+Δϕ), and 10 μl of uncoupling medium (+Δϕ). The final ATP concentration was 100 μm. The reaction was stopped at various times by adding perchloric acid, and samples were analyzed for32Pi content. The solid linesrepresent least square fits of the data. EF0F1concentration was 23 nm. ●, no added ADP or Pi; ○, 10 mm Pi; ▴, 100 μm ADP; ▵, 100 μm ADP, 10 mmPi.

Because 0.5% ADP was found as a contaminant in the commercial ATP, 0.5 μm was the ADP concentration when no ADP was added to the reaction medium. The half-maximal inhibition is observed at 10 μm ADP. ATP hydrolysis was also measured as a function of Piconcentration in the presence of 100 μm ADP. These data are shown in Fig. 3 B, indicating a half-maximal inhibition at 470 μm Pi. We conclude that the basal rate observed in Fig. 1 A could not be significantly decreased by a further increase in ADP or Pi concentration.Figure 3Rate of ATP hydrolysis without pre-energization as a function of ADP and Piconcentration. Basal rates of ATP hydrolysis are from Figs. 1 and2 and additional measurements. A, rates of ATP hydrolysis in the presence of 10 mm Pi were measured as a function of the ADP concentration.

First we checked whether one of the two components of Δμ̃H+, Δϕ or ΔpH alone, was responsible for the activation phenomenon. ATP hydrolysis was measured after pre-energization with either Δϕ or ΔpH alone. The experiments were carried out in the same way as those presented in Fig. 1 B, i.e. in the presence of 50 μm ADP and 10 mm Pi. For ΔpH = 0, pHin and pHout were both 8.3, and the [K+]out/[K+]inratio was 100 mm/0.5 mm, equivalent to a Nernst potential of 134 mV. For Δϕ = 0, [K+]out and [K+]inwere both 100 mm with pHin = 4.9, pHout = 8.3 (ΔpH = 3.4). In both cases no significant activation could be seen, indicating that neither Δϕ nor ΔpH alone was responsible for the activation seen in Fig. 1.We also checked whether ΔpH and Δϕ have the same effect on the activation by varying the relative contribution of Δϕ and ΔpH at the same level of Δμ̃H+(Δp ≈ 240 mV). Fig. 4 shows the effect of pre-energization on ATP hydrolysis when, at constant Δμ̃H+, the relative contribution of ΔpH and Δϕ were varied. It can be seen that no activation is observed for Δϕ = 0; however, at the same Δμ̃H+, the pre-energized rate was increased by a factor 2 when Δϕ was increased to about 80 mV. Therefore, Δϕ appears to be more effective than ΔpH in driving the activation step.Figure 4ATP hydrolysis with and without pre-energization under different Δ˜μ H+ conditions. EF0F1 proteoliposomes were energized by an acid-base transition. After 1 s, nigericin and [γ-32P]ATP were added to dissipate Δμ̃H+ and to start the release of32Pi. The left arrow indicates the acid-base transition (addition of basic medium), and the right arrow represents the addition of nigericin and [γ-32P]ATP (addition of uncoupling medium).

Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In this work, we have investigated ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by EF0F1 reconstituted into liposomes. First, we have shown that the steady state rate of ATP hydrolysis was limited by the back pressure of Δμ̃H+, indicating that the proteoliposomes were well coupled. Correspondingly, these proteoliposomes catalyzed high rates of ATP synthesis.A strong inhibition of the rate of ATP hydrolysis by ADP (Fig.3 A) and Pi (Fig. 3 B) was observed. Because all measurements reported in this work were carried out in the presence of 2.5 mm Mg2+, ADP was present almost completely as MgADP, which suggests that it is the binding of this complex to EF0F1 that inhibits ATP hydrolysis. For EF1, the occurrence of an inhibitory MgADP catalytic site complex has been reported by Hyndman et al. (36Hyndman D.J. Milgrom Y.M. Bramhall E.A. Cross R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28871-28877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), similar to what was found for soluble portions of the chloroplast (37Zhou J.M. Xue Z.X. Du Z.Y. Melese T. Boyer P.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5129-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and mitochondrial F1F0 ATP synthase (38Drobinskaya I.Y. Kozlov I.A. Murataliev M.B. Vulfson E.N. FEBS Lett. 1985; 182: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 39Milgrom Y.M. Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 40Chernyak B.V. Cross R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These authors have proposed that this inhibitory complex could be responsible for EF1 occurring as an heterogeneous mixture of active and inactive enzyme, as initially suggested by kinetic studies (41Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Bullough D.A. Allison W.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1058: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Binding of Pi to the E. coli enzyme has not been seen in competition studies with ATP using mutagenized tryptophanes as reporters of nucleotide binding to catalytic and non catalytic sites (42Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12653-12658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 43Löbau S. Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10846-10853Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). On the other hand, relatively low concentrations of Pi (2 mm) were shown to inhibit uni- and multi-site ATP hydrolysis in EF1 (41Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Bullough D.A. Allison W.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1058: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and Pibinding to EF1 (KD = 50 μm) has been shown to change the rate of trypsin cleavage of the ε subunit (44Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Possibly, the binding of Pi is sensitive to the particular pattern of nucleotide occupancy of the enzyme. Because a small amount of ADP, as a contaminant of ATP, was present in our experiments, it is also possible that inhibition by Pi occurs only when ADP is present. The data of Mendel-Hartvig and Capaldi (44Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), considered in the light of the present work, do suggest that the ε subunit could be considered to play a main role in the Δμ̃H+-induced inhibited-to-active transition. It is also interesting that, within the complexity of Pi effects on the activity of various ATP synthases to be found in the literature, there are reports of an ADP-requiring Pi inhibition of the mitochondrial F1 (45Di Pietro A. Fellous G. Godinot C. Gautheron D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 851: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and of the chloroplasts F0F1 (27Dunham K.R. Selman B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10044-10049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Shoshan V. Strotmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 996-999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We then investigated the effect of pre-energization on ATP hydrolysis. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was significantly increased compared with the rate without energization (Fig. 1 A). Remarkably, this activation effect was only evident in the presence of inhibitory ADP and Pi. In their absence, the enzyme was able to catalyze high rates of ATP hydrolysis that could not be increased significantly by a Δμ̃H+ (Fig. 1 D).A simple way to explain these observations is that membrane-bound EF0F1 exists in at least two different states: an inhibited state, Ei, with bound ADP and Pi, and an active state, Ea. Energization of the proteoliposomes by Δμ̃H+ induces the transition from Ei to Ea. The high rates of ATP hydrolysis are detected only after dissipation of Δμ̃H+ by uncoupling, because the back pressure of Δμ̃H+ inhibits the ATP hydrolysis reaction. The active state is metastable and decays after dissipation of Δμ̃H+ to the inhibited state within about 15 s. During this time, the enzyme carries out about 100 turnovers. This can be summarized by the following scheme. ΔμH+Ei·ADP·Pi→Ei·ADP·Pi→Ea+ADP+PiSCHEME1According to this scheme, the Ea form is able to catalyze high rates of both ATP hydrolysis and synthesis, the direction being determined by the phosphate potential and membrane energization. It is not yet clear what causes the release of ADP and Pi and whether the conformational change results in an increase of the dissociation constants of bound ADP and Pior a Δμ̃H+-driven ATP synthesis. In chloroplasts it has been shown that, after energization, ADP is released from the enzyme without previous phosphorylation (19Gräber P. Schlodder E. Witt H.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 461: 426-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 47Rosing J. Smith D.J. Kalayar C. Boyer P.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 72: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,48Schumann J. Strotmann H. Akoyunoglou G. Photosynthesis II: Electron Transport and Photophosphorylation. Balaban International Science Services, Philadelphia, PA1981: 881-892Google Scholar).At 100 μm ATP, 100 μm ADP and 10 mm Pi were enough to inhibit the enzyme almost to completion (about 2% of the maximal activity was left; Figs. 1 and2). One might ask whether the maximum Δμ̃H+ applied in this work (ΔpH = 3.4; Δϕ ≈ 134 mV; Fig. 1) was enough to activate all enzymes. Comparison of D and A of Fig. 1 shows that the highest hydrolysis rate was 64 s−1(+Δμ̃H+, absence of ADP and Pi), whereas the hydrolysis rate observed after Δμ̃H+ activation in the presence of the highest ADP/Pi concentration was 26 s−1,i.e. only 40%. This lower rate might be due to two different effects: (i) the applied Δμ̃H+ activates all enzymes; in this case the lower activity can be attributed to competitive product inhibition of the ATP hydrolysis; and (ii) the applied Δμ̃H+ activates only 40% of the enzymes, and, correspondingly, the rate is lower.It is striking that the activation of EF0F1requires Δμ̃H+ values that are higher than the thermodynamic threshold for ATP synthesis under these conditions. Taking ΔG0′P = 35 kJ mol−1 (49Rosing J. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 267: 275-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and [ATP] = 100 μm, [ADP] = 50 μm, [Pi] = 10 mm, the thermodynamic threshold of Δμ̃H+ for ATP synthesis is 12 kJ mol−1 (Δp = 125 mV) for nH+ = 4 or 16 kJ mol−1 ("

J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 1555-1562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mature human EGF is composed of 53 amino acids but is derived from a much larger transmembrane precursor of 1207 amino acids (2Bell G.I. Fong N.M. Stempien M.M. Wormsted M.A. Caput D. Ku L.L. Urdea M.S. Rall L.B. Sanchez-Pescador R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8427-8446Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). It belongs to the EGF family of peptides that signals through the erbB receptors, with EGF receptor being the prototype (3Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). EGF is released from its precursor by a specific arginine estero-peptidase that, in many cells, appears to be limiting (4Frey P. Forland R. Macing T. Shooter E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6294-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, processing occurs in granular convoluted tubules of the submandibular gland, and EGF is released mainly into saliva (5Murphy R.A. Watson A.Y. Metz J. Forssmann W.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1980; 28: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Transforming growth factor (TGF)-α binds to the EGF receptor with an affinity similar to that of EGF, and the two share many biological effects. TGF-α is a 50-amino acid polypeptide derived from a 160-amino acid membrane-bound precursor. It was initially isolated as one of the transforming peptides from sarcoma virus-transformed fibroblasts (6de Larco J.E. Todaro G.J. Proc Natl Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4001-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). EGF, TGF-α, and amphiregulin only bind and activate EGF receptors (also called erbB1 and HER1) (7Moghal N. Sternberg P.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and they are referred to as group one of the EGF family. In recent years, information on the EGF family and erbB receptor family has expanded rapidly. In in vitro studies on cells expressing multiple erbB family members, signal specificity was shown to be controlled by ligand specificity as well as receptor homo- and heterodimerization (8Riese D.J., II Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar).Important information on the in vivo functions of erbB signaling has been gained from transgenic mice that overexpress the ligand as well as loss of function mutants (9Giraud A.S. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2000; 278: G501-G506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice deficient in one or all three of EGF, TGF-α, and amphiregulin revealed their distinct role in mammary gland development (10Luetteke N.C. Qiu T.H. Fenton S.E. Troyer K.L. Riedel R.F. Chang A. Lee D.C. Development. 1999; 126: 2739-2750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice without TGF-α or with a mutant EGF receptor showed an identical phenotype of affected hair and eyelid development (11Luetteke N.C. Qiu T.H. Peiffer R.L. Oliver P. Smithies O. Lee D.C. Cell. 1993; 73: 263-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 12Mann G.B. Fowler K.J. Gabriel A. Nice E.C. Williams R.L. Dunn A.R.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In addition to these defects, mice with a null mutation in EGF receptor died at peri-implantation, midgestation, or shortly after birth, depending on their genetic background (14Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Science. 1995; 269: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 15Threadgill D.W. Dlgosz A.A. Hansen L.A. Tennenbaum T. Lichti U. Yee D. LaMantia C. Mourton T. Herrup K.

Werb Z. Derynck R. Nature. 1995; 376: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). In cancer tissues, overexpression of EGF receptor, TGF-α, and amphiregulin, but not EGF, is frequently found (7Moghal N. Sternberg P.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In agreement with this observation, transgenic mice overexpressing TGF-α showed epithelial hyperplasia of several organs, pancreatic metaplasia, and breast carcinoma (17Sandgren E.P. Luetteke N.C. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Lee D.C. Cell. 1990; 61: 1121-1135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 18Jhappan C. Stahle C. Harkins R.N. Fausto N. Smith G.H. Merlino G.T. Cell. 1990; 61: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Amphiregulin was found to be a preneoplastic tumor marker in transgenic models of mammary tumors, including transgenic mice of TGF-α and erbB2 (19Niemeyer C.C. Spencer-Dene B. Wu J.X. Adamson E.D. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 588-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Expression of amphiregulin in basal keratinocytes induced a psoriasis-like phenotype in transgenic mice (20Cook P.W. Piepkorn M. Clegg C.H. Plowman G.D. DeMay J.M. Brown J.R. Pittelkow M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2286-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To provide further information on the physiological and pathological roles of EGF and to distinguish itsin vivo effects from those of other EGF receptor ligands, we have generated transgenic mice widely expressing a shortened human EGF precursor (hEGF). The eight EGF-like repeats were deleted, leaving the active EGF domain in the transmembrane form. This would release the effect of EGF-like repeats, if any, on the exposure of the EGF domain and allows direct comparison of its effects with TGF-α. Our previous study has shown that hEGF, like the full-length precursor, is biologically active in transforming NIH3T3 (21Kwan R.W.P. Wong R.W.C. Chan S.Y. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 15: 281-284PubMed Google Scholar).Various in vitro studies have shown that EGF reduces synthesis of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and IGF-binding protein-3 (22Edmondson S.R. Murashita M.M. Russo V.C. Wraight C.J. Werther G.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Hembree J.R. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3160-3166PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, IGF action is influenced by the IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). Six IGFBPs have been found that differ in their influence on IGF activity. Besides increasing the half-life of IGFs in circulation, IGFBPs can potentiate activities of IGFs on cell proliferation. In addition, IGF-independent regulatory mechanisms of IGFBPs have been described. IGF-independent growth inhibition by IGFBP-3 is believed to occur through IGFBP-3-specific cell surface association proteins or receptors and involves nuclear translocation (24Grimberg A. Cohen P. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Several transgenic mouse models overexpressing IGFBP-1, -2,-3, or -4 have been developed over the past few years (25Schneider M.R. Lahm H. Wu M. Hoeflich A. Wolf E. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The overexpression of IGFBP-3 under the control of a ubiquitous promoter resulted in selective organomegaly (26Murphy L.J. Molnar P. Lu X. Huang H. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 15: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recent data indicate that low levels of IGFBP-3 are associated with stunted growth and an increased risk of at least several types of carcinoma that are common in economically developed countries (24Grimberg A. Cohen P. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 27Giovannucci E. Horm. Res. ( Basel ). 1999; 51 Suppl. 3: 34-41PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies are required to determine the clinical relevance of these findings.To elucidate the role of EGF in vivo, we have recently overexpressed hEGF in transgenic mice. The two major phenotypes were infertility and stunted growth (28Wong R.W.C. Kwan R.W.P. Mak P.H.S. Mak K.K.L. Sham M.H. Chan S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18297-18301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the possible mechanisms leading to the growth problem and the relationship between EGF and IGFBP-3.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe have recently reported the generation of EGF transgenic mice. They all expressed human EGF protein at high levels in various organs, and their fertility problem has been reported previously (28Wong R.W.C. Kwan R.W.P. Mak P.H.S. Mak K.K.L. Sham M.H. Chan S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18297-18301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Growth rate and body weight were compared with those of nontransgenic littermates. All transgenic animals were born at only half the weight of their normal littermates. They caught up by day 20 and reached 78% of the weight of nontransgenic littermates at adulthood (Fig. 1 A). The transgenic mice appeared to be proportionate dwarfs. In the current study, we focused on investigating the mechanism leading to stunted growth.EGF Reduced Serum IGFBP-3IGF-I is known to be a mediator of growth hormone action in pubertal growth (35Chard T. J. Endocrinol. 1989; 123: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It also acts from gestation day 13.5 onward in prenatal mice in a growth hormone-independent manner, whereas IGF-II controls growth earlier in gestation (36Baker J. Liu J.P. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 73-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). In humans, IGF-I, but not IGF-II, has also been shown to be involved in the control of fetal size during the later months of intrauterine life (37Lassarre C. Hardouin S. Daffos F. Forestier F. Frankenne F. Binoux M. Pediatr. Res. 1991; 29: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The molar concentration of serum IGFBP-3 roughly equals the sum of the IGF-I and IGF-II molar concentrations (38Baxter R. Martin J. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1504-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). We speculated that EGF exerted its effect on growth through the IGF system, and we measured the concentration of serum IGFBP-3. Serum IGF-I could not be reliably quantified with the system we have been using for measuring human IGF-I. The mean IGFBP-3 level of transgenic mice (182.5 ± 94.4 ng/ml; n = 4 founders; 2–9 months old) was significantly lower (p = 0.0011) than that of normal adult mice (425.1 ± 74.6 ng/ml; n= 12; 8–9 months old; Fig. 1 B). One female transgenic founder was sacrificed at 2 months in the pilot study to detect transgene expression and found to have embryos at around day 7.5 of gestation. Serum IGFBP-3 level increased with pregnancy (39Daughaday W.H. Rotwein P. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 68-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). Still, its value (349 ng/ml) was relatively lower than that of nonpregnant controls. The results suggest that the action of EGF on growth was mediated at least in part through decreasing serum IGFBP-3. All transgenic mice expressed hEGF in various organs to a similar level as judged by Western analysis (28Wong R.W.C. Kwan R.W.P. Mak P.H.S. Mak K.K.L. Sham M.H. Chan S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18297-18301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our data suggested that EGF may change the production/secretion of IGFBP-3 in liver and kidney. Transgenic mice overexpressing different IGFBPs have been very useful for addressing the specific functions of IGFBPs (25Schneider M.R. Lahm H. Wu M. Hoeflich A. Wolf E. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Overexpression of IGFBP-3 resulted in selective organomegaly that differed from the major sites of transgene expression (26Murphy L.J. Molnar P. Lu X. Huang H. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 15: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We believe that in our transgenic mice, reduced serum IGFBP-3 is the result of EGF overexpression rather than a secondary effect of growth retardation. In a recent study (40Van Neck J.W. Berghout E.M. Vinter-Jensen L. Groffen C.A.H. Cingel V. Dits N.F.J. Drop S.L.S. Flyvbjerg A. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 165: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), EGF administered for 7 days to young adult rats was shown to significantly lower IGFBP-3 levels to 44% of control values without affecting the body weight, whereas circulating IGFBP-1 and -2 levels were unaffected. It has also been shown by Frystyket al. (41Frystyk J. Vinter-Jensen L. Skjærbæk C. Flyvbjerg A. Growth Regul. 1996; 6: 48-54PubMed Google Scholar) that injection of EGF for 4 weeks into adult rats decreased serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3. The authors discussed that most in vitro studies, including those on hepatocytes, reported an increase in IGF-I after EGF stimulation. The discrepancies between in vivo and in vitro studies may be explained by changes in IGFBPs. In both situations, EGF reduced IGFBP-3. In vitro, reduced IGFBP-3 would increase free IGF-I. In vivo, reduced IGFBP-3 would decrease circulating IGF-I because most IGF-I is bound to IGFBP-3 (41Frystyk J. Vinter-Jensen L. Skjærbæk C. Flyvbjerg A. Growth Regul. 1996; 6: 48-54PubMed Google Scholar). In transgenic mice overexpressing interleukin-6, growth impairment was also correlated with reduced IGF-I (42De Benedetti F. Alonzi T. Moretta A. Lazzaro D. Costa P. Poli V. Martini A. Ciliberto G. Fattori E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In IGF-I null mutants, the mice were smaller from embryonic day 12.5 (36Baker J. Liu J.P. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 73-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). In our case, EGF also acted prenatally because we noticed that all transgenic mice identified at weaning were small from the day of birth. Our data are in agreement with the hypothesis that EGF affects the production/secretion of IGFBP-3, hence decreasing the availability of IGFs and resulting in slower growth before and after birth.Abnormal Proliferation of OsteoblastsTo gain further insights into the effects of EGF overexpression on bone development, we investigated the histology of long bones of transgenic mice. In wild type mice, osteoblasts were found as an even lining along the bone cortex both on the outer surface (periosteum) and inner surface along the marrow cavity (endosteum). In transgenic mice, hEGF immunostaining was found in both the periosteum (Fig. 2 A) and the endosteum (Fig. 2 B). In addition, abnormal accumulation of osteoblasts in the periosteum and/or endosteum was found in some areas (Fig. 2 D). This imbalance in bone remodeling, however, did not result in thickening of the cortical bone. In contrast, we found that the thickness of the cortical bone in transgenic mice was reduced compared with that of normal mice (data not shown). It has been shown that in cultured fetal rat long bone, EGF stimulated thymidine incorporation at a low concentration, whereas it stimulated bone resorption at a higher concentration (43Raisz L.G. Simmons H.A. Sandberg A.L. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 1980; 107: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The long bone has also been shown to harbor EGF receptors in osteoblast-like cells (44Martineau-Doizé B. Lai W.H. Warshawsky H. Bergeron J.J.

However, the signal of hEGF immunostaining in the growth plate of our transgenic animals was too weak to be detected. Ideally, the growth plate of younger transgenic animals should be studied. To gain insight into the normal role of EGF in bone development, we studied endogenous EGF expression in the growth plate of fetal (day 14.5–17.5), 2-day-old, 2-week-old, and 4-week-old mice. EGF was strongly expressed in some proliferating and all hypertrophic chondrocytes at all stages studied (Fig. 4, A and B). The specificity of immunostaining was shown by the fact that it could be blocked by preabsorbing the antibody with 10 mm EGF. Similar results were obtained by Tajima et al. (45Tajima Y. Yokose S. Takenoya M. Utsumi N. Kato K. J. Anat. 1993; 182: 291-293PubMed Google Scholar), who reported staining in resting, proliferating, and hypertrophic zones of the adult mouse femur epiphyseal plate. We further substantiated our findings by studying the expression of EGF in a mouse chondrocyte cell line, MCT. At a nonpermissive temperature of 37 °C, the cells stop growing and express molecular markers of hypertrophic chondrocytes such as type X collagen and osteopontin (33Lefebvre V. Garofalo S. Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). By reverse transcription-PCR, we found EGF expression only when MCT cells differentiated to hypertrophic chondrocytes at 37 °C (Fig. 4 C). Although TGF-α expression has been reported in a number of cell lines, to our knowledge, cell lines expressing EGF are rare. We suggest a specific role for EGF in the last stages of chondrocyte differentiation. The MCT cell line will allow us to study the regulation of EGF production and its role in chondrogenesis.Figure 3Growth plate in transgenic mice.Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of the proximal tibia from (A) a wild type 6-month-old mouse and (B) a representative transgenic mouse still show clear columns of chondrocytes.

Transgenic mice overexpressing TGF-α weighed approximately 10% less than the control mice (49Webber E.M. Wu J.C. Wang L. Merlino G. Fausto N. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 398-408PubMed Google Scholar). None of the neoplastic changes reported in liver, coagulation gland, and pancreas of TGF-α mice was observed in our mice at a gross or histological level, despite the expression of hEGF in these organs as detected by immunohistochemistry and/or Western blotting. Indeed, we observed patch necrosis in the liver of all of our transgenic animals (Fig. 5). This was in sharp contrast to liver enlargement and increased proliferation in TGF-α mice (49Webber E.M. Wu J.C. Wang L. Merlino G. Fausto N. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 398-408PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggested an important functional difference between EGF and TGF-α.Figure 5Liver necrosis in transgenic mice.Hematoxylin and eosin staining of wild type (A) and transgenic (B) liver is shown.

In addition, abnormal skin structure and stunted growth occurred at high doses of EGF (1Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 1555-1562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our transgenic mice, only growth retardation was remarkable and would be attributed to the decrease of IGFBP-3. Because other phenotypes encountered in the previous study were not observed in our transgenic mice, the mechanism of action of EGF on eyelid opening and incisor eruption might be different from that on growth. To our knowledge, this is also the first report on thein vivo effects of EGF on chondrocyte and osteoblast proliferation. During bone development, EGF may play a role in chondrocyte hypertrophy. We also provide in vivo evidence that EGF overexpression did not lead to tumorigenesis in our transgenic animals. Additional studies to reveal the distinct biological effects of EGF and TGF-α in vivo are under way in our laboratory. We are also generating transgenic mice expressing EGF in a tissue-specific manner to distinguish the systemicversus paracrine effects of EGF. Epidermal growth factor (EGF)1 was initially identified from mouse submaxillary gland extract as a stimulator of eyelid opening and incisor eruption when injected into newborn mice and rats (1Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 1555-1562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mature human EGF is composed of 53 amino acids but is derived from a much larger transmembrane precursor of 1207 amino acids (2Bell G.I. Fong N.M. Stempien M.M. Wormsted M.A. Caput D. Ku L.L. Urdea M.S. Rall L.B. Sanchez-Pescador R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8427-8446Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). It belongs to the EGF family of peptides that signals through the erbB receptors, with EGF receptor being the prototype (3Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). EGF is released from its precursor by a specific arginine estero-peptidase that, in many cells, appears to be limiting (4Frey P. Forland R. Macing T. Shooter E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6294-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, processing occurs in granular convoluted tubules of the submandibular gland, and EGF is released mainly into saliva (5Murphy R.A. Watson A.Y. Metz J. Forssmann W.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1980; 28: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Transforming growth factor (TGF)-α binds to the EGF receptor with an affinity similar to that of EGF, and the two share many biological effects. TGF-α is a 50-amino acid polypeptide derived from a 160-amino acid membrane-bound precursor. It was initially isolated as one of the transforming peptides from sarcoma virus-transformed fibroblasts (6de Larco J.E. Todaro G.J. Proc Natl Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4001-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). EGF, TGF-α, and amphiregulin only bind and activate EGF receptors (also called erbB1 and HER1) (7Moghal N. Sternberg P.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and they are referred to as group one of the EGF family. In recent years, information on the EGF family and erbB receptor family has expanded rapidly. In in vitro studies on cells expressing multiple erbB family members, signal specificity was shown to be controlled by ligand specificity as well as receptor homo- and heterodimerization (8Riese D.J., II Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Important information on the in vivo functions of erbB signaling has been gained from transgenic mice that overexpress the ligand as well as loss of function mutants (9Giraud A.S. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2000; 278: G501-G506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice deficient in one or all three of EGF, TGF-α, and amphiregulin revealed their distinct role in mammary gland development (10Luetteke N.C. Qiu T.H. Fenton S.E. Troyer K.L. Riedel R.F. Chang A. Lee D.C. Development. 1999; 126: 2739-2750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice without TGF-α or with a mutant EGF receptor showed an identical phenotype of affected hair and eyelid development (11Luetteke N.C. Qiu T.H. Peiffer R.L. Oliver P. Smithies O. Lee D.C.

In addition to these defects, mice with a null mutation in EGF receptor died at peri-implantation, midgestation, or shortly after birth, depending on their genetic background (14Sibilia M.

Academic Press, New York1965: 259-310Google Scholar) independently first suggested a role for pyrophosphate as a high energy bond donor in the primeval earth. They proposed that the reactions found in primitive life forms evolved from prebiotic systems and that contemporary primitive organisms could retain the ability to employ inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi)1 as a high energy compound. Suggestions that PPi could serve as an energy source found later support in the discovery of a number of instances in which polyphosphates or pyrophosphate could substitute for ATP in reactions of glycolysis: glucokinase, pyruvate kinase, phosphoglycerate kinase, and phosphofructokinase (see Ref. 3Kulaev I.G. Vagabov V.M. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1983; 24: 83-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar for review). In most instances these enzymes were found in anaerobic bacteria and presumptive primitive protists, such as Giardiaand Entamoeba, supporting the idea that the kinases employed ancient mechanisms. Of the PPi-dependent enzymes, phosphofructokinase (PFK) has been studied most extensively. Sequence data have shown the pyrophosphate-dependent PFK (PPi-PFK) to be homologous to the ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase (ATP-PFK), but with amino acid identities being less than 35% even when all positions that are not shared among all PFKs are eliminated (4Mertens E. Ladror U.S. Lee J.A. Miretsky A. Morris A. Rozario C. Kemp R.G. Muller M. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 47: 739-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In a recent study of a PPi-PFK from the archaeon, Thermoproteus tenax, Siebers et al. (5Siebers B. Klenk H.-P. Hensel R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2137-2143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the archeal PPi-PFK represents the most ancient lineage of PFKs. In the current study we demonstrate the presence of a latent nucleotide binding site in the PPi-PFK of Entamoeba histolytica, suggesting that the nucleotide-dependent enzyme is the more primitive phosphofructokinase. The plasmid bearing the E. histolyticaPPi-PFK gene cloned into the prokaryotic expression plasmid pALTER-Ex1 (Promega) at the NdeI and XbaI restriction sites has been described previously (6Deng Z. Huang M. Singh K. Albach R.A. Latshaw S.P. Chang K.P. Kemp R.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using the Altered Sites II In Vitro Mutagenesis System (Promega). Recombinant wild type and mutant plasmids were transformed into DF1020 (pro-82, Δpfk201, recA56, Δ(rha-pfkA)200,endA1, hsdR17, supE44)Escherichia coli and plated onto Luria broth agar plates (100 μg/ml ampicillin). Freshly transformed single colonies were inoculated into Luria broth medium (100 μg/ml ampicillin) and grown at 37 °C until A 600 reached 0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and incubation was continued at 30 °C for an additional 12–18 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min. Wild type and mutant E. histolytica PFKs were then purified and assayed as described previously (6Deng Z. Huang M. Singh K. Albach R.A. Latshaw S.P. Chang K.P. Kemp R.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Homogeneity of the preparations was demonstrated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Enzyme activity of PPi-PFK was assayed spectrophotometrically at 30 °C in an assay solution that contained 150 mm Tes/KOH (pH 7.2), 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm NADH, the indicated concentrations of sodium PPi and Fru-6-P, and 2–6 units each of aldolase, triose-phosphate isomerase, and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. These auxiliary enzymes were dialyzed against 50 mm Tes/KOH (pH 7.2), 1 mmEDTA prior to use. Enzyme activities for the ATP-dependent PFK were determined at 30 °C and at pH 7.2. The assay contained 150 mmTes/KOH, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm NADH, the indicated concentrations of Fru-6-P and ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.6 unit of aldolase, and 0.3 unit each of triose-phosphate isomerase and glycerophosphate dehydrogenase. MgCl2 was added at a concentration 4 mm higher than the concentration of ATP under all conditions to ensure that virtually all of the ATP existed as the MgATP complex. For both ATP-dependent and PPi-dependent PFKs, 1 unit of enzyme was defined as the amount of enzyme producing 1 μmol of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate per min under the standard assay conditions. Kinetic parameters were calculated with the GraFit graphical analysis program. N 6-[(6-Aminohexyl)carbamoyl methyl]-ATP was prepared and coupled to Sepharose as described previously (7Lindberg M. Mosbach K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 53: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Despite the low sequence identity between ATP- and PPi-dependent PFKs, the residues surrounding the substrate binding sites of the two enzymes bear much greater similarity (8Hinds R.M. Xu J. Walters D.E. Kemp R.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Inspection of two highly conserved sequence motifs in the subsite where phosphoryl transfer occurs reveals subtle differences between the two types of PFK. In the E. coli ATP-PFK, the last two residues (Asp-104 and Gly-105) of the conserved GGDG motif are directly involved in binding the phosphates of ATP (9Shirakihara Y. Evans P.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 973-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Whereas the last residue in the motif is Gly in ATP-PFKs, in most PPi-PFKs including that of E. histolytica, the last residue is Asp. In the other highly conserved active site motif, P(G/K)TIDXD, a Gly resides in the second position of this sequence in ATP-PFKs whereas in PPi-PFKs it is Lys. We have mutated both critical Gly residues at positions 105 and 124 in E. coli ATP-dependent PFK to Asp and Lys, respectively, to seek activity with PPi as a phosphoryl donor. While each of the mutations individually or together effectively eliminated activity with ATP as a substrate, no PPi-dependent activity was observed. 2X. Wang and R. G. Kemp, unpublished data. On the other hand, very striking changes in phosphoryl donor specificity were observed when the corresponding mutations were carried out with the PPi-dependent PFK from E. histolytica. As shown in Table I, changing either residue to Gly reduced k cat with PPi as the phosphoryl donor by 4 orders of magnitude while having a limited effect on the apparent PPi affinity of the residual activity. The wild type PPi-dependent enzyme was found to have a trace of activity with ATP, having ak cat that was nearly 104 lower than that with PPi and ak cat/K m for ATP that was 106 lower than that determined with PPi as a substrate. Mutation of Asp-175 or Lys-201 to Gly brought about increases in apparent affinity for ATP and increases in thek cat with ATP as substrate. The D175G mutant in particular showed a nearly 200-fold increase ink cat with ATP as phosphoryl donor and a nearly 4000-fold increase in activity at low concentrations of ATP. The double mutant (Table I) with both active site residues converted to Gly had no detectable activity with PPi as substrate. This mutant had activity with ATP but was not as active as the single mutant, D175G.Table IKinetic parameters of E. histolytica PFK wild type and mutant enzymes using PPi or ATP as a phosphoryl donorPPiPPi performance (k cat/K m)PPiATPATP performance (k cat/K m)ATPK m PPiK m Fru-6-Pk cat PPiK m ATPK m Fru-6-Pk cat ATPmmmms −1mmmms −1WT0.0260.10134113,1002.92.00.0370.013D175G0.0340.1040.0451.30.1580.286.944K201G0.0190.0880.0733.81.40.0820.1420.101D175G/K201G∼∼∼<4 × 10−4 1-aNo activity was detected.2.90.0683.21.1Assays were performed at pH 7.2 with a saturating concentration of the second substrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ∼ indicates that the value could not be calculated because no activity could be detected.

All standard deviations were less than 10%. In a study of altering the coenzyme use of isocitrate dehydrogenase by site-directed mutagenesis, Chen et al. (10Chen R. Greer A Dean A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 11666-11670Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) definedk cat/K m as enzyme performance and the ratio of k cat/K m with one substrate to k cat/K m for the second substrate as enzyme preference. The enzyme preference of the wild type and mutant enzymes, (k cat /K m)PPi/(k cat /K m)ATP, are shown in Fig. 1. The single mutation of Asp-175 → Gly changed substrate preference by a factor of nearly 107. The mutation produced a decrease ink cat/K m for PPiof approximately 2200-fold and an increase ink cat/K m for ATP of 3800-fold. This represents an extraordinary change in substrate preference brought about with a modest change in primary structure. No comparable change in substrate preference has been described as the result of single mutation. Chen et al. (10Chen R. Greer A Dean A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 11666-11670Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) shifted the preference ofE. coli isocitrate dehydrogenase from NAD to NADP by >106, but this required seven mutations in the enzyme. The D175G and the D175G/K201G mutants were also capable of using other nucleotides as substrates in the PFK reaction (see TableII). Both mutants actually exhibited greater specificity with GTP as a phosphoryl donor than ATP, as the performances with GTP in both mutants were twice that with ATP. The apparent affinity for GTP in the D175G mutant (K m = 0.024 mm) was slightly better than its apparent affinity for PPi (K m = 0.034 mm) of the residual PPi activity and was nearly identical to the apparent PPi affinity of the wild type enzyme (K m = 0.025 mm). UTP was used by both mutants as well, although the performance with UTP was only one-third that of ATP. Both mutant enzymes have a greater performance value with any of the nucleotides examined than that with PPi.Table IINucleotide utilization by mutants of PPi-PFKK mk catk cat/K mmms −1s −1 · mm −1D175G ATP0.1586.944.0 GTP0.0242.396.0 UTP0.2003.116.0D175G/K201G ATP2.873.21.1 GTP0.6681.62.4 UTP1.920.520.27Assays were performed at pH 7.2 with a saturating concentration of Fru-6-P as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All standard deviations were less than 10%. Open table in a new tab Assays were performed at pH 7.2 with a saturating concentration of Fru-6-P as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All standard deviations were less than 10%. Despite the fact that the recombinant PPi-PFK and its mutants were expressed in a pfk − strain ofE. coli, there could remain concern that the relatively low rates of catalysis seen with alternative substrates resulted from contamination or by catalysis at an alternative site on the enzyme. To eliminate these possibilities, PPi was tested as an inhibitor of the ATP-PFK activity of the D175G mutant. The data were analyzed by a Dixon plot (not shown). PPi indeed acts as a competitive inhibitor with a K i of about 1 μm, actually slightly lower than the apparentK m value calculated when used as a substrate. TheK i more closely represents a true dissociation constant whereas the K m is likely to involve other rate constants. Nonetheless, it is clear that the mutation of E. histolytica PPi-PFK has brought about a change in specificity of the enzyme due to an alteration in the substrate binding site. To further demonstrate the existence of a nucleotide binding site in the mutant that was not present in the wild type enzyme, binding toN 6-[(6-aminohexyl)carbamoyl methyl]-ATP coupled to Sepharose was employed. The D175G mutant (15 μg) was incubated in 100 μl of packed ATP-Sepharose pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.2), 0.1 mm EDTA, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The suspension was mixed by rotation for 30 min at 20 °C. The ATP-Sepharose was then washed three times with 1.5 ml of the same buffer. No enzyme was detectable by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or by measuring activity in the washes. All of the enzyme activity was eluted with 300 μl of 2.5 mm ATP in the same buffer. Under identical conditions, the wild type E. histolytica PFK did not bind to theN 6-[(6-aminohexyl)carbamoyl methyl]-ATP-Sepharose. It is clear that the mutation of E. histolytica PPi-PFK has exposed a latent nucleotide binding site. The most striking conclusion of this study is that a latent ATP binding site aligned for a catalytic role is present in the PPi-PFK of E. histolytica and possibly all PPi-PFKs. It is difficult to imagine how the active site of PPi-PFK of E. histolytica could efficiently accommodate the comparatively large ATP molecule with the slight changes brought about by a single mutation without a pre-existing nucleotide binding site. Because the active site motifs are well conserved in all PFKs, it is possible that all PFKs have remnants of a nucleotide binding site and that only subtle structural alterations are required for a change in phosphoryl donor specificity. Recent studies of the adenosine subsite of E. coliATP-dependent PFK have shown the importance of an aromatic ring at position 41 of that enzyme for the high affinity binding of ATP (11Wang X. Kemp R.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4313-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although alignments of PPi-PFKs with ATP-PFKs depend upon somewhat subjective judgments in this region of the enzyme, almost all PPi-PFKs have an aromatic amino acid at this position (4Mertens E. Ladror U.S. Lee J.A. Miretsky A. Morris A. Rozario C. Kemp R.G. Muller M. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 47: 739-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Also supporting the idea that major structural changes are not involved for phosphoryl donor selectivity is that the ATP-PFK ofStreptomyces coelicolor and the PPi-PFK ofAmycolaptopsis methanolica share 71% identity and that all of the residues at positions corresponding to those of the ATP binding site of the E. coli enzyme are identical (12Alves A.M.

This study supports the concept that ATP or a closely related nucleotide was the original high energy source in the primeval earth. A primordial role for ATP in early biotic or even prebiotic processes is not surprising in light of the now established role of nucleic acids as catalysts. The earliest forms of life were probably self-replicating nucleic acids, most likely RNA molecules, that eventually developed the ability to direct the synthesis of DNA and proteins. In this early RNA world, nucleic acids could have recruited proteins to assist in catalytic processes, such as seen in ribonuclease P. Later evolution would have led to decreasing complexity in the nucleic acid component and increasing complexity in the protein component of these catalysts. By the time enzyme systems for carbohydrate metabolism had evolved, usage of nucleic acids and nucleotides by proteins in catalysis must have been well established. Consistent with this proposal is the fact that many enzymes in addition to kinases, such as dehydrogenases, sugar transferases, and thiol transferases, employ nucleotides in important catalytic roles. As our study suggests, PFK originally evolved as an enzyme that used ATP as a high energy bond donor, and the utilization of PPi as a phosphoryl donor was a late evolving adaptation.

https://openalex.org/W2037258383,"We tested the cytotoxic action of 8-hydroxyguanine (8ohG) by observing the viability of several leukemic cell lines (KG-1, U937, Jurkat and K 562) in the presence of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8ohdG), a nucleoside of 8ohG. It was found that 8ohdG showed cytotoxic action only to KG-1 and that only KG-1 showed a homozygous arginine 209 to glutamine mutation in the hOGG1 gene with an almost negligible hOGG1 enzyme activity. Possibly, the selective cytotoxicity in 8ohdG to KG-1 may be due to its low capacity to cope with an increase in the 8ohG level in DNA resulting from the incorporation of 8ohdG present in the culture media. The mutational impairment of hOGG1 in KG-1 is the first report in leukemic cell lines. Using KG-1 with impaired hOGG1, we demonstrated cytotoxicity of 8ohdG probably due to its incorporation into cellular DNA. This new property of KG-1 may allow it to serve as an useful tool for studies of OGG1, oxidative DNA damage and the cytotoxic action of 8ohG. Oncogene (2000) 19, 4476 - 4479."

GalNAc 4-sulfotransferase (GalNAc4ST) that transfers sulfate to the nonreducing terminal GalNAc residue attached to theN-linked oligosaccharides of lutropin was found in the pituitary (34Skelton T.P. Hooper L.V. Srivastava V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17142-17150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and submaxillary gland (32Hooper L.V. Beranek M.C.

Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16327-16332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Since both GalNAc4ST and C4ST transfer sulfate to position 4 of GalNAc residue, it is possible that GalNAc4ST and C4ST may belong to the same gene family as discussed above. On the basis of these considerations, we tried to find GalNAc4ST cDNA among expressed sequence-tagged cDNA clones showing homology with C4ST. One of these clones, which was expressed strongly in the pituitary, was found to encode a sulfotransferase capable of sulfating oligosaccharides of carbonic anhydrase VI. Product analysis showed that this sulfotransferase transferred sulfate to position 4 of the nonreducing terminal GalNAc residue.DISCUSSIONWe have cloned GalNAc4ST from a fetal brain library as a protein showing sequence homology with C4ST. GalNAc4ST shared several properties with C4ST: 1) both sulfotransferases were type II transmembrane proteins having four potential N-glycosylation sites. 2) Amino acid sequences of the putative PAPS-binding domains, especially 3′-PB, of these sulfotransferases were highly conserved. 3) 2-Mercaptoethanol and protamine chloride activated both sulfotransferases. 4) Both sulfotransferases transferred sulfate to position 4 of GalNAc residue. However, expression pattern in various human tissues were quite different; human C4ST was expressed strongly in peripheral blood leukocytes (27Hiraoka N. Nakagawa H. Ong E. Akama T. Fukuda M.N.

Yamamori D. Fukuta M. Kuroiwa A. Matsuda Y. Habuchi O. J. Biochem. 2000; 128: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), whereas expression of GalNAc4ST was detected in the various brain-related tissues and placenta. The strongest expression of GalNAc4ST was observed in the pituitary gland, suggesting that the cloned GalNAc4ST might participate in the biosynthesis of nonreducing terminal GalNAc(4SO4) residue found in N-linked oligosaccharides of pituitary hormones. As observed in C4ST, GalNAc4ST also contains Cys in the 5′-PSB domain, and was activated with 2-mercaptoethanol, suggesting that the Cys residue in 5′-PSB may be relevant to the stimulation of GalNAc4ST and C4ST by 2-mercaptoethanol.Although both C4ST and GalNAc4ST transfer sulfate to position 4 of GalNAc residue, a clear difference in the recognition of the neighboring sugar residue was observed between these sulfotransferases. GalNAc residues in the repeating disaccharide units of chondroitin, GalNAcβ1–4GlcA, acted as acceptor for C4ST, but did not serve as acceptor for GalNAc4ST. On the other hand, GalNAc residues in the nonreducing terminal GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAc sequence present inN-linked oligosaccharides of carbonic anhydrase VI did not serve as acceptor for C4ST. It has been reported that isoforms of a glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferase transferred sulfate to the same position of the same sugar residue, but showed difference in the recognition of the structure of the neighboring sugar residue. Both 3O-ST-1 and 3O-ST-2 transferred sulfate to position 3 of GlcN(SO4), but 3O-ST-1 required GlcA at the nonreducing side, whereas 3O-ST-2 required IdoA(2SO4) or GlcA(2SO4) (47Shworak N.W. Liu J.

HS6ST-1, -2, and -3 transferred sulfate to position 6 of GlcN(SO4) of heparan sulfate, but each isoform showed the different specificity toward the isomeric hexuronic acid adjacent to the targeted N-sulfoglucosamine; HS6ST-1 appeared to prefer iduronosyl N-sulfoglucosamine unit, while HS6ST-2 had the different substrate preference depending upon the concentration of substrate and HS6ST-3 acted on either substrate (49Habuchi H., M. Tanaka M. Habuchi O. Yoshida K. Suzuki H. Ban K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2859-2868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To understand the substrate specificity, it will be required to establish the three-dimensional interaction between each sulfotransferase and acceptor substrates.Nonreducing terminal GalNAc(4SO4)β1–4GlcNAc sequence found in pituitary hormones has been implicated in the pulsatile characteristic of the circulating hormone levels through binding to the receptor for sulfated GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAc termini expressed by hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells (12Fiete D.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A pituitary sulfotransferase responsible for the 4-O-sulfation of terminal GalNAc residue was characterized using GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–2Manα-O-(CH2)8-COOCH3(GGnM-MCO) as an acceptor (34Skelton T.P. Hooper L.V. Srivastava V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17142-17150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the sulfotransferase with the same substrate specificity as that of the pituitary sulfotransferase was purified from bovine submaxillary gland (35Hooper L.V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16327-16332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The recombinant GalNAc4ST expressed in COS-7 cells from the cDNA shared several properties with the purified GalNAc4ST. The pH optimum of both the recombinant GalNAc4ST and the purified GalNAc4ST fell between 7.0 and 7.5, and both the sulfotransferases were activated with 2-mercaptoethanol and protamine chloride. In contrast, molecular size of the purified GalNAc4ST was quite different from that of the recombinant GalNAc4ST; molecular size of the purified GalNAc4ST was 128 kDa on SDS-PAGE (35Hooper L.V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16327-16332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), whereas molecular mass of the recombinant GalNAc4ST calculated from the cDNA was 48,831. Such a discrepancy in molecular size may be explained by a hypothesis that the purified GalNAc4ST might be present as a dimer. The protein deduced from the GalNAc4ST cDNA potentially bears four N-linked oligosaccharide chains (Fig. 1 A). C4ST also contains four potential glycosylation sites (21Yamauchi S. Mita S. Matsubara T. Fukuta M. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8975-8981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and the contents of N-linked oligosaccharide of the purified C4ST was estimated as 35% as judged from the decrease in molecular size after digestion with N-glycosidase F (20Yamauchi S. Hirahara Y. Usui H. Takeda Y. Hoshino M. Fukuta M. Kimura J.H. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2456-2463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). If the content of N-linked oligosaccharides of the GalNAc4ST is nearly equal to that of C4ST, molecular size of the glycosylated form of the recombinant GalNAc4ST could be estimated as about 64 kDa. This value is just a half of the molecular size reported for the purified GalNAc4ST. Alternatively, GalNAc4ST expressed in the pituitary and GalNAc4ST present in the submaxillary gland may be quite distinct from each other.Molecular size of the purified carbonic anhydrase VI was 41 kDa as judged from the mobility on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). This value seems to be slightly smaller than the molecular size previously reported (50Fernley R.T. Coghlan J.P. Wright R.D. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After digestion with N-glycosidase F, molecular size was decreased to 35 kDa, which is nearly the same as that previously reported; therefore, the difference in the molecular size of the intact carbonic anhydrase VI might be attributable to the heterogeneity in the glycosylation.We found pNP-GalNAc served as an acceptor for the recombinant GalNAc4ST. pNP-GalNAc was reported to inhibit pituitary GalNAc4ST (34Skelton T.P. Hooper L.V. Srivastava V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17142-17150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but it has not been examined whether this material could serve as acceptor for the pituitary or submaxillary GalNAc4ST. Comparison of the hydropathy plot between GalNAc4ST and C4ST revealed that GalNAc4ST, but not C4ST, had a cluster of hydrophobic amino acid residues (Val208-Ala216) near the 5′-PSB (Fig. 1). The presence of the hydrophobic region might contribute to the recognition of hydrophobic aglycon bound to the targeted GalNAc residue such as thep-nitrophenyl group or GlcNAc residue. We found that the recombinant GalNAc4ST failed to transfer sulfate to a undecasaccharide prepared from chondroitin by the digestion with hyaluronidase and β-glucuronidase (data not shown). The penultimating hydrophilic GlcA residue contained in the undecasaccharide might inhibit the recognition of nonreducing terminal GalNAc residue by GalNAc4ST. We previously found that C6ST-containing microsomal fraction of chick embryo chondrocytes catalyzed sulfation of position 6 of the GalNAc residue of pNP-GalNAc (46Habuchi O. Conrad H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 260: 13102-13108Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), but unlike the sulfation with GalNAc4ST, 6-sulfation by the microsomal fraction was markedly inhibited by the addition of detergent.By BLAST search, we obtained human genomic clones located to chromosome 19q13.1 that contained identical sequence with the cDNA of GalNAc4ST. Genomic organization constructed from these genomic clones showed that there were at least four exons; start ATG codon and terminal TGA codon were found in the second exon and the fourth exon, respectively (Fig. 11). Nucleotide sequences of the exon-intron junctions fitted the consensus sequence except for 5′-terminal of the first exon, suggesting that the GalNAc4ST cDNA did not contain the sequence of 5′-terminal region of the first exon. PAPS-binding domains (5′-PSB and 3′-PB) were both present in the fourth exons. Sulfated sugar chains are found not only in glycosaminoglycans but also in oligosaccharides of glycoproteins and glycolipids (1Brockhausen D. Kuhns W. Trends Glycosci.

We have cloned keratan sulfate Gal-6-sulfotransferase using the homology with C6ST.

These observations suggest that, in some cases, sulfotransferases involved in the sulfation of glycosaminoglycans and sulfotransferases involved in the sulfation of oligosaccharides of glycoproteins may be included in a common gene family. Nonreducing terminal GalNAc 4-sulfate residue is present in oligosaccharides attached to pituitary glycoprotein hormones (lutropin, follitropin, and thyrotropin) (28Green E.D. van Halbeek H. Boime I.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5985-5993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and was shown to play an important role in a pulsatile appearance of lutropin in the blood through the binding to the hapatic receptor for the sulfated GalNAc residue (12Fiete D.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). GalNAc 4-sulfotransferase (GalNAc4ST) that transfers sulfate to the nonreducing terminal GalNAc residue attached to theN-linked oligosaccharides of lutropin was found in the pituitary (34Skelton T.P. Hooper L.V. Srivastava V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17142-17150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and submaxillary gland (32Hooper L.V. Beranek M.C. Manzella S.M. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5985-5993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and was purified from the bovine submaxillary gland (35Hooper L.V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16327-16332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Since both GalNAc4ST and C4ST transfer sulfate to position 4 of GalNAc residue, it is possible that GalNAc4ST and C4ST may belong to the same gene family as discussed above. On the basis of these considerations, we tried to find GalNAc4ST cDNA among expressed sequence-tagged cDNA clones showing homology with C4ST. One of these clones, which was expressed strongly in the pituitary, was found to encode a sulfotransferase capable of sulfating oligosaccharides of carbonic anhydrase VI. Product analysis showed that this sulfotransferase transferred sulfate to position 4 of the nonreducing terminal GalNAc residue. DISCUSSIONWe have cloned GalNAc4ST from a fetal brain library as a protein showing sequence homology with C4ST. GalNAc4ST shared several properties with C4ST: 1) both sulfotransferases were type II transmembrane proteins having four potential N-glycosylation sites. 2) Amino acid sequences of the putative PAPS-binding domains, especially 3′-PB, of these sulfotransferases were highly conserved. 3) 2-Mercaptoethanol and protamine chloride activated both sulfotransferases. 4) Both sulfotransferases transferred sulfate to position 4 of GalNAc residue. However, expression pattern in various human tissues were quite different; human C4ST was expressed strongly in peripheral blood leukocytes (27Hiraoka N. Nakagawa H. Ong E. Akama T. Fukuda M.N.

Yamamori D. Fukuta M. Kuroiwa A. Matsuda Y. Habuchi O. J. Biochem. 2000; 128: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), whereas expression of GalNAc4ST was detected in the various brain-related tissues and placenta. The strongest expression of GalNAc4ST was observed in the pituitary gland, suggesting that the cloned GalNAc4ST might participate in the biosynthesis of nonreducing terminal GalNAc(4SO4) residue found in N-linked oligosaccharides of pituitary hormones. As observed in C4ST, GalNAc4ST also contains Cys in the 5′-PSB domain, and was activated with 2-mercaptoethanol, suggesting that the Cys residue in 5′-PSB may be relevant to the stimulation of GalNAc4ST and C4ST by 2-mercaptoethanol.Although both C4ST and GalNAc4ST transfer sulfate to position 4 of GalNAc residue, a clear difference in the recognition of the neighboring sugar residue was observed between these sulfotransferases. GalNAc residues in the repeating disaccharide units of chondroitin, GalNAcβ1–4GlcA, acted as acceptor for C4ST, but did not serve as acceptor for GalNAc4ST. On the other hand, GalNAc residues in the nonreducing terminal GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAc sequence present inN-linked oligosaccharides of carbonic anhydrase VI did not serve as acceptor for C4ST. It has been reported that isoforms of a glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferase transferred sulfate to the same position of the same sugar residue, but showed difference in the recognition of the structure of the neighboring sugar residue. Both 3O-ST-1 and 3O-ST-2 transferred sulfate to position 3 of GlcN(SO4), but 3O-ST-1 required GlcA at the nonreducing side, whereas 3O-ST-2 required IdoA(2SO4) or GlcA(2SO4) (47Shworak N.W. Liu J.

HS6ST-1, -2, and -3 transferred sulfate to position 6 of GlcN(SO4) of heparan sulfate, but each isoform showed the different specificity toward the isomeric hexuronic acid adjacent to the targeted N-sulfoglucosamine; HS6ST-1 appeared to prefer iduronosyl N-sulfoglucosamine unit, while HS6ST-2 had the different substrate preference depending upon the concentration of substrate and HS6ST-3 acted on either substrate (49Habuchi H., M. Tanaka M. Habuchi O. Yoshida K. Suzuki H. Ban K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2859-2868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To understand the substrate specificity, it will be required to establish the three-dimensional interaction between each sulfotransferase and acceptor substrates.Nonreducing terminal GalNAc(4SO4)β1–4GlcNAc sequence found in pituitary hormones has been implicated in the pulsatile characteristic of the circulating hormone levels through binding to the receptor for sulfated GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAc termini expressed by hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells (12Fiete D. Srivastava V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. Cell. 1991; 67: 1103-1110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 33Baenziger J.U. Kumar S. Brodbeck R.M. Smith P.L. Beranek M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A pituitary sulfotransferase responsible for the 4-O-sulfation of terminal GalNAc residue was characterized using GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–2Manα-O-(CH2)8-COOCH3(GGnM-MCO) as an acceptor (34Skelton T.P. Hooper L.V. Srivastava V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17142-17150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the sulfotransferase with the same substrate specificity as that of the pituitary sulfotransferase was purified from bovine submaxillary gland (35Hooper L.V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16327-16332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The recombinant GalNAc4ST expressed in COS-7 cells from the cDNA shared several properties with the purified GalNAc4ST. The pH optimum of both the recombinant GalNAc4ST and the purified GalNAc4ST fell between 7.0 and 7.5, and both the sulfotransferases were activated with 2-mercaptoethanol and protamine chloride. In contrast, molecular size of the purified GalNAc4ST was quite different from that of the recombinant GalNAc4ST; molecular size of the purified GalNAc4ST was 128 kDa on SDS-PAGE (35Hooper L.V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16327-16332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), whereas molecular mass of the recombinant GalNAc4ST calculated from the cDNA was 48,831. Such a discrepancy in molecular size may be explained by a hypothesis that the purified GalNAc4ST might be present as a dimer. The protein deduced from the GalNAc4ST cDNA potentially bears four N-linked oligosaccharide chains (Fig. 1 A). C4ST also contains four potential glycosylation sites (21Yamauchi S. Mita S. Matsubara T. Fukuta M. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8975-8981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and the contents of N-linked oligosaccharide of the purified C4ST was estimated as 35% as judged from the decrease in molecular size after digestion with N-glycosidase F (20Yamauchi S. Hirahara Y. Usui H. Takeda Y. Hoshino M. Fukuta M. Kimura J.H. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2456-2463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). If the content of N-linked oligosaccharides of the GalNAc4ST is nearly equal to that of C4ST, molecular size of the glycosylated form of the recombinant GalNAc4ST could be estimated as about 64 kDa. This value is just a half of the molecular size reported for the purified GalNAc4ST. Alternatively, GalNAc4ST expressed in the pituitary and GalNAc4ST present in the submaxillary gland may be quite distinct from each other.Molecular size of the purified carbonic anhydrase VI was 41 kDa as judged from the mobility on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). This value seems to be slightly smaller than the molecular size previously reported (50Fernley R.T. Coghlan J.P. Wright R.D. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After digestion with N-glycosidase F, molecular size was decreased to 35 kDa, which is nearly the same as that previously reported; therefore, the difference in the molecular size of the intact carbonic anhydrase VI might be attributable to the heterogeneity in the glycosylation.We found pNP-GalNAc served as an acceptor for the recombinant GalNAc4ST. pNP-GalNAc was reported to inhibit pituitary GalNAc4ST (34Skelton T.P. Hooper L.V. Srivastava V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17142-17150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but it has not been examined whether this material could serve as acceptor for the pituitary or submaxillary GalNAc4ST. Comparison of the hydropathy plot between GalNAc4ST and C4ST revealed that GalNAc4ST, but not C4ST, had a cluster of hydrophobic amino acid residues (Val208-Ala216) near the 5′-PSB (Fig. 1). The presence of the hydrophobic region might contribute to the recognition of hydrophobic aglycon bound to the targeted GalNAc residue such as thep-nitrophenyl group or GlcNAc residue. We found that the recombinant GalNAc4ST failed to transfer sulfate to a undecasaccharide prepared from chondroitin by the digestion with hyaluronidase and β-glucuronidase (data not shown). The penultimating hydrophilic GlcA residue contained in the undecasaccharide might inhibit the recognition of nonreducing terminal GalNAc residue by GalNAc4ST. We previously found that C6ST-containing microsomal fraction of chick embryo chondrocytes catalyzed sulfation of position 6 of the GalNAc residue of pNP-GalNAc (46Habuchi O. Conrad H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 260: 13102-13108Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), but unlike the sulfation with GalNAc4ST, 6-sulfation by the microsomal fraction was markedly inhibited by the addition of detergent.By BLAST search, we obtained human genomic clones located to chromosome 19q13.1 that contained identical sequence with the cDNA of GalNAc4ST. Genomic organization constructed from these genomic clones showed that there were at least four exons; start ATG codon and terminal TGA codon were found in the second exon and the fourth exon, respectively (Fig. 11). Nucleotide sequences of the exon-intron junctions fitted the consensus sequence except for 5′-terminal of the first exon, suggesting that the GalNAc4ST cDNA did not contain the sequence of 5′-terminal region of the first exon. PAPS-binding domains (5′-PSB and 3′-PB) were both present in the fourth exons. We have cloned GalNAc4ST from a fetal brain library as a protein showing sequence homology with C4ST.

Nonreducing terminal GalNAc(4SO4)β1–4GlcNAc sequence found in pituitary hormones has been implicated in the pulsatile characteristic of the circulating hormone levels through binding to the receptor for sulfated GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAc termini expressed by hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells (12Fiete D. Srivastava V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. Cell. 1991; 67: 1103-1110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 33Baenziger J.U. Kumar S. Brodbeck R.M. Smith P.L. Beranek M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A pituitary sulfotransferase responsible for the 4-O-sulfation of terminal GalNAc residue was characterized using GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–2Manα-O-(CH2)8-COOCH3(GGnM-MCO) as an acceptor (34Skelton T.P. Hooper L.V. Srivastava V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17142-17150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the sulfotransferase with the same substrate specificity as that of the pituitary sulfotransferase was purified from bovine submaxillary gland (35Hooper L.V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16327-16332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The recombinant GalNAc4ST expressed in COS-7 cells from the cDNA shared several properties with the purified GalNAc4ST. The pH optimum of both the recombinant GalNAc4ST and the purified GalNAc4ST fell between 7.0 and 7.5, and both the sulfotransferases were activated with 2-mercaptoethanol and protamine chloride. In contrast, molecular size of the purified GalNAc4ST was quite different from that of the recombinant GalNAc4ST; molecular size of the purified GalNAc4ST was 128 kDa on SDS-PAGE (35Hooper L.V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16327-16332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), whereas molecular mass of the recombinant GalNAc4ST calculated from the cDNA was 48,831. Such a discrepancy in molecular size may be explained by a hypothesis that the purified GalNAc4ST might be present as a dimer. The protein deduced from the GalNAc4ST cDNA potentially bears four N-linked oligosaccharide chains (Fig. 1 A). C4ST also contains four potential glycosylation sites (21Yamauchi S. Mita S. Matsubara T. Fukuta M. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8975-8981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and the contents of N-linked oligosaccharide of the purified C4ST was estimated as 35% as judged from the decrease in molecular size after digestion with N-glycosidase F (20Yamauchi S. Hirahara Y. Usui H. Takeda Y. Hoshino M. Fukuta M. Kimura J.H. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2456-2463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). If the content of N-linked oligosaccharides of the GalNAc4ST is nearly equal to that of C4ST, molecular size of the glycosylated form of the recombinant GalNAc4ST could be estimated as about 64 kDa. This value is just a half of the molecular size reported for the purified GalNAc4ST. Alternatively, GalNAc4ST expressed in the pituitary and GalNAc4ST present in the submaxillary gland may be quite distinct from each other. Molecular size of the purified carbonic anhydrase VI was 41 kDa as judged from the mobility on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). This value seems to be slightly smaller than the molecular size previously reported (50Fernley R.T. Coghlan J.P. Wright R.D. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After digestion with N-glycosidase F, molecular size was decreased to 35 kDa, which is nearly the same as that previously reported; therefore, the difference in the molecular size of the intact carbonic anhydrase VI might be attributable to the heterogeneity in the glycosylation. We found pNP-GalNAc served as an acceptor for the recombinant GalNAc4ST. pNP-GalNAc was reported to inhibit pituitary GalNAc4ST (34Skelton T.P. Hooper L.V. Srivastava V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17142-17150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but it has not been examined whether this material could serve as acceptor for the pituitary or submaxillary GalNAc4ST. Comparison of the hydropathy plot between GalNAc4ST and C4ST revealed that GalNAc4ST, but not C4ST, had a cluster of hydrophobic amino acid residues (Val208-Ala216) near the 5′-PSB (Fig. 1). The presence of the hydrophobic region might contribute to the recognition of hydrophobic aglycon bound to the targeted GalNAc residue such as thep-nitrophenyl group or GlcNAc residue. We found that the recombinant GalNAc4ST failed to transfer sulfate to a undecasaccharide prepared from chondroitin by the digestion with hyaluronidase and β-glucuronidase (data not shown). The penultimating hydrophilic GlcA residue contained in the undecasaccharide might inhibit the recognition of nonreducing terminal GalNAc residue by GalNAc4ST. We previously found that C6ST-containing microsomal fraction of chick embryo chondrocytes catalyzed sulfation of position 6 of the GalNAc residue of pNP-GalNAc (46Habuchi O. Conrad H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 260: 13102-13108Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), but unlike the sulfation with GalNAc4ST, 6-sulfation by the microsomal fraction was markedly inhibited by the addition of detergent. By BLAST search, we obtained human genomic clones located to chromosome 19q13.1 that contained identical sequence with the cDNA of GalNAc4ST. Genomic organization constructed from these genomic clones showed that there were at least four exons; start ATG codon and terminal TGA codon were found in the second exon and the fourth exon, respectively (Fig. 11). Nucleotide sequences of the exon-intron junctions fitted the consensus sequence except for 5′-terminal of the first exon, suggesting that the GalNAc4ST cDNA did not contain the sequence of 5′-terminal region of the first exon. PAPS-binding domains (5′-PSB and 3′-PB) were both present in the fourth exons."

https://openalex.org/W2093630156,"The α-mannosyltransferase AceA fromAcetobacter xylinum belongs to the CaZY family 4 of retaining glycosyltransferases. We have identified a series of either highly conserved or invariant residues that are found in all family 4 enzymes as well as other retaining glycosyltransferases. These residues included Glu-287 and Glu-295, which comprise an EX7E motif and have been proposed to be involved in catalysis. Alanine replacements of each conserved residue were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. The mannosyltransferase activity of each mutant was examined by both an in vitrotransferase assay using recombinant mutant AceA expressed inEscherichia coli and by an in vivo rescue assay by expressing the mutant AceA in a Xanthomonas campestris gumH − strain. We found that only mutants K211A and E287A lost all detectable activity both in vitro andin vivo, whereas E295A retained residual activity in the more sensitive in vivo assay. H127A and S162A each retained reduced but significant activities both in vitro andin vivo. Secondary structure predictions of AceA and subsequent comparison with the crystal structures of the T4 β-glucosyltransferase and MurG suggest that AceA Lys-211 and Glu-295 are involved in nucleotide sugar donor binding, leaving Glu-287 of the EX7E as a potential catalytic residue."
