https://openalex.org/W3025987322,"An antibody defense against COVID-19 One of the responses of the immune system to invading viruses is the production of antibodies. Some of these are neutralizing, meaning that they prevent the virus from being infectious, and can thus be used to treat viral diseases. Wu et al. isolated four neutralizing antibodies from a convalescent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient. Two of the antibodies, B38 and H4, blocked the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein from binding to the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The structure of the RBD bound to B38 shows that the B38-binding site overlaps with the binding site for ACE2. Although H4 also blocks RBD binding to ACE2, it binds at a different site, and thus the two antibodies can bind simultaneously. This pair of antibodies could potentially be used together in clinical applications. Science , this issue p. 1274"

Quarantine measures were effective in reducing transmission by 84%, and some relaxation of social isolation was expected in May. Salje et al. fit transmission models for the epidemic in France to hospital admissions. The authors forecast that 2.9 million people will have been infected by 11 May, representing 4.4% of the population—a value inadequate for herd immunity. Daily critical care hospitalizations should reduce from several hundreds to tens of cases, but control will remain a delicate balancing act. Any relaxation of lockdown in France will have to be carefully controlled and monitored to avoid undermining more optimistic forecasts. Science , this issue p. 208"
https://openalex.org/W3026033619,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant internal modification in mRNA, has been implicated in tumorigenesis. As an m6A demethylase, ALKBH5 has been shown to promote the development of breast cancer and brain tumors. However, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ALKBH5 was reported to be frequently deleted, implying a tumor-suppressor role. Here, we show that ALKBH5 deletion is rare in human AML; instead, ALKBH5 is aberrantly overexpressed in AML. Moreover, its increased expression correlates with poor prognosis in AML patients. We demonstrate that ALKBH5 is required for the development and maintenance of AML and self-renewal of leukemia stem/initiating cells (LSCs/LICs) but not essential for normal hematopoiesis. Mechanistically, ALKBH5 exerts tumor-promoting effects in AML by post-transcriptional regulation of its critical targets such as TACC3, a prognosis-associated oncogene in various cancers. Collectively, our findings reveal crucial functions of ALKBH5 in leukemogenesis and LSC/LIC self-renewal/maintenance and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting the ALKBH5/m6A axis."
https://openalex.org/W3024244355,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a commonly present modification of mammalian mRNAs and plays key roles in various cellular processes. m6A modifiers catalyze this reversible modification. However, the underlying mechanisms by which these m6A modifiers are regulated remain elusive. Here we show that expression of m6A demethylase ALKBH5 is regulated by chromatin state alteration during leukemogenesis of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and ALKBH5 is required for maintaining leukemia stem cell (LSC) function but is dispensable for normal hematopoiesis. Mechanistically, KDM4C regulates ALKBH5 expression via increasing chromatin accessibility of ALKBH5 locus, by reducing H3K9me3 levels and promoting recruitment of MYB and Pol II. Moreover, ALKBH5 affects mRNA stability of receptor tyrosine kinase AXL in an m6A-dependent way. Thus, our findings link chromatin state dynamics with expression regulation of m6A modifiers and uncover a selective and critical role of ALKBH5 in AML that might act as a therapeutic target of specific targeting LSCs."
https://openalex.org/W3024555221,"At the species level, immunity depends on the selection and transmission of protective components of the immune system. A microbe-induced population of RORγ-expressing regulatory T cells (Tregs) is essential in controlling gut inflammation. We uncovered a non-genetic, non-epigenetic, non-microbial mode of transmission of their homeostatic setpoint. RORγ+ Treg proportions varied between inbred mouse strains, a trait transmitted by the mother during a tight age window after birth but stable for life, resistant to many microbial or cellular perturbations, then further transferred by females for multiple generations. RORγ+ Treg proportions negatively correlated with IgA production and coating of gut commensals, traits also subject to maternal transmission, in an immunoglobulin- and RORγ+ Treg-dependent manner. We propose a model based on a double-negative feedback loop, vertically transmitted via the entero-mammary axis. This immunologic mode of multi-generational transmission may provide adaptability and modulate the genetic tuning of gut immune responses and inflammatory disease susceptibility."

For unknown reasons, bilirubin levels are negatively associated with obesity and diabetes. Here, using mice and an array of approaches, including MRI to assess body composition, biochemical assays to measure bilirubin and fatty acids, MitoTracker-based mitochondrial analysis, immunofluorescence, and high-throughput coregulator analysis, we show that bilirubin functions as a molecular switch for the nuclear receptor transcription factor peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα). Bilirubin exerted its effects by recruiting and dissociating specific coregulators in WAT, driving the expression of PPARα target genes such as uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) and adrenoreceptor β 3 (Adrb3). We also found that bilirubin is a selective ligand for PPARα and does not affect the activities of the related proteins PPARγ and PPARδ. We further found that diet-induced obese mice with mild hyperbilirubinemia have reduced WAT size and an increased number of mitochondria, associated with a restructuring of PPARα-binding coregulators. We conclude that bilirubin strongly affects organismal body weight by reshaping the PPARα coregulator profile, remodeling WAT to improve metabolic function, and reducing fat accumulation.

In the past, our understanding of bilirubin has been shaped by the dramatic consequences of extreme hyperbilirubinemia seen in pathological jaundice and Crigler–Najjar syndrome. This led to the idea that bilirubin is categorically harmful. However, now there is compelling evidence that hypobilirubinemia (<10 μm in men and <8 μm in women (1Torgerson J.S. Lindroos A.K.

These data suggest that bilirubin may elicit molecular signaling pathways in various adipose stores, in which it regulates adiposity and glucose sensitivity. In humans and rodents, adipose tissue depots have different functions, especially in their responses to stimuli (13John K. Marino J.S. Sanchez E.R. Hinds Jr., T.D. The glucocorticoid receptor: cause of or cure for obesity?.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2016; 310 (26714851): E249-E25710.1152/ajpendo.00478.2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). White adipose tissue (WAT) responds to nutrient overload and is a lipid-storing organ located viscerally and subcutaneously. The visceral portion expands during obesity and secrets inflammatory factors that contribute to low-grade chronic inflammation and insulin-resistant diabetes. Brown adipose tissue (BAT), however, responds to sympathetic stimuli and increases energy expenditure. Pharmacological stimuli can activate pathways in WAT that increase the burning of fat for energy expenditure known as beiging or browning named from the amplified mitochondrial levels. Activation of the browning of WAT, increasing energy expenditure and boosting the burning of fat, has significant implications in reducing adiposity and insulin resistance (14Thyagarajan B. Foster M.T. Beiging of white adipose tissue as a therapeutic strategy for weight loss in humans.Horm. Mol. Biol. Clin.

Mostly, these processes are mediated by mitochondrial uncoupling proteins during physical activity or brown fat–mediated thermogenesis. During thermogenesis, β3 adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) signaling activates the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), prompting protons to leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane, increasing oxygen consumption (17Seale P.

Bilirubin has been shown to reduce body weight, but its role in mitochondrial function in WAT is unknown. Our previous studies have demonstrated a potential relationship between bilirubin and PPARα and that bilirubin is possibly a ligand for PPARs.

However, PPARα is probably one of many factors involved in the effects of bilirubin, and bilirubin may likely bind other PPARs. Compounds that target the PPARs may simultaneously activate all three PPARs (PPAR pan-agonists) or can have selective PPAR modulation (SPPARM) (27Dunn F.L. Higgins L.S. Fredrickson J. DePaoli A.M.

Here, we examined whether bilirubin serves as a metabolic hormone because it may have a direct action on a target (PPARs) to lessen fat storage and improve adipocyte function. The mechanisms of the lipid-reducing capacity of bilirubin on WAT or BAT or direct signaling actions are unknown. We set out to comprehensively map the hormonal responses to bilirubin in adipose tissues and whether its activities span across all of the PPAR isoforms. We found that bilirubin has selective binding to PPARα and causes the recruitment and dissociation of a specific set of coregulators, which induces mitochondrial function, decreasing WAT size, ultimately affecting organismal metabolic balance and glucose homeostasis. Taken together, our findings indicate that bilirubin is a metabolic hormone that controls WAT tissue expansion, lessening hypertrophy and glucose intolerance. We and others have previously shown that bilirubin treatment reduces body weight and lipid accumulation in adipocytes (3Dong H. Huang H. Yun X. Kim D.S. Yue Y. Wu H. Sutter A. Chavin K.D.

However, whether this occurs by exclusive activation of PPARα or by discriminate PPARγ regulation or is a dual/pan-PPAR ligand remains to be determined. We first set out to ascertain whether bilirubin has actions on all PPAR isoforms (α, γ, and β/δ) or is a SPPARM to mediate its lipid-lowering effects. Using the Gal4 transcription factor reporter system fused with the PPAR ligand-binding domains (LBDs) for each isoform, we compared bilirubin dose responses for all PPAR-LBDs. The benefit of the Gal4 system is that endogenous PPARs are not responsive to the promoter, and only molecules that bind to the LBD drive expression. The Gal4-hPPARα-LBD responded to increasing bilirubin levels at the Gal4-driven upstream activation sequence (UAS) promoter (Fig. 1A, left). We have shown that bilirubin induces PPARα transactivation for the minimal PPAR response element (PPRE-3tk-luc) (25Stec D.E. John K. Trabbic C.J. Luniwal A. Hankins M.W. Baum J. Hinds Jr., T.D.

Weyers B. Desmet S.J. Deckers J. Ray D.W. Staels B. De Bosscher K. Molecular actions of PPARα in lipid metabolism and inflammation.Endocr. Rev. 2018; 39 (30020428): 760-80210.1210/er.2018-00064Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The RXR heterodimer is not needed for the Gal4 system, eliminating the possibility that bilirubin signals RXR. Supporting that bilirubin binds to the PPARα LBD, cotreatment with PPARα antagonist GW6471 attenuated bilirubin responses at each dose (Fig. 1A, left). Dose response of bilirubin on the Gal4-hPPARα-LBD showed that bilirubin has an EC50 = 9.021 μm for PPARα activation (Fig. 1A, right). Analysis of bilirubin responsiveness on the Gal4-PPARγ-LBD or Gal4-PPARδ-LBD showed that there was no action on these isoforms (Figs. 1, B and C). To determine whether bilirubin is a competitive antagonist for PPARγ, we cotreated with agonist rosiglitazone and increasing doses of bilirubin, which we found did not affect the rosiglitazone-induced transactivation of the Gal4-hPPARγ-LBD. Similarly, increasing doses of rosiglitazone in the presence or absence of 50 μm bilirubin had no significant effect on the Gal4-hPPARγ-LBD transactivity (Fig. S1A). This was also found for the Gal4-hPPARδ-LBD and cotreatment with GW501516 PPARδ agonist and increasing doses of bilirubin (Fig. 1C). These data show that bilirubin is a selective ligand for PPARα but does not signal PPARγ or PPARδ at least via by binding to their LBDs. To determine whether bilirubin directly binds PPARα, we used the autofluorescent properties of bilirubin, which has been extensively studied for bilirubin bound to albumin (Fig. S1B) (34Lamola A.A.

When bilirubin binds albumin and is excited by light, it undergoes a conformational change (Z → E configuration). This configuration, now photobilirubin/lumirubin, allows for greater mobility of the pyrrole rings and subsequent emission behavior (38Lightner D.A. Wooldridge T.A. McDonagh A.F.

Utilizing the property of bilirubin to fluoresce, aside from when bound to albumin, we found that the purified PPARα-LBD protein interacts with bilirubin and, when excited, has fluorescence (Fig. 1D). We used this method to determine whether we could displace bilirubin-PPARα fluorescence with the known ligand fenofibrate, which does not induce fluorescence under excitation when bound to PPARα. Hence, this represents a competitive ligand-binding assay by displacement of the bilirubin-PPARα interaction, reducing fluorescence. Using purified full-length PPARα protein, we treated with bilirubin and compared it with cotreatments of fenofibrate and bilirubin. We found that fenofibrate significantly reduced bilirubin-PPARα autofluorescence (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, oleic acid, an unsaturated fatty acid that is an endogenous ligand for PPARα, reduced the bilirubin-PPARα fluorescent signal (Fig. S1C). The competitive inhibition was specific for PPARα, as fenofibrate did not displace bilirubin-albumin autofluorescence (Fig. S1B). These data indicate that bilirubin is an endogenous ligand that binds directly to the PPARα LBD. To compare the effects of bilirubin on PPARα or PPARγ and mitochondrial function, we used a SeaHorse XFe96 analyzer to measure oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in fully differentiated 3T3-L1-WAT adipocytes treated with biliverdin, WY 14,643 (PPARα agonist), or rosiglitazone (PPARγ agonist).

https://openalex.org/W3024267519,"Generation and subsequent analysis of mutants is critical to understanding the functions of genes and proteins. Here we describe TIM, an efficient, cost-effective, CRISPR-based targeted insertional mutagenesis method for the model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. TIM utilizes delivery into the cell of a Cas9-guide RNA (gRNA) ribonucleoprotein (RNP) together with exogenous double-stranded (donor) DNA. The donor DNA contains gene-specific homology arms and an integral antibiotic-resistance gene that inserts at the double-stranded break generated by Cas9. After optimizing multiple parameters of this method, we were able to generate mutants for six out of six different genes in two different cell-walled strains with mutation efficiencies ranging from 40% to 95%. Furthermore, these high efficiencies allowed simultaneous targeting of two separate genes in a single experiment. TIM is flexible with regard to many parameters and can be carried out using either electroporation or the glass-bead method for delivery of the RNP and donor DNA. TIM achieves a far higher mutation rate than any previously reported for CRISPR-based methods in C. reinhardtii and promises to be effective for many, if not all, non-essential nuclear genes."
https://openalex.org/W3024849063,"Vaccination against lumpy skin disease (LSD) is crucial for maintaining the health of animals and the economic sustainability of farming. Either homologous vaccines consisting of live attenuated LSD virus (LSDV) or heterologous vaccines consisting of live attenuated sheeppox or goatpox virus (SPPV/GPPV) can be used for control of LSDV. Although SPPV/GTPV-based vaccines exhibit slightly lower efficacy than live attenuated LSDV vaccines, they do not cause vaccine-induced viremia, fever, and clinical symptoms of the disease following vaccination, caused by the replication capacity of live attenuated LSDVs. Recombination of capripoxviruses in the field was a long-standing hypothesis until a naturally occurring recombinant LSDV vaccine isolate was detected in Russia, where the sheeppox vaccine alone is used. This occurred after the initiation of vaccination campaigns using LSDV vaccines in the neighboring countries in 2017, when the first cases of presumed vaccine-like isolate circulation were documented with concurrent detection of a recombinant vaccine isolate in the field. The follow-up findings presented herein show that during the period from 2015 to 2018, the molecular epidemiology of LSDV in Russia split into two independent waves. The 2015–2016 epidemic was attributable to the field isolate. Whereas the 2017 epidemic and, in particular, the 2018 epidemic represented novel disease importations that were not genetically linked to the 2015–2016 field-type incursions. This demonstrated a new emergence rather than the continuation of the field-type epidemic. Since recombinant vaccine-like LSDV isolates appear to have entrenched across the country’s border, the policy of using certain live vaccines requires revision in the context of the biosafety threat it presents."

Design Cross-sectional study. Setting 21 European countries. Participants 37 672 adults participating in the 7th round of the European Social Survey. Main outcome measures Fruit and vegetable consumption was measured using two single frequency questions. Responses were dichotomized into low (<once a day) and high (≥once a day) consumption. The association between consumption of fruit and vegetables and gender, educational level, regional affiliation was examined using logistic regression analyses. Results Overall, females showed increased odds of consuming fruit (OR 1.71 (95%CI:1.62, 1.79) and vegetable (1.59 (1.51, 1.67)) compared to males and high educated participants showed increased odds of consuming fruit (1.53 (1.43, 1.63)) and vegetables (1.86 (1.74, 2.00)) compared to low educated participants. Our results also showed that participants living in Eastern Europe had the lowest odds of consuming fruit and vegetables, whereas participants from Southern- and Northern Europe had the highest odds of consuming fruit and vegetables, respectively. Results from interaction analyses confirmed the positive association between fruit and vegetable consumption and educational level, although for some European regions, decreased odds of fruit and vegetables was observed among medium educated participants compared to those with low education. Conclusions Overall, the present study showed that being female and having a high education were associated with increased consumption of fruit and vegetables. However, the direction and strength of these relationships depends on regional affiliations."
https://openalex.org/W3025585054,"Introduction Research productivity has been linked to a country’s intellectual and economic wealth. Further analysis is needed to assess the association between the distribution of research across disciplines and the economic status of countries. Methods By using 55 years of data, spanning 1962 to 2017, of Elsevier publications across a large set of research disciplines and countries globally, this manuscript explores the relationship and evolution of relative research productivity across different disciplines through a network analysis. It also explores the associations of those with economic productivity categories, as measured by the World Bank economic classification. Additional analysis of discipline similarities is possible by exploring the cross-country evolution of those disciplines. Results Results show similarities in the relative importance of research disciplines among most high-income countries, with larger idiosyncrasies appearing among the remaining countries. This group of high-income countries shows similarities in the dynamics of the relative distribution of research productivity over time, forming a stable research productivity cluster. Lower income countries form smaller, more independent and evolving clusters, and differ significantly from each other and from higher income countries in the relative importance of their research emphases. Country-based similarities in research productivity profiles also appear to be influenced by geographical proximity. Conclusions This new form of analyses of research productivity, and its relation to economic status, reveals novel insights to the dynamics of the economic and research structure of countries. This allows for a deeper understanding of the role a country’s research structure may play in shaping its economy, and also identification of benchmark resource allocations across disciplines for developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W3025195798,"At a country level, population obesity prevalence is often associated with economic affluence, reflecting a potential adverse outcome concomitant with economic growth. We estimated the pattern and strength of the empirically observed relationship between national income and adult obesity prevalence, and the moderating role of countries' macro-environments on this relationship.We assembled data on national obesity prevalence, income and a range of variables that characterize macro-environments related to 147 countries from multiple international organizations and databases. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the relationship (elasticities) between national income (using Gross Domestic Product Per Capita, GDPPC) and adult obesity prevalence, and the moderating effects of five different dimensions (globalization orientation, demographic characteristics, economic environment, labor market characteristics, and strength of health policies) of countries' macro-environments on the income elasticities. Using the latest (2019-2024) available national income growth projections from the International Monetary Fund, we forecast future global trends in obesity prevalence.Over the 40-years 1975-2014, adult obesity prevalence increased at a declining rate with GDPPC across the 147 countries. The mean income elasticity estimates were 1.23 (95% credible interval 1.04-1.42) for males and 1.01 (0.82-1.18) for females. The elasticities were positively associated with the extent of political globalization and negatively associated with urbanization and share of agriculture in the national GDP. Income based projections indicate that obesity prevalence would continue to grow at an average annual rate of 2.47% across the studied countries during 2019-2024.Population obesity prevalence exhibits a positive relationship with national income and there is no evidence that the relationship, while weakening, actually turns negative at higher income levels (""obesity Kuznets curve""). Based on current trends, global obesity prevalence will continue to increase during 2019-2024, with the rate of growth higher in low- and middle-income countries. As most people currently live in low- and middle-income countries with rising incomes, our findings underscore the urgent societal imperatives for effective policy initiatives, especially those that target the concomitant ""nutrition transition"" process with economic affluence, to break or at least further weaken the positive relationship of population obesity prevalence with national income."

Therefore suppression of microglial activation can be an appropriate strategy for combating neurodegenerative diseases. Betanin is a red food dye that acts as free radical scavenger and can be a promising candidate for this purpose. In this study, purification of betanin from red beetroots was carried out by normal phase colum chromatography, yielding 500 mg of betanin from 100 g of red beetroot. The purified betanin was evaluated by TLC, UV-visible, HPLC, ESI-MASS, FT-IR spectroscopy. Investigation on the inhibitory effect of betanin on activated microglia was performed using primary microglial culture. The results showed that betanin significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide induced microglial function including the production of nitric oxide free radicals, reactive oxygen species, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). Moreover, betanin modulated mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosomal membrane permeabilization and adenosine triphosphate. We further investigated the interaction of betanin with TNF-α, IL-6 and Nitric oxide synthase (iNOS or NOS2) using in silico molecular docking analysis. The docking results demonstrated that betanin have significant negative binding energy against active sites of TNF-α, IL-6 and iNOS."
https://openalex.org/W3024267816,"Genomic selection has been extensively implemented in plant breeding schemes. Genomic selection incorporates dense genome-wide markers to predict the breeding values for important traits based on information from genotype and phenotype records on traits of interest in a reference population. To date, most relevant investigations have been performed using single trait genomic prediction models (STGP). However, records for several traits at once are usually documented for breeding lines in commercial breeding programs. By incorporating benefits from genetic characterizations of correlated phenotypes, multiple trait genomic prediction (MTGP) may be a useful tool for improving prediction accuracy in genetic evaluations. The objective of this study was to test whether the use of MTGP and including proper modeling of spatial effects can improve the prediction accuracy of breeding values in commercial barley and wheat breeding lines. We genotyped 1,317 spring barley and 1,325 winter wheat lines from a commercial breeding program with the Illumina 9K barley and 15K wheat SNP-chip (respectively) and phenotyped them across multiple years and locations. Results showed that the MTGP approach increased correlations between future performance and estimated breeding value of yields by 7% in barley and by 57% in wheat relative to using the STGP approach for each trait individually. Analyses combining genomic data, pedigree information, and proper modeling of spatial effects further increased the prediction accuracy by 4% in barley and 3% in wheat relative to the model using genomic relationships only. The prediction accuracy for yield in wheat and barley yield trait breeding, were improved by combining MTGP and spatial effects in the model."
https://openalex.org/W3025248465,"Abstract Sirtuin 7 (SIRT7), an NAD + -dependent deacetylase, plays vital roles in energy sensing, but the underlying mechanisms of action remain less clear. Here, we report that SIRT7 is required for p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest during glucose deprivation. We show that SIRT7 directly interacts with p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) and the affinity for this interaction increases during glucose deprivation. Upon binding, SIRT7 deacetylates PCAF at lysine 720 (K720), which augments PCAF binding to murine double minute (MDM2), the p53 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to accelerated MDM2 degradation. This effect results in upregulated expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor, p21 Waf1/Cip1 , which further leads to cell-cycle arrest and decreased cell viability. These data highlight the importance of the SIRT7–PCAF interaction in regulating p53 activity and cell-cycle progression during conditions of glucose deprivation. This axis may represent a new avenue to design effective therapeutics based on tumor starvation."

Using a large sample of schizophrenia patients and controls and a battery of tasks across multiple cognitive domains, we examined whether patients show accelerated age-related decline in cognition and whether an age-related effect differ between females and males. We utilized data of 1,415 schizophrenia patients and 1,062 healthy community collected by the second phase of the Consortium on the Genetics of Schizophrenia (COGS-2). A battery of cognitive tasks included the Letter-Number Span Task, two forms of the Continuous Performance Test, the California Verbal Learning Test, Second Edition, the Penn Emotion Identification Test and the Penn Facial Memory Test. The effect of age and gender on cognitive performance was examined with a general linear model. We observed age-related changes on most cognitive measures, which was similar between males and females. Compared to controls, patients showed greater deterioration in performance on attention/vigilance and greater slowness of processing social information with increasing age. However, controls showed greater age-related changes in working memory and verbal memory compared to patients. Age-related changes (η2p of 0.001 to .008) were much smaller than between-group differences (η2p of 0.005 to .037). This study found that patients showed continued decline of cognition on some domains but stable impairment or even less decline on other domains with increasing age. These findings indicate that age-related changes in cognition in schizophrenia are subtle and not uniform across multiple cognitive domains."

This cross-sectional study involved the secondary data analysis of the 2016 Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey, a nationwide multistage cluster survey. Data were collected from 1,840 7th grade students in South Korea and analyzed with descriptive statistics, Pearson’s correlation coefficients, and a path analysis using SPSS 21.0 and AMOS 23.0. The path analysis showed that self-esteem and aggressiveness directly influenced smartphone dependency, while affective parenting attitude, peer attachment, resilience, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms indirectly influenced it. The explanatory variables accounted for 18.3% of the total variance. In conclusion, parents’ education on positive parenting and guidance concerning adolescents’ smartphone use is necessary to reduce adolescents’ smartphone dependency. It may also prove effective to promote adolescents’ interpersonal skills and self-esteem to foster positive peer relationships and self-control concerning smartphone use."
https://openalex.org/W3024854663,"Because of its powerful genetics, the adult zebrafish has been increasingly used for studying cardiovascular diseases. Considering its heart rate of ~100 beats per minute at ambient temperature, which is very close to human, we assessed the use of this vertebrate animal for modeling heart rhythm disorders such as sinus arrest (SA) and sick sinus syndrome (SSS). We firstly optimized a protocol to measure electrocardiogram in adult zebrafish. We determined the location of the probes, implemented an open-chest microsurgery procedure, measured the effects of temperature, and determined appropriate anesthesia dose and time. We then proposed an PP interval of more than 1.5 seconds as an arbitrary criterion to define an SA episode in an adult fish at ambient temperature, based on comparison between the current definition of an SA episode in humans and our studies of candidate SA episodes in aged wild-type fish and Tg(SCN5A-D1275N) fish (a fish model for inherited SSS). With this criterion, a subpopulation of about 5% wild-type fish can be considered to have SA episodes, and this percentage significantly increases to about 25% in 3-year-old fish. In response to atropine, this subpopulation has both common SSS phenotypic traits that are shared with the Tg(SCN5A-D1275N) model, such as bradycardia; and unique SSS phenotypic traits, such as increased QRS/P ratio and chronotropic incompetence. In summary, this study defined baseline SA and SSS in adult zebrafish and underscored use of the zebrafish as an alternative model to study aging-associated SSS."

This analysis assesses the equivalence of modern contraceptive prevalence estimates between a nationally representative FTF survey and a cell phone survey using random digit dialing (RDD) among women of reproductive age in Burkina Faso.We analyzed data from two surveys conducted in Burkina Faso between December 2017 and May 2018. The FTF survey conducted by Performance Monitoring and Accountability (PMA2020) comprised a nationally representative sample of 3,556 women of reproductive age (15-49 years). The RDD survey was conducted using computer-assisted telephone interviewing and included 2,379 women of reproductive age.Compared to FTF respondents, women in the RDD sample were younger, were more likely to have a secondary degree and to speak French. RDD respondents were more likely to report using modern contraceptive use (40%) compared to FTF respondents (26%) and the difference remained unchanged after applying post-stratification weights to the RDD sample (39%). This difference surpassed the equivalence margin of 4%. The RDD sample also produced higher estimates of contraceptive use than the subsample of women who owned a phone in the FTF sample (32%). After adjusting for women's sociodemographic factors, the odds of contraceptive use were 1.9 times higher (95% CI: 1.6-2.2) in the RDD survey compared to the FTF survey and 1.6 times higher (95% CI: 1.3-1.8) compared to FTF phone owners.Modern contraceptive prevalence in Burkina Faso is over-estimated when using a cell phone RDD survey, even after adjusting for a number of sociodemographic factors.

https://openalex.org/W3025398729,"Endosalpingiosis, traditionally regarded as an incidental pathological finding, was recently reported to have an association with gynecologic malignancies. To determine the prevalence of endosalpingiosis, we evaluated all benign appearing adnexal lesions using the Sectioning and Extensively Examining-Fimbria (SEE-Fim) protocol, and queried the pathology database for the presence of endosalpingiosis, gynecologic malignancy, endometriosis, Walthard nests, and paratubal cysts. Using the SEE-Fim protocol, the prevalence of endosalpingiosis, endometriosis, Walthard nests, and paratubal cysts were 22%, 45%, 33%, and 42% respectively, substantially higher than previously reported. All lesions were observed to increase with age except endometriosis which increased until menopause then decreased dramatically. Among specimens including ovarian tissue, the prevalence of implantation of at least one lesion type was ubiquitous in patients age 51 and older (93%). The clinical significance of endosalpingiosis should be a continued area of research with larger trials assessing prevalence, factors affecting incidence, and association with malignancy. Our findings contribute to elucidating the origin of ectopic lesions and gynecologic disease risk."
https://openalex.org/W3024543067,"Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) levels have prognostic and predictive values in treatment-naïve breast cancers. However, there have been controversies regarding TIL subset changes and their clinical implications in post-treatment breast cancers. This study aimed to explore change and prognostic significance of TIL subset infiltration after primary systemic therapy (PST) in breast cancer. One-hundred-fifty-five patients who had residual disease after anthracycline- or anthracycline plus taxane-based PST were included. The quantities of intratumoral and stromal TIL subsets (CD8+, CD4+, and FOXP3+ TILs) in pre- and post-PST breast cancer samples, as well as changes between them, were analyzed along with their correlations with clinicopathologic features and outcome of patients. As a whole, intratumoral CD8+ and CD4+ TILs increased after PST while stromal TILs decreased. Both intratumoral and stromal FOXP3+ TILs decreased after PST. The chemo-sensitive group [residual cancer burden (RCB) class I and II] showed the same pattern of change in intratumoral CD8+ TILs as the whole group, whereas the chemo-resistant group (RCB class III) showed no significant change in intratumoral CD8+ TIL infiltration after PST. Survival analyses for each TIL subset as well as their ratios revealed that high levels of intratumoral, stromal, and total CD8+ TIL infiltration after PST were independent predictors of longer patient survival. In subgroup analyses, CD8+ TIL infiltration after PST revealed prognostic significance in the chemo-resistant group but not in the chemo-sensitive group. In conclusion, infiltration of CD8+, CD4+, and FOXP3+ TIL changed after PST in the intratumoral and stromal compartments. Especially, increase of intratumoral CD8+ TILs was associated with chemo-responsiveness. Moreover, CD8+ TIL status in residual tumors after PST may be used as a potential prognostic marker in breast cancer patients who receive PST and provide additional prognostic information to chemo-resistant group."
https://openalex.org/W3025152195,"The aims of this study were (1) to investigate whether 6-7-year-old children are accurate in perceiving their actual movement competence, and (2) to examine possible age- and gender-related differences. A total of 603 children (301 girls and 302 boys, aged 6 to 7 years) were assessed on the execution accuracy of six locomotor skills and six object control skills using the Test of Gross Motor Development (TGMD-2). The perceived competence of the same skills, plus six active play activities, was also gauged through the Pictorial Scale of Perceived Movement Skill Competence (PMSC-2). The factorial validity of the TGMD-2 and PMSC-2 scales was preliminarily ascertained using a Bayesian structural equation modeling approach. The relationships between the latent factors of the two instruments were then assessed. Gender and age differences were also examined. The factorial validity of the TGMD-2 and the PMSC-2 was confirmed after some adjustments. A subsequent analysis of the relationship between the latent factors (i.e., locomotor skills and object control) of the two instruments yielded very low estimates. Finally, boys and older children showed better competence in object control skills compared to their counterparts. Weak associations between actual and perceived competence suggest that inaccuracy in children's perceptions can be likely due to a still limited development of cognitive skills needed for the evaluation of the own competence. From an applied perspective, interventions aimed at improving actual motor competence may also increase children's self-perceived motor competence and their motivation toward physical activity."
https://openalex.org/W3025048884,"Ecological restoration of degraded riparian Tugai forests is a key driver to combat desertification in arid regions. Previous studies have focused mainly on changes in groundwater as the underlying mechanisms of Tugai forest's decline. We evaluated species composition and diversity of Tugai forest and their relationship to groundwater, soil salinity, and soil nutrient. Using 73 quadrats (100 m × 100 m) from 13 transects located perpendicularly to river in the upper reaches of the Tarim River. Eighteen plant species belonging to sixteen genera and eight families were recorded, and the dominant species included Populus euphratica, Phragmites communis, and Tamarix ramosissima. Three P. euphratica stand ages were detected: young stand, mature stand, and old stand. There were significant differences in species diversity, groundwater depth, groundwater salinity, distance from the quadrat to the river channel, soil moisture content, pH, electrical conductivity, total salt, Cl-, SO42-, Ca2-, Mg2+, Na+, K+, soil organic carbon, and soil organic matter across the stand ages. Seven species were identified as indicators of the three stand ages. Redundancy analysis indicated that the Tugai forest diversity indices were negatively correlated with groundwater depth, groundwater salinity, and distance from the river, and positively associated with electrical conductivity, total salt, pH, Cl-, SO42-, CO32-, soil organic matter, soil organic carbon, and soil moisture content. Plant diversity was the highest at 3-6 m groundwater depth, followed by 0-3 m and then 6-9 m, with the lowest recorded at > 9 m. The appropriate groundwater depth for herbs was about 1-4 m, whereas the depth for trees and shrubs was about 3-6 m. The groundwater depth < 6 m was deemed suitable for the growth of desert riparian forests. This results provide a scientific reference for the ecological restoration and protection for Tugai forests in arid areas."
https://openalex.org/W3024113838,"The idea that simple visual elements such as colors and lines have specific, universal associations—for example red being warm—appears rather intuitive. Such associations have formed a basis for the description of artworks since the 18th century and are still fundamental to discourses on art today. Art historians might describe a painting where red is dominant as “warm,” “aggressive,” or “lively,” with the tacit assumption that beholders would universally associate the works’ certain key forms with specific qualities, or “aesthetic effects”. However, is this actually the case? Do we actually share similar responses to the same line or color? In this paper, we tested whether and to what extent this assumption of universality (sharing of perceived qualities) is justified. We employed—for the first time—abstract artworks as well as single elements (lines and colors) extracted from these artworks in an experiment in which participants rated the stimuli on 14 “aesthetic effect” scales derived from art literature and empirical aesthetics. To test the validity of the assumption of universality, we examined on which of the dimensions there was agreement, and investigated the influence of art expertise, comparing art historians with lay people. In one study and its replication, we found significantly lower agreement than expected. For the whole artworks, participants agreed on the effects of warm-cold, heavy-light, and happy-sad, but not on 11 other dimensions. Further, we found that the image type (artwork or its constituting elements) was a major factor influencing agreement; people agreed more on the whole artwork than on single elements. Art expertise did not play a significant role and agreement was especially low on dimensions usually of interest in empirical aesthetics (e.g., like-dislike). Our results challenge the practice of interpreting artworks based on their aesthetic effects, as these effects may not be as universal as previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W3025614156,"Limb length, cursoriality and speed have long been areas of significant interest in theropod paleobiology, since locomotory capacity, especially running ability, is critical in the pursuit of prey and to avoid becoming prey. The impact of allometry on running ability, and the limiting effect of large body size, are aspects that are traditionally overlooked. Since several different non-avian theropod lineages have each independently evolved body sizes greater than any known terrestrial carnivorous mammal, ~1000kg or more, the effect that such large mass has on movement ability and energetics is an area with significant implications for Mesozoic paleoecology. Here, using expansive datasets that incorporate several different metrics to estimate body size, limb length and running speed, we calculate the effects of allometry on running ability. We test traditional metrics used to evaluate cursoriality in non-avian theropods such as distal limb length, relative hindlimb length, and compare the energetic cost savings of relative hindlimb elongation between members of the Tyrannosauridae and more basal megacarnivores such as Allosauroidea or Ceratosauridae. We find that once the limiting effects of body size increase is incorporated there is no significant correlation to top speed between any of the commonly used metrics, including the newly suggested distal limb index (Tibia + Metatarsus/ Femur length). The data also shows a significant split between large and small bodied theropods in terms of maximizing running potential suggesting two distinct strategies for promoting limb elongation based on the organisms' size. For small and medium sized theropods increased leg length seems to correlate with a desire to increase top speed while amongst larger taxa it corresponds more closely to energetic efficiency and reducing foraging costs. We also find, using 3D volumetric mass estimates, that the Tyrannosauridae show significant cost of transport savings compared to more basal clades, indicating reduced energy expenditures during foraging and likely reduced need for hunting forays. This suggests that amongst theropods, hindlimb evolution was not dictated by one particular strategy. Amongst smaller bodied taxa the competing pressures of being both a predator and a prey item dominant while larger ones, freed from predation pressure, seek to maximize foraging ability. We also discuss the implications both for interactions amongst specific clades and Mesozoic paleobiology and paleoecological reconstructions as a whole."
https://openalex.org/W3024185341,"The treatment of human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells through suppressing the abnormal survival signaling pathways has recently become a significant area of focus. In this study, our results demonstrated that decyl caffeic acid (DC), one of the novel caffeic acid derivatives, remarkedly suppressed the growth of CRC cells both in vitro and in vivo. The inhibitory effects of DC on CRC cells were investigated in an in vitro cell model and in vivo using a xenograft mouse model. CRC cells were treated with DC at various dosages (0, 10, 20 and 40 μM), and cell survival, the apoptotic index and the autophagy level were measured using an MTT assay and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. The signaling cascades in CRC were examined by Western blot assay. The anti-cancer effects of DC on tumor growth were examined by using CRC HCT-116 cells implanted in an animal model. Our results indicated that DC differentially suppressed the growth of CRC HT-29 and HCT-116 cells through an enhancement of cell-cycle arrest at the S phase. DC inhibited the expression of cell-cycle regulators, which include cyclin E and cyclin A proteins. The molecular mechanisms of action were correlated to the blockade of the STAT3 and Akt signaling cascades. Strikingly, a high dosage of DC prompted a self-protection action through inducing cell-dependent autophagy in HCT-116 cells. Suppression of autophagy induced cell death in the treatment of DC in HCT-116 cells. DC seemed to inhibit cell proliferation of CRC differentially, and the therapeutic advantage appeared to be autophagy dependent. Moreover, consumption of DC blocked the tumor growth of colorectal adenocarcinoma in an experimental animal model. In conclusion, our results suggested that DC could act as a therapeutic agent through the significant suppression of tumor growth of human CRC cells."

These NleDs disable specifically Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and p38s that are required for host immune response, whereas extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which is essential for host cell viability, remains intact.

The MAPK family comprises three main subfamilies, each including several isoforms. These subfamilies include the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1 and ERK2), the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3), and the p38 kinases (p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ). MAPKs are activated in response to a variety of stimuli. ERK1 and ERK2 are preferentially activated in response to growth factors and mitogenic stimuli (5Stofega M.R. Yu C.L. Wu J. Jove R. Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) by mitogenic stimuli is repressed in v-Src-transformed cells.Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8 (8993840): 113-119PubMed Google Scholar), whereas JNK and p38 kinases are more responsive to stress-associated stimuli. The latter include response to proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-1β, whose production is typically associated with bacterial infection (6Pearson G.

All MAPKs share a similar structure, consisting of the N and C lobes, with the active site and the activation loop in a crevice between them. The activation loop contains a TXY motif that includes two adjacent phosphor-acceptors, threonine and tyrosine residues, separated by a third variable residue. The X in the TXY motif is used as a hallmark for the specific MAPK, i.e. proline for JNKs, glutamate for ERKs, and glycine for p38s (7Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J.

Phosphorylation of both threonine and tyrosine residues is essential for the maximal activity of the MAPKs.

Among these pathogens is enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), which employs its type III secretion system (T3SS) (1Arbibe L. Kim D.W. Batsche E. Pedron T. Mateescu B. Muchardt C. Parsot C.

NleD is a Zn-dependent protease that rapidly inactivates JNK and p38 by cleaving them in their TXY motif between the X and Y residues (19Baruch K. Gur-Arie L. Nadler C. Koby S. Yerushalmi G. Ben-Neriah Y. Yogev O. Shaulian E. Guttman C. Zarivach R. Rosenshine I. Metalloprotease type III effectors that specifically cleave JNK and NF-kappaB.EMBO J. 2011; 30 (21113130): 221-23110.1038/emboj.2010.297Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Notably, in contrast to JNK and p38, ERK remains unaffected by NleD (19Baruch K. Gur-Arie L. Nadler C. Koby S. Yerushalmi G. Ben-Neriah Y. Yogev O. Shaulian E. Guttman C. Zarivach R. Rosenshine I. Metalloprotease type III effectors that specifically cleave JNK and NF-kappaB.EMBO J. 2011; 30 (21113130): 221-23110.1038/emboj.2010.297Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Thus, by employing NleD, EPEC inactivates p38 and JNK, which are required for the host immune response, without affecting the ERK-dependent host cell viability. Here, we show that NleD belongs to a large family of proteins harbored by various bacterial species, including human and plant pathogens and insect symbionts, all of which discriminate between JNK/p38 and ERK. We revealed that NleD distinguishes between the different MAPKs, disabling only p38s and JNKs by a mechanism involving entropy-driven selectivity. Accordingly, it targets only flexible activation loops containing the TXY motif. Our results provide the first example of a proteolytic enzyme bearing entropy-driven selectivity toward its native substrate. We estimate, however, that a similar mechanism is a widespread strategy for enhancing substrate selectivity. We have previously shown that NleD of EPEC (NleDEPEC) cleaves the activation loops of JNK2 and p38α at the TXY motif (TPY and TGY, respectively) between Pro/Gly and Tyr (19Baruch K. Gur-Arie L. Nadler C. Koby S. Yerushalmi G. Ben-Neriah Y. Yogev O. Shaulian E. Guttman C. Zarivach R. Rosenshine I. Metalloprotease type III effectors that specifically cleave JNK and NF-kappaB.EMBO J. 2011; 30 (21113130): 221-23110.1038/emboj.2010.297Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). On the other hand, NleD does not proteolyze ERK2 (19Baruch K. Gur-Arie L. Nadler C. Koby S. Yerushalmi G. Ben-Neriah Y. Yogev O. Shaulian E. Guttman C. Zarivach R. Rosenshine I. Metalloprotease type III effectors that specifically cleave JNK and NF-kappaB.EMBO J. 2011; 30 (21113130): 221-23110.1038/emboj.2010.297Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To further examine NleD specificity, we assayed its activity toward the different isoforms of ERK, JNK, and p38 (i.e. JNK1, JNK2, p38α, p38β, p38γ, p38δ, ERK1, and ERK2) (20Cargnello M. Roux P.P. Activation and function of the MAPKs and their substrates, the MAPK-activated protein kinases.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2011; 75 (21372320): 50-8310.1128/MMBR.00031-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we expressed an epitope-tagged form of each of the above MAPK isoforms in HEK293T cells and then infected them with WT EPEC or an nleD-deficient mutant. Western blot analysis of proteins extracted from the infected cells shows that NleDEPEC cleaved all JNKs and p38s but none of the ERKs (Fig. 1, A–C). To further verify these findings, we assayed the in vitro activity and specificity of purified NleDEPEC against purified MAPK substrates. Similarly, we found that JNK2 and p38α, but not ERK2, were cleaved by NleD (Fig. 1D), strengthening the premise that NleDEPEC is incapable of cleaving ERKs. A database search using BLAST (21Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25 (9254694): 3389-340210.1093/nar/25.17.3389Crossref PubMed Scopus (56847) Google Scholar) identified numerous NleD orthologues from different species that exhibit high sequence identity. These NleD proteins were aligned and analyzed for their phylogenetic relationships (22Sievers F. Wilm A. Dineen D. Gibson T.J. Karplus K. Li W. Lopez R. McWilliam H. Remmert M. Soding J. Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Fast, scalable generation of high-quality protein multiple sequence alignments using Clustal Omega.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2011; 7 (21988835): 53910.1038/msb.2011.75Crossref PubMed Scopus (7449) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1 and Fig. 2A). We then selected four NleDs for further analysis, including those of Salmonella enterica serovar Arizonae (NleDSEA), the insect symbiont Hamiltonella defensa (NleDHD), and the two NleD copies of Citrobacter rodentium (NleDCR1 and NleDCR2). These NleD orthologues were cloned in an expression vector, and their proteolytic activity of cleaving selected MAP kinases (JNK2, p38β, and ERK1) was assayed using coexpression in E. coli BL21. We found that similarly to NleDEPEC, all the assayed orthologues cleaved JNK2 and p38β, but none of them cleaved ERK1 (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the inability to cleave ERK proteins is conserved throughout the NleD family. The question that arises is how NleD distinguishes ERK from the highly similar p38 and JNK. The MAPKs differ at the X residue of their TXY motif. In ERK, X is the negatively charged Glu, whereas in p38 and JNK, X is the neutral Gly or Pro residue, respectively (Fig. S2). To examine if the X residue plays a role in NleD selectivity, we generated a JNK2 mutant whose TPY motif was converted to TEY (P184E), as in ERK. The results showed that upon coexpression with NleD, the JNK2 P184E mutant was cleaved with efficiency similar to that of the WT JNK2 (Fig. 3A), indicating that the Glu in the ERK TEY motif is not the factor that impairs the NleD ability to cleave ERK. These results also suggest that the recognition of JNK2 by NleD is mediated by other determinants, possibly related to the activation loop. Since the size and composition of the activation loops of the MAP kinases differ (Fig. S2), we also examined their role in imposing the inhibitory effect of ERK on NleD. To this end, we swapped the complete activation loops between the MAPKs and assayed NleD activity. We generated three variants, including ERK2, replacing the activation loops with that of JNK2 (ERKA-JNK) or that of p38α (ERKA-p38). Similarly, we constructed a p38α containing the activation loop of ERK2 (p38A-ERK) (Fig. 3B). We next tested the capability of NleD to cleave the purified MPAK variants (i.e. ERKA-JNK, ERKA-p38, and p38A-ERK). NleD cleaved all swapped variants, including p38A-ERK, containing the ERK activation loop in the context of p38 (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that the size and composition of the activation loops per se are not the prevailing factors that restrict ERK cleavage by NleD. Since the ERK activation loop resists cleavage by NleD only within its native context, we assumed that other regions of ERK play a role in restricting NleD activity. We further predicted that these ERK regions differ from the corresponding JNK and p38 regions, which might even promote p38 and JNK cleavage. The first candidate region that we assayed was the common docking motif (CD), localized at the N-lobe distal from the active site (Fig. S2) (23Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E.

The CD is the primary recognition site of MAPKs for interactions with upstream activators, substrates, and phosphatases. To test whether the CD is required for targeting MAPKs by NleD, we mutated the CD of JNK2 and p38α and examined NleD activity. To this end, we constructed a mutant in the p38 CD (D316N) (27Hutter D.

The results show that all assayed JNK2 and p38α variants were efficiently cleaved by NleDEPEC (Fig. 4A), emphasizing that the CD region does not play a role in NleD specificity. We then conducted a structure-based analysis to identify ERK sequences positioned in spatial proximity to the activation loop cleavage site and identified four such regions. These included short segments of the G-helix (G), the MAP kinase insert MKI (M), and the L16 (L) and αEF/αF (F) loops (Fig. 4B, Fig. S2). We subsequently generated several ERK2 replacement variants, or combinations of them, producing altogether nine variants, described in detail in the supporting information (Table S2). We next expressed and purified each of the variants and assayed for their proteolysis by NleD. The results clearly showed that none of these variants were cleaved by NleD (Fig. 4, C–E), indicating that the four regions neighboring the ERK activation loop (L16, LαEF/αF, G-helix, and MKI) are not accountable for NleD selectivity. Analysis of the PDB database revealed that the activation loops of p38 and JNK are mostly unstructured (flexible), whereas those of ERK exhibit generally a defined structure (11Diskin R.

To this end, we determined the crystal structure of ERKA-p38 and p38A-ERK (Table 1, Fig. 5), both shown to be cleavable NleD substrates (Fig. 3C). We also solved the structure of the ERK variant containing the G helix of p38 (ERKG-p38), which was shown to be resistant to NleD proteolysis (Fig. 4E). In the latter variant, the ERK2 G-helix residues 229KHY231 were replaced by the respective 226TDH228 residues from p38α. Structural analysis showed that the three chimeric MAPKs consist of the canonical two-lobe topology, highly similar to the WT MAPKs (Fig. 5A). The structure of p38A-ERK showed that the activation loop originating from ERK did not have indicative electron density, exhibiting high flexibility (Fig. 5B). Similarly, the structure of ERKA-p38 showed that its activation loop, derived from p38, also exhibits high flexibility, similar to that of the p38A-ERK loop (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the loop of ERKG-p38 showed a defined and rigid conformation (Fig. 5). Taken together, our results showed that ERKA-p38 and p38A-ERK, which exhibit a disordered (flexible) activation loop, were cleaved by NleD, whereas ERKG-p38, which has a loop with defined conformation, remained intact (Fig. 3C, Fig. 5, and Table 2). The observed conformation and the rigidity of the activation loop in ERK2 and ERKG-p38 is not a result of crystal packing, as the majority of its interactions are intramolecular. The introduction of the loop of p38α into ERK2 (ERKA-p38) also results in the same crystal packing, yet the loop displays flexibility. Thus, we postulated that local conformational flexibility of the activation loop is a primary factor promoting JNK/p38 cleavage by NleD and that the rigidity of the ERK loop hinders its cleavage.Table 1Data collection and refinement statisticsParameterp38A-ERKERKA-p38ERΚG-p38PDB entry6QYX6RFO6RFPESRF beamlineID23-2ID23-1ID23-1Wavelength (Å)0.8730.9720.972Space groupP212121P21P21Unit cell parameters (Å)a = 68.86, b = 74.50, c = 75.28a = 48.00, b = 68.69, c = 60.23, β = 109.13°a = 48.74, b = 68.81, c = 60.81, β = 110.14°Resolution range (Å) (outer shell)52.95–1.66 (1.72–1.66)45.35–1.70 (1.73–1.70)45.76–1.742 (1.79–1.74)No. of unique reflections46,102 (4,589)40,460 (2,160)38,438 (2,840)Redundancy4.24.03.7Rsym(I)aRsym(I)=Σ|I − |/ΣI.0.068 (0.862)0.062 (0.716)0.047 (0.661)Completeness99.1 (99.06)99.4 (98.8)99.4 (99.8)I/σ9.8 (1.0)10.0 (1.0)16.10 (1.92)CC (1/2)99.8 (39.6)99.8 (48.9)99.9 (77.8)No. of protein atoms2,7312,5902,762No. of ligand atoms20, 15No. of solvent atoms204173227R factor18.515.614.6RfreebTest set consists of 5% for all data.24.221.919.7Average B factorProtein38.238.737.2Ligands (βOG, HEPES)39.6, 46,6Solvent44.244.246.8RMSD from idealityBond length0.0170.0130.016Bond angle1.801.891.97Ramachandran plot (Rampage) (%)Favored96.496.497.8Generously allowed3.63.02.2Disallowed0.00.70.0a Rsym(I)=Σ|I − |/ΣI.b Test set consists of 5% for all data.

To test this assumption, we cloned the ERK1 activation loop (residues C183 to W209) and the JNK2 loop (residues D169 to R192) between two nonrelated proteins, GST and GFP, that should not impose constraints on the loop conformation (Fig. 6). We then probed for cleavability by NleD and found that in this artificial context, NleD readily cleaved both the ERK1 and JNK2 activation loops (Fig. 6). These results strengthen the premise that the conformational flexibility of the ERK activation loop is sufficient for efficient cleavage by NleD. The demonstration that the ERK1 and JNK2 activation loops are cleaved by NleD provided an approach to define further the sequence within the loop that is recognized by NleD. To address this issue, we constructed a set of plasmids expressing successively shorter segments of the JNK2 loop, all flanked by GST and GFP (Fig. 6C). The coexpression of these hybrid proteins and NleD in E. coli, followed by cleavage analysis, identified two short overlapping sequences, MTPYVVT and FMMTPYV, that were sufficient to promote proteolysis by NleD (Fig. 6D). Notably, a replacement of this sequence with seven sequential alanine residues abrogated the cleavage of the hybrid protein by NleD (Fig. 6D). Taken together, these results suggest that NleD recognizes and cleaves specific sequences that overlap the TXY motif and are located within flexible MAPK activation loops. A remarkable common feature of the NleD family of proteins is their ability to specifically target JNK and p38 MAPKs while leaving ERK intact. We examined the reason for ERK remaining entirely resistant to cleavage by NleD, even upon prolonged incubation at high concentrations of NleD. In contrast, the closely related JNK and p38 are specifically and rapidly cleaved. Our data, based on biochemical and structural analyses, suggest that NleD targets flexible MAPK activation loops. We show here that the activation loop of ERK exhibits a defined structure that restricts the accessibility of NleD to the TEY motif, leading to resistance to NleD. Most of the ERK2 structures deposited in the PDB (more than 80%) exhibit a defined conformation of the activation loop. In contrast, the loops of p38 and JNK alternate between several defined structures; some of them are selected to be cleaved by NleD. In agreement with our data, the examination of deposited (PDB) p38 and JNK structures showed that these MAPKs regularly display high loop flexibility (11Diskin R. Lebendiker M. Engelberg D. Livnah O.

Additionally, solution NMR studies of p38α further indicate that the activation loop exhibit flexibility in the nonphosphorylated form (29Kumar G.S. Clarkson M.W. Kunze M.B.A. Granata D. Wand A.J. Lindorff-Larsen K. Page R. Peti W. Dynamic activation and regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Interestingly, we obtained preliminary results indicating that NelD cannot proteolyze the dually phosphory-lated forms of p38 and JNK. These findings further support our hypothesis, since conserved interactions of the phosphorylated Thr and Tyr impose activation loop rigidity, as observed in the available phospho-p38 X-ray structure (9Zhang Y.Y. Wu J.W. Wang Z.X. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase 3-mediated cross-talk between MAPKs ERK2 and p38alpha.J. Biol.

Thus, our data show that NleD evolved to take advantage of the differences in the activation loop flexibility–rigidity interplay to specifically target JNK and p38 and evade the cleavage of ERK. Further analysis revealed that NleD recognizes the short overlapping sequence MTPYVVT or FMMTPYV within the loop, which is highly similar in all MAPKs. As a result, NleD recog"

The intervention costs for WGL, RSL and MSL and the implementation costs for RSL and MSL were evaluated using activity-based costing in eight Dutch hospitals. Based on available list prices the price of the magnetic seed was ranged €100-€500.The intervention costs for WGL, RSL and MSL were respectively: €2,617, €2,834 and €2,662 per patient and implementation costs were €2,974 and €26,826 for MSL and RSL respectively. For standard of care the budget impact increased from €14.7m to €16.9m. Inclusion of MSL with a seed price of €100 showed a budget impact of €16.7m. Above a price of €178 the budget impact increased for adoption of MSL, rising to €17.6m when priced at €500.MSL could be a cost-efficient localization technique in resecting non-palpable tumors in the Netherlands. The online calculation model can inform adoption decisions internationally. When determining retail price of the magnetic seed, cost-effectiveness should be considered."

We group the selected papers by decade of publication to provide insights and explore the corpus from four perspectives: (i) the positioning of prominent concepts across the corpus as a whole; (ii) a comparison of the prominence of verification, validation, and Verification and Validation (V&V) as separate concepts; (iii) the positioning of the concepts specifically associated with verification; and (iv) an evaluation of verification’s defining characteristics within each decade. Our analysis reveals unique characterizations of verification in each decade. The insights gathered helped to identify and discuss three categories of verification challenges as avenues of future research, awareness, and understanding for researchers, students, and practitioners. These categories include conveying confidence and maintaining ease of use; techniques’ coverage abilities for handling increasing simulation complexities; and new ways to provide error feedback to model users."

The underlying mechanism behind the accelerated atherosclerosis formation is not fully understood but may be related to the formation of oxidation products and advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). We aimed to examine the associations between the collagen oxidation product methionine sulfoxide; the collagen AGEs methylglyoxal hydroimidazolone (MG-H1), glucosepane, pentosidine, glucuronidine/LW-1; and serum receptors for AGE (RAGE) with measures of coronary artery disease in patients with long-term type 1 diabetes.In this cross-sectional study, 99 participants with type 1 diabetes of ≥ 45-year duration and 63 controls without diabetes had either established coronary heart disease (CHD) or underwent Computed Tomography Coronary Angiography (CTCA) measuring total, calcified and soft/mixed plaque volume. Skin collagen methionine sulfoxide and AGEs were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and serum sRAGE/esRAGE by ELISA.In the diabetes group, low levels of methionine sulfoxide (adjusted for age, sex and mean HbA1c) were associated with normal coronary arteries, OR 0.48 (95% CI 0.27-0.88).

The participants performed a classic three-dimensional mental rotation task developed by Shepard and Metzler (1971) [33] while event-related potentials were measured in both frontal and parietal regions of interest. While response time was similar in the two groups, gifted subjects performed the test with greater accuracy. There was no indication of interhemispheric asymmetry of ERPs over parietal regions in both groups, although interhemispheric differences were observed in the frontal lobes. Moreover, intelligence quotient and working memory measures predicted variance in ERP’s amplitude in the right parietal and frontal hemispheres. We conclude that while gifted adolescents do not display a different pattern of electroencephalographic activity over the parietal cortex while performing the mental rotation task, their performance is correlated with the amplitude of ERPs in the frontal cortex during the execution of this task."

This study’s objective was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of femur-sparing profile of intrauterine growth restriction for the identification of ZIKV-associated congenital injuries on postnatal testing. A retrospective cohort study of pregnant women with possible or confirmed ZIKV infection between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017 were included. Subjects were excluded if no prenatal ultrasound was available. A femur-sparing profile of growth restriction determined using INTERGROWTH-21st sonographic standard for head circumference to femur length (HC: FL). Congenital injuries were determined postnatally by imaging, comprehensive eye exam and standard newborn hearing screen. A total of 111 pregnant women diagnosed with ZIKV infection underwent fetal ultrasound and 95 neonates had complete postnatal evaluation. Prenatal microcephaly was detected in 5% of fetuses (6/111). Postnatal testing detected ZIKV-associated congenital injuries in 25% of neonates (24/95). A HC: FL Z-score ≤ -1.3 had a 52% specificity (95% CI 41–63%), 82% negative predictive value (NPV, 95% CI 73–88%) for the detection of ZIKV-associated congenital injuries in the neonatal period. A more stringent threshold with a Z-score ≤ -2 was associated with a 90% specificity (95% CI 81–95%), 81% NPV (95% CI 77–85%). Excluding cases of fetal microcephaly, HC: FL (Z-score ≤ -2) demonstrated a similar specificity (89%, 95% CI 81–95%) with superior NPV (87%, 95% CI 84–90%).

However, the expression of multiple efflux pumps, reduced permeability of the outer membrane, the capacity to form biofilms, and the presence of persisters have rendered P. aeruginosa intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics (8Fajardo A.

In addition to the TPP biosynthetic pathway, bacteria are capable of salvaging thiamine from exogenous sources to generate TPP.

Because TPP is indispensable for bacterial survival and humans lack the TPP biosynthetic pathway, enzymes involved in bacterial TPP biosynthesis are potential targets in the development of new antibiotics. ThiL is of particular interest, considering its key role in thiamine metabolism. Nevertheless, few studies, involving a limited number of bacterial species, have been conducted on ThiL, and it has never been validated as a target for antibacterial agents (28Webb E. Downs D.

In this work, we constructed a clean thiL deletion mutant of P. aeruginosa and investigated the impact of thiL deficiency on bacterial survival and in vivo pathogenesis. We also biochemically characterized P. aeruginosa ThiL and identified small molecules that inhibit the enzyme by using an optimized luminescent kinase assay. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the role of P. aeruginosa ThiL in bacterial physiology and pathogenesis and the first to validate ThiL as a new target for drug development, providing comprehensive biochemical characterization of ThiL and identifying its inhibitors. To investigate the physiological role of ThiL in P. aeruginosa, we constructed an in-frame deletion mutant of the thiL gene in P. aeruginosa PAO1 by two-step allele exchange (37Lee K.M. Go J.

TPP was supplied via selection medium for the last step of mutant generation, to avoid the loss of bacterial viability due to impaired thiamine biosynthesis. Deletion of thiL in the bacterial genome was confirmed by amplification of the thiL flanking region (Fig. S1). Phenotypic analysis of the ΔthiL mutant confirmed that deletion of thiL is lethal to P. aeruginosa unless TPP is exogenously provided in the medium (Fig. 1). Complementation with the plasmid expressing thiL (pthiL) relieved the growth defect of the ΔthiL mutant caused by TPP depletion, suggesting that ThiL is essential for TPP biosynthesis i0n P. aeruginosa (see Fig. 2A).sssFigure 2Phenotypic analysis of ΔthiL and thiL complementation by the pBSPII SK(−)-thiL plasmid in the thiL deletion mutant (pthiL) with thiamine or TMP supplementation. The ΔthiL strain did not grow on LB medium (A) or LB medium supplemented with thiamine (50 μm) (B) or TMP (50 μm) (C) in a 24-h incubation at 37 °C; pthiL showed normal growth in LB medium (A) and LB medium supplemented with thiamine (B) or TMP (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The thiamine salvage pathway is another way to generate TPP in many organisms, including bacteria and even mammals, which cannot synthesize TPP de novo. Two types of direct thiamine salvage pathways have been identified in bacteria, namely, one-step pyrophosphorylation of thiamine to TPP by thiamine pyrophosphokinase (TPK/ThiN) and two steps of subsequent monophosphorylation of thiamine to TMP and then TPP by ThiK and ThiL, respectively. As the thiamine salvage pathway in P. aeruginosa has yet to be characterized and no thiamine transporter genes have been identified in this species (26Rodionov D.A. Vitreschak A.G. Mironov A.A. Gelfand M.S. Comparative genomics of thiamin biosynthesis in procaryotes: new genes and regulatory mechanisms.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 (12376536): 48949-4895910.1074/jbc.M208965200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), we first tested whether the bacteria are capable of producing TPP using extracellular thiamine. We found that the thiE mutant in which de novo TPP synthesis is impaired was able to grow in the presence of extracellular thiamine, TMP, and TPP, indicating that P. aeruginosa can take up thiamine derivatives and has a thiamine salvage pathway (Fig. 3). Unlike the thiE mutant, the ΔthiL strain exhibited a growth defect even with exogenously provided thiamine and TMP (Fig. 2). This result suggests that ThiL is involved in not only de novo TPP synthesis but also the thiamine salvage pathway in P. aeruginosa, indicating that ThiL plays a critical role in P. aeruginosa thiamine metabolism. Next, we sought to determine the role of ThiL in the virulence of P. aeruginosa in vivo. C57BL/6 mice were infected intranasally with 2 × 107 CFU of the PAO1, ΔthiL, or thiL-complemented strains. During the first 20 h, all infected mice exhibited decreased movement, compared with uninfected mice. Histopathological analysis of the lung tissues at 20 h postinfection also suggested that, unlike uninfected control mice, all infected mice showed a distinct inflammatory response composed mainly of peribronchial and alveolar neutrophilic infiltrates, with neutrophilic consolidation and smooth muscle hyperplasia in the arterioles of the lung tissues (Fig. 4). Although mice infected with the ΔthiL strain exhibited a slightly lower degree of lung neutrophil infiltration (8.2 ± 6.3%) than mice infected with the PAO1 strain (11 ± 4%), the difference was not significant, suggesting that the ΔthiL mutant is capable of recruiting host immune cells and causing lung inflammation similar to the PAO1 strain (Fig. S2). Interestingly, when the average bacterial load in the left lobe of the lungs was measured at 20 h postinfection (n = 5 for each group), over 1,000 times more bacteria were found in mice infected with the PAO1 strain (1.6 × 108 CFU) and thiL-complemented strain (1.6 × 108 CFU), compared with mice infected with the ΔthiL strain (6.7 × 104 CFU) (Fig. 5A). In addition, the survival rates of the infected mice clearly demonstrated the attenuated virulence of the ΔthiL strain, compared with the PAO1 and thiL-complemented strains. Over 50% of mice infected with the PAO1 and thiL-complemented strains died by 24 h postinfection, and the rest of the infected mice were dead by 48 h postinfection (Fig. 5B). In contrast, uninfected control mice and mice infected with the ΔthiL mutant survived as long as 72 h postinfection (Fig. 5B).Figure 5Bacterial loads in mouse lungs infected with PAO1, ΔthiL, or pthiL and survival analysis of the infection groups. A, CFU analysis showed relatively low bacterial loads in the lungs of mice infected with ΔthiL (6.7 × 104 CFU), compared with PAO1 (1.6 × 108 CFU) or pthiL (1.6 × 108 CFU), after 20 h of infection. *, p < 0.05. B, a survival rate of 100% was observed in the mice infected with ΔthiL for 72 h after infection. The survival rates were reduced to below 50% in the mice infected with PAO1 or pthiL strains by 24 h after infection. The arrow indicates the time of infection (n = 5 for each experimental group, repeated three times).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because there was a discrepancy between the results of the lung histology and survival analyses, we further investigated pathogenesis in the infected mice by measuring the host immune response in the blood. Levels of three proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), were measured in the blood of infected mice at 20 h postinfection. The level of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) was measured as a murine counterpart of IL-8. Levels of all three tested cytokines were significantly higher in PAO1-infected mice than in ΔthiL-infected mice (Fig. 6, A, B, and C). Similarly, the splenic bacterial count in mice infected with the PAO1 strain (6 × 105 CFU/organ) was 4 orders of magnitude higher than that in ΔthiL-infected mice (2 × 101 CFU/organ) (Fig. 6D). Taken together, these results suggest that overall virulence is attenuated in the ΔthiL strain due to decreased severity of bacteremia and sepsis, ultimately leading to survival of the mice, demonstrating that ThiL is essential for the full virulence of P. aeruginosa. Despite its importance in bacterial physiology and virulence, to our knowledge P. aeruginosa ThiL (PaThiL) has never been studied before, at either the molecular or biochemical level. For biochemical characterization of the enzyme, the P. aeruginosa thiL gene (PA4051) was PCR amplified and cloned into pET28b. The recombinant PaThiL was purified as an ∼37-kDa His-tagged protein using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity matrix, with >95% purity (Fig. S3). We found that purified PaThiL was highly unstable without desalting, exhibiting 80% and 56% activity loss within 24 h at 4 °C and −210 °C, respectively (Fig. S4). A further gradual decrease in activity was observed over time. Therefore, purified PaThiL was frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen (−210 °C) after immediate desalting, and activity was retained for over 1 month without significant loss (Fig. S4). Previous studies of ThiL used a HPLC-based assay or a coupled assay using apo-carboxylase to assess ThiL activity (28Webb E. Downs D. Characterization of thiL, encoding thiamin-monophosphate kinase, in Salmonella typhimurium.J. Biol.

Because both types of assays are quite inconvenient and inefficient, we adapted a luminescent kinase assay that detects ATP consumption and optimized it to determine PaThiL enzymatic kinetics (see Experimental Procedures). The final assay was established to analyze the activity of 10 µg of PaThiL in a reaction buffer containing 0.05 mm TMP, 0.05 mm ATP, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, and 350 mm KCl. The Km values for TMP and ATP, as well as the Vmax value, were calculated based on Michaelis-Menten and Lineweaver-Burk plots of PaThiL activity in reactions containing several different concentrations of ATP and TMP. The Vmax value of PaThiL was 4.0 ± 0.2 nmol·min−1. The Km values for ATP and TMP were 111 ± 8 μm and 8.0 ± 3.5 μm, respectively, with a random bi-bi mechanism (Fig. 7). Similar ranges of Km values were previously reported for partially purified E. coli ThiL (270 and 1.1 μm for ATP and TMP, respectively) (36Nishino H. Biogenesis of cocarboxylase in Escherichia coli: partial purification and some properties of thiamine monophosphate kinase.J. Biochem. 1972; 72 (4567662): 1093-110010.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a129996Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Further characterization of PaThiL revealed that the enzyme phosphorylates oxythiamine monophosphate (a TMP analogue) with a Km value of 15.2 ± 2.0 μm (Fig. S5). Thiamine, as well as other thiamine analogues, including oxythiamine, pyrithiamine, and amprolium, were not phosphorylated by PaThiL, indicating that prior acquisition of monophosphate is a requirement for PaThiL substrates (Fig. S6). TPP was not further phosphorylated by ThiL, suggesting that PaThiL does not contribute to the generation of intracellular thiamine triphosphate. Gram-negative bacteria such as P. aeruginosa are notorious for their multidrug and pan-drug resistance, which has created an urgent need for new classes of antibiotics. Our in vivo virulence study of the ΔthiL mutant indicated that ThiL is a promising novel candidate for an antibacterial molecule, as humans have no PaThiL homologue. In order to validate the druggability of PaThiL, ∼2,800 commercially available compounds were screened for inhibitory activity against PaThiL. The screening was conducted using a slight modification of our established in vitro PaThiL assay. The screening assay was initiated upon addition of 5 µg of purified PaThiL to a reaction mixture containing 10 μm TMP and 100 μm test compound; ThiL activity was measured by monitoring ATP consumption during a 10-min reaction. WAY213613 (Tocriscreen) and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (Lopac) were among several compounds that inhibited PaThiL. Further biochemical studies revealed that WAY213613 was a noncompetitive inhibitor of TMP for PaThiL, with a Ki value of 13.4 ± 2.3 μm, whereas 5-hydroxyindol"
https://openalex.org/W3025220308,"We previously reported efficient heavy-chain assembly of heterodimeric bispecific antibodies by exchanging the interdomain protein interface of the human IgG1 CH3 dimer with the protein interface of the constant α and β domains of the human T-cell receptor, a technology known as bispecific engagement by antibodies based on the T-cell receptor (BEAT). Efficient heterodimerization in mammalian cell transient transfections was observed, but levels were influenced by the nature of the binding arms, particularly in the Fab-scFv-Fc format. In this study, we report a single amino acid change that significantly and consistently improved the heterodimerization rate of this format (≥95%) by inducing partial disorder in one homodimer species without affecting the heterodimer. Correct folding and assembly of the heterodimer were confirmed by the high-resolution (1.88–1.98 Å) crystal structure presented here. Thermal stability and 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid–binding experiments, comparing original BEAT, mutated BEAT, and “knobs-into-holes” interfaces, suggested a cooperative assembly process of heavy chains in heterodimers. The observed gain in stability of the interfaces could be classified in the following rank order: mutated BEAT > original BEAT > knobs-into-holes. We therefore propose that the superior cooperativity found in BEAT interfaces is the key driver of their greater performance. Furthermore, we show how the mutated BEAT interface can be exploited for the routine preparation of drug candidates, with minimal risk of homodimer contamination using a single Protein A chromatography step. We previously reported efficient heavy-chain assembly of heterodimeric bispecific antibodies by exchanging the interdomain protein interface of the human IgG1 CH3 dimer with the protein interface of the constant α and β domains of the human T-cell receptor, a technology known as bispecific engagement by antibodies based on the T-cell receptor (BEAT). Efficient heterodimerization in mammalian cell transient transfections was observed, but levels were influenced by the nature of the binding arms, particularly in the Fab-scFv-Fc format. In this study, we report a single amino acid change that significantly and consistently improved the heterodimerization rate of this format (≥95%) by inducing partial disorder in one homodimer species without affecting the heterodimer. Correct folding and assembly of the heterodimer were confirmed by the high-resolution (1.88–1.98 Å) crystal structure presented here. Thermal stability and 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid–binding experiments, comparing original BEAT, mutated BEAT, and “knobs-into-holes” interfaces, suggested a cooperative assembly process of heavy chains in heterodimers. The observed gain in stability of the interfaces could be classified in the following rank order: mutated BEAT > original BEAT > knobs-into-holes. We therefore propose that the superior cooperativity found in BEAT interfaces is the key driver of their greater performance. Furthermore, we show how the mutated BEAT interface can be exploited for the routine preparation of drug candidates, with minimal risk of homodimer contamination using a single Protein A chromatography step. Among the myriad of reported bispecific antibody (bsAb) technologies, the heavy chain (Hc) heterodimer format is found in the majority of drug candidates. Favorable physical characteristics, long serum half-life, facile purification, and tunable effector functions are some of the strongpoints of having an Fc-based bsAb format (1Brinkmann U. Kontermann R.E. The making of bispecific antibodies.mAbs. 2017; 9 (28071970): 182-21210.1080/19420862.2016.1268307Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 2Strohl W.R.

Inherent to Hc heterodimeric bsAbs are the unwanted homodimeric species resulting from the transfection of two different Hcs. Most heterodimerization (HD) technologies incorporate a modified CH3–CH3 interface (Fig. 1) that drives the equilibrium toward the formation of the desired heterodimer. Examples include the knobs-into-holes (KiH) technology (3Atwell S. Ridgway J.B. Wells J.A. Carter P. Stable heterodimers from remodeling the domain interface of a homodimer using a phage display library.J. Mol.

In addition to driving HD by means of CH3 engineering, heterodimer formation can be influenced at the transfection level: varying the DNA ratios can lead to an equilibrated expression of the two Hcs and thus may increase HD. In our experience, however, adjusting chain ratios is time-consuming and has a limited impact. More preferred is the use of equivalent antibody chain ratios combined with a strong Hc HD technology. Alternatively, different antibody halves may be expressed individually and assembled postproduction (6Spiess C. Merchant M. Huang A. Zheng Z. Yang N.Y. Peng J. Ellerman D. Shatz W. Reilly D. Yansura D.G. Scheer J.M. Bispecific antibodies with natural architecture produced by co-culture of bacteria expressing two distinct half-antibodies.Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31 (23831709): 753-75810.1038/nbt.2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Another challenge related to heterodimeric bsAbs is light chain (Lc) mispairing caused by the random pairing of Lcs with Hcs upon co-transfection. This may be circumvented by using a common Lc or, as a more straightforward solution, by the use of single-chain variable fragment (scFv) fusion: variable heavy chain (VH) and variable light chain (VL) domains are genetically fused in one of the Hcs, resulting in the Fab–scFv–Fc format (Fig. 1). Drawbacks of the scFv format include its unpredictable biophysical nature. We found that depending on the characteristics of the scFv, the HD level can be impacted. First, the cause of this may lie in the absence of the CH1 domain that represents an important quality-control checkpoint in the antibody secretion pathway. Lack of regulation may favor scFv-based homodimer formation over heterodimers (7Bole D.G. Hendershot L.M. Kearney J.F. Posttranslational association of immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein with nascent heavy chains in nonsecreting and secreting hybridomas.J.

Second, we found that the general expression level of the variable domains also impacts HD when incorporating an scFv in a bsAb. Conceivably, the more efficient the HD interface is, the more it can counteract the aforementioned factors and ensure high HD levels, regardless of the format of the binding arms. We previously reported very efficient HD driven by the BEAT interface, which resulted from grafting the natural human T-cell receptor (TCR) constant domain α–constant domain β heterodimeric interface onto the IgG1 CH3 homodimer domain pair (10Skegro D. Stutz C. Ollier R. Svensson E. Wassmann P. Bourquin F. Monney T. Gn S. Blein S. Immunoglobulin domain interface exchange as a platform technology for the generation of Fc heterodimers and bispecific antibodies.J. Biol.

We monitored heterodimer formation in Fc fragments and introduced for this purpose a VL domain antibody (VL-dAb) at the N terminus of one Fc chain to create a difference in molecular mass between homo- and heterodimer species (VL–dAb–Fc format; Fig. 1, inset). In this experimental setup, HD rates were consistently above 90–94% in transient HEK transfections. When switching to the Fab–scFv–Fc bsAb format, HD levels were lower and generally at ∼75% in transient transfections. As described above, HD levels depended on the physical attributes of the variable domains used. Thus, we set out to achieve increased HD levels, regardless of the characteristics of the variable domains, by further engineering the BEAT interface. We anticipated that increased HD could be attained either directly by further stabilizing the heterodimeric interface or indirectly by destabilizing the interface in the unwanted homodimeric species. Using a structure-guided approach and molecular modeling, we identified mutation D84.4Q in the BEAT CH3 (B) domain (according to IMGT numbering or D401Q according to Eu numbering) (11Lefranc M.P.

With this optimized HD interface, the variable domains used were found to have little impact on HD levels, consistently reaching ≥95%. Here we report the structural and biophysical characterization of homo- and heterodimers encompassing the D84.4Q substitution versus nonmutated controls. We found that D84.4Q induced partial disorder in the Fc of homodimers carrying the mutation, as well as the excessive formation of half-antibodies—two phenomena not observed in D84.4Q-containing heterodimers that were stable and undistinguishable from nonmutated heterodimers as seen in the crystal structure reported herein. We found that D84.4Q homodimers lack Protein A (PA) binding, and we show how this loss of function can be exploited to produce stable bsAbs via a single PA purification step with minimal risk of contaminating species, a key advantage when screening bsAbs for drug discovery. Finally, our results shed structural insights on bsAb Hc hetero- versus homodimer assembly, and the nature of half-antibodies on which only little data could be found prior to this work (13Zhang H.M. Li C. Lei M. Lundin V. Lee H.Y. Ninonuevo M. Lin K. Han G. Sandoval W. Lei D. Ren G. Zhang J. Liu H.

Bourquin F. Monney T. Gn S. Blein S. Immunoglobulin domain interface exchange as a platform technology for the generation of Fc heterodimers and bispecific antibodies.J. Biol.

The KiH technology can be considered the industry standard in terms of Hc heterodimerization but has been reported to suffer from variable heterodimer purity (14Jackman J. Chen Y. Huang A. Moffat B.

Our findings may also be of relevance to technologies where assembly of half-antibodies into bsAbs occurs postproduction. As a starting point for engineering, different Fab–scFv–Fc constructs based on the previously reported BEAT interface were assessed. Fab arms encompassed a VH domain fused to an IgG1 CH1 domain and hinge followed by IgG3 CH2 and CH3 domains having the BEAT (A) substitutions (S20K, T22V, K26T, K79Y, F85.1S, Y86V, K88W, and T90N, with IMGT numbering) and the Q3A mutation previously reported to increase HD in the VL–dAb–Fc format (10Skegro D. Stutz C. Ollier R. Svensson E. Wassmann P. Bourquin F. Monney T. Gn S. Blein S. Immunoglobulin domain interface exchange as a platform technology for the generation of Fc heterodimers and bispecific antibodies.J. Biol.

ScFv arms included a VH–VL domain fused to an IgG1 hinge via a Gly4-Thr linker followed by a CH2 and CH3 domain having the BEAT (B) substitutions (Q3E, Y5A, L7F, S20T, T22V, K26T, T81D, V84L, D84.2E, F85.1A, Y86S, K88R, and T90R). IgG3 domains, which naturally do not bind PA, were used in BEAT (A) chains to abrogate PA binding thereof (15Van Loghem E. Frangione B. Recht B. Franklin E.C. Staphylococcal Protein A and human IgG subclasses and allotypes.Scand. J. Immunol. 1982; 15 (7089488): 275-27810.1111/j.1365-3083.1982.tb00649.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Upon co-transfection, the Fab arm, Lc, and scFv arm assembled into bispecific molecules having Hcs of different avidity for PA, thereby allowing separation of homo- and heterodimer species. Importantly, variable domains were selected from different VH subclasses, because the VH3 subclass is known to bind PA (16Sasso E.H. Silverman G.J. Mannik M. Human IgA and IgG F(ab′)2 that bind to staphylococcal Protein A belong to the VHIII subgroup.J. Immunol. 1991; 147 (1909733): 1877-1883PubMed Google Scholar). The various bsAbs were carefully designed not to encompass VH3-type variable domains on the IgG3-based Hcs to avoid reducing or nullifying the difference in PA avidity between Hcs. Alternatively we used VH3-type domains carrying the G65S substitution (Kabat numbering), a single VH framework mutation that abrogates PA binding (17Ollier R. Wassmann P. Monney T. Ries Fecourt C. Gn S. C A.V. Ayoub D. Stutz C. Gudi G.S. Blein S. Single-step Protein A and Protein G avidity purification methods to support bispecific antibody discovery and development.mAbs. 2019; 11 (31462177): 1464-147810.1080/19420862.2019.1660564Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Plasmids carrying individual chains were transfected into HEK cells at a 1:1:1 molar ratio, and supernatants were purified by PA or Protein G (PG), with the latter allowing capture of all species. Homo- and heterodimer formation were assessed by non-reduced SDS-PAGE and quantified by scanning densitometry of the gel bands. Fig. 2A shows the distribution of homo- and heterodimeric species for two different bsAb combinations: anti–TAA-1 × anti-CD3ε (Fab arm: tumor-associated antigen 1 (TAA-1) of the VH2 subclass × scFv arm: anti-CD3ε scFv of the VH3 subclass) and anti-CD3ε × anti–TAA-2 (Fab arm: anti-CD3ε of the VH3 subclass abrogated for PA binding via the G65S substitution × scFv arm: anti–TAA-2 of the VH3 subclass). We found that although the percentages of BEAT (A) and BEAT (B) homodimers varied depending on the variable domains used, BEAT (B) homodimers were the most represented contaminant species, an observation that we made also for other variable domain combinations not shown here. Consequently, we speculated that reducing the propensity of BEAT (B) homodimer assembly would shift the equilibrium in favor of heterodimer formation. Based on the crystal structure of the original BEAT interface (BEAT Fc, PDB code 5M3V), we generated a computational model of the BEAT (B) homodimer by homology modeling. The interaction network of the resulting model was analyzed with the aim to identify positions that could destabilize the homodimer (Fig. 3, first panel from the left). We identified residues Asp84.4 and Arg90 in BEAT (B) as potential candidates for destabilization of the BEAT (B) homodimer. Asp84.4 of the first chain forms an electrostatic interaction with Arg90 of the second chain. The same is true for the reciprocal set of residues. We hypothesized that disrupting this symmetric set of electrostatic interactions could destabilize the BEAT (B) homodimer and thereby disfavor its formation. Accordingly, we mutated position Asp84.4 in BEAT (B). Analogously to the interface grafting procedure described previously (10Skegro D. Stutz C. Ollier R. Svensson E. Wassmann P. Bourquin F. Monney T. Gn S. Blein S. Immunoglobulin domain interface exchange as a platform technology for the generation of Fc heterodimers and bispecific antibodies.J. Biol.

The antibodies were produced as before, and homo- and heterodimeric species were assessed. Although the anti–TAA-1 × anti-CD3ε bsAb containing the original interface yielded a HD level of 76%, with BEAT (B) homodimers at 24% and no BEAT (A) homodimers (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2), the same antibody containing the D84.4Q mutation in BEAT (B) yielded a HD level of 95%, with 5% of BEAT (A) homodimers and no BEAT (B) homodimers (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). Similarly, the anti-CD3ε × anti–TAA-2 bsAb with the D84.4Q substitution in BEAT (B) showed an increase in HD from 77% (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4) to 95% with only 5% BEAT (B) homodimers formed and no detectable BEAT (A) homodimers observed (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). The significant increase in HD to levels ≥95% as a result of the D84.4Q mutation in BEAT (B) was also observed for the HER3 × HER2 bsAb previously described (10Skegro D. Stutz C. Ollier R. Svensson E. Wassmann P. Bourquin F. Monney T. Gn S. Blein S. Immunoglobulin domain interface exchange as a platform technology for the generation of Fc heterodimers and bispecific antibodies.J. Biol.

It is noteworthy at this point that an alternative approach to disrupt the symmetric ionic interactions between Asp84.4 and Arg90 was back-to-wild-type (WT) mutation R90T in BEAT (B). We previously reported that this led to a small increase in HD levels for the VL–dAb–Fc format (10Skegro D. Stutz C. Ollier R. Svensson E. Wassmann P. Bourquin F. Monney T. Gn S. Blein S. Immunoglobulin domain interface exchange as a platform technology for the generation of Fc heterodimers and bispecific antibodies.J. Biol.

This may be explained by the fact that although the symmetric ionic interactions with Asp84.4 in the BEAT (B) homodimer were disrupted by R90T, the asymmetric interactions made with Asp84.4 and Asp84.2 in the heterodimer were also disrupted and therefore may have canceled out any improvement in HD (Fig. 3, first and second panel from the left). To investigate the molecular basis of HD improvement resulting from the D84.4Q mutation, the X-ray structure of the new BEAT Fc was solved. Chain (A) contained an IgG1 hinge (starting at Asp221, with Eu numbering) and an IgG3 CH2 and CH3 domain with the BEAT (A) substitutions, as well as the Q3A mutation in CH3. We previously reported the Q3A mutation to be HD-enhancing but did not include it in the initial construct of which we solved the crystal structure (10Skegro D. Stutz C. Ollier R. Svensson E. Wassmann P. Bourquin F. Monney T. Gn S. Blein S. Immunoglobulin domain interface exchange as a platform technology for the generation of Fc heterodimers and bispecific antibodies.J. Biol.

Chain (B) was engineered with an IgG1 hinge, CH2 and CH3 domain with the BEAT (B) substitutions including D84.4Q. We named this construct BEAT Q3A-D84.4Q Fc. The transient expression level in HEK was good and similar to that of the original BEAT Fc. Thermal stability by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was reduced by 1 °C to 69 °C compared with BEAT Fc (Fig. 4A). By melting the same molecule in which the IgG3 CH2 domain of BEAT (A) was substituted with that of IgG1, we determined that it was the IgG3 CH2 domain that led to the 1 °C loss in thermal stability and not the D84.4Q substitution (Fig. 4B). BEAT Q3A-D84.4Q Fc was crystallized, and its 3D structure was solved at high resolution (Table 1). The same so-called “horseshoe” structure as that seen in any natural IgG antibody was observed (Fig. 5A), with little deviation from other experimentally solved structures including the previously reported BEAT Fc structure (root-mean-square deviation of 0.63 Å versus PDB code 2WAH and 0.30 Å versus PDB code 5M3V when superimposing the CH3 domains on their Cα traces). Analysis of the BEAT substitutions in the engineered CH3 domains revealed identical side-chain orientations for the majority of amino acids (∼87%) compared with the original BEAT Fc (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, however, the side chain of position Arg90 in BEAT (B) changed its conformation, leading to an additional ionic interaction compared with the original BEAT Fc, potentially contributing to the favorable HD levels (Fig. 3, third versus fourth panel from the left). Also, Lys20 in BEAT (A) forms an ionic interaction that was not observed in the original BEAT Fc. The conformation of the side chain of position Lys20 is slightly shifted compared with that in the original structure, which explains the modified interaction network. The difference in conformation, however, is likely an artifact resulting from the poorly defined electron density for the lysine side chain in both crystal structures. A direct link between the change in side-chain conformation of Arg90 and the D84.4Q or Q3A mutations could not be derived: the environment around the D84.4Q substitution showed no structural alterations, with side chains (BEAT substitutions and others) keeping the same conformation as in the structure lacking the mutation (Fig. 5C). Similarly, substitution Q3A did not induce any structural changes, and the side-chain conformations of positions in its immediate surroundings remained the same (Fig. 5D).Table 1Data collection and refinement statistics of the BEAT Q3A-D84.4Q Fc crystal structureBEAT Q3A-D84.4Q FcData collectionWavelength (Å)0.966Space groupP212121Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)49.7, 73.0, 140.9α, β, γ (°)90.0, 90.0, 90.0Resolution (Å)aThe values in parentheses are for highest-resolution shell.30.00–1.88 (1.98–1.88)Rmerge (%)0.080 (0.622)Rmeas (%)0.090 (0.707)Rpim (%)0.041 (0.332)I/σI8.5 (2.0)Completeness (%)99.5 (99.9)Redundancy4.3 (4.3)RefinementResolution (Å)30.00–1.88 (1.93–1.88)No. reflections40,305/2929Rwork/Rfree0.231/0.273No. atomsProtein3354Sugar220Water321B factorsProtein56.8Sugar83.5Water51.0Root-mean-square deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.007Bond angles (°)1.372a The values in parentheses are for highest-resolution shell. Open table in a new tab We succeeded at improving HD of Fab–scFv–Fc BEATs by introducing the D84.4Q substitution that, putatively, destabilized the BEAT (B) homodimer species. For analytical purposes, we produced the BEAT (A) and BEAT (B) D84.4Q homodimers corresponding to the anti–TAA-1 × anti-CD3ε bsAb described above. Upon purification, we found that although BEAT (A) homodimers could readily be purified by PG, BEAT (B) D84.4Q homodimers could only be isolated by PA and did not significantly bind PG (Fig. 6A). This suggested, for example, misfolding or conformational changes in the PG-binding site of the BEAT (B) D84.4Q Fc region. Considering that PG binds to almost the same part of the Fc as PA does, i.e. the CH2–CH3 interface (19Deisenhofer J. Crystallographic refinement and atomic models of a human Fc fragment and its complex with fragment B of Protein A from Staphylococcus aureus at 2.9- and 2.8-Å resolution.Biochemistry. 1981; 20 (7236608): 2361-237010.1021/bi00512a001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar, 20Sauer-Eriksson A.E.

We hypothesized that PA binding in the BEAT (B) D84.4Q homodimer was solely mediated by the PA-binding site located in the anti-CD3ε scFv moiety, which encompassed a variable domain of the VH3 subclass and consequently a PA-binding site (16Sasso E.H. Silverman G.J. Mannik M. Human IgA and IgG F(ab′)2 that bind to staphylococcal Protein A belong to the VHIII subgroup.J. Immunol. 1991; 147 (1909733): 1877-1883PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the contribution of the VH3 variable domain binding to PA, we produced a BEAT (B) D84.4Q homodimer where the anti-CD3ε scFv moiety was replaced by an anti–TAA-1 Fab, which was of the VH2 subfamily and thus did not bind PA. That particular Fab was chosen over an scFv for its good stability and good expression level; in addition the melting transition (Tm) of an scFv in DSC measurements would have overlapped with that of the Fc. We found that, as predicted, this BEAT (B) D84.4Q homodimer no longer bound PA (note that some half-antibodies appeared in the bound fraction, discussed below) (Fig. 6B, lane 1). PG binding on the other hand was restored (Fig. 6B, lane 2) because of the secondary PG-binding site located in the CH1 domain (21Derrick J.P. Wigley D.B. Crystal structure of a streptococcal Protein G domain bound to an Fab fragment.Nature. 1992; 359 (1436040): 752-75410.1038/359752a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Replacing the VH2-type anti–TAA-1 Fab with a VH3-type anti–TAA-1 Fab restored PA binding (Fig. 6B, lane 3). Removing the D84.4Q substitution in a homodimer with the VH2-type anti–TAA-1 Fab restored PA binding (Fig. 6B, lane 5). Taken together, the PA- and PG-binding sites in the Fc region of a BEAT (B) D84.4Q homodimer are both nonfunctional. The latter result suggested that the BEAT (B) D84.4Q homodimer Fc portion was misfolded or structurally altered in the PA- and PG-binding regions. However, characterization of numerous BEATs wherein the BEAT (B) CH3 domain contained the D84.4Q substitution revealed no inconsistencies in terms of the structural integrity of the heterodimeric assembly. The functionality of the PA site in the heterodimeric"

https://openalex.org/W3025916786,"This study presents the taxonomic description of two new sponge species that are intimately associated with the hyperarid mangrove ecosystem of Qatar. The study includes a preliminary evaluation of the sponges’ potential bioactivity against pathogens. Chalinula qatari sp. nov. is a fragile thinly encrusting sponge with a vivid maroon colour in life, often with oscular chimneys and commonly recorded on pneumatophores in the intertidal and shallow subtidal zone. Suberites luna sp. nov. is a massive globular-lobate sponge with a greenish-black colour externally and a yellowish orange colour internally, recorded on pneumatophores in the shallow subtidal zone, with large specimens near the seagrass ecosystem that surrounds the mangrove. For both species, a drug extraction protocol and an antibacterial experiment was performed. The extract of Suberites luna sp. nov. was found to be bioactive against recognized pathogens such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, but no bioactive activity was recorded for Chalinula qatari sp. nov. This study highlights the importance of increasing bioprospecting effort in hyperarid conditions and the importance of combining bioprospecting with taxonomic studies for the identification of novel marine drugs."
https://openalex.org/W3025962140,"Optimizing barley (hordeum vulgare L.) production in Idaho and other parts of the Pacific Northwest (PNW) should focus on farm resource management. The effect of post-harvest residue management on barley residue decomposition has not been adequately studied. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of residue placement (surface vs. incorporated), residue size (chopped vs. ground-sieved) and soil type (sand and sandy loam) on barley residue decomposition. A 50-day(d) laboratory incubation experiment was conducted at a temperature of 25°C at the Aberdeen Research and Extension Center, Aberdeen, Idaho, USA. Following the study, a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) modeling approach was applied to investigate the first-order decay kinetics of barley residue. An accelerated initial flush of residue carbon(C)-mineralization was measured for the sieved (Day 1) compared to chopped (Day 3 to 5) residues for both surface incorporated applications. The highest evolution of carbon dioxide (CO2)-C of 8.3 g kg-1 dry residue was observed on Day 1 from the incorporated-sieved application for both soils. The highest and lowest amount of cumulative CO2-C released and percentage residue decomposed over 50-d was observed for surface-chopped (107 g kg-1 dry residue and 27%, respectively) and incorporated-sieved (69 g kg-1 dry residue and 18%, respectively) residues, respectively. There were no significant differences in C-mineralization from barley residue based on soil type or its interactions with residue placement and size (p >0.05). The largest decay constant k of 0.0083 d-1 was calculated for surface-chopped residue where the predicted half-life was 80 d, which did not differ from surface sieved or incorporated chopped. In contrast, incorporated-sieved treatments only resulted in a k of 0.0054 d-1 and would need an additional 48 d to decompose 50% of the residue. Future residue decomposition studies under field conditions are warranted to verify the residue C-mineralization and its impact on residue management."
https://openalex.org/W3026000087,"The elucidation of mechanisms behind the thermostability of proteins is extremely important both from the theoretical and applied perspective. Here we report the crystal structure of methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD) from Thermus thermophilus HB8, a thermophilic model organism. Molecular dynamics trajectory analysis of this protein at different temperatures (303 K, 333 K and 363 K) was compared with homologous proteins from the less temperature resistant organism Thermoplasma acidophilum and the mesophilic organism Acinetobacter baumannii using several data reduction techniques like principal component analysis (PCA), residue interaction network (RIN) analysis and rotamer analysis. These methods enabled the determination of important residues for the thermostability of this enzyme. The description of rotamer distributions by Gini coefficients and Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence both revealed significant correlations with temperature. The emerging view seems to indicate that a static salt bridge/charged residue network plays a fundamental role in the temperature resistance of Thermus thermophilus MTHFD by enhancing both electrostatic interactions and entropic energy dispersion. Furthermore, this analysis uncovered a relationship between residue mutations and evolutionary pressure acting on thermophilic organisms and thus could be of use for the design of future thermostable enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W3025103797,"Although ICPD brought about an international consensus on the centrality of women’s empowerment and gender equity as desired national goals, the conceptualization and measurement of empowerment in demography and economics have been largely understood in a relational and in a family welfare context where women’s altruistic behaviour within the household is tied either to developmental or child health outcomes. The goals of this study were twofold: (1) to offer an empirical examination of the household level empowerment measure through the theoretical construct of self-compassion and investigate its association with antenatal health, and (2) to ensure robust psychometric quality for this new measure. Drawing data from the nationally representative, multi-topic dataset of 42, 152 households, India Human Development Survey, IHDS II (2011–2012), the study performed a confirmatory factor analysis followed by an OLS estimation to investigate the association between a self-compassionate based empowerment and antenatal care. Empowerment was shown to be positively and significantly associated with antenatal care with significant age and education gradient. A woman’s married status, her relation to the household head and joint family residence created conditions of restricted freedom in terms of her mobility, decision making and sociality. The empowerment measure showed inconsistent associations with social group affiliations and household wealth. The study provided an intellectual starting point to rethink the traditional formulations of empowerment by foregrounding its empirical measure within the relatively unexplored area of social psychology. In the process it addressed measurement gaps in the empowerment-health debate in India and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W3024197330,"Blood-sucking horseflies (tabanids) prefer warmer (sunlit, darker) host animals and generally attack them in sunshine, the reason for which was unknown until now. Recently, it was hypothesized that blood-seeking female tabanids prefer elevated temperatures, because their wing muscles are quicker and their nervous system functions better at a warmer body temperature brought about by warmer microclimate, and thus they can more successfully avoid the host's parasite-repelling reactions by prompt takeoffs. To test this hypothesis, we studied in field experiments the success rate of escape reactions of tabanids that landed on black targets as a function of the target temperature, and measured the surface temperature of differently coloured horses with thermography. We found that the escape success of tabanids decreased with decreasing target temperature, that is escape success is driven by temperature. Our results explain the behaviour of biting horseflies that they prefer warmer hosts against colder ones. Since in sunshine the darker the host the warmer its body surface, our results also explain why horseflies prefer sunlit dark (brown, black) hosts against bright (beige, white) ones, and why these parasites attack their hosts usually in sunshine, rather than under shaded conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3025199575,"Early T-cell precursor (ETP) is the only subtype of acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) listed in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia. Patients with ETP tend to have worse disease outcomes. ETP is defined by a series of immune markers. The diagnosis of ETP status can be vague due to the limitation of the current measurement. In this study, we performed unsupervised clustering and supervised prediction to investigate whether a molecular biomarker can be used to identify the ETP status in order to stratify risk groups. We found that the ETP status can be predicted by the expression level of Lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF1) with high accuracy (AUC of ROC = 0.957 and 0.933 in two T-ALL cohorts). The patients with ETP subtype have a lower level of LEF1 comparing to the those without ETP. We suggest that incorporating the biomarker LEF1 with traditional immune-phenotyping will improve the diagnosis of ETP."
https://openalex.org/W3025020792,"Comparative social science has a long history of attempts to classify societies and cultures in terms of shared characteristics. However, only recently has it become feasible to conduct quantitative analysis of large historical datasets to mathematically approach the study of social complexity and classify shared societal characteristics. Such methods have the potential to identify recurrent social formations in human societies and contribute to social evolutionary theory. However, in order to achieve this potential, repeated studies are needed to assess the robustness of results to changing methods and data sets. Using an improved derivative of the Seshat: Global History Databank, we perform a clustering analysis of 271 past societies from sampling points across the globe to study plausible categorizations inherent in the data. Analysis indicates that the best fit to Seshat data is five subclusters existing as part of two clearly delineated superclusters (that is, two broad ""types"" of society in terms of social-ecological configuration). Our results add weight to the idea that human societies form recurrent social formations by replicating previous studies with different methods and data. Our results also contribute nuance to previously established measures of social complexity, illustrate diverse trajectories of change, and shed further light on the finite bounds of human social diversity."
https://openalex.org/W3025703822,"Altered expression of caveolin-1 (CAV1) and autophagy marker ATG4C is observed in various types of human cancers. However, the clinical significance of CAV1 and ATG4C expression in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains largely unknown. The present study aims to explore the clinicopathological value and prognostic significance of CAV1 and ATG4C expression in EOC.The expression pattern and prognostic value of CAV1 and ATG4C mRNA in EOC were analyzed using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database (N = 373). In addition, immunohistochemistry analysis was performed to detect and assay the expression of CAV1 and ATG4C proteins in tissue microarray of EOC.Based on TCGA data, Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with low CAV1 mRNA (p = 0.021) and high ATG4C mRNA (p = 0.018) expression had a significantly shorter overall survival (OS). Cox regression analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of CAV1 (p = 0.023) and ATG4C mRNA (p = 0.040) were independent prognostic factors for OS in EOC. In addition, the Concordance Index of the nomogram for OS prediction was 0.660. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the expression levels of stromal CAV1 and cancerous ATG4C proteins, and high expression of both CAV1 and ATG4C protein in the stroma were found to significantly correlate with the histologic subtypes of EOC, especially with serous subtype.Decreased expression of CAV1 mRNA and increased expression of ATG4C mRNA in EOC can predict poor overall survival. The expression levels of CAV1 protein in stromal cells and ATG4C protein in cancer cells are significantly associated with histologic subtypes of EOC. These findings suggest that CAV1 and ATG4C serve as useful prognostic biomarkers and candidate therapeutic targets in EOC."
https://openalex.org/W3024413461,"Background The new generation of dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanners provide visceral adipose tissue (VAT) estimates by applying different algorithms to the conventional DXA-derived fat parameters such as total fat, trunk fat and android fat for the same image data. Objective This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate whether VAT estimates from Hologic scanners are better predictors of VAT than conventional DXA parameters in pre-pubertal children, and to explore the discrimination ability of these VAT methods for cardiometabolic risks. Methods Healthy pre-pubertal children aged 7–10 years were recruited for basic anthropometric, DXA and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements. Laboratory tests included lipid profile, glycaemic tests and blood pressure. Results All VAT methods had acceptable to excellent performance for the diagnosis of dyslipidaemia (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.753–0.837) and hypertensive risk (AUC = 0.710–0.821) in boys, but suboptimal performance for these risks in girls, except for VAT by MRI in the diagnosis of dyslipidaemia. In both sexes, all VAT methods had no or poor discrimination ability for diabetes risk. Conclusions DXA-derived VAT estimates are very highly correlated with standard methods but has equivalent discrimination abilities compared to the existing DXA-derived fat estimates."
https://openalex.org/W3024798948,"Objective The Falls Risk for Older People in the Community assessment (FROP-Com) was originally developed using 13 risk factors to identify the fall risks of community-dwelling older people. To suit the practical use in busy clinical settings, a brief version adopting 3 most fall predictive risk factors from the original FROP-Com, including the number of falls in the past 12 months, assistance required to perform domestic activities of daily living and observation of balance, was developed for screening purpose (FROP-Com screen). The objectives of this study were to investigate the inter-rater and test-retest reliability, concurrent and convergent validity, and minimum detectable change of the FROP-Com screen in community-dwelling people with stroke. Participants Community-dwelling people with stroke (n = 48) were recruited from a local self-help group, and community-dwelling older people (n = 40) were recruited as control subjects. Results The FROP-Com screen exhibited moderate inter-rater (Intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]2,1 = 0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65–0.87) and test-retest reliability (ICC3,1 = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.46–0.83) and weak associations with two balance measures, the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) (rho = -0.38, p = 0.008) and the Timed “Up & Go” (TUG) test (rho = 0.35, p = 0.016). The screen also exhibited a moderate association with the Chinese version of the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC-C) (ABC-C; rho = -0.65, p<0.001), a measure of subjective balance confidence. Conclusions The FROP-Com screen is a reliable clinical tool with convergent validity paralleled with subjective balance confidence measure that can be used in fall risk screening of community-dwelling people with stroke. However, one individual item, the observation of balance, will require additional refinement to improve the potential measurement error."
https://openalex.org/W3024969333,"The optimal timing to initiate dialysis among patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of <5 mL/min/1.73 m2 is unknown. We hypothesized that dialysis initiation time can be deferred in this population even with high uremic burden. A case-crossover study with case (0–30 days before dialysis initiation [DI]) and control (90–120 days before DI) periods was conducted in 1,079 hemodialysis patients aged 18–90 years at China Medical University Hospital between 2006 and 2015. The uremic burden was quantified based on 7 uremic indicators that reached the predefined threshold in case period, namely hemoglobin, serum albumin, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, potassium, phosphorus, and bicarbonate. Dialysis timing was classified as standard (met 0–2 uremic indicators), late (3–5 indicators), and very late (6–7 indicators). Median eGFR-DI of the 1,079 patients was 3.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 and was 2.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 in patients with very late initiation. The median follow-up duration was 2.42 years. Antibiotics, diuretics, antihypertensive medications, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were more prevalently used during the case period. The fully adjusted hazards ratios of all-cause mortality for the late and very late groups were 0.97 (95% confidence interval 0.76–1.24) and 0.83 (0.61–1.15) compared with the standard group. It is safe to defer dialysis initiation among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) having an eGFR of <5 mL/min/1.73 m2 even when patients having multiple biochemical uremic burdens. Coordinated efforts in acute infection prevention, optimal fluid management, and prevention of accidental exposure to NSAIDs are crucial to prolong the dialysis-free survival."
https://openalex.org/W3025121098,"This paper introduces a novel method to evaluate the local impact of behavioral scenarios on disease prevalence and burden with representative individual level data while ensuring that the model is in agreement with the qualitative patterns of global relative risk (RR) estimates. The method is used to estimate the impact of behavioral scenarios on the burden of disease due to ischemic heart disease (IHD) and diabetes in the Turkish adult population.Disease specific Hierarchical Bayes (HB) models estimate the individual disease probability as a function of behaviors, demographics, socio-economics and other controls, where constraints are specified based on the global RR estimates. The simulator combines the counterfactual disease probability estimates with disability adjusted life year (DALY)-per-prevalent-case estimates and rolls up to the targeted population level, thus reflecting the local joint distribution of exposures. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2016 study meta-analysis results guide the analysis of the Turkish National Health Surveys (2008 to 2016) that contain more than 90 thousand observations.The proposed Qualitative Informative HB models do not sacrifice predictive accuracy versus benchmarks (logistic regression and HB models with non-informative and numerical informative priors) while agreeing with the global patterns. In the Turkish adult population, Increasing Physical Activity reduces the DALYs substantially for both IHD by 8.6% (6.4% 11.2%), and Diabetes by 8.1% (5.8% 10.6%), (90% uncertainty intervals). Eliminating Smoking and Second-hand Smoke predominantly decreases the IHD burden 13.1% (10.4% 15.8%) versus Diabetes 2.8% (1.1% 4.6%). Increasing Fruit and Vegetable Consumption, on the other hand, reduces IHD DALYs by 4.1% (2.8% 5.4%) while not improving the Diabetes burden 0.1% (0% 0.1%).While the national RR estimates are in qualitative agreement with the global patterns, the scenario impact estimates are markedly different than the attributable risk estimates from the GBD analysis and allow evaluation of practical scenarios with multiple behaviors."
