https://openalex.org/W1969390931,"A sea-level curve of the past 35,000 years for the Atlantic continental shelf of the United States is based on more than 80 radiocarbon dates, 15 of which are older than 15,000 years. Materials include shallow-water mollusks, oolites, coralline algae, beachrock, and salt-marsh peat. Sea level 30,000 to 35,000 years ago was near the present one. Subsequent glacier growth lowered sea level to about -130 meters 16,000 years ago. Holocene transgression probably began about 14,000 years ago, and continued rapidly to about 7000 years ago. Dates from most shelves of the world agree with this curve, suggesting that it is approximately the eustatic curve for the period."

The first group, of 10-minute duration, began about 70 minutes after launch time; the second, having more than twice the amplitude and a duration of 9 minutes, commenced 81 minutes after launch time. From information on the Saturn V trajectory and analysis of recorded data, it is established that the first group represents sound emitted either by the first stage reentry or by the second stage when its elevation was above 120 kilometers. The second, more intense wave group represents the sound from the powered first stage. A reversal of signal occurs because the rocket outran its own sound. Fourier analyses indicate that the energy extends to relatively long periods—10 seconds for the first stage and 7 seconds for the second. Trapping of sound in the upper atmospheric sound channel can be the cause of the separation of the signal into two distinct groups."

The editorial by Li Peng, premier of China ([5 July, p. 13][2]), gives a positive signal that the Chinese government finally realizes that it is time to replace the empty “ism” with science. Science is not merely a collection of utilitarian tools for planting rice, building highways, and so forth.

The core spirit of science is to seek truths through unrelenting effort and utmost honesty and to uphold truths with courage and integrity. These are vital elements for all societies, especially for today's China. Science also teaches people to think independently, and to question and reason objectively. These two aspects are critical for preparing China to have a national common ground and for bringing a new kind of people into being, who have the vision, character, and capability to make China a good member of the global village.

Science is needed everywhere for economic development, especially for China, because of its huge population and limited arable land. Li Peng's editorial correctly identifies agriculture as the biggest problem. However, many experts believe that science and technology alone cannot solve China's agricultural problems ([1][3]); there is much debate about the world's grain supply and Chinese grain needs in 2030, when China's population is projected to reach 1.6 billion ([2][4]).

China's agricultural problem is due mainly to the marketing system, policy, management, lack of infrastructure, and government's neglect of the farmer's interest. So far, it is not a production problem. Chinese farmers do not have ownership of the land they use. This situation results in low investment for land improvement and maintenance. Other issues—such as price control for grains, government grain procurement quotas, and grain movement restrictions—discourage farmers from producing more. At the same time, these factors encourage farmers to hold back grain stocks in their own households.

Current Chinese government policy promoting “three highs” (high yield, high quality, and high efficiency) appears to be meeting short-term immediate demand, but in the long run, excessive use of agricultural chemicals and water and an increase in the crop index are likely to result in increased pollution, erosion, waste, and deterioration of natural resources. Agricultural education, research, and extension in China are mostly separated. Agricultural education is under the Ministry of Agriculture, independent from other higher education. Infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, is lacking. Government investment in agriculture amounted to only 1.3 percent of the total state investment in 1995 ([3][5]). Most significant, there is a critical water shortage in China. Moving water cannot meet total demand because the annual average water supply [650 billion cubic meters (bcm)] is much below the total potential demand ([4][6]). Where and how to find new water resources for agriculture, industry, and human needs is an urgent issue.

We applaud the Chinese government's call to place a high priority on science, and an even higher priority on agriculture. Such a call can only be effective together with a call for policy changes.

3. 3.[↵][10] The 1995 state investment on fixed capital totaled 1994.5 billion yuan (1 U.S. dollar = 8.3 yuan) of which agriculture received only 26.4 billion yuan.
 

4. 4.[↵][11] By 2030, the projected total agricultural water need is 900 bcm, of which 700 bcm would be for grain production alone.

Science requires the freedom to challenge ideas openly. If the Communist government of China wants partners, it should begin with its own intellectuals.
