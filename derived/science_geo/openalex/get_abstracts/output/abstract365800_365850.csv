The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is critical for normal development and for mediating plant responses to stressful environmental conditions. Now, two papers present analyses of candidate ABA receptors (see the news story by Pennisi ). Ma et al. (p. 1064; published online 30 April) and Park et al. (p. 1068, published online 30 April) used independent strategies to search for proteins that physically interact with ABI family phosphatase components of the ABA response signaling pathway. Both groups identified different members of the same family of proteins, which appear to interact with ABI proteins to form a heterocomplex that can act as the ABA receptor. The variety of both families suggests that the ABA receptor may not be one entity, but rather a class of closely related complexes, which may explain previous difficulties in establishing its identity."

However, little is known about the neurobiological underpinnings of self-control and how or why these neural mechanisms might differ between successful and unsuccessful decision-makers. Hare et al. (p. 646 ) used brain imaging in a dieting population undergoing real-life decisions between a healthy or a tempting, yet nutritionally inferior, choice of food. Activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex correlated with the value of the stimulus, termed goal value. Importantly, this activity integrated both health and taste values in individuals who were able to exert self-control in their choices, while reflecting only taste in those unable to exert self-control."

However, the genetic relationships among the diverse populations on the African continent have been unclear. Tishkoff et al. (p. 1035; see the cover, published online 30 April) provide a detailed genetic analysis of most major groups of African populations. The findings suggest that Africans represent 14 ancestral populations. Populations tend to be of mixed ancestry which documents historical migrations. The data mainly support but sometimes challenge proposed relationships between groups of self-identified ethnicity previously hypothesized on the basis of linguistic studies. The authors also examined populations of African Americans and individuals of mixed ancestry from Cape Town, documenting the variation and origins of admixture within these groups."

In grasslands, nutrient enrichment reduces plant species diversity, but the mechanisms underlying this loss of biodiversity remain unclear. Hautier et al. (p. 636 ) use an experimental manipulation, addition of supplementary light to the grassland understory, which supports the idea that competition for light is the major mechanism of plant diversity loss."

https://openalex.org/W1992945452,"Zeolites, microporous aluminosilciates with a cage-like framework, are industrially important in catalysis and separation. The bigger the pore size that can be achieved in a zeolite, the bigger and more complex the reactant molecules that can be accommodated for catalytic or other purposes. A new zeolite landmark is reported in this issue, the synthesis of ITQ-37, a new germanosilicate zeolite with the largest pores to date, about 25 Å across. Materials with pores of this size have previously been mostly amorphous. ITQ-37 has a single-channel system, so that the pores are readily accessible, and has chiral pores, useful for the separation of enantiomorphic molecules. With extralarge pores, zeolites could catalyse reactions between larger molecules. Here a zeolite with the largest pores to date is synthesized, about 25 ångstroms across; the structure is also chiral, which is useful in the separation of enantiomorphic molecules. The synthesis is done by crystallization of a gel of germanate and silicate dissolved in a bulky organic molecular template, using high-throughput techniques. The synthesis of crystalline molecular sieves with pore dimensions that fill the gap between microporous and mesoporous materials is a matter of fundamental and industrial interest1,2,3. The preparation of zeolitic materials with extralarge pores and chiral frameworks would permit many new applications. Two important steps in this direction include the synthesis4 of ITQ-33, a stable zeolite with 18 × 10 × 10 ring windows, and the synthesis5 of SU-32, which has an intrinsically chiral zeolite structure and where each crystal exhibits only one handedness. Here we present a germanosilicate zeolite (ITQ-37) with extralarge 30-ring windows. Its structure was determined by combining selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) in a charge-flipping algorithm6. The framework follows the SrSi2 (srs) minimal net7 and forms two unique cavities, each of which is connected to three other cavities to form a gyroidal channel system. These cavities comprise the enantiomorphous srs net of the framework. ITQ-37 is the first chiral zeolite with one single gyroidal channel. It has the lowest framework density (10.3 T atoms per 1,000 Å3) of all existing 4-coordinated crystalline oxide frameworks, and the pore volume of the corresponding silica polymorph would be 0.38 cm3 g-1."
https://openalex.org/W1999732094,"Gene silencing by double-stranded RNA, denoted RNA interference, represents a new paradigm for rational drug design. However, the transformative therapeutic potential of short interfering RNA (siRNA) has been stymied by a key obstacle-safe delivery to specified target cells in vivo. Macrophages are particularly attractive targets for RNA interference therapy because they promote pathogenic inflammatory responses in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes. Here we report the engineering of beta1,3-D-glucan-encapsulated siRNA particles (GeRPs) as efficient oral delivery vehicles that potently silence genes in mouse macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Oral gavage of mice with GeRPs containing as little as 20 microg kg(-1) siRNA directed against tumour necrosis factor alpha (Tnf-alpha) depleted its messenger RNA in macrophages recovered from the peritoneum, spleen, liver and lung, and lowered serum Tnf-alpha levels. Screening with GeRPs for inflammation genes revealed that the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (Map4k4) is a previously unknown mediator of cytokine expression. Importantly, silencing Map4k4 in macrophages in vivo protected mice from lipopolysaccharide-induced lethality by inhibiting Tnf-alpha and interleukin-1beta production. This technology defines a new strategy for oral delivery of siRNA to attenuate inflammatory responses in human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2009534332,"To understand how brain states and behaviors are generated by neural circuits, it would be useful to be able to perturb precisely the activity of specific cell types and pathways in the nonhuman primate nervous system. We used lentivirus to target the light-activated cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) specifically to excitatory neurons of the macaque frontal cortex. Using a laser-coupled optical fiber in conjunction with a recording microelectrode, we showed that activation of excitatory neurons resulted in well-timed excitatory and suppressive influences on neocortical neural networks. ChR2 was safely expressed, and could mediate optical neuromodulation, in primate neocortex over many months. These findings highlight a methodology for investigating the causal role of specific cell types in nonhuman primate neural computation, cognition, and behavior, and open up the possibility of a new generation of ultraprecise neurological and psychiatric therapeutics via cell-type-specific optical neural control prosthetics."

https://openalex.org/W1970900633,"Gene Expression in Hybrids A large proportion of genes differ in their expression patterns between closely related species, and this divergence is believed to be an important driver of phenotypic evolution. However, little is known about the genetic basis of this divergence. Tirosh et al. (p. 659 ) use allele-specific expression profiling of two yeast species and their hybrid to identify which genes diverged in expression owing to changes in their genomic loci (cis) and which genes diverged owing to changes in their regulators (trans). The data can be used to explain the distinct gene expression pattern observed in the hybrid."
https://openalex.org/W1983742724,"Vive La Différence How closely do climate changes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres resemble each other? Much discussion has concentrated on the Holocene, the warm period of the past 11,500 years in which we now live, which represents a baseline to which contemporary climate change can be compared. Schaefer et al. (p. 622 ; see the Perspective by Balco ) present a chronology of glacial movement over the last 7000 years in New Zealand, which they compare to similar records from the Northern Hemisphere. Clear differences are observed between the histories of glaciers in the opposing hemispheres, which may be owing to regional controls. Thus, neither of two popular arguments—that the hemispheres change in-phase or that they change in an anti-phased manner—appear to be correct."

https://openalex.org/W2066885219,"Hard Graft In plants, it is not clear whether heritable changes can be induced by tissue grafting—for example, when one plant is grafted onto a different root stock. Stegemann and Bock (p. 649 ) now show that genetic material is transferred between plants across graft junctions. This suggests that eukaryotic cells can indeed exchange genetic information, and in this way, grafting allows genes to cross species barriers. Although the exchange is limited to the site around the graft, the finding blurs the boundary between natural gene transfer and genetic engineering techniques and suggests that natural grafting may serve as a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer during evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2037380242,"Theories of reading have posited the existence of a neural representation coding for whole real words (i.e., an orthographic lexicon), but experimental support for such a representation has proved elusive. Using fMRI rapid adaptation techniques, we provide evidence that the human left ventral occipitotemporal cortex (specifically the ""visual word form area,"" VWFA) contains a representation based on neurons highly selective for individual real words, in contrast to current theories that posit a sublexical representation in the VWFA."
https://openalex.org/W1969599049,"Different global patterns of brain activity are associated with distinct arousal and behavioral states of an animal, but how the brain rapidly switches between different states remains unclear. We here report that repetitive high-frequency burst spiking of a single rat cortical neuron could trigger a switch between the cortical states resembling slow-wave and rapid-eye-movement sleep. This is reflected in the switching of the membrane potential of the stimulated neuron from slow UP/DOWN oscillations to a persistent-UP state or vice versa, with concurrent changes in the temporal pattern of cortical local field potential (LFP) recorded several millimeters away. These results point to the power of single cortical neurons in modulating the behavioral state of an animal."
https://openalex.org/W2064887977,"Methylation of Lys residues on histone proteins is a well known and extensively characterized epigenetic mark. The recent discovery of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) demonstrated that lysine methylation can be dynamically controlled. Among the histone demethylases so far identified, LSD1 has the unique feature of functioning through a flavin-dependent amine oxidation reaction. Data base analysis reveals that mammalian genomes contain a gene (AOF1, for amine-oxidase flavin-containing domain 1) that is homologous to the LSD1-coding gene. Here, we demonstrate that the protein encoded by AOF1 represents a second mammalian flavin-dependent histone demethylase, named LSD2. The new demethylase is strictly specific for mono- and dimethylated Lys4 of histone H3, recognizes a long stretch of the H3 N-terminal tail, senses the presence of additional epigenetic marks on the histone substrate, and is covalently inhibited by tranylcypromine. As opposed to LSD1, LSD2 does not form a biochemically stable complex with the C-terminal domain of the corepressor protein CoREST. Furthermore, LSD2 contains a CW-type zinc finger motif with potential zinc-binding sites that are not present in LSD1. We conclude that mammalian LSD2 represents a new flavin-dependent H3-Lys4 demethylase that features substrate specificity properties highly similar to those of LSD1 but is very likely to be part of chromatin-remodeling complexes that are distinct from those involving LSD1.

Histones pack the eukaryotic DNA into the nucleosome, the basic unit of chromatin (1Zlatanova J. Bishop T.C. Victor J.M. Jackson V. van Holde K. Structure. 2009; 17: 160-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These highly conserved proteins are not merely spools to wind DNA, but they rather regulate gene expression by modulating the activity of the transcriptional machinery. This is achieved through recognition of histone post-translational modifications by specific transcription factors, according to a scheme dictated by the so-called “histone code” (2Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7709) Google Scholar, 3Ruthenburg A.J. Li H. Patel D.J. Allis C.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Methylation of Lys residues on the histone N-terminal tails is one of the most extensively characterized epigenetic marks, being involved in the regulation of a plethora of fundamental processes such as heterochromatin formation, X-chromosome inactivation, and DNA repair (4Sims 3rd, R.J.

The recent discovery of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) 3The abbreviations used are: LSDlysine-specific demethylaseChes2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acidMes4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. demonstrated that lysine methylation can be dynamically controlled and is not a static epigenetic mark as thought in the past (6Shi Y.

Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Battaglioli E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2203-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). LSD1 specifically acts on mono- and dimethylated Lys4 of histone H3 through an oxidative process that requires FAD as essential redox cofactor (Fig. 1a). More recently, several other histone demethylases have been uncovered; they feature the property of containing a JmjC catalytic domain that carries out the reaction through an iron-dependent mechanism (8Anand R. Marmorstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35425-35429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The JmjC enzymes are able to act on trimethylated lysines, which is mechanistically impossible for flavin-catalyzed oxidative demethylation reactions (7Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Battaglioli E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2203-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Histone demethylases have been found in association with a number of chromatin-remodeling complexes and are involved in many diverse transcriptional programs (9Smith B.C. Denu J.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Analysis of sequence data bases reveals that most mammalian genomes contain a gene (denoted as AOF1, for amine-oxidase flavin-containing domain 1) that is homologous to the gene encoding for LSD1 (Fig. 1b). Alignment of the corresponding protein sequences scores an overall 33% identity in the C-terminal amine oxidase domain (13Binda C. Mattevi A. Edmondson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23973-23976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and in the preceding SWIRM domain (14Da G. Lenkart J. Zhao K. Shiekhattar R. Cairns B.R. Marmorstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 2057-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Indeed, phylogenetic analyses indicate that the two proteins are evolutionary related (15Zhou X. Ma H. BMC Evol. Biol. 2008; 8: 294Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Here we report on the expression, purification, and biochemical characterization of the enzyme encoded by the mouse AOF1 gene, and we demonstrate that the protein, which we name LSD2, 4Scientists in the chromatin field recently proposed to establish a rational nomenclature that envisions the acronym KDM (K-demethylases) for histone-Lys demethylases (10Allis C.D. Berger S.L. Cote J. Dent S. Jenuwien T. Kouzarides T. Pillus L. Reinberg D. Shi Y. Shiekhattar R. Shilatifard A. Workman J. Zhang Y. Cell. 2007; 131: 633-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Being the forerunner of this class of enzymes, LSD1 was named KDM1, whereas the JmjC proteins were sequentially denoted as KDM2 and so forth. Moreover, in a recent phylogenetic analysis (15Zhou X. Ma H. BMC Evol. Biol. 2008; 8: 294Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), LSD1 and the AOF1-encoded protein have been named KDM1A and KDM1B, respectively. Given the widespread usage of the “LSD1” acronym in current literature, we have chosen the name “LSD2” for this new member of the flavin-dependent lysine demethylase family. is a flavin-dependent histone demethylase acting on mono- and dimethylated Lys4 of histone H3. LSD2 enzymatic activity is comparatively analyzed in the light of the homologous LSD1 and of the implications for its biological role in chromatin processes. Reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated. The cDNA of LSD2 from Mus musculus was amplified by PCR to generate a full-length and two N-terminally truncated (Δ25 and Δ257) constructs. Amplified fragments were cloned between HindIII and XhoI restriction sites (enzymes from New England Biolabs) in a modified version of pET28b vector, and the His6-tagged fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-DE3 RPplus cells (Stratagene). The construct LSD2 Δ25 proved to produce the protein with the highest degree of solubility and stability, and therefore, it was selected for biochemical studies (throughout the text we will refer to the Δ25 construct as LSD2). The cells were grown in a Bioflo 3000 fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific, NJ) at 37 °C up to a A600 of 2.0, and protein production was induced at 25 °C by the addition of 0.25 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Harvested cells (30 g) were resuspended in 150 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 mg deoxyribonuclease I, and 3 tablets of EDTA-free protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell disruption was accomplished using an Emulsiflex 3C (Avestin Inc.), and cell debris was removed by centrifuging at 70,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Cell extract was loaded on a nickel affinity column (HisTrap FF 1 ml; GE Healthcare). The resin was washed with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5% (w/v) glycerol, and protein was eluted with 100 mm imidazole in the same buffer. Fractions enriched in LSD2 were pooled and loaded onto a HiScreen CaptoQ anion exchange column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.5, 10% (w/v) glycerol. Elution was performed by a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1 m). Fractions containing LSD2 were concentrated using an Amicon30 (Millipore) ultrafiltration device, and then gel filtered in 50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 8.0, 5% (w/v) glycerol on a Superdex200 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare). Sample purity was checked by SDS-PAGE, and protein concentration was estimated by the flavin absorption peak at 458 nm (Fig. 3). Extinction coefficient was determined to be 10.4 mm−1 cm−1 (16Aliverti A. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 131: 9-23PubMed Google Scholar). Time course measurements were performed under aerobic conditions by using a Cary 100 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian Inc.) equipped with a thermostatted cell holder (T = 25 °C). Enzymatic activities were evaluated using both horseradish peroxidase-coupled (17Smith T.A. Barker J.H. Zappia V. Pegg A.E. Progress in Polyamine Research: Novel Biochemical, Pharmacological and Clinical Aspects. Plenum Press, New York1988Google Scholar) and formaldehyde dehydrogenase-coupled (18Lizcano J.M. Unzeta M. Tipton K.F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) assays with histone H3 peptides as substrates (Thermo Electron Corp., Ulm, Germany; Fig. 1a). In both cases, the reaction was started by adding 3 μl of the LSD2 enzyme (50 μm protein in 50 mm Hepes/NaOH buffer, pH 8.0, and 5% (w/v) glycerol) to 150-μl reaction mixtures. In the peroxidase-coupled assay, the reaction mixture consisted of 45 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 8.5, 0.1 mm 4-aminoantipyrine, 1 mm 3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid, 0.35 μm horseradish peroxidase, and variable concentrations (3–120 μm) of methylated peptides. Absorbance changes were monitored at 515 nm, and an extinction coefficient of 26 mm−1 cm−1 was used to calculate the initial velocities values (7Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Battaglioli E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2203-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In the formaldehyde dehydrogenase-coupled assay, the mixture contained 45 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 8.5, 0.2 unit/ml formaldehyde dehydrogenase, and 2 mm NAD+. The reaction was followed by monitoring NADH formation at 340 nm (ϵ340 = 6.22 mm−1 cm−1). The initial velocity values were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Grafit (Erithacus software), which provides the kcat and Km parameters along with their associated errors (see Table 1). Inhibition assays were performed by using the peroxidase-coupled assay in the presence of varied concentrations (1–120 μm) of dimethylated H3-K4 peptide and of the inhibitor under analysis. The initial velocity values were fitted to equations describing competitive, uncompetitive, and noncompetitive inhibition.TABLE 1Comparative analysis of steady-state kinetic parameters and inhibition of LSD2 and LSD1 towards peptide substrate or inhibitorsnaThe length (number of amino acids) of the histone H3 N-terminal peptide is indicated.

Open table in a new tab To evaluate the effects of ionic strength on LSD2 activity, the assays were performed by the peroxidase-coupled assay using increasing amounts of NaCl and KCl in the reaction mixture, starting from 1 mm up to 500 mm. In the determination of the pH dependence of the enzyme activity, the pH range was covered using Mes/NaOH (pH 6.0 or 6.5), Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, or 8.5), or Ches/NaOH (pH 9.0, 9.5, or 10.0) buffers at a final concentration of 45 mm. The ionic strength was kept constant at 40 mm by the addition of appropriate amounts of NaCl. The final enzyme and substrate concentrations were 1.0 and 30 μm, respectively. The amount of zinc present in protein solutions was measured using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences ELAN DRC-e instrument, following the standard procedures suggested by the manufacturer. Field blanks and blanks of reagents used throughout the procedure were evaluated and taken into account. Gel filtered protein solutions consisted of 60 μm LSD2 in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 10% (w/v) glycerol. The experiment was repeated on three different protein preparations without observing any significant variations. As a control, we evaluated whether the protein contained other cations such as manganese, nickel, and calcium. None of them was detected in significant amounts. Furthermore, we verified that other flavoproteins (a bacterial flavin-dependent monooxygenase and the human LSD1·CoREST complex) that do not specifically bind zinc did not exhibit any significant zinc content in the mass spectrometry analysis. The LSD1-binding domain of human CoREST (residues 305–482; the C-terminal region of the protein) (19Yang M. Gocke C.B. Luo X. Borek D. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Otwinowski Z. Yu H. Mol.

Cell extracts containing glutathione S-transferase-tagged CoREST and His6-tagged LSD2 were subsequently passed through GSTrap and HisTrap columns (GE Healthcare) in a tandem affinity pulldown procedure, following the protocols for the in vitro reconstitution of the LSD1-CoREST complex (20Forneris F.

To rule out the possibility that the glutathione S-transferase and His6 tags may hamper the interaction, untagged CoREST and LSD2 were obtained by Prescission and TEV protease cleavage and incubated overnight in 1.5:1 molar ratio (CoREST:LSD2) at 4 °C. The sample was then loaded on a Superdex200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) in 50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 8.0, 5% (w/v) glycerol, and the fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In vitro reconstitution and enzymatic assays with the human LSD1·CoREST complex were carried out as described (20Forneris F. Binda C. Adamo A. Battaglioli E. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20070-20074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We expressed the LSD2 protein encoded by AOF1 gene from M. musculus (Fig. 1b) as a recombinant enzyme lacking the first 25 amino acids, which are predicted to be disordered on the basis of bioinformatic sequence analysis (21Rost B. Yachdav G. Liu J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W321-W326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). We purified the enzyme to homogeneity, and we found that it tightly binds a flavin cofactor as demonstrated by the characteristic UV-visible spectrum (Fig. 3). Protein denaturation (16Aliverti A. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 131: 9-23PubMed Google Scholar) further showed that the cofactor is a noncovalently bound FAD molecule. To investigate the catalytic activity of LSD2, we probed several histone peptides following procedures similar to those employed for human LSD1 (22Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Battaglioli E. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41360-41365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 23Forneris F. Binda C. Dall'Aglio A. Fraaije M.W. Battaglioli E. Mattevi A. J.

We used two different enzymatic assays that detect hydrogen peroxide and formaldehyde production, respectively (Fig. 1a). These experiments clearly demonstrated that LSD2 is active on peptides corresponding to the N-terminal 21 amino acids of histone H3 that are mono- or dimethylated on Lys4 (Fig. 4). The enzyme exhibited maximal activity at pH 8.5 (Fig. 5), and turned out to be highly sensitive to ionic strength with a substantial drop in activity at ionic concentrations above 100 mm. The turnover numbers at pH 8.5 for the mono- and dimethylated H3-Lys4 substrates resulted to be 0.28 and 2.0 min−1, respectively (Table 1). Various peptides corresponding to different N-terminal segments of H3 were assayed to identify the minimal length required for productive binding and catalysis. Peptides of 8 and 16 amino acids were not substrates for LSD2, whereas the catalytic activity on a 30-residue peptide was very similar to that measured on the 21-amino acid substrate (Table 1 and Fig. 4b). Peptides with trimethylated Lys4 were not demethylated, consistently with the flavin-dependent oxidative mechanism, which requires a lone electron pair on the substrate nitrogen atom (9Smith B.C. Denu J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1789: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a). Moreover, like LSD1, LSD2 was inactive on a H3 peptide methylated on Lys9 (Fig. 4b) and on nonhistone substrates such as p53 peptides methylated on Lys370, which was suggested to represent a target site for LSD1 (24Huang J. Sengupta R. Espejo A.B. Lee M.G. Dorsey J.A. Richter M. Opravil S. Shiekhattar R. Bedford M.T. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L. Nature. 2007; 449: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data demonstrated that LSD2 is able to specifically catalyze the demethylation of Lys4 of histone H3 through an oxidative mechanism that (i) requires a redox cofactor for substrate oxidation, (ii) can use oxygen as electron acceptor generating hydrogen peroxide, and (iii) produces formaldehyde as a result of the hydrolysis of the imine group generated by the oxidation of the methylated lysine side chain (Fig. 1a).FIGURE 5pH dependence of the LSD2 activity. The figure plots the dependence of the initial velocities measured using a 21-amino acid dimethyl-Lys4 peptide (30 μm) with the peroxidase-coupled assay. The highest activity is measured in the pH range 7.5–9, whereas it exhibits a sharp drop at lower and higher pH values. The curve shows the best fit of the data to a double pKa model (pKa1 = 7.9 ± 0.1 and pKa2 = 9.0 ± 0.1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To evaluate the effect on enzyme catalysis by additional epigenetic marks on the H3 tail, we used peptides carrying methylated Lys4 together with additional post-translational modifications (25Lall S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1110-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We found that acetylation of Lys9 makes substrate binding less efficient as shown by the 8-fold increase in the Km value (Table 1). Furthermore, hyperacetylation (i.e. simultaneous acetylation of Lys9, Lys14, and Lys18), which is a hallmark of gene activation, makes the peptide unable to function as LSD2 substrate (Fig. 4b). A similar effect is exerted by phosphorylation of Thr3 and Ser10 as well as by methylation of Arg2 and Arg8. The only two epigenetic modifications that did not exhibit any significant effect on catalysis were methylation of Lys9 and Arg17. As summarized in Table 1, these substrate recognition features are very similar to those exhibited by LSD1. Next, to further explore the specificity of substrate binding, we used peptides mutated on the residues surrounding the site of demethylation (Table 1). Mutation of the only glycine residues of the peptide substrate (Gly12-Gly13) impairs LSD2 activity, whereas replacement of Pro16 with Ala has little effect. Moreover, on the basis of the crucial role of Arg2 highlighted by the crystal structure of LSD1 in complex with a histone peptide (20Forneris F. Binda C. Adamo A. Battaglioli E. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20070-20074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we also tested a monomethylated H3-Lys4 peptide with Arg2 mutated to Ala. No demethylation activity was detected, confirming that Arg2 is central to substrate recognition also in LSD2. These observations, together with the finding that the complete stretch of the N-terminal 21 amino acids of H3 is necessary for catalytic activity, suggest that substrate binding does not rely only on methyl-Lys4 recognition, but it also involves extensive interactions with many residues of the H3 tail. Indeed, inhibition studies showed that the demethylated peptide (the product of the LSD2 reaction; Fig. 1a) competitively inhibits LSD2 with a Ki of 33 μm. Likewise, we found that the trimethylated Lys4 peptide and peptides in which Lys4 is mutated to Met, Gln, and Arg, are competitive inhibitors, with the K4M peptide exhibiting the highest affinity (Ki = 0.15 μm) as observed for human LSD1 (Table 1) (20Forneris F. Binda C. Adamo A. Battaglioli E. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20070-20074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In the framework of this biochemical analysis, we also investigated the inhibitory activity of tranylcypromine. This compound was originally developed as inhibitor of human monoamine oxidases and has been widely used as antidepressant (26Edmondson D.E. Mattevi A. Binda C. Li M. Hubálek F. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). More recently, tranylcypromine has been shown to inhibit also LSD1 (Ki of 242 μm), although its potency is 100 times lower compared with that against monoamine oxidases (27Schmidt D.M. McCafferty D.G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4408-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 28Mimasu S. Sengoku T. Fukuzawa S. Umehara T. Yokoyama S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 9750-9755Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of inhibition was found to be similar for all of these enzymes; tranylcypromine reacts with the flavin and forms a covalent adduct with the cofactor. Now, we find that this compound inhibits also LSD2 (Ki = 180 μm) and produces a modification of the flavin absorption spectrum that is fully consistent with formation of a covalent adduct (Fig. 3). As found for LSD1, other monoamine oxidase covalent inhibitors such as pargyline, deprenyl, and rasagiline (26Edmondson D.E. Mattevi A. Binda C. Li M. Hubálek F. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) did not exert any inhibitory effect on LSD2 and did not perturb the enzyme absorption spectrum. These observations are relevant from two points of view. First, they further emphasize the similarity between the catalytic and substrate binding properties of LSD1 and LSD2. Second, they confirm that tranylcypromine is a nonspecific inhibitor of flavin-dependent amine oxidases, a feature that must"

During MESSENGER's second flyby of Mercury, a steady southward IMF was observed and the magnetopause was threaded by a strong magnetic field, indicating a reconnection rate ~10 times that typical at Earth. Moreover, a large flux transfer event was observed in the magnetosheath, and a plasmoid and multiple traveling compression regions were observed in Mercury's magnetotail, all products of reconnection. These observations indicate that Mercury's magnetosphere is much more responsive to IMF direction and dominated by the effects of reconnection than that of Earth or the other magnetized planets."

Together, MESSENGER and Mariner 10 observations of Mercury now provide a near-global look at the planet, revealing lateral and vertical heterogeneities in the color and thus composition of Mercury's crust. Smooth plains cover approximately 40% of the surface, and evidence for the volcanic origin of large expanses of plains suggests that a substantial portion of the crust originated volcanically. A low-reflectance, relatively blue component affects at least 15% of the surface and is concentrated in crater and basin ejecta. Its spectral characteristics and likely origin at depth are consistent with its apparent excavation from a lower crust or upper mantle enriched in iron- and titanium-bearing oxides."

But as with many physical effects, such general pictures can break down once you reduce the size of the system to the nanoscale. Calvo et al. report a striking manifestation of such a change: they find that when the diameter of a magnetic wire is reduced to atomic dimensions, the material's magnetic properties are strongly altered, to the point where magnetism can even be eliminated. This is an unexpected realization of the so-called Kondo effect, for which one usually requires two different species of atoms; it also highlights vividly the need to take into account atomic-scale geometry when investigating the properties of magnetic nanostructures. Magnetism in metals is typically considered an intrinsic property of the material. But when the diameter of a magnetic wire is reduced to atomic dimensions, the material's magnetic properties are strongly altered, to the point where magnetism can even be eliminated. This is an unexpected realization of the so-called Kondo effect, and highlights the need to take into account atomic-scale geometry when investigating the properties of magnetic nanostructures. Iron, cobalt and nickel are archetypal ferromagnetic metals. In bulk, electronic conduction in these materials takes place mainly through the s and p electrons, whereas the magnetic moments are mostly in the narrow d-electron bands, where they tend to align. This general picture may change at the nanoscale because electrons at the surfaces of materials experience interactions that differ from those in the bulk. Here we show direct evidence for such changes: electronic transport in atomic-scale contacts of pure ferromagnets (iron, cobalt and nickel), despite their strong bulk ferromagnetism, unexpectedly reveal Kondo physics, that is, the screening of local magnetic moments by the conduction electrons below a characteristic temperature1. The Kondo effect creates a sharp resonance at the Fermi energy, affecting the electrical properties of the system; this appears as a Fano–Kondo resonance2 in the conductance characteristics as observed in other artificial nanostructures3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. The study of hundreds of contacts shows material-dependent log-normal distributions of the resonance width that arise naturally from Kondo theory12. These resonances broaden and disappear with increasing temperature, also as in standard Kondo systems4,5,6,7. Our observations, supported by calculations, imply that coordination changes can significantly modify magnetism at the nanoscale. Therefore, in addition to standard micromagnetic physics, strong electronic correlations along with atomic-scale geometry need to be considered when investigating the magnetic properties of magnetic nanostructures."

However, behavioral differences between samples have raised many questions (see the Perspective by Saunders ). Hunt et al. (p. 632 ) present a comprehensive study of the relaxation dynamics of the torsional oscillator system as a function of time and temperature. The data provides evidence for a “supersolid glass,” where glassy behavior of crystal dislocations and superfluidity can coexist.

However, how these toxins are built up in the brain is not understood. In this study we investigate whether impairments of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptors play a role in aggregation of Abeta. Using primary neuronal culture and immortal cell line models, we show that expression of normal insulin or IGF-1 receptors confers cells with abilities to reduce exogenously applied Abeta oligomers (also known as ADDLs) to monomers. In contrast, transfection of malfunctioning human insulin receptor mutants, identified originally from patient with insulin resistance syndrome, or inhibition of insulin and IGF-1 receptors via pharmacological reagents increases ADDL levels by exacerbating their aggregation. In healthy cells, activation of insulin and IGF-1 receptor reduces the extracellular ADDLs applied to cells via seemingly the insulin-degrading enzyme activity. Although insulin triggers ADDL internalization, IGF-1 appears to keep ADDLs on the cell surface. Nevertheless, both insulin and IGF-1 reduce ADDL binding, protect synapses from ADDL synaptotoxic effects, and prevent the ADDL-induced surface insulin receptor loss. Our results suggest that dysfunctions of brain insulin and IGF-1 receptors contribute to Abeta aggregation and subsequent synaptic loss."

The α subunit of Navs consists of four homologous domains (DI–DIV) which compose the ion conduction pore and the voltage sensors, allowing sodium flux into the cell upon membrane depolarization and channel activation (Fig. 1B). The cytoplasmic loop linking DIII and DIV contains the gate, which binds to and occludes the cytoplasmic face of the channel pore during fast inactivation (3Patton D.E. West J.W. Catterall W.A.

The excitability of cerebellar granule neurons in fhf1/fhf4-null mice is more severely impaired than in fhf4-null mice and is due to a substantial hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of sodium channel inactivation and slower recovery of channels from fast inactivation (19Goldfarb M. Schoorlemmer J. Williams A. Diwakar S. Wang Q. Huang X. Giza J. Tchetchik D. Kelley K. Vega A. Matthews G. Rossi P. Ornitz D.M. D'Angelo E.

Reciprocally, transfection of FHF4 proteins into primary hippocampal neurons induces a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of sodium channel inactivation (15Lou J.Y. Laezza F. Gerber B.R.

Previously, we solved a crystal structure of FHF1B and demonstrated that FHFs are functionally distinct from FGFs even though FHFs share remarkable structural homology with FGFs (8Olsen S.K. Garbi M.

Here, we present a crystal structure of FHF2A, which enabled us to define a conserved surface on FHFs required for binding to the C-terminal domain of Navs and for the modulation of channel inactivation. The FHF2A structure also reveals how a FHF invariant secondary structure in the C-terminal region of FHFs contributes to the inability of FHFs to bind FGFRs, further substantiating FHFs as functionally distinct from FGFs. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed on a Biacore 2000 instrument (Biacore AB), and FHF-channel interactions were studied at 25 °C. To analyze FHF1 binding to the C-terminal domain of Nav α subunit isoforms, FHF1A1–243 and FHF1B1–181 (Fig. 1A) were immobilized by amine coupling on two flow channels of a research grade CM5 chip (Biacore AB; ∼91 fmol/mm2 of flow channel). To control for nonspecific binding, FGF21–155 was coupled to the control flow channel of the chip (∼84 fmol/mm2). Increasing concentrations of the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of Nav1.5 (Nav1.5CT) in HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) polysorbate 20) were injected over the chip at a flow rate of 50 μl min−1. At the end of each protein injection (180 s), HBS-EP buffer (50 μl min−1) was flowed over the chip to monitor dissociation for 180 s. The chip surface was then regenerated by injecting 50 μl of 2.0 m NaCl in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5. The data were processed with BiaEvaluation software (Biacore AB). For each Nav1.5 injection, the nonspecific responses from the FGF2 control flow channel were subtracted from the responses recorded for the FHF1 flow channel. Maximal equilibrium responses were plotted against the concentrations of Nav1.5CT (Fig. 2, A and B), and from the fitted saturation binding curve the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was calculated. Fitted binding curves were judged to be accurate based on the distribution of the residuals (even and near zero) and χ2 (<10% of Rmax). To analyze channel binding of FHF2-FHF4, Nav1.1CT, Nav1.2CT, Nav1.5CT, Nav1.6CT, and Nav1.9CT were immobilized on flow channels of research grade CM5 chips. To control for nonspecific binding, FGFR1c142–365 was coupled to the control flow channel. The coupling densities (fmol/mm2 of flow channel) were ∼210 (Nav1.1CT), 212 (Nav1.2CT), 61–201 (Nav1.5CT), 74 (Nav1.6CT), 79 (Nav1.9CT), and 69–209 (FGFR1c142–365). Increasing concentrations of FHF2A53–245, FHF3A55–225, FHF4B64–252, or mutant FHF2A proteins in HBS-EP buffer were passed over the chip. Monitoring of dissociation phase, chip regeneration, and data processing were done as described above. For each FHF injection, the nonspecific responses from the FGFR1c control flow channel were subtracted from the responses recorded for the flow channel onto which a channel C-terminal domain was immobilized. Where possible, data were fit using equilibrium analysis as described above. Size-exclusion chromatography experiments were performed on a Waters 626 high pressure liquid chromatography system equipped with a Waters 600S controller and a Waters 996 photodiode array detector. A TSK-G3000SW column (TOSOH Bioscience LLC) was used for all experiments. Because of poor solubility of FHF2A53–245 and FHF3A55–225 in low salt buffers, the experiments were carried out with 25 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1.0 m NaCl. Sample injection volume was 100 μl, and the flow rate was 0.5 ml min−1. Protein retention times were determined by absorbance at 280 nm. The column was calibrated with albumin (69.3 kDa), ovalbumin (44.3 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (28.8 kDa), ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa). The void volume was determined using blue dextran 2000, and the column volume was measured with acetone. To analyze complex formation of different FHF proteins with the C-terminal domain of Nav α subunit isoforms, 2.6 μmol of FHF and 2.6 μmol of C-terminal channel fragment were mixed in 25 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, 1.0 m NaCl, left on ice for about 10 min, and then applied to the size-exclusion column. Retention times of FHF and channel C-terminal domain alone served as reference points. To determine the stoichiometry of the FHF-channel complex, FHF and C-terminal channel fragment were mixed at molar ratios of 1:0.5, 1:1, and 1:2. FHF2A53–245 was mixed with Nav1.6CT in 25 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and the protein complex was treated with thrombin and then isolated by size-exclusion chromatography. The FHF2A-Nav1.6 complex was concentrated to ∼10 mg ml−1, mixed 1:1 with crystallization buffer, and equilibrated against 750 μl of crystallization buffer at 20 °C. FHF2A alone crystallized in 100 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 200 mm (NH4)2SO4, and 22% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 4000. Cryoprotection of the FHF2A crystal was achieved by soaking the crystal in crystallization buffer with stepwise increasing concentrations of glycerol (5–20% v/v) before flash-freezing under a liquid nitrogen stream. The FHF2A crystal belonged to space group P21, and there were two FHF2A molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal with solvent content of 37.5%. Diffraction data were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source beam line X4A, and data sets were indexed, integrated, and scaled using HKL-2000 (34Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38565) Google Scholar). The FHF2A structure was determined by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (35Navaza J. Saludjian P.

For FHF2A staining, fixed neurons were incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody to GFP (Chemicon) followed by biotinylated anti-mouse IgG2a (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and streptavidin-Alexa488 (Molecular Probes). For ankyrin G labeling, fixed neurons were incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody to ankyrin G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by anti-mouse IgG1-Alexa594 (Molecular Probes).

One day later, transfected neurons were processed for fluorescence imaging (15Lou J.Y. Laezza F. Gerber B.R. Xiao M. Yamada K.A. Hartmann H. Craig A.M. Nerbonne J.M. Ornitz D.M. J.

For βIV-spectrin labeling, fixed neurons were incubated with a chicken antibody to βIV-spectrin provided by Dr. M. Komada (Tokyo Institute of Technology) followed by biotin-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgG (Vector Laboratories) and streptavidin-Alexa350 (Invitrogen). GFP- and Alexa350-fluorescent images were acquired using a Zeiss Axio Imager epifluorescence microscope with a 63× objective, and digital images were collected using a Zeiss Axiocam MRC digital camera and Axio-Vision software. Quantitative analysis of FHF2A and FHF4B images was carried out similarly as described (15Lou J.Y. Laezza F. Gerber B.R. Xiao M. Yamada K.A. Hartmann H. Craig A.M. Nerbonne J.M. Ornitz D.M. J.

For analysis of AIS enrichment of FHF4B wild-type and mutants, a mask of the AIS was first generated by thresholding the βIV-spectrin images. The mask of the corresponding region was then applied to the unthresholded GFP images. Fluorescence intensity in dendrites was directly measured on the GFP images. For analysis of AIS enrichment of FHF2A wild-type and mutants, GFP immunofluorescence was averaged within 5-μm zones of the AIS and the brightest proximal dendrite. The AIS enrichment index was defined as the ratio of total fluorescence intensity/area at AIS divided by the total fluorescence intensity/area in dendrites (15Lou J.Y. Laezza F. Gerber B.R. Xiao M.

Murine neuroblastoma-derived Neuro2A cells, which endogenously express at least four Nav α subunit isoforms (15Lou J.Y. Laezza F. Gerber B.R. Xiao M. Yamada K.A. Hartmann H. Craig A.M. Nerbonne J.M. Ornitz D.M. J.

The octa-mutant FHF2B harbored mutations equivalent to those of the octa-mutant FHF2A (see section above). 6 h post-transfection, the cells were trypsinized and plated on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips for electrophysiological analysis 48 h later. Coverslips were placed in the recording chamber perfused with a solution consisting of 120 mm NaCl, 26 mm NaHCO3, 3 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm CdCl2, 3 mm myoinositol, and 2 mm sodium pyruvate. Patch pipettes were pulled with a P-97 Micropipette Puller (Sutter Instruments) to a tip diameter of about 1.5 μm and a resistance of 3–4 megaohms when filled with intracellular recording solution consisting of 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, 104 mm CsF, 50 mm tetraethylamine chloride, 5 mm glucose, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, and 0.2 mm GTP. Cells exhibiting GFP fluorescence were patched in whole cell configuration after obtaining a pipette seal resistance of >5 gigaohms. Voltage clamp commands and current recordings were performed with an Axopatch 200B amplifier and Digidata 1322 analog-digital interface using pClamp9 software (Axon Instruments). Cells were held at a membrane voltage of −110 mV. To measure voltage dependence of sodium channel fast inactivation, membrane voltage was stepped from −110 mV to conditioning voltages (between −110 and −20 mV, at 5-mV intervals) for 60 ms followed by further depolarization to 0 mV. Peak inward sodium currents were converted to fraction of conductance available (not inactivated), and these values for each cell were used to calculate membrane voltage of half-maximal inactivation (V1/2inact) by fitting to the Boltzmann equation, ƒ(Vm) = 1/{1 + e([Vm − V1/2inact]/k}. Statistical significance of differences in fitted parameter values between Neuro2A cells co-expressing GFP and FHF proteins and untransfected cells was calculated by the two-tailed Student's t test. Similarly, statistical significance of differences in AIS enrichment index between neurons expressing wild-type FHFs and neurons expressing mutant FHFs were determined using Student's t test. The following methodologies can be found in the supplemental material: purification of FHF and channel proteins, analysis of FHF2A crystal by mass spectrometry, and analysis of FHF1B-Nav1.6 interaction by SPR spectroscopy. Interaction between FHFs and Navs has been shown using yeast two-hybrid, far-Western blot, and co-immunoprecipitation assays (15Lou J.Y. Laezza F. Gerber B.R. Xiao M. Yamada K.A. Hartmann H.

None of these experimental approaches, however, can unambiguously show whether FHF and channel interact directly. Thus, we used SPR spectroscopy as well as size-exclusion chromatography to examine whether FHF-channel binding is direct. To this end, we expressed and purified the two human full-length splice isoforms of FHF1, FHF1A1–243 and FHF1B1–181 (Fig. 1A), and C-terminal fragments of Nav1.1 (Glu-1787 to Arg-1912; Nav1.1CT), Nav1.2 (Glu-1777 to Gln-1923; Nav1.2CT), Nav1.5 (Glu-1773 to Arg-1919; Nav1.5CT), Nav1.6 (Glu-1765 to Arg-1911; Nav1.6CT), and Nav1.9 (Glu-1585 to Glu-1729; Nav1.9CT) (Fig. 1B).

https://openalex.org/W2079658573,"Bone marrow-derived progenitor cells have recently been shown to be involved in the development of intimal hyperplasia after vascular injury. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) has profound stimulatory effects on intimal hyperplasia, but it is unknown whether these effects involve progenitor cell recruitment. In this study we found that although TGF-beta had no direct effect on progenitor cell recruitment, conditioned media derived from vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) stimulated with TGF-beta induced migration of both total bone marrow (BM) cells and BM-mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and also induced MSC differentiation into smooth muscle like cells. Furthermore, overexpression of the signaling molecule Smad3 in VSMC via adenovirus-mediated gene transfer (AdSmad3) enhanced the TGF-beta's chemotactic effect. Microarray analysis of VSMC stimulated by TGF-beta/AdSmad3 revealed monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) as a likely factor responsible for progenitor cell recruitment. We then demonstrated that TGF-beta through Smad3 phosphorylation induced a robust expression of MCP-1 in VSMC. Recombinant MCP-1 mimicked the stimulatory effect of conditioned media on BM and MSC migration. In the rat carotid injury model, Smad3 overexpression significantly increased MCP-1 expression after vascular injury, consistent with our in vitro results. Interestingly, TGF-beta/Smad3-induced MCP-1 was completely blocked by both Ro-32-0432 and rotterlin, suggesting protein kinase C-delta (PKCdelta) may play a role in TGF-beta/Smad3-induced MCP-1 expression. In summary, our data demonstrate that TGF-beta, through Smad3 and PKCdelta, stimulates VSMC production of MCP-1, which is a chemoattractant for bone marrow-derived cells, specifically MSC. Manipulation of this signaling system may provide a novel approach to inhibition of intimal hyperplasia."
https://openalex.org/W1973103588,"Getting Below the Surface Two-dimensional electron systems have proved to be a productive area for the study of low-dimensional transport. Despite decades of intense effort, the actual dispersion of the electronic excitations—how their energy behaves as a function of momentum as the they move through their two-dimensional space—have eluded experiments. This elusiveness is due to the samples being thin and buried. Kukushkin et al.

The excitations “ride” these waves, with their energy and momentum mapped out using pulses of laser light. The technique should also be applicable to other hard-to-get-at electronic systems."
https://openalex.org/W2139310793,"Statins are widely used to treat hypercholesterolemia but can lead to a number of side effects in muscle, including rhabdomyolysis. Our recent findings implicated the induction of atrogin-1, a gene required for the development of muscle atrophy, in statin-induced muscle damage. Since statins inhibit many biochemical reactions besides cholesterol synthesis, we sought to define the statin-inhibited pathways responsible for atrogin-1 expression and muscle damage. We report here that lovastatin-induced atrogin-1 expression and muscle damage in cultured mouse myotubes and zebrafish can be prevented in the presence of geranylgeranol but not farnesol. Further, inhibitors of the transfer of geranylgeranyl isoprene units to protein targets cause statin muscle damage and atrogin-1 induction in cultured cells and in fish. These findings support the concept that dysfunction of small GTP-binding proteins lead to statin-induced muscle damage since these molecules require modification by geranylgeranyl moieties for their cellular localization and activity. Collectively, our animal and in vitro findings shed light on the molecular mechanism of statin-induced myopathy and suggest that atrogin-1 may be regulated by novel signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1657485500,"Mercury is surrounded by a tenuous exosphere that is supplied primarily by the planet's surface materials and is known to contain sodium, potassium, and calcium. Observations by the Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer during MESSENGER's second Mercury flyby revealed the presence of neutral magnesium in the tail (anti-sunward) region of the exosphere, as well as differing spatial distributions of magnesium, calcium, and sodium atoms in both the tail and the nightside, near-planet exosphere. Analysis of these observations, supplemented by observations during the first Mercury flyby, as well as those by other MESSENGER instruments, suggests that the distinct spatial distributions arise from a combination of differences in source, transfer, and loss processes."
https://openalex.org/W2022195195,"The nematode cuticle is a protective collagenous extracellular matrix that is modified, cross-linked, and processed by a number of key enzymes. This Ecdysozoan-specific structure is synthesized repeatedly and allows growth and development in a linked degradative and biosynthetic process known as molting. A targeted RNA interference screen using a cuticle collagen marker has been employed to identify components of the cuticle biosynthetic pathway. We have characterized an essential peroxidase, MoLT-7 (MLT-7), that is responsible for proper cuticle molting and re-synthesis. MLT-7 is an active, inhibitable peroxidase that is expressed in the cuticle-synthesizing hypodermis coincident with each larval molt. mlt-7 mutants show a range of body morphology defects, most notably molt, dumpy, and early larval stage arrest phenotypes that can all be complemented with a wild type copy of mlt-7. The cuticles of these mutants lacks di-tyrosine cross-links, becomes permeable to dye and accessible to tyrosine iodination, and have aberrant collagen protein expression patterns. Overexpression of MLT-7 causes mutant phenotypes further supporting its proposed enzymatic role. In combination with BLI-3, an H2O2-generating NADPH dual oxidase, MLT-7 is essential for post-embryonic development. Disruption of mlt-7, and particularly bli-3, via RNA interference also causes dramatic changes to the in vivo cross-linking patterns of the cuticle collagens DPY-13 and COL-12.

Collagenous extracellular matrices (ECMs) 3The abbreviations used are: ECMextracellular matrixRNAiRNA interferenceDuoxdual oxidaseRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. serve numerous critical roles and are found throughout the animal kingdom. The cuticle is an ECM that makes up the most external surface of nematodes and its roles are diverse. This tough but flexible exoskeleton maintains body shape, provides a protective barrier to the environment, and permits motility via its attachments to muscles (1Page A.P. Johnstone I.L. WormBook. 2007; (The Caenorhabditis elegans Research Community WormBook 10.1895/wormbook.1.138.1)PubMed Google Scholar). There are two distinct sets of discernible cuticular structures on the surface of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, circumferential indentations termed annulae and longitudinal ridges termed alae. The latter are present only in the first and alternative third stage (dauer) larvae and in adult C. elegans (2Cox G.N. Kusch M. Edgar R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). At the transition between consecutive larval stages, a new cuticle is synthesized from the underlying hypodermis. The term molting is used for the removal and re-synthesis of the cuticle. The cuticle is a complex and versatile tissue made up of multiple layers, each of which has distinct components and levels of structural integrity (3Johnstone I.L. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 21-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 4McMahon L. Muriel J.M. Roberts B. Quinn M. Johnstone I.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1366-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The principal components of the cuticle are the collagens. Over 180 cuticle collagens are encoded in the C. elegans genome, and their temporal expression is cyclical and corresponds to the larval molts (5Johnstone I.L. Barry J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3633-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Each of these synthetic periods is further subdivided into distinct peaks as follows: 4 h prior to, 2 h prior to, and coincident with the molt. Collagens whose temporal expression profiles coincide are predicted to interact with each other and in turn form distinct cuticle substructures (4McMahon L. Muriel J.M. Roberts B. Quinn M. Johnstone I.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1366-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The processing of collagens into a functional cuticle entails a complex sequence of modifications, triple helix formation, proteolysis, and cross-linking events that are described in a number of reviews (1Page A.P. Johnstone I.L. WormBook. 2007; (The Caenorhabditis elegans Research Community WormBook 10.1895/wormbook.1.138.1)PubMed Google Scholar, 6Page A.P. Winter A.D. Adv.

Here we focus on a peroxidase enzyme and its role in the cross-linking steps of cuticle biogenesis during which the pre-formed collagen triple helices are joined by intermolecular disulfide (9Schofield J.D.

Commun. 1981; 99: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Edens W.A. Sharling L. Cheng G. Shapira R. Kinkade J.M. Lee T. Edens H.A. Tang X. Sullards C. Flaherty D.B. Benian G.M. Lambeth J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 879-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Disulfide bonds are catalyzed by enzymes of the thioredoxin class and are soluble in detergent and reducing agents, while glutamate and tyrosine bonds, which are resistant to reducing conditions (2Cox G.N. Kusch M. Edgar R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 14Cox G.N. Staprans S. Edgar R.S. Dev. Biol. 1981; 86: 456-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), are catalyzed by transglutaminases and peroxidase enzymes, respectively (15Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). A proportion of the adult cuticle remains intact after treatment in reducing conditions and represents the components that are cross-linked by the latter two enzymes. Differing extents of cuticle solubility are observed in different larval stages, suggesting function-related, stage-specific cross-linking. For example, the extensively cross-linked dauer cuticle may facilitate the extreme resilience of this stage to adverse conditions (14Cox G.N. Staprans S. Edgar R.S. Dev. Biol. 1981; 86: 456-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Mutants of potential cross-link catalyzing enzymes exhibit morphological aberrations that range from Dpy to lethality (Let), and this exemplifies the requirement of these bonds in cuticle biogenesis (1Page A.P. Johnstone I.L. WormBook. 2007; (The Caenorhabditis elegans Research Community WormBook 10.1895/wormbook.1.138.1)PubMed Google Scholar, 6Page A.P. Winter A.D. Adv. Parasitol. 2003; 53: 85-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Tyrosine linkages are di- and tri-tyrosines and, specifically in nematodes, isotri-tyrosine bonds, all of which are biphenyl linkages of tyrosine molecules (12Fujimoto D. Horiuchi K. Hirama M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 99: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In nematodes, these bonds link both collagens and cuticulins (12Fujimoto D. Horiuchi K. Hirama M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 99: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Sakura S. Fujimoto D. Photochem.

This is in contrast to the ECMs of vertebrates in which the occurrence of tyrosine-derived cross-links is rare; instead cross-links are predominantly derived from hydroxylated lysine residues (7Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Lysyl hydroxylase-derived linkages are absent from the C. elegans cuticle (14Cox G.N. Staprans S. Edgar R.S. Dev. Biol. 1981; 86: 456-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 18Norman K.R. Moerman D.G. Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 690-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) but do form critical cross-links in the nematode basement membrane collagens (18Norman K.R. Moerman D.G. Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 690-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Peroxidase enzymes form cross-linked bonds by a reaction involving the oxidation of halides. The extensive family of peroxidases are found in all animals, fungi, bacteria, and plants (19Taurog A. Biochimie. 1999; 81: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and includes the myeloperoxidase, eosinophil peroxidase, lactoperoxidase, thyroid peroxidase, and yeast cytochrome c peroxidase (20Daiyasu H. Toh H. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 51: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In higher animals, peroxidases protect against bacteria, parasites, reactive-oxygen damage, and are also biosynthetic in nature, for example in the generation of thyroid hormone. Specificity within these functions is dictated by the halide substrates that the different peroxidases can catalyze (21Morrison M. Schonbaum G.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1976; 45: 861-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar); for example, when tyrosine is a substrate, tyrosine cross-links are formed. All peroxidase reactions require H2O2, a substrate that is generated by the NADPH oxidases. As a consequence of this dependence, peroxidases are most often found to co-localize with their partner NADPH oxidases (22Donkó A. Péterfi Z. Sum A. Leto T. Geiszt M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2005; 360: 2301-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In a class of enzymes termed the dual oxidases (Duox), a unique relationship between a peroxidase and its H2O2 donor is found in which a C-terminal NADPH oxidase domain is directly coupled to an N-terminal peroxidase-like domain. The topology of these enzymes facilitates the efficient coupling of the H2O2-donating and H2O2-utilizing moieties (13Edens W.A. Sharling L. Cheng G. Shapira R. Kinkade J.M. Lee T. Edens H.A. Tang X. Sullards C. Flaherty D.B. Benian G.M. Lambeth J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 879-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). C. elegans possesses two Duox genes, bli-3 (23Simmer F. Moorman C. van der Linden A.M. Kuijk E. van den Berghe P.V. Kamath R.S. Fraser A.G. Ahringer J. Plasterk R.H. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E12Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) and its gene duplication f53g12.3. Although the proteins share 94% similarity, f53g12.3 is partially truncated at its C terminus and is predicted to abolish its NADPH-oxidative activity (13Edens W.A. Sharling L. Cheng G. Shapira R. Kinkade J.M. Lee T. Edens H.A. Tang X. Sullards C. Flaherty D.B. Benian G.M. Lambeth J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 879-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The putative peroxidase domains of BLI-3 and f53g12.3 lack many of the essential heme-binding residues (13Edens W.A. Sharling L. Cheng G. Shapira R. Kinkade J.M. Lee T. Edens H.A. Tang X. Sullards C. Flaherty D.B. Benian G.M. Lambeth J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 879-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), and the functional relevance of this domain is therefore in doubt. However, evidence supporting a role for Duox-derived cross-links in the C. elegans cuticle comes from the blistered cuticle phenotype (Bli) of bli-3 alleles, such as bli-3(e767), and the strong Bli phenotype of RNAi-treated nematodes (13Edens W.A. Sharling L. Cheng G. Shapira R. Kinkade J.M. Lee T. Edens H.A. Tang X. Sullards C. Flaherty D.B. Benian G.M. Lambeth J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 879-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis definitively demonstrated the corresponding loss of tyrosine-derived cross-links in the cuticles of bli-3 RNAi worms (13Edens W.A. Sharling L. Cheng G. Shapira R. Kinkade J.M. Lee T. Edens H.A. Tang X. Sullards C. Flaherty D.B. Benian G.M. Lambeth J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 879-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Following a focused reverse genetic screen with a GFP-tagged collagen matrix marker (24Thein M.C. McCormack G. Winter A.D. Johnstone I.L. Shoemaker C.B. Page A.P. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 226: 523-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we have identified a novel heme peroxidase called MoLT-7 (MLT-7) that in combination with BLI-3 plays an essential role in cuticle collagen cross-linking, ECM formation, and viability of the nematode. In this study, we describe its biochemical, cell biological, and genetic characterization. Worms were cultured and manipulated following standard C. elegans methods (25Sulston J. Hodgkin J. Wood W.B. Community of Caenorhabditis elegans Researchers The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 587-606Google Scholar). N2 (wild type), JR667 unc-119(e2498::Tc1); wIs51, DR96 unc-76(e911), and CB767 bli-3(e767) nematodes were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Centre. The mlt-7 deletion allele tm1794 was obtained from Shohei Mitani of the National Bioresource genome deletion project (Japan). This was backcrossed four times to N2 worms, using a PCR strategy with the following primers: zk4308f1, 5′-gtgtgcctacttcatgcctg-3′; zk4308r1, 5′-cattgagaactgttacagtg-3′; and zk4308r2, 5′-ctaggtagacacgagaatg-3′. The backcrossed mlt-7 mutant strain, TP89A, was maintained as a heterozygote and segregates homozygous mutants that are molt/larval arrest (mlt-7 Lva). The strain TP89B was derived from the occasional homozygous viable progeny from TP89A and segregates predominantly viable DPY homozygotes (mlt-7 Dpy). TP89C represents the mlt-7 heterozygous strain that was derived from a further backcross of TP89B with N2 animals. All genotypes were confirmed by single worm multiplex PCR (26Winter A.D. McCormack G. Page A.P. Dev. Biol. 2007; 308: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The compound mutant strain TP112, mlt-7 (tm1794); bli-3 (e767), is homozygous for e767 and was maintained by selecting tm1794 heterozygotes. The construction of the dpy-13::Ty epitope-tagged transgenic strain IA139, dpy-13(e458); unc-76(e911); ijEx33 [dpy-13::Ty, unc-76(+)], has been described previously (4McMahon L. Muriel J.M. Roberts B. Quinn M. Johnstone I.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1366-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The col-12 gene was tagged, and the transgenic strain IA132, unc-76(e911); ijEx32[col-12::Ty, unc-76(+)], was made using the same strategy (contact authors for details of primers used). The col-12::Ty transgene was constructed from three separate PCR-amplified fragments as follows: a promoter fragment, an N-terminal coding fragment, and a C-terminal coding fragment plus 3′-untranslated fragment, engineered to create a HindIII site toward the N-terminal end of the coding sequence that was used for the subsequent insertion of the Ty tag sequence. The completed plasmid pJM01 was assembled within pBluescript II (Stratagene). The transgenic strain IA132 was generated by co-microinjection of the strain DR96 (unc-76 mutant) with pJM01 (2 μg/ml) and the unc-76 rescue plasmid p7616B (100 μg/ml). The COL-12::Ty protein is secreted and localized within the cuticle, and details of its immunofluorescent localization are to be published elsewhere. Transgenic animals can be selected by rescue of the Unc-76 phenotype. The marker strain TP12, kaIs12 [col-19::gfp], and the RNAi methods used to identify cuticle defects are described in detail elsewhere (8Page A.P. McCormack G. Birnie A.J. Int. J. Parasitol. 2006; 36: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 24Thein M.C. McCormack G. Winter A.D. Johnstone I.L. Shoemaker C.B. Page A.P. Dev.

For the study of peroxidase enzymes, we used the Wormbase data base to select predicted heme peroxidases that displayed associated body morphology defects following genome-wide RNAi studies (27Kamath R.S. Fraser A.G. Dong Y. Poulin G. Durbin R. Gotta M. Kanapin A. Le Bot N. Moreno S. Sohrmann M. Welchman D.P. Zipperlen P. Ahringer J.

A 1772-bp PCR product encoding the full-length peroxidase domain of MLT-7 was amplified from N2 cDNA with the primers below and cloned into the pQE30 vector (Qiagen) to provide an N-terminal His tag to the encoded protein as follows: zk430pqefwd, 5′-gccctgcagtaatgtccatctcccg-3′, and zk430pqerev, 5′-gcgaagcttctagagagctctcc-3′. Protein production was auto-induced in M15 cells at 25 °C for 40 h, using published method and buffers (28Studier F.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4137) Google Scholar). Briefly, transformed colonies were used to inoculate MDG medium with trace metals, 0.5% glucose, 0.25% aspartic acid (28Studier F.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4137) Google Scholar) supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol and cultured overnight at 200–250 rpm at 37 °C. This was used to inoculate ZYM-5052 medium (28Studier F.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4137) Google Scholar) supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol for 40 h at 250–300 rpm at 25 °C. Induced cells were centrifuged and resuspended in lysis buffer, pH 8.0 containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme and 10 mm imidazole. The lysed cells were sonicated, and soluble protein was collected by centrifugation and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns with ProBond resin (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and concentrated using Millipore Microcon centrifugal filters (YM-30), and Western blotting was performed with an anti-HisG antibody (Invitrogen). Functional assays (13Edens W.A. Sharling L. Cheng G. Shapira R. Kinkade J.M. Lee T. Edens H.A. Tang X. Sullards C. Flaherty D.B. Benian G.M. Lambeth J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 879-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) were performed using various concentrations of the MLT-7 and NAS-36 (negative control) recombinant proteins to determine peroxidase activity. 0.0125 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase was used as the positive control. Samples were run in triplicate in 96-well plates using the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate system (Sigma). The reactions were incubated for 30–60 min at room temperature, in the dark, before measuring the absorbance at 630 nm. Peroxidase inhibition assays were similarly performed with 4-aminobenzoic hydrazide (Sigma), using 100 μg/ml recombinant MLT-7 and 0.0125 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase, following a 30–60-min preincubation at room temperature in the dark prior to addition of substrate. The mlt-7 RNAi feeding clone was made by PCR amplification from N2 cDNA using primers zk430.8 rnai forward, 5′-ttgtaagacttgtgacccgg-3′, and zk430.8 rnai reverse, 5′-acgatgtggtcgtttgacggc-3′. The resulting 802-bp product was cloned into pCRScript (Stratagene) and subcloned into the RNAi feeding vector (pPD129.36) by digestion with NotI and PstI. mlt-7 in vitro-transcribed RNA was made by linearizing the RNAi feeding plasmid with NotI and HindIII. Double-stranded RNA was made as described previously (29Winter A.D. Page A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and injected at 0.5 mg/ml into CB767. The library bli-3 RNAi feeding clone (23Simmer F. Moorman C. van der Linden A.M. Kuijk E. van den Berghe P.V. Kamath R.S. Fraser A.G. Ahringer J. Plasterk R.H.

The 2103-bp putative promoter region of the mlt-7 gene was amplified from N2 genomic DNA with the primers zk430.8 promoter forward, 5′-cgcgcatgcggcaggtgcaggtaaaatgaagg-3′, and zk430.8 promoter reverse, 5′-gcgtctagatggagtcttctcatggtgttcc-3′. This region encompasses position −2089 to +14 relative to the initiation ATG. This fragment was cloned into the multi-intron promoterless reporter vector pPD96.04, and semi-stable transgenic lines were obtained following microinjection with a combination of 10 μg/ml of the reporter plasmid and 100 μg/ml p7616B (unc-76 rescue) plasmid into strain DR96 (unc-76 mutants). Transgenic lines were stained for β-galactosidase activity following published methods (29Winter A.D. Page A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A set of staged cDNA samples representative of the mRNA population at every 2 h of post-embryonic development (5Johnstone I.L. Barry J.D.

The PCRs were performed following published protocols (5Johnstone I.L. Barry J.D.

Worms were mounted on sodium azide agar pads, viewed under differential interference contrast (DIC) or epifluorescence optics on a Zeiss Axioscope 2, and images captured on an Axiocam MRm camera using Axiovision software. Immunocytochemistry was carried out as described previously (11Eschenlauer S.C. Page A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4227-4237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) using anti-DPY-7 (4McMahon L. Muriel J.M. Roberts B. Quinn M. Johnstone I.L. Mol. Biol.

Larval stage N2 and mlt-7 Lva mutant worms were selected, washed in 1× M9 buffer, and fixed at 4 °C in 3% glutaraldehyde/PIPES buffer (0.2 m PIPES, pH 7.0). Samples were incubated on ice for 1 h and then washed in PIPES buffer. In preparation for transmission electron microscopy, samples were fixed for 1 h in 1% osmium tetroxide and then embedded in 1.5% agarose prior to dehydration through increasing alcohol from 30 to 100%. The dehydrated worms were embedded in LRW resin, and 60–70 nm sections were cut using a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E Microtome. Sections were contrast-stained with 2% uranyl acetate and then with Reynolds lead citrate and viewed under a Leo 912AB Omega EFTEM microscope. Cosmid M02B10, which overlaps with cosmid ZK430 and contains more upstream mlt-7 sequence, was obtained from the Sanger Institute (Cambridge, UK) and injected at 10 μg/ml into mlt-7 heterozygotes. Rescued homozygotes were selected from transgenic lines, and segregating progeny was scored visually. A mlt-7 gene rescue plasmid was constructed by digesting two fragments from cosmid M02B10; these were then sequentially ligated into the plasmid pGEM-T Easy (Promega). Cloning of an ∼4.7-kb SacII/AatII fragment (containing ∼400 bp of 3′-untranslated) was followed by an ∼11.3-kb NdeI/SacII fragment (containing ∼3.8 kb of 5′ upstream sequence); insert sequences were joined at the SacII site. This mlt-7 gene rescue plasmid was injected at 5 μg/ml into mlt-7 heterozygotes and the viable homozygous strain (TP89B). Overexpression of mlt-7 was achieved by injection of the gene rescue plasmid into wild type worms at 5 and 50 μg/ml. All experiments were performed by co-injection with 5 μg/ml Pdpy-7::gfp, and circularized pTAg was added to make a final mix concentration of 115 μg/ml. Three independent transgenic lines were examined in each case. The B. malayi sequence with TIGR locus identifier (12787.m00394) had the highest BLAST homology score to MLT-7. Amplification of the 5′ end of the B. malayi mlt-7 cDNA was performed using the Invitrogen 5′-RACE system with the following primers: Bm hpx-1 RT 5′-ccgtaaatcattgaaccatc-3′, Bm hpx-1 R1 5′-catgtcgtgactcag-3′, and Bm hpx-1 R2 5′-cgatatctgagatgatagc-3′. Primer Bm hpx-1 RT was used for the cDNA synthesis reaction, and primers Bm hpx-1 R1 and R2 were used in subsequent nested PCR amplifications with the primers AAP and AUAP (Invitrogen). This 5′-RACE sequence allowed amplification of the full-length coding sequence. Groups of 100 adult nematodes (N2 and mlt-7 Dpy mutants) were collected and washed extensively in cold phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% SDS, pH 6.5, before being transferred to IODO-GEN (Pierce)-coated tubes. Worms were then labeled with 200 μCi of 125I on ice for 10 min with gentle agitation. Saturated tyrosine was added to terminate the reactions. The labeled nematodes were then washed extensively in phosphate-buffered saline with protease inhibitor mixture, snap-frozen, and then homogenized with a micro-pestle. Extracts and resultant pellets were prepared with 1% SDS with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and replicates were counted via trichloroacetic acid precipitation. All samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. 50 RNAi-treated animals were collected into M9 buffer, and an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 120 mm Tris, pH 6.8, bromphenol blue) was added. The samples were heated to 80 °C for 10 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was performed with anti-Ty antibody (31Bastin P. Bagherzadeh Z. Matthews K.R. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and then anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Promega) followed by ECL (GE Healthcare). Equivalent loading was confirmed by reprobing the membranes with a β-actin antibody (Sigma). Wild type, bli-3 (e767), and mlt-7 Dpy mutant nematodes were grown on NGM plates, washed in M9 buffer, and frozen at −80 °C prior to extraction. Nematodes were resuspended in 0.5 ml of sonication buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated four times for 20 s. Protein concentration was determined with the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Whole worm extracts were lyophilized and then acid-hydrolyzed for 24 h at 110 °C. Hydrolyzed samples were analyzed by Alta Bioscience (University of Birmingham) in a high resolution lithium buffer using a di-tyrosine marker kindly provided by Dr. Yoji Kato (University of Hyogo, Japan). Nematodes were incubated in M9 buffer containing 1 mg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) at room temperature for 15 min with gentle agitation. Following several washes in M9 buffer, the worms were viewed under epifluorescence (32Moribe H. Yoch"

However, behavioral differences between samples have raised many questions (see the Perspective by Saunders ). Hunt et al.

The data provides evidence for a “supersolid glass,” where glassy behavior of crystal dislocations and superfluidity can coexist.

https://openalex.org/W1967981759,"During development, neuronal growth cones integrate diffusible and contact guidance cues that are conveyed to both actin and microtubule (MT) cytoskeletons and ensure axon outgrowth and pathfinding. Although several post-translational modifications of tubulin have been identified and despite their strong conservation among species, their physiological roles during development, especially in the nervous sytem, are still poorly understood.Here, we have dissected the role of a post-translational modification of the last amino acid of the alpha-tubulin on axonal growth by analyzing the phenotype of precerebellar neurons in Tubulin tyrosin ligase knock-out mice (TTL(-/-)) through in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro analyses. TTL(-/-) neurons are devoid of tyrosinated tubulin. Their pathway shows defects in vivo, ex vivo, in hindbrains open-book preparations or in vitro, in a collagen matrix. Their axons still orient toward tropic cues, but they emit supernumerary branches and their growth cones are enlarged and exhibit an emission of mis-oriented filopodia. Further analysis of the TTL(-/-) growth cone intracellular organization also reveals that the respective localization of actin and MT filaments is disturbed, with a decrease in the distal accumulation of Myosin IIB, as well as a concomitant Rac1 over-activation in the hindbrain. Pharmacological inhibition of Rac1 over-activation in TTL(-/-) neurons can rescue Myosin IIB localization.In the growth cone, we propose that tubulin tyrosination takes part in the relative arrangement of actin and MT cytoskeletons, in the regulation of small GTPases activity, and consequently, in the proper morphogenesis, organization and pathfinding of the growth cone during development."

Inflammation is also important. We recently reported that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a strong inducer of inflammation, stimulates the production of Aβ through EP2 and EP4 receptors, and here we have examined the molecular mechanism. Activation of EP2 and EP4 receptors is coupled to an increase in cellular cAMP levels and activation of protein kinase A (PKA). We found that inhibitors of adenylate cyclase and PKA suppress EP2, but not EP4, receptor-mediated stimulation of the Aβ production. In contrast, inhibitors of endocytosis suppressed EP4, but not EP2, receptor-mediated stimulation. Activation of γ-secretase was observed with the activation of EP4 receptors but not EP2 receptors. PGE2-dependent internalization of the EP4 receptor was observed, and cells expressing a mutant EP4 receptor lacking the internalization activity did not exhibit PGE2-stimulated production of Aβ. A physical interaction between the EP4 receptor and PS-1, a catalytic subunit of γ-secretases, was revealed by immunoprecipitation assays. PGE2-induced internalization of PS-1 and co-localization of EP4, PS-1, and Rab7 (a marker of late endosomes and lysosomes) was observed. Co-localization of PS-1 and Rab7 was also observed in the brain of wild-type mice but not of EP4 receptor null mice. These results suggest that PGE2-stimulated production of Aβ involves EP4 receptor-mediated endocytosis of PS-1 followed by activation of the γ-secretase, as well as EP2 receptor-dependent activation of adenylate cyclase and PKA, both of which are important in the inflammation-mediated progression of Alzheimer disease.

AD is characterized pathologically by the accumulation of tangles and senile plaques. Senile plaques are composed of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides Aβ40 and Aβ42 (1.Hardy J. Selkoe D.J.

To generate Aβ, β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) is first cleaved by β-secretase and then by γ-secretase. Cleavage of APP by α-secretase produces non-amyloidogenic peptides (3.Sisodia S.S.

The γ-secretase is an aspartyl protease complex composed of four core components, including presenilin (PS) 1 and PS2 (5.Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Early onset familial AD is linked to three genes, APP, PS1, and PS2 (5.Haass C.

Therefore, cellular factors that affect the γ-secretase-dependent production of Aβ may be good targets for the development of drugs to prevent and treat AD.

Both APP and PS-1 are transmembrane proteins, and their intracellular localization is controlled by secretory and endocytic pathways. These proteins are modified in the endoplasmic reticulum and trafficked to the cell surface through the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Then, they are internalized again and trafficked to early endosomes. Next, they are trafficked to late endosomes and lysosomes (LEL), which are recycling endosomes that are targeted to the cell surface or the TGN (7.Pasternak S.H. Bagshaw R.D. Guiral M. Zhang S.

The production of Aβ seems to occur in a broad range of cellular compartments including the cell surface, TGN, and endosomes (12.De Strooper B. Annaert W. J.

It has been suggested that inflammation is important in the pathogenesis of AD; chronic inflammation has been observed in the brains of AD patients, and trauma to the brain and ischemia, both of which can activate inflammation, are major risk factors for AD (17.Townsend K.P.

Cyclooxygenase (COX) is essential for the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a potent inducer of inflammation and has two subtypes, COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is expressed constitutively, whereas expression of COX-2 is induced under inflammatory conditions and is responsible for the progression of inflammation (20.Vane J.

The following evidences of the involvement of PGE2 (and COX-2) in the progression of AD suggest that they are good targets for the development of AD drugs: (i) Elevated levels of PGE2 and overexpression of COX-2 have been observed in the brains of AD patients (23.Kitamura Y.

We recently reported that PGE2 stimulates the production of Aβ in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 and human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells that stably express a form of APP with two mutations (K651N/M652L) (APPsw) that elevate cellular and secreted levels of Aβ (30.Hoshino T.

Using agonists and antagonists specific for each of the four PGE2 receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4), we found that EP4 receptors alone and also both EP2 and EP4 receptors are involved in PGE2-stimulated production of Aβ in HEK293 or SH-SY5Y cells, respectively (30.Hoshino T. Nakaya T. Homan T. Tanaka K. Sugimoto Y. Araki W. Narita M. Narumiya S. Suzuki T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32676-32688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, experiments with transgenic mice suggest that EP2 and EP4 receptors are involved in the production of Aβ in vivo (30.Hoshino T. Nakaya T. Homan T. Tanaka K. Sugimoto Y. Araki W. Narita M. Narumiya S. Suzuki T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32676-32688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we propose that antagonists of the EP2 and/or EP4 receptors may be therapeutically beneficial for the treatment of AD. Understanding the mechanism governing EP2 and EP4 receptor-mediated stimulation of production of Aβ by PGE2 will be important for such drug development. Activation of EP2 and EP4 receptors causes activation of adenylate cyclase and an increase in the cellular level of cAMP (32.Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that an EP4 receptor agonist or both EP2 and EP4 receptor agonists increase the cellular level of cAMP in HEK293 or SH-SY5Y cells, respectively, and that a cAMP analogue, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (pCPT-cAMP), increases the level of Aβ in HEK293 cells (30.Hoshino T. Nakaya T. Homan T. Tanaka K. Sugimoto Y. Araki W. Narita M. Narumiya S. Suzuki T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32676-32688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the cellular level of cAMP is important for PGE2-stimulated production of Aβ. An increase in the cellular level of cAMP is known to activate protein kinase A (PKA), which is important for cAMP-regulated intracellular signal transduction (33.Regan J.W. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). However, an inhibitor of PKA, N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinoline-sulfonamide (H-89), does not block PGE2-stimulated production of Aβ in HEK293 cells (30.Hoshino T. Nakaya T. Homan T.

Other cAMP-regulated signal transduction factors, such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Epac (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP), were also shown not to be involved in PGE2-stimulated production of Aβ in HEK293 cells (30.Hoshino T. Nakaya T. Homan T. Tanaka K. Sugimoto Y. Araki W. Narita M. Narumiya S. Suzuki T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32676-32688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism whereby the activation of EP2 and EP4 receptors stimulates the production of Aβ has remained unknown. In this study, by using inhibitors of adenylate cyclase and PKA, we found that activation of the EP2 receptor stimulates production of Aβ through activation of adenylate cyclase and PKA. We also propose that activation of the EP4 receptor causes its co-internalization with PS-1 (γ-secretase) into endosomes and that this co-internalization is important for EP4 receptor-mediated stimulation of Aβ production by PGE2 through the activation of γ-secretase.

The experiments and procedures described here were carried out in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as adopted and promulgated by the National Institute of Health and were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Kumamoto University. HEK293, SH-SY5Y, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells were cultured in DMEM, DMEM/Ham-F12, and Ham-F12 medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells expressing APPsw were from our laboratory stocks (35.Hoshino T. Nakaya T. Araki W. Suzuki K. Suzuki T. Mizushima T. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells were from the RIKEN BioResource Center. For transient expression, cells were seeded 24 h before transfection in 24-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well. Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine (TM2000) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were used for experiments after a 24-h recovery period. Transfection efficiency was determined in parallel plates by transfection of cells with pEGFP-N1 control vector. Transfection efficiencies were greater than 90% in all experiments. The stable transfectants expressing each gene were selected by immunoblotting or real-time reverse transcription-PCR analyses. Positive clones were maintained in the presence of 200 μg/ml G418. Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (36.Hoshino T. Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Hwang H.J. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Biol.

The protein concentration of each sample was determined by the Bradford method (38.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). Samples were applied to polyacrylamide-SDS gels (Tris-Tricine gel for the detection of CTFα and CTFβ or Tris-glycine gel for other proteins) and subjected to electrophoresis, after which proteins were immunoblotted with each antibody. Cells were cultured for 24 h, and the conditioned medium was subjected to a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using three types of specific monoclonal antibodies as described previously (35.Hoshino T.

Solubilized membranes were incubated overnight at 37 °C in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) buffer containing 2 mm EDTA, 0.25% CHAPSO (w/v), and 10 μm fluorescent substrate of γ-secretase or were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 200 μl of 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 4.1) containing 100 mm sodium chloride, 0.025% bovine serum albumin, and 10 μm fluorescent β-secretase substrate. We measured fluorescence using a plate reader (Fluostar Galaxy) with an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and an emission wavelength of 440 nm (for the γ-secretase) or 510 nm (for the β-secretase). We used siRNA with the sequence 5′-gcugggaaaacucuucagadTdT-3′ and 5′- ucugaagaguuuucccagcdTdT-3′, 5′- gcaagcaaguccuaacauudTdT-3′ and 5′-aauguuaggacuugcuugcdTdT-3′, or 5′-cgguuccagucucucggugdAdG-3′and 5′-caccgagagacuggaaccgdAdT-3′ as annealed oligonucleotides for repressing clathrin, Rab5, or Rab7 expression, respectively. Cells were transfected with siRNA using HiPerFect transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Non-silencing siRNA (5′-uucuccgaacgugucacgudTdT-3′and 5′-acgugacacguucggagaadTdT-3′) was used as a negative control. Cells or mouse brain sections were incubated with antibody against each protein for 30 min before (for HA or EP4) or after (for PS-1 and Rab7) treatment with PGE2. Samples were fixed and incubated with the respective secondary antibody. We acquired images with a confocal fluorescence microscope (Olympus FV500). Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously (35.Hoshino T. Nakaya T. Araki W. Suzuki K. Suzuki T. Mizushima T. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Cells were harvested, lysed with buffer containing 1% CHAPSO, and centrifuged. The antibody against HA or EP4 was added to the supernatant, and the samples were incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with rotation. Dynabeads-Protein G was added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. Beads were washed four times, and the proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. This assay was carried out as described previously (42.Gardner L.A. Delos Santos N.M. Matta S.G. Whitt M.A. Bahouth S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21135-21143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Proteins on the cell surface were biotinylated with a reversible membrane-impermeable derivative of biotin (sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin). Internalization of proteins was allowed to occur by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. The remaining cell surface biotin was cleaved by glutathione, and the cells were lysed. Biotinylated proteins were precipitated using UltraLink immobilized Neutravidin beads and eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. All values are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Two-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey test or the Student's t test for unpaired results was used to evaluate differences between more than three groups or between two groups, respectively. Differences were considered to be significant for values of p < 0.05. Although primary neurons should be used for this type of experiments, we used an immortalized cell line in this study, because we used stable and transient transfection for the experiments in this study (see below). We confirmed our previous results that H-89 did not block PGE2-stimulated production of Aβ in HEK293 cells and found that an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, SQ22536, also did not block this stimulation (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B), suggesting that an increase in the cellular level of cAMP is not involved in PGE2-stimulated production of Aβ in HEK293 cells. In contrast, in SH-SY5Y cells, both H-89 and SQ22536 decreased the level of Aβ in the presence, but not in the absence, of PGE2 (supplemental Fig. S1, C and D). These inhibitors at the concentrations used did not affect cell viability (data not shown). Therefore, the results shown in Fig. 1, C and D, suggest that an increase in the cellular level of cAMP and the resulting activation of PKA are involved in PGE2-stimulated production of Aβ in SH-SY5Y cells. In a previous report (30.Hoshino T. Nakaya T. Homan T. Tanaka K. Sugimoto Y. Araki W. Narita M. Narumiya S. Suzuki T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32676-32688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we used HEK293 cells that express only APPsw stably. In the current study, we used CHO and HEK293 cells that express each EP receptor transiently in addition to the stable expression of APPsw (see below). For these types of cells, 10 nm PGE2, which had been used for experiments in the previous study (30.Hoshino T. Nakaya T. Homan T. Tanaka K. Sugimoto Y. Araki W. Narita M. Narumiya S. Suzuki T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32676-32688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), was not enough to stimulate the production of Aβ clearly (supplemental Figs. S7–S10), and thus we used 1 μm PGE2 in all experiments described in this article. As the EP2 receptor is involved in PGE2-stimulated production of Aβ in SH-SY5Y but not in HEK293 cells (30.Hoshino T. Nakaya T. Homan T. Tanaka K. Sugimoto Y. Araki W. Narita M. Narumiya S. Suzuki T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32676-32688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the results shown in supplemental Fig. S1 suggest that the increase in the cellular level of cAMP and resulting activation of PKA contributes to EP2 receptor-dependent (but not EP4 receptor-dependent) stimulation of Aβ production by PGE2. To confirm this proposition, we examined the effects of these inhibitors on the production of Aβ in CHO cells artificially expressing APPsw and EP2 or EP4 receptor tagged with HA. Lack of functional endogenous EP2 and EP4 receptors in cells has been reported previously (43.Bastepe M. Ashby B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Expression of these receptors was confirmed by immunoblotting (data not shown) and immunostaining (Fig. 3A). Both H-89 and SQ22536 suppressed PGE2-stimulated production of Aβ in cells expressing the EP2 receptor but not in cells expressing the EP4 receptor (supplemental Fig. S2, A–D), supporting our theory described above. We reported previously that treatment of HEK293 cells with PGE2 increases γ-secretase activity in extracts of these cells (30.Hoshino T. Nakaya T. Homan T. Tanaka K. Sugimoto Y. Araki W. Narita M. Narumiya S. Suzuki T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32676-32688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here we found that PGE2 treatment increased γ-secretase activity in extracts prepared from CHO cells expressing the EP4 receptor but not in cells expressing the EP2 receptor and that it did not affect β-secretase activity in either of these cell types (supplemental Fig. S2, E and F). Furthermore, pCPT-cAMP did not affect γ-secretase activity in HEK293 cells (data not shown). On the other hand, treatment of cells with PGE2 did not affect the expression of γ-secretase (PS-1-NTF) (supplemental Fig. S3). These results suggest that the EP2 receptor mediates PGE2-stimulated production of Aβ through activation of cAMP and PKA without an increase in β- and γ-secretase activity and that the EP4 receptor mediates PGE2-stimulated Aβ production through different mechanisms, which involve an activation rather than induction of expression of γ-secretase. Agonist-dependent internalization (endocytosis) of the EP4 receptor (but not the"

Development of TLR antagonists is recognized as a promising direction in suppressing the associated inflammatory reactions of the TLRs. Aptamers are single-stranded RNA or DNA molecules isolated through an in vitro selection process. Using a novel molecular evolution strategy that combines immunoprecipitation (IP) with systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), we developed an IP-SELEX selection method to facilitate the screening of high-affinity aptamers for the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). Also, human TLR2 functional aptamers were identified and characterized using NF-ΚB reporter assays. Among the functional aptamers, the most effective, AP177, with a dissociation constant of 73 pM, was characterized with TLR2-expressing cells challenged with bacterial cells and purified ligands. The aptamer could effectively antagonize TLR2, significantly inhibit NF-ΚB activity, and suppress the secretion of the cytokines by >80%. In addition, the precise region within the functional aptamer that specifically bound TLR2 was resolved using aptamer microarray analysis. The results of functional assays showed that AP177 acted as a TLR2 antagonist and may hold therapeutic potential in the treatment of diseases related to dysregulated TLR2 immune responses.—Chang, Y.-C., Kao, W.-C., Wang, W.-Y., Wang, W.-Y., Yang, R.-B., Peck, K Identification and characterization of oligonucleotides that inhibit Toll-like receptor 2-associated immune responses.

The Rembrandt basin is comparable in age to the Caloris basin, is partially flooded by volcanic plains, and displays a unique wheel-and-spoke-like pattern of basin-radial and basin-concentric wrinkle ridges and graben. Stratigraphic relations indicate a multistaged infilling and deformational history involving successive or overlapping phases of contractional and extensional deformation.

https://openalex.org/W1987038702,"TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a member of the TNF family that participates in HIV-1 pathogenesis through the depletion of CD4+ T cells. TRAIL is expressed on the cell membrane of peripheral immune cells and can be cleaved into a soluble, secreted form. The regulation of TRAIL in macrophages during HIV-1 infection is not completely understood. In this study, we investigated the mechanism(s) of TRAIL expression in HIV-1-infected macrophages, an important cell type in HIV-1 pathogenesis. A human monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) culture system was infected with macrophage-tropic HIV-1(ADA), HIV-1(JR-FL), or HIV-1(BAL) strains. TRAIL, predominantly the membrane-bound form, increased following HIV-1 infection. We found that HIV-1 infection also induced interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1, IRF-7 gene expression and signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) activation. Small interfering RNA knockdown of IRF-1 or IRF-7, but not IRF-3, reduced STAT1 activation and TRAIL expression. Furthermore, the upregulation of IRF-1, IRF-7, TRAIL, and the activation of STAT1 by HIV-1 infection was reduced by the treatment of type I interferon (IFN)-neutralizing antibodies. In addition, inhibition of STAT1 by fludarabine abolished IRF-1, IRF-7, and TRAIL upregulation. We conclude that IRF-1, IRF-7, type I IFNs, and STAT1 form a signaling feedback loop that is critical in regulating TRAIL expression in HIV-1-infected macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1997714685,"Endothelial cell (EC) senescence and dysfunction occurring after chronic injury and inflammation are highly associated with the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases. However, the factors involved in the establishment of EC senescence remain poorly understood. We have previously shown that lithium, an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta and activator of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, induces an EC senescent-like phenotype. Herein, we show that lithium induces a rapid and pronounced up-regulation of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, an inflammation and senescent cell marker, at the mRNA and protein levels, whereas the induction of two other senescent cell markers is either weak (interleukin-8) or delayed (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1). Lithium effect on MMP-1 expression is also specific among other MMPs and not mediated by GSK3beta inhibition. Lithium affects MMP-1 expression mainly at the transcriptional level but neither the AP1/Ets regulatory sites nor the redox sensitive (-1607/2G) site in MMP-1 promoter are involved in lithium-dependent MMP-1 regulation. However, down-regulation of p53, a target of lithium in EC, dampens both basal and lithium-induced MMP-1 expression, which further links MMP-1 up-regulation with the establishment of cell senescence. Although increased MMP-1 levels are usually associated with angiogenesis in enabled proliferative EC, the exogenous addition of activated MMP-1 on lithium- arrested EC increases the number of EC positive for the senescent-associated-beta-galactosidase marker. Conversely, down-regulation of MMP-1 expression by small interfering RNAs blunts the lithium-dependent increase in senescent-associated-beta-galactosidase positive cells. Altogether our data indicate that lithium-induced MMP-1 may participate in the reinforcement of EC senescence and reveal a novel mechanism for lithium-induced tissue remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2137946094,"Very long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFAs), such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), have recently made it to the realm of ""magical molecules"" based on their multiple presumably beneficial effects in biological systems, making these PUFAs particularly interesting in biomedicine. Their specific biological functions, however, remain enigmatic. Here we provide evidence derived from studies in the amoeba Chaos that indicates a structural role for omega-6 DPA in cell membrane organization, which may help to explain the multiple diverse effects of VLC-PUFA in healthy and diseased states. Amoeba Chaos mitochondria undergo a remarkable and reversible morphological transition into cubic morphology on starvation. This morphological transition is reflected in major changes in fatty acid and lipid composition, as determined by gas liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, in particular by a drastic increase in C22:5 modified phosphatidylcholine plasmalogen, phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogen, and phosphatidylinositol species. Liposomes produced in vitro from lipids of starved amoeba cells show a high propensity to form hexagonal tubular and cubic morphologies. Addition of omega-6 DPA, but not of omega-3 DPA, to the cell culture also induced mitochondrial membrane transformation into cubic morphology in fed cells, demonstrating for the first time an important structural role of omega-6 DPA-containing lipids in cell membrane organization."
https://openalex.org/W2149860500,"Engineered overexpression of protein kinase Cα (PKCα) was previously shown to endow nonmotile MCF-10A human breast cells with aggressive motility. A traceable mutant of PKCα (Abeyweera, T. P., and Rotenberg, S. A. (2007) Biochemistry 46, 2364–2370) revealed that α6-tubulin is phosphorylated in cells expressing traceable PKCα and in vitro by wild type PKCα. Gain-of-function, single site mutations (Ser → Asp) were constructed at each PKC consensus site in α6-tubulin (Ser158, Ser165, Ser241, and Thr337) to simulate phosphorylation. Following expression of each construct in MCF-10A cells, motility assays identified Ser165 as the only site in α6-tubulin whose pseudophosphorylation reproduced the motile behavior engendered by PKCα. Expression of a phosphorylation-resistant mutant (S165N-α6-tubulin) resulted in suppression of MCF-10A cell motility stimulated either by expression of PKCα or by treatment with PKCα-selective activator diacylglycerol-lactone. MCF-10A cells treated with diacylglycerol-lactone showed strong phosphorylation of endogenous α-tubulin that could be blocked when S165N-α6-tubulin was expressed. The S165N mutant also inhibited intrinsically motile human breast tumor cells that express high endogenous PKCα levels (MDA-MB-231 cells) or lack PKCα and other conventional isoforms (MDA-MB-468 cells). Comparison of Myc-tagged wild type α6-tubulin and S165N-α6-tubulin expressed in MDA-MB-468 cells demonstrated that Ser165 is also a major site of phosphorylation for endogenously active, nonconventional PKC isoforms. PKC-stimulated motility of MCF-10A cells was nocodazole-sensitive, thereby implicating microtubule elongation in the mechanism. These findings support a model in which PKC phosphorylates α-tubulin at Ser165, leading to microtubule elongation and motility.

For many years, attention has been focused on protein kinase Cα (PKCα) 3The abbreviations used are: PKCprotein kinase CWTwild typeVCvector controlGFPgreen fluorescent proteinDAGdiacylglycerolGSTglutathione S-transferaseBIMbis-indoleylmaleimideEGFepidermal growth factorPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. as an upstream element of signaling pathways governing cell adhesion and migration of cancer cells. In light of the role of this PKC isoform in cytoskeletal events that drive the metastatic phenotype (1Larsson C. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), identification of its protein substrates would offer attractive targets for design of anti-metastasis drugs. Despite the large number of PKC substrates that undergo phosphorylation in vitro, there is at present a short list of proteins that have been demonstrated to serve as intracellular PKC substrates. These substrates have been found to associate with the actin cytoskeleton and cell-cell contacts (2Jaken S. Parker P.J. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 3Rabinovitz I. Tsomo L. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 4351-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).

The MCF-10A cell line provides a valuable model for probing PKCα-specific pathways in human breast cells. This nontransformed, nontumorigenic cell line expresses very low levels of PKCα and therefore offers a low background for experiments seeking to correlate overexpression of PKCα with its phenotypic consequences. Of the diacylglycerol (DAG)-sensitive isoforms expressed in these cells, PKCα is the only Ca2+/DAG-dependent (conventional) isoform. This laboratory previously reported that stable overexpression of PKCα endowed these nonmotile cells with a high level of motility, decreased proliferation, loss of E-cadherin expression, and altered cell morphology (4Sun X.G. Rotenberg S.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 343-352PubMed Google Scholar). A distinct advantage of MCF-10A cells is that following engineered overexpression of PKCα, they require no treatment with PKC activators (such as DAG or the tumor promoter tetradecanoyl-12,13-phorbol acetate) in order to observe PKCα-related phenotypes (4Sun X.G. Rotenberg S.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 343-352PubMed Google Scholar). This condition is related to the MCF-10A cell environment, since previous use of the same PKCα-encoding plasmid with NIH 3T3 cells did not give rise to a constitutively active protein (5Goodnight J.A. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9991-10001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The probable source of this activation is the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in the culture medium, a requirement for MCF-10A cell growth. Following its expression, recombinant PKCα is activated by EGF-induced levels of intracellular DAG and Ca2+, resulting in motile behavior. In parental MCF-10A cells, which are only weakly motile, endogenous PKC activity is apparently unresponsive to extracellular EGF. However, treatment of MCF-10A cells with a cell-permeable and PKCα-selective DAG-lactone produces dramatic motility (6Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Leskow F.C. Fuji T. Wang Q. Blumberg P.M. Ohba M. Kurok T.

These observations suggest that nonmotile MCF-10A cells express an inhibitor of endogenous PKC that prevents its activation by (EGF-generated) DAG but that can be either displaced by micromolar concentrations of DAG-lactone or titrated by high dosage expression of recombinant PKCα. An alternative but less probable scenario is that the engineered overexpression of PKCα results in formation of the constitutively active 50-kDa catalytic fragment. However, our previous studies argue against this possibility (4Sun X.G. Rotenberg S.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 343-352PubMed Google Scholar). First, in MCF-10A cells expressing the recombinant PKCα, the 80-kDa protein was observed to translocate to the membrane fraction, thus signifying endogenous activation of the intact enzyme. Second, calphostin C, a PKC inhibitor that binds the DAG binding site in the regulatory domain and therefore requires the intact enzyme for inhibition of catalytic activity, was observed to block PKCα-induced motility of MCF-10A cells. The idea that cancer-related phenotypes of MCF-10A cells arise from aberrant EGF-mediated signaling is further supported by evidence that many PKC-driven phenotypes of this cell line (including motility) can be recapitulated by ErbB-2 overexpression (8Yu B.W. Bowers M. Witkowski G. Huang M. Ramachandran S. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2002; 76: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 9Simpson K.J. Selfors L.M. Bui J. Reynolds A. Leake D. Khvorova A. Brugge J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). This EGF receptor-related oncogene is frequently overexpressed in breast tumors and is thought to act through PKCα to engender breast cancer invasiveness (10Tan M. Li P. Sun M. Yin G. Yu D. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because the MCF-10A cell line exhibits a low background of endogenous PKCα activity, it offers a substrate-rich environment in which to screen and identify protein substrates that mediate PKCα-induced phenotypes. Any candidate substrate can be subsequently validated as a PKC target in human breast tumor cells or other cancer cells. Until recently, identification of PKCα substrates was not possible due to the inherent difficulties of linking a phosphoprotein directly to the specific protein kinase that produced it. Initially developed by the Shokat laboratory (11Shah K. Liu Y. Deirmengian C. Shokat K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3565-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 12Ting A.Y.

This method entails site-directed mutagenesis at the ATP binding domain in the vicinity of the adenosine N6-amino group of bound ATP. Mutation at this site replaces an amino acid residue bearing a long aliphatic side chain (e.g. methionine) with a residue containing a shorter side chain, such as alanine, thereby removing steric hindrance near the N6-amino group. This mutant productively binds a bulky analogue of ATP that is derivatized at the N6-amino group (e.g. N6-phenyl-ATP). Phosphoproteins that are produced when the ATP analogue is added to cell lysates containing the mutant protein kinase are the result of the mutant activity. Guided by the x-ray crystal structure of cAMP-dependent protein kinase that contained bound ATP, this laboratory recently developed a traceable mutant of PKCα (18Abeyweera T.P. Rotenberg S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2364-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This mutant (M417A-PKCα) was effective in identifying proteins already known to be PKC substrates and in promoting the motility phenotype in MCF-10A cells that was previously ascribed to wild type PKCα (4Sun X.G. Rotenberg S.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 343-352PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, the potential of the traceable kinase method is fully realized. Phosphoproteins identified as substrates of M417A-PKCα led us to discover α6-tubulin as a new PKCα substrate in MCF-10A cells. Because heterodimers of α- and β-tubulin are the building blocks of microtubules whose assembly dynamics are critical during cell movement, we hypothesized that its phosphorylation by PKCα engenders motile behavior. By use of gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutants, our results implicate a single site in α6-tubulin whose phosphorylation by PKCα reproduces the motility phenotype of MCF-10A cells that was previously ascribed to PKCα. Cell culture serum, growth factors, media, DNA sequencing primers, Alexa fluor antibodies, and pcDNA3.1 vector were purchased from Invitrogen. The QuikChange mutagenesis kit and pCMV4 vector were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). A plasmid encoding α6-tubulin was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). All restriction enzymes were acquired from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Phosphoserine protein phosphatase inhibitor mixture, protease inhibitors, saponin, nocodazole, and α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (DM1A) were purchased from Sigma. bis-Indoleylmaleimide-1 (BIM) was purchased from EMD-Calbiochem. Rabbit polyclonal α-tubulin antibody (E-19), Protein A/G-agarose beads, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, mouse IgG-agarose, and radioimmune precipitation buffer were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Fugene 6 was acquired from Roche Applied Science; Gelcode Blue and chemiluminescence reagents (Supersignal West Pico) were purchased from Pierce; Duracryl was obtained from NextGen Sciences (Ann Arbor, MI); and Immobilon-P transfer membranes and mouse monoclonal anti-Myc were purchased from Millipore Corp.

(Taiwan), GST-PKCα and the antibody recognizing phosphorylated PKC substrates were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), and GST-Mu protein standard was purchased from Alpha Diagnostic International, Inc. (San Antonio, TX). Radiochemicals were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. cDNA encoding human α6-tubulin was subcloned into the pCMV4 vector at BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. Expression from this vector produced a protein that was FLAG-tagged at the COOH terminus. Substitution of either Asp or Asn codons (underlined) was carried out by the QuikChange method. The following primers were used to produce the mutations at Ser165: 5′-CGT CTC TCA GTT GAT TAT GGC AAG AAG GAC AAG CTG GAG TTC TCC-3′ for S165D and 5′-CGT CTC TCA GTT GAT TAT GGC AAG AAG AAC AAG CTG GAG TTC TCC-3′ for S165N. To produce S158D, S241D, and T337D, the following primers were used: 5′-GAA CGT CTC GAC GTT GAT TAT GGC AAG AAG TCC AAG CTG GAG-3′ for S158D, 5′-GTG TCC TCC ATC ACT GCT GAC CTG AGA TTT GAT GGA GC-3′ for S241D, and 5′-GCC ATT GCC ACC ATC AAA GAC AAG CGT ACC ATC CAG-3′ for T337D. To verify the presence of each site-specific mutation, DNA sequence analysis of the entire open reading frame was performed (Macrogen (Seoul, Korea)). Myc fusion proteins were constructed for the wild type (WT) α6-tubulin and for the S165D and S165N mutants of α6-tubulin by subcloning the cDNA from the corresponding pCMV4 construct into a pcDNA3.1/Myc-His A vector at BamHI and XbaI sites. The sequence of the entire open reading frame was verified for each construct (Macrogen, Rockville, MD). Upon expression, the Myc tag sequence was conferred at the carboxyl terminus. High level expression of the 50-kDa Myc-tagged fusion proteins in MCF-10A cells was verified by Western blot with rabbit polyclonal Myc antibody (Millipore Corp.). Using a standard PCR-based approach, humanized Renilla reniformis green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Stratagene) was fused at the 5′-end of α6-tubulin cDNA (wild type or mutant) via a six-Gly linker. The fusion construct was inserted into a pCMV4 vector at SacII and XhoI restriction sites. The sequence of the entire open reading frame was verified for each construct (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea). Midpassage MCF-10A human breast epithelial cells (19Soule H.D. Maloney T.M. Wolman S.R. Peterson Jr., W.D. Brenz R. McGrath C.M. Russo J. Pauley R.J. Jones R.F. Brooks S.C. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6075-6086PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute (Detroit, MI). MCF-10A cells were cultured on 10-cm plates (Falcon), as previously described (4Sun X.G. Rotenberg S.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 343-352PubMed Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics (1% penicillin/streptomycin and 0.5 μg/ml fungizone). MDA-MB-468 cells were cultured in RPMI containing glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics. Transient transfection of cells was carried out with 4 μg of cDNA complexed with Fugene 6 for 6 h in serum-free medium, followed by the addition of serum and incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After 48 h, the cells were harvested. Based on an experiment with a GFP-encoding vector, the efficiency of transfection was typically 70% or higher. The cells were applied to a 10-well slide through a 10-hole manifold (CSM, Inc., Phoenix, AZ) that restricts sedimentation of cells to a small, circumscribed area. Upon removal of the manifold, the cells radiated outwardly over an 8-h period. Cell motility was analyzed by a digital camera (Moticam 2000) attached to a computer and an inverted Nikon Diaphot microscope. The extent of movement was determined by measuring the change in total area (in μm2) occupied by the cells using Motic Images Plus 2.0 software. Between measurements, cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. In experiments employing DAG-lactone or nocodazole, the reagent (or 0.1% (v/v) DMSO as vehicle control) was added immediately after the removal of the manifold (t = 0) and was present for the duration of the assay. Each reported value is the average of triplicate measurements with the corresponding standard deviation value (S.D.). Transfected MCF-10A cells were treated for 5 min with saponin (50 μg/ml) in isotonic sucrose buffer (130 mm sucrose, 30 mm potassium chloride, 30 mm potassium acetate, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm calcium chloride, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing phosphoserine phosphatase inhibitors, followed by the addition of [γ-32P]N6-phenyl-ATP to a final concentration of 100 μm (∼800 cpm/pmol). The synthesis of this reagent has been described elsewhere (18Abeyweera T.P. Rotenberg S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2364-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with occasional mixing for 1 h at 30 °C and pelleted by centrifugation. The cell pellet was lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 8000 × g, and the resulting supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation with α-tubulin antibody and protein A/G-agarose, as described below. The immunopellet was treated with Laemmli sample buffer and heated for 5 min at 95 °C prior to performing 8% SDS-PAGE. MCF-10A cells were harvested and dissociated by trypsinization, followed by two washes with complete medium and a final wash with serum-free medium. Prior to lysis, the cells were resuspended and transferred to a new Eppendorf tube. These steps facilitated cell dissociation and disruption and proved superior to simple cell scraping. To prepare cell lysates directly for Western blot, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, protease inhibitors, and phosphatase inhibitors, as previously described (18Abeyweera T.P. Rotenberg S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2364-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of each sample was measured with a colorimetric protein reagent (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Preparation of the soluble fraction (containing cytosolic α-tubulin) was carried out as previously described (20Banan A. Smith G.S. Rieckenberg C.L. Kokoska E.R. Miller T.A. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 1998; 274: G111-G121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MCF-10A cells were harvested, pelleted by centrifugation (1000 × g for 5 min at room temperature), and lysed at room temperature for 20 min in 0.2 ml of stabilization buffer (0.1 m PIPES, pH 6.9, 30% glycerol, 5% (v/v) DMSO, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, protease inhibitor mixture, and phosphatase inhibitors), containing 1.0% Triton X-100. The addition of 10 μm BIM (a pan-PKC inhibitor) to the lysis buffer greatly decreased the background, since it prevented adventitious phosphorylation during the isolation procedure. Lysates were transferred to fresh tubes and centrifuged at 100,005 × g for 45 min at room temperature. Supernatants containing soluble tubulin (0.2 ml) were normalized for total protein (typically 200–300 μg), and the sample volumes were adjusted to 1.0 ml with radioimmune precipitation buffer. To isolate α-tubulin from each soluble fraction, immunoprecipitation was performed with monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (2 μg/ml), as described below. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were prepared from transfected cells in buffer (specified in the legends for FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 ng/ml leupeptin, 10 ng/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) and phosphoserine phosphatase inhibitors. After normalizing samples for total protein and preclearing for 30 min with rotation at 4 °C with mouse IgG-agarose, immunoprecipitation with rotation was carried out at 4 °C with the specified antibody, followed by treatment with protein A/G-agarose for 1 h. Immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation at 800 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. Pellets were washed three times with resuspension in 0.5 ml of detergent-free intraperitoneal buffer and rotated at 4 °C for 5 min and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min.FIGURE 4Phosphorylation-resistant α6-tubulin mutant (S165N) inhibits motility of human breast tumor cells. A, dominant-negative effect on motility following expression of GFP-(S165N)-α6-tubulin (4 μg of plasmid) in human breast tumor cell lines that express very high levels of PKCα (MDA-MB-231) or none at all (MDA-MB-468). Each value is the average of triplicate measurements ± S.D., and the results are representative of three independent experiments. P, parental cells. B, phosphorylation of Myc-tagged α6-tubulin reporter constructs in MDA-MB-468 cells. Cells were transfected for 48 h with 4 μg of plasmid encoding the Myc-tagged WT α6-tubulin, S165N mutant, or VC. Where indicated, cells were treated with either 1 μm BIM or DMSO (0.1%, v/v) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min prior to cell lysis. Whole cell lysates were prepared in 0.2 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μm BIM, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. After normalizing for total protein content (550 μg), lysates were diluted 5-fold in detergent-free buffer, followed by preclearing with mouse IgG-agarose and immunoprecipitation with 5 μg of mouse anti-Myc (6 h with rotation, 4 °C). Myc-tagged α6-tubulin (50 kDa band) was detected in a Western blot that was probed sequentially with rabbit anti-phospho-PKC substrates (1:500) and rabbit anti-Myc (1:1000). The results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Samples of known protein concentration were denatured in sample buffer, as previously described (18Abeyweera T.P. Rotenberg S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2364-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE on Duracryl followed by electrophoretic transfer to a 15 × 15-cm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P), and blocked in 5% powdered milk. An immunochemical assay was carried out with primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antisera and detected by chemiluminescence. To carry out phosphorylation in vitro, 1 μg each of highly pure recombinant GST-α6-tubulin (Abnova Corp.) and GST-PKCα (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) were combined in a reaction medium containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm Ca2+, phosphatidylserine (0.1 mg/ml), and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Following the addition of 50 μm ATP or [γ-32P]ATP (∼200 cpm/pmol), the reaction was carried out for 30 min at 30 °C. Each reaction was quenched by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer and heated for 5 min at 95 °C prior to performing 6% SDS-PAGE and staining with Gelcode Blue. Samples to be used for mass spectrometry were resolved on a 6% SDS-PAGE gel having a thickness of 0.75 mm. Identification of α6-tubulin was performed at the Keck Foundation Mass Spectrometry Resource Laboratory at Yale Cancer Center. Gel-resolved proteins were digested in situ with trypsin (Promega) and batch-purified on a reversed-phase microtip, and resulting peptide pools were individually analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry on a Waters Q-TOF mass spectrometer, as previously described (18Abeyweera T.P. Rotenberg S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2364-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). All tandem mass spectrometry spectra were searched using the automated MASCOT algorithm. Identification required that two or more spectra matched the same protein entry in the data base. Identification of α6-tubulin was initially suggested by its co-immunoprecipitation with M417A-PKCα from MCF-10A cell lysates. This traceable mutant of PKCα was expressed as a FLAG-tagged product and immunoprecipitated from detergent-free cell lysates with FLAG antibody in order to “pull down” any high affinity substrate proteins bound to it. Reaction of each immunopellet with [γ-32P]phenyl-ATP produced several 32P-labeled products that were resolved by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. In a typical experiment (18Abeyweera T.P. Rotenberg S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2364-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), a strong band at 50–55 kDa was produced by M417A-PKCα but was absent in the banding patterns observed with either WT PKCα or the vector control. The finding of radiolabeled bands unique to the traceable kinase of PKCα indicated that these proteins were potential substrates. When analyzed by mass spectrometry, the 50–55 kDa band was found to contain α6-tubulin. Whether α6-tubulin was indeed phosphorylated remained to be demonstrated. In view of the well established importance of microtubules to the mechanics of cell movement, the novel possibility that α6-tubulin serves as a direct PKCα substrate in the intact cell environment was further investigated. To establish that PKCα directly phosphorylates α6-tubulin, a reaction was performed in vitro with recombinant human GST-α6-tubulin, recombinant human GST-PKCα, and [γ-32P]ATP, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The GST-α6-tubulin protein (75-kDa) used for this analysis was produced in a eukaryotic system (wheat germ cell-free system) that ensured that the recombinant protein was properly folded. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1A, substantial incorporation of 32P into α6-tubulin protein could be demonstrated by autoradiography. Gelcode Blue staining revealed that, relative to untreated α6-tubulin, the phosphoprotein had a detectably higher molecular mass. A control experiment (not shown) performed in vitro with pure, recombinant GST protein (GST-Mu) verified that this tag was not a substrate for PKCα. To demonstrate that α6-tubulin is also phosphorylated by PKCα in intact MCF-10A cells, endogenous α-tubulin was subjected to an intracellular reaction with the traceable mutant of PKCα (M417A-PKCα) in the presence of [γ-32P]phenyl-ATP. In cells expressing M417A-PKCα, the reaction was initiated by permeabilizing the cells with saponin so as to facilitate entry of 100 μm [γ-32P]phenyl-ATP (21Hudder A. Nathanson L. Deutscher M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9318-9326Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This ATP analogue was expected to bind preferentially to the mutant PKCα in the presence of endogenous ATP, since the mutant exhibits a 10-fold lower affinity for natural ATP (18Abeyweera T.P. Rotenberg S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2364-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Following a 30-min intracellular reaction, lysates were prepared, and α-tubulin was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody. In the autoradiogram shown in Fig. 1B, it was observed that α-tubulin underwent radiolabeling in intact cells expressing M417A-PKCα, in contrast with cells that received only the control vector. The primary sequence of human α6-tubulin 4The amino acid sequence for human α6-tubulin can be accessed through NCBI protein data base under NCBI accession number AAH04949 (54Mammalian Gene Collection Program TeamProc.

Using the 832/13 rat insulinoma cell line, we demonstrate using RNA interference and chromatin immunoprecipitation that carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP), hepatic nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha), and the coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP) are required for the glucose response of the L-PK gene and are recruited to the promoter by glucose. The cAMP agonist forskolin blocked the glucose-mediated induction of the L-PK gene in a PKA-dependent manner and blocked the recruitment of ChREBP, HNF4alpha, and CBP to the L-PK promoter, while simultaneously recruiting CBP to the cAMP-inducible gene, nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 2 (NR4A2). Overexpression of CBP, but not ChREBP, reversed the cAMP repression of the L-PK gene. In addition, CBP augmented the glucose response of the L-PK promoter. We conclude that cAMP and glucose signaling converge on a complex containing ChREBP, HNF4alpha, and CBP, and that cAMP acts by disrupting this transcriptional complex assembled by glucose-derived signals."

To improve our understanding of HIF-1 regulation by kinome, we screened a kinase-specific small interference RNA library using a hypoxia-response element (HRE) luciferase reporter assay under hypoxic conditions. This screen determined that depletion of cellular SMG-1 kinase most significantly modified cellular HIF-1 activity in hypoxia.

We subsequently discovered that SMG-1 kinase activity was activated by hypoxia, and depletion of SMG-1 up-regulated MAPK activity under low oxygen. Suppressing cellular MAPK by silencing ERK1/2 or by treatment with U0126, a MAPK inhibitor, partially blocked the escalation of HIF-1 activity resulting from SMG-1 deficiency in hypoxic cells.

Hypoxic tumor cells are resistant to apoptosis, prone to migrate to less hypoxic regions of the body (metastasis), and produce pro-angiogenic factors to stimulate neovascularization leading to tumor oxygenation and tumor growth (1Pouysségur J.

HIF-1 binds to HREs in the promoters or enhancers of target genes and activates the expression of at least 150 genes encoding proteins that regulate cell metabolism, survival, motility, basement membrane integrity, angiogenesis, hematopoiesis, and other functions (4Keith B. Simon M.C. Cell. 2007; 129: 465-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). In particular, hypoxia-induced HIF-1 activation up-regulates the expression of a metastatic gene (lysyl oxidase), critical angiogenic factors (VEGF-A and Ang-2), and survival factors (carbonic anhydrase IX and XII) (1Pouysségur J. Dayan F. Mazure N.M. Nature. 2006; 441: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). Among these molecules, HIF-1α, VEGF, and carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9) proteins are clinical biomarkers for hypoxia (5Bristow R.G. Hill R.P. Nat. Rev.

The phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family of high molecular mass signaling proteins comprises ATM, ATR, DNA-PKcs, mTOR, and SMG-1. PIKKs are serine-threonine kinases and mediate cellular reaction to a variety of stresses, including genome and RNA surveillance and accessibility of nutrients (8Abraham R.T. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 9Abraham R.T. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Cell. 2004; 118: 9-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Among them, SMG-1 is the newest and least studied member of the PIKKs, and was first recognized for its role in regulating nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, a cellular surveillance mechanism that degrades mRNA transcripts containing premature translation termination codons (11Denning G.

Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). So far, SMG-1 is known for responding to different cellular stresses. For example, like the genotoxic stress-responsive kinases, ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs that SMG-1 closely resembles, SMG-1 is activated by DNA damage and phosphorylates p53 during genotoxic stress (14Brumbaugh K.M. Otterness D.M. Geisen C. Oliveira V. Brognard J. Li X. Lejeune F. Tibbetts R.S. Maquat L.E. Abraham R.T. Mol.

Romanow W.J. Geisen C. Otterness D.M. Mercurio F. Wang H.G. Dalton W.S. Abraham R.T. J. Biol.

ATR and ATM were also indicated in the repair of hypoxia/re-oxygenation-induced DNA damage (5Bristow R.G. Hill R.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). However, the role of SMG-1 in regulating cellular response to hypoxia is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that SMG-1 was activated by hypoxia in cancer cells and consequently suppressed HIF-1α activity in part via inhibition of the MAPK pathway, thereby reducing the hypoxia-induced secretion of angiogenic factor, VEGF, and survival factor, CA9, as well as restricting the migration of hypoxic cancer cells. The human cell lines HeLa, HEK293, and SKOV-3 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% l-glutamine (Invitrogen). The siRNA library contained Smart-pool libraries (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) of 4 siRNA duplexes per gene targeting 779 protein kinases, lipid kinases, and regulatory subunits. For siRNA transfection, HeLa or SKOV-3 cells were plated in 24-well plates in complete medium. After 24 h, cells were transfected with siRNA at the final concentration of 25 nm using the Dharmafect I (Dharmacon). After a further 24 h, cells were transfected with 0.3 μg of HRE luciferase reporter plasmid (a kind gift from Dr. Navdeep S. Chandel (24Bell E.L. Klimova T.A. Eisenbart J. Schumacker P.T. Chandel N.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5737-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar)) and 0.03 μg of control TK-Renilla reference plasmid DNA using GenJet DNA in vitro transfection reagent (SignaGen Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) following the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h after siRNA transfection, Luciferase values were determined using a dual-luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Values from Firefly luciferase were normalized to control Renilla luciferase, which is under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter in the pRLTK vector. Anti-HA antibody was purchased from the core facility of The Scripps Research Institute (San Diego, CA). Anti-phospho-p70S6K (Thr-389) antibody was from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-ATM, anti-ATR, anti-mTOR, anti-DNA-PK, anti-HIF-1α, anti-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-AKT (Ser-473), and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Boston, MA). Anti-BMK1 antibody was previously described (25Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Anti-SMG-1 antibody was previously described (15Oliveira V. Romanow W.J. Geisen C. Otterness D.M. Mercurio F. Wang H.G. Dalton W.S. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13174-13184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). For immunoblotting, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (9.1 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, 1.7 mm monobasic sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg ml−1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Samples were resolved by 6 or 8% SDS-PAGE and examined by Western blotting. HEK293 cells were seeded onto a 100-mm dish and transfected with 30 μg of HA-tagged wild-type SMG-1 (HA-SMG-1-WT) (a kind gift from Dr. Robert T. Abraham and Dr. Lynne E. Maquat) or kinase-dead SMG-1 (HA-SMG-1-KD) using GenJet DNA in vitro transfection reagent (SignaGen Laboratories). After 48 h, cells were subjected to hypoxia (1% oxygen) for the indicated time, and cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. HA-tagged recombinant proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with 6 μg of anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times in lysis buffer, and once in kinase buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate). Kinase reactions were performed for 30 min at 30 °C after adding 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MnCl2, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors, 1 μg of recombinant PHAS-1, and 10 μm ATP to each sample. The kinase activity was measured using the Kinase-Glo Luminescent Kinase Assay Platform (Promega) by quantitating the amount of ATP remaining in solution following the kinase reaction. VEGF and CA9 concentrations in cell culture supernatants were measured using immunoassay kits from Pierce (Rockford, IL) and from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), respectively. In brief, HeLa cells were transfected with SMG-1 siRNA. After 24 h, the cells were starved and incubated under hypoxic conditions (1% oxygen) at 37 °C overnight. Cell culture medium (50 μl) was added to each well of a microplate precoated with anti-human VEGF or CA9 polyclonal antibody and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Each well was washed with wash buffer. For VEGF, 100 μl of biotinylated antibody was added to each well, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h. For CA9, 200 μl of carbonic anhydrase IX conjugate was added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h. After washing, streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase was added to each well, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min. Following washes, a substrate solution was added to each well. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the enzyme reaction was stopped, and the intensity was measured at 450 nm. The data were normalized using the cell number determined by methylthiazolyldiphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma). SKOV-3 cells were harvested with Trypsin/EDTA, washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and resuspended in migration buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2 mm MnCl2, 1.8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin) at a density of 106/ml. Lower chambers (Corning, NY) were filled with 600 μl of warm migration buffer containing 20 μm fibronectin (BD Biosciences) as the attractant, and the upper chambers were filled with 100 μl of the cell suspension. After 5-h incubation in the hypoxic chamber (1% oxygen) at 37 °C, cells were fixed for 30 min at room temperature in 5% glutaraldehyde prepared in phosphate-buffered saline, and stained for 30 min in 0.1% crystal violet and 2% ethanol. Non-migratory cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed by wiping with a cotton swab. The number of migratory cells was measured by counting three random fields per filter. Mean values were obtained from at least three separate experiments. To explore the role of kinases in regulating HIF-1 activity under hypoxia, we depleted kinases in tumor cells using a siRNA kinase library targeting 779 kinases and then analyzed cellular HIF-1 activity under oxygen deprivation using an HRE luciferase reporter assay. In this assay, hypoxia strongly increased HRE luciferase activity and HIF-1α protein stabilization in cells (Fig. 1A). Among the 779 kinases screened by siRNA-mediated silencing, depletion of 18 kinases significantly increased HIF-1 activity and another 10 kinases decreased HIF-1 activity under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 1B). Among these kinases, the depletion of SMG-1 impacted HIF-1 activity most significantly (Fig. 1B). SMG-1 belongs to the PIKK family of protein kinases. We found that siRNA-mediated depletion of SMG-1, but not other members of the PIKK family, ATM, ATR, DNA-PKcs, and mTOR, markedly increased the HIF-1 activity in hypoxic cancer cells (Fig. 2A). To further confirm that the increase in hypoxia-induced HIF-1 activity in SMG-1-depleted cells was directly related to an on-target effect of the siRNA, we repeated this experiment using four different siRNA duplexes to deplete cellular SMG-1 and obtained similar results (Fig. 2B). Next, we forced expression of wild-type (WT) SMG-1 and its kinase-dead (KD) mutant separately in SMG-1-depleted cell and found that forced expression of WT, but not KD SMG-1, could reverse the increased HIF-1 activity observed in hypoxic tumor cells depleted of cellular SMG-1 (Fig. 2C). These results confirmed that SMG-1 deficiency increased HIF-1 activity in hypoxia and suggested that cellular SMG-1 activity is critical in suppressing HIF-1 activation in hypoxic cancer cells.FIGURE 2Depletion of SMG-1 augmented the HIF-1 activity under hypoxic conditions. A, HeLa cells were transfected with Smart-pool siRNAs for individual members of the PIKK family or with control siRNA (Cont) as indicated. After 24 h, cells were transfected with reporter plasmids, incubated in hypoxia chamber, and analyzed for luciferase activity as described in Fig. 1. The normalized luciferase activity of control hypoxic cells was taken as 1. The protein levels of endogenous SMG-1, ATM, ATR, mTOR, and DNA-PK were detected by Western blotting using antibodies specific to each of these proteins (described under “Experimental Procedures”). B, HeLa cells were transfected with four different SMG-1 siRNA duplexes (DP1–4), Smart-pool (SP), or control (Cont) siRNAs. After 24 h, cells were transfected with reporter plasmids, incubated in the hypoxia chamber, and analyzed for luciferase activity as described above. Endogenous SGM-1 protein was detected by Western blotting using an anti-SMG-1 antibody (lower panel). C, HeLa cells were transfected with SMG-1 siRNA. After 24 h, cells were transfected with empty vector or the expression plasmids encoding HA-tagged wild-type SMG-1 (HA-SMG-1-WT) or kinase dead SMG-1 (HA-SMG-1-KD). HRE and pRL-TK luciferase reporter plasmids were also included in the transfection mixture. The luciferase activity in SMG-1-deficient cells transfected with empty vector was taken as 100%. The expression of HA-SMG-1-WT and HA-SMG-1-KD were detected by Western blotting using an anti-HA antibody (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because SMG-1 is known to be activated under various cellular stresses (14Brumbaugh K.M. Otterness D.M. Geisen C. Oliveira V. Brognard J. Li X. Lejeune F. Tibbetts R.S. Maquat L.E. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 585-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), we investigated whether SMG-1 kinase can also be activated under hypoxic stress. We expressed WT and KD SMG-1 in tumor cells followed by hypoxia treatment and found that the kinase activity of WT SMG-1, but not KD SMG-1, was substantially up-regulated for at least 18 h in response to hypoxia (Fig. 3A). To determine whether the activated SMG-1 kinase had an effect on other cellular kinase cascades, we analyzed the ERK1/2, mTOR, AKT, and BMK1 kinase pathways and found that depletion of cellular SMG-1 altered only the intensity of ERK1/2 activation, but not the other pathways, in response to hypoxia (Fig. 3B). Moreover, kinase library screen indicated that depletion of ERK1 significantly decreased the HIF-1 activity. Thus, we suspected that SMG-1 inhibited HIF-1 activity through suppression of ERK1/2 activities under hypoxic conditions. To test this, we depleted ERK1 and/or ERK2 in SMG-1-deficient cells and found that ERK1, but not ERK2, knockdown partially reduced the SMG-1 deficiency-dependent up-regulation of HIF-1 activity in hypoxic cells (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained by treating SMG-1-deficient cells with the MEK1 inhibitor, U0126 (Calbiochem), to suppress ERK1/2 activity under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3D). These results suggested that SMG-1 inhibited the HIF-1 activity through partial repression of MAPK activity in hypoxic tumor cells. Because the kinase activity of SMG-1 is up-regulated by hypoxic stress and SMG-1 inhibits HIF-1 activity during hypoxic conditions, we suspected that the kinase activity of SMG-1 played a role in controlling HIF-1-transactivating activity in hypoxic cells. We increased expression of WT or KD SMG-1 in hypoxia cancer cells and found that WT but not KD SMG-1 could block HIF-1 activity in cells under hypoxia (Fig. 4A). Because HIF-1α is a master regulator for hypoxia-induced cellular responses, we next investigated whether SMG-1 had an effect on HIF-1α transcriptional activity. Co-expression of WT SMG-1, but not KD SMG-1, with HIF-1α demonstrated that SMG-1 inhibited HIF-1α-mediated transcription in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). These results suggested that the kinase activity of SMG-1 was critical in suppressing HIF-1α activity in tumor cells under hypoxia. Increased VEGF and CA9 proteins in epithelial cancers are markers of tumor hypoxia and are associated with a poor prognosis, because expression of VEGF and CA9 promotes tumor-associated angiogenesis and the survival capacity of hypoxic tumors, respectively (5Bristow R.G. Hill R.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 7Dewhirst M.W. Cao Y. Moeller B. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Because both VEGF and CA9 expression are tightly regulated by HIF-1 activity, we suspected that removal of SMG-1, a negative regulator of HIF-1, would substantially enhance the production of VEGF and CA9 in tumor cells under hypoxia. In Fig. 5 (A and B), we demonstrated that in SMG-1-deficient cells the production of VEGF and CA9 was substantially elevated under hypoxia. As hypoxic conditions significantly enhance tumor metastasis partly by boosting the migratory potential of tumor cells, we tested whether depletion of cellular SMG-1 had any effect on hypoxic tumor cell motility. Indeed, we found that SMG-1 depletion significantly promoted the migratory potential of cancer cells in hypoxia (Fig. 5C). These results indicated that SMG-1 repressed a range of malignant responses induced by oxygen deprivation of tumor cells and suggested that human SMG-1 was a tumor suppressor, particularly for hypoxic tumors. Hypoxia occurs in the majority of tumors, promoting angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy (26Wouters B.G. Koritzinsky M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 851-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). HIF-1 is a master transcriptional activator of ∼100–200 genes that promote adaptation and survival under hypoxia (27Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 865-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). To identify novel kinase regulators of HIF-1, we screened a siRNA library targeting 779 human kinases and used the HRE reporter assay as readout under hypoxia. Among these 779 human kinases, we found that 18 kinases positively regulated HIF-1 activity. Especially, the depletion of ERK1 and MAPK3K1, two key kinases of the ERK MAPK pathway, significantly decreased HIF-1 activity. It has been reported that treatment of tumor cells with the MEK1/2 inhibitors PD98059 or U0216, or expression of a dominant-negative form of ERK1, blocked HIF-1 activation in hypoxia (28Richard D.E.

Michiels C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Herein, using specific siRNA targeting of cellular ERK1 or MAPK3K1, we confirmed that the MAPK positively regulated the HIF-1 activity under hypoxia. On the other hand, we discovered that the depletion of 10 other kinases significantly increased the HIF-1 activity. Among these kinases, it has been reported that suppression of DUSP1 (32Liu C. Shi Y. Du Y. Ning X. Liu N. Huang D. Liang J. Xue Y. Fan D. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 309: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and VRK2 (33Blanco S. Santos C. Lazo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7273-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) could result in up-regulation of HIF-1 activity in hypoxic conditions. Interestingly, of these novel candidates that negatively regulate HIF-1 activity, the depletion of SMG-1 had the strongest enhancing effect on HIF-1 activity. SMG-1, the newest member of the PIKK family, contains a large (>1000 amino acid) insert region between the kinase domain and FATC domain (9Abraham R.T. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Denning G. Jamieson L. Maquat L.E. Thompson E.A. Fields A.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 2007; 282: 7799-7808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Moreover, SMG-1 is found in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments (14Brumbaugh K.M. Otterness D.M. Geisen C. Oliveira V. Brognard J. Li X. Lejeune F. Tibbetts R.S. Maquat L.E. Abraham R.T. Mol.

Ohno S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1187-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), unlike the related genotoxic stress-responsive kinases, ATM and ATR, which are confined to the nucleus in most cells (36Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic presence of SMG-1 suggests that this PIKK may play additional roles other than stress signaling restricted within the nucleus such as DNA repair. In this study, we found that SMG-1 was activated under hypoxic conditions, the depletion of cellular SMG-1 significantly enhanced HIF-1α activity, and increasing expression of SMG-1 markedly inhibited HIF-1α activity. These results implied that SMG-1 activity potently suppressed HIF-1-dependent cellular responses in hypoxic cells. However, the activity of mTOR, another member of the PIKK family, was inhibited by hypoxic stress, thereby suppressing HIF-1α protein translation. These observations suggest that hypoxia induces activation of SMG-1 and deactivation of mTOR pathways to contain the HIF-1α activity at post-translational and translational levels, correspondingly, thereby maintaining appropriate cellular responses for numerous physiological and pathological conditions under hypoxia. HIF-1α activity is regulated in two major ways. The first relies on hydroxylation-dependent degradation/inactivation. The second involves control of HIF-1α protein synthesis via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT and MAPK pathways. To investigate the mechanism of HIF-1α activity in SMG-1-deficient cells, we first studied the effect on the stability of HIF-1α of SMG-1 deficiency under hypoxia and found that SMG-1 knockdown did not affect HIF-1α stability, which suggests that SMG-1 does not involve in the regulation of von Hippel-Lindau ubiquitin ligase complex. HIF-1α activity is also regulated by AKT, mTOR, and MAPK. To determine whether the activated SMG-1 kinase had an effect on other cellular kinase cascades, we analyzed the ERK1/2, mTOR, AKT, and BMK1 kinase pathways and found that depletion of cellular SMG-1 altered only the intensity of ERK1/2 activation. ERK1/2 activity is up-regulated by oxygen deficiency and is involved in HIF-1 activation in hypoxic tumor cells (31Minet E. Arnould T. Michel G. Roland I. Mottet D. Raes M. Remacle J. Michiels C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Our siRNA library screen result indicated that ERK1 is a positive regulator of HIF-1α. Furthermore, we found that SMG-1 inhibited the HIF-1α transactivation activity in part though suppressing MAPK ERK1 in hypoxia. ERK1/2 has been shown to phosphorylate HIF-1α in vitro (28Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothié E. Roux D. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32631-32637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 37Sodhi A. Montaner S. Miyazaki H. Gutkind J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). MAPKs are critical for the transactivation activities of both HIF-1α and p300 through promoting HIF-1-p300 interaction by mediating the phosphorylation of these two molecules (1Pouysségur J. Dayan F. Mazure N.M. Nature. 2006; 441: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar, 28Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothié E. Roux D. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32631-32637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is very likely that the activation of SMG-1 by low oxygen restrains the hypoxia-induced malignant responses in tumor cells partially through inhibition of the MAPK pathway and the consequent HIF-1α activation. Hypoxia promotes a range of malignant responses in tumor cells such as proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, migration, and metastasis (4Keith B. Simon M.C. Cell. 2007; 129: 465-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Herein, we demonstrated that SMG-1 activity is critical, in hypoxic tumor cells, in repressing HIF-1 activity and consequent secretion of the angiogenic factor, VEGF, and the survival factor, CA9, and in blocking cell motility under low oxygen conditions as well.

It should be interesting to further investigate whether these mutations compromise the ability of SMG-1 to suppress HIF-1 activity in hypoxia and consequently augment the malignant potential of hypoxic breast tumor cells. Herein, we demonstrated that SMG-1 was a strong negative regulator for hypoxia-induced tumor cell responses such as the secretion of angiogenic factor, VEGF, and survival factor, CA9, as well as for hypoxic tumor cell motility. Thus, our findings have important prognostic and therapeutic implications for the treatment of hypoxic tumors. Analysis of SMG-1 expression levels or mutations in human cancer could be used as a biological marker to predict efficacy of treatment with MAPK or angiogenesis inhibitors. SMG-1 targeted drugs up-regulating SMG-1 protein, mRNA levels, and/or its activity could be used for treating cancer patients, in combination with angiogenesis inhibitors and/or other traditional cancer therapeutic approaches such as chemo- and radiotherapies."

Using immunoprecipitation and pulldown experiments with domain-specific recombinant fragments, we show that smooth muscle archvillin (SmAV) binds ERK and members of the ERK signaling cascade in a domain-specific, stimulus-dependent, and pathway-specific manner. MEK binds specifically to the first 445 residues of SmAV. B-Raf, an upstream regulator of MEK, constitutively interacts with residues 1–445 and 446–1250. Both ERK and 14-3-3 bind to both fragments, but in a stimulus-specific manner. Phosphorylated ERK is associated only with residues 1–445. An ERK phosphorylation site was determined by mass spectrometry to reside at Ser<sup>132</sup>. A phospho-antibody raised to this site shows that the site is phosphorylated during α-agonist-mediated ERK activation in smooth muscle tissue. Phosphorylation of SmAV by ERK decreases the association of phospho-ERK with SmAV. These results, combined with previous observations, indicate that SmAV serves as a new ERK scaffolding protein and provide a mechanism for regulation of ERK binding, activation, and release from the signaling complex."
