https://openalex.org/W2033624890,"The mechanism of lipid peroxidation and the manner in which antioxidants function is reviewed. β-Carotene is a purported anticancer agent, which is believed by some to have antioxidant action of a radical-trapping type. However, definitive experimental support for such action has been lacking. New experiments in vitro show that β-carotene belongs to a previously unknown class of biological antioxidants. Specifically, it exhibits good radical-trapping antioxidant behavior only at partial pressures of oxygen significantly less than 150 torr, the pressure of oxygen in normal air. Such low oxygen partial pressures are found in most tissues under physiological conditions. At higher oxygen pressures, β-carotene loses its antioxidant activity and shows an autocatalytic, prooxidant effect, particularly at relatively high concentrations. Similar oxygen-pressure-dependent behavior may be shown by other compounds containing many conjugated double bonds."

https://openalex.org/W1536422318,"The oxidation of methyl linoleate in solution initiated with azo compounds has been studied in the absence and presence of vitamin E and vitamin C. Both vitamin E and vitamin C acted as a chain-breaking antioxidant and they suppressed the oxidation and produced an induction period. The inhibition rate constant for the scavenging of peroxy radical was calculated at 37 degrees C as kinh = 5.1 X 10(5) M-1 s-1 and 7.5 X 10(4) M-1 s-1 for vitamin E and vitamin C, respectively. It was suggested that each vitamin E could trap two peroxy radicals, whereas vitamin C could trap only one peroxy radical under the reaction conditions employed in this study. When both vitamin E and vitamin C were present, the oxidation was suppressed quite efficiently and the apparent inhibition rate constant was obtained as kinh = 4.0 X 10(5) M-1 s-1. Furthermore, vitamin E remained almost unchanged and only vitamin C was consumed at the initial stage and vitamin E was consumed after vitamin C was exhausted. It was concluded that vitamin E trapped the peroxy radical and the resulting alpha-chromanoxy radical reacted with vitamin C to regenerate vitamin E."

https://openalex.org/W24722359,"Among a series of fucolipids accumulating in human colonic and liver adenocarcinoma, two neutral fucolipids have been isolated and their carbohydrate structures have been characterized by methylation analysis, mass spectrometry, enzymatic degradation, and proton NMR spectrometry as shown in Structures 1 and 2 below. These glycolipids are either absent or present in very small quantity in normal colonic mucosa and normal liver tissue. (formular; see text) Difucosyl neolactonorhexaosylceramide (Structure 1) gives a doublet or a triplet on high performance thin layer chromatography and can be separated into four to five fractions on high pressure high performance liquid chromatography. These components have the same carbohydrate structure, but have different fatty acid composition. Fractions are characterized by a predominance of either alpha-hydroxy C16 fatty acid or alpha-hydroxy C24 fatty acid. Trifucosyl neolactonoroctaosylceramide (structure 2) gives two discrete bands, which are designated Z3 and Z4, on high performance thin layer chromatography. Methylation analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra show that the Z3 and Z4 have identical carbohydrate structures. All the cases of cancer tissue that accumulate di- or trifucosyl structure (1 or 2 above) also accumulated lactofucopentaose(III)ceramide. A possible enhancement in a specific synthetic pathway including type 2 chain elongation coupled with alpha 1----3 fucosylation in human cancer is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1518808549,"Limited proteolysis and specific chemical cleavage methods have enabled a detailed structural characterization of human erythrocyte protein 4.1. This protein is composed of two chemically very similar polypeptide chains (a and b) with apparent molecular masses of 80,000 and 78,000 daltons. Cleavage of protein 4.1 at cysteine residues by 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid produces a series of doublets which differ by approximately 2,000 daltons and have identical peptide maps. Alignment of these peptides by mapping analysis has localized 4 cysteine residues within a 17,000-dalton segment on both a and b polypeptides. Mild chymotryptic treatment at 0 degrees C cleaves protein 4.1 primarily in three central locations and generates two families of unrelated peptides. Analysis of these fragments in two-dimensional gels and by peptide mapping reveals an unusual polarity in protein 4.1 structure in that each polypeptide chain contains two segments, one relatively acidic the other basic, that are segregated at opposite ends of the molecule. The basic region is digested into a cysteine-rich 30,000-dalton domain which resists further breakdown while the acidic region is readily degraded into smaller fragments. The peptides derived from the acidic region all appear as doublets suggesting that protein 4.1 a and b polypeptides differ close to the terminus of the acidic end. Similar phosphorylation sites occur on both polypeptides within a segment some 24,000-34,000 daltons from the acidic terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1505130887,"Neplanocin A, a novel cyclopentenyl analog of adenosine, is a naturally occurring antibiotic which exhibits significant antitumor activity against L1210 leukemia in mice (Yaginuma, S., Muto, N., Tsujino, M., Sudate, Y., Hayashi, M., and Otani, M. (1981) J. Antibiot. 34, 359-366). In the present study we demonstrate that neplanocin A is also a potent inhibitor of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase (EC 3.3.1.1) having a Ki of 8.39 nM for the purified bovine liver enzyme. Analysis of the apparent irreversible inactivation of AdoHcy hydrolase by neplanocin A indicates that the drug is a tight binding inhibitor, exhibiting a stoichiometry of one molecule of inhibitor to one molecule (tetramer) of enzyme. In addition, we show that neplanocin A is a potent inhibitor of vaccinia virus (WR) multiplication in monolayer cultures of mouse L-cells. Concentrations of the drug as low as 0.5 and 1.0 microM in the culture medium produce 84 and 95% inhibition of plaque formation, respectively, while exhibiting little toxicity to the host cells. The inhibition of virus multiplication by neplanocin A coincides with a rapid inhibition of AdoHcy hydrolase activity in the infected cells and a subsequent 10-fold increase in the intracellular AdoHcy/S-adenosylmethionine ratio. These findings suggest that the antiviral actions of this compound may be related to an inhibition of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent macromolecular methylation reactions which are essential to the production of new virus particles (e.g. viral messenger RNA)."
https://openalex.org/W1494195992,"The activated glucocorticoid receptor (GR) from rat liver cytosol was purified by sequential chromatography on DNA-cellulose and DEAE-Sepharose. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis demonstrated a main band with Mr = 94,000 (94K band). Two minor bands with Mr = 79,000 (79K band) and 72,000 (72K band) were also seen in this preparation. Photoaffinity labeling showed that the hormone is bound to the 94K and 79K components but not to the 72K component. Immunoblotting using antibodies raised against the 94K protein demonstrated cross-reactivity between the 94K and 79K components but not with the 72K species. The 72K species could be partially separated from the 94K and 79K components by density gradient centrifugation. Limited proteolysis of the purified GR with trypsin or alpha-chymotrypsin led to degradation of the 94K and 79K components and appearance of a 39K fragment which still retained the hormone and could be bound to DNA-cellulose. The 72K component was not affected by digestion with trypsin or alpha-chymotrypsin. However, chromatography on DNA-cellulose of the alpha-chymotrypsin-treated GR resulted in elution of the 72K component in the flow-through of the column while the 39K fragment was retained on the column and eluted with 0.18 M NaCl. In the control experiment where no alpha-chymotrypsin treatment was performed, the 72K component could not be detected in the flow-through fraction but was eluted together with the 94K and 79K components at 0.18 M NaCl. These results suggest that the 72K protein might be bound to the 94K and/or 79K component. The 39K fragment did not bind antibodies raised against the 94K protein. The 39K fragment was further degraded by trypsin but not by alpha-chymotrypsin to a 27K and a 25K fragment while both still retained the ligand. These data obtained with limited proteolysis of the purified GR are in agreement with previous findings on proteolysis of the GR in crude cytosol (Wrange, O., and Gustafsson, J.-A. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 856-865; Carlstedt-Duke, J., Okret, S., Wrange, O., and Gustafsson, J.-A. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 4260-4264)."

https://openalex.org/W2052735514,"Amblyomma americanum is a likely secondary vector of Lyme disease in New Jersey. Ticks of this species were removed from the site of the characteristic skin lesion known as erythema chronicum migrans on two patients with the disease, and the Lyme disease spirochete was isolated from nymphs and adults of this species. That A. americanum is a potential vector is supported by its similarities to Ixodes dammini, the known tick vector, in seasonal distribution and host utilization. The extensive range of A. americanum may have great implications for potential Lyme disease transmission outside known endemic areas."
https://openalex.org/W1504266925,"This report concerns further characterization of the 94-kDa and the 78-kDA glucose-regulated proteins which are the major proteins overproduced in hamster fibroblasts when the cells are starved of glucose. Using a temperature-sensitive mutant, K12, which synthesizes high levels of these proteins at the nonpermissive temperature, we purified both proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and determined their amino acid compositions as well as the NH2-terminal sequences. Both proteins contain an unusual NH2-terminal sequence rich in glutamic and aspartic acid residues. Biochemical fractionation of these proteins demonstrated that the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein is present in the nuclear fraction. In addition, we show that phosphate incorporation into the 78-kDa protein is specifically affected in the K12 mutant cells."
https://openalex.org/W1603707847,"The structure of the human properdin molecule was investigated by hydrodynamic, spectroscopic, and transmission electron microscope studies. Sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation of purified, functionally active properdin showed a single component sedimenting at 5.5 S. Electron microscopic examination by two different methods, however, revealed polydispersity of the protein which consisted of cyclic dimers, trimers, tetramers, pentamers, and higher cyclic oligomers. Approximately 80% of the oligomers were dimers, trimers, and tetramers. Monomers could not be detected. These polymers could be partially separated by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300 and all fractions were active in terms of binding to C3b. The specific activity increased with oligomer size. When reexamined after incubation at 37 degrees C for 4 h or at 4 degrees C for 2 weeks, the chromatographic behavior of the oligomers and their electron microscopic appearance were unchanged, suggesting that in vitro no rapid equilibration occurred. The protomer is clearly visualized within polymers as a flexible, rod-like structure 26.0 nm in length and 2.5 nm in diameter, with pronounced thickening at each end. The monomer is bivalent with respect to binding to other properdin monomers and the binding sites are localized to the ends of the structure. A model could be devised which is consistent with the distinct geometry of the intersubunit contacts observed in micrographs. The circular dichroism spectrum of properdin suggests the presence of little alpha helix or beta structure and shows positive ellipticity at 231 nm. In contrast to previous investigators, we conclude that isolated human properdin is polydisperse and consists of a set of cyclic polymers constructed from a single highly asymmetric and flexible protomer."
https://openalex.org/W1983378071,Local rates of cerebral glucose utilization were measured in rats by the quantitative 2-deoxy-D-[14C]glucose autoradiographic method during electrical stimulation of the ventral tegmental area. Rats trained in intracranial self-stimulation showed a pattern of changes in forebrain metabolic activity distinctly different from the pattern seen in rats stimulated by the experimenter. These findings provide information about the distribution of local cerebral activity specific to reinforced instrumental behavior.
https://openalex.org/W1579418494,"We have prepared chicken erythrocyte nucleosomes lacking proteins other than the inner histones and containing long DNA. Our nucleosomes' DNA has mean length +/- SD = 190 +/- 15 base pairs. No DNA less than 155 base pairs is present. Nucleosome stability in salt was examined by boundary and band sedimentation and by particle gel electrophoresis. We find the following. (i) A second species is slowly generated by treatment with salt. This species sediments with S20,w = 5.5 S (as does purified mononucleosomal DNA), is not associated with histones, and electrophoretically migrates as mononucleosomal DNA. We conclude it is free DNA. Thus, salt causes nucleosomes to dissociate, independently of either noncore proteins, or of any nucleosome population with DNA less than 146 base pairs. (ii) Dissociation is reversible, and is enhanced by nucleosome dilution. Thus, it appears to follow the law of mass action. (iii) The equilibrium extent of dissociation increases with salt. A second effect of salt is a fast, reversible 10% decrease in S20,w of the nucleosomes left intact. From hydrodynamic calculations, this is consistent with either a slight unfolding of the entire nucleosome, or an unbinding of the terminal DNA regions from the histone core."

https://openalex.org/W2140720774,"An N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of [3H]methotrexate has been employed to covalently label a specific binding protein that resides in the plasma membrane of L1210 cells. Incorporation of radioactivity into this protein accounted for 55% of total cellular labeling, was half-maximal at a reagent concentration of 27 nM, and was blocked either by prior exposure to unlabeled reagent or by the addition of excess methotrexate. A role for this protein in methotrexate transport was supported by the observations that: (a) similar concentrations of reagent were required for both labeling of the binding protein and irreversible inhibition of transport; (b) the amount of labeled binding protein was comparable to observed levels of transport protein; (c) protection against labeling was afforded by thiamin pyrophosphate, a potent competitive inhibitor of methotrexate transport; and (d) labeling of the binding protein was not observed in a subline of L1210 cells that has a defect in the ability to transport methotrexate. The binding protein could be solubilized from the membrane by various ionic and non-ionic detergents and the covalent bond between the incorporated [3H]methotrexate and the protein was stable to a variety of conditions, including high concentrations of mercaptoethanol and hydroxylamine and extremes of pH. The labeled protein fractionated as a nearly symmetrical peak on Sephacryl S-300 and it appeared as a single band (Mr = 36,000) after electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel containing sodium dodecyl sulfate."
https://openalex.org/W181761884,"Abstract The structure of the human red blood cell membrane band 3 protein has been investigated by proteolysis of intact cells with papain. Papain cleaves the 35,000-dalton chymotryptic peptide (CH35) of band 3 into two integral fragments of Mr 7,500 (P7) and 28,000 (P28). The papain cleavage of CH35 causes inhibition of band 3-catalyzed Cl transport. The peptide P28 carries the band 3 carbohydrate and also contains the 2 cysteine residues in CH35. The anion transport inhibitor H2DIDS (4,4'-diisothiocyanodihydrostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate) reacts covalently with a lysine residue on P28, rather than P7, in native band 3. However, if the cells are first digested with papain and then reacted with H2DIDS, there is significant covalent reaction with P7, producing a covalent cross-link between P7 and the 60,000-dalton chymotryptic peptide (CH60). Graded papain digestion experiments and end group determinations indicate that the alignment of the band 3 peptides is N-CH60-P7-P28-COOH. The NH2-terminal sequence of P7 is identical with a segment of a peptic fragment of band 3 recently sequenced (Brock, C.J., Tanner, M.J.A., and Kempf, C. (1983) Biochem. J. 213, 577-586). This published sequence, plus our sequence data on CH35 and P7, show that papain cleaves the outer surface of CH35 at two sites, which are 6 residues and 71 residues from the chymotrypsin cleavage site. The 65-residue peptide (P7) between these sites is the best characterized segment of band 3 thus far described: its sequence and location in the band 3 primary structure are now known, and both ends of the peptide are unambiguously exofacial."

https://openalex.org/W1598709204,"A calcium-sensitive actin-binding protein having a subunit molecular mass of 30,000 daltons (30K protein) has been isolated from Dictyostelium discoideum. Structural, immunological, and functional analyses demonstrated that the 30K protein was distinct from other actin-binding proteins of D. discoideum. A native molecular mass of 31,700 daltons was determined by equilibrium sedimentation, indicating that the protein is monomeric. The Stokes radius was 30 A. The frictional coefficient calculated from these measurements was 1.44, indicating an asymmetric shape. The 30K protein induced an increase in the viscosity of a solution of F-actin. Bundles of actin filaments were observed in negatively stained mixtures of actin and the 30K protein. Both the formation of filament bundles and the increases in viscosity of actin induced by the 30K protein were observed in the presence of 1 X 10(-8) M but not 2 X 10(-6) M calcium. Variation of the pH from 6.6 to 7.8 had no effect on the activity of the 30K protein. Calcium induced neither a large change in quaternary structure of the 30K protein nor a restriction of the lengths of actin filaments by the 30K protein. The apparent affinity of the 30K protein for actin was decreased in the presence of calcium. Reversible cross-linking of actin filaments by the 30K protein may contribute to regulation of the consistency and contractility of cytoplasm in D. discoideum."
https://openalex.org/W2069190054,"Sensitive magnetometry has shown that, after inhalation of airborne magnetic dust by humans or animals, particles retained within the lungs rotate. A number of mechanisms for this rotation have been proposed, including motions of breathing, particle thermal energy, cardiac pulsations, surface fluid flows, and macrophage cytoplasmic movements. In this study the cellular mechanism was examined by magnetometry and videomicroscopy of pulmonary macrophages removed from hamster lungs 1 day after inhalation of a maghemite (gamma-Fe2O3) aerosol. The field remaining after magnetization was measured in adherent cells and was found to decay rapidly to 30 percent of its initial magnitude within 12 minutes. The remanent-field decay rate was slowed by inhibitors of cytoplasmic motion. Videomicroscopy of pulmonary macrophages with phagocytized gamma-Fe2O3 showed amoeboid motions that rotated the particles away from their original direction of magnetization. The results confirm that macrophage cytoplasmic movement is a primary cause of remanent-field decay in lungs and that magnetometry can be used to quantify intracellular contractile activity."
https://openalex.org/W1606420095,"Fetal calf alpha-crystallins were denatured using various concentrations of urea and analyzed by gel filtration and ultracentrifugation. alpha c-Crystallin (18.4 S) irreversibly dissociates to alpha m-crystallin (11.8 S) at low urea concentrations. These findings substantiate our previous proposal that alpha c-crystallin is an artefactual aggregate produced by low isolation temperatures (Thomson, J.A., and Augusteyn, R.C. (1983) Exp. Eye Res. 37, 367-377). The sedimentation coefficient of alpha m-crystallin decreases steadily with increasing urea, due to a parallel change in the diffusion coefficient and not to a decrease in molecular weight. The aggregate dissociates directly to subunits, with no evidence for stable intermediate species. Complete dissociation, in 8 M urea, is accompanied by gross disruption of the secondary and tertiary structures. Following removal of the urea, the reassociated alpha r-crystallin is indistinguishable from native alpha m-crystallin in secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure, as judged from the sedimentation and diffusion coefficients, subunit contents, near- and far-UV CD spectra, the microenvironments of cyteine and aromatic amino acids, and from their immunochemical properties. We have concluded that the native structure of alpha-crystallin can be completely recovered after dissociation and denaturation in urea."
https://openalex.org/W1667373896,"Membranes from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells possess an activity which, in the presence of farnesyl pyrophosphate, incorporates [14C]isopentenyl pyrophosphate into a product which is soluble in chloroform/ methanol and retained by DEAE-cellulose. The product co-migrated with authentic dolichyl phosphate on thin layer chromatography but was degraded to neutral labeled compounds when subjected to mild acid hydrolysis, suggesting the presence of an unsaturated alpha-isoprene unit. Triton X-100 (2%) liberated the activity from the membranes and the resulting solubilized preparation was further characterized. The enzyme was found to be sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents and stimulated by ionic strength. A strong dependence of activity on the addition of farnesyl pyrophosphate was observed, allowing several compounds to be tested for their ability to serve as potential primers. Geranyl pyrophosphate, neryl pyrophosphate, all-trans farnesyl pyrophosphate and all-trans geranylgeranyl pyrophospate were found to be effective substrates, although to different extents. Citronellyl pyrophosphate (which has a saturated alpha-isoprene) was inactive as a substrate. The chain length of the products generated was investigated by using a double label isotope procedure and by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. All active primers yielded a product containing 16-19 isoprene units; the distribution of the individual isoprene species was essentially identical regardless of the primer used as substrate. These findings indicate that the specificity lies in the absolute chain length of the product released and not the number of isoprenes added. High performance liquid chromatography of the [14C]polyprenol resulting from enzymatic dephosphorylation of the reaction product indicated the presence of an unsaturated alpha-isoprene unit in a cis-configuration. It is proposed that the enzyme is the long chain cis-prenyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of dolichyl phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1595603156,"In the presence of estradiol, at a concentration sufficient to saturate the estrogen receptor, the antiestrogenic and anti-tumor agent tamoxifen was bound to a high affinity (KD = 0.97 +/- 0.15 nM at 4 degrees C) saturable binding site (141,300 +/- 20,100 sites/cell) in MCF 7 human mammary carcinoma cells. The distribution of this site between cytosol, mitochondrial, microsomal (heavy and light), and nuclear fractions paralleled that of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, an enzyme marker for endoplasmic reticulum. The interaction between tamoxifen and the high affinity site was influenced by changes in pH, ionic strength, and temperature. The kinetic rate constants k+1 and k-1 showed strong temperature dependence, but KD was unaffected by changes in temperature. Competition studies employing analogs of the anit-estrogens tamoxifen, clomiphene, and CI 628 revealed narrow specificity for triphenylethylene derivatives with basic ether side chains."
https://openalex.org/W1525819460,"The previously described chymotryptic fragment of bacteriorhodopsin, C-2 (amino acids 1-71), is cleaved by 70% formic acid to two fragments, A-1 (amino acids 1-36) and A-2 (amino acids 37-71), which have been separated by high pressure liquid chromatography. The fragments A-1 and A-2, separately or together, are not able to replace C-2 in forming a stable bacteriorhodopsin-like complex with the fragment C-1 (amino acids 72-248) and all-trans-retinal. A second set of bacteriorhodopsin fragments, B-1 (amino acids 1-155) and B-2 (amino acids 156-248), have been prepared by sodium borohydride cleavage of bacteriorhodopsin. Following denaturation, fragments B-1 and B-2 reassociate in the presence of retinal to regenerate the native bacteriorhodopsin chromophore (approximately 40%). Fragment B-1 also interacts with fragment C-1 and all-trans-retinal to form a complex with spectral properties and secondary structure similar to those of bacteriorhodopsin. Vesicles prepared from the reconstituted fragment complexes (B-1 + B-2) or (B-1 + C-1), show proton pumping activities comparable to the previously described activity fragments C-1 and C-2."
https://openalex.org/W1592466273,"Abstract Fluorescence polarization has been used to probe the exposure of tryptophan residues of erythrocyte spectrin. A significant decrease in anisotropy occurred when spectrin was heated at temperatures ranging from 38 to 48 degrees C. At low concentrations of urea, these anisotropy changes shifted to lower temperatures and were minimal in concentrations of urea 3 M or greater. These findings were attributed to the stepwise unfolding of the subdomain structure of spectrin under these conditions and eventual dissociation of oligomeric spectrin to the monomer state. DEAE-cellulose column chromatography in the presence of 3 M urea confirmed this prediction and permitted isolation of pure alpha and beta subunits of spectrin in good yields. The isolated subunits were soluble in neutral salt solutions and were readily reconstituted into high molecular weight forms that displayed tryptophan fluorescence anisotropy changes and migrated as discrete oligomeric species when analyzed by nondenaturing acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The reconstituted complexes were indistinguishable from native spectrin molecules when examined by low angle shadowing and electron microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W1577660144,"The tubulin proteins of the parasitic hemoflagellate Trypanosoma brucei brucei were purified and characterized. Cytoskeletal microtubules of trypanosomes do not disrupt under conditions used to solubilize brain tubulins. Trypanosomal tubulins, solubilized by extensive sonication, were partially purified from the crude cell extracts by taxol-mediated polymerization. Taxolinduced microtubules were identified by electron microscopy and analyzed biochemically. They consist predominantly of two proteins of about 52,000 and 56,000 Da. Their mobilities on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels differ slightly from those of bovine brain tubulins. Immunological cross-reactivity with antibodies raised against bovine brain tubulins confirmed the nature of the trypanosomal proteins. Peptide mapping of bovine and trypanosomal alpha- and beta-tubulins was performed by enzymatic digestion with staphylococcal protease V8 and chemical cleavage with N-chlorosuccinimide. In both cases, the peptide patterns generated from the trypanosomal alpha- and beta-tubulins were closely related to each other. This suggests that the trypanosomal alpha- and beta-tubulins may have remained more conserved during evolution than the tubulins from higher eukaryotes. The trypanosomal alpha-tubulin is post-translationally modified in vivo by the reversible addition of a tyrosine residue at its COOH terminus. As in higher eukaryotes, this reaction is completely specific for the alpha-polypeptide chain. Our observation represents the first documentation of the occurrence of COOH-terminal tyrosinolation of alpha-tubulin in an eukaryotic microorganism."

https://openalex.org/W1594166164,"We have investigated the subcellular location and regulation of hepatic bilirubin UDP-glucuronyltransferase, which has been presumed to be located largely in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Purity of subcellular membrane fractions isolated from rat liver was assessed by electron microscopy and marker enzymes. Bilirubin UDP-glucuronyltransferase activity was measured by radiochemical assay using a physiologic concentration of [14C]bilirubin, and formation rates of bilirubin diglucuronide and monoglucuronides (C-8 and C-12 isomers) were determined. Activity of the enzyme was widely distributed in subcellular membranes, the majority being found in smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, with small amounts in nuclear envelope and Golgi membranes. No measurable activity was found in plasma membranes or in cytosol. Synthesis of bilirubin diglucuronide as a percentage of total conjugates and the ratio of C-8/C-12 bilirubin monoglucuronide isomers formed were comparable in all membranes, suggesting that the same enzyme is present in all locations. However, the regulation of bilirubin UDP-glucuronyltransferase activity differed among intracellular membranes; enzyme activity measured in the presence of the allosteric effector uridine 5'-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine exhibited latency in smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membranes, but not in rough endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope. Since rough membranes comprise 60% of hepatocyte endoplasmic reticulum and bilirubin UDP-glucuronyltransferase activity in vitro is maximal in this membrane fraction under presumed physiologic conditions, it is likely that the rough endoplasmic reticulum represents the major site of bilirubin glucuronidation in hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1673446993,"Treatment of the purple membrane with carboxypeptidase A, Pronase, or papain, results in the cleavage of amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of bacteriorhodopsin, a maximum of about 17 amino acids being released with papain. Protease-treated bacteriorhodopsin, after denaturation, refolds to the native structure, binds retinal as tightly as the intact protein and, on reconstitution into vesicles, gives full proton translocating activity. The CD spectrum of papain-treated purple membrane shows exciton coupling characteristic of the intact purple membrane. The trimeric bacteriorhodopsin in papain-treated purple membrane dissociates into monomers in Triton X-100 which, after removal of the detergent, reassociate to form the oligomeric structures. Chymotrypsin cleaves papain-treated bacteriorhodopsin between amino acids 71 and 72 as has been previously found for intact bacteriorhodopsin. The resulting fragments C-1 (amino acids 72-231) and C-2 (amino acids 1-71) reassociate, bind retinal, and regenerate the native chromophore, as previously demonstrated for the corresponding fragments from the intact protein. We conclude that the COOH-terminal peptide in bacteriorhodopsin is not required for the correct refolding of denatured bacteriorhodopsin to the native tertiary and quarternary structure, for chromophore regeneration or for light-driven proton translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1663025925,"The effect of palmitoyl coenzyme A, atractylosides, and anion transport inhibitors on translocation into rat liver Golgi vesicles of adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid, and GDP-fucose was studied. Translocation of the above three nucleotide derivatives was inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS; 50% inhibition required 10-20 microM DIDS). The inhibition of translocation of PAPS by DIDS was used to demonstrate that sulfation of macromolecules within Golgi vesicles is preceded by translocation of PAPS into the vesicles. Palmitoyl coenzyme A, at concentrations below its critical micellar concentration, specifically inhibited translocation into Golgi vesicles of PAPS but not CMP-NeuAc and GDP-fucose. Inhibition of PAPS translocation by 50% required 9 microM palmitoyl coenzyme A. Translocation of PAPS but not of CMP-NeuAc or GDP-fucose was also inhibited by atractyloside or carboxyatractyloside with 50% inhibition requiring 15 microM either glycoside. This pattern of inhibition suggests structural similarities between the putative translocator of PAPS in Golgi membranes and the ATP/ADP translocator of mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W46525105,"Halobacterium halobium spheroplasts synthesize and accumulate a bacteriorhodopsin precursor. By labeling of the precursor with [35S]Met and [3H]Leu followed by Edman degradation, we have confirmed the previous conclusion from the DNA sequencing that the precursor contains 13 additional amino acids at the NH2 terminus of bacteriorhodopsin. Although not processed in the spheroplasts, it integrates into the purple membrane in the correctly folded conformation. This was shown by the mode of cleavage by a number of proteolytic enzymes, the site of attachment of retinal, and the formation of oligomers on reaction with bifunctional cross-linking reagents. In all these respects, the behavior of the precursor was identical with that of native mature bacteriorhodopsin in the purple membrane. Finally, the precursor was not processed to bacteriorhodopsin even when the spheroplasts were subsequently allowed to revert to rod-shaped cells. This suggests that either the processing of the precursor is cotranslational or that the NH2 terminus of the precursor becomes inaccessible to the processing enzyme in the spheroplasts following integration into the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1515870717,"A recirculating perfused rabbit heart preparation is used to study the reaction of antithrombin III (ATIII) with thrombin bound to the surface of the microvascular endothelium. Addition of ATIII to the system after thrombin is equilibrated with its binding sites results in inhibition of the enzyme as measured by disappearance of thrombin enzymatic activity from the circulation or by appearance of 125I-thrombin-ATIII complexes. The rate of inhibition of thrombin as reflected by either method is independent of the bound state of thrombin. Comparable results are obtained with ATIII modified at a single tryptophan residue. This modification does not alter the reaction rate of ATIII with thrombin but abolishes the capacity of heparin or heparan sulfate to enhance the reaction rate. From the kinetics and structural studies and the fit of the kinetics to a theoretical model relating binding equilibrium to thrombin inhibition, it is concluded that glycosaminoglycans are not involved in the reversible, high affinity, high capacity binding of thrombin to the vascular endothelium."
https://openalex.org/W1567904103,"Data from numerous laboratories show that mitochondria isolated from livers treated acutely with glucagon have higher rates of state 3 respiration than control mitochondria. The purpose of the present study was to learn whether this phenomenon is an isolation artifact resulting from a stabilization of the mitochondrial membrane or whether it represents a real increase in the maximal respiratory capacity of liver cells due to glucagon treatment. Electron transport was measured through different spans of the electron transport chain by using ferricyanide as an alternate electron acceptor to O2. With isolated intact liver mitochondria, pretreatment with glucagon was found to cause an increase in electron flow, through both Complex I and Complex III, suggesting that the effect of glucagon was not specific for a single site in the electron transport chain. Using intact isolated hepatocytes, different results are obtained. Respiration was measured in isolated hepatocytes after quantitation of the hepatocyte mitochondrial content by assay of citrate synthase. Hepatocyte respiration could therefore be reported per mg of mitochondrial protein. By providing durohydroquinone to the cells, it was possible to measure electron flow from coenzyme Q to O2 in the absence of the physiological regulation of substrate supply. Likewise, the addition of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone released the in situ mitochondria from control by the cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio and it was possible to measure maximal electron flow rates through Complex III. In the presence of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, electron flow was higher in mitochondria in the cell than in isolated mitochondria. Glucagon caused no increase in mitochondrial respiration in situ either in the presence of the physiological substrates or in the presence of durohydroquinone. The data obtained do not support a role for the electron transport chain as a target of glucagon action in hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1658611828,"The reaction of glyceraldehyde (aldotriose) with hemoglobin A is analogous to the nonenzymic glycosylation of the protein with glucose in that the initial reversible Schiff base adduct (aldimine) of aldotriose undergoes Amadori rearrangement as does that of aldohexose to form the more stable ketoamine adduct. The modification of the alpha-amino group on Val-1(beta) of hemoglobin A as a ketoamine (2-oxo-3-hydroxypropyl group) apparently lowers the pKa of the alpha-amino group of the protein, since this derivative of hemoglobin elutes earlier on carboxymethylcellulose columns than the derivatives containing 2-oxo-3-hydroxypropyl groups on the epsilon-amino groups, and unmodified hemoglobin A. Similar chromatographic behavior has been reported for hemoglobin A1c which contains glucose at its Val-1(beta) as the ketoamine adduct. This suggests the similarity in the chemical consequences of having the ketoamine adduct of an aldose at Val-1(beta) of hemoglobin A under physiological conditions. The formation of the 2-oxo-3-hydroxypropyl groups on Val-1(beta) is nearly irreversible as has been suggested for similar adducts of glucose. On the other hand, the 2-oxo-3-hydroxypropyl groups on the epsilon-amino groups appear to be labile. The buffer conditions considerably influence the reversibility of the ketoamine adducts of aldotriose on the epsilon-amino groups; the reversibility is significantly higher in Tris buffers as compared with that in phosphate buffers. It is suggested that under physiological conditions the ketoamine adducts of aldotriose on the epsilon-amino groups exist in equilibrium with the aldimine, the equilibrium being favored toward the ketoamine. The enhanced release of the 2-oxo-3-hydroxypropyl groups in Tris buffers is probably a reflection of the trans-Schiff base reaction of aldimine with Tris. In support of this hypothesis, sodium cyanoborohydride, a reagent selective for the reduction of the aldimine linkages, inhibited the labilizing influence of Tris. A similar reversibility appears to be true of the ketoamine adducts of aldohexoses at the epsilon-amino groups of hemoglobin A, and ribonuclease A as well. This information on the reversibility of the ketoamine adducts of glucose on the epsilon-amino groups of proteins should be useful in understanding the details of the mechanism of nonenzymic glycosylation. It is also expected to influence the interpretation of the measurements of nonenzymically glucosylated hemoglobin A in diabetic patients."

https://openalex.org/W122343074,"The calcium-stabilized antigenic determinants on bovine prothrombin were localized to the NH2-terminal 1-42 residues using conformation-specific antibodies. Polyclonal antibodies to the bovine prothrombin-Ca(II) complex were raised in rabbits, and purified antibody subpopulations were isolated by sequential immunoabsorption and affinity chromatography. Anti-prothrombin-Ca(II) antibodies, characterized by their absolute specificity for the prothrombin-metal complex (Tai, M. M., Furie, B. C., and Furie, B. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 2790-2795), bound to prothrombin, fragment 1, reduced and carboxymethylated fragment 1, and CNBr fragment (1-72) in solution. However, these antibodies do not bind significantly to the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-rich fragment (1-39), CNBr fragment (73-156), or prethrombin 1. To obviate the complex analysis of possible reasons for the lack of antibody binding to small peptides in solution, conformation-specific antibodies directed against defined regions of the whole prothrombin molecule were isolated. The influence of calcium ions on the binding of these site-specific antibody subpopulations to 125I-labeled prothrombin fragment 1 was evaluated. Anti-(1-39)N, anti-(1-42)N, anti-(1-72)N, and anti-(reduced and carboxymethylated fragment 1)N showed enhanced binding to prothrombin fragment 1 in the presence of Ca(II), indicating the presence of calcium-stabilized antigenic determinants within each of these regions on fragment 1. In contrast, calcium ions had no effect on the interaction of anti-des-(1-42)prothrombin, anti-prethrombin 1, anti-(43-72)N, and anti-(73-156)N antibodies with prothrombin fragment 1. These results indicate that the metal-induced conformational transition, monitored immunochemically, is localized to the NH2-terminal, gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-rich region of prothrombin between residues 1-42."
https://openalex.org/W1587727873,"Two small angle x-ray scattering curves have been obtained from active and inactive ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase from Alcaligenes eutrophus. The radius of gyration was calculated to be R = 47.8 +/- 0.1 nm for the active enzyme and R = 49.2 +/- 0.1 nm for the inactive enzyme. The maximum particle dimension amounts to 13.5 +/- 0.5 nm for the active and 15.7 +/- 0.5 nm for the inactive enzyme. A model of the active carboxylase is presented. It is in good agreement with models derived from electron microscopical data. Model calculations for the inactive enzyme show some evidence for a configurational change."
https://openalex.org/W1632983119,"To identify proteins concerned with chromosome condensation processes, we used a temperature-sensitive mutant, tsBN2 derived from BHK21, in which premature chromosome condensation occurred at high temperature. When the proteins synthesized in tsBN2 during the induction of premature chromosome condensation were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we found that an acidic protein with a molecular weight of 35,000 was specifically associated with chromosome condensation. In the normal cell cycle, this protein was synthesized from the G2 through the M phase. The protein was located mainly in the chromosome fraction and was phosphorylated."
https://openalex.org/W1490997128,"A 1H NMR study of urocanic acid dissolved in water/dimethyl sulfoxide mixtures together with potentiometric determinations of its two successive acidities in the same solutions reveal that a proton is transferred from the imidazolium ring to the carboxylate group when the amount of dimethyl sulfoxide is increased. An analysis of the potentiometric data by means of the classical Hammett linear relationship allowed the four microscopic acidity constants to be determined. At 20 degrees C, there are equal fractions of the tautomeric species, i.e. urocanic acid (AH0) and its zwitterion (AH+-) in the mixture containing 34% dimethyl sulfoxide by weight (congruent to 0.1 in mole fraction), while 50% dimethyl sulfoxide by weight (congruent to 0.2 in mole fraction) is necessary to completely bias the equilibrium: AH+- in equilibrium AH0 toward the molecular form AH0."
https://openalex.org/W1488185793,"Enzymatic dehydrogenation of tryptophan residues in human alpha- and beta-globins has been demonstrated with tryptophan side chain oxidase II, a hemoprotein from Pseudomonas. In 1 M ammonium acetate, pH 4, the enzyme catalyzed the conversion of Trp-14 of alpha-globin to alpha, beta-dehydro-Trp. Under identical conditions, Trp-15 of beta-globin was converted to alpha, beta-dehydro-Trp, whereas Trp-37 was unmodified. No modification was obtained in 0.4% sodium dodecyl sulfate or 8 M urea. The dehydrogenase component of tryptophan side chain oxidase II was also active toward globins in the presence of ferricyanide, whereas tryptophan side chain oxidase I was inert. Upon analyses of the tryptic fragments of the modified beta-globin, two forms of alpha, beta-dehydro-Trp-15 distinguishable by ultraviolet absorption and fluorescence were identified. Each of them rapidly equilibrated with another form on irradiation at 300-380 nm. We tentatively assigned them to two isomers of alpha, beta-dehydro-Trp distinguishable by the configuration around its beta-carbon atom. alpha, beta-Dehydro-Trp in globins and certain polypeptides used herein showed a blue fluorescence at 420 nm. In [alpha, beta-dehydro-Trp 15]beta-globin, the fluorescence was exceptionally intense, the fluorescence yield being comparable to that of NADH. From several lines of evidence, the result was ascribed to the excitation energy transfer from Trp-37 to alpha, beta-dehydro-Trp-15 in the modified beta-globin."
https://openalex.org/W1530513403,"The rat liver microsomal vitamin K-dependent carboxylase has been shown to carboxylate the aspartyl residue in N alpha-t-butyloxycarbonylaspartic acid alpha-benzyl ester to a beta-carboxyaspartyl residue. The enzyme also carboxylates aspartyl residues in low molecular weight peptides to beta-carboxyaspartyl residues, but much less effectively than Glu residues in homologous peptides are carboxylated to gamma-carboxyglutamyl residues. The carboxylated product was identified by comparison to authentic beta-carboxyaspartate, by loss of 50% radioactivity incorporated from 14CO2 upon acid hydrolysis, and by identification of [14C]aspartic acid following acid hydrolysis. When peptides containing both aspartyl and glutamyl residues were used as substrates for the enzyme, the only carboxylated product detected was gamma-carboxyglutamic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1572049996,"The enzyme-reduced coenzyme-alpha-ketoglutarate ternary complex is a critical intermediate in the glutamate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction. Oxalylglycine, a structural analog of alpha-ketoglutarate which contains an amide carbonyl group in place of a reducible ketone group, is one of the few compounds known to complete with alpha-ketoglutarate itself. In order to examine the role of the ketone group of alpha-ketoglutarate in the ternary complex, we have carried out a calorimetric study of the corresponding oxalylglycine ternary complex, determining the complete delta H, delta G, delta S, and delta Cp profiles and the corresponding interaction parameters for that complex and have compared the various parameters with the corresponding ones previously reported for the alpha-ketoglutarate ternary complex. While the overall delta G values of the two ternary complexes differ only slightly, the enzyme-NADPH-oxalylglycine ternary complex appears to achieve much of its stability from a very tight enzyme-oxalylglycine binary complex with little or no contribution from favorable interactions in the ternary complex, while the alpha-ketoglutarate ternary complex appears to achieve the same stability by a large interaction starting from a very weak enzyme-alpha-ketoglutarate binary complex. Consideration of the enthalpic profiles, however, show that this delta G-derived picture is deceptive. The excess binding energy which stabilizes the oxalylglycine binary is in fact due to hydrogen bonding of the amide group of oxalylglycine to the enzyme; in forming the ternary complex, this hydrogen bonding is lost in favor of forming an oxalylglycine-NADPH interaction, which is very similar to the alpha-ketoglutarate-NADPH interaction which stabilizes the alpha-ketoglutarate ternary complex. We conclude that the alpha-ketoglutarate-NADPH interaction must depend on either hydrogen bonding to or steric hindrance by the ketone group and that the existence of this energetically large interaction cannot be ascribed to imine formation between the keto group and enzyme. These findings also indicate the locus on the reaction coordinate where the reduced coenzyme plays a critical role, a role other than its obvious function as a hydride donor."
https://openalex.org/W1596762963,"Chicken muscle AMP aminohydrolase is cleared rapidly from the circulation of chickens after intravenous injection of the purified enzyme (Husic, H. D., and Suelter, C. H. (1980) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 95, 228-235). After the intravenous injection of unlabeled, 125I-labeled, or [14C]sucrose-labeled AMP aminohydrolase, enzyme activity and radioactivity are cleared at the same rates and concentrate in the liver and spleen. After injection of the [14C]sucrose-labeled enzyme, 14C is retained in the liver and spleen and low molecular weight 14C is recovered primarily in a fraction which cosediments with lysosomes when tissue homogenates are sedimented on sucrose density gradients. When liver cells are fractionated after clearance of [14C]sucrose-labeled enzyme, 14C is recovered primarily in the parenchymal cells. The circulatory clearance of AMP aminohydrolase is inhibited by heparin and other sulfated polysaccharides, but not by compounds which inhibit previously described carbohydrate-mediated systems for the uptake of circulatory glycoproteins. Heparin injection after the clearance of AMP aminohydrolase causes the release of the enzyme from the liver and spleen into the circulation. When heparin is injected at various times after clearance, decreasing amounts of enzyme are released with time; these results show that the enzyme is internalized with a half-life of 0.98 h."

(1980) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 95, 228-235). The enzyme is not inactivated before clearance, the clearance is inhibited by sulfated polysaccharides, and the enzyme is cleared primarily by the spleen and the parenchymal cells of the liver where it is internalized and degraded in lysosomes (Husic, H.D., and Suelter, C.H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 4359-4364). The binding of AMP aminohydrolase to hepatocyte monolayers in vitro at 4 degrees C is saturable with a dissociation constant of 11.3 X 10(-8) M; there are 2.6 X 10(6) AMP aminohydrolase binding sites/hepatocyte. The interaction of the enzyme with hepatocyte monolayers is inhibited by sulfated polysaccharides, effectors of its enzymatic activity and high salt concentrations; various monosaccharides had little effect on the binding of the enzyme to hepatocyte monolayers. Heparitinase treatment of hepatocyte monolayers abolished 77% of the binding of the enzyme. Heparin promotes the dissociation of 125I-labeled or [14C]sucrose-labeled enzyme bound to the cell surface; radioactivity which is not dissociated by heparin is assumed to be internalized at 37 degrees C. Low molecular weight 125I-labeled degradation products are released into the media with time when the 125I-labeled enzyme, bound to hepatocytes at 4 degrees C, is incubated at 37 degrees C; when [14C]sucrose-labeled enzyme is incubated with hepatocytes at 37 degrees C, low molecular weight 14C-labeled degradation products are not released into the media but instead accumulate in the cells. The half-life for internalization of the bound enzyme based on this rate of accumulation is 0.77 h. These results suggest that glycosaminoglycans are involved in the binding of AMP aminohydrolase to the hepatocyte cell surface and that the bound enzyme is internalized and degraded."
