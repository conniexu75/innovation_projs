https://openalex.org/W3206922912,"Anosmia, the loss of smell, is a common and often the sole symptom of COVID-19. The onset of the sequence of pathobiological events leading to olfactory dysfunction remains obscure. Here, we have developed a postmortem bedside surgical procedure to harvest endoscopically samples of respiratory and olfactory mucosae and whole olfactory bulbs. Our cohort of 85 cases included COVID-19 patients who died a few days after infection with SARS-CoV-2, enabling us to catch the virus while it was still replicating. We found that sustentacular cells are the major target cell type in the olfactory mucosa. We failed to find evidence for infection of olfactory sensory neurons, and the parenchyma of the olfactory bulb is spared as well. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 does not appear to be a neurotropic virus. We postulate that transient insufficient support from sustentacular cells triggers transient olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19. Olfactory sensory neurons would become affected without getting infected."
https://openalex.org/W3212895337,"The hippocampal-entorhinal system supports cognitive functions, has lifelong neurogenic capabilities in many species, and is selectively vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease. To investigate neurogenic potential and cellular diversity, we profiled single-nucleus transcriptomes in five hippocampal-entorhinal subregions in humans, macaques, and pigs. Integrated cross-species analysis revealed robust transcriptomic and histologic signatures of neurogenesis in the adult mouse, pig, and macaque but not humans. Doublecortin (DCX), a widely accepted marker of newly generated granule cells, was detected in diverse human neurons, but it did not define immature neuron populations. To explore species differences in cellular diversity and implications for disease, we characterized subregion-specific, transcriptomically defined cell types and transitional changes from the three-layered archicortex to the six-layered neocortex. Notably, METTL7B defined subregion-specific excitatory neurons and astrocytes in primates, associated with endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplet proteins, including Alzheimer's disease-related proteins. This resource reveals cell-type- and species-specific properties shaping hippocampal-entorhinal neurogenesis and function."
https://openalex.org/W3213413722,"Last year observed a global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2) infection affecting millions of individuals worldwide. There is an urgent unmet need to provide an easily producible and affordable medicine to prevent transmission and provide early treatment for this disease. Since the nasal cavity and the rhinopharynx are the sites of initial replication of SARS-CoV-2, a nasal spray may be an effective option to target SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we tested the antiviral action of three candidate nasal spray formulations against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. We determined that iota-carrageenan in concentrations as low as 6 μg/mL inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The concentrations of iota-carrageenan with activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro may be easily achieved through the application of nasal sprays as commonly used in several countries. Recently a double-blind, placebo-controlled study showed that iota-carrageenan in isotonic sodium chloride reduces ca. five times the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in health care personnel. Further, xylitol at a concentration of 50 mg/mL (ca. 329 mM) was found to exert some antiviral action, though this preliminary finding needs further confirmation."
https://openalex.org/W3133174712,"Oxysterols (OHCs) are hydroxylated cholesterol metabolites that play ubiquitous roles in health and disease. Due to the non-covalent nature of their interactions and their unique partitioning in membranes, the analysis of live-cell, proteome-wide interactions of OHCs remains an unmet challenge. Here, we present a structurally precise chemoproteomics probe for the biologically active molecule 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol (20(S)-OHC) and provide a map of its proteome-wide targets in the membranes of living cells. Our target catalog consolidates diverse OHC ontologies and demonstrates that OHC-interacting proteins cluster with specific processes in immune response and cancer. Competition experiments reveal that 20(S)-OHC is a chemo-, regio- and stereoselective ligand for the protein transmembrane protein 97 (Tmem97/the σ2 receptor), enabling us to reconstruct the 20(S)-OHC–Tmem97 binding site. Our results demonstrate that multiplexed, quantitative analysis of cellular target engagement can expose new dimensions of metabolite activity and identify actionable targets for molecular therapy. A chemoproteomics profile of the human metabolite 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol exposes its broad connections to the immune system and cancer, revealing it to be a highly selective ligand for the orphan receptor Tmem97 (the σ2 receptor)."
https://openalex.org/W3212868907,"Breast cancer is the cancer most often diagnosed in women. MicroRNAs (MIRs) are short RNA molecules that bind mRNA resulting in their downregulation. MIR21 has been shown to be an oncomiR in most cancer types, including breast cancer. Most of the effects of miR-21 have been attributed to hsa-miR-21-5p that is transcribed from the leading strand of MIR21, but hsa-miR-21-3p (miR-21-3p), transcribed from the lagging strand, is much less studied. The aim of the study is to analyze whether expression of miR-21-3p is prognostic for breast cancer. MiR-21-3p association with survival, clinical and pathological characteristics was analyzed in a large breast cancer cohort and validated in three separate cohorts, including TCGA and METABRIC. Analytical tools were also used to infer miR-21-3p function and to identify potential target genes and functional pathways. The results showed that in the exploration cohort, high miR-21-3p levels associated with shorter survival and lymph node positivity. In the three validation cohorts, high miR-21-3p levels associated with pathological characteristics that predict worse prognosis. Specifically, in the largest validation cohort, METABRIC (n = 1174), high miR-21-3p levels associated with large tumors, a high grade, lymph node and HER2 positivity, and shorter breast-cancer-specific survival (HR = 1.38, CI 1.13–1.68). This association remained significant after adjusting for confounding factors. The genes with expression levels that correlated with miR-21-3p were enriched in particular pathways, including the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and proliferation. Among the most significantly downregulated targets were MAT2A and the tumor suppressive genes STARD13 and ZNF132. The results from this study emphasize that both 3p- and 5p-arms from a MIR warrant independent study. The data show that miR-21-3p overexpression in breast tumors is a marker of worse breast cancer progression and it affects genes in pathways that drive breast cancer by down-regulating tumor suppressor genes. The results suggest miR-21-3p as a potential biomarker."
https://openalex.org/W3214352270,"The wellbeing of sexual and gender minority (SGM) medical students and the impact of their experiences on career trajectory remain poorly understood. The present study aimed to characterize the incidence of mistreatment in SGM trainees as well as general perspectives on the acceptance of SGM individuals across medical and surgical specialties.This was a cross sectional survey study of all actively enrolled medical students within the six University of California campuses conducted in March 2021. An online, survey tool captured incidence of bullying, discrimination, and suicidal ideation as well as perceived acceptance of SGM identities across specialties measured by slider scale. Differences between SGM and non-SGM respondents were assessed with two-tailed and chi-square tests. Qualitative responses were evaluated utilizing a multi-stage, cutting-and-sorting technique.Of approximately 3,205 students eligible for participation, 383 submitted completed surveys, representing a response rate of 12.0%. Of these respondents, 26.9% (n = 103) identified as a sexual or gender minority. Overall, SGM trainees reported higher slider scale scores when asked about being bullied by other students (20.0 vs. 13.9, P = 0.012) and contemplating suicide (14.8 vs. 8.8, P = 0.005). Compared to all other specialties, general surgery and surgical subspecialties had the lowest mean slider scale score (52.8) in perceived acceptance of SGM identities (All P < 0.001). In qualitative responses, students frequently cited lack of diversity as contributing to this perception. Additionally, 67.0% of SGM students had concerns that disclosure of identity would affect their future career with 18.5% planning to not disclose during the residency application process.Overall, SGM respondents reported higher incidences of bullying and suicidal ideation as well as increased self-censorship stemming from concerns regarding career advancement, most prominently in surgery. To address such barriers, institutions must actively promote diversity in sexual preference and gender identity regardless of specialty."
https://openalex.org/W3213932206,"Stunting is still a major public health problem in low- and middle-income countries, including Indonesia. Previous studies have reported the complexities associated with understanding the determinants of stunting. This study aimed to examine the household-, subdistrict- and province-level determinants of stunting in Indonesia using a multilevel hierarchical mixed effects model.We analyzed data for 8045 children taken from the 2007 and 2014 waves of the Indonesian Family and Life Surveys (IFLS). We included individual-, family-/household- and community-level variables in the analyses. A multilevel mixed effects model was employed to take into account the hierarchical structure of the data. Moreover, the model captured the effect of unobserved household-, subdistrict- and province-level characteristics on the probability of children being stunted.Our findings showed that the odds of childhood stunting vary significantly not only by individual child- and household-level characteristics but also by province- and subdistrict-level characteristics. Among the child-level covariates included in our model, dietary habits, neonatal weight, a history of infection, and sex significantly affected the risk of stunting. Household wealth status and parental education are significant household-level covariates associated with a higher risk of stunting. Finally, the risk of stunting is higher for children living in communities without access to water, sanitation and hygiene.Stunting is associated with not only child-level characteristics but also family- and community-level characteristics. Hence, interventions to reduce stunting should also take into account family and community characteristics to achieve effective outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3214004300,"Activation of the programmed cell death protein 1 and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) signaling axis plays important roles in intrinsic or acquired resistance to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-directed therapies in the clinic. Therefore, therapies simultaneously targeting both HER2 and PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathways are of great significance. Here, aiming to direct the anti-PD-L1 responses toward HER2-expressing tumor cells, we constructed a humanized bispecific IgG1 subclass antibody targeting both HER2 and PD-L1 (HER2/PD-L1; BsAb), which displayed satisfactory purity, thermostability, and serum stability. We found that BsAb showed enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity in vitro. In the late phase of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-humanized HER2+ tumor xenograft models, BsAb showed superior therapeutic efficacies as compared with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or combination treatment strategies. In cynomolgus monkeys, BsAb showed favorable pharmacokinetics and toxicity profiles when administered at a 10 mg/kg dosage. Thus, HER2/PD-L1 BsAb was demonstrated as a potentially effective option for managing HER2+ and trastuzumab-resistant tumors in the clinic. We propose that the enhanced antitumor activities of BsAb in vivo may be due to direct inhibition of HER2 signaling or activation of T cells."
https://openalex.org/W3213558593,"The measures implemented by governments worldwide to control and prevent the spread of the COVID-19 have impacted the populations and directly influenced individuals' quality of life and consumption habits.This work investigates the Portuguese population's changes in alcohol, stimulants drinks, illegal substances, and pharmaceutical consumptions habits during the COVID-19 pandemic.An online questionnaire comprising seven groups of questions-with one group referring to alcohol, stimulant drinks, illegal substances, and pharmaceuticals consumption habits-was made available to the general adult population of mainland Portugal from the 26th January through the 31st of March 2021. After applying the inclusion criteria, 1666 questionnaires were selected and analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics.Our results show that 48.9% of the participants have alcohol drinking habits and increased their alcohol consumption by 16% after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Furthermore, 8.7% of the respondents felt the need to increase their consumption of stimulant drinks, especially coffee, the most consumed stimulant drink (77.9%). We also observed that of the 3.1% of respondents who are usual consumers of illegal substances, 26.9% increased their consumption of these substances during the COVID-19 pandemic. Concerning pharmaceuticals, 23.2% of the respondents expressed their need to take a therapeutic drug after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The profile of common consumers of alcohol, stimulant drinks, illegal substances, and pharmaceuticals in the COVID-19 pandemic context is contrasting and varies according to gender, age, and employment status.The COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in the consumption of alcohol, stimulant drinks, illegal substances, and pharmaceuticals prescribed to treat anxiety, depression, and sleep changes in the Portuguese population. These new consumption patterns have probably aggravated domestic violence, mental diseases, and impairment of family quality of life in the Portuguese population."
https://openalex.org/W3211873923,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly threatening to patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on intermittent hemodialysis and their care providers. Hemodialysis patients who receive life-sustaining medical therapy in healthcare settings, face unique challenges as they need to be at a dialysis unit three or more times a week, where they are confined to specific settings and tended to by dialysis nurses and staff with physical interaction and in close proximity. Despite the importance and critical situation of the dialysis units, modelling studies of the SARS-CoV-2 spread in these settings are very limited. In this paper, we have used a combination of discrete event and agent-based simulation models, to study the operations of a typical large dialysis unit and generate contact matrices to examine outbreak scenarios. We present the details of the contact matrix generation process and demonstrate how the simulation calculates a micro-scale contact matrix comprising the number and duration of contacts at a micro-scale time step. We have used the contacts matrix in an agent-based model to predict disease transmission under different scenarios. The results show that micro-simulation can be used to estimate contact matrices, which can be used effectively for disease modelling in dialysis and similar settings."
https://openalex.org/W3213021611,"This study was conducted to examine digestibility of insect meals for Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) and their utilization as fish meal substitutes. The tested insect meals were mealworm, silkworm, black soldier fly, rice grasshopper, two-spotted cricket, dynastid beetle and white-spotted flower chafer. Apparent digestibility coefficients of the tested insect meals were 83-89% for protein, 91-98% for lipid, 84-90% for energy, 77-81% for dry matter, 28-36% for chitin, 76-96% for amino acids and 89-93% for fatty acids. The amino acid availability of insect meals was high in taurine (93-96%), arginine (91-95%) and lysine (90-95%). Availability of fatty acids were 89-93% for saturated fatty acids, 90-93% for monounsaturated fatty acids and 88-93% for polyunsaturated fatty acids. For a feeding trial, a control diet was formulated using 27% tuna byproduct meal as a fish meal source and seven other diets were prepared replacing 10% tuna byproduct meal in the control diet with each insect meal. Triplicate groups of shrimp (initial body weight: 0.17 g) were fed the diets for 65 days. The growth performance was significantly improved when the shrimp were fed black soldier fly or dynastid beetle included diet. Dietary supplementation of insect meals significantly improved non-specific immune responses and antioxidant enzyme activity in the shrimp. These results indicate that the tested insect meals have high potentials to be used as a protein source that could replace fish meal in diets for the shrimp."
https://openalex.org/W3212352576,"Influenza is a major concern in hospitals, including the emergency department (ED), mainly because of a high risk for ED personnel to acquire and transmit the disease. Although influenza vaccination is recommended for health care workers, vaccination coverage is low.This survey was conducted in the 2016/2017 and 2020/2021 influenza seasons. Questionnaires were sent to ED personnel in 12 hospitals in Bavaria, South-Eastern Germany. The response rates were 62% and 38% in 2016/2017 and 2020/2021, respectively. Data were compared between the two seasons as well as between vaccinated and not vaccinated respondents in 2020/2021.Significantly more ED personnel reported having been vaccinated in the 2020/2021 season. Factors associated with vaccination coverage (or the intention to get vaccinated) were profession (physician / medical student), having been vaccinated at least twice, the availability of an influenza vaccination on site (in the ED) as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, significant differences in the assessment and evaluation of influenza, its vaccination side effects and ethical aspects were found between vaccinated and not vaccinated ED personnel in 2020/2021. Unvaccinated respondents estimated higher frequencies of almost all potential vaccination side effects, were less likely to accept lay-offs if employees would not come to work during an influenza pandemic and more likely to agree that work attendance should be an employee´s decision. Vaccinated participants instead, rather agreed that vaccination should be mandatory and were less likely to consider job changes in case of a mandatory vaccination policy.The COVID-19 pandemic might have contributed to a higher influenza vaccination rate among ED workers. Vaccination on site and interventions targeting the perception of influenza vaccination and its side effects may be most promising to increase the vaccination coverage among ED personnel."

https://openalex.org/W3211656378,"The axon initial segment (AIS) responsible for action potential initiation is a dynamic structure that varies and changes together with neuronal excitability. Like other neuron types, alpha motoneurons in the mammalian spinal cord express heterogeneity and plasticity in AIS geometry, including length (AISl) and distance from soma (AISd). The present study aimed to establish the relationship of AIS geometry with a measure of intrinsic excitability, rheobase current, that varies by 20-fold or more among normal motoneurons. We began by determining whether AIS length or distance differed for motoneurons in motor pools that exhibit different activity profiles. Motoneurons sampled from the medial gastrocnemius (MG) motor pool exhibited values for average AISd that were significantly greater than that for motoneurons from the soleus (SOL) motor pool, which is more readily recruited in low-level activities. Next, we tested whether AISd covaried with intrinsic excitability of individual motoneurons. In anesthetized rats, we measured rheobase current intracellularly from MG motoneurons in vivo before labeling them for immunohistochemical study of AIS structure. For 16 motoneurons sampled from the MG motor pool, this combinatory approach revealed that AISd, but not AISl, was significantly related to rheobase, as AIS tended to be located further from the soma on motoneurons that were less excitable. Although a causal relation with excitability seems unlikely, AISd falls among a constellation of properties related to the recruitability of motor units and their parent motoneurons."
https://openalex.org/W3212840423,"To know the experiences of Venezuelan migrant women living in shelters in Roraima state at the northwestern border between Venezuela and Brazil regarding situations of violence as part of the dynamics of everyday life.Data were collected in January 2020 through 12 focus group discussions (FGDs) with 5 to 14 Venezuelan migrant women aged 18-49 years old living transitorily in five shelters established by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Brazilian government. We obtained individual and shared views on the experiences regarding violence that migrant women may experience in their everyday life. To organize the FGDs, variations in age and the time women were living at the shelters were considered. All FGDs were held in a place at the shelter that guaranteed privacy and secrecy so that women could express themselves freely. The initial question was broad and open ended and was followed by more specific questions about situations of domestic violence and other types of violence.The main themes identified were the following: i) women's perceptions on domestic violence, ii) women's perceptions on how humanitarian organizations were managing the episodes of domestic violence, and iii) situations considered violence in everyday life at the shelters. The FGDs showed that the reported violence inside the shelters was high, and several forms of violence emerged. Violence was identified as physical aggression and psychological threats, and violence in everyday life at the shelter included xenophobia when the migrants went outside the shelters that was perceived and described as violence.According to the perspective of Venezuelan migrant women violence was part of everyday life among those living in the UNHCR shelters at the northwestern border of Brazil-Venezuela. These women are not comfortable with this situation, and it is difficult for them to understand and handle the episodes of violence."
https://openalex.org/W3212964263,"With the intent to better management human wildlife conflict (HWC) and wildlife conservation in mid-hills outside protected areas of Gandaki province, Nepal, we analyzed the patterns and drivers of HWC. Using data collected from literature, government records and questionnaire survey, we investigated temporal, seasonal and spatial distribution of human casualties caused by wildlife attacks. We also appraised the perception of local people towards wildlife conservation. We have recorded 77 cases (69 human injuries and 8 mortalities) during the period of nine year between 2011 and 2019. The number of wildlife attacks increased over this period. Wildlife attacks were more frequent in winter with 50% (42) of attacks occurred between September and December. Common leopard (Panthera pardus) and Himalayan black bear (Ursus thibetanus laniger) were the major species involved in these conflicts. Common leopard was the most feared species that causes highest number of human mortalities (87%, n = 67); the most severe type of HWC outcome. Forty-eight percent (n = 37) attacks were reported at human settlement areas followed by 27% attacks in agriculture land (n = 21) and 24% (n = 19) in forest. Generalized linear model analysis on spatial variables showed that the probability of human attacks increases with decreasing elevation (β = -0.0021, Z = -1.762, p = 0.078) and distance from the forest (β = -0.608, Z = -0.789, p = 0.429). We recommend to decrease habitat degradation / fragmentation, carry out habitat management program within forest to increase prey availability to decrease the wildlife invasion into human settlement area, and decrease dependency of people on forest resources by providing alternative livelihood opportunities. Simplified relief fund distribution mechanism at local level also helps alleviate the impact of HWC. The knowledge obtained by this study and management measures are important for better human-wildlife co-existence."
https://openalex.org/W3214159517,"Overdose prescription errors sometimes cause serious life-threatening adverse drug events, while underdose errors lead to diminished therapeutic effects. Therefore, it is important to detect and prevent these errors. In the present study, we used the one-class support vector machine (OCSVM), one of the most common unsupervised machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection, to identify overdose and underdose prescriptions. We extracted prescription data from electronic health records in Kyushu University Hospital between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2019. We constructed an OCSVM model for each of the 21 candidate drugs using three features: age, weight, and dose. Clinical overdose and underdose prescriptions, which were identified and rectified by pharmacists before administration, were collected. Synthetic overdose and underdose prescriptions were created using the maximum and minimum doses, defined by drug labels or the UpToDate database. We applied these prescription data to the OCSVM model and evaluated its detection performance. We also performed comparative analysis with other unsupervised outlier detection algorithms (local outlier factor, isolation forest, and robust covariance). Twenty-seven out of 31 clinical overdose and underdose prescriptions (87.1%) were detected as abnormal by the model. The constructed OCSVM models showed high performance for detecting synthetic overdose prescriptions (precision 0.986, recall 0.964, and F-measure 0.973) and synthetic underdose prescriptions (precision 0.980, recall 0.794, and F-measure 0.839). In comparative analysis, OCSVM showed the best performance. Our models detected the majority of clinical overdose and underdose prescriptions and demonstrated high performance in synthetic data analysis. OCSVM models, constructed using features such as age, weight, and dose, are useful for detecting overdose and underdose prescriptions."
https://openalex.org/W3213118298,"Rupture of the scapholunate interosseous ligament can cause the dissociation of scaphoid and lunate bones, resulting in impaired wrist function. Current treatments (e.g., tendon-based surgical reconstruction, screw-based fixation, fusion, or carpectomy) may restore wrist stability, but do not address regeneration of the ruptured ligament, and may result in wrist functional limitations and osteoarthritis. Recently a novel multiphasic bone-ligament-bone scaffold was proposed, which aims to reconstruct the ruptured ligament, and which can be 3D-printed using medical-grade polycaprolactone. This scaffold is composed of a central ligament-scaffold section and features a bone attachment terminal at either end. Since the ligament-scaffold is the primary load bearing structure during physiological wrist motion, its geometry, mechanical properties, and the surgical placement of the scaffold are critical for performance optimisation. This study presents a patient-specific computational biomechanical evaluation of the effect of scaffold length, and positioning of the bone attachment sites. Through segmentation and image processing of medical image data for natural wrist motion, detailed 3D geometries as well as patient-specific physiological wrist motion could be derived. This data formed the input for detailed finite element analysis, enabling computational of scaffold stress and strain distributions, which are key predictors of scaffold structural integrity. The computational analysis demonstrated that longer scaffolds present reduced peak scaffold stresses and a more homogeneous stress state compared to shorter scaffolds. Furthermore, it was found that scaffolds attached at proximal sites experience lower stresses than those attached at distal sites. However, scaffold length, rather than bone terminal location, most strongly influences peak stress. For each scaffold terminal placement configuration, a basic metric was computed indicative of bone fracture risk. This metric was the minimum distance from the bone surface to the internal scaffold bone terminal. Analysis of this minimum bone thickness data confirmed further optimisation of terminal locations is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4226266345,"Directed base substitution with base editing technology enables efficient and programmable conversion of C:G or A:T base pairs to T:A or G:C in the genome. Although this technology has shown great potentials in a variety of basic research, off-target editing is among one of the biggest challenges toward its way to clinical application. Base editing tools, especially the tools converting C to T, caused unpredictable off-target editing throughout the genome, which raise the concern that long-term application of these tools would induce genomic instability or even tumorigenesis. To overcome this challenge, we designed an inducible base editing tool that was active only in the presence of a clinically safe chemical, rapamycin. In the guidance of structural information, we designed four split-human APOBEC3A (A3A) -BE3 base editors in which these A3A deaminase enzymes were split at sites that were opposite to the protein-nucleotide interface. We showed that by inducible deaminase reconstruction with a rapamycin responsible interaction system (FRB and FKBP); three out of four split-A3A-derived base editors showed robust inducible base editing. However, in the absence of rapamycin, their editing ability was dramatically inhibited. Among these split editors, splicing at Aa85 of A3A generated the most efficient inducible editing. In addition, compared to the full-length base editor, the splitting did not obviously alter the editing window and motif preference, but slightly increased the product purity. We also expanded this strategy to another frequently used cytosine deaminase, rat APOBEC1 (rA1), and observed a similar induction response. In summary, these results demonstrated the concept that splitting deaminases is a practicable method for timely controlling of base editing tools."
https://openalex.org/W3211611627,"Lactobacillus paragasseri was identified as a novel sister taxon of L. gasseri in 2018. Since the reclassification of L. paragasseri, there has been hardly any report describing the probiotic properties of this species. In this study, an L. paragasseri strain UBLG-36 was sequenced and analyzed to determine the molecular basis that may confer the bacteria with probiotic potential. UBLG-36 was previously documented as an L. gasseri strain. Average nucleotide identity and phylogenomic analysis allowed accurate taxonomic identification of UBLG-36 as an L. paragasseri strain. Analysis of the draft genome (~1.94 Mb) showed that UBLG-36 contains 5 contigs with an average G+C content of 34.85%. Genes essential for the biosynthesis of bacteriocins, adhesion to host epithelium, stress resistance, host immunomodulation, defense, and carbohydrate metabolism were identified in the genome. Interestingly, L. paragasseri UBLG-36 also harbored genes that code for enzymes involved in oxalate catabolism, such as formyl coenzyme A transferase (frc) and oxalyl coenzyme A decarboxylase (oxc). In vitro oxalate degradation assay showed that UBLG-36 is highly effective in degrading oxalate (averaging more than 45% degradation), a feature that has not been reported before. As a recently identified bacterium, there are limited genomic reports on L. paragasseri, and our draft genome sequence analysis is the first to describe and emphasize the probiotic potential and oxalate degrading ability of this species. With results supporting the probiotic functionalities and oxalate catabolism of UBLG-36, we propose that this strain is likely to have immense biotechnological applications upon appropriate characterization."
https://openalex.org/W3211885670,"The genus Bursera, includes ~100 shrub and trees species in tropical dry forests with its center of diversification and endemism in Mexico. Morphologically intermediate individuals have commonly been observed in Mexican Bursera in areas where closely related species coexist. These individuals are assumed to result from interspecific hybridization, but no molecular evidence has supported their hybrid origins. This study aimed to investigate the existence of interspecific hybridization among three Mexican Bursera species (Bullockia section: B. cuneata, B. palmeri and B. bipinnata) from nine populations based on DNA sequences (three nuclear and four chloroplast regions) and ecological niche modeling for three past and two future scenario projections. Results from the only two polymorphic nuclear regions (PEPC, ETS) supported the hybrid origin of morphologically intermediate individuals and revealed that B. cuneata and B. bipinnata are the parental species that are genetically closer to the putative hybrids. Ecological niche modeling accurately predicted the occurrence of putative hybrid populations and showed a potential hybrid zone extending in a larger area (74,000 km2) than previously thought. Paleo-reconstructions showed a potential hybrid zone existing from the Last Glacial Maximum (~ 21 kya) that has increased since the late Holocene to the present. Future ecological niche projections show an increment of suitability of the potential hybrid zone for 2050 and 2070 relative to the present. Hybrid zone changes responded mostly to an increase in elevational ranges. Our study provides the first insight of an extensive hybrid zone among three Mexican Bursera species based on molecular data and ecological niche modeling."
https://openalex.org/W3211984885,"The discovery of oxidative cleavage of recalcitrant polysaccharides by lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) has affected the study and industrial application of enzymatic biomass processing. Despite being widespread in fungi, LPMOs belonging to the auxiliary activity (AA) family AA11 have been understudied. While these LPMOs are considered chitin active, some family members have little or no activity toward chitin, and the only available crystal structure of an AA11 LPMO lacks features found in bacterial chitin-active AA10 LPMOs. Here, we report structural and functional characteristics of a single-domain AA11 LPMO from Aspergillus fumigatus, AfAA11A. The crystal structure shows a substrate-binding surface with features resembling those of known chitin-active LPMOs. Indeed, despite the absence of a carbohydrate-binding module, AfAA11A has considerable affinity for α-chitin and, more so, β-chitin. AfAA11A is active toward both these chitin allomorphs and enhances chitin degradation by an endoacting chitinase, in particular for α-chitin. The catalytic activity of AfAA11A on chitin increases when supplying reactions with hydrogen peroxide, showing that, like LPMOs from other families, AfAA11A has peroxygenase activity. These results show that, in stark contrast to the previously characterized AfAA11B from the same organism, AfAA11A likely plays a role in fungal chitin turnover. Thus, members of the hitherto rather enigmatic family of AA11 LPMOs show considerable structural and functional differences and may have multiple roles in fungal physiology."

We developed and studied the feasibility of using a mobile App to collect daily data on COVID-19 symptoms and people's movements.We used an open source software ""KoBo Toolbox"" to develop the App and installed it on low cost smart mobile phones. We named this App ""Wetaase"" (""protect yourself""). The App was tested on 30 selected households from 3 densely populated areas of Kampala, Uganda, and followed them for 3 months. One trained member per household captured the data in the App for each enrolled member and uploaded it to a virtual server on a daily basis. The App is embedded with an algorithm that flags participants who report fever and any other COVID-19 related symptom.A total of 101 participants were enrolled; 61% female; median age 23 (interquartile range (IQR): 17-36) years. Usage of the App was 78% (95% confidence interval (CI): 77.0%-78.8%). It increased from 40% on day 1 to a peak of 81% on day 45 and then declined to 59% on day 90. Usage of the App did not significantly vary by site, sex or age. Only 57/6617 (0.86%) records included a report of at least one of the 17 listed COVID-19 related symptoms. The most reported symptom was flu/runny nose (21%) followed by sneezing (15%), with the rest ranging between 2% and 7%. Reports on movements away from home were 45% with 74% going to markets or shops. The participants liked the ""Wetaase"" App and recommended it for use as an alert system for COVID-19.Usage of the ""Wetaase"" App was high (78%) and it was similar across the three study sites, sex and age groups. Reporting of symptoms related to COVID-19 was low. Movements were mainly to markets and shops. Users reported that the App was easy to use and recommended its scale up. We recommend that this App be assessed at a large scale for feasibility, usability and acceptability as an additional tool for increasing alerts on COVID-19 in Uganda and similar settings."
https://openalex.org/W3214611768,"Breakdown of gut barrier integrity has been associated with inflammatory activation and is implicated in the etiology of several chronic medical conditions. Acute exercise is known to increase gut barrier permeability but the impact of chronic exercise is not clear. Most studies to date have examined how acute exercise impacts gut barrier integrity in healthy adults, while few studies have examined the impact of chronic exercise in older adults with comorbidities. We aim to investigate the impact of a 12-week program of aerobic and resistance training on biomarkers of gut barrier integrity in a sample of older adults with coronary artery disease.Participants were adults with coronary artery disease undergoing a moderate-intensity 12-week cardiac rehabilitation exercise program. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and study termination. Serum levels of biomarkers of gut barrier integrity (zonulin and fatty acid-binding protein 2 (FABP2)) were measured by ELISA. Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed by peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) at study start & completion. Data analyses were performed using SPSS software version 24.0.Among study participants (n = 41, 70% male, age = 62.7± 9.35) we found a significant negative association between baseline FABP2 levels and baseline VO2peak in a multiple linear regression model adjusting for covariates (B = -0.3, p = 0.009). Over the course of the exercise program an increase in VO2peak (≥ 5 mL/kg/min) was independently associated with a relative decrease in FABP2 (B = -0.45, p = 0.018) after controlling for medical covariates.Our findings indicate that an increase in cardiorespiratory fitness during a 12-week exercise program resulted in a relative improvement in a biomarker of gut barrier integrity. This indicates a potential mechanism by which longer term exercise may improve gut barrier integrity."
https://openalex.org/W3211681942,"Background Assessment of parental satisfaction with child nursing is the key issue in evaluation of the care quality, enabling the adjustment of the services provided to the needs and expectations of recipients, and thus ensuring safety and achieving better long-term health effects. Aim Assessment of parental satisfaction with child nursing in paediatric wards including its determinants. Material and methods The study covered 1030 parents of children hospitalised in paediatric and surgical wards of seven hospitals of different levels of health security in Poland. The Polish adaptation of the Empathic standardised questionnaire for assessment of the level of parents’ satisfaction with nursing care, developed by Latour et al. and the self-constructed summary of socio-demographic data were applied in the study. Results More than 90% of respondents expressed high level of satisfaction with nurses’ Availability, the lowest, but still high score of respondents’ satisfaction was observed for Parental Participation. The highest satisfaction was observed among the parents of children at the preschool, early school and puberty stage, admitted to the hospital on the elective basis, referred for diagnostic assessment and with the length of hospital stay less than 7 and longer than 28 days. Achieving preschool age was the strongest factor which increased assessment of satisfaction in most domains. Conclusions There is a need for optimising nursing care especially in the area of parental participation. The nursing care’ quality improvement plan in paediatric departments should focus particularly on early childhood patients and their parents who are the most critical in satisfaction’ assessment."

This study investigated the effects of immune molecules on the prognosis of CRLM. We enrolled 71 patients with CRLM who underwent curative resection for CRC. We used immunohistochemistry to analyze the expression of PD-1, PD-L1, indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and CD163 (a marker of tumor-associated macrophages [TAMs]) in metastatic tumors. The immune molecules PD-1, PD-L1, IDO, and TAMs were expressed in 32.3%, 47.8%, 45.0%, and 47.9% of metastatic CRC samples, respectively. The 5-year overall survival rates associated with immune molecule-positive groups were significantly better than in the negative groups (PD-1: 87.7% vs 53.2%, p = 0.023; PD-L1: 82.4% vs 42.3%, p = 0.007; IDO: 80.7% vs 43.5%, p = 0.007; TAMs: 82.6% vs 48.0%, p = 0.005). Multivariate analysis revealed PD-1 expression (p = 0.032, hazard ratio: 0.19), IDO expression (p = 0.049, hazard ratio: 0.37), and tumor differentiation (p<0.001, hazard ratio: 0.02) as independent prognostic indicators. PD-1 and TAMs in metastases were associated with less aggressive features such as smaller tumors. Furthermore, TAMs positively and significantly correlated with PD-1 expression (p = 0.011), PD-L1 expression (p = 0.024), and tended to correlate with IDO expression (p = 0.078). PD-1, PD-L1, IDO, and TAMs in CRLM were associated with less aggressive features and better prognosis of patients with CRC, indicating adaptive antitumor immunity vs immune tolerance. These molecules may therefore serve as prognostic markers for CRLM."
https://openalex.org/W3212503462,"Anthrax is a worldwide zoonotic disease. Anthrax has long been a public health and socio-economic issue in Mongolia. Presently, there is no spatial information on carcass burial sites as a potential hazard of future anthrax outbreaks and possible risk factors associated with anthrax occurrences in Mongolia. Here, we analyze retrospective data (1986-2015) on the disposal sites of livestock carcasses to describe historical spatio-temporal patterns of livestock anthrax in Khuvsgul Province, which showed the highest anthrax incidence rate in Mongolia. From the results of spatial mean and standard deviational ellipse analyses, we found that the anthrax spatial distribution in livestock did not change over the study period, indicating a localized source of exposure. The multi-distance spatial cluster analysis showed that carcass sites distributed in the study area are clustered. Using kernel density estimation analysis on carcass sites, we identified two anthrax hotspots in low-lying areas around the south and north regions. Notably, this study disclosed a new hotspot in the northern part that emerged in the last decade of the 30-year study period. The highest proportion of cases was recorded in cattle, whose prevalence per area was highest in six districts (i.e., Murun, Chandmani-Undur, Khatgal, Ikh-Uul, Tosontsengel, and Tsagaan-Uul), suggesting that vaccination should prioritize cattle in these districts. Furthermore, size of outbreaks was influenced by the annual summer mean air temperature of Khuvsgul Province, probably by affecting the permafrost freeze-thawing activity."
https://openalex.org/W3212719042,"Anti-tubulin agents, such as paclitaxel, have been used extensively for treatment of several types of cancer, including ovarian, lung, breast, and pancreatic cancers. Despite their wide use in cancer treatment, however, patient response is highly variable and drug resistance remains a major clinical issue. Protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) plays a critical role in immune response to viral infection. We identified PKR as a phospho-protein in response to anti-tubulin agents and this phosphorylation occurs independent of its own kinase activity. PKR is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) during anti-tubulin treatment and unperturbed mitosis and that PKR regulates mitotic progression in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Furthermore, inactivation of PKR confers resistance to paclitaxel in ovarian and breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. PKR expression levels and activity are decreased in chemotherapeutic recurrent ovarian cancer patients. Mechanistically, our findings suggest that PKR controls paclitaxel chemosensitivity through repressing Bcl2 expression. Pharmacological inhibition of Bcl2 with FDA-approved agent venetoclax overcomes paclitaxel resistance in preclinical animal models of ovarian cancer. Our results suggest that PKR is a critical determinant of paclitaxel cytotoxicity and that PKR-Bcl2 axis as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of recurrent drug-resistant ovarian tumors."
https://openalex.org/W3213003503,"Drug use implies important challenges related to HIV management, particularly due to an increased risk of potential interactions between antiretroviral therapy (ART) and illicit drugs (pDDIs). This study analyses the prevalence and severity of pDDIs among people living with HIV (PLHIV). It also explores their awareness of pDDIs and their beliefs about the toxicity that they may cause, as well as the impact of pDDIs on selected health variables. We conducted an on-line cross-sectional survey across 33 Spanish hospitals and NGOs to collect demographics and clinical data. pDDIs were checked against the Interaction Checker developed by Liverpool University. The sample of the present study was composed of 694 PLHIV who used illicit drugs. They represented 49.5% of the 1,401 PLHIV that participated in the survey. After excluding 38 participants due to lack of information on their ART or illicit drug use, 335 (51.1%) participants consuming drugs presented with some potentially significant pDDIs between their ART and illicit drugs, with a mean of 2.1±1.7 (1-10) pDDIs per patient. The drugs most frequently involved in pDDIs were cocaine, cannabis, MDMA and nitrates (""poppers""). The prevalence of pDDIs across ART regimens was: protease inhibitors (41.7%); integrase inhibitor-boosted regimens (32.1%), and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (26.3%). An awareness of pDDIs and beliefs about their potential toxicity correlated positively with intentional non-adherence (p<0.0001). Participants with pDDIs exhibited a higher prevalence of intentional non-adherence (2.19±1.04 vs. 1.93±0.94; p = 0.001). The presence of pDDIs was not associated with poorer results in the clinical variables analysed. A significant proportion of PLHIV who use drugs experience pDDIs, thereby requiring close monitoring. pDDIs should be considered in the clinical management of HIV patients. Adequate information about pDDIs and indicators about how to manage ART when PLHIV use drugs could improve ART non-adherence."
https://openalex.org/W3211583041,"This study presented a method of quantifying the manoeuvrability of two field-based team sport athletes and investigated its relationship with running velocity during competition. Across a season, 10 Hz Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) devices were worn during matches by 62 athletes (Australian Football League [AFL]; n = 36, 17 matches, National Rugby League [NRL]; n = 26, 21 matches). To quantify manoeuvrability, tortuosity was calculated from the X and Y coordinates from match GNSS files (converted from latitude and longitude). Tortuosity was calculated as 100 x natural logarithm of the chord distance (distance travelled between X and Y coordinates), divided by the straight-line distance. The maximal tortuosity was then quantified for each 0.5 m∙s-1 speed increment, ranging from 0 to the highest value for each game file. A quadratic model was fitted for each match file, controlling for the curvilinear relationship between tortuosity and velocity. A comparison of the quadratic coefficients between sports, and within sport between positions was investigated using linear mixed models. Resulting standard deviations (SDs) and mean differences were then assessed to establish standardized effect sizes (ES) and 90% confidence intervals (CI). A curvilinear relationship exists between maximal tortuosity and running speed, reflecting that as speed increases, athletes' ability to deviate from a linear path is compromised (i.e., run in a more linear path). Compared to AFL, NRL had a greater negative quadratic coefficient (a) (ES = 0.70; 0.47 to 0.93) for the 5 second analysis, meaning that as speed increased, NRL athletes' manoeuvrability reduced at a faster rate than when compared to AFL. There were no positional differences within each sport. GNSS derived information can be used to provide a measure of manoeuvrability tortuosity during NRL and AFL matches. The curvilinear relationship between tortuosity and speed demonstrated that as speed increased, manoeuvrability was compromised."
https://openalex.org/W3212164299,"Extracurricular research programmes (ERPs) may contribute to reducing the current shortage in physician-scientists, but usually select students based on grades only. The question arises if students should be selected based on their motivation, regardless of their previous academic performance. Focusing on grades and lacking to take motivation into account when selecting students for ERPs might exclude an important target group when aiming to cultivate future physician-scientists. Therefore, this study compared ERP students with lower and higher previous academic performance on subsequent academic performance, ERP performance, and motivational factors.Prospective cohort study with undergraduate medical students who filled in a yearly questionnaire on motivational factors. Two student groups participating in an ERP were compared: students with first-year grade point average (GPA) ≥7 versus <7 on a 10-point grading scale. Linear and logistic regressions analyses were used to compare groups on subsequent academic performance (i.e. third-year GPA, in-time bachelor completion), ERP performance (i.e. drop-out, number of credits), and motivational factors (i.e. intrinsic motivation for research, research self-efficacy beliefs, perceptions of research, curiosity), while adjusting for gender and motivational factors at baseline.The <7 group had significantly lower third-year GPA, and significantly higher odds for ERP drop-out than the ≥7 group. However, there was no significant between-group difference on in-time bachelor completion and the <7 group was not inferior to the ≥7 group in terms of intrinsic motivation for research, perceptions of research, and curiosity.Since intrinsic motivation for research, perceptions of research, and curiosity are prerequisites of future research involvement, it seems beneficial to focus on motivation when selecting students for ERPS, allowing students with lower current academic performance to participate in ERPs as well."
https://openalex.org/W3212280928,"In the last decade, active case finding (ACF) strategies for tuberculosis (TB) have been implemented in many diverse settings, with some showing large increases in case detection and reporting at the sub-national level. There have also been several studies which seek to provide evidence for the benefits of ACF to individuals and communities in the broader context. However, there remains no quantification of the impact of ACF with regards to reducing the burden of transmission. We sought to address this knowledge gap and quantify the potential impact of active case finding on reducing transmission of TB at the national scale and further, to determine the intensification of intervention efforts required to bring the reproduction number (R0) below 1 for TB.We adopt a dynamic transmission model that incorporates heterogeneity in risk to TB to assess the impact of an ACF programme (IMPACT TB) on reducing TB incidence in Vietnam and Nepal. We fit the models to country-level incidence data using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. We assess the impact of ACF using a parameter in our model, which we term the treatment success rate. Using programmatic data, we estimate how much this parameter has increased as a result of IMPACT TB in the implementation districts of Vietnam and Nepal and quantify additional efforts needed to eliminate transmission of TB in these countries by 2035.Extending the IMPACT TB programme to national coverage would lead to moderate decreases in TB incidence and would not be enough to interrupt transmission by 2035. Decreasing transmission sufficiently to bring the reproduction number (R0) below 1, would require a further intensification of current efforts, even at the sub-national level.Active case finding programmes are effective in reducing TB in the short term. However, interruption of transmission in high-burden countries, like Vietnam and Nepal, will require comprehensive incremental efforts. Complementary measures to reduce progression from infection to disease, and reactivation of latent infection, are needed to meet the WHO End TB incidence targets."

However, the genetic variations of CYP2R1 (rs10741657) and their association with low serum 25(OH)D level in Bangladeshi adults are yet to be explored.This study was conducted to determine the frequency of variants of rs10741657 of CYP2R1 gene and its association with low serum 25(OH)D level among Bangladeshi adults.This pilot study was conducted among thirty individuals with low serum 25(OH)D level as the study population and ten subjects with sufficient serum 25(OH)D level as controls based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Genetic analysis of rs10741657 of CYP2R1 including primer designing, DNA extraction, PCR of target region with purification and Sanger sequencing of the PCR products were done accordingly. For statistical analysis, One-way ANOVA followed by LSD test, Freeman-Halton extension of Fisher's exact test, Chi-square test (χ2) test and unpaired student t-test were performed.In this study, genetic variants of CYP2R1 (rs10741657) among the study population were genotype GG (63.30%), GA (30%) and AA (6.7%). Minor allele frequency of the study population was 0.217. The association between GG and GA genotypes of CYP2R1 (rs10741657) with low serum 25(OH)D level among the study population was found and it was statistically significant. Statistically significant differences were also observed between the genotypes and alleles of the study population and controls.The presence of 'GG' and 'GA' genotypes of rs1041657 in CYP2R1 gene is associated with low serum 25(OH)D level among Bangladeshi adults in this pilot study."

Based on previous research, there are no international guidelines and standards used by organizations that can contribute to the successful implementation and development of SOC. In this regard, this study focuses on highlighting the significant factors that will impact and contribute to the success of SOC. Simultaneously, it will further design a model for the successful development and implementation of SOC for the organization. The study was conducted quantitatively and involved 63 respondents from 25 ministries and agencies in Malaysia. The results of this study will enable the retrieval of ten success factors for SOC, and it specifically focuses on humans, processes, and technology. The descriptive analysis shows that the top management support factor is the most influential factor in the success of the development and implementation of SOC. The study also contributes to the empirical finding that technology and process factors are more significant in the success of SOCs. Based on the regression test, the technology factor has major impact on determining the success of SOC, followed by the process and human factors.

https://openalex.org/W3214694940,"ARL5B, an ARF-like small GTPase localized to the trans-Golgi, is known for regulating endosome-Golgi trafficking and promoting the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Although a few interacting partners have been identified, the mechanism of the shuttling of ARL5B between the Golgi membrane and the cytosol is still obscure. Here, using GFP-binding protein (GBP) pull-down followed by mass spectrometry, we identified heat shock cognate protein (HSC70) as an additional interacting partner of ARL5B. Our pull-down and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)-based studies suggested that HSC70 binds to ARL5B in an ADP-dependent manner. Additionally, we showed that the N-terminal helix and the nucleotide status of ARL5B contribute to its recognition by HSC70. The confocal microscopy and cell fractionation studies in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells revealed that the depletion of HSC70 reduces the localization of ARL5B to the Golgi. Using in vitro reconstitution approach, we provide evidence that HSC70 fine-tunes the association of ARL5B with Golgi membrane. Finally, we demonstrated that the interaction between ARL5B and HSC70 is important for the localization of cation independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CIMPR) at Golgi. Collectively, we propose a mechanism by which HSC70, a constitutively expressed chaperone, modulates the Golgi association of ARL5B, which in turn has implications for the Golgi-associated functions of this GTPase."

We collected surveillance data among COVID-19 suspected cases tested in mainland Portugal during the first wave of the pandemic, March-April 2020. A multivariable logistic-regression analysis was performed to ascertain the effects of age, sex, prior medical condition and symptoms on the likelihood of testing positive and hospitalisation. Of 25,926 COVID-19 suspected cases included in this study, 5,298 (20%) tested positive. Symptoms were grouped into ten clusters, of which two main ones: one with cough and fever and another with the remainder. There was a higher odds of a positive test with increasing age, myalgia and headache. The odds of being hospitalised increased with age, presence of fever, dyspnoea, or having a prior medical condition although these results varied by region. Presence of cough and other respiratory symptoms did not predict COVID-19 compared to non-COVID respiratory disease patients in any region. Dyspnoea was a strong determinant of hospitalisation, as well as fever and the presence of a prior medical condition, whereas these results varied by region."

The present cross-sectional study measured SARS-CoV-2 antibody in healthcare workers of Kashmir, India. Methods: Serological testing to detect antibodies against nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 was performed in 2003 healthcare workers who voluntarily participated in the study. Results: We report relatively high seropositivity of 26.8% (95% CI 24.8–28.8) for SARS-CoV-2in healthcare workers, nine months after the first case was detected in Kashmir. Most of the healthcare workers (71.7%) attributed infection to the workplace environment. Among healthcare workers who neither reported any prior symptom nor were they ever tested for infection by nasopharyngeal swab test, 25.5% were seropositive.

https://openalex.org/W3213224532,"Bench press is a popular training-exercise in throw related sports such as javelin, baseball and handball. Athletes in these sports often use bouncing (i.e., letting the barbell collide with the chest) to create an increased momentum to accelerate the barbell upwards before completing the movement by throwing the barbell. Importantly, the effects of the bouncing technique in bench press have not been examined. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the effects of bench press throw with (BPT bounce ) or without bounce (BPT) on throwing velocity (penalty and 3-step), 1-repetition maximum (1-RM) and average power output (20-60kg) in bench press among handball players. Sixteen male amateur handball players (7.1±1.9 years of handball experience) were randomly allocated to an eight-week supplementary power training program (2 x week -1 ) with either the BPT or BPT bounce . Except for the bounce technique, the training programs were identical and consisted of 3 sets with 3–5 repetitions at 40–60% of 1-RM with maximal effort in free-weight barbell bench press throw. The results revealed no significant differences between the groups in any of the tests (p = 0.109–0.957). However, both groups improved penalty throw (BPT; 4.6%, p&lt;0.001, ES = 0.57; BPT bounce ; 5.1%, p = 0.008, ES = 0.91) and 1-RM (BPT; 9.7%, p&lt;0.001, ES = 0.49; BPT bounce ; 8.7%, p = 0.018, ES = 0.60), but only the BPT improved the 3-step throw (BPT; 2.9%, p = 0.060, ES = 0.38; BPT bounce ; 2.3%, p = 0.216, ES = 0.40). The BPT improved power output only at 20kg and 30kg loads (9.1% and 12.7%; p = 0.018–0.048, ES = 0.43–0.51) whereas BPT bounce demonstrated no significant differences across the loads (p = 0.252–0.806). In conclusion, the bounce technique demonstrated similar effects on throwing velocity, muscle strength and muscle power output as conventional bench press throw without the bounce technique."
https://openalex.org/W3213786136,"High throughput sequencing has previously identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched signalling networks in human myometrium for term (≥37 weeks) gestation labour, when defined as a singular state of activity at comparison to the non-labouring state. However, transcriptome changes that occur during transition from early to established labour (defined as ≤3 and >3 cm cervical dilatation, respectively) and potentially altered by fetal membrane rupture (ROM), when adapting from onset to completion of childbirth, remained to be defined. In the present study, we assessed whether differences for these two clinically observable factors of labour are associated with different myometrial transcriptome profiles. Analysis of our tissue ('bulk') RNA-seq data (NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus: GSE80172) with classification of labour into four groups, each compared to the same non-labour group, identified more DEGs for early than established labour; ROM was the strongest up-regulator of DEGs. We propose that lower DEGs frequency for early labour and/or ROM negative myometrium was attributed to bulk RNA-seq limitations associated with tissue heterogeneity, as well as the possibility that processes other than gene transcription are of more importance at labour onset. Integrative analysis with future data from additional samples, which have at least equivalent refined clinical classification for labour status, and alternative omics approaches will help to explain what truly contributes to transcriptomic changes that are critical for labour onset. Lastly, we identified five DEGs common to all labour groupings; two of which (AREG and PER3) were validated by qPCR and not differentially expressed in placenta and choriodecidua."

This mixed-methods study aimed to explore the perceptions and attitudes toward antibiotics among patients, prescribers, and pharmacists in the ASB District hospital outpatient department.Knowledge of antibiotics including their purpose and function, how and why they are used, and drivers for choice of antibiotic was examined at patient, prescriber, and provider-level. The first phase of the study, an exploratory qualitative component using an interpretative approach, was used to inform the second phase, a structured survey. Thirty-six interviews were conducted with 39 participants (21 patients or caretakers and 18 hospital health workers). Three hundred and fifty-one (351) patients and caretakers completed the second phase, the structured survey. This study found that poor knowledge of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance is a driving factor for inappropriate use of antibiotics. Participant perceptions of living in a polluted environment drove the high demand and perceived 'need' for antibiotics: patients, doctors and pharmacists alike consider dirty and dusty living conditions as causes of 'disease' in the body, requiring antibiotics to 'clean' and 'strengthen' it.Findings highlight the need for strategies to improve awareness and knowledge of the general public, improve practice of doctors and pharmacists, regulate antibiotic dispensing in private pharmacies, and implement antibiotic stewardship in hospitals."

However, the exact impact of a slight delay in TPE initiation on the subsequent patients' outcome is still controversial.We aimed to study the frequency, short-term neurological consequences, and determinants of diagnostic delay in iTTP.We conducted a retrospective monocentric study including patients with a first acute episode of iTTP (2005-2020) classified into 2 groups: delayed (>24h from first hospital visit, group 1) and immediate diagnosis (≤24h, group 2).Among 42 evaluated patients, 38 were included. Eighteen cases (47%) had a delayed diagnosis (median: 5 days). The main misdiagnosis was immune thrombocytopenia (67%). The mortality rate was 5% (1 death in each group). Neurological events (stroke/TIA, seizure, altered mental status) occurred in 67% vs 30% patients in group 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.04). Two patients in group 1 exhibited neurological sequelae. The hospital length of stay was longer in group 1 (p = 0.02). At the first hospital evaluation, potential alternative causes of thrombocytopenia were more prevalent in group 1 (33% vs 5%, p = 0.04). Anemia was less frequent in group 1 (67% vs 95%, p = 0.04). All patients had undetectable haptoglobin levels. By contrast, 26% of schistocytes counts were <1%, mostly in group 1 (62% vs 11%, p = 0.01).Diagnostic delay is highly prevalent in iTTP, with a significant impact on short-term neurological outcome. In patients with profound thrombocytopenia, the thorough search for signs of incipient organ dysfunction, systematic hemolysis workup, and proper interpretation of schistocytes count are the key elements of early diagnosis of TTP."
https://openalex.org/W3212505083,"Although attentional bias modification has been shown effective in several appetitive domains, results have been mixed. A major contributor seems to be the choice of control condition. The aim of the present study was to compare attentional bias modification for chocolate against a new control condition, sham-n (neutral or no-contingency) training. Using a modified dot probe protocol, participants (N = 192; 17-30 years) were randomly trained to attend to chocolate pictures, avoid chocolate pictures, or received sham-n training. In the attend and avoid conditions, stimulus pairs consisted of one chocolate and one non-chocolate picture, and probes replaced most often (90/10) chocolate or non-chocolate pictures, respectively. In the sham-n training condition, stimulus pairs consisted of two chocolate or two non-chocolate pictures, and probes replaced pictures within pairs with equal frequency (50/50). Attentional bias for chocolate increased following attend training, decreased following avoidance training, and did not change following sham-n training. The findings clearly demonstrate that both attend and avoidance training alter (in opposite direction) attentional bias for chocolate, whereas sham-n training is inert. This makes sham-n training particularly promising for use in clinical samples who tend to show strong initial biases."

https://openalex.org/W3213766960,"The objective of this study was to investigate the impacts of dietary crude protein (CP), fishmeal and sorghum on nutrient utilisation, digestibility coefficients and disappearance rates of starch and protein, amino acid concentrations in systemic plasma and their relevance to growth performance of broiler chickens using the Box-Behnken response surface design. The design consisted of three factors at three levels including dietary CP (190, 210, 230 g/kg), fishmeal (0, 50, 100 g/kg), and sorghum (0, 150, 300 g/kg). A total of 390 male, off-sex Ross 308 chicks were offered experimental diets from 14 to 35 days post-hatch. Growth performance, nutrient utilisation, starch and protein digestibilities and plasma free amino acids were determined. Dietary CP had a negative linear impact on weight gain where the transition from 230 to 190 g/kg CP increased weight gain by 9.43% (1835 versus 2008 g/bird, P = 0.006). Moreover, dietary CP linearly depressed feed intake (r = -0.486. P < 0.001). Fishmeal inclusions had negative linear impacts on weight gain (r = -0.751, P < 0.001) and feed intake (r = -0.495, P < 0.001). There was an interaction between dietary CP and fishmeal for FCR. However, growth performance was not influenced by dietary inclusions of sorghum. Total plasma amino acid concentrations were negatively related to weight gain (r = -0.519, P < 0.0001). The dietary transition from 0 to 100 g/kg fishmeal increased total amino acid concentrations in systemic plasma by 35% (771 versus 1037 μg/mL, P < 0.001). It may be deduced that optimal weight gain (2157 g/bird), optimal feed intake (3330 g/bird) and minimal FCR (1.544) were found in birds offered 190 g/kg CP diets without fishmeal inclusion, irrespective of sorghum inclusions. Both fishmeal and sorghum inclusions did not alter protein and starch digestion rate in broiler chickens; however, moderate reductions in dietary CP could advantage broiler growth performance."

https://openalex.org/W3214524785,"As whole-genome sequencing for pathogen genomes becomes increasingly popular, the typing methods of gene-by-gene comparison, such as core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) and whole-genome multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST), are being routinely implemented in molecular epidemiology. However, some intrinsic problems remain. For example, genomic sequences with varying read depths, read lengths, and assemblers influence the genome assemblies, introducing error or missing alleles into the generated allelic profiles. These errors and missing alleles might create ""specious discrepancy"" among closely related isolates, thus making accurate epidemiological interpretation challenging. In addition, the rapid growth of the cgMLST allelic profile database can cause problems related to storage and maintenance as well as long query search times.We attempted to resolve these issues by decreasing the scheme size to reduce the occurrence of error and missing alleles, alleviate the storage burden, and improve the query search time. The challenge in this approach is maintaining the typing resolution when using fewer loci. We achieved this by using a popular artificial intelligence technique, XGBoost, coupled with Shapley additive explanations for feature selection. Finally, 370 loci from the original 1701 cgMLST loci of Listeria monocytogenes were selected.Although the size of the final scheme (LmScheme_370) was approximately 80% lower than that of the original cgMLST scheme, its discriminatory power, tested for 35 outbreaks, was concordant with that of the original cgMLST scheme. Although we used L. monocytogenes as a demonstration in this study, the approach can be applied to other schemes and pathogens. Our findings might help elucidate gene-by-gene-based epidemiology."
