https://openalex.org/W1927894522,"myo-Inositol-1-phosphatase has been partially purified from bovine brain. The enzyme has a molecular weight of about 58,000. Both L-myo-inositol 1-phosphate and D-myo-inositol 1-phosphate are hydrolyzed by the enzyme as well as (-)-chiro-inositol 3-phosphate and 2'-AMP. Triphosphoinositide is not a substrate. The phosphatase is completely dependent on Mg2+, which has a Km of 1 mM. Calcium and manganese ions are competitive inhibitors of Mg2+ binding with Ki values of 18 microM and 2 microM, respectively. Lithium chloride inhibits the hydrolysis of both L- and D-myo-inositol 1-phosphate to the extent of 50% at a concentration of 0.8 mM. The phosphatase from testis is similarly inhibited by lithium. Lithium ion is a noncompetitive inhibitor of Mg2+ binding and an uncompetitive inhibitor of myo-inositol 1-phosphate binding. Because lithium chloride administration elicits both an increase in the levels of myo-inositol 1-phosphate and a decrease in the levels of myo-inositol in rat brain (Allison, 1978), and because these actions are blocked by anticholinergic agents, we examined the effects of cholinergic agonists and antagonists on the enzyme and found none. The possibility that the inhibition of this enzyme by lithium ion is related to the pharmacological actions of lithium is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1498308778,"The ability of DNA is support poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis is completely dependent upon the number and type of strand breaks it contains and is independent of the sequence. Single-stranded DNA is ineffective. Covalently closed circular plasmid DNA is ineffective, but when it is enzymatically digested it activates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in proportion to the number of strand breaks, suggesting that the polymerase recognizes DNA ends. Double-stranded restriction fragments with flush ends are approximately 3 times more effective than are fragments with unpaired nucleotides extending from the 3' termini and about 10 times more effective than are either fragments with unpaired nucleotides extending from the 5' termini or plasmids with single-strand breaks. All types of restriction fragments become more effective upon removal of terminal 5'-phosphate groups. This specificity profile may relate to the proposed role of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis in the repair of DNA strand breaks, for those which are assumed to be more difficult to repair in vivo are the more effective stimulators. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase has no divalent cation requirement when supplied with flush-ended DNA fragments, but magnesium may enhance the effective of other types of DNA by activating magnesium-dependent nucleases. Ineffective DNAs, such as covalently closed plasmids or synthetic homopolymers that are unable to form Watson-Crick duplexes, apparently compete with effective DNA and weakly inhibit poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1582396128,"Hepatic catabolism of lipoproteins containing apolipoproteins B or E is enhanced in rats treated with pharmacologic doses of 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol. Liver membranes prepared from these rats exhibit an increased number of receptor sites that bind 125I-labeled human low density lipoproteins (LDL) in vitro. In the present studies, this estradiol-stimulated hepatic receptor was shown to recognize the following rat lipoproteins: LDL, very low density lipoproteins obtained from liver perfusates (hepatic VLDL), and VLDL-remnants prepared by intravenous injection of hepatic VLDL into functionally eviscerated rats. The receptor also recognized synthetic lamellar complexes of lecithin and rat apoprotein E as well as canine high density lipoproteins containing apoprotein E (apo E-HDLc). It did not recognize human HDL or rat HDL deficient in apoprotein E. Much smaller amounts of this high affinity binding site were also found on liver membranes from untreated rats, the number of such sites increasing more than 10-fold after the animals were treated with estradiol. Each of the rat lipoproteins recognized by this receptor was taken up more rapidly by perfused livers from estrogen-treated rats. In addition, enrichment of hepatic VLDL with C-apoproteins lowered the ability of these lipoproteins to bind to the estradiol-stimulated receptor and diminished their rate of uptake by the perfused liver of estrogen-treated rats, just as it did in normal rats. The current data indicate that under the influence of pharmacologic doses of estradiol the liver of the rat contains increased amounts of a functional lipoprotein receptor that binds lipoproteins containing apoproteins B and E. This hepatic lipoprotein receptor appears to mediate the uptake and degradation of lipoproteins by the normal liver as well as the liver of estradiol-treated rats. The hepatic receptor bears a close functional resemblance to the LDL receptor previously characterized on extrahepatic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1568769949,"DNA, isolated from Simian virus 40 (SV40), has been encapsulated in large (0.4-micrometer diameter) unilamellar phospholipid vesicles. The procedure used for liposome preparation encapsulated the SV40 DNA at high efficiency (30 to 50% entrapment) and did not alter the physical or biological properties of the DNA molecules. The biological activity of the liposome-entrapped viral DNA was determined by plaque assays on a permissive monkey cell line. The infectivity of liposome-entrapped SV40 DNA was enhanced at least 100-fold over that of free naked DNA. Importantly, the infectivity of vesicle-entrapped DNA was resistant to DNase digestion, dependent on the amount of DNA encapsulated per vesicle and on the vesicle lipid composition. Liposomes composed of phosphatidylserine were the most efficient for delivery of DNA to cells (1.8 x 10(3) plaque-forming units/micrograms of DNA). Following the incubation of DNA-containing liposomes with cells, their infectivity could be enhanced an additional 10- to 200-fold by exposing the cells to high concentrations of polyethylene glycol or glycerol. Under these conditions the infectivity of liposome-encapsulated SV40 DNA (3 x 10(5) plaque-forming units/microgram) was comparable with values reported using the calcium phosphate method. In addition to providing a sensitive assay for monitoring and optimizing the delivery of vesicle contents to cells, the liposome-mediated delivery of nucleic acids may have potential for increasing the efficiency of DNA delivery to cells and for extending the number of cell types which can be transformed or transfected."
https://openalex.org/W1487187329,"A hypothetical three-dimensional model of the cytochrome c peroxidase . tuna cytochrome c complex is presented. The model is based on known x-ray structures and supported by chemical modification and kinetic data. Cytochrome c peroxidase contains a ring of aspartate residues with a spatial distribution on the molecular surface that is complementary to the distribution of highly conserved lysines surrounding the exposed edge of the cytochrome c heme crevice, namely lysines 13, 27, 72, 86, and 87. These lysines are known to play a functional role in the reaction with cytochrome c peroxidase, cytochrome oxidase, cytochrome c1, and cytochrome b5. A hypothetical model of the complex was constructed with the aid of a computer-graphics display system by visually optimizing hydrogen bonding interactions between complementary charged groups. The two hemes in the resulting model are parallel with an edge separation of 16.5 A. In addition, a system of inter- and intramolecular pi-pi and hydrogen bonding interactions forms a bridge between the hemes and suggests a mechanism of electron transfer."

https://openalex.org/W1517088677,"Rabbit peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes, elicited with glycogen, metabolized added [1-14C]arachidonic acid to the 5-lipoxygenase products 5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid and 5,12-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (leukotriene B) and the 15-lipoxygenase product 15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid. These metabolites were isolated by high pressure liquid chromatography and converted to the trimethylsilyl-ether methyl ester derivatives, and the structures were confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. When polymorphonuclear leukocytes were preincubated with 15-HETE (16 microM), the formation of 5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid and 5,12-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-eicostatetraenoic acid from [1-14C]arachidonic acid was strongly suppressed. The concentration required for 50% inhibition of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway in these cells was approximately 6 microM, which is comparable to the concentrations (0.20 to 1.8 microM) of 15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid produced in incubations of polymorphonuclear leukocytes with arachidonic acid alone. Recent reports indicate that slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (leukotriene C/D) and chemotactic substance leukotriene B are arachidonic acid metabolites formed via the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. Our observations thus suggest that 15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid can regulate the formation of these vasoactive and inflammatory mediators intracellularly."
https://openalex.org/W1526998224,"Abstract The interactions of Pi, PPi, and carbamyl-P with the hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase system were studied in intact and detergent-disrupted microsomes. Penetration of PPi and carbamyl-P into intact microsomes was evidenced by their reactions with the enzyme located exclusively on the luminal surface. Lack of effects of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and valinomycin + KCl indicated that pH gradients and/or membrane potentials that could influence the kinetics of the system are not generated during metabolism of PPi and glucose-6-P by intact microsomes. With disrupted microsomes, only competitive interactions were seen among glucose-6-P, Pi, PPi, and carbamyl-P. With intact microsomes, Pi, PPi, and carbamyl-P were relatively weak, inhibitors of glucose-6-phosphatase, and PPi hydrolysis was inhibited competitively by Pi and carbamyl-P but noncompetitively by glucose-6-P. Analysis of the kinetic data in combination with findings from other studies that a variety of inhibitors of the glucose-6-P translocase (T1) does not affect PPi hydrolysis provide compelling evidence that permeability of microsomes to Pi, PPi, and carbamyl-P is mediated by a second translocase (T2). Some properties of the microsomal anion transporters are described. If the characteristics of the glucose-6-phosphatase system as presently defined in intact microsomes apply in vivo, glucose-6-P hydrolysis appears to be the predominant, if not the exclusive, physiologic function of the system. Both the noncompetitive character and the relative ineffectiveness of Pi as an inhibitor of glucose-6-phosphatase of intact microsomes result from the rate limitation imposed by T1 that prevents equilibration of glucose-6-P across the membrane. In microsomes from fed rats, where T1 is less rate restricting, about one-half as much Pi was required to give 50% inhibition compared with microsomes from fasted or diabetic rats. Thus, any treatment or agent that alters the kinetic relationship between transport and hydrolysis of glucose-6-P (e.g. endocrine or nutritional status) is an essential consideration in analyses of kinetic data for the glucose-6-phosphatase system."
https://openalex.org/W1500512772,"Abstract A mechanism for the activating effect of alamethicin on membrane enzymes was investigated, using a purified preparation of cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles. (Na+,K+)-ATPase, beta-adrenergic receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activities were measured. alamethicin increased ouabain-sensitive (Na+,K+)-ATPase activity of sarcolemmal vesicles 5- to 7-fold and adenylate cyclase activity 2.5- to 4-fold. Adenylate cyclase retained its sensitivity to the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol after membranes were treated with alamethicin. Alamethicin caused a 4- to 6-fold increase in the number of detectable (Na+,K+)-ATPase enzymic sites, but no increase ws noted for the number of muscarinic-cholinergic receptor-binding sites. Phosphorylation of endogenous proteins of sarcolemmal vesicles by an intrinsic cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity was stimulated 5- to 7-fold by alamethicin. The regulatory subunit of the membrane-bound cAMP-dependent protein kinase was labeled with the photoaffinity probe 8-azido-adenosine 3':5'[32P]monophosphate (8-N3-[32P]cAMP), and it migrated with an apparent molecular weight of 55,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels. Alamethicin stimulated autophosphorylation of the regulatory subunit by [gamma-32P]ATP 6-fold and incorporation of of 8-N3-[32P]cAMP into the subunit 2.6-fold. The results suggest that alamethicin disrupts membrane barriers of sarcolemmal vesicles, which are mostly right side out, giving substrates and activators access to enzymic sites in the interior of the vesicles, while preserving functional coupling of enzymes to their effectors."
https://openalex.org/W1567994665,"Addition of rat or human high density lipoproteins (HDL) or human low density lipoproteins (LDL) to rat adrenocortical cells in vitro was found to enhance steroid production and increase cell cholesterol content. These effects of HDL were not observed in cultured mouse Y-1 adrenal cells, suggesting that rat adrenal cells possess a specific mechanism for uptake of HDL cholesterol not found in Y-1 cells. The effects of HDL were most marked on cells previously stimulated with adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and depleted of their endogenous cholesterol stores. Such cells were prepared either by treatment in vivo with 4-aminopyrazolopyrimidine or in vitro with ACTH (10(-7) M) in lipoprotein-poor media. Steroid production by treated cells exhibited a saturable dependence on media HDL concentration. In addition to enhancing ACTH stimulated steroid production, addition of HDL also resulted in a saturable concentration-dependent increase in cell cholesterol content. Both aminoglutethimide and cycloheximide were found to inhibit HDL-enhanced steroid production. Finally, addition of HDL to short term incubations (5 1/2 h) of ACTH-treated cells caused no change in the rate of incorporation of 14C-acetate into cholesterol or corticosterone. These results indicate that rat adrenocortical cells possess a specific, saturable, ACTH-dependent mechanism for uptake of HDL cholesterol. Moreover, cellular uptake of HDL cholesterol exceeded by at least 4-fold the amount of cholesterol associated with HDL apoprotein degraded by the cells, suggesting that utilization of HDL cholesterol does not require endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of the entire HDL particle."

https://openalex.org/W1581680249,"Cultures of embryonic chick muscle cells grown in medium containing phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens incorporated [3H]choline into lipid at a rate 3- to 5-fold higher than control cultures. To determine the mechanism by which stimulation of phosphatidylcholine synthesis occurred in phospholipase C-treated cells, activities of enzymes and levels of intermediates in the biosynthetic pathway for phosphatidylcholine were examined. Activities of choline kinase, choline phosphotransferase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, and phosphatidic acid phosphatase in phospholipase C-treated cells were the same or only slightly higher than in control cells. CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, on the other hand, was 3 times as active in homogenates from phospholipase C-treated cells. Levels of phosphocholine decreased and levels of CDP-choline increased in phospholipase C-treated cells, and a calculation of the disequilibrium ratio indicated that the cytidylyltransferase reaction was not at equilibrium. The cytidylyltransferase was, thus, identified as the regulatory enzyme for choline flux in these cells. The cytidylyltransferase was located in both the cytosolic and particulate fractions from cultured muscle cells and a much larger portion of enzyme activity was associated with the particulate fraction in cells treated with phospholipase C. Sonicated preparations of total chick lipids, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine greatly stimulated the cytosolic cytidylyltransferase activity but had no effect on the particulate enzyme. Neither stimulation of incorporation of [3H]choline into lipid nor activation of the cytidylyltransferase was dependent on protein synthesis. A model for the mechanism of regulation of phosphatidylcholine synthesis in embryonic chick muscle is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1513210255,"Insulin stimulated the uptake of 86Rb+ (a K+ analog) in rat adipocytes and increased the steady state concentration of intracellular potassium. Half-maximal stimulation occurred at an insulin concentration of 200 pM. Both basal- and insulin-stimulated 86Rb+ transport rates depended on the concentration of external K+, external Na+, and were 90% inhibited by 10(-3) M ouabain and 10(-3) M KCN, indicating that the hormone was activating the (Na+,K+)-ATPase. Insulin had no effect on the entry of 22Na+ or exit of 86Rb+. Kinetic analysis demonstrated that insulin acted by increasing the maximum velocity, Vmax, of 86Rb+ entry. Inhibition of the rate of Rb+ uptake by ouabain was best described by a biphasic inhibition curve. Scatchard analysis of ouabain binding to intact cells indicated binding sites with multiple affinities. Only the rubidium transport sites which exhibited a high affinity for ouabain were stimulated by insulin. Stimulation required insulin binding to an intact cell surface receptor, as it was reversible by trypsinization. We conclude that the uptake of 86Rb+ by the (Na+,K+)-ATPase is an insulin-sensitive membrane transport process in the fat cell."
https://openalex.org/W1597576404,"This study examines the effects of cholestyramine (2 g/day) on the plasma clearance and tissue uptake of human low density lipoprotein (LDL) in rabbits. 1,2-Cyclohexanedione modification of human LDL abolishes its recognition by high affinity cell membrane receptors in vitro and delays its plasma clearance in comparison to native LDL. Consequently, the difference between the fractional rates of catabolism of simultaneously injected native and cyclohexanedione-treated LDL is an index of in vivo receptor-mediated clearance of the lipoprotein. When human 125I-LDL and 131I-cyclohexanedione-treated LDL were injected into rabbits, 44% of the lipoprotein was cleared from the plasma by the receptor mechanism. Various tissues were removed from the animals at the end of the turnover study and their relative uptakes of 125I native and 131I-cyclohexanedione-treated LDL were measured. All exhibited receptor activity to some extent, incorporating more native than cyclohexanedione-modified LDL. The greatest receptor activity per g of tissue was found in lymph nodes, spleen, and liver and, in terms of whole organ uptake, the liver played a major role in LDL catabolism. Treatment of the rabbits with cholestyramine lowered the circulating LDL cholesterol level by promoting its clearance (120%, p < 0.001) via the receptor pathway. This was associated with a virtual doubling of receptor-mediated incorporation of the lipoprotein into the liver. These results suggest that the drain which cholestyramine induces in the hepatic cholesterol pool promotes LDL receptor activity in this organ and thereby lowers the level of circulating LDL."
https://openalex.org/W1600133329,"Abstract The binding of mouse epidermal growth factor-urogastrone (EGF-URO) to membranes from term human placenta is peptide-specific, saturable (about 20 pmol of EGF-URO bound maximally/mg of protein), reversible, and of high affinity (KD about 400 pM). Optimal binding is observed at pH 7.6. At low pH (3.5 to 5.0). EGF-URO can be reversibly dissociated from the receptor; however, exposure to pH < 3 irreversibly inactivates the receptor. The binding, which does not exhibit ligand cooperativity, exhibits an association rate constant of 6.1 x 10(-4) s-1 and a dissociation rate constant of 6.1 x 10(-4) s-1. The dissociation constant determined from the rate constants, 240 pM, is in reasonable agreement with the constant estimated by equilibrium methods. Both monovalent and divalent cations augment EGF-URO binding 2- to 3-fold. Although in general, divalent cations enhance binding at lower concentrations (optimum, 5 mM) than do monovalent cations (optimum, approximately 80 mM), there is no cation-specific effect. Neither guanine nor adenine nucleotides affect EGF-URO binding. Whereas the proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, chymotrypsin, papain, and pepsin) inactivate the receptor, neuraminidase and phospholipases A2, C, and D augment EGF-URO binding. Neuraminidase increases the number of available sites without affecting ligand affinity. Wheat germ agglutinin, concanavalin A, and phytohemagglutinin all compete for the binding of EGF-URO. The data complement previous observations of EGF-URO binding obtained in intact cells and provide a basis for the solubilization, characterization, and isolation of this receptor from a rich tissue source."

https://openalex.org/W1519152316,"The capacity of epinephrine alone and the combination of low dose epinephrine and ADP to support the binding of fibrinogen to washed human platelets has been examined, 125I-Fibrinogen was bound to epinephrine-stimulated platelets, but 90 min were required to achieve maximal binding at 22 degrees C in contrast to 20 to 30 min with ADP. The overall rate of interaction appeared to reflect the slow binding of fibrinogen to epinephrine-stimulated platelets as opposed to the rate of stimulation of the cell. Divalent ions were required for binding of fibrinogen to epinephrine-stimulated platelets, and both calcium and magnesium supported binding with a prolonged time course. Fibrinogen binding was maximally supported by 20 to 30 microM epinephrine. The combination of low dose epinephrine (5 microM) and low dose ADP (0.5 microM), which acted synergistically to induce platelet aggregation, supported the rapid (10 min) binding of fibrinogen to platelets. With 4 microM epinephrine, more fibrinogen bound per platelet at all ADP doses than with ADP alone. With all the stimuli, saturable binding of fibrinogen to the platelet was observed, and Scatchard plots were linear, yielding very similar apparent association constants. The number of molecules bound per cell was stimulus-dependent, with 30 microM epinephrine inducing the binding of fewer fibrinogen molecules per cell (mean = 20,400) than 10 microM ADP (mean = 35,900) or the combination of 5 microM epinephrine + 0.5 microM ADP (mean = 43,600). The participation of endogenous ADP in fibrinogen binding to epinephrine-stimulated platelets was suggested since enzymes which remove ADP, apyrase, and creatine phosphate/creatine phosphokinase, and the ADP analogue, 2-chloroadenosine, completely inhibited the binding of fibrinogen to the platelet."

https://openalex.org/W1549018282,"Abstract The DNA sequences of two segments of the ribosomal RNA transcription units of Euglena gracilis Pringsheim strain Z chloroplast DNA have been determined. The first is from the 16 S to 23 S rRNA spacer region. The nucleotide sequence determined includes 64 bp from the 3'-end of the 16 S rRNA gene, the adjacent 87-bp spacer containing 68A-T base pairs, a tRNAIle gene, a 9-bp spacer, a tRNAAla gene, a spacer of approximately 15 bp, and the first 120 bp from the 5'-end of the 23 S rRNA gene. The gene organization of the 16 S to 23 S rRNA spacer, the identity of the tRNA genes, and the tRNA anticodons for the E. gracilis rRNA transcription units are identical with that of the rrnA, D, and X operons of Escherichia coli. The second DNA segment which was sequenced is from a region preceding the 5'-end of the 16 S rRNA gene. Within a continuous region of 189 bp in this 16 S rRNA leader sequence, 68% of the bases are homologous to the 16 S rRNA to 23 S rRNA spacer region. This homology includes the 3'-end of the 16 S rRNA gene, the adjacent spacer, and a complete pseudo tRNAIle gene. This leader sequence which has the same polarity as the rRNA transcripts, is flanked by nucleotide sequences resembling partial tRNA genes."
https://openalex.org/W2017455785,"Serological and molecular biological studies1–3 have shown an association between Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and naso-pharyngeal carcinoma. Although it has been shown that the epithelioid tumour cells carry EBV genomes4, they are apparently devoid of receptors for EBV (H.W., unpublished observations). Others have suggested that fusion of EBV carrying cells with epithelial cells may be the mode of entry of the virus into cells unable to absorb the virus and that this may be mediated by one of the known syncytium-forming viruses which inhabit the respiratory tract (for example, members of the paramyxovirus group), de Thé and colleagues suggested that intercellular bridges could be seen in NPC tumour material5. We have developed a technique which permits the preparation of stable monolayers of viable human lymphoblastoid cell lines6. Using this technique we have now demonstrated that EBV can induce fusion between EBV-superinfected lymphoblastoid cells and cells devoid of EBV receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1565793031,"Abstract GDP and GTP regulation of receptor-mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclases in membranes of S49 murine lymphoma cells (S49), NS-20 murine neuroblastoma cells (NS-20), rabbit corpora lutea (CL), and turkey erythrocytes were studied under assay conditions which minimized conversion of added GTP to GDP and of added GDP to GTP. Hormonal stimulation in all systems required guanine nucleotide addition. In the presence of GTP, adenylyl cyclase activity in S49, NS-20, and CL was stimulated respectively by isoproterenol and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), by PGE1 and the adenosine analog, phenylisopropyladenosine, and by PGE1 and isoproterenol, with the first of the listed stimulants eliciting higher activities than the second. Activity in turkey erythrocyte membranes was stimulated by isoproterenol. GDP was partially effective in promoting hormonal stimulation, being able to sustain stimulation by isoproterenol and PGE1 in S49 cell membranes and by PGE1 in CL membranes. In NS-20 membranes, both GDP and guanosine-5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S) were inhibitory on basal activity, yet promoted limited but significant stimulation by PGE1. In turkey erythrocytes, stimulation by isoproterenol could not be elicited with GDP or GDP beta S. Thus, although less effective than GTP in promoting hormonal stimulation of several adenylyl cyclase systems, GDP was clearly not inactive. Concentration effect curves for active hormone in the presence of GDP had higher apparent Ka values than in the presence of GTP. In spite of differences between the effects of GTP and GDP on hormonal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activities, GTP and GDP affected equally well isoproterenol binding, regardless of whether or not its receptor could be shown to stimulate adenylyl cyclase in the presence of GDP. Determination of transphosphorylation of GDP to GTP showed that at saturating concentrations, the proportion of GDP converted to GTP is negligible and unaffected by hormonal stimulation. Concentrations giving 50% inhibition were determined for GTP- and GDP-mediated inhibition of guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate stimulation in the absence and presence of stimulatory hormones. In all four systems studied, GTP and GDP interacted with about equal potency and hormonal stimulation was not accompanied by a selective decrease in affinity for GDP. One way to explain all of the results obtained is to view hormonally sensitive adenylyl cyclase systems as two-state enzymes whose activities are regulated by GTP and GDP through an allosteric site related to the catalytic moiety, and receptors as entities that are inactive and hence unable to couple unless occupied by hormones and activated by any guanine nucleotide through a distinct receptor-related process."
https://openalex.org/W1536297646,"In previous studies, a correlation was observed between isoproterenol-responsive Na+-K+ co-transport in turkey erythrocytes and increased phosphorylation of goblin, an Mr = 230,000 protein of the turkey erythrocyte plasma membrane. The phosphorylation of specific sites in goblin has now been analyzed by tryptic fingerprinting. Three major phosphopeptides were detected in goblin prepared from intact, 32P-labeled erythrocytes. One of the peptides 1, was maximally phosphorylated in the absence of hormonal agents. Two additional peptides, 2 and 3, were phosphorylated only following exposure of cells to the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, to cAMP plus isobutylmethylxanthine, or to cholera toxin. In cells stimulated by isoproterenol, phosphorylation of goblin peptides 2 and 3 could be selectively and completely reversed by subsequent addition of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Addition of either cAMP or of Ca2+ plus calmodulin to purified turkey erythrocyte plasma membranes increased incorporation of 32P into goblin. Peptides 2 and 3 of goblin were phosphorylated by addition to the membranes of cAMP or of purified cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Two additional goblin peptides, 4 and 5, were phosphorylated in the plasma membrane preparation by addition of purified calmodulin plus Ca2+, whereas peptides 2 and 3 of goblin were not phosphorylated under these conditions. Peptide 1 did not incorporate 32P in the plasma membranes under any condition tested. Both calmodulin and cAMP-dependent protein kinase were identified directly in turkey erythrocytes. The three major phosphopeptides of goblin phosphorylated in intact cells (peptides 1, 2, and 3) contained phosphothreonine and represented distinct phosphorylation sites. In contrast, the two phosphopeptides of goblin phosphorylated in plasma membranes by addition of Ca+/calmodulin (peptides 4 and 5) contained phosphoserine. It is concluded that goblin, a plasma membrane protein possibly involved in the hormonal regulation of Na+-K+ co-transport, contains at least 3 distinct threonine residues and 1 or more serine residues which serve as specific substrates for three or more distinct protein kinases of the turkey erythrocyte, namely a cAMP-dependent enzyme, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzyme, and a third enzyme with undetermined regulatory control."
https://openalex.org/W1552840552,"Novikoff hepatoma stimulatory factor IV has been resolved from the DNA polymerase-beta on a single-stranded DNA-cellulose column and then purified to > 95% homogeneity on hydroxylapatite. A single band of Mr = 12,000 is found on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Addition of factor IV to a DNA synthesis reaction causes (i) an increase in initial velocity, (ii) a prolongation of linear synthesis, and (iii) an increase in extent of incorporation. In the absence of factor IV, the reaction reaches a plateau in approximately 1 h. Factor IV, added at this point, causes resumption of synthesis with kinetics similar to when factor IV was present from the start. When factor IV is present, synthesis is followed by DNA degradation, indicating nuclease activity. Factor IV is shown to be an exonuclease which hydrolyzes double-stranded substrates in both the 3' to 5' and 5' to 3' directions at similar rates. Factor IV interacts with the 3.3 S beta-polymerase forming an aggregate sedimenting at 4.1 S and containing both polymerase and exonuclease activities. Analysis of fractions containing a beta-polymerase . exonuclease complex on polyacrylamide gels suggests a stoichiometry of 1:1. The exonuclease shows a strong preference for double-stranded substrates and is most active on poly(dA-dT). It can hydrolyze chains containing either a 3'- or 5'-phosphoryl or a 5'- or 3'-hydroxyl terminus. The product of digestion is predominantly 5'-nucleoside monophosphates. The enzyme cannot hydrolyze di- or trinucleotides, lacks RNase-H activity, and will not liberate thymine dimers from UV-irradiated DNA. The exonuclease has an alkaline pH optimum and requires a divalent cation. Since the properties of this exonuclease are unlike those of previously described mammalian DNases, we have named this enzyme mammalian DNase V."
https://openalex.org/W22154000,"The content of protein A24, an adduct of histone 2A and ubiquitin, was studied during chicken erythropoiesis. The amount of protein A24 was negligible in transcriptionally inactive mature chicken erythrocyte nuclei and 6-fold higher in the transcriptionally active nuclei of erythroid cells from phenylhydrazine-treated chickens. The decreased amount of protein A24 in the mature cells was offset by the relatively increased amount of histone 2A. A loss of free ubiquitin was also noted. In contrast, the amounts of high mobility group proteins 1,2, and E were essentially constant. Inasmuch as cleavage of the ubiquitin---histone 2A bond of protein A24 and loss of ubiquitin accompanied transcriptional shutdown during erythropoiesis, the presence of protein A24 and ubiquitin in premature polychromatic erythrocytes may reflect the presence of potentially active and transcribing chromatin structures."

M., Jr. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 3233--3240). One component has only a single residue of lysine and the other has none. The consideration arose that lysine-containing peptide segments may be less stable than those containing arginine because of the fluctuations of the side groups of the former residue. The small epsilon amino groups may not be able to sustain solvation of the hydrophobic arm in an aqueous medium. Arginine residues have shorter hydrophobic arms, larger hydrophilic groups, and higher pKa values and, thus may be less motile than lysine. The hypothesis was tested by guanidination of seven globular proteins (bovine carbonic anhydrase, chymotrypsinogen, alpha-lactalbumin, serum albumin, ribonuclease, hen egg lysozyme, and horse heart cytochrome c). Conversion of lysine residues to homoarginine was between 90 and 99%. Tritium-hydrogen isotope exchange revealed that all proteins except lysozyme demonstrated reduced out-exchange after guanidination. The results with lysozyme were not unexpected since only this protein has a high arginine to lysine ratio. These findings suggest that high arginine to lysine ratios contribute to protein stability."
https://openalex.org/W1550633696,"Three derivatives of ouabain have been synthesized which alkylate the digitalis receptor. These derivatives were formed through reductive amination of p-nitrophenyltriazene (NPT) ethylenediamine to the periodate-oxidized rhamnose moiety of ouabain. The non-covalent binding of the ouabain derivatives (NPT-ouabain, designated I, II, and III) was followed (i) by their ability to inhibit the activity of sodium- and potassium-activated ATPase ((Na+,K+)-ATPase) purified from the electric organ of Electrophorus electricus, (ii) by the binding of [3H]NPT-ouabain I to the enzyme, and (iii) by the inhibition of [3H]ouabain binding with unlabeled NPT-ouabain I. Covalent modification of the digitalis site of (Na+,K+)-ATPase occurs after long periods of time. At pH 7.5 (25 degrees C) the best alkylating derivative, NPT-ouabain I, gives maximum covalent labeling after 6 h. Only the large polypeptide chain (Mr = 93,000) of the purified enzyme is specifically labeled with [3H]NPT-ouabain I while the glycoprotein chain (Mr = 47,000) is not significantly labeled. Labeling of a microsomal fraction of the electric organ with [3H]NPT-ouabain I gave the same type of gel pattern as that observed with the purified enzyme. [3H]NPT-ouabain I was also used to label the digitalis receptor in highly purified axonal membranes and in cardiac membranes prepared from embryonic chick heart. Although the (Na+,K+)-ATPase in both types of membranes has a low affinity for ouabain, [3H]NPT-ouabain I proved to be a very efficient affinity label for the digitalis receptor. In the complex mixture of polypeptides found in these membrane preparations, only a single polypeptide chain having a Mr = 93,000 is specifically labeled by [3H]NPT-ouabain I."
https://openalex.org/W1541805044,"A particulate fraction of rat intestinal mucosal homogenates, termed the complex, contains three vitamin D-dependent activities: calcium binding of high affinity, calcium-dependent adenosine triphosphatase, and p-nitrophenylphosphatase. These particulate activities vary concordantly with intestinal calcium transport, suggesting that they represent membrane components of the translocation mechanism. The particulate was solubilized with 1-butanol and the activities were resolved partially by gel filtration and by DEAE-cellulose and spheroidal hydroxyl-apatite column chromatography. The Ca-binding activity was separated from the enzymes and isolated as a protein of molecular weight approximately 200,000, as estimated by gel filtration in 0.1% Triton X-100. The membrane protein, named IMCal (intestinal membrane calcium-binding protein), was dissociated with sodium dodecyl sulfate to yield a monomer of molecular weight 20,500 which is clearly distinguishable from the soluble calcium-binding protein (molecular weight 11,500) of rat mucosa. The apparent dissociation constants of Ca2+ of IMCal and of the soluble calcium-binding protein were estimated as 0.37 microM and 2.25 microM, respectively. The vitamin D-dependent activities of the calcium-binding complex are present in isolated intestinal microvillus membranes and may mediate the translocation of calcium from the intestinal lumen to the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1547115807,One to two molecules of tightly bound cardiolipin are associated with resolved fractions of cytochrome oxidase containing subunits I to III or I to IV. Large scale isolation of subunits I to IV indicates the presence of approximately 0.5 molecule of cardiolipin per molecule of subunit I. Lipoprotein staining of sodium dodecyl sulfate/urea/acrylamide gels of cytochrome oxidase support the findings that subunit I is a lipoprotein. The resistance of this tightly bound cardiolipin to organic solvent extraction suggests a specific association of some tenacity with the protein.
https://openalex.org/W1509999489,"Cytosol prepared from vitamin D3-deficient kidney cells in culture contains a 3.7 S protein that specifically binds 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 with high affinity and low capacity. Whole kidney homogenate cytosol preparations are shown to possess two 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 binding macromolecules. One of the binding proteins sediments at 3.5 to 3.7 S while the second sediments at 6.0 S. The 6.0 S component has a greater affinity for 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 than for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Cultured cell cytosol was found to have little 6.0 S 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 binding protein. Scatchard analysis of the cultured cell cytosol reveals an equilibrium binding constant (KD) of 5.6 x 10 (-11) with 57 fmol of sites/mg of protein. The receptor-like protein has a Mr = 72,000 and as with other steroid receptors it aggregates in the presence of low potassium concentrations. Analog competition for receptor binding reveals the following potency order: 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 > 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 > 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 > 24(R),25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; the receptor had no detectable affinity for vitamin D3. The kidney cells respond to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 by diminishing 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1 alpha-hydroxylation and increasing 24R-hydroxylation. Cultured cells provide a preparation of cytosol which has allowed extensive characterization of the renal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor and should facilitate investigations into the role this receptor plays in renal control of vitamin D3 metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1554305289,"We describe the solubilization and purification of both the photoaffinity-labeled and unlabeled human placenta receptor for epidermal growth factor-urogastrone (EGF-URO). The photolabeled receptor can be purified 300- to 500-fold from membrane extracts by combined immunoaffinity and lectin-agarose affinity chromatography. This isolation approaches theoretical purity. Upon gel filtration and wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose chromatography, the photolabeled receptor and the EGF-URO binding activity co-migrate, as measured by a newly developed lectin-agarose immobilization assay of receptor binding. Sequential ion exchange, Cibacron blue-Sepharose, wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose, and gel filtration chromatography yield a 110-fold purification of the EGF-URO binding activity; this purified fraction contains protein constituents that exhibit electrophoretic mobilities parallel to those of the photolabeled receptor constituents, that have apparent molecular weights of 180,000 and 160,000. This molecular weight range is consistent with a measured apparent Stokes radius for both the photolabeled and unlabeled receptor of 5.1 nm (Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration), although an apparent radius of 4.3 nm is estimated by gel filtration on Sepharose-6B. The apparent molecular weight of the photolabeled receptor is unaffected by 2-mercaptoethanol. This work provides a basis for further detailed studies of this growth factor receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1560201248,"Abstract We have examined the properties of microtubules formed in the presence of GTP, 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate (GMPP(NH)P), and 5'-guanylyl methylenediphosphate (GMPP(CH2)P) to identify features of the assembly or disassembly reactions uniquely related to hydrolysis. The assembly of microtubules with GTP or GMPP(NH)P was similar in terms of rates and extents of assembly, the length distributions, and podophyllotoxin-induced depolymerization. The greater rapidity of GMPP(CH2)P-supported assembly, however, resulted in shorter, more numerous microtubules and the rate of podophyllotoxin-induced depolymerization was consistent with an increased number of concentration of microtubules. Experiments with GTP or analogue incorporation and release indicated that GTP-tubule turnover corresponded to a rate of about 8% of the microtubule protein taken up or released per h. With GMPP(NH)P- and GMPP(CH2)P-tubules, the rates of label uptake by unlabeled microtubules were considerably lower than observed with guanosine triphosphate. We suggest that exchange experiments can reflect contributions from head-to-tail polymerization and polymer length redistribution, but it is not as yet possible to evaluate the relative contributions of each process."

https://openalex.org/W1496865997,"3-N-Carboxymethyl-His-12 and 1-N-carboxymethyl-His-119-RNase A bind to the naturally occurring RNase inhibitor, isolated from human placenta, 1.3 and 3.6 times, respectively, more strongly than does native RNase A. Near-ultraviolet circular dichroism measurements indicate that the conformational change which occurs upon carboxymethylation of either of the active site histidine residues appears different from that which the protein undergoes upon binding of substrate of a substrate analogue. Specific carboxymethylation of Lys-41 of RNase A decreased the strength of the interaction between the enzyme and the RNase inhibitor to about 12% of the initial value. The near-UV CD spectra of Cm-Lys-41-RNase A and of acetimidyl-RNase A (9.3 lysines modified) and carbamylated RNase A (3.0 lysines modified), which also have weaker interactions with RNase inhibitor of 25% and 10%, respectively, show a negative [theta]MRW identical to that of native RNase A at 275 nm but are altered in the positive [theta]MRW at 240 nm. The CD measurements suggest that one or more tyrosine residues of RNase A may be involved in the interaction with inhibitor. The effects of pH and salt concentration suggest that a major part of the protein-protein interaction is probably through nonpolar forces. The strengths of interactions between the inhibitor and pancreatic RNases from several species were very similar. Since Tyr-92 is the only tyrosine residue retained in all of the species studied, this residue may have a key role in the nonpolar interaction. The data presented herein suggest that the interaction between RNase A and the inhibitor involves the positively charged epsilon-NH2 group of Lys-41 of RNase A. This interaction could result in the inactivation of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1574969760,"The organization of the genes in the rRNA coding region of Euglene gracilis Pringsheim strain Z chloroplast DNA has been determined. 125I labeled 16 S rRNA, 125I labeled 23 S rRNA, and [32P]tRNAs were hybridized to restriction nuclease fragments from cloned chloroplast DNA segments. The coding regions for 16 S and 23 S rRNAs have been located to within 1.75 and 3.1 kbp, respectively. Transfer rRNA genes are located in the 16 S to 23 S rRNA spacer region. Ribosomal RNAs and tRNAs are encoded on the same DNA strand in the 6.2 kbp tandemly repeated rRNA gene region. The order of genes, which is repeated three times in chloroplast DNA, is 16 S rRNA–tRNAS–23 S rRNA–5 S rRNA. Each set of genes is clustered in a region of 5.0 kbp. The organization and size of the genes is as expected if they are all part of a single transcription unit."

https://openalex.org/W1520935001,"Abstract Bovine thymus chromatin contains a cAMP-independent histone kinase which is entirely specific for a single site on H3 whether the histone substrate is soluble or associated with DNA in chromatin (Shoemaker, C. B., and Chalkley, R. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 5802--5807). The H3-kinase has been extracted, purified 2000-fold and extensively characterized. The purified enzyme produces a single band upon neutral gel electrophoresis and two distinct bands of 21,000 and 23,000 daltons upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. Following subcellular fractionation, most or all of the enzymatic activity is associated with chromatin. Soluble histone inactivates H3-kinase after short incubations while a chromatin substrate permits the enzyme to remain active until H3 is fully phosphorylated. Assay conditions have been optimized in terms of pH and several cofactor concentrations. Optimal MgCl2 concentration occurs at 50 mM, while for MnCl2 the optimum is 300 microM. H3-kinase has a molecular weight of 38,000 as estimated by exclusion chromatography. The Km for ATP is 160 +/- 23 microM. The enzyme displays extraordinary substrate specificity for H3 histone as no other thymus protein has been observed as a substrate. Phosphorylation of H3 occurs at threonine residue 3."
https://openalex.org/W1574065386,"Abstract Glycogen synthase I, purified from bovine heart, had a specific activity of 33 units/mg and gave a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis with a subunit molecular weight of 86,000. The enzyme was phosphorylated with cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, also isolated from heart. With 10 microM ATP, only one phosphate group was incorporated per subunit of glycogen synthase. The phosphorylation decreased the per cent of glycogen synthase I from 0.95 to 0.50 when activity was determined by assays with Na2SO4 and glucose 6-phosphate. Glycogen synthase containing one phosphate per subunit was designated GS-1. One additional phosphate was incorporated per synthase subunit when ATP was increased to 0.5 mM and the percent glycogen synthase I decreased from 0.50 to < 0.05. This enzyme form was designated GS-1,2. Conversion of GS-1 to Gs-1,2 gave cooperative kinetics with ATP concentration and a half-maximal stimulation at approximately 40 microM. Phosphorylation of GS-1 could also be achieved by adding other non-substrate nucleotide triphosphates such as ITP and UTP along with 10 microM ATP. Glucose-6-P and Na2SO4 were without effect on this phosphorylation reaction. Two separate peptides were obtained after CNBr cleavage of 32P-labeled GS-1,2 and only one from GS-1. Both enzyme forms contained a single phosphorylated peptide in common. Thus, heart glycogen synthase may be phosphorylated specifically in either of two different sites using appropriate concentrations of ATP. ATP acts as a substrate for the protein kinase and also affects the availability of a second site to phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1591683331,The hydrolysis of cGMP by phosphodiesterase was conducted in [18O]water to determine the site of bond cleavage and the stoichiometry of 18O incorporation into 5'-GMP. Three different forms of phosphodiesterase including a calmodulin-calcium-dependent enzyme in its basal and activated states were examined. The hydrolysis of cGMP catalyzed by each of the forms of phosphodiesterase proceeded with incorporation of 1 18O atom recoverable in the phosphate moiety of each molecule of 5'-GMP generated. No molecular species of phosphate deriving from the 5'-GMP generated containing two or three 18O were detectable. These results indicate that the phosphodiesterase-catalyzed hydrolysis of cGMP proceeds by nucleophilic substitution at phosphorus resulting in P-O bond cleavage. The stoichiometry of 18O incorporation indicates that the reaction proceeds without phosphate-water oxygen exchange when the hydrolytic reaction is catalyzed by diverse forms of phosphodiesterase in the basal or activated state. These considerations of the phosphodiesterase reaction help to establish the validity of monitoring the rate of enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of cGMP as a function of the rate of 18O-labeling of the phosphate of 5'-GMP when the reaction proceeds in a medium of predetermined 18O enrichment.

This enzyme resembles the nuclease of mammalian nuclei in requirements for bivalent cations and in production of large chromatin fragments that gradually decrease in size, but differs in that the products do not go through the stage of discrete bands on gel electrophoresis. Endogenous nuclease and micrococcal nuclease are also detectable in mononucleosomes prepared from chicken erythrocytes with the aid of micrococcal nuclease. Both nucleases are extractable with 0.35 M NaCl, and both are inhibited by pTp.
