https://openalex.org/W1976391205,"A CRISPR-Cas system allows editing of the genome in zebrafish embryos. In bacteria, foreign nucleic acids are silenced by clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems. Bacterial type II CRISPR systems have been adapted to create guide RNAs that direct site-specific DNA cleavage by the Cas9 endonuclease in cultured cells. Here we show that the CRISPR-Cas system functions in vivo to induce targeted genetic modifications in zebrafish embryos with efficiencies similar to those obtained using zinc finger nucleases and transcription activator–like effector nucleases."
https://openalex.org/W2000046950,"Here we use the clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated Cas9 endonuclease complexed with dual-RNAs to introduce precise mutations in the genomes of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. The approach relies on dual-RNA:Cas9-directed cleavage at the targeted genomic site to kill unmutated cells and circumvents the need for selectable markers or counter-selection systems. We reprogram dual-RNA:Cas9 specificity by changing the sequence of short CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to make single- and multinucleotide changes carried on editing templates. Simultaneous use of two crRNAs enables multiplex mutagenesis. In S. pneumoniae, nearly 100% of cells that were recovered using our approach contained the desired mutation, and in E. coli, 65% that were recovered contained the mutation, when the approach was used in combination with recombineering. We exhaustively analyze dual-RNA:Cas9 target requirements to define the range of targetable sequences and show strategies for editing sites that do not meet these requirements, suggesting the versatility of this technique for bacterial genome engineering."

https://openalex.org/W2124205424,"Myostatin (Mstn) is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscles and plays important roles in regulating muscle growth and development, as well as fat deposition. Mstn-knockout (Mstn(-/-)) mice exhibit increased muscle mass due to both hypertrophy and hyperplasia, and leaner body composition due to reduced fat mass. Here, we show that white adipose tissue (WAT) of Mstn(-/-) develops characteristics of brown adipose tissue (BAT) with dramatically increased expression of BAT signature genes, including Ucp1 and Pgc1α, and beige adipocyte markers Tmem26 and CD137. Strikingly, the observed browning phenotype is non-cell autonomous and is instead driven by the newly defined myokine irisin (Fndc5) secreted from Mstn(-/-) skeletal muscle. Within the muscle, Mstn(-/-) leads to increased expression of AMPK and its phosphorylation, which subsequently activates PGC1α and Fndc5. Together, our study defines a paradigm of muscle-fat crosstalk mediated by Fndc5, which is up-regulated and secreted from muscle to induce beige cell markers and the browning of WAT in Mstn(-/-) mice. These results suggest that targeting muscle Mstn and its downstream signaling represents a therapeutic approach to treat obesity and type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2091811248,"Leaves within a canopy may experience rapid and extreme fluctuations in ambient conditions. A shaded leaf, for example, may become exposed to an order of magnitude increase in solar radiation within a few seconds, due to sunflecks or canopy motions. Considering typical time scales for stomatal adjustments, (2 to 60 minutes), the gap between these two time scales raised the question whether leaves rely on their hydraulic and thermal capacitances for passive protection from hydraulic failure or over-heating until stomata have adjusted. We employed a physically based model to systematically study effects of short-term fluctuations in irradiance on leaf temperatures and transpiration rates. Considering typical amplitudes and time scales of such fluctuations, the importance of leaf heat and water capacities for avoiding damaging leaf temperatures and hydraulic failure were investigated. The results suggest that common leaf heat capacities are not sufficient to protect a non-transpiring leaf from over-heating during sunflecks of several minutes duration whereas transpirative cooling provides effective protection. A comparison of the simulated time scales for heat damage in the absence of evaporative cooling with observed stomatal response times suggested that stomata must be already open before arrival of a sunfleck to avoid over-heating to critical leaf temperatures. This is consistent with measured stomatal conductances in shaded leaves and has implications for water use efficiency of deep canopy leaves and vulnerability to heat damage during drought. Our results also suggest that typical leaf water contents could sustain several minutes of evaporative cooling during a sunfleck without increasing the xylem water supply and thus risking embolism. We thus submit that shaded leaves rely on hydraulic capacitance and evaporative cooling to avoid over-heating and hydraulic failure during exposure to typical sunflecks, whereas thermal capacitance provides limited protection for very short sunflecks (tens of seconds)."
https://openalex.org/W2011752552,"CLU (clusterin) is a tumor suppressor gene that we have previously shown to be negatively modulated by the MYCN proto-oncogene, but the mechanism of repression was unclear. Here, we show that MYCN inhibits the expression of CLU by direct interaction with the non-canonical E box sequence CACGCG in the 5'-flanking region. Binding of MYCN to the CLU gene induces bivalent epigenetic marks and recruitment of repressive proteins such as histone deacetylases and Polycomb members. MYCN physically binds in vitro and in vivo to EZH2, a component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2, required to repress CLU. Notably, EZH2 interacts with the Myc box domain 3, a segment of MYC known to be essential for its transforming effects. The expression of CLU can be restored in MYCN-amplified cells by epigenetic drugs with therapeutic results. Importantly, the anticancer effects of the drugs are ablated if CLU expression is blunted by RNA interference. Our study implies that MYC tumorigenesis can be effectively antagonized by epigenetic drugs that interfere with the recruitment of chromatin modifiers at repressive E boxes of tumor suppressor genes such as CLU."
https://openalex.org/W2086652209,"Background Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) positivity represents a novel molecular target in a subset of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers (NSCLC). We explore Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) as diagnostic methods for ALK positive patients and to describe its prevalence and outcomes in a population of NSCLC patients. Methods NSCLC patients previously screened for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) at our institution were selected. ALK positive patients were identified by FISH and the value of IHC (D5F3) was explored. Results ninety-nine patients were identified. Median age was 61.5 years (range 35–83), all were caucasians, eighty percent were adenocarcinomas, fifty-one percent were male and thirty-eight percent were current smokers. Seven (7.1%) patients were ALK positive by FISH, thirteen (13.1%) were EGFR mutant, and 65 (65.6%) were negative/Wild Type (WT) for both ALK and EGFR. ALK positivity and EGFR mutations were mutually exclusive. ALK positive patients tend to be younger than EGFR mutated or wt patients. ALK positive patients were predominantly never smokers (71.4%) and adenocarcinoma (71.4%). ALK positive and EGFR mutant patients have a better outcome than negative/WT. All patients with ALK FISH negative tumours were negative for ALK IHC. Out of 6 patients positive for ALK FISH with more tissue available, 5 were positive for ALK IHC and 1 negative. Conclusions ALK positive patients represent 7.1% of a population of selected NSCLC. ALK positive patients have different clinical features and a better outcome than EGFR WT and ALK negative patients. IHC is a promising method for detecting ALK positive NSCLC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2014216753,"Human amniotic fluid obtained at amniocentesis, when cultured, generates at least two morphologically distinct mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) subsets. Of these, the spindle shaped amniotic fluid MSCs (SS-AF-MSCs) contain multipotent cells with enhanced adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic capacity. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, the capacity of these SS-AF-MSCs to support neovascularization by umbilical cord blood (UCB) endothelial colony forming cell (ECFC) derived cells in both in vitro and in vivo models. Interestingly, although the kinetics of vascular tubule formation in vitro were similar when the supporting SS-AF-MSCs were compared with the best vasculogenic supportive batches of bone marrow MSCs (BMSCs) or human dermal fibroblasts (hDFs), SS-AF-MSCs supported vascular tubule formation in vivo more effectively than BMSCs. In NOD/SCID mice, the human vessels inosculated with murine vessels demonstrating their functionality. Proteome profiler array analyses revealed both common and distinct secretion profiles of angiogenic factors by the SS-AF-MSCs as opposed to the hDFs and BMSCs. Thus, SS-AF-MSCs, which are considered to be less mature developmentally than adult BMSCs, and intermediate between adult and embryonic stem cells in their potentiality, have the additional and very interesting potential of supporting increased neovascularisation, further enhancing their promise as vehicles for tissue repair and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2039956167,"Elevated circulating lipid levels are known risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In order to examine the effects of quercetin on lipid metabolism, mice received a mild-high-fat diet without (control) or with supplementation of 0.33% (w/w) quercetin for 12 weeks. Gas chromatography and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance were used to quantitatively measure serum lipid profiles. Whole genome microarray analysis of liver tissue was used to identify possible mechanisms underlying altered circulating lipid levels. Body weight, energy intake and hepatic lipid accumulation did not differ significantly between the quercetin and the control group. In serum of quercetin-fed mice, triglycerides (TG) were decreased with 14% (p<0.001) and total poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were increased with 13% (p<0.01). Palmitic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid were all decreased by 9–15% (p<0.05) in quercetin-fed mice. Both palmitic acid and oleic acid can be oxidized by omega (ω)-oxidation. Gene expression profiling showed that quercetin increased hepatic lipid metabolism, especially ω-oxidation. At the gene level, this was reflected by the up-regulation of cytochrome P450 (Cyp) 4a10, Cyp4a14, Cyp4a31 and Acyl-CoA thioesterase 3 (Acot3). Two relevant regulators, cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (Por, rate limiting for cytochrome P450s) and the transcription factor constitutive androstane receptor (Car; official symbol Nr1i3) were also up-regulated in the quercetin-fed mice. We conclude that quercetin intake increased hepatic lipid ω-oxidation and lowered corresponding circulating lipid levels, which may contribute to potential beneficial effects on CVD."
https://openalex.org/W2022080291,"Osteocyte viability is a critical determinant of bone strength and is promoted by both mechanical stimulation and activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Earlier studies demonstrated that both stimuli promote survival of osteocytes by activating the ERKs. Here, we show that there is interaction between the caveolin-1/ERK and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways in the transduction of mechanical cues into osteocyte survival. Thus, ERK nuclear translocation and anti-apoptosis induced by mechanical stimulation are abolished by the Wnt antagonist Dkk1 and the β-catenin degradation stimulator Axin2. Conversely, GSK3β phosphorylation and β-catenin accumulation induced by mechanical stimulation are abolished by either pharmacologic inhibition of ERKs or silencing caveolin-1. In contrast, the canonical Wnt signaling inhibitor dominant-negative T cell factor does not alter ERK nuclear translocation or survival induced by mechanical stimulation. These findings demonstrate that β-catenin accumulation is an essential component of the mechanotransduction machinery in osteocytes, albeit β-catenin/T cell factor-mediated transcription is not required. The simultaneous requirement of β-catenin for ERK activation and of ERK activation for β-catenin accumulation suggests a bidirectional crosstalk between the caveolin-1/ERK and Wnt/β-catenin pathways in mechanotransduction leading to osteocyte survival.

https://openalex.org/W2075874898,"Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) phosphorylates smooth muscle myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) to initiate contraction. We used a tamoxifen-activated, smooth muscle-specific inactivation of MLCK expression in adult mice to determine whether MLCK was differentially limiting in distinct smooth muscles. A 50% decrease in MLCK in urinary bladder smooth muscle had no effect on RLC phosphorylation or on contractile responses, whereas an 80% decrease resulted in only a 20% decrease in RLC phosphorylation and contractile responses to the muscarinic agonist carbachol. Phosphorylation of the myosin light chain phosphatase regulatory subunit MYPT1 at Thr-696 and Thr-853 and the inhibitor protein CPI-17 were also stimulated with carbachol. These results are consistent with the previous findings that activation of a small fraction of MLCK by limiting amounts of free Ca2+/calmodulin combined with myosin light chain phosphatase inhibition is sufficient for robust RLC phosphorylation and contractile responses in bladder smooth muscle. In contrast, a 50% decrease in MLCK in aortic smooth muscle resulted in 40% inhibition of RLC phosphorylation and aorta contractile responses, whereas a 90% decrease profoundly inhibited both responses. Thus, MLCK content is limiting for contraction in aortic smooth muscle. Phosphorylation of CPI-17 and MYPT1 at Thr-696 and Thr-853 were also stimulated with phenylephrine but significantly less than in bladder tissue. These results indicate differential contributions of MLCK to signaling. Limiting MLCK activity combined with modest Ca2+ sensitization responses provide insights into how haploinsufficiency of MLCK may result in contractile dysfunction in vivo, leading to dissections of human thoracic aorta.

https://openalex.org/W2035909106,"The retromer complex localizes to endosomal membranes and is involved in protein trafficking. In mammals, it is composed of a dimer of sorting nexins and of the core retromer consisting of vacuolar protein sorting (VPS)26, VPS29, and VPS35. Although homologs of these proteins have been identified in plants, how the plant retromer functions remains elusive. To better understand the role of VPS components in the assembly and function of the core retromer, we characterize here Arabidopsis vps26-null mutants. We show that impaired VPS26 function has a dramatic effect on VPS35 levels and causes severe phenotypic defects similar to those observed in vps29-null mutants. This implies that functions of plant VPS26, VPS29, and VPS35 are tightly linked. Then, by combining live-cell imaging with immunochemical and genetic approaches, we report that VPS35 alone is able to bind to endosomal membranes and plays an essential role in VPS26 and VPS29 membrane recruitment. We also show that the Arabidopsis Rab7 homolog RABG3f participates in the recruitment of the core retromer to the endosomal membrane by interacting with VPS35. Altogether our data provide original information on the molecular interactions that mediate assembly of the core retromer in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2108625901,"A major challenge for strategies to combat the human malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax is the presence of hypnozoites in the liver. These dormant forms can cause renewed clinical disease after reactivation through unknown mechanisms. The closely related non-human primate malaria P. cynomolgi is a frequently used model for studying hypnozoite-induced relapses. Here we report the generation of the first transgenic P. cynomolgi parasites that stably express fluorescent markers in liver stages by transfection with novel DNA-constructs containing a P. cynomolgi centromere. Analysis of fluorescent liver stages in culture identified, in addition to developing liver-schizonts, uninucleate persisting parasites that were atovaquone resistant but primaquine sensitive, features associated with hypnozoites. We demonstrate that these hypnozoite-forms could be isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The fluorescently-tagged parasites in combination with FACS-purification open new avenues for a wide range of studies for analysing hypnozoite biology and reactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1989240813,"Neurodegenerative diseases associated with the pathological aggregation of microtubule-associated protein Tau are classified as tauopathies. Alzheimer disease, the most common tauopathy, is characterized by neurofibrillary tangles that are mainly composed of abnormally phosphorylated Tau. Similar hyperphosphorylated Tau lesions are found in patients with frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) that is induced by mutations within the tau gene. To further understand the etiology of tauopathies, it will be important to elucidate the mechanism underlying Tau hyperphosphorylation. Tau phosphorylation occurs mainly at proline-directed Ser/Thr sites, which are targeted by protein kinases such as GSK3β and Cdk5. We reported previously that dephosphorylation of Tau at Cdk5-mediated sites was enhanced by Pin1, a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that stimulates dephosphorylation at proline-directed sites by protein phosphatase 2A. Pin1 deficiency is suggested to cause Tau hyperphosphorylation in Alzheimer disease. Up to the present, Pin1 binding was only shown for two Tau phosphorylation sites (Thr-212 and Thr-231) despite the presence of many more hyperphosphorylated sites. Here, we analyzed the interaction of Pin1 with Tau phosphorylated by Cdk5-p25 using a GST pulldown assay and Biacore approach. We found that Pin1 binds and stimulates dephosphorylation of Tau at all Cdk5-mediated sites (Ser-202, Thr-205, Ser-235, and Ser-404). Furthermore, FTDP-17 mutant Tau (P301L or R406W) showed slightly weaker Pin1 binding than non-mutated Tau, suggesting that FTDP-17 mutations induce hyperphosphorylation by reducing the interaction between Pin1 and Tau. Together, these results indicate that Pin1 is generally involved in the regulation of Tau hyperphosphorylation and hence the etiology of tauopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2039217550,"Intramolecular disulfide bond formation is promoted in oxidizing extracellular and endoplasmic reticulum compartments and often contributes to protein stability and function. DUOX1 and DUOX2 are distinguished from other members of the NOX protein family by the presence of a unique extracellular N-terminal region. These peroxidase-like domains lack the conserved cysteines that confer structural stability to mammalian peroxidases. Sequence-based structure predictions suggest that the thiol groups present are solvent-exposed on a single protein surface and are too distant to support intramolecular disulfide bond formation. To investigate the role of these thiol residues, we introduced four individual cysteine to glycine mutations in the peroxidase-like domains of both human DUOXs and purified the recombinant proteins. The mutations caused little change in the stabilities of the monomeric proteins, supporting the hypothesis that the thiol residues are solvent-exposed and not involved in disulfide bonds that are critical for structural integrity. However, the ability of the isolated hDUOX1 peroxidase-like domain to dimerize was altered, suggesting a role for these cysteines in protein-protein interactions that could facilitate homodimerization of the peroxidase-like domain or, in the full-length protein, heterodimeric interactions with a maturation protein. When full-length hDUOX1 was expressed in HEK293 cells, the mutations resulted in decreased H2O2 production that correlated with a decreased amount of the enzyme localized to the membrane surface rather than with a loss of activity or with a failure to synthesize the mutant proteins. These results support a role for the cysteine residues in intermolecular disulfide bond formation with the DUOX maturation factor DUOXA1."
https://openalex.org/W2008786552,"Bacteriophage lytic enzymes have recently attracted considerable interest as novel antimicrobials against Gram-positive bacteria. In this work, antimicrobial activity in milk of HydH5 [a virion-associated peptidoglycan hydrolase (VAPGH) encoded by the Staphylococcus aureus bacteriophage vB_SauS-phiIPLA88], and three different fusion proteins created between HydH5 and lysostaphin has been assessed. The lytic activity of the five proteins (HydH5, HydH5Lyso, HydH5SH3b, CHAPSH3b and lysostaphin) was confirmed using commercial whole extended shelf-life milk (ESL) in challenge assays with 104 CFU/mL of the strain S. aureus Sa9. HydH5, HydH5Lyso and HydH5SH3b (3.5 µM) kept the staphylococcal viable counts below the control cultures for 6 h at 37°C. The effect is apparent just 15 minutes after the addition of the lytic enzyme. Of note, lysostaphin and CHAPSH3b showed the highest staphylolytic protection as they were able to eradicate the initial staphylococcal challenge immediately or 15 min after addition, respectively, at lower concentration (1 µM) at 37°C. CHAPSH3b showed the same antistaphyloccal effect at room temperature (1.65 µM). No re-growth was observed for the remainder of the experiment (up to 6 h). CHAPSH3b activity (1.65 µM) was also assayed in raw (whole and skim) and pasteurized (whole and skim) milk. Pasteurization of milk clearly enhanced CHAPSH3b staphylolytic activity in both whole and skim milk at both temperatures. This effect was most dramatic at room temperature as this protein was able to reduce S. aureus viable counts to undetectable levels immediately after addition with no re-growth detected for the duration of the experiment (360 min). Furthermore, CHAPSH3b protein is known to be heat tolerant and retained some lytic activity after pasteurization treatment and after storage at 4°C for 3 days. These results might facilitate the use of the peptidoglycan hydrolase HydH5 and its derivative fusions, particularly CHAPSH3b, as biocontrol agents for controlling undesirable bacteria in dairy products."
https://openalex.org/W2048983733,"Blood and spleen expansion of immature myeloid cells (IMCs) might compromise the immune response to cancer. We studied in vivo circulating and splenic T lymphocyte and IMC subsets in patients with benign and malignant pancreatic diseases. We ascertained in vitro whether pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC)-associated IMC subsets are induced by tumor-derived soluble factors and whether they are immunosuppressive focusing on the inhibitory co-stimulatory molecules PDL1 and CTLA4.103 pancreatic and/or splenic surgical patients were enrolled including 52 PDAC, 10 borderline and 10 neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Lymphocytes and IMCs were analysed by flow cytometry in blood, in spleen and in three PDAC cell conditioned (CM) or non conditioned PBMC. PDL1 and CTLA4 were studied in 30 splenic samples, in control and conditioned PBMC. IMCs were FACS sorted and co-coltured with allogenic T lymphocytes. In PDAC a reduction was found in circulating CD8(+) lymphocytes (p = 0.004) and dendritic cells (p = 0.01), which were reduced in vitro by one PDAC CM (Capan1; p = 0.03). Blood myeloid derived suppressive cells (MDSCs) CD33(+)CD14(-)HLA-DR(-) were increased in PDAC (p = 0.022) and were induced in vitro by BxPC3 CM. Splenic dendritic cells had a higher PDL1 expression (p = 0.007), while CD33(+)CD14(+)HLA-DR(-) IMCs had a lower CTLA4 expression (p = 0.029) in PDAC patients. In vitro S100A8/A9 complex, one of the possible inflammatory mediators of immune suppression in PDAC, induced PDL1 (p = 0.018) and reduced CTLA4 expression (p = 0.028) among IMCs. IMCs not expressing CTLA4 were demonstrated to be immune suppressive.In PDAC circulating dendritic and cytotoxic T cells are reduced, while MDSCs are increased and this might favour tumoral growth and progression. The reduced CTLA4 expression found among splenic IMCs of PDAC patients was demonstrated to characterize an immune suppressive phenotype and to be consequent to the direct exposure of myeloid cells to pancreatic cancer derived products, S100A8/A9 complex in particular."

Methodology/Principal Findings In this project we took advantage of an in vitro human model, that we have established in our laboratory for long time to study megakaryocyte development from human cord blood-derived progenitor cells, and we demonstrated that increasing doses of AMG531 (100 to 2000 ng/mL) determine a progressive increase of megakaryocyte proliferation with a parallel decrease in megakaryocyte ploidy and capacity of extending proplatelets. Most importantly, these differences in megakaryocyte function seemed to be correlated to modulation of AKT phosphorylation.

https://openalex.org/W2004930901,"Apart from the antihyperglycemic effects, DPP4 inhibitors and GLP-1 molecules are involved in the preservation of cardiac functions. We have demonstrated that DPP4-deficient rats possess resistance to endotoxemia and ischemia/reperfusion stress. However, whether the decrease of DPP4 activity simply augmented the GLP-1 signaling or that such decrease resulted in a change of cellular function remain unclear. Accordingly, we investigated the responses of H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress in adult wild-type and DPP4-deficient rats isolated cardiomyocytes. The coadministration of GLP-1 or DPP4 inhibitor was also performed to define the mechanisms. Cell viability, ROS concentration, catalase activity, glucose uptake, prosurvival, proapoptotic signaling, and contractile function were examined after cells exposed to H(2)O(2). DPP4-deficient cardiomyocytes were found to be resistant to H(2)O(2)-induced cell death via activating AKT signaling, enhancing glucose uptake, preserving catalase activity, diminishing ROS level and proapoptotic signaling. GLP-1 concentration-dependently improved cell viability in wild-type cardiomyocyte against ROS stress, and the ceiling response concentration (200 nM) was chosen for studies. GLP-1 was shown to decrease H(2)O(2)-induced cell death by its receptor-dependent AKT pathway in wild-type cardiomyocytes, but failed to cause further activation of AKT in DPP4-deficient cardiomyocytes. Acute treatment of DPP4 inhibitor only augmented the protective effect of low dose GLP-1, but failed to alter fuel utilization or ameliorate cell viability in wild-type cardiomyocytes after H(2)O(2) exposure. The improvement of cell viability after H(2)O(2) exposure was correlated with the alleviation of cellular contractile dysfunction in both DPP4-deficient and GLP-1 treated wild-type cardiomyocytes. These findings demonstrated that GLP-1 receptor-dependent pathway is important and exert protective effect in wild-type cardiomyocyte. Long term loss of DPP4 activity increased the capability against ROS stress, which was more than GLP-1 dependent pathway."

In contrast, upon xenograft transplantation of cells into immunodeficient mice, the dominant-negative GRK2-K220R or a GRK2-specific peptide inhibitor increased tumor mass.

The growth-promoting activity of GRK2 in vivo was attributed to kinase-dependent and kinase-independent effects of GRK2 involving Smoothened and Patched homolog 1 (2Philipp M. Fralish G.B.

Apart from its essential physiological role in growth and development, exaggerated GRK2 activity is an important pathophysiological feature of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and heart failure (5Gros R. Benovic J.L. Tan C.M. Feldman R.D. G-protein-coupled receptor kinase activity is increased in hypertension.J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2087-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 6Ungerer M.

Altered expression of β-adrenergic receptor kinase and β1-adrenergic receptors in the failing human heart.Circulation. 1993; 87: 454-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Under such conditions of increased GRK2 activity, GRK2 inhibition confers cardioprotection (7Brinks H. Koch W.J. Targeting G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) in heart failure.Drug Discov. Today Dis. Mech. 2010; 7: e129-e134Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore many research efforts focus on the development and characterization of GRK2-specific inhibitors (7Brinks H.

Protein kinase C switches the Raf kinase inhibitor from Raf-1 to GRK-2.Nature. 2003; 426: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). A common approach of GRK2 inhibition in vivo relies on expression of the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRK2, i.e. the βARK1ct (GRK2ct), which inhibits membrane translocation and activation of GRK2 by scavenging Gβγ subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins (10Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Samama P. Hamilton R.A. Bond R.A. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J.

However, neutralization of Gβγ subunits by the GRK2ct may also exert GRK2-independent effects, which could contribute to cardioprotection as well (13Völkers M. Weidenhammer C. Herzog N. Qiu G.

Res. 2011; 108: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The final “proof of concept” for a beneficial profile of GRK2 inhibition came from studies applying mice with cardiac-specific deletion of GRK2 where GRK2 deficiency protected against myocardial damage (14Raake P.W. Vinge L.E. Gao E. Boucher M. Rengo G. Chen X. DeGeorge Jr., B.R. Matkovich S. Houser S.R. Most P. Eckhart A.D. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Koch W.J. G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 ablation in cardiac myocytes before or after myocardial infarction prevents heart failure.Circ.

Cardiac G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 ablation induces a novel Ca2+ handling phenotype resistant to adverse alterations and remodeling after myocardial infarction.Circulation. 2012; 125: 2108-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although the beneficial cardiac profile of GRK2 inhibition is thus firmly established, mechanisms underlying cardioprotection are not fully understood. Because growth-regulatory pathways are essential for cardiomyocyte survival (16Kehat I. Molkentin J.D. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling in cardiac hypertrophy.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2010; 1188: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17Cheng H. Kari G. Dicker A.P. Rodeck U. Koch W.J. Force T. A novel preclinical strategy for identifying cardiotoxic kinase inhibitors and mechanisms of cardiotoxicity.Circ. Res. 2011; 109: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we considered the impact of GRK2 inhibition on cell growth and proliferation. However, the role of GRK2 in cell growth and proliferation is not clear, because in addition to the above mentioned growth-promoting activity, GRK2 can also exert growth inhibition leading to suppressed growth and proliferation of tumor cells (18Métayé T. Levillain P. Kraimps J.L. Perdrisot R. Immunohistochemical detection, regulation and antiproliferative function of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 in thyroid carcinomas.J.

Growth inhibition of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells by overexpression of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2.J. Cell Physiol. 2012; 227: 2371-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To address the role of GRK2 and GRK2 inhibition in cell growth and proliferation, we performed experiments with cultured cells, or expanded cells in vivo after xenograft transplantation into immunodeficient non-obese diabetic mice homozygous for the severe combined immune deficiency spontaneous mutation (NOD.Scid mice). Systemic effects of GRK2 inhibition were also analyzed in vivo with transgenic mice expressing a GRK2-specific peptide inhibitor under control of the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter/enhancer, which directs ubiquitous expression of a transgene. Furthermore, transgenic mice with myocardium-specific expression of GRK2 inhibitors were generated to assess their cardioprotective profile. We report here that GRK2 inhibition triggered the growth-promoting MAPK pathway, which promoted tumor growth but also conferred cardioprotection by preventing cardiomyocyte death. To generate mice with myocardium-specific overexpression of RKIP, a transgene placing the PEBP1 cDNA under control of the α-myosin heavy chain promoter (20Gulick J. Subramaniam A. Neumann J. Robbins J. Isolation and characterization of the mouse cardiac myosin heavy chain genes.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9180-9185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was constructed. For myocardium-specific expression of the GRK2-specific peptide inhibitor (GRK-Inh), a DNA fragment encoding the peptide sequence, MAKFERLQTVTNYFITSE (21Quitterer U. Pohl A. Langer A. Koller S.

The plasmid sequences were removed by NotI digestion, and the purified linear DNA (2 ng/μl) was injected into fertilized oocytes of superovulated B6 (C57BL/6J) and FVB (FVB/N) mice. Oviduct transfer of the injected embryos into pseudopregnant CD-1 mice was performed according to standard procedures (23Nagy A. Gertsenstein M. Vintersten K. Behringer R. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2003Google Scholar). Genomic DNA of the F0 generation was isolated from ear punch biopsies taken at 3–4 weeks of age and analyzed by PCR for integration of the transgene. Mice of two different transgenic lines each were born at Mendelian frequency and grew to adulthood normally. To assess the systemic effect of GRK2 inhibition by the GRK2-specific peptide inhibitor in vivo, we generated transgenic mice with expression of the GRK2-specific peptide inhibitor under control of the CMV immediate-early promoter/enhancer, which directs ubiquitous expression of a transgene. To generate CMV-GRK-Inh transgenic mice, the DNA fragment encoding the peptide sequence MAKFERLQTVTNYFITSE was inserted into the pcDNA3.1 plasmid (Invitrogen). Plasmid sequences were removed by MluI and DraIII digestion, and the purified linear DNA (2 ng/μl) was injected into fertilized oocytes of superovulated B6 and FVB mice. Oviduct transfer of the injected embryos into pseudopregnant CD-1 mice and all subsequent steps were performed as detailed above.

Establishment of an in vivo model facilitates B2 receptor protein maturation and heterodimerization.Integr. Biol. (Camb.). 2010; 2: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in high-glucose DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 4 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C, in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. The cell proliferation assay was performed essentially as detailed previously (3Jiang X. Yang P. Ma L.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 10183-10188Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As indicated, HEK cells were also cultured in growth factor-supplemented (50 ng/ml of epidermal growth factor (EGF)) DMEM and plated on mitomycin-inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) as feeder cells essentially as described (25Oka Y.

Med. 2010; 6: 149-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For in vivo cell expansion, NOD.Scid mice (age 3 months) received an injection of 6–8 × 106 cells/200 μl of PBS (24Abd Alla J. Pohl A. Reeck K. Streichert T. Quitterer U. Establishment of an in vivo model facilitates B2 receptor protein maturation and heterodimerization.Integr. Biol. (Camb.). 2010; 2: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Two weeks (A431) or 4 weeks (HEK) after the injection, mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100/10 mg/kg), perfused intracardially with physiological phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and expanded cell clones were rapidly isolated and processed for further use. In addition, cells were also isolated from NOD.Scid mouse-expanded clones and re-cultured in DMEM as detailed above. Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the NIH guidelines, and reviewed and approved by the local committee on animal care and use (University of Zurich). Immunohistological detection of phospho-ERK1/2 was performed with phospho-ERK1/2-specific antibodies (phosphorylated at Thr202/Tyr204 of ERK1, and Thr185/Tyr187 of ERK2; E10 mouse mAb, Cell Signaling), and GRK2 was detected with GRK2-specific antibodies (raised in rabbit against full-length recombinant GRK2 protein) on cryosections of NOD.Scid mouse-expanded HEK and A431 clones, respectively, similarly as described (24Abd Alla J.

All sections/cells were imaged with a Leica DMI6000 microscope equipped with a DFC420 camera. Immunoblotting was used to determine the protein levels of GRK2, GRK2-K220R, ERK1 (MAPK3), ERK2 (MAPK1), and phospho-ERK1/2 in cells, NOD.Scid mouse-expanded clones and organ tissue from transgenic mice as described (24Abd Alla J.

Co-enrichment of Raf1 and GRK2 with RKIP was performed similarly as described (9Lorenz K. Lohse M.J. Quitterer U. Protein kinase C switches the Raf kinase inhibitor from Raf-1 to GRK-2.Nature. 2003; 426: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The GRK2-specific peptide inhibitor (GRK-Inh) was detected in the immunoblot after Tricine-SDS-PAGE with anti-GRK-Inh antibodies (affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbit against the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled GRK-Inh peptide). Nuclear phospho-ERK1/2 levels were quantified with the nuclear fraction of NOD.Scid mouse-expanded HEK and A431 clones, and organ tissue of transgenic and non-transgenic mice. The nuclear fraction was adjusted to a protein concentration of 0.2 μg/μl, solubilized by buffer (500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris pH 7.4) supplemented with protease/phosphatase inhibitors, and assayed for phospho-ERK1/2 by immunoblotting, or a sandwich ELISA according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Pierce). Nuclear samples were normalized to histone H2B. For subcellular fractionation, dispersed NOD.Scid mouse-expanded clones or mouse organ tissue were suspended in ice-cold buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, supplemented with protease/phosphatase inhibitors, and homogenized on ice with a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C (750 × g), the nuclear pellet was washed twice with ice-cold buffer, and stored as the nuclear fraction at −80 °C. The purity of the nuclear fraction was controlled by immunoblot detection of histone H2B and the absence of cytosolic proteins. To enrich proteins interacting with the GRK2-specific peptide inhibitor, GRK-Inh-expressing tumors were pulverized under liquid nitrogen. After solubilization for 30 min at 4 °C with solubilization buffer (1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4, supplemented with protease inhibitors), insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was diluted 1:5 in PBS (supplemented with protease inhibitors) and subjected to affinity chromatography with anti-GRK-Inh antibodies (6 mg of affinity-purified IgG/ml of Affi-Gel 10). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, unbound proteins were removed by extensive washing with PBS (20 column volumes), and bound proteins were eluted with 0.25 m NH4OH, 10% dioxane, pH 11. The pH was immediately adjusted to pH 7.4, eluted proteins were concentrated by acetone precipitation, dissolved by 8 m urea, and subjected to 8% urea-containing SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. After Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, the GRK2-reactive band was cut and subjected to nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS. Protein identification using nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS was performed by the Proteome Factory (Proteome Factory AG, Berlin, Germany). The MS system consisted of an Agilent 1100 nano-LC system (Agilent, Boeblingen, Germany), PicoTip emitter (New Objective, Woburn, MA), and an Esquire 3000 plus ion trap MS (Bruker, Bremen, Germany). The cut protein band was in-gel digested by trypsin (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) and applied to nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS. After trapping and desalting the peptides on an enrichment column (Zorbax SB C18, 0.3 × 5 mm, Agilent) using 1% acetonitrile, 0.5% formic acid solution for 5 min, peptides were separated on a Zorbax 300 SB C18, 75 μm × 150-mm column (Agilent) using an acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid gradient from 5 to 40% acetonitrile within 40 min. MS spectra were automatically taken by Esquire 3000 plus according to the manufacturer's instrument settings for nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS analyses. Proteins were identified using MS/MS ion search of the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, London, England) and nr protein database (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD). Ion charge in search parameters for ions from ESI-MS/MS data acquisition were set to “1+, 2+, or 3+” according to the common charge state distribution for the instrument and method. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed with a Vivid 7 echocardiograph system (GE Healthcare) and a 12 MHz linear array transducer similarly as described (27Abdalla S. Fu X. Elzahwy S.S.

Fully grown steady-state Chlamydomonas flagella release flagellar vesicles from their tips and failure to resupply membrane should affect flagellar length. To study vesicle release, plasma and flagellar membrane surface proteins were vectorially pulse-labeled and flagella and vesicles were analyzed for biotinylated proteins. Based on the quantity of biotinylated proteins in purified vesicles, steady-state flagella appeared to shed a minimum of 16% of their surface membrane per hour, equivalent to a complete flagellar membrane being released every 6 hrs or less. Brefeldin-A destroyed Chlamydomonas Golgi, inhibited the secretory pathway, inhibited flagellar regeneration, and induced full-length flagella to disassemble within 6 hrs, consistent with flagellar disassembly being induced by a failure to resupply membrane. In contrast to membrane lipids, a pool of biotinylatable membrane proteins was identified that was sufficient to resupply flagella as they released vesicles for 6 hrs in the absence of protein synthesis and to support one and nearly two regenerations of flagella following amputation. These studies reveal the importance of the secretory pathway to assemble and maintain full-length flagella."
https://openalex.org/W2032718477,"Cancer cell invasion is the critical first step of metastasis, yet, little is known about how cancer cells invade and initiate metastasis in a complex extracellular matrix. Using a cell line from bone metastasis of prostate cancer (PC3), we analyzed how prostate cancer cells migrate in a physiologically relevant 3D Matrigel. We found that PC3 cells migrated more efficiently as multi-cellular clusters than isolated single cells, suggesting that the presence of cell-cell adhesion improves 3D cell migration. Perturbation of N-cadherin function by transfection of either the N-cadherin cytoplasmic domain or shRNA specific to N-cadherin abolished collective cell migration. Interestingly, PC3 cells do not express α-catenin, an actin binding protein in the cadherin complex. When the full-length α-catenin was re-introduced, the phenotype of PC3 cells reverted back to a more epithelial phenotype with a decreased cell migration rate in 3D Matrigel. Interestingly, we found that the N-terminal half of α-catenin was sufficient to suppress invasive phenotype. Taken together, these data suggest that the formation of N-cadherin junctions promotes 3D cell migration of prostate cancer cells, and this is partly due to an aberrant regulation of the N-cadherin complex in the absence of α-catenin."
https://openalex.org/W2158237690,"Background Previous studies indicated that apolipoprotein measurements predicted cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk; however, associations between apolipoproteins and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) were less explored. Methodology and Principal Findings The cross-sectional study included 6069 participants aged 40 years or older with NGT from Shanghai, China. Serum fasting traditional lipids (total cholesterol [TC], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C] and triglycerides [TG]), apoA-I and apoB were assessed. A high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography was performed to measure CIMT. We found CIMT increased progressively across the quartiles of serum apoB (p for trend <0.0001). In logistic regression, concentrations of apoB (odds ratio [OR] 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18–1.36), TC (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.14–1.32), LDL-C (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.16–1.34) and TG (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04–1.20) were significantly related to elevated CIMT after adjusted for age and sex. Meanwhile, the apoB/apoA-I ratio (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.17–1.34) related to elevated CIMT. ApoB (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.00–1.51) and the apoB/apoA-I ratio (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.04–1.36) remained significantly associated with elevated CIMT, after adjusted for the traditional CVD risk factors including traditional lipids. Conclusions and Significance There were significant associations between serum apoB, the apoB/apoA-I ratio and elevated CIMT. Serum apoB and the apoB/apoA-I ratio might be independent predictors of early atherosclerosis in NGT."
https://openalex.org/W1966366489,"A premature stop codon in ACTN3 resulting in α-actinin-3 deficiency (the ACTN3 577XX genotype) is common in humans and reduces strength, muscle mass, and fast-twitch fiber diameter, but increases the metabolic efficiency of skeletal muscle. Linkage disequilibrium data suggest that the ACTN3 R577X allele has undergone positive selection during human evolution. The allele has been hypothesized to be adaptive in environments with scarce resources where efficient muscle metabolism would be selected. Here we test this hypothesis by using recently developed comparative methods that account for evolutionary relatedness and gene flow among populations. We find evidence that the ACTN3 577XX genotype evolved in association with the global latitudinal gradient. Our results suggest that environmental variables related to latitudinal variation, such as species richness and mean annual temperature, may have influenced the adaptive evolution of ACTN3 577XX during recent human history."
https://openalex.org/W2122341300,"In many renal diseases, transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-stimulated canonical Smad 3 and noncanonical mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) promote increased protein synthesis and mesangial cell hypertrophy. The cellular underpinnings involving these signaling molecules to regulate mesangial cell hypertrophy are not fully understood. Deptor has recently been identified as an mTOR interacting protein and functions as an endogenous inhibitor of the kinase activity for both TORC1 and TORC2. Prolonged incubation of mesangial cells with TGFβ reduced the levels of deptor concomitant with an increase in TORC1 and TORC2 activity. Sustained TGFβ activation was required to inhibit association of deptor with mTOR, whereas rapid activation had no effect. Using the mTOR inhibitor PP242, we found that TGFβ-induced both early and sustained activation of TORC1 and TORC2 was necessary for deptor suppression. PP242-induced reversal of deptor suppression by TGFβ was associated with a significant inhibition of TGFβ-stimulated protein synthesis and hypertrophy. Interestingly, expression of siRNA against Smad 3 or Smad 7, which blocks TGFβ receptor-specific Smad 3 signaling, prevented TGFβ-induced suppression of deptor abundance and TORC1/2 activities. Furthermore, overexpression of Smad 3 decreased deptor expression similar to TGFβ stimulation concomitant with increased TORC1 and TORC2 activities. Finally, knockdown of deptor reversed Smad 7-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis and mesangial cell hypertrophy induced by TGFβ. These data reveal the requirement of both early and late activation of mTOR for TGFβ-induced protein synthesis. Our results support that TGFβ-stimulated Smad 3 acts as a key node to instill a feedback loop between deptor down-regulation and TORC1/2 activation in driving mesangial cell hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2139088414,"Cellular retinol-binding protein, type I (CrbpI), encoded by retinol-binding protein, type 1 (Rbp1), is a chaperone of vitamin A (retinol) that is epigenetically silenced in ~25% of human breast cancers. CrbpI delivers vitamin A to enzymes for metabolism into an active metabolite, all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), where atRA is essential to cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and migration. Here, we show the effect of CrbpI loss on mammary atRA homeostasis using the Rbp1–/– mouse model. Rbp1–/– mouse mammary tissue has disrupted retinoid homeostasis that results in 40% depleted endogenous atRA. CrbpI loss and atRA depletion precede defects in atRA biosynthesis enzyme expression. Compensation by CrbpIII as a retinoid chaperone does not functionally replace CrbpI. Mammary subcellular fractions isolated from Rbp1–/– mice have altered retinol dehydrogenase/reductase (Rdh) enzyme activity that results in 24–42% less atRA production. Rbp1–/– mammary tissue has epithelial hyperplasia, stromal hypercellularity, increased collagen, and increased oxidative stress characteristic of atRA deficiency and early tissue dysfunction that precedes tumor formation. Consistent with the findings from the Rbp1–/– mouse, tumorigenic epithelial cells lacking CrbpI expression produce 51% less atRA. Together, these data show that CrbpI loss disrupts atRA homeostasis in mammary tissue, resulting in microenvironmental defects similar to those observed at the early stages of tumorigenesis.—Pierzchalski, K., Yu, J., Norman, V., Kane, M.

https://openalex.org/W2069110711,"Background Formaldehyde (FA) induces neurotoxicity by overproduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increasing studies have shown that hydrogen sulfide (H2S), an endogenous gastransmitter, protects nerve cells against oxidative stress by its antioxidant effect. It has been shown that overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) inhibits the activity of cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS), the predominant H2S-generating enzyme in the central nervous system. Objective We hypothesize that FA-caused neurotoxicity involves the deficiency of this endogenous protective antioxidant gas, which results from excessive generation of NO. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether FA disturbs H2S synthesis in PC12 cells, and whether this disturbance is associated with overproduction of NO. Principal Findings We showed that exposure of PC12 cells to FA causes reduction of viability, inhibition of CBS expression, decrease of endogenous H2S production, and NO production. CBS silencing deteriorates FA-induced decreases in endogenous H2S generation, neurotoxicity, and intracellular ROS accumulation in PC12 cells; while ADMA, a specific inhibitor of NOS significantly attenuates FA-induced decreases in endogenous H2S generation, neurotoxicity, and intracellular ROS accumulation in PC12 cells. Conclusion/Significance Our data indicate that FA induces neurotoxicity by inhibiting the generation of H2S through excess of NO and suggest that strategies to manipulate endogenous H2S could open a suitable novel therapeutic avenue for FA-induced neurotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1965499222,"Sensorimotor learning critically depends on error signals. Learning usually tries to minimise these error signals to guarantee optimal performance. Errors can, however, have both internal causes, resulting from one’s sensorimotor system, and external causes, resulting from external disturbances. Does learning take into account the perceived cause of error information? Here, we investigated the recalibration of internal predictions about the sensory consequences of one’s actions. Since these predictions underlie the distinction of self- and externally produced sensory events, we assumed them to be recalibrated only by prediction errors attributed to internal causes. When subjects were confronted with experimentally induced visual prediction errors about their pointing movements in virtual reality, they recalibrated the predicted visual consequences of their movements. Recalibration was not proportional to the externally generated prediction error, but correlated with the error component which subjects attributed to internal causes. We also revealed adaptation in subjects’ motor performance which reflected their recalibrated sensory predictions. Thus, causal attribution of error information is essential for sensorimotor learning."
https://openalex.org/W2025100323,"Holes within the internal elastic lamina (IEL) of blood vessels are sites of fenestration allowing for passage of diffusible vasoactive substances and interface of endothelial cell membrane projections with underlying vascular smooth muscle. Endothelial projections are sites of dynamic Ca(2+) events leading to endothelium dependent hyperpolarization (EDH)-mediated relaxations and the activity of these events increase as vessel diameter decreases. We tested the hypothesis that IEL fenestration is greater in distal vs. proximal arteries in skeletal muscle, and is unlike other vascular beds (mesentery). We also determined ion channel protein composition within the endothelium of intramuscular and non-intramuscular skeletal muscle arteries. Popliteal arteries, subsequent gastrocnemius feed arteries, and first and second order intramuscular arterioles from rat hindlimb were isolated, cut longitudinally, fixed, and imaged using confocal microscopy. Quantitative analysis revealed a significantly larger total fenestration area in second and first order arterioles vs. feed and popliteal arteries (58% and 16% vs. 5% and 3%; N = 10 images/artery), due to a noticeably greater average size of holes (9.5 and 3.9 µm(2) vs 1.5 and 1.9 µm(2)). Next, we investigated via immunolabeling procedures whether proteins involved in EDH often embedded in endothelial cell projections were disparate between arterial segments. Specific proteins involved in EDH, such as inositol trisphosphate receptors, small and intermediate conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels, and the canonical (C) transient receptor potential (TRP) channel TRPC3 were present in both popliteal and first order intramuscular arterioles. However due to larger IEL fenestration in first order arterioles, a larger spanning area of EDH proteins is observed proximal to the smooth muscle cell plasma membrane. These observations highlight the robust area of fenestration within intramuscular arterioles and indicate that the anatomical architecture and endothelial cell hyperpolarizing apparatus for distinct vasodilatory signaling is potentially present."
https://openalex.org/W1977718990,"In the austral summer of 2011 we undertook an investigation of three volcanic highs in the Central Bransfield Basin, Antarctica, in search of hydrothermal activity and associated fauna to assess changes since previous surveys and to evaluate the extent of hydrothermalism in this basin. At Hook Ridge, a submarine volcanic edifice at the eastern end of the basin, anomalies in water column redox potential (E(h)) were detected close to the seafloor, unaccompanied by temperature or turbidity anomalies, indicating low-temperature hydrothermal discharge. Seepage was manifested as shimmering water emanating from the sediment and from mineralised structures on the seafloor; recognisable vent endemic fauna were not observed. Pore fluids extracted from Hook Ridge sediment were depleted in chloride, sulfate and magnesium by up to 8% relative to seawater, enriched in lithium, boron and calcium, and had a distinct strontium isotope composition ((87)Sr/(86)Sr = 0.708776 at core base) compared with modern seawater ((87)Sr/(86)Sr ≈ 0.70918), indicating advection of hydrothermal fluid through sediment at this site. Biogeochemical zonation of redox active species implies significant moderation of the hydrothermal fluid with in situ diagenetic processes. At Middle Sister, the central ridge of the Three Sisters complex located about 100 km southwest of Hook Ridge, small water column E(h) anomalies were detected but visual observations of the seafloor and pore fluid profiles provided no evidence of active hydrothermal circulation. At The Axe, located about 50 km southwest of Three Sisters, no water column anomalies in E(h), temperature or turbidity were detected. These observations demonstrate that the temperature anomalies observed in previous surveys are episodic features, and suggest that hydrothermal circulation in the Bransfield Strait is ephemeral in nature and therefore may not support vent biota."

The acidic (acidic osteocalcin-derived peptide (OSC)) and amidic (amidic osteocalcin-derived peptide (OSN)) forms of this sequence were synthesized to investigate the effects of different C termini on the process of biomineralization.

In contrast, spherical amorphous calcium phosphate is formed in the presence of OSC. Circular dichroism experiments indicate conformational changes of amidic peptide to an open and regular structure as a consequence of interaction with calcium and phosphate. There is no conformational change detectable in OSC. It is concluded that HA crystal formation, which only occurred in OSN, is attributable to C-terminal amidation of a natural peptide derived from osteocalcin.

Methods Patients affected by PD diagnosed according to the United Kingdom Parkinson’s disease Society Brain Bank diagnostic criteria and a group of healthy controls were enrolled in the study. PD patients with cognitive impairment were excluded from the study. Structured Clinical Interview for Personality Disorders-II (SCID-II) has been performed to evaluate the presence of personality disorders. Presence of personality disorders, diagnosed according to the DSM-IV, was confirmed by a psychiatric interview. Clinical and pharmacological data were also recorded using a standardized questionnaire. Results 100 PD patients (57 men; mean age 59.0±10.2 years) and 100 healthy subjects (52 men; mean age 58.1±11.4 years) were enrolled in the study. The most common personality disorder was the obsessive-compulsive personality disorder diagnosed in 40 PD patients and in 10 controls subjects (p-value<0.0001) followed by the depressive personality disorder recorded in 14 PD patients and 4 control subjects (p-value 0.02). Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder was also found in 8 out of 16 de novo PD patients with a short disease duration.

https://openalex.org/W2124774083,"Bladder dysfunction characterized by abnormal bladder smooth muscle (BSM) contractions is pivotal to the disease process in overactive bladder, urge incontinence, and spinal cord injury. Purinergic signaling comprises one key pathway in modulating BSM contractility, but molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here we demonstrate, using myography, that activation of P2Y6 by either UDP or a specific agonist (MRS 2693) induced a sustained increase in BSM tone (up to 2 mN) in a concentration-dependent manner. Notably, activation of P2Y6 enhanced ATP-mediated BSM contractile force by up to 45%, indicating synergistic interactions between P2X and P2Y signaling. P2Y6-activated responses were abolished by phospholipase C (PLC) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptor antagonists U73122 and xestospongin C, demonstrating involvement of the PLC/IP3 signal pathway. Mice null for Entpd1, an ectonucleotidase on BSM, demonstrated increased force generation on P2Y6 activation (150%). Thus, in vivo perturbations to purinergic signaling resulted in altered P2Y6 activity and bladder contractility. We conclude that UDP, acting on P2Y6, regulates BSM tone and in doing so selectively maximizes P2X1-mediated contraction forces. This novel neurotransmitter pathway may play an important role in urinary voiding disorders characterized by abnormal bladder motility."

In the current study, a genome-wide eQTL analysis was performed in whole blood samples collected from 76 Japanese subjects. RNA microarray analysis was performed for 3 independent sample groups that were genotyped in a genome-wide scan. The correlations between the genotypes of 534,404 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the expression levels of 30,465 probes were examined for each sample group. The SNP-probe pairs with combined correlation coefficients of all 3 sample groups corresponding to P<3.1 × 10(-12) (i.e., Bonferroni-corrected P<0.05) were considered significant. SNP-probe pairs with a high likelihood of cross-hybridization and SNP-in-probe effects were excluded to avoid false positive results. We identified 102 cis-acting and 5 trans-acting eQTL regions. The cis-eQTL regions were widely distributed both upstream and downstream of the gene, as well as within the gene. The eQTL SNPs identified were examined for their influence on the expression levels in lymphoblastoid cell lines by using a public database. The results showed that genetic variants affecting expression levels in whole blood may have different effects on gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines. Further studies are required to clarify how SNPs function in affecting the expression levels in whole blood as well as in other tissues."

However, there are limited published data concerning the elderly. This study aims to investigate the use of adjuvant chemotherapy for gastric cancer after D2 gastrectomy among the elderly and identify its impact on survival.We retrospectively reviewed 360 patients who had undergone D2 gastrectomy, aged 65 years or older, with non-metastatic gastric cancer in a single institution. We analyzed the predictors and survival benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy use in the elderly. Further, we analyzed the survival benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy by dividing the patients into groups according to disease stages and chemotherapeutic regimens.Among the 360 patients, only 34.7% of patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. Age, tumor location, lymph node involvement and tumor invasion were associated with the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy improved the overall survival for non-metastatic elderly patients (HR 0.60, 95%CI 0.42-0.83, P = 0.003). Significant survival benefits were found with adjuvant chemotherapy in stage III patients (HR 0.67, 95%CI 0.47-0.97, P = 0.033), but not in stage I patients or in stage II patients (HR 0.52, 95%CI 0.21-1.30 P = 0.161). Compared to adjuvant chemotherapy without platinum, no significant survival benefits were observed with platinum-containing chemotherapy (HR 0.84, 95%CI 0.49-1.45, P = 0.530). Besides adjuvant chemotherapy, other independent prognostic factors of survival included tumor location, tumor size, histologic grade, depth of tumor invasion, and lymph node status.This study demonstrated the survival benefits of adjuvant fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy among the elderly patients with non-metastatic gastric cancer after D2 gastrectomy.

Genetic variations in the promoter region of BRM have been suggested to be associated with loss of BRM expression and lung cancer risk. To the authors' knowledge, no study on the role of BRM genetic polymorphisms in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk has been performed.In two independent case-control studies containing 796 HCC cases and 806 cancer-free individuals, we genotyped two putative functional insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms [BRM-1321 (rs3832613) and BRM-741 (rs34480940)] within promoter region of BRM in Chinese populations using a PCR-based method. Real-time RT-PCR analysis was used to explore the genotype-phenotype correlation between these polymorphisms and BRM expression in both tissue samples and HCC cell lines. Logistic regression analysis showed that compared to BRM-1321del/del genotype, the ins/del and ins/ins variant genotypes had an increased HCC risk [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.19-1.82; adjusted OR = 2.55, 95% CI = 1.75-3.72, respectively]. No significant association between BRM-741 and HCC incidence was observed. However, stratification analysis revealed a significant association between ins/ins genotype of BRM-741 and increased HCC susceptibility in smokers (adjusted OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.33-3.22). Quantitative PCR analyses demonstrated that the genotypes of BRM-1321 and the corresponding haplotypes were significantly correlated with BRM expression in vivo. Compared with ins/ins genotype, subjects carrying ins/del and del/del genotype had 2.30 and 4.99 fold higher BRM expression in HCC tissue samples, respectively. Similar trends were observed in western blot analysis at protein level.Our findings suggest that BRM promoter polymorphism (BRM-1321) could regulate BRM expression and may serve as a potential marker for genetic susceptibility to HCC."

Progesterone has neuroprotective effects, is known to reduce the clinical scores and the inflammatory response. Progesterone also promotes remyelination in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and cuprizone-induced demyelinating brain. However, it still remains unclear whether progesterone can alleviate neural behavioral deficits and demyelination with degeneration of oligodendroglial cells in cuprizone-induced mice. In this study, mice were fed with 0.2% cuprizone to induce demyelination, and treated with progesterone to test its potential protective effect on neural behavioral deficits, demyelination and degeneration of oligodendroglial cells. Our results showed noticeable alleviation of neural behavioral deficits following progesterone treatment as assessed by changes in average body weight, and activity during the open field and Rota-rod tests when compared with the vehicle treated cuprizone group. Progesterone treatment alleviated demyelination as shown by Luxol fast blue staining, MBP immunohistochemical staining, and electron microscopy. There was an obvious decrease in TUNEL and Caspase-3-positive apoptotic cells, and an increase in the number of oligodendroglial cells staining positive for PDGFRα, Olig2, Sox10 and CC-1 antibody in the brains of cuprizone-induced mice after progesterone administration.

We found that after adjusting for known risk factors in multivariate Cox regression models, AKR1C3 rs12529 and AR-CAG repeat length remained significantly associated with prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) after ADT (P ≤ 0.041). Furthermore, individuals carrying two unfavorable genotypes at these loci presented a 13.7-fold increased risk of PCSM compared with individuals carrying zero (P<0.001). Our results identify two candidate molecular markers in key genes of androgen and estrogen pathways associated with PCSM after ADT, establishing the role of pharmacogenomics in this therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1977195837,"Insect migration needs to be quantified if spatial and temporal patterns in populations are to be resolved. Yet so little ecology is understood above the flight boundary layer (i.e. >10 m) where in north-west Europe an estimated 3 billion insects km(-1) month(-1) comprising pests, beneficial insects and other species that contribute to biodiversity use the atmosphere to migrate. Consequently, we elucidate meteorological mechanisms principally related to wind speed and temperature that drive variation in daytime aerial density and insect displacements speeds with increasing altitude (150-1200 m above ground level). We derived average aerial densities and displacement speeds of 1.7 million insects in the daytime convective atmospheric boundary layer using vertical-looking entomological radars. We first studied patterns of insect aerial densities and displacements speeds over a decade and linked these with average temperatures and wind velocities from a numerical weather prediction model. Generalized linear mixed models showed that average insect densities decline with increasing wind speed and increase with increasing temperatures and that the relationship between displacement speed and density was negative. We then sought to derive how general these patterns were over space using a paired site approach in which the relationship between sites was examined using simple linear regression. Both average speeds and densities were predicted remotely from a site over 100 km away, although insect densities were much noisier due to local 'spiking'. By late morning and afternoon when insects are migrating in a well-developed convective atmosphere at high altitude, they become much more difficult to predict remotely than during the early morning and at lower altitudes. Overall, our findings suggest that predicting migrating insects at altitude at distances of ≈ 100 km is promising, but additional radars are needed to parameterise spatial covariance."
https://openalex.org/W2026983932,"Recent evidence indicates that CXCR2 signaling is crucial for cancer progression, and its antagonist SB225002 induces apoptosis in Wilms' tumor cells. Here, we investigated the effect of SB225002 on cell cycle progression and apoptosis induction in vitro, using CDDP-sensitive and -resistant OVCA cell lines with different p53 status (wild type, mutant or null). Adenovirus infection of wild-type p53 or transfection of p53 siRNA was used to over-express or knock-down p53. Cell cycle and apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry or Hoechst staining and observation of nuclear morphology. Our data demonstrated that SB225002 induced apoptosis in both wild-type and p53-deficient ovarian cancer (OVCA) cells through alternative mechanisms. SB225002 promoted mitotic catastrophe, as evidenced by the accumulation of mitotic cells with spindle abnormalities, chromosome mis-segregation, multi-polar cell division, multiple nuclei, aneuploidy/polyploidy and subsequent extensive apoptosis. SB225002-induced mitotic catastrophe appeared to be mediated by down-regulation of checkpoint kinase Chk1 and Cdk1-cyclin B activation. In cells expressing wild-type p53 (OV2008 and C13*), SB225002 increased total and phospho-Ser p53 levels, and p53 knock-down decreased SB225002-induced apoptosis, without affecting premature mitosis. These results suggest that SB225002 induces p53-dependent apoptosis, and provokes mitotic catastrophe in p53-independent manner in p53 wild-type cells. Reconstitution with wild-type P53 in P53-null SKOV3 cell attenuated SB225002-induced mitotic catastrophe, suggesting p53 prevented mitotic catastrophe induced by SB225002 in p53-deficient OVCA cells. Finally, the effect of SB225002 could not be prevented by pretreatment with CXCR2 ligand or its neutralizing antibody. The present studies demonstrate for the first time that SB225002 has dual actions in OVCA cells, inducing classic apoptosis through p53 activation and provoking mitotic catastrophe in both p53 wild-type and deficient cells by Chk1 inhibition and Cdk activation. These findings raise the possibility of SB225002 as a new candidate molecule for OVCA therapy independent of the p53 status."

Then we used the support vector machine (SVM), a type of MVPA classifier, to determine the patterns of functional connectivity. Our results showed that the brain functional networks derived from rsfMRI data (19 VaD patients and 20 controls) in these three frequency bands appear to reflect neurobiological changes in VaD patients. Such differences could be used to differentiate the brain states of VaD patients from those of healthy individuals. We also found that the functional connectivity patterns of the human brain in the three frequency bands differed, as did their ability to differentiate brain states. Specifically, the ability of the functional connectivity pattern to differentiate VaD brains from healthy ones was more efficient in the slow-5 (0.01∼0.027 Hz) band than in the other two frequency bands. Our findings suggest that the MVPA approach could be used to detect abnormalities in the functional connectivity of VaD patients in distinct frequency bands. Identifying such abnormalities may contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of VaD."

Interestingly, p73 produces two classes of proteins with opposing functions: the full-length TAp73 and the N-terminally truncated ΔNp73. In the current study, we sought to characterize the potential regulation of p73 by HDACs and found that histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) is a key regulator of TAp73 protein stability. Specifically, we showed that HDAC1 inhibition by HDAC inhibitors or by siRNA shortened the half-life of TAp73 protein and subsequently decreased TAp73 expression under normal and DNA damage-induced conditions. Mechanistically, we found that HDAC1 knockdown resulted in hyperacetylation and inactivation of heat shock protein 90, which disrupted the interaction between heat shock protein 90 and TAp73 and thus promoted the proteasomal degradation of TAp73. Functionally, we found that down-regulation of TAp73 was required for the enhanced cell migration mediated by HDAC1 knockdown. Together, we uncover a novel regulation of TAp73 protein stability by HDAC1-heat shock protein 90 chaperone complex, and our data suggest that TAp73 is a critical downstream mediator of HDAC1-regulated cell migration.

https://openalex.org/W2026135181,"We have engineered a transgenic mouse on a C57BL/6 background that bears a floxed Itga2 gene. The crossing of this mouse strain to transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase driven by the megakaryocyte (MK)-specific Pf4 promoter permits the conditional knockout of Itga2 in the MK/platelet lineage. Mice lacking MK α2β1 develop normally, are fertile, and like their systemic α2β1 knockout counterparts, exhibit defective adhesion to and aggregation induced by soluble type I collagen and a delayed onset to low dose fibrillar collagen-induced aggregation, results consistent with blockade or loss of platelet α2β1. At the same time, we observed a significant reduction in mean platelet volume, which is consistent with the reported role of α2β1 in MK maturation and proplatelet formation in vivo. This transgenic mouse strain bearing a floxed Itga2 gene will prove valuable to distinguish in vivo the temporal and spatial contributions of α2 integrin in selected cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2052337079,"Antimicrobial resistance, particularly in pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), limits treatment options and increases healthcare costs. To understand patient risk factors, including household and animal contact, potentially associated with colonization with multidrug-resistant MRSA isolates, we performed a prospective study of case patients colonized with MRSA on admission to a rural tertiary care hospital. Patients were interviewed and antimicrobial resistance patterns were tested among isolates from admitted patients colonized with MRSA in 2009–10. Prevalence of resistance was compared by case-patient risk factors and length-of-stay outcome among 88 MRSA case patients. Results were compared to NHANES 2003–04. Overall prevalence of multidrug resistance (non-susceptibility to ≥four antimicrobial classes) in MRSA nasal isolates was high (73%) and was associated with a 1.5-day increase in subsequent length of stay (p = 0.008). History of hospitalization within the past six months, but not antimicrobial use in the same time period, was associated with resistance patterns. Within a subset of working-age case patients without recent history of hospitalization, animal contact was potentially associated with multidrug resistance. History of hospitalization, older age, and small household size were associated with multidrug resistance in NHANES data. In conclusion, recent hospitalization of case patients was predictive of antimicrobial resistance in MRSA isolates, but novel risk factors associated with the household may be emerging in CA-MRSA case patients. Understanding drivers of antimicrobial resistance in MRSA isolates is important to hospital infection control efforts, relevant to patient outcomes and to indicators of the economic burden of antimicrobial resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1968644430,"We developed an approach for analysing the effects of two crossed factors A and B on the functional, taxonomic or phylogenetic composition of communities. The methodology, known as crossed-DPCoA, defines a space where species, communities and the levels of the two factors are organised as a set of points. In this space, the Euclidean distance between two species-specific points is a measure of the (functional, taxonomic or phylogenetic) dissimilarity. The communities are positioned at the centroid of their constitutive species; and the levels of two factors at the centroid of the communities associated with them. We develop two versions for crossed-DPCoA, the first one moves the levels of factor B to the centre of the space and analyses the axes of highest variance in the coordinates of the levels of factor A. It is related to previous ordination approaches such as partial canonical correspondence analysis and partial non-symmetrical correspondence analysis. The second version projects all points on the orthogonal complement of the space generated by the principal axes of factor B. This second version should be preferred when there is an a priori suspicion that factor A and B are associated. We apply the two versions of crossed-DPCoA to analyse the phylogenetic composition of Central European and Mediterranean bird communities. Applying crossed-DPCoA on bird communities supports the hypothesis that allopatric speciation processes during the Quaternary occurred in open and patchily distributed landscapes, while the lack of geographic barriers to dispersal among forest habitats may explain the homogeneity of forest bird communities over the whole western Palaearctic. Generalizing several ordination analyses commonly used in ecology, crossed-DPCoA provides an approach for analysing the effects of crossed factors on functional, taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity, environmental and geographic structure of species niches, and more broadly the role of genetics on population structures."

This substrate population includes over 80 different competing ptRNAs in Escherichia coli. Although the reaction kinetics and molecular recognition of a few individual model substrates of bacterial RNase P have been well described, the competitive substrate kinetics of the enzyme are comparatively unexplored. To understand the factors that determine how different ptRNA substrates compete for processing by E. coli RNase P, we compared the steady state reaction kinetics of two ptRNAs that differ at sequences that are contacted by the enzyme. For both ptRNAs, substrate cleavage is fast relative to dissociation. As a consequence, V/K, the rate constant for the reaction at limiting substrate concentrations, reflects the substrate association step for both ptRNAs. Reactions containing two or more ptRNAs follow simple competitive alternative substrate kinetics in which the relative rates of processing are determined by ptRNA concentration and their V/K. The relative V/K values for eight different ptRNAs, which were selected to represent the range of structure variation at sites contacted by RNase P, were determined by internal competition in reactions in which all eight substrates were present simultaneously.

Although P RNA is a ribozyme, its mode of molecular recognition differs from other catalytic RNAs in two important ways. First, its biological role in ptRNA processing requires that it act in trans as a multiple turnover enzyme (14Harris M.E. Yandek L.E.

Second, RNase P processes multiple RNA substrates, including all ptRNAs in the cell, whereas other ribozymes, again with the exceptions of the ribosome and spliceosome, have one specific substrate (18Hartmann R.K.

The recognition elements near the cleavage site include the 3′-RCCA sequence, a G(+1)/C(+72), as the first base pair in the acceptor stem and the 2′-OH and nucleobase of a U(−1) residue 5′ to the cleavage site.

Only two-thirds of E. coli ptRNAs (66/87) contain a G(+1)/C(+72), and a similar fraction (63/87) have an optimal U at the N(−1) position (19Chan P.P. Lowe T.M. GtRNAdb: a database of transfer RNA genes detected in genomic sequence.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D93-D97Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The population of ptRNAs that contain all of the recognition elements is significantly smaller (∼50%; 42/87). These ptRNAs make up a canonical sequence, whereas a noncanonical ptRNA is missing one or more of these recognition elements. The adjacent base pair to these recognition elements is often a G(+2)/C(+71); however, this position is not known to contact RNase P. The 5′ leader sequence shows no conserved motif; however, both binding and cleavage of model substrates by E. coli RNase P are sensitive to changes in the sequence of the 5′ leader (36Sun L.

Thus, detailed in vitro structure-function studies measuring binding and catalysis for model substrates have revealed basic principles of molecular recognition by RNase P. Nonetheless, information on the competition between different alternative substrates is needed to understand function in vivo. Here, we test a simple competitive model to describe the relative rates of ptRNA processing by RNase P and apply this model to evaluate the effect of natural, genomic variation in ptRNA substrate structure on relative processing rates. The results provide insight into the features of the kinetic mechanism of RNase P that govern its function in vivo that are relevant for other multiple substrate enzymes. E. coli P RNA and ptRNAs were generated by in vitro transcription from cloned DNA or PCR DNA templates.

Evidence that substrate-specific effects of C5 protein lead to uniformity in binding and catalysis by RNase P.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3998-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The ptRNAHis37, ptRNAGln85, ptRNAGly62, ptRNASer80, ptRNALeu76, and ptRNAIle1 substrates were synthesized from PCR products generated from E. coli genomic DNA using primers that introduce a T7 promoter and nine nucleotides of 5′ leader sequence to generate the RNA sequences shown in Fig. 2: ptRNAGln85, forward, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGCCGGTTATTGGGGTATCGCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGGCTGGGGTACCTGGATTCG-3′; ptRNAGly62, forward, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGATCTCGAAGCGGGCGTAGTTC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGGAGCGGGCGAAGGGAATCG-3′; ptRNASer80, forward, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTCATTCCGGAAGTGTGGCCG-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGGCGGAAGCGCAGAGATTCG-3′; ptRNAIle1, forward, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGACCTCTACAGGCTTGTAGCTC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGGTAGGCCTGAGTGGACTTG-3′. PCR reactions contained 100 mm KCl, Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm dNTP and were performed at 95 °C, 30 s, 60 °C, 60 s, and 72 °C, 90 s for 30 cycles. The resulting DNA was purified by phenol and chloroform extraction and precipitated with ethanol as described previously (40Zahler N.H. Sun L. Christian E.L. Harris M.E. The pre-tRNA nucleotide base and 2′-hydroxyl at N(−1) contribute to fidelity in tRNA processing by RNase P.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 969-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription reactions contained ∼10 μg of plasmid or PCR template, 5 mm each NTP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 17.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 2 mm spermidine, and 1 unit/μl of T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion) and were incubated overnight at 37 °C. The resulting RNA products were recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The full-length transcription products were purified by PAGE as described (40Zahler N.H. Sun L. Christian E.L. Harris M.E. The pre-tRNA nucleotide base and 2′-hydroxyl at N(−1) contribute to fidelity in tRNA processing by RNase P.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 969-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The ptRNA substrates were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase after dephosphorylation by alkaline phosphatase. RNase P holoenzyme reaction kinetics were measured under the following conditions: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 17.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.005% Triton X-100. The P RNA and 5′-32P-end-labeled ptRNA were renatured separately in the above buffer (omitting the Mg2+) by incubation at 95 °C for 4 min followed immediately by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. MgCl2 was added to a concentration of 17.5 mm, and the incubation was continued for an additional 10 min. C5 protein was purified, and activity was tested by titrations into multiple turnover reactions containing a constant concentration of P RNA as described previously (43Guo X. Campbell F.E. Sun L. Christian E.L. Anderson V.E. Harris M.E. RNA-dependent folding and stabilization of C5 protein during assembly of the E. coli RNase P holoenzyme.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 190-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). C5 protein was added to a concentration equal to that of P RNA, and the 37 °C incubation was continued for an additional 10 min. Reactions were initiated by mixing equal volumes of enzyme and substrate. Aliquots were removed at specific time intervals and quenched with 50 mm EDTA. The residual ptRNA substrate and 5′ leader cleavage product were resolved by denaturing PAGE (15%). The conversion of substrate to product was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis using a GE Healthcare Storm system and ImageQuant software. The fraction of reaction was determined as F = [ptRNA]/([ptRNA] + [leader]) where [ptRNA] and [leader] are the intensity of the ptRNA and leader bands, respectively. Data analysis and fitting were performed using Microsoft Excel and Origin 8.0 (OriginLab). For multiple turnover reactions, initial rates were measured and plotted versus ptRNA concentration and fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation as described under “Results.” Transient kinetic experiments were performed in a similar manner, with the substrate and enzyme concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Single turnover kinetic analyses were performed as described previously (44Siew D. Zahler N.H. Cassano A.G. Strobel S.A. Harris M.E. Identification of adenosine functional groups involved in substrate binding by the ribonuclease P ribozyme.Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1873-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) using the following reaction conditions: 50 mm MES, pH 6, 100 mm NaCl, 17.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.005% Triton X-100. F was plotted versus time and fit to a single exponential function, F=Fo-Ae-kt(Eq. 1) where Fo is the maximal fraction of reacted substrate. Experiments were measured using the single turnover conditions described above at pH 6 with either 1 nm ptRNAfMet47 or 1 nm ptRNAMet82 and 100 nm RNase P. At 30 s after initiating, the reaction the volume was divided in half. One aliquot was added to a tube containing a substrate quench giving a final concentration of 5 μm B. subtilis ptRNAAsp. Both reactions were continued, and the kinetic data for both pre-chase and post-chase were fit to Equation 1 (45Rose I.A. O'Connell E.L. Litwin S.

To detect the formation of products from two substrates independently in the same reaction, ptRNAfMet47 and ptRNAMet82 were modified by the addition of two extra G nucleotides to the 5′ end of the leader sequence, giving rise to ptRNAfMet47(+2) and ptRNAMet82(+2). The two additional residues allow their products to be separated on 15% PAGE and quantified independently from the products of the other ptRNAs used in this study. Internal competition reactions contained two, three, or eight ptRNAs as indicated in the text and in the legends for FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8, FIGURE 9. Reactions containing both ptRNAfMet47 and ptRNAMet82 at a range of concentrations from 10 to 100 nm were performed with one or the other substrates containing the two extra G residues in the 5′ leader. Additional reactions containing ptRNAfMet47 and ptRNAMet82(+2) at 100 nm in the presence of increasing concentrations of nonradiolabeled ptRNALeu76 from 10 to 3000 nm were also analyzed by monitoring the formation of the 5′ end-labeled ptRNAfMet47 and ptRNAMet82(+2). Similarly, reactions containing all eight of the substrates shown in Fig. 2 were conducted with each ptRNA present at 100 nm (800 nm total). For these reactions, trace concentrations of radiolabeled reference substrate ptRNAMet82(+2) and one of the remaining seven substrates were included to follow product formation. Relative rate constants (rk = (V/K)/(V/K)reference; see below) were determined using analytical methods based on Equation 2 and Scheme 1, as described in the following sections.FIGURE 6Competitive multiple turnover reactions containing both ptRNAfMet47 and ptRNAMet82(+2).

In squid mitochondria, four codons deviate from the universal genetic code, namely AUA, UGA, and AGA/AGG (AGR) for Met, Trp, and Ser, respectively. To understand the molecular basis for establishing the non-universal genetic code, we isolated and analyzed five mitochondrial tRNAs from a squid, Loligo bleekeri. Primary structures of the isolated tRNAs, including their post-transcriptional modifications, were analyzed by mass spectrometry. tRNAMet(AUR) possessed an unmodified cytidine at the first position of the anticodon, suggesting that the AUA codon is deciphered by CAU anticodon via non-canonical A-C pairing. We identified 5-taurinomethyluridine (τm5U) at the first position of the anticodon in tRNATrp(UGR). τm5U enables tRNATrp to decipher UGR codons as Trp. In addition, 5-taurinomethyl-2-thiouridine (τm5s2U) was found in mitochondrial tRNAs for Leu(UUR) and Lys in L. bleekeri. This is the first discovery of τm5U and τm5s2U in molluscan mitochondrial tRNAs. Non-universal genetic codes are frequently found in animal mitochondrial decoding systems.

In animal mitochondria, six codons deviate from the universal genetic code (1Watanabe K.

The AAA codon (for Lys) changes to assign Asn in echinoderm and some platyhelminth mitochondria. The AGA and AGG (AGR) codons (for Arg) are used for Ser in most invertebrate mitochondria, for Gly in tunicate mitochondria, and as a stop codon in vertebrate mitochondria. The UGA stop codon is used for Trp in all animal mitochondria, and the UAA stop codon is used for Tyr in nematode mitochondria.

In addition, we discovered 5-taurinomethyluridine (τm5U) and its 2-thio derivative (τm5s2U) at the wobble position of human and bovine mt tRNAs responsible for NNR codons (7Suzuki T. Suzuki T.

Because an unmodified U at the wobble position enables tRNAs to decode any of the four codons in family boxes according to the mitochondrial four-way wobble rule (1Watanabe K.

Springer Verlag, Berlin2005: 23-69Google Scholar), the wobble U in tRNAs responsible for NNR codons must be modified. In fact, τm5U is used to assign the UGA codon to Trp in mammals and vertebrates (2Watanabe K. Yokobori S. tRNA modification and genetic code variations in animal mitochondria.J.

Four non-universal genetic codes exist in the mitochondrial decoding system of the squid Loligo bleekeri, namely, AUA, UGA, and AGA/AGG (AGR) for Met, Trp, and Ser, respectively (Table 1) (11Shimayama T. Himeno H. Sasuga J. Yokobori S. Ueda T. Watanabe K. The genetic code of a squid mitochondrial gene.Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1990; 22: 73-74Google Scholar). We previously attempted to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism that deciphers these non-universal codons by isolating and analyzing mt tRNAs from L. bleekeri. A gene encoding a tRNASer containing a GCT anticodon is encoded in the mtDNA of L. bleekeri. To decode the non-universal AGR codons in addition to the universal AGY codons as Ser, the GCU anticodon of this tRNA must be modified post-transcriptionally. Indeed, we identified 7-methylguanosine (m7G) at the wobble position of the mt tRNASer isolated from L. bleekeri liver (12Tomita K. Ueda T. Watanabe K. 7-Methylguanosine at the anticodon wobble position of squid mitochondrial tRNA(Ser)GCU: molecular basis for assignment of AGA/AGG codons as serine in invertebrate mitochondria.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1399: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), indicating that all four AGN codons are deciphered by the single tRNASer bearing the m7GCU anticodon. The unique four-way wobbling mediated by m7G was originally detected in the starfish mitochondrial decoding system (13Matsuyama S. Ueda T. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Watanabe K. A novel wobble rule found in starfish mitochondria: presence of 7-methylguanosine at the anticodon wobble position expands decoding capability of tRNA.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3363-3368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the case of the AUA codon, our group used a postlabeling method to identify a partial f5C modification at the wobble position of squid mt tRNAMet (14Tomita K. Ueda T. Watanabe K. 5-formyl-cytidine (f5C) found in the wobble position of the anticodon of squid mitochondrial tRNAMet(CAU).Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1997; 37: 197-198Google Scholar), implying that the AUA codon is deciphered by the f5CAU anticodon, as observed in mammals, nematode, and insect. However, evidence for this modification relied upon the detection of weak spot with a high background on a two-dimensional thin-layer chromatogram (two-dimensional TLC). To define conclusively the mechanism for deciphering the AUA codon, the frequency of the f5C modification needs to be reliably estimated. There have been few studies over the past decade on squid mitochondrial decoding systems because of technical limitations in the isolation and analysis of mt tRNAs. By using the efficient RNA isolation technique based on the reciprocal circulating chromatography (15Miyauchi K. Ohara T. Suzuki T. Automated parallel isolation of multiple species of non-coding RNAs by the reciprocal circulating chromatography method.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: e24Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and highly sensitive mass spectrometric methods for analyzing RNA molecules (16Suzuki T. Ikeuchi Y. Noma A. Suzuki T. Sakaguchi Y. Mass spectrometric identification and characterization of RNA-modifying enzymes.Methods Enzymol. 2007; 425: 211-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we successfully analyzed the post-transcriptional modifications of L. bleekeri mt tRNAs that are responsible for the non-universal genetic codes. Moreover, we discuss our results in the wider context of the evolutionary reorganization of decoding systems in animal mitochondria.TABLE 1Codon table of the squid mitochondrial genetic code The procedure for isolation of mt tRNAs from edible muscle of L. bleekeri was largely the same as that used for ascidian mt tRNAs reported previously (10Suzuki T. Miyauchi K. Suzuki T. Yokobori S. Shigi N. Kondow A. Takeuchi N. Yamagishi A. Watanabe K.

After separation by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography, 2400 A260 units of the crude tRNA fraction were isolated from 280 g of squid muscle. Total tRNA (700 A260 units) was obtained from 1200 A260 units of the crude tRNA fraction by removing contaminating polysaccharides with TRIzol-LS (Invitrogen) followed by rinsing with chloroform. For the isolation of individual mt tRNAs, the following 5′-EC amino-modified DNA probes (Sigma-Aldrich) were designed using Raccess software (17Kiryu H. Terai G. Imamura O. Yoneyama H. Suzuki K. Asai K. A detailed investigation of accessibilities around target sites of siRNAs and miRNAs.Bioinformatics. 2011; 27: 1788-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and used for reciprocal circulating chromatography (RCC) (15Miyauchi K.

The tDNA sequences were obtained from the NCBI database of L. bleekeri mtDNA (accession number NC_002507) (18Sasuga J. Yokobori S. Kaifu M. Ueda T. Nishikawa K. Watanabe K.

The DNA probes were covalently immobilized on NHS-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) and packed into respective tip columns for the RCC instrument. The five tRNA species were simultaneously isolated from 700 A260 units of total tRNA by RCC as described (15Miyauchi K. Ohara T. Suzuki T. Automated parallel isolation of multiple species of non-coding RNAs by the reciprocal circulating chromatography method.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: e24Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Each purified tRNA was digested with RNase T1 and then analyzed by capillary liquid chromatography (LC)/nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry (MS) as described (16Suzuki T. Ikeuchi Y. Noma A. Suzuki T. Sakaguchi Y. Mass spectrometric identification and characterization of RNA-modifying enzymes.Methods Enzymol. 2007; 425: 211-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A linear ion trap-orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap XL; Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a custom-made nanospray ion source and a splitless nanoHPLC system (DiNa; KYA Technologies) was employed in this study. Modified bases were assigned by comparing observed m/z values of RNase T1-digested fragments to the calculated values of these fragments. The bases were allocated on the basis of the sequences of the fragments, which were inferred from the collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectra and assisted by referring to evolutionary conservation of each modified base in tRNAs. N2-methylguanosine (m2G) can be distinguished from 1-methylguanosine (m1G) by examining the 3′-terminal structure generated by RNase T1. When RNase T1 cleaves tRNA on the 3′ side of m2G, a 3′-phosphate is produced. On the other hand, when the 3′ side of m1G is cleaved by RNase T1, a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate (>p) is primarily generated. Mono- or dinucleotide fragments passed through the LC and were not detected. The percent frequencies of modifications were calculated from the ratios of the mass chromatogram peak heights of RNA fragments containing modified bases to those of RNA fragments lacking modified bases. Nucleoside analysis of tRNAs was performed as described (16Suzuki T. Ikeuchi Y. Noma A. Suzuki T. Sakaguchi Y. Mass spectrometric identification and characterization of RNA-modifying enzymes.Methods Enzymol. 2007; 425: 211-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 20Ikeuchi Y. Shigi N. Kato J.

Cell. 2006; 21: 97-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Purified tRNAMet(AUR) and yeast phenylalanine tRNA (Roche Applied Science) were digested into nucleosides using nuclease P1 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) and bacterial alkaline phosphatase (BAP.C75; Takara) for 3 h at 37 °C. The digests were then analyzed by a linear ion trap-orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap XL). Five species of squid mt tRNAs were isolated from 700 A260 units of total tRNA by RCC, namely, tRNAMet(AUR), tRNATrp(UGR), tRNASer(AGN), tRNALeu(UUR), and tRNALys(AAR). Each individual tRNA was faintly detectable on the polyacrylamide gel of the total eluted fraction from the RCC column (Fig. 1). Each band was excised, and tRNA was eluted from the gel pieces for mass spectrometric analysis. Although the final yield of each tRNA could not be precisely measured, we estimated the yield to be within the range of 10–300 fmol. Isolated tRNAs were digested by RNase T1 and subjected to capillary LC/nanoelectrospray ionization MS to analyze the chemical structures of the modifications. RNA fragments from each tRNA were efficiently separated by capillary LC on the basis of their lengths, base compositions, and sequences (Fig. 2A). Singly and multiply charged anions of RNA fragments were detected with high mass resolution (30,000 units). Modified bases in the fragments were identified on the basis of the precise molecular mass of each RNA fragment, which was calculated by deconvoluting the observed m/z values from the mass spectra (s u p p l e m e n t a l T a b l e 1). Each fragment was further analyzed by an MS/MS experiment using CID to determine the positions of detected modifications within the tRNA sequence (Fig. 2B). The modifications were unambiguously positioned in the sequence by the assignment of y- and c-series product ions (21Mcluckey S.A. Vanberkel G.J. Glish G.L. Tandem mass spectrometry of small, multiply charged oligonucleotides.J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectr. 1992; 3: 60-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). In mt tRNAMet(AUR), we clearly detected the anticodon-containing fragment (ΨUCAUt6ACCCCAAAAAm5UGp) bearing N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A) and 5-methyluridine (m5U) at positions 37 and 48, respectively (Fig. 2). Although f5C has been reported to be partially introduced at the wobble position (14Tomita K. Ueda T. Watanabe K. 5-formyl-cytidine (f5C) found in the wobble position of the anticodon of squid mitochondrial tRNAMet(CAU).Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1997; 37: 197-198Google Scholar), we could not detect f5C at this position (supplemental Fig. 1). This result suggested that the AUA codon is deciphered as Met by the CAU anticodon via non-canonical A-C pairing. We confirmed the presence of 1-methyladenosine (m1A) at position 9, N2-methylguanosine (m2G) at position 11, and N2,N 2-dimethylguanosine (m22G) at position 26 (Fig. 3A and supplemental Table 1). In addition, we newly found a methylated U at position 48 (Fig. 2B), which we determined to be m5U by co-injection analysis with authentic m5U in total nucleosides of yeast tRNAPhe (supplemental Fig. 2). In mt tRNATrp(UGR), we detected the anticodon-containing fragment CUUτm5UCAms2i6Am1G>p, which bears τm5U at the wobble position, 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyladenosine (ms2i6A) at position 37, and m1G at position 38 (Fig. 2). This is the first instance of the detection of τm5U in molluscan mt tRNA. The relative frequency of τm5U was calculated on the basis of the signal intensity ratio of the modified and unmodified RNA fragments. The wobble base was modified to τm5U in 89% of mt tRNATrp(UGR), indicating that UGR codons are mainly deciphered by τm5UCA anticodons (Fig. 3A), whereas the residual 11% had unmodified U at the wobble position. The hypomodified tRNAs are likely to be the result of their in vivo status rather than different hybridization efficiency with the DNA probes because the length of probes used in this study are long enough to trap all tRNAs with different modification status. In addition, m1A and m22G were found at positions 9 and 26, respectively (Fig. 3A and supplemental Table 1). Moreover, we detected monomethylated uridines (U+me) with unidentified structures at positions 12 and 13 (Fig. 3A and supplemental Table 1). L. bleekeri mt tRNASer(AGN) contains m7G at the wobble position and t6A at position 37 (12Tomita K. Ueda T. Watanabe K. 7-Methylguanosine at the anticodon wobble position of squid mitochondrial tRNA(Ser)GCU: molecular basis for assignment of AGA/AGG codons as serine in invertebrate mitochondria.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1399: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The presence of both modifications was confirmed using MS analysis (Figs. 2A and 3A, and supplemental Table 1). m7G is distinguishable from the other methylguanosines because RNase T1 does not cleave the 3′ end of m7G. In addition, because the N-glycosyl bond of m7G is unstable, the m7G base dissociates easily from the RNA fragment upon CID, generating product ions lacking m7G base (Fig. 2B). The mass chromatogram showed that the wobble base was completely modified to m7G (Fig. 3A). Having detected τm5U in mt tRNATrp(UGR), we further analyzed mt tRNALeu(UUR) and mt tRNALys(AAR) to identify additional instances of τm5U and its derivative in squid mt tRNAs. As expected, the wobble bases of both tRNAs were modified to τm5s2U (Fig. 2). The mass chromatograms of the anticodon-containing fragments with different modification statuses (Fig. 3B) showed that 88% of mt tRNALeu(UUR) and 90% of mt tRNALys(AAR) contained τm5s2U, whereas only 7% of both tRNAs contained τm5U. The remaining molecules had a 2-thiouridine or an unmodified U at the wobble position. Other modifications were found in mt tRNALeu(UUR) at positions 6 and 10 (m2G) and at positions 9 and 37 (m1G) (Fig. 3B) and in mt tRNALys(AAR) at position 9 (m1G), position 10 (m2G), and position 37 (t6A) (Fig. 3B). Monomethylated uridines (U+me) with unidentified structures were also found at positions 16, 48, and 52 (Fig. 3B and supplemental Table 1). U+me at position 48 was presumed to be m5U as observed in mt tRNAMet(AUR). We have shown here that L. bleekeri mt tRNAMet(AUR) possesses an unmodified C at the wobble position (Fig. 3A). Our group previously reported that the wobble position was partially modified to f5C in the same tRNA (14Tomita K. Ueda T. Watanabe K. 5-formyl-cytidine (f5C) found in the wobble position of the anticodon of squid mitochondrial tRNAMet(CAU).Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1997; 37: 197-198Google Scholar). In the study, a weak f5C spot along with a strong C spot was detected on the two-dimensional TLC by the postlabeling method, suggesting a false positive. Otherwise, we might use a different strain of L. bleekeri for this study. There might be some individual differences of squid variably expressing a putative tRNA-modifying enzyme for f5C formation. Judging from the sensitivity of our MS analysis, if there is only 1% of f5C in the anticodon-containing fragment, we can surely detect it. Thus, if a partial f5C modification does exist, its frequency must be <1%. In any case, we demonstrated here that a large majority of mt tRNAMet(AUR) is occupied by unmodified C at the wobble position, indicating that AUA codon is deciphered by CAU anticodon via non-canonical A-C pairing in L. bleekeri mitochondria. This may be a remnant of a primitive decoding system 0that has been used early in evolution, because the domain-specific wobble modifications might have been acquired late during evolution, as suggested by the phylogenetic study on tRNA-modifying enzymes (22Grosjean H. de Crécy-Lagard V. Marck C. Deciphering synonymous codons in the three domains of life: co-evolution with specific tRNA modification enzymes.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 252-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Some instances of the AUA decoding by a CAU anticodon have been reported in other mitochondrial systems. In D. melanogaster (6Tomita K. Ueda T. Ishiwa S. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Watanabe K. Codon reading patterns in Drosophila melanogaster mitochondria based on their tRNA sequences: a unique wobble rule in animal mitochondria.Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4291-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), there are two species of mt tRNAsMet; one has a CAU anticodon with t6A at position 37, the other has an f5CAU anticodon with an unmodified A at position 37. This indicates that the AUA codon can be read by a CAU anticodon with the assistance of t6A37 because t6A37 stabilizes tRNA binding to the A site codon (23Miyauchi K. Kimura S. Suzuki T. A cyclic form of N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine as a widely distributed tRNA hypermodification.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 9: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 24Yarian C. Townsend H. Czestkowski W. Sochacka E. Malkiewicz A.J. Guenther R. Miskiewicz A. Agris P.F. Accurate translation of the genetic code depends on tRNA modified nucleosides.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16391-16395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), or by f5CAU without the assistance of t6A37. In this study, we detected t6A37 in mt tRNAMet(AUR) (Fig. 3A). The frequency of the t6A modification in mt tRNAMet(AUR) was estimated to be 93% according to the MS data (Fig. 3A). The high modification efficiency indicates the importance of t6A37 for the decoding of AUA as Met in L. bleekeri mitochondria. In addition to the anticodon and 3′-adjacent modifications, decoding efficiency can be affected by other regions in tRNAs (25Hirsh D. Tryptophan RNA of Escherichia coli.Nature. 1970; 228: 57Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26Schmeing T.M. Voorhees R.M. Kelley A.C. Ramakrishnan V. How mutations in tRNA distant from the anticodon affect the fidelity of decoding.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the case of Hirsh suppressor tRNATrp with G24A and A9C mutations, UGA codon is efficiently deciphered by the CCA anticodon, in which C34 of anticodon pairs with A3 of codon by a non-standard geometry with a single hydrogen bond between N4 imino group of C34 and N1 of A3 (26Schmeing T.M. Voorhees R.M. Kelley A.C. Ramakrishnan V. How mutations in tRNA distant from the anticodon affect the fidelity of decoding.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These suppressor mutations are considered to enable C34-A3 pairing by facilitating the distortion of tRNA body at A/T state during decoding (26Schmeing T.M. Voorhees R.M. Kelley A.C. Ramakrishnan V. How mutations in tRNA distant from the anticodon affect the fidelity of decoding.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, there might be some elements in mt tRNAMet(AUR) that enable CAU anticodon to recognize AUA codon efficiently. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae (27Canaday J. Dirheimer G. Martin R.P. Yeast mitochondrial methionine initiator tRNA: characterization and nucleotide sequence.Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Sibler A.P. Dirheimer G. Martin R.P. Yeast mitochondrial tRNAIle and tRNAMetm: nucleotide sequence and codon recognition patterns.Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1341-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and mosquito (Aedes albopictus) (29Dubin D.T. HsuChen C.C. Sequence and structure of a methionine transfer RNA from mosquito mitochondria.Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 4185-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), mt tRNAsMet are known to have an unmodified CAU anticodon. In S. cerevisiae, the initiator and elongator mt tRNAsMet have CAU anticodons with m1G37 and t6A37, respectively (27Canaday J. Dirheimer G. Martin R.P. Yeast mitochondrial methionine initiator tRNA: characterization and nucleotide sequence.Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Sibler A.P. Dirheimer G. Martin R.P. Yeast mitochondrial tRNAIle and tRNAMetm: nucleotide sequence and codon recognition patterns.Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1341-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Collectively, the AUA decoding by a CAU anticodon with the assistance of the modified bases at position 37 might be a general rule. In animal mitochondria, three strategies are used to decipher AUA codon as Met. The first strategy involves the f5CAU anticodon in mt tRNAMet from mammals, nematode, and Drosophila. Indeed, AUA decoding by f5CAU anticodon has been confirmed biochemically (30Takemoto C. Spremulli L.L. Benkowski L.A. Ueda T. Yokogawa T. Watanabe K. Unconventional decoding of the AUA codon as methionine by mitochondrial tRNAMet with the anticodon f5CAU as revealed with a mitochondrial in vitro translation system.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 1616-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 31Lusic H. Gustilo E.M. Vendeix F.A. Kaiser R. Delaney M.O. Graham W.D. Moye V.A. Cantara W.A. Agris P.F. Deiters A. Synthesis and investigation of the 5-formylcytidine modified, anticodon stem and loop of the human mitochondrial tRNAMet.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 6548-6557Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The second strategy involves the τm5UAU anticodon in ascidian (Halocynthia roretzi) mitochondria. In general, the xm5(s2)U modification prevents misreading of near cognate codons ending in pyrimidines (NNY) (9Suzuki T. Grosjean H. Fine-Tuning of RNA Functions by Modification and Editing. Springer Verlag, Berlin2005: 23-69Google Scholar). τm5U would enable tRNA to efficiently decode AUR codons as Met. The third strategy involves the unmodified CAU anticodon described in this study. Non-canonical A-C pairing might be involved in AUA decoding by the CAU anticodon, in which t6A37 would stabilize the codon-anticodon pairing. Biochemical and structural studies will be required to provide mechanistic insights into this type of decoding. The distribution of different types of AUA decoding in animal mitochondria was assumed to be associated with AUR codon usage. In both human and L. bleekeri mitochondria, AUA codons are used about four times more frequently than AUG codons, indicating that AUA is an abundant codon, whose usage is independent of the type of decoding. Therefore, we were unable to draw any meaningful correlation between AUR codon usage and the types of AUA decoding. The three types of AUA decoding mentioned above rely heavily on the specificities of tRNA-modifying enzymes. In the first type, mt tRNAMet, containing a CAU anticodon, may be recognized by a putative f5C-modifying enzyme that has not been identified yet. In the second type, a τm5U-modifying enzyme, probably GTPBP3/MTO1 (4Suzuki T. Nagao A. Suzuki T. Human mitochondrial tRNAs: biogenesis, function, structural aspects, and diseases.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2011; 45: 299-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), recognizes mt tRNAMet with a UAU anticodon. In the third type, although there is no enzyme for f5C formation, t6A-modifying enzymes (4Suzuki T. Nagao A. Suzuki T. Human mitochondrial tRNAs: biogenesis, function, structural aspects, and diseases.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2011; 45: 299-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) recognize mt tRNAMet with a CAU anticodon and introduce t6A at position 37. Further studies directed toward determining the evolutionary distribution of these three types of AUA decoding and characterizing tRNA-modifying enzymes will deepen our understanding of AUA decoding in animal mitochondria. In L. bleekeri, we identified τm5U in mt tRNATrp(UGR), and τm5s2U in mt tRNALeu(UUR) and mt tRNALys(AAR). This is the first reported instance of τm5U and τm5s2U in molluscan mt tRNAs. τm5(s2)U was first identified in mammalian mt tRNAs responsible for Leu(UUR), Trp, Lys, Glu, and Gln (4Suzuki T. Nagao A. Suzuki T. Human mitochondrial tRNAs: biogenesis, function, structural aspects, and diseases.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2011; 45: 299-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 7Suzuki T. Suzuki T.

Taurine as a constituent of mitochondrial tRNAs: new insights into the functions of taurine and human mitochondrial diseases.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6581-6589Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Moreover, we also found τm5(s2)U in fish, 4Takeo Suzuki and Tsutomu Suzuki, unpublished observation. suggesting that τm5(s2)U may be conserved in vertebrate mt tRNAs. In addition, τm5(s2)U was found in three mt tRNAs responsible for non-universal genetic codes in ascidian (H. roretzi) mitochondria (10Suzuki T. Miyauchi K. Suzuki T. Yokobori S. Shigi N. Kondow A. Takeuchi N. Yamagishi A. Watanabe K. Taurine-containing uridine modifications in tRNA anticodons are required to decipher non-universal genetic codes in ascidian mitochondria.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 35494-35498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). On the other hand, τm5(s2)U was not found in yeast or nematode mt tRNAs, which use 5-carboxymethylaminomethyluridine (cmnm5U) instead (32Martin R.P. Sibler A.P. Gehrke C.W. Kuo K. Edmonds C.G.

Unusual usage of wobble modifications in mitochondrial tRNAs of the nematode Ascaris suum.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2767-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Due to the chemical similarity between cmnm5U and τm5U, both nucleotides are thought to be synthesized by a similar biosynthetic pathway, which, in the case of τm5U, results in the replacement of glycine with taurine (7Suzuki T. Suzuki T. Wada T. Saigo K. Watanabe K.

To identify the phylogenetic junction at which τm5U replaced cmnm5U in animal phyla, it will be necessary to analyze additional invertebrate mt tRNAs. Specifically, τm5U seems to have emerged in cephalopoda mt tRNAs. It is intriguing to note that τm5s2U is present in L. bleekeri mt tRNA Leu(UUR). In general, 2-thiouridine derivatives occur in three tRNA species for Lys, Glu, and Gln. In mammalian mitochondria, τm5s2U is found in mt tRNAs for Lys, Glu, and Gln, but not in mt tRNAs for Leu(UUR) or Trp (4Suzuki T. Nagao A. Suzuki T. Human mitochondrial tRNAs: biogenesis, function, structural aspects, and diseases.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2011; 45: 299-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). This is because MnmA, a 2-thiouridylase, strictly discriminates the anticodons of tRNAs (35Numata T. Ikeuchi Y. Fukai S. Suzuki T. Nureki O. Snapshots of tRNA sulphuration via an adenylated intermediate.Nature. 2006; 442: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In human mitochondria, MTU1, a homolog of MnmA, recognizes mt tRNAs for Lys, Glu, and Gln (33Umeda N. Suzuki T. Yukawa M. Ohya Y. Shindo H. Watanabe K. Suzuki T. Mitochondria-specific RNA-modifying enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of the wobble base in mitochondrial tRNAs: implications for the molecular pathogenesis of human mitochondrial diseases.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1613-1624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). A MTU1 homolog in L. bleekeri may have evolved to recognize mt tRNA Leu(UUR). Another intriguing finding is that m5U is present at position 48 in the extra loop of squid mt tRNAMet(AUR), and probably in mt tRNALys(AAR) as well. In many tRNAs, m5U can be found at position 54 in the T-loop, and m5U54-methyltransferase is widely distributed across domains of life. Although various modifications occur in the extra loop of many tRNAs, this is the first instance of tRNAs containing m5U48. We speculate that a specific methyltransferase for m5U48 exists in L. bleekeri and that m5U48 is widely distributed in cephalopod and molluscan mt tRNAs. m5C is often observed at positions 48 and 49 in the extra loop of tRNAs (36Jühling F. Mörl M. Hartmann R.K. Sprinzl M. Stadler P.F. Pütz J. tRNAdb 2009: compilation of tRNA sequences and tRNA genes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D159-D162Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), and m5C49 contributes to the structural stabilization of tRNA (37Nobles K.N. Yarian C.S. Liu G. Guenther R.H. Agris P.F. Highly conserved modified nucleosides influence Mg2+-dependent tRNA folding.Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4751-4760Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 38Alexandrov A. Chernyakov I. Gu W.

Cell. 2006; 21: 87-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). We speculate that m5U48 might have a similar function for the stabilization of tRNAs. In addition, m1G38 in squid mt tRNATrp(UGR) is a unique modification that has never been detected in any other tRNAs to date. m1G37 is commonly found in many tRNAs, including squid mt tRNALeu(UUR). Future studies should examine whether mitochondrial m1G37-methyltransferase in L. bleekeri has acquired the specificity to introduce m1G at position 38 in mt tRNATrp(UGR). There are still four unidentified methyluridines at positions 12 and 13 in tRNATrp(UGR) and positions 16 and 52 in tRNALys(AAR). These modifications might be required for tRNA stabilization as proposed in general (39Motorin Y. Helm M. tRNA stabilization by modified nucleotides.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 4934-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The decoding system for non-universal genetic codes in L. bleekeri mitochondria is summarized in Fig. 4. The AUA codon is deciphered as Met by the CAU anticodon of mt tRNAMet(AUR), UGA codon is deciphered as Trp by the τm5UCA anticodon of mt tRNATrp(UGR), and AGR codons are deciphered as Ser by the m7GCU anticodon of mt tRNASer(AGN).

https://openalex.org/W2146880260,"We have previously shown that the member of the HES family hairy2 induces the ectopic expression of dorsal markers when it is overexpressed in the ventral side of Xenopus embryos. Intriguingly, hairy2 represses the mesoderm transcription factor brachyury (bra) throughout its domain in the marginal zone. Here we show that in early gastrula, bra and hairy2 are expressed in complementary domains. Overexpression of bra repressed hairy2. Interference of bra function with a dominant-negative construct expanded the hairy2 domain and, like hairy2 overexpression, promoted ectopic expression of dorsal axial markers in the ventral side and induced secondary axes without head and notochord. Hairy2 depletion rescued the ectopic dorsal development induced by interference of bra function. We concluded that an intact bra function is necessary to exclude hairy2 expression from the non-organiser field, to impede the ectopic specification of dorsal axial fates and the appearance of incomplete secondary axes. This evidence supports a previously unrecognised role for bra in maintaining the dorsal fates inhibited in the ventral marginal zone, preventing the appearance of trunk duplications."
https://openalex.org/W2081897250,"Recent work suggests that people evaluate target stimuli within short and flexible time periods called evaluation windows. Stimuli that briefly precede a target (forward primes) or briefly succeed a target (backward primes) are often included in the target's evaluation. In this article, the authors propose that predictable forward primes act as “go” signals that prepare target processing, such that earlier forward primes pull the evaluation windows forward in time. Earlier forward primes may thus reduce the impact of backward primes. This shifting evaluation windows hypothesis was tested in two experiments using an evaluative decision task with predictable (vs. unpredictable) forward and backward primes. As expected, a longer time interval between a predictable forward prime and a target eliminated backward priming. In contrast, the time interval between an unpredictable forward primes and a target had no effects on backward priming. These findings suggest that predictable features of dynamic stimuli can shape target extraction by determining which information is included (or excluded) in rapid evaluation processes."
