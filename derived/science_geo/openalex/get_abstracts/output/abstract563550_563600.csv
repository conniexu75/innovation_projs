Current methods typically lose positional information and many require arduous single-cell isolation and sequencing. Ståhl et al. have developed a way of measuring the spatial distribution of transcripts by annealing fixed brain or cancer tissue samples directly to bar-coded reverse transcriptase primers, performing reverse transcription followed by sequencing and computational reconstruction, and they can do so for multiple genes.

The Montreal Protocol, an international treaty that phased out the production of many of the human-made compounds responsible for stratospheric ozone destruction, is widely considered to be the most important and successful international environmental agreement. For years, it has slowed the rate of stratospheric ozone depletion, and now there are signs that the ozone abundance over Antarctica has begun to increase. Solomon et al. present observational data and model results to illustrate the trends and diagnose their causes. Science , this issue p. 269"

Inspired by the clinical success of using chimeric antigen receptor T cells to treat certain types of cancers, Ellebrecht et al. asked whether a similar approach might also work against antibody-driven autoimmune diseases. They engineered T cells to express chimeric receptors consisting of the disease-causing autoantigen desmoglein 3 fused to signaling domains that activate T cells. When given to diseased mice, the engineered T cells targeted and killed B cells that express antibodies targeting desmoglein 3, hinting that such a strategy may be an effective way to treat antibody-driven autoimmune diseases.

We report here a method for the catalytic, asymmetric, migratory geminal difluorination of β-substituted styrenes to access a variety of products bearing difluoromethylated tertiary or quaternary stereocenters. The reaction uses commercially available reagents ( m -chloroperbenzoic acid and hydrogen fluoride pyridine) and a simple chiral aryl iodide catalyst and is carried out readily on a gram scale. Substituent effects and temperature-dependent variations in enantioselectivity suggest that cation-π interactions play an important role in stereodifferentiation by the catalyst."

These events, lasting on average around 1000 years each, have long been thought to result from changes in deep ocean circulation. Henry et al. used a suite of geochemical proxies from marine sediments to show that reductions in the export of northern deep waters occurred before and during stadial periods (see the Perspective by Schmittner). This observation firmly establishes the role of ocean circulation as a cause of abrupt glacial climate change during that interval. Science , this issue p. 470 ; see also p. 445"
https://openalex.org/W2471940646,"INTRODUCTION Regenerative therapies based on cell replacement hold promise for the treatment of a range of age-related degenerative diseases but are limited by unfavorable microenvironments in degenerating tissues. A promising strategy to improve success is to harness endogenous repair mechanisms that promote tissue integrity and function. Innate immune cells are central to such repair mechanisms because they coordinate local and systemic responses to tissue injury by secreting inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals in a context-dependent manner. A proper balance between these opposing phenotypes of innate immune cells is essential for efficient tissue repair, and immune modulation may be an effective way to promote repair and enhance regenerative therapies. Here, we identified a new evolutionarily conserved immune modulatory function for mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) that biases immune cells toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype, thereby promoting tissue repair in both vertebrates and invertebrates and enhancing retinal regenerative therapy. RATIONALE In Drosophila , interactions between damaged tissues and hemocytes are essential for tissue repair. We used this model to identify immune cell–derived factors with immune modulatory activity that promote tissue repair after retinal injury. The identification of MANF as such a factor prompted us to test its role in mammalian retinal repair and ask whether its immune modulatory activity helped cell replacement therapies in degenerating retinas. RESULTS Using a combination of transcriptome analysis and genetic studies, we identified MANF as a hemocyte-derived factor that is induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)– and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)–related factor 1 (Pvf-1)/PDGF- and VEGF-receptor related (PvR) signaling. MANF was necessary and sufficient to promote retinal repair after ultraviolet-light–induced retinal injury in Drosophila. MANF also had an autocrine immune-modulatory function in fly hemocytes, which was necessary for its tissue repair–promoting activity. This regulation and function of MANF was evolutionarily conserved: Mouse photoreceptors expressed PDGF-A (a Pvf-1 homolog) in response to damage signals, which promoted MANF expression in innate immune cells. This PDGF-A/MANF signaling cascade was required to limit photoreceptor apoptosis in the retina. Exogenously supplied recombinant MANF protected photoreceptors in several paradigms of retinal injury and degeneration. As in flies, this prorepair function was associated with alternative activation of macrophages and microglia in the retina. Ablation of CD11b + immune cells and deletion of Cx3Cr1, a chemokine receptor required for MANF-induced alternative activation, prevented MANF-induced repair. Thus, the protective effects of MANF in retinal injury rely on its immune modulatory activity. Finally, MANF supplementation to photoreceptors transplanted into congenitally blind mice increased integration efficiency and accelerated and improved visual function recovery. CONCLUSION Combining genetic studies in invertebrates and vertebrates has rapidly identified factors with promising therapeutic potential. Immune modulation is a promising strategy to optimize regenerative therapies. With its conserved immune modulatory function, MANF is a particularly promising molecule that is likely to be useful for the treatment of inflammatory conditions in many different disease contexts. MANF in retinal repair. In Drosophila (left) or mouse (right), the damaged retina secretes Pvf-1/PDGF-A, which acts on innate immune cells. MANF derived from innate immune cells (and other sources) promotes phenotypic changes in immune cells as part of a mechanism required for tissue repair. Therapeutically, MANF supplementation can delay retinal degeneration and improve the success of cell-replacement regenerative therapies in the retina."
https://openalex.org/W2465185702,"Wind blowing over sand on Earth produces decimeter-wavelength ripples and hundred-meter– to kilometer-wavelength dunes: bedforms of two distinct size modes. Observations from the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reveal that Mars hosts a third stable wind-driven bedform, with meter-scale wavelengths. These bedforms are spatially uniform in size and typically have asymmetric profiles with angle-of-repose lee slopes and sinuous crest lines, making them unlike terrestrial wind ripples. Rather, these structures resemble fluid-drag ripples, which on Earth include water-worked current ripples, but on Mars instead form by wind because of the higher kinematic viscosity of the low-density atmosphere. A reevaluation of the wind-deposited strata in the Burns formation (about 3.7 billion years old or younger) identifies potential wind-drag ripple stratification formed under a thin atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2467667538,"A key challenge in contemporary ecology and conservation is the accurate tracking of the spatial distribution of various human impacts, such as fishing. While coastal fisheries in national waters are closely monitored in some countries, existing maps of fishing effort elsewhere are fraught with uncertainty, especially in remote areas and the High Seas. Better understanding of the behavior of the global fishing fleets is required in order to prioritize and enforce fisheries management and conservation measures worldwide. Satellite-based Automatic Information Systems (S-AIS) are now commonly installed on most ocean-going vessels and have been proposed as a novel tool to explore the movements of fishing fleets in near real time. Here we present approaches to identify fishing activity from S-AIS data for three dominant fishing gear types: trawl, longline and purse seine. Using a large dataset containing worldwide fishing vessel tracks from 2011-2015, we developed three methods to detect and map fishing activities: for trawlers we produced a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) using vessel speed as observation variable. For longliners we have designed a Data Mining (DM) approach using an algorithm inspired from studies on animal movement. For purse seiners a multi-layered filtering strategy based on vessel speed and operation time was implemented. Validation against expert-labeled datasets showed average detection accuracies of 83% for trawler and longliner, and 97% for purse seiner. Our study represents the first comprehensive approach to detect and identify potential fishing behavior for three major gear types operating on a global scale. We hope that this work will enable new efforts to assess the spatial and temporal distribution of global fishing effort and make global fisheries activities transparent to ocean scientists, managers and the public."

https://openalex.org/W2473436258,"Understanding how animals respond to atmospheric conditions across space is critical for understanding the evolution of flight strategies and long-distance migrations. We studied the three-dimensional movements and energetics of great frigate birds ( Fregata minor ) and showed that they can stay aloft for months during transoceanic flights. To do this, birds track the edge of the doldrums to take advantage of favorable winds and strong convection. Locally, they use a roller-coaster flight, relying on thermals and wind to soar within a 50- to 600-meter altitude band under cumulus clouds and then glide over kilometers at low energy costs. To deal with the local scarcity of clouds and gain longer gliding distances, birds regularly soar inside cumulus clouds to use their strong updraft, and they can reach altitudes of 4000 meters, where freezing conditions occur."
https://openalex.org/W2467031968,"Cytoplasmic dynein drives the majority of minus end-directed vesicular and organelle motility in the cell. However, it remains unclear how dynein is spatially and temporally regulated given the variety of cargo that must be properly localized to maintain cellular function. Recent work has suggested that adaptor proteins provide a mechanism for cargo-specific regulation of motors. Of particular interest, studies in fungal systems have implicated Hook proteins in the regulation of microtubule motors. Here we investigate the role of mammalian Hook proteins, Hook1 and Hook3, as potential motor adaptors. We used optogenetic approaches to specifically recruit Hook proteins to organelles and observed rapid transport of peroxisomes to the perinuclear region of the cell. This rapid and efficient translocation of peroxisomes to microtubule minus ends indicates that mammalian Hook proteins activate dynein rather than kinesin motors. Biochemical studies indicate that Hook proteins interact with both dynein and dynactin, stabilizing the formation of a supramolecular complex. Complex formation requires the N-terminal domain of Hook proteins, which resembles the calponin-homology domain of end-binding (EB) proteins but cannot bind directly to microtubules. Single-molecule motility assays using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy indicate that both Hook1 and Hook3 effectively activate cytoplasmic dynein, inducing longer run lengths and higher velocities than the previously characterized dynein activator bicaudal D2 (BICD2). Together, these results suggest that dynein adaptors can differentially regulate dynein to allow for organelle-specific tuning of the motor for precise intracellular trafficking."

For vector-borne disease control strategies, it is important to understand the reproductive biology of the organisms involved. Krzywinska et al. have studied sex determination in species of Anopheles mosquitoes, whose females suck blood and can transmit malaria parasites (see the Perspective by Sinkins). One gene called Yob is found only on the Y chromosome of males. Yob is expressed in male embryos within 2 hours of eggs being laid, and transcription continues lifelong. If Yob is injected into embryos younger than 2 hours, only male mosquitoes emerge, because Yob 's presence is lethal to female embryos. Science , this issue p. 67 ; see also p. 33"

Petry et al. show that indirect climate effects could also alter sex ratios in species in which sex is genetically determined and damage reproductive fitness (see the Perspective by Etterson and Mazer). Over four decades, sex ratios in populations of a dioecious alpine plant have shifted toward females as a result of the different water needs of the male and female plants. The lack of males has reduced the reproductive success and fitness of the females. Similar subtle differences between sexes in environmental sensitivities could eventually lead to population declines. Science , this issue p. 69 ; see also p. 32"

Normally, the bacterium only tolerates one copy of the plasmid, which provides the molecular machinery for injecting toxins into host cells. Wang et al. have found that Y. pestis can only be pathogenic if plasmid numbers are boosted and express enough protein components to assemble a functional virulence apparatus. Problematically, the synthetic activity of the plasmid has such a high metabolic cost that it can impede growth. Thus, the bacterium only allows the plasmid to replicate when it senses a potential host cell. Science , this issue p. 492"

These enzymes either commit sulfur metabolism to cysteine synthesis from homocysteine or utilize cysteine and/or homocysteine for synthesis of H2S, a signaling molecule. We demonstrate that a kinetically controlled heme-dependent metabolite switch in CBS regulates these competing reactions where by cystathionine, the product of CBS, inhibits H2S synthesis by the second enzyme, CSE. Under endoplasmic reticulum stress conditions, induction of CSE and up-regulation of the CBS inhibitor, CO, a product of heme oxygenase-1, flip the operating preference of CSE from cystathionine to cysteine, transiently stimulating H2S production. In contrast, genetic deficiency of CBS leads to chronic stimulation of H2S production. This metabolite switch from cystathionine to cysteine and/or homocysteine renders H2S synthesis by CSE responsive to the known modulators of CBS: S-adenosylmethionine, NO, and CO.

https://openalex.org/W2469955899,"The temporal control mechanisms that precisely control animal development remain largely elusive. The timing of major developmental transitions in insects, including molting and metamorphosis, is coordinated by the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). 20E involves feedback loops to maintain pulses of ecdysteroid biosynthesis leading to its upsurge, whereas the underpinning molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Using the silkworm Bombyx mori as a model, we demonstrated that E75, the 20E primary response gene, mediates a regulatory loop between ecdysteroid biosynthesis and 20E signaling. E75 isoforms A and C directly bind to retinoic acid receptor-related response elements in Halloween gene promoter regions to induce gene expression thus promoting ecdysteroid biosynthesis and developmental transition, whereas isoform B antagonizes the transcriptional activity of isoform A/C through physical interaction. As the expression of E75 isoforms is differentially induced by 20E, the E75-mediated regulatory loop represents a fine autoregulation of steroidogenesis, which contributes to the precise control of developmental timing."

Plasma cholesterol can be reduced by inhibiting lipoprotein production; however, this is associated with steatosis. Previously we showed that lentivirally mediated hepatic expression of microRNA-30c (miR-30c) reduced hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis in mice without causing hepatosteatosis. Because viral therapy would be formidable, we examined whether a miR-30c mimic can be used to mitigate hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis without inducing steatosis. Delivery of a miR-30c mimic to the liver diminished diet-induced hypercholesterolemia in C57BL/6J mice. Reductions in plasma cholesterol levels were significantly correlated with increases in hepatic miR-30c levels. Long term dose escalation studies showed that miR-30c mimic caused sustained reductions in plasma cholesterol with no obvious side effects. Furthermore, miR-30c mimic significantly reduced hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis in Apoe−/− mice. Mechanistic studies showed that miR-30c mimic had no effect on LDL clearance but reduced lipoprotein production by down-regulating microsomal triglyceride transfer protein expression. MiR-30c had no effect on fatty acid oxidation but reduced lipid synthesis. Additionally, whole transcriptome analysis revealed that miR-30c mimic significantly down-regulated hepatic lipid synthesis pathways. Therefore, miR-30c lowers plasma cholesterol and mitigates atherosclerosis by reducing microsomal triglyceride transfer protein expression and lipoprotein production and avoids steatosis by diminishing lipid syntheses.

However, compared with apoB, MTP has been a more favored target to lower plasma lipids because its lipid transfer activity can be measured in vitro and it is amenable to high throughput screening for drug development. Virtually all of the major pharmaceutical companies have, at some point, developed drugs that potently inhibit MTP activity and lower plasma lipids. However, these drugs increase plasma transaminases, markers of liver injury, fatty liver disease, and hepatosteatosis (20Samaha F.F. McKenney J. Bloedon L.T. Sasiela W.J. Rader D.J.

Both lomitapide and mipomersen carry warning labels for hepatic steatosis. Hence, there is a need for new drugs that can lower plasma lipids while avoiding steatosis. Discovery of endogenous microRNAs (miRs) provides a new way of treating dyslipidemia and associated cardiovascular disease (26Fernández-Hernando C. Suárez Y. Rayner K.J. Moore K.J.

Role of microRNA-30c in lipid metabolism, adipogenesis, cardiac remodeling and cancer.Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2015; 26: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). MiRs are endogenous gene products of ∼22 nucleotides. They interact predominantly with the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) of target mRNAs and reduce protein synthesis by augmenting mRNA degradation or by diminishing translation (28Bartel D.P.

Gene regulation. Breakers and blockers—miRNAs at work.Science. 2015; 349: 380-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Different miRs and anti-miRs are in clinical trials for the treatment of various pathologies (31van Rooij E. Kauppinen S. Development of microRNA therapeutics is coming of age.EMBO Mol.

Biotechnol. 2013; 31: 577Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and are expected to be the drugs of the future. Our previous work showed that lentivirally mediated overexpression of miR-30c decreases hepatic MTP expression and activity, lowers plasma cholesterol, and reduces hepatic lipoprotein production without altering hepatic lipids and plasma transaminases in Western diet-fed C57BL/6J (WT) mice (34Soh J. Iqbal J. Queiroz J. Fernandez-Hernando C. Hussain M.M. MicroRNA-30c reduces hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis by decreasing lipid synthesis and lipoprotein secretion.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 892-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Also, lentivirally mediated hepatic overexpression of miR-30c reduced plasma cholesterol and mitigated atherosclerotic plaques in Western diet-fed Apoe−/− mice (34Soh J. Iqbal J. Queiroz J. Fernandez-Hernando C. Hussain M.M. MicroRNA-30c reduces hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis by decreasing lipid synthesis and lipoprotein secretion.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 892-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Because viral delivery to humans for therapeutic use may pose several challenges, we hypothesize that miR-30c analogues can be used to treat hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis in statin-intolerant and familial hypercholesterolemia patients. To begin testing this hypothesis, we performed preclinical studies using a stabilized analogue of miR-30c (“mimic”) to evaluate its efficacy and molecular mechanisms in lowering plasma cholesterol and atherosclerosis in mice. To test the biological potency of the custom synthesized mimic, we transfected human hepatoma Huh-7 cells with the miR-30c mimic or a scrambled control miR (Scr) (Fig. 1). Increasing concentrations of miR-30c mimic significantly reduced MTP activity and apoB secretion compared with Scr (Fig. 1, a and b). The effect of miR-30c reached a maximum at 50 nm. This mostly likely represents saturation of RISC machinery with miR-30c·RISC complexes. Furthermore, time course studies revealed that maximum reductions in MTP activity and apoB secretion occurred 48 h after transfections, and the effect of miR-30c was lost after 96 h (Fig. 1, c and d). These results are in concert with our previous studies (34Soh J. Iqbal J. Queiroz J. Fernandez-Hernando C. Hussain M.M. MicroRNA-30c reduces hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis by decreasing lipid synthesis and lipoprotein secretion.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 892-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), suggesting that the custom synthesized miR-30c mimic is biologically active in reducing MTP activity and apoB secretion in hepatoma cells. To determine whether the mimic can prevent progression of diet-induced hyperlipidemia, miR-30c mimic and Scr were complexed with lipid emulsions and injected into male WT mice placed on a Western diet (Fig. 2). Plasma cholesterol increased in both miR-30c mimic- and Scr-injected groups. However, increases in plasma cholesterol levels were significantly lower (−21 to 26%) in the miR-30c mimic group compared with the Scr group (Fig. 2a). Fasting plasma triglyceride, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), glucose (Fig. 2, b–e), and creatine kinase (CK) levels were not different between the two groups. Moreover, we did not see changes in food intake between both groups. Analyses of different tissues showed that miR-30c levels increased by 6- and 15-fold in the livers and spleens, respectively, of mice receiving the mimic; there were no significant differences in miR-30c levels in the kidney, heart, and jejunum (Fig. 2f). In a separate experiment, we observed that miR-30c was not delivered to adipose tissue (data not shown). In contrast to miR-30c, the hepatic levels of another miR-30 family member, miR-30b, were unaffected (Fig. 2g). Hepatic MTP activity was significantly reduced (−42%) in the miR-30c mimic group (Fig. 2h) with no effect on hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol levels (Fig. 2, i and j). These studies suggest that the delivery of miR-30c mimic to the liver curtailed progression of diet-induced hypercholesterolemia with no effect on hepatic lipids and plasma enzymes. Next, we asked whether miR-30c mimic can reduce plasma cholesterol in hyperlipidemic mice. Male WT mice were fed a Western diet for 4 weeks to induce hyperlipidemia and divided into three groups. One group received PBS, and the other two groups received different doses of either miR-30c mimic or Scr. There were no significant differences between PBS and Scr groups for the various metabolic parameters studied (Fig. 3), indicating that Scr does not affect these parameters. MiR-30c mimic did not affect plasma cholesterol at a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg/week compared with Scr and PBS groups. However, at a 5 mg/kg/week dose, significant sustained reductions in plasma cholesterol levels were seen in the mimic group compared with the Scr or PBS group, reaching a maximal reduction of 38% (Fig. 3a). Plasma triglyceride, AST, and ALT in the mimic group were not significantly different from those in the Scr and PBS groups (not shown). These studies indicate that miR-30c mimic reduces plasma cholesterol in Western diet-fed hyperlipidemic mice without affecting plasma triglyceride and transaminases. Tissue analysis revealed that miR-30c levels increased by 13- and 20-fold in the livers and spleens, respectively, but remained unchanged in kidney, heart, and jejunum of mice injected with the mimic (Fig. 3b). Contrary to miR-30c, hepatic miR-30b was not increased in the mimic-injected group compared with control groups (Fig. 3c). Expression levels of miR-30c putative target genes (Mttp, Lpgat1, Qki, and Elovl5) were significantly reduced in the mimic group compared with the PBS and Scr groups, whereas no significant changes were observed for non-target genes (ApoA1 and Gapdh) (Fig. 3d). Additionally, MTP activity was significantly lower in the mimic group compared with control groups (Fig. 3e). Moreover, there were no significant differences in hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels (not shown). These studies show that miR-30c reduced hepatic MTP activity without causing steatosis. The studies in Figs. 2 and 3 showed that miR-30c injections reduced plasma cholesterol and increased hepatic miR-30c levels. To determine whether these two observations were related, we carried out a Spearman correlation analysis. There was a significant positive correlation between increases in hepatic miR-30c levels and percent reductions in plasma cholesterol levels. The slope of the curve was ∼2, predicting that a ∼2-fold increase in hepatic miR-30c might reduce plasma cholesterol by 50%. Thus, there is a significant positive correlation between hepatic miR-30c accretions and plasma cholesterol reduction. Next, we studied the time course and long term effects of escalating doses of miR-30c mimic in female WT mice that were fed a Western diet for 4 weeks (Fig. 4). In previous studies, we used male mice. Here, we used females to demonstrate universality of miR-30c effects. After a single injection of 5 mg/kg/week miR-30c mimic, significant reductions in plasma cholesterol were evident on day 2, and the highest reduction of 21% was on day 6 (Fig. 4a). After day 10, plasma cholesterol reverted to normal levels as in the PBS group. Next, we asked whether successive injections would elicit a similar response. Two subsequent injections of 5 mg/kg/week significantly decreased plasma cholesterol until day 6; plasma cholesterol returned to normal on day 10 (Fig. 4a). We then increased the dose to 7.5 mg/kg/week and observed a similar response; plasma cholesterol was reduced for 6 days and subsequently rebounded to normal levels (Fig. 4a). Increasing the dose to 10 mg/kg/week by injecting 5 mg/kg on 2 consecutive days reduced plasma cholesterol by ∼39%. Two subsequent 10 mg/kg/week injections reduced plasma cholesterol by 36–40% when compared with the PBS group. There were no significant differences in plasma triglycerides in these groups throughout the study. Mice were then subjected to euthanasia 6 days after the last injection. FPLC analysis of pooled plasma revealed reduced cholesterol levels in the VLDL/LDL fraction (Fig. 4b, left) with no effect on triglyceride (not shown). Quantification of areas under the curve revealed a 30% reduction of cholesterol in the VLDL/LDL fraction (Fig. 4b, right). The plasma of miR-30c mimic-injected mice had significantly lower apoB100 and apoB48, but apoA-I levels were not different (Fig. 4c). These long term studies involving multiple injections had no effect on plasma ALT, AST, and CK activities and phospholipids and food intake. Hepatic analysis of miR-30c levels revealed an ∼4-fold increase in miR-30c levels. Furthermore, MTP mRNA was significantly reduced in the miR-30c mimic-injected group (Fig. 4d). Additionally, there was a 50% reduction in hepatic MTP, but not GAPDH, protein (Fig. 4e). In contrast, hepatic cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospholipids were not different between the treatment groups (not shown). These studies indicated that a single injection of miR-30c lowers plasma cholesterol in VLDL/LDL for about a week in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, multiple injections consistently reproduce these effects with no obvious long term adverse effects. To understand physiological mechanisms for reductions in plasma cholesterol, we first aimed at studying whether miR-30c mimic increases LDL clearance and therefore reduces plasma cholesterol. Male WT mice were fed a Western diet and injected with either PBS or miR-30c mimic for 2 weeks. MiR-30c mimic significantly reduced plasma cholesterol by −33% without affecting plasma triglyceride. LDL clearance studies showed that miR-30c mimic had no significant effect on apoB and apoA-I clearance (not shown), indicating that miR-30c mimic does not increase the rate of LDL clearance. To explain how miR-30c mimic reduces plasma cholesterol, we performed hepatic lipoprotein production studies in separate sets of animals (Fig. 5). MiR-30c mimic maximally reduced plasma cholesterol concentrations by 39% (not shown) as a result of changes in non-high density lipoproteins (Fig. 5a). However, it did not significantly affect triglycerides in the whole plasma or within different lipoprotein fractions (Fig. 5b). After the injection of poloxamer 407 to inhibit lipoprotein lipases (35Millar J.S. Cromley D.A. McCoy M.G. Rader D.J. Billheimer J.T. Determining hepatic triglyceride production in mice: comparison of poloxamer 407 with Triton WR-1339.J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 2023-2028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), the miR-30c mimic group accumulated lower amounts of plasma triglycerides (Fig. 5c) due to significantly reduced triglyceride production rates (207 mg·dl−1·h−1) compared with controls (334 mg·dl−1·h−1). Furthermore, the amounts of newly synthesized and secreted apoB100 and apoB48, but not apoA-I, were lower in the plasma of the miR-30c mimic group (Fig. 5d). These studies indicate that miR-30c mimic lowers hepatic production of triglyceride-rich apoB-containing lipoproteins. Besides the liver, the intestine is another major organ involved in lipoprotein synthesis and secretion. Therefore, we asked whether miR-30c mimic also influences intestinal lipoprotein production. There were no significant differences in the absorption of lipids between the PBS and miR-30c mimic groups (Fig. 5, e and f). This is consistent with no accretions of miR-30c in the jejunum (Fig. 3e). Thus, intravenous injection of miR-30c mimic has no effect on intestinal lipid absorption as it is not delivered to the jejunum. To further test the hypothesis that miR-30c mimic reduces hepatic lipoprotein production primarily through suppression of MTP activity, we examined the effect of the mimic in Western diet-fed, liver-specific MTP-deficient (Albumin-Cre:Mttpflox/flox, L-Mttp−/−) mice that do not secrete lipoproteins from the liver (36Khatun I. Zeissig S. Iqbal J. Wang M. Curiel D. Shelness G.S. Blumberg R.S. Hussain M.M.

MiR-30c mimic had no effect on cholesterol and triglyceride in total plasma and different lipoprotein fractions (Fig. 6a and data"
https://openalex.org/W2467841765,"Colour and pattern are key traits with important roles in camouflage, warning and attraction. Ideally, in order to begin to understand the evolution and ecology of colour in nature, it is important to identify and, where possible, fully characterise pigments using biochemical methods. The phylum Mollusca includes some of the most beautiful exemplars of biological pigmentation, with the vivid colours of sea shells particularly prized by collectors and scientists alike. Biochemical studies of molluscan shell colour were fairly common in the last century, but few of these studies have been confirmed using modern methods and very few shell pigments have been fully characterised. Here, we use modern chemical and multi-modal spectroscopic techniques to identify two porphyrin pigments and eumelanin in the shell of marine snails Clanculus pharaonius and C margaritarius. The same porphyrins were also identified in coloured foot tissue of both species. We use high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to show definitively that these porphyrins are uroporphyrin I and uroporphyrin III. Evidence from confocal microscopy analyses shows that the distribution of porphyrin pigments corresponds to the striking pink-red of C. pharaonius shells, as well as pink-red dots and lines on the early whorls of C. margaritarius and yellow-brown colour of later whorls. Additional HPLC results suggest that eumelanin is likely responsible for black spots. We refer to the two differently coloured porphyrin pigments as trochopuniceus (pink-red) and trochoxouthos (yellow-brown) in order to distinguish between them. Trochopuniceus and trochoxouthos were not found in the shell of a third species of the same superfamily, Calliostoma zizyphinum, despite its superficially similar colouration, suggesting that this species has different shell pigments. These findings have important implications for the study of colour and pattern in molluscs specifically, but in other taxa more generally, since this study shows that homology of visible colour cannot be assumed without identification of pigments."

This study derived a dietary pattern using an a priori method and additionally derived dietary patterns using a posteriori methods, and assessed the relationship with CVD risk factors in Taiwanese middle-aged and elderly adults. Methods Cross-sectional analyses of 62,965 subjects aged 40 years and above from the Mei Jau (MJ) database collected between 2003 and 2012 in Taiwan. Diet was assessed using a 22 item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Using this information, three dietary patterns were generated. The a priori diet was labeled the Taiwanese dietary pattern and was derived using hypothesized effect of 22 food groups, while two a posteriori dietary patterns, “vegi-fruits” and “meat-processed”, were derived using principal component analysis. The association between dietary patterns and a range of CVD risk factors (i.e. blood lipids, blood glucose and C-reactive protein) was evaluated using linear regression. Results The results showed that high intake (Q5, quintile 5) of Taiwanese diet was negatively associated with CVD risk factors at (p < 0.001, model 3), but not with triacylglycerol. In addition, high intake of vegi-fruit dietary pattern (Q5) was negatively associated with CVD risk factors (p < 0.001), but not with high-density lipoprotein, while high consumption of meat-processed dietary pattern (Q5) was positively associated with CVD risk factors (p < 0.001), but negatively related with triacylglycerol in Q3 level and no association with C-reactive protein. Conclusion A negative association was observed between Taiwanese or vegi-fruit dietary patterns and CVD risk factors, while a positive association was found between meat-processed dietary pattern and CVD risk factors. The findings suggested that a diet rich in vegetables and fruits has a beneficial effect in the management of CVD risk factors."

However, current information about the epigenetic toxicity of SiNPs is insufficient. In this study, the epigenetic regulation of low-dose exposure to SiNPs was evaluated in human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells over 30 passages. Cell viability was decreased in a dose- and passage-dependent manner. The apoptotic rate, the expression of caspase-9 and caspase-3, were significantly increased induced by SiNPs. HumanMethylation450 BeadChip analysis identified that the PI3K/Akt as the primary apoptosis-related pathway among the 25 significant altered processes. The differentially methylated sites of PI3K/Akt pathway involved 32 differential genes promoters, in which the CREB3L1 and Bcl-2 were significant hypermethylated. The methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza, further verified that the DNA hypermethylation status of CREB3L1 and Bcl-2 were associated with downregulation of their mRNA levels. In addition, mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis was triggered by SiNPs via the downregulation of PI3K/Akt/CREB/Bcl-2 signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that long-term low-dose exposure to SiNPs could lead to epigenetic alterations."

https://openalex.org/W2475197706,"Objective Both objective and subjective aspects of social isolation have been associated with alterations in immune markers relevant to multiple chronic diseases among older adults. However, these associations may be confounded by health status, and it is unclear whether these social factors are associated with immune functioning among relatively healthy adults. The goal of this study was to examine the associations between perceived loneliness and circulating levels of inflammatory markers among a diverse sample of adults. Methods Data come from a subset of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (n = 441). Loneliness was measured by three items derived from the UCLA Loneliness Scale. The association between loneliness and C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen was assessed using multivariable linear regression analyses. Models were adjusted for demographic and health characteristics. Results Approximately 50% of participants reported that they hardly ever felt lonely and 17.2% felt highly lonely. Individuals who were unmarried/unpartnered or with higher depressive symptoms were more likely to report being highly lonely. There was no relationship between perceived loneliness and ln(CRP) (β = -0.051, p = 0.239) adjusting for demographic and health characteristics. Loneliness was inversely associated with ln(fibrinogen) (β = -0.091, p = 0.040), although the absolute magnitude of this relationship was small. Conclusion These results indicate that loneliness is not positively associated with fibrinogen or CRP among relatively healthy middle-aged adults."

Using the example of influenza A, we illustrate how the measurement of infection-related quantities that determine the dynamics of viral load within the human host, can inform investigators on the course and severity of infection and the efficacy of a novel treatment. We estimated the values of key infection-related quantities that determine the course of natural infection from viral load data, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. The data were placebo group viral load measurements collected during volunteer challenge studies, conducted by Roche, as part of the oseltamivir trials. We calculated the values of the quantities for each patient and the correlations between the quantities, symptom severity and body temperature. The greatest variation among individuals occurred in the viral load peak and area under the viral load curve. Total symptom severity correlated positively with the basic reproductive number. The most sensitive endpoint for therapeutic trials with the goal to cure patients is the duration of infection. We suggest laboratory experiments to obtain more precise estimates of virological quantities that can supplement clinical endpoint measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2474651172,"Microtubule inhibitors have been shown to inhibit Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) signal transduction pathway in various cancer cells. However, little is known of the mechanism by which the microtubule inhibitors inhibit STAT3 activity. In the present study, we examined the effect of a novel small-molecule microtubule inhibitor, MPT0B098, on STAT3 signaling in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Treatment of various OSCC cells with MPT0B098 induced growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, as well as increased the protein level of SOCS3. The accumulation of SOCS3 protein enhanced its binding to JAK2 and TYK2 which facilitated the ubiquitination and degradation of JAK2 and TYK2, resulting in a loss of STAT3 activity. The inhibition of STAT3 activity led to sensitization of OSCC cells to MPT0B098 cytotoxicity, indicating that STAT3 is a key mediator of drug resistance in oral carcinogenesis. Moreover, the combination of MPT0B098 with the clinical drug cisplatin or 5-FU significantly augmented growth inhibition and apoptosis in OSCC cells. Taken together, our results provide a novel mechanism for the action of MPT0B098 in which the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway is suppressed through the modulation of SOCS3 protein level. The findings also provide a promising combinational therapy of MPT0B098 for OSCC."

Materials and Methods The medical records of 597 patients with 1021 lesions (720 BCC, 242 SCC, 59 SCC in situ) treated with kilovoltage radiation from 1979–2013 were retrospectively reviewed. The majority of patients were treated according to 1 of 3 institutional protocols based on the discretion of the radiation oncologist: 1) 22 x 2.5 Gy; 2) 20 x 2.5 Gy; 3) 30 x 2.0 Gy. ""T"" stage at first presentation was as follows: Tis (59); T1 (765); T2 (175); T3 (6), T4 (9); Tx, (7). All patients were clinical N0 and M0 at presentation. Chi-square test was used to evaluate any potential association between variables. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze survival with the Log Rank test used for comparison. A Cox Regression analysis was performed for multivariate analysis. Results The median follow up was 44 months. No significant difference was observed among the 3 prescribed fractionation schemes (p = 0.78) in terms of RTOG toxicity. There were no failures among SCC in situ, 37 local failures (23 BCC, 14 SCC), 5 regional failures (all SCC) and 2 distant failures (both SCC). For BCC, the 5-year LC was 96% and the 10-year LC was 94%. For SCC the corresponding rates of local control were 92% and 87%, respectively (p = 0.03). The use of >2.0 Gy daily was significantly associated with improved LC on multivariate analysis (HR: 0.17; CI 95%: 0.05–0.59). Conclusion SXRT for N-MSC of the head and neck is well tolerated, achieves excellent local control, and should continue to be recommended in the management of this disease. Fractionation schedules using >2.0 Gy daily appear to be associated with improved LC."

However, the mechanisms by which postoperative lymphedema develops in obese patients and the mechanisms by which leptin regulates lymphatic endothelial cell homeostasis such as tube formation and cell proliferation remain unknown. Here we report that leptin regulates tube formation and cell proliferation in human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (HDLECs) by activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway, which is downstream signaling of the leptin receptor. Additionally, we found that upregulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 underlies the mechanisms by which a high dose of leptin inhibits cell proliferation and tube formation. Leptin also enhanced expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 in HDLECs. Interestingly, IL-6 rescues the compromised cell proliferation and tube formation caused by treatment with a high dose of leptin in an autocrine or paracrine manner. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which compromised HDLECs maintain their homeostasis during inflammation mediated by leptin and IL-6. Thus, regulating the level of leptin or IL-6 may be a viable strategy to reduce the incidence of postoperative lymphedema."
https://openalex.org/W2460611316,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation has been shown to play a critical role in tumor angiogenesis. In this study, we investigate the correlation between EGFR mutations and cadherin-5 (CDH5), which is an angiogenic factor, in lung cancer cells. Increased expression CDH5 is observed in lung cancer cells with EGFR mutations. Stable lung cancer cell lines expressing mutant (exon 19 deletion E746-A750, and exon 21 missense mutation L858R) and wild type EGFR genes are established. A significantly higher expression of CDH5 is observed in exon 19 deletion stable lung cancer cells and mouse xenografts. Further studies show that expression of CDH5 is decreased after the inhibition of EGFR and downstream Akt pathways in lung cancer cells with EGFR mutation. In addition, mutant EGFR genes potentiates angiogenesis in lung cancer cells, which is inhibited by CDH5 siRNA, and potentiates migration and invasion in lung cancer cells. Our study shows that mutant EGFR genes are associated with overexpression of CDH5 through increased phosphorylation of EGFR and downstream Akt pathways. Our result may provide an insight into the association of mutant EGFR and CDH5 expression in lung cancer and aid further development of target therapy for NSCLC in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2467275315,"The yeast vacuole requires four SNAREs to trigger membrane fusion including the soluble Qc-SNARE Vam7. The N-terminal PX domain of Vam7 binds to the lipid phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) and the tethering complex HOPS (homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting complex), whereas the C-terminal SNARE motif forms SNARE complexes. Vam7 also contains an uncharacterized middle domain that is predicted to be a coiled-coil domain with multiple helices. One helix contains a polybasic region (PBR) composed of Arg-164, Arg-168, Lys-172, Lys-175, Arg-179, and Lys-186. Polybasic regions are often associated with nonspecific binding to acidic phospholipids including phosphoinositides. Although the PX (phox homology) domain alone binds PI3P, we theorized that the Vam7 PBR could bind to additional acidic phospholipids enriched at fusion sites. Mutating each of the basic residues in the PBR to an alanine (Vam7-6A) led to attenuated vacuole fusion. The defective fusion of Vam7-6A was due in part to inefficient association with its cognate SNAREs and HOPS, yet the overall vacuole association of Vam7-6A was similar to wild type. Experiments testing the binding of Vam7 to specific signaling lipids showed that mutating the PBR to alanines augmented binding to PI3P. The increased binding to PI3P by Vam7-6A likely contributed to the observed wild type levels of vacuole association, whereas protein-protein interactions were diminished. PI3P binding was inhibited when the PX domain mutant Y42A was introduced into Vam7-6A to make Vam7-7A.

As smartphone usage escalates, this raises the public's concern whether hand activities while using smartphones can lead to median nerve problems.The aims of this study were to 1) develop kinematic graphs and 2) investigate the associated deformation and rotational information of median nerve in the carpal tunnel during hand activities.Dominant wrists of 30 young adults were examined with ultrasonography by placing a transducer transversely on their wrist crease. Ultrasound video clips were recorded when the subject performing 1) thumb opposition with the wrist in neutral position, 2) thumb opposition with the wrist in ulnar deviation and 3) pinch grip with the wrist in neutral position. Six still images that were separated by 0.2-second intervals were then captured from the ultrasound video for the determination of 1) cross-sectional area (CSA), 2) flattening ratio (FR), 3) rotational displacement (RD) and 4) translational displacement (TD) of median nerve in the carpal tunnel, and these collected information of deformation, rotational and displacement of median nerve were compared between 1) two successive time points during a single hand activity and 2) different hand motions at the same time point. Finally, kinematic graphs were constructed to demonstrate the mobility of median nerve during different hand activities.Performing different hand activities during this study led to a gradual reduction in CSA of the median nerve, with thumb opposition together with the wrist in ulnar deviation causing the greatest extent of deformation of the median nerve. Thumb opposition with the wrist in ulnar deviation also led to the largest extent of TD when compared to the other two hand activities of this study. Kinematic graphs showed that the motion pathways of median nerve during different hand activities were complex.We observed that the median nerve in the carpal tunnel was rotated, deformed and displaced during the hand activities that people may be performed when using a smartphone, suggesting an increased risk of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). In addition, the kinematic graphs of median nerve developed in the present study provide new clues for further studies on the pathophysiology of CTS, and alerting smartphone users to establish proper postural habits when using handheld electronic devices."

The functional significance of the Hsc70-TH interaction was then investigated using TH activity assays. In both dopaminergic MN9D cells and mouse brain synaptic vesicles, purified Hsc70 facilitated an increase in TH activity. Neither the closely related protein Hsp70 nor the unrelated Hsp60 altered TH activity, confirming the specificity of the Hsc70 effect. Overexpression of Hsc70 in dopaminergic MN9D cells consistently resulted in increased TH activity whereas knockdown of Hsc70 by short hairpin RNA resulted in decreased TH activity and dopamine levels. Finally, in cells with reduced levels of Hsc70, the amount of TH associated with synaptic vesicles was decreased. This effect was rescued by addition of purified Hsc70.

The present work was undertaken to test the hypothesis that a particular aromatic sandwich structure of two amino acids proximal to the active site of the T. cruzi trans-sialidase infers trans-sialidase activity. On this basis, four enzymes with putative trans-sialidase activity were identified through an iterative alignment from 2909 native sialidases available in GenBank, which were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Of these, one enzyme, SialH, derived from Haemophilus parasuis had an aromatic sandwich structure on the protein surface facing the end of the catalytic site (Phe168; Trp366), and was indeed found to exhibit trans-sialidase activity. SialH catalyzed production of the human milk oligosaccharide 3'-sialyllactose as well as the novel trans-sialylation product 3-sialyllactose using casein glycomacropeptide as sialyl donor and lactose as acceptor. The findings corroborated that Tyr119 and Trp312 in the T. cruzi trans-sialidase are part of an aromatic sandwich structure that confers trans-sialylation activity for lactose sialylation. The in silico identification of trans-glycosidase activity by rational active site topology alignment thus proved to be a quick tool for selecting putative trans-sialidases amongst a large group of glycosyl hydrolases. The approach moreover provided data that help understand structure-function relations of trans-sialidases."
https://openalex.org/W2474047786,"In many families of cell surface receptors, a single transmembrane (TM) α-helix separates ecto- and cytosolic domains. A defined coupling of ecto- and TM domains must be essential to allosteric receptor regulation but remains little understood. Here, we characterize the linker structure, dynamics, and resulting ecto-TM domain coupling of integrin αIIb in model constructs and relate it to other integrin α subunits by mutagenesis. Cellular integrin activation assays subsequently validate the findings in intact receptors. Our results indicate a flexible yet carefully tuned ecto-TM coupling that modulates the signaling threshold of integrin receptors. Interestingly, a proline at the N-terminal TM helix border, termed NBP, is critical to linker flexibility in integrins. NBP is further predicted in 21% of human single-pass TM proteins and validated in cytokine receptors by the TM domain structure of the cytokine receptor common subunit β and its P441A-substituted variant. Thus, NBP is a conserved uncoupling motif of the ecto-TM domain transition and the degree of ecto-TM domain coupling represents an important parameter in the allosteric regulation of diverse cell surface receptors."

Given the indispensable role of heme, this auxotrophy may be exploited to develop drugs that interfere with heme uptake in parasites. Although multiple heme-responsive genes (HRGs) have been characterized within the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we have undertaken the first study of heme transport in Brugia malayi, a causative agent of lymphatic filariasis. Through functional assays in yeast, as well as heme analog, RNAi, and transcriptomic experiments, we have shown that the heme transporter B. malayi HRG-1 (BmHRG-1) is indeed functional in B. malayi. In addition, BmHRG-1 localizes both to the endocytic compartments and cell membrane when expressed in yeast cells. Transcriptomic sequencing revealed that BmHRG-1, BmHRG-2, and BmMRP-5 (all orthologs of HRGs in C. elegans) are down-regulated in heme-treated B. malayi, as compared tonon–heme-treated control worms. Likely because of short gene lengths, multiple exons, other HRGs in B. malayi (BmHRG-3–6) remain unidentified. Although the precise mechanisms of heme homeostasis in a nematode with the ability to acquire heme remains unknown, this study clearly demonstrates that the filarial nematode B. malayi is capable of transporting exogenous heme.—Luck, A.

https://openalex.org/W2475245337,"Marine populations are controlled by a series of drivers, pertaining to both the physical environment and the biological environment (trophic predator-prey interactions). There is heated debate over drivers, especially when trying to understand the causes of major ecosystem events termed regime shifts. In this work, we have researched and developed a novel methodology based on Genetic Programming (GP) for distinguishing which drivers can influence species abundance. This methodology benefits of having no a priori assumptions either on the ecological parameters used or on the underlying mathematical relationships among them. We have validated this methodology applying it to the North Sea pelagic ecosystem. We use the target species Calanus finmarchicus, a key copepod in temperate and subarctic ecosystems, along with 86 biological, hydrographical and climatic time series, ranging from local water nutrients and fish predation, to large scale climate pressure patterns. The chosen study area is the central North Sea, from 1972 to 2011, during which period there was an ecological regime shift. The GP based analysis identified 3 likely drivers of C. finmarchicus abundance, which highlights the importance of considering both physical and trophic drivers: temperature, North Sea circulation (net flow into the North Atlantic), and predation (herring). No large scale climate patterns were selected, suggesting that when there is availability of both data types, local drivers are more important. The results produced by the GP based procedure are consistent with the literature published to date, and validate the use of GP for interpreting species dynamics. We propose that this methodology holds promises for the highly non-linear field of ecology."

https://openalex.org/W2464678716,"Aberrant androgen receptor (AR)-dependent transcription is a hallmark of human prostate cancers. At the molecular level, ligand-mediated AR activation is coordinated through spatial and temporal protein-protein interactions involving AR-interacting proteins, which we designate the “AR-interactome.” Despite many years of research, the ligand-sensitive protein complexes involved in ligand-mediated AR activation in prostate tumor cells have not been clearly defined. Here, we describe the development, characterization, and utilization of a novel human LNCaP prostate tumor cell line, N-AR, which stably expresses wild-type AR tagged at its N terminus with the streptavidin-binding peptide epitope (streptavidin-binding peptide-tagged wild-type androgen receptor; SBP-AR). A bioanalytical workflow involving streptavidin chromatography and label-free quantitative mass spectrometry was used to identify SBP-AR and associated ligand-sensitive cytosolic proteins/protein complexes linked to AR activation in prostate tumor cells. Functional studies verified that ligand-sensitive proteins identified in the proteomic screen encoded modulators of AR-mediated transcription, suggesting that these novel proteins were putative SBP-AR-interacting proteins in N-AR cells. This was supported by biochemical associations between recombinant SBP-AR and the ligand-sensitive coatomer protein complex I (COPI) retrograde trafficking complex in vitro. Extensive biochemical and molecular experiments showed that the COPI retrograde complex regulates ligand-mediated AR transcriptional activation, which correlated with the mobilization of the Golgi-localized ARA160 coactivator to the nuclear compartment of prostate tumor cells. Collectively, this study provides a bioanalytical strategy to validate the AR-interactome and define novel AR-interacting proteins involved in ligand-mediated AR activation in prostate tumor cells. Moreover, we describe a cellular system to study how compartment-specific AR-interacting proteins influence AR activation and contribute to aberrant AR-dependent transcription that underlies the majority of human prostate cancers."

The association between viral genotypes and severity of clinical cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is yet to be defined. The objective of this study was to find the impact of active CMV infection during pregnancy and the clinical significance of genotypes in neonates with congenital cytomegalovirus infections in Pakistan.A total of 409 blood samples from pregnant women seeking health care services at the two antenatal hospitals of Islamabad during January to December 2012 were tested by ELISA and nested-PCR. Pregnant women with active infection (detected as IgM positive, PCR positive or positive on both assays) were followed until delivery, to detect the outcome of overt cCMV infection in neonates. Genetic characterization of CMV strains was performed by sequence analysis of envelope glycoproteins: gB, gN and gH to detect the contributing CMV genotypes.The seroprevalence of anti-CMV IgG and IgM was 97.5% (399 out of 409) and 12.7% (52 out of 409), respectively, while 20% (82/409) pregnant women were found positive for CMV DNA by PCR. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association of active infection with parity [OR = 2.56, 95% CI = 1.82-2.62, p = 0.04], febrile illness [OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.76-3.65, p = 0.01] and jaundice [OR = 22.5, 95% CI = 4.53-85.02, p = 0.002]. We were able to isolate virus in 41 out of 70 neonates; 36.6% (15 out of 41) of them were symptomatic at birth while 63.4% (26 out of 41) were asymptomatic. The most prominent clinical feature observed in symptomatic neonates was hepatosplenomegaly (26.6%; 4 out of 15). All three genotypes gB, gN and gH were found with the highest frequency of gB1 genotype, found in 75% infants with hepatic damage. Phylogenetic analysis of Pakistani strains showed 96%-100% homology to their prototype strains.Active CMV infection during pregnancy is a major cause of congenital CMV infection with comparable distribution of all three genotypes: gB, gN and gH in symptomatic and asymptomatic neonates. Our findings emphasize to conduct a comprehensive large scale survey and introduction of country wide routine screening at maternity clinics for early diagnosis of CMV to reduce its associated devastating outcomes."

Community participation is essential for childhood development and enjoyment, yet children with ABI can often experience barriers to participation. The factors which act as barriers and facilitators to community participation for children with an ABI are not well understood. Aim To identify the viewpoints of parents of children with an ABI, regarding the barriers and facilitators most pertinent to community participation for their child. Methods Using Q-method, 41 parents of children with moderate/severe ABI sorted 37 statements regarding barriers and facilitators to community participation. Factor analysis identified three viewpoints. Results This study identified three distinct viewpoints, with the perceived ability to participate decreasing with a stepwise trend from parents who felt their child and family “can” participate in viewpoint one, to “want” in viewpoint two and “try” in viewpoint three. Conclusions Findings indicated good participation outcomes for most children and families, however some families who were motivated to participate experienced significant barriers. The most significant facilitators included child motivation, supportive relationships from immediate family and friends, and supportive community attitudes. The lack of supportive relationships and attitudes was perceived as a fundamental barrier to community participation. Significance This research begins to address the paucity of information regarding those factors that impact upon the participation of children with an ABI in Australia. Findings have implications for therapists, service providers and community organisations."

The insights into the genetic basis of growth period traits can provide theoretical basis for cultivated area division, rational distribution, and molecular breeding for soybean varieties. In this study, genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) was exploited to detect the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for number of days to flowering (ETF), number of days from flowering to maturity (FTM), and number of days to maturity (ETM) using 4032 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers with 146 cultivars mainly from Northeast China. Results showed that abundant phenotypic variation was presented in the population, and variation explained by genotype, environment, and genotype by environment interaction were all significant for each trait. The whole accessions could be clearly clustered into two subpopulations based on their genetic relatedness, and accessions in the same group were almost from the same province. GWAS based on the unified mixed model identified 19 significant SNPs distributed on 11 soybean chromosomes, 12 of which can be consistently detected in both planting densities, and 5 of which were pleotropic QTL. Of 19 SNPs, 7 SNPs located in or close to the previously reported QTL or genes controlling growth period traits. The QTL identified with high resolution in this study will enrich our genomic understanding of growth period traits and could then be explored as genetic markers to be used in genomic applications in soybean breeding."

Here, we identified Ser36 as the major p70S6k phosphorylation site, along with a low frequency site at Thr40, using an in vitro phosphorylation assay combined with mass spectrometry. The functional consequences of p70S6k phosphorylation were tested with the phosphomimetic mutant S36E, which displayed only about 20% (20 μmol/min/mg) of the activity of WT enzyme (95 μmol/min/mg), whereas the enzyme activity of T40E was not significantly affected. The enzyme activity of S36E increased linearly with increasing LTA4 concentrations during the steady-state kinetics analysis, indicating poor lipid substrate binding. The Ser36 is located in a loop region close to the entrance of the proposed substrate binding pocket. Comparative molecular dynamics indicated that Ser36 upon phosphorylation will pull the first luminal loop of LTC4S toward the neighboring subunit of the functional homotrimer, thereby forming hydrogen bonds with Arg104 in the adjacent subunit. Because Arg104 is a key catalytic residue responsible for stabilization of the glutathione thiolate anion, this phosphorylation-induced interaction leads to a reduction of the catalytic activity. In addition, the positional shift of the loop and its interaction with the neighboring subunit affect active site access.

Leukotrienes: mediators of immediate hypersensitivity reactions and inflammation.Science. 1983; 220: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (2320) Google Scholar). The cys-LTs signal through two G-protein-coupled receptors, denoted CysLT1 and CysLT2, to exert their biological functions such as smooth muscle contraction and increased vascular permeability. Several drugs, typified by montelukast, have been developed that specifically target the CysLT1 receptor (4Drazen J.M. Israel E. O'Byrne P.M. Treatment of asthma with drugs modifying the leukotriene pathway.N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Recently, additional G-protein-coupled receptors that recognize cys-LTs have been identified, in particular gpr17 and CysLT3 (5Maekawa A. Balestrieri B. Austen K.F. Kanaoka Y.

The increasing complexity of cys-LT signaling has promoted research and drug development efforts targeting the upstream LTC4S as it catalyzes the committed step in cys-LT biosynthesis (7Haeggström J.Z.

The leukotrienes are derived from arachidonic acid through the 5-lipoxygenase pathway where cytosolic phospholipase A2, 5-lipoxygenase, and 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein play important roles (7Haeggström J.Z.

Protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation appear to be important regulatory mechanisms for cellular LT biosynthesis. The two key upstream enzymes, cytosolic phospholipase A2 and 5-lipoxygenase, are regulated through phosphorylation events, apparently for activation (8Gijón M.A. Spencer D.M. Kaiser A.L. Leslie C.C.

LTC4S is yet another enzyme in the 5-lipoxygenase pathway that is regulated by intracellular phosphorylation (10Ali A. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Nicholson D.W. Activation of protein kinase C down-regulates leukotriene C4 synthase activity and attenuates cysteinyl leukotriene production in an eosinophilic substrain of HL-60 cells.J.

Demonstration of cell-specific phosphorylation of LTC4 synthase.FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). LTC4S is an integral membrane protein that belongs to the MAPEG (membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism) superfamily whose six human members share structural similarity and form homotrimeric enzymes involved in arachidonic acid metabolism and detoxification (12Jakobsson P.J. Morgenstern R. Mancini J. Ford-Hutchinson A. Persson B.

For 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, LTC4S, and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1, crystal structures have been determined (13Martinez Molina D. Wetterholm A. Kohl A. McCarthy A.A. Niegowski D.

Crystal structure of a human membrane protein involved in cysteinyl leukotriene biosynthesis.Nature. 2007; 448: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Besides LTC4S, no other MAPEG member has been reported to be regulated by phosphorylation. Phosphoregulation of LTC4S was first recognized when protein kinase C (PKC) activation of leukocytes was found to down-regulate LTC4S enzyme activity and attenuate cys-LT production (10Ali A. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Nicholson D.W. Activation of protein kinase C down-regulates leukotriene C4 synthase activity and attenuates cysteinyl leukotriene production in an eosinophilic substrain of HL-60 cells.J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 776-788PubMed Google Scholar). When LTC4S was cloned and sequenced, two putative PKC consensus sites (Ser-Ala-Arg) were found at positions 28 and 111 but were not investigated experimentally (17Lam B.K. Penrose J.F. Freeman G.J. Austen K.F. Expression cloning of a cDNA for human leukotriene C4 synthase, an integral membrane protein conjugating reduced glutathione to leukotriene A4.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 7663-7667Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In a recent study, it was demonstrated that a ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6k) is responsible for the observed phosphoregulation of LTC4S in monocytes (18Esser J. Gehrmann U. Salvado M.D. Wetterholm A. Haeggström J.Z. Samuelsson B. Gabrielsson S. Scheynius A. Rådmark O. Zymosan suppresses leukotriene C4 synthase activity in differentiating monocytes: antagonism by aspirin and protein kinase inhibitors.FASEB J. 2011; 25: 1417-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The aim of our study was to identify the site(s) on LTC4S that is phosphorylated by p70S6k and investigate the molecular mechanism for suppression of enzyme activity. We identified the sites with an in vitro phosphorylation assay, autoradiography, and mass spectrometry. The effects of phosphorylation on enzyme activity and kinetic properties were investigated using LTC4S with phosphorylation-mimicking mutations. To obtain a mechanistic explanation for our experimental results, we analyzed phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of LTC4S by comparative molecular dynamics (MD) and determined the crystal structure of the phosphomimetic S36E mutant. Protein phosphorylation constitutes an essential part of the regulation of almost every aspect of cellular function (19Cohen P. The origins of protein phosphorylation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E127-E130Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). It has previously been shown that LTC4S is also regulated by phosphorylation, and p70S6k was found to be one of the key players in this process (10Ali A. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Nicholson D.W. Activation of protein kinase C down-regulates leukotriene C4 synthase activity and attenuates cysteinyl leukotriene production in an eosinophilic substrain of HL-60 cells.J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 776-788PubMed Google Scholar, 18Esser J. Gehrmann U. Salvado M.D. Wetterholm A. Haeggström J.Z. Samuelsson B. Gabrielsson S. Scheynius A. Rådmark O. Zymosan suppresses leukotriene C4 synthase activity in differentiating monocytes: antagonism by aspirin and protein kinase inhibitors.FASEB J. 2011; 25: 1417-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The p70S6k is a serine/threonine-specific kinase localized both in the cytosol and nucleus (20Fleckenstein D.S. Dirks W.G. Drexler H.G. Quentmeier H. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 4 is a new binding partner for the p70S6 serine/threonine kinase.Leuk. Res. 2003; 27: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the predominant p70S6k phosphorylation site on LTC4S is Ser36. Initially, we used an online phosphorylation prediction tool, NetPhos 2.0 Server, to identify the potential phosphorylation site(s) based on sequence information using an artificial neural network method (21Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. Sequence and structure-based prediction of eukaryotic protein phosphorylation sites.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2514) Google Scholar). The prediction identified six Ser, two Thr, and one Tyr residue (Fig. 1A). The major inclusion criteria for further characterization of individual residues were their predictive score and location in the structure. Thus, Ser28 and Ser36 had the highest probability scores of 0.810 and 0.987, respectively, whereas serine residues at positions 23, 57, 100, and 111 exhibited very low probability scores ranging from 0.002 to 0.159. Because Ser23, Ser28, Ser57, Tyr97, and Ser111 are located within the membrane lipid bilayer (Fig. 1, B and C) with poor accessibility for kinases, we reasoned that the probability that these residues will be phosphorylated is very low. It is common that phosphorylation sites on membrane proteins are located in extramembrane loop regions as in human cardiac Na+ channel Nav1.5 (22Marionneau C. Abriel H. Regulation of the cardiac Na+ channel NaV1.5 by post-translational modifications.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2015; 82: 36-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In LTC4S, Ser36 is located in a loop region, and Ser100 is found just above the membrane-spanning region within the active site (Fig. 1C). The server also predicted two neighboring Thr residues at positions 40 and 41 with relatively high probability scores and located in the same loop as Ser36 but with their side chains pointing toward the LTC4S trimer interface (Fig. 1C). It should also be noted that a serine/threonine-specific kinase was used for this study, and the relative abundance of the phosphorylated form of Ser, Thr, and Tyr has been reported as a ratio of 1800:200:1 in vertebrate cells (23Mann M. Ong S.E. Grønborg M. Steen H. Jensen O.N. Pandey A. Analysis of protein phosphorylation using mass spectrometry: deciphering the phosphoproteome.Trends Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 261-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Hence, four of nine predicted residues were selected for further analysis, viz. Ser36, Ser100, Thr40, and Thr41. To identify the phosphorylation sites, in vitro phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The MS analyses of LTC4S achieved up to 32% sequence coverage. The peptides containing Ser36, Thr40, Thr41, and Ser111 could be identified in WT and S36A samples. The peptide covering Ser28, 3DEVALLAAVTLLGVLLQAYFSLQVISAR30, was most likely too large and hydrophobic, whereas the peptide covering Ser100, 100SAQLR104, was too short and hydrophilic. The peptides covering Ser36, Thr40, and Thr41, 35VpSPPLTTGPPEFER48 and 32AFRVpSPPLTTGPPEFER48 where pS is phosphoserine, were repeatedly found to be phosphorylated. Only singly phosphorylated peptides were detected. In all but two cases, the peptides were phosphorylated at Ser36, and in the other two cases, peptides were phosphorylated at Thr40 (Fig. 2), suggesting that Ser36 is the predominant phosphorylation site. No evidence was found for phosphorylation of Thr41 (supplemental Fig. S1). To increase the chance of identifying phosphorylation at Ser100, two mutants were used in which the tryptic cleavage site immediately prior to or immediately after the Ser100 had been mutated. The R99H was specifically generated for this study, whereas the mutation R104A was published previously (24Rinaldo-Matthis A. Wetterholm A. Martinez Molina D. Holm J. Niegowski D. Ohlson E. Nordlund P. Morgenstern R. Haeggström J.Z. Arginine 104 is a key catalytic residue in leukotriene C4 synthase.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 40771-40776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). MS analyses identified 93YFQGYAHSAQLR104 and 100SAQLALAPLYASAR113 but only as the non-phosphorylated peptides. Hence, we could not find any mass spectrometric evidence for phosphorylation of Ser100. It has been shown previously that LTC4S can be phosphorylated in vitro and analyzed by autoradiography. A recombinant p70S6k was used for the in vitro phosphorylation assay as described (18Esser J. Gehrmann U. Salvado M.D. Wetterholm A. Haeggström J.Z. Samuelsson B. Gabrielsson S. Scheynius A. Rådmark O. Zymosan suppresses leukotriene C4 synthase activity in differentiating monocytes: antagonism by aspirin and protein kinase inhibitors.FASEB J. 2011; 25: 1417-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). WT LTC4S was incubated with p70S6k in the presence of radioactive [γ-32P]ATP in a reaction mixture as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The phosphorylation of LTC4S was found to be detergent-specific. Enzyme purified with Triton X-100 as a detergent displayed a radioactive band with an Mr of about 18,000, corresponding to phosphorylated LTC4S, whereas protein purified with the detergent n-dodecyl β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM) was not phosphorylated as judged by the faint radioactive band in the autoradiography (Fig. 3). In the crystal structure of LTC4S, a DDM molecule is bound in an intermonomeric, hydrophobic crevice believed to accommodate the substrate LTA4 (Protein Data Bank code 2UUH; Fig. 1C). Thus, a possible explanation for the prevention of phosphorylation by DDM could be that the detergent molecule blocks the access of the kinases to the phosphorylation site(s). Based on the identification of Ser36 as a phosphorylation site in LTC4S, we generated the mutant S36A and incubated it with p70S6k in the presence of radioactive [γ-32P]ATP as with WT LTC4S. However, the results from autoradiography were not consistent and did not provide conclusive evidence to show that S36A mutant was not phosphorylated (data not shown). Thus, a radioactive band was consistently observed that could be due to the presence of an additional site(s), possibly Thr40, as indicated by MS analysis. We next investigated the functional consequences of phosphorylation at Ser36 by replacing this residue with a Glu (S36E), a common mimic of phosphoserine (25McSorley T. Ort S. Hazra S. Lavie A. Konrad M. Mimicking phosphorylation of Ser-74 on human deoxycytidine kinase selectively increases catalytic activity for dC and dC analogues.FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The effects of mutation on LTC4S activity and kinetic parameters with its physiological substrates LTA4 and GSH were assessed. Likewise, the mutant T40E was constructed and functionally characterized. The specific activity of S36E LTC4S was reduced by nearly 80% (20 μmol/min/mg) as compared with WT LTC4S (95 μmol/min/mg), whereas for the T40E mutant (67 μmol/min/mg), the activity was reduced by 30% (Fig. 4A). The loss of activity of S36E agrees well with the previous observations of down-regulation of LTC4S activity by protein kinases (10Ali A. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Nicholson D.W. Activation of protein kinase C down-regulates leukotriene C4 synthase activity and attenuates cysteinyl leukotriene production in an eosinophilic substrain of HL-60 cells.J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 776-788PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gupta N. Nicholson D.W. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Demonstration of cell-specific phosphorylation of LTC4 synthase.FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The steady-state kinetic parameters were determined for S36E and T40E mutants using LTA4 as a substrate to test the effects on substrate binding and catalytic efficiencies (Table 1 and Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the catalytic constants kcatLTA4 and KmLTA4 could not be determined for S36E mutant as the formation of LTC4 increased linearly with increasing concentrations of LTA4, indicating that substrate binding is very weak in this mutant. The apparent second order rate constant, kcat/KmLTA4, which is the effective rate of substrate binding converted to product, was determined as 1.3 × 105 m−1 s−1, which is less than 10% of the efficiency displayed by WT LTC4S. In contrast, the catalytic properties of T40E were not changed significantly compared with WT enzyme. Thus, the catalytic turnover at saturating substrate concentration, kcatLTA4, observed for WT and T40E LTC4S was 105 and 62 s−1, respectively, whereas KmLTA4 remained in the same range for WT (76 μm) and T40E (85 μm). Therefore, WT and T40E enzyme displayed catalytic efficiencies, i.e. kcat/KmLTA4, of 13.9 × 105 and 7.7 × 105 m−1 s−1, respectively. Together, these data suggest that the active site architecture and enzyme-LTA4 interactions have been affected due to the introduction of a negative charge at position 36.TABLE 1Steady-state kinetic parameters for phosphomimetic mutants of LTC4SEnzymeKmkcatkcat/KmGSHLTA4GSHLTA4GSHLTA4μms−1m−1 s−1WT70 ± 1876 ± 1819 ± 1.0105 ± 14(2.7 ± 0.6) × 105(13.9 ± 1.5) × 105T40E220 ± 7485 ± 4412 ± 1.162 ± 18(0.5 ± 0.1) × 105(7.7 ± 2.0) × 105S36E120 ± 20–a–, could not be obtained.3 ± 0.1–a–, could not be obtained.(0.26 ± 0.03) × 105(1.3 ± 0.03) × 105a –, could not be obtained. Open table in a new tab The kinetic parameters for the peptide substrate GSH were similar to those of LTA4 (Table 1). The turnover rate by S36E (kcatGSH) was reduced by 85% (3 ± 0.1 s−1) compared with WT enzyme (19.0 ± 1.0 s−1). The latter value is lower than kcatLTA4 due to the lower solubility and stability of LTA4 compared with that of GSH. The values of KmGSH for S36E and T40E were a bit higher (120 and 220 μm, respectively) compared with WT enzyme (70 μm) (Table 1). For T40E, the 3-fold increase in KmGSH may be explained by the results of MD simulations (see below). We performed 100-ns molecular dynamics simulations, with snapshots taken every nanosecond, of LTC4S embedded in a lipid bilayer with and without phosphorylation at Ser36 (Ser(P)36). Analysis of the simulation snapshots indicated that the simulated systems generally appeared stable with energies and root mean square deviation values stabilizing after ∼5 ns of simulation time (supplemental Fig. S2). The largest movements observed were in terminal regions distant from the site of phosphorylation and active site residues and were thus of limited functional relevance. To identify functionally relevant changes in the motions of LTC4S upon phosphorylation, the dynamic cross-correlation matrix for each simulation was derived (26Ichiye T. Karplus M. Collective motions in proteins: a covariance analysis of atomic fluctuations in molecular dynamics and normal mode simulations.Proteins. 1991; 11: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). To highlight phosphorylation-related differences in correlated movements, the dynamic cross-correlation matrix of native LTC4S was subtracted from the dynamic cross-correlation matrix of phosphorylated LTC4S and plotted as a heat map (supplemental Fig. S3). Two regions stood out in this map: the intersection between the first luminal loop (Arg34–Pro43, including the phosphorylation site) and residues located around the second luminal loop (Ala89–Ala110, including the end of helix 3 and beginning of helix 4) of the neighboring subunit and the intersection between the first luminal loop and residues in the beginning of helix 2 (Pro43–Phe60, i.e. right after the first luminal loop) of the neighboring subunit. The obvious explanation for the changes highlighted by the dynamic cross-correlation matrix analysis is that phosphorylation of Ser36 will pull this region toward spatially neighboring residues that provide complementary binding partners. Not all three subunits of LTC4S behaved exactly the same in this aspect, and the cross-subunit contacts were different for the three interfaces. This could be a real difference or just an effect of the limited time span (100 ns) of the simulation, but it is possible that a longer time course would equilibrate all structures at a more uniform state. A detailed analysis of all simulation snapshots was performed to identify hydrogen bond (H-bond) partners of Ser36/Ser(P)36 throughout the simulation time course (supplemental Table S2). The most striking interactions were the H-bonds formed between Ser(P)36 and Arg104 (Fig. 5) that were present in 15–88% (depending on subunit interface) of all snapshots, which should be compared with <0.4% in the unphosphorylated model (Table 2). This implies a high probability for formation of H-bonds between these residues upon phosphorylation. Importantly, Arg104 is the key catalytic residue responsible for formation of the GSH thiolate anion (24Rinaldo-Matthis A. Wetterholm A. Martinez Molina D. Holm J. Niegowski D. Ohlson E. Nordlund P. Morgenstern R. Haeggström J.Z. Arginine 104 is a key catalytic residue in leukotriene C4 synthase.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 40771-40776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation led to an increased frequency of H-bonding with Arg34 in the same subunit. However, because Ser36 and Arg34 are very close (both spatially and in the primary sequence), this interaction is not likely to have significant functional effects. In addition, Arg34 is not known to be important for catalysis or substrate binding.TABLE 2Probability of hydrogen bond formation between Ser36/Ser(P)36 and Arg104 at the three-subunit interfaces during 100 ns of MDInterfaceProbability of H-bond between Ser36/Ser(P)36 and Arg104LTC4S + GSH[Ser(P)36]LTC4S + GSH%A-B0.187.7B-C0.417.1C-A014.5 Open table in a new tab Molecular dynamic simulation was also performed with a phosphorylated Thr40 (Thr(P)40) of LTC4S, which revealed a markedly pronounced interaction between Thr(P)40 and Arg51 of the neighboring subunit (data not shown). Arg51 is an anchoring residue for the carboxyl group of the GSH (27Rinaldo-Matthis A. Ahmad S. Wetterholm A. Lachmann P. Morgenstern R. Haeggström J.Z. Pre-steady-state kinetic characterization of thiolate anion formation in human leukotriene C4 synthase.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 848-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and was found to be not essential for catalysis (24Rinaldo-Matthis A.

A crystal structure of the mutant S36E was determined at 3-Å resolution (Protein Data Bank code 5HV9; supplemental Table S3), which indicates that the mutant was correctly folded and that the loss of activity is not due to the misfolded protein. The overall structure was similar to native LTC4S (Protein Data Bank code 2UUI) with one monomer in the asymmetric unit. Nine residues (Met−5 to Glu4) and three residues (Pro148 to Ala150) were removed in the present structure at the N and C termini, respectively, because of the lack of density. Strong positive density was observed for the thiol group of GSH in the Fo − Fc difference map at 3σ after initial refinement. Contouring Fo − Fc map to 2.5 σ resulted in a positive curved density representing GSH at the active site. The GSH molecule was fitted, and complete density was achieved at 1σ of 2Fo − Fc map. A minor positional shift for the thiol group of GSH accompanied by an increased distance (0.7 Å) to Arg104 was observed at the active site (Fig. 6) compared with the structure of WT LTC4S with bound GSH (Protein Data Bank code 2UUH), which corroborates the results of MD simulations and provides a structural basis for the"
https://openalex.org/W2466521354,"Despite the popularity of the notion that social cohesion in the form of dense social networks promotes cooperation in Prisoner's Dilemmas through reputation, very little experimental evidence for this claim exists. We address this issue by testing hypotheses from one of the few rigorous game-theoretic models on this topic, the Raub & Weesie model, in two incentivized lab experiments. In the experiments, 156 subjects played repeated two-person PDs in groups of six. In the ""atomized interactions"" condition, subjects were only informed about the outcomes of their own interactions, while in the ""embedded"" condition, subjects were informed about the outcomes of all interactions in their group, allowing for reputation effects. The design of the experiments followed the specification of the RW model as closely as possible. For those aspects of the model that had to be modified to allow practical implementation in an experiment, we present additional analyses that show that these modifications do not affect the predictions. Contrary to expectations, we do not find that cooperation is higher in the embedded condition than in the atomized interaction. Instead, our results are consistent with an interpretation of the RW model that includes random noise, or with learning models of cooperation in networks."
https://openalex.org/W2475364383,"The embryonic brain is one of the tissues most vulnerable to ionizing radiation. In this study, we showed that ionizing radiation induces apoptosis in the neural progenitors of the mouse cerebral cortex, and that the surviving progenitor cells subsequently develop a considerable amount of supernumerary centrosomes. When mouse embryos at Day 13.5 were exposed to γ-rays, brains sizes were reduced markedly in a dose-dependent manner, and these size reductions persisted until birth. Immunostaining with caspase-3 antibodies showed that apoptosis occurred in 35% and 40% of neural progenitor cells at 4 h after exposure to 1 and 2 Gy, respectively, and this was accompanied by a disruption of the apical layer in which mitotic spindles were positioned in unirradiated mice. At 24 h after 1 Gy irradiation, the apoptotic cells were completely eliminated and proliferation was restored to a level similar to that of unirradiated cells, but numerous spindles were localized outside the apical layer. Similarly, abnormal cytokinesis, which included multipolar division and centrosome clustering, was observed in 19% and 24% of the surviving neural progenitor cells at 48 h after irradiation with 1 and 2 Gy, respectively. Because these cytokinesis aberrations derived from excess centrosomes result in growth delay and mitotic catastrophe-mediated cell elimination, our findings suggest that, in addition to apoptosis at an early stage of radiation exposure, radiation-induced centrosome overduplication could contribute to the depletion of neural progenitors and thereby lead to microcephaly."

Results Pad2 and Pad4 are the main Pad isoforms expressed in mature medullary thymic epithelial cells of the mouse and their levels of expression are comparable to that of insulin (Ins2), another highly and promiscuously expressed protein in the thymus. Citrullination was detected in medullary thymic epithelial cells as shown by Western Blot and immunofluorescence. Conclusions Even though we here show that the murine thymus harbors the prerequisites for central tolerance to PAD and citrullinated peptides, it remains an open question whether the emergence of peptidylcitrulline-specific T cells and of autoantibodies recognizing citrullinated epitopes is caused by a failure of central or peripheral tolerance mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2475302088,"Warm temperature during post-heading is generally hypothesized to be the critical factor limiting grain yield of early-rice in South China. However, there is no direct evidence to confirm this hypothesis in the field. This study was conducted to determine the temperature-related yield constraints of early-rice in South China. Field experiments were carried out in Huaiji (a location in South China) and Changsha (a location in the Yangtze River basin) in 2011-2013. In each year, two rice cultivars were grown in early-rice growing season in Huaiji and in single-rice growing season in Changsha. Huaiji had higher average daily maximum temperature during post-heading than Changsha. The higher temperature during post-heading induced early plant senescence (slower crop growth rate and shorter grain filling duration), but grain weight did not reduce because it was compensated for by increased translocation of pre-heading biomass. The higher temperature during post-heading also did not cause a reduction in grain filling percentage. Huaiji had lower temperature during pre-heading than Changsha, which to some extent resulted in slower crop growth rate and consequently lower biomass production and smaller sink size in Huaiji than in Changsha. As a result, grain yield was about 30% lower in Huaiji than in Changsha. Our results indicate that grain yield of early-rice in South China is limited not by warm temperature during post-heading but partially by cool temperature during pre-heading, and suggest that enhancing sink size and meanwhile maintaining good translocation of pre-heading biomass may be an effective way to achieve high yield for early-rice in South China."
https://openalex.org/W2460567163,"Myocardial infarction (MI) is a serious heart disease and a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Although some molecules (genes, miRNAs and transcription factors (TFs)) associated with MI have been studied in a specific pathological context, their dynamic characteristics in gene expressions, biological functions and regulatory interactions in MI progression have not been fully elucidated to date. In the current study, we analyzed time-series RNA expression data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We observed that significantly differentially expressed genes were sharply up- or down-regulated in the acute phase of MI, and then changed slowly until the chronic phase. Biological functions involved at each stage of MI were identified. Additionally, dynamic miRNA–TF co-regulatory networks were constructed based on the significantly differentially expressed genes and miRNA–TF co-regulatory motifs, and the dynamic interplay of miRNAs, TFs and target genes were investigated. Finally, a new panel of candidate diagnostic biomarkers (STAT3 and ICAM1) was identified to have discriminatory capability for patients with or without MI, especially the patients with or without recurrent events. The results of the present study not only shed new light on the understanding underlying regulatory mechanisms involved in MI progression, but also contribute to the discovery of true diagnostic biomarkers for MI."
https://openalex.org/W2466867992,"Diatoms (Bacilliariophyceae) encode two light-dependent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductases (POR1 and POR2) that catalyze the penultimate step of chlorophyll biosynthesis in the light. Algae live in dynamic environments whose changing light levels induce photoacclimative metabolic shifts, including altered cellular chlorophyll levels. We hypothesized that the two POR proteins may be differentially adaptive under varying light conditions. Using the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum as a test system, differences in POR protein abundance and por gene expression were examined when this organism was grown on an alternating light:dark cycles at different irradiances; exposed to continuous light; and challenged by a significant decrease in light availability.For cultures maintained on a 12h light: 12h dark photoperiod at 200μE m-2 s-1 (200L/D), both por genes were up-regulated during the light and down-regulated in the dark, though por1 transcript abundance rose and fell earlier than that of por2. Little concordance occurred between por1 mRNA and POR1 protein abundance. In contrast, por2 mRNA and POR2 protein abundances followed similar diurnal patterns. When 200L/D P. tricornutum cultures were transferred to continuous light (200L/L), the diurnal regulatory pattern of por1 mRNA abundance but not of por2 was disrupted, and POR1 but not POR2 protein abundance dropped steeply. Under 1200μE m-2 s-1 (1200L/D), both por1 mRNA and POR1 protein abundance displayed diurnal oscillations. A compromised diel por2 mRNA response under 1200L/D did not impact the oscillation in POR2 abundance. When cells grown at 1200L/D were then shifted to 50μE m-2 s-1 (50L/D), por1 and por2 mRNA levels decreased swiftly but briefly upon light reduction. Thereafter, POR1 but not POR2 protein levels rose significantly in response to this light stepdown.Given the sensitivity of diatom por1/POR1 to real-time light cues and adherence of por2/POR2 regulation to the diurnal cycle, we suggest that POR1 supports photoacclimation, whereas POR2 is the workhorse for daily chlorophyll synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2471061342,"Five decades after the United States first enacted the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Congress has voted to make the first major reforms to the statute since 2007. President Lyndon Johnson signed the first FOIA on 4 July 1966, enshrining in law the public's right to access to information from executive branch government agencies. Scientists and others around the world can use the FOIA to learn what the U.S. government has done in its policies and practices. Proposed reforms should be a net benefit to public understanding of the scientific process and knowledge, by increasing the access of scientists to archival materials and reducing the likelihood of science and scientists being suppressed by official secrecy or bureaucracy."
