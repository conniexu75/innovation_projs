https://openalex.org/W2946944377,"Sustainable agriculture is an important global issue. The use of organic fertilizers can enhance crop yield and soil properties while restraining pests and diseases. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of long-term use of chemical and organic fertilizers on tea and rhizosphere soil properties in tea orchards. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and high-throughput sequencing technology analyses were used to investigate heavy metals content and bacterial composition in rhizosphere soils. Our results indicated that organic fertilizer treatment significantly decreased Cu, Pb and Cd contents in rhizosphere soil sample. The results also showed that treatment with organic fertilizer significantly decreased the contents of Cd, Pb and As in tea leaves. Furthermore, organic fertilizer significantly increased the amino acids content of tea and the pH of the soil. The use of organic fertilizer significantly increased in the relative abundance of Burkholderiales, Myxococcales, Streptomycetales, Nitrospirales, Ktedonobacterales, Acidobacteriales, Gemmatimonadales, and Solibacterales, and decreased the abundance of Pseudonocardiales, Frankiales, Rhizobiales, and Xanthomonadales. In conclusion, organic fertilizer can help to shape the microbial composition and recruit beneficial bacteria into the rhizosphere of tea, leading to improved tea quality and reduced heavy metals content in rhizosphere soil and tea leaves."
https://openalex.org/W2947372214,"Background The exponential decrease in molecular sequencing cost generates unprecedented amounts of data. Hence, scalable methods to analyze these data are required. Phylogenetic (or Evolutionary) Placement methods identify the evolutionary provenance of anonymous sequences with respect to a given reference phylogeny. This increasingly popular method is deployed for scrutinizing metagenomic samples from environments such as water, soil, or the human gut. Novel methods Here, we present novel and, more importantly, highly scalable methods for analyzing phylogenetic placements of metagenomic samples. More specifically, we introduce methods for (a) visualizing differences between samples and their correlation with associated meta-data on the reference phylogeny, (b) clustering similar samples using a variant of the k-means method, and (c) finding phylogenetic factors using an adaptation of the Phylofactorization method. These methods enable to interpret metagenomic data in a phylogenetic context, to find patterns in the data, and to identify branches of the phylogeny that are driving these patterns. Results To demonstrate the scalability and utility of our methods, as well as to provide exemplary interpretations of our methods, we applied them to 3 publicly available datasets comprising 9782 samples with a total of approximately 168 million sequences. The results indicate that new biological insights can be attained via our methods."
https://openalex.org/W2947079588,"The recent emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria requires the development of new antibiotics or new agents capable of enhancing antibiotic activity. This study evaluated the antibacterial activity of lysozyme-chitosan oligosaccharide conjugates (LYZOX) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which should resolve the problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Bactericidal tests showed that LYZOX killed 50% more P. aeruginosa (NBRC 13275), A. baumannii and MRSA than the control treatment after 60 min. In addition, LYZOX was shown to inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa (NBRC 13275 and PAO1), A. baumannii and MRSA better than its components. To elucidate the antibacterial mechanism of LYZOX, we performed cell membrane integrity assays, N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine assays, 2-nitrophenyl β-D-galactopyranoside assays and confocal laser scanning microscopy. These results showed that LYZOX affected bacterial cell walls and increased the permeability of the outer membrane and the plasma membrane. Furthermore, each type of bacteria treated with LYZOX was observed by electron microscopy. Electron micrographs revealed that these bacteria had the morphological features of both lysozyme-treated and chitosan oligosaccharide-treated bacteria and that LYZOX destroyed bacterial cell walls, which caused the release of intracellular contents from cells. An acquired drug resistance test revealed that these bacteria were not able to acquire resistance to LYZOX. The hemolytic toxicity test demonstrated the low hemolytic activity of LYZOX. In conclusion, LYZOX exhibited antibacterial activity and low drug resistance in the presence of P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii and MRSA and showed low hemolytic toxicity. LYZOX affected bacterial membranes, leading to membrane disruption and the release of intracellular contents and consequent bacterial cell death. LYZOX may serve as a novel candidate drug that could be used for the control of refractory infections."

Senescent cells contribute to both age-related degeneration and hyperplastic pathologies, including cancer. In culture, normal human epithelial cells enter senescence after a limited number of cell divisions, known as replicative senescence. Here, to investigate how metabolic pathways regulate replicative senescence, we used LC-MS–based metabolomics to analyze senescent primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). We did not observe significant changes in glucose uptake or lactate secretion in senescent HMECs. However, analysis of intracellular metabolite pool sizes indicated that senescent cells exhibit depletion of metabolites from nucleotide synthesis pathways. Furthermore, stable isotope tracing with 13C-labeled glucose or glutamine revealed a dramatic blockage of flux of these two metabolites into nucleotide synthesis pathways in senescent HMECs. To test whether cellular immortalization would reverse these observations, we expressed telomerase in HMECs. In addition to preventing senescence, telomerase expression maintained metabolic flux from glucose into nucleotide synthesis pathways. Finally, we investigated whether inhibition of nucleotide synthesis in proliferating HMECs is sufficient to induce senescence. In proliferating HMECs, both pharmacological and genetic inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2 (RRM2), a rate-limiting enzyme in dNTP synthesis, induced premature senescence with concomitantly decreased metabolic flux from glucose into nucleotide synthesis. Taken together, our results suggest that nucleotide synthesis inhibition plays a causative role in the establishment of replicative senescence in HMECs.

Cellular senescence is an irreversible growth arrest that occurs in response to a variety of cellular stresses including DNA damage, oncogenic signaling, and oxidative stress (1.Campisi J.

In culture, replicative senescence occurs in normal cells after a limited number of population doublings, the so-called Hayflick limit (5.Hayflick L. The limited in vitro lifetime of human diploid cell strains.Exp. Cell Res. 1965; 37 (14315085): 614-63610.1016/0014-4827(65)90211-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (4271) Google Scholar).

In addition to its role in aging and tumor suppression, senescent cells can contribute to hyperplastic pathologies including cancer through secretion of numerous pro-inflammatory signals (i.e. senescence-associated secretory phenotype) (10.Coppé J.-P.

Although senescent cells are permanently arrested, they are highly metabolically active and demonstrate significant metabolic differences compared with proliferating, nonsenescent cells (11.Wiley C.D.

Studies of human fibroblasts in culture have shown that replicative senescence is accompanied by increased glycolysis (12.Bittles A.H. Harper N.

Alterations in mitochondrial function can also induce senescence through 5′ AMP-activated protein kinase– and p53–dependent pathways (17.Moiseeva O. Bourdeau V. Roux A. Deschênes-Simard X.

Importantly, it has also been demonstrated that metabolic genes, including phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and malic enzymes, can regulate entry into and escape from senescence (8.Kaplon J.

Therefore, identifying the mechanisms by which metabolism regulates senescence is essential to understanding the senescence program during aging and tumor suppression.

Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2013: 323-361Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Stasis is a retinoblastoma-mediated growth arrest that occurs in the absence of DNA damage and is independent of p53 (22.Garbe J.C. Bhattacharya S. Merchant B. Bassett E. Swisshelm K. Feiler H.S. Wyrobek A.J. Stampfer M.R.

Agonescence, or telomere dysfunction-associated senescence, is driven by critically shortened telomeres that trigger both a p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and a DNA damage response (23.Garbe J.C. Holst C.R. Bassett E. Tlsty T. Stampfer M.R. Inactivation of p53 function in cultured human mammary epithelial cells turns the telomere-length dependent senescence barrier from agonescence into crisis.Cell Cycle. 2007; 6 (17671422): 1927-193610.4161/cc.6.15.4519Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24.Romanov S.R.

Because properties associated with senescence in mesenchymal cell types such as fibroblasts may not accurately reflect senescence in epithelial cells (22.Garbe J.C. Bhattacharya S. Merchant B. Bassett E. Swisshelm K. Feiler H.S. Wyrobek A.J. Stampfer M.R.

How these senescence barriers are regulated by cellular metabolism in this primary cell type has not been investigated previously. human mammary epithelial cell CRISPR-dCas9 interference 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine false discovery rate gene set expression analysis population doubling(s) ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2 senescence-associated β-galactosidase human telomerase senescence-associated heterochromatic foci tricarboxylic acid phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate numerical aperture plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Here, we report that replicative senescence in primary HMECs is accompanied by a dramatic inhibition of nucleotide synthesis, including reduced flux of both glucose- and glutamine-derived carbon into nucleotide synthesis pathways. Expression of human telomerase (hTERT) in HMECs both induced immortalization and maintained flux into nucleotide synthesis. In addition, treatment of proliferating HMECs with an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2 (RRM2), a key enzyme in dNTP biosynthesis, induced senescence and recapitulated the metabolomic state of replicative senescence. Taken together, our results indicate that nucleotide metabolism is a key regulator of replicative senescence in HMECs. To study the metabolic alterations that accompany replicative senescence, we used normal diploid HMECs. These cells have been shown previously to accurately represent the molecular changes that occur during replicative senescence in vivo (21.Stampfer M.R. LaBarge M.A. Garbe J.C. An integrated human mammary epithelial cell culture system for studying carcinogenesis and aging.in: Cell and Molecular Biology of Breast Cancer. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2013: 323-361Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We observed linear growth for ∼15 population doublings (PD), after which cell growth slowed until cells ceased proliferation at ∼40 PD (Fig. 1A). HMECs at ∼40 PD were viable and showed little to no cell death (Fig. 1B). However, these cells showed an enlarged, flattened, and irregular morphology that is typical of senescent cells (25.Chen Q.M. Tu V.C. Catania J. Burton M. Toussaint O. Dilley T. Involvement of Rb family proteins, focal adhesion proteins and protein synthesis in senescent morphogenesis induced by hydrogen peroxide.J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113 (11058095): 4087-4097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). To confirm that HMECs at ∼40 PD were senescent, we first measured senescence-associated β-gal (SA-β-gal) activity using C12FDG, a fluorogenic substrate for SA-β-gal activity in live cells (26.Debacq-Chainiaux F. Erusalimsky J.D. Campisi J. Toussaint O. Protocols to detect senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-βgal) activity, a biomarker of senescent cells in culture and in vivo.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4 (20010931): 1798-180610.1038/nprot.2009.191Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar), and observed increased SA-β-gal activity at PD 40 (Fig. 1D). Next, we confirmed that senescent HMECs exhibited a lack of DNA synthesis by measuring incorporation of the thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) (Fig. 1E). Notably, Hoechst staining revealed that senescent HMECs did not exhibit senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF), a frequent but not obligatory marker of senescence (27.Kosar M. Bartkova J. Hubackova S. Hodny Z. Lukas J. Bartek J. Senescence-associated heterochromatin foci are dispensable for cellular senescence, occur in a cell type- and insult-dependent manner and follow expression of p16(ink4a).Cell Cycle. 2011; 10 (21248468): 457-46810.4161/cc.10.3.14707Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, we observed that a significant fraction of senescent HMECs were multinuclear (Fig. 1F and Fig. S1), which has been observed in senescent human melanocyte systems (28.Leikam C. Hufnagel A.L.

Next, we tested for expression of the senescence markers p16 and p21. Western blotting revealed that senescent HMECs exhibited increased expression of p21 but not p16 (Fig. 1G). Because SAHF formation is driven by p16 but not p21, this observation is consistent with our finding that senescent HMECs do not exhibit SAHF (27.Kosar M. Bartkova J. Hubackova S. Hodny Z. Lukas J.

Finally, to investigate whether senescent HMECs experienced DNA damage, we tested for expression of the DNA damage marker γ-H2AX by Western blotting. Interestingly, expression of γ-H2AX was slightly decreased as cells entered senescence (Fig. 1H), suggesting that senescent HMECs do not exhibit dsDNA breaks (22.Garbe J.C. Bhattacharya S.

First, we measured the consumption and secretion rates of glucose and lactate, respectively (Fig. 2A and Table S1). Neither glucose consumption, lactate secretion, nor the ratio of glucose consumption to lactate secretion was significantly altered, suggesting that senescent HMECs do not exhibit an overall glycolytic shift. Because senescent fibroblasts increase secretion of citrate (13.James E.L. Michalek R.D. Pitiyage G.N. de Castro A.M. Vignola K.S. Jones J. Mohney R.P. Karoly E.D. Prime S.S. Parkinson E.K. Senescent human fibroblasts show increased glycolysis and redox homeostasis with extracellular metabolomes that overlap with those of irreparable DNA damage, aging, and disease.J. Proteome Res. 2015; 14 (25690941): 1854-187110.1021/pr501221gCrossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we next examined the secretion of TCA cycle metabolites. Senescent HMECs exhibited decreased secretion of most TCA cycle metabolites, although only aconitate and malate demonstrated significant reductions (Fig. S2A). Finally, we examined the consumption and secretion of amino acids in proliferating and senescent cells. Although consumption and secretion of many amino acids was reduced in senescent HMECs, only aspartate secretion was significantly reduced compared with proliferating HMECs (Fig. S2B). Notably, glutamine consumption, a significant carbon source for the TCA cycle, was not significantly reduced. Taken together, these data demonstrate that senescent HMECs are highly metabolically active, without significant changes in glycolytic ratio or in exchange of TCA cycle intermediates and amino acids with the extracellular medium. Next, we quantified the intracellular metabolite pool sizes in both proliferating and senescent HMECs. In five independent experiments, we measured 111 metabolites in at least two independent experiments (Table S2). Of the measured metabolites, 11 were significantly increased and 31 were significantly decreased in senescent cells (false discovery rate–corrected p value < 0.01). Notably, we did not observe significant change in the AMP/ATP ratio of senescent HMECs (Fig. S2C), in contrast to previous findings in senescent human fibroblasts (14.Zwerschke W. Mazurek S. Stöckl P. Hütter E. Eigenbrodt E. Jansen-Dürr P. Metabolic analysis of senescent human fibroblasts reveals a role for AMP in cellular senescence.Biochem.

Visualization of these data on a volcano plot revealed that several deoxyribonucleoside di- and triphosphates (dNDPs and dNTPs), including dCDP, dTDP, dADP, dATP, and dUTP, were significantly down-regulated in senescent cells (Fig. 2, B and C). Conversely, intracellular levels of guanine and uridine were significantly up-regulated. Increased intracellular levels of uridine were accompanied by increased secretion of uridine and the corresponding nucleobase uracil (Fig. 2D). Visualization of the log2 -fold changes in intracellular pool size on a metabolic pathway map also revealed decreased metabolite pool sizes for most of glycolysis, the TCA cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway, and nucleotide synthesis metabolites (Fig. 2E). Metabolite set enrichment set analysis demonstrated that nucleoside mono-/di-/triphosphates were the most significantly down-regulated metabolic pathway in senescent cells (Fig. S2D). Taken together, these data suggest that replicative senescence in HMECs induces dramatic changes in global metabolism with a particularly strong decrease in nucleotide metabolic pool sizes. Because changes in metabolite pool size do not always accurately reflect changes in metabolic flux (37.Jang C. Chen L. Rabinowitz J.D. Metabolomics and isotope tracing.Cell. 2018; 173 (29727671): 822-83710.1016/j.cell.2018.03.055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), we next analyzed metabolic flux in proliferating and senescent HMECs by stable isotope labeling. We cultured proliferating and senescent HMECs with [U-13C]glucose followed by LC-MS metabolomics. To gain a global picture of the contribution of glucose-derived carbon to intermediary metabolites, we calculated glucose fractional contribution for each metabolite (38.Buescher J.M. Antoniewicz M.R. Boros L.G. Burgess S.C. Brunengraber H. Clish C.B. DeBerardinis R.J. Feron O. Frezza C. Ghesquiere B. Gottlieb E. Hiller K. Jones R.G. Kamphorst J.J.

Plotting the glucose fractional contribution on a volcano plot revealed that metabolites from the pyrimidine synthesis, including UMP, UDP, UTP, dCDP, dCTP, dTDP, and dTTP, showed significantly decreased incorporation of glucose-derived carbon (Fig. 3, A and B). Notably, whereas phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP), one of the precursors for pyrimidine synthesis, demonstrated only a small change in glucose-derived carbon incorporation, UMP and the downstream products of pyrimidine synthesis (e.g. dCDP) exhibited almost complete loss of glucose-derived carbon incorporation (Fig. 3, B and C). Visualization of the [U-13C]glucose fractional incorporation on a metabolic pathway map confirmed that the pyrimidine synthesis pathway demonstrated the largest decrease in glucose fractional incorporation (Fig. 3D). In contrast, metabolites from the TCA cycle showed little to no change in [U-13C]glucose fractional incorporation or isotopomer distributions (Fig. S3). We next used [1,2-13C]glucose to investigate possible alterations in the ratio of glucose that enters the pentose phosphate pathway versus glycolysis (39.Metallo C.M. Walther J.L. Stephanopoulos G. Evaluation of 13C isotopic tracers for metabolic flux analysis in mammalian cells.J.

However, we observed no significant difference in the percentages of M1 and M2 lactate when comparing proliferating and senescent cells (Fig. S4A). There was, however, a significant decrease of 13C incorporation into UMP and downstream pyrimidines, consistent with our observation using U-13C–labeled glucose (Fig. S4 (B and C) and Table S4). Next, we analyzed proliferating and senescent HMECs labeled with [U-13C]glutamine to test for changes in TCA cycle flux. We observed a decreased ratio of reductive to oxidative flux in the TCA cycle for senescent HMECs; however, the -fold change was small (Fig. S4D).

In this study, we evaluated assumptions in the use of a high-throughput, physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model to relate in vitro bioactivity and rat in vivo toxicity data. The fraction unbound in plasma (fup) and intrinsic hepatic clearance (Clint) were measured for rats (for 67 and 77 chemicals, respectively), combined with fup and Clint literature data for 97 chemicals, and incorporated in the PBTK model. Of these chemicals, 84 had corresponding in vitro ToxCast bioactivity data and in vivo toxicity data. For each possible comparison of in vitro and in vivo endpoint, the concordance between the in vivo and in vitro data was evaluated by a regression analysis. For a base set of assumptions, the PBTK results were more frequently better associated than either the results from a ""random"" model parameterization or direct comparison of the ""untransformed"" values of AC50 and dose (performed best in 51%, 28%, and 21% of cases, respectively). We also investigated several assumptions in the application of PBTK for IVIVE, including clearance and internal dose selection. One of the better assumptions sets-restrictive clearance and comparing free in vivo venous plasma concentration with free in vitro concentration-outperformed the random and untransformed results in 71% of the in vitro-in vivo endpoint comparisons. These results demonstrate that applying PBTK improves our ability to observe the association between in vitro bioactivity and in vivo toxicity data in general. This suggests that potency values from in vitro screening should be transformed using in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) to build potentially better machine learning and other statistical models for predicting in vivo toxicity in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2947976521,"Background Pelvic ring injuries in the elderly often occur after low-energy accidents. They may result in prolonged immobilization, complications and an intense rehabilitation process. The aim of this study was to assess mortality, physical functioning and quality of life (QoL) in elderly patients with pelvic ring injuries. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed including all elderly patients (≥ 65 years) admitted for a pelvic ring injury between 2007-2016. Mortality and survival were evaluated and patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) were used to assess physical functioning (SMFA) and QoL (EQ-5D). These were compared to age-matched normative data from the general Dutch population. Results A total of 153 patients, with a mean age of 79 years (SD 8) at the time of injury, were included in this study. The mortality rate was 20% at 30 days, 27% at 1 year and 41% at 3 years of follow-up. All six patients with a type C fracture died within 30 days. Analyses of the 153 patients showed that increasing age, fracture type C and Injury Severity Score (ISS) were all independent risk factors for mortality. Eventually, after excluding patients that died (N = 78) or were unable to contact (N = 2), 73 patients were eligible for follow-up, of which 53 patients (73%) responded. Mean Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA) scores were respectively 67.4 (function index), 65.2 (bother index), 66.5 (lower extremity), 60.4 (activities of daily living) and 68.2 (emotion). Mean EuroQuol-5D (EQ-5D) score was 0.72. Overall, physical functioning and quality of life were significantly decreased in comparison with normative data from the general population. Conclusion Elderly people who sustain a pelvic ring injury should be considered as a fragile population with substantial mortality rates. The patients who survived demonstrated a substantially lower level of physical functioning and quality of life in comparison with their age-matched peers from the general population.

https://openalex.org/W2946927981,"Commercial captive breeding and trade in body parts of threatened wild carnivores is an issue of significant concern to conservation scientists and policy-makers. Following a 2016 decision by Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, South Africa must establish an annual export quota for lion skeletons from captive sources, such that threats to wild lions are mitigated. As input to the quota-setting process, South Africa’s Scientific Authority initiated interdisciplinary collaborative research on the captive lion industry and its potential links to wild lion conservation. A National Captive Lion Survey was conducted as one of the inputs to this research; the survey was launched in August 2017 and completed in May 2018. The structured semi-quantitative questionnaire elicited 117 usable responses, representing a substantial proportion of the industry. The survey results clearly illustrate the impact of a USA suspension on trophy imports from captive-bred South African lions, which affected 82% of respondents and economically destabilised the industry. Respondents are adapting in various ways, with many euthanizing lions and becoming increasingly reliant on income from skeleton export sales. With rising consumer demand for lion body parts, notably skulls, the export quota presents a further challenge to the industry, regulators and conservationists alike, with 52% of respondents indicating they would adapt by seeking ‘alternative markets’ for lion bones if the export quota allocation restricted their business. Recognizing that trade policy toward large carnivores represents a ‘wicked problem’, we anticipate that these results will inform future deliberations, which must nonetheless also be informed by challenging inclusive engagements with all relevant stakeholders."
https://openalex.org/W2947489569,"Metal Tolerance Proteins (MTPs) are the class of membrane proteins involved in the transport of metals, mainly Zn, Mn, Fe, Cd, Co and Ni, and confer metal tolerance in plants. In the present study, a comprehensive molecular analysis of rice MTP genes was performed to understand the evolution, distribution and expression dynamics of MTP genes. Exploration of the whole genome re-sequencing information available for three thousand rice genotypes highlighted the evolution and allelic diversity of MTP genes. Based on the presence of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), MTP1, MTP6, MTP8 and MTP9 were found to be the most conserved genes. Furthermore, results showed localization of MTP1, MTP8.1 and MTP9, and MTP11, respectively with QTLs/m-QTLs for Zn and Cd accumulation, making these genes promising candidates to understand the QTL regulation. Expression profiling of the entire set of 10 MTP genes revealed root and shoot specific expressions of MTP9 and MTP8.1, respectively, under all tested vegetative stages. Expression of seed-specific MTPs increased as seed maturation progressed, which revealed their potential role in transporting metals during seed filling. Upon exposure to harmful heavy metals, expression of most MTP genes decreased in root and increased in shoot, suggests that different mechanisms are being employed by MTPs in different tissues. Contrastingly, only a few MTPs were found to be responsive to Fe and/or Zn starvation conditions. The extensive analysis of MTPs presented here will be helpful in identifying candidate MTP genes for crop biofortification and bioremediation purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2947525266,"Miscarriage occurs in up to one in four pregnancies and can be a devastating event affecting both men and women. Unfortunately, the male partner’s experience of miscarriage is seldom researched, particularly within Australia. This qualitative study involved semi-structured telephone interviews with 10 Australian men, whose partners miscarried between three months and ten years ago. Participants were recruited through professional networks and support organisations. Interviews explored men’s general miscarriage experience and the support received or lacking from both healthcare providers and social networks. Online health seeking behaviour and opinions on online support were also discussed. Data was transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. Most men described feeling significant grief following miscarriage and felt that there was little acknowledgment of their loss, both from healthcare providers and within their social networks. Feelings of sadness, devastation, powerlessness, fear, shock and a loss of identity were common. All men felt their primary role at the time of miscarriage was to support their partner. Most men did not want to burden their partner with their emotions or grief, and struggled to find people within their social networks to talk to about their loss, leading to feelings of isolation. Overall participants felt there was inadequate support offered to men affected by miscarriage. Men wanted information, informed professionals to talk to and male-orientated support networks. A website was one mechanism suggested by men which could adequately contribute to information and support needs during this time. Men are often greatly affected by miscarriage and yet there is all too often little acknowledgement or support available to them at this time. Men affected by miscarriage want and need further support, including reputable, Australian based information and resources tailored their needs."

User preferences must be incorporated into the design of new contraceptive technologies to ensure product success and improve family planning outcomes. We assessed preferences among potential users in Burkina Faso and Uganda for six contraceptive methods currently under development or ready for introduction: a new copper intra-uterine device (IUD), a levonorgestrel intra-uterine system, a new single-rod implant, a biodegradable implant, a longer-acting injectable, and a method of non-surgical permanent contraception. Questions were added to nationally-representative PMA2020 household surveys that asked 2,743 and 2,403 women in Burkina Faso and Uganda, respectively, their interest in using each new method. We assessed factors associated with interest through multivariable logistic regression models. We conducted qualitative interviews and focus groups with 398 women, 78 men, and 52 family planning providers and key informants to explore perceived advantages and disadvantages of the methods. Respondents expressed interest in using all new methods, with greatest interest in the longer-acting injectable (77% in Burkina Faso, 61% in Uganda), followed by a new single-rod implant. Least interest was expressed in a new copper IUD (26% Burkina Faso, 15% in Uganda). In both countries, women with less education had higher odds of interest in a longer-acting injectable. Interest in most new methods was associated with desiring a method lasting longer than one year and acceptance of lack of menstrual bleeding as a contraceptive side effect. Perceived advantages and disadvantages were similar between countries, including concerns about menstrual side effects and fear of the biodegradable nature of the biodegradable implant. Potential users, their partners, and providers are interested in new longer-acting methods, however, familiar forms including the injectable and implant may be the most immediately acceptable. A biodegradable implant will require clear counseling messages to allay potential fears."
https://openalex.org/W2947520855,"A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is the appearance of senile plaques, which are composed of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides. Aβ is produced by sequential cleavages of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases. These cleavages take place in endosomes during intracellular trafficking of APP through the endocytic and recycling pathways. Genome-wide association studies have identified several risk factors for late-onset AD, one of which is CD2-associated protein (CD2AP), an adaptor molecule that regulates membrane trafficking. Although CD2AP's involvement in APP trafficking has recently been reported, how APP trafficking is regulated remains unclear. We sought to address this question by investigating the effect of CD2AP overexpression or knockdown on the intracellular APP distribution and degradation of APP in cultured COS-7 and HEK293 cells. We found that overexpression of CD2AP increases the localization of APP to Rab7-positive late endosomes, and decreases its localization to Rab5-positive early endosomes. CD2AP overexpression accelerated the onset of APP degradation without affecting its degradation rate. Furthermore, nutrient starvation increased the localization of APP to Rab7-positive late endosomes, and CD2AP overexpression stimulated starvation-induced lysosomal APP degradation. Moreover, the effect of CD2AP on the degradation of APP was confirmed by CD2AP overexpression and knockdown in primary cortical neurons from mice. We conclude that CD2AP accelerates the transfer of APP from early to late endosomes. This transfer in localization stimulates APP degradation by reducing the amount of time before degradation initiation. Taken together, these results may explain why impaired CD2AP function is a risk factor for AD.

The major active compounds in A. lancea are essential oil compounds such as β-eudesmol, hinesol, atractylon, and atractylodin. The contents of the compounds in A. lancea exhibit high variability depending on their habitat. We cultivated clonal lines of A. lancea in different years (2016, 2017) and different locations (Hokkaido, Ibaraki) to investigate the influence of genetic and environmental factors on the contents of major compounds, namely, β-eudesmol, hinesol, atractylon, and atractylodin. Broad sense heritability of β-eudesmol, hinesol, atractylon, and atractylodin contents were 0.84, 0.77, 0.86, and 0.87, respectively. The effects of interannual variability on the contents of the compounds were lower than those of genotype. In addition, the cultivated environmental factors were assessed by different locations, and the correlations between Hokkaido and Ibaraki grown plants based on β-eudesmol, hinesol, atractylon, and atractylodin contents were 0.94, 0.94, 1.00, and 0.83, respectively. The results suggest that the contents of β-eudesmol, hinesol, atractylon, and atractylodin in A. lancea are largely influenced by genetic factors, and clonal propagation could be an effective strategy for obtaining populations with high contents of essential oil compounds. Furthermore, the contents of β-eudesmol, hinesol, atractylon, and atractylodin in A. lancea exhibited few correlations with rhizome yields. A. lancea cultivars with not only high contents of essential oil compounds but also high rhizome yield could be developed through selective breeding."

This was confirmed by knockdown/knockout of the sphingolipid delta(4)-desaturase/C4-monooxygenase (DES2) gene, involved in phytoceramide synthesis, disclosing that DES2 inhibition confers SIGLEC7 binding. Furthermore, knocking out fatty acid 2-hydroxylase also resulted in the emergence of SIGLEC7 binding to the cell surface.

We found that cytotoxicity is suppressed in DLD-1–GD3S cells with dehydroxylated GD3s.

https://openalex.org/W2947065889,"Cell migration is essential to embryonic development, wound healing, and cancer cell dissemination. Cells move via leading-edge protrusion, substrate adhesion, and retraction of the cell's rear. The molecular mechanisms by which extracellular cues signal to the actomyosin cytoskeleton to control these motility mechanics are poorly understood. The growth factor-responsive and oncogenically activated protein extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) promotes motility by signaling in actin polymerization-mediated edge protrusion. Using a combination of immunoblotting, co-immunoprecipitation, and myosin-binding experiments and cell migration assays, we show here that ERK also signals to the contractile machinery through its substrate, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK). We probed the signaling and migration dynamics of multiple mammalian cell lines and found that RSK phosphorylates myosin phosphatase–targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1) at Ser-507, which promotes an interaction of Rho kinase (ROCK) with MYPT1 and inhibits myosin targeting. We find that by inhibiting the myosin phosphatase, ERK and RSK promote myosin II–mediated tension for lamella expansion and optimal edge dynamics for cell migration. These findings suggest that ERK activity can coordinately amplify both protrusive and contractile forces for optimal cell motility."

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we investigated whether carnosine activates intestinal epithelial cells and induces the secretion of factors that activate brain function. We focused on exosomes derived from intestinal epithelial cells as mediators of brain-gut interaction. Results showed that exosomes derived from Caco-2 cells treated with carnosine significantly induced neurite growth in SH-SY5Y cells. To clarify the molecular basis of this finding, we performed integrated analysis of microRNAs (miRNAs) with altered expression in exosomes in response to carnosine treatment and mRNAs with altered expression in target cells in response to exosome treatment to identify related miRNAs and their target genes. The combination of miR-6769-5p and its target gene ATXN1 was found to be involved in the exosome-induced activation of neuronal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2946835078,"During intertemporal decisions, the value of future rewards decreases as a function of the delay of its receipt (temporal discounting, TD). Since high discount rates have been associated with a series of problematic behaviours and clinical conditions, current research has focused on possible modulators of TD. Specifically, a reduction of individual discount rates has been shown during episodic future thinking (EFT), wherein time intervals are anchored to personal future events. However, it is not entirely clear whether this effect is mediated by a change in the representation of future events (i.e., from abstract to concrete) or by a positive-emotion modulation. Here, we investigated this issue by manipulating the valence of the EFT (i.e., using negative, neutral and positive episodic tags), and by collecting explicit and implicit measures of behaviour. The results showed a significant reduction of TD in all the three emotional conditions compared to the baseline, with differences among them, thus suggesting the existence of a cumulative effect of the concreteness and affective components of the EFT. The analyses of implicit measures additionally revealed that this effect was mediated by a simultaneous increase/decrease of attraction toward the delayed/immediate alternative. Finally, these effects appeared to be modulated by participants’ baseline discounting preferences. These findings provide important insights on clinical applications in reward-related disorders."

The NIAID has designated RVFV as a Category A priority emerging pathogen due to the devastating public health outcomes associated with epidemic outbreaks. However, there is no licensed treatment or vaccine approved for human use. Therefore it is of great interest to understand RVFV pathogenesis in infected hosts in order to facilitate creation of targeted therapies and treatment options. Here we provide insight into the host-pathogen interface in human HEK293 cells during RVFV MP-12 strain infection using high-throughput mRNA sequencing technology. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of differentially expressed genes showed robust innate immune and cytokine-mediated inflammatory pathway activation as well as alterations in pathways associated with fatty acid metabolism and extracellular matrix receptor signaling. We also analyzed the promoter regions of DEGs for patterns in transcription factor binding sites, and found several that are known to act synergistically to impact apoptosis, immunity, metabolism, and cell growth and differentiation. Lastly, we noted dramatic changes in host alternative splicing patterns in genes associated with mRNA decay and surveillance, RNA transport, and DNA repair.

Poor IVD healing motivates developing tissue engineering repair strategies. This study evaluated a composite injectable IVD biomaterial repair strategy using carboxymethylcellulose-methylcellulose (CMC-MC) and genipin-crosslinked fibrin (FibGen) that mimic NP and AF properties, respectively. Bovine ex vivo caudal IVDs were evaluated in cyclic compression-tension, torsion, and compression-to-failure tests to determine IVD biomechanical properties, height loss, and herniation risk following experimentally-induced severe herniation injury and discectomy (4 mm biopsy defect with 20% NP removed). FibGen with and without CMC-MC had failure strength similar to discectomy injury suggesting no increased risk compared to surgical procedures, yet no biomaterials improved axial or torsional biomechanical properties suggesting they were incapable of adequately restoring AF tension. FibGen had the largest failure strength and was further evaluated in additional discectomy injury models with varying AF defect types (2 mm biopsy, 4 mm cruciate, 4 mm biopsy) and NP removal volume (0%, 20%). All simulated discectomy defects significantly compromised failure strength and biomechanical properties. The 0% NP removal group had mean values of axial biomechanical properties closer to intact levels than defects with 20% NP removed but they were not statistically different and 0% NP removal also decreased failure strength. FibGen with and without CMC-MC failed at super-physiological stress levels above simulated discectomy suggesting repair with these tissue engineered biomaterials may perform better than discectomy alone, although restored biomechanical function may require additional healing with the potential application of these biomaterials as sealants and cell/drug delivery carriers."
https://openalex.org/W2904487468,"European farmlands are vital arenas for socio-ecological sustainability because of their significant land coverage and potential for integrating food production with biodiversity conservation. The knowledge produced by scientific research is a critical ingredient in developing and implementing socio-economically and ecologically sustainable management strategies for farming landscapes. The grasslands of Europe have been managed for millennia. They have exceptional socio-cultural and economic value and are among the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world. The quality of scientific knowledge on them and its potential to address grasslands as complex socio-ecological systems is strongly dependent not only on the creativity and scientific ambition of the researcher, but also on the network around the researcher (including both academic and non-academic sectors). The goal of this study is to map the research network around Romania’s grasslands using bibliometrics analysis, a well-developed scientific domain that utilizes network theory to analyze relationships between affiliations networks, co-authorship networks, and co-word analysis. The number of studies targeting grasslands in Romania is increasing, owing mostly to international involvement. However, management of the grasslands is still deficient and the contribution of science to the process is virtually absent. The current research is mainly related to the biological and ecological characteristics of grasslands, with topics related to their management notably absent from internationally visible research, especially in the context of EU Common Agricultural Policies. To increase scientific inquiry and better inform the EU and local policies on grasslands management, Romanian researchers should capitalize on international collaborations and local academic leaders. Our findings can be used to identify research gaps and to improve collaboration and knowledge exchange between practitioners, researchers, policy makers, and stakeholders."
https://openalex.org/W2947620487,"This study was conducted in two stages to investigate the potential of multi-enzyme supplementation on the nutrient digestibility, growth performance, and gut microbial composition of pigs. In stage 1, effects of multi-enzyme complex (xylanase, α-amylase, β-glucanase, and protease) supplementation on the ileal and total tract dry matter (DM) digestibility of feed-stuffs were investigated with in vitro two-stage and three-stage enzyme incubation methods. A wide range of feed ingredients, namely, corn meal, wheat meal, soybean meal, fish meal, Oriental herbal extract, Italian rye-grass (IRG) and peanut hull were used as substrates. Supplementation of the multi-enzyme complex increased (P < 0.05) the digestibility of the Oriental herbal extract and corn meal. In stage 2, in vivo animal studies were performed to further investigate the effects of the dietary multi-enzyme complex on the nutrient utilization, growth performance, and fecal microbial composition of pigs. A total of 36 weaned pigs were fed corn- and soybean meal-based diets without (control) and with the multi-enzyme complex (treatment) for 6 weeks. Fecal samples were collected from 12 pigs to analyze the microbial communities by using DNA sequencing and bioinformatics tools. Multi-enzyme supplementation had no effect on apparent digestibility of nutrients and growth performance of pigs compared to control. Taxonomic analysis of the fecal samples indicated that the bacteria in both control and treatment samples predominantly belonged to Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. In addition, the proportion of the phylum Firmicutes was slightly higher in the treatment group. At the genus level, the abundance of Treponema and Barnesiella increased in the treatment group; whereas the numbers ofthe genera including Prevotella, Butyricicoccus, Ruminococcus and Succinivibrio decreased in the treatment group. These results suggest that multi-enzyme supplementation with basal diets have the potential to improve nutrient digestibility and modify microbial communities in the hind-gut of pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2947277453,"The performance of data clustering algorithms is mainly dependent on their ability to balance between the exploration and exploitation of the search process. Although some data clustering algorithms have achieved reasonable quality solutions for some datasets, their performance across real-life datasets could be improved. This paper proposes an adaptive memetic differential evolution optimisation algorithm (AMADE) for addressing data clustering problems. The memetic algorithm (MA) employs an adaptive differential evolution (DE) mutation strategy, which can offer superior mutation performance across many combinatorial and continuous problem domains. By hybridising an adaptive DE mutation operator with the MA, we propose that it can lead to faster convergence and better balance the exploration and exploitation of the search. We would also expect that the performance of AMADE to be better than MA and DE if executed separately. Our experimental results, based on several real-life benchmark datasets, shows that AMADE outperformed other compared clustering algorithms when compared using statistical analysis. We conclude that the hybridisation of MA and the adaptive DE is a suitable approach for addressing data clustering problems and can improve the balance between global exploration and local exploitation of the optimisation algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W2947106388,"Exposure to organophosphorus compounds (OPs) may be fatal if untreated, and a clear and present danger posed by nerve agent OPs has become palpable in recent years. OPs inactivate acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by covalently modifying its catalytic serine. Inhibited AChE cannot hydrolyze the neurotransmitter acetylcholine leading to its build-up at the cholinergic synapses and creating an acute cholinergic crisis. Current antidotes, including oxime reactivators that attack the OP-AChE conjugate to free the active enzyme, are inefficient. Better reactivators are sought, but their design is hampered by a conformationally rigid portrait of AChE extracted exclusively from 100K X-ray crystallography and scarcity of structural knowledge on human AChE (hAChE). Here, we present room temperature X-ray structures of native and VX-phosphonylated hAChE with an imidazole-based oxime reactivator, RS-170B. We discovered that inhibition with VX triggers substantial conformational changes in bound RS-170B from a nonproductive pose (the reactive aldoxime group points away from the VX-bound serine) in the reactivator-only complex to a semi-productive orientation in the VX-modified complex. This observation, supported by concurrent molecular simulations, suggested that the narrow active-site gorge of hAChE may be significantly more dynamic than previously thought, allowing RS-170B to reorient inside the gorge. Furthermore, we found that small molecules can bind in the choline-binding site hindering approach to the phosphorous of VX-bound serine. Our results provide structural and mechanistic perspectives on the reactivation of OP-inhibited hAChE and demonstrate that structural studies at physiologically relevant temperatures can deliver previously overlooked insights applicable for designing next-generation antidotes."
https://openalex.org/W2947556634,"This study aimed to investigate the cleansing effects of grapefruit seed extract (GSE) on biofilms of Candida albicans (C. albicans) formed on denture-base resin and the influence of GSE on the mechanical and surface characteristics of the resin. GSE solution diluted with distilled water to 0.1% (0.1% GSE) and 1% (1% GSE) and solutions with Polident® denture cleansing tablet dissolved in distilled water (Polident) or in 0.1% GSE solution (0.1% G+P) were prepared as cleansing solutions. Discs of acrylic resin were prepared, and the biofilm of C. albicans was formed on the discs. The discs with the biofilm were treated with each solution for 5 min at 25°C. After the treatment, the biofilm on the discs was analyzed using a colony forming unit (CFU) assay, fluorescence microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In order to assess the persistent cleansing effect, the discs treated with each solution for 5 min were aerobically incubated in Yeast Nitrogen Base medium for another 24 h. After incubation, the persistent effect was assessed by CFU assay. Some specimens of acrylic resin were immersed in each solution for 7 days, and changes in surface roughness (Ra), Vickers hardness (VH), flexural strength (FS), and flexural modulus (FM) were evaluated. As a result, the treatment with 1% GSE for 5 min almost completely eliminated the biofilm formed on the resin; whereas, the treatment with 0.1% GSE, Polident, and 0.1% G+P for 5 min showed a statistically significant inhibitory effect on biofilms. In addition, 0.1% GSE and 0.1% G+P exerted a persistent inhibitory effect on biofilms. Fluorescence microscopy indicated that Polident mainly induced the death of yeast, while the cleansing solutions containing at least 0.1% GSE induced the death of hyphae as well as yeast. SEM also revealed that Polident caused wrinkles, shrinkage, and some deep craters predominantly on the cell surfaces of yeast, while the solutions containing at least 0.1% GSE induced wrinkles, shrinkage, and some damage on cell surfaces of not only yeasts but also hyphae. No significant changes in Ra, VH, FS, or FM were observed after immersion in any of the solutions. Taken together, GSE solution is capable of cleansing C. albicans biofilms on denture-base resin and has a persistent inhibitory effect on biofilm development, without any deteriorations of resin surface."
https://openalex.org/W2947872697,"Background Radium-223 is a targeted alpha-particle therapy that improves survival in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), particularly in men with elevated serum levels of bone alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP). We hypothesized that osteomimicry, a form of epithelial plasticity leading to an osteoblastic phenotype, may contribute to intralesional deposition of radium-223 and subsequent irradiation of the tumor microenvironment. Methods We conducted a pharmacodynamic study (NCT02204943) of radium-223 in men with bone mCRPC. Prior to and three and six months after radium-223 treatment initiation, we collected CTCs and metastatic biopsies for phenotypic characterization and CTC genomic analysis. The primary objective was to describe the impact of radium-223 on the prevalence of CTC B-ALP over time. We measured radium-223 decay products in tumor and surrounding normal bone during treatment. We validated genomic findings in a separate independent study of men with bone metastatic mCRPC (n = 45) and publicly accessible data of metastatic CRPC tissues. Results We enrolled 20 men with symptomatic bone predominant mCRPC and treated with radium-223. We observed greater radium-223 radioactivity levels in metastatic bone tumor containing biopsies compared with adjacent normal bone. We found evidence of persistent Cellsearch CTCs and B-ALP (+) CTCs in the majority of men over time during radium-223 therapy despite serum B-ALP normalization. We identified genomic gains in osteoblast mimicry genes including gains of ALPL, osteopontin, SPARC, OB-cadherin and loss of RUNX2, and validated genomic alterations or increased expression at the DNA and RNA level in an independent cohort of 45 men with bone-metastatic CRPC and in 150 metastatic biopsies from men with mCRPC. Conclusions Osteomimicry may contribute in part to the uptake of radium-223 within bone metastases and may thereby enhance the therapeutic benefit of this bone targeting radiotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2977738891,"Background The antibody response to pertussis vaccination in rheumatoid arthritis is unknown, a concerning omission given the relatively low efficacy of the pertussis vaccine, a rise in pertussis infections, and a general increased susceptibility to infection in rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, the contributions from an intrinsically dysregulated immune system in rheumatoid arthritis and immune-suppressing medications to the response to pertussis vaccination is poorly defined. This study examines antibody titers against pertussis in vaccinated rheumatoid arthritis patients and controls as well as evaluates potential contributions from demographic factors, immune suppressing medications, and reactivity against citrullinated pertussis. Methods Serum IgG titers against native and citrullinated pertussis and tetanus were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in rheumatoid arthritis subjects and controls who were vaccinated within 10 years. Titers were compared by t-test and percent immunity by Fisher’s exact test. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify clinical factors that correlate with native pertussis titers. Results Compared to controls, rheumatoid arthritis subjects had lower titers against pertussis, but not tetanus, and reduced immunity to pertussis. These results were even more prominent at 5–10 years post-vaccination, when rheumatoid arthritis patients had 50% lower titers than controls and 2.5x more rheumatoid arthritis subjects were not considered immune to pertussis. Multiple logistic regression demonstrated that female sex and methotrexate use, but not TNF inhibiting medications, correlated with reduced immunity to pertussis. Finally, rheumatoid arthritis patients had higher IgG titers against citrullinated pertussis than native pertussis. Conclusions Pertussis titers are lower in vaccinated rheumatoid arthritis patients with evidence for contributions from female sex, a citrulline-biased immune response, and methotrexate use."
https://openalex.org/W2947415720,"The effect of hempseed in the diet of laying hens was evaluated at 0, 30, 60 and 90 g/kg concentrations. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of dietary treatment on the performance of hens, the physical characteristics of egg quality, the concentrations of α- and γ-tocopherol and the carotenoid and cholesterol contents of egg yolks, together with the breaking strength of tibial measurements. In light of the obtained results, our study aimed to address the optimal dietary level of hempseed in laying hen diets. Lohmann Brown hens (n = 240) were divided into 4 dietary treatment groups (6 cages per treatment) with 10 hens per cage. The experiment lasted for 12 weeks. The level of nutrients in all diets (wheat-corn) was well balanced. The dietary metabolisable energy was adjusted using rapeseed oil. The addition of 30 g/kg of hempseed to the diet significantly increased (P˂0.001) egg production and egg mass. Alpha-tocopherol increased significantly (P = 0.002) only in the case of the 60 g/kg hempseed level (101 mg/kg dry matter (DM) versus 83 mg/ kg DM in the control group). In contrast, the level of γ-tocopherol increased gradually from 11 mg/kg DM in the control to 29, 39 and 43 mg/kg DM at the 30, 60 and 90 g/kg levels of dietary hempseed, respectively. The concentrations of beta carotene, zeaxanthin and lutein in egg yolks were not influenced by the dietary treatment. Hempseed at 90 g/kg (P = 0.036) decreased egg shell thickness without affecting its strength. The addition of hempseed decreased (P˂0.001) the cholesterol concentration in the egg yolks in all experimental groups. The addition of 30, 60 and 90 g hempseed increased (P˂0.001) the breaking strength of the tibia to 354, 352 and 350 N, respectively, compared to 297 N in the control group. The highest level of hempseed in the diet positively influenced the Ca concentration in the tibia (P = 0.021). The concentration of P in the tibia was negatively affected in the 60 to 90 g/kg hempseed treatments (P˂0.001). Eggs are a significant source of α-tocopherol. Based on our results, there is a possibility for enrichment of egg yolks with γ-tocopherol, with all of its associated health benefits, by the addition of hempseed to the diet of laying hens. Another significant benefit of hempseed is its effect on the breaking strength of the tibia, which can help with crucial problems in the commercial breeding of laying hens."

However, recombinant soluble wild-type ZIKV envelope (wtZE) might preferentially exist as monomer (monZE). Recently, it has been shown that the A264C substitution could promote formation of dimeric ZIKV envelope protein (ZEA264C), requiring further characterization of purified ZEA264C for its potential applications in vaccine development. We also noted that ZEA264C, connected by disulfide bond, might be different from the noncovalent native envelope dimer on the virion surface. Because the antibody Fc fragment exists as dimer and is widely used for fusion protein construction, here we fused wtZE to human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) Fc fragment (ZE-Fc) for noncovalent wtZE dimerization. Using a multistep purification procedure, we separated dimeric ZEA264C and ZE-Fc, revealing that they both exhibit typical β-sheet–rich secondary structures and stabilities similar to those of monZE. The binding activities of monZE, ZEA264C, and ZE-Fc to neutralizing antibodies targeting different epitopes indicated that ZEA264C and ZE-Fc could better mimic the native dimeric status, especially in terms of the formation of tertiary and quaternary epitopes. Both ZEA264C and ZE-Fc recognize a ZIKV-sensitive cell line as does monZE, indicating that the two constructs are still functional. Furthermore, a murine immunization assay disclose that ZEA264C and ZE-Fc elicit more neutralizing antibody responses than monZE does.

The ability to plan actions is a particularly important aspect of motor skill since it is involved in many daily activities. In this work, we studied the development of motor planning longitudinally in children with an older sibling with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) who are at heightened risk (HR) for the disorder and children with no such risk (low risk; LR) using a shape sorter task. Children were observed at 14, 18, 24 and 36 months. Three HR children with a later diagnosis of ASD (HR-ASD) were analyzed separately from the rest of the sample. Behavioral and kinematic data indicated that precision demands significantly influenced children’s actions, and that children’s performance improved with age. No differences were found between the HR and LR groups, but a descriptive analysis of data from the three HR-ASD suggested differences in the variables describing children’s action (as reaching time and acceleration) as well as variables describing children’s performance (as the adjustment of the shapes)."
https://openalex.org/W2947762674,"The uvea comprises the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. However, the development of the anterior part (iris and ciliary body) in children is not yet fully elucidated.

Horizontal scanning images of swept-source ASOCT were analyzed in temporal and nasal angle areas. The ITs at 1 and 2 mm from the pupil edge were measured using swept-source ASOCT. The association between IT and age, sex, and ocular morphological parameters (i.e., axial length, average corneal curvature, central corneal thickness, inter-scleral spur distance, and anterior chamber depth) was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) and linear regression analysis.The average IT (temporal and nasal) at 1 and 2 mm were 0.432 ± 0.060 (0.302-0.569 mm) and 0.337 ± 0.045 (0.229-0.414 mm), respectively. There was a significant correlation between age and average IT (r = 0.45, P = 0.002 at 1 mm and r = 0.31, P = 0.042 at 2 mm). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that age (coefficient: 0.01), axial length (-0.02), average corneal curvature (0.01), and anterior chamber depth (0.01) at 1 mm as well as age (0.00), average corneal curvature (0.09), anterior chamber depth (0.06), and male (-0.02) at 2 mm were identified as predictors of IT.IT in children increases with age. Additionally, IT was thinner with longer axial length and in males, thicker in eyes with deeper anterior chamber and flatter corneal curvature. Our study may partly explain the development of eyeball structures in children."

However, the biocompatibility of those additives is not well known. The objective of the study was to characterize the impact of zinc stearate-a common additive-through the development of a novel three-dimensional (3-D) in vitro platform with endometrial cells from domestic cats. Epithelial and stromal cells from adult uteri were isolated and cultured in medium supplemented with 3% Matrigel for two weeks in plastic tissue culture dishes that had been identified as polystyrene with and without zinc stearate by Raman, FTIR, and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopies. Three-dimensional cell structures that were obtained were measured and categorized by shape. Cell viability, proliferation, differentiation, organization, and apoptosis then were assessed by immuno-staining. Results indicated that zinc stearate did not affect 3-D endometrial cell structure morphology, viability, or cellular composition. This first study of a new in vitro platform will be useful for studies testing the influence of other additives, drugs, or exogenous hormones."
https://openalex.org/W2946877421,"Coffee farms have been adopting the microterraces system, a technique that reduces the effect of the slope by moving the soil between the crop lines. In this way, all the mechanized operations can be carried out normally, except for harvesting, due to the work limitation of the harvesters, who work in areas with a maximum slope of 20%. One option is to use unilateral harvesters, which crop one side at a time; however, there has been no research on these microterrace machines to evaluate their performance and to compare it with those of the other harvesting methods in those regions. This study aimed to compare the mechanized harvest performance in the microterraces with the manual and semimechanized harvesting methods. The study was carried out in an agricultural area of the municipality of Ouro Fino / MG, Brazil, in a crop production site where the microterraces were built six years before the experiment. The treatments were assigned to a split-block design with seven repetitions and consisted of mechanized harvest-unilateral harvester with bag storage; manual harvest-regionally experienced workers; and semimechanized harvest-with portable breakers. Through an analysis of the times and movements, the operational efficiency and operational and effective field capabilities were measured. The adoption of microterraces allows the efficient mechanization of areas previously impossible to mechanize. The unilateral harvester is a potential tool for the partial replacement of manual labor in the harvest, performing a service equivalent to that of 23.68 manual workers and 10.55 manual workers in the semimechanized system."
https://openalex.org/W2947309203,"Taxonomic identifications in some groups of lichen-forming fungi have been challenge largely due to the scarcity of taxonomically relevant features and limitations of morphological and chemical characters traditionally used to distinguish closely related taxa. Delineating species boundaries in closely related species or species complexes often requires a range of multisource data sets and comprehensive analytical methods. Here we aim to examine species boundaries in a group of saxicolous lichen forming fungi, the Aspiciliella intermutans complex (Megasporaceae), widespread mainly in the Mediterranean. We gathered DNA sequences of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (nuITS), the nuclear large subunit (nuLSU), the mitochondrial small subunit (mtSSU) ribosomal DNA, and the DNA replication licensing factor MCM7 from 80 samples mostly from Iran, Caucasia, Greece and eastern Europe. We used a combination of phylogenetic strategies and a variety of empirical, sequence-based species delimitation approaches to infer species boundaries in this group. The latter included: the automatic barcode gap discovery (ABGD), the multispecies coalescent approach *BEAST and Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography (BPP) program. Different species delimitation scenarios were compared using Bayes factors species delimitation analysis. Furthermore, morphological, chemical, ecological and geographical features of the sampled specimens were examined. Our study uncovered cryptic species diversity in A. intermutans and showed that morphology-based taxonomy may be unreliable, underestimating species diversity in this group of lichens. We identified a total of six species-level lineages in the A. intermutans complex using inferences from multiple empirical operational criteria. We found little corroboration between morphological and ecological features with our proposed candidate species, while secondary metabolite data do not corroborate tree topology. The present study on the A. intermutans species-complex indicates that the genus Aspiciliella, as currently circumscribed, is more diverse in Eurasia than previously expected."
https://openalex.org/W2947512809,"Galphimia glauca is a plant that is endemic to Mexico and has been commonly used since pre-Hispanic times to treat various illnesses, including central nervous system disorders and inflammation. The first studies investigating a natural population of G. glauca in Mexico showed that the plant has anxiolytic and sedative activities in mice and humans. The plant’s bioactive compounds were isolated and identified, and they belong to a family of nor-secofriedelanes called galphimines. The integration of DNA barcoding and thin-layer chromatography analysis was performed to clarify whether the botanical classification of the populations in the study, which were collected in different regions of Mexico, as G. glauca was correct or if the populations consist of more than one species of the genus Galphimia. We employed six DNA barcodes (matK, rbcL, rpoC1, psbA-trnH, ITS1 and ITS2) that were analyzed individually and in combination and then compared each other, to indicate differences among the studied populations. In the phylogenetic analysis, ITS1 and ITS2 markers as well as the combination of all DNA regions were the most efficient for discriminating the population studied. The thin-layer chromatography analysis exhibited four principal chemical profiles, one of which corresponded to the populations that produced galphimines. DNA barcoding was consistent and enabled us to differentiate the populations that produce galphimines from those that do not. The results of this investigation suggest that the studied populations belong to at least four different species of the genus Galphimia. The phylogenetic analysis and the thin-layer chromatography chemical profiles were convenient tools for establishing a strong relationship between the genotype and phenotype of the studied populations and could be used for quality control purposes to prepare herbal medicines from plants of the genus Galphimia."
https://openalex.org/W2920060539,"Academic esteem is difficult to quantify in objective terms. Network theory offers the opportunity to use a mathematical formalism to model both the esteem associated with an academic and the relationships between academic colleagues. Early attempts using this line of reasoning have focused on intellectual genealogy as constituted by supervisor student networks. The process of examination is critical in many areas of study but has not played a part in existing models. A network theoretical ""social"" model is proposed as a tool to explore and understand the dynamics of esteem in the academic hierarchy. It is observed that such a model naturally gives rise to the idea that the esteem associated with a node in the graph (the esteem of an individual academic) can be viewed as a dynamic quantity that evolves with time based on both local and non-local changes in the properties in the network. The toy model studied here includes both supervisor-student and examiner-student relationships. This gives an insight into some of the key features of academic genealogies and naturally leads to a proposed model for ""esteem propagation"" on academic networks. This propagation is not solely directed forward in time (from teacher to progeny) but sometimes also flows in the other direction. As collaborators do well, this reflects well on those with whom they choose to collaborate and those that taught them. Furthermore, esteem as a quantity continues to be dynamic even after the end of a relationship or career. In other words, esteem can be thought of as flowing both forward and backward in time."

The iron centers of CCDs are typically five-coordinate in their resting states, with solvent occupying an exchangeable site. The involvement of this iron-bound solvent in CCD catalysis has not been experimentally addressed, but computational studies suggest two possible roles. 1) Solvent dissociation provides a coordination site for O2, or 2) solvent remains bound to iron but changes its equilibrium position to allow O2 binding and potentially acts as a proton source. To test these predictions, we investigated isotope effects (H2O versus D2O) on two stilbenoid-cleaving CCDs, Novosphingobium aromaticivorans oxygenase 2 (NOV2) and Neurospora crassa carotenoid oxygenase 1 (CAO1), using piceatannol as a substrate. NOV2 exhibited an inverse isotope effect (kH/kD ∼ 0.6) in an air-saturated buffer, suggesting that solvent dissociates from iron during the catalytic cycle. By contrast, CAO1 displayed a normal isotope effect (kH/kD ∼ 1.7), suggesting proton transfer in the rate-limiting step. X-ray absorption spectroscopy on NOV2 and CAO1 indicated that the protonation states of the iron ligands are unchanged within pH 6.5–8.5 and that the Fe(II)–aquo bond is minimally altered by substrate binding. We pinpointed the origin of the differential kinetic behaviors of NOV2 and CAO1 to a single amino acid difference near the solvent-binding site of iron, and X-ray crystallography revealed that the substitution alters binding of diffusible ligands to the iron center.

Here, we used a chimeric TdT harboring Loop1 of Pol μ that recapitulated the functional properties of Pol μ in ligation experiments. We solved three crystal structures of this TdT chimera bound to several DNA substrates at 1.96–2.55 Å resolutions, including a full DNA double-strand break (DSB) synapsis. We then modeled the full Pol μ sequence in the context of one these complexes. The atomic structure of an NHEJ junction with a Pol X construct that mimics Pol μ in a reconstituted system explained the distinctive properties of Pol μ compared with TdT. The structure suggested a mechanism of base selection relying on Loop1 and taking instructions via the in trans templating base independently of the primer strand. We conclude that our atomic-level structural observations represent a paradigm shift for the mechanism of base selection in the Pol X family of DNA polymerases. Eukaryotic DNA polymerase (Pol) X family members such as Pol μ and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) are important components for the nonhomologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ) pathway. TdT participates in a specialized version of NHEJ, V(D)J recombination.

https://openalex.org/W2947386867,"In order to identify common and specific enzymatic activities associated with the metabolism of the three cellular domains of life, the conservation and variations between the enzyme contents of Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya organisms were evaluated. To this end, the content of enzymes belonging to a particular pathway and their abundance and distribution in 1507 organisms that have been annotated and deposited in the KEGG database were assessed. In addition, we evaluated the consecutive enzymatic reaction pairs obtained from metabolic pathway reactions and transformed into sequences of enzymatic reactions, with catalytic activities encoded in the Enzyme Commission numbers, which are linked by a substrate. Both analyses are complementary: the first considers individual reactions associated with each organism and metabolic map, and the second evaluates the functional associations between pairs of consecutive reactions. From these comparisons, we found a set of five enzymatic reactions that were widely distributed in all the organisms and considered here as universal to Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya; whereas 132 pairs out of 3151 reactions were identified as significant, only 5 of them were found to be widely distributed in all the taxonomic divisions. However, these universal reactions are not widely distributed along the metabolic maps, suggesting their dispensability to all metabolic processes. Finally, we found that universal reactions are also associated with ancestral domains, such as those related to phosphorus-containing groups with a phosphate group as acceptor or those related to the ribulose-phosphate binding barrel, triosephosphate isomerase, and D-ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (RpiA) lid domain, among others. Therefore, we consider that this analysis provides clues about the functional constraints associated with the repertoire of enzymatic functions per organism."
https://openalex.org/W2946876464,"Environmental circadian disruption (ECD), characterized by repeated or long-term disruption in environmental timing cues which require the internal circadian clock to change its phase to resynchronize with the environment, is associated with numerous serious health issues in humans. While animal and isolated cell models exist to study the effects of destabilizing the relationship between the circadian system and the environment, neither approach provides an ideal solution. Here, we developed an in vitro model which incorporates both elements of a reductionist cellular model and disruption of the clock/environment relationship using temperature as an environmental cue, as occurs in vivo. Using this approach, we have demonstrated that some effects of in vivo ECD can be reproduced using only isolated peripheral oscillators. Specifically, we report exaggerated inflammatory responses to endotoxin following repeated environmental circadian disruption in explanted spleens. This effect requires a functional circadian clock but not the master brain clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Further, we report that this is a result of cumulative, rather than acute, circadian disruption as has been previously observed in vivo. Finally, such effects appear to be tissue specific as it does not occur in lung, which is less sensitive to the temperature cycles employed to induce ECD. Taken together, the present study suggests that this model could be a valuable tool for dissecting the causes and effects of circadian disruption both in isolated components of physiological systems as well as the aggregated interactions of these systems that occur in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2946890784,"Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common cause of nosocomial diarrhea and places a significant burden on patients and the health care system. Statins could lead to improvements in CDI clinical response due their pleiotropic effects, including immunomodulatory and lipid-lowering effects; however, few studies have assessed this association. The primary objective of this study was to compare CDI health outcomes in statin users and non-users in a national cohort of patients. This was a retrospective cohort study of all adult CDI patients receiving care from the Veterans Health Administration from 2002 to 2014. Patients were divided into two groups based on statin exposure 90 days prior to and during their first CDI encounter. CDI health outcomes, including mortality and CDI recurrence, were compared using a propensity-score matched cohort of statin users and non-users and multivariable logistic regression. A total of 26,149 patients met study inclusion criteria, of which 173 statins-users and 173 non-users were propensity score matched. Thirty-day mortality was significantly lower among statins users with CDI (12.7%) compared to non-users (20.2%) (aOR 0.34; 95% CI 0.16-0.72). Sixty-day CDI recurrence was non-significantly lower among statin-users (9.0%) compared to non-users (16.6%) (aOR 0.68; 95% CI 0.29-1.59). In this nationally-representative study of veterans with CDI, statin use was associated with lower 30-day mortality compared to non-use. Statin use was not associated with 60-day CDI recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2947041340,"Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) belongs to a larger group of primate T-cell lymphotropic viruses (PTLVs) within the family Retroviridae. It is estimated that 10 to 20 million people worldwide may be infected with HTLV-1. Although most of them are asymptomatic, around 5% of infected individuals may develop either HTLV-1 Associated Myelopathy/Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (HAM/TSP) or Adult T-cell Leukaemia/Lymphoma (ATLL). Public Health authorities in many countries have implemented routine blood-donor tests for HTLV-specific antibodies; but this is not the case for Germany since the reported prevalence is very low (7/100,000). With the aim to evaluate retrospectively the presence of HTLV-1 among oncology patients in this country, samples stored at the Universitätsklinikum Freiburg, were analyzed. For this purpose, two different nested-PCR (n-PCR) protocols have been modified and set up for HTLV-1 detection. One positive case was detected by n-PCR among 406 samples (0,25%) in a period of 5 years (2008–2012) corresponding to a T-Cell Lymphoma. Despite the low prevalence, this virus is circulating in Germany, probably due to the increasing numbers of immigrants in these last years. Physicians should consider HTLV-1 infection and suspect it taking in account the ethnic and relation to endemic regions regardless the patient's residence."
https://openalex.org/W2947031932,"Although interpersonal coordinative activities have been shown to produce prosocial effects in both adults and children, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. While most approaches focus on the effect of mimicry and synchronous behavioral matching, we hypothesize that temporal predictability might play a central role in producing prosocial effects, as it directs coordination and might therefore strengthen shared intentionality. In a percussion task with pairs of 5-year old children, we manipulated temporal predictability and movement similarity/predictability between the pair's movements. Temporal predictability was manipulated by instructing the pair to play the instruments either to beats that were evenly-spaced, and therefore predictable, or to beats that were random, and therefore unpredictable. Movement similarity/predictability was manipulated by having the pair play rhythmic patterns that were similar, predictable, or independent from each other. Children who played to predictable beats were more willing to solve problems cooperatively with their partners and to help when their partners had an accident. In contrast, there was no positive effect of rhythmic predictability or similarity. These results are the first to show that temporal predictability affects prosociality independent of movement similarity or predictability. We conclude that the predictable time frame commonly seen in coordinative activities may be key to strengthening shared intentionality and producing prosocial effects."
https://openalex.org/W2947040934,"Introduction Anorectal malformations (ARM) are rare congenital malformations, resulting from disturbed hindgut development. A genetic etiology has been suggested, but evidence for the involvement of specific genes is scarce. We evaluated the contribution of rare and low-frequency coding variants in ARM etiology, assuming a multifactorial model. Methods We analyzed 568 Caucasian ARM patients and 1,860 population-based controls using the Illumina HumanExome Beadchip array, which contains >240,000 rare and low-frequency coding variants. GenomeStudio clustering and calling was followed by re-calling of ‘no-calls’ using zCall for patients and controls simultaneously. Single variant and gene-based analyses were performed to identify statistically significant associations, applying Bonferroni correction. Following an extra quality control step, candidate variants were selected for validation using Sanger sequencing. Results When we applied a MAF of ≥1.0%, no variants or genes showed statistically significant associations with ARM. Using a MAF cut-off at 0.4%, 13 variants initially reached statistical significance, but had to be discarded upon further inspection: ten variants represented calling errors of the software, while the minor alleles of the remaining three variants were not confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Conclusion Our results show that rare and low-frequency coding variants with large effect sizes, present on the exome chip do not contribute to ARM etiology."
https://openalex.org/W2947338995,"Allogeneic transplantation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes is apromising treatment for cardiac diseases, although immune rejection by the recipient poses a concern. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether concomitant transplantation of vasculogenically conditioned peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which are otherwise immunosuppressive, may enhance graft survival. Luciferase-transduced, iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from C57BL/6 mice were transplanted to the dorsal subcutaneous space of syngeneic C57BL/6 mice (n = 19), allogeneic Balb/c mice treated with (n = 20) or without (n = 20) immunosuppressants, and those injected with vasculogenically conditioned peripheral blood mononuclear cells (n = 20). Although graft survival, assessed by bioluminescence, was comparable among the groups initially, it improved significantly at days 7 and 10 in allogeneic transplanted mice treated with vasculogenically conditioned peripheral blood mononuclear cells than in others (P < 0.01). Our results proved that cell-based immunosuppression may boost clinical outcomes from allogeneic cell therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2947758276,"This paper focuses on fine-grained image retrieval based on sketches. Sketches capture detailed information, but their highly abstract nature makes visual comparisons with images more difficult. In spite of the fact that the existing models take into account the fine-grained details, they can not accurately highlight the distinctive local features and ignore the correlation between features. To solve this problem, we design a gradually focused bilinear attention model to extract detailed information more effectively. Specifically, the attention model is to accurately focus on representative local positions, and then use the weighted bilinear coding to find more discriminative feature representations. Finally, the global triplet loss function is used to avoid oversampling or undersampling. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art sketch-based image retrieval methods."
https://openalex.org/W2947817958,"HIV-1 strain diversity in Bulgaria is extensive and includes contributions from nearly all major subtypes and the Circulating Recombinant Forms (CRF): 01_AE, 02_AG, and 05_DF. Prior to this study, HIV-1 sequence information from Bulgaria has been based solely on the pro-RT gene, which represent less than 15% of the viral genome. To further characterize HIV-1 in Bulgaria, assess participant risk behaviors, and strengthen knowledge of circulating strains in the region, the study ""Genetic Subtypes of HIV-1 in Bulgaria (RV240)"" was conducted. This study employed the real time-PCR based Multi-region Hybridization Assay (MHA) B/non-B and HIV-1 sequencing to survey 215 of the approximately 1100 known HIV-1 infected Bulgarian adults (2008-2009) and determine if they were infected with subtype B HIV-1. The results indicated a subtype B prevalence of 40% and demonstrate the application of the MHA B/non-B in an area containing broad HIV-1 strain diversity. Within the assessed risk behaviors, the proportion of subtype B infection was greatest in men who have sex with men and lowest among those with drug use risk factors. During this study, 15 near full-length genomes and 22 envelope sequences were isolated from study participants. Phylogenetic analysis shows the presence of subtypes A1, B, C, F1, and G, CRF01_AE, CRF02_AG, CRF05_DF, and one unique recombinant form (URF). These sequences also show the presence of two strain groups containing participants with similar risk factors. Previous studies in African and Asian cohorts have shown that co-circulation of multiple subtypes can lead to viral recombination within super-infected individuals and the emergence of new URFs. The low prevalence of URFs in the presence of high subtype diversity in this study, may be the result of successful infection prevention and control programs. Continued epidemiological monitoring and support of infection prevention programs will help maintain control of the HIV-1 epidemic in Bulgaria."
https://openalex.org/W2947692488,"Somatostatin (SST) is a cyclic peptide that is understood to inhibit the release of hormones and neurotransmitters from a variety of cells by binding to one of five canonical G protein-coupled SST receptors (SSTR1 to SSTR5). Recently, SST was also observed to interact with the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide and affect its aggregation kinetics, raising the possibility that it may bind other brain proteins. Here we report on an SST interactome analysis that made use of human brain extracts as biological source material and incorporated advanced mass spectrometry workflows for the relative quantitation of SST binding proteins. The analysis revealed SST to predominantly bind several members of the P-type family of ATPases. Subsequent validation experiments confirmed an interaction between SST and the sodium-potassium pump (Na+/K+-ATPase) and identified a tryptophan residue within SST as critical for binding. Functional analyses in three different cell lines indicated that SST might negatively modulate the K+ uptake rate of the Na+/K+-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W2947888928,"Background Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is causative for hypertensive anterior uveitis. Trabecular meshwork (TM) cells, which are the key cells regulating intraocular pressure (IOP), is considered to be the site of inflammation. We explored the profiles of genes expressed in human TM primary cells upon HSV-1 infection. Methods Human TM cells were infected with HSV-1 and total RNA was isolated. The global transcriptional gene network analyses were performed in mock-infected and HSV-1 infected TM cells. Using ingenuity pathway analysis, we determined the key biological networks upon HSV-1 infection. The results of microarray analyses were validated using quantitative PCR. Results TM cells had a high susceptibility to HSV-1 infection. HSV-1 induced transcriptional suppression of many components related to fibrosis in TM cells. The top biological network related to the genes which were significantly altered upon HSV-1 infection was organismal injury and abnormalities involving TGF-β1 and PDGF-BB. The results of PCR analyses for selected molecules were found to be in good agreement with the microarray data. HSV-1-infected TM cells showed an 80-fold increase in the expression of PDGF-BB, which was further increased by treatment with TGF-β1. HSV-1 also induced a 4-fold increase in the expression of the monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, the downstream molecules of PDGF-BB. Conclusions In human TM cells, HSV-1 induced transcriptional suppression of many components related to fibrosis and enhanced expression of both PDGF-BB and MCP-1. Our study may provide a novel mechanism for the pathogenesis of HSV-1 infection in TM cells."

This study aims to evaluate the genomic profile of meningococcal carriage isolates collected during the survey.Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed using Illumina MiSeq on 85 cultivated meningococcal carriage isolates received at the Dept. of Infectious Disease, National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanità, ISS), as National Reference Laboratory (NRL) for Invasive Meningococcal Disease (IMD). De novo assembled genomes were scanned by the BIGSdb platform to assign: the genotypic profiles, the cgMLST, the vaccine antigen variants and allele types of antimicrobial resistance associated genes, together with denitrification pathway loci.Capsule null and non-groupable meningococci accounted for 52.9% and 10.6%, respectively. Among the remaining carriage isolates, serogroup B was the predominant (71.0%). Serogroup C meningococci were culture negative and unavailable for WGS. Overall, 64 genotypic profiles were identified and, based on cgMLST, isolates clustered according to clonal complexes. Eight isolates (9.4%) harbored at least one gene encoding a 4CMenB vaccine antigen. Mutated penA alleles were found in more than 82%. Finally, complete aniA and norB coding sequences were detected among 71.8% of carriage isolates.Meningococcal carriage isolates collected during the MenC:cc11 outbreak were characterized by an extensive genetic diversity. The lack of outbreak-related isolates among carriage might be attributable to the high transmissibility with low duration of colonization of MenC:cc11 meningococci."
https://openalex.org/W2947560283,"Bread wheat (AABBDD) originated from the diploid progenitor Triticum urartu (AA), a relative of Aegilops speltoides (BB), and Ae. tauschii (DD). The DREB1 transcriptional factor plays key regulatory role in low-temperature tolerance. The modern breeding strategies resulted in serious decrease of the agricultural biodiversity, which led to a loss of elite genes underlying abiotic stress tolerance in crops. However, knowledge of this gene’s natural diversity is largely unknown in the genome donor species of wheat. We characterized the dehydration response element binding protein 1 (DREB1) gene-diversity pattern in Ae. speltoides, Ae. tauschii, T. monococcum and T. urartu. The highest nucleotide diversity value was detected in Ae. speltoides, followed by Ae. tauschii and T. monococcum. The lowest nucleotide diversity value was observed in T. urartu. Nucleotide diversity and haplotype data might suggest no reduction of nucleotide diversity during T. monococcum domestication. Alignment of the 68 DREB1 sequences found a large-size (70 bp) insertion/deletion in the accession PI486264 of Ae. speltoides, which was different from the copy of sequences from other accessions of Ae. speltoides, suggesting a likely existence of two different ancestral Ae. speltoides forms. Implication of sequences variation of Ae. speltoides on origination of B genome in wheat was discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2963606735,"The Internet provides students with a unique opportunity to connect and maintain social ties with peers from other schools, irrespective of how far they are from each other. However, little is known about the real structure of such online relationships. In this paper, we investigate the structure of interschool friendship on a popular social networking site. We use data from 36, 951 students from 590 schools of a large European city. We find that the probability of a friendship tie between students from neighboring schools is high and that it decreases with the distance between schools following the power law. We also find that students are more likely to be connected if the educational outcomes of their schools are similar. We show that this fact is not a consequence of residential segregation. While high- and low-performing schools are evenly distributed across the city, this is not the case for the digital space, where schools turn out to be segregated by educational outcomes. There is no significant correlation between the educational outcomes of a school and its geographical neighbors; however, there is a strong correlation between the educational outcomes of a school and its digital neighbors. These results challenge the common assumption that the Internet is a borderless space, and may have important implications for the understanding of educational inequality in the digital age."
