https://openalex.org/W2042951880,"Background To convert deserts into arable, green landscapes is a global vision, and desert farming is a strong growing area of agriculture world-wide. However, its effect on diversity of soil microbial communities, which are responsible for important ecosystem services like plant health, is still not known. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied the impact of long-term agriculture on desert soil in one of the most prominent examples for organic desert farming in Sekem (Egypt). Using a polyphasic methodological approach to analyse microbial communities in soil as well as associated with cultivated plants, drastic effects caused by 30 years of agriculture were detected. Analysing bacterial fingerprints, we found statistically significant differences between agricultural and native desert soil of about 60%. A pyrosequencing-based analysis of the 16S rRNA gene regions showed higher diversity in agricultural than in desert soil (Shannon diversity indices: 11.21/7.90), and displayed structural differences. The proportion of Firmicutes in field soil was significantly higher (37%) than in the desert (11%). Bacillus and Paenibacillus play the key role: they represented 96% of the antagonists towards phytopathogens, and identical 16S rRNA sequences in the amplicon library and for isolates were detected. The proportion of antagonistic strains was doubled in field in comparison to desert soil (21.6%/12.4%); disease-suppressive bacteria were especially enriched in plant roots. On the opposite, several extremophilic bacterial groups, e.g., Acidimicrobium, Rubellimicrobium and Deinococcus-Thermus, disappeared from soil after agricultural use. The N-fixing Herbaspirillum group only occurred in desert soil. Soil bacterial communities were strongly driven by the a-biotic factors water supply and pH. Conclusions/Significance After long-term farming, a drastic shift in the bacterial communities in desert soil was observed. Bacterial communities in agricultural soil showed a higher diversity and a better ecosystem function for plant health but a loss of extremophilic bacteria. Interestingly, we detected that indigenous desert microorganisms promoted plant health in desert agro-ecosystems."

Microbes in rivers perform essential ecosystem roles including the mineralization of significant quantities of organic matter originating from terrestrial habitats. The Amazon river in particular is famous for its size and importance in the mobilization of both water and carbon out of its enormous basin. Here we present the first metagenomic study on the microbiota of this river. It presents many features in common with the other freshwater metagenome available (Lake Gatun in Panama) and much less similarity with marine samples. Among the microbial taxa found, the cosmopolitan freshwater acI lineage of the actinobacteria was clearly dominant. Group I Crenarchaea and the freshwater sister group of the marine SAR11 clade, LD12, were found alongside more exclusive and well known freshwater taxa such as Polynucleobacter. A metabolism-centric analysis revealed a disproportionate representation of pathways involved in heterotrophic carbon processing, as compared to those found in marine samples. In particular, these river microbes appear to be specialized in taking up and mineralizing allochthonous carbon derived from plant material."
https://openalex.org/W2051560414,"Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) plays important structural and functional roles in plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) that is responsible for reverse cholesterol transport. However, a molecular understanding of HDL assembly and function remains enigmatic. The 2.2-Å crystal structure of Δ(185-243)apoA-I reported here shows that it forms a half-circle dimer. The backbone of the dimer consists of two elongated antiparallel proline-kinked helices (five AB tandem repeats). The N-terminal domain of each molecule forms a four-helix bundle with the helical C-terminal region of the symmetry-related partner. The central region forms a flexible domain with two antiparallel helices connecting the bundles at each end. The two-domain dimer structure based on helical repeats suggests the role of apoA-I in the formation of discoidal HDL particles. Furthermore, the structure suggests the possible interaction with lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase and may shed light on the molecular details of the effect of the Milano, Paris, and Fin mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2020186279,"Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive malignant tumor involving glial cells in the human brain. We used high-throughput sequencing to comprehensively profile the small RNAs expressed in glioblastoma and non-tumor brain tissues. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) made up the large majority of small RNAs, and we identified over 400 different cellular pre-miRNAs. No known viral miRNAs were detected in any of the samples analyzed. Cluster analysis revealed several miRNAs that were significantly down-regulated in glioblastomas, including miR-128, miR-124, miR-7, miR-139, miR-95, and miR-873. Post-transcriptional editing was observed for several miRNAs, including the miR-376 family, miR-411, miR-381, and miR-379. Using the deep sequencing information, we designed a lentiviral vector expressing a cell suicide gene, the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) gene, under the regulation of a miRNA, miR-128, that was found to be enriched in non-tumor brain tissue yet down-regulated in glioblastomas, Glioblastoma cells transduced with this vector were selectively killed when cultured in the presence of ganciclovir. Using an in vitro model to recapitulate expression of brain-enriched miRNAs, we demonstrated that neuronally differentiated SH-SY5Y cells transduced with the miRNA-regulated HSV-TK vector are protected from killing by expression of endogenous miR-128. Together, these results provide an in-depth analysis of miRNA dysregulation in glioblastoma and demonstrate the potential utility of these data in the design of miRNA-regulated therapies for the treatment of brain cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2145640842,"Hypoxia is one of the features of poorly vascularised areas of solid tumours but cancer cells can survive in these areas despite the low oxygen tension. The adaptation to hypoxia requires both biochemical and genetic responses that culminate in a metabolic rearrangement to counter-balance the decrease in energy supply from mitochondrial respiration. The understanding of metabolic adaptations under hypoxia could reveal novel pathways that, if targeted, would lead to specific death of hypoxic regions. In this study, we developed biochemical and metabolomic analyses to assess the effects of hypoxia on cellular metabolism of HCT116 cancer cell line. We utilized an oxygen fluorescent probe in anaerobic cuvettes to study oxygen consumption rates under hypoxic conditions without the need to re-oxygenate the cells and demonstrated that hypoxic cells can maintain active, though diminished, oxidative phosphorylation even at 1% oxygen. These results were further supported by in situ microscopy analysis of mitochondrial NADH oxidation under hypoxia. We then used metabolomic methodologies, utilizing liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS), to determine the metabolic profile of hypoxic cells. This approach revealed the importance of synchronized and regulated catabolism as a mechanism of adaptation to bioenergetic stress. We then confirmed the presence of autophagy under hypoxic conditions and demonstrated that the inhibition of this catabolic process dramatically reduced the ATP levels in hypoxic cells and stimulated hypoxia-induced cell death. These results suggest that under hypoxia, autophagy is required to support ATP production, in addition to glycolysis, and that the inhibition of autophagy might be used to selectively target hypoxic regions of tumours, the most notoriously resistant areas of solid tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2105718456,"N(ε)-Methylations of histone lysine residues play critical roles in cell biology by ""marking"" chromatin for transcriptional activation or repression. Lysine demethylases reverse N(ε)-methylation in a sequence- and methylation-selective manner. The determinants of sequence selectivity for histone demethylases have been unclear. The human JMJD2 (KDM4) H3K9 and H3K36 demethylases can be divided into members that act on both H3K9 and H3K36 and H3K9 alone. Kinetic, crystallographic, and mutagenetic studies in vitro and in cells on KDM4A-E reveal that selectivity is determined by multiple interactions within the catalytic domain but outside the active site. Structurally informed phylogenetic analyses reveal that KDM4A-C orthologues exist in all genome-sequenced vertebrates with earlier animals containing only a single KDM4 enzyme. KDM4D orthologues only exist in eutherians (placental mammals) where they are conserved, including proposed substrate sequence-determining residues. The results will be useful for the identification of inhibitors for specific histone demethylases."
https://openalex.org/W1968192565,"Type IV P-type ATPases (P4-ATPases) are putative phospholipid flippases that translocate phospholipids from the exoplasmic (lumenal) to the cytoplasmic leaflet of lipid bilayers and are believed to function in complex with CDC50 proteins. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, five P4-ATPases are localized to specific cellular compartments and are required for vesicle-mediated protein transport from these compartments, suggesting a role for phospholipid translocation in vesicular transport. The human genome encodes 14 P4-ATPases and three CDC50 proteins. However, the subcellular localization of human P4-ATPases and their interactions with CDC50 proteins are poorly understood. Here, we show that class 5 (ATP10A, ATP10B, and ATP10D) and class 6 (ATP11A, ATP11B, and ATP11C) P4-ATPases require CDC50 proteins, primarily CDC50A, for their exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and final subcellular localization. In contrast, class 2 P4-ATPases (ATP9A and ATP9B) are able to exit the ER in the absence of exogenous CDC50 expression: ATP9B, but not ATP11B, was able to exit the ER despite depletion of CDC50 proteins by RNAi. Although ATP9A and ATP9B show a high overall sequence similarity, ATP9A localizes to endosomes and the trans-Golgi network (TGN), whereas ATP9B localizes exclusively to the TGN. A chimeric ATP9 protein in which the N-terminal cytoplasmic region of ATP9A was replaced with the corresponding region of ATP9B was localized exclusively to the Golgi. These results indicate that ATP9B is able to exit the ER and localize to the TGN independently of CDC50 proteins and that this protein contains a Golgi localization signal in its N-terminal cytoplasmic region."
https://openalex.org/W2081349230,"Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive optical imaging technique that can be used to measure cortical hemodynamic responses to specific stimuli or tasks. While analyses of NIRS data are normally adapted from established fMRI techniques, there are nevertheless substantial differences between the two modalities. Here, we investigate the impact of NIRS-specific noise; e.g., systemic (physiological), motion-related artifacts, and serial autocorrelations, upon the validity of statistical inference within the framework of the general linear model. We present a comprehensive framework for noise reduction and statistical inference, which is custom-tailored to the noise characteristics of NIRS. These methods have been implemented in a public domain Matlab toolbox, the NIRS Analysis Package (NAP). Finally, we validate NAP using both simulated and actual data, showing marked improvement in the detection power and reliability of NIRS."
https://openalex.org/W2030533818,"Hyaluronan (HA) modulates key cancer cell functions through interaction with its CD44 and receptor for hyaluronic acid-mediated motility (RHAMM) receptors. HA was recently found to regulate the migration of fibrosarcoma cells in a manner specifically dependent on its size. Here, we investigated the effect of HA/RHAMM signaling on the ability of HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells to adhere onto fibronectin. Low molecular weight HA (LMWHA) significantly increased (p ≤ 0.01) the adhesion capacity of HT1080 cells, which high molecular weight HA inhibited. The ability of HT1080 RHAMM-deficient cells, but not of CD44-deficient ones, to adhere was significantly decreased (p ≤ 0.001) as compared with control cells. Importantly, the effect of LMWHA on HT1080 cell adhesion was completely attenuated in RHAMM-deficient cells. In contrast, adhesion of RHAMM-deficient cells was not sensitive to high molecular weight HA treatment, which identifies RHAMM as a specific conduit of the LMWHA effect. Western blot and real time-PCR analyses indicated that LMWHA significantly increased RHAMM transcript (p ≤ 0.05) and protein isoform levels (53%, 95 kDa; 37%, 73 kDa) in fibrosarcoma cells. Moreover, Western blot analyses showed that LMWHA in a RHAMM-dependent manner enhanced basal and adhesion-dependent ERK1/2 and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation in HT1080 cells. Utilization of a specific ERK1/2 inhibitor completely inhibited (p ≤ 0.001) LMWHA-dependent adhesion, suggesting that ERK1/2 is a downstream effector of LMWHA/RHAMM signaling. Likewise, the utilization of the specific ERK1 inhibitor resulted in a strong down-regulation of FAK activation in HT1080 cells, which identifies ERK1/2 as a FAK upstream activator. In conclusion, our results suggest that RHAMM/HA interaction regulates fibrosarcoma cell adhesion via the activation of FAK and ERK1/2 signaling pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2021538827,"Symbiotic interactions between ascidians (sea-squirts) and microbes are poorly understood. Here we characterized the cyanobacteria in the tissues of 8 distinct didemnid taxa from shallow-water marine habitats in the Bahamas Islands by sequencing a fragment of the cyanobacterial 16S rRNA gene and the entire 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and by examining symbiont morphology with transmission electron (TEM) and confocal microscopy (CM). As described previously for other species, Trididemnum spp. mostly contained symbionts associated with the Prochloron-Synechocystis group. However, sequence analysis of the symbionts in Lissoclinum revealed two unique clades. The first contained a novel cyanobacterial clade, while the second clade was closely associated with Acaryochloris marina. CM revealed the presence of chlorophyll d (chl d) and phycobiliproteins (PBPs) within these symbiont cells, as is characteristic of Acaryochloris species. The presence of symbionts was also observed by TEM inside the tunic of both the adult and larvae of L. fragile, indicating vertical transmission to progeny. Based on molecular phylogenetic and microscopic analyses, Candidatus Acaryochloris bahamiensis nov. sp. is proposed for this symbiotic cyanobacterium. Our results support the hypothesis that photosymbiont communities in ascidians are structured by host phylogeny, but in some cases, also by sampling location."
https://openalex.org/W2095960310,"The molecular adaptation of Staphylococcus aureus to its host during chronic infection is not well understood. Comparative genome sequencing of 3 S. aureus isolates obtained sequentially over 26 months from the airways of a cystic fibrosis patient, revealed variation in phage content, and genetic polymorphisms in genes which influence antibiotic resistance, and global regulation of virulence. The majority of polymorphisms were isolate-specific suggesting the existence of an heterogeneous infecting population that evolved from a single infecting strain of S. aureus. The genetic variation identified correlated with differences in growth rate, hemolytic activity, and antibiotic sensitivity, implying a profound effect on the ecology of S. aureus. In particular, a high frequency of mutations in loci associated with the alternate transcription factor SigB, were observed. The identification of genes under diversifying selection during long-term infection may inform the design of novel therapeutics for the control of refractory chronic infections."
https://openalex.org/W1973420791,"In most HCO(3)(-)-secreting epithelial tissues, SLC26 Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) transporters work in concert with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) to regulate the magnitude and composition of the secreted fluid, a process that is vital for normal tissue function. By contrast, CFTR is regarded as the only exit pathway for HCO(3)(-) in the airways. Here we show that Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) anion exchange makes a major contribution to transcellular HCO(3)(-) transport in airway serous cells. Real-time measurement of intracellular pH from polarized cultures of human Calu-3 cells demonstrated cAMP/PKA-activated Cl(-)-dependent HCO(3)(-) transport across the luminal membrane via CFTR-dependent coupled Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) anion exchange. The pharmacological and functional profile of the luminal anion exchanger was consistent with SLC26A4 (pendrin), which was shown to be expressed by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. Pendrin-mediated anion exchange activity was confirmed by shRNA pendrin knockdown (KD), which markedly reduced cAMP-activated Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange. To establish the relative roles of CFTR and pendrin in net HCO(3)(-) secretion, transepithelial liquid secretion rate and liquid pH were measured in wild type, pendrin KD, and CFTR KD cells. cAMP/PKA increased the rate and pH of the secreted fluid. Inhibiting CFTR reduced the rate of liquid secretion but not the pH, whereas decreasing pendrin activity lowered pH with little effect on volume. These results establish that CFTR predominately controls the rate of liquid secretion, whereas pendrin regulates the composition of the secreted fluid and identifies a critical role for this anion exchanger in transcellular HCO(3)(-) secretion in airway serous cells."
https://openalex.org/W2079755210,"Background DYT1 dystonia, a severe form of genetically determined human dystonia, exhibits reduced penetrance among carriers and begins usually during adolescence. The reasons for such age dependence and variability remain unclear. Methods and Results We characterized the alterations in D2 dopamine receptor (D2R) signalling in striatal cholinergic interneurons at different ages in mice overexpressing human mutant torsinA (hMT). An abnormal excitatory response to the D2R agonist quinpirole was recorded at postnatal day 14, consisting of a membrane depolarization coupled to an increase in spiking frequency, and persisted unchanged at 3 and 9 months in hMT mice, compared to mice expressing wild-type human torsinA and non-transgenic mice. This response was blocked by the D2R antagonist sulpiride and depended upon G-proteins, as it was prevented by intrapipette GDP-β-S. Patch-clamp recordings from dissociated interneurons revealed a significant increase in the Cav2.2-mediated current fraction at all ages examined. Consistently, chelation of intracellular calcium abolished the paradoxical response to quinpirole. Finally, no gross morphological changes were observed during development. Conclusions These results suggest that an imbalanced striatal dopaminergic/cholinergic signaling occurs early in DYT1 dystonia and persists along development, representing a susceptibility factor for symptom generation."
https://openalex.org/W2103446563,"Type 1 iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO1) catalyses the conversion of prohormone thyroxine to the active thyroid hormone 3,3′,5-triiodothyronine (T3), important regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation. DIO1 expression is reduced in the most common type of kidney neoplasia, clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC). MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at posttranscriptional levels. The aim of this study was to analyze the potential regulation of DIO1 expression by microRNAs in ccRCC. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that 3′UTR of the human DIO1 gene transcript contains miR-224 and miR-383 target sites, which are conserved across mammalian species. Semi-quantitative real-time PCR was used to analyze the expression of miR-224 and miR-383 in 32 samples of ccRCC tumors (T) and in 32 matched control (C) samples. We observed statistically significant (p = 0.0002) more than four fold increase in miR-224 expression and nearly two fold increase in miR-383 expression in samples T compared to samples C. Tumor specific changes in expression of miR-224 negatively correlated with changes in DIO1 expression and intracellular T3 concentration. Transfection of HeLa cell line with miR-224 and miR-383 suppressed the activity of a luciferase reporter containing the 3′UTR of DIO1. This was abolished when constructs mutated at the miR-224 and miR-383 target sites were used instead, indicating that miR-224 and miR-383 directly bind to DIO1 3′UTR. Finally, induced expression of miR-224 in Caki-2 cells resulted in significant (p<0.01) reduction of DIO1 mRNA. This study provides a novel miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanism of DIO1 expression in ccRCC."
https://openalex.org/W2016140632,"Authentic induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), capable of giving rise to all cell types of an adult animal, are currently only available in mouse. Here, we report the first generation of bovine iPSC-like cells following transfection with a novel virus-free poly-promoter vector. This vector contains the bovine cDNAs for OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC, each controlled by its own independent promoter. Bovine fibroblasts were cultured without feeders in a chemically defined medium containing leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and inhibitors of MEK1/2 and glycogen synthase kinase-3 signaling ('2i'). Non-invasive real-time kinetic profiling revealed a different response of bovine vs human and mouse cells to culture in 2i/LIF. In bovine, 2i was necessary and sufficient to induce the appearance of tightly packed alkaline phosphatase-positive iPSC-like colonies. These colonies formed in the absence of DNA synthesis and did not expand after passaging. Following transfection, non-proliferative primary colonies expressed discriminatory markers of pluripotency, including endogenous iPSC factors, CDH1, DPPA3, NANOG, SOCS3, ZFP42, telomerase activity, Tra-1-60/81 and SSEA-3/4, but not SSEA-1. This indicates that they had initiated a self-sustaining pluripotency programme. Bovine iPSC-like cells maintained a normal karyotype and differentiated into derivatives of all three germ layers in vitro and in teratomas. Our study demonstrates that conversion into induced pluripotency can occur in quiescent cells, following a previously undescribed route of direct cell reprogramming. This identifies a major species-specific barrier for generating iPSCs and provides a chemically defined screening platform for factors that induce proliferation and maintain pluripotency of embryo-derived pluripotent stem cells in livestock."
https://openalex.org/W2061786865,"Many diseases have complex genetic causes, where a set of alleles can affect the propensity of getting the disease. The identification of such disease genes is important to understand the mechanistic and evolutionary aspects of pathogenesis, improve diagnosis and treatment of the disease, and aid in drug discovery. Current genetic studies typically identify chromosomal regions associated specific diseases. But picking out an unknown disease gene from hundreds of candidates located on the same genomic interval is still challenging. In this study, we propose an approach to prioritize candidate genes by integrating data of gene expression level, protein-protein interaction strength and known disease genes. Our method is based only on two, simple, biologically motivated assumptions—that a gene is a good disease-gene candidate if it is differentially expressed in cases and controls, or that it is close to other disease-gene candidates in its protein interaction network. We tested our method on 40 diseases in 58 gene expression datasets of the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database. On these datasets our method is able to predict unknown disease genes as well as identifying pleiotropic genes involved in the physiological cellular processes of many diseases. Our study not only provides an effective algorithm for prioritizing candidate disease genes but is also a way to discover phenotypic interdependency, cooccurrence and shared pathophysiology between different disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2079217735,"The AAA (ATPase associated with various cellular activities) ATPase p97, also referred to as valosin-containing protein (VCP), mediates essential cellular processes, including ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation, and has been linked to several human proteinopathies. p97 interacts with multiple cofactors via its N-terminal (p97N) domain, a subset of which contain the VCP-interacting motif (VIM). We have determined the crystal structure of the p97N domain in complex with the VIM of the ubiquitin E3 ligase gp78 at 1.8 Å resolution. The α-helical VIM peptide binds into a groove located in between the two subdomains of the p97N domain. Interaction studies of several VIM proteins reveal that these cofactors display dramatically different affinities, ranging from high affinity interactions characterized by dissociation constants of ∼20 nm for gp78 and ANKZF1 to only weak binding in our assays. The contribution of individual p97 residues to VIM binding was analyzed, revealing that identical substitutions do not affect all cofactors in the same way. Taken together, the biochemical and structural studies define the framework for recognition of VIM-containing cofactors by p97. Of particular interest to the regulation of p97 by its cofactors, our structure reveals that the bound α-helical peptides of VIM-containing cofactors overlap with the binding site for cofactors containing the ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX) domain present in the UBX protein family or the ubiquitin-like domain of NPL4 as further corroborated by biochemical data. These results extend the concept that competitive binding is a crucial determinant in p97-cofactor interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1964076699,"To understand the mechanisms of ceramide-based responses to hypoxia, we performed a mass spectrometry-based survey of ceramide species elicited by a wide range of hypoxic conditions (0.2-5% oxygen). We describe a rapid, time-dependent, marked up-regulation of dihydroceramides (DHCs) in mammalian cells and in the lungs of hypoxic rats. The increase affected all DHC species and was proportional with the depth and duration of hypoxia, ranging from 2- (1 h) to 10-fold (24 h), with complete return to normal after 1 h of reoxygenation at the expense of increased ceramides. We demonstrate that a DHC-based response to hypoxia occurs in a hypoxia-inducible factor-independent fashion and is catalyzed by the DHC desaturase (DEGS) in the de novo ceramide pathway. Both the impact of hypoxia on DHC molecular species and its inhibitory effect on cell proliferation were reproduced by knockdown of DEGS1 or DEGS2 by siRNA during normoxia. Conversely, overexpression of DEGS1 or DEGS2 attenuated the DHC accumulation and increased cell proliferation during hypoxia. Based on the amplitude and kinetics of DHC accumulation, the enzymatic desaturation of DHCs fulfills the criteria of an oxygen sensor across physiological hypoxic conditions, regulating the balance between biologically active components of ceramide metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2020958147,"Background Appropriate nutrition during early development is essential for maximal bone mass accretion; however, linkage between early nutrition, childhood bone mass, peak bone mass in adulthood, and prevention of bone loss later in life has not been studied. Methodology and Principal Findings In this report, we show that feeding a high quality diet supplemented with blueberries (BB) to pre-pubertal rats throughout development or only between postnatal day 20 (PND20) and PND34 prevented ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone loss in adult life. This protective effect of BB is due to suppression of osteoblastic cell senescence associated with acute loss of myosin expression after OVX. Early exposure of pre-osteoblasts to serum from BB-fed rats was found to consistently increase myosin expression. This led to maintenance osteoblastic cell development and differentiation and delay of cellular entrance into senescence through regulation of the Runx2 gene. High bone turnover after OVX results in insufficient collagenous matrix support for new osteoblasts and their precursors to express myosin and other cytoskeletal elements required for osteoblast activity and differentiation. Conclusions/Significance These results indicate: 1) a significant prevention of OVX-induced bone loss from adult rats can occur with only 14 days consumption of a BB-containing diet immediately prior to puberty; and 2) the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects involves increased myosin production which stimulates osteoblast differentiation and reduces mesenchymal stromal cell senescence."
https://openalex.org/W1969658114,"The long pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a soluble recognition molecule with multiple functions including innate immune defense against certain microbes and the clearance of apoptotic cells. PTX3 interacts with recognition molecules of the classical and lectin complement pathways and thus initiates complement activation. In addition, binding of PTX3 to the alternative complement pathway regulator factor H was shown. Here, we show that PTX3 binds to the classical and lectin pathway regulator C4b-binding protein (C4BP). A PTX3-binding site was identified within short consensus repeats 1–3 of the C4BP α-chain. PTX3 did not interfere with the cofactor activity of C4BP in the fluid phase and C4BP maintained its complement regulatory activity when bound to PTX3 on surfaces. While C4BP and factor H did not compete for PTX3 binding, the interaction of C4BP with PTX3 was inhibited by C1q and by L-ficolin. PTX3 bound to human fibroblast- and endothelial cell-derived extracellular matrices and recruited functionally active C4BP to these surfaces. Whereas PTX3 enhanced the activation of the classical/lectin pathway and caused enhanced C3 deposition on extracellular matrix, deposition of terminal pathway components and the generation of the inflammatory mediator C5a were not increased. Furthermore, PTX3 enhanced the binding of C4BP to late apoptotic cells, which resulted in an increased rate of inactivation of cell surface bound C4b and a reduction in the deposition of C5b-9. Thus, in addition to complement activators, PTX3 interacts with complement inhibitors including C4BP. This balanced interaction on extracellular matrix and on apoptotic cells may prevent excessive local complement activation that would otherwise lead to inflammation and host tissue damage."
https://openalex.org/W1991520943,"Gene tagging facilitates systematic genomic and proteomic analyses but chromosomal tagging typically disrupts gene regulatory sequences. Here we describe a seamless gene tagging approach that preserves endogenous gene regulation and is potentially applicable in any species with efficient DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination. We implement seamless tagging in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and demonstrate its application for protein tagging while preserving simultaneously upstream and downstream gene regulatory elements. Seamless tagging is compatible with high-throughput strain construction using synthetic genetic arrays (SGA), enables functional analysis of transcription antisense to open reading frames and should facilitate systematic and minimally-invasive analysis of gene functions."
https://openalex.org/W2026498255,"Fascin, an actin-bundling protein overexpressed in all carcinomas, has been associated with poor prognosis, shorter survival, and more metastatic diseases. It is believed that fascin facilitates tumor metastasis by promoting the formation of invasive membrane protrusions. However, the mechanisms by which fascin is overexpressed in tumors are not clear. TGFβ is a cytokine secreted by tumor and mesenchymal cells and promotes metastasis in many late stage tumors. The pro-metastasis mechanisms of TGFβ remain to be fully elucidated. Here we demonstrated that TGFβ induced fascin expression in spindle-shaped tumor cells through the canonical Smad-dependent pathway. Fascin was critical for TGFβ-promoted filopodia formation, migration, and invasion in spindle tumor cells. More importantly, fascin expression significantly correlates with TGFβ1 and TGFβ receptor I levels in a cohort of primary breast tumor samples. Our results indicate that elevated TGFβ level in the tumor microenvironment may be responsible for fascin overexpression in some of the metastatic tumors. Our data also suggest that fascin could play a central role in TGFβ-promoted tumor metastasis."

Although regulation of cardiac contraction by individual PI3K isoforms has been studied, little is known about the cardiac consequences of downregulating multiple PI3Ks concurrently. Methods and Results Genetic ablation of both p110α and p110β in cardiac myocytes throughout development or in adult mice caused heart failure and death. Ventricular myocytes from double knockout animals showed transverse tubule (T-tubule) loss and disorganization, misalignment of L-type Ca2+ channels in the T-tubules with ryanodine receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and reduced Ca2+ transients and contractility. Junctophilin-2, which is thought to tether T-tubules to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, was mislocalized in the double PI3K-null myocytes without a change in expression level. Conclusions PI3K p110α and p110β are required to maintain the organized network of T-tubules that is vital for efficient Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release and ventricular contraction. PI3Ks maintain T-tubule organization by regulating junctophilin-2 localization. These results could have important medical implications because several PI3K inhibitors that target both isoforms are being used to treat cancer patients in clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2036216887,"GlgE is a recently identified (1→4)-α-d-glucan:phosphate α-d-maltosyltransferase involved in α-glucan biosynthesis in bacteria and is a genetically validated anti-tuberculosis drug target. It is a member of the GH13_3 CAZy subfamily for which no structures were previously known. We have solved the structure of GlgE isoform I from Streptomyces coelicolor and shown that this enzyme has the same catalytic and very similar kinetic properties to GlgE from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The S. coelicolor enzyme forms a homodimer with each subunit comprising five domains, including a core catalytic α-amylase-type domain A with a (β/α)8 fold. This domain is elaborated with domain B and two inserts that are specifically configured to define a well conserved donor pocket capable of binding maltose. Domain A, together with domain N from the neighboring subunit, forms a hydrophobic patch that is close to the maltose-binding site and capable of binding cyclodextrins. Cyclodextrins competitively inhibit the binding of maltooligosaccharides to the S. coelicolor enzyme, showing that the hydrophobic patch overlaps with the acceptor binding site. This patch is incompletely conserved in the M. tuberculosis enzyme such that cyclodextrins do not inhibit this enzyme, despite acceptor length specificity being conserved. The crystal structure reveals two further domains, C and S, the latter being a helix bundle not previously reported in GH13 members. The structure provides a framework for understanding how GlgE functions and will help guide the development of inhibitors with therapeutic potential.

The crucial need to develop new drugs against tuberculosis (1Koul A. Arnoult E. Lounis N. Guillemont J. Andries K. Nature. 2011; 469: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), one of the world's most pervasive and lethal infectious diseases (2Dye C. Lancet. 2006; 367: 938-940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), drives much research into the causative agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In this context, we recently identified a new α-glucan pathway in this bacterium (Fig. 1) (3Kalscheuer R. Syson K. Veeraraghavan U. Weinrick B. Biermann K.E. Liu Z. Sacchettini J.C. Besra G. Bornemann S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Its defining enzyme, GlgE, is a (1→4)-α-d-glucan:phosphate α-d-maltosyltransferase and member of the glycoside hydrolase family subfamily GH13_3 (4Stam M.R. Danchin E.G. Rancurel C. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2006; 19: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). It is capable of transferring maltosyl units not only from maltose 1-phosphate to maltooligosaccharides but also between maltooligosaccharides. We have genetically validated GlgE to be a potential new drug target (3Kalscheuer R. Syson K. Veeraraghavan U. Weinrick B. Biermann K.E. Liu Z. Sacchettini J.C. Besra G. Bornemann S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) that has some attractive features as discussed at length elsewhere (5Kalscheuer R. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Drug News Perspect. 2010; 23: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The bactericidal mechanism of the blockage of GlgE is novel because rather than preventing the formation of an essential metabolic product, it is the auto-amplified build up of GlgE's donor substrate, maltose 1-phosphate, that leads to pleiotropic effects, toxicity and cell death. The GlgE pathway generates a branched α-glucan from trehalose (Fig. 1) (3Kalscheuer R. Syson K. Veeraraghavan U. Weinrick B. Biermann K.E. Liu Z. Sacchettini J.C. Besra G. Bornemann S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). M. tuberculosis is known to produce three α-glucans as follows: cytosolic glycogen, capsular α-glucan, and methylglucose lipopolysaccharide (6Chandra G. Chater K.F. Bornemann S. Microbiology. 2011; 157: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These are either involved or implicated in the storage of carbon (7Preiss J. Schaechter M.

Chem. 2009; 284: 1949-1953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), respectively. It is not yet known how much the GlgE pathway contributes to the biosynthesis of each of the three α-glucans. Nevertheless, synthetic lethality has been observed between the GlgE and methylglucose lipopolysaccharide pathways, implying the essentiality of at least one type of α-glucan and the role of GlgE in its biosynthesis (3Kalscheuer R. Syson K. Veeraraghavan U. Weinrick B. Biermann K.E. Liu Z. Sacchettini J.C. Besra G. Bornemann S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The GlgE pathway is present in many other actinomycetes. For example, it is involved in carbon management in Streptomyces coelicolor (13Plaskitt K.A. Chater K.F. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1995; 347: 105-121Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Schneider D. Bruton C.J. Chater K.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Yeo M. Chater K. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The genes of this pathway are duplicated and separately and developmentally regulated in this organism, such that each is respectively associated with transient glycogen deposition at the initiation of aerial growth (phase I) and during the first stages of sporulation (phase II). The pathway is not restricted to actinomycetes and is remarkably widespread (6Chandra G. Chater K.F. Bornemann S. Microbiology. 2011; 157: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fourteen percent of sequenced microbial genomes contain all of the GlgE pathway genes, which are usually clustered, making the pathway half as common as the more well known glycogen pathway involving GlgA and GlgC. Structures have not previously been reported for GlgE or any other GH13_3 subfamily member. In parallel studies of the mycobacterial and Streptomyces GlgE enzymes, we have found that S. coelicolor GlgE isoform I is particularly amenable to structural analysis. This enzyme comprises domains in common with other members of the GH13 α-amylase family of enzymes together with a helix bundle domain that is novel in this structural context. The location of the donor-binding site has been defined together with a site capable of binding cyclodextrins that overlaps with the acceptor-binding site. The structure is consistent with evidence that maltooligosaccharide acceptors are extended at their nonreducing ends. The S. coelicolor and M. tuberculosis GlgE enzymes have the same catalytic and very similar kinetic properties, with well conserved donor-binding sites. This allows the structure of the former to be used to guide inhibitor development for the latter in the search for new therapies against tuberculosis. α- and β-maltose 1-phosphate, 1a and 1b, were synthesized from 2,3,6,2′,3′,4′,6′-hepta-O-acetyl-d-maltose (2) that was readily prepared from d-maltose using known procedures (see supplemental “Experimental Procedures for details of preparation of 2) (16Damager I. Numao S. Chen H. Brayer G.D. Withers S.G. Carbohydr. Res. 2004; 339: 1727-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). α-Maltosyl fluoride (17Jünnemann J. Thiem J. Pedersen C. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 249: 91-94Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was prepared via 2,3,6,2′,3′,4′,6′-hepta-O-acetyl-α-d-maltosyl fluoride using published procedures (18Genghof D.S. Brewer C.F. Hehre E.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1978; 61: 291-299Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). TLC was performed on pre-coated silica plates (Merck 60 F254, 0.25 mm) containing a fluorescence indicator. Compounds were visualized under UV light (254 nm) and/or by heating after dipping in a solution of 5% H2SO4 in ethanol. Flash column chromatography was performed on silica gel columns (Biotage KP-SilTM Silica, 60 Å, 32–63 μm) fitted to a Biotage SP1® automated purification system (Uppsala, Sweden). High resolution MS was carried out using a Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA) LTQ Orbitrap XL. Low resolution mass spectra were recorded with a Thermo Fisher Scientific Finnigan LCQ Deca XP Plus ion trap mass spectrometer. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 300 K on a Bruker Avance II 600 MHz spectrometer with Bruker TCI cryoprobe (Bruker Biospin Ltd.). Water peaks were suppressed with presaturation, and data were analyzed with Topspin 2.1 software (Bruker Biospin Ltd.). Chemical shifts are reported in parts/million relative to tetramethylsilane (δH 0.0) or, for samples in D2O, residual water (δH 4.70). Full assignment of 1H and 13C spectra was achieved with the aid of COSY, DEPT, HMBC, HSQC, and HSQC-TOCSY experiments. 31P spectra were obtained at 161 MHz on a Bruker Avance III 400 MHz spectrometer with and without decoupling and were referenced with external D3PO4 (δP 0.0). J values are in Hz. Lithium diisopropylamide (4.15 ml of a 2 m solution in tetrahydrofuran/heptane/ethylbenzene (Sigma), 8.3 mmol) was slowly added to a solution of anhydrous 2,3,6,2′,3′,4′,6′-hepta-O-acetyl-d-maltose (2) (3.1 g, 4.9 mmol), in the minimum volume of absolute tetrahydrofuran required to solubilize it (220 ml) at −80 °C under a N2 atmosphere. After 10 min of stirring, a solution of tetrabenzyl pyrophosphate (3.7 g, 6.9 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (20 ml) was slowly added with cooling. The mixture was stirred with continued cooling for 40 min before being allowed to slowly warm to 4 °C followed by stirring for 16 h. An off-white precipitate of LiOP(O)(OBn)2 was removed by filtration. The resulting solution was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, and the product was re-dissolved in ethyl acetate (20 ml). The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (20 ml) followed by saturated aqueous NaCl (20 ml) and dried over Na2SO4. After filtration, the solution was evaporated to dryness. The residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (50–70% ethyl acetate gradient in n-hexane). The overall isolated yield of the anomeric mixture 3 was 51%, β/α ratio ∼2:1 according to 31P NMR spectroscopy, m/z (HR ESI+) 919.2397 ([M + Na]+; C40H49NaO21P requires 919.2396). The α and β phosphate anomers, 3a and 3b, were partially separated with the β anomer 3b eluting first. Fractions containing a given anomer were enriched by repeating the chromatographic step twice. Anomer-enriched samples were evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. Each anomer was further purified by HPLC using a Phenomenex semi-preparative silica column (Luna 250 × 10 mm, 10 μm) fitted to a Dionex Ultimate 3000. Compounds were eluted with 20% ethyl acetate in n-hexane followed by a 60–67% ethyl acetate gradient and monitored by UV absorbance at 265 nm giving the α anomer 3a, δH (600 MHz; CDCl3) 7.40–7.36 (10 H, m, 2 C6H5), 5.82 (1 H, dd, J1,2 3.4, J1,P 7.0, 1-H), 5.54 (1 H, dd, J2,3 10.0, J3,4 10.0, 3-H), 5.42 (1 H, d, J1′,2′ 4.0, 1′-H), 5.37 (1 H, dd, J2′,3′ 10.0, J3′,4′ 10.0, 3′-H), 5.13 (1 H, m, 4′-H), 5.09 (4 H, m, 2 CH2C6H5), 4.88 (1 H, dd, J1,2 3.4, J2,3 10.0, 2-H), 4.84 (1 H, dd, J1′,2′ 4.0, J2′,3′ 10.0, 2′-H), 4.30 (1 H, dd, J5,6a 2.4, J6a,6b 12.4, 6a-H), 4.24 (1 H, dd, J5′,6′a 3.5, J6′a,6′b 12.4, 6′a-H), 4.11 (1 H, dd, J5,6b 3.5, J6a,6b 12.4, 6b-H), 4.02 (1 H, dd, J5′,6′b 3.5, J6′a,6′b 12.4, 6′b-H), 4.00 (1 H, dd, J3,4 10.0, J4,5 10.0, 4-H), 3.95 (1 H, m, 5-H), 3.90 (1 H, m, 5′-H), 2.10 (3 H, s, CH3), 2.08 (3 H, s, CH3), 2.07 (3 H, s, CH3), 2.04 (3 H, s, CH3), 2.021 (3 H, s, CH3), 2.016 (3 H, s, CH3), 1.88 (3 H, s, CH3); δC (150 MHz; CDCl3) 170.6 (COCH3), 170.5 (COCH3), 170.3 (COCH3), 169.9 (2 C, COCH3), 169.8 (COCH3), 169.4 (COCH3), 128.8–128.0 (C6H5), 95.7 (1′-C), 93.8 (1-C), 71.8 (4-C), 71.7 (3-C), 70.0 (2-C), 70.0 (2′-C), 69.74 (CH2C6H5), 69.69 (5-C), 69.3 (3′-C), 68.6 (5′-C), 67.9 (4′-C), 62.1 (6-C), 61.3 (6′-C), 29.7 (CH3), 20.9 (CH3), 20.72 (CH3), 20.69 (CH3), 20.64 (CH3), 20.61 (CH3), 20.3 (CH3); δP (161 MHz; CDCl3) −2.8 (dd, J1H,P 7.0, JBn,P ∼7.8); m/z (ESI+) 919.4 ([M + Na]+, 100%), 641.5 (9Gagliardi M.C.

The genes for both isoforms of GlgE from S. coelicolor strain M145 were each subcloned into a pET15b vector using BamHI and NdeI restriction sites to allow the expression of the enzyme with an N-terminal His tag and thrombin cleavage site. Both glgE genes in the final expression plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Protein expression was carried out as described previously (3Kalscheuer R. Syson K. Veeraraghavan U. Weinrick B.

Pi was removed from buffers using a “Pi mop” consisting of bacterial purine nucleotide phosphorylase and 1 mm 7-methylguanosine (21Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R.

Size exclusion chromatography was carried out using a Superdex 200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) using 100 mm Bistris propane buffer, pH 7.0, containing 50 mm NaCl. Dynamic light scattering was carried out using a DynaPro Titan molecular sizing instrument at 298 K (Wyatt Technology) with an enzyme concentration of 2 mg ml−1 in the buffer described above. Data were analyzed using the DYNAMICS software package (Wyatt Technology). Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were performed using a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (High Wycombe, United Kingdom) equipped with absorbance optics and an An-50 Ti rotor. Experiments were performed at 20 °C and 10,000 rpm with a protein concentration of 1 mg ml−1 in 20 mm Bistris propane, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm NaCl. The partial specific volume of GlgE was calculated from the amino acid sequence using SEDNTERP. UltraScan II was used to fit the experimental sedimentation equilibrium profiles to a single species model. Crystallization screens and optimizations were performed using a protein concentration of ∼5 mg ml−1 and a temperature of 20 °C. Crystals of GlgE (both apo- and selenomethionine-labeled) were obtained from 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.2 m sodium citrate, and 15% ethylene glycol. Ligand-bound structures of GlgE were obtained by co-crystallization under the same conditions with ligand concentrations of 5 mm. All crystals were flash-cooled in Litholoops (Molecular Dimensions) by plunging into liquid nitrogen and transported in Unipuck cassettes before being robotically mounted onto the goniostat on either station I02, I03, or I04 at the Diamond Light Source (Oxford, UK), whereupon they were maintained at −173 °C with a Cryojet cryocooler (Oxford Instruments). Diffraction data were recorded using an ADSC Quantum 315 CCD detector. The resultant data were integrated using MOSFLM (22Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) and scaled with SCALA (23Evans P. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3739) Google Scholar). Analysis in POINTLESS (23Evans P. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3739) Google Scholar) suggested that the space group was P41212/P43212, although statistical tests in TRUNCATE (24French S. Wilson K. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1978; 34: 517-525Crossref Scopus (891) Google Scholar) indicated that the crystals were usually hemihedrally twinned (operator, k, h, −l), and must therefore belong to a lower symmetry space group. Nevertheless, it proved to be more tractable to determine experimental phases and build a preliminary model in P41212/P43212. A three-wavelength anomalous dispersion data set was collected to 2.8 Å resolution from a single crystal of selenomethionine-substituted protein (supplemental Table S1). The data were processed in space group P422 with approximate cell parameters of a = b = 113.8 Å, c = 316.7 Å. Experimental phases were determined using the SHELX suite (25Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 2008; 64: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (80491) Google Scholar). The two possible enantiomorphs gave comparable statistics; however, P41212 was ultimately chosen based on superior electron density map quality. SHELXD located 15 selenium sites, being consistent with two copies of the GlgE protomer (based on eight methionines per subunit) in the asymmetric unit, with a corresponding solvent content of 63% (based on a subunit molecular mass of 75,290 Da). After phasing with SHELXE and density modification, with 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry averaging in DM (26Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar), the figure-of-merit was 0.794 to 2.8 Å resolution. After automated building with BUCCANEER (27Cowtan K.

Acta Crystallogr.

Several data sets were collected from crystals obtained by co-crystallization with potential ligands. Of these, only the complex with α-cyclodextrin alone yielded a data set that was essentially untwinned and therefore could be justifiably treated as belonging to space group P41212. This data set was collected to 2.3 Å resolution and was used to complete the building and refinement of the first GlgE model. This was performed with REFMAC5 using 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry restraints, and TLS parameters (four domains per monomer). The final model consisted of 1298 residues in two subunits and two α-cyclodextrin molecules, having final Rwork and Rfree values of 17.3 and 20.1%, respectively (Table 2). From inspection, the biological unit of GlgE is a homodimer. However, the two subunits in the asymmetric unit of this model represent halves of two separate dimers, with individual dimers being completed through the application of 2-fold crystallographic symmetry.TABLE 2Summary of GlgE x-ray data for refinement and model parametersData setApo-GlgEαCD-GlgEmal-GlgEαCD-mal-GlgEβCD-mal-GlgEData collection Space groupaSpace group that was used for refinement.P212121P41212P212121P212121P212121 Cell parametersa = 113.1, b = 113.0, c = 314.2 Åa = b = 113.2, c = 314.5 Åa = 113.8, b = 113.6, c = 315.7 Åa = 113.9, b = 114.2, c = 315.6 Åa = 113.3, b = 113.4, c = 315.0 Å BeamlinebI02, I03, I04 = beamlines at the Diamond Light Source (Oxfordshire, UK).I03I02I04I04I02 Wavelength0.9709 Å0.9795 Å0.9763 Å0.9763 Å0.9795 Å Resolution rangecThe figures in parentheses indicate the values for ou"
https://openalex.org/W2145972397,"Background Pre- and early clinical studies on patients with autoimmune diseases suggested that induction of regulatory T(Treg) cells may contribute to the immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids(GCs). Objective We readdressed the influence of GC therapy on Treg cells in immunocompetent human subjects and naïve mice. Methods Mice were treated with increasing doses of intravenous dexamethasone followed by oral taper, and Treg cells in spleen and blood were analyzed by FACS. Sixteen patients with sudden hearing loss but without an inflammatory disease received high-dose intravenous prednisolone followed by stepwise dose reduction to low oral prednisolone. Peripheral blood Treg cells were analyzed prior and after a 14 day GC therapy based on different markers. Results Repeated GC administration to mice for three days dose-dependently decreased the absolute numbers of Treg cells in blood (100 mg dexamethasone/kg body weight: 2.8±1.8×104 cells/ml vs. 33±11×104 in control mice) and spleen (dexamethasone: 2.8±1.9×105/spleen vs. 95±22×105/spleen in control mice), which slowly recovered after 14 days taper in spleen but not in blood. The relative frequency of FOXP3+ Treg cells amongst the CD4+ T cells also decreased in a dose dependent manner with the effect being more pronounced in blood than in spleen. The suppressive capacity of Treg cells was unaltered by GC treatment in vitro. In immunocompetent humans, GCs induced mild T cell lymphocytosis. However, it did not change the relative frequency of circulating Treg cells in a relevant manner, although there was some variation depending on the definition of the Treg cells (FOXP3+: 4.0±1.5% vs 3.4±1.5%*; AITR+: 0.6±0.4 vs 0.5±0.3%, CD127low: 4.0±1.3 vs 5.0±3.0%* and CTLA4+: 13.8±11.5 vs 15.6±12.5%; * p<0.05). Conclusion Short-term GC therapy does not induce the hitherto supposed increase in circulating Treg cell frequency, neither in immunocompetent humans nor in mice. Thus, it is questionable that the clinical efficacy of GCs is achieved by modulating Treg cell numbers."
https://openalex.org/W2035594907,"We identified that the angiotensin receptor antagonist, candesartan, has profound neurovascular protective properties when administered after ischemic stroke and was associated with a proangiogenic state at least partly explained by vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA). However, the spatial distribution of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) isoforms and their receptors remained unknown. Protein analysis identified a significant increase in vascular endothelial grow factor B (VEGFB) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the ischemic hemispheres (with increased VEGF receptor 1 activation) of treated animals (p<0.05) which was co-occurring with an increase in protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation (p<0.05). An increase in VEGFA protein in the contralesional hemisphere corresponded to a significant increase in vascular density at seven days (p<0.01) after stroke onset. Vascular restoration by candesartan after stroke maybe related to differential regional upregulation of VEGFB and VEGFA, promoting a ""prosurvival state"" in the ischemic hemisphere and angiogenesis in the contralesional side, respectively. These vascular changes in both hemispheres after effective treatment are likely to contribute to enhanced recovery after stroke."

Previous studies on the first enzyme in the glyoxalase system, glyoxalase I (GlxI), from yeast, protozoa, animals, humans, plants, and Gram-negative bacteria, have suggested two metal activation classes, Zn2+ and non-Zn2+ activation. Here, we report a biochemical and structural investigation of the GlxI from Clostridium acetobutylicum, which is the first GlxI enzyme from Gram-positive bacteria that has been fully characterized as to its three-dimensional structure and its detailed metal specificity. It is a Ni2+/Co2+-activated enzyme, in which the active site geometry forms an octahedral coordination with one metal atom, two water molecules, and four metal-binding ligands, although its inactive Zn2+-bound form possesses a trigonal bipyramidal geometry with only one water molecule liganded to the metal center. This enzyme also possesses a unique dimeric molecular structure. Unlike other small homodimeric GlxI where two active sites are located at the dimeric interface, the C. acetobutylicum dimeric GlxI enzyme also forms two active sites but each within single subunits. Interestingly, even though this enzyme possesses a different dimeric structure from previously studied GlxI, its metal activation characteristics are consistent with properties of other GlxI. These findings indicate that metal activation profiles in this class of enzyme hold true across diverse quaternary structure arrangements.

https://openalex.org/W2135828825,"Thyroid hormone is a major determinant of energy expenditure and a key regulator of mitochondrial activity. We have previously identified a mitochondrial triiodothyronine receptor (p43) that acts as a mitochondrial transcription factor of the organelle genome, which leads, in vitro and in vivo, to a stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. Here we generated mice specifically lacking p43 to address its physiological influence. We found that p43 is required for normal glucose homeostasis. The p43(-/-) mice had a major defect in insulin secretion both in vivo and in isolated pancreatic islets and a loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Moreover, a high-fat/high-sucrose diet elicited more severe glucose intolerance than that recorded in normal animals. In addition, we observed in p43(-/-) mice both a decrease in pancreatic islet density and in the activity of complexes of the respiratory chain in isolated pancreatic islets. These dysfunctions were associated with a down-regulation of the expression of the glucose transporter Glut2 and of Kir6.2, a key component of the K(ATP) channel. Our findings establish that p43 is an important regulator of glucose homeostasis and pancreatic β-cell function and provide evidence for the first time of a physiological role for a mitochondrial endocrine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2105187639,"Despite proposed ecological importance of mucilage in seed dispersal, germination and seedling establishment, little is known about the role of mucilage in seed pre-germination processes. Here we investigated the role of mucilage in assisting achene cells to repair DNA damage during dew deposition in the desert. Artemisia sphaerocephala achenes were first treated γ-irradiation to induce DNA damage, and then they were repaired in situ in the desert dew. Dew deposition duration can be as long as 421 min in early mornings. Intact achenes absorbed more water than demucilaged achenes during dew deposition and also carried water for longer time following sunrise. After 4-d dew treatment, DNA damage of irradiated intact and demucilaged achenes was reduced to 24.38% and 46.84%, respectively. The irradiated intact achenes exhibited much higher DNA repair ratio than irradiated demucilaged achenes. Irradiated intact achenes showed an improved germination and decreased nonviable achenes after dew treatment, and significant differences in viability between the two types of achenes were detected after 1020 min of dew treatment. Achene mucilage presumably plays an ecologically important role in the life cycle of A. sphaerocephala by aiding DNA repair of achene cells in genomic-stressful habitats."
https://openalex.org/W1981574139,"Insulin activation of mTOR complex 1 is accompanied by enhanced binding of substrates. We examined the mechanism and contribution of this enhancement to insulin activation of mTORC1 signaling in 293E and HeLa cells. In 293E, insulin increased the amount of mTORC1 retrieved by the transiently expressed nonphosphorylatable 4E-BP[5A] to an extent that varied inversely with the amount of PRAS40 bound to mTORC1. RNAi depletion of PRAS40 enhanced 4E-BP[5A] binding to ∼70% the extent of maximal insulin, and PRAS40 RNAi and insulin together did not increase 4E-BP[5A] binding beyond insulin alone, suggesting that removal of PRAS40 from mTORC1 is the predominant mechanism of an insulin-induced increase in substrate access. As regards the role of increased substrate access in mTORC1 signaling, RNAi depletion of PRAS40, although increasing 4E-BP[5A] binding, did not stimulate phosphorylation of endogenous mTORC1 substrates S6K1(Thr389) or 4E-BP (Thr37/Thr46), the latter already ∼70% of maximal in amino acid replete, serum-deprived 293E cells. In HeLa cells, insulin and PRAS40 RNAi also both enhanced the binding of 4E-BP[5A] to raptor but only insulin stimulated S6K1 and 4E-BP phosphorylation. Furthermore, Rheb overexpression in 293E activated mTORC1 signaling completely without causing PRAS40 release. In the presence of Rheb and insulin, PRAS40 release is abolished by Akt inhibition without diminishing mTORC1 signaling. In conclusion, dissociation of PRAS40 from mTORC1 and enhanced mTORC1 substrate binding results from Akt and mTORC1 activation and makes little or no contribution to mTORC1 signaling, which rather is determined by Rheb activation of mTOR catalytic activity, through mechanisms that remain to be fully elucidated.

Binding occurs through one or more short motifs on these substrates, the best characterized being the so-called TOS motif (18Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr.

The binding of PRAS40 to raptor depends on a variant TOS motif, Phe-Val-Met-Asp-Glu (11Oshiro N. Takahashi R. Yoshino K. Tanimura K. Nakashima A. Eguchi S. Miyamoto T. Hara K. Takehana K. Avruch J.

In turn, mTOR-catalyzed phosphorylation strongly promotes the dissociation of these substrates from raptor. target of rapamycin mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 tuberous sclerosis complex immunoprecipitation Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline S6 kinase 1 TOR signaling. The activity of mTORC1 is controlled by a variety of inputs; insulin and growth factors up-regulate mTORC1 activity, whereas stressors such as hypoxia, energy depletion, glucocorticoids, and TNFα suppress mTORC1 activity (1Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N. Cell. 2006; 124: 471-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4743) Google Scholar). This regulation is accomplished primarily or exclusively by regulating the activity of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/TSC2), which is the GTPase activator for the small GTPase Rheb (19Huang J. Manning B.D. Biochem. J. 2008; 412: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Rheb-GTP is a proximal activator of mTORC1, through its direct binding to the mTOR catalytic domain (20Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar) and by additional mechanisms, such as the generation of phosphatidic acid by Rheb activation of PL-D1 (21Sun Y.

Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In cells deficient in TSC function, mTORC1 is constitutively active and the impact of these upstream inputs is greatly attenuated or eliminated. By contrast, withdrawal of amino acids (or just leucine) is a potent inhibitor of mTORC1 signaling (23Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol.

Bos J.L. Zwartkruis F.J. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 657-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, amino acid withdrawal interferes with the ability of Rheb-GTP to bind and activate mTORC1 (26Long X. Ortiz-Vega S. Lin Y. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23433-23436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar); the inhibitory effect of amino acid withdrawal on mTORC1 can be overcome by overexpression of mutant active forms of the rag GTPases (27Kim E.

Several observations point to the possibility that the activation of mTORC1 signaling, i.e. mTORC1 kinase activity in vivo, in addition to an activation/disinhibition of the mTOR catalytic domain, involves an enhancement of mTORC1 substrate binding capacity. Early work demonstrated that overexpression of S6K1 inhibited the mTORC1-catalyzed phosphorylation of 4E-BP (29von Manteuffel S.R. Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Thomas G. Mol. Cell.

The finding that depletion of one mTORC1 substrate enhances the mTORC1-catalyzed phosphorylation of others suggests that even during insulin/nutrient stimulation, the availability of substrate binding sites on endogenous raptor may be limiting for mTORC1-catalyzed substrate phosphorylation.

In the present studies, we sought to characterize the regulation of substrate binding to mTORC1, gain insight into the underlying mechanism, and evaluate the contribution of this alteration to mTORC1 signaling. 293E cells (kindly provided by Dr Ramnik Xavier) and 293T cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and gentamycin (50 mg/ml, Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were plated on 6-cm plates and plasmid constructs were transiently transfected 24 h later using either Lipofectamine, or Lipofectamine 2000 for co-transfection experiments involving both plasmids and siRNA oligos according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen).

HeLa cells were plated on 6-cm plates and siRNA oligos were transiently transfected 24 h later using Oligofectamine according to the manufacturers instructions (Invitrogen). For co-transfection experiments plasmid constructs were transfected 24 h after siRNA oligos using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturers instructions (Invitrogen). 48 h post-siRNA transfection the medium was replace with DMEM lacking serum; 1 h later fresh DMEM ± insulin (1 μm) was added and the cells were extracted 30 min later. For amino acid starvation, the medium was replaced with DPBS supplemented with glucose and sodium pyruvate for 1 h, followed by fresh DPBS containing glucose and sodium pyruvate for a further 30 min prior to extraction. After their respective treatment, cells were washed in PBS and lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm DTT, protein inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche applied Science), and 0.2% CHAPS or 0.2% Triton X-100) and harvested by scraping, lysates were then spun at 13,200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in a tabletop centrifuge. For GST pull downs lysates were combined with 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and rotated for 1 h and 30 min at 4 °C. GST pulldown assays were washed five times in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer, and then 30 μl of Laemmli buffer was added for immunoblot analysis.

PRAS40 siRNA duplexes with 3′ dTdT overhangs and scrambled controls have previously been described.

Polyclonal phosphospecific anti-raptor antibodies were produced by immunizing rabbits with the following peptides coupled to KLH: Ser722 (CRSVSpSYGNIamide), Ser863 (CAPApSPTNKGamide), and Ser877 (CQAGGpSPPASamide), where pS represents phosphoserine. Phosphospecific antibodies were purified by initially coupling synthetic peptides (both phospho and nonphospho) to Sulfo-link coupling gel (Thermo Scientific) via an N-terminal cysteine residue. Sera was first passed over the nonphospho column then the phospho column, antibodies were then eluted according to the manufacturers instructions. Lysates, GST pulldowns, and immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and 5% powdered milk, primary antibodies were then diluted in the same solution and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed in PBST and secondary antibodies (horseradish peroxidase conjugated, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were then added, which were diluted in PBST containing 5% powdered milk for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were finally washed in PBST then analyzed by chemiluminescence (Thermo Scientific) using imaging film (Kodak). For multiple analysis membranes were stripped using 1 m NaOH for 10 min at room temperature, followed by three washes in PBS. These were performed essentially as previously described (6Sancak Y.

The phosphate transfer reaction used 200 ng of substrate, a final volume of 40 μl, and a 10-min incubation with agitation at 30 °C. Substrates were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as previously described (20Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Western blots were quantified using Adobe Photoshop. Subsaturating exposures were scanned and for each experiment in a series the scan value of one condition was divided into itself (and thus assigned the invariant value of 1) and into each of the other scan values. To evaluate, in a statistically valid manner, the data from a series of experiments thus normalized, each of the mean ratios was compared with its expected value under the hypothesis of no effect (which is 1), using a one-sample t test. This takes into account that the value of one condition is without variation. The use of normalization is appropriate inasmuch as the absolute scan value is an artifact of the blotting condition and exposure time. We sought to devise a probe for the availability of the mTORC1 substrate binding site in intact cells using the well characterized substrate 4E-BP. Inasmuch as the ability of mTORC1 substrates such as 4E-BP and PRAS40 to bind to raptor is strongly inhibited by their phosphorylation, we employed a mutant of 4E-BP wherein all five of the mTORC1-catalyzed phosphorylation sites (Thr37, Thr46, Ser65, Thr70, and Ser83) were substituted with Ala, fused to the carboxyl terminus of GST to make GST-4E-BP[5A]. We showed previously that elimination of these phosphorylation sites enhances the ability of 4E-BP to bind raptor (2Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Tokunaga C. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar); more importantly, the inability of GST-4E-BP[5A] to be phosphorylated renders its association with raptor sensitive only to perturbations of mTORC1 or regulators of substrate binding to mTORC1. The interaction of GST-4E-BP[5A] with raptor is lost by mutation of the 4E-BP TOS motif (Phe114 to Ala), indicating that GST-4E-BP[5A] binds to raptor at the physiologic substrate binding site (Fig. 1A). In an initial series of experiments, we introduced increasing amounts of cDNA encoding GST-4E-BP[5A] into 293T cells. Two hours prior to extraction, some cells were transferred from complete medium (DMEM + 10% FBS) to DPBS + glucose and pyruvate, followed by the addition of LY294002 30 min prior to extraction; this treatment sought to eliminate both the amino acid and Type 1 PI 3-kinase inputs to mTORC1. The cells were then extracted with either 0.2% CHAPS, which does not disrupt the raptor interaction with mTOR, or with 0.2% Triton X-100, which completely dissociates raptor from mTOR. The recombinant GST-4E-BP[5A] was then retrieved from the extracts with GSH-Sepharose, and the copurified raptor and mTOR were estimated by extracting the beads with SDS sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. As seen in Fig. 1, B and C, GST-4E-BP[5A] retrieves endogenous raptor in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B, top two panels). Extraction of the cells with Triton X-100, which causes a dissociation of mTOR/hLst8 from raptor (Fig. 1B, compare 3rd and 4th panels from top), increases the amount of raptor recovered at each dose of GST-4E-BP[5A] when compared with CHAPS extraction (Fig. 1B, compare the top two panels), confirming that mTOR itself restricts the ability of GST-4E-BP[5A] to bind raptor. In addition, exposing the cells to amino acid withdrawal plus LY294002 prior to extraction significantly reduces the amount of raptor bound to GST-4E-BP[5A] when the cells are extracted in 0.2% CHAPS, but has little or no effect on raptor recovery when the cells are extracted in Triton X-100 (Fig. 1, B and C). This suggests that the cell state regulates substrate binding to raptor, but primarily when mTOR complex 1 is intact. To explore the mechanism(s) underlying the regulation of substrate binding to mTORC1 we turned to the 293E cell line where the activity of the insulin-PI 3-kinase pathway in serum-deprived cells is quite low and is strongly activated by insulin. This is reflected by the absence of detectable phosphorylation of Akt(Ser473) and Akt substrates PRAS40(Thr246) and GSK3β(Ser9) after overnight serum withdrawal, and the robust stimulation of these phosphorylations by insulin (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the level of phosphorylation of 4E-BP(Thr37/Thr46) and PRAS40(Ser183) in serum-deprived 293E cells is ∼70 and 50%, respectively, that seen after insulin stimulation (Fig. 2B); these high basal phosphorylations, which are catalyzed directly by mTORC1, are abolished by a brief withdrawal of medium amino acids (Fig. 2A) and thus reflect the ability of amino acids, independent of insulin, to stimulate mTORC1 activity. The much lower basal phosphorylation of S6K1(Thr389), another direct mTORC1 substrate, appears to reflect the need for a higher level of mTORC1 catalytic activity, as indicated by the much greater sensitivity of S6K1(Thr389) phosphorylation to inhibition by mTOR catalytic inhibitor Torin 1 as compared with the inhibition of 4E-BP(Thr37/Thr46) and PRAS40(Ser183) phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). As in 293T cells, extraction of serum-deprived 293E cells with Triton X-100 results in a much greater recovery of endogenous raptor with transiently expressed GST-4E-BP[5A] than does extraction in CHAPS (Fig. 3A). Extraction in Triton X-100, i.e. removal of mTOR from raptor, does not itself alter the amount of PRAS40 bound to raptor as shown by the raptor immunoprecipitate (Fig. 3C, third panel from top), so that the Triton X-100-induced increase in GST-4E-BP[5A] binding to raptor is not attributable to the displacement of PRAS40, consistent with the view that mTOR itself restricts acce"
https://openalex.org/W2115143618,"Positive-strand RNA virus replication involves viral proteins and cellular proteins at nearly every replication step. Brome mosaic virus (BMV) is a well-established model for dissecting virus-host interactions and is one of very few viruses whose RNA replication, gene expression and encapsidation have been reproduced in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Previously, our laboratory identified ∼100 non-essential host genes whose loss inhibited or enhanced BMV replication at least 3-fold. However, our isolation of additional BMV-modulating host genes by classical genetics and other results underscore that genes essential for cell growth also contribute to BMV RNA replication at a frequency that may be greater than that of non-essential genes. To systematically identify novel, essential host genes affecting BMV RNA replication, we tested a collection of ∼900 yeast strains, each with a single essential gene promoter replaced by a doxycycline-repressible promoter, allowing repression of gene expression by adding doxycycline to the growth medium. Using this strain array of ∼81% of essential yeast genes, we identified 24 essential host genes whose depleted expression reproducibly inhibited or enhanced BMV RNA replication. Relevant host genes are involved in ribosome biosynthesis, cell cycle regulation and protein homeostasis, among other cellular processes. BMV 2a(Pol) levels were significantly increased in strains depleted for a heat shock protein (HSF1) or proteasome components (PRE1 and RPT6), suggesting these genes may affect BMV RNA replication by directly or indirectly modulating 2a(Pol) localization, post-translational modification or interacting partners. Investigating the diverse functions of these newly identified essential host genes should advance our understanding of BMV-host interactions and normal cellular pathways, and suggest new modes of virus control."
https://openalex.org/W2053518080,"The alternative transcription factor σB is responsible for transcription in Staphylococcus aureus during the stress response. Many virulence-associated genes are directly or indirectly regulated by σB. We hypothesized that treatment with antibiotics may act as an environmental stressor that induces σB activity in antibiotic-resistant strains. Several antibiotics with distinct modes of action, including ampicillin (12 µg/ml), vancomycin (16 or 32 µg/ml), chloramphenicol (15 µg/ml), ciprofloxacin (0.25 µg/ml), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SXT, 0.8 µg/ml), were investigated for their ability to activate this transcription factor. We were especially interested in the stress response in vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) strains treated with vancomycin. The transcription levels of selected genes associated with virulence were also measured. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR was employed to evaluate gene transcription levels. Contact hemolytic and cytotoxicity assays were used to evaluate cell damage following antibiotic treatment. Antibiotics that target the cell wall (vancomycin and ampicillin) and SXT induced σB activity in VRSA strains. Expression of σB-regulated virulence genes, including hla and fnbA, was associated with the vancomycin-induced σB activity in VRSA strains and the increase in cytotoxicity upon vancomycin treatment. These effects were not observed in the sigB-deficient strain but were observed in the complemented strain. We demonstrate that sub-minimum inhibitory concentration (sub-MIC) levels of antibiotics act as environmental stressors and activate the stress response sigma factor, σB. The improper use of antibiotics may alter the expression of virulence factors through the activation of σB in drug-resistant strains of S. aureus and lead to worse clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2029346951,"In newborn the innate immune system provides essential protection during primary infections before the generation of an appropriate adaptive immune response that is initially not fully operative. Innate immune response is evoked and perpetuated by molecules derived from microorganisms or by the damage/death of host cells. These are collectively known as damage-associated molecular-pattern (DAMP) molecules. High-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) or amphoterin, which previously was considered to be only a nuclear factor, has been recently identified as a DAMP molecule. When it is actively secreted by inflammatory cells or passively released from necrotic cells, HMGB1 mediates the response to infection, injury and inflammation, inducing dendritic cells maturation and T helper-1-cell responses. To characterize the role of HMGB1 in the innate and immature defense mechanisms in newborns, human cord blood (CB) mononuclear cells, in comparison to adult peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells, have been analyzed for its expression. By flow cytometry and western blot analysis, we observed that in CB and PB cells: i) HMGB1 is expressed on cell surface membranes of myeloid dendritic cell precursors, mostly, and lymphocytes (gamma/delta and CD4+ T cells) to a lesser extent; ii) different pro-inflammatory stimuli or molecules that mimic infection increased cell surface expression of HMGB1 as well as its secretion into extracellular environment; iii) the treatment with synthetic molecules such as aminobisphosphonates (ABs), identified to be γδ T cell antigens, triggered up-regulation of HMGB1 expression on mononuclear cells, as well γδ T lymphocytes, inducing its secretion. The modulation of its secretion and the HMGB1-mediated migration of monocytes indicated HMGB1 as regulator of immune response in an immature system, like CB, through engagement of γδ T lymphocytes and myeloid dendritic cell precursors, essential components of innate immunity. In addition, the increased HMGB1 expression/secretion triggered by ABs, previously characterized for their immuno-modulating and immune-adjuvant capabilities, indicated that immunomodulation might represent a new therapeutical approach for neonatal and adult pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W1987305766,"Biological utilization of cellulose is a complex process involving the coordinated expression of different cellulases, often in a synergistic manner. One possible means of inducing an organism-level change in cellulase activity is to use laboratory adaptive evolution. In this study, evolved strains of the cellulolytic actinobacterium, Thermobifida fusca, were generated for two different scenarios: continuous exposure to cellobiose (strain muC) or alternating exposure to cellobiose and glucose (strain muS). These environmental conditions produced a phenotype specialized for growth on cellobiose (muC) and an adaptable, generalist phenotype (muS). Characterization of cellular phenotypes and whole genome re-sequencing were conducted for both the muC and muS strains. Phenotypically, the muC strain showed decreased cell yield over the course of evolution concurrent with decreased cellulase activity, increased intracellular ATP concentrations, and higher end-product secretions. The muS strain increased its cell yield for growth on glucose and exhibited a more generalist phenotype with higher cellulase activity and growth capabilities on different substrates. Whole genome re-sequencing identified 48 errors in the reference genome and 18 and 14 point mutations in the muC and muS strains, respectively. Among these mutations, the site mutation of Tfu_1867 was found to contribute the specialist phenotype and the site mutation of Tfu_0423 was found to contribute the generalist phenotype. By conducting and characterizing evolution experiments on Thermobifida fusca, we were able to show that evolutionary changes balance ATP energetic considerations with cellulase activity. Increased cellulase activity is achieved in stress environments (switching carbon sources), otherwise cellulase activity is minimized to conserve ATP."

Inteins can also serve as a novel drug target in bacteria that rely on protein splicing for their survival, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (8Paulus H. Drug Future. 2007; 32: 973-984Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Protein splicing is a strictly intramolecular reaction, requiring no cofactors or energy input. The precursor protein acts as both the enzyme and substrate of the reaction. Therefore, the precursor for protein splicing is the equivalent of a traditional enzyme-substrate complex and can provide key structural information for understanding the mechanism of protein splicing. However, because of the spontaneous nature of protein splicing, native precursors are unstable. Consequently, structural studies of the protein splicing mechanism have relied on spliced inteins or intein precursors with mutations at active site residues. The Pyrococcus abyssi DNA polymerase II intein, abbreviated as the Pab PolII 4The abbreviations used are: Pab PolIIPyrococcus abyssi DNA polymerase II inteinHTHhyperthermophilic and thermophilic hairpinMBPmaltose-binding proteinPDBProtein Data Bank. intein, is found in a hyperthermophilic organism that lives near deep sea thermal vents, with an optimal growth temperature of 96 °C (9Erauso G.

There are four steps of protein splicing in canonical inteins (Fig. 1A): step 1, N-X acyl shift (X = S or O); step 2, transesterification and the formation of a branched intermediate; step 3, asparagine cyclization coupled with C-terminal cleavage; and step 4, X-N acyl shift and succinimide hydrolysis (10Paulus H.

These steps are catalyzed by active site residues in conserved blocks in intein sequences. Block A contains a conserved cysteine or serine at position 1 that serves as a nucleophile for the N-X acyl shift, the first step of protein splicing. Block B has the TXXH motif important for the N-X acyl shift (12Klabunde T. Sharma S. Telenti A. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct.

In block G, there is the penultimate histidine (relative to the intein C terminus) at position 6 and a C-terminal asparagine at position 7, both critical for C-terminal cleavage. The first residue of the C-extein, usually a cysteine or serine and termed C+1 or S+1, respectively, serves as the nucleophile for transesterification. Variations of the four-step scheme have been discovered among a number of inteins (21Amitai G. Dassa B. Pietrokovski S. J. Biol.

The C-terminal residue of inteins is typically an asparagine, whose cyclization leads to the cleavage of the intein from the C-extein. The Pab PolII intein (23Mills K.V. Manning J.S. Garcia A.M.

In contrast to the CIV RNR intein, which has reduced splicing activity upon the mutation of C-terminal glutamine to asparagine, the same mutation enhances protein splicing by 3-fold in the Pab PolII intein (23Mills K.V.

In this paper, we carried out structural and mutagenesis studies of the Pab PolII intein using solution NMR and in vitro splicing assays. For the structural studies, we employed a wild type intein without any extein residues. The intein contains 185 residues and is categorized as a mini-intein as it lacks a homing endonuclease domain. Our investigation showed that the usual insertion site for the endonuclease domain is replaced by an extended loop, which may be an ideal site for protein engineering. The structure also shows that the threonine side chain in the block B TXXH motif forms a hydrogen bond with the Cys-1 amide nitrogen. Block F Ser-166, the equivalent of the conserved block F aspartate in inteins, is in close contact with the Cys-1 side chain. Our mutagenesis of the Thr-90 in the block B TXXH motif shows that it is crucial for promoting the N-S acyl shift. Mutagenesis of block F Ser-166 reveals that it has a coordination role in protein splicing. Finally, we used NMR spin relaxation to show that the Pab PolII intein has many unique properties in protein dynamics. The Pab PolII intein gene cloned into pETM-44 vector ppC1Q185 expresses a fusion protein with an N-terminal (His)6 tag and maltose-binding protein (MBP). There is a single proline between the (His)6 tag and MBP and a linker sequence TPGSLEVLKQGPM between MBP and the intein. Isotopically labeled ([U-15N], [U-13C; U-15N] and [∼70%-2H; U-13C; and U-15N]) proteins were obtained by transforming the plasmid into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and overexpressing the fusion protein in M9 medium. The M9 cultures were incubated at 37 °C until A600 reached 0.3–0.4 and were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 20 °C for an additional 16 h. Cell lysate was purified by nickel-nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography to obtain the fusion protein. The Pab PolII intein was cleaved from the fusion protein with 100 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) at 60 °C for 6 h. Affinity chromatography was utilized again to trap the (His)6-tagged MBP and uncleaved fusion protein, whereas the Pab PolII intein was not retained by the nickel column. Flow-through fractions were pooled and exchanged into buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.05 mm sodium azide in 90% H2O, 10% D2O or 99.9% D2O at pH 6.5. The final concentrations of the NMR samples were between 0.5 and 2.0 mm. Both NMR structural and dynamics studies were carried out at 47 °C, where Pab PolII intein can mediate protein splicing efficiently (23Mills K.V. Manning J.S. Garcia A.M. Wuerdeman L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20685-20691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). All spectra were acquired on a Bruker Advance II 800 MHz or Bruker Advance II 600 MHz (1H) spectrometer, each equipped with a cryogenic probe. Spectra were processed with nmrPipe software (24Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Resonance assignment was carried out using the following experiments: two-dimensional 15N,1H-heteronuclear single quantum coherence, three-dimensional HNCACO, three-dimensional HNCO, three-dimensional HNCACB, three-dimensional HN(CO)CACB, three-dimensional 15N-TOCSY (τm = 55 ms), three-dimensional (H)CC(CO)NH-TOCSY, three-dimensional H(CC)(CO)NH-TOCSY, three-dimensional HC(C)H-TOCSY (τm = 15 ms), three-dimensional 15N-NOESY (τm = 100 ms), and three-dimensional 13C-NOESY (τm = 105 ms). The 1H chemical shifts were referenced relative to 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid and the 15N and 13C chemical shifts were referenced indirectly using frequency ratios between 15N, 13C, and 1H (15N/1H = 0.101329118, 13C/1H = 0.251449530) (25Wishart D.S.

The chemical shifts have been deposited in the BioMagResBank under accession number 17418. For residual dipolar coupling measurements with IPAP (26Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), the Pab PolII intein was aligned in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels with a stretch ratio (dO/dN) of 1.29 using the apparatus described by Chou et al. (27Chou J.J. Gaemers S. Howder B. Louis J.M. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). All relaxation experiments were carried out at 47 °C on a Bruker Advance II 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance cryogenic probe. Relaxation properties were characterized by 15N R1, R2, and heteronuclear steady-state NOE experiments. These relaxation parameters were sensitive to motions occurring at the time scale faster than protein tumbling, on the order of picosecond to nanosecond. R1, R2, and NOE experiments were performed using the pulse sequence described by Farrow et al. (28Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). NMR spectra were acquired with 2048 (t2) × 256 (t1) complex data points, spectral widths of 7560 Hz in 1H and 2798 Hz in 15N, and 16 scans. The recycle delay was 3.0 s. R1 relaxation times of 10, 100, 200, 300, 400(×2), 500, 600, 700, 800, and 900 ms were used. R2 relaxation times of 2, 16(×2), 30, 44, 58, 72, 86(×2), and 100 ms were used. {1H}-15N steady-state heteronuclear NOEs were obtained by interleaving the proton saturation experiment and no proton saturation experiment at each t1 point. The recycle delay was 7.5 s and proton saturation was achieved by applying a 120 degree proton pulse at 5 ms delay. For each R1 and R2 experiment, the spectrum with the shortest relaxation time (highest intensities) was peak picked with Sparky. Fitting for relaxation rates and error estimates were accomplished using the program CURVEFIT (A. G. Palmer, Columbia University, New York). The heteronuclear NOE values were obtained from the ratio of the peak heights for 1H-saturated and unsaturated spectra and carried out in triplicate. The uncertainties in the NOEs were set to twice the standard deviation from three trials (29Savard P.Y. Gagné S.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11414-11424Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For the Pab PolII intein, we found 104 residues with well resolved peaks in the 15N,1H-heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectrum to warrant quantitative relaxation analysis on a per-residue basis. 15N NMR relaxation data were analyzed using a rNH of 1.02 Å as the mean amide nitrogen-hydrogen bond length, and Δσ = σ‖ − s⊥ is the chemical shift anisotropy of −172 ppm for the backbone 15N nucleus. The amplitudes and time scales of the internal motions of the protein were determined from the relaxation data according to the model-free formalism pioneered by Lipari and Szabo (30Lipari G.

The generalized order parameters (S2) obtained by Modelfree described the amplitude of the internal motion for individual amide bonds at the picosecond to nanosecond time scale. Peak lists were generated from three-dimensional 15N-NOESY in 90% H2O, and two three-dimensional 13C-NOESY spectra in 100% D2O and 90% H2O, respectively, all recorded at 800 MHz 1H frequency. The peak lists and the chemical shifts from the resonance assignment (34Liu, J., Du, Z., Albracht, C. D., Naidu, R. O., Mills, K. V., Wang, C. (2011) Biomol.

To study the effect of mutations on the first step of splicing, we introduced mutations of C+1A and Q185A to prevent steps two and three of splicing, respectively. To study the third step of splicing, we replaced the N-extein (M) with a short seven-residue polypeptide (N) and made a mutation of C1A. We overexpressed the proteins in E. coli BL21(DE3), which were purified using HisLink Protein Purification Resin (Promega, Madison, WI). The purified proteins were exchanged into buffer A (100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with 500 mm NaCl) using 3 kDa MWCO centrifugal filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA). For the N-terminal cleavage assay, the proteins were incubated at 60 °C at the times noted in Fig. 5, B and C, in a 16- or 20-μl reaction mixture of buffer A with 2.0 μg of purified protein and supplemented with 5.0 mm EDTA, 2.0 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and 100 mm DTT. For splicing or C-terminal cleavage assays, the same reaction conditions were employed, but DTT was omitted. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS Blue Loading Buffer (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 4–20% gradient Tris glycine gels (Lonza, Rockland, ME). For Western blot analysis, gels were blotted onto PVDF. The membranes were blocked using 1% BSA in buffer W (PBS and 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of HisDetector Nickel-AP in Detector Block Solution (KPL). The blot was developed with Western Blue stabilized substrate (Promega). Conversion of MIH (precursor, 66.7 kDa) to M (43.7 kDa) and IH (23.0 kDa) indicates cleavage by DTT of the thioester linkage between the N-extein and intein. Conversion of MIH to MH (45.2 kDa) and I (21.5 kDa) indicates protein splicing, and conversion of NIH (23.9 kDa) to NI (22.4 kDa) or MIH (66.7 kDa) to MI (65.2 kDa) indicates C-terminal cleavage. The solution NMR structure of the Pab PolII intein is based on distance constraints, H-bond constraints, and local and long-range angular constraints, derived from NOESY, hydrogen deuterium exchange, chemical shift analysis using TALOS+, and residual dipolar coupling measurements, respectively (Table 1). On average, 19.5 constraints were obtained for each residue. In contrast to most inteins, the Pab PolII intein does not contain an endonuclease domain, but rather an extended loop of 26 residues (121–146) in the equivalent position in sequence (Fig. 3, highlighted in yellow). This Pab PolII-specific loop has few observed long-range NOEs and shows 15N relaxation rates characteristic of disorder and flexibility (see below). In the ensemble of 20 conformers from the Xplor-NIH calculation (38Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Clore G.M. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Res. Sp. 2006; 48: 47-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (619) Google Scholar), the backbone and heavy atom root mean square deviations are 0.46 ± 0.10, 0.93 ± 0.12 Å. These values exclude the extended loop and are for residues 1–120 and 147–185 (Table 1; Fig. 3). All the residues fall into the allowed regions in the Ramachandran plot (40Ramachandran G.N. Ramakrishnan C. Sasisekharan V. J. Mol. Biol. 1963; 7: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2684) Google Scholar), with 82% in the most favored region (Table 1). Numerous structural quality factors show that the Pab PolII intein structure has better quality than the average NMR structures in PDB (Table 1) (39Bhattacharya A. Tejero R. Montelione G.T. Proteins. 2007; 66: 778-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar).TABLE 1The experimental NMR data for the structure calculation and the structural statistics of the 20 energy-minimized conformers of Pab PolII inteina Residues for Ramachandran statistics are 5–90, 93–120, 147–158, 161–170, and 174–183.b With respect to mean and SD for a set of 252 x-ray structures <500 residues, of resolution <= 1.80 Å, R-factor <= 0.25 and R-free <= 0.28; a positive value indicates a “better” score.c 183 NMR structures determined by nonstructural genomics consortia groups.

The Pab PolII intein structure is composed primarily of β-strands, which are arranged in a compact HINT (Hedgehog/Intein) fold (Fig. 2) (41Sun P. Ye S. Ferrandon S. Evans T.C. Xu M.Q. Rao Z. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 1093-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure contains 16 regular secondary structures, i.e. 14 β-strands, one α-helix, and one turn of 310-helix (Fig. 2B). In sequential order, the intein fold begins with a short β-strand at the N terminus, which is followed by two β-strands at residues 7–12 and 15–20. There is an amphipathic α-helix at residues 21–27, which is exposed to solvent on one side and packed against hydrophobic side chains formed by strands β2 and β3 on the other side (Leu-21, Leu-24, Tyr-25, and Leu-27). A tight turn leads to the β-hairpin of β4(31–34) and β5(37–40). This is followed by a twisted anti-parallel β-hairpin of strands β6(47–52) and extended β strand β7(59–81). β7a(59–71) forms an antiparallel β-hairpin with β5(37–40), β6(47–52), and β12b(163–167), whereas β7b(76–81) forms an antiparallel β-hairpin with β8(86–89) and β12a(149–157). The strand β9(94–99) pairs with β10(102–107) to from a hairpin, which is then connected to a short 310 helix. β11(116–119) is connected to the long Pab PolII-specific loop that extends back to β12a(149–157). The long β12 strand passes through the center of the disk-shaped intein structure with the active site residue Ser-166 located in β12b(163–167). Additional β13(175–177) and β14(181–183) strands form an antiparallel β-hairpin and bring the C-terminal Gln to the active site. Strands β7 and β12 are continuous in some inteins but in the Pab PolII intein appear to be broken by short loops (Fig. 3), and are therefore named as β7a(59–71), β7b(76–81), β12a(149–157), and β12b(163–167). A structure-based sequence alignment of Pab PolII with homologous proteins is shown in Fig. 3 in the order of descending DALI score from top to bottom (42Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3562) Google Scholar). These inteins and the hedgehog protein have DALI Z-scores higher than 9.5, indicating structural homology despite their low sequence identity. The closest homologs to the Pab PolII intein are two other archaeal inteins, the Thermococcus kodakaraensis Pol-2 intein (Tko Pol-2; Z-score 18.5; PDB codes 2CW7 and 2CW8)(43Matsumura H. Takahashi H.

https://openalex.org/W1963544479,"The vast majority of people living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) have pain syndrome, which has a significant impact on their quality of life. The underlying causes of HIV-1-associated pain are not likely attributable to direct viral infection of the nervous system due to the lack of evidence of neuronal infection by HIV-1. However, HIV-1 proteins are possibly involved as they have been implicated in neuronal damage and death. The current study assesses the direct effects of HIV-1 Tat, one of potent neurotoxic viral proteins released from HIV-1-infected cells, on the excitability and survival of rat primary dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. We demonstrated that HIV-1 Tat triggered rapid and sustained enhancement of the excitability of small-diameter rat primary DRG neurons, which was accompanied by marked reductions in the rheobase and resting membrane potential (RMP), and an increase in the resistance at threshold (RTh). Such Tat-induced DRG hyperexcitability may be a consequence of the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) activity. Tat rapidly inhibited Cdk5 kinase activity and mRNA production, and roscovitine, a well-known Cdk5 inhibitor, induced a very similar pattern of DRG hyperexcitability. Indeed, pre-application of Tat prevented roscovitine from having additional effects on the RMP and action potentials (APs) of DRGs. However, Tat-mediated actions on the rheobase and RTh were accelerated by roscovitine. These results suggest that Tat-mediated changes in DRG excitability are partly facilitated by Cdk5 inhibition. In addition, Cdk5 is most abundant in DRG neurons and participates in the regulation of pain signaling. We also demonstrated that HIV-1 Tat markedly induced apoptosis of primary DRG neurons after exposure for longer than 48 h. Together, this work indicates that HIV-1 proteins are capable of producing pain signaling through direct actions on excitability and survival of sensory neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2054082069,"Selective degeneration of medium spiny neurons and preservation of medium sized aspiny interneurons in striatum has been implicated in excitotoxicity and pathophysiology of Huntington's disease (HD). However, the molecular mechanism for the selective sparing of medium sized aspiny neurons and vulnerability of projection neurons is still elusive. The pathological characteristic of HD is an extensive reduction of the striatal mass, affecting caudate putamen. Somatostatin (SST) positive neurons are selectively spared in HD and Quinolinic acid/N-methyl-D-aspartic acid induced excitotoxicity, mimic the model of HD. SST plays neuroprotective role in excitotoxicity and the biological effects of SST are mediated by five somatostatin receptor subtypes (SSTR1-5).To delineate subtype selective biological responses we have here investigated changes in SSTR1 and 5 double knockout mice brain and compared with HD transgenic mouse model (R6/2). Our study revealed significant loss of dopamine and cAMP regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (DARPP-32) and comparable changes in SST, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors subtypes, calbindin and brain nitric oxide synthase expression as well as in key signaling proteins including calpain, phospho-extracellular-signal-regulated kinases1/2, synapsin-IIa, protein kinase C-α and calcineurin in SSTR1/5(-/-) and R6/2 mice. Conversely, the expression of somatostatin receptor subtypes, enkephalin and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases were strain specific. SSTR1/5 appears to be important in regulating NMDARs, DARPP-32 and signaling molecules in similar fashion as seen in HD transgenic mice.This is the first comprehensive description of disease related changes upon ablation of G- protein coupled receptor gene. Our results indicate that SST and SSTRs might play an important role in regulation of neurodegeneration and targeting this pathway can provide a novel insight in understanding the pathophysiology of Huntington's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2082822695,"Several nutrient permeases have been identified in yeast, which combine a transport and receptor function, and are called transceptors. The Gap1 general amino acid permease and the Mep2 ammonium permease mediate rapid activation by amino acids and by ammonium, respectively, of the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway in nitrogen-starved cells. Their mode of action is not well understood. Both proteins are subject to complex controls governing their intracellular trafficking. Using a split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid screen with Gap1 or Mep2 as bait, we identified proteins putatively interacting with Gap1 and/or Mep2. They are involved in glycosylation, the secretory pathway, sphingolipid biosynthesis, cell wall biosynthesis and other processes. For several candidate interactors, determination of transport and signaling capacity, as well as localization of Gap1 or Mep2 in the corresponding deletion strains, confirmed a functional interaction with Gap1 and/or Mep2. Also common interacting proteins were identified. Transport and signaling were differentially affected in specific deletion strains, clearly separating the two functions of the transceptors and confirming that signaling does not require transport. We identified two new proteins, Bsc6 and Yir014w, that affect trafficking or downregulation of Gap1. Deletion of EGD2, YNL024c or SPC2 inactivates Gap1 transport and signaling, while its plasma membrane level appears normal.. Vma4 is required for Mep2 expression, while Gup1 appears to be required for proper distribution of Mep2 over the plasma membrane. Some of the interactions were confirmed by GST pull-down assay, using the C-terminal tail of Gap1 or Mep2 expressed in E.coli. Our results reveal the effectiveness of split-ubiquitin two-hybrid screening for identification of proteins functionally interacting with membrane proteins. They provide several candidate proteins involved in the transport and signaling function or in the complex trafficking control of the Gap1 and Mep2 transceptors."
https://openalex.org/W2056856608,"Prion diseases have been observed to deregulate the transcription of erythroid genes, and prion protein knockout mice have demonstrated a diminished response to experimental anemia. To investigate the role of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) in erythropoiesis, we studied the protein's expression on mouse erythroid precursors in vivo and utilized an in vitro model of the erythroid differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells (MEL) to evaluate the effect of silencing PrPC through RNA interference. The expression of PrPC and selected differentiation markers was analyzed by quantitative multicolor flow cytometry, western blot analysis and quantitative RT-PCR. The silencing of PrPC expression in MEL cells was achieved by expression of shRNAmir from an integrated retroviral vector genome. The initial upregulation of PrPC expression in differentiating erythroid precursors was detected both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting PrPC's importance to the early stages of differentiation. The upregulation was highest on early erythroblasts (16200±3700 PrPC / cell) and was followed by the gradual decrease of PrPC level with the precursor's maturation reaching 470±230 PrPC / cell on most mature CD71−Ter119+ small precursors. Interestingly, the downregulation of PrPC protein with maturation of MEL cells was not accompanied by the decrease of PrP mRNA. The stable expression of anti-Prnp shRNAmir in MEL cells led to the efficient (>80%) silencing of PrPC levels. Cell growth, viability, hemoglobin production and the transcription of selected differentiation markers were not affected by the downregulation of PrPC. In conclusion, the regulation of PrPC expression in differentiating MEL cells mimics the pattern detected on mouse erythroid precursors in vivo. Decrease of PrPC protein expression during MEL cell maturation is not regulated on transcriptional level. The efficient silencing of PrPC levels, despite not affecting MEL cell differentiation, enables created MEL lines to be used for studies of PrPC cellular function."
https://openalex.org/W1993767329,"Endogenous Borna-like nucleoprotein (EBLNs) elements were recently discovered as non-retroviral RNA virus elements derived from bornavirus in the genomes of various animals. Most of EBLNs appeared to be defective, but some of primate EBLN-1 to -4, which appeared to be originated from four independent integrations of bornavirus nucleoprotein (N) gene, have retained an open reading frame (ORF) for more than 40 million years. It was therefore possible that primate EBLNs have encoded functional proteins during evolution. To examine this possibility, natural selection operating on all ORFs of primate EBLN-1 to -4 was examined by comparing the rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions. The expected number of premature termination codons in EBLN-1 generated after the divergence of Old World and New World monkeys under the selective neutrality was also examined by the Monte Carlo simulation. As a result, natural selection was not identified for the entire region as well as parts of ORFs in the pairwise analysis of primate EBLN-1 to -4 and for any branch of the phylogenetic trees for EBLN-1 to -4 after the divergence of Old World and New World monkeys. Computer simulation also indicated that the absence of premature termination codon in the present-day EBLN-1 does not necessarily support the maintenance of function after the divergence of Old World and New World monkeys. These results suggest that EBLNs have not generally encoded functional proteins after the divergence of Old World and New World monkeys."
https://openalex.org/W1965356948,"The development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) results from the selective destruction of pancreatic beta-cells. Both humans and spontaneous models of IDDM, such as NOD mice, have an extended pre-diabetic stage. Dynamic changes in beta-cell mass and function during pre-diabetes, such as insulin hyper-secretion, remain largely unknown. In this paper, we evaluated pre-diabetic female NOD mice at different ages (6, 10, and 14 weeks old) to illustrate alterations in beta-cell mass and function as disease progressed. We found an increase in beta-cell mass in 6-week-old NOD mice that may account for improved glucose tolerance in these mice. As NOD mice aged, beta-cell mass progressively reduced with increasing insulitis. In parallel, secretory ability of individual beta-cells was enhanced due to an increase in the size of slowly releasable pool (SRP) of vesicles. Moreover, expression of both SERCA2 and SERCA3 genes were progressively down-regulated, which facilitated depolarization-evoked secretion by prolonging Ca(2+) elevation upon glucose stimulation. In summary, we propose that different mechanisms contribute to the insulin hyper-secretion at different ages of pre-diabetic NOD mice, which may provide some new ideas concerning the progression and management of type I diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1978167208,"Nematodes are a major cause of disease and the discovery of new pathways not found in hosts is critical for development of therapeutic targets. Previous studies suggest that Caenorhabditis elegans synthesizes phosphocholine via two S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-dependent phosphoethanolamine methyltransferases (PMT). Here we examine two PMT from the parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus. Sequence analysis suggests that HcPMT1 contains a methyltransferase domain in the N-terminal half of the protein and that HcPMT2 encodes a C-terminal methyltransferase domain, as in the C. elegans proteins. Kinetic analysis demonstrates that HcPMT1 catalyzes the conversion of phosphoethanolamine to phosphomonomethylethanolamine (pMME) and that HcPMT2 methylates pMME to phosphodimethylethanolamine (pDME) and pDME to phosphocholine. The IC(50) values for miltefosine, sinefungin, amodiaquine, diphenhydramine, and tacrine suggest differences in the active sites of these two enzymes. To examine the interaction of AdoMet and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoCys), isothermal titration calorimetry confirmed the presence of a single binding site in each enzyme. Binding of AdoMet and AdoCys is tight (K(d) ∼2-25 μm) over a range of temperatures (5-25 °C) and NaCl concentrations (0.05-0.5 m). Heat capacity changes for AdoMet and AdoCys binding suggests that each HcPMT differs in interaction surface area. Nonlinear van't Hoff plots also indicate a possible conformational change upon AdoMet/AdoCys binding. Functional analysis of the PMT from a parasitic nematode provides new insights on inhibitor and AdoMet/AdoCys binding to these enzymes."

However, systematic studies of TAP-independent pathways involved in the generation of the overall peptide repertoire associated with different HLA class I molecules have not been reported. Studying the reexpression of newly synthesized complexes of different HLA class I molecules in the presence of diverse protease inhibitors allowed the determination of several allele-dependent processing pathways in TAP-deficient cells. T2 is a TAP-deficient human cell line that express HLA-A2, -B51, and -Cw1 class I molecules on the cell surface (24Salter R.D. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). T2-B27 cells were generated by transfection of T2 cells with HLA-B27 (a gift from Dr. David Yu, University of California, Los Angeles). T2 and T2-B27 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Brefeldin A (BFA), chloroquine (CQ), and all protease inhibitors were from Sigma-Aldrich except leupeptin (Amersham Biosciences), pepstatin (Roche Applied Science), butabindide (Tocris), decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-CMK (dec-RVKR) (Bachem), (z-LL)2 ketone (Merck), and lactacystin (Dr. E. J. Corey, Harvard University). The general specificity and activity of all inhibitors used in this study are summarized in Table 1. The normal HLA class I re-expression of at least one allele for each inhibitor demonstrates no toxic effect by the use of different inhibitors (see below).TABLE 1General specificity of inhibitors used in this studyInhibitorAbbreviationSpecificityReferenceConcentrationBrefeldin ABFAVesicle transport30Yewdell J.W.

Marto J.A. Partridge M. Hall E. White F.M. Lippolis J.D. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Engelhard V.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1212-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Culture medium was added to neutralize the pH. Cells were washed three times, resuspended in assay medium (RPMI 1640 medium with 1% BSA) at 106/ml, and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h in the presence or absence of inhibitors at the indicated concentrations (Table 1). Serum-free conditions were used throughout. HLA expression levels were measured using the monoclonal antibodies (Abs) ME1 (anti-HLA-B27) (26Ellis S.A. Taylor C. McMichael A. Hum. Immunol. 1982; 5: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) in T2-B27 cells; polyclonal H00003106-B01P (specific for HLA-B class I molecules; Abnova) in T2 cells; and monoclonal PA2.1 (anti-HLA-A2) (27Parham P. Bodmer W.F. Nature. 1978; 276: 397-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and polyclonal SC-19438 (specific for HLA-C class I molecules; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in T2 and T2-B27 cells simultaneously as described previously (28López D. Samino Y. Koszinowski U.H. Del Val M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4238-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Samples (104 cells) were run on a FACSCanto flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using CellQuest Pro 2.0 software (BD Biosciences). Percentage of inhibition of HLA reexpression obtained by the addition of the indicated inhibitors (Table 1) was calculated utilizing the following equation. % inhibition=100-MFI+inhibitor-MF+2nd AbMFIwithout inhibitor-MFI+2nd Ab×100(Eq. 1) To analyze statistical significance, an unpaired Student's t test was used. p values < 0.01 were considered significant. To examine the generation of the TAP-independent HLA-bound peptide repertoire, TAP-deficient T2 and T2-B27 cells, treated with acid to remove surface class I peptide complexes, were allowed to reexpress newly synthesized complexes for 6 h. The T2-B27 cell line was selected because it expresses one each of the endogenous HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles and an additional HLA-B class I molecule, thus mimicking a partial heterozygous haplotype. This expression pattern allows four different class I molecules to be studied. As reported previously for some MHC class I alleles (29Anderson K.S. Alexander J. Wei M. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3407-3419PubMed Google Scholar), different reexpression levels were found in each of the four HLA class I molecules studied (Fig. 1, upper). To test whether TAP-independent ligands require endogenous processing, HLA reexpression was analyzed in the presence of BFA. This drug blocks class I export beyond the cis-Golgi compartment (30Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Science. 1989; 244: 1072-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 31Nuchtern J.G. Bonifacino J.S. Biddison W.E. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1989; 339: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), preventing the surface expression of newly assembled class I-peptide complexes from endogenous origin. The reexpression level of all four HLA class I alleles expressed by the TAP-deficient cells used was decreased significantly: 84% ± 10% for HLA-A2, 87% ± 8% for HLA-B27, 80% ± 7% for HLA-B51, and 63% ± 8% for HLA-Cw1 (Fig. 1). These results demonstrated that the generation of the TAP-independent HLA-ligands was generated primarily from proteins endogenously processed in TAP-deficient cells. To study the involvement of different proteolytic activities in the generation of TAP-independent ligands presented by HLA class I molecules, the surface reexpression of different HLA class I molecules after acid stripping in T2-B27 TAP-deficient cells was performed in the presence or absence of different inhibitors. Previously, partial block (∼50% of inhibition) of HLA-A2 reexpression in TAP-deficient cells caused by the addition of lactacystin, a Streptomyces metabolite (32Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S.

The involvement of multicatalytic complex proteasome in the processing of ligands presented by other HLA class I was studied. Both lactacystin and epoxomicin (35Schwarz K. de Giuli R. Schmidtke G.

Thus, these data indicate that the proteasome activity is not absolutely required to generate ligands bound to HLA-B27 and -Cw1 class I molecules.TABLE 2Summary of inhibition of HLA reexpressionAlelleBFAaFor specificity of different inhibitors see Table I.LC/EPOXLeuSHz-LL2CQHLA-A2+b+ and − indicate percentage inhibition >35% and <10%, respectively.

These four inhibitors had no effect on the HLA reexpression of any of the four alleles studied (Fig. 3). Thus, the enzymes inhibited by these drugs cannot be formally involved in the generation of TAP-independent ligands. In addition, as the activity of ERAP, an enzyme previously involved in antigen processing (41Saric T. Chang S.C. Hattori A. York I.A. Markant S. Rock K.L. Tsujimoto M. Goldberg A.L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 42York I.A. Chang S.C. Saric T. Keys J.A. Favreau J.M. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Nat.

Gonzalez F. Kim J. Jacob R. Shastri N. Nature. 2002; 419: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) was used. A partial inhibition of surface reexpression of HLA-A2 (38% ± 4%), -B27 (36% ± 10%), and -B51 (48% ± 8%) but not HLA-Cw1 (0% ± 5%) in TAP-deficient cells treated with leucinethiol was found (Fig. 3). These inhibitions are similar to those reported previously in TAP-sufficient cells, where the surface quantities of the murine MHC class I molecules, Kk and Ld, decreased between 20 and 40% by specific ERAP inhibition (43Serwold T. Gonzalez F. Kim J. Jacob R. Shastri N. Nature. 2002; 419: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Thus, these data implicate ERAP, or other metallo-aminopeptidases, in the generation of a subset of TAP-independent ligands presented by three of four HLA class I molecules examined. Different proteases such as tripeptidyl peptidase II (1Seifert U. Marañón C. Shmueli A. Desoutter J.F. Wesoloski L. Janek K. Henklein P. Diescher S. Andrieu M. de la Salle H. Weinschenk T. Schild H.

Med. 1998; 188: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) were previously implicated in antigen processing as being able to generate pathogen-derived peptides. The possible role of these enzymes in endogenous presentation of TAP-independent ligands was studied using available specific inhibitors (Table 1). Inhibition of HLA reexpression was not detected with any of these drugs (Fig. 4) in all HLA class I alleles studied, and thus, the enzymatic activity of these peptidases is not absolutely required in the generation of TAP-independent ligands. Different endogenous TAP-independent HLA-A2 class I ligands are derived by cleavage of the respective signal sequences generated by the SPase complex (16Larsen M.V. Nielsen M. Weinzierl A. L. O. Curr. Immunol. Rev. 2006; 2: 233-245Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 44Weinzierl A.O. Rudolf D. Hillen N. Tenzer S. van Endert P. Schild H. Rammensee H.G. Stevanoviæ S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2008; 38: 1503-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A specific inhibitor of this enzymatic activity is unavailable; thus, direct involvement of SPase complex in the generation of TAP-independent HLA-A2 ligands could not be studied. However, two SPase-processed peptides need further cleavage by SPPase (19Weihofen A. Lemberg M.K. Ploegh H.L. Bogyo M. Martoglio B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30951-30956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 20Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), allowing the hypothetical involvement of SPPase to be examined by treating TAP-deficient cells with the SPPase-specific inhibitor (z-LL)2 ketone (19Weihofen A.

Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). This drug specifically inhibits TAP-independent HLA reexpression of HLA-A2 (82% ± 10%), and -B51 (48% ± 10%), but not -B27 (10% ± 7%) or -Cw1 (1% ± 12%). These results demonstrate the role of SPPase in the generation of TAP-independent ligands for some HLA class I molecules. Previously, three epitopes processed in an endosomal/lysosomal antigen processing pathway for murine MHC class I presentation in TAP-deficient cells were blocked in cells treated with CQ (23Tiwari N. Garbi N. Reinheckel T. Moldenhauer G. Hämmerling G.J. Momburg F. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 7932-7942Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 45Schirmbeck R. Melber K. Reimann J. Eur. J.

Immunol. 2002; 215: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Thus, the contribution of the CQ-sensitive (47Ziegler H.K. Unanue E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1982; 79: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 48Chesnut R.W. Colon S.M. Grey H.M. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 2382-2388PubMed Google Scholar) processing pathway to the generation of overall TAP-independent ligands was evaluated. In our experiments, specific reduction (41% ± 8%) of the HLA-B27 surface levels in presence of CQ was detected (Fig. 4). In contrast, the reexpression of HLA-A2, -B51, and -Cw1 class I molecules was not altered by this drug (Fig. 4). These data indicate that the endosomal/lysosomal antigen processing pathway is HLA class I allele-dependent. With the drugs used in this study (Table 1), three different inhibition patterns of HLA class I expression were found (summarized in Table 2). The inhibition obtained in all HLA-class I alleles examined in presence of BFA indicates that most of the TAP-independent HLA-bound peptides were endogenously processed. The surface levels of HLA-A2 and -B51 class I were dependent on proteasome, metallo-aminopeptidases (probably ERAP), and SPPase activities. Metallo-aminopeptidases and CQ-sensitive processing are relevant for generating HLA-B27 ligands. By contrast, none of the compounds used in this study decreased HLA-Cw1 surface expression. This study was undertaken to compare the generation of the peptide repertoire associated with four different HLA class I molecules in TAP-deficient cells. Previously, the expression of various HLA class I molecules was differentially affected by proteasome inhibitors in TAP-sufficient cells (25Luckey C.J. Marto J.A. Partridge M. Hall E. White F.M. Lippolis J.D. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Engelhard V.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1212-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These inhibitors blocked the reexpression of HLA-A2 (60%) and -B51 (80%) class I molecules. In contrast, HLA-B27 was largely insensitive to proteasome inhibitors (only 30% of inhibition of reexpression) (25Luckey C.J. Marto J.A. Partridge M. Hall E. White F.M. Lippolis J.D. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Engelhard V.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1212-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the same study, the role of the proteasome in processing TAP-independent HLA-A2 ligands was reported (25Luckey C.J. Marto J.A. Partridge M. Hall E. White F.M. Lippolis J.D. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Engelhard V.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1212-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We found that a different MHC class I molecule, HLA-B51, is also proteasome-dependent in the generation of the HLA peptide repertoire in TAP-deficient cells. In addition, the proteasome inhibitors have no effect on the expression of TAP-independent peptide/HLA-B27 or -Cw1 repertoires. Thus, differential involvement of the proteasome in the generation of ligands bound to HLA class I molecules was found in this study. There was a direct correlation of the role of proteasomes in the processing of HLA peptide repertoires of TAP-dependent and -independent ligands between TAP-sufficient and -deficient cells. The role of SPase in the processing of TAP-independent presented HLA-A2 peptides has been found previously (17Wei M.L. Cresswell P. Nature. 1992; 356: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 18Henderson R.A. Michel H. Sakaguchi K. Shabanowitz J. Appella E. Hunt D.F. Engelhard V.H.

Immunol. 2008; 38: 1503-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Moreover, SPPase catalyzes intramembrane proteolysis of two signal peptides after they have been cleaved from a preprotein as the signal sequence-derived HLA-E peptides (19Weihofen A. Lemberg M.K. Ploegh H.L. Bogyo M. Martoglio B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30951-30956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 20Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Thus, sequential cleavage by SPase and SPPase was involved in the processing for some peptides. We found that the specific inhibitor for SPPase activity significantly decreased the HLA expression of some alleles in TAP-deficient cells involving these sequential enzymatic activities in the processing of TAP-independent ligands bound to HLA-A2 and -B51 class I molecules. It is well documented that trimming of ligand precursors in the ER is important for the generation of appropriate peptides for HLA class I binding and that ER-resident aminopeptidase activity has an important impact on the repertoire of ligands presented in TAP-sufficient cells (for review, see Ref. 49van Endert P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2011; 68: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that metallo-aminoprotease-sensitive trimming is also required to generate TAP-independent ligands presented by different HLA class I molecules. HLA-A2 and -B51 class I molecules demonstrated a similar HLA expression inhibition pattern involving the proteasome, SPPase, and metallo-aminopeptidase enzymatic activities in the generation of TAP-independent ligands. Thus, the most likely explanation is summarized via the following model. Multiple endogenous proteins are proteolyzed by the proteasome in the cytosol. Some of the generated peptides are released into the ER as indicated by the presentation in some instances of cytosolic proteins in cells lacking TAP (50Johnstone C. Guil S. García-Barreno B. López D. Melero J.A. Del Val M. J. Gen. Virol. 2008; 89: 2194-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 51Neumeister C. Nanan R. Cornu T. Lüder C. ter Meulen V. Naim H. Niewiesk S. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This presentation of peptides could occur by passive diffusion (52Lautscham G. Mayrhofer S. Taylor G. Haigh T. Leese A. Rickinson A. Blake N. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1053-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), hydrophobic peptides with specific ability to traverse membranes (53Lautscham G. Rickinson A. Blake N. Microbes Infect. 2003; 5: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), or unidentified transport. In parallel, SPase releases peptides with signal sequence into the ER. Finally, a fraction of total ER-peptides could be processed by SPPase activity and/or ERAP trimming prior to their binding to HLA-A2 or -B51 molecules. The presentation pathway for extracellular antigens requires endocytosis and degradation in endolysosomal compartments. HLA class II molecules bind the peptides generated, and these complexes are transported to the cell surface (54van den Hoorn T. Paul P. Jongsma M.L. Neefjes J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2011; 23: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Reagents that prevent endosomal acidification block this type of processing, inhibiting the protein cleavage by endosomal enzymes, such as the acidophilic amine CQ. Previously CQ-sensitive endosomal processing of internalized endogenous transmembrane proteins (23Tiwari N. Garbi N. Reinheckel T. Moldenhauer G. Hämmerling G.J. Momburg F. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 7932-7942Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) or viral particles (45Schirmbeck R. Melber K. Reimann J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) for the generation of murine MHC class I-binding peptides was reported. The current study shows the formation of the overall TAP-independent peptide-HLA-B27 complexes by a proteasome-independent but BFA- and CQ-sensitive pathway. These data imply that class I molecules on the cell surface are internalized to an endolysosomal compartment where they intersect with peptides either supplied by the lysosomal polypeptide transporter ABCB9, also named TAP-like (TAPL) (for review, see Ref. 55Bangert I. Tumulka F. Abele R. Biol. Chem. 2011; 392: 61-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or those directly processed by lysosomal proteases. In addition, some of these HLA-B27-restricted peptides need further trimming by metallo-aminopeptidases sensitive to leucinethiol. In addition, inhibition of the HLA-Cw1 surface expression was not detected with the chemicals used in this study. Thus, the identification of the different peptidase(s) of the antigen processing pathway involved in the generation of HLA-Cw1 ligand awaits further molecular and cellular biology studies. In summary, different and complex processing pathways involving at least four diverse proteolytic specificities in miscellaneous subcellular locations are required to generate the HLA class I peptide repertoire in TAP-deficient cells.

https://openalex.org/W2114804318,"The concurrent presentation of multiple stimuli in the visual field may trigger mutually suppressive interactions throughout the ventral visual stream. While several studies have been performed on sensory competition effects among non-face stimuli relatively little is known about the interactions in the human brain for multiple face stimuli. In the present study we analyzed the neuronal basis of sensory competition in an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study using multiple face stimuli. We varied the ratio of faces and phase-noise images within a composite display with a constant number of peripheral stimuli, thereby manipulating the competitive interactions between faces. For contralaterally presented stimuli we observed strong competition effects in the fusiform face area (FFA) bilaterally and in the right lateral occipital area (LOC), but not in the occipital face area (OFA), suggesting their different roles in sensory competition. When we increased the spatial distance among pairs of faces the magnitude of suppressive interactions was reduced in the FFA. Surprisingly, the magnitude of competition depended on the visual hemifield of the stimuli: ipsilateral stimulation reduced the competition effects somewhat in the right LOC while it increased them in the left LOC. This suggests a left hemifield dominance of sensory competition. Our results support the sensory competition theory in the processing of multiple faces and suggests that sensory competition occurs in several cortical areas in both cerebral hemispheres."

https://openalex.org/W2094385558,"γ-Secretase is composed of the four membrane proteins presenilin, nicastrin, Pen2, and Aph1. These four proteins assemble in a coordinated and regulated manner into a high molecular weight complex. The subunits constitute a total of 19 transmembrane domains (TMD), with many carrying important amino acids involved in catalytic activity, interaction with other subunits, or in ER retention/retrieval of unassembled subunits. We here focus on TMD4 of presenilin 1 (PS1) and show that a number of polar amino acids are critical for γ-secretase assembly and function. An asparagine, a threonine, and an aspartate form a polar interface important for endoplasmic reticulum retention/retrieval. A single asparagine in TMD4 of PS1 is involved in a protein-protein interaction by binding to another asparagine in Pen2. Intriguingly, a charged aspartate in TMD4 is critical for γ-secretase activity, most likely by stabilizing the newly formed complex."

IntroductionMammary gland development takes place essentially in the postnatal period under the influence of systemic hormones and locally synthesized growth factors. Prolactin, a polypeptide hormone synthesized in the anterior pituitary gland, is a major systemic regulator of mammary gland function, orchestrating lobualveolar differentiation at puberty (mammogenesis), milk production at the end of pregnancy (lactogenesis), and maintenance of milk secretion (galactopoiesis) (1Bole-Feysot C.

Activation (phosphorylation), dimerization, and nuclear translocation of STAT5 mediate the majority of prolactin-induced differentiation of mammary epithelial cells during pregnancy and lactation (5Liu X.

Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5538) Google Scholar) and seven ligands (8Schneider M.R. Wolf E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2009; 218: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), is a major local regulator of mammary gland activity. First, the four receptors and most ligands were shown to have a distinct, specific expression pattern in the virgin, pregnant, lactating, and involuting mammary gland (9Schroeder J.A. Lee D.C. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 451-464PubMed Google Scholar). Second, introduction of recombinant protein or retroviral expression of the EGFR ligands EGF, transforming growth factor-α (TGFA), and amphiregulin (AREG) induced ductal morphogenesis and lobular hyperplasia in the mouse mammary gland (10Vonderhaar B.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 132: 581-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 11Kenney N.J. Smith G.H. Rosenberg K. Cutler M.L. Dickson R.B. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1769-1781PubMed Google Scholar). Third, the phenotype of mice lacking individual receptors strongly suggest that each ERBB family member regulates different aspects of mammary gland development (reviewed in Refs. 12Troyer K.L.

For example, ERBB4 is required for STAT5 phosphorylation, and loss of ERBB4 activity results in impaired mammary gland differentiation (14Jones F.E. Welte T. Fu X.Y. Stern D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 15Tidcombe H. Jackson-Fisher A. Mathers K. Stern D.F. Gassmann M. Golding J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Development. 2003; 130: 5257-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Among the EGFR ligands, AREG appears to be the most important one because its loss impairs mammary gland development (17Luetteke N.C. Qiu T.H. Fenton S.E. Troyer K.L. Riedel R.F. Chang A. Lee D.C. Development. 1999; 126: 2739-2750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mechanistically, AREG is an essential mediator of estrogen receptor α (ERα) actions during puberty-induced ductal elongation, but dispensable for any earlier or later developmental stages of the mammary gland (18Ciarloni L. Mallepell S. Brisken C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 5455-5460Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar).In addition to this extensive, well documented local role of the EGFR system in the mammary gland, emerging evidence suggests that its members may influence mammary gland development indirectly by altering the expression and/or release of prolactin from the pituitary gland. It has been long known that lactotrophs express the EGFR and several of its ligands (19Finley E.L. King J.S. Ramsdell J.S. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 141: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Fan X. Childs G.V. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2284-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and that EGF can stimulate transcription of the prolactin gene (21Murdoch G.H. Potter E. Nicolaisen A.K. Evans R.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1982; 300: 192-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In this regard, the EGFR behaves similarly to recognized stimulators of prolactin release such as the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (22Schonbrunn A. Krasnoff M. Westendorf J.M. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 786-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and estrogen (23Watters J.J. Chun T.Y. Kim Y.N. Bertics P.J. Gorski J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1872-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Recently, Kansra and co-workers (24Ben-Jonathan N. Chen S. Dunckley J.A. LaPensee C. Kansra S. Endocrinology. 2009; 150: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) showed that, at least in cultured GH3 lactotrophs, EGF-induced prolactin expression and release are mediated by the ERα. However, the in vivo relevance of these findings remains to be demonstrated. In this report, we present data supporting the ability of the EGFR system to induce prolactin release from the pituitary gland in vivo.DISCUSSIONMembers of the EGFR/ERBB family are recognized local regulators of mammary gland development and function (see Introduction). In addition to this established local role of the EGFR system, it has been suggested that its members may also influence mammary gland activity indirectly by altering the expression and/or release of prolactin from the pituitary gland. However, so far available evidence is restricted to the expression of the EGFR and several of its ligands in lactotrophs (19Finley E.L. King J.S. Ramsdell J.S. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 141: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Fan X. Childs G.V. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2284-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and to in vitro data showing that EGF can induce prolactin expression and release from the pituitary gland (21Murdoch G.H. Potter E. Nicolaisen A.K. Evans R.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1982; 300: 192-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 24Ben-Jonathan N. Chen S. Dunckley J.A. LaPensee C. Kansra S. Endocrinology. 2009; 150: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).In this study, we provide for the first time in vivo evidence that activation of the EGFR in lactotrophs can induce release of prolactin from the pituitary gland into the circulation, resulting in a lactation-like phenotype in the mammary gland. This phenotype integrated the major hallmarks of lactogenesis, including growth of the mammary epithelial parenchyma (increased numbers of alveolar and side buds and increased alveoli area), phosphorylation of STAT5, and the presence of a milk-like secretion with proteins and lipid droplets in the luminar spaces of the acini and lactiferous ducts. Our studies initiated with the fortuitous observation of macroscopically visible changes in the mammary gland of transgenic females overexpressing the EGFR ligand betacellulin (25Schneider M.R. Dahlhoff M. Herbach N. Renner-Mueller I. Dalke C. Puk O. Graw J. Wanke R. Wolf E. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 5237-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The increased solidness and the reduced weight of the mammary glands from BTC-tg females can be attributed to the replacement of fat by mammary epithelial parenchyma. After characterizing the changes in whole mount preparations and histologically, we demonstrated that they were associated with reduced amounts of prolactin in the pituitary gland and concomitantly increased levels of the hormone in the circulation. To establish whether the lactation-like phenotype was a consequence of increased circulating prolactin, we treated BTC-tg females and control littermates with bromocriptine, a potent dopamine agonist. The disappearance of the mammary gland phenotype after treatment of BTC-tg mice with bromocriptine revealed that the lactation-like changes are attributable exclusively to increased prolactin release due to a central action of BTC in the pituitary gland, instead of a local action of the growth factor in the mammary gland. Finally, by crossing BTC-tg mice to Wa5 mice carrying an antimorphic Egfr allele (29Lee D. Cross S.H. Strunk K.E. Morgan J.E. Bailey C.L. Jackson I.J. Threadgill D.W. Mamm. Genome. 2004; 15: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we show that the changes observed in the mammary gland of BTC-tg are mediated by the EGFR instead of other ERBBs.In a recent publication, Kansra and co-workers (24Ben-Jonathan N. Chen S. Dunckley J.A. LaPensee C. Kansra S. Endocrinology. 2009; 150: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) showed in cultured GH3 lactotrophs that EGF can induce prolactin expression and release by increasing the phosphorylation of Ser-118 on the ERα in a MAPK-dependent manner. To assess whether the same pathways are responsible for the changes observed in the mammary gland of BTC-tg females, we evaluated the expression level and phosphorylation status of these molecules in their pituitary glands. While increased activation of the MAPK pathway was readily visible in the pituitary samples from BTC-tg females as compared with control littermates, no differences in the phosphorylation of Ser-104/106, Ser-118, or Ser-167 on the ERα were detectable between groups. The latter finding supports a general model in which the quite specific biological effects of the seven EGFR ligands are explained by the assembly and engagement of overlapping but distinct signaling pathways (8Schneider M.R. Wolf E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2009; 218: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been shown previously that EGF and BTC induce the phosphorylation of specific EGFR sites and further downstream pathways with different intensities (30Saito T. Okada S. Ohshima K. Yamada E. Sato M. Uehara Y. Shimizu H. Pessin J.E. Mori M. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 4232-4243Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Also, overexpression of the EGFR ligand TGF-α in the mouse pituitary lactotrophs results in local hyperplasia by 6 months and adenomas that were immunopositive for prolactin at 12 months (31McAndrew J. Paterson A.J. Asa S.L. McCarthy K.J. Kudlow J.E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4479-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), while tumors have never been seen in the pituitary glands of BTC-tg mice.At the moment, it can only be speculated about possible mechanisms involved in the BTC-induced release of prolactin. Pituitary lactotrophs are unique in having an inherent capacity for high constitutive production and release of prolactin, these processes being regulated in the form of tonic inhibition by dopamine via D2-type receptor, the predominant dopamine receptor in the pituitary lactotrophs (2Ben-Jonathan N. LaPensee C.R. LaPensee E.W. Endocr. Rev. 2008; 29: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 32Ben-Jonathan N. Hnasko R. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 724-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Although dopamine has been recognized as the physiological inhibitor of lactotrophs for decades, its exact mechanism of action is poorly understood. Further studies will be necessary to clarify whether BTC-stimulated release of prolactin occurs by overcoming the inhibitory action of dopamine or by acting in a dopamine-independent manner.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 15Tidcombe H. Jackson-Fisher A. Mathers K. Stern D.F. Gassmann M. Golding J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Development. 2003; 130: 5257-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Among the EGFR ligands, AREG appears to be the most important one because its loss impairs mammary gland development (17Luetteke N.C. Qiu T.H. Fenton S.E. Troyer K.L. Riedel R.F. Chang A. Lee D.C. Development. 1999; 126: 2739-2750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mechanistically, AREG is an essential mediator of estrogen receptor α (ERα) actions during puberty-induced ductal elongation, but dispensable for any earlier or later developmental stages of the mammary gland (18Ciarloni L. Mallepell S. Brisken C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 5455-5460Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar).In addition to this extensive, well documented local role of the EGFR system in the mammary gland, emerging evidence suggests that its members may influence mammary gland development indirectly by altering the expression and/or release of prolactin from the pituitary gland. It has been long known that lactotrophs express the EGFR and several of its ligands (19Finley E.L. King J.S. Ramsdell J.S. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 141: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Fan X. Childs G.V. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2284-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and that EGF can stimulate transcription of the prolactin gene (21Murdoch G.H. Potter E. Nicolaisen A.K. Evans R.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1982; 300: 192-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In this regard, the EGFR behaves similarly to recognized stimulators of prolactin release such as the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (22Schonbrunn A. Krasnoff M. Westendorf J.M. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 786-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and estrogen (23Watters J.J. Chun T.Y. Kim Y.N. Bertics P.J. Gorski J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1872-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Recently, Kansra and co-workers (24Ben-Jonathan N. Chen S. Dunckley J.A. LaPensee C. Kansra S. Endocrinology. 2009; 150: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) showed that, at least in cultured GH3 lactotrophs, EGF-induced prolactin expression and release are mediated by the ERα. However, the in vivo relevance of these findings remains to be demonstrated. In this report, we present data supporting the ability of the EGFR system to induce prolactin release from the pituitary gland in vivo."

Our understanding, however, of how memory phases interact is far from complete. In Drosophila, aversive olfactory learning is thought to progress from short-term through long-term memory phases. Another memory phase termed anesthesia resistant memory, dependent on the radish gene, influences memory hours after aversive olfactory learning. How does the radish-dependent phase influence memory performance in different tasks? It is found that the radish memory component does not scale with the stability of several memory traces, indicating a specific recruitment of this component to influence different memories, even within minutes of learning."

The gut-homing receptor α4β7 has been recently described as a new receptor for HIV. Here, we describe polymorphisms of ITGA4 gene in New World primates (NWP), and tested their impact on the binding to monoclonal antibodies, natural ligands (MAdCAM and VCAM), and several gp120 HIV-1 envelope proteins. Genomic DNA of NWP specimens comprising all genera of the group had their exons 5 and 6 (encoding the region of binding to the ligands studied) analyzed. The polymorphisms found were introduced into an ITGA4 cDNA clone encoding the human α4 subunit. Mutant α4 proteins were co-expressed with β7 and were tested for binding of mAbs, MAdCAM, VCAM and gp120 of HIV-1, which was compared to the wild-type (human) α4. Mutant α4 proteins harboring the K201E/I/N substitution had reduced binding of all ligands tested, including HIV-1 gp120 envelopes. The mAbs found with reduced biding included one from which a clinically-approved drug for the treatment of neurological disorders has been derived. α4 polymorphisms in other primate species may influence outcomes in the development and treatment of infectious and autoimmune diseases in humans and in non-human primates."
https://openalex.org/W2143937076,"Purposeful movements are attained by gradually adjusted activity of opposite muscles, or synergists. This requires a motor system that adequately modulates initiation and inhibition of movement and selectively activates the appropriate muscles. In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) initiation and inhibition of movements are impaired which may manifest itself in e.g. difficulty to start and stop walking. At single-joint level, impaired movement initiation is further accompanied by insufficient inhibition of antagonist muscle activity. As the motor symptoms in PD primarily result from cerebral dysfunction, quantitative investigation of gradually adjusted muscle activity during execution of purposeful movement is a first step to gain more insight in the link between impaired modulation of initiation and inhibition at the levels of (i) cerebrally coded task performance and (ii) final execution by the musculoskeletal system. To that end, the present study investigated changes in gradual adjustment of muscle synergists using a manipulandum that enabled standardized smooth movement by continuous wrist circumduction. Differences between PD patients (N = 15, off-medication) and healthy subjects (N = 16) concerning the relation between muscle activity and movement performance in these groups were assessed using kinematic and electromyographic (EMG) recordings. The variability in the extent to which a particular muscle was active during wrist circumduction – defined as muscle activity differentiation - was quantified by EMG. We demonstrated that more differentiated muscle activity indeed correlated positively with improved movement performance, i.e. higher movement speed and increased smoothness of movement. Additionally, patients employed a less differentiated muscle activity pattern than healthy subjects. These specific changes during wrist circumduction imply that patients have a decreased ability to gradually adjust muscles causing a decline in movement performance. We propose that less differentiated muscle use in PD patients reflects impaired control of modulated initiation and inhibition due to decreased ability to selectively and jointly activate muscles."
