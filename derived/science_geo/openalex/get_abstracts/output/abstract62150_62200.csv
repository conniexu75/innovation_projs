https://openalex.org/W1566586947,"Abstract With the exception of serine transacetylase, the enzymes concerned with the biosynthesis of l-cysteine in Salmonella typhimurium are subject to derepression by sulfur starvation and to repression by sulfide and cysteine. Sulfate permease was not assayed in these studies. Under conditions of sulfur starvation, O-acetyl-l-serine, a direct precursor of cysteine, is necessary for derepression and is therefore an internal inducer. Sulfide and cysteine block the effect of exogenous O-acetylserine. Cys E mutants lack serine transacetylase and are pleiotropic due to their inability to synthesize the internal inducer, O-acetylserine. Cys B also appears to be regulatory, since the auxotrophs which define this region are generally repressed for most of the biosynthetic pathway even under conditions of sulfur starvation and an excess of O-acetylserine. Normally an intact cys B region, sulfur starvation, and O-acetylserine are all necessary for derepression, but certain mutations in the cys B region lead to constitutivity in the presence of sulfide or cysteine, and in the absence of O-acetylserine."

These cells have similar receptive fields for both modalities and are directionally selective for both modalities, requiring stimuli moving laterally away from the animal. Perhaps cells that integrate auditory and visual information participate in the control of orienting and following responses to stimuli of both modalities."

https://openalex.org/W1558279610,"Abstract The uptake of the basic amino acids lysine, ornithine, and arginine is mediated by three transport systems in Escherichia coli K-12 strain 7. Lysine uptake occurs by means of two kinetically distinct systems. One system, with a Km of 10 µm is specific for lysine alone. The other system transports lysine with a Km of 0.5 µm, but this transport can be inhibited by arginine and ornithine. The transport of ornithine may be mediated by a single transport system (Km = 1.4 µm) which is inhibited by lysine and arginine. Arginine appears to be transported by means of a specific, high affinity system (Km = 2.6 x 10-8 m). This system is not inhibited by either lysine or ornithine. Osmotic shock causes a reduction in the initial rate of the high affinity lysine transport system, but does not affect the low affinity system. A lysine-arginine-ornithine-binding protein is found in the shock fluid, as well as two binding proteins specific for arginine. The lysine-arginine-ornithine-binding protein was purified by conventional techniques. Dissociation constants of 1.5, 3.0, and 5.0 µm were found for the complex of the binding protein, and arginine, lysine, and ornithine, respectively. A molecular weight of 26,200 to 30,200 was determined by three different methods. The protein showed an isoelectric point of 5.1 on isoelectric focusing."

https://openalex.org/W1555791296,"A relatively simple seven-step procedure is described whereby glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglyceromutase, and phosphoglycerate kinase can be purified from extracts of Escherichia coli. The purified preparations (50 to 100 mg) of the first two enzymes were homogeneous when examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 9 and by sedimentation techniques. The purified fraction of phosphoglycerate kinase contained small amounts of contaminating proteins. The molecular weights and s20, w0 values of the purified proteins were, respectively: glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, 144,000 and 7.5 S; phosphoglycerate kinase, 43,700 and 3.5 S; and phosphoglyceromutase, 56,300 and 4.8 S. The amounts of these enzymes in cell extracts varied with the carbon source which the cells utilized during growth, but the three activities were invariably present in constant proportion to one another. Calculation of the number of molecules of each enzyme present in such extracts indicated a nonequimolar distribution (ratio of glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase to phosphoglycerate kinase to phosphoglyceromutase, 1:2.4:3.6)."

Single pulses retarded the development of learning only when stringent learning criteria were required, whereas multiple pulses interfered with acquisition when the criteria for learning were less difficult."

https://openalex.org/W2082442186,"IT is generally held that in right handed people the parietooccipital area of the left cortical hemisphere is important for the ability to read. It is also known that the right hemisphere contributes more to non-verbal, visual and spatial functions than does the left. A demonstration of this functional asymmetry was provided by Kimura1, who showed that subjects were more accurate in reporting the number of dots presented tachistoscopically the left than in the right visual field. Conversely, letters were identified better when they were presented to the right visual field; that is, the left hemisphere."

https://openalex.org/W2010308944,"OBESITY is a bodily state in which an excessive accumulation of fat occurs, but it is not known whether it is the lipid content per cell1 or the total number of adipose cells2 which increases. Bray3 found that adipose cells from obese patients were larger than those from normal patients, and concluded that the gain or loss of weight in adults occurs chiefly through changes in the size of existing fat cells. Fat cells in vivo, however, are greatly influenced by the nutritional state of the patients, and observations in such conditions do not indicate whether there are acquired and/or inborn differences in adipose cells from normal and obese patients."

https://openalex.org/W1533562835,"Abstract The synthesis of guanosine 5'-diphosphate, 2'- (or 3'-) diphosphate (ppGpp) and related nucleotides was investigated in Escherichia coli in a variety of physiological conditions. The nucleotides are synthesized immediately following glucose or amino acid starvation or in the presence of cyanide. Nitrogen or sulfur starvation also results in synthesis of these nucleotides but with slower kinetics. The nucleotides are synthesized in amino acid starved T-even-infected stringent bacteria before phage DNA synthesis stops. The significance of these findings to the regulation of stable RNA and DNA synthesis is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1515694344,"Abstract Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase of Escherichia coli was purified to homogeneity. The molecular weight of the native protein, as determined by sedimentation equilibrium analyses, is 402,000. Sedimentation equilibrium analyses on the enzyme denatured in 3.5 m, 5 m, and 7 m guanidine hydrochloride gave a single species with a molecular weight of 99,590. Electrophoretic analyses of the enzyme in polyacrylamide gels in sodium dodecyl sulfate also gave a single species with a molecular weight of 107,000. These data indicate that the carboxylase is composed of four identical subunits, each having a molecular weight of approximately 100,000. Amino acid analyses indicate the presence of 36 cysteine residues per mole, all of which appear to exist as free sulfhydryl groups. The enzyme does not appear to be a metalloprotein. The partial specific volume is 0.737, the sedimentation coefficient is 12.3, and the specific reaction rate is 3.77 x 104 moles of substrate carboxylated per min per mole of enzyme. The diffusion coefficient and the frictional coefficient (f/f0) calculated from the molecular weight, V, and S gave values of 2.84 x 10-7 cm2 sec-1 and 1.53, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1534550010,"Abstract The mechanism of cystathionine γ-synthase is of interest because it catalyzes the replacement and elimination of substituents at the γ as well as the β position of amino acids. Decomposition of succinylhomoserine by γ elimination at 3–5° was accompanied by quenching and a shift to longer wave lengths of the enzyme's absorption maximum at 422 mµ and the appearance of a new absorption maximum at 485 mµ. These changes persisted as long as saturating levels of succinylhomoserine were present. In the presence of both cysteine and succinylhomoserine, the enzyme formed cystathionine by γ replacement; and α-ketobutyrate formation by γ elimination was undetectable until all the cysteine had been consumed. No spectral changes were observed during cystathionine synthesis. During pyruvate formation from succinylserine by β-elimination, the absorption band at 422 mµ was quenched and shifted to 430 mµ and transient absorption maxima appeared at 465 and 485 mµ. The maximum velocity of γ elimination from succinyl-homoserine was 22 times faster at 37° than at 5°, but the apparent Km for succinylhomoserine was constant over this range of temperature. The enthalpy and entropy of activation for the γ elimination reaction were calculated to be +16,800 cal per mole and +0.2 e.u., respectively. The optical rotatory dispersion spectrum of cystathionine γ-synthase showed a positive extrinsic Cotton effect centered at 422 mµ and a negative intrinsic Cotton effect centered near 222 mµ. The α helix content of the enzyme, calculated from the depth of the trough at 233 mµ, was 43%."

Nevertheless, several people have already drawn attention to conservation problems1–3, which are underlined by my own work on the decline of the South Polar skua (Catharacta maccormicki) at Cape Hallett (lat. 72° 18′ S, long. 170° 19′ E)."
https://openalex.org/W95943376,"Multiple functions of methyl-deficient tRNA m et, including those specific for initiator tRNA, were investigated and compared with normal tRNA m et. A comparison of the chromatographic properties of normal and methyl-deficient methionyl-tRNA showed identical elution profiles on methylated albumin-Kieselguhr, benzoylated o-(diethylaminoethyl)cellulose, and reverse phase chromatography (isoamylacetate) columns, but resolved a unique peak of methyl-deficient methionyl-tRNA on a reverse phase chromatography (Freon) column. We were unable to recover active pure methyl-deficient tRNA from this column, so that most subsequent studies had to be done on unfractionated methyl-deficient tRNA preparations. The only abnormality noted for methyl-deficient tRNA m et was a low velocity of acylation for the unique methyl-deficient peak. This was exhibited by examining the different patterns obtained on reverse phase chromatography for partially acylated compared to fully acylated tRNA m et. In all other ways tested the methyl-deficient tRNA m et functioned normally. Coding with AUG and GUG triplets was indistinguishable from normal as was the stimulation of this binding by purified initiation factors. Extent and rate of formylation, exclusion from recognition by bacterial elongation factors and function in NH2-terminal dipeptide synthesis all appeared to be normal in the methyl-deficient tRNA. Of peripheral interest was the finding that tRNA m etm appears to be acylated about 2.2 times more rapidly by purified methionyl-tRNA synthetase than tRNA m etf."
https://openalex.org/W1529377945,"Calf thymus DNA polymerase has been used to catalyze complementary synthesis with the templates d(T5-A203), d(T66-C15), and d(T47-C25), and d(C44-A169). Each reaction included a single deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate so as to limit complementary synthesis to a single segment of the template. In the absence of an oligodeoxyribonucleotide initiator complementary to a segment of the template, the products are looped and fold back upon themselves to form a hairpin structure. Two types of loops were found: one consisted almost entirely of template nucleotides and the other almost entirely of newly polymerized nucleotides. Reactions which utilized dT13 as initiator gave single initiation under one set of conditions and multiple initiation under another set. With templates which contained a dCn segment, dG2 was used as an initiator. In one case dG2 initiated at the 3' end of the template, and in another initiation took place at an internal position on the template. These examples show that there is considerable complexity to this type of reaction and that, by judicious choice of reactants and conditions, it is possible to synthesize a variety of unique and interesting double stranded polydeoxyribonucleotides."

https://openalex.org/W1509840210,Abstract 1. A cell membrane-DNA-RNA polymerase complex which contains virtually all of the RNA-synthetic capacity of the cell has been isolated from uninfected and R23-infected Escherichia coli. 2. Infection of E. coli by RNA bacteriophage R23 inhibits the RNA synthetic capacity of the membrane complex. In infected cells some of the RNA synthetic capacity is released from the membrane fraction. 3. The membrane fraction from infected cells synthesizes RNA at a considerably slower rate than that from uninfected cells. 4. R23 infection does not release any DNA from the membrane complex. 5. Exogenous E. coli RNA polymerase is able to synthesize more RNA on the membrane fraction from infected than from uninfected cells possibly because of alterations of the DNA template after infection. 6. DNA in the membrane preparation from infected cells is more sensitive to DNase digestion than that from uninfected cells.
