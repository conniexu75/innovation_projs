https://openalex.org/W1953958400,"A protocol for differentiating mouse and human pluripotent stem cells into muscle. During embryonic development, skeletal muscles arise from somites, which derive from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). Using PSM development as a guide, we establish conditions for the differentiation of monolayer cultures of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells into PSM-like cells without the introduction of transgenes or cell sorting. We show that primary and secondary skeletal myogenesis can be recapitulated in vitro from the PSM-like cells, providing an efficient, serum-free protocol for the generation of striated, contractile fibers from mouse and human pluripotent cells. The mouse ES cells also differentiate into Pax7+ cells with satellite cell characteristics, including the ability to form dystrophin+ fibers when grafted into muscles of dystrophin-deficient mdx mice, a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Fibers derived from ES cells of mdx mice exhibit an abnormal branched phenotype resembling that described in vivo, thus providing an attractive model to study the origin of the pathological defects associated with DMD."
https://openalex.org/W2227148039,"Anthracyclines are used in over 50% of childhood cancer treatment protocols, but their clinical usefulness is limited by anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (ACT) manifesting as asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction and congestive heart failure in up to 57% and 16% of patients, respectively. Candidate gene studies have reported genetic associations with ACT, but these studies have in general lacked robust patient numbers, independent replication or functional validation. Thus, the individual variability in ACT susceptibility remains largely unexplained. We performed a genome-wide association study in 280 patients of European ancestry treated for childhood cancer, with independent replication in similarly treated cohorts of 96 European and 80 non-European patients. We identified a nonsynonymous variant (rs2229774, p.Ser427Leu) in RARG highly associated with ACT (P = 5.9 × 10(-8), odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 4.7 (2.7-8.3)). This variant alters RARG function, leading to derepression of the key ACT genetic determinant Top2b, and provides new insight into the pathophysiology of this severe adverse drug reaction."

We create post-transcriptional circuits using RNA-binding proteins, which can be wired in a plug-and-play fashion to create networks of higher complexity. We show that the circuits function in mammalian cells when encoded in modified mRNA or self-replicating RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1094391616,"Histone methylation regulates DNA repair. However, the mechanisms that underlie the regulation of histone methylation during this repair remain to be further defined. Here, we show that exposure to ionizing radiation induces DNA-PK-dependent phosphorylation of nuclear fumarase at Thr 236, which leads to an interaction between fumarase and the histone variant H2A.Z at DNA double-strand break (DSB) regions. Locally generated fumarate inhibits KDM2B histone demethylase activity, resulting in enhanced dimethylation of histone H3 Lys 36; in turn, this increases the accumulation of the Ku70-containing DNA-PK at DSB regions for non-homologous end-joining DNA repair and cell survival. These findings reveal a feedback mechanism that underlies DNA-PK regulation by chromatin-associated fumarase and an instrumental function of fumarase in regulating histone H3 methylation and DNA repair. Lu and colleagues find that in response to ionizing radiation, DNA-PK phosphorylates fumarase breaks for local generation of fumarate, which in turn enhances DNA-PK recruitment by inhibiting histone H3 demethylation."
https://openalex.org/W1934938631,"Mutations that inhibit differentiation in stem cell lineages are a common early step in cancer development, but precisely how a loss of differentiation initiates tumorigenesis is unclear. We investigated Drosophila intestinal stem cell (ISC) tumours generated by suppressing Notch (N) signalling, which blocks differentiation. Notch-defective ISCs require stress-induced divisions for tumour initiation and an autocrine EGFR ligand, Spitz, during early tumour growth. On achieving a critical mass these tumours displace surrounding enterocytes, competing with them for basement membrane space and causing their detachment, extrusion and apoptosis. This loss of epithelial integrity induces JNK and Yki/YAP activity in enterocytes and, consequently, their expression of stress-dependent cytokines (Upd2, Upd3). These paracrine signals, normally used within the stem cell niche to trigger regeneration, propel tumour growth without the need for secondary mutations in growth signalling pathways. The appropriation of niche signalling by differentiation-defective stem cells may be a common mechanism of early tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2201635681,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of cell-autonomous gene expression that influence many biological processes. They are also released from cells and are present in virtually all body fluids, including blood, urine, saliva, sweat, and milk. The functional role of nutritionally obtained extracellular miRNAs is controversial, and irrefutable demonstration of exogenous miRNA uptake by cells and canonical miRNA function is still lacking. Here we show that miRNAs are present at high levels in the milk of lactating mice. To investigate intestinal uptake of miRNAs in newborn mice, we employed genetic models in which newborn miR-375 and miR-200c/141 knockout mice received milk from wild-type foster mothers. Analysis of the intestinal epithelium, blood, liver, and spleen revealed no evidence for miRNA uptake. miR-375 levels in hepatocytes were at the limit of detection and remained orders of magnitude below the threshold for target gene regulation (between 1000 and 10,000 copies/cell). Furthermore, our study revealed rapid degradation of milk miRNAs in intestinal fluid. Together, our results indicate a nutritional rather than gene-regulatory role of miRNAs in the milk of newborn mice."

https://openalex.org/W1415011740,"We present an unbiased method to globally resolve RNA structures through pairwise contact measurements between interacting regions. RNA proximity ligation (RPL) uses proximity ligation of native RNA followed by deep sequencing to yield chimeric reads with ligation junctions in the vicinity of structurally proximate bases. We apply RPL in both baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and human cells and generate contact probability maps for ribosomal and other abundant RNAs, including yeast snoRNAs, the RNA subunit of the signal recognition particle and the yeast U2 spliceosomal RNA homolog. RPL measurements correlate with established secondary structures for these RNA molecules, including stem-loop structures and long-range pseudoknots. We anticipate that RPL will complement the current repertoire of computational and experimental approaches in enabling the high-throughput determination of secondary and tertiary RNA structures."
https://openalex.org/W1956603330,"Background C2H2 zinc-finger (C2H2-ZF) proteins are a large gene family in plants that participate in various aspects of normal plant growth and development, as well as in biotic and abiotic stress responses. To date, no overall analysis incorporating evolutionary history and expression profiling of the C2H2-ZF gene family in model tree species poplar (Populus trichocarpa) has been reported. Principal Findings Here, we identified 109 full-length C2H2-ZF genes in P. trichocarpa, and classified them into four groups, based on phylogenetic analysis. The 109 C2H2-ZF genes were distributed unequally on 19 P. trichocarpa linkage groups (LGs), with 39 segmental duplication events, indicating that segmental duplication has been important in the expansion of the C2H2-ZF gene family. Promoter cis-element analysis indicated that most of the C2H2-ZF genes contain phytohormone or abiotic stress-related cis-elements. The expression patterns of C2H2-ZF genes, based on heatmap analysis, suggested that C2H2-ZF genes are involved in tissue and organ development, especially root and floral development. Expression analysis based on quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction indicated that C2H2-ZF genes are significantly involved in drought, heat and salt response, possibly via different mechanisms. Conclusions This study provides a thorough overview of the P. trichocarpa C2H2-ZF gene family and presents a new perspective on the evolution of this gene family. In particular, some C2H2-ZF genes may be involved in environmental stress tolerance regulation. PtrZFP2, 19 and 95 showed high expression levels in leaves and/or roots under environmental stresses. Additionally, this study provided a solid foundation for studying the biological roles of C2H2-ZF genes in Populus growth and development. These results form the basis for further investigation of the roles of these candidate genes and for future genetic engineering and gene functional studies in Populus."
https://openalex.org/W1494011542,"Quercetin-3-rutinoside inhibits thrombus formation in a mouse model by inhibiting extracellular protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), an enzyme required for platelet thrombus formation and fibrin generation. Prior studies have identified PDI as a potential target for novel antithrombotic agents. Using a fluorescence enhancement-based assay and isothermal calorimetry, we show that quercetin-3-rutinoside directly binds to the b′ domain of PDI with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The binding of quercetin-3-rutinoside to PDI induces a more compact conformation and restricts the conformational flexibility of PDI, as revealed by small angle x-ray scattering. The binding sites of quercetin-3-rutinoside to PDI were determined by studying its interaction with isolated fragments of PDI. Quercetin-3-rutinoside binds to the b′x domain of PDI. The infusion of the b′x fragment of PDI rescued thrombus formation that was inhibited by quercetin-3-rutinoside in a mouse thrombosis model. This b′x fragment does not possess reductase activity and, in the absence of quercetin-3-rutinoside, does not affect thrombus formation in vivo. The isolated b′ domain of PDI has potential as an antidote to reverse the antithrombotic effect of quercetin-3-rutinoside by binding and neutralizing quercetin-3-rutinoside."
https://openalex.org/W1805852575,"A patient-derived nude-mouse model of soft-tissue sarcoma has been established and treated in the following groups: (1) untreated controls; (2) gemcitabine (GEM) (80 mg/kg, ip, weekly, 3 weeks); (3) Pazopanib (100 mg/kg, orally, daily, 3 weeks) and (4) Salmonella typhimurium A1-R (5 × 10(7) CFU/body, ip, weekly, 3 weeks). The sarcoma was resistant to GEM (p = 0.879). Pazopanib tended to reduce the tumor volume compared to the untreated mice, but there was no significant difference (p = 0.115). S. typhimurium A1-R significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to the untreated mice (p = 0.001). S. typhimurium A1-R was the only effective treatment for the soft-tissue sarcoma nude mouse model among all treatments including a newly approved multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor; Pazopanib. These results suggest tumor-targeting S. typhimurium A1-R is a promising treatment for chemo-resistant soft-tissue sarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W1819219051,"The mechanisms by which different light spectra regulate plant shoot elongation vary, and phytohormones respond differently to such spectrum-associated regulatory effects. Light supplementation can effectively control seedling growth in Norway spruce. However, knowledge of the effective spectrum for promoting growth and phytohormone metabolism in this species is lacking. In this study, 3-year-old Norway spruce clones were illuminated for 12 h after sunset under blue or red light-emitting diode (LED) light for 90 d, and stem increments and other growth traits were determined. Endogenous hormone levels and transcriptome differences in the current needles were assessed to identify genes related to the red and blue light regulatory responses. The results showed that the stem increment and gibberellin (GA) levels of the seedlings illuminated by red light were 8.6% and 29.0% higher, respectively, than those of the seedlings illuminated by blue light. The indoleacetic acid (IAA) level of the seedlings illuminated by red light was 54.6% lower than that of the seedlings illuminated by blue light, and there were no significant differences in abscisic acid (ABA) or zeatin riboside [ZR] between the two groups of seedlings. The transcriptome results revealed 58,736,166 and 60,555,192 clean reads for the blue-light- and red-light-illuminated samples, respectively. Illumina sequencing revealed 21,923 unigenes, and 2744 (approximately 93.8%) out of 2926 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found to be upregulated under blue light. The main KEGG classifications of the DEGs were metabolic pathway (29%), biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (20.49%) and hormone signal transduction (8.39%). With regard to hormone signal transduction, AUXIN-RESISTANT1 (AUX1), AUX/IAA genes, auxin-inducible genes, and early auxin-responsive genes [(auxin response factor (ARF) and small auxin-up RNA (SAUR)] were all upregulated under blue light compared with red light, which might have yielded the higher IAA level. DELLA and phytochrome-interacting factor 3 (PIF3), involved in negative GA signaling, were also upregulated under blue light, which may be related to the lower GA level. Light quality also affects endogenous hormones by influencing secondary metabolism. Blue light promoted phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis and flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, accompanied by upregulation of most of the genes in their pathways. In conclusion, red light may promote stem growth by regulating biosynthesis of GAs, and blue light may promote flavonoid, lignin, phenylpropanoid and some hormones (such as jasmonic acid) which were related to plant defense in Norway spruce, which might reduce the primary metabolites available for plant growth."
https://openalex.org/W1934898674,"Insulin resistance and neuroinflammation have emerged as two likely key contributors in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD), especially in those sporadic AD cases compromised by diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition and its associated inflammatory response are hallmarks in sporadic AD brains. Elevated expression and activity of β-secretase 1 (BACE1), the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the β-cleavage of amyloid precursor proteins to Aβ peptides, are also observed in sporadic AD brains. Previous studies have suggested that there is therapeutic potential for retinoic acid in treating neurodegeneration based on decreased Aβ. Here we discovered that BACE1 expression is elevated in the brains of both Tg2576 transgenic mice and mice on high fat diets. These conditions are associated with a neuroinflammatory response. We found that administration of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) down-regulated the expression of BACE1 in the brains of Tg2576 mice and in mice fed a high fat diet. Moreover, in LPS-treated mice and cultured neurons, BACE1 expression was repressed by the addition of atRA, correlating with the anti-inflammatory efficacy of atRA. Mutations of the NFκB binding site in BACE1 promoter abolished the suppressive effect of atRA. Furthermore, atRA disrupted LPS-induced nuclear translocation of NFκB and its binding to BACE1 promoter as well as promoting the recruitment of the corepressor NCoR.

We recently reported that that BACE1 transcription is up-regulated by metabolic risk factors and that the key metabolic regulatory pathway of AMPK-SIRT1-PGC-1α (where AMPK is AMP-activated protein kinase) suppressed BACE1 transcription by directly acting on the first PPAR-responsive element (PPRE) in the BACE1 gene both in cultured neurons and in vivo settings (calorie restriction, etc.) (6Kwak Y.D.

Although the identification of several putative binding sites for NFκB and PPARγ in BACE1 promoter strongly implicates its regulation under inflammatory condition, compelling evidence is lacking.

In general, RA modulates its effects by binding to nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). RARs are ligand-dependent transcription factors that bind response elements as heterodimers with RXRs to regulate a large number of target genes (over 500 so far). RA exists in three main stereoisomeric forms, all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA), 13-cis RA, and 9-cis RA, among which atRA is the primary biologically active form in brain. RA also exerts anti-inflammatory efficacy via repressing the expression of inflammatory factors such as IL-6, IL-12, and TNFα (13Kirchmeyer M. Koufany M. Sebillaud S. Netter P. Jouzeau J.Y.

After perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, mouse brains were cryopreserved in 30% (w/v) sucrose/PBS at 4 °C overnight. Brain samples embedded in OCT were cut into coronal 20-μm sections and mounted on a glass. Brain sections were blocked at room temperature for 1 h in normal goat serum buffer (10% normal goat serum, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.02% NaN3 in TBS) and incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The subsequent incubation of fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies was performed at room temperature for 2 h. To visualize nucleus, sections were counterstained with DAPI (Invitrogen). After incubation with antibodies, all sections were washed three times with PBS, 10 min each time. The fluorescence was examined with microscopy. For immunocytochemistry, drug-treated rat primary neurons were briefly rinsed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.12 m sucrose in PBS. Neurons were permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Fixed neurons were blocked in 10% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and incubated in primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight.

Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with RealMasterMix SYBR ROX (5 Prime) according to the manufacturer's protocols using the same rat and mouse GAPDH primers, as well as rat BACE1 primers. Primers for TNFα (forward 5′-CCCTCACACTCAGATCATCTTCT-3′ and reverse 5′-GCTACGACGTGGGCTACAG-3′), IL-6 (forward 5′-GCTACCAAACTGGATATAATCAGGA-3′ and reverse 5′-CCAGGTAGCTATGGTACTCCAGAA-3′), and Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) (rat forward 5′-GGATGATGCCTCTCTTGCAT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TGATCCATGCATTGGTAGGTAA-3′; mouse forward 5′-GGACTCTGATCATGGCACTG-3′ and reverse 5′-CTGATCCATGCATTGGTAGGT-3′) were used in the present studies.

All quantitative data are presented as means ± S.D. Comparisons between groups were analyzed by Student's t test. We tested the effect of systemic administration of atRA on BACE1 expression in symptomatic Tg2576 mice overexpressing the transgene of human Swedish mutant of APP695. These mice expressed much higher BACE1 levels as compared with non-transgenic mice at the same age (Fig. 1, A and B). Continuous atRA treatment for 12 weeks significantly reduced BACE1 protein levels by 30% in the cortex of Tg2576 mice as compared with the vehicle-treated group (Fig. 1, A and B). Notably, BACE1 expression was only slightly decreased in atRA-treated non-transgenic mice, although there was no statistical significance due to the individual variation. These data suggest that atRA is more effective in inhibiting BACE1 under inflammatory conditions. In a previous study (39Thirumangalakudi L. Prakasam A. Zhang R. Bimonte-Nelson H. Sambamurti K. Kindy M.S. Bhat N.R. High cholesterol-induced neuroinflammation and amyloid precursor protein processing correlate with loss of working memory in mice.J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), neuroinflammation and a cognitive deficit in young WT C57BL/6 (B6) mice were induced by a high fat, high cholesterol diet (21% fat from milk with enriched cholesterol at 1.25%, HFD). We also found that young C57BL/6 mice consuming this HFD for 8 weeks demonstrated increased BACE1 expression (7Wang R. Li J.J. Diao S. Kwak Y.D. Liu L. Zhi L. Büeler H. Bhat N.R. Williams R.W. Park E.A. Liao F.F.

Therefore, we tested the effect of atRA on the elevated BACE1 expression in HFD mice. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, atRA administration for 8 weeks dramatically reduced BACE1 expression levels in the cortex of HFD mice to basal level in the control mice on the chow diet. Furthermore, quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed a significant decrease in the expression of the proinflammatory factors TNFα and IL-6 in atRA-treated HFD mice (Fig. 1, E and F), suggesting that the suppressive effect of atRA on BACE1 expression in Tg2576 and HFD mouse brains is correlated with its anti-inflammatory role. Although the Tg2576 and HFD mice develop a chronic inflammatory condition in the CNS, systemic LPS administration induces acute brain inflammation, which also leads to impaired memory (41Valero J. Mastrella G. Neiva I. Sánchez S. Malva J.O. Long-term effects of an acute and systemic administration of LPS on adult neurogenesis and spatial memory.Front. Neurosci. 2014; 8: 83Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We injected LPS intraperitoneally into C57BL/6 mice and observed dramatically increased TNFα and IL-6 expression in the cortex of LPS-treated mice several hours later (Fig. 2, A and B). The increased expression of TNFα and IL-6 was significantly inhibited by atRA pretreatment (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that atRA blocks LPS-induced acute neuroinflammation. Therefore, we tested the effect of atRA on BACE1 expression using this model. In a Western blot analysis with cortical lysates, a complete correction of BACE1 expression was observed in the atRA-LPS-treated mice as compared with the LPS-treated mice (Fig. 2, C and D). Because astrocytes and microglias are the major sources of neuroinflammation in vivo, we sought to investigate whether LPS-induced BACE1 regulation is primarily a neuronal or glial event. Immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 2E) revealed that the LPS-induced BACE1 co-localized with NeuN (a neuron-specific nuclear protein) and that this BACE1 was inhibited by atRA treatment. Neurons may directly respond to inflammatory agents due to neuronal expression of cytokine receptors such as the LPS and TNFα receptors (42Culpa"
https://openalex.org/W1864446190,"Salinity fluctuation is one of the main factors affecting the overall fitness of marine fish. In addition, water borne ammonia may occur simultaneously with salinity stress. Additionally, under such stressful circumstances, fish may encounter food deprivation. The physiological and ion-osmo regulatory adaptive capacities to cope with all these stressors alone or in combination are extensively addressed in fish. To date, studies revealing the modulation of antioxidant potential as compensatory response to multiple stressors are rather lacking. Therefore, the present work evaluated the individual and combined effects of salinity challenge, ammonia toxicity and nutritional status on oxidative stress and antioxidant status in a marine teleost, European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Fish were acclimated to normal seawater (32 ppt), to brackish water (20 ppt and 10 ppt) and to hypo-saline water (2.5 ppt). Following acclimation to different salinities for two weeks, fish were exposed to high environmental ammonia (HEA, 20 mg/L representing 50% of 96h LC50 value for ammonia) for 12 h, 48 h, 84 h and 180 h, and were either fed (2% body weight) or fasted (unfed for 7 days prior to HEA exposure). Results show that in response to decreasing salinities, oxidative stress indices such as xanthine oxidase activity, levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde, MDA) increased in the hepatic tissue of fasted fish but remained unaffected in fed fish. HEA exposure at normal salinity (32 ppt) and at reduced salinities (20 ppt and 10 ppt) increased ammonia accumulation significantly (84 h-180 h) in both feeding regimes which was associated with an increment of H2O2 and MDA contents. Unlike in fasted fish, H2O2 and MDA levels in fed fish were restored to control levels (84 h-180 h); with a concomitant increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), components of the glutathione redox cycle (reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity and reduced ascorbate (ASC) content. On the contrary, fasted fish could not activate many of these protective systems and rely mainly on CAT and ASC dependent pathways as antioxidative sentinels. The present findings exemplify that in fed fish single factors and a combination of HEA exposure and reduced seawater salinities (upto 10 ppt) were insufficient to cause oxidative damage due to the highly competent antioxidant system compared to fasted fish. However, the impact of HEA exposure at a hypo-saline environment (2.5 ppt) also defied antioxidant defence system in fed fish, suggesting this combined factor is beyond the tolerance range for both feeding groups. Overall, our results indicate that the oxidative stress mediated by the experimental conditions were exacerbated during starvation, and also suggest that feed deprivation particularly at reduced seawater salinities can instigate fish more susceptible to ammonia toxicity."

We sought to replicate and extend those findings in US undergraduate social drinkers (Study 1) and at-risk drinkers (Study 2). Three adaptations of the approach avoid task (AAT) were tested. The first adaptation - the approach avoid training - was a replication and targeted implicit alcohol approach associations. The remaining two adaptations - the general identity and personalized identity trainings - targeted implicit drinking identity associations, which are robust predictors of hazardous drinking in US undergraduates. Study 1 included 300 undergraduate social drinkers. They were randomly assigned to real or sham training conditions for one of the three training adaptations, and completed two training sessions, spaced one week apart. Study 2 included 288 undergraduates at risk for alcohol use disorders. The same training procedures were used, but the two training sessions occurred within a single week. Results were not as expected. Across both studies, the approach avoid training yielded no evidence of training effects on implicit alcohol associations or alcohol outcomes. The general identity training also yielded no evidence of training effects on implicit alcohol associations or alcohol outcomes with one exception; individuals who completed real training demonstrated no changes in drinking refusal self-efficacy whereas individuals who completed sham training had reductions in self-efficacy. Finally, across both studies, the personalized identity training yielded no evidence of training effects on implicit alcohol associations or alcohol outcomes. Despite having relatively large samples and using a well-validated training task, study results indicated all three training adaptations were ineffective at this dose in US undergraduates. These findings are important because training studies are costly and labor-intensive. Future research may benefit from focusing on more severe populations, pairing training with other interventions, increasing training dose, and increasing gamification of training tasks."

A radioimmunoassay (RIA) was used to detect serum FSH, luteinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol (E2). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to measure forearm BMD. Then, we analyzed the age-related changes in serum FSH, LH and E2. Additionally, FSH serum concentrations were compared between a group of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and a control group. Osteoclasts were induced from RAW264.7 cells in vitro by receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), and these cells were treated with 0, 5, 10, and 20 ng/ml FSH. After the osteoclasts matured, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining was used to identify osteoclasts, and the mRNA expression levels of genes involved in osteoclastic phenotypes and function, such as receptor activator of NF-κB (Rank), Trap, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (Mmp-9) and Cathepsin K, were detected in different groups using real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction).1. FSH serum concentrations in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis increased notably compared with the control group. 2. RANKL induced RAW264.7 cell differentiation into mature osteoclasts in vitro. 3. FSH increased mRNA expression of genes involved in osteoclastic phenotypes and function, such as Rank, Trap, Mmp-9 and Cathepsin K, in a dose-dependent manner.The circulating concentration of FSH may play an important role in the acceleration of bone loss in postmenopausal women.

We have demonstrated previously that microRNAs encoded by the Gtl2-Dio3 noncoding RNA locus function downstream of the MEF2A transcription factor in skeletal muscle regeneration. We have also reported expression of these miRNAs in the heart. Here we investigated the role of two Gtl2-Dio3 miRNAs, miR-410 and miR-495, in cardiac muscle. Overexpression of miR-410 and miR-495 robustly stimulated cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis and proliferation. Interestingly, unlike our findings in skeletal muscle, these miRNAs did not modulate the activity of the WNT signaling pathway. Instead, these miRNAs targeted Cited2, a coactivator required for proper cardiac development. Consistent with miR-410 and miR-495 overexpression, siRNA knockdown of Cited2 in neonatal cardiomyocytes resulted in robust proliferation. This phenotype was associated with reduced expression of Cdkn1c/p57/Kip2, a cell cycle inhibitor, and increased expression of VEGFA, a growth factor with proliferation-promoting effects. Therefore, miR-410 and miR-495 are among a growing number of miRNAs that have the ability to potently stimulate neonatal cardiomyocyte proliferation."

We previously observed reduced lung function in mice lacking the fatty acid oxidation enzyme long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD). Here, we demonstrate that long-chain acylcarnitines, a class of lipids secreted by mitochondria when metabolism is inhibited, accumulate at the air-fluid interface in LCAD−/− lungs. Acylcarnitine accumulation is exacerbated by stress such as influenza infection or by dietary supplementation with l-carnitine. Long-chain acylcarnitines co-localize with pulmonary surfactant, a unique film of phospholipids and proteins that reduces surface tension and prevents alveolar collapse during breathing. In vitro, the long-chain species palmitoylcarnitine directly inhibits the surface adsorption of pulmonary surfactant as well as its ability to reduce surface tension. Treatment of LCAD−/− mice with mildronate, a drug that inhibits carnitine synthesis, eliminates acylcarnitines and improves lung function. Finally, acylcarnitines are detectable in normal human lavage fluid. Thus, long-chain acylcarnitines may represent a risk factor for lung injury in humans with dysfunctional fatty acid oxidation.

https://openalex.org/W1552690965,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common complication after kidney transplantation, often associated to graft loss and increased healthcare costs. Kidney transplant patients (KTPs) are particularly susceptible to infection by Enterobacteriaceae-producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs). A retrospective case-control study was conducted to identify independent risk factors for ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in non-hospitalized KTPs with UTI. Forty-nine patients suffering from UTI by ESBL-producing bacteria (ESBL-P) as case group and the same number of patients with UTI by ESBL negative (ESBL-N) as control-group were compared. Clinical data, renal function parameters during UTI episodes, UTI recurrence and relapsing rate, as well as risk factors for recurrence, molecular characterization of isolates and the respective antimicrobial susceptibility profile were evaluated. Diabetes mellitus (p <0.007), previous antibiotic prophylaxis (p=0.017) or therapy (p<0.001), previous UTI (p=0.01), relapsing infection (p=0.019) and patients with delayed graft function after transplant (p=0.001) represented risk factors for infection by ESBL positive Enterobacteriaceae in KTPs. Interestingly, the period of time between data of transplantation and data of UTI was shorter in case of ESBL-P case-group (28.8 months) compared with ESBL-N control-group (50.9 months). ESBL-producing bacteria exhibited higher resistance to fluoroquinolones (p=0.002), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (p<0.001) and gentamicin (p<0.001). Molecular analysis showed that blaCTX-M was the most common ESBL encoding gene (65.3%), although in 55.1% of the cases more than one ESBL gene was found. In 29.4% of K. pneumoniae isolates, three bla-genes (blaCTX-M-blaTEM-blaSHV) were simultaneously detected. Low estimated glomerular filtration rate (p=0.009) was found to be risk factor for UTI recurrence. Over 60% of recurrent UTI episodes were caused by genetically similar strains. UTI by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in KTPs represent an important clinical challenge regarding not only hospitalized patients but also concerning outpatients."

Among the participants with hypertension, the awareness, treatment and control of hypertension all significantly increased from 69.8% to 74.5%, 50.3% to 63.7%, and 15.3% to 30.3%, respectively, from 2001 to 2010. A logistic regression showed that a higher education level, a higher BMI, a family history of hypertension and doctor-diagnosed cardiovascular disease were significantly associated with hypertension awareness and treatment.Hypertension prevalence increased rapidly between the years surveyed. Although the awareness, treatment and control of hypertension improved significantly, the values of these variables remained low. More attention should be given to the elderly because the population is aging worldwide, and urgent action, optimal treatment approaches and proper public health strategies must be taken to prevent and manage hypertension."

The main apical membrane neutral amino acid transporters in mouse intestine and kidney, B0AT1 and B0AT3, require the ancillary protein collectrin or ACE2 for plasma membrane expression. Expression and activity of SLC6 neurotransmitter transporters are modulated by interaction with syntaxin 1A. Utilizing monocarboxylate-B0AT1/3 fusion constructs, we discovered that collectrin is also necessary for B0AT1 and B0AT3 catalytic function. Syntaxin 1A and syntaxin 3 inhibit the membrane expression of B0AT1 by competing with collectrin for access. A mutagenesis screening approach identified residues on trans-membrane domains 1α, 5, and 7 on one face of B0AT3 as a key region involved in interaction with collectrin. Mutant analysis established residues that were involved in collectrin-dependent functions as follows: plasma membrane expression of B0AT3, catalytic activation, or both. These results identify a potential binding site for collectrin and other SLC6 ancillary proteins.

Although n-6 PUFA demonstrates anti-atherosclerotic properties, survival following cardiac remodeling may be compromised. We hypothesized that n-6 PUFA like linoleic acid (LA) or other downstream PUFAs like γ-linolenic acid or arachidonic acid alter the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)-collagen axis in the heart. Excess dietary LA increased the collagen I/III ratio in the mouse myocardium, leading to cardiac “stiffening” characterized by impaired transmitral flow indicative of early diastolic dysfunction within 5 weeks. In vitro, LA under TGFβ1 stimulation increased collagen I and lysyl oxidase (LOX), the enzyme that cross-links soluble collagen resulting in deposited collagen. Overexpression of fatty acid desaturase 2 (fads2), which metabolizes LA to downstream PUFAs, reduced collagen deposits, LOX maturation, and activity with LA, whereas overexpressing fads1, unrelated to LA desaturation, did not. Furthermore, fads2 knockdown by RNAi elevated LOX activity and collagen deposits in fibroblasts with LA but not oleic acid, implying a buildup of LA for aggravating such pro-fibrotic effects. As direct incubation with γ-linolenic acid or arachidonic acid also attenuated collagen deposits and LOX activity, we concluded that LA itself, independent of other downstream PUFAs, promotes the pro-fibrotic effects of n-6 PUFA. Overall, these results attempt to reconcile opposing views of n-6 PUFA on the cardiovascular system and present evidence supporting a cardiac muscle-specific effect of n-6 PUFAs. Therefore, aggravation of the collagen I/III ratio and cardiac stiffening by excess n-6 PUFA represent a novel pathway of cardiac lipotoxicity caused by high n-6 PUFA diets.

The majority were broad host range phages targeting more than one Gordonia species. When their genomes were sequenced, they all emerged as double stranded DNA Siphoviridae phages, ranging from 17,562 to 103,424 bp in size, and containing between 27 and 127 genes, many of which were detailed for the first time. Many of these phage genomes diverged from the expected modular genome architecture of other characterized Siphoviridae phages and contained unusual lysis gene arrangements. Whole genome sequencing also revealed that infection with lytic phages does not appear to prevent spontaneous prophage induction in Gordonia malaquae lysogen strain BEN700.

https://openalex.org/W2328732985,"O-Linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is a post-translational modification of proteins in multicellular organisms. O-GlcNAc modification is catalyzed by the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which transfers N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from the nucleotide sugar donor UDP-GlcNAc to serine or threonine residues of protein substrates. Recently, we reported a novel metabolic labeling method to introduce the diazirine photocross-linking functional group onto O-GlcNAc residues in mammalian cells. In this method, cells are engineered to produce diazirine-modified UDP-GlcNAc (UDP-GlcNDAz), and the diazirine-modified GlcNAc analog (GlcNDAz) is transferred to substrate proteins by endogenous OGT, producing O-GlcNDAz. O-GlcNDAz-modified proteins can be covalently cross-linked to their binding partners, providing information about O-GlcNAc-dependent interactions. The utility of the method was demonstrated by cross-linking highly O-GlcNAc-modified nucleoporins to proteins involved in nuclear transport. For practical application of this method to a broader range of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins, efficient O-GlcNDAz production is critical. Here we examined the ability of OGT to transfer GlcNDAz and found that the wild-type enzyme (wtOGT) prefers the natural substrate, UDP-GlcNAc, over the unnatural UDP-GlcNDAz. This competition limits O-GlcNDAz production in cells and the extent of O-GlcNDAz-dependent cross-linking. Here we identified an OGT mutant, OGT(C917A), that efficiently transfers GlcNDAz and, surprisingly, has altered substrate specificity, preferring to transfer GlcNDAz rather than GlcNAc to protein substrates. We confirmed the reversed substrate preference by determining the Michaelis-Menten parameters describing the activity of wtOGT and OGT(C917A) with both UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcNDAz. Use of OGT(C917A) enhances O-GlcNDAz production, yielding improved cross-linking of O-GlcNDAz-modified molecules both in vitro and in cells.

https://openalex.org/W2229135584,"Aberrant deposition of fat including free fatty acids in the liver often causes damage to hepatocytes, namely lipotoxicity, which is a key pathogenic event in the development and progression of fatty liver diseases. This study demonstrates a pivotal role of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) in protecting hepatocytes from lipotoxicity. Exposure of primary murine hepatocytes to palmitate resulted in dose-dependent cell death, which was enhanced significantly in Sphk1-deficient cells. In keeping with this, expression of dominant-negative mutant SphK1 also markedly promoted palmitate-induced cell death. In contrast, overexpression of wild-type SphK1 profoundly protected hepatocytes from lipotoxicity. Mechanistically, the protective effect of SphK1 is attributable to suppression of ER stress-mediated pro-apoptotic pathways, as reflected in the inhibition of IRE1α activation, XBP1 splicing, JNK phosphorylation, and CHOP induction. Of note, SphK1 inhibited the IRE1α pathway by reducing IRE1α expression at the transcriptional level. Moreover, S1P mimicked the effect of SphK1, suppressing IRE1α expression in a receptor-dependent manner. Furthermore, enforced overexpression of IRE1α significantly blocked the protective effect of SphK1 against lipotoxicity. Therefore, this study provides new insights into the role of SphK1 in hepatocyte survival and uncovers a novel mechanism for protection against ER stress-mediated cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1735659325,"Despite its high prevalence, relatively little is known about the pathophysiology of somnambulism. Increasing evidence indicates that somnambulism is associated with functional abnormalities during wakefulness and that sleep deprivation constitutes an important drive that facilitates sleepwalking in predisposed patients. Here, we studied the neural mechanisms associated with somnambulism using Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) with 99mTc-Ethylene Cysteinate Dimer (ECD), during wakefulness and after sleep deprivation.Ten adult sleepwalkers and twelve controls with normal sleep were scanned using 99mTc-ECD SPECT in morning wakefulness after a full night of sleep. Eight of the sleepwalkers and nine of the controls were also scanned during wakefulness after a night of total sleep deprivation. Between-group comparisons of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were performed to characterize brain activity patterns during wakefulness in sleepwalkers.During wakefulness following a night of total sleep deprivation, rCBF was decreased bilaterally in the inferior temporal gyrus in sleepwalkers compared to controls.Functional neural abnormalities can be observed during wakefulness in somnambulism, particularly after sleep deprivation and in the inferior temporal cortex. Sleep deprivation thus not only facilitates the occurrence of sleepwalking episodes, but also uncovers patterns of neural dysfunction that characterize sleepwalkers during wakefulness."

To gain mechanistic insight into these processes, it is important to understand the cellular origin of cytokines because both cytokine input and cytokine-producing cells play key roles. Here, we determined cytokine responses by monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs) to purified Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium berghei ANKA, and by spleen macrophages and DCs from Plasmodium yoelii 17NXL-infected and P. berghei ANKA-infected mice. The results demonstrate that monocytes and macrophages do not produce inflammatory cytokines to malaria parasites and that DCs are the primary source early in infection, and DC subsets differentially produce cytokines. Importantly, blocking of phagosomal acidification by inhibiting vacuolar-type H+-ATPase enabled macrophages to elicit cytokine responses. Because cytokine responses to malaria parasites are mediated primarily through endosomal Toll-like receptors, our data indicate that the inability of macrophages to produce cytokines is due to the phagosomal acidification that disrupts endosomal ligand-receptor engagement. Macrophages efficiently produced cytokines to LPS upon simultaneously internalizing parasites and to heat-killed Escherichia coli, demonstrating that phagosomal acidification affects endosomal receptor-mediated, but not cell surface receptor-mediated, recognition of Toll-like receptor agonists. Enabling monocytes/macrophages to elicit immune responses to parasites by blocking endosomal acidification can be a novel strategy for the effective development of protective immunity to malaria. The results have important implications for enhancing the efficacy of a whole parasite-based malaria vaccine and for designing strategies for the development of protective immunity to pathogens that induce immune responses primarily through endosomal receptors.

https://openalex.org/W1951605185,"Objective The objective was to evaluate the association of peripheral and central hearing abilities with cognitive function in older adults. Methods Recruited from epidemiological studies of aging and cognition at the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center, participants were a community-dwelling cohort of older adults (range 63–98 years) without diagnosis of dementia. The cohort contained roughly equal numbers of Black (n=61) and White (n=63) subjects with groups similar in terms of age, gender, and years of education. Auditory abilities were measured with pure-tone audiometry, speech-in-noise perception, and discrimination thresholds for both static and dynamic spectral patterns. Cognitive performance was evaluated with a 12-test battery assessing episodic, semantic, and working memory, perceptual speed, and visuospatial abilities. Results Among the auditory measures, only the static and dynamic spectral-pattern discrimination thresholds were associated with cognitive performance in a regression model that included the demographic covariates race, age, gender, and years of education. Subsequent analysis indicated substantial shared variance among the covariates race and both measures of spectral-pattern discrimination in accounting for cognitive performance. Among cognitive measures, working memory and visuospatial abilities showed the strongest interrelationship to spectral-pattern discrimination performance. Conclusions For a cohort of older adults without diagnosis of dementia, neither hearing thresholds nor speech-in-noise ability showed significant association with a summary measure of global cognition. In contrast, the two auditory metrics of spectral-pattern discrimination ability significantly contributed to a regression model prediction of cognitive performance, demonstrating association of central auditory ability to cognitive status using auditory metrics that avoided the confounding effect of speech materials."

Our recent study of insulin secretory granules (ISG) (MacDonald, M. J., Ade, L., Ntambi, J. M., Ansari, I. H., and Stoker, S. W. (2015) Characterization of phospholipids in insulin secretory granules in pancreatic beta cells and their changes with glucose stimulation. J. Biol. Chem. 290, 11075–11092) suggested that phosphatidylserine and other phospholipids, such as phosphatidylethanolamine, in ISG could play important roles in docking and fusion of ISG to the plasma membrane in the pancreatic beta cell during insulin exocytosis. P4 ATPase flippases translocate primarily phosphatidylserine and, to a lesser extent, phosphatidylethanolamine across the lipid bilayers of intracellular vesicles and plasma membranes to the cytosolic leaflets of these membranes. CDC50A is a protein that forms a heterodimer with P4 ATPases to enhance their translocase catalytic activity. We found that the predominant P4 ATPases in pure pancreatic beta cells and human and rat pancreatic islets were ATP8B1, ATP8B2, and ATP9A. ATP8B1 and CDC50A were highly concentrated in ISG. ATP9A was concentrated in plasma membrane. Gene silencing of individual P4 ATPases and CDC50A inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin release in pure beta cells and in human pancreatic islets. This is the first characterization of P4 ATPases in beta cells. The results support roles for P4 ATPases in translocating phosphatidylserine to the cytosolic leaflets of ISG and the plasma membrane to facilitate the docking and fusion of ISG to the plasma membrane during insulin exocytosis."

Here we show that TbTim62, a novel protein, is localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane, and its import into mitochondria depends on TbTim17. Knockdown (KD) of TbTim62 decreased the steady-state levels of TbTim17 post-transcriptionally. Further analysis showed that import of TbTim17 into mitochondria was not inhibited, but its half-life was reduced >4-fold due to TbTim62 KD. Blue-native gel electrophoresis revealed that TbTim62 is present primarily in ∼150-kDa and also in ∼1100-kDa protein complexes, whereas TbTim17 is present in multiple complexes within the range of ∼300 to ∼1100 kDa. TbTim62 KD reduced the levels of both TbTim62 as well as TbTim17 protein complexes. Interestingly, TbTim17 was accumulated as lower molecular mass complexes in TbTim62 KD mitochondria.

Here, solexa sequencing technology was further performed to compare mRNA expression between XY and YY testis. Compared with unigenes expressed in XY testis, 1146 and 1235 unigenes have significantly higher and lower expression in YY testis, respectively. 605 differentially expressed unigenes were annotated to 1604 GO terms with 319 and 286 genes having relative higher expression in XY and YY testis. KEGG analysis suggested different levels of PI3K-AKT and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways between XY and YY testis. Down-regulation of miR-141/429 in YY testis was speculated to promote testis development and maturation, and several factors in PI3K-AKT and GPCR signaling pathways were found as predicted targets of miR-141/429, several of which were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assays.

These assays are complex, challenging to implement in a format allowing detection of several types of antibody-analyte interactions at once (multiplex), and troublesome to implement in the field. As an alternative, we have developed a hemagglutinin microarray on the Arrayed Imaging Reflectometry (AIR) platform. AIR provides sensitive, rapid, and label-free multiplex detection of targets in complex analyte samples such as serum. In preliminary work, we demonstrated the application of this array to the testing of human samples from a vaccine trial. Here, we report the application of an expanded label-free hemagglutinin microarray to the analysis of avian serum samples. Samples from influenza virus challenge experiments in mallards yielded strong, selective detection of antibodies to the challenge antigen in most cases. Samples acquired in the field from mallards were also analyzed, and compared with viral hemagglutinin inhibition and microneutralization assays. We find that the AIR hemagglutinin microarray can provide a simple and robust alternative to standard methods, offering substantially greater information density from a simple workflow."

This cultivation occurs on compost, but not all of this substrate is consumed by the fungus. To determine why certain fractions remain unused, carbohydrate degrading enzymes, water-extracted from mushroom-grown compost at different stages of mycelium growth and fruiting body formation, were analyzed for their ability to degrade a range of polysaccharides. Mainly endo-xylanase, endo-glucanase, β-xylosidase and β-glucanase activities were determined in the compost extracts obtained during mushroom growth. Interestingly, arabinofuranosidase activity able to remove arabinosyl residues from doubly substituted xylose residues and α-glucuronidase activity were not detected in the compost enzyme extracts. This correlates with the observed accumulation of arabinosyl and glucuronic acid substituents on the xylan backbone in the compost towards the end of the cultivation. Hence, it was concluded that compost grown A. bisporus lacks the ability to degrade and consume highly substituted xylan fragments."

As personalized genomics has become more common, we hypothesized it could be a valuable tool to make science education more hands on, personal, and engaging for college undergraduates. We hypothesized that providing students with personal genome testing kits would enhance the learning experience of students in two undergraduate courses at Brigham Young University: Advanced Molecular Biology and Genomics. These courses have an emphasis on personal genomics the last two weeks of the semester. Students taking these courses were given the option to receive personal genomics kits in 2014, whereas in 2015 they were not. Students sent their personal genomics samples in on their own and received the data after the course ended. We surveyed students in these courses before and after the two-week emphasis on personal genomics to collect data on whether anticipation of obtaining their own personal genomic data impacted undergraduate student learning. We also tested to see if specific personal genomic assignments improved the learning experience by analyzing the data from the undergraduate students who completed both the pre- and post-course surveys. Anticipation of personal genomic data significantly enhanced student interest and the learning environment based on the time students spent researching personal genomic material and their self-reported attitudes compared to those who did not anticipate getting their own data. Personal genomics homework assignments significantly enhanced the undergraduate student interest and learning based on the same criteria and a personal genomics quiz. We found that for the undergraduate students in both molecular biology and genomics courses, incorporation of personal genomic testing can be an effective educational tool in undergraduate science education."
https://openalex.org/W1100200360,"Small RNAs (sRNAs) play important roles in plant development and host-pathogen interactions. Several studies have highlighted the relationship between viral infections, endogenous sRNA accumulation and transcriptional changes associated with symptoms. However, few studies have described a global analysis of endogenous sRNAs by comparing related viruses at early stages of infection, especially before viral accumulation reaches systemic tissues. An sRNA high-throughput sequencing of Arabidopsis thaliana leaf samples infected either with Oilseed rape mosaic virus (ORMV) or crucifer-infecting Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV-Cg) with slightly different symptomatology at two early stages of infection (2 and 4dpi) was performed. At early stages, both viral infections strongly alter the patterns of several types of endogenous sRNA species in distal tissues with no virus accumulation suggesting a systemic signaling process foregoing to virus spread. A correlation between sRNAs derived from protein coding genes and the associated mRNA transcripts was also detected, indicating that an unknown recursive mechanism is involved in a regulatory circuit encompassing this sRNA/mRNA equilibrium. This work represents the initial step in uncovering how differential accumulation of endogenous sRNAs contributes to explain the massive alteration of the transcriptome associated with plant-virus interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1934265608,"Mitogenomes of flatfishes (Pleuronectiformes) exhibit the greatest diversity of gene rear-rangements in teleostean fishes. Duplicate control regions (CRs) have been found in the mito-genomes of two flatfishes, Samariscus latus (Samaridae) and Laeops lanceolata (Bothidae), which is rare in teleosts. It has been reported that duplicate CRs have evolved in a concerted fashion in fishes and other animals, however, whether concerted evo-lution exists in flatfishes remains unknown. In this study, based on five newly sequenced and six previously reported mitogenomes of lefteye flounders in the Bothidae, we explored whether duplicate CRs and concerted evolution exist in these species. Results based on the present study and previous reports show that four out of eleven bothid species examined have duplicate CRs of their mitogenomes. The core regions of the duplicate CRs of mitogenomes in the same species have identical, or nearly identical, sequences when compared to each other. This pattern fits the typical characteristics of concerted evolution. Additionally, phylogenetic and ancestral state reconstruction analysis also provided evidence to support the hypothesis that duplicate CRs evolved concertedly. The core region of concerted evolution is situated at the conserved domains of the CR of the mitogenome from the termination associated sequences (TASs) to the conserved sequence blocks (CSBs). Commonly, this region is con-sidered to regulate mitochondrial replication and transcription. Thus, we hypothesize that the cause of concerted evolution of the duplicate CRs in the mtDNAs of these four bothids may be related to some function of the conserved sequences of the CRs during mitochondrial rep-lication and transcription. We hope our results will provide fresh insight into the molecular mechanisms related to replication and evolution of mitogenomes."

However, scientific evidence to ascertain the underlying cause of the lower urinary tract symptoms in SCD is lacking.Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate urinary function, in vivo and ex vivo, in the Berkeley SCD murine model (SS).Urine output was measured in metabolic cage for both wild type and SS mice (25-30 g). Bladder strips and urethra rings were dissected free and mounted in organ baths. In isolated detrusor smooth muscle (DSM), relaxant response to mirabegron and isoproterenol (1nM-10μM) and contractile response to (carbachol (CCh; 1 nM-100μM), KCl (1 mM-300mM), CaCl2 (1μM-100mM), α,β-methylene ATP (1, 3 and 10 μM) and electrical field stimulation (EFS; 1-32 Hz) were measured. Phenylephrine (Phe; 10nM-100μM) was used to evaluate the contraction mechanism in the urethra rings. Cystometry and histomorphometry were also performed in the urinary bladder.SS mice present a reduced urine output and incapacity to produce typical bladder contractions and bladder emptying (ex vivo), compared to control animals. In DSM, relaxation in response to a selective β3-adrenergic agonist (mirabegron) and to a non-selective β-adrenergic (isoproterenol) agonist were lower in SS mice. Additionally, carbachol, α, β-methylene ATP, KCl, extracellular Ca2+ and electrical-field stimulation promoted smaller bladder contractions in SS group. Urethra contraction induced by phenylephrine was markedly reduced in SS mice. Histological analyses of SS mice bladder revealed severe structural abnormalities, such as reductions in detrusor thickness and bladder volume, and cell infiltration.Taken together, our data demonstrate, for the first time, that SS mice display features of urinary bladder dysfunction, leading to impairment in urinary continence, which may have an important role in the pathogenesis of the enuresis and infections observed the SCD patients."
https://openalex.org/W1841479913,"N-Methylpurines (NMPs), including N7-methylguanine (7MeG) and N3-methyladenine (3MeA), can be induced by environmental methylating agents, chemotherapeutics, and natural cellular methyl donors. In human cells, NMPs are repaired by the multi-step base excision repair pathway initiated by human alkyladenine glycosylase. Repair of NMPs has been shown to be affected by DNA sequence contexts. However, the nature of the sequence contexts has been poorly understood. We developed a sensitive method, LAF-Seq (Lesion-Adjoining Fragment Sequencing), which allows nucleotide-resolution digital mapping of DNA damage and repair in multiple genomic fragments of interest in human cells. We also developed a strategy that allows accurate measurement of the excision kinetics of NMP bases in vitro. We demonstrate that 3MeAs are induced to a much lower level by the SN2 methylating agent dimethyl sulfate and repaired much faster than 7MeGs in human fibroblasts. Induction of 7MeGs by dimethyl sulfate is affected by nearest-neighbor nucleotides, being enhanced at sites neighbored by a G or T on the 3′ side, but impaired at sites neighbored by a G on the 5′ side. Repair of 7MeGs is also affected by nearest-neighbor nucleotides, being slow if the lesions are between purines, especially Gs, and fast if the lesions are between pyrimidines, especially Ts. Excision of 7MeG bases from the DNA backbone by human alkyladenine glycosylase in vitro is similarly affected by nearest-neighbor nucleotides, suggesting that the effect of nearest-neighbor nucleotides on repair of 7MeGs in the cells is primarily achieved by modulating the initial step of the base excision repair process.

Alkylation damage to DNA can be caused by environmental or chemotherapeutic alkylating agents, or by natural cellular methyl donors such as S-adenosylmethionine (1Fu D. Calvo J.A. Samson L.D. Balancing repair and tolerance of DNA damage caused by alkylating agents.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2012; 12: 104-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar).

Methylating agents and DNA repair responses: methylated bases and sources of strand breaks.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2006; 19: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). NMPs are repaired by the multi-step base excision repair (BER) pathway. In human cells, the BER process is initiated by human alkyladenine glycosylase (hAAG), which recognizes and excises the methylated purine bases (1Fu D. Calvo J.A. Samson L.D. Balancing repair and tolerance of DNA damage caused by alkylating agents.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2012; 12: 104-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites formed are typically recognized by an AP endonuclease that cleaves the DNA on the 5′ side of the AP sites. The repair process concludes following DNA repair synthesis and ligation. BER of NMPs plays an important role in protecting the genome, and at the same time confounds cancer alkylation therapies, by excising the cytotoxic lesions. dimethyl sulfate N-methylpurine N3-methyladenine N7-methylguanine human alkyladenine glycosylase base excision repair nucleotide excision repair apurinic/apyrimidinic site lesion-adjoining fragment sequencing excision repair sequencing reverse complement of adapter A O-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)hydroxylamine AP endonuclease 1 8-oxoguanine glycosylase fluorescein 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine. The efficiency of BER can be affected by local DNA sequences (3Donigan K.A. Sweasy J.B. Sequence context-specific mutagenesis and base excision repair.Mol. Carcinog. 2009; 48: 362-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The different efficiencies may have implications for genome stability as lesions that persist longer in DNA have a greater chance of leading to mutagenesis. It was demonstrated that the rates of NMP repair in the PGK1 gene of human cells are highly heterogeneous and can be affected by some DNA sequence contexts (4Ye N. Holmquist G.P. O'Connor T.R. Heterogeneous repair of N-methylpurines at the nucleotide level in normal human cells.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 269-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, until now, the exact nature of the sequence contexts that affect the repair of NMPs in human cells has been poorly understood. Also, the excision kinetics of NMP bases have been difficult to measure in vitro because the methylated bases are labile to spontaneous depurination and the AP sites formed after excision of the methylated bases are labile to spontaneous strand cleavage. This difficulty has made it impossible to unambiguously address the question as to whether the heterogeneity of NMP repair is caused by the excision of the methylated bases or by a later step of the BER process. Multiple methods have been developed to map the formation and repair of DNA adducts in living cells (5Henderson D.S. DNA Repair Protocols: Mammalian Systems. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2005Google Scholar, 6Vaughan P. DNA Repair Protocols: Prokaryotic Systems. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000Crossref Google Scholar). Broadly speaking, these methods can be grouped into the genome overall level, gene/DNA fragment level, and nucleotide level. The nucleotide-level methods can be powerful for delineating the modulation of DNA adduct formation and repair by various cellular elements, such as DNA sequence context, chromatin structure, epigenetic modifications, and certain cellular processes (e.g. transcription) (7Li S. Waters R. Smerdon M.J. Low- and high-resolution mapping of DNA damage at specific sites.Methods. 2000; 22: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, most of the nucleotide-level methods are only sensitive enough for mapping DNA adduct formation and repair in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes (i.e. organisms with small genomes) or in multi-copy sequences (e.g. those in mitochondria) of mammalian cells. Indeed, until very recently, ligation-mediated PCR had been the only method that allowed nucleotide-level mapping of DNA lesions in single-copy sequences in mammalian cells (8Besaratinia A. Pfeifer G.P. Measuring the formation and repair of UV damage at the DNA sequence level by ligation-mediated PCR.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 920: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the ligation-mediated PCR technique is unsuitable for large scale analyses of DNA damage and repair in the cell. Also, the gel bands corresponding to DNA lesions cannot always be well separated, and the lesions cannot be precisely counted. Very recently, a high-throughput method, called XR-Seq (excision repair sequencing), which allows mapping of nucleotide excision repair (NER) of UV photoproducts (cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproduct) in human cells, was developed (9Hu J. Adar S. Selby C.P. Lieb J.D. Sancar A. Genome-wide analysis of human global and transcription-coupled excision repair of UV damage at single-nucleotide resolution.Gene Dev. 2015; 29: 948-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This method can provide a snapshot measurement of UV photoproduct-containing oligonucleotides (∼30 nucleotides) that are excised during NER. As it relies on immunoprecipitation of the excised oligonucleotides that transiently exist in the cell, the XR-Seq method is not suitable for accurately measuring the kinetics of NER. Also, the XR-Seq method cannot be used for mapping the formation and repair of DNA lesions that are not NER substrates. Here, we report the development of a sensitive method, LAF-Seq (Lesion-Adjoining Fragment Sequencing), which allows nucleotide-resolution digital mapping of DNA damage and repair in multiple genomic fragments of interest in human cells. This method is suitable for mapping any type of DNA lesions, provided that they can be converted into DNA single or double strand breaks after isolation of total genomic DNA. We also developed a strategy that allows accurate measurement of the excision kinetics of NMP bases in vitro. We demonstrate that 3MeAs are induced to a much lower level by DMS and repaired much faster than 7MeGs in human fibroblasts. Induction of 7MeGs is affected by nearest-neighbor nucleotides, being enhanced at sites neighbored by a G or T on the 3′ side, but impaired at sites neighbored by a G on the 5′ side. Repair of 7MeGs is also affected by nearest-neighbor nucleotides, being slow if the lesions are between purines, especially Gs, and fast if the lesions are between pyrimidines, especially Ts. Furthermore, we show that the excision of 7MeG bases by hAAG in vitro is similarly affected by nearest-neighbor nucleotides, suggesting that the effect of nearest-neighbor nucleotides on repair of 7MeGs in human cells is primarily achieved by modulating the initial step of the BER process, namely the excision of 7MeG bases by hAAG.

A fraction of the cultured cells was saved as control, and the rest were treated with 0.005% (v/v) DMS for 10 min. This treatment induced ∼1 NMP/10 kb of genomic DNA and caused no obvious cell killing. The cells were washed twice with PBS containing 0.005% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, washed twice with PBS, and then replenished with fresh medium and incubated at 37 °C. At 0, 6, 12, and 24 h of the incubation, an aliquot of the cells was harvested. Each aliquot (10 million cells) was resuspended in 2 ml of nuclei isolation buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.9) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, 10 μg/ml proteinase K, pH 8.0), and incubated at 65 °C for 12 h. In addition to releasing DNA, this 12-h incubation at 65 °C caused complete depurination of NMP bases from the DNA backbone. The AP sites formed might be further cleaved by spontaneous β elimination or β and δ eliminations, leaving an unsaturated sugar or a phosphate at the 3′ ends of the cleaved sites. Each of the samples was mixed with 5 ml of 5 m NaCl and incubated on ice overnight. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. The genomic DNA was precipitated with isopropanol. Six μg of genomic DNA of each sample (DMS-treated and untreated) were digested with 12 units of MseI and 3 units of endonuclease IV (New England Biolabs) in 100 μl of NEBuffer 3 (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, pH 7.9) overnight. MseI digestion releases the three fragments encompassing exons 11 (281 bp) and 15 (264 bp) of the BRAF gene and the coding exon 1 (228 bp) of the NRAS gene. In addition to incising the DNA on the 5′ side of the AP sites formed after spontaneous depurination of NMPs, endonuclease IV also removes unsaturated sugar or phosphate groups from the 3′ ends of the DNA (11Demple B. Johnson A. Fung D. Exonuclease III and endonuclease IV remove 3′ blocks from DNA synthesis primers in H2O2-damaged Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 7731-7735Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Each of the samples was added with NaCl to a final concentration of 1 m and a mixture (0.5 pmol each) of biotinylated oligonucleotides (see Table 1). The samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and then incubated at 50 °C for 30 min. Ten μl of streptavidin magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin, Life Technologies) were added to each of the samples and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The beads were washed with STES (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, pH 7.5) at room temperature and with STE (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) at 55 °C. To estimate the efficiencies of fishing out the fragments of interest, a small fraction of the beads was resuspended in 25% ammonium hydroxide. The eluted fragments of interest (contained in the supernatants) were vacuum-dried and quantified by real-time PCR (using SYBR Select Master Mix from Life Technologies).TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used for construction and sequencing of libraries of DNA fragments of interestNameSequences (5′ → 3′)Used forAdapter P1CCTCTCTATGGGCAGTCGGTGATPCR amplification and sequencing of fragment librariesAdapter ACCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCPCR amplification and sequencing of fragment librariesRC-A1Phosphate-ATCGTTACCTTAGCTGAGTCGGAGACACGCAGGGATGAGATGG-inverted TReverse complement of Adapter A with barcode 1RC-A2Phosphate-ATCGTTCTCCTTACTGAGTCGGAGACACGCAGGGATGAGATGG-inverted TReverse complement of Adapter A with barcode 2RC-A3Phosphate-ATCGAATCCTCTTCTGAGTCGGAGACACGCAGGGATGAGATGG-inverted TReverse complement of Adapter A with barcode 3RC-A4Phosphate-ATCGATCTTGGTACTGAGTCGGAGACACGCAGGGATGAGATGG-inverted TReverse complement of Adapter A with barcode 4RC-A5Phosphate-ATCGTTCCTTCTGCTGAGTCGGAGACACGCAGGGATGAGATGG-inverted TReverse complement of Adapter A with barcode 5BRAF11-1AGGGATACAGGAAGAGATCCCCTTAATCACCGACTGCCCATAGAGAGG-biotinFishing out the NTS of BRAF exon 11; assisting ligation of adapter P1BRAF11-2GTGACATTGTGACAAGTCATAATAGGATATGTTTAATCACCGACTGCCCATAGAGAGG-biotinFishing out the TS of BRAF exon 11; assisting ligation of adapter P1BRAF15-1GAGTTTAGGTAAGAGATCTAATTTCTATAATTCTGTAATATAATATTCTTTAATCACCGACTGCCCATAGAGAGG-biotinFishing out the NTS of BRAF exon 15; assisting ligation of adapter P1BRAF15-2GGTAAGAATTGAGGCTATTTTTCCACTGATTAATCACCGACTGCCCATAGAGAGG-biotinFishing out the TS of BRAF exon 15; assisting ligation of adapter P1NRAS1-1CTGTTGGAAACCAGTAATCAGGGTTAATCACCGACTGCCCATAGAGAGG-biotinFishing out NTS of NRAS coding exon 1; assisting ligation of adapter P1NRAS1-2TGTCGGATCATCTTTACCCATATTCTGTATTAATCACCGACTGCCCATAGAGAGG-biotinFishing out the TS of NRAS coding exon 1; assisting ligation of adapter P1 Open table in a new tab To ligate adapter RC-Ai (see Table 1) to the 3′ ends of the fragments of interest, the beads were resuspended in 10 μl of CircLigase buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 20% PEG 8000, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 m betaine, 20 μm ATP, 2.5 mm MnCl2, 200 μg/ml BSA, 1 mm DTT), which we have extensively optimized to allow efficient ligation of single-stranded DNA molecules by CircLigase (Epicentre) (12Blondal T.

Two hundred pmol of RC-Ai and 10 units of CircLigase were added to each of the samples and incubated at 55 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed with STES at room temperature, binding and washing buffer with SDS (10 mm Tris, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, pH 8.0) at 55 °C, and Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) at room temperature. The RC-Ai-ligated fragments were eluted from the beads by using 25% ammonium hydroxide and vacuum-dried. To ligate adapter P1 to the 5′ ends of the fragments of interest, the DNA samples were dissolved in 50 μl of T7 DNA ligation buffer (66 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 7.5% PEG 6000, pH 7.6) containing a mixture (0.25 pmol each) of the biotinylated oligonucleotides and 20 pmol of adapter P1 (see Table 1). The samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and at 50 °C for 30 min and then cooled to room temperature. The samples were added with 3 units of T7 DNA ligase (Molecular Cloning Laboratories) and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Each of the samples was added with 50 μl of 2×binding and washing buffer (20 mm Tris, 2 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and 10 μl of streptavidin magnetic beads and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The beads were washed with STES, Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 8.0), and H2O at room temperature. The adapter-ligated fragments were eluted from the beads by using 25% ammonium hydroxide and vacuum-dried. The efficiencies of adapters RC-Ai and P1 ligations were estimated by real-time PCR using a small fraction of the eluted fragments as templates. The libraries of DNA fragments were amplified by 10–14 cycles of PCR, using Herculase II fusion DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies) and adapters A and P1 (see Table 1) as primers. The qualities and quantities of the libraries were analyzed by using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent). The barcoded libraries were then pooled, and the sequencing templates were prepared on Ion Sphere particles by using the Ion OneTouch 2 system. The templates were loaded onto Ion 318 chips and sequenced from the RC-Ai-ligated ends (by “reading” the complementary strand in the 5′ to 3′ direction) on an Ion Torrent personal genome machine. The sequencing reads were sorted according to their barcodes by using the Torrent Suite software. After being trimmed of barcode sequences, the reads were aligned to the sequences of the fragments of interest by using Bowtie 2 in Galaxy (The Galaxy Project). As the NMPs were induced to a relatively low level (∼1 NMP/10 kb of DNA), the majority (≥97%) of the reads correspond to the complementary strands of the full-length (undamaged) fragments of interest. A small fraction of the reads (≤3%) corresponds to the complementary strands of the fragments of interest adjoining the NMP sites. The total numbers of reads from the DMS-treated samples were normalized to those from the control (not treated with DMS) samples. The 5′ ends of the reads that align to the internal sites of the fragments of interest would correspond to the NMPs induced or remaining (at different times of repair) at sites on the complementary strands. The reads whose 5′ ends align to the same sites of the fragments of interest were counted. To remove background signals, the read counts aligned to different sites of the fragments of interest from the DMS-treated samples were deducted by the corresponding counts from the control samples. Only those sites with >10 counts of lesions at 0 h of repair were analyzed for NMP repair. Eighty pmol of each of the substrates (see Fig. 9A) was treated with 0.6% (v/v) DMS in a total volume of 100 μl of Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) at room temperature for 15 min, which induced ∼0.05 7MeG per fluorescein (FAM)-labeled fragment of the substrates. The DMS-treated substrates were purified and dissolved in 80 μl of ThermoPol buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 100 μg/ml BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 8.8, at 25 °C). Two pmol of purified hAAG (New England Biolabs) was added to each of the samples and incubated at 37 °C. At different times of the incubation, an aliquot of 10 μl (10 pmol of DNA) was taken, and the DNA was purified. Each of the aliquots was then treated with 100 mm O-(tetrahydro-2H-pyr an-2-yl)hydroxylamine (OTX) (Sigma) in a total volume of 25 μl of STE at 37° C for 1 h. Each of the aliquots (10 pmol of DNA) was then treated with 1.2 pmol of hAAG and an excess amount of AP endonuclease 1 (APE1) (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 3 h to excise all the remaining NMPs and completely cleave the DNA at the resulting unprotected AP sites. To analyze the samples on a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems), 0.1 pmol of each of the samples was loaded into an 80-cm capillary column filled with POP-6 polymer. The FSA binary files generated were converted to text files by using BatchExtract (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/forensics/BATCHEXTRACT). The fluorescent signals were then analyzed by using Microsoft Excel. We reasoned that DNA lesions at specific sites of the genome could be digitally mapped if single-stranded DNA fragments adjoining the lesions could be fished out, sequenced, and counted. Exons 11 and 15 of the BRAF gene and the coding exon 1 of the NRAS gene contain frequent mutations in cutaneous melanoma and other human cancers (13Hocker T. Tsao H. Ultraviolet radiation and melanoma: a systematic review and analysis of reported sequence variants.Hum. Mutat. 2007; 28: 578-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We chose to develop the method by mapping NMP induction and repair in both strands of genomic DNA fragments encompassing these exons. Human fibroblasts were treated with DMS to induce a low level of NMPs in the genomic DNA (∼1 NMP/10 kb of DNA). Following different times of repair incubation, aliquots were taken and total genomic DNA was isolated. DNA samples from the DMS-treated cells at different times of repair and from the untreated cells was separately cut with a restriction enzyme to release the fragments of interest and cleaved at the NMP sites (Fig. 1). The fragments of interest were simultaneously fished out from each of the samples by using excess copies of a mixture of biotinylated oligonucleotides that are complementary to the 5′ end region of the fragments of interest (Table 1). The efficiency of fishing out the genomic fragments of interest from the total genomic DNA was around 70% (Fig. 2). To allow sequencing by the Ion Torrent personal genome machine, adapter RC-Ai (reverse complement of adapter Ai, “i” stands for a barcode number) and adapter P1 were ligated to the 3′ and 5′ ends of the fragments of interest, respectively. Each of the samples was ligated with specifically barcoded RC-Ai. Under our optimized conditions, over 90% of the fished-out fragments of interest were ligated to adapters RC-Ai and P1 (Fig. 3). The adapter-ligated fragments with different barcodes were pooled and sequenced simultaneously from the adapter RC-Ai ligated ends (by reading the complementary strand in the 5′ to 3′ direction) on Ion Torrent 318 chips, which typically generate 5–6 million high quality sequencing reads each run (Fig. 4). Most of the sequencing reads can be aligned to the reference sequences of the fragments of interest (94 and 99% for the two sequencing runs, respectively). The low read counts aligned to specific sites of the fragments of interest from the control (untreated with DMS) samples reflect background signals, which were deducted from the corresponding sites from the DMS-treated samples. NMPs induced (at 0 h of repair) or remaining (at different times of repair) at specific sites of the fragments of interest were then counted by tallying the sequencing reads whose ends align to the respective damaged sites.FIGURE 2Estimation of efficiencies of fishing out the fragment of interest.

As can be seen, most (∼90%) of the NMPs induced by DMS were 7MeGs, and a small fraction (∼10%) was 3MeAs. For five out of six strands of the three fragments analyzed, NMPs that can be detected are located in sites that are ≥2–9 nucleotides from the regions that are complementary to the biotinylated oligonucleotides used to fish out the fragments (Fig. 1). This is consistent with the fact that the CircLigase we used to ligate adapter RC-Ai to the 3′ end of the fragments of interest can only ligate single-stranded but not double-stranded DNA (12Blondal T.

However, we detected 7MeGs at a site of the region that is complementary to BRAF11-2 (Table 1). This site is complementary to the 5th nucleotide (from the 5′ end) of BRAF11-2 and is located in the transcribed strand of the fragment encompassing exon 11 of the BRAF gene (Fig. 5, see the “g” site that is the second nucleotide from the 5′ end of the transcribed strand). Presumably, the fragment adjoining 7MeG at this site was ligated to adapter RC-Ai due to “breathing” of double-stranded DNA. The “breathing” at 55 °C (the temperature we used for ligation of RC-Ai) might be frequent but did not cause detachment of the fragment from the biotinylated BRAF11-2.FIGURE 6Lesion counts in the genomic DNA fragment encompassing exon 15 of the BRAF gene in human fibroblasts.

https://openalex.org/W2123294151,"Plasma soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) is mainly generated by cleavage of CD40L from the surface of activated platelets, and therefore considered a platelet activation marker. Although the predictive value of sCD40L for ischemic events has been demonstrated in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), studies on the association of sCD40L with cardiovascular outcomes in lower risk populations yielded heterogeneous results. We therefore sought to investigate factors influencing sCD40L levels, and the predictive value of sCD40L for long-term ischemic events in unselected, aspirin-treated patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. sCD40L was determined by a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 682 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. Two-year follow-up data were obtained from 562 patients. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel was associated with significantly lower levels of sCD40L and lower platelet surface expressions of P-selectin and activated GPIIb/IIIa compared to aspirin monotherapy (all p≤0.01). Hypertension was linked to lower plasma concentrations of sCD40L, whereas female sex, increasing high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and hematocrit were associated with higher sCD40L concentrations (all p<0.05). sCD40L levels were similar in patients without and with the primary endpoint in the overall study population (p = 0.4). Likewise, sCD40L levels did not differ significantly between patients without and with the secondary endpoints (both p≥0.4). Similar results were obtained when only patients with angiographically-proven coronary artery disease (n = 459), stent implantation (n = 205) or ACS (n = 125) were analyzed. The adjustment for differences in patient characteristics by multivariate regression analyses did not change the results. ROC curve analyses did not reveal cut-off values for sCD40L for the prediction of the primary or secondary endpoints. In conclusion, plasma sCD40L levels are reduced by antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel, but not associated with long-term ischemic outcomes in unselected consecutive aspirin-treated patients undergoing cardiac catheterization."
https://openalex.org/W2196279741,"MicroRNAs play important regulatory roles in eukaryotic lineages. In this paper, we employed deep sequencing technology to sequence and identify microRNAs in M. incognita genome, which is one of the important plant parasitic nematodes. We identified 102 M. incognita microRNA genes, which can be grouped into 71 nonredundant miRNAs based on mature sequences. Among the 71 miRANs, 27 are known miRNAs and 44 are novel miRNAs. We identified seven miRNA clusters in M. incognita genome. Four of the seven clusters, miR-100/let-7, miR-71-1/miR-2a-1, miR-71-2/miR-2a-2 and miR-279/miR-2b are conserved in other species. We validated the expressions of 5 M. incognita microRNAs, including 3 known microRNAs (miR-71, miR-100b and let-7) and 2 novel microRNAs (NOVEL-1 and NOVEL-2), using RT-PCR. We can detect all 5 microRNAs. The expression levels of four microRNAs obtained using RT-PCR were consistent with those obtained by high-throughput sequencing except for those of let-7. We also examined how M. incognita miRNAs are conserved in four other nematodes species: C. elegans, A. suum, B. malayi and P. pacificus. We found that four microRNAs, miR-100, miR-92, miR-279 and miR-137, exist only in genomes of parasitic nematodes, but do not exist in the genomes of the free living nematode C. elegans. Our research created a unique resource for the research of plant parasitic nematodes. The candidate microRNAs could help elucidate the genomic structure, gene regulation, evolutionary processes, and developmental features of plant parasitic nematodes and nematode-plant interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1945105777,"Peripheral artery disease (PAD) and low heart rate variability (HRV) are highly prevalent in hemodialysis patients, and both are associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This study aims to examine the suggested relationship between PAD and HRV, and the relationship of parameters before and after hemodialysis. This study enrolled 161 maintenance hemodialysis patients. PAD was defined as ABI < 0.9 in either leg. HRV was performed to assess changes before and after hemodialysis. The change in HRV (△HRV) was defined as post-hemodialysis HRV minus pre-hemodialysis HRV. Patients’ clinical parameters were collected from the dialysis records. All HRV parameters except high frequency (HF) % were lower in patients with PAD than patients without PAD, though not achieving significant level. In patients without PAD, HF (P = 0.013), low frequency (LF) % (P = 0.028) and LF/HF (P = 0.034) were significantly elevated after hemodialysis, whereas no significant HRV parameters change was noted in patients with PAD. Serum intact parathyroid hormone was independently associated with △HF (β = -0.970, P = 0.032) and △LF% (β = -12.609, P = 0.049). Uric acid level (β = -0.154, P = 0.027) was negatively associated with △LF/HF in patients without PAD. Our results demonstrated that some of the HRV parameters were significantly increased after hemodialysis in patients without PAD, but not in patients with PAD, reflecting a state of impaired sympatho-vagal equilibrium. Severity of secondary hyperparathyroidism and hyperuricemia contributed to lesser HRV parameters increase after hemodialysis in patients without PAD."
https://openalex.org/W1899561378,"In order to facilitate foodborne outbreak investigations there is a need to improve the methods for identifying the food products that should be sampled for laboratory analysis. The aim of this study was to examine the applicability of a likelihood ratio approach previously developed on simulated data, to real outbreak data. We used human case and food product distribution data from the Norwegian enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli outbreak in 2006. The approach was adjusted to include time, space smoothing and to handle missing or misclassified information. The performance of the adjusted likelihood ratio approach on the data originating from the HUS outbreak and control data indicates that the adjusted approach is promising and indicates that the adjusted approach could be a useful tool to assist and facilitate the investigation of food borne outbreaks in the future if good traceability are available and implemented in the distribution chain. However, the approach needs to be further validated on other outbreak data and also including other food products than meat products in order to make a more general conclusion of the applicability of the developed approach."
https://openalex.org/W1884712166,"Synaptic transmission is highly plastic and subject to regulation by a wide variety of neuromodulators and neuropeptides. In the present study, we have examined the role of isoforms of the cytochrome b561 homologue called no extended memory (nemy) in regulation of synaptic strength and plasticity at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of third instar larvae in Drosophila. Specifically, we generated two independent excisions of nemy that differentially affect the expression of nemy isoforms. We show that the nemy45 excision, which specifically reduces the expression of the longest splice form of nemy, leads to an increase in stimulus evoked transmitter release and altered synaptic plasticity at the NMJ. Conversely, the nemy26.2 excision, which appears to reduce the expression of all splice forms except the longest splice isoform, shows a reduction in stimulus evoked transmitter release, and enhanced synaptic plasticity. We further show that nemy45 mutants have reduced levels of amidated peptides similar to that observed in peptidyl-glycine hydryoxylating mono-oxygenase (PHM) mutants. In contrast, nemy26.2 mutants show no defects in peptide amidation but rather display a decrease in Tyramine β hydroxylase activity (TβH). Taken together, these results show non-redundant roles for the different nemy isoforms and shed light on the complex regulation of neuromodulators."
https://openalex.org/W1945713012,"Dynamic subcellular distributions of signaling system components are critical regulators of cellular signal transduction through their control of molecular interactions. Understanding how signaling activity depends on such distributions and the cellular structures driving them is required for comprehensive insight into signal transduction. In the activation of primary murine T cells by antigen presenting cells (APC) signaling intermediates associate with various subcellular structures, prominently a transient, wide, and actin-associated lamellum extending from an interdigitated T cell:APC interface several micrometers into the T cell. While actin dynamics are well established as general regulators of cellular organization, their role in controlling signaling organization in primary T cell:APC couples and the specific cellular structures driving it is unresolved. Using modest interference with actin dynamics with a low concentration of Jasplakinolide as corroborated by costimulation blockade we show that T cell actin preferentially controls lamellal signaling localization and activity leading downstream to calcium signaling. Lamellal localization repeatedly related to efficient T cell function. This suggests that the transient lamellal actin matrix regulates T cell signaling associations that facilitate T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W2309121503,"The glycosylation of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) plays an important role in reproductive tumors. Detecting hCG N-glycosylation alteration may significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity of related cancers. However, developing an immunoassay directly against the N-linked oligosaccharides is unlikely because of the heterogeneity and low immunogenicity of carbohydrates. Here, we report a hydrogen/deuterium exchange and MS approach to investigate the effect of N-glycosylation on the binding of antibodies against different hCG glycoforms. Hyperglycosylated hCG was purified from the urine of invasive mole patients, and the structure of its N-linked oligosaccharides was confirmed to be more branched by MS. The binding kinetics of the anti-hCG antibodies MCA329 and MCA1024 against hCG and hyperglycosylated hCG were compared using biolayer interferometry. The binding affinity of MCA1024 changed significantly in response to the alteration of hCG N-linked oligosaccharides. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange-MS reveals that the peptide β65–83 of the hCG β subunit is the epitope for MCA1024. Site-specific N-glycosylation analysis suggests that N-linked oligosaccharides at Asn-13 and Asn-30 on the β subunit affect the binding affinity of MCA1024. These results prove that some antibodies are sensitive to the structural change of N-linked oligosaccharides, whereas others are not affected by N-glycosylation.
