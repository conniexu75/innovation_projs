https://openalex.org/W3113331104,"Abstract Most deaths from cancer are explained by metastasis, and yet large-scale metastasis research has been impractical owing to the complexity of in vivo models. Here we introduce an in vivo barcoding strategy that is capable of determining the metastatic potential of human cancer cell lines in mouse xenografts at scale. We validated the robustness, scalability and reproducibility of the method and applied it to 500 cell lines 1,2 spanning 21 types of solid tumour. We created a first-generation metastasis map (MetMap) that reveals organ-specific patterns of metastasis, enabling these patterns to be associated with clinical and genomic features. We demonstrate the utility of MetMap by investigating the molecular basis of breast cancers capable of metastasizing to the brain—a principal cause of death in patients with this type of cancer. Breast cancers capable of metastasizing to the brain showed evidence of altered lipid metabolism. Perturbation of lipid metabolism in these cells curbed brain metastasis development, suggesting a therapeutic strategy to combat the disease and demonstrating the utility of MetMap as a resource to support metastasis research."
https://openalex.org/W3112535936,"The psychedelic alkaloid ibogaine has anti-addictive properties in both humans and animals1. Unlike most medications for the treatment of substance use disorders, anecdotal reports suggest that ibogaine has the potential to treat addiction to various substances, including opiates, alcohol and psychostimulants. The effects of ibogaine-like those of other psychedelic compounds-are long-lasting2, which has been attributed to its ability to modify addiction-related neural circuitry through the activation of neurotrophic factor signalling3,4. However, several safety concerns have hindered the clinical development of ibogaine, including its toxicity, hallucinogenic potential and tendency to induce cardiac arrhythmias. Here we apply the principles of function-oriented synthesis to identify the key structural elements of the potential therapeutic pharmacophore of ibogaine, and we use this information to engineer tabernanthalog-a water-soluble, non-hallucinogenic, non-toxic analogue of ibogaine that can be prepared in a single step. In rodents, tabernanthalog was found to promote structural neural plasticity, reduce alcohol- and heroin-seeking behaviour, and produce antidepressant-like effects. This work demonstrates that, through careful chemical design, it is possible to modify a psychedelic compound to produce a safer, non-hallucinogenic variant that has therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W3110786706,"Linker histone H1 proteins bind to nucleosomes and facilitate chromatin compaction1, although their biological functions are poorly understood. Mutations in the genes that encode H1 isoforms B-E (H1B, H1C, H1D and H1E; also known as H1-5, H1-2, H1-3 and H1-4, respectively) are highly recurrent in B cell lymphomas, but the pathogenic relevance of these mutations to cancer and the mechanisms that are involved are unknown. Here we show that lymphoma-associated H1 alleles are genetic driver mutations in lymphomas. Disruption of H1 function results in a profound architectural remodelling of the genome, which is characterized by large-scale yet focal shifts of chromatin from a compacted to a relaxed state. This decompaction drives distinct changes in epigenetic states, primarily owing to a gain of histone H3 dimethylation at lysine 36 (H3K36me2) and/or loss of repressive H3 trimethylation at lysine 27 (H3K27me3). These changes unlock the expression of stem cell genes that are normally silenced during early development. In mice, loss of H1c and H1e (also known as H1f2 and H1f4, respectively) conferred germinal centre B cells with enhanced fitness and self-renewal properties, ultimately leading to aggressive lymphomas with an increased repopulating potential. Collectively, our data indicate that H1 proteins are normally required to sequester early developmental genes into architecturally inaccessible genomic compartments. We also establish H1 as a bona fide tumour suppressor and show that mutations in H1 drive malignant transformation primarily through three-dimensional genome reorganization, which leads to epigenetic reprogramming and derepression of developmentally silenced genes."
https://openalex.org/W3110789092,"Capillary condensation of water is ubiquitous in nature and technology. It routinely occurs in granular and porous media, can strongly alter such properties as adhesion, lubrication, friction and corrosion, and is important in many processes employed by microelectronics, pharmaceutical, food and other industries. The century-old Kelvin equation is commonly used to describe condensation phenomena and shown to hold well for liquid menisci with diameters as small as several nm. For even smaller capillaries that are involved in condensation under ambient humidity and, hence, of particular practical interest, the Kelvin equation is expected to break down, because the required confinement becomes comparable to the size of water molecules. Here we take advantage of van der Waals assembly of two-dimensional crystals to create atomic-scale capillaries and study condensation inside. Our smallest capillaries are less than 4 angstroms in height and can accommodate just a monolayer of water. Surprisingly, even at this scale, the macroscopic Kelvin equation using the characteristics of bulk water is found to describe accurately the condensation transition in strongly hydrophilic (mica) capillaries and remains qualitatively valid for weakly hydrophilic (graphene) ones. We show that this agreement is somewhat fortuitous and can be attributed to elastic deformation of capillary walls, which suppresses giant oscillatory behavior expected due to commensurability between atomic-scale confinement and water molecules. Our work provides a much-needed basis for understanding of capillary effects at the smallest possible scale important in many realistic situations."
https://openalex.org/W3112917853,"The halo of the Milky Way provides a laboratory to study the properties of the shocked hot gas that is predicted by models of galaxy formation. There is observational evidence of energy injection into the halo from past activity in the nucleus of the Milky Way; however, the origin of this energy (star formation or supermassive-black-hole activity) is uncertain, and the causal connection between nuclear structures and large-scale features has not been established unequivocally. Here we report soft-X-ray-emitting bubbles that extend approximately 14 kiloparsecs above and below the Galactic centre and include a structure in the southern sky analogous to the North Polar Spur. The sharp boundaries of these bubbles trace collisionless and non-radiative shocks, and corroborate the idea that the bubbles are not a remnant of a local supernova but part of a vast Galaxy-scale structure closely related to features seen in gamma-rays. Large energy injections from the Galactic centre are the most likely cause of both the {\gamma}-ray and X-ray bubbles. The latter have an estimated energy of around 10$^{56}$ erg, which is sufficient to perturb the structure, energy content and chemical enrichment of the circumgalactic medium of the Milky Way."
https://openalex.org/W3112627880,"Recent studies have suggested that lymphatics help to restore heart function after cardiac injury1-6. Here we report that lymphatics promote cardiac growth, repair and cardioprotection in mice. We show that a lymphoangiocrine signal produced by lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) controls the proliferation and survival of cardiomyocytes during heart development, improves neonatal cardiac regeneration and is cardioprotective after myocardial infarction. Embryos that lack LECs develop smaller hearts as a consequence of reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation and increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Culturing primary mouse cardiomyocytes in LEC-conditioned medium increases cardiomyocyte proliferation and survival, which indicates that LECs produce lymphoangiocrine signals that control cardiomyocyte homeostasis. Characterization of the LEC secretome identified the extracellular protein reelin (RELN) as a key component of this process. Moreover, we report that LEC-specific Reln-null mouse embryos develop smaller hearts, that RELN is required for efficient heart repair and function after neonatal myocardial infarction, and that cardiac delivery of RELN using collagen patches improves heart function in adult mice after myocardial infarction by a cardioprotective effect. These results highlight a lymphoangiocrine role of LECs during cardiac development and injury response, and identify RELN as an important mediator of this function."
https://openalex.org/W3113079251,"H1 linker histones are the most abundant chromatin-binding proteins1. In vitro studies indicate that their association with chromatin determines nucleosome spacing and enables arrays of nucleosomes to fold into more compact chromatin structures. However, the in vivo roles of H1 are poorly understood2. Here we show that the local density of H1 controls the balance of repressive and active chromatin domains by promoting genomic compaction. We generated a conditional triple-H1-knockout mouse strain and depleted H1 in haematopoietic cells. H1 depletion in T cells leads to de-repression of T cell activation genes, a process that mimics normal T cell activation. Comparison of chromatin structure in normal and H1-depleted CD8+ T cells reveals that H1-mediated chromatin compaction occurs primarily in regions of the genome containing higher than average levels of H1: the chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) B compartment and regions of the Hi-C A compartment marked by PRC2. Reduction of H1 stoichiometry leads to decreased H3K27 methylation, increased H3K36 methylation, B-to-A-compartment shifting and an increase in interaction frequency between compartments. In vitro, H1 promotes PRC2-mediated H3K27 methylation and inhibits NSD2-mediated H3K36 methylation. Mechanistically, H1 mediates these opposite effects by promoting physical compaction of the chromatin substrate. Our results establish H1 as a critical regulator of gene silencing through localized control of chromatin compaction, 3D genome organization and the epigenetic landscape."

https://openalex.org/W3113049086,"The control of molecules is key to the investigation of quantum phases, in which rich degrees of freedom can be used to encode information and strong interactions can be precisely tuned1. Inelastic losses in molecular collisions2-5, however, have greatly hampered the engineering of low-entropy molecular systems6. So far, the only quantum degenerate gas of molecules has been created via association of two highly degenerate atomic gases7,8. Here we use an external electric field along with optical lattice confinement to create a two-dimensional Fermi gas of spin-polarized potassium-rubidium (KRb) polar molecules, in which elastic, tunable dipolar interactions dominate over all inelastic processes. Direct thermalization among the molecules in the trap leads to efficient dipolar evaporative cooling, yielding a rapid increase in phase-space density. At the onset of quantum degeneracy, we observe the effects of Fermi statistics on the thermodynamics of the molecular gas. These results demonstrate a general strategy for achieving quantum degeneracy in dipolar molecular gases in which strong, long-range and anisotropic dipolar interactions can drive the emergence of exotic many-body phases, such as interlayer pairing and p-wave superfluidity."
https://openalex.org/W3113077790,"The Paris Agreement calls for a cooperative response with the aim of limiting global warming to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels while reaffirming the principles of equity and common, but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities1. Although the goal is clear, the approach required to achieve it is not. Cap-and-trade policies using uniform carbon prices could produce cost-effective reductions of global carbon emissions, but tend to impose relatively high mitigation costs on developing and emerging economies. Huge international financial transfers are required to complement cap-and-trade to achieve equal sharing of effort, defined as an equal distribution of mitigation costs as a share of income2,3, and therefore the cap-and-trade policy is often perceived as infringing on national sovereignty2–7. Here we show that a strategy of international financial transfers guided by moderate deviations from uniform carbon pricing could achieve the goal without straining either the economies or sovereignty of nations. We use the integrated assessment model REMIND–MAgPIE to analyse alternative policies: financial transfers in uniform carbon pricing systems, differentiated carbon pricing in the absence of financial transfers, or a hybrid combining financial transfers and differentiated carbon prices. Under uniform carbon prices, a present value of international financial transfers of 4.4 trillion US dollars over the next 80 years to 2100 would be required to equalize effort. By contrast, achieving equal effort without financial transfers requires carbon prices in advanced countries to exceed those in developing countries by a factor of more than 100, leading to efficiency losses of 2.6 trillion US dollars. Hybrid solutions reveal a strongly nonlinear trade-off between cost efficiency and sovereignty: moderate deviations from uniform carbon prices strongly reduce financial transfers at relatively small efficiency losses and moderate financial transfers substantially reduce inefficiencies by narrowing the carbon price spread. We also identify risks and adverse consequences of carbon price differentiation due to market distortions that can undermine environmental sustainability targets8,9. Quantifying the advantages and risks of carbon price differentiation provides insight into climate and sector-specific policy mixes. An integrated assessment model analysis shows that a moderately differentiated carbon price could achieve as much climate mitigation as a uniform carbon tax, avoiding concerns regarding equity between participating countries or sovereignty."
https://openalex.org/W3111662949,"Recent developments in high-throughput reverse genetics1,2 have revolutionized our ability to map gene function and interactions3-6. The power of these approaches depends on their ability to identify functionally associated genes, which elicit similar phenotypic changes across several perturbations (chemical, environmental or genetic) when knocked out7-9. However, owing to the large number of perturbations, these approaches have been limited to growth or morphological readouts10. Here we use a high-content biochemical readout, thermal proteome profiling11, to measure the proteome-wide protein abundance and thermal stability in response to 121 genetic perturbations in Escherichia coli. We show that thermal stability, and therefore the state and interactions of essential proteins, is commonly modulated, raising the possibility of studying a protein group that is particularly inaccessible to genetics. We find that functionally associated proteins have coordinated changes in abundance and thermal stability across perturbations, owing to their co-regulation and physical interactions (with proteins, metabolites or cofactors). Finally, we provide mechanistic insights into previously determined growth phenotypes12 that go beyond the deleted gene. These data represent a rich resource for inferring protein functions and interactions."

https://openalex.org/W3112489676,"A novel bacterium, strain EPR55-1 T , was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent on the East Pacific Rise. The cells were motile rods. Growth was observed at temperatures between 50 and 60°C (optimum, 60°C), at pH values between 5.4 and 8.6 (optimum, pH 6.6) and in the presence of 2.4–3.2% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 2.4%). The isolate used molecular hydrogen as its sole electron donor, carbon dioxide as its sole carbon source, ammonium as its sole nitrogen source, and thiosulfate, sulfite (0.01 to 0.001%, w/v) or elemental sulfur as its sole sulfur source. Nitrate, nitrous oxide (33%, v/v), thiosulfate, molecular oxygen (0.1%, v/v) or elemental sulfur could serve as the sole electron acceptor to support growth. Phylogenetic analyses based on both 16S rRNA gene sequences and whole genome sequences indicated that strain EPR55-1 T belonged to the family Nitratiruptoraceae of the class “ Campylobacteria ”, but it had the distinct phylogenetic relationship with the genus Nitratiruptor . On the basis of the physiological and molecular characteristics of the isolate, the name Nitrosophilus alvini gen. nov. sp. nov. is proposed, with EPR55-1 T as the type strain (= JCM 32893 T = KCTC 15925 T ). In addition, it is shown that “ Nitratiruptor labii ” should be transferred to the genus Nitrtosophilus ; the name Nitrosophilus labii comb. nov. (JCM 34002 T = DSM 111345 T ) is proposed for this organism. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene-based and genome-based analyses showed that Cetia pacifica is phylogenetically associated with Caminibacter species. We therefore propose the reclassification of Cetia pacifica as Caminibacter pacificus comb. nov. (DSM 27783 T = JCM 19563 T ). Additionally, AAI thresholds for genus classification and the reclassification of subordinate taxa within “ Campylobacteria ” are also evaluated, based on the analyses using publicly available genomes of all the campylobacterial species."

https://openalex.org/W3112460306,"The conservation and management of subterranean biodiversity is hindered by a lack of knowledge on the true distributions for many species, e.g., the Wallacean shortfall. In recent years, several studies have demonstrated the potential of environmental DNA (eDNA) as an effective approach to detect and monitor biodiversity, including rare, threatened, and endangered taxa. However, there are few eDNA studies of groundwater fauna. Here we report the results of the development and implementation of an eDNA assay targeting a short fragment of the mitochondrial CO1 locus of a critically imperiled cave crayfish, the Sweet Home Alabama Cave Crayfish ( Cambarus speleocoopi ), known from just four cave systems in the Interior Plateau karst region of northern Alabama. We detected C . speleocoopi DNA from water samples collected at 5 of 16 sites sampled (caves and springs), including two historical sites as well as three additional and potentially new sites in Marshall County, Alabama. All three of these sites were within 2 km of historical sites. Our study is the first to detect a groundwater crustacean in the Interior Plateau karst region. Additionally, our study contributes to the growing literature that eDNA is a viable complementary tool for detection and monitoring of a fauna that is difficult to survey and study using traditional approaches."

https://openalex.org/W3112340123,"Introduction Obesity, hypertension, and diabetes are independently associated with cardiac remodeling and frequently co-cluster. The conjoint and separate influences of these conditions on cardiac remodeling have not been investigated. Materials and methods We evaluated 5,741 Framingham Study participants (mean age 50 years, 55% women) who underwent echocardiographic measurements of left ventricular (LV) mass (LVM), LV ejection fraction (LVEF), global longitudinal strain (GLS), mitral E/e’, left atrial end-systolic (peak) dimension (LASD) and emptying fraction (LAEF). We used multivariable generalized linear models to estimate the adjusted-least square means of these measures according to cross-classified categories of body mass index (BMI; normal, overweight and obese), hypertension (yes/no), and diabetes (yes/no). Results We observed statistically significant interactions of BMI category, hypertension, and diabetes with LVM, LVEF, GLS, and LAEF (p for all 3-way interactions &lt;0.01). Overweight and obesity (compared to normal BMI), hypertension, and diabetes status were individually and conjointly associated with higher LVM and worse GLS (p&lt;0.01 for all). We observed an increase of 34% for LVM and of 9% for GLS between individuals with a normal BMI and without hypertension or diabetes compared to obese individuals with hypertension and diabetes. Presence of hypertension was associated with higher LVEF, whereas people with diabetes had lower LVEF. Conclusions Obesity, hypertension, and diabetes interact synergistically to influence cardiac remodeling. These findings may explain the markedly heightened risk of heart failure and cardiovascular disease when these factors co-cluster."
https://openalex.org/W3112952475,"Rivaroxaban (RVX) was suggested to possess anti-inflammatory and vascular tone modulatory effects. The goal of this study was to investigate whether RVX impacts lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute vascular inflammatory response. Male rats were treated with 5 mg/kg RVX (oral gavage) followed by 10 mg/kg LPS i.p injection. Circulating levels of IL-6, MCP-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 were measured in plasma 6 and 24 hours after LPS injection, while isolated aorta was used for gene expression analysis, immunohistochemistry, and vascular tone evaluation. RVX pre-treatment significantly reduced LPS mediated increase after 6h and 24h for IL-6 (4.4±2.2 and 2.8±1.7 fold), MCP-1 (1.4±1.5 and 1.3±1.4 fold) VCAM-1 (1.8±2.0 and 1.7±2.1 fold). A similar trend was observed in the aorta for iNOS (5.5±3.3 and 3.3±1.9 folds reduction, P&lt;0.01 and P&lt;0.001, respectively), VCAM-1 (1.3±1.2 and 1.4±1.3 fold reduction, P&lt;0.05), and MCP-1 (3.9±2.2 and 1.9±1.6 fold reduction, P&lt;0.01). Moreover, RVX pre-treatment, improved LPS-induced PE contractile dysfunction in aortic rings (Control vs LPS, Emax reduction = 35.4 and 31.19%, P&lt;0.001; Control vs LPS+RVX, Emax reduction = 10.83 and 11.48%, P&gt;0.05, respectively), resulting in 24.5% and 19.7% change in maximal constriction in LPS and LPS+RVX respectively. These data indicate that RVX pre-treatment attenuates LPS-induced acute vascular inflammation and contractile dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3112616284,"Background Telomere length in early life predicts later length, and shortened telomere length among adults and children has been linked to increased risk of chronic disease and mortality. Maternal stress during pregnancy may impact telomere length of the newborn. Methods In a diverse cohort of 355 pregnant women receiving prenatal and delivery care services at two hospitals in San Francisco, California, we investigated the relationship between self-reported maternal psychosocial stressors during the 2 nd trimester of pregnancy and telomere length (T/S ratio) in newborn umbilical cord blood leukocytes. We examined financial strain, food insecurity, high job strain, poor neighborhood quality, low standing in one’s community, experience of stressful/traumatic life events, caregiving for a dependent family member, perceived stress, and unplanned pregnancy. We used linear regression and Targeted Minimum Loss-Based Estimation (TMLE) to evaluate the change in the T/S ratio associated with exposure to each stressor controlling for maternal age, education, parity, race/ethnicity, and delivery hospital. Results In TMLE analyses, low community standing (-0.09; 95% confidence interval [CI]-0.19 to 0.00) and perceived stress (-0.07; 95% CI -0.15 to 0.021 was marginally associated with shorter newborn telomere length, but the associations were not significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. All linear regression estimates were not statistically significant. Our results also suggest that the association between some maternal stressors and newborn telomere length varies by race/ethnicity and infant sex. Conclusions This study is the first to examine the joint effect of multiple stressors during pregnancy on newborn TL using a flexible modeling approach."
https://openalex.org/W3112958186,"HER2/neu is an immunogenic protein inducing both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are the main effector immune cells in the anti-tumor immunity. To induce an effective CTL specific response against P5+435 single peptide derived from rat HER2/neu oncogene, we used a liposome delivery vehicle. In vivo enhancement of liposome stability and intracytoplasmic delivery of peptides are the main strategies which elevate the liposome-mediated drug delivery. Liposomes containing high transition temperature phospholipids, such as DSPC, are stable with prolonged in vivo circulation and more accessibility to the immune system. Incorporation of DOPE phospholipid results in the effective delivery of peptide into the cytoplasm via the endocytotic pathway. To this end, the P5+435 peptide was linked to Maleimide-PEG2000-DSPE and coupled on the surface of nanoliposomes containing DSPC: DSPG: Cholesterol with/without DOPE. We observed that mice vaccinated with Lip-DOPE-P5+435 formulation had the highest number of IFN-γ- producing CTLs with the highest cytotoxic activity that consequently led to significantly smallest tumor size and prolonged survival rate in the TUBO mice model. In conclusion, our study indicated that the liposomal form of P5+435 peptide containing DOPE can be regarded as a promising prophylactic anti-cancer vaccine to generate potent antigen-specific immunity."
https://openalex.org/W3110884170,"Retinoic acid (RA) has been shown to improve epithelial and endothelial barrier function and development and even suppress damage inflicted by inflammation on these barriers through regulating immune cell activity. This paper thus sought to determine whether RA could improve baseline barrier function and attenuate TNF-α-induced barrier leak in the human bronchial epithelial cell culture model, 16HBE14o- (16HBE). We show for the first time that RA increases baseline barrier function of these cell layers indicated by an 89% increase in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and 22% decrease in 14 C-mannitol flux. A simultaneous, RA-induced 70% increase in claudin-4 attests to RA affecting the tight junctional (TJ) complex itself. RA was also effective in alleviating TNF-α-induced 16HBE barrier leak, attenuating 60% of the TNF-α-induced leak to 14 C-mannitol and 80% of the leak to 14 C-inulin. Interleukin-6-induced barrier leak was also reduced by RA. Treatment of 16HBE cell layers with TNF-α resulted in dramatic decrease in immunostaining for occludin and claudin-4, as well as a downward “band-shift” in occludin Western immunoblots. The presence of RA partially reversed TNF-α’s effects on these select TJ proteins. Lastly, RA completely abrogated the TNF-α-induced increase in ERK-1,2 phosphorylation without significantly decreasing the TNF-driven increase in total ERK-1,2. This study suggests RA could be effective as a prophylactic agent in minimizing airway barrier leak and as a therapeutic in preventing leak triggered by inflammatory cascades. Given the growing literature suggesting a “cytokine storm” may be related to COVID-19 morbidity, RA may be a useful adjuvant for use with anti-viral therapies."

This is a descriptive observational methodological strategy. All patients with work-related non-specific low back pain who attended to an occupational health hospital during the study period were included consecutively. Clinical variables of kinesiophobia, pain catastrophizing, fear-avoidance attitudes, disability and pain were collected; sociodemographic variables of sex, age, type of work, educational level, occupational status and duration in days of work absence were recorded.

https://openalex.org/W3111462487,"The characteristics of acquiring new sequence information under dual-task situations have been extensively studied. A concurrent task has often been found to affect performance. In real life, however, we mostly perform a secondary task when the primary task is already well acquired. The effect of a secondary task on the ability to retrieve well-established sequence representations remains elusive. The present study investigates whether accessing well-acquired probabilistic sequence knowledge is affected by a concurrent task. Participants acquired non-adjacent regularities in an implicit probabilistic sequence learning task. After a 24-hour offline period, participants were tested on the same probabilistic sequence learning task under dual-task or single-task conditions. Here, we show that although the secondary task significantly prolonged the overall reaction times in the primary (sequence learning) task, access to the previously learned probabilistic representations remained intact. Our results highlight the importance of studying the dual-task effect not only in the learning phase but also during memory access to reveal the robustness of the acquired skill."

Materials and methods Data from The Norwegian Prescription Database was used to identify all prescriptions for glaucoma medication during the period 2004 to 2018. Population figures and lifespan data were obtained from The National Bureau of Statistics. Results Of a population of 5.3 million, a total of 75733 patients using glaucoma eye drops were identified in 2018. The national prevalence was thus 1.4%, whilst in those over 70 years of age, 8.0%. When divided into counties, the prevalence varied between 1.1 and 1.9%. Overall, the prevalence was stable in the period 2004–2018. Life time prevalence was found to be 9.4% for men and 10.2% for women. National one-year incidence proportion per 10000 was 17.0 for the total population and a peak incidence of 93.8/10000 in the 80–89 year age group was identified. Conclusions Glaucoma prevalence remained stable during the period 2004–2018, while incidence decreased slightly in the elderly population."

The use of additional methodologies and data sets is recommended to establish well-supported boundaries among species of Vasconcellea . Accordingly, six chloroplast ( trnL - trnF , rpl20 - rps12 , psbA - trnH intergenic spacers, matK and rbcL genes) and nuclear (ITS) markers were used to delimit species in the genus Vasconcellea using phylogeny and four DNA-based methods. Our results demonstrated congruence among different methodologies applied in this integrative study (i.e., morphology, multilocus phylogeny, genetic distance, coalescence methods). Genetic distance (ABGD, SPN), a coalescence method (BPP), and the multilocus phylogeny supported 22 – 25 different species of Vasconcellea , including the following five new species from northern Peru: V . badilloi sp. nov., V . carvalhoae sp. nov., V . chachapoyensis sp. nov., V . pentalobis sp. nov., and V . peruviensis sp. nov. Genetic markers that gave better resolution for distinguishing species were ITS and trn L- trn F.

Methods A simulated client method was conducted to estimate the non-prescription sale of antibiotics and service quality based on scenarios about adult acute upper respiratory tract infection in 2019. A total of 595 community pharmacies from 11 districts were investigated in Guangzhou, China. We used binary logistic regression to evaluate the factors associated with the non-prescription sale of antibiotics. Results The proportion of non-prescription dispensing of antibiotics was 63.1% in Guangzhou, China, with a higher incidence of antibiotic dispensing without prescription in outer districts (69.3%). Cephalosporin (44.1%) and Amoxicillin (39.0%) were sold more often than other antibiotics. Chain pharmacies had better performance on the prescription sale of antibiotics and service quality. Traditional Chinese medicine was commonly recommended by pharmacy staff. Conclusion Since the non-prescription sale of antibiotics is prevalent in Guangzhou, effective solutions should be determined. Strengthened public awareness and regulatory system innovation are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3112011859,"Aims Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a widespread disease with high global socio-economic impact. However, detailed pathomechanisms are still unclear, partly because current animal models of OSA do not simulate spontaneous airway obstruction. We tested whether polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) injection into the tongue induces spontaneous obstructive apneas. Methods and results PTFE (100 μl) was injected into the tongue of 31 male C57BL/6 mice and 28 mice were used as control. Spontaneous apneas and inspiratory flow limitations were recorded by whole-body plethysmography and mRNA expression of the hypoxia marker KDM6A was quantified by qPCR. Left ventricular function was assessed by echocardiography and ventricular CaMKII expression was measured by Western blotting. After PTFE injection, mice showed features of OSA such as significantly increased tongue diameters that were associated with significantly and sustained increased frequencies of inspiratory flow limitations and apneas. Decreased KDM6A mRNA levels indicated chronic hypoxemia. 8 weeks after surgery, PTFE-treated mice showed a significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Moreover, the severity of diastolic dysfunction (measured as E/e’) correlated significantly with the frequency of apneas. Accordingly, CaMKII expression was significantly increased in PTFE mice and correlated significantly with the frequency of apneas. Conclusions We describe here the first mouse model of spontaneous inspiratory flow limitations, obstructive apneas, and hypoxia by tongue enlargement due to PTFE injection. These mice develop systolic and diastolic dysfunction and increased CaMKII expression. This mouse model offers great opportunities to investigate the effects of obstructive apneas."
https://openalex.org/W3111905302,"Background Urinary tract infections are the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. The emergence of multiple-drug-resistant (MDR) strains of gram-negative bacteria causing urinary tract infection has become a serious concern in cancer patients. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the spectrum and antibiotic resistance pattern of bacterial isolates related to urinary tract infections among cancer patients at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods and materials Hospital based prospective cross-sectional study was conducted for three months from January to March 2018 in tertiary care hospital located in the capital city of the country. Gram-negative bacteria isolated from urine specimens from hospitalized patients with cancer were characterized using standard microbiological methods. Modified Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion technique was applied for antimicrobial susceptibility testing in accordance with CLSI 2019 criteria. Results Of totally 292 urine samples tested, eighteen (6.3%) were culture positive cases, Escherichia coli (44.4%) was the highest proportion isolated uropathogen followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (22.2%) and Citrobacter diversus (16.7%). The antibiotic susceptibility results showed meropenem and nitrofurantoin as the most effective antibiotics for E . coli , K . pneumoniae , and Citrobacter diversus isolates. The rate of multidrug resistant (MDR) isolates were 33.3% (6/18), and meropenem and nitrofurantoin were the most effective antibiotic against MDR isolates. Conclusion The study findings showed a significant distribution of MDR gram-negative bacteria which may increase the burden of urinary tract associated infections in cancer patients. Carbapenem (meropenem) can be considered as effective agents to treat MDR cases in our region."
https://openalex.org/W3113195260,"Supporting Limb Laminitis (SLL) is a painful and crippling secondary complication of orthopedic injuries and infections in horses, often resulting in euthanasia. SLL causes structural alterations and inflammation of the interdigitating layers of specialized epidermal and dermal tissues, the lamellae, which suspend the equine distal phalanx from the hoof capsule. Activation of the interleukin-17A (IL-17A)-dependent inflammatory pathway is an epidermal stress response that contributes to physiologic cutaneous wound healing as well as pathological skin conditions. As a first test of the hypothesis that hoof lamellae of horses diagnosed with SLL also respond to stress by activating the IL-17A pathway, the expression of IL-17A, IL-17 receptor subunit A and 11 IL-17A effector genes was measured by RT-PCR or qPCR. Lamellar tissue was isolated from Thoroughbreds euthanized due to naturally occurring SLL and in age and breed matched non-laminitic controls. By RT-PCR, the IL-17 Receptor A subunit was expressed in both non-laminitic and laminitic tissues, while IL-17A was primarily detectable in laminitic tissues. IL-17A target gene expression was undetectable in non-laminitic samples with the exception of weak detection of DEFB4B , S100A9 and PTSG2 . In contrast, all target genes examined, except CCL20 , were expressed by some or all laminitic samples. By qPCR, severe acute (n = 7) SLL expressed ~15–100 fold higher levels of DEFB4B and S100A9 genes compared to non-laminitic controls (n = 8). DEFB4B was also upregulated in developmental/subclinical (n = 8) and moderate acute (n = 7) by ~ 5-fold, and in severe chronic (n = 5) by ~15–200 fold. In situ hybridization ( DEFB4 ) and immunofluorescence (calprotectin, a dimer of S100A9/S100A8 proteins) demonstrated expression in keratinocytes, primarily in suprabasal cell layers, from SLL samples. These data demonstrate upregulation of a cohort of IL-17A target genes in SLL and support the hypothesis that similarities in the response to stresses and damage exist between equine and human epidermal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W3111084455,"Background We sought to identify immunoglobin G autoantibodies predictive of early treatment response to methotrexate, the recommended first-line therapy for patients with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis, and to the interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor biologic tocilizumab, initiated as the first disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug. Materials and methods In baseline sera of a subset of patients with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis in the U-Act-Early study, selected based on specific responder/non-responder criteria using the Disease Activity Score assessing 28 joints (DAS28) within the first 20 weeks, we measured immunoglobin G antibody reactivity against 463 protein antigens and performed supervised cluster analysis to identify predictive autoantibodies for treatment response. The analysis subset comprised 56 patients in the methotrexate arm (22 responders, 34 non-responders) and 50 patients in the tocilizumab arm (34 responders, 16 non-responders). For comparison, these analyses were also performed in 50 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Results Increased reactivity in responders versus non-responders was found in the methotrexate arm against two antigens—DOT1-like histone lysine methyltransferase (p = 0.009) and tropomyosin (p = 0.003)—and in the tocilizumab arm against one antigen—neuro-oncological ventral antigen 2 (p = 0.039). Decreased reactivity was detected against two antigens in the methotrexate arm—G 1 to S phase transition 2 (p = 0.023) and the zinc finger protein ZPR1 (p = 0.021). Reactivity against the identified antigens was not statistically significant in either treatment arm for patients with rheumatoid factor–positive versus–negative or anti-cyclic citrullinated test–positive versus test–negative rheumatoid arthritis (p ≥ 0.06). Conclusions Comprehensive profiling of baseline sera revealed several novel immunoglobin G autoantibodies associated with early treatment response to methotrexate and to tocilizumab in disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug-naive patients with rheumatoid arthritis. These findings could eventually yield clinically relevant predictive markers, if corroborated in different patient cohorts, and may facilitate future benefit in personalised healthcare."
https://openalex.org/W3112075618,"Portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) and Diffuse Reflectance Fourier Transformed Mid-Infrared (DRIFT-MIR) spectroscopy are rapid and cost-effective analytical tools for material characterization. Here, we provide an assessment of these methods for the analysis of total Carbon, Nitrogen and total elemental composition of multiple elements in organic amendments. We developed machine learning methods to rapidly quantify the concentrations of macro- and micronutrient elements present in the samples and propose a novel system for the quality assessment of organic amendments. Two types of machine learning methods, forest regression and extreme gradient boosting, were used with data from both pXRF and DRIFT-MIR spectroscopy. Cross-validation trials were run to evaluate generalizability of models produced on each instrument. Both methods demonstrated similar broad capabilities in estimating nutrients using machine learning, with pXRF being suitable for nutrients and contaminants. The results make portable spectrometry in combination with machine learning a scalable solution to provide comprehensive nutrient analysis for organic amendments."
https://openalex.org/W3112395725,"Macrophages play an indispensable role in both innate and acquired immunity, while the persistence of activated macrophages can sometimes be harmful to the host, resulting in multi-organ damage. Macrophages develop from monocytes in the circulation. However, little is known about the organ affinity of macrophages in the normal state. Using in vivo imaging with XenoLight DiR®, we observed that macrophages showed strong affinity for the liver, spleen and lung, and weak affinity for the gut and bone marrow, but little or no affinity for the kidney and skin. We also found that administered macrophages were still alive 168 hours after injection. On the other hand, treatment with clodronate liposomes, which are readily taken up by macrophages via phagocytosis, strongly reduced the number of macrophages in the liver, spleen and lung."
https://openalex.org/W3113299197,"Marine reserves constitute effective tools for preserving fish stocks and associated human benefits. However, not all reserves perform equally, and predicting the response of marine communities to management actions in the long run is challenging. Our decadal-scale survey of recreational fishing yields at France’s 45-year old Cerbère-Banyuls marine reserve indicated significant protection benefits, with 40–50% higher fishing yields per unit effort in the partial-protection zone of the reserve (where fishing is permitted but at a lower level) than in surrounding non-reserve areas. Over the period 2005–2014, catch per unit effort (CPUE) declined both inside and outside the reserve, while weight per unit effort (WPUE) increased by 131% inside and decreased by 60% outside. Different CPUE and WPUE trajectories among fish families indicated changing catch assemblages, with yields increasing for the family most valued by fisheries, Sparidae (the ecological winners). However, reserve benefits were restricted to off-shore fishermen (the social winners), as on-shore yields were ~4 times lower and declining, even inside the reserve. Our study illustrates how surveys of recreational fishing yields can help evaluate the effectiveness of marine protected areas for key social and ecological protagonists. We show that, more than four decades after its establishment, fishing efficiencies at the historical Cerbère-Banyuls marine reserve are still changing, but benefits in terms of catch abundance, weight, and composition remain predominantly restricted to off-shore fishermen. Further regulations appear necessary to guarantee that conservation strategies equitably benefit societal groups."
https://openalex.org/W3110905887,"Introduction Pain is a very frequent symptom that is reported by patients when they present to health professionals but remains undertreated or untreated, particularly in low-resource settings including Nigeria. Lack of training in pain management remains the most significant obstacle to pain treatment alongside an inadequate emphasis on pain education in undergraduate medical curricula, negatively impacting on subsequent care of patients. This study aimed to determine the effect of a 12-week structured e-Learning course on the knowledge of pain management among Nigerian undergraduate medical students. Methods Prospective, multisite, pre-post study conducted across five medical colleges in Nigeria. Structured modules covering aspects of pain management were delivered on an e-Learning platform. Pre- and post-test self-assessments were carried out in the 12-week duration of the study. User experience questionnaires and qualitative interviews were conducted via instant messaging to evaluate user experiences of the platform. User experience data was analysed using the UEQ Data Analysis Tool and Framework Analysis. Results A total of 216 of 659 eligible students completed all sections of the e-Learning course. Participant mean age was 23.52 years, with a slight female predominance (55.3%). Across all participants, an increase in median pre- and post-test scores occurred, from 40 to 60 (Z = 11.3, p&lt;0.001, effect size = 1.3), suggestive of increased knowledge acquisition relating to pain management. Participants suggested e-Learning is a valuable approach to delivering pain education alongside identifying factors to address in future iterations. Conclusion e-Learning approaches to pain management education can enhance traditional learning methods and may increase students’ knowledge. Future iterations of e-Learning approaches will need to consider facilitating the download of data and content for the platform to increase user uptake and engagement. The platform was piloted as an optional adjunct to existing curricula. Future efforts to advocate and support integration of e-Learning for pain education should be two-fold; both to include pain education in the curricula of medical colleges across Nigeria and the use of e-Learning approaches to enhance teaching where feasible."
https://openalex.org/W3112246397,"Previous studies have evaluated the risk factors for relapse of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) and the biomarkers of AAV for predicting relapse. However, little is known about the association between the presence of sinusitis and relapse and changes in the ANCA levels in AAV. This single-center, retrospective cohort study included 104 consecutive patients who were newly diagnosed with myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA-positive microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) between 2006 and 2018 and were treated at the Aichi Medical University Hospital in Japan. The relationships between sinusitis and relapse of vasculitis and elevated MPO-ANCA levels were assessed using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models that were adjusted for clinically relevant factors. During the entire follow-up period (median, 24 months; interquartile range, 7–54 months), 93 (89.4%) patients achieved remission. After achieving remission, 38 (40.9%) patients experienced at least one relapse (13 [65.0%] in the sinusitis group; 25 [34.3%] in the non-sinusitis group). Sinusitis was identified as a significant predictor of relapse (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19–4.88; P = 0.015). Furthermore, sinusitis was more likely to be associated with elevated MPO-ANCA levels (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.59, 95% CI: 1.14–5.92; P = 0.024). In conclusion, sinusitis was associated with a higher risk of relapse and elevated MPO-ANCA levels in MPA patients, suggesting that careful management may be required to reduce the risk of relapse in patients with sinusitis. Further studies are needed to elucidate the optimal treatment strategy for these patients."
https://openalex.org/W3111048993,"Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of deaths globally. Machine learning studies predicting mortality rates for ischemic heart disease (IHD) at the municipal level are very limited. The goal of this paper was to create and validate a Heart Health Care Index (HHCI) to predict risk of IHD based on location and risk factors. Secondary data, geographical information system (GIS) and machine learning were used to validate the HHCI and stratify the IHD municipality risk in the state of Paraná. A positive spatial autocorrelation was found (Moran’s I = 0.6472, p-value = 0.001), showing clusters of high IHD mortality. The Support Vector Machine, which had an RMSE of 0.789 and error proportion close to one (0.867), was the best for prediction among eight machine learning algorithms after validation. In the north and northwest regions of the state, HHCI was low and mortality clusters patterns were high. By creating an HHCI through ML, we can predict IHD mortality rate at municipal level, identifying predictive characteristics that impact health conditions of these localities’ guided health management decisions for improvements for IHD within the emergency care network in the state of Paraná."
https://openalex.org/W3112331543,"Objective Maternal and newborn mortality rates are high in peri-urban areas in cities in Kenya, yet little is known about what drives women’s decisions on where to deliver. This study aimed at understanding women’s preferences on place of childbirth and how sociodemographic factors shape these preferences. Methods This study used a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) to quantify the relative importance of attributes on women’s choice of place of childbirth within a peri-urban setting in Nairobi, Kenya. Participants were women aged 18–49 years, who had delivered at six health facilities. The DCE consisted of six attributes: cleanliness, availability of medical equipment and drug supplies, attitude of healthcare worker, cost of delivery services, the quality of clinical services, distance and an opt-out alternative. Each woman received eight questions. A conditional logit model established the relative strength of preferences. A mixed logit model was used to assess how women’s preferences for selected attributes changed based on their sociodemographic characteristics. Results 411 women participated in the Discrete Choice Experiment, a response rate of 97.6% and completed 20,080 choice tasks. Health facility cleanliness was found to have the strongest association with choice of health facility (β = 1.488 p&lt;0.001) followed respectively by medical equipment and supplies availability (β = 1.435 p&lt;0.001). The opt-out alternative (β = 1.424 p&lt;0.001) came third. The attitude of the health care workers (β = 1.347, p&lt;0.001), quality of clinical services (β = 0.385, p&lt;0.001), distance (β = 0.339, p&lt;0.001) and cost (β = 0.0002 p&lt;0.001) were ranked 4 th to 7 th respectively. Women who were younger and were the main income earners having a stronger preference for clean health facilities. Older married women had stronger preference for availability of medical equipment and kind healthcare workers. Conclusions Women preferred both technical and process indicators of quality of care. DCE’s can lead to the development of person-centered strategies that take into account the preferences of women to improve maternal and newborn health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3113033650,"Background In much of sub-Saharan Africa, male partners play influential roles in women's access to maternal-child healthcare, including prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV services. We explored male partner perspectives on women’s access to maternal-child healthcare in North-Central Nigeria. Methods Three focus groups were conducted with 30 men, purposefully-selected on the basis of being married, and rural or urban residence. Major themes explored were men’s maternal-child health knowledge, gender power dynamics in women’s access to healthcare, and peer support for pregnant and postpartum women. Data were manually analyzed using Grounded Theory, which involves constructing theories out of data collected, rather than applying pre-formed theories. Results Mean participant age was 48.3 years, with 36.7% aged &lt;40 years, 46.7% between 41 and 60 years, and 16.6% over 60 years old. Religious affiliation was self-reported; 60% of participants were Muslim and 40% were Christian. There was consensus on the acceptability of maternal-child health services and their importance for optimal maternal-infant outcomes. Citing underlying patriarchal norms, participants acknowledged that men had more influence in family health decision-making than women. However, positive interpersonal couple relationships were thought to facilitate equitable decision-making among couples. Financial constraints, male-unfriendly clinics and poor healthcare worker attitudes were major barriers to women’s access and male partner involvement. The provision of psychosocial and maternal peer support from trained women was deemed highly acceptable for both HIV-positive and HIV-negative women. Conclusions Strategic engagement of community leaders, including traditional and religious leaders, is needed to address harmful norms and practices underlying gender inequity in health decision-making. Gender mainstreaming, where the needs and concerns of both men and women are considered, should be applied in maternal-child healthcare education and delivery. Clinic fee reductions or elimination can facilitate service access. Finally, professional organizations can do more to reinforce respectful maternity care among healthcare workers."

Materials and methods In this observational cross-sectional study, eyes with and without TEX or PEX were assessed by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) imaging. Bilateral OCTA images (4.5 × 4.5 mm 2 ) centered at the optic nerve head were obtained using a commercial spectral domain OCTA system. Optic nerve head perfusion was quantified using the split-spectrum amplitude decorrelation angiography algorithm. Categorical and continuous variables were compared using the chi-squared test and one-way analysis of variance, respectively. The generalized estimating equation was used to adjust for confounding factors and determine inter-ocular associations. Results We enrolled 39 eyes with TEX, 31 eyes with PEX, and 32 control eyes. There were no significant differences among the three groups regarding age, intraocular pressure, cup-to-disc ratio, blood pressure, or axial length (all p&gt;0.05). There were significant differences in global PCD among the three groups (p = 0.01). There were significant differences in annular PCD between the TEX and PEX groups (p = 0.027). Conclusions While both global and annular PCDs did not differ between the TEX and control groups, greater loss of annular PCD in the PEX group than in the TEX and control groups suggests more pronounced microvascular disturbance in PEX. Synopsis/Precis Greater microvascular attenuation in PEX compared with TEX and normal control measured by OCTA."
https://openalex.org/W3111871799,"The cryptocurrency system Bitcoin uses a peer-to-peer network to distribute new transactions to all participants. For risk estimation and usability aspects of Bitcoin applications, it is necessary to know the time required to disseminate a transaction within the network. Unfortunately, this time is not immediately obvious and hard to acquire. Measuring the dissemination latency requires many connections into the Bitcoin network, wasting network resources. Some third parties operate that way and publish large scale measurements. Relying on these measurements introduces a dependency and requires additional trust. This work describes how to unobtrusively acquire reliable estimates of the dissemination latencies for transactions without involving a third party. The dissemination latency is modelled with a lognormal distribution, and we estimate their parameters using a Bayesian model that can be updated dynamically. Our approach provides reliable estimates even when using only eight connections, the minimum connection number used by the default Bitcoin client. We provide an implementation of our approach as well as datasets for modelling and evaluation. Our approach, while slightly underestimating the latency distribution, is largely congruent with observed dissemination latencies."
https://openalex.org/W3113128143,"Classical land rent theories imply that the best land is cultivated first. This principle forms the basis of many land-use studies, but empirical evidence remains limited, especially on a global scale. In this paper, we estimate the effects of agricultural suitability and market accessibility on the spatial allocation of cultivated areas at a 30 arc-min resolution in 15 world regions. Our results show that both determinants often have a significant positive effect on the cropland fraction, but with large variations in strength across regions. Based on a quantile analysis, we find that agricultural suitability is the dominant driver of cropland allocation in North America, Middle East and North Africa and Eastern Europe, whereas market accessibility shows a stronger effect in other regions, such as Western Africa. In some regions, such as South and Central America, both determinants have a limited effect on cropland fraction. Comparison of high versus low quantile regression coefficients shows that, in most regions, densely cropped areas are more sensitive to agricultural suitability and market accessibility than sparsely cropped areas."
