https://openalex.org/W2983671856,"The transition to a terrestrial environment, termed terrestrialization, is generally regarded as a pivotal event in the evolution and diversification of the land plant flora that changed the surface of our planet. Through phylogenomic studies, a group of streptophyte algae, the Zygnematophyceae, have recently been recognized as the likely sister group to land plants (embryophytes). Here, we report genome sequences and analyses of two early diverging Zygnematophyceae (Spirogloea muscicola gen. nov. and Mesotaenium endlicherianum) that share the same subaerial/terrestrial habitat with the earliest-diverging embryophytes, the bryophytes. We provide evidence that genes (i.e., GRAS and PYR/PYL/RCAR) that increase resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses in land plants, in particular desiccation, originated or expanded in the common ancestor of Zygnematophyceae and embryophytes, and were gained by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from soil bacteria. These two Zygnematophyceae genomes represent a cornerstone for future studies to understand the underlying molecular mechanism and process of plant terrestrialization."

By creating new mammary tumor models, we find that tumor mutation burden and specific immune cells are associated with response. Further, we developed a rich resource of single-cell RNA-seq and bulk mRNA-seq data of immunotherapy-treated and non-treated tumors from sensitive and resistant murine models. Using this, we uncover that immune checkpoint therapy induces T follicular helper cell activation of B cells to facilitate the anti-tumor response in these models. We also show that B cell activation of T cells and the generation of antibody are key to immunotherapy response and propose a new biomarker for immune checkpoint therapy. In total, this work presents resources of new preclinical models of breast cancer with large mRNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq datasets annotated for sensitivity to therapy and uncovers new components of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have improved patient outcomes in human cancers (Le et al., 2015Le D.T. Uram J.N. Wang H. Bartlett B.R. Kemberling H. Eyring A.D. Skora A.D. Luber B.S. Azad N.S.

Allison J.P. The future of immune checkpoint therapy.Science. 2015; 348: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (3023) Google Scholar). In many solid tumors, tumor mutation burden (TMB) and, as a result of high TMB, neoantigen load are biomarkers for therapeutic benefit. For example, in colorectal cancers, mismatch-repair status predicted clinical benefit for the anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab (Le et al., 2015Le D.T. Uram J.N. Wang H. Bartlett B.R. Kemberling H. Eyring A.D. Skora A.D. Luber B.S. Azad N.S. Laheru D. et al.PD-1 blockade in tumors with mismatch-repair deficiency.N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 372: 2509-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (6107) Google Scholar). In non-small cell lung cancer, a mutation signature linked to smoking predicted anti-PD1 efficacy (Rizvi et al., 2015Rizvi N.A. Hellmann M.D. Snyder A. Kvistborg P. Makarov V. Havel J.J. Lee W. Yuan J. Wong P. Ho T.S. et al.Cancer immunology. Mutational landscape determines sensitivity to PD-1 blockade in non-small cell lung cancer.Science. 2015; 348: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5526) Google Scholar). In melanoma, TMB and neoantigen load predict patient response to anti-CTLA-4 therapy (Van Allen et al., 2015Van Allen E.M. Miao D. Schilling B. Shukla S.A. Blank C. Zimmer L. Sucker A. Hillen U.

The presence of CD8+ T cells(Tumeh et al., 2014Tumeh P.C. Harview C.L. Yearley J.H. Shintaku I.P. Taylor E.J. Robert L. Chmielowski B. Spasic M. Henry G. Ciobanu V. et al.PD-1 blockade induces responses by inhibiting adaptive immune resistance.Nature. 2014; 515: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (4364) Google Scholar) and expression of immune checkpoint genes, such as the PD1 ligand (PD-L1) (Topalian et al., 2012Topalian S.L. Hodi F.S. Brahmer J.R. Gettinger S.N. Smith D.C. McDermott D.F. Powderly J.D. Carvajal R.D. Sosman J.A. Atkins M.B. et al.Safety, activity, and immune correlates of anti-PD-1 antibody in cancer.N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 366: 2443-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (9274) Google Scholar) and CTLA-4 (Herbst et al., 2014Herbst R.S. Soria J.-C. Kowanetz M. Fine G.D. Hamid O. Gordon M.S. Sosman J.A. McDermott D.F. Powderly J.D.

These data indicate that predicting response to ICI is multi-factorial and requires additional studies. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), immune cells identified by pathology (i.e., tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes [TILs]) or by genomic signatures indicate a favorable prognosis (Iglesia et al., 2014Iglesia M.D. Vincent B.G. Parker J.S. Hoadley K.A. Carey L.A. Perou C.M. Serody J.S. Prognostic B-cell signatures using mRNA-seq in patients with subtype-specific breast and ovarian cancer.Clin.

Policheni A.N. Darcy P.K. Vaillant F. Mintoff C.P. Dushyanthen S. Mansour M. Pang J.-M.B. Fox S.B.

Cancer. 2002; 87: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In addition to immune infiltration, TNBC tends to harbor higher TMB among breast cancers. Recently, atezolizumab (an anti-PDL1 antibody) plus nab-paclitaxel was shown to prolong progression-free survival in TNBC patients with PD-L1 positive tumors (Schmid et al., 2018Schmid P. Adams S. Rugo H.S. Schneeweiss A. Barrios C.H. Iwata H. Diéras V. Hegg R. Im S.-A. Shaw Wright G. et al.IMpassion130 Trial InvestigatorsAtezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel in advanced triple-negative breast Cancer.N. Engl. J. Med. 2018; 379: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). With this success and FDA approval, ICI response rates still range from 10% to 20% (Wein et al., 2018Wein L. Luen S.J. Savas P. Salgado R. Loi S. Checkpoint blockade in the treatment of breast cancer: current status and future directions.Br. J. Cancer. 2018; 119: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and atezolizumab’s impact on TNBC overall survival is modest. Given lessons from other cancer types, we hypothesized that TMB and immune cell infiltration could be important factors in response to ICIs for TNBC. In breast cancer, APOBEC3B enzyme activity is linked to mutagenesis of tumor genomes (Burns et al., 2013Burns M.B. Lackey L. Carpenter M.A. Rathore A. Land A.M. Leonard B. Refsland E.W. Kotandeniya D. Tretyakova N. Nikas J.B. et al.APOBEC3B is an enzymatic source of mutation in breast cancer.Nature. 2013; 494: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). APOBEC3B is a cytidine deaminase and, upon activity, creates abasic sites that lead to mutations (Morganella et al., 2016Morganella S. Alexandrov L.B. Glodzik D. Zou X. Davies H. Staaf J. Sieuwerts A.M. Brinkman A.B. Martin S. Ramakrishna M. et al.The topography of mutational processes in breast cancer genomes.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 11383Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and potentially neoantigens. Since mutation load predicts ICI response in other cancers (Rizvi et al., 2015Rizvi N.A. Hellmann M.D. Snyder A. Kvistborg P. Makarov V. Havel J.J. Lee W. Yuan J. Wong P. Ho T.S. et al.Cancer immunology.

Goldinger S.M. et al.Genomic correlates of response to CTLA-4 blockade in metastatic melanoma.Science. 2015; 350: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar) and APOBEC3B activity corresponds with higher TMB in breast cancer (Burns et al., 2013Burns M.B. Lackey L. Carpenter M.A. Rathore A. Land A.M. Leonard B. Refsland E.W. Kotandeniya D. Tretyakova N. Nikas J.B. et al.APOBEC3B is an enzymatic source of mutation in breast cancer.Nature. 2013; 494: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), we created two separate, genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of mammary cancers with overexpression of murine APOBEC3. Similarly, we used short-wave ultraviolet (UV) radiation to create additional high TMB GEMMs. We refer to the lines with intentionally increased TMB as “mutagenized lines” and the non-mutated version of each line as its “parental line.” Using these and other mouse models of TNBC in a pre-clinical trial of anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy, we identify factors that mediate responses to ICIs, including an important role for CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, B cells, and the generation of antibody by those B cells in the anti-tumor response to dual ICIs. To study the response to ICIs and identify predictive biomarkers, we turned to a genetically controlled model system, namely a rich resource of credentialed mouse models of TNBC (Hollern et al., 2019Hollern D.P. Contreras C.M. Dance-Barnes S. Silva G.O. Pfefferle A.D. Xiong J. Darr D.B. Usary J. Mott K.R. Perou C.M.

Figure 1 shows the key mRNA features for 290 specimens from multiple GEMMs. Within Tp53−/− and K14-Cre;Tp53f/f; Brca1f/f models, we selected transplantable sublines to establish a cohort for anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA-4 combination therapy (abbreviated as aPD1/aCTLA4 or ICI; 7 models used for initial ICI testing). Our work here focused on experimentation, predominately in two different GEMMs: Tp53−/− tumor syngeneic transplant derived cell line (T11) and a cell line from a K14-Cre;Tp53f/f; Brca1f/f tumor (KPB25L). Other treated GEMMs are listed in Table 1. These mouse models of TNBC represent multiple subtypes (i.e., basal-like and claudin-low [Parker et al., 2009Parker J.S. Mullins M. Cheang M.C. Leung S.

Diverse expression of immune checkpoint genes Pdcd1, Cd274 (Pd-l1), and Ctla4 was also noted in the seven syngeneic, transplantable murine lines used for testing ICI therapy.Table 1Response to Combination ImmunotherapyModelGeneticsSubtypeMutation loadMedian survival untreatedMedian survival aPD1/aCTLA410-day response untreated10-day response aPD1/aCTLA42225LTP53−/−Basal-like1110 days, n = 159.5 days, n = 183,951 ± 172, n = 153,098 ± 315, n = 182336RTP53−/−Basal-like5019 days, n = 2218 days, n = 251,319 ± 324, n = 221,372 ± 313, n = 252224LTP53−/−Basal-like399 days, n = 229 days, n = 223,108 ± 219, n = 222,905 ± 224, n = 229263-3FTP53−/−Basal-like879 days, n = 89 days, n = 73,868 ± 255, n = 84,123 ± 0, n = 72153FTP53−/−Luminal-like5712.5 days, n = 1811 days, n = 172,906 ± 312, n = 183,183 ± 282, n = 17T11TP53−/−Claudin-low11713 days, n = 2012 days, n = 162,149 ± 265, n = 202,721 ± 324, n = 16T11-ApobecTP53−/−; Apobec3 overexpressedClaudin-low37414 days, n = 1938 days, n = 40∗1,782 ± 307, n = 1976 ± 37, n = 40∗T11-UVTP53−/−; Short-wave UV exposureClaudin-low1,78311 days, n = 1225 days, n = 16∗2,547 ± 356, n = 12452 ± 107, n = 16∗KPB25LK14-Cre; TP53 f/f Brca1 f/fBasal-like18121 days, n = 1728 days, n = 13∗1,670 ± 383, n = 17260 ± 869, n = 13∗KPB25L-ApobecK14-Cre; TP53 f/f Brca1 f/f; Apobec3 overexpressedBasal-like30943 days, n = 1164 days, n = 13∗125 ± 30, n = 11−12 ± 16, n = 13∗KPB25L-UVK14-Cre; TP53 f/f Brca1 f/f; Short-wave UV exposureBasal-like31637 days, n = 2674 days, n = 26∗230 ± 60, n = 26−22 ± 7, n = 26∗∗ denotes p < 0.05 in comparison to untreated cohort; 10 day response = change in volume m3m, ± SEM.

Initial testing with aPD1/aCTLA4 therapy in TNBC GEMMs showed no response in six out of seven tumor lines (Table 1; Figure S1A). Resistant GEMMs had a low TMB (Figure S1B) and a low predicted neoantigen burden (Figure S1C). Murine tumors had lower TMBs than typically found in human breast cancer, considerably lower than ICI-responsive human non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) and melanomas (Figure S1D). The lone (moderately) sensitive model was a BRCA1-deficient tumor line (KPB25L), which had higher relative TMB. Thus, we posited that, to accurately reflect the ICI response clinically, we needed to develop additional models that reflect the higher TMB of human cancers. Because Apobec3 is linked to mutagenesis of breast cancer (Burns et al., 2013Burns M.B. Lackey L. Carpenter M.A. Rathore A. Land A.M. Leonard B. Refsland E.W. Kotandeniya D. Tretyakova N. Nikas J.B. et al.APOBEC3B is an enzymatic source of mutation in breast cancer.Nature. 2013; 494: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) and immune cell infiltrates (Budczies et al., 2018Budczies J.

APOBEC3B and APOBEC mutational signature as potential predictive markers for immunotherapy response in non-small cell lung cancer.Oncogene. 2018; 37: 3924-3936Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Apobec3 could elevate the mutation load and number of predicted neoantigens, possibly sensitizing a previously resistant GEMM tumor to ICI therapy. Similarly, we hypothesized exposure to UV radiation could lock in new mutations to create high-TMB models and improve ICI sensitivity. Indeed, Apobec3 overexpression (T11-Apobec, KPB25L-Apobec; Figure 2A) and UV exposure (T11-UV, KPB25Luv; Figure 2B) markedly increased TMB as compared with the matched time-in-culture parental cell lines (T11, KPB25L). As expected, having a higher TMB also led to a higher predicted neoantigen load in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype-compatible lines (Figure S1C).Figure 2Intentional Elevation of Tumor Mutation Burden Sensitizes Tumors to aPD1/aCTLA4 Combination TherapyShow full caption(A) Left: total somatic mutation burden in ectopic Apobec3 overexpressing lines and parental control lines.

In support of the TMB and neoantigen hypothesis of ICI responsiveness, the parental lines showed little sensitivity to aPD1/aCTLA4 therapy (Figure 2B) while the mutagenized lines had robust responses (Figures 2C and S1E). The response data for all sensitive and resistant lines are shown in Figure S1 and Table 1. Table S1 lists hazard ratios for every survival endpoint in this report. We also tested single-agent aPD1 and aCTLA4 and noted that, while sometimes effective, single ICIs were inferior to combinations (Figure S1F). Testing isotype controls confirmed that response to therapy was not driven by the presence of exogenous IgG2a or IgG2b antibodies (Figure S1G), consistent with the lack of any therapeutic effect in resistant lines. As controls, Apobec3 overexpression and UV-based mutagenesis strategies did not impact proliferation in vitro (Figure S2). All together, these results signify TMB as a key marker for ICI efficacy in the murine TNBC models tested here. To test for additional predictors of response to ICI therapy, we examined pretreatment tumors (5 mm in diameter) from sensitive and resistant models with mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq). Published mRNA signatures for CD4+ T cells (Newman et al., 2015Newman A.M. Liu C.L. Green M.R. Gentles A.J. Feng W. Xu Y. Hoang C.D. Diehn M. Alizadeh A.A.

Levels of immune checkpoint genes Pdcd1 and Ctla4 (Figure 2E) as well as interferon-gamma (serum and tumor; Figure 3C) were also significantly higher in sensitive tumors. Thus, we hypothesized that our mRNA-seq data may enable the development of new mRNA-based biomarkers. We therefore performed supervised analyses to derive signatures differentiating sensitive from resistant tumors. Given that functionally related genes often covary, we used hierarchical clustering and SigClust (Huang et al., 2015Huang H. Liu Y. Marron J. Huang M.H. Package ‘sigclust’. Department of Statistics and Operations Research, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina, 2015Google Scholar) to identify metagenes of statistical significance and probable biological meaning (Figure 3A; Data S1). This identified a large cluster of immune cell genes (immune activity cluster) and a smaller node of B cell genes, IgGs, and T cell genes (Figure S3A) that is henceforth referred to as the B cell/T cell co-cluster.Figure S3Supervised Analysis Comparing aPD1/aCTLA4 Therapy-Sensitive to aPD1/aCTLA4 Therapy-Resistant Mouse Mammary Tumors, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) An expression heatmap showing values of B cell/T cell co-cluster signature genes across RNA-seq data of sorted immune cells.

Immune checkpoint therapy (ICT) is an immunotherapeutic modality that targets cytotoxic lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and reverses the immunosuppressive state by reactivating anti-tumor T cells, including CD4 Th1 effector T cells and CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (Dong et al., 2002Dong H.

Monoclonal antibodies against these immune checkpoint targets have shown encouraging results across a spectrum of tumors. For example, blocking either CTLA-4 or PD-1 in patients with metastatic melanoma resulted in object response rates ranging from 20% to 45% (Hodi et al., 2010Hodi F.S. O’Day S.J. McDermott D.F.

The therapeutic efficacy of ICT depends on the expansion of intra-tumoral CD4 Th1 lineage cells, the activation of cytotoxic CD8 T cells, and the generation of long-term memory T cells (Chen et al., 2009Chen H.

On the basis of the concept of targeting T cells, as opposed to tumor cells, ICT has been FDA-approved or is being developed as treatment for multiple tumor types such as lung, bladder, gastric, kidney, and many other cancers (Fuchs et al., 2018Fuchs C.S.

Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy diagnosed in men (Siegel et al., 2012Siegel R. Naishadham D. Jemal A. Cancer statistics, 2012.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2012; 62: 10-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (10437) Google Scholar). Despite a rapid initial response to androgen deprivation therapy, the majority of prostate cancer patients eventually progress to lethal metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and bone is the most common site of metastases (70%–80%) (Halabi et al., 2016Halabi S. Kelly W.K. Ma H. Zhou H. Solomon N.C. Fizazi K. Tangen C.M. Rosenthal M. Petrylak D.P. Hussain M. et al.Meta-analysis evaluating the impact of site of metastasis on overall survival in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer.J. Clin. Oncol. 2016; 34: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In a previous phase III trial of ipilimumab versus placebo in patients with mCRPC, those with bone metastases responded poorly compared with those without bone metastases (Beer et al., 2017Beer T.M. Kwon E.D. Drake C.G. Fizazi K. Logothetis C. Gravis G. Ganju V. Polikoff J. Saad F. Humanski P. et al.Randomized, double-blind, phase III trial of ipilimumab versus placebo in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with metastatic chemotherapy-naive castration-resistant prostate cancer.J. Clin. Oncol. 2017; 35: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). More recently, in a phase II trial (NCT02985957) conducted on patients with mCRPC, ICT elicited prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses in only 1 of 24 (4%) patients with bone metastases as compared with PSA responses in 9 of 50 (18%) patients without bone metastases (Sharma et al., 2019Sharma P. Pachynski R.K. Narayan V. Flechon A. Gravis G. Galsky M.D. Mahammedi H. Patnaik A. Subudhi S.K. Ciprotti M. et al.Initial results from a phase II study of nivolumab (NIVO) plus ipilimumab (IPI) for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC; CheckMate 650).J. Clin. Oncol. 2019; 37 (142): 142Crossref Google Scholar). The sub-optimal response of CRPC bone metastases to ICT suggests a distinct immunological niche in the bone microenvironment compared with that of soft tissue metastases. To test this hypothesis and identify underlying mechanisms, we compared pre- and post-treatment bone marrow tissues from patients with mCRPC to the bone from patients who were treated with ipilimumab in two clinical trials (NCT02985957 and NCT02703623). In addition, we established murine osseous and non-osseous (subcutaneous) CRPC models and performed high-dimensional single-cell analysis with mass cytometry (CyTOF), single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (TCR-seq), and multiplex cytokine profiling to identify the distinct immune cell subsets and cytokine environment in the tumor lesions. On the basis of our findings, we devised and evaluated an organ-specific strategy of targeting the microenvironment associated with bone metastases to improve anti-tumor responses with ICT. ICT is known to expand intra-tumoral CD4 Th1 effector cells in multiple tumor types involving soft tissues, as published for both animal models and patient samples (Chen et al., 2009Chen H. Liakou C.I. Kamat A. Pettaway C. Ward J.F. Tang D.N. Sun J. Jungbluth A.A. Troncoso P. Logothetis C. Sharma P.

Consistent with these data, we observed an enhanced Th1 subset signature in paired pre- and post-treatment primary soft-tissue prostate tumors of patients treated with ipilimumab (NCT01194271) (Figure 1A). In contrast, when we compared nine paired pre- and post-treatment bone marrow samples from ipilimumab-treated patients with bone mCRPC (NCT02703623 and NCT02985957) (Table S1), we observed a significant increase in Th17 cells but not in Th1 effector cells (Figures 1B and S1). The absence of an increase in Th1 lineage in bone metastatic sites after ICT suggests a distinct tumor microenvironment in the bone as compared to soft tissue, which we surmised was a mechanistic basis for the resistance to ICT.Figure S1Ipilimumab Induces Th17 as Opposed to Th1 Lineage Expansion in Bone Metastases from Patients with Prostate Cancer, Related to Figure 1Show full captionHeatmaps showing the immuno-phenotype of each subset of each sample (pre- or post- ipilimumab treated) of 9 patients from two clinical trials (NCT02703623; 02985957).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Heatmaps showing the immuno-phenotype of each subset of each sample (pre- or post- ipilimumab treated) of 9 patients from two clinical trials (NCT02703623; 02985957). We established a mouse model of bone CRPC by intraosseous injection of syngeneic Myc-CaP prostate cancer cells (Figure 2A), followed by degarelix administration, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist that induces castrate levels of serum testosterone within 3 days (Figure S2A). The castration state lasted for 28 days, during which the tumor lesions continued to grow (Figures S2B and S2C), indicating successful induction of a model for CRPC. This murine model of prostate cancer was used to represent mCRPC to the bones. In addition, we established a subcutaneous CRPC murine model to mimic human CRPC in the primary prostate or metastases to a soft tissue (Figure S3A). The combination of anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1 antibodies had minimal effects on the tumor volume and overall survival of mice bearing the bone CRPC lesions (Figures 2B and 2C). In contrast, the combination induced significant regression of the subcutaneous CRPC and improved overall survival (Figure S3A and S3B). This is consistent with the clinical observation that ICT elicits a sub-optimal response in bone mCRPC as compared to soft-tissue mCRPC.Figure S2The Establishment of Murine Bone CRPC Model, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Quantification of testosterone levels in the sera of degarelix-administered mice.

We next profiled and compared the pre- and post-treatment tumor infiltrating CD45+ immune cell subsets in both the bone and subcutaneous CRPC models. ICT resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) in bone as well as subcutaneous CRPC (Figures 2D and S3C), which is consistent with previous findings of ICT-induced expansion of tumor-infiltrating T cells. Altogether, although ICT successfully expanded tumor-infiltrating T cells in both bone and subcutaneous CRPC, it failed to significantly inhibit growth of bone tumors. Next, we profiled CD3ε+CD11b− cells in bone CRPC by CyTOF, focusing on T cell subsets. The tumor-infiltrating T cells were divided into 15 clusters (Figure S4A), which were functionally annotated to 5 subsets: Th17 (CD4+IL17A+Foxp3−IFNγ−), Treg cells (CD4+Foxp3+), CD8 T cells (CD3ε+CD8a+), TCRγδ cells (CD3ε+TCRγδ+), and natural killer (NK) T cells (CD3ε+CD49b+NKp46−) (Figure 3A). The CD4 T cells in the bone CRPC model consisted of only Th17 and Treg lineages, and there was an absence of Th1 effector cells (CD4+IFNγ+Foxp3−) despite treatment with ICT (Figures 3A and 3B). Moreover, in the bone CRPC model, we found that Th17 cells increased significantly after ICT (Figures 3B and 3E). In contrast, in the subcutaneous CRPC model, Th1 cells were detected prior to the treatment (Figure 3C) and increased significantly after ICT, along with a decrease in Th17 and Treg cells (Figures 3D and 3E). Altogether, lack of Th1 effector lineage in the tumor microenvironment is a distinctive feature of bone CRPC and is possibly responsible for the poor response to ICT.Figure 3Lack of Th1 Lineage in Bone CRPC TumorsShow full caption(A) CyTOF mapping of tumor-infiltrating CD3ε+CD11b− T cells in bone and subcutaneous CRPC.

The lack of Th1 lineage in the bone CRPC suggests a distinct cytokine profile within the tumor-bearing bone microenvironment. Therefore, using bone marrow samples from tumor-bearing femurs and contralateral tumor-free femurs, we analyzed the levels of 13 cytokines associated with T cell lineage development: interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12/p70, IL-17A, IL-21, IL-23, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and free active transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) (Figure 4A). TGF-β1 levels were significantly elevated in tumor-bearing bone marrow supernatants as compared with contralateral non-tumor-bearing samples regardless of whether the mice received ICT or immunoglobulin G (IgG) control (Figures 4A and S5A). Given that TGF-β1 restrains Th1 lineage development (Lin et al., 2005Lin J.T. Martin S.L. Xia L. Gorham J.D. TGF-beta 1 uses distinct mechanisms to inhibit IFN-gamma expression in CD4+ T cells at priming and at recall: differential involvement of Stat4 and T-bet.J.

Th17 polarization also requires the presence of IL-6 (Mangan et al., 2006Mangan P.R. Harrington L.E. O’Quinn D.B. Helms W.S. Bullard D.C. Elson C.O. Hatton R.D. Wahl S.M. Schoeb T.R. Weaver C.T.

However, IL-6 amounts in the bone marrow supernatant were significantly higher than that in the serum, regardless of tumor-bearing status (Figure S5B), which provides a possible explanation for the Th17 lineage polarization observed in the bone tumor microenvironment. Given that IL-6 is an osteogenic cytokine secreted by a variety of cells in the bone marrow, such as stromal cells and osteoblasts (Chiu et al., 1988Chiu C.P. Moulds C. Coffman R.L. Rennick D. Lee F.

In contrast, the TGF-β amounts were increased significantly in the tumor-bearing supernatants but were only slightly higher in the tumor-free supernatants than in the sera (Figure S5C).Figure S5Cytokine Profiles of the Supernatants of Tumor-Bearing, Contralateral Tumor-Free Bone Marrow, Subcutaneous Tumors and Sera, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Levels of the remaining cytokines in the tumor-bearing and contralateral tumor-free supernatants of individual IgG- and ICT-treated mice.

To further evaluate the distinct cytokine environment in the bone tumors, we established a dual subcutaneous and intraosseous prostate tumor model and profiled 13 cytokines in the sera and supernatants from soft-tissue and bone tumors (Figures 4B and S5D). TGF-β1 and IL-6 amounts in the osseous environment were significantly higher than in the non-osseous environment (Figure 4B). These findings indicate that high TGF-β1 amounts is a distinct cytokine in bone CRPC that might act to restrain Th1 polarization. The presence of TGF-β1 and IL-6 might expand CD4 T cells toward a Th17 lineage as opposed to a Th1 lineage in the osseous tumor microenvironment. Although previous studies have reported that prostate tumors can secrete TGF-β1, the significant increase observed in the tumor microenvironment (Figure 4A) indicates an additional source in bone CRPC. Given that tumor metastases to the bone is often accompanied by abnormal bone remodeling (Figure S6A) and the bone matrix is a major reservoir of TGF-β1, we hypothesized that remodeling of the bone matrix is responsible for the aberrantly high TGF-β1 amounts in bone CRPC. To test this hypothesis, we compared the extent of mineralization and the osteoblastic and osteoclastic activities in the tumor-bearing and contralateral tumor-free femur sections by using Von Kossa, toluidine blue, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. The tumor-free femur consisted of well-organized cancellous and cortical bone tissues with clear lamellar structure, indicating a functional balance between the osteoblasts and osteoclasts. In contrast, this balance was disrupted in tumor-bearing bones, which showed atrophy of the distal epiphysis and growth plate, as well as areas of unorganized woven matrix. The tumor-bearing bones consisted of highly proliferative TRAP+ multinucleated osteoclasts and metastasized tumor cells (Figure S6B). Therefore, tumors in the bone triggers osteoclast activation, which significantly erodes the residual bone surface, resulting in extensive bone resorption. To substantiate that osteoclast-induced bone resorption releases excessive amounts of TGF-β1 into the tumor microenvironment, we inhibited the osteoclasts in the tumor-bearing bone by blocking receptor activator of nuclear factor κ-Β ligand (RANKL), a key factor regulating osteoclast differenti"

Unraveling patterns of diversity across macroclimatic gradients, such as the latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG), is a way to anticipate the effects of climate change (Algar et al., 2009Algar A.C.

Eriksson O. et al.Latitudinal gradients as natural laboratories to infer species’ responses to temperature.J. Ecol. 2013; 101: 784-795Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The LDG, historically studied principally in terrestrial macroorganisms, usually consists of a monotonic poleward decline of local diversity (known as alpha diversity; Whittaker, 1972Whittaker R.H. Evolution and measurement of species diversity.Taxon. 1972; 21: 213-251Crossref Google Scholar) for both terrestrial and aquatic organisms (Hillebrand, 2004Hillebrand H. On the generality of the latitudinal diversity gradient.Am. Nat. 2004; 163: 192-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). The LDG is hypothesized to result from a range of non-exclusive ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that operate at multiple spatial and temporal scales (Clarke and Gaston, 2006Clarke A. Gaston K.J. Climate, energy and diversity.Proc. Biol. Sci. 2006; 273: 2257-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, Pontarp et al., 2019Pontarp M. Bunnefeld L. Cabral J.S. Etienne R.S.

Latitudinal gradients of biodiversity: pattern, process, scale, and synthesis.Annu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst. 2003; 34: 273-309Crossref Google Scholar). Among the mechanisms classically invoked, temperature is often thought to be one of the major drivers through two effects. The “physiological tolerance hypothesis” posits that temperature structures the LDG by imposing abiotic constraints on species distribution range (Currie et al., 2004Currie D.J. Mittelbach G.G. Cornell H.V. Field R. Guegan J.-F. Hawkins B.A. Kaufman D.M. Kerr J.T. Oberdorff T. O’Brien E. et al.Predictions and tests of climate-based hypotheses of broad-scale variation in taxonomic richness.Ecol. Lett. 2004; 7: 1121-1134Crossref Scopus (704) Google Scholar), with fewer species tolerating cold conditions and tropical temperatures being generally below the upper thermal tolerance limit of most organisms. The “kinetic energy hypothesis” relates to the metabolic theory (reviewed in Brown, 2014Brown J.H. Why are there so many species in the tropics?.J. Biogeogr. 2014; 41: 8-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), which posits that higher temperatures increase the rate of metabolic reactions, resulting in shorter generation times, faster ecological or physiological processes, and, ultimately, higher mutation and speciation rates, leading to higher local diversity. Beyond temperature, the “productivity/resources hypothesis” posits that greater resource availability and/or primary production in tropical terrestrial areas can support larger population sizes and limit local extinction, promoting species coexistence (reviewed in Clarke and Gaston, 2006Clarke A. Gaston K.J. Climate, energy and diversity.Proc. Biol. Sci. 2006; 273: 2257-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The “environmental stability hypothesis” asserts that short- to long-term environmental instability in extratropical latitudes should cause greater local extinction rates because life in such unstable environments requires particular and costly physiological adaptations, which would ultimately preclude speciation (Clarke and Gaston, 2006Clarke A. Gaston K.J. Climate, energy and diversity.Proc. Biol. Sci. 2006; 273: 2257-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The LDG has also been explained by stronger biotic interactions in the tropics because of higher energy availability, which would increase diversity through complexification and specialization of trophic, mutualistic, or parasitic interactions (reviewed in Willig et al., 2003Willig M.R. Kaufman D.M. Stevens R.D. Latitudinal gradients of biodiversity: pattern, process, scale, and synthesis.Annu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst. 2003; 34: 273-309Crossref Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis has found little support in the literature (Hillebrand, 2004Hillebrand H. On the generality of the latitudinal diversity gradient.Am. Nat. 2004; 163: 192-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar) and further relies on the mechanisms exposed above. In contrast, current knowledge regarding the global trends and drivers of oceanic plankton diversity, ranging from viruses to microbes and zooplankton, remains highly fragmentary. It is mainly based on meta-analyses, which are sensitive to heterogeneous datasets (Brown et al., 2016Brown C.J. O’Connor M.I. Poloczanska E.S. Schoeman D.S. Buckley L.B. Burrows M.T. Duarte C.M.

Change Biol. 2016; 22: 1548-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and do not systematically capture the diversity of dominant planktonic groups. Therefore, the form of the LDG remains equivocal for marine bacteria, copepods, and diatoms, whose diversity has been reported to either decline linearly poleward (Fuhrman et al., 2008Fuhrman J.A.

Virus LDGs have been described only recently and seem to exhibit an increase in diversity in the Arctic Ocean (Gregory et al., 2019Gregory A. Zayed A. Conceição-Neto N. Temperton B. Bolduc B.

Consequently, the extent to which the abovementioned hypotheses apply to the world of marine plankton remains unclear. For example, marine plankton are expected to have huge population sizes, high dispersal abilities, short life cycles, and dormancy stages that would prevent local extinctions and reduce speciation rates. The peak of diversity in temperate to high latitudes has also been suggested to support the productivity/resource hypothesis (Ladau et al., 2013Ladau J. Sharpton T.J. Finucane M.M. Jospin G. Kembel S.W. O’Dwyer J. Koeppel A.F. Green J.L. Pollard K.S.

Randerson J.T. Falkowski P. Primary production of the biosphere: integrating terrestrial and oceanic components.Science. 1998; 281: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (2590) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the environmental stability hypothesis is expected to highly constrain marine plankton at high latitudes, which experience strong seasonality in temperature, nutrients, and light, as suggested for phytoplankton (Behrenfeld et al., 2015Behrenfeld M.J. O’Malley R.T. Boss E.S. Westberry T.K. Graff J.R. Halsey K.H. Milligan A.J. Siegel D.A. Brown M.B. Revaluating ocean warming impacts on global phytoplankton.Nat. Clim.

Global pattern of phytoplankton diversity driven by temperature and environmental variability.Sci. Adv. 2019; 5 (eaau6253)Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). These constraints may also cascade across trophic levels, as suggested for copepods (e.g., Rombouts et al., 2009Rombouts I. Beaugrand G. Ibanez F. Gasparini S. Chiba S. Legendre L. Global latitudinal variations in marine copepod diversity and environmental factors.Proc. Biol. Sci. 2009; 276: 3053-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). All of these uncertainties seriously hamper our ability to understand the drivers of these essential components of marine ecosystems and estimate their potential responses in a changing ocean. Here we provide a unified view of plankton LDGs using systematically collected data from the Tara Oceans global expedition. We combine DNA sequencing of filtered seawater and imaging of net catches to study the diversity in molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) and morphotype diversity of major groups from all domains of life as well as both small and large double-stranded DNA viruses (Karsenti et al., 2011Karsenti E. Acinas S.G. Bork P. Bowler C. De Vargas C. Raes J. Sullivan M. Arendt D. Benzoni F. Claverie J.-M. et al.Tara Oceans ConsortiumA holistic approach to marine eco-systems biology.PLoS Biol. 2011; 9: e1001177Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We then separately examine their respective LDGs while determining their best environmental correlates because they may be influenced by different drivers. Finally, to identify the regions that may experience the most drastic changes in plankton diversity in the future, we model the trends of plankton diversity at the global scale for the beginning (years 1996–2005) and end of the century (years 2090–2099, representative concentration pathway [RCP] 8.5). In this study, we used a wide collection of uniformly collected datasets with broad latitudinal coverage to explore the local diversity trends of all organismal groups that make up plankton communities (Table S1A). Besides already publicly available resources from Tara Oceans, we included newly released metabarcoding data of the V9 region of the 18S rRNA gene and flow cytometry (FC) abundances from the Arctic Ocean. We further complemented these observations with new global-scale datasets obtained with amplicon sequencing, microscopy, and imaging techniques. Our datasets were derived from 189 sampling stations distributed worldwide (Figure S1; STAR Methods), where multiple water depths were sampled (surface, 5 m average depth; deep chlorophyll maximum, 17–188 m; mesopelagic, 200–1000 m). This extensive and standardized sampling of plankton diversity encompasses large gradients in temperature, resource/primary production, and environmental stability (Figure 1A). Using the taxonomic information retrieved from genomics and imaging data (Table S1A), we distinguished 12 marine plankton groups (MPGs; Figures 1B, S1A, and S2; Table S1B; STAR Methods) with different trophic modes (e.g., photosynthetic/mixotrophs versus non-photosynthetic/heterotrophs) and different life history strategies (e.g., parasitic protists, endophytosymbionts) or corresponding to highly dominant taxa having a significant contribution to the marine food web (e.g., copepods).Figure S1Tara Oceans Stations and Shannon Diversity Patterns, Related to Figures 1 and 2Show full caption(A) MPGs at the sea surface (< 5 m depth), (B) whole planktonic community using different sampling protocols at the sea surface (except for “Imaging,” integrative depth from 500 m depth to the surface) and (C) whole planktonic community of the mesopelagic realm (200-1000 m depth).

The LDG of each MPG was studied using the Shannon index, a diversity index that relates monotonically to species richness but differs in that it downweighs rare species, whose numbers are highly sensitive to undersampling and molecular artifacts (Figure S3; STAR Methods). Focusing on surface waters first, we found that phyto-, bacterio-, and zooplankton MPGs all exhibited maximal MOTU diversity in tropical to subtropical regions that then decreased poleward (Figure 2A; see also Figure S4 for individualized curves for each MPG as well as specific taxonomic groups). Similar trends were found for parasites of eukaryotes (giruses and parasitic protists mainly composed of marine alveolates [MALVs]) and for eukaryotic photosynthetic intracellular symbionts (endophotosymbionts) as well as their eukaryotic hosts (photohosts). Different patterns emerged for two abundant families of prokaryotic viruses (Myoviridae and Podoviridae) which, unlike their hosts, did not exhibit a clear poleward decline in diversity. Because the diversity of hosts and their symbionts or parasites is often assumed to be linked through eco-evolutionary interactions (Morand, 2015Morand S. (macro-) Evolutionary ecology of parasite diversity: From determinants of parasite species richness to host diversification.Int. J. Parasitol. Parasites Wildl. 2015; 4: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), an explanation for this could be that these virus families have a broader spectrum of host species, which could potentially decouple certain eco-evolutionary constraints (de Jonge et al., 2019de Jonge P.A.

However, other factors may be responsible for this trend as well, such as nutrient availability or bacterial cell density (Gregory et al., 2019Gregory A. Zayed A. Conceição-Neto N. Temperton B.

The vagus nerve innervates the gut and can detect diverse interoceptive cues, but the identity of the key sensory neurons and corresponding signals that regulate food intake remains unknown. Here, we use an approach for target-specific, single-cell RNA sequencing to generate a map of the vagal cell types that innervate the gastrointestinal tract. We show that unique molecular markers identify vagal neurons with distinct innervation patterns, sensory endings, and function. Surprisingly, we find that food intake is most sensitive to stimulation of mechanoreceptors in the intestine, whereas nutrient-activated mucosal afferents have no effect. Peripheral manipulations combined with central recordings reveal that intestinal mechanoreceptors, but not other cell types, potently and durably inhibit hunger-promoting AgRP neurons in the hypothalamus. These findings identify a key role for intestinal mechanoreceptors in the regulation of feeding."

Despite recent advances in understanding their taxonomic and genomic compositions, little is known about how their transcriptomes vary globally. Here, we present a dataset of 187 metatranscriptomes and 370 metagenomes from 126 globally distributed sampling stations and establish a resource of 47 million genes to study community-level transcriptomes across depth layers from pole-to-pole. We examine gene expression changes and community turnover as the underlying mechanisms shaping community transcriptomes along these axes of environmental variation and show how their individual contributions differ for multiple biogeochemically relevant processes. Furthermore, we find the relative contribution of gene expression changes to be significantly lower in polar than in non-polar waters and hypothesize that in polar regions, alterations in community activity in response to ocean warming will be driven more strongly by changes in organismal composition than by gene regulatory mechanisms.

https://openalex.org/W2985155561,"Accurate measurement of clonal genotypes, mutational processes, and replication states from individual tumor-cell genomes will facilitate improved understanding of tumor evolution. We have developed DLP+, a scalable single-cell whole-genome sequencing platform implemented using commodity instruments, image-based object recognition, and open source computational methods. Using DLP+, we have generated a resource of 51,926 single-cell genomes and matched cell images from diverse cell types including cell lines, xenografts, and diagnostic samples with limited material. From this resource we have defined variation in mitotic mis-segregation rates across tissue types and genotypes. Analysis of matched genomic and image measurements revealed correlations between cellular morphology and genome ploidy states. Aggregation of cells sharing copy number profiles allowed for calculation of single-nucleotide resolution clonal genotypes and inference of clonal phylogenies and avoided the limitations of bulk deconvolution. Finally, joint analysis over the above features defined clone-specific chromosomal aneuploidy in polyclonal populations."

Here, we report single-cell clustering, immune phenotyping, and risk gene analysis for children with undifferentiated colitis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. We demonstrate disease-specific characteristics, as well as common pathogenesis marked by impaired cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response signaling. Specifically, infiltration of PDE4B- and TNF-expressing macrophages, decreased abundance of CD39-expressing intraepithelial T cells, and platelet aggregation and release of 5-hydroxytryptamine at the colonic mucosae were common in colitis and IBD patients. Targeting these pathways by using the phosphodiesterase inhibitor dipyridamole restored immune homeostasis and improved colitis symptoms in a pilot study. In summary, comprehensive analysis of the colonic mucosae has uncovered common pathogenesis and therapeutic targets for children with colitis and IBD."

Together, our integrative method and spectroscopic experiments pave the way to first-principles modeling of whole living cells. Living cells are brimming with the activity of hundreds of macromolecular complexes fulfilling their biological functions. Housed within subcellular compartments, so-called cell organelles, these complexes form an intricate circuitry of physicochemical reactions, giving rise to biological properties such as growth, adaptation to environmental change, and co-accommodation of competing functions. A physical model of the emergence of phenotypic properties from detailed atomistic interactions is expected to offer direct insights into the rules of life (Camargo, 2018Camargo C. Physics makes rules, evolution rolls the dice.Science. 2018; 361: 236Crossref Google Scholar). However, atomic-level investigations of cellular processes have so far been impeded by the sheer complexity of the network of interactions, the timescales of the cell cycle, and the lack of essential experimental information (Goh et al., 2016Goh B.C. Hadden J.A. Bernardi R.C. Singharoy A. McGreevy R. Rudack T. Cassidy C.K. Schulten K. Computational methodologies for real-space structural refinement of large macromolecular complexes.Annu. Rev.

Sub-diffraction-limit imaging by stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM).Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 793-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5635) Google Scholar) and cryo-electron microscopy (Cheng, 2015Cheng Y. Single-particle cryo-EM at crystallographic resolution.Cell. 2015; 161: 450-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), the atomic structures of many protein complexes are now experimentally accessible. However, structures alone provide limited information about the function of these complexes, in particular how they interact with each other in large-scale networks. Bioinformatics and systems biology approaches integrating libraries of existing experimental data have attempted to predict phenotypes from genotypes (Karr et al., 2012Karr J.R. Sanghvi J.C. Macklin D.N. Gutschow M.V. Jacobs J.M. Bolival Jr., B. Assad-Garcia N. Glass J.I. Covert M.W. A whole-cell computational model predicts phenotype from genotype.Cell. 2012; 150: 389-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). The resulting models, however, can be plagued by false positives, often originating from experimental errors or mathematical heuristics (Korte and Farlow, 2013Korte A. Farlow A. The advantages and limitations of trait analysis with GWAS: a review.Plant Methods. 2013; 9: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Cell-scale models conceived from first principles can resolve the physical and chemical events that underlie the emergent phenotypes and ultimately render a comprehensive picture of the cellular machinery in action. Here, we employ an array of physics-based approaches to decipher the functional circuitry of a bacterial energy-harvesting organelle, the chromatophore (Allen, 2017Allen J.P. Design of energy-transducing artificial cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114: 3790-3791Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, Blankenship, 2014Blankenship R.E. Molecular Mechanisms of Photosynthesis.Second Edition. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2014Google Scholar). With hundreds of proteins embedded in a vesicular membrane (Figure 1), the chromatophore from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (Rba. sphaeroides) absorbs sunlight to produce ATP. We explore, in atomistic detail, the pathways of energy metabolism within chromatophore vesicles to determine how light-specific phenotypes of purple bacteria emerge from the collective action of proteins. Our simulations identify the mechanisms that bioenergetic protein networks commonly exploit to minimize energy dissipation, recover from environmental stresses, and avoid apoptosis. More broadly, we elucidate how the physicochemical reactions within a membrane-based cellular organelle are wired to preserve the delicate balance between structural integrity, robust energy conversion, and cellular growth. The bacterial chromatophore converts light into ATP in a multi-step process (Figure 1A; Video S1). First, light is absorbed by the LH2 and LH1 light-harvesting complexes, and then the energy migrates to the reaction center (RC), where charge separation by electron transfer occurs. The outcome is a reduced quinone (quinol) that leaves the RC and diffuses to the cytochrome bc1 (bc1) complex, where a proton-motive force is generated for the synthesis of ATP. Abstraction of an electron from bc1 by cytochrome c2 (cyt c2), and docking of this reduced cyt c2 fills the electron hole in the RC and resets the system for another charge separation. We have developed several first-principle models that reflect the complexity of these coupled energy-conversion processes and link the microscopic configuration of the proteins within the chromatophore membrane to the rate of ATP synthesis and, hence, to the phenotype of the bacterium. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI5M2JhYWRkZmQ3ZGU2ZTM4NWYyZGJiZjQyOTdmZTc4ZSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc3NzI4ODM3fQ.HmT-kDiDVKe20aKkQPaQNN7-EfDpd4uo-kLvnUcywERvHKavMqyyj4GK3UC_ehixfAxLEMKqQutTFYSe3RQCoVG76-YTCxrxKG-SV1EifmvJASd6Hn6EKm-bGVbykqS7neC-HIz7O81rDMJyPehGhYapc1_2dSN15ykMQYhGJ16Dt5ytu_Wk3LU9zx0jppHIoSH9hRFAF97ISpDNy8VbhQ4wrcxQ5UnYYgyHjcORECzspJYARBUpUSkzBglTPcOmqv_8YtUO3hrIuG_3rPhOVvjA1vSXojxocnZXiRKYIoxc_Qp1PBTxenRWLUa_zcd7hxU8xSW5yJGp4-hr5ZPKQg Download .mp4 (16.47 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1. Summary of All Processes Involved in Energy Conversion in the Photosynthetic Chromatophore, Related to Figure 1Energy conversion processes starting after initial light absorption are divided into three stages: (1) quinol production at RC as a result of excitation transfer; (2) diffusion between RC and cytbc1 of quinone/ quinol and cyt c2, together with quinol-to-quinone conversion resulting in a proton gradient across the vesicle membrane; (3) utilization of proton gradient for ATP synthesis An atomistic model of the Rba. sphaeroides chromatophore is composed of proteins, lipids, cofactors, and charge carriers immersed in water and ions.

In addition, 600 quinone (ubiquinone-10) charge carriers were uniformly placed within the membrane, and another 300 were placed in the vicinity of the bc1 and RC-LH1 complexes (Sener et al., 2016Sener M.

The initial all-atom model of the chromatophore was simulated by all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) (Karplus and Petsko, 1990Karplus M. Development of Multiscale Models for Complex Chemical Systems: From H+H2 to Biomolecules (Nobel Lecture).Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2014; 53: 9992-10005Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) for more than half a microsecond (Table 1 and Figures S1). The simulation revealed changes in local curvature and composition of the lipid membrane surrounding the proteins, and characterized dynamics of quinone molecules in the membrane. The resulting molecular configurations were used to determine the effect of membrane disorder on light absorption as well as to elucidate the principles of directional charge transport within the vesicle. Rates of individual processes were integrated into a kinetic model of ATP synthesis. This integrated model captures the emergence of light-adaptation phenotypes in purple bacteria starting from all-atom details. Further details regarding the pros and cons of our model are provided in Method Details.Table 1Table Summarizing All Simulations Employed in the Current StudySimulation TypeSimulation SystemSystem SizeNumber of RunsSimulation LengthCumulative TimeMDchromatophore vesicle136 M10.5 μs0.5 μsZNDO/S-CIS63 LH2 rings (vesicle)63 × 1M200 snapshots50 ps10 nsZNDO/S-CIS1 LH2 rings (flat)0.2 M10,000 snapshots1 ps10 nsMARTINI1 bc1 complex0.06 M140 μs40 μsBD500 copies of cyt. c2N/A610 μs30 ms5,000 quinone moleculesN/A12.8 ms2.8 msBias exchange umbrella sampling1 × bc1ox-c2red0.5 M34 windows100 ns3.4 μs1 × bc1red-c2ox0.5 M34 windows100 ns3.4 μs1 × RCox-c2red0.5 M34 windows100 ns3.4 μs1 × RCred-c2ox0.5 M34 windows100 ns3.4 μs1 × bc1ox-c2red (20 mM)0.5 M34 windows100 ns3.4 μs Open table in a new tab Analysis of the MD trajectory shows protein-driven heterogeneity in membrane curvature and its impact on energy transfer processes. The shape of a chromatophore departs from that of an ideal sphere, displaying distinct protein-sculpted features on the surface (Figure 2). Specifically, the local curvature in the vicinity of the LH1 dimers or of hexagonally packed LH2 complexes is closed (convex), with a radius of 200–250 Å, whereas curvature in the vicinity of the bc1 complex is flatter, with a radius of 400–500 Å (Figures 2A and 2B). A 40-μs coarse-grained MD simulation (Marrink et al., 2007Marrink S.J. Risselada H.J. Yefimov S. Tieleman D.P. de Vries A.H. The MARTINI force field: coarse grained model for biomolecular simulations.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2007; 111: 7812-7824Crossref PubMed Scopus (3785) Google Scholar) confirmed the curvature modulations observed in the 0.5-μs all-atom MD simulation (Figure 2C), reinforcing our conclusion that the shape of bc1 dimers is compatible with that of a planar membrane. Differences in membrane curvature near the LH1, LH2, and bc1 complexes (Figures 2D and 2E) are a manifestation of the uneven hydrogen bonds they form with the lipid head groups on the cytoplasmic and periplasmic sides of the membrane bilayer (Figures S2A–S2C). The RC-LH1 dimers and hexagonally packed LH2 complexes form 3- to 4-fold more hydrogen bonds on the cytoplasmic side of the chromatophore than on the periplasmic side, introducing curvature in the membrane (Olsen et al., 2008Olsen J.D. Tucker J.D. Timney J.A. Qian P. Vassilev C. Hunter C.N. The organization of LH2 complexes in membranes from Rhodobacter sphaeroides.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30772-30779Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, hydrogen bond mismatch is minimal for bc1 complexes, eliciting a flatter topography in their vicinity. This protein-induced reshaping of the chromatophore membrane (Figure 2E) supports the hypothesis of segregation of bc1 from LH1 and LH2 derived from AFM experiments (Cartron et al., 2014Cartron M.L.

J. 2008; 95: 2822-2836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), whereas those agnostic to curvature (bc1) are sequestered within isolated domains that become locally flat. Thus, deviation of the membrane from an ideal sphere (Noble et al., 2018Noble J.M. Lubieniecki J. Savitzky B.H. Plitzko J. Engelhardt H. Baumeister W. Kourkoutis L.F. Connectivity of centermost chromatophores in Rhodobacter sphaeroides bacteria.Mol. Microbiol. 2018; 109: 812-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) allows co-localization of groups of proteins into neighborhoods with distinct curvature-dependent functions. The hydrogen bonding pattern in bc1 induces such local curvature differences, supporting organelle budding. To elucidate the effect of membrane disorder and local curvature on light absorption by LH2, large-scale QM/MM computations were performed. The ZINDO/S-CIS level of theory was used with atomic models extracted from the all-atom MD simulations. These simulations showed that the light-absorbing rings of LH2 B800 bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) deviate from their crystallographic orientations by tilt angles ranging from 0° to 30° about the transition-dipole axis (Figures 3A and 3B ). Such a reorientation of the B800 rings within the chromatophore has been implicated in the enhancement of the energy transfer rate from the B800 to B850 BChls (Ogren et al., 2018Ogren J.I. Tong A.L. Gordon S.C. Chenu A. Lu Y. Blankenship R.E. Cao J. Schlau-Cohen G.S. Impact of the lipid bilayer on energy transfer kinetics in the photosynthetic protein LH2.Chem. Sci. (Camb.). 2018; 9: 3095-3104Crossref Google Scholar). The QM/MM computations indicate a selective broadening of the B800 absorption band relative to B850 (Figures 3C and S2) as well as a wider distribution of the ring-averaged excitation energies. The 10-meV width of the excitation energy distribution (Figure S3) is similar to values of 7.4 and 9.4 meV previously extracted from pump-probe experiments (Stross et al., 2016Stross C. Van der Kamp M.W. Oliver T.A.A. Harvey J.N. Linden N. Manby F.R. How static disorder mimics decoherence in anisotropy pump-probe experiments on purple-bacteria light harvesting complexes.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2016; 120: 11449-11463Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Our simulation identifies two factors that influence reorientation and spectral broadening of B800. First, curvature-specific rearrangement of the N-terminal domains of LH2 at the protein-lipid interface reorients the B800 pigments to unique conformations observed only in the chromatophore (Figure 3D). Second, the lipid tails in the local environment of B800 are 1.25- to 2-fold more disordered than those in a flat membrane (Figures S3B–S3F; Yesylevskyy et al., 2017Yesylevskyy S.O. Rivel T. Ramseyer C. The influence of curvature on the properties of the plasma membrane. Insights from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 16078Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which allows fluctuation in the orientation of B800 pigments and consequent broadening of inter-pigment couplings. In contrast, the B850 rings are minimally exposed to the lipid tails, and little line broadening is observed. Altogether, the selective reorientation of pigments and broadening of their absorption spectrum accentuate the role of the lipid environment in modulating light absorption by the chromatophore.Figure S3Influence of Environment on the Average Excitation Energies of the BChl Molecules and Lipid Order Parameters (OPs), Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Distributions of the average excitation energies for the different rings.

Charge-carrier quinone molecules transfer energy between the protein complexes of the chromatophore by shuttling electrons from RC-LH1 to bc1 (Figure 1A). The energy conversion efficiency of the entire network therefore is expected to depend on the diffusion and binding dynamics of the quinone (Sener et al., 2016Sener M. Strumpfer J. Singharoy A. Hunter C.N. Schulten K. Overall energy conversion efficiency of a photosynthetic vesicle.eLife. 2016; 5: e09541Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These charge-transfer processes were simulated with atomistic detail to probe the rate-determining step of energy conversion from sunlight intake to ATP output. Analysis of the diffusion of 900 quinone molecules in the chromatophore shows two distinct types of motion the quinones perform within a membrane: swimming and diving Figure 4A. The probability of finding a quinone at different depths of the membrane was monitored using potential of mean force (PMF) calculations (Method Details: Umbrella Sampling Simulations). These calculations indicate that the dione head groups of swimming quinones are located within the plane of the lipid head groups, whereas those of diving quinones are found near the membrane midplane (Figure 4B). The calculated diffusion coefficient of the swimming quinones (7.7 × 10−8 cm2 s−1) is comparable to that of bulk lipids. In contrast, the diving quinones diffuse at least three times faster (2.1 × 10−7 cm2 s−1) (Figure S4A). Although both values are well within the 10−6-10−8 cm2 s−1 range of measured quinone diffusivities (Di Bernardo et al., 1998Di Bernardo S. Fato R. Casadio R. Fariselli P. Lenaz G. A high diffusion coefficient for coenzyme Q10 might be related to a folded structure.FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), our computations clearly distinguish between the two distinct diffusion mechanisms that collectively contribute to this apparently wide range of experimental values. Employing the PMF of Figure 4B and integrating the two modes of quinone dynamics into a spatially dependent diffusion map (Method Details: BD Simulations), Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations (Ermak and Mccammon, 1978Ermak D.L. Mccammon J.A. Brownian dynamics with hydrodynamic interactions.J. Chem. Phys. 1978; 69: 1352-1360Crossref Scopus (2038) Google Scholar) were performed to measure the rate of diffusive quinone transport within the chromatophore. These computations yielded a mean first passage time of 101 μs for the quinone movement between the RC-LH1 and bc1 complexes (Figure S4).Figure S4Swimming versus Diving Quinone, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Mean square displacement (MSD) of the swimming (black) and diving (orange) quinone molecules.

The second panel depicts the time required for a quinone that had moved at least 16 Å from its initial location to return to within 8 Å of its location (average 68 μs). As shown in the inset, nearly half of the quinone molecules returned to their initial location within just a few microseconds. The rightmost panel depicts the time required for a quinone molecule to reach an 8-Å-radius target on the opposite side of the chromatophore (average 101 μs).

https://openalex.org/W2985065511,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with a spectrum of human conditions, ranging from rare, inborn errors of metabolism to the aging process. To identify pathways that modify mitochondrial dysfunction, we performed genome-wide CRISPR screens in the presence of small-molecule mitochondrial inhibitors. We report a compendium of chemical-genetic interactions involving 191 distinct genetic modifiers, including 38 that are synthetic sick/lethal and 63 that are suppressors. Genes involved in glycolysis (PFKP), pentose phosphate pathway (G6PD), and defense against lipid peroxidation (GPX4) scored high as synthetic sick/lethal. A surprisingly large fraction of suppressors are pathway intrinsic and encode mitochondrial proteins. A striking example of such ""intra-organelle"" buffering is the alleviation of a chemical defect in complex V by simultaneous inhibition of complex I, which benefits cells by rebalancing redox cofactors, increasing reductive carboxylation, and promoting glycolysis. Perhaps paradoxically, certain forms of mitochondrial dysfunction may best be buffered with ""second site"" inhibitors to the organelle."

Malaria, caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium, remains a disease of major significance to global public health. Despite increased attention and funding, malaria still kills about half a million people each year, and the combination of drug and insecticide resistance slows down progress against this deadly disease (World Health Organization, 2018World Health OrganizationWorld Malaria Report 2018. World Health Organization, 2018Crossref Google Scholar). Infection with Plasmodium parasites occurs through the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes, which inject motile sporozoites when feeding on blood. A proportion of them reaches and successfully invades hepatocytes. Over the course of two to five days, depending on the Plasmodium species, the parasite increases dramatically in size and eventually gives rise to thousands of daughter merozoites. With this immense and rapid expansion, parasites need to be highly metabolically active, despite their dependence on the host cell for nutrient acquisition. The merozoites are released into the bloodstream, where they invade red blood cells and undergo repeated rounds of asexual replication, each round culminating in the release of further invasive merozoites. It is the blood phase of the parasite life cycle that leads to the symptoms of malaria and, in the case of Plasmodium falciparum, can cause fatal disease (reviewed in Cowman et al., 2016Cowman A.F. Healer J. Marapana D. Marsh K. Malaria: biology and disease.Cell. 2016; 167: 610-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Rather than undergo asexual replication, some merozoites will instead differentiate into sexual stages of the parasite, the male and female gametocytes. Upon uptake by susceptible mosquitoes, these gametocytes are activated to form gametes and following fertilization and escape from the mosquito midgut, the parasite encysts between the epithelial midgut wall and the basal lamina. Within the oocyst, thousands of motile sporozoites are produced over the course of 7 to 10 days in a process known as sporogony. Motile sporozoites are liberated into the haemocoel of the mosquito and eventually accumulate in the salivary glands, where they await injection into a new mammalian host. For many years, the primary focus of malaria research has been the pathogenic blood stages, and all but two of the commercially available antimalarial drugs primarily target blood-stage infection. While this has been an effective strategy, P. falciparum has repeatedly and rapidly developed resistance to all available blood-stage drugs, including the current frontline antimalarial, artemisinin (Blasco et al., 2017Blasco B. Leroy D. Fidock D.A. Antimalarial drug resistance: linking Plasmodium falciparum parasite biology to the clinic.Nat. Med. 2017; 23: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). New drugs are urgently required. Targeting the pre-erythrocytic stage of the parasite has the considerable advantage that successful drug treatment would prevent any clinical disease symptoms and could also be used to clear dormant liver stages of the Plasmodium vivax parasite, which can re-activate to establish blood-stage infection many years after the original mosquito bite (Campo et al., 2015Campo B. Vandal O. Wesche D.L. Burrows J.N. Killing the hypnozoite--drug discovery approaches to prevent relapse in Plasmodium vivax.Pathog. Glob. Health. 2015; 109: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A recent screen has begun to identify dozens of candidate compounds that target the liver stage, some with great specificity (Antonova-Koch et al., 2018Antonova-Koch Y. Meister S. Abraham M. Luth M.R. Ottilie S. Lukens A.K. Sakata-Kato T. Vanaerschot M. Owen E. Jado J.C. et al.Open-source discovery of chemical leads for next-generation chemoprotective antimalarials.Science. 2018; 362 (eaat9446)Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, difficult experimental models and the limited nature of our understanding of liver stage metabolism now pose major challenges for identifying their modes of action. The high metabolic activity that enables parasites to expand rapidly from a single sporozoite to tens of thousands of daughter merozoites presents a major vulnerability. Metabolic differences between pre-erythrocytic Plasmodium and their human host cells are known to exist (Shears et al., 2015Shears M.J. Botté C.Y. McFadden G.I. Fatty acid metabolism in the Plasmodium apicoplast: Drugs, doubts and knockouts.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2015; 199: 34-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and could in theory be exploited for drug development, but there are currently significant gaps in our understanding of liver-stage metabolism. Identifying genes with key roles in liver stage development that are potential drug targets requires the scaling up of experimental genetics and subsequent phenotyping during this poorly accessible stage. In P. berghei, a resource of >2,900 individually barcoded gene knockout vectors is now available (https://plasmogem.sanger.ac.uk/). These vectors integrate efficiently into the genome due to their long homology arms (Pfander et al., 2011Pfander C. Anar B. Schwach F. Otto T.D. Brochet M. Volkmann K. Quail M.A. Pain A. Rosen B. Skarnes W. Rayner J.C. Billker O. A scalable pipeline for highly effective genetic modification of a malaria parasite.Nat Methods. 2011; 8: 1078-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and in our experience are not maintained episomally, such that detection of a barcode after drug selection is highly indicative of the presence of a specific knockout mutant in the selected parasite populations (Gomes et al., 2015Gomes A.R.R. Bushell E. Schwach F. Girling G. Anar B. Quail M.A.A. Herd C. Pfander C. Modrzynska K. Rayner J.C.C. Billker O. A genome-scale vector resource enables high-throughput reverse genetic screening in a malaria parasite.Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 17: 404-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Using barcode counting on a next-generation sequencer (barseq), we previously determined growth-rate phenotypes for the generated knockout mutants specifically during the asexual blood stages, identifying >1,360 non-essential genes from more than 2,500 screened genes (Bushell et al., 2017Bushell E. Gomes A.R. Sanderson T. Anar B. Girling G. Herd C. Metcalf T. Modrzynska K. Schwach F. Martin R.E. et al.Functional profiling of a Plasmodium genome reveals an abundance of essential genes.Cell. 2017; 170: 260-272.e8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In this study, we generated pools of these blood-stage-viable knockout mutants and analyzed their phenotypes throughout the entire parasite life cycle for the first time. Using barcode sequencing, we measured changes in the relative abundance of knockout mutants in midgut oocysts, salivary gland sporozoites, and in mice following injection of sporozoites, revealing stage-specific functions for 461 genes, including transcription factors, structural proteins, and enzymes. We combined the data of the genetic screen with a liver-stage transcriptome (Caldelari et al., 2019Caldelari R. Dogga S. Schmid M.W. Franke-Fayard B. Janse C.J. Soldati-Favre D. Heussler V. Transcriptome analysis of Plasmodium berghei during exo-erythrocytic development.Malar. J. 2019; 18: 330Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) to generate a liver-stage metabolic model for P. berghei (iPbe-liver). We used this model to examine the reasons underlying the observed loss-of-function phenotypes and provide new insights into liver-stage physiology, systematically predicting thermodynamic bottlenecks, genetic interactions, and growth-limiting nutrients. To validate hypotheses generated from this model, we produced and analyzed individual knockout mutants for 20 genes and compared their phenotypes with their model-predicted essentiality. Only the asexual blood stages of Plasmodium parasites can be propagated continuously to drug-select for knockout mutants, meaning that only genes that are not required for blood-stage development can be investigated at later stages of the cycle using barseq. Extending barseq phenotyping beyond blood stages faces three potential obstacles: (1) population bottlenecks, (2) changes in ploidy following gamete fusion in the midgut, and (3) segregation of mutant alleles in the oocyst. In a pilot screen, we first tested whether barcoded alleles could be transmitted robustly through the population bottleneck posed by the only approximately 400 oocysts that in our hands form on average on each infected Anopheles stephensi midgut. Using knockout vectors targeting 15 genes with known functions at the liver stage and 19 control and test genes (shown in Table S1), a pool of mutant parasites was generated by transfection and used to infect three mice. Blood samples from each mouse were collected to establish the starting composition of mutants after drug selection (sample B1). 120–150 female mosquitoes were then allowed to feed on each mouse, and midguts (MG) from >30 mosquitoes were dissected 15 days post-infection, followed by salivary gland (SG) collection at day 22 post-infection from at least 60 mosquitoes. Half of these SGs were used to prepare a barseq library to establish the composition of the mutant pool in SG; the other half were used to collect sporozoites to infect another mouse. From this mouse, a blood sample (B2) was taken 5 days after intravenous injection of sporozoites to establish the composition of the mutant pool in B2, allowing assessment of parasite development in the liver (Figure 1A). The relative abundance of gene knockouts in the pilot dataset (Table S1) showed at least a 5-fold drop in relative abundance between SG and B2 specifically for genes known to have a critical role at the liver stage (more than 10-fold for PALM, UIS4, aLipDH, B9, P36, P36P, FabB/F, FabZ, and TRAP; more than 5-fold drop for SLARP, PLP1, and LISP1). An 11-fold drop in relative abundance was additionally seen for one of the individually selected genes in this pilot experiment, LipA, a gene not previously studied at the liver stage, revealing for the first time a potential liver-stage role for this enzyme (Figure 1B; Table S1). Having recapitulated published liver-stage phenotypes, we expanded the screen to cover all PlasmoGEM-targetable genes that are not essential at the asexual blood stage in what is hereafter referred to as the mosquito-stage liver-stage (M-L) screen. To minimize random losses of barcodes through non-representative sampling, the pool size was limited to 60 mutants, and each pool was studied in three independent transmission experiments (Figure 1A). In the absence of suitable control genes known to lack knockout phenotypes at all developmental stages, we normalized the stage-specific conversion efficiency of each mutant to the quartile of most effectively converting mutants in each set. We additionally corrected SG-B2 conversion rates using the known blood-stage growth rate of each mutant (Bushell et al., 2017Bushell E. Gomes A.R. Sanderson T. Anar B. Girling G. Herd C. Metcalf T. Modrzynska K. Schwach F. Martin R.E. et al.Functional profiling of a Plasmodium genome reveals an abundance of essential genes.Cell. 2017; 170: 260-272.e8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) to detect pre-erythrocytic phenotypes more specifically. In total, the screen involved 1,379 vectors, transfected in 27 pools (Table S2). It required dissection of >7,000 mosquitoes and barseq of more than 600 PCR amplicons. To interpret the data from a transmission screen, we considered how changes in ploidy following gamete fusion in the midgut and segregation of mutant alleles in the oocyst (Figure 2A) would affect how knockout alleles are transmitted. Mutants of the transcriptional regulators AP2-G and AP2-G2, are known to lack fertile gametocytes of both sexes (Sinha et al., 2014Sinha A. Hughes K.R. Modrzynska K.K. Otto T.D. Pfander C. Dickens N.J. Religa A.A. Bushell E. Graham A.L. Cameron R. et al.A cascade of DNA-binding proteins for sexual commitment and development in Plasmodium.Nature. 2014; 507: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and in the screen were therefore only poorly transmitted to oocysts (Figure 2B). The same was true for GEST, the gametocyte egress and sporozoite traversal gene (Talman et al., 2011Talman A.M. Lacroix C. Marques S.R. Blagborough A.M. Carzaniga R. Ménard R. Sinden R.E. PbGEST mediates malaria transmission to both mosquito and vertebrate host.Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 82: 462-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which showed both a B1-MG and a SG-B2 phenotype, consistent with its published functions (Figure 2B). In contrast, cross-fertilization between different mutants in the bloodmeal limited the power of the screen to reveal gene functions during the subsequent diploid and polyploid stages (i.e., zygotes, ookinetes, and oocysts). For instance, knockout mutants in which only one sex is sterile (Ning et al., 2013Ning J. Otto T.D. Pfander C. Schwach F. Brochet M. Bushell E. Goulding D. Sanders M. Lefebvre P.A. Pei J. et al.Comparative genomics in Chlamydomonas and Plasmodium identifies an ancient nuclear envelope protein family essential for sexual reproduction in protists, fungi, plants, and vertebrates.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 1198-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, Bennink et al., 2016Bennink S. Kiesow M.J. Pradel G. The development of malaria parasites in the mosquito midgut.Cell. Microbiol. 2016; 18: 905-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) can transmit their barcodes to the oocyst by inheritance through the fertile sex (Figure 2C). As a result, reductions in barcode abundance for these sex-specific knockout mutants often did not reach significance at the B1-MG conversion. Known gene functions in the polyploid ookinete were also generally not recapitulated in the screen, presumably due to heterozygous rescue (Figure 2D). While these observations highlight the need for future screens to be designed specifically to reveal sexual and mosquito-stage phenotypes, they also rationalize how knockout alleles of genes functioning in fertility or ookinete and oocyst development can be transmitted to salivary gland sporozoites to reveal additional gene functions after sporozoite transmission to the vertebrate host. This is illustrated by AP2-O4, a putative transcriptional regulator of oocyst maturation (Modrzynska et al., 2017Modrzynska K. Pfander C. Chappell L. Yu L. Suarez C. Dundas K. Gomes A.R. Goulding D. Rayner J.C. Choudhary J. Billker O. A knockout screen of ApiAP2 genes reveals networks of interacting transcriptional regulators controlling the Plasmodium life cycle.Cell Host Microbe. 2017; 21: 11-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) whose phenotype is rescued in the polyploid oocyst until the SG stage, but then, the haploid knockout sporozoites show an ∼3,000-fold loss during transmission back to mice, revealing a new function for AP2-O4, possibly at the liver stage (Figure 2D; Table S2). Since in Plasmodium all products of meiosis are propagated into the oocyst, which remains functionally heterozygous until alleles segregate at the point of sporogony, it is likely that sporozoites lacking an essential gene can inherit sufficient protein from the oocyst to survive. TRAP (thrombospondin-related adhesive protein), which is required for sporozoite gliding, entry into salivary glands and hepatocyte invasion (Sultan et al., 1997Sultan A.A. Thathy V. Frevert U. Robson K.J. Crisanti A. Nussenzweig V. Nussenzweig R.S. Ménard R. TRAP is necessary for gliding motility and infectivity of plasmodium sporozoites.Cell. 1997; 90: 511-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) might be an example of protein inheritance from heterozygous oocysts to sporozoites. An ∼4-fold reduction in SG sporozoites in our screen (Figure 1B; Table S1) contrasts with a 34-fold reduction in sporozoite numbers of the TRAP gene knockout clone in the previous study, possibly because TRAP protein obtained by the sporozoite from heterozygous oocysts alleviates the phenotype of the knockout. The same phenomenon is unlikely to extend to all sporozoite expressed genes, because once inside the salivary glands, sporozoites reprogram transcription from their now once more haploid genome in preparation for transmission back to the vertebrate host (Mikolajczak et al., 2008Mikolajczak S.A. Silva-Rivera H. Peng X. Tarun A.S. Camargo N. Jacobs-Lorena V. Daly T.M. Bergman L.W. de la Vega P. Williams J. et al.Distinct malaria parasite sporozoites reveal transcriptional changes that cause differential tissue infection competence in the mosquito vector and mammalian host.Mol. Cell.

At this phase of the life cycle, the ability of the screen to reveal phenotypes was therefore predicted to increase, which is confirmed by a comparison of ranked effect sizes, which are much greater for the SG-B2 transition as compared to the MG-SG conversion (Figure 3A). By first approximation, we will assume losses of mutants at the SG-B2 transition to reflect gene functions at the liver stage in the broadest sense, i.e., starting with sporozoite transmigration and invasion of hepatocytes and culminating in the release of merozoites into the bloodstream. A more precise elucidation of gene functions will require analysis of single knockout mutants (see below). Taking a conservative approach to calling phenotypes that takes into account both the effect size and the variance across biological triplicates as illustrated in Figure S1, we find that at each transition, only a small proportion of mutants (9%–18%) are significantly depleted, while for the majority of genes, we can either be confident that they are “not reduced” or the statistical power is considered insufficient to make a clear call (Figure 3B). Of the 1,359 mutants for which data was obtained, 898 showed no significant reduction at any transition. At the B1-MG, MG-SG, and SG-B2 transitions, 251, 129, and 185 mutants, respectively, showed reduced stage conversion (Figure 3B). Statistically robust transmission phenotypes were revealed, regardless of whether mutants were previously found to have normal or slow growth at the asexual blood stage (Figure 3C). The latter does not, therefore, appear to be a major confounder of our ability to detect phenotypes during the rest of the life cycle. Mutants that were reduced strongly (>100-fold) at the SG-B2 transition showed a remarkable enrichment (p < 0.01) for metabolic genes (15 of 31 genes in this category encoded enzymes versus only 4 expected; Table S2). Some of the pathways represented by lost mutants are consistent with the known importance of heme and fatty acid biosynthesis at the liver stage (Shears et al., 2015Shears M.J. Botté C.Y.

By comparison, we did not see liver-stage-specific essentiality for genes with functions in DNA repair, DNA replication, or proteolysis (Figure 3D). With metabolism emerging as a defining feature of the SG-B2 transition, we decided to construct a genome-scale model of P. berghei metabolism to evaluate the screen results systematically in the context of current knowledge. As with our previous general P. falciparum model (iPfa) (Chiappino-Pepe et al., 2017aChiappino-Pepe A. Tymoshenko S. Ataman M. Soldati-Favre D. Hatzimanikatis V. Bioenergetics-based modeling of Plasmodium falciparum metabolism reveals its essential genes, nutritional requirements, and thermodynamic bottlenecks.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2017; 13: e1005397Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we based the in silico P. berghei (iPbe) model on a set of metabolic tasks (Table S3) and on annotated metabolic gene functions (Table S4). We build upon this computational framework through a process we call PhenoMapping (STAR Methods). In a unique decomposition approach, we consider separately different layers of information, such as nutrient availability, gene expression, and gene knockout phenotypes in order to refine the model, for instance, by adding missing enzymatic or transport capabilities (Figure S2A). We initially used asexual blood-stage growth rates of Bushell et al., 2017Bushell E. Gomes A.R. Sanderson T. Anar B. Girling G. Herd C. Metcalf T. Modrzynska K. Schwach F. Martin R.E. et al.Functional profiling of a Plasmodium genome reveals an abundance of essential genes.Cell. 2017; 170: 260-272.e8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar and subsequently incorporated the phenotypes from the SG-B2 transition of the current screen (STAR Methods). The iPbe model integrates 428 genes and 1,318 reactions (transport and enzymatic reactions; Figures S2B and S2C) that reflect available knowledge and new postulates on the metabolism of the parasite based on our PhenoMapping analysis. We used the iPbe model to analyze essential metabolic capabilities in a stage-specific manner (Figure 4A), working under the assumption that most metabolic phenotypes at the SG-B2 transition reflect gene functions during liver-stage development, a prediction we will validate experimentally below.Figure 4The PhenoMapping Workflow and Degree of Agreement for Metabolic Subsystems in iPbe-Liver with the M-L ScreenShow full caption(A) Illustration of the PhenoMapping workflow for the integration of organism- and context-specific information into the genome-scale iPbe metabolic models.

A stage agnostic model initially predicted 155 of the 428 genes as essential in at least one condition (Table S3). To create blood- and liver-stage-specific models, we used existing knowledge of host metabolite availability as constraints to identify the combinations of nutrients the parasite would need to access to maximize agreement with the phenotypes of the respective knockout screens. We allowed iPbe to uptake 90 metabolites from the surroundings (i.e., the hepatocyte), and we integrated thermodynamic data (pH of intracellular compartments and membrane potential), as well as liver stage transcriptome data (Caldelari et al., 2019Caldelari R.

https://openalex.org/W2985548453,"Translational Statistics proposes to promote the use of Statistics within research and improve the communication of statistical findings in an accurate and accessible manner to diverse audiences. When statistical models become more complex, it becomes harder to evaluate the role of explanatory variables on the response. For example, the interpretation and communication of the effect of predictors in regression models where interactions or smoothing splines are included can be challenging. Informative graphical representations of statistical models play a critical translational role; static nomograms are one such useful tool to visualise statistical models. In this paper, we propose the use of dynamic nomogram as a translational tool which can accommodate models of increased complexity. In theory, all models appearing in the literature could be accompanied by the corresponding dynamic nomogram to translate models in an informative manner. The R package presented will facilitate this communication for a variety of linear and non-linear models."

We have identified a neural mechanism that links female sexual behavior with the estrus, the ovulatory phase of the estrous cycle. We find that progesterone-receptor (PR)-expressing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) are active and required during this behavior. Activating these neurons, however, does not elicit sexual behavior in non-estrus females. We show that projections of PR+ VMH neurons to the anteroventral periventricular (AVPV) nucleus change across the 5-day mouse estrous cycle, with ∼3-fold more termini and functional connections during estrus. This cyclic increase in connectivity is found in adult females, but not males, and regulated by estrogen signaling in PR+ VMH neurons. We further show that these connections are essential for sexual behavior in receptive females.

We further show that these connections are essential for sexual behavior in receptive females. Thus, estrogen-regulated structural plasticity of behaviorally salient connections in the adult female brain links sexual behavior to the estrus phase of the estrous cycle. Female sexual behavior is intimately linked with the estrous cycle in many species such that females are only receptive for a brief period at the estrus stage surrounding ovulation. This coincidence of female sexual receptivity with ovulation leads to extreme differences in behavioral ecology and reproductive strategies. For example, mice enter estrus and are receptive every 5 days, whereas the giant panda is in estrus and receptive once a year, representing a naturally occurring ∼70-fold variation in the potential to engage in sexual behavior (Allen, 1922Allen E. The oestrous cycle in the mouse.Am. J. Anat. 1922; 30: 297-371Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar, Lindburg et al., 2001Lindburg D.G. Czekala N.M. Swaisgood R.R. Hormonal and behavioral relationships during estrus in the giant panda.Zoo Biol. 2001; 20: 537-543Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Such alliance between sexual behavior and ovulation can be adaptive, because a reduction in non-productive mating is energetically efficient and lowers risk of predation, and productive mating during particular periods likely enhances survival of progeny. The sex hormones 17β-estradiol (the most bioactive form of estrogens in vivo and referred to as estrogen here) and progesterone released by the ovary are required for female sexual behavior and ovulation in many animals. The titers of these hormones in the circulation peak around estrus, at the time of female sexual receptivity and ovulation, whereas hormone levels subside to baseline, essentially reaching undetectable levels, at other stages of the estrous cycle in mice (DeLeon et al., 1990DeLeon D.D.

Estrogen and progesterone act reversibly in adult females to promote ovulation and sexual behavior in an action referred to as the activational effect of hormones (Arnold, 2009Arnold A.P.

For example, removal of ovaries in adult wild-type (WT) females abrogates receptivity, while supplementing such females with estrogen and progesterone induces this behavior. These sex hormones signal through cognate nuclear hormone receptors estrogen receptor alpha (ERα or Esr1) and PR (or Pgr) that are also essential for ovulation and sexual behavior (Lubahn et al., 1993Lubahn D.B.

These neurons co-express Esr1, and targeted ablation of PR+ VMHvl (Pvl) cells in adult females renders even estrus females unreceptive. Importantly, targeted ablation of Pvl neurons does not appear to alter the estrous cycle or other behaviors (Yang et al., 2013Yang C.F. Chiang M.C. Gray D.C. Prabhakaran M. Alvarado M. Juntti S.A.

Together, these findings demonstrate a central role for these cells in the display of female sexual behavior and show that functional manipulations of Pvl neurons decouple behavioral (female sexual receptivity) from physiological estrus. Such decoupling is to be expected if these cells modulate sexual displays but do not play a role in linking physiological estrus with female receptivity (Figure 1A). Alternatively, the targeted ablation of Pvl neurons, which profoundly and permanently reduced sexual receptivity, might have obscured a role of these cells in coupling female sexual behavior to physiological estrus. In order to determine whether Pvl neurons play a role in linking receptive behavior to physiological estrus, we performed a series of acute functional manipulations in freely moving females. Surprisingly, although Pvl neurons are active and required during female sexual behavior, their activation did not elicit this behavior in unreceptive females. We find that estrogen signaling via Esr1 in the VMHvl elicits a ∼3-fold increase in presynaptic termini of Pvl neurons in the anteroventral periventricular (AVPV). These presynaptic termini are functionally meaningful, because optogenetically inhibiting them suppresses sexual behavior in receptive females. Thus, Pvl neurons are not only essential for the display of female sexual behavior, but they also play a critical role in linking this behavior to physiological estrus. More generally, our findings demonstrate large dynamic changes in connectivity in the adult female brain that are regulated by estrogen and function to coordinate an innate behavioral program with physiological state. To test whether Pvl neurons are active during female sexual behavior, we sought to express the calcium sensor GCaMP6s in female Pvl neurons and perform fiber photometry in PRCre/PL mice (Cui et al., 2013Cui G.

In addition, most mCherry+ neurons in the VMHvl co-expressed nuclear β-galactosidase (nβgal) (Figure 1D). The small percent of mCherry+ and nβgal–VMHvl neurons (9.3 ± 1.4%, n = 3) likely reflects greater sensitivity in detecting a Cre-dependent transgene driven by strong promoters and from ≥ 1 viral genomes compared to expression of nβgal, which is inserted as a single-copy into the weakly transcribed PR locus (Yang et al., 2013Yang C.F.

We targeted expression of a virally encoded GCaMP6s (AAV-flex-GCaMP6s) to Pvl neurons of PRCre females, removed ovaries (Ovx), and implanted an optic fiber over the VMHvl (Figures 1E–1G). Ovx eliminates from circulation the estrus-inducing hormones, estrogen and progesterone, and enables comparison of females at polar ends of physiological estrus and receptivity by experimental supplementation of these hormones or vehicle (Table S1). Following recovery from surgery, we hormonally primed these females to be receptive and inserted them into the cage of a singly housed sexually experienced WT male (Ring, 1944Ring J.R. The estrogen-progesterone induction of sexual receptivity in the spayed female mouse.Endocrinology. 1944; 34: 269-275Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, Wu et al., 2009Wu M.V. Manoli D.S. Fraser E.J. Coats J.K. Tollkuhn J. Honda S. Harada N. Shah N.M. Estrogen masculinizes neural pathways and sex-specific behaviors.Cell. 2009; 139: 61-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Entry into the cage led to a large increase in GCaMP6s fluorescence in these females (Figures 1H and 1I). Mice utilize chemosensory cues to interact with their environment, and we observed increases in GCaMP6s fluorescence when females chemoinvestigated (sniffed) the males (Figures 1J and 1K). GCaMP6s signal also increased when the WT male sniffed the female, indicating that her Pvl neurons were responding to tactile cues or shorter-range volatile odors emanating from the male (Figures 1L and 1O). In mice, sexual behavior consists of multiple bouts of mounting and intromission (penetration) that can eventually culminate in ejaculation. Estrus females will often adopt an immobile receptive stance (lordosis) when the male mounts or intromits to enable mating to succeed (Harvey, 1651Harvey W. Exercitationes de generatione animalium.in: Willis tr., R. The Works of William Harvey. HardPress Publishing, Miami, USA1651: 186-187Google Scholar, Thompson and Edwards, 1971Thompson M.L. Edwards D.A. Experiential and strain determinants of the estrogen-progesterone induction of sexual receptivity in spayed female mice.Horm. Behav. 1971; 2: 299-305Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). GCaMP6s fluorescence increased in Pvl neurons during lordosis and essentially all mount and intromission events regardless of whether or not they resulted in lordosis (Figures 1M–1O; Video S1). In addition, we observed an increase in GCaMP6s fluorescence when the male ejaculated (peak ΔF/F = 0.065 ± 0.01, Mean ± SEM, n = 4) (Video S1). Thus, Pvl neurons in receptive females are responsive to chemoinvestigation and various mating displays of both males and females. Surprisingly, Pvl neurons of Ovx, unprimed (and therefore unreceptive) females responded similarly when the female entered a male cage, during episodes of sniffing, as well as when the male attempted to mount her (Figures S1A–S1H; Video S1). Sexually experienced males can occasionally intromit even with non-estrus females, and we observed corresponding increases in GCaMP6s fluorescence of unreceptive female Pvl neurons (Figures S1G and S1H). Non-estrus females do not lordose, and accordingly, we could not determine if lordosis also increased GCaMP6s signal in Pvl neurons of unprimed females. In preliminary studies, we also observed that Pvl neurons of naturally cycling females showed comparable responses during mating regardless of whether the female was in diestrus or estrus (data not shown). Together, our findings show that, unexpectedly, Pvl neurons are active during exploratory and copulatory aspects of mating in receptive as well as unreceptive females. Imaging at single cell resolution will determine whether individual Pvl neurons respond similarly between these two sets of females. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI2MWUxNDBkODI0NDk5MTYzZDc4YWJjYTAyMjBkNmVkZiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4NTYyNTA5fQ.sE-x0zA2-CO_obhV0I0HqgyVq7QOR6XSF2LKm0WAl1kWLU36L6eIuqNeMTmidqZGKnuHajvxCKwGF39JXeZ-MYG_PQg00KTQdzc-cvDIzOsr2KgY8iHxWq5jt0zZaAtFsHgViFRzj4Xm7aCrZA799arUpOUzG7s_3ZDmXJgnEtMdh4eNgIwZ1UJLESFVH0Ii_O7aoKHw7tTLZ9yOU-SRU8f-EH7sO8gPRYm5p03rNnSHjVf0LVO8ue2O6tH0etZRLk_3_Z8hIFVDPZE_x-oYlOKXXA_B1QirUcbbR1mBPSZLfESUlALOBskwCKoC6SE6NolnCjFymE0WRSqrg3nl8w Download .mp4 (13.02 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1. Female Pvl Neurons Are Active during Mating with a WT male, Related to Figure 1Fiber photometry imaging of Pvl neurons shows that these cells are active in an Ovx PRCre female hormonally primed to be in estrus when she is mating with a WT male. Increase in activity is apparent during mounting, intromission, and ejaculation. Pvl neurons of the same female are also active when she was tested without hormonal priming in a separate assay and with a different WT male. Increase in activity is apparent when the male mounts her. To test if we would observe similar changes in Pvl activity when females were exposed to other cues, we inserted them into a cage containing a WT receptive female or an inanimate object (wooden block). Pvl neurons responded similarly to both stimuli regardless of whether or not females were primed to be in estrus (Figures 1H–1K and S1I–S1P). Strikingly, these cells responded equivalently to the object and the WT female, and their response was significantly less than that observed toward males (Figures 1H–1K). The differential and rapid response of Pvl neurons to entry into a male cage makes it unlikely to be simply a stress response; consistent with this notion, we did not observe any change in circulating corticotropin (ACTH) upon entry into the cage (Figure S1Q). In summary, our findings establish that female Pvl neurons respond preferentially during various interactions with a male, including mating routines, and that these responses are observed in both receptive and unreceptive mice. We tested whether Pvl neurons acutely regulate female sexual behavior. We targeted a virally encoded Cre-dependent inhibitory DREADD (DREADDi) (Roth, 2016Roth B.L. DREADDs for Neuroscientists.Neuron. 2016; 89: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, Sternson and Roth, 2014Sternson S.M. Roth B.L. Chemogenetic tools to interrogate brain functions.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 37: 387-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) to Pvl cells of PRCre females and performed Ovx (Figures 2A and S2A). We induced estrus with hormonal priming and inserted these females into the cage of a WT singly housed male. The DREADD ligand, CNO, specifically elicited a marked diminution in sexual receptivity and an increase in rejection of male mating attempts (Figures 2B–2D and S2B–S2E), with a corresponding ∼4-fold reduction in the ability of WT males to ejaculate (Figure 2E). This chemogenetic reduction in female sexual receptivity demonstrates that ongoing activity of Pvl neurons is critical for mating behavior of receptive females.Figure S2Activity of Pvl Neurons Is Necessary but Not Sufficient for Female Sexual Receptivity, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) DREADDi+ (mCherry+) Pvl neurons labeled in PRCre but not WT females.(B–E) CNO does not disrupt sexual receptivity in PRCre females expressing mCherry but no DREADD in Pvl neurons.(F) DREADDq+ (mCherry+) Pvl neurons labeled in PRCre but not WT females.(G–J) CNO does not increase sexual receptivity in PRCre females primed to be in estrus.(K) CNO induces Fos in DREADDq+ Pvl neurons.(L) Larger percent of DREADDq+ Pvl neurons expresses Fos with CNO than saline.(M–P) No change in female sexual receptivity with CNO, regardless of CNO dose.(Q) ChR2+ Pvl neurons labeled in PRCre but not WT females.(R) Laser illumination induces Fos in ChR2+ Pvl neurons.(S) Larger percent of ChR2+ Pvl neurons expresses Fos upon laser illumination.(T–W) Laser illumination does not disrupt sexual receptivity in Ovx, vehicle-treated PRCre females expressing EYFP in Pvl neurons.Mean ± SEM n = 5 (B-E); n = 15 (G–J); n = 4 (saline), 3 (CNO) (L); n = 6 (0.3 mg/kg), 7 (15 mg/kg) (M–P); n = 4/transgene (S); n = 4 (T–W).

Scale bars = 100 μm (A, F, and Q) and 10 μm (K and R) ∗∗∗p < 0.001. We next tested if activation of Pvl neurons could elicit sexual receptivity in females. The excitatory DREADD (DREADDq) depolarizes membrane potential and increases spiking in Pvl neurons of both sexes (Yang et al., 2017Yang T. Yang C.F. Chizari M.D. Maheswaranathan N. Burke Jr., K.J. Borius M. Inoue S. Chiang M.C. Bender K.J. Ganguli S. Shah N.M. Social Control of Hypothalamus-Mediated Male Aggression.Neuron. 2017; 95: 955-970.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We therefore delivered virally encoded Cre-dependent DREADDq to the VMHvl of PRCre females, performed Ovx, and tested whether CNO elicited sexual receptivity (Figures 2F and S2F). Hormone induction of estrus leads to females who are highly sexually receptive, and we could not enhance this behavior further with CNO because of a ceiling effect (Figures S2G–S2J). We wondered whether we could induce receptivity in primed females in a more sensitized setting. Accordingly, we tested whether activation of Pvl neurons in primed females was sufficient to elicit receptive behavior in the presence of males who did not mate. We therefore activated these cells in primed females and inserted them into the cage of a castrated male. However, the mere presence of a male who did not initiate any mating did not elicit sexually receptive behavior from primed females treated with saline or CNO (0/5 females showed lordosis). We also did not observe sexually receptive behavior upon chemogenetic activation of Pvl neurons in a separate cohort of primed females who were inserted into the cage of a castrated male whose dorsum was coated with urine from gonadally intact males (0/5 females showed lordosis). This latter set of castrated males bear the pheromonal profile of gonadally intact males but do not initiate mating. Thus, activation of Pvl neurons in primed females is not sufficient to elicit receptive behavior in the mere presence of males. We next tested if activation of Pvl neurons could induce receptivity in Ovx, unprimed females. However, such females were unreceptive and rejected males, who were consequently unable to ejaculate (Figures 2G–2J). CNO, but not saline, induced Fos in Pvl neurons of these females, showing that these cells were activated as expected (Figures S2K and S2L) (Yang et al., 2017Yang T. Yang C.F.

Here, we leveraged newly developed negative allosteric modulators (NAMs), transgenic mice, and viral-assisted optogenetics to test the hypothesis that selective inhibition of mGlu2 or mGlu3 potentiates PFC excitatory transmission and confers antidepressant efficacy in preclinical models. We found that systemic treatment with an mGlu2 or mGlu3 NAM rapidly activated biophysically unique PFC pyramidal cell ensembles. Mechanistic studies revealed that mGlu2 and mGlu3 NAMs enhance thalamocortical transmission and inhibit long-term depression by mechanistically distinct presynaptic and postsynaptic actions. Consistent with these actions, systemic treatment with either NAM decreased passive coping and reversed anhedonia in two independent chronic stress models, suggesting that both mGlu2 and mGlu3 NAMs induce antidepressant-like effects through related but divergent mechanisms of action."
https://openalex.org/W2989081500,"Type I interferon (IFN) induced by virus infections during pregnancy can cause placental damage, but the mechanisms and identities of IFN-stimulated genes that are involved in this damage remain under investigation. The IFN-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) inhibit virus infections by preventing virus membrane fusion with cells and by inhibiting fusion of infected cells (syncytialization). Fusion of placental trophoblasts via expression of endogenous retroviral fusogens known as syncytins forms the syncytiotrophoblast, a multinucleated cell structure essential for fetal development. We found here that IFN blocks fusion of BeWo human placental trophoblasts. Stably expressed IFITM1, -2, and -3 also blocked fusion of these trophoblasts while making them more resistant to virus infections. Conversely, stable IFITM knockdowns in BeWo trophoblasts increased their spontaneous fusion and allowed fusion in the presence of IFN while also making the cells more susceptible to virus infection. We additionally found that exogenous expression of IFITMs in HEK293T cells blocked fusion with cells expressing syncytin-1 or syncytin-2, confirming the ability of IFITMs to block individual syncytin-mediated fusion. Overall, our data indicate that IFITMs inhibit trophoblast fusion and suggest that there may be a critical balance between these antifusogenic effects and the beneficial antiviral effects of IFITMs in virus infections during pregnancy."

Elucidation of the cellular substrate of developmental miswiring causing later cognitive deficits opens new perspectives for identification of neurobiological targets amenable to therapies. Cortical function relies on the precise wiring and activation of diverse populations of pyramidal cells and interneurons that are entrained in oscillatory rhythms. Although recent studies have revealed several assembling rules of cortical microcircuits in the adult brain (Harris and Shepherd, 2015Harris K.D. Shepherd G.M. The neocortical circuit: themes and variations.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), their ontogeny is still poorly understood.

Elucidating the features of such immature networks is of paramount importance in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, as their early disruption is thought to underlie the later emergence of devastating symptoms that characterize these diseases (Marín, 2016Marín O. Developmental timing and critical windows for the treatment of psychiatric disorders.Nat. Med. 2016; 22: 1229-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We started to elucidate the mechanisms of functional coupling within the developing brain and have shown that pyramidal neurons in the superficial layers of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) play a fundamental role in generating beta/low-gamma oscillations in the neonatal mouse (Bitzenhofer et al., 2017Bitzenhofer S.H.

Disturbed gamma activity has been observed long before the onset of psychosis in high-risk humans (Leicht et al., 2016Leicht G. Vauth S. Polomac N. Andreou C. Rauh J. Mußmann M. Karow A. Mulert C. EEG-informed fMRI reveals a disturbed gamma-band-specific network in subjects at high risk for psychosis.Schizophr.

Gogos J.A. Hanganu-Opatz I.L. From shortage to surge: a developmental switch in hippocampal-prefrontal coupling in a gene-environment model of neuropsychiatric disorders.Cereb. Cortex. 2016; 26: 4265-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the circuit dysfunction underlying such abnormalities is still unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we interrogate the developing prefrontal network in a mouse model mimicking both the genetic (mutation of the intracellular hub of developmental processes Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia 1 [DISC1] gene; Brandon and Sawa, 2011Brandon N.J. Sawa A. Linking neurodevelopmental and synaptic theories of mental illness through DISC1.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 12: 707-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and the environmental (challenge by maternal immune activation [MIA]) background that has been related to mental illness (dual-hit genetic-environmental [GE] mice). At adult age, these mice mimic, to a large extent, the network dysfunction as well as memory and attention deficits identified in human psychiatric disorders (Abazyan et al., 2010Abazyan B. Nomura J. Kannan G. Ishizuka K. Tamashiro K.L. Nucifora F. Pogorelov V. Ladenheim B. Yang C. Krasnova I.N. et al.Prenatal interaction of mutant DISC1 and immune activation produces adult psychopathology.Biol. Psychiatry. 2010; 68: 1172-1181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The impairment of prefrontal-hippocampal circuits underlying poorer cognitive performance emerges early in life only when both risk factors converge and is absent in neonatal mice challenged with the genetic or environmental stressor alone (Hartung et al., 2016Hartung H. Cichon N. De Feo V. Riemann S. Schildt S. Lindemann C. Mulert C. Gogos J.A. Hanganu-Opatz I.L. From shortage to surge: a developmental switch in hippocampal-prefrontal coupling in a gene-environment model of neuropsychiatric disorders.Cereb. Cortex. 2016; 26: 4265-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanisms of developmental dysfunction, we focus on neonatal age (end of 1st–beginning of 2nd postnatal week) of rodents that roughly corresponds to the second/third trimester of human pregnancy, a period of high vulnerability for mental disorders (Selemon and Zecevic, 2015Selemon L.D. Zecevic N. Schizophrenia: a tale of two critical periods for prefrontal cortical development.Transl. Psychiatry. 2015; 5: e623Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We combine in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology with optogenetics, pharmacology, behavioral testing, and confocal microscopy-based structural investigations of the prelimbic subdivision (PL) of the prefrontal cortex. We show that pyramidal neurons in superficial layers exhibit major morphological, synaptic, and functional deficits and lack the ability to organize the beta-gamma entrainment of local prelimbic circuits in neonatal dual-hit GE mice, while deep layers neurons are largely unaffected. Transient administration of minocycline, potentially modulating microglia inflammatory response (Kobayashi et al., 2013Kobayashi K. Imagama S. Ohgomori T. Hirano K. Uchimura K. Sakamoto K. Hirakawa A. Takeuchi H. Suzumura A. Ishiguro N. Kadomatsu K. Minocycline selectively inhibits M1 polarization of microglia.Cell Death Dis. 2013; 4: e525Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), rescues electrophysiological and structural deficits, as well as cognitive abilities at juvenile age. Moreover, we propose that early disruption of prefrontal networks might be predictive of memory impairment at juvenile age. To get first insights into the source of prelimbic dysfunction in dual-hit GE mice, we performed extracellular recordings of the local field potential (LFP) and multiple-unit activity (MUA) over prelimbic layers using four-shank 16 site electrodes in lightly anesthetized (Chini et al., 2019Chini M.

This developmental stage corresponds to the initiation of hippocampus-driven entrainment of prelimbic circuitry (Ahlbeck et al., 2018Ahlbeck J. Song L. Chini M. Bitzenhofer S.H. Hanganu-Opatz I.L.

The exact position of recording sites covering superficial and deep layers was confirmed by the reconstruction of electrode tracks post mortem (Figure 1A). In line with our previous findings (Bitzenhofer et al., 2015Bitzenhofer S.H. Sieben K. Siebert K.D. Spehr M. Hanganu-Opatz I.L.

Cortex. 2016; 26: 4265-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the first patterns of network activity in the neonatal PL of all investigated control and dual-hit GE mice were discontinuous, i.e., spindle-shaped oscillations switching between theta and beta-gamma frequency components alternated with long periods of network silence (Figure 1B). The firing of prelimbic neurons was strongly timed by the oscillatory rhythms. As previously reported (Chini et al., 2019Chini M. Gretenkord S. Kostka J.K. Pöpplau J.A. Cornelissen L. Berde C.B. Hanganu-Opatz I.L. Bitzenhofer S.H. Neural correlates of anesthesia in newborn mice and humans.Front. Neural Circuits. 2019; 13: 38Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the patterns of network oscillations and neuronal firing in the PL were similar in urethane-anesthetized and non-anesthetized neonatal pups, yet the magnitude of activity decreased in the presence of anesthesia (Figure S1). The similarities might be due to the ability of urethane to mimic sleep conditions (Clement et al., 2008Clement E.A. Richard A. Thwaites M. Ailon J. Peters S. Dickson C.T.

De Feo V. Riemann S. Schildt S. Lindemann C. Mulert C. Gogos J.A. Hanganu-Opatz I.L. From shortage to surge: a developmental switch in hippocampal-prefrontal coupling in a gene-environment model of neuropsychiatric disorders.Cereb. Cortex. 2016; 26: 4265-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), it is still unclear whether the dysfunction equally affects the local prelimbic circuits. To address this question, we first monitored the layer-specific differences between oscillatory patterns of control and dual-hit GE mice. Major differences in the occurrence, duration, and broadband power of oscillatory events were detected when comparing the two groups of mice (Figures 1C, 1D, and S2A–S2E; Table S1). However, these detected differences were similar across layers. This might be due, on the one hand, to a layer-unspecific overall damping of entrainment in dual-hit GE mice and, on the other hand, to non-specific conduction synchrony within a rather small tissue volume (300- to 400-μm radius). To discriminate between the two sources, in a second step, we investigated the layer-specific firing rate and timing by oscillatory phase, which are not contaminated by non-specific volume conduction. The firing of neurons in prelimbic superficial layers in GE mice (log −2.1 ± 0.1 spikes/s) was significantly (p < 10−7) reduced when compared to controls (0.61 ± 0.04 spikes/s; Figure 1E). In contrast, neurons in deep layers similarly fired in control (−0.95 ± 0.05 spikes/s) and GE mice (−1.3 ± 0.2 spikes/s). The timing of neuronal firing in relation to beta (12–30 Hz) and gamma (30–100 Hz) frequency was also disturbed and lost its precision in superficial layers (p < 1 × 10−4 and p = 0.021, respectively), but not deep-layer neurons of GE mice when compared to controls (Figures 1F–1H). The timing of spiking by theta oscillations in both superficial and deep layers was similar in control and dual-hit GE mice (Figure S2E). To verify that our results were not biased by anesthesia, we recorded a set of non-anesthetized P8–P10 control (n = 16) and GE (n = 18) mice and confirmed that GE mice have reduced broadband LFP power. The decreased MUA and single-unit activity (SUA) firing rates were limited to neurons in superficial layers (Figures S1G–S1L). In contrast to the significant perturbation of prelimbic activity in neonatal dual-hit GE mice, the oscillatory and firing patterns of one-hit genetic (G) (i.e., only DISC1) or environmental (E) (i.e., only MIA) mice were similar to those of control pups (Figures S2F–S2H). Furthermore, the layer-specific dysfunction seems to be characteristic to the investigated developmental stage P8–P10. In mice of 4–6 days of age, a time window in which neurons are still migrating (Ignacio et al., 1995Ignacio M.P.D. Kimm E.J. Kageyama G.H. Yu J. Robertson R.T. Postnatal migration of neurons and formation of laminae in rat cerebral cortex.Anat. Embryol. (Berl.). 1995; 191: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), deficits are present, yet the layer specificity is lacking (Figures S2I–S2K). On the other hand, in line with our previous data (Hartung et al., 2016Hartung H. Cichon N. De Feo V. Riemann S. Schildt S. Lindemann C. Mulert C. Gogos J.A. Hanganu-Opatz I.L. From shortage to surge: a developmental switch in hippocampal-prefrontal coupling in a gene-environment model of neuropsychiatric disorders.Cereb. Cortex. 2016; 26: 4265-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the properties of prelimbic network oscillations were similar in control and dual-hit GE mice at pre-juvenile age (P20–P23; Figures S2L–S2N). These results demonstrate abnormal beta-gamma band oscillations and entrainment of superficial layers of PL in dual-hit GE mice during this defined developmental period (P8–P10). In developing circuits, beta-gamma band oscillatory activity has been recently shown to require the activation of pyramidal neurons in superficial (PYRsSUP), but not deep, layers (PYRsDEEP) of PL (Bitzenhofer et al., 2017Bitzenhofer S.H. Ahlbeck J. Wolff A. Wiegert J.S. Gee C.E. Oertner T.G. Hanganu-Opatz I.L. Layer-specific optogenetic activation of pyramidal neurons causes beta-gamma entrainment of neonatal networks.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, the weaker beta-gamma entrainment of prelimbic circuits and coupling of neuronal firing to fast oscillations identified in GE mice might result from dysfunction of PYRsSUP. To test this hypothesis, we monitored the effects of light activation of prelimbic neurons that were transfected with light-sensitive proteins and the red fluorescent protein tDimer2. Using our recently established protocol for optogenetic manipulation of developing circuits (Bitzenhofer et al., 2017Bitzenhofer S.H. Ahlbeck J. Wolff A. Wiegert J.S. Gee C.E. Oertner T.G. Hanganu-Opatz I.L. Layer-specific optogenetic activation of pyramidal neurons causes beta-gamma entrainment of neonatal networks.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we achieved cell-type-, layer-, and area-specific transfection of neurons by in utero electroporation (IUE) (Figures S3A and S3B). Constructs coding for the double mutant channelrhodopsin E123 T159 (ChR2(ET/TC)) were transfected by IUE at embryonic day (E) 15.5 and E12.5 for selective targeting of superficial and deep layers, respectively (Figures S3C and S3D). Staining for NeuN showed that a similar fraction of neurons was transfected in control (34.7% ± 0.8%; n = 13 pups) and GE mice (32.0% ± 0.7%; n = 8 pups). The pyramidal-like shape and orientation of primary dendrites confirmed that the expression constructs were exclusively integrated into cell lineages of pyramidal neurons. Omission of ChR2(ET/TC) from the expression construct (i.e., opsin-free) yielded similar expression rates and distribution of tDimer2-positive neurons. Moreover, the success rate of transfection by IUE was similar in control and dual-hit GE mice in the presence and absence of opsin (Figure S3E). The transfection procedure by IUE had no major effects on the overall development of animals (Figures S3F–S3K). Although IUE caused significant reduction of litter size in both control and GE mice (non-electroporated: 8.3 ± 1.1 pups/litter; IUE: 4.6 ± 1.3 pups/litter; p = 0.03), all investigated pups had similar body length, tail length, and weight during the early postnatal period. Vibrissa placing, surface righting, and cliff aversion reflexes were also not affected by IUE or transfection of neurons with opsins (Figures S3I–S3K). First, we assessed the efficiency of light stimulation in inducing action potentials (APs) in prelimbic neurons of control and dual-hit GE mice in vitro. For this, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed from tDimer2-positive PYRsSUP (n = 42) and PYRsDEEP (n = 38) in coronal slices containing the PL from P8–P10 mice after IUE at E15.5 and E12.5, respectively. In line with the previously reported “inside-out” pattern of cortical maturation and, correspondingly, the more mature profile of neurons in deep versus superficial layers, PYRsSUP and PYRsDEEP in control mice significantly differed in some of their passive and active membrane properties (Bitzenhofer et al., 2017Bitzenhofer S.H. Ahlbeck J. Wolff A. Wiegert J.S. Gee C.E. Oertner T.G. Hanganu-Opatz I.L. Layer-specific optogenetic activation of pyramidal neurons causes beta-gamma entrainment of neonatal networks.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, in dual-hit GE mice, the resting membrane potential of PYRsSUP (−53.2 ± 0.37 mV) was more positive when compared with controls (−63.2 ± 0.3 mV; p = 2 × 10−4), and the maximum amplitude of action potentials decreased (44.8 ± 0.80 mV versus 29.2 ± 0.36 mV in controls; p = 0.018). These alterations of intrinsic neuronal properties might point to the immaturity of PYRsSUP in GE mice, even though membrane resistance, membrane time constant, and action potential half-width were not significantly different across conditions (Figures S4A–S4E). The passive and active properties of ChR2(ET/TC)-transfected neurons were similar to those previously reported for age-matched mice (Bitzenhofer et al., 2017Bitzenhofer S.H. Ahlbeck J. Wolff A. Wiegert J.S. Gee C.E. Oertner T.G. Hanganu-Opatz I.L. Layer-specific optogenetic activation of pyramidal neurons causes beta-gamma entrainment of neonatal networks.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Pulsed light stimulation (3 ms, 473 nm, 5.2 mW/mm2) depolarized transfected fluorescently labeled neurons and led to robust firing in all pups. The probability of triggering APs by pulsed light stimuli decreased with increasing stimulation frequency, yet it differed in its dynamics in control versus GE mice. Whereas PYRsSUP of control mice were able to reliably follow light stimulations up to 16 Hz, in GE mice, they had a significant firing drop already between 8 and 16 Hz (Figures S4E and S4F). Light stimulation of PYRsDEEP showed a similar decrease of firing probability with augmenting stimulation frequency in control and GE mice. To elucidate the consequences of abnormal intrinsic firing preference for oscillatory network entrainment, we monitored the effects of light activation of either PYRsSUP or PYRsDEEP in vivo. In controls, activation of PYRsSUP selectively drove the neonatal prelimbic networks in beta-gamma frequency range, whereas activation of PYRsDEEP caused non-specific network activation. We reasoned that, if PYRsSUP are indeed the cause of the previously demonstrated disruption of beta-gamma activity in the PL of GE mice, then their light stimulation in vivo should not be able to selectively induce oscillations in this range. Ramp light stimulation increased the neuronal firing of ChR2(ET/TC)-transfected PYRsSUP and PYRsDEEP in control and GE mice (p < 10−4 for all conditions), but not of neurons transfected with opsin-free constructs (Figures 2A–2H and S5). The light-induced augmentation of firing was similar in the two groups of mice (p = 0.46 and p = 0.24 for PYRsSUP and PYRsDEEP, respectively). The spike discharge initiated once the power exceeded a certain threshold. For some neurons, the firing decreased toward the end of the ramp stimulations, indicating that, similar to the in vitro conditions, their membrane potential reached a depolarizing plateau, preventing further spiking. However, for the majority of neurons, the firing rate after stimulus remained higher than before the stimulus (Figures 2C and 2G), suggesting that global network activation had been induced by light stimulation in the developing circuits. Major differences in the firing of prelimbic neurons from control and GE mice were detected. Although PYRsSUP in controls had a preferred inter-spike interval of ∼60 ms, equivalent to a population firing at 16.7 Hz (Figures 2A and 2D), a coordinated frequency-tuned discharge pattern was absent in GE mice upon ramp stimulation of PYRsSUP (condition effect, p = 4 × 10–5; p < 0.05 in the 15- to 20-Hz range with the exception of p = 0.059 at 16.7 Hz; Figures 2B and 2D). In contrast, the firing dynamics of PYRsDEEP was similar in control and GE mice (condition effect p = 0.11) and showed no frequency-specific concentration of firing during ramp stimulation (Figures 2E–2H). To causally prove the contribution of abnormal firing of PYRsSUP to the weaker beta-gamma band entrainment previously identified in the PL of dual-hit GE mice, we tested the effects of ramp stimulations on the discontinuous network oscillations. When compared with pulsed stimulations, ramp stimulations have the advantage of not inducing power contamination by repetitive and fast large-amplitude voltage deflections resulting from simultaneous opening of light-activated channels and to trigger more physiological and not artificially synchronous firing patterns (Bitzenhofer et al., 2017Bitzenhofer S.H. Ahlbeck J. Wolff A. Wiegert J.S. Gee C.E. Oertner T.G. Hanganu-Opatz I.L. Layer-specific optogenetic activation of pyramidal neurons causes beta-gamma entrainment of neonatal networks.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In control mice, the LFP power in beta- and gamma-frequency range significantly increased during ramp stimulation of PYRsSUP (p = 0.02 and p = 0.002, respectively), whereas the theta-band activity remained unaffected (p = 0.26). In contrast, PYRsSUP in GE mice lost their ability to boost neonatal prelimbic oscillations in a frequency-specific manner, because ramp stimulations did not affect the LFP power (p = 0.49, p = 0.57, and p = 0.44 for theta-, beta-, and gamma-frequency band, respectively; Figure 3A). Moreover, stimulation of PYRsSUP differently modulated power in beta- and gamma-frequency band between control and GE mice (p = 0.03 and p = 0.03, respectively). Not only the light-induced inter-spike interval and power of network oscillations were disrupted in GE mice, but also the timing of firing by the oscillatory phase was impaired. To quantify this relationship, we used pairwise phase consistency (PPC), a measure of synchrony that is not biased by firing rates (Vinck et al., 2010Vinck M. van Wingerden M. Womelsdorf T. Fries P. Pennartz C.M. The pairwise phase consistency: a bias-free measure of rhythmic neuronal synchronization.Neuroimage. 2010; 51: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In control mice, stimulation increased the PPC for beta (p = 0.008) and gamma oscillations (p = 0.003), but not for theta (p = 0.24). In contrast, the PPC for theta (p = 0.09), beta (p = 0.86), and gamma oscillations (p = 0.37) during stimulation of PYRsSUP in GE mice did not change (Figures 3D–3F), indicating that the synchronization of spikes relative to the phase of these oscillations was not affected by light activations of PYRsSUP. However, due to high variability, no difference in PPC modulation between the two mouse groups achieved statistical significance (Figures 3D–3F). In line with the frequency-unspecific augmentation of firing rate after light activation of PYRsDEEP in control mice, the LFP power in all frequency bands increased during stimulation and remained at a high level even after it. In GE mice, optogenetic stimulation did not augment the power. No differences in power modulation between the two mouse groups were detected (Figure S6). Thus, the reduced beta-gamma activity in the PL of neonatal dual-hit GE mice relates to the dysfunction of firing dynamics of PYRsSUP. The selective dysfunction of PYRsSUP and the corresponding abnormal network activity in GE mice might relate to abnormal morphology and connectivity of these neurons at neonatal age. To test this hypothesis, we undertook a detailed histological examination of the cytoarchitecture of tDimer-labeled pyramidal neurons in superficial and deep layers of P10 control and"

Like most other porous materials, wood exhibits sorption hysteresis. That is, the moisture content is higher if equilibrium is reached by desorption than if it is reached by absorption under the same ambient climate conditions. The mechanism of moisture uptake by wood are different in the hygroscopic and over-hygroscopic moisture ranges and due to methodical issues, most studies of sorption hysteresis have been performed in the hygroscopic range. In the present study, total sorption hysteresis was separated into hysteresis in cell wall water and capillary water respectively in the whole moisture range by a novel combination of experimental techniques. Wood specimens were conditioned to several high moisture contents using a new system based on the pressure plate technique, and the distinction between cell wall water and capillary water was done with differential scanning calorimetry. The results showed that sorption hysteresis in wood cell walls exists in the whole moisture range. The cell walls were not saturated with water until the whole wood specimen was saturated which contradicts the long-held dogma that cell walls are saturated before significant amounts of capillary water are present in wood."

The contributions of distinct neuron types to sensory processing and network synchronization in primate visual cortex remain largely undetermined. We show that in awake monkey V1, there exists a distinct cell type (››30% of neurons) that has narrow-waveform (NW) action potentials and high spontaneous discharge rates and fires in high-frequency bursts. These neurons are more stimulus selective and phase locked to 30- to 80-Hz gamma oscillations than other neuron types. Unlike other neuron types, their gamma-phase locking is highly predictive of orientation tuning. We find evidence for strong rhythmic inhibition in these neurons, suggesting that they interact with interneurons to act as excitatory pacemakers for the V1 gamma rhythm. We did not find a similar class of NW bursting neurons in L2-L4 of mouse V1. Given its properties, this class of NW bursting neurons should be pivotal for the encoding and transmission of stimulus information."

Brush biopsy, though minimally invasive, demands skilled cyto-pathologist expertise. In this study, we explored the clinical utility/efficacy of a tele-cytology system in combination with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based risk-stratification model for early detection of oral potentially malignant (OPML)/malignant lesion. A portable, automated tablet-based tele-cytology platform capable of digitization of cytology slides was evaluated for its efficacy in the detection of OPML/malignant lesions (n = 82) in comparison with conventional cytology and histology. Then, an image pre-processing algorithm was established to segregate cells, ANN was trained with images (n = 11,981) and a risk-stratification model developed. The specificity, sensitivity and accuracy of platform/ stratification model were computed, and agreement was examined using Kappa statistics. The tele-cytology platform, Cellscope, showed an overall accuracy of 84–86% with no difference between tele-cytology and conventional cytology in detection of oral lesions (kappa, 0.67–0.72). However, OPML could be detected with low sensitivity (18%) in accordance with the limitations of conventional cytology. The integration of image processing and development of an ANN-based risk stratification model improved the detection sensitivity of malignant lesions (93%) and high grade OPML (73%), thereby increasing the overall accuracy by 30%. Tele-cytology integrated with the risk stratification model, a novel strategy established in this study, can be an invaluable Point-of-Care (PoC) tool for early detection/screening in oral cancer. This study hence establishes the applicability of tele-cytology for accurate, remote diagnosis and use of automated ANN-based analysis in improving its efficacy."

This research documents a recent approach to teaching implicit bias.Medical students matriculating during 2014 and 2015 participated in a determinants of health course including instruction about implicit bias. Each submitted a reflective essay discussing implicit bias, the experience of taking the Implicit Association Test (IAT), and other course content. Using grounded theory methodology, student essays that discussed reactions to the IAT were analyzed for content themes based on specific statements mapping to each theme. Twenty-five percent of essays underwent a second review to calculate agreement between raters regarding identification of statements mapping to themes.Of 250 essays, three-quarters discussed students' results on the IAT. Theme comments related to: a) experience taking the IAT, b) bias in medicine, and c) prescriptive comments. Most of the comments (84%) related to students' acknowledging the importance of recognizing implicit bias. More than one-half (60%) noted that bias affects clinical decision-making, and one-fifth (19%) stated that they believe it is the physician's responsibility to advocate for dismantling bias.Through taking the IAT and developing an understanding of implicit bias, medical students can gain insight into the effect it may have on clinical decision-making. Having pre-clinical medical students explore implicit bias through the IAT can lay a foundation for discussing this very human tendency."

Therefore, identification of the molecular mechanisms driving dysregulated tenocyte apoptosis is important in understanding the pathophysiology of tendinopathy. CD44 is a principal cell-surface receptor for hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid (HA)), which is a constituent of the ECM. We have previously demonstrated that CD44 is clearly located at the plasma membranes and cell-cell junctions of the cultured tenocytes and mediates the HA-induced down-regulation of MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression in interleukin (IL)-1β–stimulated tenocytes (15Wu P.T.

Growing evidence indicates that signaling through CD44 can induce the anti-apoptotic effects on OA chondrocytes (16Lisignoli G. Grassi F. Zini N. Toneguzzi S. Piacentini A. Guidolin D. Bevilacqua C. Facchini A.

Furthermore, RNAi or mAb targeting CD44 induces apoptosis in various kinds of cancer cells (17Park Y.S. Huh J.W. Lee J.H.

As such, this study was undertaken to address the role of CD44-mediated apoptotic process in tendinopathy. Our hypotheses are as follows: (i) that the expression of CD44 and apoptotic cell number are positively correlated with disease severity in human long head of biceps (LHB) tendinopathy and (ii) that blocking CD44 induces cell apoptosis and the expressions of MMPs, inflammatory mediators, and phosphorylated NF-κB in primary tenocytes from rats following collagenase injection, as well as the down-regulation of tendon-related proliferation marker expression. Our results implicate that CD44-mediated signaling pathways may not only inhibit apoptosis, but also mediate anti-inflammation and maintain ECM homeostasis during tendinopathy. The expression of CD44 was first correlated with apoptosis in the tendon of patients with LHB tendinopathy. Immunohistochemical and TUNEL stainings showed that CD44 and apoptotic cells were detected with increased expression levels and positively correlated with the histological grades of patients during progression of tendinopathy (Fig. 1, A and C). Immunofluorescence and TUNEL stainings demonstrated co-staining of CD44 expression and apoptotic cells in tendon from patients with LHB tendinopathy (Fig. 1B). Tenocytes from the collagenase-treated rat tendon at week 1 expressed higher levels of IL-1β, IL-6, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), MMP-1, MMP-3, α-smooth muscle actin expression (α-SMA), and CD44 but lower levels of collagen type I (COL1A1) and type III COL3A1 than those from normal rat tendon (Fig. 2), indicating that these cells were under both tendinopathic and myofibroblastic conditions (p < 0.05 for all results; Fig. 2). To determine and clarify the role of CD44-associated apoptosis in tendinopathy, OX-50, a CD44-antagonizing antibody, was added to the cell culture of primary tenocytes from rats following collagenase injection. After treatment with OX-50 (10 μg/ml) for 24 h, cell viability was significantly reduced, as determined by WST-8 analysis (p < 0.001; Fig. 3A). Furthermore, TUNEL-positive cells were observed in the OX-50–treated tenocytes for 24 h (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, a reduction in phosphorylated AKT levels and, in contrast, induction in the ratios of cleaved caspase-3 to pro-caspase-3 and phosphorylated NF-κB to NF-κB in the OX-50–treated tenocytes were simultaneously detected, as determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 3C). We further investigated the expression of COL1A1, COL3A1, and tenomodulin (tnmd), which are related molecules produced by proliferative tenocytes in OX-50–treated cells. Their mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly down-regulated, as determined by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) (p < 0.05 for all results; Fig. 3D) and immunoblotting (see Fig. 5A). In contrast, the mRNA expression of MMP family members, including MMP-1, -3, -9, and -13, and inflammation-related genes, including IL-1beta, IL-6, TNFalpha, and COX-2, was concomitantly up-regulated in OX-50–treated tenocytes, as measured by qRT-PCR (p < 0.05 for all results; Fig. 4). Furthermore, the protein expression levels of MMP-1 and -3, COX-2, and IL-6 were increased in OX-50–treated tenocytes compared with those in the control cells, as determined by immunoblotting and ELISA analyses (Fig. 5B). However, TNFα and IL-1β levels were undetectable between the control and OX-50–treated cells by ELISA tests.Figure 4mRNA expression of inflammation-related mediators and MMPs in rat primary tenocytes via CD44 blockage.

As the severity of tendinopathy progressed, the expression of CD44 and apoptosis correlatively increased in patients with LHB tendinopathy. CD44 expression and TUNEL-positive cells were co-stained in tendinopathic tendon. Blocking the CD44 signaling pathways using OX-50 significantly induced cell apoptosis and the levels of cleaved caspase-3 in tenocytes from rat Achilles tendons following collagenase injection. Moreover, OX-50 decreased tenocyte viability and the expression of COL1A1, COL3A1, tnmd, and phosphorylated AKT. On the other hand, there were elevated levels of inflammatory mediator (including IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, COX-2, and phosphorylated NF-κB) as well as MMP family member (including MMP-1, -3, -9, and -13) expression in tenocytes upon OX-50 treatment. HA is known to regulate various cellular mechanisms through interacting with CD44, including cell adhesion, growth, survival, migration, and differentiation. It has been documented that enrichment of HA to the chondrocyte surface by binding to the CD44 receptor induces cell proliferation and matrix synthesis. Similarly, it has been found that HA reduces IL-1β–stimulated MMP-13 expression and attenuates oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in human OA chondrocytes through engaging with CD44 (20Mongkhon J.M. Thach M. Shi Q. Fernandes J.C. Fahmi H. Benderdour M. Sorbitol-modified hyaluronic acid reduces oxidative stress, apoptosis and mediators of inflammation and catabolism in human osteoarthritic chondrocytes.Inflamm. Res. 2014; 63 (24858301): 691-70110.1007/s00011-014-0742-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The anti-apoptotic effects of HA on anti-FAS–induced apoptosis of chondrocytes from OA patients are abrogated by anti-CD44 antibodies (16Lisignoli G. Grassi F. Zini N. Toneguzzi S. Piacentini A. Guidolin D. Bevilacqua C. Facchini A.

Short-hairpin RNA targeting CD44 inhibits cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis of colon carcinoma cells, whereas anti-CD44 small interference RNA impairs chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cell viability, whereas engagement of CD44 by HA protects CLL cells from apoptosis (17Park Y.S. Huh J.W. Lee J.H. Kim H.R. shRNA against CD44 inhibits cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and promotes apoptosis of colon carcinoma cells.Oncol.

Moreover, anti-CD44 antibody could induce apoptosis in chondrosarcoma cell line SW1353 (19Yoshida M. Yasuda T. Hiramitsu T. Ito H. Nakamura T.

Various cancer-related studies also demonstrated that CD44 promoted cell survival and suppressed apoptosis through AKT signaling and HA synthesis (21Liu S. Cheng C. Akt signaling is sustained by a CD44 splice isoform-mediated positive feedback loop.Cancer Res. 2017; 77 (28533273): 3791-380110.1158/0008-5472.CAN-16-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Anand V.

Hyaluronan-CD44/RHAMM interaction-dependent cell proliferation and survival in lung cancer cells. Mol. Carcinog. 58, 321–333.10.1002/mc.22930Google Scholar). These observations correlate with our findings that increased expression of CD44 is related to enhanced apoptosis during progression of LHB tendinopathy (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the OX-50–treated rat tenocytes from collagenase-injected Achilles tendons showed higher cleaved caspase-3 level and apoptotic cell number than control counterparts. In addition, they had down-regulated phosphorylated AKT expression and reduced cell viability in response to OX-50 treatment (Fig. 3). To our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal the anti-apoptotic role of CD44 in tendinopathy. Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β have been recognized as the main initiators of tendinopathy and can be released by tenocytes in response to mechanical overload, resulting in the production of proinflammatory mediators such as COX-2, MMP-1, and MMP-3 through an NF-κB–mediated mechanism (24Shakibaei M. Buhrmann C. Mobasheri A. Anti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic effects of TENDOACTIVE(R) on human tenocytes in vitro.Histol. Histopathol. 2011; 26 (21751149): 1173-118510.14670/HH-26.1173PubMed Google Scholar). IL-1beta not only induces IL-6, IL-1beta, COX-2, MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 gene expression in human tendon cells, but also reduces the expression of tnmd and type I and III collagen in injured tendon–derived cells (25Tsuzaki M.

Interestingly, administration of a monoclonal anti-CD44 antibody IRAWB14 exacerbates the inflammatory signs in mice with proteoglycan-induced arthritis (27Mikecz K. Dennis K. Shi M. Kim J.H. Modulation of hyaluronan receptor (CD44) function in vivo in a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis.Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42 (10211879): 659-66810.1002/1529-0131(199904)42:4%3C659::AID-ANR8%3E3.0.CO;2-ZCrossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In our results, blocking CD44 using OX-50 down-regulates the expression of COL1A1, COL3A1, and tnmd (Fig. 3D), but up-regulates the expression of inflammatory mediators, such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and COX-2, in tenocytes from rats with Achilles tendinopathy (Fig. 4). In particular, the phosphorylated expression of NF-κB was up-regulated in OX-50–treated tenocytes (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, IL-1β had been reported to stimulate apoptosis in tendons (28Mobasheri A. Shakibaei M. Is tendinitis an inflammatory disease initiated and driven by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1β?.Histol. Histopathol. 2013; 28 (23463583): 955-96410.14670/HH-28.955PubMed Google Scholar). In our results, increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-1beta, was shown together with increased apoptosis in tenocytes from rats with tendinopathy after OX-50 treatment. Accordingly, our findings suggest that a positive feedback loop may exist as an IL-1–mediated mechanism through NF-κB activation in tendon diseases, and this loop can be broken down by disturbing the CD44 signaling pathways. MMPs, a large family of endopeptidases, have been reported be involved in tendinopathy, pain generation, and even tendon rupture due to their cleavage of ECM proteins (29Del Buono A. Oliva F. Longo U.G. Rodeo S.A. Orchard J. Denaro V. Maffulli N. Metalloproteases and rotator cuff disease.J.

MMPs has been proposed to be activated by inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-1β (28Mobasheri A. Shakibaei M. Is tendinitis an inflammatory disease initiated and driven by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1β?.Histol. Histopathol. 2013; 28 (23463583): 955-96410.14670/HH-28.955PubMed Google Scholar). The MMP-1, MMP-9, and MMP-13 expression levels are significantly higher in the human torn rotator cuffs than in the intact rotator cuffs (31Lakemeier S. Braun J. Efe T. Foelsch C.

MMP-3 is involved in the failure of normal matrix remodeling and in Achilles tendinopathy (32Lo I.K. Marchuk L.L. Hollinshead R. Hart D.A. Frank C.B.

Moreover, activation of CD44 using HA can down-regulate IL-6–induced MMP-13 expression in human OA osteoblasts (34Hiraoka N. Takahashi K.A. Arai Y. Sakao K. Mazda O. Kishida T. Honjo K. Tanaka S. Kubo T. Intra-articular injection of hyaluronan restores the aberrant expression of matrix metalloproteinase-13 in osteoarthritic subchondral bone.J. Orthop. Res. 2011; 29 (20886647): 354-36010.1002/jor.21240Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In our results, blocking CD44 using OX-50 down-regulated MMP-1, -3, -9, and -13 expression in tenocytes from rat Achilles tendons following collagenase injection (Fig. 4B). Our findings implied that CD44 might be involved in the ECM homeostasis via regulating MMP expression. This study has some limitations. First, an in vivo gene regulatory system should be applied to validate the CD44-induced anti-apoptotic effect in a tendinopathy animal model. Further studies using viral vectors to overexpress the CD44 gene in the tendinopathic animal model will be performed to confirm the role of CD44 in tendinopathy. Second, tenocytes suitable for a CD44 inhibition study should be primarily cultured from the tendinopathic tendons. However, tenocytes isolated from the tendinopathic tendons in a mature rat model are too old (usually more than 14 weeks old) to be primarily cultured according to our pilot study. 4P.-T. Wu, W.-R. Su, C.-L. Li, J.-L. Hsieh, C.-H. Ma, C.-L. Wu, L.-C. Kuo, I-M. Jou, and S.-Y. Chen, unpublished data. An alternative way was to use the primary tenocytes isolated from the rat Achilles tendon, which were injected with collagenase for 1 week. These tenocytes have higher expression levels of inflammatory mediators, MMP-1, MMP-3, α-SMA, and CD44 but lower levels of COL1A1 and COL1A3, demonstrating both tendinopathic and myofibroblastic characteristics (Fig. 2). Therefore, we suggested that this is an appropriate model to study the association of CD44 and tendinopathy. In conclusion, by using tendon specimens from patients with LHB tendinopathy and tenocytes from rats following collagenase injection, we demonstrated that blocking the CD44 signal pathway induces tenocyte apoptosis, decreases tenocyte viability and proliferation, and increases inflammatory cytokines and MMP expression. CD44 might play a role in tendinopathy via regulating apoptosis, inflammation, and ECM homeostasis. These findings provide a new approach to treating patients with tendinopathy. All of the experimental rats were purchased from the Animal Center at National Cheng Kung University, and the following animal experiments were done strictly in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of National Cheng Kung University (approval 105-156). The human study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of National Cheng Kung University Hospital (approval A-ER-106-063) and was done strictly in accordance with the approved guidelines. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. The human study abides by the Declaration of Helsinki principles. Fourteen consecutive patients (6 men, 8 women; mean age, 62.1 years; age range, 52–76 years) undergoing arthroscopic treatment for a rotator cuff tear and LHB tendinopathy at our university hospital were recruited. The tenodesis or tenotomy of LHB was done, and the pathological tendon area was harvested for the following histological examinations. The specimens were fixed in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde for 16–24 h at 4 °C and then subsequently dehydrated, paraffin-embedded, and longitudinally sectioned. Sequential 4-μm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined under a light microscope for changes in tenocyte morphology and collagen bundle characteristics. Based on our previous study (35Wu P.T. Jou I.M. Yang C.C. Lin C.J. Yang C.Y. Su F.C. Su W.R. The severity of the long head biceps tendinopathy in patients with chronic rotator cuff tears: macroscopic versus microscopic results.J.

According to the sum of scores, the tendinopathy was graded as 0–3 (0, ≤2, 3–4, or ≥5 points). The histological grading was assessed by two observers unaware of the clinical and arthroscopic conditions of the patients. If an inconsistency existed, the field was reassessed, and a final score was decided upon. The sections were deparaffinized in xylene, dehydrated in alcohol, epitope-unmasked by heating, washed with H2O2 in PBS, and stained with antibodies against CD44 (1:100; #37259, Cell Signaling Technology), in combination with the chromogen 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or subjected to the DeadEndTM colorimetric TUNEL system (#G7360, Promega). Cell lysates of OX-50 (10 μg/ml; #GTX76383, GeneTex)–treated tenocytes were subjected to immunoblot analyses with antibodies against phosphorylated AKT (1:1000; #9271, Cell Signaling), total AKT (1:1000; #9272, Cell Signaling), phosphorylated NF-κB (1:1000; #3033, Cell Signaling), total NF-κB (1:200; #SC-109, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), cleaved caspase-3 (1:500; #9664, Cell Signaling), caspase-3 (1:1000; #9662, Cell Signaling), MMP-1 (1:1000; #GTX00674, GeneTex), MMP-3 (1:1000; #14351, Cell Signaling), COL1A1 (1:1000; #GTX112731, GeneTex), COL3A1 (1:1000, #GTX26310, GeneTex), tenomodulin (1:1000; #bs-7525R, Bioss), and COX-2 (1:1000; #sc-1747, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in combination with a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch) and quantitative control anti-β-actin antibodies (1:10,000; #A3854, Sigma-Aldrich). The signal intensity in immunoblot analyses was further quantitated using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Cells with immunohistochemical stainings of TUNEL and CD44 were identified and counted in five high-power fields (×400) to determine the average percentages of TUNEL and CD44-positive cells corresponding to hematoxylin-stained total cells. For CD44 and TUNEL dual-immunofluorescence staining, paraffin-embedded sections receiving similar pretreatment were subjected to the DeadEndTM fluorometric TUNEL system (#G3250, Promega) and incubated with antibodies against CD44 (1:100; #37259, Cell Signaling), followed by Alexa Fluor 594–conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200; #A-11012, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Male Sprague–Dawley rats (4–6 weeks old) were purchased from LASCO (Taipei, Taiwan) and housed in the specific pathogen-free condition with a light/dark cycle of 12 h in the Animal Center of National Cheng Kung University (Tainan, Taiwan). Twenty-four rats were treated with ultrasound-guided intratendinous injection of collagenase I (1.5 mg/lambda, 10 lambda injection/rat, Sigma-Aldrich). One week after the index procedure, Achilles tendons were harvested after the rats had been killed with an overdose of isoflurane. The preparation of tendon samples and tenocyte culture methods are the same as in our previous study (15Wu P.T. Kuo L.C. Su F.C. Chen S.Y. Hsu T.I. Li C.Y. Tsai K.J. Jou I.M.

Well-characterized second-to-fourth passage cells were used in this experiment; they showed no phenotypic drift of major tenocyte markers, such as cell shape (elongated and spindle-shaped with apposition), and tenomodulin expression identified using anti-tenomodulin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described previously (15Wu P.T.

Furthermore, tenocytes were identified by their tendinopathic and myofibroblastic natures identified by detecting proliferative markers (COL1A1 and COL1A3), inflammatory mediators (IL-1β, IL-6, and COX-2), MMP-1, MMP-3, CD44, and α-SMA with qRT-PCR (Fig. 2). After treatment with OX-50 for 24 h, tenocytes were analyzed using WST-8 assay with measurement of absorbance at 450 nm. Cell viability was represented as the percentages normalized with the average WST-8 values of the control group. The DeadEndTM colorimetric TUNEL system (#G7360, Promega) was used for detecting apoptotic cells in OX-50–treated tenocytes according to the standard protocol. Total RNA from tenocytes was isolated with TRIzol reagents (#15596018, Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (#4368813, Applied Biosystems) for qRT-PCR by SYBR® Green PCR kit (#208054, Qiagen) with primer pairs specific to COL1A1 (forward, 5′-ATCAGCCCAAACCCCAAGGAGA-3′; reverse, 5′-CGCAGGAAGGTCAGCTGGATAG-3′), COL3A1 (forward, 5′-TGATGGGATCCAATGAGGGAGA-3′; reverse, 5′-GAGTCTCATGGCCTTGCGTGTTT-3′), tnmd (forward, 5′-CGCCACACCAGACAAGCA-3′; reverse, 5′-CCAGCATTGGGTCAAATTCA-3′), MMP-1 (forward, 5′-CATACTGTACTGAGAGGATTCCCCACAGA-3′; reverse, 5′-ACATCATCAACTTTATCGTCAATTCCAGG-3′), MMP-3 (forward, 5′-TCCCAGGAAAATAGCTGAGAACTT-3′; reverse, 5′-GAAACCCAAATGCTTCAAAGACA-3′), MMP-9 (forward, 5′-TACTTTGGAAACGCAAATGG-3′; reverse, 5′-GTGTAGAGATTCTCACTGGG-3′), MMP-13 (forward, 5′-CGTGTGGAGTTATGATGATG-3′; reverse, 5′-ATCTACTTTGTCGCCAATTC-3′), IL-1β (forward, 5′-CACCTCTCAAGCAGAGCACAG-3′; reverse, 5′-GGGTTCCATGGTGAAGTCAAC-3′), IL-6 (forward, 5′-CGAAAGTCAACTCCATCTGCC-3′; reverse, 5′-GGCAACTGGCTGGAAGTCTCT-3′), TNFα (forward, 5′-TGCCTCAGCCTCTTCTCATTCCT-3′; reverse, 5′-GAGCCCATTTGGGAACTTCTCC-3′), COX-2 (forward, 5′-CACGGACTTGCTCACTTTGTT-3′; reverse, 5′-AAGCGTTTGCGGTACTCATT-3′), α-SMA (forward, 5′-ATCCGATAGAACACGGCATCAT-3′; reverse, 5′-CATGGCAGGGACATTGAAGG-3′), CD44 (forward, 5′-AAGACATCGATGCCTCAAAC-3′; reverse, 5′-CTCCAGTAGGCTGTGAAGTG-3′), and GAPDH (forward, 5′-CCATCTTCCAGGAGCGAGATC-3′; reverse, 5′-GCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAA-3′). The comparative Ct method was used to calculate the relative abundance of each gene compared with GAPDH expression. Supernatants of tenocytes were subjected to ELISA for detecting the IL-6, TNFα, and IL-1β levels (R&D Systems). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance between two groups was analyzed using Student's t test because of the normal distribution of our data that was assessed using the SigmaPlot software). The correlation among CD44 expression, TUNEL-positive cell number, and the different histological grades of tendinopathy were analyzed using the Spearman correlation rank test. p < 0.05 was considered significant.

https://openalex.org/W2945863219,"Distributing learning across multiple layers has proven extremely powerful in artificial neural networks. However, little is known about how multi-layer learning is implemented in the brain. Here, we provide an account of learning across multiple processing layers in the electrosensory lobe (ELL) of mormyrid fish and report how it solves problems well known from machine learning. Because the ELL operates and learns continuously, it must reconcile learning and signaling functions without switching its mode of operation. We show that this is accomplished through a functional compartmentalization within intermediate layer neurons in which inputs driving learning differentially affect dendritic and axonal spikes. We also find that connectivity based on learning rather than sensory response selectivity assures that plasticity at synapses onto intermediate-layer neurons is matched to the requirements of output neurons. The mechanisms we uncover have relevance to learning in the cerebellum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex, as well as in artificial systems."

Clay minerals, such as smectite or kaolinite, are important adsorbents used in water treatment, and sufficient removal of antibiotics by clay minerals is expected. In this study, the adsorption of oxytetracycline (OTC) on kaolinite was investigated. The experimental data of OTC adsorption on kaolinite fit the pseudo-second-order kinetics model well (R2>0.98). After 24 h, adsorption equilibrium of OTC on kaolinite was reached. The Langmuir model was better fitting with the adsorption isotherms generated from experimental data and OTC adsorption occurred on the external surface of kaolinite. The analysis of several thermodynamic parameters indicated that the adsorption of OTC on kaolinite was spontaneous and thermodynamically favorable. With the increase of the pH of a solution, the adsorption capacity increased and then decreased. The adsorption coefficient (Kd) of 102-103 were obtained for adsorption process of OTC on kaolinite."
https://openalex.org/W2988943135,"The incremental theory of personality interventions (ITPI) teaches adolescents that people can change. Researchers have found that these interventions can reduce the perpetration of bullying and cyberbullying. Moreover, there is reciprocity between perpetrating bullying behaviors and being a victim of them. The objective of this study was to examine whether the ITPI reduces the reciprocity between victimization and perpetration of bullying and cyberbullying. A sample of 858 high school students (52% boys) aged 12 to 17 at pretest (M = 14.56, SD = 0.97) participated in a double-blind randomized controlled trial (452 participants were assigned to the experimental condition and 406 to the control condition). Measures of bullying and cyberbullying were taken at baseline, six-month, and 12-month follow-ups. The results indicated that victimization was a strong predictor of perpetration for bullying and cyberbullying over time. Perpetration was not a predictor of victimization. Consistently, for both forms of aggressive behavior, the intervention reduced the intensity of the association between victimization and perpetration. This effect was not moderated by the age or sex of the participants. Finally, the effectiveness of the ITPI was moderated by age. Specifically, among the youngest (< 14.48 years), those who received the ITPI showed a slight tendency to reduce aggressive behavior that contrasted with the growing trend in the control group. Among the oldest participants (> 14.48), the trajectories were similar in the two groups. Our findings show that influencing adolescents’ reactions to peer aggression victimization is one of the mechanisms that could explain the beneficial effects of the ITPI and other preventive interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2983801898,"The HECT E3 ligase family comprises three subfamilies: NEDD4 E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (NEDD4), HECT and RLD domain-containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (HERC), and ""other."" Most previous studies have focused on the NEDD4 subfamily. Apoptosis-resistant E3 ligase 1 (AREL1) belongs to ""other"" subfamily HECT that inhibits apoptosis by ubiquitinating and degrading proapoptotic proteins. Here, we report the crystal structure of the extended HECT domain of AREL1 (amino acids (aa) 436-823) at 2.4 Å resolution and its ubiquitination of the proapoptotic protein second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC). We found that the extended HECT domain adopts an inverted, T-shaped, bilobed conformation and harbors an additional loop (aa 567-573) absent in all other HECT members. We also show that the N-terminal extended region (aa 436-482) preceding the HECT domain is indispensable for its stability and activity and that without this region, the HECT domain becomes inactive. AREL1 ubiquitinated SMAC, primarily on Lys62 and Lys191 We solved the crystal structure of the tetrameric form of SMAC to 2.8 Å resolution, revealing the Lys62 and Lys191 locations. The AREL1 HECT domain assembled Lys33-, Lys48-, and Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. Moreover, E701A substitution in the AREL1 HECT domain substantially increased its autopolyubiquitination and SMAC ubiquitination activity, whereas deletion of the last three amino acids at the C terminus completely abrogated AREL1 autoubiquitination and reduced SMAC ubiquitination. Finally, an AREL1-specific ubiquitin variant inhibited SMAC ubiquitination in vitro Our findings may assist in the development of AREL1 inhibitors that block its anti-apoptotic activity in cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2989241750,"Background 
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is associated with an elevated vaginal pH and the presence of abnormal offensive discharge. It is common, often recurrent, and the most effective treatment regimen is unknown. ‘Metronidazole Versus lactic acId for Treating bacterial vAginosis’ (VITA) is a UK-based randomised controlled trial assessing clinical and cost-effectiveness of topical lactic acid gel compared to oral metronidazole antibiotic for treating second and subsequent BV episodes. Few BV trials report on women’s preferences for treatment in the context of their own experiences.


Method 
This qualitative study investigated the acceptability and tolerability of the two treatments. During the trial, semi-structured telephone interviews were undertaken between January—May 2018. A total of 33 women diagnosed with BV were consecutively sampled then interviewed from six sites across England. Thematic analysis was guided by the acceptability of health interventions framework. Potential causes of BV and its impact on women’s lives were explored in addition to women’s treatment preference and perceived treatment effectiveness.


Results 
Although women felt antibiotics treat BV effectively, and were associated with longer time periods between episodes, they generally preferred using the lactic acid gel because of ease of use, once daily application and less side-effects. Women would recommend the lactic acid gel to others for mild cases of BV but to take antibiotics when more severe. The risk of antibiotic drug resistance was a common concern. Self-help medicating or self-decision to not treat was also evident due to prior experience of poor outcomes from treatment. Triggers of BV were attributed to personal hygiene habits–soaps used to wash the vagina and sexual practices such as unprotected sex.


Conclusion 
Acceptability and preference for topical lactic acid gel or oral metronidazole tablets in the treatment of recurrent BV was affected by personal choice relating to affective attitude, burden, ethicality, intervention coherence, opportunity costs, and self-efficacy. These differed depending on ease of use, tolerability and past experiences, but not necessarily based on perceived drug effectiveness. Knowledge of a patient preference for topical lactic acid gel therapy despite lower perceived effectiveness may be useful for clinicians when making treatment decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2971925198,"Objectives To evaluate proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and T2* measurements of the liver with combined parallel imaging (sensitivity encoding, SENSE) and compressed sensing (CS) accelerated chemical shift encoding-based water-fat separation. Methods Six-echo Dixon imaging was performed in the liver of 89 subjects. The first acquisition variant used acceleration based on SENSE with a total acceleration factor equal to 2.64 (acquisition labeled as SENSE). The second acquisition variant used acceleration based on a combination of CS with SENSE with a total acceleration factor equal to 4 (acquisition labeled as CS+SENSE). Acquisition times were compared between acquisitions and proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and T2*-values were measured and compared separately for each liver segment. Results Total scan duration was 14.5 sec for the SENSE accelerated image acquisition and 9.3 sec for the CS+SENSE accelerated image acquisition. PDFF and T2* values did not differ significantly between the two acquisitions (paired Mann-Whitney and paired t-test P>0.05 in all cases). CS+SENSE accelerated acquisition showed reduced motion artifacts (1.1%) compared to SENSE acquisition (12.3%). Conclusion CS+SENSE accelerates liver PDFF and T2*mapping while retaining the same quantitative values as an acquisition using only SENSE and reduces motion artifacts."
https://openalex.org/W2983728827,"Metabolites play a significant role in various complex human disease. The exploration of the relationship between metabolites and diseases can help us to better understand the underlying pathogenesis. Several network-based methods have been used to predict the association between metabolite and disease. However, some methods ignored hierarchical differences in disease network and failed to work in the absence of known metabolite-disease associations. This paper presents a bi-random walks based method for disease-related metabolites prediction, called MDBIRW. First of all, we reconstruct the disease similarity network and metabolite functional similarity network by integrating Gaussian Interaction Profile (GIP) kernel similarity of diseases and GIP kernel similarity of metabolites, respectively. Then, the bi-random walks algorithm is executed on the reconstructed disease similarity network and metabolite functional similarity network to predict potential disease-metabolite associations. At last, MDBIRW achieves reliable performance in leave-one-out cross validation (AUC of 0.910) and 5-fold cross validation (AUC of 0.924). The experimental results show that our method outperforms other existing methods for predicting disease-related metabolites."

Here, we performed a chemical genetic screen based on the recovery of root growth in ethylene-related Arabidopsis mutants with constitutive “short root” phenotypes (eto1–2 and ctr1–1). We found that ponalrestat exposure recovers root elongation in these mutants in an ethylene signal–independent manner. Genetic and pharmacological investigations revealed that ponalrestat inhibits the enzymatic activity of the flavin-containing monooxygenase YUCCA, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the indole-3-pyruvic acid branch of the auxin biosynthesis pathway. In summary, our findings have identified a YUCCA inhibitor that may be useful as a chemical tool to dissect the distinct steps in auxin biosynthesis and in the regulation of root development.

https://openalex.org/W2987542861,"Circadian rhythmicity affects neuronal activity induced changes in the density of synaptic contacts and dendritic spines, the most common location of synapses, in mouse somatosensory cortex. In the present study we analyzed morphology of single- and double-synapse spines under light/dark (12:12) and constant darkness conditions. Using serial electron micrographs we examined the shape of spines (stubby, thin, mushroom) and their content (smooth endoplasmic reticulum, spine apparatus), because these features are related to the maturation and stabilization of spines. We observed significant diurnal and circadian changes in the shape of spines that are differentially regulated: single-synapse spines remain under circadian clock regulation, while changes of double-synapse spines are driven by light. The thin and mushroom single-synapse spines, regardless of their content, are more stable comparing with the stubby single-synapse spines that show the greatest diversity. All types of double-synapse spines demonstrate a similar level of stability. In light/dark regime, formation of new mushroom single-synapse spines occurs, while under constant darkness new stubby single-synapse spines are formed. There are no shape preferences for new double-synapse spines. Diurnal and circadian alterations also concern spine content: both light exposure and the clock influence translocation of smooth endoplasmic reticulum from dendritic shaft to the spine. The increasing number of mushroom single-synapse spines and the presence of only those mushroom double-synapse spines that contain spine apparatus in the light phase indicates that the exposure to light, a stress factor for nocturnal animals, promotes enlargement and maturation of spines to increase synaptic strength and to enhance the effectiveness of neurotransmission."
https://openalex.org/W2983192022,"The implementation and popularity of next generation sequencing (NGS) has led to the development of various rapid whole mitochondrial genome sequencing techniques. We summarise an efficient and cost-effective NGS approach for mitochondrial genomic DNA in humans using the Ion Torrent platform, and further discuss our bioinformatics pipeline for streamlined variant calling. Ion 316 chips were utilised with the Ion Torrent semi-conductor platform Personal Genome Machine (PGM) to perform tandem sequencing of mitochondrial genomes from the core pedigree (n = 315) of the Norfolk Island Health Study. Key improvements from commercial methods focus on the initial PCR step, which currently requires extensive optimisation to ensure the accurate and reproducible elongation of each section of the complete mitochondrial genome. Dual-platform barcodes were incorporated into our protocol thereby extending its potential application onto Illumina-based systems. Our bioinformatics pipeline consists of a modified version of GATK best practices tailored for mitochondrial genomic data. When compared with current commercial methods, our method, termed high throughput mitochondrial genome sequencing (HTMGS), allows high multiplexing of samples and the use of alternate library preparation reagents at a lower cost per sample (~1.7 times) when compared to current commercial methodologies. Our HTMGS methodology also provides robust mitochondrial sequencing data (>450X average coverage) that can be applied and modified to suit various study designs. On average, we were able to identify ~30 variants per sample with 572 variants observed across 315 samples. We have developed a high throughput sequencing and analysis method targeting complete mitochondrial genomes; with the potential to be platform agnostic with analysis options that adhere to current best practices."

Over the last two decades, conservation strategies including nest protection, head-starting and meso-predator control have been successfully adopted by the Lake County Forest Preserve District for a population of state-endangered Blanding’s turtles (Emydoidea blandingii) in Illinois. Only recently have efforts expanded to assess the effects of management action on turtle health. The objectives of this study were to 1) establish reference intervals for 16 hematologic and plasma biochemical analytes in free-ranging Blanding’s turtles, 2) characterize demographic and temporal drivers of clinical pathology values including age class, sex, month, and year, and 3) describe bloodwork differences between a managed (SBCP) and unmanaged (IBSP) study site. Hematology and plasma biochemistries were performed for 393 turtles from 2017–18 at two sites in the Lake Plain region. Subject or population-based reference intervals were established based on the index of individuality per American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology guidelines. Analytes differed by age class [packed cell volume (PCV), total solids (TS), total white blood cell counts (WBC), heterophils, lymphocytes, heterophil:lymphocyte ratio (H:L), total calcium (Ca), calcium:phosphorous (Ca:P), bile acids (BA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST)], sex [H:L, Ca, phosphorus (P), Ca:P, creatine kinase (CK)], month [eosinophils, H:L, Ca, P, uric acid (UA), AST], and year [PCV, WBC, lymphocytes, basophils, H:L, Ca, P, UA]. Several analytes also varied by site [PCV, TS, monocytes, eosinophils, P, UA, AST], suggesting that health status may be affected by habitat management or lack thereof. The results of this study provide a baseline for ongoing health assessments in this region as well as across the Blanding’s turtle range."
https://openalex.org/W2987181644,"Background Poor engagement in postpartum maternal HIV care is a challenge worldwide and contributes to adverse maternal outcomes and vertical transmission. Our objective was to project the clinical and economic impact of integrated postpartum maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART) and pediatric care in South Africa. Methods Using the CEPAC computer simulation models, parameterized with data from the Maternal and Child Health–Antiretroviral Therapy (MCH-ART) randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of integrated postpartum care for women initiating ART in pregnancy and their children. We compared two strategies: 1) standard of care (SOC) referral to local clinics after delivery for separate standard ART services for women and pediatric care for infants, and 2) the MCH-ART intervention (MCH-ART) of co-located maternal/pediatric care integrated in Maternal and Child Health (MCH) services throughout breastfeeding. Trial-derived inputs included: 12-month maternal retention in care and virologic suppression (SOC: 49%, MCH-ART: 67%), breastfeeding duration (SOC: 6 months, MCH-ART: 8 months), and postpartum healthcare costs for mother-infant pairs (SOC: $50, MCH-ART: $69). Outcomes included pediatric HIV infections, maternal and infant life expectancy (LE), lifetime HIV-related per-person costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs; ICER <US$903/YLS considered “cost-effective”). Results Compared to SOC, MCH-ART increased maternal LE (SOC: 25.26 years, MCH-ART: 26.20 years) and lifetime costs (SOC: $9,912, MCH-ART: $10,207; discounted). Projected pediatric outcomes for all HIV-exposed children were similar between arms, although undiscounted LE for HIV-infected children was shorter in SOC (SOC: 23.13 years, MCH-ART: 23.40 years). Combining discounted maternal and pediatric outcomes, the ICER was $599/YLS. Conclusion Co-located maternal HIV and pediatric care, integrated in MCH services throughout breastfeeding, is a cost-effective strategy to improve maternal and pediatric outcomes and should be implemented in South Africa."

https://openalex.org/W2986716475,"Mathematical models of cardiac cells have been established to broaden understanding of cardiac function. In the process of developing electrophysiological models for cardiac myocytes, precise parameter tuning is a crucial step. The membrane resistance (Rm) is an essential feature obtained from cardiac myocytes. This feature reflects intercellular coupling and affects important phenomena, such as conduction velocity, and early after-depolarizations, but it is often overlooked during the phase of parameter fitting. Thus, the traditional parameter fitting that only includes action potential (AP) waveform may yield incorrect values for Rm. In this paper, a novel multi-objective parameter fitting formulation is proposed and tested that includes different regions of the Rm profile as additional objective functions for optimization. As Rm depends on the transmembrane voltage (Vm) and exhibits singularities for some specific values of Vm, analyses are conducted to carefully select the regions of interest for the proper characterization of Rm. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II is utilized to solve the proposed multi-objective optimization problem. To verify the efficacy of the proposed problem formulation, case studies and comparisons are carried out using multiple models of human cardiac ventricular cells. Results demonstrate Rm is correctly reproduced by the tuned cell models after considering the curve of Rm obtained from the late phase of repolarization and Rm value calculated in the rest phase as additional objectives. However, relative deterioration of the AP fit is observed, demonstrating trade-off among the objectives. This framework can be useful for a wide range of applications, including the parameters fitting phase of the cardiac cell model development and investigation of normal and pathological scenarios in which reproducing both cellular and intercellular properties are of great importance."
https://openalex.org/W2987701885,"Proper mitotic spindle orientation requires that astral microtubules are connected to the cell cortex by the microtubule-binding protein NuMA, which is recruited from the cytoplasm. Cortical recruitment of NuMA is at least partially mediated via direct binding to the adaptor protein LGN. LGN normally adopts a closed conformation via an intramolecular interaction between its N-terminal NuMA-binding domain and its C-terminal region that contains four GoLoco (GL) motifs, each capable of binding to the membrane-anchored Gαi subunit of heterotrimeric G protein. Here we show that the intramolecular association with the N-terminal domain in LGN involves GL3, GL4, and a region between GL2 and GL3, whereas GL1 and GL2 do not play a major role. This conformation renders GL1 but not the other GL motifs in a state easily accessible to Gαi. To interact with full-length LGN in a closed state, NuMA requires the presence of Gαi; both NuMA and Gαi are essential for cortical recruitment of LGN in mitotic cells. In contrast, mInsc, a protein that competes with NuMA for binding to LGN and regulates mitotic spindle orientation in asymmetric cell division, efficiently binds to full-length LGN without Gαi and induces its conformational change, enhancing its association with Gαi. In nonpolarized symmetrically dividing HeLa cells, disruption of the LGN–NuMA interaction by ectopic expression of mInsc results in a loss of cortical localization of NuMA during metaphase and anaphase and promotes mitotic spindle misorientation and a delayed anaphase progression.

The cortical capture of astral microtubules is followed by the localization of the minus-end-directed motor protein complex dynein at the cell cortex. The movement of cortically anchored dynein on the astral microtubules toward the spindle poles is thought to generate pulling forces for correct positioning of the spindle poles and proper spindle orientation (5.di Pietro F.

Full-length LGN, in the closed structure, appears to marginally interact with NuMA and Gαi, compared with the isolated TPR domain and C-terminal region, respectively (8.Du Q. Macara I.G.

The Drosophila LGN-related protein Pins also forms a closed state via a similar intramolecular TPR–GL interaction (29.Nipper R.W. Siller K.H. Smith N.R. Doe C.Q. Prehoda K.E. Gαi generates multiple Pins activation states to link cortical polarity and spindle orientation in Drosophila neuroblasts.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Kimple R.J. Siderovski D.P. Return of the GDI: the GoLoco motif in cell division.Annu. Rev.

The first GL motif in Pins does not seem to be coupled to the intramolecular interaction, in contrast to the other two motifs; full-length Pins is capable of binding to Gαi via the first GL motif (29.Nipper R.W. Siller K.H. Smith N.R. Doe C.Q. Prehoda K.E. Gαi generates multiple Pins activation states to link cortical polarity and spindle orientation in Drosophila neuroblasts.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

On the other hand, in human LGN, all the four GL motifs are thought to be required for the intramolecular interaction (8.Du Q. Macara I.G. Mammalian Pins is a conformational switch that links NuMA to heterotrimeric G proteins.Cell. 2004; 119 (15537540): 503-51610.1016/j.cell.2004.10.028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 28.Pan Z.

The precise regulation of LGN, however, has not been well-understood. In the present study, we show that the intramolecular interaction with the TPR domain in LGN involves GL3, GL4, and a region between GL2 and GL3, whereas GL1 and GL2 do not play major roles. This conformation renders GL1 but not other GL motifs in a state easily accessible to Gαi. The TPR-binding protein mInsc efficiently interacts with full-length LGN and induces its conformational change to enhance the association with Gαi via GL motifs other than GL1. In contrast, NuMA, another target for LGN-TPR, requires the presence of Gαi for its binding to full-length LGN; both NuMA and Gαi are essential for cortical recruitment of LGN in mitotic cells. Disruption of the LGN–NuMA interaction by mInsc results in a loss of cortical localization of NuMA during metaphase and anaphase, which leads to mitotic spindle misorientation and a delayed anaphase progression. In LGN, the N-terminal TPR domain directly associates with the C-terminal region, which contains four copies of the GL motif, a conserved sequence of 19 amino acids (30.Willard F.S. Kimple R.J. Siderovski D.P. Return of the GDI: the GoLoco motif in cell division.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73 (15189163): 925-95110.1146/annurev.biochem.73.011303.073756Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). To precisely map a region required for the intramolecular interaction with the N-terminal domain (LGN-N, amino acids 13–414), we prepared a series of C-terminal fragments as MBP (maltose-binding protein)-fused protein and performed an MBP pulldown binding assay. As shown in Fig. 1B, a C-terminal fragment that lacks GL1 (amino acids 535–645) or both GL1 and GL2 (560–645) associated with LGN-N as strongly as the C-terminal region of LGN (LGN-C) that contains the four GL motifs (480–645). Thus, GL1 and GL2 do not seem to play a major role in the intramolecular interaction. On the other hand, further deletion of a region between GL2 and GL3 (560–580) resulted in an incomplete but severe loss of the interaction (Fig. 1B), indicating the significance of the region linking GL2 and GL3. The finding also suggests a significant role of GL3, GL4, or both in the intramolecular interaction in LGN. Indeed both regions are likely required, because a fragment lacking GL3 (619–645) or GL4 (560–611 or 581–611) was incapable of interacting with LGN-N (Fig. 1C). Taken together, GL3, GL4, and the linker region between GL2 and GL3 appear to participate in the intramolecular interaction with the N-terminal TPR domain. The present findings that GL3 and GL4 but not GL1 or GL2 play a major role in the intramolecular interaction of LGN (Fig. 1) raised the possibility that GDP-bound Gαi may access GL1 and/or GL2 more easily than GL3 and GL4 in full-length LGN (LGN-F, amino acids 1–677). To test this, we introduced mutations that led to a loss of binding to Gαi in both GL1 and GL2 or in both GL3 and GL4. It is well known that the Gαi-binding activity of the GL motif is almost completely lost by substitution of phenylalanine for arginine, which is the rearmost residue in the conserved 19 amino acid sequence of GL motifs (29.Nipper R.W.

Using purified full-length LGN proteins carrying mutated GL1/GL2 (LGN-F-mGL1/2 with the R501F/R556F substitution) and with mutated GL3/GL4 (LGN-F-mGL3/4 with the R606F/R640F substitution), we investigated their ability to bind to Gαi2–GDP. Although LGN-F-mGL1/2 failed to effectively bind to the GDP-bound form of Gαi2 (G204A), LGN-F-mGL3/4 interacted with Gαi2 (G204A) to a similar extent to WT LGN-F (Fig. 2A). Similarly, when WT and mutant LGN-F proteins were expressed as FLAG-tagged protein in HEK293 cells, EE-tagged Gαi2 was co-precipitated with LGN-F-mGL1/2 but to a lesser extent than that with LGN-F-mGL3/4 and with the WT protein (Fig. 2B). These findings suggest that GL1 and/or GL2 in full-length LGN is more easily accessible to Gαi2. The difference in the accessibility is not likely due to that in their Gαi2-binding activity. This is because, in contrast to full-length proteins, C-terminal fragments (amino acids 480–645) with the mutations (LGN-C-mGL1/2 and LGN-C-mGL3/4) interacted with Gαi2 (G204A) to the same extent (Fig. 2C), which is consistent with previous observations that four GL motifs of LGN each bind to Gαi with a similar affinity (26.McCudden C.R.

In addition, LGN-C-mGL1/2 and LGN-C-mGL3/4 associated with LGN-N as strongly as the WT protein (Fig. 2D), confirming that both R501F/R556F and R606F/R640F substitutions do not affect the intramolecular interaction in LGN. We next asked which is responsible for the easy Gαi accessibility, GL1 or GL2. As shown by an in vitro binding assay using purified protein, LGN-F-mGL2/3/4, in which GL1 is solely intact among the four motifs, associated with Gαi2 as effectively as the WT protein (Fig. 2E). In contrast, GL2, as well as GL3 and GL4, in full-length LGN was less effective in binding to Gαi2 (Fig. 2E). Also in HEK293 cells, LGN-F-mGL2/3/4 (with active GL1) bound more efficiently to Gαi2 than did LGN-F-mGL1/3/4 (with active GL2) (Fig. 2F). Thus, GL1 in full-length LGN is easily accessible to Gαi, indicating that GL1 is in a state capable of interacting with Gαi even in the presence of the intramolecular interaction. As shown here, among the four GL motifs in LGN, GL1 is in a state easily accessible to Gαi (Fig. 2). To further investigate the in vivo structure of LGN, we expressed mutant full-length LGN proteins with a single intact GL motif and the other three motifs inactivated. In MDCK cells overexpressing Gαi2, full-length LGN (wt) localized to the cell cortex (Fig. 3). On the other hand, LGN (wt) was distributed throughout the cytoplasm of parent MDCK cells (data not shown). These findings indicate that LGN by itself is capable of localizing to the cell cortex in the presence of enough amounts of Gαi on the plasma membrane. LGN-F-mGL2/3/4 (with active GL1) also localized to the cell cortex but to a lesser extent (Fig. 3), suggesting that GL1 is easily accessible to Gαi2 on the plasma membrane and that a single GL motif has an ability to localize LGN to the cell cortex. On the other hand, cortical localization was lost by inactivation of GL1 and any two of the other thr"
https://openalex.org/W2989344078,"Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is a mitochondrial protein that is expressed in both brown and beige adipocytes. UCP1 uncouples the mitochondrial electron transport chain from ATP synthesis to produce heat via non-shivering thermogenesis. Due to their ability to dissipate energy as heat and ameliorate metabolic disorders, UCP1-expressing adipocytes are considered as a potential target for anti-obesity treatment. To monitor the expression of UCP1 in live mice in a non-invasive manner, we generated the Ucp1-iRFP720 knock-in (Ucp1-iRFP720 KI) mice, in which the gene encoding a near-infrared fluorescent protein iRFP720 is inserted into the Ucp1 gene locus. Using the heterozygous Ucp1-iRFP720 KI mice, we observed robust iRFP fluorescence in the interscapular region where brown adipose tissue is located. Moreover, the iRFP fluorescence was clearly observable in inguinal white adipose tissues in live mice administered with β3-adrenergic receptor agonist CL316,243. We also found that the homozygous Ucp1-iRFP720 KI mice, which are deficient in UCP1, displayed prominent iRFP fluorescence in the inguinal regions at the standard housing temperature. Consistent with this, the mice exhibited expanded populations of beige-like adipocytes in inguinal white adipose tissue, in which the Ucp1 promoter was dramatically activated. Thus, the Ucp1-iRFP720 KI mice provide a convenient model for non-invasive in vivo imaging of UCP1 expression in both brown and beige adipocytes in live mice."
https://openalex.org/W2982937048,"Coral reefs are essential to millions of island inhabitants. Yet, coral reefs are threatened by thermal anomalies associated with climate change and by local disturbances that include land-use change, pollution, and the coral-eating sea star Acanthaster solaris. In combination, these disturbances cause coral mortality that reduce the capacity of reefs to produce enough carbonate to keep up with sea-level rise. This study compared the reef-building capacity of shallow-water inner, patch, and outer reefs in the two islands of Pohnpei and Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia. We identified which reefs were likely to keep up with sea-level rise under different climate-change scenarios, and estimated whether there were differences across habitats in the threshold of percentage coral cover at which net carbonate production becomes negative. We also quantified the influence of A. solaris on carbonate production. Whereas the northwestern outer reefs of Pohnpei and Kosrae had the highest net rates of carbonate production (18.5 and 16.4 kg CaCO3 m-2 yr-1, respectively), the southeastern outer reefs had the lowest rates of carbonate production (1.2–1.3 and 0.7 kg CaCO3 m-2 yr-1, respectively). The patch reefs of Pohnpei had on average higher net carbonate production rates (9.5 kg CaCO3 m-2 yr-1) than the inner reefs of both Pohnpei and Kosrae (7.0 and 7.8 kg CaCO3 m-2 yr-1, respectively). A. solaris were common on Kosrae and caused an average reduction in carbonate production of 0.6 kg CaCO3 m-2 yr-1 on Kosraean reefs. Northern outer reefs are the most likely habitats to keep up with sea-level rise in both Pohnpei and Kosrae. Overall, the inner reefs of Pohnpei and Kosrae need ~ 5.5% more coral cover to generate the same amount of carbonate as outer reefs. Therefore, inner reefs need special protection from land-use change and local pollution to keep pace with sea-level rise under all climate-change scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W2989521335,"Our aim was to understand how reviewers appraise mixed methods research by analyzing reviewer comments for grant applications submitted primarily to the National Institutes of Health. We requested scholars and consultants in the Mixed Methods Research Training Program (MMRTP) for the Health Sciences to send us summary statements from their mixed methods grant applications and obtained 40 summary statements of funded (40%) and unfunded (60%) mixed methods grant applications. We conducted a document analysis using a coding rubric based on the NIH Best Practices for Mixed Methods Research in the Health Sciences and allowed inductive codes to emerge. Reviewers favorably appraised mixed methods applications demonstrating coherence among aims and research design elements, detailed methods, plans for mixed methods integration, and the use of theoretical models. Reviewers identified weaknesses in mixed methods applications that lacked methodological details or rationales, had a high participant burden, and failed to delineate investigator roles. Successful mixed methods applications convey assumptions behind the methods chosen to accomplish specific aims and clearly detail the procedures to be taken. Investigators planning to use mixed methods should remember that reviewers are looking for both points of view."
https://openalex.org/W2982919379,"Soluble extracts prepared from Xenopus eggs have been used extensively to study various aspects of cellular and developmental biology. During early egg development, transcription of the zygotic genome is suppressed. As a result, traditional extracts derived from unfertilized and early stage eggs possess little or no intrinsic transcriptional activity. In this study, we show that Xenopus nucleoplasmic extract (NPE) supports robust transcription of a chromatinized plasmid substrate. Although prepared from eggs in a transcriptionally inactive state, the process of making NPE resembles some aspects of egg fertilization and early embryo development that lead to transcriptional activation. With this system, we observed that promoter-dependent recruitment of transcription factors and RNA polymerase II leads to conventional patterns of divergent transcription and pre-mRNA processing, including intron splicing and 3′ cleavage and polyadenylation. We also show that histone density controls transcription factor binding and RNA polymerase II activity, validating a mechanism proposed to regulate genome activation during development. Together, these results establish a new cell-free system to study the regulation, initiation, and processing of mRNA transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W2985795933,"Little is known about the molecular mechanisms of cognitive deficits in psychiatric disorders. CAMDI is a psychiatric disorder-related factor, the deficiency of which in mice results in delayed neuronal migration and psychiatrically abnormal behaviors. Here, we found that CAMDI-deficient mice exhibited impaired recognition memory and spatial reference memory. Knockdown of CAMDI in hippocampal neurons increased the amount of internalized alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptor (AMPAR) and attenuated the chemical long-term potentiation (LTP)-dependent cell surface expression of AMPAR. KIBRA was identified as a novel CAMDI-binding protein that retains AMPAR in the cytosol after internalization. KIBRA inhibited CAMDI-dependent Rab11 activation, thereby attenuating AMPAR cell surface expression. These results suggest that CAMDI regulates AMPAR cell surface expression during LTP. CAMDI dysfunction may partly explain the mechanism underlying cognitive deficits in psychiatric diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2986174787,"Humans are excellent at perceiving different features of the actions performed by others. For instance, by viewing someone else manipulating an unknown object, one can infer its weight-an intrinsic feature otherwise not directly accessible through vision. How such perceptual skill develops during childhood remains unclear. To confront this gap, the current study had children (N:63, 6-10 years old) and adults (N:21) judge the weight of objects after observing videos of an actor lifting them. Although 6-year-olds could already discriminate different weights, judgment accuracy had not reached adult-like levels by 10 years of age. Additionally, children's stature was a more reliable predictor of their ability to read others' actions than was their chronological age. This paper discusses the results in light of a potential link between motor development and action perception."
https://openalex.org/W2983981269,"UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) is an enzyme that is found in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and can reportedly have a large number of amino acid substitutions that result in the reduction of glucuronidation capacity. For example, adverse drug reactions when patients receive CPT-11 (irinotecan) such as in cancer chemotherapy are caused by amino acid substitutions in UGT1A1. We previously found that the extent of the docking when the hydroxyl residue of bilirubin was oriented toward UDP-glucuronic acid correlated with in vitro conjugation capacity. In this study, we analyzed the conformation of mutant UGT1A1s by means of structural optimization with water and lipid bilayers instead of the optimization in vacuo that we used in our previous study. We then derived a mathematical model that can predict the conjugation capacities of mutant UGT1A1s by using results of substrate docking in silico and results of in vitro analysis of glucuronidation of acetaminophen and 17β-estradiol by UGT1A1s. This experimental procedure showed that the in silico conjugation capacities of other mutant UGT1A1s with bilirubin or SN-38 were similar to reported in vitro conjugation capacities. Our results suggest that this experimental procedure described herein can correctly predict the conjugation capacities of mutant UGT1A1s and any substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2987639419,"Background In 2013, a tuberculosis (TB) outbreak occurred in a middle school in Henan province of China. An outbreak survey was carried out in the school. Objectives This study was undertaken to investigate the detection rate of TB cases and those with strong Mantoux positive (SMP), defined as tuberculin skin test (TST) indurations of 15mm or larger and/or blisters, necrosis or lymphangitis, and to identify their risk factors. Methods The TST, chest x-ray/radiography, and TB-suspicious symptoms interview were used to screen for TB cases. Their diagnosis was made by sputum smear microscopy, liquid culture, computed tomography (CT), and diagnostic therapy if necessary. We retrospectively analyzed the outbreak survey data of 4082 students and 278 staff in the school. Logistic regression models were used to identify the risk factors associated with SMP and TB disease. Results Approximately 3.55% of students and 16.55% of staff were SMP. SMP rate in students was significantly lower than that in staff (p<0.001). 55 TB cases in students and none in staff were identified in the school from February to November, 2013, with a detection rate of 1.35% for students. SMP and TB case detection rates were 20.29% and 41.77%, respectively, in the index class, both significantly higher than that in the other classes (3.26% and 0.55%, respectively; both p<0.001). In the index class, TB case detection rate over the study period in students with SMP was not significantly higher than that with TST indurations of <15mm (38.18% vs 21.43%, p = 0.24), but it was significantly higher in the other classes (7.81% vs 0.18%, p<0.001). Risk factors independently associated with SMP and TB cases shared the following with the index case: same dormitory-floor (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 5.36, 95% CI 3.02–9.48, p<0.001 for SMP; AOR 2.67; 95% CI 1.03–6.96, p = 0.044 for TB cases), same classroom (AOR 4.01; 95% CI 1.95–8.26, p<0.001 for SMP; AOR 165.08; 95% CI 66.88–407.47, p<0.001 for TB cases), same teaching-floor in different classroom (AOR 5.41; 95% CI 3.02–9.71, p<0.001 for SMP; AOR 11.24; 95% CI 3.71–34.03, p<0.001 for TB cases) and same teaching-building on different floor (AOR 1.81; 95% CI 1.16–2.85, p = 0.009 for SMP; AOR 3.30; 95% CI 1.16–9.42, p = 0.025 for TB cases). The closer the contact was with the index case, the larger the AORs for SMP and TB cases were. Conclusion Same dormitory-floor, same classroom, same teaching-floor and same teaching-building with the index case were all risk factors for both TB infection and disease for students in the outbreak, and the closer the contact was with the index case, the higher the risk was observed. Attention should also be paid to students with TST indurations <15mm, as well as to those with that ≥15mm for the index class in dealing with the outbreak."
https://openalex.org/W2988037464,"Two membrane-intercalating conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs), namely COE-D8 and COE-S6, were combined to achieve enhanced antimicrobial efficacy. COE-D8 has a shorter molecular length than COE-S6 and is typical of effective antimicrobial COE molecules, presumably due to its prominent membrane disrupting function. In contrast, COE-D6 exhibits lower efficacy against bacteria and lower toxicity toward mammalian cells. Surprisingly, after supplementing 8 μM COE-S6, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of COE-D8 against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was improved 8-fold, from 0.5 μM to 0.063 μM (0.050 μg mL-1). No increased toxicity toward mammalian cells was observed by the combination of COEs, as indicated by cytotoxicity measurements using the 3T3 cell line. Indeed, there is an extended ratio between the half maximal inhibitory concentration based on 3T3 cells to MIC against MRSA from 12 to greater than 256. Biophysical experiments using liposome models suggest that COE-S6 promotes the interactions between COE-D8 and lipid bilayers, which is in agreement with damages of cellular permeability and morphology, as observed by confocal microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The application of a combined mixture of COEs further demonstrates their promising potential as a new class of antimicrobial agents with high efficacy and selectivity."

A focus group was carried out with each professional group. One focus group included six general practitioners and the other included six physiotherapists. The focus groups were based on a semi-structured interview schedule, audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis was conducted.The participants explored aspects related to the acceptability of the SPLIT project, emphasising the satisfactory amount of effort that is expected to be required for its implementation. Potential facilitators to the implementation of the model were identified, such as the participants`motivation. Potential barriers were also explored, with particular emphasis on the challenges related to the change of routine care. Lastly, the need for particular adjustments in the health services was also highlighted.This study`s participants highlighted the feasibility and acceptability of the SPLIT project. The identification of potential barriers and facilitators to its implementation also attained major relevance to better prepare the upcoming implementation of this project. The generalizability of findings to the larger population of relevant practitioners is limited, since only two focus groups were carried out. Therefore, this study`s findings should be considered in terms of transferability to contexts that may have some similarities to the context where the study was carried out."
https://openalex.org/W2983865963,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was classified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2014 as the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States (US). The main cause of COPD is exposure to tobacco smoke and air pollutants. Problems associated with COPD include under-diagnosis of the disease and an increase in the number of smokers worldwide. The goal of our study is to identify disease variability in the gene expression profiles of COPD subjects compared to controls, by reanalyzing pre-existing, publicly available microarray expression datasets. Our inclusion criteria for microarray datasets selected for smoking status, age and sex of blood donors reported. Our datasets used Affymetrix, Agilent microarray platforms (7 datasets, 1,262 samples). We re-analyzed the curated raw microarray expression data using R packages, and used Box-Cox power transformations to normalize datasets. To identify significant differentially expressed genes we used generalized least squares models with disease state, age, sex, smoking status and study as effects that also included binary interactions, followed by likelihood ratio tests (LRT). We found 3,315 statistically significant (Storey-adjusted q-value <0.05) differentially expressed genes with respect to disease state (COPD or control). We further filtered these genes for biological effect using results from LRT q-value <0.05 and model estimates' 10% two-tailed quantiles of mean differences between COPD and control), to identify 679 genes. Through analysis of disease, sex, age, and also smoking status and disease interactions we identified differentially expressed genes involved in a variety of immune responses and cell processes in COPD. We also trained a logistic regression model using the common array genes as features, which enabled prediction of disease status with 81.7% accuracy. Our results give potential for improving the diagnosis of COPD through blood and highlight novel gene expression disease signatures."

We therefore sought to investigate the prognostic significance of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia on stored electrograms in pacemaker recipients.We enrolled patients implanted with dual chamber pacemaker for atrioventricular block or sinus node dysfunction from 2010 to 2016, with LVEF> 45%, older than 18 years, with at least 3 device interrogations at follow-up. Data were collected about medical history, pharmacological therapy at implantation, pacemaker programming, NS-VT occurrence, long-term survival.A total of 308 patients were included in the final analysis, with median follow-up time of 56 months. No ventricular arrhythmic episodes were documented in 221 patients (Group 1), whereas 87 had at least 1 episode of NS-VT during follow-up (Group 2). As a whole, 282 episodes of NS-VT were documented. There was a higher prevalence of previous myocardial infarction and slightly lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in Group 2. The primary endpoint (all-cause mortality) occurred in 50 patients (22%) of Group 1 and 12 (14%) patients of Group 2 (p = 0.07). Clinical predictors of all-cause mortality at univariate analysis included age, LVEF and coronary artery disease (CAD). Only age and CAD, however, remained as predictors of mortality at multivariable analysis. A sizeable, but not statistically significant, portion of patients who died had a de novo occurrence of NS-VT at the last pacemaker check.Our data do not support a prognostic role for the detection of NS-VT during pacemaker controls."
