https://openalex.org/W1981719480,"Although long considered to be of marginal importance to global climate change, tropospheric aerosol contributes substantially to radiative forcing, and anthropogenic sulfate aerosol in particular has imposed a major perturbation to this forcing. Both the direct scattering of shortwavelength solar radiation and the modification of the shortwave reflective properties of clouds by sulfate aerosol particles increase planetary albedo, thereby exerting a cooling influence on the planet. Current climate forcing due to anthropogenic sulfate is estimated to be -1 to -2 watts per square meter, globally averaged. This perturbation is comparable in magnitude to current anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing but opposite in sign. Thus, the aerosol forcing has likely offset global greenhouse warming to a substantial degree. However, differences in geographical and seasonal distributions of these forcings preclude any simple compensation. Aerosol effects must be taken into account in evaluating anthropogenic influences on past, current, and projected future climate and in formulating policy regarding controls on emission of greenhouse gases and sulfur dioxide. Resolution of such policy issues requires integrated research on the magnitude and geographical distribution of aerosol climate forcing and on the controlling chemical and physical processes."
https://openalex.org/W1965129842,"An x-ray examination of more than 150 specimens of fine-grained quartz varieties from around the world has revealed that more than 10% and as much as 80% of the silica in many samples is actually moganite, a little-known silica polymorph. Rietveld refinements of 50 powder x-ray diffraction patterns produced by fibrous quartz (agate, chalcedony) and nonfibrous quartz (chert, flint) indicate that the concentrations of moganite within each subgroup are widely distributed. The large amount of moganite (>30%) found in cherts from arid, alkaline environments may resurrect length-slow silica as an indicator of evaporitic regimes, and the absence of moganite in weathered and hydrothermally altered silica samples may be a useful measure of fluid-rock interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1970672371,"Quartz grains that appear to have been shock-metamorphosed occur within three closely spaced shale beds from the uppermost Triassic (""Rhaetian"") Calcare a Rhaetavicula in the Northern Apennines of Italy. The upper shale coincides with the abrupt termination of the distinctive, uppermost Triassic Rhaetavicula fauna and is overlain by the Hettangian (Lower Jurassic) Calcare Massiccio; no extinctions appear to be associated with the two lower layers, which occur 1.2 and 2.4 meters below the boundary shale. Approximately 5 to 10% of the quartz grains within these layers exhibit one or more sets of planar deformational features whose orientations cluster around the rational crystallographic planes (basal, omega, and pi) most commonly observed in shocked quartz. Textural and stratigraphic observations support an interpretation of at least three closely spaced impacts at the end of the Triassic."
https://openalex.org/W2077549327,"The development of an optically transparent yet electrically conductive material made with a composite structure having preferentially arranged conductive paths is described. The medium contains many vertically aligned but laterally isolated chains of ferromagnetic spheres dispersed in a sheet of transparent polymer. The sheet material transmits more than 90 percent of the incident light and is highly conductive only in the thickness direction. When suitably modified, the material exhibits on-off electrical switchability at a certain threshold pressure. These characteristics confer potential usefulness for visual communication devices such as write pads or touch-sensitive screens."

A definitive answer is not forthcoming, but a wealth of relevant information is provided. Topics considered include the status of the innovative, dedicated biotechnology companies and their newly created pharmaceutical products, of agricultural research, and of use of the new technologies in the chemical industry and bioremediation. The report also deals with matters affecting competition such as patents, fair trade practices, protection of intellectual property, regularity climate, and tax policies. For many scientists the most interesting portions of the document will be those dealing with the experience of the many biotechnology companies that were established to exploit opportunities created by recombinant DNA techniques and development of monoclonal antibodies. Although the biotechnology companies were founded with great resources of human capital, they had limited numbers of dollars. Only a small fraction of the companies obtained funds from stock offerings. The OTA report names 46 companies listed on the various securities exchanges. All of the companies have experienced a big drainmore » of funds as they worked to develop new products. As a result, the companies have been forced to scramble four funds to stay alive.« less"
https://openalex.org/W2070803216,"This year, for the first time, weather forecasters used signs of a warming in the tropical Pacific as the basis for a long-range prediction of winter weather patterns across the United States. Now forecasters are talking about the next step: stretching the lead time for such forecasts by a year or more. That seems feasible because although this Pacific warming was unmistakable by the time forecasters at the National Weather Service's Climate Analysis Center (CAC) in Camp Springs, Maryland, issued their winter forecast, the El Nino itself had been predicted almost 2 years in advance by a computer model. Next time around, the CAC may well be listening to the modelers and predicting El Nino-related patterns of warmth and flooding seasons in advance."

https://openalex.org/W1987449995,"FROM about 1900 until 1904 fears were expressed that the Great Salt Lake was doomed to extinction, and that it would be a matter of only a few years until its site would become a salt desert. The recession of the shore line and sinking of the lake level continued until the autumn of 1903. Since that time there has been a rise in the level of the lake, and during the year just ending new fears have arisen-fears that large engineering works like the Lucin cut-off of the Southern Pacific and the roadbed of the Western Pacific railroad would have to be abandoned. A succession of years with abnormally high rainfall is responsible for the condition now existing."

https://openalex.org/W4210715622,"Table 3 in the report ""Latitudinal and longitudinal oscillations of cloud features on Neptune"" by Lawrence A. Sromovsky (1 Nov., p. 684) contained errors. In column 4, the two values for inferred shear should have been -0.8 and -13.8 m/(s-deg), respectively. The corresponding text in column 1 on page 686 should have read, ""the advection model is quantitatively upheld for the DS2 motions, but not for the short-period component of the GDS motions. They both agree on phase lags, although the GDS is not in good quantitative agreement on amplitudes. Relative to a smooth shear profile obtained from a simple polynomial fit to the observed wind speeds as a function of latitude (11), the shear derived from the advective model amplitude ratio is almost the same for DS2, but a ninth as large for the GDS."""
