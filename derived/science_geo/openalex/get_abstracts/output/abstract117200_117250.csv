Here, we show that peptides incorporating a short Aβ fragment (KLVFF; Aβ) can bind full-length Aβ and prevent its assembly into amyloid fibrils. Through alanine substitution, it was demonstrated that amino acids Lys, Leu, and Phe are critical for binding to Aβ and inhibition of Aβ fibril formation. A mutant Aβ molecule, in which these residues had been substituted, had a markedly reduced capability of forming amyloid fibrils. The present data suggest that residues Aβ serve as a binding sequence during Aβ polymerization and fibril formation. Moreover, the present KLVFF peptide may serve as a lead compound for the development of peptide and non-peptide agents aimed at inhibiting Aβ amyloidogenesis in vivo.

The preeminent neuropathological feature of Alzheimer's disease is the deposition of amyloid in the brain parenchyma and cerebrovasculature(1.Selkoe D.J.

The basic components of the amyloid are thin fibrils of a peptide termed Aβ(3.Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Genetic and neuropathological studies provide strong evidence for a central role of Aβ amyloid in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease(6.Selkoe D.J. J. Neuropathol. Exp.

However, it has been suggested that Aβ polymers and amyloid are toxic to neurons, either directly or via induction of radicals, and hence cause neurodegeneration(7.Behl C. Davis J.B. Lesley R.

Previous studies indicate that Aβ polymerization in vivo and in vitro is a specific process that probably involves interactions between binding sequences in the Aβ peptide(10.Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, 11.Näslund J. Schierhorn A. Hellman U. Lannfelt L. Roses A.D. Tjernberg L.O. Silberring J. Gandy S.E.

Terenius L. Nordstedt C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A rational pharmacological approach for prevention of amyloid formation would therefore be to use drugs that specifically interfere with Aβ-Aβ interaction and polymerization. We hypothesized that ligands capable of binding to and blocking such sequences might inhibit amyloid fibril formation as outlined schematically in Fig. 1. Our strategy in searching for an Aβ ligand was to identify binding sequences in Aβ and then, based on their primary structures, synthesize a peptide ligand. Binding sequences were identified by systematically synthesizing short peptides corresponding to sequences of the Aβ molecule. The minimum length of an identified binding sequence was determined by truncating the peptide. Residues critical for binding were identified by alanine scanning. These critical residues were then substituted in an Aβ fragment (Aβ) that normally is capable of forming amyloid fibrils (13.Kirschner D.A. Inouye H. Duffy L.K. Sinclair A. Lind M. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6953-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 14.Barrow C.J. Zagorski M.G. Science. 1991; 253: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) in order to determine if they indeed are important for Aβ amyloid fibril formation. Finally, it was determined if the identified ligand, in addition to binding to the Aβ molecule, was capable of inhibiting fibril formation of Aβ. Synthetic Aβ and all other soluble peptides were synthesized by Fmoc chemistry. Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents were from Sigma. I-Aβ was iodinated using the Bolton-Hunter technique. Following the reaction, the iodinated peptide was purified on a Vydac C-4 RPLC column (0.21 × 15 cm) using a solvent system containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (buffer A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 100% acetonitrile (buffer B)(15.Nordstedt C. Näslund J. Tjernberg L.O. Karlström A.R. Thyberg J. Terenius L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30773-30776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The technique used is essentially identical with the SPOT technique described by Frank(16.Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 42: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Briefly, cellulose membranes (Whatman 1Chr) were derivatized with N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide-activated β-alanine. A spacer, consisting of a β-alanine dipeptide, was coupled to derivatized cellulose membranes. The indicated peptides were then synthesized using Fmoc-protected and pentafluorophenyl-activated amino acids dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidone. Coupling efficiency was monitored using bromphenol blue. Following blocking of the cellulose membranes with 0.05% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), they were incubated in the presence of 20 μMI-labeled Aβ at 20°C for 12 h in TBS, pH 7.4, supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin. Subsequently, the cellulose membranes were washed repeatedly in the same buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl and dried. Radioactivity bound to the cellulose membrane was visualized by autoradiography and quantitated using densitometry. In experiments aimed at investigating the strength of the binding between soluble I-Aβ and immobilized peptides, the cellulose membranes were washed sequentially in 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.4 (overnight at 20°C), 6 M urea, pH 7.4 (3 h at 20°C), 9 M urea, pH 11 (6 h at 20°C). The efficiency of each washing step was monitored by autoradiography. BIAcore 2000 (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Sweden) was used for real-time studies based on surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. The peptide was immobilized using thiol coupling. The running buffer consisted of 10 mM HEPES, 0.15 M NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA, and 0.05% surfactant P20 as described by the manufacturer. Peptides at the indicated concentrations were incubated in TBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.02% NaN for 24-48 h. The incubations were terminated by separation of aggregated and soluble peptide by centrifugation at 20,000 × g. Soluble peptide was quantitated by RPLC as described above, whereas aggregated peptide was analyzed by electron microscopy. Synthetic polypeptides were prepared for electron microscopy by placing 5 μl of the polymerized and nonpolymerized peptide solutions on grids covered by a carbon-stabilized formvar film. After 2-3 min, excess fluid was removed with a filter paper, and the grids were then negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate in water. The specimens were finally examined and photographed in a JEOL EM 100CX at 60 kV. We first synthesized the 31 possible 10-mers corresponding to amino acids 1-10 up to 31-40 of the Aβ molecule on a cellulose membrane matrix (16.Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 42: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 17.Edlund M. Blikstad I. Öbrink B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1393-1399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The Aβ fragments capable of binding full-length Aβ were identified by radioligand binding. Cellulose membrane-bound peptides were incubated with I-Aβ overnight. Following washing of the cellulose membrane in high-salt buffer, bound radioactivity was quantitated by autoradiography and densitometry (Fig. 2). The measured binding should be interpreted as semiquantitative, since the coupling efficiency during synthesis, and therefore the amount of peptide per spot, may vary. A region located in the central part of Aβ (Aβ to Aβ) displayed prominent binding of radioactive Aβ. Another binding region was the hydrophobic C terminus of the molecule(18.Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but binding here was considerably less prominent. The binding between Aβ and the Aβ fragments on the cellulose membrane matrix was strong. In order to obtain dissociation, it was necessary to incubate the cellulose membranes in 9 M urea, pH 11. Incubation in 6 M urea at pH 7.4 did not induce any measurable dissociation (data not shown, see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Being located in the center of the binding region, Aβ was selected for further studies of the structural requirements for binding. This peptide, as well as N- and C-terminally truncated fragments, were synthesized using the same technique as described previously (Fig. 3A). The shortest peptide still displaying consistent high Aβ binding capacity had the sequence KLVFF (corresponding to Aβ). In order to confirm binding between Aβ and the KLVFF peptide, it was decided to study this interaction in an additional test system. Surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy is a technique suitable for real-time studies of molecular interactions(19.Jansson U. Malmqvist M. Adv. Biosens. 1992; 2: 291-336Google Scholar). By adding a cysteine residue via a linker of two β-alanine residues to the C terminus of AcKLVFF, the peptide could be attached through a disulfide bond to the sensor chip of the surface plasmon resonance spectroscope. As control for nonspecific binding, cysteine alone was coupled to another channel of the sensor chip. A solution of Aβ was injected onto the sensor chip. Aβ was found to bind to the AcKLVFF peptide and not nonspecifically to the sensor chip (Fig. 3B). By systematically substituting the amino acid residues in the KLVFF sequence with alanine, we found that the first, second, and fifth residues (i.e. KLXXF) were critical for binding (Fig. 4). To investigate if the KLXXF motif was required for Aβ polymerization, we synthesized Aβ, a well-studied Aβ fragment that readily forms amyloid fibrils(13.Kirschner D.A. Inouye H. Duffy L.K. Sinclair A. Lind M. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6953-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), and mutated Aβ in which the KLVFF sequence was substituted with AAVFA (Aβ). After incubation of Aβ at a concentration of 200 μM for 24 h at 37°C, only a small fraction was present as soluble peptide in the supernatant, whereas large fibril bundles were observed in the pellet (Fig. 5, A and C). The substituted peptide, Aβ, showed different properties. A large fraction was still present in soluble form after incubation, and only a few dispersed fibrils were found in the pellet (Fig. 5, B and D). The conclusions from these experiments were that the substitutions profoundly impair the ability of the peptide to aggregate and form amyloid-like fibrils.Figure 5Aggregation and fibril formation of wild type and substituted Aβ. Wild type Aβ (A and C) and Aβ (B and D) were incubated at 200 μM in TBS for 24 h at 37°C in a shaking water bath. After incubation, the tubes were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The content of nonaggregated peptide in the supernatants (A and B) was analyzed using an established C-4 RPLC system, whereas the aggregated peptides in the pellets were analyzed by electron microscopy after adsorption to formvar-coated grids and negative staining with 2% uranyl acetate in water (C and D; scale bars, 100 nm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Incubation of synthetic Aβ at 100 μM for 48 h at 37°C in TBS, led to polymerization of the peptide and formation of amyloid fibrils arranged in parallel in densely packed bundles (Fig. 6A), as shown previously(15.Nordstedt C. Näslund J. Tjernberg L.O. Karlström A.R. Thyberg J. Terenius L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30773-30776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When Aβ was coincubated with AcQKLVFFNH, at equimolar concentrations, this type of fibril bundles did not form. Instead, only a few occasional fibrils embedded in a diffuse background of small rod-like aggregates, similar to those formed by AcQKLVFFNH itself (not shown), could be detected (Fig. 6B). In conclusion, the present Aβ ligand does not form amyloid-like fibrils per se, but it is capable of binding to, and inhibiting formation of, amyloid-like fibrils of the full-length form of the Aβ peptide. The aim of the present study was to identify regions in the Aβ molecule being important for binding during polymerization and, based on the structure of such a binding sequence, synthesize a small peptide ligand capable of binding to full-length Aβ and inhibiting its polymerization into amyloid fibrils. The binding sequence identified in the present study is located in a region of the Aβ molecule that previously has been shown to be important during proteolytic processing of APP. During nonamyloidogenic processing of APP (i.e. α-secretase cleavage), the molecule is cleaved between amino acid residues Lys and Leu(20.Esch F.S. Keim P.S. Beattie E.C. Blacher R.W. Culwell A.R. Oltersdorf T. McClure D. Ward P.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1122-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). This leads, after further processing, to the formation of an Aβ fragment termed p3, corresponding to Aβ or Aβ(21.Haass C. Hung A.Y. Schlossmacher M.G. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Through this metabolic pathway, the present binding sequence is disrupted. This may explain why p3 is not capable of forming amyloid in vitro or in vivo(11.Näslund J. Schierhorn A. Hellman U. Lannfelt L. Roses A.D. Tjernberg L.O. Silberring J. Gandy S.E. Winblad B. Greengard P. Nordstedt C. Terenius L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8378-8382Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 12.Näslund J. Jensen M. Tjernberg L.O. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, experimental studies show that p3 is capable of forming fibril-like structures in vitro(12.Näslund J. Jensen M. Tjernberg L.O. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is therefore highly probable that binding sequences other than the KLVFF sequence are involved in Aβ and p3 polymerization. The C terminus of the Aβ peptide may be of great importance in that respect (10.Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, 18.Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies of putative inhibitors of amyloid fibril formation showed that cyclodextrins (22.Camilleri P. Haskins N.J. Howlett D.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 256-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and Congo red (23.Lorenzo A. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12243-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar) may have such properties. The usefulness of these molecules as lead substances in development of anti-Alzheimer amyloid drugs is, however, compromised by their lack of specificity. Cyclodextrins have primarily been used to increase the solubility of a wide range of drugs, and it is unlikely that they will display any specificity for Aβ in vivo. Congo red, which is used to detect amyloid histochemically, binds to a wide array of non-Aβ amyloids as well as to other proteins with a high content of β-pleated sheet structures(24.Turnell W.G. Finch J.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 1205-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Due to the extreme insolubility of Aβ amyloid (strong chaotropic agents or potent organic solvents are required for its dissolution (4.Masters C.L. Simms G. Weinman N.A. Multhaup G. McDonald B.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar)), the concept of breaking up amyloid deposits in situ under physiological conditions may seem futile. However, the bulk of the individual molecules in amyloid are probably not joined by covalent bonds, and the deposition of Aβ into amyloid is, at least at some stages, a dynamic and reversible process(25.Maggio J.E. Stimson E.R. Ghilardi J.R. Allen C.J. Dahl C.E. Whitcomb D.C. Vigna S.R. Vinters H.V. Labenski M.E. Mantyh P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5462-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Hence, a molecule capable of binding to a site in the Aβ molecule being critical for fibril formation, and with an affinity higher than native Aβ, may inhibit amyloid growth and possibly also specifically dissolve amyloid fibrils in situ. Previous studies suggest that amino acid residues within or close to Aβ are important for the adoption of the correct β-pleated sheet structure of Aβ (26.Hilbich C. Kisters-Woike B. Reed J. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 460-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 27.Wood S.J. Wetzel R. Martin J.D. Hurle M.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and the proteolytic processing of its precursor(20.Esch F.S. Keim P.S. Beattie E.C. Blacher R.W. Culwell A.R. Oltersdorf T. McClure D. Ward P.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1122-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Here, it was shown that this region harbors a binding sequence required for the polymerization of Aβ into amyloid fibrils. It was also demonstrated that short peptides incorporating Aβ can function as ligands that bind to Aβ and inhibit the formation of amyloid fibrils. Since these peptide ligands are relatively small, they are amenable to investigation using organic chemistry. Non-peptide homologues of KLVFF may thus turn out to be useful as pharmacological tools for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in the future. We thank Drs. Magnus Edlund and Björn öbrink, Karolinska Institute, and Samuel E. Gandy, Cornell Medical College, NY, for stimulating discussions and reviewing the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2136545895,"The biochemical properties of the mitochondrial K channel are very similar to those of plasma membrane K channels, including inhibition by low concentrations of ATP and glyburide (Paucek, P., Mironova, G., Mahdi, F., Beavis, A. D., Woldegiorgis, G., and Garlid, K. D.(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 26062-26069). Plasma membrane K channels are highly sensitive to the family of drugs known as K channel openers, raising the question whether mitochondrial K channels are similarly sensitive to these agents. We addressed this question by measuring K flux in intact rat liver mitochondria and in liposomes containing K channels purified from rat liver and beef heart mitochondria. K channel openers completely reversed ATP inhibition of K flux in both systems. In liposomes, ATP-inhibited K flux was restored by diazoxide (K = 0.4 μM), cromakalim (K = 1 μM), and two developmental cromakalim analogues, EMD60480 and EMD57970 (K = 6 nM). Similar K values were observed in intact mitochondria. These potencies are well within the range observed with plasma membrane K channels. We also compared the potencies of these K channel openers on the plasma membrane K channel purified from beef heart myocytes. The K channel from cardiac mitochondria is 2000-fold more sensitive to diazoxide than the channel from cardiac sarcolemma, indicating that two distinct receptor subtypes coexist within the myocyte. We suggest that the mitochondrial K channel is an important intracellular receptor that should be taken into account in considering the pharmacology of K channel openers.

As described in several excellent reviews(1.Cook N.S. Quast U. Cook N.S. Potassium Channels. Ellis Horwood Ltd., Chichester, UK1990: 181-231Google Scholar, 2.Escande D. Henry H. Eur.

Thus, cell membrane K channels (cellK) in different tissues are considered to mediate the hypotensive and diabetogenic effects of diazoxide (4.Quast U. Cook N.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

In the first reports of KCO actions in mitochondria, Belyaeva et al.(6.Belyaeva E.A. Szewczyk A. Mikolajek B. Nalecz M.J. Wojtczak L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 493-500PubMed Google Scholar) and Szewczyk et al.(7.Szewczyk A. Wojcik G. Nalecz M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) observed stimulation of K uptake by KCOs in respiring mitochondria. RP66471 was the most potent KCO studied (K = 50 μM), whereas P1060 and diazoxide were only weakly active at 700 μM. Because these concentrations are much higher than K values observed with cellK(1.Cook N.S. Quast U. Cook N.S. Potassium Channels. Ellis Horwood Ltd., Chichester, UK1990: 181-231Google Scholar), these results appear to imply that mitochondrial actions of KCOs are not pharmacologically important. We now report that diazoxide, cromakalim, and two experimental benzopyran derivatives are very potent activators of K flux through ATP-inhibited mitoK, with K values similar to those observed with cellK. KCO activation of K flux was observed in both intact mitochondria and proteoliposomes containing reconstituted mitoK. No effect was observed on uninhibited K flux, which likely explains the low potencies observed by previous workers (6.Belyaeva E.A. Szewczyk A. Mikolajek B. Nalecz M.J. Wojtczak L. Biochem. Mol.

We also found that mitoK and cellK from beef heart differed strongly in their sensitivity to diazoxide, indicating distinct receptor subtypes among K channels from the same cell. Our results indicate that mitoK may be an important intracellular receptor for K channel openers, and they raise the possibility that mitoK is the site of action of cardioprotective KCOs. 2A preliminary report of these findings has been published in abstract form(32.Paucek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Sun X. Garlid K.D. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: A145Google Scholar). MitoK was purified and reconstituted into proteoliposomes exactly as described previously(8.Paucek P. Mironova G.

K flux was determined by linear regression of the initial changes in the K-dependent fluorescence of intraliposomal PBFI, which was calibrated for each preparation(8.Paucek P. Mironova G. Mahdi F.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 331-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Sarcolemmal vesicles were prepared from the left ventricular muscle of fresh beef heart according to a modification (10.Periyasamy S.M. Kakar S.S. Garlid K.D. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6035-6041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the method of Jones and Besch(11.Jones L.R. Besch Jr., H.R. Methods Pharmacol. 1984; 5: 1-12Google Scholar). The sarcolemmal K channel was solubilized, purified, and reconstituted into proteoliposomes exactly as described above for mitoK, except that cellK activity was found in the 100 mM KCl fraction(12.Paucek P. Garlid K.D. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: A311Google Scholar). Internal and external media were as described for mitoK, except that Na was substituted for TEA ion, because TEA inhibits K flux through cellK. Assays of cardiac cellK were carried out as described for mitoK. 6 μl of a stock mitochondrial suspension in 0.25 M sucrose (50 mg protein/ml) were added to 3 ml of “K medium” containing K salts of chloride (45 mM), acetate (25.4 mM), TES (5 mM), EGTA (0.1 mM), pH 7.4, plus MgCl (1 mM) and cytochrome c (10 μM). Substrates for respiration were either succinate (3 mM) and rotenone (2 μg/mg of protein) or ascorbate (2.5 mM) and TMPD (0.25 mM), as indicated in the figure legends. For assays in “TEA medium,” TEA was substituted for K. The assay cuvette was maintained at 25°C, and absorbance data at 520 nm were collected and stored digitally as described previously(13.Beavis A.D. Lu Y. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 997-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Beavis A.D. Brannan R.D. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13424-13433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Garlid K.D. Beavis A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13434-13441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Respiration-driven, electrophoretic uptake of K is accompanied by electroneutral uptake of acetate and osmotically obligated water. The light-scattering variable, β, is linearly dependent on matrix volume; hence, K influx (J) is proportional to dβ/dt. PBFI was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Two benzopyranyl derivatives, EMD57970 and EMD60480, were provided by E. Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). All other chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma. Fig. 1 contains dose-response curves for KCO stimulation of K flux in vesicles reconstituted with mitoK. Drug assays were carried out in medium containing 3 mM Mg and 0.5 mM ATP, which fully inhibits mitoK (K (ATP) ≈ 22 μM). The drugs tested were potent activators of K flux, restoring ATP-inhibited flux to, but not beyond, control rates measured in the absence of ATP. Observed K values (mean and S.D.) were 1.05 ± 0.06 μM for cromakalim (n = 5), 0.37 ± 0.03 μM for diazoxide (n = 4), 6.1 ± 1.3 nM for EMD60480 (n = 2), and 6.20 ± 0.02 nM for EMD57970 (n = 2). As shown in the inset to Fig. 1, cromakalim and diazoxide exhibited indistinguishable Hill slopes of 2.0 ± 0.5, and the benzopyranyl derivatives yielded Hill slopes of 3.5 ± 0.3. Hill slopes greater than 1.0 may reflect a tetrameric structure of the channel, as observed with other K channels(16.Guy H.R. Durell S.R. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1994; 49: 197-212PubMed Google Scholar), or the existence of multiple binding sites on a regulatory ATP binding cassette, as has been proposed for the sulfonylurea receptor of the pancreatic β cell (17.Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement IV, J.P. Boyd III, A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). We also measured KCO activation of K flux in proteoliposomes reconstituted with mitoK purified from beef heart mitochondria. Observed K values from two experiments were 1 μM for cromakalim and 0.4 μM for diazoxide. These results extend a previous observation that cardiac and hepatic mitoK behave very similarly. We stress that these drugs stimulated K flux only when K flux was inhibited by Mg and ATP. Control (uninhibited) K flux is observed in media containing Mg alone, ATP alone, and lacking both Mg and ATP(8.Paucek P. Mironova G. Mahdi F. Beavis A.D. Woldegiorgis G. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26062-26069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In each of these conditions, KCOs had no effect on control K flux at doses up to 30-fold higher than their respective K values. The high potency of diazoxide for cardiac mitoK was somewhat surprising and suggested a pharmacological distinction from cardiac cellK, which is relatively insensitive to diazoxide(18.Faivre J.F. Findlay I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 984: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we evaluated the effects of the same set of KCOs on cellK reconstituted from cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles(12.Paucek P. Garlid K.D. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: A311Google Scholar, 19.Paucek P. Schindler P.A. Yarov-Yarovoy Y. Garlid K.D. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: A1688Google Scholar). Fig. 2 contains dose-response curves for KCO stimulation of K flux in proteoliposomes reconstituted with cardiac cellK. These assays were carried out in media containing 2 mM ATP (K = 0.5 mM). Each of the drugs restored ATP-inhibited K flux to control rates measured in the absence of ATP. As was the case with mitoK, these KCOs had no effect on the control rate in the absence of ATP. Observed K values and Hill slopes (in parentheses) for opening the plasma membrane K channel were 3.7 nM (1.1) for EMD57970, 22 nM (1.2) for EMD60480, 17 μM (1.1) for cromakalim, and 855 μM (0.9) for diazoxide. Similar values were obtained in a separate preparation. The K values for the benzopyranyl derivatives are reasonably similar to those observed for mitoK; however, the K value for diazoxide is about 2000-fold higher. In contradistinction to the finding with mitoK, the Hill slopes for activation of cellK were indistinguishable from 1 for all of the KCOs tested. The preceding results appear to conflict with previous work (6.Belyaeva E.A. Szewczyk A. Mikolajek B. Nalecz M.J. Wojtczak L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 493-500PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Szewczyk A. Wojcik G. Nalecz M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) showing very low potencies for KCO activation of K flux in mitochondria. Accordingly, it was important to determine whether the high potencies observed in Fig. 1 are also observed in situ. Fig. 3 contains representative light-scattering traces from rat liver mitochondria respiring on ascorbate-TMPD. Swelling in K salts (trace a) was sharply inhibited by addition of 100 μM ATP (down arrow to trace b) to levels close to those observed in TEA salts (trace c). In agreement with previous results(10.Periyasamy S.M. Kakar S.S. Garlid K.D. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6035-6041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), higher [ATP] had no further effect in K medium, and ATP had no effect on TEA flux (not shown). When 20 μM cromakalim was included in the assay medium containing 100 μM ATP, ATP inhibition was prevented (up arrow to trace d, Fig. 3). In the absence of ATP, cromakalim had no effect on the control rate up to 100 μM, the highest dose tested. When cromakalim was added during the inhibited state, ATP inhibition was reversed (not shown). Fig. 4 contains dose-response curves for activation of K flux by diazoxide, cromakalim, and EMD60480 in mitochondria. Activation was measured relative to rates in the presence of 100 μM ATP and 1 mM Mg, conditions in which the K for ATP inhibition is 2-3 μM(13.Beavis A.D. Lu Y. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 997-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The estimated K values were 2.3 μM for diazoxide, 6.3 μM for cromakalim, and 5.4 nM for EMD60480. As in proteoliposomes, these drugs stimulated K flux only when K flux was inhibited by Mg and ATP. In doses 20-fold higher than their respective K values, these KCOs had no effect on flux through the uninhibited channel. This effect was verified in media containing Mg alone, ATP alone, and lacking both Mg and ATP. This is the first report showing that KCOs activate mitoK over the same dose range as they activate cellK. This finding was observed in mitochondria and in proteoliposomes reconstituted with mitoK and raises the possibility that mitoK may be activated by KCOs in vivo. Kinetic parameters differed between intact mitochondria and the reconstituted preparations. As previously reported (13.Beavis A.D. Lu Y. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 997-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the K for ATP inhibition is lower in mitochondria (2-3 μM) than in proteoliposomes (20-25 μM). We now show that the K values for diazoxide and cromakalim are about 6-fold higher in mitochondria than in liposomes. On the other hand, the K for EMD60480 is about the same in the two preparations. These differences may reflect regulatory complexity in intact mitochondria, which is lost upon extraction and reconstitution. In the dose ranges studied, KCOs had no effect on K flux when Mg and/or ATP were omitted from the assay medium. The lack of effect of KCOs on the open channel is also characteristic of cellK(20.Thuringer D. Escande D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 897-902PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that KCOs in low doses have no effect on the uninhibited channel is also consistent with the results of Belyaeva et al.(6.Belyaeva E.A. Szewczyk A. Mikolajek B. Nalecz M.J. Wojtczak L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 493-500PubMed Google Scholar) and Szewczyk et al.(7.Szewczyk A. Wojcik G. Nalecz M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), who did not include Mg and ATP in the assay medium used for their studies. Opening of mitoK will shift the balance between K uniport and K/H antiport, causing transient net K uptake and matrix swelling to a higher steady-state volume(21.Garlid K.D. Lemasters J.J. Hackenbrock C.R. Thurman R.G. Westerhoff H.V. Integration of Mitochondrial Function. Plenum Publishing, New York1988: 257-276Google Scholar). Halestrap (22.Halestrap A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 973: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) has established that increasing matrix volume over a fairly narrow range greatly activates electron transport at the point where electrons feed into ubiquinone, and he has suggested (23.Halestrap A.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) that this sequence may be triggered by opening of mitoK. Thus, opening of mitoK may be a necessary component of the cellular signals calling, for example, for higher ATP production to support increased work in heart or for faster β oxidation of fatty acids to support thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. Conversely, blocking mitoK may interfere with the cell's response to these signals. Recognition of mitoK as an intracellular receptor for KCOs adds a new dimension to the KCO pharmacology, which has heretofore focused exclusively on plasma membrane K channels. Pharmacological regulation of K channels has many important, tissue-dependent consequences(1.Cook N.S. Quast U. Cook N.S. Potassium Channels. Ellis Horwood Ltd., Chichester, UK1990: 181-231Google Scholar, 2.Escande D. Henry H. Eur. Heart J. 1993; 14: 2-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.McPherson G.A. Gen. Pharmacol. 1993; 24: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); however, the receptors for these effects have not yet been identified, and a mitochondrial contribution cannot be excluded. The role of K channels in pancreatic β cells is a case in point. Flatt et al.(24.Flatt P.R. Shibier O. Szecowka J. Berggren P.-O. Diabetes Metab. 1994; 20: 157-162Google Scholar) have recently shown that Ca-dependent insulin release from electopermeabilized β cells is stimulated by glyburide and inhibited by diazoxide. Because plasma membrane K channels are inoperative in the permeabilized cell, these effects point to an intracellular receptor for these agents(24.Flatt P.R. Shibier O. Szecowka J. Berggren P.-O. Diabetes Metab. 1994; 20: 157-162Google Scholar). A particularly exciting development in heart is the finding by Grover and colleagues (5.Grover G.J. McCullough J.R. Sleph P.G. Conder M.L. Henry D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 251: 98-104PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Grover G.J. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1994; 24: S18-S27Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and others (26.Cole W.C. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 1993; 1993: 527-537Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 27.Gross G.J. Auchampach J.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1992; 26: 1011-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) that KCOs are cardioprotective during experimental ischemia. KCO-treated hearts maintained higher ATP levels and exhibited reduced infarct size and enhanced post-ischemic recovery upon reperfusion. All of these effects were blocked by glyburide, which is contraindicated in patients susceptible to cardiac ischemia. Preconditioning, in which a period of brief ischemia reperfusion protects the heart against subsequent ischemic damage(28.Murry C.E. Jennings R.B. Reimer K.A. Circulation. 1986; 74: 1124-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (7062) Google Scholar), was also blocked by glyburide(29.Escande D. Thuringer D. Leguern S. Cavero I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These pharmacological effects point to a role of K channels in myocardial protection; but, again, the receptor for these effects has not been identified, and a mitochondrial site of action cannot be excluded(25.Grover G.J. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1994; 24: S18-S27Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Exploration of this possibility is aided by the existence of receptor subtypes among K channels(1.Cook N.S. Quast U. Cook N.S. Potassium Channels. Ellis Horwood Ltd., Chichester, UK1990: 181-231Google Scholar). For example, cromakalim is a potent activator of cellK from heart and vascular smooth muscle (29.Escande D. Thuringer D. Leguern S. Cavero I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) but has a minimal effect on insulin secretion(4.Quast U. Cook N.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 250: 261-270PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Lazdunski M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1994; 24: S1-S5Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Diazoxide is a potent vasodilator (4.Quast U. Cook N.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 250: 261-270PubMed Google Scholar) and also reduces insulin secretion (31.Trube G. Rorsman P. Ohno-Shosaku T. Pfluegers Arch. 1986; 407: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) but has little effect on cardiac cellK(18.Faivre J.F. Findlay I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 984: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This raises the question whether mitoK and cellK from the same cell differ pharmacologically. Accordingly, we have compared drug sensitivities of cardiac mitoK and cellK reconstituted from beef heart. These experiments yielded the following preliminary results: (i) mitoK from heart and liver do not differ significantly in their drug sensitivities (K values); (ii) cardiac mitoK and cardiac cellK exhibit similar sensitivities to benzopyran derivatives; however, (iii) cardiac mitoK is about 2000 times more sensitive to diazoxide than cardiac cellK. The low sensitivity of reconstituted cardiac cellK to diazoxide is entirely consistent with previous reports(18.Faivre J.F. Findlay I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 984: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The inferred existence of receptor subtypes within the cardiac myocyte may provide a means to determine the site of cardioprotective action of K channel openers. The authors thank Craig Semrad and Jarmila Pauckova for their excellent assistance and Dr. Norbert Beier of E. Merck, Darmstadt, who provided the benzopyranyl derivatives."

The general features of bundle formation are largely independent of the specific structure of the bundling agent used. A threshold concentration of polycation is required to form lateral aggregates of actin filaments. The threshold concentration varies strongly with the valence of the cation and increases with the ionic strength of the solution. Polyanions such as nucleoside phosphates or oligomers of acidic amino acids disaggregate actin bundles into single filaments. These features are similar to the phenomenon of DNA condensation and can be explained analogously by polyelectrolyte theories. Similar results were found when F-actin was bundled by the peptide corresponding to the actin binding site of myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate protein (MARCKS) or by smooth muscle calponin, suggesting that a broad class of actin bundling factors may function in a common manner. Physiologic concentrations of both small ions and large proteins can induce actin interfilament association independent of a requirement for specific binding sites.

Actin polymerizes to double stranded filamentous form (F-actin) in solutions of physiological ionic strength (2 mM MgCl and 100 mM KCl). At relatively high (>10 mM) concentrations of divalent cations such as Mg, F-actin forms aggregates of various forms, characterized as types I, II, and III paracrystals(1.Kawamura M. Maruyama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1970; 68: 885-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Stable Type III paracrystals appear as large and compact side-by-side aggregates, with additional morphological variations identified by analyzing electron micrographs (EM)(2.Clarke F.M. Morton D.J. Biochem. J. 1976; 159: 797-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 3.Fowler W.E. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 4.Grant N.J. Oriol-Audit C.

An EM specimen typically manifests several morphologies, for which no difference in experimental conditions can be assigned. The co-existence of these morphological states implies that the total free energies of the various bundle forms are similar, provided that an overall attractive interaction exists in order to bring the filaments together. Chemicals that cause F-actin to form paracrystalline bundles, such as divalent cations at high concentrations (order of 10 mM) (4.Grant N.J. Oriol-Audit C. Dickens M.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 30: 67-73PubMed Google Scholar), trivalent cations (mM range)(7.Curmi P.M.G. Barden J.A. Remedios C.G.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1984; 5: 423-430Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and polyamines (3.Fowler W.E. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 4.Grant N.J. Oriol-Audit C. Dickens M.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 30: 67-73PubMed Google Scholar) are similar to those which cause DNA condensation(8.Baeza I. Gariglio P. Rangel L.M. Chavez P. Cervantes L. Arguello C. Wong C. Montanez C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6387-6392Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 9.Ma C. Bloomfield V.A. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1678-1681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), except that the latter effect requires consistently higher concentrations of polycations. Both effects also occur at low pH (<5.5), and at high osmotic pressure (by addition of polyethylene glycol, for example) (10.Rau D.C. Lee B. Parsegian V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2621-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). It is the goal of this paper to demonstrate that the mechanism of F-actin bundle formation is analogous to that established for DNA condensation. The phenomenon of DNA condensation has been successfully treated by the theory of linear polyelectrolytes(11.Bloomfield V.A. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 1471-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 12.Manning G.S. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1978; II: 179-246Crossref Scopus (2633) Google Scholar, 13.Marquet R. Houssier C. J. Biomol. Struct. Dynam. 1991; 9: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14.Ray J. Manning G.S. Langmuir. 1994; 10: 2450-2461Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar). A double stranded DNA at neutral pH has a linear charge spacing b = 1.7 Å, much less than the Bjerrum length, the distance between elementary charges at which the electrostatic interaction energy equals the thermal energy kT, i.e. = e2/4 kT. In water, for example, the dielectric constant = 80 at 20°C and = 7.1 Å. According to the Manning counterion condensation theory(12.Manning G.S. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1978; II: 179-246Crossref Scopus (2633) Google Scholar), a consequence of DNA's high charge density is that a certain fraction of its charge is neutralized due to the territorial binding of counterions in the immediate environment (so-called condensed counterions which are free to diffuse along the polymer axis, but inhibited from diffusing away). The fraction of polyelectrolyte charge compensated by the condensed counterions is determined as the following equation,θ=(1-1Nζ)(Eq. 1) where N is the valence of the counterion and = /b = 4.2. In monovalent electrolytes, is calculated to be 76%. It may reach 88% in the presence of sufficient divalent cations. Hence the predicted delocalized binding is stronger for counterions of higher valence, in which case the charged polymer is neutralized to a higher degree. The residual electrostatic repulsion between polyelectrolytes of like charge tends to keep them apart. This repulsive force decreases with the presence of polyvalent counterions, due to the enhanced charge condensation. In addition to the weakened electrostatic repulsion between charged polymers due to counterions, an attractive interaction can also be induced by two polymers sharing counterions. The fluctuation (15.Oosawa F. Polyelectrolytes. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1971: 120-126Google Scholar) and lateral redistribution (14.Ray J. Manning G.S. Langmuir. 1994; 10: 2450-2461Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar) of counterions have each been shown theoretically to cause an attractive interaction between polyelectrolytes. At appropriate ionic conditions, a balance between attractive and repulsive forces occurs so that the filaments in suspension form aggregates. This aggregation may also involve other interactions such as hydration and van der Waals forces(11.Bloomfield V.A. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 1471-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 13.Marquet R. Houssier C. J. Biomol. Struct. Dynam. 1991; 9: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It has been estimated that DNA condensation occurs as reaches 90%, which requires a valence of 3 or higher. Counterion condensation theory has been applied to other polyelectrolytes such as polystyrene sulfonate and heparinate(16.Delville A. Galboa H. Laszlo P. J. Chem. Phys. 1982; 77: 2045Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17.Delville A. Laszlo P. Biophys. Chem. 1983; 17: 119Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Justification for applying this theory has come from several different treatments. For example, analytical solutions to the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation for a cylindrical polyelectrolyte(18.Le Bret M. Zimm B.H. Biopolymers. 1984; 23: 287-312Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 19.Schmitz K.S. Macroions in Solution and Colloidal Suspension. VCH, New York1993: 213-268Google Scholar) provide a model generally consistent with that of the earlier counterion condensation theory. Similar predictions were also obtained by Monte Carlo simulations(20.Sanchez-Sanchez J.E. Lozada-Cassou M. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1992; 190: 202-208Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 21.Le Bret M. Zimm B.H. Biopolymers. 1984; 23: 271-285Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Alternatively, an interesting ligand binding model of counterion condensation was proposed(22.Dewey T.G. Biopolymers. 1990; 29: 1793-1799Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), with an assumption analogous to the territorial binding in the Manning theory. In this paper, the simplified predictions from the original Manning theory are used to explain the phenomenon of bundle formation by F-actin. Different results and interpretations from alternative approaches have been discussed more recently (19, 23). An actin filament has a lower linear charge density than DNA. Using the amino acid sequence of α-skeletal muscle actin, one residue of 3-methylhistidine, an acetylated N terminus and one molecule each of tightly bound divalent cation and ATP(24.Sheterline P. Sparrow J. Protein Profile. 1994; 1: 1-121PubMed Google Scholar), each subunit of an actin filament bears 14 excess negative charges. In addition, roughly three histidines per monomer are likely to be protonated at pH 7.2. Based on 370 monomers per micron contour length, the linear charge density is approximately 4 e/nm. This value has two implications: the average charge spacing along the filament axis is sufficiently small compared to the Bjerrum length to make the counterion condensation theory relevant ( = /b > 1); but is less than that of DNA, suggesting that a smaller percentage of charge needs to be neutralized for condensation to occur (). Therefore, one expects actin bundles to form at similar, but consistently lower, concentrations of cations compared to DNA. This prediction is tested by analysis of the effects of a variety of inorganic and organic cations, including the actin binding domain of MARCKS 1The abbreviation used is: MARCKSmyristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate.protein and the smooth muscle actin binding protein calponin. myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate. Monomeric (G-)actin was prepared from an acetone powder of rabbit skeletal muscle according to Spudich and Watt(25.Spudich J. Watt S. J. Biol.

The buffer concentration was sufficient to ensure the stability of pH, since concentrated reagents were frequently added to actin samples. Actin was polymerized by 150 mM KCl, unless mentioned otherwise. Human plasma gelsolin was purified by elution from DE52 ion exchange matrix in 30 mM NaCl, 3 mM CaCl, 25 mM Tris, pH 7.4, as described by Kurokawa et al.(26.Kurokawa H. Fujii W. Ohmi K. Sakurai T.

The lyophilized power was dissolved in 3 M KCl and dialyzed against 50 mM Hepes, 5 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1 M KCl at pH 7.5. A concentrated stock solution of up to 100 μM was prepared, and the protein concentration was determined by spectrophotometry, assuming a specific absorbance of 0.74 (mg/ml) cm at 280 nm. MARCKS peptide was purchased from Biomol, supplied as trifluoroacetate salt. A stock solution of 200 μM peptide was prepared in 50 mM Hepes at pH 7.5. Oligomers of arginine, lysine, histidine, and aspartic acid were synthesized and purified by Daina Biseniece, Ieva Liepkaula, and Ivars Lipsbergs at the Latvian Organic Synthesis Institute and were conveyed to us by Rolands Vegners. Polylysines of degree of polymerization larger than 10 were purchased from Sigma. All the other common chemicals are of research or analytical grade. 90 degree light scattering measurements were performed using a Perkin-Elmer LS-5B luminescence spectrometer. Different settings of wavelength, slit combination, and sample cuvettes of several dimensions and geometries were explored to find experimental conditions with sufficient signal and minimal multiple scattering. The instrumental settings altered the magnitude of the signals but not the concentrations of cations at which scattering changes were evident. We initially chose 365 nm excitation and 375 nm emission to avoid reflective signals, and slit widths of either 3 nm (Fig. 1, Fig. 3, and Fig. 6) or 5 nm (Fig. 2, Fig. 7, and Fig. 8) for both beams. Another frequently used setting was 365 nm/370 nm wavelength and 3 nm/3 nm slit width (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). High-UV transparent plastic cuvettes of 10 × 5-mm inside dimensions were used for 600-μl samples of low actin concentrations (0.1-1.0 mg/ml). Smaller glass tubes of 6 mm diameter were used for more concentrated samples in order to avoid the saturation of light scattering signals (Fig. 3). Square cuvettes (10 × 10 mm) and a 1200-μl sample volume were used to generate the data of Fig. 6b. Polycations and nucleoside phosphates were prepared as stock solutions at neutral pH at least 20 times more concentrated than required in the final mixtures. Dilution effects which amounted to less than 5% were ignored.Figure 3Effects of F-actin concentration on the bundle formation induced by Lys. a, bundle formation by Lys of F-actin in 150 mM KCl at 3 representative concentrations: 0.1, 2.0, and 6.0 mg/ml.

Fig. 1 shows the bundle formation of 0.5 mg/ml F-actin induced by a number of polycations. All the polyvalent cations were added in the form of concentrated chloride salts to ensure that the variation among these data was not attributable to anion species. The concentration of cations needed for the onset of bundling increases with decreased valence, indicating weakening ability to bundle. Hexamers of arginine bundle more efficiently than those of histidine, apparently because they carry a higher amount of net positive charges. D- and L-lysine isomers had identical effects (data not shown). The minimal bundling concentration of lysine hexamers (not shown) is almost the same as that of the arginine, indicating equally complete titration of one amine per side chain at pH 7.2. An intriguing result is that oligohistidines are fairly efficient actin bundlers at neutral pH, although the pK value for its side chain amine is as low as 6.5 and hence most of the side chains should be neutral. These oligomers of histidine either have more specific binding to F-actin or else they form small aggregates capable of bundling actin. In order to confirm that an increase in light scattering corresponds to bundling, F-actin samples at different light scattering levels due to additions of polycations were examined by electron microscopy (EM), using the negative staining technique. When light scattering signals remained at low levels, actin filaments appeared disperse or intertwined in loose isotropic networks. In contrast, large lateral aggregates were always seen by EM at high light scattering levels. The bundling efficiency of different divalent metal ions increases with their atomic number. Co bundles F-actin at 5.5 mM, Mn at 7 mM, in comparison with Ca at 20 mM and Mg at 27 mM. This variation from 5.5 to 27 mM may correlate with ionic radius and extent of hydration. Such cation-specific effects cannot be explained by the Manning theory. The general behavior shown in Fig. 1 can be qualitatively explained by the predictions of the polyelectrolyte theory. Assuming an average linear charge density of 4 e/nm and applying the counterion condensation theory of Manning, a layer of condensed counterions is predicted near the F-actin surface. With 150 mM KCl and no polyvalent cations, the most simplified Manning model estimates K in this layer to be about 60% () of the total net surface charge of F-actin. If divalent cations are abundant in solution, the percentage is estimated to be 82% (). F-actin forms stable bundles at 150 mM KCl with order of 10 mM divalent cations, suggesting that approximately 80% neutralization of the surface charge is required for bundle formation. This is a less stringent condition than that for DNA, in which case 90% of the charge needs to be neutralized for the transition to occur. The increased bundle formation by Co(NH) and polyamines compared with divalent cations is due to the higher apparent binding constants at higher valence, as predicted in the Manning theory(12.Manning G.S. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1978; II: 179-246Crossref Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). Deviations from the predictions of counterion condensation reveal specific binding of cationic ligands. Bundling of F-actin by Cu is not consistent with purely electrostatic binding. Fig. 2a shows the light scattering measurements after sequential additions of Cu to 0.2 mg/ml F-actin in 150 mM KCl, without and with 20 mM MgCl. For this set of experiments, we used a modified actin buffer containing 2 mM Tris at pH 7.5, 0.5 mM ATP, and 0.2 mM CaCl. This change was necessary since Cu forms insoluble precipitates with Hepes. It may also interact with dithiothreitol and NaN. In the absence of MgCl, large F-actin bundles start forming at 0.4 mM Cu, a much lower value than required for other divalent cations shown in Fig. 1. This observation may be explained by specific binding of Cu to the C terminus of actin with high affinity(28.Lehrer S.S. Nagy B. Gergely J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 150: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 29.Drabikowski W. Lehrer S. Nagy B. Gergely J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 181: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), causing a reduction in the surface charge of F-actin. Although binding between Cu and the actin C terminus is of micromolar affinity, 0.4 mM Cu is required to form actin bundles because an additional fraction of the charge must be neutralized by lower affinity interactions. In an attempt to distinguish these two components, MgCl was first added to the F-actin solution to 20 mM, in which condition the surface charge of F-actin should be neutralized to a large extent, but not enough to form bundles. A slight, yet reproducible increase in the light scattering signal was measured following addition of MgCl to 20 mM, which may correspond to some other forms of aggregation, such as the fishnet-like paracrystalline structures (types I and II) characterized by a previous EM study(1.Kawamura M. Maruyama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1970; 68: 885-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Addition of as little as 25 μM Cu causes a significant increase in light scattering, and the high level scattering at 50 μM Cu indicates extensive bundle formation. A complementary set of measurements is shown in Fig. 2b, in which 0.2 mg/ml F-actin was first treated with various amounts of Cu and its effect on bundling was compared with sequential addition of MgCl. While 10 μM Cu does not affect the onset of bundling by MgCl, 50 μM Cu facilitates bundle formation with only 15 mM MgCl as opposed to about 30 mM required without Cu. The decreased amount of Mg required for bundling is due to the reduction of surface charge on F-actin caused by the tight specific binding of Cu. The amount of polycation required to bundle different concentrations of polyelectrolyte provides information about the affinity of the interaction and the degree of binding required for the bundling transition. Fig. 3a shows the increase of light scattering when actin bundling occurs with sequential addition of 18-mers of lysine Lys to various concentrations of F-actin. The dotted lines indicate where the scattering signals increase steeply at low concentrations, or roughly double at high actin concentrations. This point is selected as the concentration of Lys required for paracrystal formation. At high actin concentrations, the scattering intensity is relatively high prior to any bundling activity, and the increase in scattering at the onset of bundle formation is blunted by multiple scattering. Fig. 3b shows that the amount of Lys required to bundle actin increases approximately linearly with the actin concentration. The intercept of the vertical axis from a linear fit, c = 19.4 μM, is the concentration of free Lys necessary to induce bundling. The slope of 0.26 Lys per actin monomer determines the molar ratio of Lys to actin in the bundled state. Assuming that each actin monomer carries 11 e of negative charge in the polymerized form, the number of bound polylysine per charge on the actin filament is = 0.26/11 = 0.024. This number implies that about 40% (× 18) of the actin surface charge is neutralized by the lysine residues at the onset of bundling. Consistent with the Manning theory, an additional 40% or so is neutralized by the excess K to make up to 80% as the criterion for bundling to occur. In order to explain the linear relationship measured in Fig. 3, it is helpful to first elucidate the concept of condensation zone, and how its volume is related to the molar concentration of actin. Manning introduced V as the volume of condensation per molar charge of the polyelectrolyte, within which counterions are bound (12.Manning G.S. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1978; II: 179-246Crossref Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). At excess univalent electrolyte, V can be calculated as the following,VP=41.1 (ζ-1)b3(Eq. 2) where V has the units of cm3/mol if b is expressed in Å. For F-actin, since b = 2.5 Å and = 7.1/b = 2.8, we estimate V to be 1.2 × 103 cm3/mol, or equivalently 1.2 M. The constant value for V implies that the total volume of condensation zone is directly proportional to the molar concentration of actin. Based on this property, a brief derivation in the appendix predicts a behavior which is consistent with Fig. 3b. This simple exercise with the Manning theory further predicts the local ion concentration of Lys as c = /V = 0.02 M. The association constant, defined as the ratio of concentrations of localized to free counterions, K = c/c, is therefore on the order of 20 mM/20 μM = 103 for the case of Lys with 150 mM KCl in solution. In Fig. 3b the minimal bundling concentration of Lys is in the micromolar range, comparable to the range of F-actin concentration. In the case of divalent and trivalent cations, millimolar concentrations of free cations are required for bundle formation, and the amount sequestered by actin filaments is negligible. Measurements similar to those of Fig. 3 using Co(NH) showed no apparent dependence of the minimal bundling concentration on actin concentration from 0.1 to 5.0 mg/ml within our experimental error of approximately 10%. Although the original counterion condensation theory assumes filaments to be infinitely long, we have made no attempt to conduct our measurements with extremely long actin filament. On the contrary, small quantities (1:500 molar ratio) of gelsolin, an actin severing protein were generally added to F-actin in order to reduce the filament length to an average of 1.6 micron and thereby reduce solution viscosity(30.Janmey P.A. K ä s J. Saasen A. Annual Transactions of the Nordic Rheology Society. HCO Tryk, Copenhagen1994: 8-11Google Scholar). A systematic test of a possible length dependence for bundling of actin by polycations was made by varying the gelsolin:actin ratio. Fig. 4 shows the light scattering increases caused by adding Lys to 0.2 mg/ml F-actin solution containing various amounts of gelsolin. The onset bundling profile varies very little until the filaments contain 50 monomers (140 nm) on average. This result implies that the basic prediction of charge condensation is applicable to cylindrical filaments of sufficiently large aspect ratios (>20:1). A direct consequence of the Manning theory is that the association constant, K, is a function of the solution ionic strength, c, as shown below,log k = constant - N log c(Eq. 3) where N is the valence of the small cation. This dependence is only correct for a trace amount of polyvalent counterions in the presence of excess monovalent counterions. Otherwise, the Manning one variable approach predicts a similar power law dependence with a slope varying between 1 and N in the log-log plot, which approaches 1 with increased concentration of the polyvalent counterion. In addition, such dependence is expected to hold only at c < 0.1 M. In practice, testing the ionic strength dependence for F-actin bundles is limited to high ionic strength (order of 100 mM KCl), or with 2 mM MgCl in so"

We compared THP-1 macrophages incubated with or without acetylated LDL (acLDL) ± acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitor (compound 58035) for 20 h and assessed changes in mRNA of chemokines, growth factors, interleukins, and adhesion molecules. Among 49 genes examined, an increase in mRNA was observed only for interleukin 8 (IL-8) in THP-1 macrophages. Northern analysis confirmed a 3- to 4-fold increase of IL-8 mRNA and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed a corresponding increase in IL-8 in conditioned medium. Oxidized LDL (oxLDL) also induced IL-8 mRNA, but native LDL had no effect. 58035 had a moderate effect on IL-8 induction by acLDL. AcLDL-induced IL-8 expression was concentration- and time-dependent. The time course of IL-8 induction paralleled that of cholesterol loading. MCP-1, a chemokine implicated in recruiting monocytes in atherogenesis, was also induced by acLDL. The induction of MCP-1, however, peaked at 1 h after addition of acLDL and returned to basal level by 20 h while IL-8 induction peaked at 8 h and was still 2-fold higher than basal level at 20 h. IL-8 induction was also observed in fresh human monocyte-derived macrophage cells treated with acLDL. Finally, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization studies using specimens of human coronary atheromas showed expression of IL-8 mRNA in a macrophage-rich area. We conclude that IL-8 is induced in macrophage foam cells as a response to cholesterol loading.

Cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and communications involving macrophages, vascular smooth muscle cells, vascular endothelial cells, and lymphocytes are likely to be involved. The identification and characterization of novel genes involved in this cross-talk could be crucial to deciphering the mechanisms of atherogenesis. As an approach to identifying new genes involved in atherogenesis, we have assayed multiple genes for altered levels of their mRNAs in responses to cholesterol loading of foam cells. We have identified human IL-8 as an inducible factor produced by cholesterol-loaded macrophages and have found that the regulation of its production is correlated with cholesterol loading. IL-8 is a potent chemokine, but has received little attention as a potential contributor to atherogenesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsTissue culture media and reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.

Eder H. Bragdon J. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6460) Google Scholar). AcLDL was prepared by reaction with acetic anhydride as described by Goldstein and coworkers (21.Brown M.S. Basu S.K. Falck J.R. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Supramol. Struct. 1980; 13: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and butylated hydroxytoluene was used in preparation to minimize any oxidation of acLDL. OxLDL was prepared by exposing LDL to 10 μmol/liter cupric sulfate in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 h. The oxidation was terminated by addition of butylated hydroxytoluene to a final concentration of 40 μmol/liter. Dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline with several changes was used to remove dialyzable factors.Northern Blot Analysis and Multigene AssayTotal cellular RNA was isolated from the macrophages using the guanidine thiocyanate lysis method with RNazol (Tel-Test, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Blotting and hybridization were performed as described previously(22.Wang N. Gottesman S. Willingham M.C. Gottesman M.M. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11247-11251Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The human IL-8 cDNA probe, from a 1.2-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment of human IL-8 cDNA, and the human MCP-1 probe, from a 0.7-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment of human MCP-1 cDNA, were radiolabeled with [α-P]dCTP using a random priming method(23.Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5171) Google Scholar).The initial multigene assay was performed as described previously(24.Winchester R. Su F. Ritchlin C. Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 1993; 11: S87-S90PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the total RNA isolated from the cultured cells was reverse-transcribed to generate first strand cDNA. The second strand of cDNA was synthesized in the presence of [α-P]dCTP. This pool of labeled cDNA fragments was hybridized to a nylon sheet on which a known amount of plasmid DNA from genes of interest had been individually dotted. The relative mRNA level of each gene was normalized against the signal of β-actin.Immunohistochemistry and in Situ HybridizationThe cRNA probes were produced from a 270-base pair human IL-8 cDNA subcloned into pBluescript. T7 and T3 promoters flanking the cDNA fragment were used to make the sense and antisense cRNA probe by in vitro transcription. Riboprobes were labeled with digoxigenin 11-UTP according to the protocol of Boehringer Mannheim. Nonisotopic in situ hybridization was performed using a modification of the manufacturer's protocol. Paraffin-embedded sections were incubated in xylene for 10 min to remove paraffin, and then the sections were subjected to dehydration/rehydration cycles in solutions of various ethanol concentrations. The sections were digested with 10 μg/ml proteinase K at 37°C for 30 min. After postfixing, prehybridization was for 3 h at 50°C in buffer containing 50% formamide, 250 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 1.5 M NaCl, 0.1% Ficoll, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 4 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5. For hybridization, dextran sulfate was added to prehybridization buffer to a final concentration of 20%. Sense or antisense riboprobe was added at 10 ng/μl. Sections were incubated overnight at 50°C in humidified condition. The sections were washed at room temperature in excess 2 × SSC for 5 min, and then digested with 50 μg/ml RNase A in 2 × SSC at 37°C for 30 min. After washing, the sections were blocked by incubation in blocking buffer consisting 5% normal horse serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl. The sections were then sequentially incubated and washed with sheep anti-digoxigenin antiserum (Boehringer Mannheim), alkaline phosphatase-coupled donkey anti-sheep antibody, and the Tris/NaCl buffer. Alkaline phosphatase binding was detected using the substrates nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies against MAC-1 and mouse serum albumin was performed as described(25.Ravalli S. Marboe C.C. D'Agati V.D. Michler R.E. Sigal E. Cannon P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Biol. 1995; 15: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).Other AssaysIL-8 was quantified by commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, R & D Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Endotoxin contamination of lipoprotein preparations was monitored with the Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay using the E-Toxate Kit from Sigma. The cellular content of free cholesterol and cholesterol ester was determined with an enzymatic chromagenic assay using free cholesterol and cholesterol II kit from Wako (Osaka, Japan).RESULTSInduction of IL-8 mRNA in Macrophages by AcLDLIn order to identify novel genes expressed in cholesterol-loaded macrophages, a multigene assay was used. This assay can be used to survey the cellular mRNA level of several dozen genes of interest in a single experiment. The human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, was chosen because this cell line is highly differentiated and, when stimulated with phorbol ester, demonstrates macrophage-like characteristics including expression of scavenger receptors(26.Tsuchiya S. Kobayashi Y. Goto Y. Okumura H. Nakae S. Konno T. Tada K. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1530-1536PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Via D.P. Pons L. Dennison D.K. Fanslow A.E. Bernini F. J.

Commun. 1987; 146: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Further, incubation of phorbol ester-stimulated THP-1 cells with acLDL results in cholesterol loading(29.Banka C.L. Black A.S. Dyer C.A. Curtiss L.K. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 35-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), implying that the cell line is useful as a model for studying foam cell formation in vitro. The genes selected for the assay included a variety of chemokines, growth factors, interleukins, adhesion molecules, and proteases (see legend to Fig. 1), all of which are known to be expressed in macrophages in various conditions(24.Winchester R. Su F. Ritchlin C. Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 1993; 11: S87-S90PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of these genes is important for regulation of the functions of macrophages. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1, PMA-pretreated THP-1 cells were cultured for 20 h in RPMI medium (control, panel A), with added LDL (panel B) or acLDL (panel C) or acLDL plus the ACAT inhibitor 58035 (panel D). Total RNA was isolated from the cells, reverse-transcribed and radiolabeled, and hybridized to filters containing arrays of cDNAs of the genes of interest.Among 49 genes examined, an increase in mRNA was observed only for IL-8 in acLDL-treated THP-1 cells (Fig. 1). Scanning the filter revealed no significant alteration in mRNA levels of any other genes tested. After normalization to β-actin, the increase in IL-8 mRNA was estimated to be 2.1-fold for acLDL-treated cells versus control macrophages. 58035 alone had no effect (data not shown) but increased IL-8 mRNA by 5-fold when used with acLDL. Native LDL had a marginal effect on IL-8 mRNA levels, causing increases of 1.2- or 1.4-fold, with or without 58035, respectively. Since phorbol esters up-regulate scavenger receptors while down-regulating LDL receptors(27.Via D.P. Pons L. Dennison D.K. Fanslow A.E. Bernini F. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1515-1524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Hara H. Tanishita H. Yokoyama S. Tajima S. Yamamoto A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), these results suggest that IL-8 mRNA is induced as a result of uptake of acLDL by the scavenger receptors. The synergism between ACAT inhibitor and acLDL could indicate that accumulation of unesterified cholesterol provides the signal leading to IL-8 induction.To confirm these initial results, Northern blot analysis was performed. Since oxLDL has been shown to stimulate the production of IL-8 by THP-1 cells without PMA treatment(30.Terkeltaub R. Banka C.L. Solan J. Santora D. Brand K. Curtiss L.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 47-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we also used oxLDL in the experiment. Consistent with the results of the multigene assay, the mRNA level of IL-8 increased 2.5-fold in cells incubated with acLDL alone and 3.5-fold in cells incubated with acLDL plus 58035 compared with the control cells, as determined by β particle scanning of the Northern blot shown in Fig. 2. OxLDL also increased IL-8 mRNA content to a level similar to that of acLDL (Fig. 2). An ELISA assay was used to determine IL-8 protein levels in cell culture media collected after lipoprotein treatment (Fig. 3). The accumulation of IL-8 in medium generally paralleled the changes in mRNA (Fig. 2). In cells incubated with acLDL plus 58035, the medium IL-8 concentration was 2.4-fold higher than controls.Figure 2IL-8 mRNA levels in control and cholesterol-loaded THP-1 macrophages. PMA-pretreated THP-1 cells were incubated for 20 h in medium alone (lane 1) or medium containing 5 μg/ml 58035 (lane 2), 70 μg/ml LDL (lane 3), 70 μg/ml LDL plus 58035 (lane 4), 70 μg/ml acLDL (lane 5), 70 μg/ml acLDL plus 58035 (lane 6), 70 μg/ml oxLDL (lane 7), or 70 μg/ml oxLDL plus 58035 (lane 8). Total RNA from these cells was extracted, and Northern blot analysis was performed using cDNA probes to IL-8 and β-actin. The band hybridizing with the IL-8 probe was 1.8 kilobases based upon relative migration compared with nucleic acid standards.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3IL-8 protein levels in control and cholesterol-loaded THP-1 macrophages.

Butcher C.J. Kellie S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 32.Schmidt J. Fleissner S. Heimann-Weitschat I. Lindstaedt R. Pomberg B. Werner U. Szelenyi I. Immunopharmacology. 1994; 27: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, the possibility that these results reflected bacterial endotoxin contamination of the lipoprotein preparations needed to be addressed. Several approaches were used to exclude this possibility. First, the bacterial endotoxin content of the lipoprotein preparation was determined using the Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay. The endotoxin content was estimated to be 0.3 pg/μg acLDL protein. No detectable IL-8 mRNA induction was observed by Northern blot analysis when THP-1 cells were treated with up to 100 pg/ml LPS alone (data not shown). Second, polymyxin B, an inhibitor of LPS action on many types of cells, blocked the effect of LPS (10 μg/ml) on IL-8 induction in THP-1 cells, but had no effect on IL-8 induction by acLDL (data not shown). Finally, as shown above, native LDL had no effect on IL-8 mRNA levels, even though the same batch of LDL was used to prepare the acLDL which did induce the response.Dose-Response and Time Course of IL-8 mRNA Induction by AcLDLTo explore further the relationship between acLDL treatment and IL-8 induction, dose-response and time course experiments were performed. IL-8 protein in medium increased with increasing acLDL concentration to a level three times control at 150 μg/ml acLDL (Fig. 4). Although 58035 did not produce a significant augmentation of the IL-8 response at high concentrations of acLDL, at lower concentrations of acLDL (≤100 μg/ml), 58035 and acLDL had synergistic effects on IL-8 accumulation. A dose-response experiment carried out with oxLDL showed an effect similar to acLDL (data not shown).Figure 4IL-8 production by macrophages as a function of acLDL concentration. A procedure similar to that in Fig. 2 was used. Triple determinations were performed.

MCP-1, a member of β chemokine, has been demonstrated to be an inducible gene in vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and monocytes upon various stimuli (33.Cushing S.D. Berliner J.A.

Northern blot analysis was used to follow the alteration of IL-8 and MCP-1 mRNA content of the cells. The results are shown in Fig. 5A, and the mRNA content of IL-8 and MCP-1 (normalized against β-actin mRNA) is quantitated in Fig. 5B. There were marked differences in the kinetics of the response of IL-8 and MCP-1 mRNA to cholesterol loading. IL-8 mRNA increased gradually and peaked after 8 h of incubation at 6-fold basal level. Then the IL-8 mRNA decreased and at 20 h of incubation the level was 2.5-fold higher than the basal level. In contrast, the increase in MCP-1 mRNA could be observed as early as 10 min after incubation, and the peak effect occurred after a 1-h incubation at 3.5-fold basal level. Subsequently, MCP-1 mRNA content gradually decreased and returned to basal level 20 h after incubation. The time course for MCP-1 mRNA explains why the increase of MCP-1 mRNA was not observed in the multigene assay, since the RNA samples used in that assay were collected from cells after 20 h of incubation.Figure 5Time course of IL-8 and MCP-1 mRNA induction and cholesterol loading of macrophages. A, THP-1 cells were incubated with 70 μg/ml acLDL plus 5 μg/ml 58035. At each time point indicated, total RNA was isolated and Northern blot analysis was performed using cDNA probes to IL-8, MCP-1, and β-actin. The band hybridizing with the MCP-1 probe was 0.7 kilobase based upon relative migration compared with nucleic acid standards. B, quantitation of each band of the hybridization filter as shown in A was performed using a β particle scanner. IL-8 and MCP-1 signals normalized against that of β-actin were plotted as a function of the incubation time. C, THP-1 cells were incubated with 70 μg/ml acLDL plus 5 μg/ml 58035. At each time point indicated, cells were harvested, and cellular free cholesterol (FC) and cholesteryl ester (CE) were determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine the relationship between altered IL-8 mRNA content and accumulation of cellular cholesterol, cellular free cholesterol and cholesteryl ester were determined. As shown in Fig. 5C, the cellular free cholesterol content increased rapidly during the first 8 h of incubation, paralleling the induction of IL-8 mRNA (Fig. 5B). Subsequently, cellular cholesterol content changed little and IL-8 mRNA decreased. In the presence of 58035, the cellular content of cholesteryl ester did not change, reflecting inhibition of ACAT (Fig. 5C).The time course data suggested that the free cholesterol content of the cell may be related directly to IL-8 mRNA induction in acLDL-treated cells. To further test this hypothesis, THP-1 cells were treated either with free cholesterol or cholesterol incorporated into liposomes in the presence or absence of 58035 in a manner which has been shown to increase the free cholesterol content of macrophages (36.McCloskey H.M. Rothblat G.H. Glick J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 320-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The IL-8 mRNA level, however, did not show any significant alteration even though THP-1 cellular free cholesterol content was increased up to 3.1-fold over control levels. A possible explanation is that acLDL- and liposome-mediated cholesterol loading of macrophages may result in accumulation of free cholesterol in different cellular compartments and induce different cellular responses. Mechanisms governing cellular cholesterol levels and compartmentation, however, are still largely unknown (see (37.Liscum L. Faust J.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 157-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) for review).Next, the effects of a known competitor of scavenger receptor-mediated acLDL binding were assessed. As shown in Fig. 6, IL-8 mRNA induction by acLDL (lane 3) was blocked completely by polyinosinic acid (lane 4), while the competitor alone (lane 2) had no effect, indicating that IL-8 mRNA induction requires scavenger receptor-mediated uptake of acLDL.Figure 6Effect of polyinosinic acid on IL-8 induction by acLDL. THP-1 cells were incubated for 20 h with 5 μg/ml 58035 (lane 1), 1 mg/ml polyinosinic acid (lane 2), 70 μg/ml acLDL plus 58035 (lane 3), or 70 μg/ml acLDL plus 58035 and polyinosinic acid (lane 4).

The gene has three sites of transcriptional initiation and produces mRNA transcripts containing 5′-untranslated regions of more than 350 nucleotides. The mRNA, through two alternative splicing events, is predicted to direct the synthesis of four protein isoforms with molecular masses of 47-49 kDa. In this report, we identify and characterize novel WT1 protein isoforms having predicted molecular masses of 54-56 kDa. Mutational analysis of the murine wt1 mRNA demonstrates that the novel isoforms are the result of translation initiation at a CUG codon 204 bases upstream of and in frame with the initiator AUG. We show that these isoforms are present in both normal murine tissue and in WTs. Like WT1, the larger isoforms localize to the cell nucleus and are capable of mediating transcriptional repression. Our results indicate that regulation of WT1 gene expression is more complex than previously suspected and have important implications for normal and abnormal urogenital system development.

Approximately 7-15% of sporadic WTs contain detectable mutations in the tumor suppressor gene WT1 (Coppes et al., 1993; Little et al., 1992; Varanasi et al., 1994). The WT1 gene encodes a transcription factor belonging to the early growth response family of Cys-His zinc finger proteins. The pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced at two exons to produce four WT1 isoforms (Haber et al., 1991). The first alternatively spliced exon inserts or removes 17 residues upstream of the four zinc fingers and is capable of mediating transcriptional repression when fused to a DNA binding domain (Wang et al., 1993a). The second alternatively spliced exon inserts or removes 3 amino acids, KTS, between zinc fingers III and IV and alters the DNA binding specificity of the protein, as well as its subnuclear localization (Drummond et al., 1994; Larrson et al., 1995; Rauscher et al., 1990). The -KTS WT1 isoforms recognize a GC-rich motif (5′-GCGGGGGCG-3′), as well as a (TCC) repeat (Rauscher et al., 1990; Wang et al., 1993b), and can affect expression of a number of genes harboring these motifs in their regulatory regions (for a review see Rauscher(1994)). These genes include insulin-like growth factor II (Drummond et al., 1992), insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (Werner et al., 1993), platelet-derived growth factor A-chain (Gashler et al., 1992; Wang et al., 1992), colony-stimulating factor-1 gene (Harrington et al., 1993), transforming growth factor-β1 (Dey et al., 1994), the retinoic acid receptor-α (Goodyer et al., 1995), and the wt1 gene itself (Rupprecht et al., 1994). WT1 can mediate both transcriptional repression and activation, depending on the architecture of the promoter under study (Madden et al., 1991; Drummond et al., 1992, 1994; Wang et al., 1992). Activation and repression are mediated by distinct domains within the WT1 protein (Wang et al., 1993a). Wilms' tumor open reading frame untranslated region polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline. In addition to its role as a tumor suppressor gene, WT1 plays an essential role in the normal development of the urogenital system. The expression pattern of WT1 is not ubiquitous, being mainly restricted to components of the urogenital system: the gonads, developing glomeruli, and the uterus (Pelletier et al., 1991a). Many children with germline WT1 mutations suffer from malformations of the urogenital system, ranging in severity from minor genital anomalies to streak gonads and renal nephropathy (for a review see Bruening and Pelletier(1994)). Consistent with a role for WT1 in the development of the urogenital system is the observation that this system fails to differentiate in wt1-null mice (Kreidberg et al., 1993). Similar to many other genes involved in growth regulation, the wt1 mRNA transcript contains an AUG-initiated open reading frame (ORF) preceded by a long, GC-rich, 5′-untranslated region (UTR) (Nagpal et al., 1992). There are three sites of transcription initiation within the murine wt1 promoter, producing mRNA species with 5′-UTRs of 375, 700, or 720 nucleotides. In the course of characterizing the protein isoforms produced from these transcripts, we noted the presence of isoforms having molecular masses greater than expected. In this report, we demonstrate that these isoforms arise from translation initiation at a CUG codon upstream of and in frame with the wt1 initiator AUG. These novel isoforms are present in normal and malignant tissue and are capable of repressing transcription. Although AUG codons are essentially exclusively used as initiation codons for eukaryotic mRNAs, there are rare examples of cellular mRNAs where other codons (GUG, ACG, and CUG) are also used for this purpose. These include proto-oncogenes (MYC, INT-2, PIM-1, and LYL-1) (Acland et al., 1990; Hann et al., 1988; Saris et al., 1991; Mellentin et al., 1989), as well as the basic fibroblast growth factor gene (Prats et al., 1989), retinoic acid receptor β4 (Nagpal et al., 1992), krox-24 (also a member of the early growth response family) (Lemaire et al., 1990), and the ltk receptor (Bernards and de la Monte, 1990). The nature of the signals that dictate the use of a CUG codon as an initiation codon within the 5′-UTR are not well understood, but immediate downstream sequences can influence the efficiency with which CUG codons are selected (Boeck and Kolakofsky, 1994; Grünert and Jackson, 1994). Our results show that WT1 gene expression is more complex than previously suspected and that the activity of these novel WT1 isoforms needs to be considered in biological assays involving WT1. TM3 and COS-1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). TM3 cells were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% horse serum and 2.5% fetal calf serum. COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Total RNA was isolated from mouse testis and TM3 cells by the LiCl/urea procedure (Auffray and Rougeon, 1980). 10 μg of RNA was electrophoresed into a 1.2% agarose/37% formaldehyde gel and blotted to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). Filters were probed with a P-labeled murine wt1 cDNA as described previously (Pelletier et al., 1991a). Crude nuclear extracts were prepared by resuspending washed cells into an equal packed cell volume of 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl, 10 mM KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Following a 10-min incubation on ice, the suspension was passed ten times through a 23 G needle. The nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in three times the packed cell volume of RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). For Western blots, 30 μg of the nuclear extract was fractionated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Following transfer to Immobilon-P (Millipore), the membranes were probed with the indicated antibodies, and proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using an ECL kit (Amersham Corp.). For immunoprecipitations, cells were grown to 80% confluency, washed in PBS, and preincubated in methionine-free medium for 1 h. Cellular protein was labeled with 200 μCi/ml of [S]methionine for 12 h. Following a wash with PBS, the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. For each immunoprecipitation, approximately 109 cpm of lysate was precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and preimmune serum for 1 h at 4°C. Incubation with specific antibody and protein A-Sepharose was then performed for 4 h at 4°C, after which time the immunoprecipitate was washed three times with RIPA buffer and once with PBS. Elution was performed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The eluted proteins were fractionated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, treated with EN3HANCE (New England Nuclear), and detected by exposure to X-Omat film (Kodak). The anti-WT1 polyclonal antibody C-19 was purchased from Santa Cruz and was generated against a peptide (LVRHHNMHQRNMTKLQLAL) at the carboxyl terminus of the WT1 protein. The anti-WT1 monoclonal antibodies 13B5 and 8A7 were raised against peptides designed to mimic WT1 isoforms containing or lacking the first alternatively spliced exon. Their characterization has been previously discussed (Mundlos et al., 1993). The rabbit anti-Wt1 polyclonal antibody 605 was raised against a GST-Wt1 fusion protein containing exons 2-9 of the murine wt1 gene. The rabbit polyclonal antibody S3, which recognizes only the CUG-initiated WT1 isoforms, was raised against the multiple antigenic peptide (Posnett et al., 1988) PASTCVPEPASQHTLR, located within the unique amino-terminal region produced by the CUG-initiated WT1 isoforms, and present in both mouse and human sequences (Fig. 2). (WT1 isoforms containing or lacking the first alternative splice site will be referred to as + or - 17 aa in the text.) Restriction enzymes and other DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. CMV-wt1 and pSP65 constructs lacking the 5′-UTR have been previously described (Goodyer et al., 1995; Pelletier et al., 1991b). To construct SP65-wt1 plasmids containing various 5′-UTRs, clones isolated from a mouse cDNA library that terminated at various regions within the 5′-UTR were used. The 5′ ends of these clones were excised from pKSII+ with EcoRI (which cleaves at the 5′ end of the cDNA) and NcoI (which cleaves at position 541 downstream of the initiator AUG) and subcloned into the same sites of SP65-wt1. To generate point mutations within the 5′-UTR, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the polymerase chain reaction and overlapping oligonucleotides harboring the desired change (Pelletier et al., 1991b). RNA polymerases were purchased from Promega. For in vitro transcriptions, plasmids were linearized with the indicated enzymes, and transcriptions were performed as described previously (Pelletier et al., 1991b). RNA transcripts were quantitated by monitoring incorporation of [3H]CTP (New England Nuclear). In vitro translations were performed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate using [S]methionine as directed by the manufacturer (Promega). To gain better insight into the regulation of wt1 gene expression, we screened a number of mouse cell lines for expression of wt1 mRNA. Of the lines tested, one of these, TM3 (derived from mouse testis), revealed significant levels of wt1 mRNA by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1A, lane 2). In addition to the expected 3.1-kilobase wt1 mRNA, a second mRNA species of 2.5 kilobases is present in testis (Fig. 1A, lane 1) and in TM3 cells (lane 2). The nature of the 2.5-kilobase cross-hybridizing mRNA species is not well defined but has been previously noted to be testis-specific and may arise from the use of an alternative polyadenylation site within the wt1 3′-UTR (Pelletier et al., 1991a). To detect Wt1 protein from TM3 cells, we made use of the polyclonal anti-Wt1 antibody, 605. This antibody, directed against amino acids 123-299, is capable of immunoprecipitating [S]methionine-labeled Wt1 from COS-1 cells transfected with a CMV-wt1 expression vector (denoted by a dot in Fig. 1B, lane 2). This polypeptide is not recognized by preimmune serum (Fig. 1B, lane 5), nor is it immunoprecipitated from untransfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 1B, lane 1). In immunoprecipitates from TM3 cells with the 605 antibody, we noted the presence of Wt1 protein (lane 3, denoted by a dot) as well as a polypeptide of 57 kDa (indicated by a × in Fig. 1B, lane 3). Like Wt1, this polypeptide is not visible in immunoprecipitates of TM3 cells with preimmune serum (Fig. 1B, lane 6). To extend these results and determine whether the 57-kDa polypeptide species was related to Wt1, we made use of two anti-WT1 monoclonal antibodies (Mundlos et al., 1993). Antibody 8A7 specifically recognizes WT1 isoforms lacking the 17 amino acids introduced by alternative splicing of exon 5 (−17 aa), whereas 13B5 specifically recognizes WT1 isoforms containing this alternatively spliced exon (+17 aa) (Mundlos et al., 1993). On Western blots of COS-1 cells transfected with CMV/wt1(-/-), 8A7 recognizes the Wt1(-/-) protein isoform as expected (denoted by a dot, Fig. 1C, lane 2). This polypeptide is not present in untransfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 1C, lane 1). In TM3 cells, a 57-kDa polypeptide is also recognized by this antibody (indicated by a × in Fig. 1C, lane 3). Antibody 13B5 recognizes the Wt1(+/-) isoform produced in COS-1 cells transfected with CMV/wt1(+/-) (indicated by a dot in Fig. 1C, lane 5). In TM3 cells, a 57-kDa polypeptide is also detected with this antibody (indicated by a × in Fig. 1C, lane 6). Upon prolonged exposure of these blots, the 47-49-kDa wt1 isoforms can also be detected in extracts of TM3 cells (data not shown). These results strongly suggest the existence of novel Wt1 isoforms containing or lacking the Wt1 exon V and having molecular masses 10 kDa higher than Wt1. In this manuscript, we will refer to these larger isoforms as Wt1 to distinguish them from the 47-49-kDa Wt1 isoforms. To determine whether Wt1 could be detected in normal tissues, nuclear extracts were prepared from murine ovaries and probed with the anti-WT1 antibody, C-19, directed against the WT1 carboxyl terminus. Extracts prepared from COS-1 cells transfected with CMV/wt1(-/-) (Fig. 1D, lane 2) or CMV/wt1(+/+) (Fig. 1D, lane 3) produced the appropriate wt1 isoforms and acted as standards on this blot. No Wt1 protein was present in untransfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 1D, lane 1). Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts from murine ovaries revealed the presence of the 47-49-kDa Wt1 isoforms, as well as the Wt1 isoforms (Fig. 1D, lane 4). A similar result was obtained with nuclear extracts from murine testis (data not shown). These results indicate that Wt1 is present in normal murine tissue. We felt it unlikely that WT1 was being generated from an alternatively spliced transcript because the structure of this mRNA has been extensively analyzed by S1 nuclease (Pelletier et al., 1991a) and RNase protection (Haber et al., 1991). We considered the possibility that an alternative translation initiation event was responsible for producing the novel WT1 polypeptides because examination of the murine and human nucleotide sequences upstream of the initiator AUG revealed the presence of two CUG codons 200 nucleotides upstream from and in frame with the initiator AUG codon (Fig. 2A). These CUG codons are conserved between human and mouse cDNAs, although their positions relative to the initiator AUG differ slightly. Because CUG codons are used as translation initiation codons by some eukaryotic mRNAs (see Introduction), we investigated the possibility that WT1 was generated by alternative translational initiation. We generated a polyclonal antibody against a peptide representing amino acids 9-24 of the predicted amino-terminal extension (boxed in Fig. 2A). This antibody, called S3, was used to screen a series of WTs for expression of WT1. Two Wt1 isoforms (+/- 17 aa) are detected by S3 in murine TM3 cells (Fig. 2B, lane 1). Two of the tumors examined also showed expression of WT1 (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 8). In our small sample cohort, there was a direct correlation between the presence of WT1 and the presence of WT1 protein (data not shown). We hypothesize that WT1 arises from alternative translation initiation on the WT1 mRNA template and contains a unique amino-terminal extension not present in WT1. To directly demonstrate that the amino-terminal extension of WT1 is due to alternative translational initiation, a series of deletion mutants was generated from the murine and human cDNAS (Fig. 3A). Two of the constructs {pKS/mwt1[+182] and pSP/hWT1[+200]} contain shortened 5′-UTRs that lack the above described CUG codons, whereas others {pKS/mwt1[+475] and pKS/hWT1[+378]} had 5′-UTRs that included these CUG codons (Fig. 3A). Following in vitro transcription and translation, [S]methionine-labeled protein products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In the absence of exogenously added mRNA, no protein product is detectable (Fig. 3B, lane 1). The truncation mutants, pKS/mwt1[+182] and pSP/hWT1[+200], produced only one polypeptide species having a molecular mass of 50 kDa (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 4, indicated by an arrowhead). These results are consistent with translational initiation occurring at the predicted AUG codon (underlined and bold in Fig. 2A). Translation of mRNA produced from pKS/mwt1[+475] and pKS/hWT1[+378] produced two polypeptide species, one having the expected molecular mass for an initiation event occurring at the initiator AUG, and one having a molecular mass identical to that of WT1 (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 5). Similar results were obtained upon translation of these mRNAs in a wheat germ extract, indicating that the above results are not specific to reticulocyte lysate (data not shown). These results are consistent with our hypothesis that alternative translational initiation is responsible for generating the Wt1 protein isoforms and demonstrate that both the human and murine mRNAs are competent for producing this protein species. To define the codon responsible for directing translation initiation of Wt1, a series of deletion and site-directed mutants were generated within the murine 5′-UTR (Fig. 4A). In addition to truncating various portions of the 5′-UTR, stop codons were introduced that flanked the CUG codons identified above (Fig. 2A), and mutations affecting the nature of each CUG codon were generated. Deletions within the first 507 nucleotides from the 5′-UTR of the wt1 mRNA did not abolish production of Wt1 (Fig. 4B, lanes 2-5), whereas a deletion removing all but 182 nucleotides of 5′-UTR generated a transcript unable to produce Wt1 (Fig. 4B, lane 11). Deletion of the Wt1 initiator AUG codon abolished production of Wt1, instead generating a polypeptide having a molecular mass of 37 kDa (Fig. 4B, lane 12, indicated by a small arrow). The molecular mass of this polypeptide is similar to that expected from internal initiation of ribosomes at a downstream, in frame AUG codon at position 378 (relative to the A of the initiator AUG codon). Introduction of a UGA codon 229 nucleotides upstream from and in frame with the AUG initiator codon did not affect production of Wt1 (Fig. 4B, lane 6), indicating that the Wt1 initiation codon must lie downstream of this site. On the other hand, placing a UGA codon at position 183, in frame, and upstream of the initiator codon generated an mRNA no longer capable of synthesizing Wt1 (Fig. 4B, lane 7). These data suggest that the signals responsible for Wt1 translation initiation lie between nucleotides +183 and +229. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to abolish the individual CUG codons at position 204 and 192 (see Fig. 2A). Converting CUG to CUC drastically affected expression of Wt1 while having little effect on production of Wt1 (Fig. 4B, lane 8). Expression of Wt1 was reduced 10-fold but not completely abolished. Mutagenesis of CUG to CUC had no effect on production of Wt1 (Fig. 4B, lane 9), and mutagenesis of both CUG codons had the same effect as altering only CUG (Fig. 4B, lane 10). These results strongly indicate that translational initiation at CUG is responsible for production of Wt1. We interpret the residual production of Wt1 observed with wt1[+475]([email protected]) and wt1[+475]([email protected]/192) to indicate that the CUG to CUC mutation is leaky and that nucleotide sequences flanking the CUG codon are influencing translation initiation at this site (Boeck and Kolakofsky, 1994; Grünert and Jackson, 1994). It is clear from the translation results obtained with wt1[+475]([email protected]) and wt1[+475]([email protected]) (Fig. 4B) that the Wt1 translation codon must lie between nucleotides +183 and +229. To rule out the possibility that the initiator codon for Wt1 was upstream or downstream of CUG and that the effects on translation initiation of mutating CUG were not the result of altering a motif that indirectly influenced the efficiency of initiation, four additional constructs were generated (Fig. 5A). One of these, wt1[+202], retains 202 base pairs of 5′-UTR and terminates at the G residue of CUG. Should translation of Wt1 commence downstream of CUG, then this construct should generate RNA competent for Wt1 production. Two other mutants alter the identity of CUG, converting it either to the more efficient AUG initiation codon, wt1[+475]([email protected]), or to a stop codon, wt1[+475]([email protected]). wt1[+475](Δ229-205) generates a 24-base pair in-frame deletion immediately upstream of the CUG codon and will abolish production of Wt1 only if the initiation codon lies upstream of CUG. Following in vitro transcription/translation of these plasmids and their respective mRNAs, the [S]methionine-labeled protein products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Translation of wt1[+475] produced both Wt1 and Wt1 as expected (Fig. 5B, lane 2). Only Wt1 was produced following translation of RNA synthesized from wt1[+202], consistent with the notion that the Wt1 initiation codon does not lie downstream of CUG. Mutation of CUG to an AUG codon increased the production of Wt1 (Fig. 5B, lane 4), consistent with the assignment of CUG as the initiation codon. Conversion of CUG to a UGA codon abolished production of Wt1, whereas production of Wt1 was still observed (Fig. 5B, lane 5). Removal of nucleotides 229-205 affected the overall translational efficiency of the mRNA produced (Fig. 5B, compare intensity of products in lane 7 with those in lane 6); however, the production of both Wt1 and Wt1 was still observed (Fig. 5B, lane 7), indicating that the Wt1 initiator codon does not lie upstream of CUG. These results indicate that CUG is the Wt1 initiation codon. To determine the subcellular localization of Wt1, an HA tag was placed in frame with and directly upstream from the CUG initiation codon (Fig. 6A). It was necessary to place the HA tag at the amino terminus because translation initiation at CUG is leaky and allows scanning ribosomes to initiate at the downstream, in frame ATG codon (See Fig. 3, Fig. 4, and Fig. 5), resulting in the production of both Wt1 and Wt1. The introduction of an HA tag immediately upstream of CUG was advantageous because the anti-HA monoclonal antibody, 12CA5, would specifically detect expression of only the 57-kDa isoform (Fig. 6B, lane 2). The construct CMV/wt1[+42] (Fig. 6A) produced only the 47-kDa isoform (Fig. 6B, lane 1) and contained an HA epitope at the carboxyl terminus. Immunofluorescence of COS-1 cells transfected with either CMV/wt1[+42] or CMV/wt1[HA/wt1] revealed that both isoforms localize to the nucleus (Fig. 6, C and D). In most transient transfection assays, WT1 functions as a repressor of transcription (see Introduction). To determine whether the novel amino-terminal domain of Wt1 altered the transcriptional properties of Wt1, 3 wt1/GAL4 expression vectors were generated (Fig. 7A). The Wt1 zinc fingers were replaced with the DNA binding domain of GAL4 (Ma and Ptashne, 1987), enabling the scoring of Wt1 activity on a promoter containing GAL4 binding sites. In such a context, Wt1 produced from CMV/wt1[+182/GAL4] is able to repress transcription of the cat gene under TK promoter control 10-fold, similar to levels obtained with CMV/wt1[+475/GAL4], which produces Wt1 and Wt1 (Fig. 7B). Western blot analysis indicated that Wt1 and Wt1 were produced from CMV/wt1[+475/GAL4] to approximately equal levels. 2W. Bruening, unpublished data.Transient transfections with CMV/wt1[HA/wt1/GAL4], which only produces Wt1 (data not shown), represses CAT production 5-fold (Fig. 7B). These results demonstrate that in the system we have analyzed, the amino-terminal extension of Wt1 does not significantly change the transcriptional properties of Wt1. The WT1 gene products are necessary for regulating normal differentiation of the urogenital system. Mutations in the WT1 gene result in malformations of the urogenital system as well as predispose to WTs. The structure of the WT1 gene indicates that it should produce four alternatively spliced mRNAs that direct the synthesis of isoforms having molecular masses of 47-49 kDa. In this report, we demonstrate that WT1 gene expression is more complex than anticipated, with a non-AUG translational initiation event producing additional protein isoforms of 54-56 kDa (WT1). We have found WT1 to be expressed in a number of tissues and cells including murine TM3 cells (Fig. 1), murine ovaries (Fig. 1), murine testis (data not shown), immortalized rat granulosa cells (data not shown), and human K562 cells (data not shown). We have been unable to accurately establish the relative ratio of WT1 to WT1 in these cells and tissues, because the antibodies we are employing recognize the isoforms with different efficiencies (e.g.Fig. 1, compare C with B), perhaps due to differences in protein conformation or isoform-specific post-translational modifications. However, our data directly demonstrates that WT1 isoforms containing or lacking the first alternatively spliced exon are generated. Using isoform-specific antibodies, we were able to detect both isoforms in TM3 cells (Fig. 1C). In addition, two WT1 isoforms are clearly detectable on Western blots of whole cell extracts of WTs (Fig. 2B). Although we have not analyzed the presence or the absence of the second alternative splice site within WT1, there is no reason not to suspect its presence. Our data, taken together with the documented alternative splicing of the WT1 gene (Haber et al., 1991) and RNA editing (Sharma et al., 1994), indicate that this gene may produce as many as 16 different protein isoforms. To date, WT1 functional studies have generally been performed using expression vectors capable of producing only the 47-49-kDa isoforms. Given that the WT1 gene products can oligomerize (Reddy et al., 1995; Moffett et al., 1995) and that the isoform ratio is important for proper urogenital system development (Bruening et al., 1992), functional studies need to take into account the contribution of WT1 isoforms to the overall biological function of the WT1 gene, including the possible interplay of the various isoforms. Our data indicate that CUG is the initiation codon responsible for directing synthesis of Wt1. A number of mRNAs use non-AUG initiation events to generate amino-terminally extended isoforms (see Introduction). The Wt1 initiator CUG is in a favorable consensus sequence (5′-XXAXXCUGG-3′, where the important nucleotide residues are underlined) (Kozak, 1987), and these likely play a role in directing translational initiation. The identity of the codon at this position is important in determining the efficiency with which this site is recognized, because mutagenesis of the initiation codon CUG to CUC significantly reduced (15-fold) the amount of Wt1 produced (Fig. 4). However, it is clear that additional signals influence initiation at this site since the CUG to CUC mutation reduced but did not completely abolish translation initiation (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, deleting 24 nucleotides immediately upstream of CUG significantly reduced the overall translational efficiency of the template mRNA (Fig. 5B, compare lanes 7 and 6). Sequences downstream of non-AUG initiation codons have been shown to be important for determining efficiency of recognition of the start codons (Boeck and Kolakofsky, 1994; Grünert and Jackson, 1994). However, in the case of the wt1 template, the deletion of sequences upstream of CUG has a global effect on translation initiation, including at the downstream AUG codon. In the case of fibroblast growth factor-2 mRNA, a ribosome landing pad is postulated to directly recruit 43S preinitiation complexes and guide them to a non-AUG codon (Vagner et al., 1995). An internal ribosome binding site near CUG on the wt1 mRNA template could account for the effects seen on global initiation by wt1[+475](Δ229-205) (Fig. 5B). Alternatively, the overall stability of the template may be affected by this 24-nucleotide deletion. The degree of conservation between the amino-terminal extension of the murine and human WT1 isoforms is not as high as between the WT1 proteins. At the amino acid level, the murine and human WT1 isoforms are 96% identical (Buckler et al., 1991), but the amino-terminal extensions of the human and murine WT1 isoforms are only 65% identical. However, the first 35 amino acids of WT1 are quite conserved (88% identical) and may encode a functional domain. Alternatively, overall charge or conformation may be more important to the function of this domain rather than primary sequence per se. We have analyzed the genomic region encoding the amino-terminal extension of WT1 for possible mutations in WTs using polymerase chain reaction single stranded conformational polymorphisms (Varanasi et al., 1994).2 Examination of this region in over 100 WTs failed to detect any mutations. This is not particularly surprising because the majority of WT1 mutations occur within the DNA binding domain (Bruening et al., 1992; Pelletier et al., 1991b; Varanasi et al., 1994) with very few mutations occurring outside of this region. Several investigators have noted the presence of a 54-56-kDa contaminating polypeptide in studies involving immunoprecipitation of WT1. Given our results, these polypeptides likely represent WT1 isoforms generated by translation initiation at CUG. The presence of such isoforms is apparent in Fig. 3F of Larrson et al.(1995), displaying an immunoprecipitation on nuclear extracts with anti-WT1 antibodies from the mesonephric cell line, M15. A protein with similar electrophoretic properties as WT1 was also detected by Rackley et al.(1993) on an immunoblot analysis of nuclear extracts prepared from the WT1-expressing kidney cell line, 293 (see Fig. 3a; Rackley et al.(1993)). The functional significance of producing WT1 isoforms with an amino-terminal extension is not obvious. The amino-terminal domain on its own does not have a strong trans effect on transcription because fusion constructs containing this domain fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain did not significantly affect transcription of an appropriate reporter in transient transfection experiments.2 This domain may be involved in a number of other activities such as heterodimer formation, subnuclear localization, or regulation of WT1 intrinsic activity. Our description of a non-AUG translation event at the WT1 locus indicates that the overall complexity of WT1 regulation is greater than previously suspected. Biological assays involving all WT1 isoforms should present a better picture of the role of WT1 in normal and abnormal urogenital system development."

We show here that it is a potent inhibitor of the mammalian facilitative hexose transporter GLUT1. In human HL-60 cells, which express GLUT1, genistein inhibited the transport of dehydroascorbic acid, deoxyglucose, and methylglucose in a dose-dependent manner. Transport was not affected by daidzein, an inactive genistein analog that does not inhibit protein-tyrosine kinase activity, or by the general protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine. Genistein inhibited the uptake of deoxyglucose and dehydroascorbic acid in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing GLUT1 in a similar dose-dependent manner. Genistein also inhibited the uptake of deoxyglucose in human erythrocytes indicating that its effect on glucose transporter function is cell-independent. The inhibitory action of genistein on transport was instantaneous, with no additional effect observed in cells preincubated with it for various periods of time. Genistein did not alter the uptake of leucine by HL-60 cells, indicating that its inhibitory effect was specific for the glucose transporters. The inhibitory effect of genistein was of the competitive type, with a K of approximately 12 μM for inhibition of the transport of both methylglucose and deoxyglucose. Binding studies showed that genistein inhibited glucose-displaceable binding of cytochalasin B to GLUT1 in erythrocyte ghosts in a competitive manner, with a K of 7 μM. These data indicate that genistein inhibits the transport of dehydroascorbic acid and hexoses by directly interacting with the hexose transporter GLUT1 and interfering with its transport activity, rather than as a consequence of its known ability to inhibit protein-tyrosine kinases. These observations indicate that some of the many effects of genistein on cellular physiology may be related to its ability to disrupt the normal cellular flux of substrates through GLUT1, a hexose transporter universally expressed in cells, and is responsible for the basal uptake of glucose.

The data suggest that the facilitative glucose transporters may be the universal transporters of both glucose and dehydroascorbic acid in mammalian cells. Many cellular functions are regulated at the levels of gene expression and of protein function by discrete phosphorylation-dephosphorylation events. Tyrosine phosphorylation plays a major role in the transduction of cellular signals induced by the binding of insulin to its cognate receptor(18.Lee J. Pilch P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C319-C334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the effect of insulin on GLUT4 is an important point of regulation for glucose transport in mammalian cells. Insulin induces the translocation of GLUT4 from intracellular membrane pools to the cell surface(19.Cushman S.W. Wardzala L.J. J. Biol.

The multiple effects of genistein in cellular systems are presumed to reflect its ability to inhibit the activity of protein-tyrosine kinases. We show here that genistein is a potent inhibitor of the functional activity of the glucose transporters present in human myeloid HL-60 cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 1The abbreviation used is: CHOChinese hamster ovary.cells overexpressing the glucose transporter GLUT1, and human erythrocytes. The characteristics and the specificity of the inhibition, and the results of studies showing that genistein affects the glucose-displaceable binding of cytochalasin B to GLUT1 in erythrocyte membranes, indicate that the effect of genistein is related to its direct interaction with GLUT1. These results emphasize the ability of GLUT1 to interact with molecules structurally unrelated to glucose and have important implications for our understanding of the effects of genistein on cellular physiology in normal and malignant cells. Chinese hamster ovary. HL-60 cells were cultured in Iscove's-modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cell viability was greater than 95%, as determined by trypan blue exclusion. Chinese hamster ovary cells were cultured in Iscove's-modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.25 mg/ml G418.

Human erythrocytes were purified from outdated blood samples obtained by the Hematology Service of the Regional Hospital in Valdivia. For uptake assays(17.Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Velásquez F.V.

Solutions of ascorbic acid were prepared daily before use and kept at 4°C in incubation buffer containing 0.1 mM dithiothreitol. For dehydroascorbate uptake experiments, ascorbate oxidase (0.1 to 10 units) was added to the incubation mixture to generate dehydroascorbic acid(16.Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Zhang R.H. Farber C.M. Golde D.W. Blood. 1994; 84: 1628-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Uptake was stopped by washing the cells in cold (4°C) stopping solution (phosphate-buffered saline without Ca and Mg). The cells were solubilized in Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and processed for liquid scintillation counting. When testing the effects of different competitors and inhibitors on uptake, they were added at the beginning of the experiment from concentrated stock solutions freshly prepared, or, alternatively, the cells were preincubated with them. Pink erythrocyte ghosts were prepared from washed red cells by hypotonic lysis in 5 mM NaHPO buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2 mM EDTA, followed by four successive centrifugation/wash cycles in the same buffer, and were resealed in 10 mM NaHPO buffer, pH 7.4(42.Carruthers A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11028-11037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific binding of cytochalasin B to functional glucose carriers was estimated from the difference between cytochalasin B bound in the presence of 500 mML-glucose and 500 mMD-glucose. Equilibrium cytochalasin B binding was initiated by the addition of the membrane preparation (suspended in 10 mM NaHPO buffer, pH 7.4) to the binding assay solution. The latter contains 10 mM NaHPO buffer, pH 7.4, cytochalasin E, [4-3H]cytochalasin B, and D- or Lglucose. The total volume of the reaction mixture was 150 μl. The final composition was 0.06 to 0.1 mg/ml erythrocyte membrane protein (equivalent to 1-1.6 × 108 cells), 10 μM cytochalasin E, 500 mMD- or L-glucose, 0.02-0.04 μCi of [4-3H]cytochalasin B (11.9 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN), and cold cytochalasin B for final concentrations of 0.01 to 5 μM. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min before collecting the membranes by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The amount of specifically bound cytochalasin B was estimated by determining the amount of radioactive ligand associated with the membrane pellet and from the difference in the amount of soluble radioactivity before and after centrifugation. Both determinations gave similar results. Genistein inhibited the uptake of deoxyglucose and dehydroascorbic acid by HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner, with 50% inhibition observed at 12-15 μM genistein (Fig. 1A). 100 μM genistein completely blocked the uptake of dehydroascorbic acid and deoxyglucose. The HL-60 cells express the glucose transporter GLUT1, and the functional characteristics of this transporter are similar to those described for GLUT1 present in other cell types, including its ability to transport dehydroascorbic acid and D- but not L-hexoses, and its sensitivity to inhibition by cytochalasin B but not cytochalasin E(16.Vera J.C.

The above assays were carried out using cells preincubated with genistein for 30 min, a typical protocol used in studies analyzing the effect of genistein on the activity of cellular protein-tyrosine kinases. As uptake under these conditions is a complex function of transport and intracellular trapping of the transported substrate, genistein could be inhibiting uptake at either of these steps. Total inhibition of deoxyglucose (Fig. 1B) and dehydroascorbic acid (data not shown) transport was observed in cells preincubated with 100 μM genistein from 0 to 60 min, indicating that the full inhibitory effect of genistein on uptake develops instantaneously and no preincubation is required. Genistein affects multiple cellular activities as a result of its ability to inhibit the activity of protein-tyrosine kinases(29.Okura A. Arakawa H. Oka H. Yoshinari T. Monden Y. Biochem. Biophys.

The observed inhibition of deoxyglucose and dehydroascorbate uptake by genistein therefore could be linked to the inhibition of phosphorylation events involved in the cellular uptake of these compounds. While protein phosphorylation can modulate the activity of GLUT4(23.Joost H.G. Weber T.M. Cushman S.W. Simpson I.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 3348-3351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there is no evidence indicating that GLUT1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. Therefore, we hypothesized that the inhibitory effects of genistein on transport reflect a direct action of genistein on the glucose transporters rather than inhibition of cellular protein-tyrosine kinases. Support for this hypothesis was obtained from experiments analyzing the effect of genistein under experimental conditions tailored to measure transport as distinct to accumulation(17.Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Velásquez F.V. Zhang R.H. Concha I.I. Golde D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23706-23712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We determined the dose dependence of genistein's effect on the transport of deoxyglucose, dehydroascorbic acid, methylglucose, and leucine in HL-60 cells using a 30-s uptake assay. Methylglucose is not trapped or metabolized, and, therefore, its kinetics of transport can define the time frame at which transport is still occurring under initial velocity conditions. We measured the transport of leucine to control for the specificity of the effect of genistein on the activity of the glucose transporters, as opposed to possible nonspecific effects on membrane transport. Leucine is transported into cells by transport systems functionally unrelated to the glucose transporters(44.Kakuda D.K. MacLeod C.L. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 93-108PubMed Google Scholar). The initial rate of transport of dehydroascorbic acid, deoxyglucose, methylglucose, and leucine by the HL-60 cells was linear for the first 60 s of uptake (data not shown), validating the assay for the determination of the kinetic constants of transport. When genistein was added at the beginning of the uptake assays, it inhibited the transport of dehydroascorbic acid, deoxyglucose, and methylglucose, with 50% inhibition observed at 10-15 μM genistein (Fig. 2, A-C). Complete inhibition of transport was observed at 100 μM genistein, but some transport was observed at concentrations of genistein greater than 100 μM. No effect of genistein on the transport of leucine by the HL-60 cells was observed in these studies, with less than 20% inhibition at 100 μM genistein (Fig. 2D), indicating the specificity of the effect of genistein on the activity of the glucose transporters and militating against the possibility that it could be caused by a general biological effect on the cell membrane. The specificity of the effect of genistein was further confirmed in experiments which showed that daidzein (4′,7-dihydroxyisoflavone), an analog of genistein that lacks a hydroxyl group at position 4 (Fig. 2, E and F) did not affect the transport of dehydroascorbic acid, deoxyglucose, methylglucose, or leucine in the HL-60 cells (Fig. 2, A-D). Similarly, staurosporine, a general inhibitor of protein phosphorylation, did not affect the transport of dehydroascorbic acid, deoxyglucose, methylglucose, or leucine (data not shown) at concentrations (1-10 μM) known to completely block protein phosphorylation in HL-60 cells(45.Ding D.X. Rivas C.I. Heaney M.L. Raines M.A. Vera J.C. Golde D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2537-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Genistein competitively inhibited the transport of both deoxyglucose and methylglucose in HL-60 cells with a K of approximately 15 μM (Fig. 3, A-D). These observations indicate a direct interaction of genistein with the glucose transporter expressed by HL-60 cells.Figure 3Genistein inhibits in a competitive manner the transport of deoxyglucose and methylglucose in HL-60 cells.

Immunoblotting experiments using anti-GLUT1 antibodies revealed that the transfected cells expressed an increased number of glucose transporters as compared to control cells stably transfected with a plasmid carrying the cDNA for the human placental insulin receptor (data not shown). CHO cells overexpressing GLUT1 had an increased capacity to take up deoxyglucose and dehydroascorbic acid as compared to the control cells, and uptake was linear for at least 10 min (Fig. 4, A and B). Genistein caused a dose-dependent inhibition of uptake and, at 100 μM, completely inhibited uptake of both dehydroascorbic acid and deoxyglucose in the GLUT1-expressing as well as the control cells (Fig. 4, C and D). In both cell lines, 50% inhibition of uptake was observed at approximately 12 μM genistein. These results show that the effect of genistein on the activity of GLUT1 is independent of the cell context in which the transporters are expressed. The simplest interpretation of the above results is that genistein interferes with the transport of dehydroascorbic acid, deoxyglucose, and methylglucose by directly interacting with GLUT1. Genistein inhibited the uptake of deoxyglucose in human erythrocytes in a dose-dependent manner, with 50% inhibition observed at approximately 15 μM genistein (Fig. 5A). Kinetic analyses indicated that genistein competitively inhibited the uptake of deoxyglucose with a K of about 12 μM (Fig. 5, B and C). The data, therefore, are consistent with the direct interaction of genistein with the erythrocyte glucose transporter. We further tested this hypothesis by analyzing the effect of genistein on the binding of radiolabeled cytochalasin B to the hexose transporters present in purified human erythrocyte ghosts.

Here we report that overexpressing Bax induces apoptosis in a mammalian fibroblast cell line, and we identify a novel, short “suicide domain” in Bax that is required for this effect. Inserting this domain in place of the corresponding, divergent sequence in Bcl-2 converts Bcl-2 from an inhibitor into an activator of cell death.

Activation (after 15 min of incubation) of basal PKC activity was observed in cytosolic fractions of rat colonic epithelium by aldosterone, fludrocortisone, and deoxycorticosterone acetate. In all instances, PKC activation was inhibited by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide (GF109203X). Hydrocortisone failed to activate PKC activity. Stimulation of basal intracellular free calcium [Ca] was observed, in isolated rat colonic crypts, following aldosterone addition. This stimulatory effect was inhibited by the PKC inhibitor, chelerythrine chloride. Hydrocortisone failed to increase [Ca]. These results indicate that intracellular signaling for aldosterone involves changes in [Ca] via activation of PKC.

https://openalex.org/W2113420540,"B cell antigen receptor (BCR)-mediated signal transduction controls B cell proliferation and differentiation. The BCR activates Ras, presumably by the formation of a Shc-Grb2 adaptor complex, which recruits the Grb2-associated guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos to the plasma membrane. In order to reveal additional BCR-induced signaling events involving the Grb2 adaptor, we undertook the isolation of Grb2-binding proteins. Using the yeast two-hybrid system and bacterial fusion proteins, Vav and C3G were identified as Grb2 binders. Vav is a putative nucleotide exchange factor and a target for BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. C3G exerts nucleotide exchange activity on the Ras-related Rap1 protein. While Sos binds to both Grb2 Src homology-3 (SH3) domains, Vav was found to associate selectively with the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain, while C3G bound selectively to the amino-terminal SH3 domain of bacterially expressed Grb2. Despite the association of Vav with Grb2 in vitro, we could not demonstrate an interaction between endogenous Vav and Grb2 molecules in primary B cells. Instead, Vav was found to inducibly associate with the Grb2-related adaptor protein Crk upon BCR stimulation. C3G did not bind to either Grb2, Shc, or Crk in vivo. Instead, C3G was found in association with the Crk-L adaptor, both before and after BCR stimulation. We show that Crk-L also participates in BCR signaling, since it inducibly interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated Cbl. We conclude that, in addition to Sos, Vav and C3G play a role in BCR-mediated signal transduction. These guanine nucleotide exchange factors selectively associate with Grb2, Crk, and Crk-L, respectively, which may serve to direct them to different target molecules. Since Cbl binds to Grb2, Crk, as well as Crk-L, we hypothesize that Cbl may affect the function of all three exchangers. B cell antigen receptor (BCR)-mediated signal transduction controls B cell proliferation and differentiation. The BCR activates Ras, presumably by the formation of a Shc-Grb2 adaptor complex, which recruits the Grb2-associated guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos to the plasma membrane. In order to reveal additional BCR-induced signaling events involving the Grb2 adaptor, we undertook the isolation of Grb2-binding proteins. Using the yeast two-hybrid system and bacterial fusion proteins, Vav and C3G were identified as Grb2 binders. Vav is a putative nucleotide exchange factor and a target for BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. C3G exerts nucleotide exchange activity on the Ras-related Rap1 protein. While Sos binds to both Grb2 Src homology-3 (SH3) domains, Vav was found to associate selectively with the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain, while C3G bound selectively to the amino-terminal SH3 domain of bacterially expressed Grb2. Despite the association of Vav with Grb2 in vitro, we could not demonstrate an interaction between endogenous Vav and Grb2 molecules in primary B cells. Instead, Vav was found to inducibly associate with the Grb2-related adaptor protein Crk upon BCR stimulation. C3G did not bind to either Grb2, Shc, or Crk in vivo.

Since Cbl binds to Grb2, Crk, as well as Crk-L, we hypothesize that Cbl may affect the function of all three exchangers.

Cowburn D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 828-837Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). SH3 domains specifically interact with proline rich sequences (2.Cicchetti P. Mayer B.J. Thiel G. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 257: 803-806Crossref Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and thereby control cellular localization (3.Bar-Sagi D. Rotin D. Batzer A. Mandiyan V. Schlessinger J.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), or catalytic activity (5.Pleiman C.M. Hertz W.M. Cambier J.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) of associating proteins. One example illustrating the importance of SH3 domain-mediated intermolecular interactions is the complex formation between the adaptor protein Grb2 and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) son of sevenless (Sos)(6.Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Grb2 consists of an SH2 domain, flanked by two SH3 domains. Sos is constitutively associated with the SH3 domains of Grb2 and regulates Ras activity by converting GDP-Ras to the GTP-bound state(7.Rozakis-Adcock M.R. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R.

Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Translocation of Sos from the cytosol to the plasma membrane is thought to play a key role in Ras activation(9.Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. Al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Recruitment of the Grb2-Sos complex to the plasma membrane may be mediated by direct association of the Grb2 SH2 domain with a tyrosine-phosphorylated membrane molecule or by indirect association via the tyrosine-phosphorylated adaptor protein Shc. Receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity(7.Rozakis-Adcock M.R. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T.

In lymphocytes, stimulation of T cell antigen receptor and BCR induces Ras activation, which most likely involves Sos.Vav is exclusively found in hematopoietic cells. It contains multiple structural motifs, including one SH2 and two SH3 domains, a pleckstrin homology domain, as well as a region found in the human Dbl oncogene product(15.Katzav S. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2283-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 16.Adams J.M. Houston H. Allen J. Lints T. Harvey R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 611-618PubMed Google Scholar). Dbl is a GDP-GTP exchange factor for the Ras-like polypeptide Cdc42(18.Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but Cdc42 has not been defined as a target for Vav. Vav was reported to exert nucleotide exchange activity on Ras (19.Gulbins E. Coggeshall K.M. Langlet C. Baier G. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Burn P. Wittinghofer A. Katzav S. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 906-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, other authors found that Vav cooperates with Ras to transform fibroblasts, but is not an exchange factor for Ras(20.Bustelo X.R. Suen K.-L. Leftheris K. Meyers C.A. Barbacid M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2405-2413PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Khosravi-Far R. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Solski P.A. Eva A. Burridge K. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6848-6857Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Therefore, the target of the Dbl domain in Vav remains unidentified. Vav is phosphorylated on tyrosine upon T cell antigen receptor, Fc receptor(22.Margolis B. Hu P. Katzav S. Li W. Oliver J.M. Ullrich A. Weiss A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1992; 356: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 23.Bustelo X.R. Ledbetter J.A. Barbacid M.

Science. 1992; 256: 1196-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and cytokine receptor (25.Matsuguchi T. Inhorn R.C. Carlesso N. Xu G. Druker B. Griffin J.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) stimulation. Mice with a disrupted Vav gene die early during development, indicating that Vav has an essential function prior to the onset of hematopoiesis (26.Zmuidzinas A. Fischer K.-D. Lira S.A. Forrester L. Bryant S. Bernstein A. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Studies in chimeric mice have indicated that Vav also plays a role in the differentiation and function of T and B cells(27.Tarakhovsky A. Turner M. Schaal S. Mee P.J. Duddy L.P. Rajewsky K. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 28.Zhang R. Alt F.W. Davidson L. Orkin S.H. Swat W.

Nature. 1995; 374: 474-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar).C3G was identified as a protein binding to a bacterially expressed SH3 domain of the adaptor protein Crk (30.Tanaka S. Moreshita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and it associates with endogenous Crk in PC12 cells(31.Matsuda M. Hashimoto Y. Muroya K. Hasegawa H. Kurata T. Tanaka S. Nakamura S. Hattori S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5495-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In vitro, C3G can also interact with SH3 domains of Grb2(30.Tanaka S. Moreshita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of C3G has homology with GEFs for Ras and C3G can complement Cdc25 function in yeast(30.Tanaka S. Moreshita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Recently, however, Rap1 rather than Ras, was identified as a target for C3G in mammalian cells(32.Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The function of C3G in lymphocytes has not yet been addressed.In this study, we have identified Vav and C3G as Grb2 binders, using the yeast two-hybrid system and bacterial fusion proteins, respectively. However, in vivo in B lymphocytes, only Sos participates in a Shc-Grb2 complex. Vav does not bind detectably to Shc or Grb2, but inducibly associates with Crk upon BCR stimulation. C3G was not detected in Shc, Grb2, or Crk complexes, but constitutively interacts with Crk-L. We demonstrate that Grb2, Crk, as well as Crk-L interact with the Cbl proto-oncogene product(33.Blake T.J. Shapiro M. Morse III, H.C. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 653-657PubMed Google Scholar), which is a major target for BCR-induced protein-tyrosine kinase activity(34.Cory G.O.C. Lovering R.C. Hinshelwood S. MacCarthy-Morrogh L. Levinsky R.J. Kinnon C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This indicates that all three adaptors participate in BCR-induced signaling. Given their differential interaction with Sos, Vav, and C3G, we postulate that Grb2, Crk, and Crk-L selectively target the functions of these nucleotide exchangers in response to BCR stimulation.MATERIALS AND METHODSCellsThe human Burkitt lymphoma lines Ramos and Daudi, which are mature B cell lines expressing transmembrane immunoglobulin (Ig)M complexes, were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM), supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Primary human B cells were isolated from tonsils by depletion of T cells. The total cell suspension was incubated with a mixture of anti-CD3 and anti-CD2 mAb, followed by goat anti-mouse Ig-conjugated magnetic beads (Advanced Magnetics, Cambridge, MA). The remaining cell suspension, containing 80% B cells, was cultured for 1 h in IMDM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Prior to stimulation with anti-Ig reagent, the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C in IMDM without serum.AntibodiesPolyclonal rabbit anti-Grb2 and anti-Shc sera were kindly provided by Dr. J. L. Bos (Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands). They were raised against a fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the complete Grb2 protein and against a fusion protein of GST and the SH2 domain of Shc, respectively. Anti-Crk mAb, which recognizes Crk-I and Crk-II forms, but not Crk-L, was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KT). Anti-Crk-L serum was purchased form Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal goat anti-human Ig reagent (Tago Immunologicals, Burlingame, CA) was used for B cell stimulation. The anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Anti-human Vav mAb and rabbit anti-murine Sos1 polyclonal serum were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Rabbit anti-C3G serum, used for immunoprecipitation, and anti-C3G mAb, used for immunoblotting(34.Cory G.O.C. Lovering R.C. Hinshelwood S. MacCarthy-Morrogh L. Levinsky R.J. Kinnon C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Dr. M. Matsuda (National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Japan). Protein A, conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, was obtained from Sigma and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark).Bacterial Fusion ProteinscDNA encoding the separate Grb2 domains were synthesized by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on the murine Grb2 cDNA template (kindly provided by Dr. J. L. Bos), using the following primers: sense (5′-AGACGGATCCGAAGCCATCGCCAAATATGACT) and antisense (5′-AGACGAATTCTCACGGATGTGGTTTCATTTCTAT) for the amino-terminal SH3 domain (SH3-N), sense (5′-AGACGGATCCATGAAACCACATCCGTGGTTT) and antisense (5′-AGACGAATTCTCAGACGTATGTCGGCTGCTGTGG) for the SH2 domain, sense (5′-AGACGGATCCACATACGTCCAGGCCCTCTTTG) and antisense (5′-AGACGAATTCTTAGACGTTCCGGTTCACGGGGGTG) for the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain (SH3-C). The PCR products and the full-length Grb2 cDNA were cloned into the pGEX bacterial expression plasmid, which contains the GST gene(35.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar). Bacterial GST-Grb2 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and affinity-purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) as described(35.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar).Use of the Yeast Two-hybrid Cloning SystemThe principle of the yeast two hybrid cDNA cloning system was originally described by Fields and Song(36.Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). We have used a cDNA library of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human lymphocytes, which was kindly provided by Dr. S. J. Elledge (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). The cDNA library was cloned into the pACT yeast expression vector, which encodes the Leu2 marker and the Gal4 transactivation domain (TAD). cDNAs were inserted into the XhoI site, downstream of the Gal4 TAD(37.Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). The Grb2 protein, or its separate SH3 domains, were used as “bait.” cDNA was generated by PCR and cloned into expression plasmids encoding the Gal4 DNA binding domain (DBD) as follows. Full-length Grb2, SH3-N and SH3-C domain cDNAs were generated by PCR on the murine Grb2 cDNA template using the following primers: sense (5′-AGACCCATGGAAGCCATCGCCAAATATGACT) and antisense (5′-AGACGAATTCTTAGACGTTCCGGTTCACTGGGGTG) for full-length Grb2, sense (5′-AGACCCATGGAAGCCATCGCCAAATATGACT) and antisense (5′-AGACGAATTCTCACGGATGTGGTTTCATTTCTAT) for SH3-N, sense (5′-AGACGGATCCACATACGTCCAGGCCCTCTTTG) and antisense (5′-AGACGAATTCTTAGACGTTCCGGTTCACGGTTCACGGGGGTG) for SH3-C. In addition, the cytoplasmic tail of the B29 molecule was used as control bait. The relevant B29 cDNA was generated by PCR on the full length cDNA template (38.Verschuren M.C. Comans-Bitter W.M. Kapteijn C.A. Mason D.Y. Brouns G.S. Borst J. Drexler H.G. van Dongen J.J.M. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1993; 7: 1939-1947PubMed Google Scholar) using the following primers: (5′-AGACGGATCCGACAAGGATGACAGCAAGGCTG-3′) and antisense (5′-AGACGAATTCTCACTCCTGGCCCTGGGTGCT). SH3-C Grb2 and B29 PCR products were ligated into the SmaI site of the yeast expression vector pPC97(39.Chevray P.M. Natans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). This plasmid encodes the Gal4 DBD and the Leu2 marker. To allow selection, an ApaI/BglII fragment encoding Gal4 DBD-Grb2 or Gal4 DBD-B29 fusion products was ligated into the pPC86 (39.Chevray P.M. Natans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) yeast expression plasmid, which contains the trp1 marker. Full-length Grb2 and SH3-N Grb2 PCR products were ligated into the PMD4 plasmid at the SmaI site. The PMD4 plasmid was constructed by M. van Dijk and L. van't Veer (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). In this construct, the Gal4 TAD sequence of pPC86 was replaced by the Gal DBD sequence from pPC97. The resulting plasmid contains the leu2 marker necessary for selection. Gal4 transcriptional activity was read out by activation of the lacZ and his3 genes(39.Chevray P.M. Natans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequence analysis of cDNAs of interest was performed with the sequencing kit of Pharmacia Biotech Inc. according to manufacturer's instructions.Cell Stimulation, Protein Isolation, and ImmunoblottingRamos, Daudi, or tonsillar B cells were washed twice in IMDM without fetal calf serum. After washing, cells, resuspended at 10 × 106/ml in serum-free medium per sample, were stimulated for 5 min at 37°C with polyclonal anti-human Ig at 20 μg/ml. Cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 containing lysis buffer (30 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μM aprotinin, 1 μM leupeptin, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mM sodium fluoride). For immunoprecipitation, lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 13,000 × g and by two incubations with normal rabbit serum and protein A-Sepharose CL4B beads. Subsequently, lysates were incubated for 2 h with 1 μl of antiserum and 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL4B beads. For protein isolation with GST fusion proteins, lysates were precleared with GST and glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), followed by a 2-h incubation with 2 μg of specific GST fusion protein and 5 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads. Protein isolates were washed four times in lysis buffer with 1% Nonidet P-40, eluted, and denatured in sample buffer (60 mM Tris•HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) at 95°C for 5 min and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Samples were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. Prior to immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-Vav, and anti-C3G reagents, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked for 2 h at 4°C with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS, 0.2% Tween (PBS/T). Prior to anti-Sos immunoblotting, membranes were blocked for 2 h at 4°C with in 2% non-fat milk in PBS/T. Membranes were incubated for 4 h at 4°C in PBS/T, 0.1% bovine serum albumin with the indicated primary antibodies at a dilution of 1:100 for anti-C3G, 1:1000 for anti-Vav, 1:500 for anti-Sos, and 1:2000 for 4G10. Membranes were washed three times with PBS/T and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A or secondary antibody in PBS/T, 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 4°C. Membranes were washed three times in PBS/T, and visualization was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom).RESULTSIsolation of the Vav Protein as a Grb2 Binder by the Use of the Yeast Two-hybrid SystemTo identify B cell-derived molecules that can interact with Grb2, the yeast two hybrid system was used(36.Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). Full-length Grb2 was fused to the DBD of the Gal4 transcription factor. This Gal4 DBD-Grb2 fusion protein bait was expressed in a yeast strain containing lacZ and his3 reporter genes, together with an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B lymphocyte cDNA library fused with the GAL4 TAD. Colonies expressing a B cell-derived protein that effectively binds to Grb2 were revealed by blue staining and the capacity to grow on medium without histidine. Out of 38 colonies selected in this way, one contained cDNA sequences of the Vav oncogene. The Gal4 TAD-Vav fusion protein only activated the reporter genes when coexpressed with the Gal4 DBD-Grb2 fusion protein and not when co-expressed with the Gal4 DBD-B29 chimeric protein or other unrelated Gal4 DBD chimeras (Fig. 1A and results not shown). The cDNA insert comprised the 3′ 1461 base pairs of the Vav cDNA(15.Katzav S. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2283-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), encoding the SH2 domain and the two SH3 domains (Fig. 1B). This part of the molecule contains two proline-rich regions. Of these, the sequence PPPGAFGP is most homologous to the described binding site of the Grb2 SH3 domain(40.Bowtell D. Fu P. Simon M. Senior P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6511-6518Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To identify the domain of Grb2 responsible for interaction with Vav in yeast, the SH3-N and SH3-C domains were expressed as Gal4 DBD chimeras, together with the Vav protein fragment encoded by the 1461-base pair cDNA clone. As shown in Fig. 1A, the Vav protein fragment associated selectively with the SH3-C domain of Grb2.Endogenous Vav, Sos, and C3G Differentially Associate with the SH3 Domains of Grb2To examine whether endogenous Vav protein from B cells associates with Grb2 and to map the Grb2 domain responsible for the interaction, GST fusion proteins were used to isolate Vav from B cell lysates. Full-length Grb2, as well as its amino-terminal SH3, carboxyl-terminal SH3, and SH2 domains were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli. Purified tonsillar B cells were either incubated with medium alone as control or with anti-human Ig serum to activate the BCR complex. Lysates were prepared and incubated with the Grb2-GST fusion proteins. After incubation, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with anti-Vav mAb. An anti-Vav immunoprecipitate was analyzed in parallel, in order to identify the Vav molecule. Fig. 2A shows that the anti-Vav mAb primarily reacts with a molecule of 95 kDa. In addition, a minor product of 70 kDa is detected. Both Vav species associate with equal efficiency with full-length Grb2. Vav is known to be inducibly phosphorylated on tyrosine upon BCR stimulation, but triggering of the BCR and ensuing Vav phosphorylation (results not shown) did not affect the potential of endogenous Vav to associate with Grb2 (Fig. 2A). As in the yeast two-hybrid system, B cell-derived Vav selectively interacted with the SH3-C domain of Grb2 and not with the SH3-N or SH2 domains.Figure 2Vav, Sos, and C3G from resting and activated B cells selectively interact with SH3 domains of bacterial GST-Grb2 fusion proteins. A, primary B cells were isolated by immunodepletion of T cells from tonsil cell suspensions. Cells were incubated in medium(-) or with anti-human Ig polyclonal antibody to trigger the BCR (+). Nonidet P-40 lysates were prepared, precleared with bacterial GST protein and incubated with GST fusion proteins of full-length Grb2, its SH2 domain, its carboxyl-terminal (SH3-C) or amino-terminal (SH3-N) SH3 domains. Part of the lysates was used for immunoprecipitation with anti-Vav mAb. Isolated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE transferred to nitrocellulose sheets, incubated with anti-Vav mAb, and second step antibody-conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence. The arrow indicates the 95-kDa Vav protein. The asterisks indicate the positions of the fusion proteins.

In contrast to Vav, Sos derived from human tonsillar B cells, did not discriminate between the SH3-N and SH3-C domains of Grb2. It bound to both SH3 domains, and not to the SH2 domain (Fig. 2B), as expected(41.Reif K. Buday L. Downward J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14081-14087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The C3G protein is known to bind to Grb2 in vitro(30.Tanaka S. Moreshita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M.

Its expression and function in lymphocytes has thus far not been examined. Fig. 2C shows that the 145-kDa C3G molecule can effectively be isolated from Ramos B cells with specific antibody. Endogenous C3G from both resting and activated B cells bound with equal efficiency to GST-Grb2 fusion proteins (Fig. 2C). Upon stimulation of the BCR, no tyrosine phosphorylation of the C3G molecule could be detected (data not shown). Interestingly, C3G showed yet another Grb2 binding specificity than Vav and Sos. It preferentially interacted with the amino-terminal SH3 domain and to a lesser extent with the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain. It did not bind at all to the Grb2 SH2 domain (Fig. 2C). We conclude that in vitro, Vav, Sos, and C3G proteins from human B cells all have the ability to bind to Grb2, which is not significantly affected by BCR stimulation. The three proteins selectively interact with the two SH3 domains of Grb2. While Sos binds with similar efficiency to both domains, Vav preferentially associates with SH3-C and C3G with SH3-N.Sos, but Not Vav or C3G, Participates in BCR-induced Shc-Grb2 ComplexesWe have reported previously that activation of the BCR leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and the formation of a Shc-Grb2 complex(14.Smit L. de Vries-Smits A.M.M.

The earliest obligate intracellular event following TCR aggregation is the activation of the src-family protein tyrosine kinases, Lck (p56) and Fyn (p59). Lck and/or Fyn phosphorylate TCR subunits resulting in the association of a third tyrosine kinase, ZAP-70 (70-kDa -associated protein), with the TCR and to subsequent activation events(3.Weiss A. Cell. 1993; 73: 209-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 4.Weissman A.M. Chem. Immunol. 1994; 59: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 5.Peri K.G. Veillette A. Chem. Immunol. 1994; 59: 19-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). CD45, a tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates key regulatory residues on Lck and Fyn, is also implicated in the initiation of TCR-mediated signaling(6.Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar).TCRs consist of six different polypeptides, these include the antigen-recognition element, in most cells an α-β heterodimer, and a set of invariant signal transducing subunits. The invariant subunits include CD3-, -, and - and the structurally distinct TCR- subunit, which exists within the TCR as a disulfide-linked homodimer (4.Weissman A.M. Chem. Immunol. 1994; 59: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The minimal signal transducing element of the TCR is the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)(7.Cambier J.C. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). monomers have three ITAMs, and each CD3 subunit has one. ITAMs include two tyrosine residues 10 or 11 amino acids apart that are potential phosphorylation sites. The subunit is a particularly prominent substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation; up to 5% of subunits are phosphorylated on multiple tyrosines upon TCR engagement(8.Baniyash M. Garcia-Morales P.

The covalent modification of proteins with chains of ubiquitin, a highly conserved 76-amino acid polypeptide, plays a central role in the targeting of abnormal proteins and a number of regulatory cytosolic and nuclear proteins for degradation in the 26 S proteasome(12.Finley D. Chau V. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 25-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 13.Rechsteiner M.

Ubiquitination occurs via a multienzyme process involving families of enzymes termed E1-E3. E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme) is involved in the ATP-dependent charging of ubiquitin. The high energy thiol-ester bond between E1 and ubiquitin is transferred to an E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme). E2s either by themselves or in conjunction with E3s (ubiquitin protein ligases), transfer ubiquitin monomers or multiubiquitin chains to target proteins, where isopeptide linkages are formed with lysine residues.The signals that lead to ubiquitination of most naturally occurring substrates are unknown. The N-end rule established a relationship between the N-terminal amino acid of certain proteins and susceptibility to ubiquitination(14.Varshavsky A. Cell. 1992; 69: 725-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). For the cyclins and c-Jun, specific internal polypeptide sequences have been implicated in targeting for ubiquitination(17.Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W.

Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), and for cyclins as well as IκBα, serine phosphorylation also plays a role in this process (19.Deshaies R.J. Chau V.

Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar).The TCR is distinguished from most ubiquitination substrates by its long half-life and by being ubiquitinated in response to a specific external stimulus. TCR ubiquitination occurs on multiple subunits and on multiple intracellular lysines, with mono- and multiubiquitinated species detectable(23.Hou D. Cenciarelli C. Jensen J.P. Nguyen H.B. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14244-14247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As with tyrosine phosphorylation, the subunit is the most prominent substrate for this modification, likely due to the nine intracellular lysines in each monomer, compared with two or three for each of the other invariant subunits. Fundamental to understanding TCR ubiquitination is a determination of the events that couple receptor engagement to this modification. Using Jurkat (24.Weiss A. Stobo J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1284-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), a well characterized human T leukemia cell line, we address the relationship between receptor occupancy and ubiquitination.

This combination was used because human dissociates from other TCR components in Triton X-100(34.Weissman A.M. Samelson L.E. Klausner R.D.

Immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine revealed the anti-CD3-dependent increase in the 21-kDa form of phosphorylated (Fig. 1A, lower panel, compare first two lanes). When evaluated by immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin, a number of anti-CD3-dependent ubiquitinated TCR species were detected (Fig. 1A, upper panel). The most prominent of these represent di-, tri-, and tetra-ubiquitinated forms of , which migrate at 32, 40, and 48 kDa, respectively. The 48-kDa species is superimposed on immunoglobulin heavy chain, which is present regardless of stimulation. Mono-ubiquitinated is seen as a discrete 24-kDa band; this species is often not well visualized, due to poor recognition by polyclonal anti-ubiquitin. In addition to , other TCR components are also ubiquitinated in response to receptor ligation (11.Cenciarelli C. Hou D. Hsu K.-C. Rellahan B.L. Wiest D.L. Smith H.T. Fried V.A. Weissman A.M. Science. 1992; 257: 795-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and contribute to the overall increase in density above 40 kDa. To determine whether tyrosine kinase activation is required for ubiquitination, Jurkat cells were treated with herbimycin A. This tyrosine kinase inhibitor enhances the degradation of src family tyrosine kinases such as Lck and Fyn(36.Graber M. June C.H. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Int. Immunol. 1992; 4: 1201-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Herbimycin A at 3 μM did not affect viability or receptor levels (not shown) but resulted in a marked diminution in antibody-induced phosphorylation (Fig. 1A, lower panel). When receptor ubiquitination was evaluated, it was similarly inhibited by this agent (Fig. 1A, upper panel). Incubation of cells with 0.3 μM herbimycin A, which did not block phosphorylation, had no effect on TCR ubiquitination.The herbimycin A results suggest a relationship between TCR ubiquitination and TCR-mediated tyrosine kinase activation. To further assess this relationship, the effects of pervanadate on TCR ubiquitination were evaluated. Pervanadate increases global cellular tyrosine phosphorylation by inhibiting protein tyrosine phosphatases and has been shown to mimic TCR-mediated signaling(37.O'Shea J.J. McVicar D.W. Bailey T.L.

J. 1994; 297: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). When Jurkat cells were pretreated with pervanadate, a dramatic increase in total cellular tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in whole cell lysates, regardless of TCR engagement with anti-CD3 (Fig. 1B). When TCRs were specifically immunoprecipitated from pervanadate-treated cells, the subunit of the TCR was also found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 1C, lower panel). The level of 21-kDa phospho- seen with pervanadate alone was substantially greater than that achieved with anti-CD3 (OKT3) cross-linking, and together pervanadate and anti-CD3 were synergistic with regard to phosphorylation. When evaluated for ubiquitination (Fig. 1C, upper panel), pervanadate by itself resulted in the appearance of ubiquitinated TCRs, although the level of ubiquitination achieved with pervanadate was consistently less than that seen with anti-CD3 (Fig. 1C, upper panel, and data not shown). As with tyrosine phosphorylation, anti-CD3 and pervanadate together had synergistic effects on ubiquitination. In multiple experiments, concomitant treatment with pervanadate and anti-CD3 resulted in increases in ubiquitination from 2- to 8-fold relative to anti-CD3 alone. In conjunction with the herbimycin A results, these findings suggest that tyrosine kinase activation plays a crucial role in TCR ubiquitination and that receptor engagement facilitates the generation of TCR-ubiquitin conjugates.The Tyrosine Kinase Lck Is Required for TCR UbiquitinationTo address whether tyrosine kinases specifically involved in TCR-mediated signaling are required for ubiquitination, we next evaluated the Jurkat variant JCaM1.6. This cell line is defective in TCR-mediated signaling due to loss of enzymatically active Lck(26.Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). JCaM1.6 was subcloned (JCaM1.6.22) to achieve surface TCR levels matching wild type Jurkat and evaluated for both TCR phosphorylation and ubiquitination (Fig. 2A). When compared with Jurkat, antibody-induced phosphorylation was dramatically reduced (Fig. 2A, lower panel), as was receptor ubiquitination (Fig. 2A, upper panel). To establish if loss of Lck is responsible for the lack of ubiquitination in JCaM1.6.22, Lck expression was restored by transfection of JCaM1.6.22 with an Lck-encoding expression vector. The restoration of Lck expression in two independent stable transfectants, JLck.B3 and JLck.H5, was documented by immunoblotting with anti-Lck (Fig. 2B). Re-expression of Lck resulted in reconstitution of phosphorylation (Fig. 2C, lower panel). Additionally, re-expression of Lck reconstituted anti-CD3-dependent TCR ubiquitination (Fig. 2C, upper panel), thus establishing a requirement for Lck in this process.Figure 2Dependence of ubiquitination on Lck. A, equal numbers of Jurkat and receptor-matched Lck-deficient JCaM 1.6.22 cells were incubated in the presence or the absence of anti-CD3 at 37°C, as indicated in the figure, prior to lysis and immunoprecipitation as described for Fig. 1. Immunoblotting was carried out with either anti-ubiquitin or anti-phosphotyrosine as indicated.

One consequence of TCR-mediated tyrosine kinase activation that directly effects the receptor itself is the activation of protein kinase C. Activation of this serine/threonine kinase stimulates the phosphorylation of CD3 subunits on serine residues and results in enhanced receptor endocytosis(41.Cantrell D.A. Davies A.A. Crumpton M.J.

Treatment of T cells with the protein kinase C-activating phorbol ester, PMA, bypasses TCR-mediated tyrosine kinase activation and stimulates protein kinase C. This results in the serine phosphorylation of CD3 subunits and an intracellular redistribution of receptors, even in the absence of TCR occupancy(41.Cantrell D.A. Davies A.A. Crumpton M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8158-8162Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 42.Minami Y. Samelson L.E. Klausner R.D. J. Biol.

Med. 1987; 165: 1141-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).As shown (Fig. 3A), although anti-CD3-dependent receptor endocytosis is less pronounced in Lck-deficient JCaM1.6.22 when compared with Jurkat (Fig. 3A, compare a and b with e and f), treatment with PMA bypasses TCR-mediated signaling and results in an intracellular redistribution of receptors comparable with that seen with Jurkat (Fig. 3A, c and g; d and h). Having established that PMA results in receptor redistribution in JCaM1.6.22, the effects of combinations of PMA and anti-CD3 on TCR ubiquitination were evaluated in this cell line. Neither PMA plus anti-CD3 nor PMA alone (Fig. 3B) resulted in any detectable receptor ubiquitination in JCaM1.6. Thus, serine phosphorylation of TCR subunits and receptor redistribution is not sufficient to result in ubiquitination of TCRs. Ionomycin (a calcium ionophore) and PMA, which together activate Jurkat cells in a TCR-independent fashion(45.Weiss A. Imboden J. Shoback D. Stobo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4169-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), also failed to restore ubiquitination in JCaM1.6.22, even when receptors were concomitantly cross-linked with anti-CD3 (not shown). Consistent with the requirement for tyrosine kinase activation for ubiquitination, treatment of wild type Jurkat with PMA and/or ionomycin in the absence of TCR engagement resulted in neither TCR ubiquitination nor tyrosine phosphorylation (not shown).Figure 3Protein kinase C activation fails to stimulate ubiquitination.

Samples were incubated with anti-CD3 (solid lines) or a nonbinding murine antibody (A2B4-2) (dotted lines, in upper two panels only), followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse F(ab′) (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) and analysis by FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA).

This TCR-associated transmembrane phosphatase is believed to function in the initiation of signaling by dephosphorylating key regulatory residues on Lck and Fyn (6.Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). CD45-deficient cells are defective in signaling and do not exhibit the normal increase in TCR phosphorylation seen in response to receptor occupancy(27.Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Thomas M.L. Weiss A. Nature. 1990; 346: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 46.Pingel J.T. Thomas M.L. Cell. 1989; 58: 1055-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 47.Volarevic S.

In such a Jurkat variant (J45.01), no ligand-induced TCR ubiquitination was detected (Fig. 4A), despite comparable levels of surface TCR (not shown) and total cellular (Fig. 4B, lower panel). As with the Lck negative cells, PMA and ionomycin did not result in ubiquitination (not shown). As expected, when these cells were reconstituted with CD45 (J45.LB3.3)(28.Koretzky G. Kohmetscher M.A. Kadleck T. Weiss A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1138-1142PubMed Google Scholar), anti-CD3-dependent TCR ubiquitination was easily detected (Fig. 4B, upper panel). This establishes that TCR ubiquitination is not only dependent on tyrosine kinases but also on the presence of a tyrosine phosphatase that regulates kinase activity.Figure 4Dependence of ubiquitination on CD45 expression.

This requirement is not bypassed by stimulating serine phosphorylation and internalization of engaged receptors. Pervanadate, which results in an acute increase in tyrosine phosphorylation, is sufficient to result in detectable levels of TCR ubiquitination, even in the absence of receptor ligation. Thus, an acute increase in tyrosine phosphorylation, independent of receptor occupancy, appears to be sufficient to result in ubiquitination. However, the finding that the level of ubiquitination seen with pervanadate is consistently less than that found with receptor occupancy suggests that specific signals generated in response to TCR engagement may be important in stimulating a maximal level of TCR ubiquitination. These signals may be a direct manifestation of TCR oligomerization or perhaps reflect a different temporal order or pattern of phosphorylation induced when tyrosine kinases are activated by TCR ligation.The platelet-derived growth factor receptor and c-kit (the stem cell factor receptor) are tyrosine kinase-containing members of the growth factor family of receptors that are ubiquitinated in response to their cognate ligands(48.Mori S. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6429-6434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49.Miyazawa K. Toyama K. Gotoh A. Hendrie P.C. Mantel C. Broxmeyer H.E. Blood. 1994; 83: 137-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of platelet-derived growth factor receptor, mutation of autophosphorylation sites correlates with decreased ligand-dependent ubiquitination(50.Mori S. Heldin C.H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 577-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and for c-kit, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genestein results in decreased ligand-dependent ubiquitination(49.Miyazawa K. Toyama K. Gotoh A. Hendrie P.C. Mantel C. Broxmeyer H.E. Blood. 1994; 83: 137-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several other mammalian transmembrane receptors that either signal by coupling to tyrosine kinase activation (51.Paolini R. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) or that contain intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (52.Mori S. Claesson-Welsh L. Okuyama Y. Saito Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) are ubiquitinated in an occupancy-dependent manner. Taken together with our findings, these observations suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation likely plays an important role in ligand-dependent ubiquitination of a number of mammalian transmembrane receptors.One means by which receptor ubiquitination might occur in response to tyrosine kinase activation is by the phosphorylation of E2/E3 enzymes with resultant changes in their associations and/or activities. In fact, in one case, the in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation of an E2 was found to correlate with enhanced ubiquitination(53.Kong S.-K. Chock P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14189-14192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, receptors might be ubiquitinated by E2/E3 enzymes that contain sites that bind phosphotyrosine, such as is seen with SH2 domains, although no enzymes fitting this description have thus far been identified.The function of ubiquitination in the biology of transmembrane receptors remains to be elucidated. It has generally been assumed that transmembrane receptors are degraded in lysosomes. However, to be exposed to lysosomal proteases, intracytosolic receptor domains would first need to be engulfed in autophagocytic vesicles. Alternatively, the intracytosolic domains of receptors could be degraded, at least in part, in a ubiquitin-dependent fashion in the 26 S proteasome. This could be viewed as a protective mechanism, insuring the degradation of the signaling domains of activated receptors. Although results obtained with the platelet-derived growth factor receptor are suggestive(50.Mori S. Heldin C.H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 577-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), for no transmembrane receptor has a causal relationship between ligand-induced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation been established. The recent finding of herbimycin A-induced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the insulin-like growth factor receptor, while not addressing the issue of ligand-dependent ubiquitination, demonstrates that transmembrane receptors may, in fact, be degraded by proteasomes (54.Sepp-Lorenzino L. Ma Z. Lebwohl D.E. Vinitsky A. Rosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16580-16587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).Regardless of the fate of ubiquitinated receptors, the steric effects of ubiquitin moieties branching off of the intracytoplasmic tails of receptors would be expected to impact negatively on intracellular associations with signaling molecules and between receptors. For the TCR, Fyn, ZAP-70, and CD45 are among the TCR-associated proteins that could be affected by ubiquitination. Thus, whether or not ubiquitination is a major factor in ligand-dependent receptor degradation, it is likely that this modification represents a means of modulating the function of activated transmembrane receptors. INTRODUCTIONFor many transmembrane receptors, including the multisubunit TCR, 1The abbreviations used are: TCRT cell antigen receptorPMAphorbol myristate acetatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.signaling is initiated by ligand-induced aggregation(1.Metzger H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1477-1487PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Abastado J.-P. Lone Y.-C. Casrouge A. Boulet G. Kourilsky P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The earliest obligate intracellular event following TCR aggregation is the activation of the src-family protein tyrosine kinases, Lck (p56) and Fyn (p59). Lck and/or Fyn phosphorylate TCR subunits resulting in the association of a third tyrosine kinase, ZAP-70 (70-kDa -associated protein), with the TCR and to subsequent activation events(3.Weiss A. Cell. 1993; 73: 209-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 4.Weissman A.M. Chem. Immunol. 1994; 59: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 5.Peri K.G. Veillette A. Chem. Immunol. 1994; 59: 19-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). CD45, a tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates key regulatory residues on Lck and Fyn, is also implicated in the initiation of TCR-mediated signaling(6.Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar).TCRs consist of six different polypeptides, these include the antigen-recognition element, in most cells an α-β heterodimer, and a set of invariant signal transducing subunits. The invariant subunits include CD3-, -, and - and the structurally distinct TCR- subunit, which exists within the TCR as a disulfide-linked homodimer (4.Weissman A.M. Chem. Immunol. 1994; 59: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The minimal signal transducing element of the TCR is the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)(7.Cambier J.C. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). monomers have three ITAMs, and each CD3 subunit has one. ITAMs include two tyrosine residues 10 or 11 amino acids apart that are potential phosphorylation sites. The subunit is a particularly prominent substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation; up to 5% of subunits are phosphorylated on multiple tyrosines upon TCR engagement(8.Baniyash M. Garcia-Morales P.

The covalent modification of proteins with chains of ubiquitin, a highly conserved 76-amino acid polypeptide, plays a central role in the targeting of abnormal proteins and a number of regulatory cytosolic and nuclear proteins for degradation in the 26 S proteasome(12.Finley D. Chau V. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 25-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 13.Rechsteiner M.

Ubiquitination occurs via a multienzyme process involving families of enzymes termed E1-E3. E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme) is involved in the ATP-dependent charging of ubiquitin. The high energy thiol-ester bond between E1 and ubiquitin is transferred to an E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme). E2s either by themselves or in conjunction with E3s (ubiquitin protein ligases), transfer ubiquitin monomers or multiubiquitin chains to target proteins, where isopeptide linkages are formed with lysine residues.The signals that lead to ubiquitination of most naturally occurring substrates are unknown. The N-end rule established a relationship between the N-terminal amino acid of certain proteins and susceptibility to ubiquitination(14.Varshavsky A. Cell. 1992; 69: 725-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). For the cyclins and c-Jun, specific internal polypeptide sequences have been implicated in targeting for ubiquitination(17.Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar, 18.Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), and for cyclins as well as IκBα, serine phosphorylation also plays a role in this process (19.Deshaies R.J. Chau V. Kirschner M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 20.Lahav-Baratz S. Sudakin V. Ruderman J. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar).The TCR is distinguished from most ubiquitination substrates by its long half-life and by being ubiquitinated in response to a specific external stimulus. TCR ubiquitination occurs on multiple subunits and on multiple intracellular lysines, with mono- and multiubiquitinated species detectable(23.Hou D. Cenciarelli C. Jensen J.P. Nguyen H.B. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14244-14247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As with tyrosine phosphorylation, the subunit is the most prominent substrate for this modification, likely due to the nine intracellular lysines in each monomer, compared with two or three for each of the other invariant subunits. Fundamental to understanding TCR ubiquitination is a determination of the events that couple receptor engagement to this modification. Using Jurkat (24.Weiss A. Stobo J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1284-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), a well characterized human T leukemia cell line, we address the relationship between receptor occupancy and ubiquitination. Our findings establish a relationship between receptor ubiquitination and early signaling events mediated by TCR engagement and the activation of protein tyrosine kinases."

The association of apoB with lipid is thought to be promoted by the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein complex. We have reconstituted lipoprotein assembly in an insect cell line that normally does not support this process. Expression of human microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) and apolipoprotein B48 (apoB48) together enabled Sf-21 insect cells to secrete 60-fold more lipoprotein-associated triacylglycerol than control cells. This dramatic effect demonstrates that effective partitioning of triacylglycerol into the secretory pathway requires an endoplasmic reticulum-associated neutral lipid transporter (provided by MTP) and an apolipoprotein to shuttle the lipid through the pathway. Expression of the human apoB48 gene in insect cells resulted in secretion of the protein product. Including both MTP subunits with apoB48 and oleic acid specifically increased apoB48 secretion 8-fold over individual subunits alone. To assess whether specific regions of apoB are necessary for MTP responsiveness, nine apoB segments were expressed. These included NH-terminal segments as well as internal and COOH-terminal regions of apoB fused with a heterologous signal sequence. ApoB segments containing the NH-terminal 17% of the protein were secreted and responded to MTP activity; however, a segment containing only the NH-terminal 17% of the protein was not significantly responsive to MTP. Segments lacking the NH terminus were not MTP-responsive, and five of six of these proteins were trapped intracellularly but, in certain cases, could be rescued by fusion to apoB17. These results suggest that the NH terminus of apoB is necessary but not sufficient for MTP responsiveness.

The association of apoB with lipid is thought to be promoted by the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein complex. We have reconstituted lipoprotein assembly in an insect cell line that normally does not support this process. Expression of human microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) and apolipoprotein B48 (apoB48) together enabled Sf-21 insect cells to secrete 60-fold more lipoprotein-associated triacylglycerol than control cells. This dramatic effect demonstrates that effective partitioning of triacylglycerol into the secretory pathway requires an endoplasmic reticulum-associated neutral lipid transporter (provided by MTP) and an apolipoprotein to shuttle the lipid through the pathway. Expression of the human apoB48 gene in insect cells resulted in secretion of the protein product. Including both MTP subunits with apoB48 and oleic acid specifically increased apoB48 secretion 8-fold over individual subunits alone. To assess whether specific regions of apoB are necessary for MTP responsiveness, nine apoB segments were expressed. These included NH-terminal segments as well as internal and COOH-terminal regions of apoB fused with a heterologous signal sequence. ApoB segments containing the NH-terminal 17% of the protein were secreted and responded to MTP activity; however, a segment containing only the NH-terminal 17% of the protein was not significantly responsive to MTP. Segments lacking the NH terminus were not MTP-responsive, and five of six of these proteins were trapped intracellularly but, in certain cases, could be rescued by fusion to apoB17. These results suggest that the NH terminus of apoB is necessary but not sufficient for MTP responsiveness. INTRODUCTIONThe transport of water-insoluble lipids through the circulation of all mammals is mediated by lipoprotein particles. Apolipoprotein B (apoB) 1The abbreviations used are: apoapolipoproteinMTPmicrosomal triglyceride transfer proteinERendoplasmic reticulumPDIprotein disulfide isomerasekbkilobase(s)BSAbovine serum albuminPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.is an unusually large secretory protein (514 kDa) that is required for the assembly and secretion of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins from the liver and the intestine(1.Young S.G. Circulation. 1990; 82: 1574-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). ApoB production rates are highly variable in human populations. Clinically important lipoprotein disorders such as familial combined hyperlipidemia are often associated with apoB overproduction(2.Venkatesan S. Cullen P. Pacy P. Halliday D. Scott J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1110-1118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) plays an essential role in the assembly of apoB-containing lipoproteins. MTP is a protein complex found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen of liver and intestinal cells(3.Wetterau J.R. Zilversmit D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 875: 610-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This complex primarily transfers neutral lipids between membranes in vitro(4.Wetterau J.R. Zilversmit D.B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1985; 38: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). MTP has two subunits: protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and a 97-kDa subunit that possesses lipid transfer activity in vitro when coupled with PDI(5.Wetterau J.R. Combs K.A. McLean L.R. Spinner S.N. Aggerbeck L.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9728-9735Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Mutations in the 97-kDa subunit of MTP have been found in patients with abetalipoproteinemia(6.Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Bouma M.E. Eisenberg C. Munck A. Hermier M. Schmitz J. Gay G. Rader D.J.

Leoni P.R. Bhattacharya S. Pease R.J. Cullen P.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 2109-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This condition leads to only trace amounts of apoB-containing lipoproteins in the plasma and a substantial decrease in plasma neutral lipid content.Recent studies have shown that introduction of the 97-kDa subunit of MTP into cells that are nonhepatic and nonenteric in origin, enables these cells to secrete segments of apoB(9.Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Sharp D. Mullaney D. Yao Z. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7628-7632Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 10.Leiper J.M. Bayliss J.D. Pease R.J. Brett D.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21951-21954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoB secretion in these cases is increased when the cells are supplemented with oleic acid, a substrate for neutral lipid biosynthesis. The tissue-specific production of apoB-containing lipoproteins correlates with the tissue distribution of the 97-kDa subunit of MTP. These studies, coupled with our understanding of abetalipoproteinemia, reinforce the hypothesis that MTP promotes lipoprotein assembly and secretion by facilitating the coupling of apoB with lipid. The secretion of apoB and lipid appear to be interdependent in that apoB requires adequate neutral lipid for secretion and neutral lipid secretion requires apoB.Studies of invertebrates (primarily insects) indicate that they have evolved an alternative mechanism for the release of neutral lipids from cells(11.Ryan R.O. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1725-1740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While adult insects have large triacylglycerol stores in their lipoprotein-producing fat body tissue, insects cannot target triacylglycerol into the secretory pathway. Insects fail to assemble lipoproteins intracellularly and instead secrete the protein component of their lipoprotein in a lipid poor form(12.Prasad S.V. Fernando-Warnakulasuriya G.J.P. Sumida M. Law J.H. Wells M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 266: 17174-17176Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Mobilization of stored triacylglycerol occurs only after it is hydrolyzed to diacylglycerol. The diacylglycerol is released from the cell to the extracellular fluid, the hemolymph, where lipoprotein assembly takes place(13.Tsuchida K. Wells M.A. Insect Biochem. 1988; 18: 263-268Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This assembly process requires an extracellular lipid transfer particle (14.Van Heusden M. Law J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17287-17292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which, like MTP, has been shown to possess a lipid transfer activity in vitro(15.Ando S. Ryan R.O. Yokoyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1043: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).No molecular explanation exists for the contrasting mechanisms of triacylglycerol mobilization that have evolved within the animal kingdom. We hypothesized that the ability of vertebrates to partition triacylglycerol into the secretory pathway is dependent upon ER retention of their neutral lipid transfer activity. If this hypothesis is correct, then providing invertebrate cells with an intracellular neutral lipid transfer activity should enable them to directly secrete triacylglycerol from their intracellular stores.Sf-21 cells (from the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda) are invertebrate cells that do not produce lipoprotein particles. We have utilized these cells to assess the requirements for the secretion of triacylglycerol and apoB. Although they accumulate high levels of intracellular triacylglycerol, Sf-21 cells release little triacylglycerol into the media. Here we show that expression of human MTP and the intestinal form of human apoB (apoB48) in Sf-21 cells is sufficient to confer upon them the ability to efficiently partition triacylglycerol into the secretory pathway.The role of specific apoB sequences in the responsiveness to MTP has not been elucidated. COOH-terminal apoB truncations result in a decreased capacity to bind lipid, but do not eliminate apoB's ability to form lipoproteins(16.Spring D.J. Chen L.L. Chatterton J.E. Elovson J. Schumaker V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14839-14845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. Linton M.F. Taylor S.M. Young S.G. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3300-3308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Graham D.L. Knott T.J. Jones T.C. Pease R.J. Pullinger C.R. Scott J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5616-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the potential role of the NH terminus of apoB in mediating MTP responsiveness is undefined. A segment of the NH terminus of apoB is thought to undergo pausing during translocation across the ER membrane (19.Chuck S.L. Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. McCarthy B.J. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 20.Chuck S.L. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 9-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21.Du E.Z. Kurth J. Wang S.L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, this region might be essential in the initial combination of protein with triacylglycerol that occurs during lipoprotein assembly. We therefore investigated the possibility that the NH-terminal region is essential for apoB's responsiveness to MTP. We report that the NH terminus of apoB is required for MTP responsiveness. However, by itself the NH terminus is not MTP-responsive, indicating that it is necessary but not sufficient for MTP responsiveness. The current work further demonstrates that the targeting of triacylglycerol into the secretory pathway is dependent upon expression of an ER-associated neutral lipid transporter. The work also suggests that the evolutionary differences in animal lipid secretion are related to the secretion or retention of the organism's neutral lipid transfer activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProduction of Recombinant BaculovirusesThe production of recombinant baculoviruses encoding human apoB17, human protein disulfide isomerase, and the 97-kDa subunit of human MTP are described elsewhere(22.Choi S.Y. Sivaram P. Walker D.E. Curtiss L.K. Gretch D.G. Sturley S.L. Attie A.D. Deckelbaum R.J. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8081-8086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23.Ricci B. Sharp D. O'Rourke E. Kienzle B. Blinderman L. Gordon D. Smith-Monroy C. Robinson G. Gregg R.E. Rader D.J. Wetterau J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14281-14285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).Generation of additional recombinant baculoviruses encoding regions of apoB represented in Fig. 11, was carried out as follows. Initially, a plasmid was constructed to contain an entire apoB100 minigene. Two oligonucleotides, 5′-GAT CCG CGG CCG CAT AGG CCA CTA GTG-3′ and 5′-AAT TCA CTA GTG GCC TAT GCG GCC GCG-3′, were synthesized and annealed to generate the “Bam-Eco” polylinker containing (from the 5′ end) BamHI, SacII, NotI, Sfi I, SpeI, and EcoRI sites. The polylinker was phosphorylated with polynucleotide kinase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) prior to use. The Bam-Eco linker was ligated with a 2.5-kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment of apoB cDNA from pB18 (24.Blackhart B.D. Yao Z. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8358-8360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pCMV5 that had been digested with BglII. This resulted in pB18LII. pB18LII was digested with BstEII (+1359 of the apoB cDNA) and KpnI (in the linker region of pCMV5). This product was ligated to a BstEII-KpnI fragment from pB100 (24.Blackhart B.D. Yao Z. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8358-8360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that was generated by a complete digestion with KpnI and a partial digestion (at +1359 of apoB cDNA) with BstEII. The resulting plasmid is pB100LII.An 18-kb NotI-SmaI DNA fragment encoding the human apoB100 minigene was excised from pB100LII and inserted into a NotI-SmaI-digested baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 (Invitrogen) to yield pAcB100.pB48LII was generated by engineering a translational stop signal at codon 2153 (as described(25.Hussain M.M. Zhao Y. Kancha R.K. Blackhart B.D. Yao Z. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1995; 15: 485-494Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar)) of apoB53 in pB53L-L. A 7.2-kb NotI-SmaI fragment encoding human apoB48 was removed from pB48LII and inserted into NotI-SmaI digested pVL1392 to form pAcB48.The baculovirus transfer vector pVTBac (26.Tessier D.C. Thomas D.Y. Khouri H.E. Laliberté F. Vernet T. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 98: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) (a gift from T. Vernet) containing the honeybee melittin signal peptide was used for the production of internal and COOH-terminal apoB constructs. Following cloning, all junctions were in frame with the honeybee melittin signal sequence as confirmed by sequencing at the Columbia University Cancer Center (CUCC) Sequencing Facility. Initially, an XbaI oligonucleotide linker with translational stop sequences in all three reading frames (CTAGTCTAGACTAG) was inserted into the SmaI site of pVTBac, yielding pVTBac∗. A 6.5-kb BamHI fragment spanning sequences from apoB33 to apoB80 was removed from pB100LII and inserted into the BamHI site of pVTBac∗ yielding pAcB33-80. A 1.8-kb BamHI-BclI fragment encoding apoB33-46 was inserted into the BamHI site of pVTBac∗ to produce pAcB33-46. A 4.4-kb BclI-BamHI fragment encoding apoB48-80 was inserted into the BamHI site of pVTBac∗ to produce pAcB48-80.To produce apoB69-79, pVTBac was first modified by cutting with KpnI and filling in with the large fragment of DNA polymerase (Klenow) to generate blunt ends. A 63-bp synthetic DNA fragment (CGA ATC GAA GGT CGT AAA GAA ACC GCT GCT GCT AAA TTC GAA CGC CAG CAC ATG AAC AGC TAA) encoding the S peptide of RNase A (as in (27.Kim J.S. Raines R.T. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar)), a factor Xa cleavage site, and a translational stop codon were ligated to the blunt-ended pVTBac to generate pVTBac-S. pVTBac-S was digested with PstI and filled in with the Klenow to generate blunt ends. pAcB33-80 was digested with AccI and MscI to generate a 1.4-kb fragment encoding apoB69-79. This fragment was treated with Klenow to generate blunt ends and was subsequently ligated to the linearized blunt-ended pVTBac-S to generate pAcB69-79-S. This construct thus encoded apoB69-79 fused in frame with the S peptide sequence as confirmed by sequencing at the CUCC Sequencing Facility.To generate apoB78-100, pB100LII was digested with BsiHKAI and was treated with T4 DNA polymerase to remove 3′-protruding sequences. Following digestion with MunI, a 4.5-kb fragment encoding apoB78-100 was isolated. pVTBac was digested with EcoRI and SmaI, and the 4.5-kb apoB fragment was inserted to generate pAcB78-100.To produce apoB88-100, two oligonucleotides were used to amplify the apoB exon 29 coding sequence from human genomic DNA via the polymerase chain reaction. The 5′ primer contained 42 bases (5′-cgg gat cca cAG TCC TCT CCA GAT AAA AAA CTC ACC ATA TTC-3′), with the uppercase letters representing apoB sequence. The non-apoB sequence contains a BamHI site for cloning purposes, and the apoB sequence begins with the final two amino acids of exon 28. The 3′ primer contained 27 bases (5′-tcc ccg GGC TGG CTC ACT GTA TGG TTT-3′), with the uppercase letters representing 3′ apoB untranslated sequence. The lowercase (non-apoB) sequence contains a XmaI site for cloning purposes. Following amplification, the resulting 1.7-kb fragment was digested with BamHI and XmaI and inserted into pBluescript II SK+/- (Stratagene), which had also been digested with BamHI and XmaI. Following nucleotide sequencing, the same fragment was excised and inserted into pVTBac, which was previously digested with BamHI and XmaI. The construct was in frame with the honeybee melittin signal peptide.The apoB17 fusion proteins were generated using pAcB17. Initially, pAcB17 was partially digested with BamHI, and the upstream BamHI site was destroyed by filling it in with Klenow to generate blunt ends. This yielded pAcB17-Bam. A 1.8-kb BamHI-BclI fragment (from pB100LII) encoding apoB33-46 was inserted into the remaining BamHI site of pAcB17-Bam. The BamHI junction was then opened, filled in using Klenow, and religated. This placed the apoB33-46 sequence in frame with the apoB17 sequence and formed pAcB17-(33-46). A 4.4-kb BclI-BamHI fragment encoding apoB48-80 was removed from pB100 LII and was filled in to generate blunt ends using Klenow. This fragment was inserted into the BamHI site of pAcB17-Bam after this site had also been filled in. This placed the apoB48-80 sequence in frame with the apoB17 sequence and resulted in pAcB17-(B48-80).To generate the apoB17-(69-79) fusion, pAcB17-Bam was digested with BamHI and SnaBI. A 1.5-kb BamHI-SnaBI fragment encoding apoB69-79 was removed from pAcB69-79-S and was inserted into pAcB17-Bam. This construct was linearized with BamHI and was filled in with the Klenow fragment to place apoB69-79 in frame with apoB17. The resulting product was pAcB17-(69-79-S). All fusion junctions were confirmed by sequencing at the CUCC Sequencing Facility.The resulting transfer vectors encoding regions of apoB were then used to produce recombinant baculoviruses using linearized viral DNA (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Recombinant viruses were identified, plaque-purified, amplified, and titered as described(28.Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; 1555Google Scholar, 29.Miller D.W. Safer P.

Cells were plated in 60-mm diameter tissue culture dishes at a density of 4 × 106 cells/dish. Cells were infected for 1 h with wild-type baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 5. Following infection, cells were washed and fed SF 900 serum-free media (2 ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.). Twenty-seven hours postinfection, the above media were replaced with 2 ml of SF 900 media containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) or 0.5% BSA complexed with 1 mM oleic acid. In experiments where an oleic acid tracer was used, [3H] oleic acid was included at 6.25 μCi/ml. Seventeen hours later, cells were washed and scraped into 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 6.2 (150 mM NaCl, 2.8 mM KCl, 1.5 mM KHPO, 6.5 mM NaHPO, pH 6.2). Protein measurements were determined by a modified Lowry assay (30.Markwell M.K. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5288) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Lipids were extracted (31.Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subjected to TLC using a hexane:ether:acetic acid (80:20:2, v/v/v) solvent system. Mass measurements of various lipids were determined by charring with concentrated sulfuric acid (32.Marsh J.B. Weinstein D.B. J. Lipid Res. 1966; 7: 574-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and compared with standard curves generated using triolein, diolein, cholesteryl oleate, and phosphatidylcholine. For measurements involving [3H]oleic acid tracer, TLC was performed as above, and resolved lipids were identified using a Berthold automatic TLC-linear analyzer and a Berthold CHROMA software package (version 6.23). Lipid species were scraped from the plate, and quantitation was performed via scintillation counting.The BSA-oleate complexes were made as a 10 × stock in PBS, pH 6.2, as follows. 10% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma) was dissolved in 10 ml of PBS, pH 6.2. Sixty-one mg of sodium oleate was dissolved in two ml of absolute ethanol plus 40 μl of 4 N NaOH with gentle heating. The ethanol was evaporated with heating under a stream of nitrogen. In cases where an oleic acid tracer was used, 1.25 mCi of [3H]oleic acid was added and then dried under nitrogen. The dried oleate was redissolved in 10 ml of PBS, pH 6.2, with heating. The oleate/PBS solution was equilibrated to room temperature while mixing with a stir bar. The BSA solution was then added, and mixing continued for 10 min. This 10 × solution was filter-sterilized and stored at −20°C.Analysis of Secreted Lipids from Oleic Acid-treated CellsTo assess the effect of MTP and apoB48 on lipid secretion from Sf-21 cells, the release of oleic acid-containing lipids was assessed using uninfected cells and cells infected with wild-type (control), apoB48 and MTP (23.Ricci B.

In experiments where multiple viruses were used to infect cells, the following virus ratios were used: wild type:PDI, 3:2; wild type:PDI:97-kDa subunit, 3:1:1; apoB48:PDI, 3:2; apoB48:PDI:97-kDa subunit, 3:1:1. Media changes and harvesting were done as described above. After harvest, the media were centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min. Media lipids were extracted and quantitated as described above. Expression of the individual proteins being tested was monitored via immunoblotting of cell lysates (for MTP) and media (for apoB48) (not shown).Analysis of Lipoprotein-associated LipidsIn order to assess the lipid content of apoB48-containing lipoproteins, media samples (1.75 ml) were adjusted to a density of 1.24 g/ml with sodium bromide and were underlayered beneath 10.25 ml of a NaBr solution with a density of 1.20 g/ml. Following ultracentrifugation in an SW-41 rotor at 175,000 × g for 27 h, the top 1 ml was removed. The lipids were extracted and analyzed as described above. To analyze phospholipids, samples were chromatographed using a chloroform, methanol, 40% methylamine, water (60:36:5:5, v/v/v/v) solvent system with phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine as standards. Quantitation was carried out as described above.Analysis of Apolipoprotein B Segments Produced by Recombinant BaculovirusesSf-21 cells were plated in 60-mm diameter tissue culture dishes at a density of 4 × 106 cells/dish. Cells were infected for 1 h with recombinant viruses (or wild-type control virus) at a multiplicity of infection of 5 viruses/cell in TC 100 media (Life Technologies, Inc.) plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Following infection, cells were washed twice with 2 ml of TC 100 media and were covered with 2 ml of SF 900 serum free media (Life Technologies, Inc.). Forty-two hours postinfection the media was removed, and the cells from each plate were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.05 M Tris, pH 9.0, 6 M urea, 0.1% EDTA, 2 mM benzamidine, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein concentrations were determined (30.Markwell M.K. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5288) Google Scholar) using BSA as a standard. Twenty-five μg of total cell protein was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (33.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205955) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting (34.Burnette W.N. Anal.

All expected immunoreactive products were detected (data not shown). The apoB100 construct produced two discrete protein products, one the size of apoB100 and the other the size of apoB48. The mechanism by which this heterogeneity occurs is unknown, although mRNA editing (38.Chen S.H. Habib G. Yang C.Y. Gu Z.W. Lee B.R. Weng S.A. Silberman S.R. Cai S.J. Deslypere J.P. Rosseneu M.

Specific proteolysis of apoB prior to secretion is another possible mechanism of formation of the shortened product.Stimulation of ApoB48 Secretion by Oleic AcidCells were plated out and infected with wild-type control virus or virus encoding apoB48 with an multiplicity of infection of 5 as described above. Twenty-seven hours postinfection, the 2 ml of SF 900 media were replaced with 2 ml of SF 900 media containing 0.5% BSA or 0.5% BSA complexed with 1 mM oleic acid. The media were harvested 16 h later. Following centrifugation for 10 min at 1500 × g the media received phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.2 mM) and benzamidine (2 mM). One ml of medium was precipitated with cabosil(41.Vance D.E. Weinstein D.B. Steinberg D. Biochim. Biophys.

Deep-sea hydrothermal vents are characterized by unusual chemical and physical parameters, including high pressures, high temperature gradients, and high concentrations of toxic elements such as sulfides and heavy metals(1.Tunnicliffe V.

This animal is strictly endemic to this ecosystem and inhabits sulfide-rich environments at depths of about 2600 m. This autotrophic organism is devoid of digestive tube and derives the energy necessary for its growth and metabolism from chemoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing endosymbionts harbored in a special, highly vascularized organ, the trophosome(5.Cavanaugh C.M.

Since the symbionts are isolated from ambient water and inorganic nutrients, Riftia has to supply them with O, HS and CO. Transportation of these inorganic nutrients is facilitated by several different extracellular hemoglobins (Hbs) 1The abbreviations used are: HbhemoglobinHBLhexagonal bilayerbis-tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diolPIPESpiperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)TEMtransmission electron microscopySTEMscanning electron microscopyMALLSmulti-angle laser light scatteringFPLCfast protein liquid chromatography.present in the well developed circulatory system and the large coelomic compartment of Riftia.

The M of FI was unusual when compared to HBL Hbs from annelids (17.Vinogradov S.N. Shlom J.M. Kapp. O.H. Frossard P. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1980; 67B: 1-16Google Scholar) or other vestimentiferans(16.Terwilliger R.C. Terwilliger N.B. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Schabtach E. Biochim. Biophys.

However, this possibility was excluded on the basis of statistical results of their distribution between the two compartments(20.Childress J.J. Fischer C.R. Favuzzi J.A. Kochevar R.E. Sanders N.K.

Indeed, the number and the molecular weight of the different Hbs and their distribution between the different body compartments remain unclear in Riftia and other Vestimentifera. Hence, the aim of the present work was first to identify and purify R. pachyptila Hbs, and then to evaluate their relative molecular masses using the most accurate techniques to date: scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) mass mapping and multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS). With the determination of the complete polypeptide chain composition of these Hbs, reported in a companion study(27.Zal F. Lallier F.H. Green B.N. Vinogradov S.N. Toulmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8875-8881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), these mass estimations will allow us to elaborate proper models of the quaternary structure of these multimeric proteins. Specimens of R. pachyptila were collected during three distinct oceanographic cruises “HERO'91,”“HERO'92,” and “9°50 EPR/SPRING'95” to the hydrothermal vent sites located on the East Pacific Rise at 13°N (12°46′N-103°56′W and 12°50′N-103°57′W) and 9°N (9°48′-9°50′N and 104°17′W) at a depth of about 2600 m. Animals were plucked from the substrate by the manipulators of the American submersible “Alvin” or the French submersible “Nautile” and stored in a thermally insulated basket until they were brought to the surface. The specimens were immediately bled after their recovery on board. Blood from the closed vascular system and coelomic fluid of R. pachyptila and Arenicola marina hemoglobin were collected and stored as described previously(14.Toulmond A. Lallier F.H. De Frescheville J. Childress J.J. Lee R. Sanders N.K. Desbruyères D. Deep-Sea Res. 1994; 10: 1447-1456Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this study we distinguish the samples we used depending on the duration of their storage: so-called “stored” samples come from either HERO'91 or HERO'92 and have been stored at −40°C until use; so-called “freshly frozen” samples come from the most recent cruise (9°50 EPR/SPRING'95) and have been kept in liquid nitrogen. Analytical gel filtration was performed on a 1 × 30-cm Superose 6-C column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., fractionation range from 5 to 5000 kDa) using a low pressure FPLC system (Pharmacia). The column was equilibrated with a Riftia saline buffer (12.Fisher C.R. Childress J.J. Sanders N.K. Symbiosis. 1988; 5: 229-246Google Scholar) modified in our laboratory, substituting HEPES by bis-tris-propane, the pK of bis-tris-propane (6.8) being closer to the vascular and coelomic pH (7)(14.Toulmond A. Lallier F.H. De Frescheville J. Childress J.J. Lee R. Sanders N.K. Desbruyères D. Deep-Sea Res. 1994; 10: 1447-1456Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The formula is: bis-tris-propane 50 mM, 400 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 32 mM MgSO, and 11 mM CaCl (pH 7.0). Flow rates were typically 0.5 ml/min, and the absorbance of the eluate was monitored at 280 nm and 414 nm. The peaks were collected separately and concentrated with microconcentrator Centricon-10 (Amicon). One or two further purifications using the same protocol were performed to obtain clear fractions when necessary. The column was calibrated with the following marker proteins (Pharmacia): aldolase (158 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), thyroglobulin (669 kDa) and purified A. marina hemoglobin (mean 3.730 ± 126 kDa)(17.Vinogradov S.N. Shlom J.M. Kapp. O.H. Frossard P. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1980; 67B: 1-16Google Scholar, 21.Whilhem P.P. Pilz I. Vinogradov S.N. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1980; 2: 383-384Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). TEM was performed on purified hemoglobin fractions diluted (1:600) into a 0.05 M Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.4). Negatively stained molecules were prepared on carbon-support films following a previously described technique(22.Valentine R.G. Shapiro B.M. Stadtman E.R. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 2143-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The preparations were observed with a Philips 201 electron microscope. Mass measurements were carried out at Brookhaven National Laboratory as described by Wall and Hainfeld(23.Wall J.S. Hainfeld J.F. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 355-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Unstained hemoglobin fractions were prepared in 0.05 M PIPES buffer, pH 7, 1 mM EDTA to a final protein concentration of ca. 0.5 g/l. The STEM was operated at 40 kV, a dose level of 6-10 e/0.1 nm2, and an instrumental resolution of 25 nm. The elastically scattered electron signal from the STEM large angle annular detector was used to form images. Direct measurement of particle mass was obtained by subtracting the background value of the carbon substrate from the value of the region containing particles and multiplying by a calibration factor. The latter was calculated using tobacco mosaic virus as an internal mass standard (39,000 kDa/300.0 nm) (24.Wall J.S. Hren J. Golstein J. Joy D. Analytical Electron Microscopy. Plenum Press, New York1979: 339-342Google Scholar, 25.Wall J.S. Hainfeld J.F. Barlett P.A. Singer D.J. Ultramicroscopy. 1982; 8: 397-402Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). MALLS measurements were performed with a DAWN DSP system (Wyatt Technology Corp.) directly on-line with the FPLC system described above. The eluate was simultaneously monitored with an UV detector and a refractometer (Erma, 7512). The Debye fit method was used for molecular mass and gyration radius determinations(26.Wyatt P.J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Crossref Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). In the calculations we used two different values of dn/dc, the variation rate of the refractive index as a function of concentration: dn/dc = 0.190 ml/g, typical of proteins, for the larger Hb fraction, and dn/dc = 0.170 ml/g, based on evidence that the smaller Hb fractions contain glycoproteins(27.Zal F. Lallier F.H. Green B.N. Vinogradov S.N. Toulmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8875-8881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After purification of the higher M Hb fraction, we incubated it with 2 M, 4 M, and 8 M urea in Riftia saline buffer for 30 min, 2 h, 4 h, and 8 h. Isolation of the dissociation products was performed on the Superose-6 column described above, except that it was calibrated and equilibrated using a buffer containing various urea concentrations. Each peak area was determined with a Coradi planimeter. The nomenclature previously used to name the different fractions does not differentiate between the “FII” fractions from vascular blood and coelomic fluid(8.Terwilliger R.C. Terwilliger N.B. Schabtach E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1980; 65B: 531-535Google Scholar, 11.Arp A.J. Childress J.J. Vetter R.D. J. Exp. Biol. 1987; 128: 139-158Google Scholar). We propose a new nomenclature labeling the vascular Hbs “V” and the coelomic Hbs “C,” numbered sequentially in FPLC elution order. Gel filtration of freshly frozen samples provided two hemoglobin fractions for blood (V1 and V2) and only one for the coelomic fluid (C1) (Fig. 1, A and B). The same experiment performed on stored Riftia fluids showed four vascular (V1-V4) and two coelomic (C1 and C2) Hb peaks (Fig. 1, C and D). The apparent molecular masses of these fractions correspond to about 3000 kDa (V1), 440 kDa (V2), 220 kDa (V3), 150 kDa (V4) for the blood, and 440 kDa (C1) and 150 kDa (C2) for the coelomic fluid. We never found hemoglobin fractions corresponding to a molecular weight of V1 or V3 in the coelomic fluid. To test the stability of the larger Hb we incubated purified Riftia V1 and Arenicola Hbs for 72 h at 4°C diluted in 0.05 M Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5, as in Terwilliger et al.(8.Terwilliger R.C. Terwilliger N.B. Schabtach E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1980; 65B: 531-535Google Scholar). Subsequent gel filtration yielded elution profiles showing three peaks (Fig. 2, A and B). The peaks corresponded to molecular masses 3000 (native molecule), 1500, and 220 kDa. Purified V1 Hb was also incubated with increasing concentrations of urea in saline buffer for 30 min to 8 h (Table 1). After 8 h of incubation with 2 M urea, the native peak was unaltered; a small peak (400 kDa) appeared after 2-h incubation with 4 M urea and a third one (150 kDa) after 8 h. In the presence of 8 M urea after only 30-min incubation, V1 dissociated into three major components with masses 400, 220, and 150 kDa, respectively.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The appearance of V1 Hb on electron micrographs (Fig. 3A) was that of a typical HBL Hb(17.Vinogradov S.N. Shlom J.M. Kapp. O.H. Frossard P. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1980; 67B: 1-16Google Scholar). Its dimensions were: diameter 27 ± 1 nm (n = 10), height 18 ± 1 nm (n = 10). V2 and C1 Hbs appeared as ring-shaped structures (Fig. 3, C and D) with a diameter of 12 ± 1 nm (n = 10), comparable to the diameter of A. marina one-twelfth Hb (11 ± 1 nm, n = 10, Fig. 3B) or to one-third of the diameter of V1. In addition, the inset (Fig. 3A) shows an aggregation of five subunits forming an arc of a circle, indicating the dissociation of an hexagon. We did not observe complete HBL structures with STEM but numerous particles corresponding to one-twelfth of the native molecule. This is observed for several other HBL Hbs, 2S. N. Vinogradov, personal observations.and it is probably due to instability of these molecules under STEM preparative treatment (freeze-drying). A histogram of the masses measured for 331 particles is shown in Fig. 4; the mean mass was 283 ± 45 kDa for the one-twelfth molecule. This result translates into an approximate mass of 3396 ± 540 kDa for the intact molecule. Similarly, the mass of V2 and C1 were estimated at 393 ± 71 kDa (n = 428) and 410 ± 51 kDa (n = 198), respectively. Although close, these values are statistically different (Student's t test, 0.001 < p <0.01), due to the high number of measurements for V2. Mean mass measurements for V3 and C2 were 80 ± 35 kDa (n = 84) and 198 ± 14 kDa (n = 14), respectively. MALLS analysis of V1 Hb yielded profiles as shown in Fig. 5A with molecular masses estimated during the elution of the peak. The mean mass of V1 was 3503 ± 13 kDa (n = 954) with a slight polydispersity as indicated by the slope of the individual estimates. The gyration radius corresponding to the mean of all dimensions of the molecule was 11.0 ± 1.1 nm for V1 Hb (Fig. 5B). Similar analysis for V2 and C1 yielded mean mass of 433 ± 8 kDa (n = 477) and 380 ± 4 kDa (n = 659), respectively. These values are statistically different (Student's t test, 0.001 < p < 0.01). The size of V2 and C1 was too small to be determined with this technique (<10 nm, see Fig. 5B). Mass measurements of all Riftia Hb fractions as determined by FPLC, STEM mass mapping, and MALLS are summarized in Table 2.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Gel filtration performed on freshly frozen body fluids from R. pachyptila revealed two Hb fractions for vascular blood (V1 and V2) and one for coelomic fluid (C1). Therefore we assume that V3, V4, and C2 found only in stored samples are dissociation products of V1, V2, and C1. The elution profile of stored Riftia vascular blood was similar to that obtained for Lamellibrachia sp., another vestimentiferan worm(18.Suzuki T. Takagi T. Ohta S. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 541-545PubMed Google Scholar). However, in this last case, the body fluids were not collected separately before gel filtration, and these results were obtained on mixed fluid. Anyway, Riftia Hbs M values determined by FPLC are in agreement with those found in Lamellibrachia sp. (18.Suzuki T. Takagi T. Ohta S. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 541-545PubMed Google Scholar) for V1, V2, or C1, but they are different from those reported previously for R. pachyptila larger Hb(8.Terwilliger R.C. Terwilliger N.B. Schabtach E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1980; 65B: 531-535Google Scholar). Indeed, Terwilliger and co-workers(8.Terwilliger R.C. Terwilliger N.B. Schabtach E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1980; 65B: 531-535Google Scholar), also working on mixed fluid, obtained two majors fractions with masses around 1700 kDa (FI) and 400 kDa (FII). They interpreted the unusual mass of FI by the pigment instability as well as the broadness of the elution peak that may contain some intact molecules whose molecular masses would correspond more closely to 3000 kDa(8.Terwilliger R.C. Terwilliger N.B. Schabtach E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1980; 65B: 531-535Google Scholar), the usual mass of HBL Hbs. Our experiments on dilution and/or osmotic shock on V1 Hb and A. marina Hb could also explain this unusual mass. Gel filtration performed after incubation of both hemoglobins in 0.05 M Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.5) revealed in both cases three peaks which could correspond to the dissociation of the whole molecule into halves, and one-twelfth subunits. This scheme of dissociation was also found for Lumbricus terrestris HBL Hb(28.Harrington J.P. Herskovits T.T. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4972-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 29.Herskovits T.T. Harrington J.P. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4964-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). V1 Hb is rather unstable and dissociates rapidly in agreement with first observations (8.Terwilliger R.C. Terwilliger N.B. Schabtach E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1980; 65B: 531-535Google Scholar, 30.Terwilliger N.B. Terwilliger R.C. Mar. Biol. Lett. 1984; 5: 191-201Google Scholar), suggesting that the instability of R. pachyptila vascular Hb might be due to changes in pressure as the protein is brought to the surface or during work at atmospheric pressure. This relative instability might well be an inherent property of vestimentiferan Hbs, since the same phenomenon was observed for Lamellibrachia sp. (19.Suzuki T. Takagi T. Furukohri T. Ohta S. Zool. Sci. 1989; 6: 915-926Google Scholar) and for Tevnia jerichonana. 3F. Zal, personal observations.Furthermore, the quaternary structure of HBL Hbs from alvinellids, which are vent annelids, is not similarly affected by pressure changes(30.Terwilliger N.B. Terwilliger R.C. Mar. Biol. Lett. 1984; 5: 191-201Google Scholar).3 Surprisingly, V1 Hb was resistant to dissociation by urea since a small amount (about 30%, Table 1) of dissociation products were observed even at high urea concentrations. The same was true for Lamellibrachia sp.(19.Suzuki T. Takagi T. Furukohri T. Ohta S. Zool. Sci. 1989; 6: 915-926Google Scholar). However, V1 Hb produced the same dissociation products as L. terrestris HBL Hb at alkaline pH with the appearance of three peaks corresponding to subunits approximately 350, 130, and 60-90 kDa(31.Shlom J.M. Vinogradov S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7904-7912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As in L. terrestris, the 350-kDa component is not exactly one-twelfth of the native molecule since it contains some linker chains(31.Shlom J.M. Vinogradov S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7904-7912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since urea is known to destabilize hydrophobic interactions(32.Herskovits T.T. Jaillet H. Gadegbeku B. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4544-4550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these should play a small role in the quaternary structure of V1 Hb. This is consistent with the fact that V1 is rather unstable in solution without denaturant, which could be explained by an important number of hydrogen bounds. Molecular masses of R. pachyptila Hbs measured by MALLS and STEM mass mapping are statistically different (Student's t test, p < 0.001). This discrepancy may be due to the rather harsh preparative treatments necessary for STEM mass mapping as opposed to MALLS, which analyses molecules directly after the purification step. This is also reflected by the lower standard deviations obtained with MALLS. However, both methods yield a usual mass for V1, corresponding to a classical HBL Hb as found in annelids and vestimentifera, and in agreement with the TEM micrographs. V2 and C1 Hbs had masses corresponding to the smaller ring-shaped structures revealed by electron micrographs. Similar structures are also found in pogonophoran(33.Terwilliger R.C. Terwilliger N.B. Hughes G.M. Southward A.J. Southward E.C. J. Mar. Biol. Assoc. U. K. 1987; 67: 219-234Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Both MALLS and STEM mass mapping provide statistically different masses for V2 and C1 suggesting that these two Hbs are distinct molecules. However, as determined by MALLS V2 is larger than C1, while the opposite was found with STEM mass mapping. Even if MALLS estimations are considered more accurate, it is therefore hazardous to conclude that V2 and C1 are indeed distinct molecules. More accurate data on the complete polypeptide chain composition of these Hbs are necessary to resolve this crucial point.

Ann. Rev. Pharmol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar)). Prior to binding of ligand, AHR is located in the cytoplasm as part of a complex that has a molecular mass of about 280 kDa. This complex is comprised of AHR, two molecules of the 90-kDa heat shock protein, and possibly other proteins(2.Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13802-13805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Denis M. Cuthill S. Wilkstrom A.C. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

After binding ligand, AHR dissociates from the above complex and translocates to the nucleus where it heterodimerizes with ARNT. The heterodimer of AHR and ARNT constitutes a transcription factor referred to as the transformed AHR complex, which stimulates the synthesis of the CYPlAl protein and several other proteins involved in xenobiotic metabolism(5.Reyes H.

Activation of transcription occurs through interaction of the transformed AHR complex with several copies of short sequences, termed xenobiotic responsive elements (XREs) or dioxin-responsive elements, located within the 5'-flanking region of the CYP1A1 gene.The AHR and ARNT proteins both contain bHLH motifs toward their amino termini(11.Hoffman E.C.

PAS regions are also found in the Drosophila proteins PER and SIM (14.Nambu J.R. Lewis J.O. Wharton K.A. Crews S.T.

As well as possessing the PAS homology region, the AHRARNT dimer differs from other bHLH bearing transcription factors in at least two other ways: (i) AHR activity is ligand activated and (ii) unlike most other bHLH-bearing transcription factors, whose DNA recognition sequence is the E-box sequence, CANNTG(19.Littlewood T. Evan G. Transcription factors 2: Helix-Loop-Helix. Academic Press, London1994Google Scholar), the AHRARNT heterodimer recognizes an asymmetrical XRE sequence that only partially resembles the E-box. The consensus core XRE sequence is 5‘-TNGCGTG-3‘(20.Yao E.F. Denison M.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5060-5067Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 21.Lusska A. Shen E. Whitlock J.P. J. Biol.

We previously determined the orientation of the AHRARNT heterodimer on the asymmetric XRE sequence by UV light covalent cross-linking analysis. ARNT contacts the thymidine in the XRE core (5'-CGTG-3'), whereas AHR binds 5'-proximal to this(23.Bacsi S.G. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 432438Google Scholar).x-ray crystallographic analysis of four bHLH transcription factors (homodimers of Max, USF, MyoD, and E47) bound to their cognate DNA sequences has shown that protein-DNA interactions occur directly through the basic domain of each monomer (which manifests as an α-helical extension of the subunit's helix 1), whereas the HLH domain mediates intermolecular dimerization(24.Ferré-D'Amaré A.R.

We previously demonstrated corresponding requirements for the equivalent regions of AHR and ARNT by deletion analysis(17.Reisz-Porszasz S. Probst M.R. Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6075-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 28.Fukunaga B.N. Probst M.R. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29270-29278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).The two central nucleotides of the E-box and to a lesser extent the identity of the nucleotides flanking the invariant 5‘-CA and TG-3‘ residues, dictate to which bHLH proteins the E-box will bind.(29.Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar, 30.Fisher D.E. Carr C.S. Parent L.A. Sharp P.A.

A. 1991; 88: 6162-6166Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Specificity for the central two nucleotides (typically CG or GC) is determined primarily by the identity of the amino acid located one helical turn toward the carboxyl terminus from a conserved glutamic acid residue in the basic regions of the bHLH proteins (found at position 36 of Max, see Fig. 3). When arginine is found at this position (as for example, in Max, USF, and TFEB), CG is preferred. When a smaller, nonpolar residues is present (as for example in AP4, MyoD and E12), GC is preferred(19.Littlewood T. Evan G. Transcription factors 2: Helix-Loop-Helix. Academic Press, London1994Google Scholar).The basic domain of ARNT conforms well to the consensus polypeptide sequence for this submotif, whereas the basic domain of AHR (which we refer to as its nominal basic domain) conforms poorly, consistent with the observation that the DNA recognition sequence for AHR is noncanonical for this class of transcription factors. In this paper, we have studied the basic domain of ARNT and the equivalent region of AHR, as well as flanking regions, in order to characterize the protein-DNA interactions of the AHRARNTXRE complex. Using an alanine scanning mutagenesis approach, we tested individual residues for XRE binding by performing EMSA. The alanine scanning mutagenesis approach was used, because (i) alanines confer α-helical secondary structure in polypeptide chains and α-helical secondary structure is manifested by the basic regions of solved bHLH proteins as they contact DNA and (ii) alanine lacks a reactive side group. Our results indicate that the mode of interaction of the basic domain of ARNT with DNA resembles that of other bHLH proteins. However, we provide evidence that AHR exhibits a pattern of DNA interaction that is novel for bHLH proteins. We find that XRE binding requires only the carboxyl-proximal portion of the nominal basic region of AHR. We previously demonstrated that DNA binding by AHR also requires a block of amino acids amino-terminal to the nominal basic domain(18.Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3743-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). By characterizing both alanine substitution mutations and certain conservative amino acid substitution mutations in both the above amino-terminal block and in the nominal basic region of AHR, we discriminate between amino acids positions that are less tolerant to substitution with regard to XRE binding and those which are more tolerant. The former may contact bases in the XRE, and the latter may contact the phosphodiester backbone. By peptide plot analysis and through informative mutant AHR proteins, we impute a non-α-helical structure for the extended putative DNA-binding region of AHR, further indicating the unique nature of the DNA-binding domain of this bHLH protein.MATERIALS AND METHODSGeneration of ARNT Alanine Scanning MutantsAll ARNT constructs are presented in Table 1. The full-length ARNT construct pcDNA3ARNT was used for the generation of all ARNT mutants. ARNT alanine scanning mutants A(86-89), A(92, 95-97), A(103-106), R91A, N93A, H94A, E98A, R99A, R100A, R101A, and R102A were generated by the overlap extension method of PCR (32.Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar) using UlTma DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). Briefly, oligonucleotides were synthesized to provide internal 5' and internal 3' primers containing complementary alanine codon substitutions in their 5' regions. These primers were used in conjunction with external 3' and external 5' primers, respectively, in a primary PCR reaction. pcDNA3ARNT was used as the template in the primary reactions resulting in alanine codon-substituted 5' and 3' PCR products. These products were used as templates for a second round of PCR in which the 5' and 3' PCR products linked together to form a full-length alanine codon-substituted product, which upon amplification with only the external 5' and external 3' primers resulted in the desired alanine codon-substituted product. The external 5' primer corresponded to pcDNA3 bases 839-871. The external 3' primer corresponded to the complement of ARNT bases 691-705. PCR products from the second round of amplification were digested with the restriction enzymes HindIII and ApaLI and subsequently ligated with the 899-base pair ApaLI-KpnI and 6443-base pair HindIII-KpnI fragments of pcDNA3/ARNT to produce the alanine-substituted forms of the ARNT protein. Amino-terminally truncated ARNT mutants NA89 and NA85 were generated using standard PCR reactions and primers that generated the desired truncation. PCR products amplified from pcDNA3/ARNT were digested with HindIII and KpnI and ligated with pcDNA3/ARNT fragments as described above for generation of ARNT alanine scanning mutants. All ARNT clones were sequenced to verify the mutation.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Generation of AHR MutantsAHR constructs are presented in Table 2 and Table 3. The full-length AHR construct pcDNA3/βAHR described previously (18.Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3743-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was used for the generation of all AHR mutants. AHR alanine scanning and conservative amino acid substitution mutants A(27-29), A(40, 42), E28A, G29A, I30A, K31A, S32A, N33A, P34A, S35A, K36A, R37A, H38A, R39A, D40A, R41A, L42A, N43A, Y9W, Y9S, R14K, H38N, and R39K, were generated by the overlap extension method of PCR using UlTma DNA polymerase. The protocol for generation of the ARNT alanine scanning mutants was followed with these differences: (i) the internal primers were designed to generate either the desired alanine codon(s) or the desired conservative substitution codon; (ii) the template for the primary PCR reactions was pcDNA3/βAHR; and (iii) a different external 3' primer was used in the primary and secondary PCR reactions. PCR products from the second round of amplification were digested with the restriction enzymes HindIII and Bpu1102I and subsequently ligated into similarly digested pcDNA3/βAHR from which the corresponding HindIII-Bpu1102I fragment had been removed. AHR deletion mutants Δ17-26, Δ17-32, and Δ18-32 were generated by PCR using pcDNA3/βAHR and primers designed to produce the desired deleted form upon amplification. Each AHR mutant clone was sequenced to verify the mutation.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In Vitro Transcription and TranslationAll constructs, including the AHR and ARNT parent clones as well as their mutant derivatives, represent cDNA forms of each gene contained within the pcDNA3 expression vector in the appropriate orientation for in vitro expression from the T7 promoter. Constructs were expressed in the TNT T7 coupled reticulocyte system in the presence or the absence of [S]methionine (final concentration, 1 mCi/ml; specific activity, >1,000 Ci/mM; Amersham Corp.) according to the protocol provided by the supplier (Promega Biotech). Reactions were incubated at 30°C for at least 90 min. Expression of each construct was assayed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of an aliquot from an incubation performed in the presence of [S]methionine. Following drying of the gel, quantitation of each construct's level of expression was performed with the aid of an AMBIS Radioanalytic Imaging System (AMBIS Inc.), which will henceforth be referred to as β-scanning.Dimerization of Mutant ARNT and AHR Proteins with Wild Type PartnersFull-length ARNT or its mutant derivatives were synthesized in vitro as described above, in the presence of [S]methionine, whereas AHR and its mutant derivatives were synthesized in the absence of isotope. Radiolabeled ARNT or a radiolabeled-mutant ARNT was mixed with an equimolar amount of AHR mutant derivative or AHR, respectively. The mixed proteins were incubated with 10 nM TCDD (dissolved in Me2SO to give a final concentration of 0.2% Me2SO) or solvent alone for 1.5 h at room temperature. Following this incubation, the mixture was adjusted to 25 mM HEPES, 1.2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 200 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4 (immunoprecipitation buffer). Affinity purified polyclonal antibody to a peptide corresponding to amino acids 12-31 of AHR (7.Probst M.R. Reisz-Porszasz S. Agbunag R.V. Ong M.S. Hankinson O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 511-518PubMed Google Scholar) or the corresponding preimmune IgG fraction was then added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The resultant immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with immunoprecipitation buffer, whereas the supernatant fractions were precipitated with three volumes of acetone. Before subjecting each fraction to 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, they were boiled in SDS sample buffer(33.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar). After drying, the gels were exposed to x-ray film and analyzed by β-scanning to quantitate the level of radioactivity in each immunoprecipitate. The relative TCDD-induced dimerization capacity of each ARNT or AHR mutant was calculated as a percentage of the amount of radiolabeled wild type ARNT coimmunoprecipitated with wild type AHR in the same experiment. Mean values were calculated from three independent experiments.XRE BindingWild type ARNT and AHR or their mutant derivatives were synthesized in vitro in the absence of isotope and mixed in equimolar ratios followed by incubation in the presence or the absence of 10 nM TCDD (in Me2SO to a final concentration of 0.2% Me2SO) or solvent alone at room temperature for 1.5 h. Each reaction was then adjusted to 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mM KCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 5 mM EDTA, 50 μM of poly(dI-dC)(dI-dC) (Pharmacia) and incubated an additional 20 min at room temperature. The reactions were then incubated another 20 min in the presence of a P-labeled double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide containing mouse XRE1(7.Probst M.R. Reisz-Porszasz S. Agbunag R.V. Ong M.S. Hankinson O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 511-518PubMed Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes were examined by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA) using 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 1 × HTE buffer (200 mM HEPES, 100 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). After drying, the gels were exposed to x-ray film and then analyzed by β-scanning to quantitate AHRARNTXRE complexes. The value for each mutant AHR or ARNT protein was calculated as a percentage of the amount obtained with the corresponding wild type protein in the same experiment. Mean values were calculated from three independent experiments.RESULTSARNT's Interaction with the XRE Resembles the Interaction of bHLH Proteins with the E-box Subclass CACGTGIn order to study the XRE binding role of each amino acid residue within and adjacent to the basic domain of ARNT, specific amino acid residues were substituted with alanine. Using EMSA, we previously demonstrated that incubation of in vitro synthesized ARNT and AHR, TCDD, and P-labeled XRE results in a specific gel-shifted band and that this band corresponds to the AHRARNTXRE complex, because it was not formed upon testing either protein by itself, its intensity was greatly diminished in the absence of TCDD and greatly reduced by the addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled XRE, and the band was unaffected by the addition of a 100-fold excess of a mutant XRE(17.Reisz-Porszasz S. Probst M.R. Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6075-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In the present study, we utilized equimolar amounts of wild type AHR and either wild type or alanine-substituted ARNT protein in the presence of 10 nM TCDD and quantitated the amount of AHRARNTXRE complex generated on subsequent EMSA with the aid of an AMBIS Radioanalytic Imaging System (referred to as β-scanning). The value for each mutant was calculated as a percentage of that produced by the wild type ARNT protein in the same experiment. The average results for each ARNT alanine mutant, derived from data of three independent experiments are shown in Table 1, and representative autoradiograms of EMSA are presented in Fig. 1A.Figure 1XRE binding analysis of mutant AHR and ARNT proteins in combination with normal AHR and ARNT. Equimolar amounts of normal or mutant AHR proteins were mixed with normal or mutant ARNT proteins as indicated in the presence (+) or the absence (-) of 10 mM TCDD along with radiolabeled XRE, and EMSA was then performed. The resultant AHRARNTXRE complexes (open arrows) were resolved by nondenaturing 4.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The solid arrows indicate free probe.

In order to test whether the corresponding amino acid positions within and flanking the basic domain of ARNT share this lack of DNA interaction, several mutants containing blocks of alanines substituted for the normal amino acids were studied. ARNT alanine mutants A(86-89), A(92, 95-97), and A(103-106) showed no significant reduction or increase in XRE binding when compared with wild type ARNT when tested by EMSA. These results indicate that the amino acids that are substituted in A(92, 95-97) do not contact DNA and that amino acids immediately amino-terminal (A(86-89)) or carboxyl-terminal (A(103-106)) to the basic region are also unlikely to contact DNA.Four single alanine substitution mutant ARNT proteins (H94A, E98A, Rl0lA, and R102A) exhibited markedly reduced XRE binding of between 0 and 12% of that observed for wild type ARNT (p<0.05), indicating that critical XRE-protein contacts occur at these positions. Three other single alanine substitution ARNT mutants (R91A, N93A, and R99A) exhibited moderately diminished complex formation (between 40 and 75% of the wild type ARNT value (p < 0.05)), suggesting that these positions may also be involved in contacting the XRE. ARNT mutant R100A bound the XRE as efficiently as wild type ARNT. The conserved arginine residue at position 100 is therefore probably not involved in XRE-protein contact, as has been shown to be the case by x-ray crystallography for the corresponding arginine residue of other bHLH proteins contacting the E-box (see Fig. 3). These findings are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 3.Each ARNT mutant with reduced XRE binding activity was tested for its ability to heterodimerize with AHR, because reduced levels of AHRARNTXRE complex formation could reflect diminished dimerization capacity rather than a direct effect on DNA binding. [S]methionine-radiolabeled in vitro synthesized mutant or wild type ARNT protein was mixed with an equimolar amount of unlabeled AHR in the presence or the absence of 10 nM TCDD. Following dimerization, the mixtures were immunoprecipitated using AHR antibody. The degree of heterodimerization for each mutant protein with wild type AHR was calculated as a percentage of the amount of wild type ARNT coimmunoprecipitated with wild type AHR. The first six lanes of Fig. 2A represent the controls for the coimmunoprecipitation assay. These reactions were performed with wild type AHR and wild type ARNT proteins incubated in the presence or the absence of TCDD and utilized AHR antibodies or the corresponding preimmune IgG fraction, as indicated. The results of the control reactions showed that TCDD treatment increased the amount of ARNT protein that coimmunoprecipitated with AHR and that very little or no ARNT was coimmunoprecipitated by the preimmune IgG fraction. Therefore, the coimmunoprecipitations were efficient, TCDD-inducible, and specific for AHRARNT heterodimers. Each ARNT mutant performed as efficiently as wild type ARNT in the heterodimerization assays, demonstrating that the observed reductions in XRE binding ability represent altered DNA binding capabilities rather than decreased formation of AHRARNT heterodimers.Figure 2Dimerization analysis of AHR and ARNT mutant proteins in combination with normal AHR or ARNT, respectively. The first six lanes of each panel represent control reactions. AHR antibody (Ab) was used in all reactions except in the fifth and sixth control lanes of each panel, where preimmune IgG was used.

The phosphorothioate group has been individually introduced at the central nine phosphate positions and the two diastereomers produced at each site separated and purified. The K and V values found for each of these modified DNA molecules with the EcoRV restriction endonuclease have been determined and compared with those seen for the unmodified all-phosphate-containing dodecamer. This has enabled an evaluation of the roles that both of the non-esterified oxygen atoms in the individual phosphates play in DNA binding and hydrolysis by the endonuclease. The results have also been compared with crystal structures of the EcoRV endonuclease, complexed with an oligodeoxynucleotide, to allow further definition of phosphate group function during substrate binding and turnover.

Using 5-[N-(p-azidobenzoyl)-3-aminoallyl] photocross-linking, we previously determined the locations of the two large subunits of transcription factor (TF) IIA (A35 and A21), TATA box-binding protein (TBP), RNA polymerase II-associated protein (RAP) 30, and TFIIB along the Ad2 ML promoter. We have now localized TFIIE34 and RAP74 just upstream of the transcription start site. The two subunits of TFIIF, RAP74 and RAP30, cross-linked to nucleotides that probed adjacent spaces on the same face of the DNA helix beginning just downstream of TBP at −19 and extending to −5. Specific photocross-linking of TFIIE34 required the presence TFIIE56. In addition, TFIIE and RAP74 strongly stimulated cross-linking of RAP30 and the large subunits of RNA polymerase II to position −19. Our topological data support the idea that RAP74 and TFIIE34 may be involved in melting of the promoter DNA upstream of the initiation site."

Binding of hsp90 to the receptor through its HBD inactivates the DNA binding domain (DBD). The DBD contains a number of cysteines essential to its DNA binding activity. Here, we assess the effects of hsp90 binding on the accessibility of cysteine residues in both the HBD and DBD to derivatization by a thiol-specific reagent. We report that N-iodoacetyltyrosine (IAT) inactivates steroid binding activity of the immunopurified, untransformed GRhsp90 complex in a manner that is prevented by the sulfhydryl reagents cysteine and dithiothreitol but is not reversed by them. The I-labeled IAT derivative N-iodoacetyl-3-[I]iodotyrosine ([I]IAIT) covalently labels the immunopurified, hsp90-bound receptor in a thiol-specific manner. Dissociation of hsp90 leads to an 2-fold increase in [I]IAIT labeling of the full-length, 100-kDa GR. The increase in thiol labeling is related to the presence of hsp90 because it is blocked by molybdate, which prevents hsp90 dissociation. Cleavage of the [I]IAIT-labeled receptor with trypsin yields a 15-kDa labeled fragment containing the DBD and a 30-kDa labeled fragment containing all of the cysteines in the HBD and the contact region for hsp90. Dissociation of hsp90 from the GR results in a 2.3-fold increase in [I]IAIT labeling of the 15-kDa fragment and a 50% decrease in labeling of the 30-kDa fragment. These data are consistent with the proposal that dissociation of hsp90 from the GR produces a conformational change in the HBD such that some of the thiols that are exposed in the GRhsp90 complex become buried and are no longer accessible to the [I]IAIT probe.

Furthermore, the steady-state levels of the mMCP-1 and mMCP-2 transcripts in BALB/c mBMMC can be reversibly altered by adding or withdrawing IL-10 from the culture medium(14.Ghildyal N. Friend D.S.

Half-maximal levels of both chymase transcripts are achieved after the cells are cultured with IL-10 for only 24 h, and plateau levels of the two chymase transcripts are reduced to half-maximum within 24 h of IL-10 withdrawal. The rate by which the steady-state levels of the two protease transcripts in these nontransformed mast cells can be increased or decreased raised the possibility that post-transcriptional control mechanisms might contribute to mast cell protease heterogeneity.We now demonstrate that the IL-10-regulated expression of the chymase mMCP-2 in BALB/c mBMMC occurs primarily by a post-transcriptional mechanism. This discovery has broad implications for understanding how the expression of the chromosome 14 superfamily of serine proteases is regulated in mast cells and other hematopoietic cells during inflammation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CulturemBMMC were obtained by culturing bone marrow cells from the femurs and tibias of 6-10-week-old female BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) in IL-3-enriched 50% WEHI-3 cell (line TIB-68; American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) conditioned medium and 50% enriched medium (RPMI 1640 containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μg/ml gentamicin, 2 mML-glutamine, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% fetal calf serum) for 2-6 weeks at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO(20.Razin E.

Every 7 days, the nonadherent cells in each culture were transferred to a new flask containing fresh medium. In all experiments in which BALB/c mBMMC were treated with IL-10, cells were cultured in WEHI-3 cell-conditioned medium supplemented with 100 units of COS cell-derived IL-10(22.Ghildyal N.

The MC-9 cell line was used to standardize the level of biologically active IL-10 in the COS cell supernatant; 1 unit of IL-10 elicits a half-maximal incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA. Cell viability was assessed by a dye exclusion assay. Routinely, cultured mBMMC (105-106 cells/ml) were mixed with an equal volume of trypan blue (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the numbers of cells that excluded the dye were quantitated with a microscope equipped with a × 40 objective.RNA Blot and Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) AnalysesTotal RNA was extracted (25.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62982) Google Scholar) from BALB/c mBMMC cultured in the presence or absence of IL-10 with Tri Reagent(™) (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) and was quantitated by measuring the optical density at 260 nm. For blot analysis, RNA samples were denatured in formaldehyde/formamide and electrophoresed in 1.3% formaldehyde-agarose gels. The separated RNAs were transferred to MagnaGraph membranes (Micron Separations, Westover, MA)(26.Thomas P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hybridization reactions were carried out at 68°C in QuikHyb(™) solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) containing 200 μg/ml of salmon sperm DNA and one of the radiolabeled probes (2 × 106 cpm/ml) for 2 h. The membranes were washed twice (20 min each) at 65°C with 2 × SSC (1 × SSC = 150 mM NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0) and 0.1% SDS, and then twice at 65°C (20 min each) with 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS. Kodak XAR-5 film and intensifying screens were used for autoradiography. Film was exposed at −80°C for 15 h to 3 days. The relative amount of each mMCP transcript was estimated by quantitating the associated radioactivity with a Betascope 603 Blot Analyzer (Betagen, Waltham, MA). To ensure that comparable amounts of total RNA were loaded in each lane, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide. In some instances, the blot was reprobed with the radiolabeled 18 S-specific oligonucleotide, 5-ACGGTATCTGATCGTCTTCGAACC-3′.RT-PCRs were performed with total or cytoplasmic RNA isolated from 3-6-week-old BALB/c mBMMC. Samples were incubated with RNase-free DNase I for 10 min at room temperature to remove residual genomic DNA. Using the cDNA cycle kit from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA), 2 μg of RNA and 0.2 μg of oligo(dT) primer (18-mer) were placed in a mirocentrifuge tube and incubated at 65°C for 10 min to disrupt the secondary structure of the transcript. Each RNA sample was reverse-transcribed at 42°C for 1 h in 20 μl of a solution containing 1 × reverse transcription buffer, 10 units of RNase inhibitor, 20 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. The reaction mixture was extracted with 20 μl of phenol-chloroform, precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol, and resuspended in 20 μl of distilled water. A 2-μl sample of the resulting cDNA preparation was mixed with 48 μl of 1 × PCR buffer containing 2 mM MgCl, 2.5 units of AmpliTaq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), 0.2 μg of a primer corresponding to a 5′ region in exon 1 (5′-ACTGGCAAAATGCAGGCC-3′) of the mMCP-2 transcript, and 0.2 μg of a primer corresponding to a 3′ region in exon 5 (5′-CATCATCACAGACATGTG-3′) of the mMCP-2 transcript. Thirty to 35 cycles of PCR were performed. Each cycle consisted of a 1-min denaturation step at 94°C, a 2-min annealing step at 55°C, and a 3-min extension step at 72°C. To verify the authenticity of their nucleotide sequences, the RT-PCR products were purified by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. The appropriate bands were excised, purified with Geneclean(™) (BIO 101, Vista, CA), and defined by Taq cycle-sequencing technology at the Biocore Facility of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute.Nuclear Run-on AssaysNuclear run-on assays were performed essentially as described by Greenberg and Bender(29.Greenberg M.E.

The denatured DNA samples were neutralized with 2 M ammonium sulfate and then were slot-blotted (31.Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21364) Google Scholar) at 5 μg/lane onto nylon membranes. The resulting DNA blots were baked and UV-cross-linked. For an additional negative control, a 700-base pair (bp) fragment of a type IX collagen cDNA in pBR322 DNA (32.Olsen B.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 179: 71-78Google Scholar) was included in the slot blots.mBMMC (1-5 × 107) maintained in medium containing or lacking IL-10 were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and disrupted by two treatments with 5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). After centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min at 4°C, the nuclei-enriched pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of storage buffer (40% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Each nuclear run-on reaction was initiated in a 400-μl reaction buffer containing 0.5 mM ATP, 0.5 mM CTP, 0.5 mM GTP, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 units of RNase inhibitor, 100 μCi of [P]UTP, 20% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl, 150 mM KCl, and 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30°C for 30 min and then for 5 min at room temperature with 25 μg/ml DNase I (RNase-free). Tri Reagent (750 μl) and CHCl (200 μl) were added, and the radiolabeled nascent nuclear RNAs in the aqueous phase were precipitated with isopropanol, resuspended in 100 μl of buffer (10 mM Tes, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.2% SDS), purified with a gel filtration spin column (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and incubated with one of the DNA slot blots. Each hybridization reaction was carried out at 65°C for 36-48 h in a small vial containing 1-2 ml of hybridization buffer (10 mM Tes, 10 mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 0.6 NaCl, 1 × Denhardt's solution, and 300 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA) and 1 to 5 × 106 cpm of radiolabeled nuclear RNA. After hybridization, the blot was treated with 10 μg/ml RNase A for 20 min at 37°C, washed three times (20 min each) with 2 × SSC at 65°C, and exposed to x-ray film for 1-3 days.Plasmids containing either a full-length β-actin, mMCP-2, or mMCP-4 cDNA were also digested with a restriction enzyme, and the digests (10 μg of DNA/lane) were electrophoresed in a 1.2% agarose gel. The separated DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane, and the resulting blot was evaluated for hybridization to the appropriately sized insert with a replicate sample of radiolabeled nuclear RNA.Pulse-Chase ExperimentsHarrold et al. (33.Harrold S. Genovese C. Kobrin B. Morrison S.L. Milcarek C. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) found that a pulse-chase assay is the most accurate method for evaluating the rate of turnover of a transcript that has a relatively long half-life. For the pulse-chase assay, 3-6-wk-old BALB/c mBMMC (108) were pretreated with IL-10 overnight in 50 ml of 50% WEHI-3 cell-conditioned medium to induce high steady-state levels of the mMCP-2 transcript. The resulting cells were then radiolabeled with 100 μCi of [5,6-3H]uridine (40 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN)/ml of medium for 20 h in the presence IL-10. After this pulse, the radiolabeled cells were washed twice with nonradioactive enriched medium. One-half of the cells were resuspended in 50 ml of 50% WEHI-3 cell-conditioned medium supplemented with IL-10, 100 μg/ml unlabeled uridine, and 50 μg/ml unlabeled cytidine. The other half of the cells were resuspended in the chase medium lacking IL-10. At various time points in the chase, samples of cells (107) were removed from the culture, total RNA was isolated, and the steady-state levels of the different transcripts were quantitated by blot analysis. In this analytical procedure, plasmid DNA (5 μg lacking or containing a mMCP-2, mMCP-5, or β-actin gene-specific probe) was immobilized onto a separate lane of a slot blot, as described above. The filters were incubated 1-2 h at 65°C in 1 ml of hybridization buffer. Samples (0.5 or 1 × 107 cpm) of radiolabeled RNA were denatured at 85°C for 5 min, cooled on ice, and then placed in the hybridization solution. The blots were incubated with the radiolabeled RNA samples for 2 days at 65°C. After hybridization, each blot was washed with two changes of 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 10 min each and then with 2 changes of 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65°C. The amount of blot-bound radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. pBS DNA was used to quantitate nonspecific binding of 3H-labeled RNA. The amount of radioactivity bound to pBS DNA was subtracted from each set of readings to determine the amount of radiolabeled RNA that specifically bound to the mMCP-2, mMCP-5, and β-actin cDNA probes.Effects of Actinomycin D and Cycloheximide on the Steady-state Levels of the mMCP-2 TranscriptTo examine the effects of actinomycin D, BALB/c mBMMC were cultured in the presence of IL-10 for 48 h, washed twice, and resuspended in 50% WEHI-3 cell-conditioned medium with or without IL-10. Actinomycin D (Sigma) was then added to both cultures of cells at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. Samples of cells (5 × 106) were removed immediately, or 5, 10, 15, or 24 h after the addition of actinomycin D. Total cellular RNA was isolated from each sample, and equal amounts of total RNA were loaded in the individual lanes of the gel. After electrophoresis, the steady-state level of the mMCP-2 transcript in the samples was determined by blot analysis.To determine if an inhibitor of protein synthesis can block the IL-10-induced expression of the mMCP-2 transcript, mBMMC (107) were washed and resuspended in 50% WEHI-3 cell-conditioned medium containing IL-10 and varying doses (0, 1, 5, and 20 μg/ml) of cycloheximide (Sigma). After 24 h of culture, total RNA was isolated from the four populations of mBMMC, and the amount of mMCP-2 mRNA in each was quantitated by blot analysis as described above. To determine if cycloheximide can influence the steady-state level of the established mMCP-2 transcript, 108 mBMMC were pretreated with IL-10, washed in enriched medium, and resuspended in 50 ml of 50% WEHI-3 cell-conditioned medium containing 1 μg/ml cycloheximide with or without IL-10. At various time points, total RNA was isolated and the steady-state levels of the mMCP-2 transcript in the resulting 10 samples were quantitated by blot analysis.RESULTSTranscription of Chymase GenesAs assessed by RNA blot analysis, BALB/c mBMMC developed with IL-3-enriched conditioned medium possess high steady-state levels of the mMCP-5 transcript, but not the mMCP-1, mMCP-2, and mMCP-4 transcripts (Fig. 1A). Nonetheless, nuclear run-on assays revealed that the mMCP-1, mMCP-2, and mMCP-4 genes are transcribed efficiently in BALB/c mBMMC whether these cells are cultured in the absence or presence of IL-10 (Fig. 1B). To confirm the slot blot data obtained with gene-specific probes of limited length, full-length mMCP-2 (n = 1), mMCP-4 (n = 2), and β-actin (n = 2) cDNAs were resolved from plasmid DNA by gel electrophoresis and transferred to nylon membranes. Blot analysis demonstrated hybridization of radiolabeled transcripts in the nuclear RNA preparation to all three cDNAs but not to plasmid vector DNA (data not shown).RT-PCR and Nucleotide Sequence Analysis of the mMCP-2 TranscriptThe detection of mMCP-2 pre-mRNA in a nuclear run-on analysis of mBMMC before these mast cells were exposed to IL-10 prompted an RT-PCR investigation to determine whether or not the cells contain small amounts of a properly processed mMCP-2 transcript. With mMCP-2-specific primers, a 910-bp RT-PCR product was obtained from mBMMC cultured in the absence or presence of IL-10 (Fig. 2). As assessed by ethidium bromide staining, the 910-bp product generated from the RNA sample obtained from untreated mBMMC (lane 2) was substantially less than that obtained from mBMMC treated with IL-10 (lane 1) even though 30 cycles were used in the depicted RT-PCR analysis. Nevertheless, sequence analysis confirmed that both products corresponded to a properly processed mMCP-2 transcript (data not shown). Thus, mBMMC process mMCP-2 pre-mRNA identically whether or not they are exposed to IL-10.Figure 2RT-PCR analysis of mMCP-2 transcripts. Samples of total RNA from BALB/c mBMMC cultured in the presence (lane 1) or absence (lane 2) of IL-10 were subjected to RT-PCR (30 cycles) with a set of primers specific for mMCP-2. The resulting products were then assessed for their relative size by agarose gel electrophoresis. The arrow on the left indicates the 910-bp product expected if the mature mMCP-2 transcript is present in a RNA sample. Size markers are indicated in lane 3 and on the right. Similar findings were obtained in four other experiments with other sets of mMCP-2-specific primers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Determination of the Half-life of the mMCP-2 Transcript by Pulse-Chase AnalysisWith the use of a pulse-chase approach to monitor the half-lives of the mMCP-2, mMCP-5, and β-actin transcripts, mast cells were sequentially cultured in medium containing IL-10 and [3H]uridine, washed, and chased in medium containing or lacking IL-10. The levels of the radiolabeled transcripts were then quantitated by slot blot analysis. Whereas the 34-h half-life of the mMCP-5 transcript and the 10-h half-life of the β-actin transcript were unaffected by treatment of the cells with IL-10, the half-life of the mMCP-2 transcript increased 4-fold from 8 h to 34 h in cells treated with IL-10 (Fig. 3). In a second experiment carried out with a different lot of mBMMC, the half-life of the mMCP-2 transcript increased 3.4-fold, from 8 h to 27 h, in cells treated with IL-10.Figure 3Stability of the mMCP-2, mMCP-5, and β-actin transcripts. mBMMC were radiolabeled with [3H]uridine in the presence of IL-10 and then were washed and cultured in radioactive-free medium with (•) or without (○) IL-10. The amounts of radiolabeled mMCP-2, mMCP-5, and β-actin transcripts in each culture were determined at the indicated time points in the chase. Results are expressed as a percent of the starting level of the transcript. In these experiments, the specific binding of radiolabeled transcripts to the mMCP-2 probe was 17-81-fold higher than the background binding of radiolabeled transcripts to pBS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Actinomycin D and Cycloheximide on the Steady-state Levels of the mMCP-2 TranscriptThe capacity of IL-10 to slow down the rate of degradation of the mMCP-2 transcript was examined in mBMMC subsequently exposed to the inhibitor of gene transcription, actinomycin D. Preliminary dose-response experiments revealed that actinomycin D at a final"

One exception is interleukin-4 (IL-4), which has been shown not to activate this pathway in hematopoietic cells. However, IL-4 acts on a broad range of cells, including keratinocytes, in which it induces IL-6 production. We report here that IL-4 stimulation of human keratinocytic cell lines or primary cultures activates MAP kinase. In these cells, IL-4 stimulation induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of p42/44 MAP kinase as well as its catalytic activity. We also observed an increased phosphorylation of p46, an SH2-containing protein involved in the Ras pathway, as a result of IL-4 stimulation in human keratinocytic cell lines but not in T lymphocytes. Most cytokines stimulate the p21pathway, leading to MAP kinase activation. One exception is interleukin-4 (IL-4), which has been shown not to activate this pathway in hematopoietic cells.

https://openalex.org/W2057700322,"Mannan chains of Kluyveromyces lactis mannoproteins are similar to those of Saccharomyces cerevisiae except that they have terminal α12-linked N-acetylglucosamine and lack mannose phosphate. In a previous study, Douglas and Ballou (Douglas, R. K., and Ballou, C. E. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 1561-1570) characterized a mutant, mnn2-2, which lacked terminal N-acetylglucosamine in its mannoproteins. The mutant had normal levels of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity, and the partially purified enzyme from wild-type and mutant cells had the same apparent size, heat stability, affinity for substrates, metal requirement, and subcellular location. No qualitative or quantitative differences were found between mutant and wild-type cells in endogenous mannan acceptors and pools of UDP-GlcNAc. Chitin was synthesized at similar rates in wild-type and mutant cells, and the latter did not have a soluble inhibitor of the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase or a hexosaminidase that could remove N-acetylglucosamine from mannoproteins. Together, the above observations led Douglas and Ballou ((1982) Biochemistry 21, 1561-1570) to postulate that the mutant might have a defect in compartmentation of substrates involved in the biosynthesis of mannoproteins.We determined whether the above mutant phenotype is the result of defective transport of UDP-GlcNAc into Golgi vesicles from K. lactis. Golgi vesicles which were sealed and of the same membrane topographical orientation as in vivo were isolated from wild-type and mnn2-2 mutant cells and incubated with UDP-GlcNAc in an assay in vitro. The initial rate of transport of UDP-GlcNAc into Golgi vesicles from wild-type cells was temperature dependent, saturable with an apparent K of 5.5 μM and a V of 8.2 pmol/mg of protein/3 min. No transport of UDP-GlcNAc was detected into Golgi vesicles from mutant cells. However, Golgi vesicles from both cells translocated GDP-mannose at comparable velocities, indicating that the above transport defect is specific. In addition to the above defect in mannoproteins, mutant cells were also deficient in the biosynthesis of glucosamine containing lipids.

https://openalex.org/W2073288113,"Using four cultured cell models representing liver, keratinocyte, and osteoblast, we have demonstrated that the vitamin D analog, 22-oxacalcitriol is degraded into a variety of hydroxylated and side chain truncated metabolites. Four of these metabolic products have been rigorously identified by high pressure liquid chromatography, diode array spectrophotometry, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis as 24-hydroxylated and 26-hydroxylated derivatives as well as the cleaved molecules, hexanor-1α,20-dihydroxyvitamin D and hexanor-20-oxo-1α-hydroxyvitamin D. Comparison with chemically synthesized standards has revealed the stereochemistry of the biological products. Although differences exist in the amounts of products formed with the different cell types, it is apparent that 22-oxacalcitriol is subject to metabolism by both vitamin D-inducible and noninducible enzymes. Time course studies suggest that the truncated 20-alcohol is derived from a side chain hydroxylated molecule via a hemiacetal intermediate and the 20-oxo derivative is likely formed from the 20-alcohol. Biological activity measurements of the metabolites identified in our studies are consistent with the view that these are catabolites and that the biological activity of 22-oxacalcitriol is due to the parent compound. These results are also consistent with recent findings of others that the biliary excretory form of 22-oxacalcitriol is a glucuronide ester of the truncated 20-alcohol.

It is now firmly established that the hormonal form of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1α, 25-(OH)D or calcitriol) 1D and D indicate vitamins D and D, respectively, and OH and (OH) indicate hydroxy and dihydroxy, respectively. Therefore, for example, 1α,25-(OH)D represents 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.has potent cell differentiating/anti-proliferative activities in addition to its role in calcium homeostasis(1.Suda T. Shinki T. Takahashi N. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1990; 10: 195-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This has led researchers in both universities and the pharmaceutical industry to search for so-called “noncalcemic” vitamin D analogs with accentuated differentiating/anti-proliferative properties and reduced ability to cause hypercalcemia(2.Calverley M.J.

OCT binds to the chicken vitamin D receptor (VDR) with an approximately 8 times lower affinity than 1α,25-(OH)D(4.Okano T. Tsugawa N. Masuda S. Takeuchi A. Kobayashi T. Nishii Y. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1989; 35: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, OCT is 10 times more effective than 1α,25-(OH)D in suppressing cell growth and inducing differentiation of the mouse myelocytic leukemic cell, WEHI-3, in vitro(5.Abe J. Morikawa M.

Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 2645-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).

OCT binds poorly to the vitamin D binding protein (DBP) and is transported in the plasma bound by lipoproteins (chylomicrons and low density lipoprotein) in vivo(9.Kobayashi T. Okano T. Tsugawa N.

In contrast, little is known about OCT metabolism except that it appears to be excreted as a glucuronide conjugate in the bile, possibly a derivative of a truncated version of OCT(10.Kobayashi T.

In these studies we set out to provide convincing physicochemical identification for metabolites generated in a variety of cultured cell models, namely the human hepatoma lines HepG2 and Hep3B(12.Strugnell S.

Because these cell models mimic vitamin D metabolism found in vivo, we expected to observe the same metabolites found and in some cases tentatively identified by others(10.Kobayashi T. Tsugawa N.

In addition, our objective was to study the rate of OCT metabolism in various cell lines in order to gauge the involvement of vitamin D-inducible catabolic pathways as compared with more general metabolizing systems. Our results support the concept that OCT is subject to extensive metabolism in a variety of tissues that leads to side chain truncated forms excreted in the bile. 1α,25-(OH)D was a generous gift from Dr. M. Uskokovic of Hoffmann-LaRoche. OCT was synthesized by the method of Murayama et al.(7.Murayama E. Miyamoto K. Kubodera N. Mori T. Matsunaga I. Chem. & Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 1986; 34: 4410-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Putative metabolites of OCT, including 22,23, 24,25,26,27-hexanor-1α,20-(OH)D and 22,23,24,25,26,27-hexanor-20-oxo-1α-hydroxyvitamin D as well as 24- and 26-hydroxylated derivatives, were synthesized as recently described(16.Kubodera N. Watanabe H. Hatakeyama S. Tazumi K. Takano S. Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 1994; 4: 753-756Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). 25-OH-D and [23,24(n)-3H]25-OH-D (3.33 TBq/mmol) were obtained from Duphar Co. (Weesp, Holland) and Amersham Corp., respectively. Cell culture media and fine chemicals were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal calf serum was from Flow Laboratories (Costa Mesa, CA). Derivatizing agents and solvents were purchased as follows: sodium periodate (BDH Chemicals Ltd, Poole, UK); sodium borodeuteride (Merck, Sharp, & Dohme, Montreal, PQ, Canada); N-trimethylsilylimidazole (Pierce); and HPLC grade organic solvents (Caledon, Georgetown, ON, Canada). All other reagents were analytical reagent grade. The cell lines UMR106 and HepG2 were cultured as described previously(12.Strugnell S. Calverley M.J. Jones G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 13.Lohnes D. Jones G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14394-14401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immortalized (HPK1A) and transformed (HPK1A-ras) cell lines were established from normal human keratinocytes by stable transfection with human papilloma virus type 16 followed by transformation with the activated H-ras oncogene, respectively(14.Henderson J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12162-12167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HPK1A and HPK1A-ras cell lines were cultured as described previously(15.Masuda S. Strugnell S. Calverley M. Makin H.L.J. Kremer R. Jones G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4794-4803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As described previously(15.Masuda S. Strugnell S. Calverley M. Makin H.L.J. Kremer R. Jones G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4794-4803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 150-mm culture dishes containing monolayers (HPK1A, HPK1A-ras, UMR106, or HepG2) cultured to confluence in the presence of fetal calf serum were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin in the presence of 41.8 μg of OCT (10 μM) for 48 h at 37°C. Except in the time course experiments described below, cells were not treated with 1α,25-(OH)D to induce catabolic enzymes. No cell or dead cell controls consisted of 10 ml of medium or microwave-treated cells incubated with OCT under the same conditions for the same length of time. Medium and cells were removed for analysis of OCT metabolites, whereas representative plates of cells were used for determination of cell number using a model ZM automatic cell counter. In the time course study, HPK1A-ras cells were cultured to late log phase in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and treated with 10 nM 1α,25-(OH)D for 16 h in order to maximally induce catabolic enzymes from the beginning. Monolayers were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin in order to remove residual 1α,25-(OH)D, and then the medium was changed and the cells were incubated with 41.8 μg of OCT (10 μM) in 10 ml/dish Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. Lipid extraction was performed according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (18.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43405) Google Scholar) as modified by Makin et al.(19.Makin G. Lohnes D. Byford V. Ray R. Jones G. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The organic layer, containing unchanged OCT and lipid-soluble metabolites, was evaporated to dryness, and the residue redissolved in hexane/isopropanol/methanol (HIM), (91:7:2, v/v/v) for straight phase HPLC. Straight phase HPLC was carried out using a model 590 pump, a U6K manual injector, and a model 990 photodiode array detector (all from Waters Associates, Milford, MA). This scanning spectrophotometer was used during metabolite purification to identify peaks possessing UV characteristics of the vitamin D cis-triene system (UV = 265 nm, UV = 228 nm, UV = 1.75). Separations were achieved using Zorbax SIL (6.2 × 80 mm) or Zorbax CN (4.6 × 250 mm) columns (Dupont NEN). Mobile phases used for OCT metabolites included mixtures of HIM ranging from 91:7:2 to 94:5:1. Concentrations of stock solutions of OCT and its metabolites were assessed spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient, = 18,300. The lipid residue from the extraction of three 150-mm culture dishes containing HPK1A-ras (or HPK1A) cells was redissolved in 1.2 ml of HIM 91:7:2. Initial chromatography was performed on Zorbax SIL using HIM 91:7:2 at flow rate 1.0 ml/min. Six 200-μl aliquots of the extract were chromatographed, and peaks possessing the characteristic chromophore of vitamin D were collected and pooled. These fractions were subjected to further chromatography on Zorbax CN and Zorbax SIL. At this point, metabolites were pure enough for chemical derivatization and/or mass spectrometry. Periodate oxidation and borohydride reduction of metabolites of OCT were carried out according to published methods(13.Lohnes D. Jones G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14394-14401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Qaw F. Calverley M.J. Schroeder N.J. Trafford D.J.H. Makin H.L.J. Jones G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 282-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified metabolites were derivatized to pertrimethylsilyl ethers and then analyzed by GC-MS as described previously(20.Qaw F. Calverley M.J. Schroeder N.J. Trafford D.J.H. Makin H.L.J. Jones G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 282-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Injection of metabolites of OCT into the high temperature injection zone of the GC causes B ring closure producing pyro- and isopyroisomers. Mass spectra were obtained only from the pyroisomer, and, for simplicity, in discussion of fragmentation and in figures illustrating spectra obtained, the uncyclized metabolite structure is used rather than that of the correct pyroisomer. Mass spectra were obtained by averaging each peak and subtracting the background. The binding affinities of OCT and its metabolites for the calf thymus vitamin D receptor were tested using a 1α,25-(OH)D assay kit purchased from INCSTAR (Stillwater, MN). Calf thymus VDR was incubated at 20°C for 1 h with various concentrations of 1α,25-(OH)D (1.25-80 pg/tube), OCT (1.25-80 pg/tube), or its metabolites (2.5 pg/tube to 205 ng/tube). After the incubation period, 15,000 dpm of [3H]1α,25-(OH)D was added and incubated for 1 h at 20°C. Bound and free forms of [3H]1α,25-(OH)D were separated by addition of a dextran/charcoal suspension and centrifugation. Radioactivity was measured with an Aloka LSC-90. The binding affinities of OCT and its metabolites for the DBP were tested using plasma from a vitamin D-deficient rat. The displacement of [3H]25-OH-D from 1:70,000 diluted vitamin D-deficient rat plasma in 3.5 mM barbiturate buffer (pH 8.6) containing 0.13 M NaCl and 0.1% ovalbumin was measured following the addition of 25-OH-D (12.5 pg/tube −3.2 ng/tube), 1α,25-(OH)D (1.6-820 ng/tube), or OCT or its metabolites (51 ng/tube to 52.4 μg/tube) as described previously(21.Arnaud S.B. Meger J. Bikle D. Assay of Calcium Regulating Hormones. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1983: 65-83Google Scholar). After incubation for 1 h at 4°C, bound and free forms of [3H]25-OH-D were separated by the addition of a dextran/charcoal suspension and centrifugation. The supernatants containing bound [3H]25-OH-D were transferred into scintillation vials, and radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. Human promyelocytic leukemic cells (HL-60 cells) were kindly provided by Dr. M. Inaba (Osaka City University, Medical School). Cells were cultured at 37°C in RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical, Japan) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 60 μg/ml of kanamycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO in air. Under these conditions the doubling time of HL-60 cells was 24 h. Vitamin D treatment involved seeding HL-60 cells at 1 × 105 cells/ml in growth medium and culturing for 72 h in the presence of from 10M to 10M of 1α,25-(OH)D, OCT, or its metabolites, each dissolved in ethanol. Control cultures were treated with ethanol vehicle at 0.1% (v/v). After the incubation period, cells were harvested, and the cell number was determined using a hemocytometer. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. The number of cells counted from triplicate experiments was expressed as a percentage of the control. The results are expressed as the mean of triplicate counts ± standard error. In an attempt to establish the full extent of metabolism of OCT, we began our studies by incubating this analog with the cell line HPK1A-ras, previously shown to have very high catabolic activity toward 1α,25-(OH)D(15.Masuda S. Strugnell S. Calverley M. Makin H.L.J. Kremer R. Jones G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4794-4803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When we incubated 10 μM OCT for 48 h, we obtained extensive metabolism such that on HPLC seven metabolite peaks possessing the vitamin D chromophore were discernible. These are labeled peaks 1-7 in Fig. 1, where peak 3 is the substrate, OCT, and the rest are metabolic products. Little substrate was left at the end of the 48-h period, whereas no metabolites were formed in no cell or dead cell (microwave-treated) control plates incubated with OCT (Fig. 1A). All peaks 1-7 were purified by extensive rechromatography on Zorbax-CN and then again on Zorbax-SIL in order to identify them by GC-MS and chemical derivatization. In the case of peak 2, we made a sodium borodeuteride reduction product and an oxime as well as the pertrimethylsilylated derivative. In the case of peaks 4, 6, and 7, they were subjected to GC-MS as the pertrimethylsilylated derivatives or, in the case of peaks 6 and 7, as their n-butyl boronate ester/pertrimethylsilylated derivatives. We have summarized in Table 1 and detailed below the evidence that was obtained for the successful identification of the major metabolites. Peak 3 was identified as unchanged substrate. We obtained limited information regarding peaks 1 and 5, and these metabolites remain unidentified at this time.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab This peak ran at 10.72 min, slightly ahead of the substrate OCT (RT = 11.41 min) on Zorbax-SIL chromatography. Peak 2 was significantly retarded relative to OCT on Zorbax-CN chromatography (see Table 1), suggesting the presence of a C=O group in the molecule. The pertrimethylsilylated derivative of peak 2 showed a molecular ion at m/z 474 on GC-MS (Fig. 2A), suggesting truncation of the side chain between the 22-oxa-group and the C-23 and retention of the 22-oxa group as a 20-ketone functionality with the subsequent addition of only two TMS groups. The remainder of the mass spectrum with major ions at m/z 384(474 - 90), 343 (loss of a fragment containing carbons C-2,3,4), 294(474 - 90 - 90), and 217 (loss of a fragment containing carbons C-1,2,3) was consistent with this interpretation. Treatment of peak 2 with sodium borodeuteride gave two product peaks, one of which co-migrated with peak 4 (peak 2 (untreated) = 10.77 min; peak 2 treated with NaBD product 1 = 12.88 min and product 2 = 14.94 min; peak 4 (untreated) = 14.91 min using Zorbax-SIL, HIM, 91:7:2 1 ml/min). When the NaBD reduction product of peak 2 was further derivatized with N-trimethylsilylimidazole, the pertrimethylsilylated product gave a molecular ion of m/z 549 (Fig. 3B) corresponding to the addition of one deuterium atom to the original molecule and fragments at m/z 459(549 - 90), 418 (549 - 131 due to loss of a fragment containing carbons C-2,3,4), 369(549 - 90 - 90), and a base fragment of m/z 118 corresponding to cleavage of the C-17-C-20 bond. This spectrum is very similar to that of peak 4 and is consistent with the reduction of the 20-ketone to a mixture of monodeuterated 20-alcohols. Final proof of the identity of peak 2 as the 20-ketone came from formation of an oxime derivative. When the oxime was further derivatized with N-trimethylsilylimidazole, it gave a pertrimethylsilylated derivative with a molecular ion of m/z 503 (Fig. 2B). Major fragment at 413 (M-90), 382 (M-OCH-90), 370 (M-131 due to loss of a fragment containing carbons C-2,3,4), and 292 (M-OCH-90-90) are all consistent with a 20-oxime derivative. We conclude from HPLC, GC-MS, borohydride reduction, and oxime formation that peak 2 is the truncated 20-ketone. Peak 4 was more strongly retained than OCT at 14.91 min on Zorbax-SIL chromatography. Peak 4 co-migrated with synthetic hexanor-1α,20S-dihydroxyvitamin D on both Zorbax-SIL and Zorbax-CN. GC-MS of the pertrimethylsilylated derivative of peak 4 gave the mass spectrum shown in Fig. 3A and can be seen to be homologous to the monodeuterated peak 2 (Fig. 3B). Pertrimethylsilylated peak 4 possessed a molecular ion of m/z 548 corresponding to a C sterol with three TMSOH groups. The fragmentation pattern shows the expected features with m/z 458 (M - 90), 368 (M - 90 - 90), and 417 (M - 131 due to loss of a fragment containing carbons C-2,3,4), but in addition, a fragment at m/z 117 corresponding a C fragment from C-20 and C-21 bearing a TMS group. We conclude peak 4 is the truncated 20-alcohol derivative of OCT. This peak was the major product of all the cell types tested, and because all are known to be rich sources of 24-hydroxylase activity, it seemed logical that peak 6 would prove to be the 24-hydroxy derivative of OCT. A moderately polar peak on Zorbax-SIL, this peak was sensitive to sodium metaperiodate treatment, suggesting the presence of vicinal hydroxyl functions at C-24 and C-25. On GC-MS (Fig. 4A) the pertrimethylsilylated derivative of peak 6 possessed a molecular ion of m/z 722 with major fragments at 632 (M - 90) and 542 (M - 90 - 90) as well as m/z 591 (M - 131 due to loss of a fragment containing carbons C-2,3,4) and m/z 459, 369, and 279 found in the original substrate, suggesting no alteration of the ring structure. The base peak at m/z 131 is indicative of retention of the C-25 hydroxyl function intact. The n-butylboronate derivative of peak 6 was formed, again suggesting vicinal hydroxyls at C-24 and C-25. The pertrimethylsilylated n-butyl boronate of peak 6 gave the mass spectrum (Fig. 4B) with the predicted molecular ion of m/z 644 and a fragmentation pattern particularly m/z = 169 due to cleavage of the oxygen O-22-C-23 bond consistent with a 24-hydroxylated precursor. Finally, peak 6 was shown to co-chromatograph with chemically synthesized 24R-OH-OCT on HPLC. We conclude on the basis of extensive evidence that peak 6 is 24R-hydroxy-OCT. This peak was the most polar metabolite obtained with a retention time of 23.99 min on Zorbax-SIL and 16.73 min on Zorbax-CN (Table 1). Like peak 6, it proved to be sensitive to sodium metaperiodate, giving a product with a much reduced retention time (12.13 min versus OCT = 11.35 min). On GC-MS, the pertrimethylsilylated derivative of peak 7 gave a molecular ion of m/z 722, suggesting a monohydroxylated derivative of OCT. The mass spectrum (Fig. 5A) featured many of the same ions found in the spectrum of peak 6 except that there was a large fragment at m/z 103 (corresponding to loss of CHOTMS) instead of m/z 131 found in the case of 24-hydroxy-OCT. This fragment is indicative of a CHOTMS presumably vicinal to the existing C-25 hydroxy group at C-26 (C-27). On GC-MS, the periodate cleavage product of peak 7 gave no discernible molecular ion, but the fragmentation pattern featured large fragments at m/z 456 (M - 90) and 366 (M - 90 - 90) and m/z 415 (M - 131 due to loss of a fragment containing carbons C-2,3,4), data consistent with the molecular ion being extrapolated to be m/z 546 (Fig. 5C). This is consistent with a molecule truncated between C-25 and C-26 (C-27) and containing a C-25 ketone. Further confirmation of the peak 7 being a molecule with vicinal hydroxyls came from formation of an n-butylboronate derivative. As with peak 6 the pertrimethylsilylated version of this was subjected to GC-MS and gave a molecular ion of m/z 644 (Fig. 5B). In addition to the distinctive fragment at m/z 169 found with the n-butylboronate, pertrimethylsilylated derivative of 24-hydroxy-OCT, we observed a distinctive fragment at m/z 141 due to cleavage of the C-24-C-25 bond and loss of a fragment containing the C-25, C-26, and C-27 butylboronate ester group. Finally, peak 7 was shown to co-chromatograph with chemically synthesized (25R)-26-OH-OCT on HPLC. We conclude from these data that peak 7 must be (25R)-26-hydroxy-OCT. As a result of preliminary in vitro studies, both possible epimers of each biologically generated metabolite were synthesized chemically. Table 2 shows the results of HPLC co-migration studies of biological and chemically synthesized metabolites. In each case the epimeric mixture could be resolved on HPLC, and the biological product was found to be exclusively one epimer (that is peak 4 = 20S-epimer of the hexanor-1α,20-(OH)D, peak 6 = 24R-hydroxy OCT, and peak 7 = 25R-form of 26-hydroxy OCT). All chemically synthesized standard compounds were subjected to GC-MS for comparison to previously obtained mass spectra of biological products. Mass spectra (data not shown) were found to be virtually identical to those shown in Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and therefore corroborate the identifications provided.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Evidence from the time course suggests that at early time points the hexanor-1,20-(OH)D is present when there is no detectable hexanor-20-oxo-1α-OH-D (Fig. 6). All other metabolites accumulate at early time points, and their concentration plateaus or even decreases by the end of the incubation period (24 h). In these studies we examined the metabolism of OCT using established cell lines involved in both the activation and catabolism of vitamin D. With such cell lines it was found that OCT was metabolized to a smaller number of products, which comigrated with peaks 4, 6, and 7 obtained using HPK1A-ras (Fig. 7). Metabolites were subjected to the same rigorous identification used for those from HPK1A-ras. When we compared metabolism of OCT at the same time, under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 8), we confirmed that OCT had virtually disappeared at the end of the 48-h period in HPK1A-ras cells, whereas considerable amounts remained in plates containing UMR-106 and HPK1A cells. The major metabolite found in cell cultures of UMR-106 and HPK1A was the 24-hydroxy-OCT (peak 6), whereas the truncated metabolites, peaks 4 and 2, appeared to be more important as the degree of metabolism increased (e.g. in HPK1A-ras). These data are consistent with the scheme shown in Fig. 9 with monohydroxylated versions of OCT acting as intermediates to the truncated metabolites, peaks 4 and 2.Figure 9Proposed pathway of OCT metabolism in cultured vitamin D target cells in vitro.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The VDR binding affinities of the 26-hydroxy-OCT isomers (ED141 and ED142) or side chain truncated metabolites of OCT (ED26, ED190, and ED67) were much reduced compared with the parent molecule, OCT, which showed approximately the same binding affinity for the mammalian VDR as 1α,25-(OH)D (Fig. 10A). This was especially true of the side chain truncated metabolites of OCT, which showed a binding affinity 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than 1α,25-(OH)D. On the other hand, 24R-hydroxy-OCT (ED106) or 24-oxo-OCT (ED174) retained much of the VDR-binding affinity of OCT with values only - that of OCT, respectively. The measurements of the DBP-binding affinity (Fig. 10B) confirmed earlier observations (4.Okano T. Tsugawa N. Masuda S. Takeuchi A. Kobayashi T. Nishii Y. J. Nutr. Sci.

The most extensively studied Hb is that of the common North American earthworm Lumbricus terrestris. Although it has been the subject of numerous studies since Svedberg determined its mass by centrifugation in 1933, the molecular architecture of this complex of 180 polypeptide chains remains uncertain in the absence of a crystal structure. An early SDS-PAGE study showed that it consisted of at least six subunits(6.Shlom J.M. Vinogradov S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7904-7912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), four of which were globins, comprising a monomer subunit M (7.Vinogradov S.N. Shlom J.M. Hall B.C. Kapp O.H. Mizukami H.

Here we report the results of a study of the dissociation and reassembly of Lumbricus Hb, which support the role of the dodecamer of globin chains [3T+3M] as a principal intermediate in both processes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsL. terrestris Hb was prepared as described previously in 0.1 M Tris•Cl buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, from live worms collected around London, Ontario (Carolina Wholesale Bait Co., Canton, NC)(4.Vinogradov S.N.

Chem. 1973; 248: 7904-7912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of the Hb was determined from the absorbance of the native form at 280 nm or of the cyanmet form at 540 nm(4.Vinogradov S.N. Sharma P.K. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 231: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), employing the respective extinction coefficients, 2.063 ± 0.032 ml•mg•cm and 0.442 ± 0.013 ml•mg•cm(13.Martin P.D. Kuchumov A.R. Green B.R. Oliver R.W.A. Braswell E.H. Wall J.S. Vinogradov S.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 154-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The Gdm salts were purum grade from Fluka AG (9470 Buchs, Switzerland) and urea was from Sigma. The heteropolytungstate salts KSiW (K[SiWO].14HO, 3239.2 Da), NaSbW (Na[NaSbWO].24HO, 7178.4 Da) and AsW (Na[BaAsWO].60HO, 11,731.7 Da) were prepared according to Klemperer(14.Klemperer W.G. Inorganic Syntheses. 27. J. Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 71-132Google Scholar).Analytical Gel FiltrationLow pressure, isocratic gel filtration was carried out at room temperature (20 ± 2°C) employing an FPLC system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and 1 × 30-cm columns of Superose S12 or S6 (Pharmacia). Flow rate was 0.4 ml/min and the eluate was monitored at 280 nm. A constant amount of protein in a constant sample volume, 800 μg/200 μl, was loaded each time.Polyacrylamide Gel ElectrophoresisPolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 0.1% SDS was carried out using the buffer system of Laemmli (15.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205982) Google Scholar) and slab gels (1.5 mm × 10 cm × 8 cm) of 8-20% acrylamide. The gels were electrophoresed for 2-4 h, stained in 0.125% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 45% methanol, 7.5% acetic acid, and destained in 25% methanol, 7.5% acetic acid.Optical SpectrophotometryThe absorption spectra over the the 200-650 nm range were obtained using an OLIS (Bogart, GA) spectrophotometer employing a Hewlett Packard diode array detector or a Hitachi model 2000 spectrophotometer.Fitting of Elution ProfilesThe elution curves were either digitized on a Summagraphics Summasketch MM18 tablet using a Sigma Scan version 3.0 (Jandel Scientific, Corte Madera, CA) or acquired using the Easyest System 8 (Keithley Instruments, Inc., Rochester, NY) and an IBM PC/386 computer. The elution curve was then fitted as a sum of four EMGs, each representing the undissociated Hb (HBL) and peaks D, T+L, and M, employing least squares minimization (Peak Fit version 2.0, Jandel Scientific). The EMG function is a convolution of a gaussian and a decreasing exponential and is known to represent well the shape of chromatographic elution peaks(16.Said A.S. Theory and Mathematics of Chromatography. Hüttrig, Heidelberg1981: 69Google Scholar, 17.Jonsson J.A. Chromatographic Theory and Basic Principles.

The EMG is asymmetric with an exponential tail on the right side; the falloff rate of the tail is controlled by the parameter a. The areas of the individual peaks were plotted as percent of total versus time and fitted to sums of exponentials,f(t)=a1exp[-k1t]+a2exp[-k2t]+a3exp[-k3t](Eq. 2) using PSI-Plot software (Poly Software International, Salt Lake City, UT) employing the Marquardt-Levenburg method. The acceptability of fits was judged by the absence of systematic trends in the plot of residuals with time.Dissociation of Lumbricus OxyHbThe dissociating agent was dissolved in 0.1 M Tris•HCl buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, and Hb stock solution added to obtain the desired concentration, 3.6 mg/ml. The following dissociating agents were employed: urea, Gdm•SCN, Gdm•Cl, Gdm•OAc, SiW, SbW, and AsW. The dissociations of oxyHb at neutral pH and at pH 8.0 and 8.2 in 0.1 M Tris•Cl buffer, 1 mM EDTA, were followed by FPLC at neutral pH.Oxidation of Lumbricus HbThe oxidation of Lumbricus oxyHb was effected by the addition of potassium ferricyanide (Fisher) or of sodium nitrite (Aldrich) at molar ratios relative to heme, ranging from 1 to 1000, in 0.1 M Tris•Cl buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA. The conversion of oxyHb to metHb was monitored using optical spectrophotometry over the 450-650 nm range and was complete in 5-20 min. The metHb solution was then immediately passed over a 1.5 × 20-cm Sephadex G-25 column to remove the oxidizing agent, and the progress of the dissociation measured using FPLC at neutral pH.Reassembly of HBL Structure from Completely Dissociated OxyHbLumbricus Hb (30-60 mg/ml) was dissociated in the presence of 4-8 M urea in 0.1 M Tris•Cl buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA at room temperature. The completeness of the dissociation to T+L+M was checked by FPLC, urea was removed by dialysis against 2 × 1.5 liters of Tris•Cl buffer for 2 h and the reassociation followed by FPLC in the presence of Group IIA cations Mg, Ca, and Sr over the 0-50 mM range; the solutions were kept at 7°C. Alternatively, the T+L+M fractions were obtained by preparative gel filtration of oxyHb exposed to 4 M urea, pooled, concentrated by pressure filtration using Centricon 10 concentrators (Amicon Division, W. R. Grace & Co., Danvers, MA), and its reassociation followed in the absence and presence of Ca.STEM Imaging and Mass Measurement of Unstained ProteinThe mass measurements were performed using the STEM at the Brookhaven National Laboratory(19.Wall J.S. Hainfeld J.F. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 355-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Preparation of the unstained specimens with TMV fibers as internal mass standards was carried out as described by Kapp et al.(20.Kapp O.H. Qabar A.N. Bonner M.C. Stern M.S. Walz D.A. Schmuck M. Pilz I. Wall J.S. Vinogradov S.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Negative staining was with 0.5% (w/w) uranyl acetate. The STEM was operated at 40 kev, a dose level <10 e/0.1 nm2 and a resolution of 0.25 nm. An interactive program (19.Wall J.S. Hainfeld J.F. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 355-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) was used to select the electron micrographs on the basis of clean background and apparent quality of TMV fibers and protein particles; it computes the background and permits the operator to select the TMV segments for internal mass calibration and the particles for mass measurement. At least 3-5 good TMV segments are generally chosen to calculate the internal mass calibration. The individual particles are selected based on clean background around the particles and absence of visible flaws.RESULTSDissociation of OxyHb by Urea and Guanidinium Salts Elution Profile of the Dissociation ProductsFig. 1A shows a typical FPLC elution profile of oxyHb dissociated at neutral pH in the presence of 1.5m Gdm•Cl. In addition to the undissociated Hb (HBL), three peaks are observed, D, T+L, and M, at elution volumes corresponding to approximately 200, 60, and 25 kDa. The unreduced SDS-PAGE (inset) shows that the subunit content of undissociated Hb is similar to the native Hb, peak D consists of subunits T (54.5 kDa; chains a+b+c) and M (16.6 kDa, chain d), peak T+L is the envelope of unresolved peaks due to subunit T and the four linker subunits L (L1-L4: 24.1, 24.9, 27.6, and 32.1 kDa), and peak M is the monomer (the masses provided here are from a recent mass spectrometric study of the Hb; (13.Martin P.D.

The elution volumes of the four peaks remained unchanged throughout the course of the dissociation to ±3%, as did the fitted variables a (peak position). Fig. 2B shows a similar fit of an elution curve obtained following reassociation of T+L+M in 10 mM Ca.Figure 2EMG fits to the elution profiles at 280 nm obtained by FPLC. A, dissociation of oxyHb in 1.22 m Gdm•Cl after 28 h; B, reassociation of completely dissociated oxyHb in 10 mM Ca after 48 h. In A, the buffer also contained 1 mM EDTA. The differences in the elution volumes for the same subunits is due to the use of different columns.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Dissociation of OxyHb at Zero TimeIn these experiments, the oxyHb was loaded on the column right after mixing with the dissociating agent and subjected to FPLC. The time elapsed between mixing and complete penetration of the sample into the column was 110-120 s. Plots of percent dissociation versus the concentration of the dissociating agent are shown in Fig. 3A.Figure 3Zero time dissociation of Lumbricus oxyHb. A, percent undissociated oxyHb versus concentration of Gdm•SCN, Gdm•Cl, urea, and Gdm•OAc. B, percent undissociated oxyHb (HBL) and peaks D, T+L, and M versus concentration of Gdm•SCN and Gdm•OAc.

The relative proportion of the dodecamer D is much less in Gdm•SCN than in Gdm•OAc, the weakest dissociating agent.Time Course of OxyHb Dissociation in 4 M Urea and the Effect of CaFig. 4A shows the time course of oxyHb dissociation in 4 M urea; although it is almost complete within 2 h, peak D remains constant indicating its stability in 4 M urea. Fig. 4B shows the time course of oxyHb dissociation in 4 M urea in 2.5 mM Ca; it can be fitted as the sum of two exponentials. However, since substantial dissociation occurs within the dead time of the FPLC method (2 min), there appear to be at least three separate dissociation processes with apparent t≈≤1 min, 1 h, and 50 h. Fig. 4C illustrates the effect of [Ca] on the dissociation of oxyHb in 4 M urea after 144 h.Figure 4Time course of Lumbricus oxyHb dissociation in 0.1 M Tris•Cl buffer, pH 7.0.

Again, it is evident that a third, rapid phase occurs within the dead time of the FPLC (2 min). Thus, there appear to be three dissociation processes with t≈≤1 min, 2-22 h, and 50-1200 h.An early observation by Ascoli et al.(23.Ascoli F. Rossi Fanelli M.R. Chiancone E. Vecchini P. Antonini E. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 119: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) suggested that oxidation of earthworm Hb led to the dissociation of its quaternary structure. We reinvestigated this phenomenon because Lumbricus oxyHb was slowly altered to the met form during the dissociations in urea and Gdm•Cl. Fig. 8(E and F) shows the time courses of dissociation following the conversion of oxyHb to metHb and the removal of oxidant by gel filtration.The fitted parameters for all the dissociations are provided in Table 1.Reassembly of HBL StructureFig. 9 shows some representative results obtained with the reassembly of HBL structures from completely dissociated oxyHb. In the absence of Group IIA cations, reassembly of was limited, generally much less than 10%. However, in the first 24 h, there is a spontaneous formation of dodecamer as illustrated in Fig. 9A. The same result is also observed in Fig. 9B, which depicts the time course of reassembly to HBL in 5 mM Mg. Fig. 9C illustrates the effect of cation concentration on the extent of HBL reassembly, and Fig. 9D shows that although there may be differences in the extent of reassembly achieved initially, the final [HBL] is remarkably similar for all three cations after 200 h.Figure 9Reassembly of HBL structure following complete dissociation of Lumbricus oxyHb (absence of HBL) in 8 M urea in 0.1 M Tris•Cl buffer, pH 7, in the absence and presence of group IIA cations.

Fig. 10 also shows the reassembly time courses in 2.5 mM and 10 mM Ca; although the relative contents of T and M declined steadily, the level of peak D remained fairly constant at 10-15%. STEM images of unstained HBL[T+L+M] are indistinguishable from those of native Hb, and the mass distributions are similar to those determined for native Hb(13.Martin P.D. Kuchumov A.R. Green B.R.

The time courses of HBL reassembly could be fitted reasonably well with a single asymptotic exponential.Figure 10Time course of reassembly of HBL structure in 0.1 M Tris•Cl buffer, pH 7, in 2.5 mM Ca (circles) and 10 mM Ca (squares).

In particular, dissociation in the weakest dissociating agent, namely Gdm•OAc (Fig. 3), shows that D accounts for about half of the initial dissociation products. The time course of dissociation in 4 M urea (Fig. 4A) also shows that D accounts for 40-50% of the dissociation products. In addition, it appears that D is fairly stable in the presence of 4 M urea, in agreement with earlier findings(24.Vinogradov S.N. Sharma P.K. Qabar A.N. Wall J.S. Westrick J.A. Simmons J.H. Gill S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13091-13096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 3 summarizes the effect of urea and several Gdm salts on the dissociation of Lumbricus oxyHb determined by FPLC at zero time. The order of decreasing effectiveness is Gdm•SCN > Gdm•Cl > urea > Gdm•OAc, with the order of the anions in line with the well known Hoffmeister series(25.Von Hippel P.H. Schleich T. Timasheff S.N. Fasman G.D. Structure and Stability of Biological Macromolecules. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1969: 417-574Google Scholar, 26.Collins K.D. Washabaugh M.W. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1986; 18: 323-422Crossref Scopus (1404) Google Scholar).The order of increasing effectiveness of the three heteropolytungstates, SiW < SbW < AsW, appears to be correlated with their total charge and mass, −8 (3239 Da), −18 (7178 Da), and −27 (11,732 Da), respectively, and not with the surface charge density. Although SiW is spherical, SbW is a trigonal pyramid, and AsW is a parallelliped, the charge per unit area is approximately the same: −1.8, −2.0, and −2.1/100 Å2, respectively(27.Hervé M. Hervé G.

Chim. 1983; 7: 515-519Google Scholar).Effect of Ca on Urea Dissociation of OxyHbCa exerts a markedly protective effect on the quaternary structure of oxyHb in the presence of 4 M urea (Fig. 4). Although dissociation is almost complete (95%) after 2 h in 4 M urea (Fig. 4A), even 2.5 mM Ca reduces dissociation to 75% after 144 h in 4 M urea (Fig. 4B). The maximum protective effect is reached at [Ca] ≈ 10 mM (Fig. 4C). Alkaline e"

Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar). This family includes the TNF, LT-α, LT-β, Fas, CD27, CD30, CD40, OX-40, 4-1BB, and NGF systems. TNF and LT-α were the first members of this family to be defined, and because they exhibited similar biological activity and receptor binding properties, LT-α was originally believed to be functionally identical to TNF. Surprisingly, biochemical characterization of a surface form of LT-α showed that it was a complex of two proteins(3.Browning J.L. Androlewicz M.J. Ware C.F. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1230-1237PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Androlewicz M.J. Browning J.L. Ware C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2542-2547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surface LT-α is distinguished from surface TNF because LT-α does not retain the transmembrane region but rather is tethered to the surface via complexation with a related gene called LT-β(5.Browning J.L. Ngam-ek A. Lawton P. DeMarinis J. Tizard R. Chow E.P. Hession C. O'Brine-Greco B. Foley S.F. Ware C.F. Cell. 1993; 72: 847-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 6.Ware C.F. Crowe P.D. Grayson M.H. Androlewicz M.J. Browning J.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3881-3888PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to differences in expression patterns, this observation was one of the first indications that a separate biological role for LT may exist(7.Ware C.F. VanArsdale T.L. Crowe P.D. Browning J.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 198: 175-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). A separate receptor specifically recognizing surface LT was identified validating the hypothesis that the LT system was not simply a redundant aspect of TNF function(8.Crowe P.D. VanArsdale T.L.

Furthermore, disruption of the LT-α gene in mice leads to loss of lymph node development further reinforcing the concept of unique biological functions for the LT pathway distinct from those of TNF(9.De Togni P.

Each of the ligands in the TNF family has now been shown to possess a corresponding unique receptor. The TNF system is complex because there are two receptors, i.e. the 55-60- and 75-80-kDa forms (referred to here as the TNF-R55 and TNF-R75 but also called TNF-R1 and TNF-R2, respectively) recognizing both LT-α and TNF(11.Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 317-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). The interactions of these receptors has been studied and both TNF-Rs can bind to a minor form of surface LT that has an apparent LT-α2/β1 composition(8.Crowe P.D. VanArsdale T.L. Walter B.N. Ware C.F. Hession C. Ehrenfels B. Browning J.L. Din W.S. Goodwin R.G. Smith C.A. Science. 1994; 264: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The primary surface LT form, which is expected to be LT-α1/β2, binds to a new receptor termed the LT-β receptor (LT-β-R)(8.Crowe P.D. VanArsdale T.L. Walter B.N. Ware C.F. Hession C. Ehrenfels B. Browning J.L. Din W.S. Goodwin R.G. Smith C.A. Science. 1994; 264: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The LT-β-R is structurally related to both the TNF-R55 and TNF-R75 yet does not recognize either soluble LT-α or TNF. Signalling in this family is believed to occur when the trivalent ligand is able to bring together two or more receptors. The oligomerization of receptor extracellular domains presumably alters the arrangement of the intracellular domains, which is in turn translated into some further signal(12.Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). The major question that becomes apparent upon consideration of the LT system is how does receptor signal transduction occur? In the case of LT-α1/β2 on a cell surface, the three receptor binding clefts are not equivalent and therefore the delineation of which receptors bind to which clefts will help to explain how signaling can occur. A precise characterization of the LT ligand forms would form the basis for such studies. Recently, the size of TNF family of receptors and ligands has increased dramatically leading to an enhanced appreciation of the complexity of the control mechanisms governing the immune system. The types of communication occurring between cells in this system have been reasonably defined in the TNF, CD40, and Fas signaling systems. Understanding of the function of CD40 and Fas was aided by the linkage of these molecules to the profound phenotypes accompanying the lpr mouse in the Fas case (13.Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (3980) Google Scholar) and the hyper IgM globulinemia associated with CD40 ligand defects in humans(14.Banchereau J. Bazan F. Blanchard D. Briere F. Galizzi J.P. van Kooten C. Liu Y.J. Rousset F. Saeland S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 881-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TNF, on the other hand, benefitted from its natural existence as a soluble mediator and the ready availability of a recombinant form. We have taken the approach of converting the surface LT heteromeric complexes into a TNF-like secreted form. The generation of the surface LT complexes in soluble forms has allowed us to examine several key facets of this unusual structure. First, the LT-α and LT-β stoichiometry in the soluble complexes could be unambiguously determined. Next we were able to assess the stability of the trimers and ascertain whether scrambling could occur. Such interconversions would vastly complicate any biological studies performed using the soluble molecules as mimics of the surface forms. The receptor binding properties of these ligands will be analyzed in a subsequent paper. 2J. L. Browning, manuscript in preparation. The baculovirus constructs encoding for LT-α and a truncated version of LT-β with a 10-amino acid myc tag have been described(8.Crowe P.D. VanArsdale T.L. Walter B.N. Ware C.F. Hession C. Ehrenfels B. Browning J.L. Din W.S. Goodwin R.G. Smith C.A. Science. 1994; 264: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). An altered form of LT-β that retained the extracellular domain and the VCAM-1 leader sequence yet lacked the myc tag was prepared by ligating the VCAM-1 signal sequence to a polymerase chain reaction product of LT-β. A NotI blunt end fragment of the signal sequence was obtained as described (8.Crowe P.D. VanArsdale T.L. Walter B.N. Ware C.F. Hession C. Ehrenfels B. Browning J.L. Din W.S. Goodwin R.G. Smith C.A. Science. 1994; 264: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The LT-β fragment was produced by polymerase chain reaction amplification off the cDNA with the primers 5′GACCCCGGGGCACAGGCCCAG-3′ and 5′-CAGTGCGGCCGCTCACGCACTCGCACCAC-3′ using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.75, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM (NH)SO, 2 mM MgSO, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% MeSO, and 0.2 mM dNTPs for 25 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 63°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 2 min with a 5-min extension at 72°C. The polymerase chain reaction product was gel purified, cut with NotI, and ligated to the VCAM-1 signal sequence and NotI-linearized BlueBacIII. The NotI mutant of BlueBacIII (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) was a gift from E. Garber (Biogen). Recombinant virus were produced and purified as described previously(8.Crowe P.D. VanArsdale T.L.

To create a mutated version of LT-α in which Asp was replaced by Asn, a NotI fragment containing the entire human LT-α gene (5.Browning J.L. Ngam-ek A. Lawton P. DeMarinis J. Tizard R. Chow E.P.

Unique site elimination mutagenesis (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was used to alter the Asp codon, GAC, to AAC (Asn). Plasmids containing the mutation were screened for the loss of a RsrII site and then confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The entire NotI fragment was sequenced to ensure that extraneous mutations were not introduced during the new strand synthesis reaction. For expression of the mutant protein in insect cells, the gel purified NotI fragment was ligated into NotI linearized, dephosphorylated BlueBacIII. Recombinant virus were produced and plaque purified as described by Invitrogen. For homo- or heterotrimer production, the LTα D50N virus was used to infect High Five(™) (Invitrogen) cells alone or in combination with the VCAM/c-myc-tagged wild type LT-β virus. LT-β-R (LTβ-R-Fc) and TNF-R55 (TNF-R55-Fc) immunoglobulin chimeras were constructed as described previously(15.Browning J.L. Dougas I. Ngam E.A. Bourdon P.R. Ehrenfels B.N. Miatkowski K. Zafari M. Yampaglia A.M. Lawton P. Meier W. Benjamin C.P. Hession C. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 33-46PubMed Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing either LTβ-R-Fc or TNF-R55-Fc were grown in suspension for 10-14 days in a Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12-based medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml bovine insulin, 10 μg/ml bovine transferrin, and 0.1% F-68 shear protectant (Life Technologies, Inc.). At harvest, sodium azide was added to a final concentration of 0.05%, and the conditioned medium was clarified by sequential dead end filtration using a 5-micron followed by a 0.3-micron Polygard filter cartridges (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The filtrated medium was concentrated by ultrafiltration using a S10Y30 spiral cartridge system (Amicon, Danvers, MA) and stored at −20°C. The receptor-Fc chimeras were purified by Protein A affinity chromatography (POROS A column, PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). To prepare LT-β-R-Fc and TNF-R55-Fc affinity resins, both preparations were immobilized on cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) overnight in 0.1 M sodium borate, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 8.5, at a final concentration of 5 mg of receptor-Fc/ml of resin. After blocking any underivatized sites with 100 mM ethanolamine, pH 8.0, for 1 h, the receptor affinity resins were washed with 25 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, pH 2.8 (elution buffer) prior to use and stored in 20 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.0 (PBS), supplemented with 0.02% sodium azide. To prepare LT-α/β heteromers, High Five(™) (Invitrogen) insect cells were grown to late log phase in a bioreactor controlled for oxygen containing 10 liters of sf900II medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 28°C. The cells were infected at a density of 2.2 × 106 cells/ml with two different recombinant baculovirus preparations coding for LT-α and LT-β at a multiplicity of infection of 2 and 7, respectively. Fresh sf900II medium (1.5 liters) was added at the time of infection, and the culture was harvested 49 h post infection. Cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation. A protease inhibitor mixture containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and EDTA were added to the supernatant at a final concentration of 0.15 mM and 1 mM, respectively, prior to filtration using a 10-inch 5-micron followed by a 10-inch 0.3-micron spiral Polygard cartridge filter (Millipore). The clarified insect cell supernatant containing LT-α/β was concentrated 10-fold by ultrafiltration using three S1Y10 spiral membrane cartridges (Amicon) connected in series. The concentrate was stored frozen at −70°C. To prepare LT-α3, sf9 insect cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) were grown in the bioreactor to late log phase in 9 liters sf900II culture medium. The cells were infected with baculovirus coding for LT-α at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 5. The culture was harvested 48 h post infection and processed as described for the LT-α/β co-infected culture. To purify the LT-α/β heteromers contained in the insect cell conditioned medium, the concentrate was loaded onto a TNF-R55-Fc affinity column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The flow-through material was stored at 4°C, and the column was sequentially washed with 5 column volumes of PBS, 5 column volumes of PBS supplemented with 500 mM NaCl, and again with 5 column volumes of PBS. The bound material was eluted with elution buffer into fractions containing a 5% final volume of 500 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.6 (neutralization buffer). To ensure that all the free LT-α was removed, the flow-through material from the first TNF-R55-Fc column was reloaded onto a second TNF-R55-Fc column, and the flow-through was again collected. The elution fractions from the two TNF-R55-Fc column runs that contained LT-α3 and LT-α2/β1 were identified by UV absorbance and pooled. To obtain pure LT-α2/β1, the combined TNF-R55-Fc elution pools were immediately loaded onto a LT-β-R-Fc affinity column equilibrated in PBS at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was washed and eluted as described for the TNF-R55-Fc affinity column. To obtain pure LT-α1/β2, the flow-through from the second TNF-R55-Fc column was loaded onto a LT-β-R-Fc affinity column at a flow rate of approximately 0.5 ml/min. The column was washed as described for the TNF-R55-Fc column and eluted with the elution buffer at pH 3.5 instead of pH 2.8. To obtain pure LT-α3 trimers, the concentrate from the insect cell culture infected with the LT-α virus only was purified using a TNF-R55-Fc affinity column. The bound proteins were washed as described earlier, and the column was eluted with elution buffer at pH 3.5 into tubes containing 5% neutralization buffer. For all affinity purifications, the fractions containing protein were identified by UV absorbance, pooled, and analyzed on 10-20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels (Daiichi, distributed by Integrated Separation Systems, MA). The purified LT preparations were stored in portions at −70°C. Human D50N mutated LT-α1/β2 and LT-α2/β1 were purified using LT-β-R-Fc affinity followed by cation exchange chromatography. The two heterotrimers were isolated from clarified culture supernatant on a LT-β-R-Fc Sepharose column essentially as described for the wild type LT trimers and were eluted with elution buffer at pH 2.8 and immediately neutralized. To separate D50N mutated LT-α1/β2 from LT-α2/β1 contained in the LT-β-R-Fc Sepharose elution pool, the sample was diluted with two volumes of buffer A (see below) and chromatographed on a carboxymethyl column as described below under “Analytical Methods.” The affinity purified LT trimers were diluted 1:2 with 16.66 μM HEPES, 16.66 μM MES, 16.66 μM sodium acetate, pH 6.5 (buffer A), and loaded onto a carboxymethyl column (POROS, 4.6 × 100 mm, PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equilibrated with buffer A. The bound protein in each of the runs was washed with buffer A and eluted with a linear 20 column volume gradient from 0 to 1.0 M NaCl in buffer A at a flow rate of 5.0 ml/min. The effluent was monitored for absorbance at 280 nm, and the elution profiles for all LT preparations were compared. The LT preparations were loaded onto a 7.8 × 300-mm TSK G3000SWXL column (TosoHaas, Montgomeryville, PA) equilibrated in PBS at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with PBS. The column effluent was monitored for absorbance at 280 nm. To calibrate the column, gel filtration standard (Bio-Rad) was also run using identical conditions. Gel filtration of the crude culture supernatant from insect cells infected with baculovirus coding for LT-β only was carried out on a fast protein liquid chromatography Superose-6 column (Pharmacia). The column was developed in PBS at a flow rate of 20 ml/h at ambient temperature. The samples were diluted with an equal volume of 8 M guanidine HCl, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and loaded onto a C4 reversed phase HPLC column (Vydac 2.1 × 250 mm, Hesperia, CA) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Bound proteins were washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-75% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 30 min at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. The effluent was monitored for absorbance at 280 nm. The eluted fractions were collected in SDS to obtain a final concentration of 0.1% SDS in the fraction and dried under vacuum in a speedvac. Selected fractions corresponding to the absorbance peaks were resuspended in 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercapto ethanol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, 80 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and characterized by 10-20% gradient SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Portions (50 μl) of crude culture supernatant or selected gel filtration fractions were applied under vacuum to a nitrocellulose filter (0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schuell) mounted in a 96-well dot blot chamber. The loaded filter was removed from the dot blot chamber, blocked with 0.3% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (block buffer) for 45 min at ambient temperature. To detect bound myc-tagged LT-β, the filter was incubated for 1 h at ambient temperature in a solution containing the c-myc-specific mAb 9E10 diluted 1:2000 in block buffer. After washing with block buffer, the bound 9E10 mAb was reacted with goat anti-mouse conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:40,000 in block buffer. The filter was washed again with block buffer and developed with the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Corp.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Microtiter plates (96 well, Immulon-II, Costar) coated with 50 μl/well of anti-human Fc antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1 μg/ml were blocked for 1 h with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween (blocking buffer). An aliquot (50 μl) of TNF-R55-Fc or LT-β-R-Fc at 1 μg/ml in blocking buffer was added to each well and left to incubate for 2 h at ambient temperature. The wells were washed 6 times with 300 μl of PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS/T-20). Samples containing LT-α3, LT-α2/β1, and LT-α1/β2 were diluted to cover a range of six logs (10 pg/ml to 10 μg/ml) in blocking buffer, added to the wells, and incubated for 60 min at ambient temperature. The wells were washed 6 times with 300 μl of PBS/T-20. 50 μl of the mouse anti-human LT-α antibody AG9 (15.Browning J.L. Dougas I. Ngam E.A. Bourdon P.R. Ehrenfels B.N. Miatkowski K. Zafari M. Yampaglia A.M. Lawton P. Meier W. Benjamin C.P. Hession C. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 33-46PubMed Google Scholar) at 2.3 μg/ml were added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at ambient temperature. The wells were washed with blocking buffer and then treated with 50 μl of horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse heavy and light chain (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) diluted 1: 50,000 in blocking buffer. Peroxidase activity was determined by incubation with the chromogenic substrate tetramethylbenzidine (420 μM final, IC Biochemicals, Costa Mesa, CA) followed by absorbance measurement at 450 nm. LT-α3-like activity was measured with either a 3-day anti-proliferative assay or a 1-day cytotoxicity assay in the presence of 10 μg/ml cycloheximide using the TNF-sensitive murine WEHI 164 (clone 13) cell line. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% Hyclone defined fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.5. In the anti-proliferative assay, 3000 cells were plated in each well of a 96-well plate along with various dilutions of cytokines as described(16.Browning J. Ribolini A. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1859-1867PubMed Google Scholar). After 3 days, growth was assessed by the addition of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), the formazan generated was solubilized by the addition of 0.1 ml of 10% SDS in 0.01 N HCl, and the absorbance was determined after 24 h at 37°C. In the cytotoxicity assay, cells were preplated 1 day prior to the assay at 10,000 cells/well in 0.1 ml. The next day 0.05 ml was removed and replaced with the cytokine plus 10 μg/ml cycloheximide. One day later, the viable cell mass was quantitated with MTT. To prepare a soluble form of the heteromeric LT-α/LT-β complex, the small intracellular N-terminal domain and the transmembrane spanning region of human LT-β were removed and replaced with the leader sequence of VCAM. Cleavage of the VCAM leader was expected to result in secretion of the LT-β extracellular domain. To facilitate detection, a 10-amino acid peptide tag, which is recognized by the mAb 9E10 was also added between the VCAM leader and the beginning of the extracellular receptor binding domain (Fig. 1). A second form of LT-β was prepared with the same leader; however, the myc peptide tag was removed and substituted with an additional 10 amino acids from LT-β. This form is referred to as soluble myc-less LT-β. To express soluble LT-α/β complexes, High Five(™) insect cells were infected in late log phase with a mixture of two baculovirus stocks coding for LT-α and LT-β, respectively. Kinetic analysis of insect cell supernatant by Western blotting revealed maximal expression of both LT forms at about 60 h post infection. However, degradation products of LT-β in the culture medium could be detected as early as 25 h post infection. In contrast, LT-α appeared to be stable in the culture supernatant well after peak expression was reached (data not shown). To avoid excessive degradation of LT-β during the production phase, all subsequent cultures were harvested between 40 and 50 h post infection. The cells were immediately removed by centrifugation, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and EDTA were added as protease inhibitors prior to ultrafiltration, and the concentrate was stored frozen at −70°C. Although LT-α expressed in bacteria or Chinese hamster ovary cells has been well-characterized, we wished to prepare LT-α from insect cells for comparison to the insect cell-derived heteromeric LT forms. Pure LT-α was readily obtained by TNF-R55-Fc affinity column purification in high yields as described(17.Crowe P.D. VanArsdale T.L. Walter B.N. Dahms K.M. Ware C.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 168: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Likewise, we wished to obtain pure LT-β3 via a similar route. LT-β prepared by insect cell expression and purification over an anti-LT-β B27 mAb affinity column (15.Browning J.L. Dougas I. Ngam E.A. Bourdon P.R. Ehrenfels B.N. Miatkowski K. Zafari M. Yampaglia A.M. Lawton P. Meier W. Benjamin C.P. Hession C. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 33-46PubMed Google Scholar) was found to be highly aggregated, and the majority of the preparation did not enter a nonreducing SDS-PAGE gel. To determine if the LT-β was aggregated in the cell supernatant prior to purification, the conditioned medium was sized by gel exclusion chromatography, and the fractions were analyzed by a dot blot/Western analysis (Fig. 2). Essentially all of the LT-β eluted in a size range greater than 200 kDa, and it was concluded that LT-β was highly aggregated. Attempts to obtain pure LT-β by elution from a LT-β-R-Fc affinity column were unsuccessful. Therefore, LT-β is expressed at reasonable levels in insect cells, and it appears to immediately form large aggregates that either lack good receptor binding sites or cannot be eluted from an affinity column. By analogy with other members of the TNF family, LT-α/β heteromeric forms were expected to be trimers. Therefore, LT-α and LT-β co-infection of insect cells could theoretically produce LT-α3, LT-α2/β1, LT-α1/β2, and LT-β3 forms, and the separation of these related LT complexes presented an interesting challenge. Initially, we explored affinity chromatography using immobilized mAbs specific for LT-β and LT-α. However, the affinity of the LT-β specific mAbs was high, and it was difficult to eluate bound material from the resin without destroying the column. Attempts to take advantage of the “FACS dull” and “FACS bright” groups of mAbs specific for LT-α (15.Browning J.L. Dougas I. Ngam E.A. Bourdon P.R. Ehrenfels B.N. Miatkowski K. Zafari M. Yampaglia A.M. Lawton P. Meier W. Benjamin C.P. Hession C. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 33-46PubMed Google Scholar) as an affinity purification strategy for LT-α1/β2 were equally unsuccessful. Thus, we abandoned mAb-based affinity columns for purification purposes. Receptor-based affinity columns provided an alternate method that exploited the expected specificity of the TNF-R55 for LT forms containing a LT-α/LT-α cleft, i.e. LT-α3 and LT-α2/β1 and the specificity of the LT-β-R for LT forms containing LT-β/LT-β or LT-α/LT-β clefts, i.e. LT-α1/β2 and LT-α2/β1. Shown in Fig. 3A is a schematic diagram of the purification strategy that yielded essentially pure LT-"

In order to form a transmembrane channel, the protein has to undergo oligomerization and membrane insertion. Previous studies have shown that channel formation is favored by acidic pH. We have analyzed the effect of pH on the kinetics of channel formation as well as on the conformation of the toxin. Using a variety of spectroscopic probes for protein structure, we have shown that α-toxin unfolded upon acidification and that the unfolding process occurred in at least three steps. The various steps could be selectively affected by modifying the salt concentration or the temperature. This unfolding was, however, only partial as the secondary structure remained native-like as witnessed by far UV CD measurements. The first unfolding step, corresponding to a region of the C-terminal half of the toxin, is of particular importance as it coincided with the exposure of hydrophobic patches on the surface of the protein as well as with the onset of channel formation. Our observations strongly suggest that transition of the C-terminal half of α-toxin to a molten globule-like state is required for channel formation.

Our observations strongly suggest that transition of the C-terminal half of α-toxin to a molten globule-like state is required for channel formation. α-Toxin is a 33-kDa protein secreted by most Staphylococcus aureus strains and is thought to be largely responsible for the pathogenesis of this bacterium in mammals (for review, see (1.Thelestam M. Blomqvist L. Toxicon. 1988; 26: 51-65Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and (2.Bhakdi S. Tranum-Jensen J. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 733-751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The toxin has been shown to irreversibly damage the membranes of a great variety of cells including erythrocytes from different species(3.McCartney C. Arbuthnott J. Wadstr ö m T. Jeljaszewicz J. Bacterial Toxins and Cell Membranes. Academic Press Inc., London1978: 89-127Google Scholar), human platelets, endothelial cells, and mouse adrenocortical Y1 cells. α-Toxin is secreted as a soluble monomeric polypeptide that can bind to yet unidentified receptors on the surface of sensitive cells(2.Bhakdi S.

Lateral diffusion of membrane-bound monomers leads to the formation of non-lytic heptameric pore precursors that are thought to undergo a second conformational change in order to form the functional transmembrane channel(5.Tobkes N. Wallace B.A. Bayley H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6.Gouaux J.E. Braha O. Hobaugh M.H. Song L. Cheley S. Shustak C. Bayley H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12828-12831Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Since no crystal structure of α-toxin has yet been obtained, the available structural information is derived from biochemical and biophysical studies. The protein is mainly composed of β-sheet as shown by circular dichroism (5.Tobkes N. Wallace B.A. Bayley H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 7.Ikigai H. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and is in agreement with secondary structure predictions(8.Menestrina G. Belmonte G. Parisi V. Morante S. FEMS Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 105: 19-28Google Scholar). Conformational analysis by limited proteolysis has suggested that the α-toxin monomer is composed of two domains, corresponding roughly to the two halves of the protein, separated by a protease-sensitive, glycine-rich loop(5.Tobkes N. Wallace B.A. Bayley H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 9.Blomqvist L. Bergman T. Thelestam M. Jörnvall H.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5285-5292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who have shown, by in vitro fragment complementation experiments, that cotranslation of the N- and C-terminal halves of the toxin leads to a product with significant hemolytic activity. Very little is known about the mechanism by which α-toxin inserts into a membrane. It has been shown that insertion requires proper oligomerization(13.Valeva A. Palmer M. Hilgert K. Kehoe M. Bhakdi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1236: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), that the glycine-rich loop penetrates into the bilayer (14.Ward R.J. Palmer M. Leonard K. Bhakdi S.

In this paper we have analyzed in detail the kinetics of channel formation by α-toxin in artificial liposomes upon acidification. We show that the toxin is very sensitive to the local pH at the surface of the membrane rather than to the bulk pH. Finally, we have made use of these pH effects to study the structure of α-toxin. Our data provide new insights into the multidomain organization of α-toxin and suggest that the protein must partially unfold for channel formation to occur. α-Toxin was produced by strain Wood 46 and purified as described previously(21.Lind I. Ahnert-Hilger G. Fuchs G. Gratzl M. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 164: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorption at 280 nm, based on an optical density of 1.8 for a 1 mg/ml solution. Large unilamellar liposomes were prepared by reverse phase evaporation as described by Szoka and Papahadjopoulos(22.Szoka F.J. Papahadjopoulos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4194-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar, 23.van der Goot F.G. Wong K.R. Pattus F. Buckley J.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2636-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Liposomes were prepared of either 95% egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC) 1The abbreviations used are: EPCegg phosphatidylcholineEPAegg phosphatidic acidEPGegg phosphatidylglycerolMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidSPQ6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinoliniumANS1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate.and 5% egg phosphatidic acid (EPA) or 100% egg phosphatidylglycerol (EPG) or of a mixture of EPC and EPG (1:1, w/w) in a buffer containing 100 mM KCl, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1.5 mg/ml of 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinolinium (SPQ). egg phosphatidylcholine egg phosphatidic acid egg phosphatidylglycerol 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinolinium 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate. All fluorescence experiments were carried out using a PTI spectrofluorometer operating in ratio mode with a spectral bandwidth of 5 nm for excitation and emission. The dye was excited at 350 nm and emission was recorded at 422 nm. Experiments were performed at 25°C under continuous stirring. Liposomes were diluted to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml in a solution containing 100 mM KNO and 20 mM buffer at the desired pH. A phosphate/citric acid buffer was used between pH 3 and 3.5, MES between pH 4 and 6, and HEPES between pH 6.5 and 7. α-Toxin was added to a final concentration of 80 ng/ml. The measurements of the surface potential and the calculation of the corresponding pH value were performed using the fluorescent probe 2-(p-toluidinyl)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (TNS) as described previously(24.Winiski A.P. McLaughlin A.C. McDaniel R.V. Eisenberg M. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8206-8214Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 25.van der Goot F.G. González-Mañas J.M. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Nature. 1991; 354: 408-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Circular dichroic experiments were carried out at room temperature on a Jasco 600 spectrometer. Quartz cells of 0.01- and 1-cm path length were used for measurements in the far (190-240 nm) and near (250-350 nm) UV spectra, respectively. The protein was diluted to a concentration of 0.66 and 0.44 mg/ml for measurements in the far and near UV, respectively. The buffer contained 50 or 150 mM NaCl and 50 mM citric acid/NaHPO adjusted to pH values ranging from 2.5 to 7.4. Spectra were measured after 10 min of incubation at the desired pH. Unless specified otherwise, this set of buffers was used for all experiments aimed at elucidating the effect of pH on the structure of α-toxin. Tryptophan fluorescence experiments were performed as described previously(26.van der Goot F.G. Hardie K.R. Parker M.W. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30496-30501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were allowed to incubate for 10 min at the desired pH before measuring the emission spectrum. The α-toxin concentration was 35 μg/ml. Binding of 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (ANS) was measured as described previously(23.van der Goot F.G. Wong K.R. Pattus F. Buckley J.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2636-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 380 and 480 nm, respectively, and the spectral bandwidths were of 5 nm. The final ANS concentration was 50 μM. The α-toxin concentration was 35 μg/ml. Our goal was to study the channel-forming ability of α-toxin as a function of pH. Egg lipids were used in order to have a mixture of saturated and unsaturated lipids because it has been suggested that unsaturated fatty acids are required for channel formation by α-toxin(27.Ikigai H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2156-2160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Tomita T. Watanabe M. Yasuda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13391-13397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since different types of lipids and a wide range of pH values (3-7.4) were to be used in these experiments, we first determined whether α-toxin was able to cause membrane fusion under our experimental conditions. We used a technique previously described to measure membrane fusion events (29.Arnold K. Hoekstra D. Ohki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1124: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This method consists of mixing liposomes containing pyrene-labeled phosphatidylcholine with unlabeled liposomes and measuring the ratio between the fluorescence intensities of the excimer to monomer peaks. If fusion occurs, pyrene-labeled phosphatidylcholine is diluted and the fluorescence ratio decreases. At all pH values and for the various type of liposomes we have studied (see “Experimental Procedures” and below), we could not detect any decrease in excimer fluorescence indicating that fusion did not occur (data not shown). In contrast, lysozyme, which is known to induce fusion, did lead to a decrease in the ratio of excimer to monomer fluorescence (data not shown). Having established that liposome fusion did not occur, we studied the kinetics of channel formation by monitoring the kinetics of release of chloride from vesicles containing the chloride-sensitive dye SPQ. We first checked that chloride efflux occurred in a dose-dependent manner and that it could be inhibited by zinc, which has been shown to block the α-toxin channel (30.Menestrina G. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 90: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Kinetics were then measured at various pH values with liposomes having different lipid compositions. Fig. 1, A and B, shows that the kinetics obtained using an EPC/EPA (95:5%) mixture and pure EPG were very sensitive to pH. When plotting the maximal rate of chloride efflux as a function of pH, it clearly appears that chloride efflux occurred at far lower pH values for EPC than for EPG vesicles; the EPC/EPG (50:50) vesicles adopted an intermediate behavior (Fig. 1C). Chloride efflux could only be observed from EPC vesicles at pH values below 4, whereas for EPG vesicles, efflux readily occurred at pH 5.5. A decrease in the rate of chloride efflux was observed when the pH was further lowered (data not shown). This inhibition occurred at pH values below 4.5, 4.2, and 3 for pure EPG, EPC/EPG (50:50), and pure EPC vesicles, respectively. We then determined whether the differences in kinetics observed for the various types of liposomes at the different pH values may reflect the amount of oligomers bound to the vesicles. Therefore, at the end of each chloride efflux measurement, the vesicles were recovered by ultracentrifugation and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-boiling conditions. Remarkably similar amounts of oligomers could be seen at all pH values, whether efflux had occurred or not, confirming the existence of non-lytic oligomers (10.Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21782-21786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Thelestam M. Olofsson A. Blomqvist L. Hebert H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1062: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The amounts of oligomer were also very similar for all the lipid compositions studied (data not shown). There seemed to be no correlation between the amount of oligomers and the chloride efflux nor did pH seem to have a significant effect on the oligomerization process. The apparent preference at a given pH of α-toxin for EPG could thus be explained only by a high affinity of the toxin for the phosphatidylglycerol head group or for negatively charged head groups in general. Alternatively, α-toxin may be affected by the pH at the surface of EPG vesicles. A reduced local pH is expected since the negatively charged head groups give rise to an electrical surface potential that in turn decreases the pH at the membrane surface(32.Vaz W.L.C. Nicksch A.

The ΔpH between the bulk and the vesicle surface depends on the surface charge density of lipids, on the local anion concentration, as well as on the size of the vesicles. The Gouy-Chapman theory predicts a ΔpH of 2.7 between a low ionic strength solution and a planar lipid bilayer composed of 100% negatively charged lipids. We have measured the pH near the surface of the EPG vesicles under our experimental conditions. For example, for a bulk pH of 5, the pH at the membrane surface was 1.47 pH units lower than the bulk pH, which is in close agreement with our previous measurements(25.van der Goot F.G. González-Mañas J.M. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Nature. 1991; 354: 408-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). When the maximal velocities of chloride efflux are expressed as a function of interfacial pH (Fig. 1C), it appears that the onset of efflux occurs at a similar pH for EPG and EPC vesicles, demonstrating that the toxin is sensitive to local pH rather than to the chemical structure of the lipid head group. Since acidic pH promotes membrane insertion, we have investigated whether acidification of the medium could induce a conformational change of the protein. We have analyzed the effect of pH on the structure of α-toxin using a variety of spectroscopic techniques. Changes in tertiary interactions were analyzed by near UV CD, in secondary structure by far UV CD, in environment of tryptophans by fluorescence spectroscopy, and in hydrophobicity of the protein by binding of the hydrophobic dye ANS. It is important to note that, if α-toxin is indeed composed of two domains corresponding to the N- and C-terminal halves of the protein as has been proposed, the use of near UV CD or tryptophan fluorescence as probes to follow unfolding of α-toxin introduces a bias. Indeed, one then preferentially analyzes the C-terminal half of the protein as it contains 7 out of the 8 tryptophans (Fig. 3). Even though the N-terminal half also contains a fair amount of aromatic residues, it will moderately contribute to the near UV CD spectrum. In order to investigate whether the tertiary structure of α-toxin is sensitive to pH, we have measured the near UV CD spectrum of the toxin at various pH values. The spectrum of the native toxin has three main peaks: two negative peaks at 266 and 295 nm and a positive peak at 281 nm (Fig. 4A). Down to pH 4.0, this spectrum remained unchanged. Upon a slight further acidification of only 0.5 pH unit, the negative ellipticity at 295 nm dropped by about 80% while the positive ellipticity at 281 nm became negative. The loss of signal at 295 nm, corresponding to the Lb transition of tryptophans(34.Freskgard P.-O. Martensson L.-G. Jonasson P. Jonsson B.-H. Carlsson U. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14281-14288Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), suggests that part of the tryptophan-rich C-terminal half of the protein underwent partial unfolding. The spectrum at pH 3.3 still retained a very broad and intense peak around 280 nm indicating that certain regions in the toxin still possessed a rigid tertiary structure. At lower pH values, the effects became dependent on the ionic strength of the medium. In the presence of 50 mM NaCl, a second, more gradual, unfolding step occurred leading to a full collapse of the spectrum (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, at physiological salt concentrations, the spectrum remained similar to the one observed at pH 3.3, and even at pH values as low as 2.3, indicating that a domain of the toxin was stabilized by salts (Fig. 4B). This change in near UV CD signal was partially reversible. Indeed, 73% of the signal at 281 nm could be recovered when α-toxin was first incubated at pH 3.2 and then diluted into a buffer (50 mM NaCl, 50 mM citric acid/NaHPO) at pH 7. However, at the high concentration required for near UV CD, an incubation of α-toxin at pH 3.2 for several minutes led to aggregation upon neutralization. To establish whether this acid-induced flexibility of the protein was accompanied by a loss of secondary structure, the far UV CD spectrum of α-toxin was measured at various pH values. As shown in Fig. 5, the spectrum is rather insensitive to pH. In particular, the ellipticity at 210 nm did not gradually decrease upon acidification indicating that there was no significant loss in secondary structure. Only for pH values below 2.5 and at 50 mM NaCl could we detect a significant contribution by random coil elements. In Fig. 5, a slight increase in the ellipticity can be observed upon acidification, but as the far UV CD spectra of β-sheet proteins are very sensitive to the environment(35.Manavalan P. Johnson W.C. Nature. 1983; 305: 831-832Crossref Scopus (357) Google Scholar), the appearance of the small changes observed is beyond interpretation. The observed variations are probably due to changes in the conformation of aromatic residues that are known to contribute significantly to the far UV CD spectrum and especially to that of β-sheet proteins(34.Freskgard P.-O. Martensson L.-G. Jonasson P. Jonsson B.-H. Carlsson U. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14281-14288Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 36.Manning M.C. Woody R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8609-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The effect of pH on the structure of α-toxin was further analyzed by measuring the intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophans. The maximal emission wavelength () of tryptophans, an indicator of solvent exposure, was measured at different pH values. For native α-toxin, was found close to 332 nm, indicating that tryptophan residues are buried in a hydrophobic environment (Fig. 6). Down to pH 4, remained unchanged. Upon further acidification, a red shift of was observed suggesting that the environment of some tryptophan residues became hydrophilic. The shape of the unfolding curve depended on the ionic strength as previously observed in the circular dichroism experiments (Fig. 4). At very low salt concentrations (3 mM NaCl), unfolding occurred essentially between pH 4 and 3.5 and seemed to follow an all or none process. However, at 150 mM NaCl, unfolding appeared to occur in two steps indicating again the stabilization of a folding intermediate around pH 3.5. As shown in the inset of Fig. 6, this intermediate showed a much higher fluorescence intensity than the native or the more unfolded toxin. Over a much narrower range of pH, a similar transient increase in fluorescence intensity was observed at 3 mM NaCl indicating that unfolding also occurred in two steps even though this was not apparent when analyzing (data not shown). It is noteworthy that in the presence of >100 mM NaCl, full exposure of all tryptophans no longer occurred since never exceeded 345 nm. As already indicated by the circular dichroism experiments, a domain of the protein seemed to be fully stabilized by salts (Fig. 4B). The effect of pH seemed reversible under all conditions used as shifted back to 332 nm when the pH was raised back to 7.4. We have also investigated the effect of temperature on the acid denaturation of α-toxin. When raising the temperature to 37°C, the first unfolding step observed in the presence of 150 mM NaCl occurred at 0.5 pH unit higher than at 25°C. Indeed, at 25°C, shifted to 333.5 ± 0.4 nm at pH 3.7; however, at 37°C, a similar ( = 333.2 ± 0.1 nm) was already observed at pH 4.3. The second unfolding step was not significantly affected by this temperature shift. Following the hydrophobicity of α-toxin as a function of pH is important for understanding the increased ability of the toxin to form channels at low pH as well as for the characterization of the acid unfolding process. Harshman et al.(20.Harshman S. Boquet P. Duflot E. Alouf J.E. Montecucco C. Papini E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14978-14984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had previously analyzed the effect of pH on the partitioning of α-toxin into the detergent phase of Triton X-114. They showed that at pH values below 4.5, α-toxin partially partitions into Triton X-114 and that all the toxin is found in the detergent phase at pH 3.75, indicating an increase in hydrophobicity upon acidification. We have investigated the effect of pH on the hydrophobicity by measuring the binding of the hydrophobic dye ANS(23.van der Goot F.G. Wong K.R. Pattus F. Buckley J.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2636-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 37.van der Goot F. Ausio J. Wong K. Pattus F. Buckley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18272-18279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We believe this technique is more suitable as it does not require the use of detergents that are likely to affect the structure of the protein. As shown in Fig. 7, a drastic increase of ANS binding was observed between pH 4 and 3.5 suggesting that a hydrophobic region of the protein became exposed. Upon further acidification, the binding decreased again suggesting a more pronounced unfolding of the toxin or aggregation. Indeed, it is known that ANS binds very little to fully unfolded or aggregated proteins. The increase in hydrophobicity observed upon acidification was observed at all salt concentrations studied. The hydrophobic intermediate was, however, stabilized over a wider pH range in the presence of 150 mM NaCl. The effect of temperature on ANS binding was also analyzed. The appearance of the hydrophobic intermediate occurred at higher pH at 37°C than at 25°C (data not shown) in a manner similar to that observed when measuring . These observations indicate that the increase in hydrophobicity is concomitant with the first unfolding step. Similar experiments were performed using an excitation wavelength () of 295 nm instead of 380 nm. Under these conditions, tryptophan residues are excited and ANS can only be excited through energy transfer. The results were very similar to those obtained for = 380 nm suggesting that ANS binds in close proximity to the tryptophan residues, most of which are clustered in the C-terminal half of the toxin. The present study on the effect of pH on the conformation of α-toxin, as well as its ability to form channels in artificial membranes, has led to new information on the three-dimensional structure of the toxin and on the mechanism of membrane insertion. Both CD and tryptophan fluorescence analyses of the effect of pH on the structure of α-toxin clearly show, for the first time, that the toxin is composed of several structurally independent domains. Near UV CD spectroscopy, performed in the presence of 50 mM NaCl, shows a two-step unfolding suggesting the presence of two domains. At physiological salt concentration, however, unfolding seemed to occur in a single step leading to a stable species at acidic pH that still had regions with rigid tertiary structure (Fig. 4B). Under the same conditions (150 mM NaCl), unfolding as indicated by tryptophan fluorescence, revealed a two-step process (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the second increase of (Fig. 6) was not concomitant with a loss of near UV CD signal (Fig. 4B) suggesting that a region of the protein that had already lost its rigid tertiary interaction was undergoing further unfolding. Our data would be consistent with the following multidomain organization of α-toxin. The N-terminal half of the protein would form a single domain (domain 1) separated from the C-terminal region by the so-called glycine-rich loop. This domain 1 would be the less pH-sensitive region of α-toxin, and the presence of salts would completely protect it toward acidic unfolding. In contrast, the C-terminal region would be very sensitive to pH. Upon acidification, it would unfold in a two-step process (Fig. 6). The fact that the two-step process could be selectively affected by varying the salt concentration or the temperature suggests that the C-terminal region might be formed by two domains. This, however, remains to be confirmed. One must keep in mind that all mentioned unfolding steps are only partial as the secondary structure is essentially maintained under the different conditions. It seems that upon acidification, the various domains sequentially undergo a transition to a molten globule-like state. The most interesting folding intermediate was obtained, at pH 3.5, at physiological salt concentrations. In this folding intermediate, domain 1 is probably still fully folded, but the rest of the protein shows typical characteristics of the molten globule-like state: native-like secondary structure, increased flexibility of the tertiary structure, and binding of ANS. However, this folding intermediate does not seem as compact as most molten globule-like states since some tryptophans appear to be accessible to the solvent. Our study on the kinetics of chloride efflux induced by α-toxin revealed that the protein is sensitive to the local pH at the membrane surface, rather than to the bulk pH, and that this pH had to be lower than 4 for channel formation to occur (Fig. 1C). The rate of channel formation was optimal at a local pH of 3.5 (Fig. 1C). Subsequent studies on the effect of pH on the structure of the toxin showed that below pH 4, the protein unfolds in a multistep process that could be explained by the sequential partial unfolding of domains. The first unfolding step, corresponding to the partial unfolding of a C-terminal region, correlates well with the increase in the rate of channel formation (when expressed as a function of local pH, Fig. 1C) suggesting that it is required for channel formation. In contrast, additional unfolding of the N-terminal region of the protein seemed to have an inactivating effect. Clearly, the pH values at which α-toxin activation was observed are below the physiological range. Whether similarly low pH values may be encountered in the close vicinity of the plasma membrane in certain tissue is not clear. The present observations may also suggest that α-toxin could act from within acidic endosomes or lysosomes. In any case, our goal in this study was to make use of the pH effects to understand unfolding and insertion. Taken together, the above described observations suggest that the C-terminal half of α-toxin has to undergo partial unfolding for channel formation to occur. It has been previously observed by us and by others that a variety of toxins including diphtheria toxin, colicin A, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (for review, see (38.van der Goot F.G. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and (39.London E. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3277-3282Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)) must undergo partial unfolding in order to insert into a membrane. The membrane-interacting domains of these toxins have a common α-helical folding motif as described by Parker and Pattus(40.Parker M.W. Pattus F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 391-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). α-Toxin, in contrast, belongs to a very different family of pore-forming toxins that are essentially formed of β-sheet, must oligomerize in order to insert into the membrane, and are thought to form porin-like channels. This family includes aerolysin, Clostridium septicum α-toxin, protective antigen of anthrax toxin and some of the oxygen-labile toxins(41.van der Goot F.G. Parker M. Pattus F. Buckley J.T. Toxicology. 1994; 87: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 42.Milne J.C. Furlong D. Hanna P.C. Wall J.S. Collier R.J. J. Biol.

The requirement of acidic pH for channel formation by toxins of this family has only been shown for anthrax toxin protective antigen (45.Koehler T.M. Collier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1501-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and α-toxin, but the effects of pH have not been further characterized. This study is the first evidence that some β-sheet pore-forming toxins also require a transition to a molten globule-like state in order to form transmembrane channels. In this work, we have used pH to trigger unfolding. It is, however, tempting to speculate that in vivo other factors, such as interactions with a specific receptor on the target membrane, could induce a similar transition."

A fragment between nucleotides −21 and −1609 exhibited promoter activity when ligated in a sense orientation into a promoterless luciferase reporter plasmid and transiently transfected into rat H4-II-E hepatoma cells. 5′ progressive deletion and block substitution analyses revealed that the three proximal Sp1 boxes (boxes 3, 5, and 6) are required for basal transcription of the pp120 gene. Promoter activity was stimulated 2-3-fold in response to insulin, dexamethasone, insulin plus dexamethasone, and cAMP. Although unaltered by phorbol esters alone, promoter activity was stimulated 4-5-fold in response to phorbol esters plus cAMP. Several motifs resembling response elements for insulin (in the rat phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene), glucocorticoids, cAMP, and phorbol esters as well as a number of putative binding sites for activating proteins-1 (Jun/Fos) and −2, and liver-specific factors were detected.

Molecular cloning revealed that the rat pp120 gene consists of nine exons, the 7th of which (53 bp) is alternatively spliced during mRNA processing, generating two alternatively spliced variants that differ in the intracellular cytoplasmic domain(11.Najjar S.M.

We have observed that the rate of insulin-stimulated internalization and degradation of the ligand-receptor complex is 2-3-fold higher in NIH 3T3 cells coexpressing insulin receptors and pp120 than in cells expressing insulin receptors alone, suggesting a role for pp120 in the hepatic clearance of insulin from circulation(12.Formisano P.

Since pp120 may play a physiological role in insulin metabolism, it has become essential to understand the mechanism of its in vivo expression, both basal and regulated. Glucocorticoid treatment of rats increased pp120 protein level 2-3-fold in liver plasma membrane(1.Rees-Jones R.W. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4461-4467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the molecular basis for the regulation by glucocorticoids, we have cloned the 5′-flanking region and demonstrated a functional promoter activity of the pp120 gene. This region lacks a TATA box and contains multiple transcription initiation sites as well as potential binding sites for basal and regulatory transcriptional elements. Additionally, we have observed that Sp1 plays an important role in determining basal promoter activity of the gene. Detection of a -2 positive plaque upon screening of a rat genomic DNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) by hybridization with a P-labeled full-length rat liver ecto-ATPase cDNA was described previously(11.Najjar S.M.

The genomic DNA insert that contains exon 1-4 and 20 kb of the 5′-flanking region (11.Najjar S.M. Accili D. Philippe N. Jernberg J. Margolis R. Taylor S.I. J. Biol.

A plasmid clone of >10 kb of genomic DNA (p-2(7)) containing exon 1 and its 5′-flanking region was identified by hybridization with a P-labeled exon 1-specific primer (α-60, see Table 1). Similarly, a plasmid clone p-2(12) of 2.2 kb containing exon 2 and parts of intervening introns 1 and 2 was identified by hybridization with a P-labeled exon 2-specific primer (α-100, see Table 1). Hybridization was carried out as described previously (11.Najjar S.M. Accili D. Philippe N. Jernberg J. Margolis R. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1201-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Plasmid clone p-2(7), which contains pp120 5′-flanking region, was treated with either EcoRI or HindIII, and the resulting fragments were self-religated. Plasmid subclones containing shorter DNA fragments (p-2(7-HindIII) of 8-9 kb and p-2(7-EcoRI) of 320 bp) were then identified by hybridization with P-labeled α-60 primer. p-2(7-HindIII) and p-2(7-EcoRI) were then employed as templates in sequencing reactions using the 7-deaza Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and α-60, T3, and T7 pBluescript II KS-specific oligonucleotides as initial primers. To obtain intron 1 sequence, plasmid clone p-2(12) was used as template and α-100, T3, and T7 pBluescript II KS-specific oligonucleotides as initial primers. Double-stranded genomic DNA corresponding to nt −1609 to −21 was synthesized and amplified by Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 1 μg of p-2(7-HindIII) as template and 100 ng of each of sense s(−1609) and antisense α(−21) primers. Following initial DNA denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, 30 cycles of PCR were carried out as described previously(11.Najjar S.M. Accili D. Philippe N. Jernberg J. Margolis R. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1201-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An aliquot of amplified DNA (50 ng) was ligated into pCRII plasmid (Invitrogen, San Diego). Constructs containing the genomic DNA insert in either sense or reverse orientation were treated with XhoI and HindIII, and the DNA was analyzed on 1% agarose gel and electroeluted in 0.2 × TBE (Tris-borate-EDTA) buffer at 60 V for 3 h. Purified genomic DNA was then ligated at the XhoI and HindIII sites of pGL3-BASIC promoterless firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega). The same PCR technique was employed to synthesize the 5′ deletion products using the same α(−21) antisense primer and different sense 21-mer primers whose 5′ ends were at nt −439, −249, −194, −147, −131, −124, and −112, respectively. Amplified genomic DNA was subsequently subcloned at the XhoI and HindIII sites of pGL3-BASIC plasmid. Scanning mutants between nt −209 and −128 were created in the −249/-21 promoter fragment by replacing 20 bp of the native sequence with 20 bp of a heterologous sequence that includes an EcoRI restriction site (5′-CTCgaattcGATGGCGGTAT-3′) in a PCR-based reaction. Mutant promoters were prepared by EcoRI restriction and ligation of the appropriate pairs of the 5′ and 3′ fragments. The mutant promoter fragments were cloned into the XhoI/HindIII sites of pGL3-BASIC plasmid. Using this procedure, three mutant constructs were synthesized and designated as −249Mut3pLuc, −249Mut5pLuc, and −249Mut6pLuc containing block substitution mutation from nt −209 to −189, −169 to −149, and −148 to −128, respectively.

Cells were adapted to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biofluids Inc.) two passages before transfection, plated in 60-mm dishes at 50-70% confluence, and then transfected with 5 μg of the pGL3-pp120 construct using the DEAE-dextran method. To correct for transfection efficiency, cells were cotransfected with 1.4 μg of pXGH5 human growth hormone plasmid driven by the mouse metallothionein-1 promoter (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA). 100 μl of DEAE-dextran (1 mg/ml) in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, was added to the DNA construct for 10 min at room temperature before addition to the cells at room temperature for 15 min. After addition of 3 ml of serum-supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, cells were allowed to incubate at 37°C, 5% CO for 4 h. Medium was then replaced with fresh complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and the cells incubated at 37°C, 5% CO for 24 h. One ml of medium was then collected to assay secreted hGH as a measure for transfection efficiency(14.Suh D.-S. Ooi G. Rechler M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 794-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and cells were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO for additional 24 h in complete medium supplemented with either 1 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 10M dexamethasone (Sigma), 0.5 mM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma) or 1 mM cAMP (Sigma). At the end of the incubation period, cells were lysed, and the luciferase activity was measured (14.Suh D.-S. Ooi G. Rechler M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 794-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) using an automated luminometer (Lumat, LB 9501, Berthold, Gaithersburg, MD). The TAP (Epicenter Technologies, Madison, WI) reverse ligation PCRs were carried out as described previously(15.Boisclair Y.R. Brown A.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 731-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Total rat liver RNA (10 μg) was treated with DNase I (10 units, Boehringer Mannheim) at 37°C for 30 min to remove residual DNAs. The phosphate groups at the 5′ end of partially degraded RNAs were then removed by calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (50 units, CIP, New England Biolabs) treatment (50°C, 2 h). The 5′-5′ phosphodiester-linked cap structure was subsequently hydrolyzed by TAP treatment (5 units, 1 h, 37°C). An RNA linker (DNA Pr-1, Table 1) was then ligated to the free 5′ phosphates by incubating with T4 RNA ligase (3 units, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at 17°C for 16 h in presence of RNasin (20 units, Promega). cDNA corresponding to the linked mRNA was then reverse transcribed in presence of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM dNTPs, and 1 μg of bovine serum albumin by Superscript II RNaseH reverse transcriptase (200 units, Life Technologies, Inc.) using 1-10 ng of α-45 exon 1-specific primer (Table 1). Following heat inactivation at 95°C for 10 min and RNaseH (2.7 units, Life Technologies, Inc.) treatment at 37°C for 20 min, the resulting cDNA extending to the cap site was then amplified in a nested PCR carried out in presence of 100-500 ng of a sense DNA primer complementary to the RNA linker (DNA Pr-1, Table 1) and 10-100 ng of either α-38 (first PCR, Table 1) and α-19 (second nested PCR, Table 1) as exon 1-specific antisense primers. The second PCR was carried out using 10% volume of the first PCR as template. After initial DNA denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, 20 (first reaction) or 25-30 (second reaction) cycles of PCR were carried out as described previously(15.Boisclair Y.R. Brown A.L.

XhoI treatment of -2 genomic DNA, a bacteriophage that contains exons 1-4 including 24 kb of the 5′-flanking region of the pp120 gene (Fig. 1 and (11.Najjar S.M. Accili D. Philippe N. Jernberg J.

A positive plasmid clone (p-2(7)) containing a genomic fragment of >10 kb which includes exon 1 was identified by Southern blot hybridization with α-60 (Fig. 1), an exon 1-specific oligonucleotide probe (Table 1). The p-2(7) plasmid construct was treated with either EcoRI or HindIII. The resulting DNA fragments were self-religated, and positive subclones were again identified by hybridization with α-60 primer. Subclones p-2(7-HindIII), containing 8-9 kb, and p-2(7-EcoRI), containing 0.3 kb of the 5′-flanking region, were obtained (Fig. 1). Beginning with pp120-specific α-60 primer and pBluescript II KS-specific T3 and T7 primers, the DNA sequence in each of the p-2(7-HindIII) and p-2(7-EcoRI) subclones was analyzed (Fig. 2).Figure 2Nucleotide sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the rat pp120 gene.

Sequence analysis by MacVector 4.5 program (IBI) revealed the presence of several putative DNA-binding elements that may play a role in basal and regulated pp120 transcriptional activity. These include multiple putative Sp1 binding sites in the proximal promoter (Table 2) and a number of motifs conforming to the consensus binding site for HNF-1/HP-1 liver-specific transcription factor (nt −1624 to −1612) and for LF-A1-RS (Table 3), a trans-acting factor that is required for the expression of several genes such as human apolipoprotein A1, haptoglobin-related genes, and human α-antitrypsin in hepatocytes(17.Hardon E.M. Frain M. Paonessa G. Cortese R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1711-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Overlapping sequences matching perfectly the consensus binding sequence for HNF-5 (nt −1359 to −1373), a liver-specific factor in the rat tyrosine aminotransferase gene(18.Grange T. Roux J. Rigaud G. Pictet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), were characteristically found in proximity to other liver-specific factor binding sites such as CAAT enhancer-binding protein (nt −1376 to −1346) binding sites in the liver-specific rat tyrosine aminotransferase gene (TTTGTTTT, (18.Grange T.

A. 1988; 85: 7192-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) were also identified (Table 4).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Initial attempts to map the cap sites by primer extension and nuclease protection assays failed, perhaps because of the low abundance of mRNA encoding pp120 and the potential formation of mRNA secondary structures due to the high GC content of the proximal promoter. To overcome this problem, we used a more sensitive PCR-based assay, TAP reverse ligation PCR(15.Boisclair Y.R. Brown A.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 731-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 23.Fromont-Racine M. Bertrand E. Pictet R. Grange T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1683-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In these experiments, an RNA linker was ligated to the exposed 5′ end of mRNA, and the linked mRNA was used as template to synthesize the corresponding cDNA by reverse transcriptase in the presence of α-45 as antisense primer. cDNA extending to the cap site was then amplified using a sense DNA primer complementary to the RNA linker (DNA Pr-1, Table 1) paired with two nested exon 1-specific antisense primers (α-38 and α-19, Table 1). The size of the PCR products was measured by comparison with a sequencing ladder using p-2(7-HindIII) as template and α-19 as primer (Fig. 3). Four specific PCR products of 145 (band A), 115 (band B), 85 (band C), and 71 bp (band D) were thus obtained at an annealing temperature of 54°C, 5°C below the melting temperature of α-19 (Fig. 3). These bands persisted at annealing temperatures of up to 70°C (data not shown). However, none of these bands was detected when either TAP or reverse transcriptase was omitted from the reaction (Fig. 3). After subtracting the size (25 bp) of the DNA sense primer (DNA Pr-1) that corresponds to the RNA linker (Table 1), transcription start sites were mapped to nt −101, −71, −41, and −27. Transcription start sites were mapped to these nucleotides even when another reverse transcriptase primer or different combinations of nested DNA primers were used (data not shown). The bands corresponding to the four transcription start sites were excised and the DNA eluted and reamplified in a PCR using DNA Pr-1 and α-19 as sense and antisense primers, respectively. Hybridization with a pp120 exon 1-specific primer (α-10, Table 1) confirmed specificity of all bands to the pp120 gene (data not shown). Subsequent sequencing of each of amplified bands A, B, C, and D by the thermostable DNA polymerase in the f-mole cycle sequencing kit (Promega) using α-19 as primer confirmed the mapping of distinct mRNA transcription initiation sites to nt −101, −71, −41, and −27 (data not shown). Since no TATA box was found properly positioned in proximity to the start sites, we conclude that the rat pp120 gene does not contain a functional TATA box. The region mapping the transcription start sites is GC-rich and contains a number of GC boxes (Table 2) that may be recognized by Sp1 transcription factor(24.Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). To determine whether the 5′-flanking sequence contains functional promoter activity, we directionally subcloned an amplified DNA fragment (nt −21 to −1609) at the XhoI/HindIII sites of the pGL3 promoterless luciferase plasmid. Lysates from H4-II-E rat hepatoma cells transfected with the sense construct showed greater than 30-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with lysates from cells transfected with a construct containing the promoter ligated in the reverse orientation relative to the luciferase gene (Fig. 4; sense 1,812.3 ± 535.49 versus reverse: 43.4 ± 2.33, p < 0.05). There was no difference (p > 0.05) in the luciferase activity in lysates made from untransfected cells (Fig. 4; untransfected 40.6 ± 3.54) and cells transfected with the reverse construct (Fig. 4; reverse 43.4 ± 2.33). This suggests that the pp120 promoter functions in an orientation-specific manner. The proximal region of the pp120 promoter contains six potential Sp1 boxes (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Three of these potential Sp1 binding sites (boxes 4-6) lie adjacent to one another in a 30-bp region between nt −143 and −114, with boxes 4 and 5 overlapping by one nucleotide. Boxes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are variant isoforms in which the C of the GGCG core is replaced by A. Box 3 (nt −157 and −149) showed perfect homology, with 9 out of 9 bp matches in the consensus site for Sp1-CS4 binding (Table 2). Interestingly, the Sp1 cluster (boxes 4-6) is embedded in a region containing direct and inverted repeats (the CTCTGGGAGG sequence is repeated between nt −143 and −134, and −126 and −117, and the CCCTCCTCT sequence at nt −131 to −123 is directly fused in direct tandem with its inverted complement, GGGAGGAGA, at nt −122 to −114). To determine whether any of these putative Sp1 boxes is important for basal promoter activity, we measured luciferase activity in H4-II-E cells transfected with pGL3 constructs containing promoter fragments in which individual Sp1 boxes were progressively removed from the 5′ end (Fig. 5). As Fig. 5 reveals, deletion of the region between nt −1609 and −439 induced a slight increase in the basal promoter activity (−1609pLuc 2,444.9 ± 820.81 versus −439pLuc 5,198.1 ± 875.48; p < 0.05), suggesting that this region may contain potential down-regulators and confirming our initial observations that the putative TATA boxes located distally at nt −939, −1117, −1484, and −1532 are not functional. Removal of the sequence between nt −439 and −194 (which deletes boxes 1 and 2) did not lead to a significant change in promoter activity relative to the −439pLuc construct (−439pLuc 5,198.1 ± 875.48 versus −194pLuc 4,246.0 ± 1128.23; p > 0.05), indicating that Sp1 boxes 1 and 2 do not significantly contribute to basal promoter activity. However, deletion of the sequence between nt −194 and −147 (which further deleted box 3) significantly reduced promoter activity by 80% (−147pLuc 818.1 ± 168.6 versus −194pLuc 4,246.0 ± 1128.2, p <0.05), suggesting that box 3 plays a major role in the pp120 basal promoter activity. Deletion of box 4 in addition to boxes 3, 2, and 1 in the −131pLuc construct did not result in additional decrease (869.1 ± 111.3) compared with removing box 3 (in addition to boxes 2 and 1) in the −147pLuc construct (818.1 ± 168.6), suggesting either that box 4 itself did not contribute to basal promoter activity or that box 4 may require box 3 for activity. Further removal of box 5 (in addition to boxes 1-4) in the −124pLuc construct gave an additional decrease (62%) of the promoter activity (326.7 ± 33.74) relative to the −131pLuc construct (869.1 ± 111.3), indicating that Sp1 box 5 plays an important role in basal promoter activity. Deleting all Sp1 boxes, including box 6 in the −112pLuc construct, resulted in even a more reduced (54%) activity relative to the −124pLuc construct (149.8 ± 23.46), suggesting that in addition to boxes 3 and 5, box 6 contributes to basal promoter activity of the pp120 gene. In addition to the 5′ deletion analysis described above, a 20-bp nucleotide block substitution (which selectively mutated boxes 2, 3, 4/5) in the −249/-21 promoter fragment was also made to assess the functional significance of these respective Sp1 boxes in basal promoter activity (Fig. 6). Mutation of Sp1 box 2 did not alter promoter activity of the −249/-21 promoter fragment (−249Mut3pLuc 5,965.5 ± 381.69 versus −249pLuc 4,422.4 ± 971.42), confirming the previous observation that box 2 did not play a significant role in the overall pp120 promoter activity. However, mutation of the region spanning Sp1 box 3 (−249Mut5) or that spanning Sp1 box 4 and box 5 together (−249Mut6) in the −249/-21 promoter fragment led to a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in luciferase activity relative to the intact −249pLuc construct (−249Mut5pLuc 1,501.9 ± 579.37 and −249Mut6pLuc 1,173.1 ± 293.07 versus −249pLuc 4,422.4 ± 971.42). Thus, selective block mutation of either box 3 or boxes 4/5 led to a comparable reduction in the overall activity of the pp120 promoter, indicating that these Sp1 binding sites are equally important. It is unclear whether boxes 4 and 5 are both essential for activity, since mutations in −249Mut6pLuc did target both of these boxes. However, 5′ deletion analysis suggests that box 4 did not contribute to basal activity since deletion of box 4 did not further decrease basal activity of the pp120 promoter (−147pLuc versus −131pLuc). Taken together, 5′ deletion and block mutation analyses suggest that the collective presence of Sp1 boxes 3, 5, and 6 is needed for full basal activity of the pp120 promoter in H4-II-E cells. The 5′-flanking region of the pp120 gene contains putative response elements for insulin, glucocorticoids, phorbol esters, and cAMP (Table 4). To determine whether the promoter activity is regulated by these agents, H4-II-E cells transfected with the full-length sense construct were treated with either insulin, dexamethasone, cAMP, PMA, insulin and dexamethasone, or with PMA and cAMP for 24 h, and luciferase activity was assayed in cellular lysates (Fig. 7).

https://openalex.org/W1968504583,"Digoxin-like immunoreactive factor (DLIF) from adrenal cortex is an endogenous molecule with structural features remarkably similar to those of digoxin, a plant-derived cardiac glycoside (Shaikh, I. M., Lau, B. W. C., Siegfried, B. A., and Valdes, R., Jr.(1991) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 266, 13672-13678). Two characteristic structural and functional features of digoxin are a lactone ring and three digitoxose sugars attached to a steroid nucleus. Digoxin is known to undergo deglycosylation during metabolism in humans. We now demonstrate the existence of several naturally occurring deglycosylated components of DLIF in human serum. The components are identified as DLIF-genin, DLIF-mono, and DLIF-bis, corresponding to the aglycone, and the aglycone with one and two sugars, respectively. Similar components are produced by acid-induced deglycosylation of DLIF isolated from bovine adrenal cortex. The elution pattern and sequence of DLIF-deglycosylation was identical to that of digoxin suggesting identical sugar stoichiometry. However, analysis of these newly discovered congeners by reverse-phase chromatography, spectrophotometry, antibody reactivity, and kinetics of deglycosylation, demonstrates that subtle structural and physical differences do exist when compared to digoxin. DLIF was chromatographically distinct from digoxin, and interestingly, the mobility of the DLIF-genin was shifted toward increased polarity relative to digoxigenin. DLIF and DLIF-bis, -mono, and -genin congeners have absorbance maxima at 216 nm, whereas digoxin and its congeners absorb at 220 nm. Reaction with specific antibodies directed at the lactone portion of these molecules shows DLIF and its deglycosylated congeners to be 10<sup>3</sup>-fold less reactive than digoxin. Kinetics of sugar removal suggests that DLIF is 8-fold more susceptible to deglycosylation than is digoxin. Two less polar DLIF components produced from the DLIF-genin have at 196 nm and are 4-fold less immunoreactive than DLIF. Our data suggest that subtle structural differences exist between DLIF and digoxin at or near the lactone ring as well as in the nature of the sugars. The presence of deglycosylated congeners of DLIF in human serum, including the less polar components, suggests <i>in vivo</i> deglycosylation of these factors. This is the first demonstration of the existence of naturally occurring deglycosylated derivatives of DLIF and establishes the likelihood of active metabolism of DLIF in mammals."

In this report, we show that the four subunits of the yeast DNA polymerase α-primase complex are assembled throughout the cell cycle, and physical association between newly synthesized pol α (p180) and unphosphorylated B subunit (p86) occurs very rapidly. Therefore, B subunit phosphorylation does not appear to modulate p180•p86 interaction. Conversely, by depletion experiments and by using a yeast mutant strain, which produces a low and constitutive level of the p180 polypeptide, we found that formation of the p180•p86 subcomplex is required for B subunit phosphorylation."

Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Plasmids directing expression of truncated forms of CAML were made by standard protocols that included exonuclease III digestion and polymerase chain reaction(11.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6830) Google Scholar). Fragments of the CAML coding sequence generated by polymerase chain reaction and use of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) were ligated into the XhoI and EcoRI restriction endonuclease sites of pFLEX. Plasmids are designated by the amino acid residues included in the product protein, with 1-296 being the full-length native protein. The primer sequences are listed in Table 1.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The SXNFAT plasmid is described elsewhere(12.Bram R.J. Hung D.T. Martin P.K. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4760-4769Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Briefly, it contains three copies of the NFAT enhancer element and the interleukin-2 minimal promoter to direct expression of the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) gene. TAg Jurkat T cells, stably transfected with the SV40 large T antigen, were obtained from J. Northrop (Stanford Medical Center) and maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) plus 10% fetal calf serum (Gemini Bioproducts) at 37°C in 5% CO at a density of 105-106 cells/ml. COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) plus 10% fetal calf serum. Mutant CAML expression was assayed by transient co-transfection with the NFAT reporter plasmid, SXNFAT, using 6 μg of pFLEX or CAML expression construct, 6 μg of SXNFAT, and 2 μg of a vector expressing luciferase as a transfection control. Electroporation into TAg Jurkat cells and measurement of NFAT-SEAP were performed as described previously(12.Bram R.J. Hung D.T. Martin P.K. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4760-4769Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Treatment of the transfected cells with 32 nM PMA was used to activate the nuclear subunit of NFAT, AP1(13.Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L. Curran T. Rao A. Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured by standard protocols. Western blot assays of FLAG-labeled CAML constructs indicated that the deletion mutants were correctly expressed in transiently transfected COS cells. Monoclonal FLAG-M2 antibody was obtained from Kodak. TAg Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with 6 μg of a CAML expression vector together with 2 μg of co-transfected vector expressing mouse CD8. Cells were stained with rat anti-mouse CD8 conjugated to fluorescein and with 3 μM indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes). Cytoplasmic calcium was measured in the transfected (CD8 positive) cells on a Becton Dickinson FACS Vantage instrument by determining the ratio of indo-1 fluorescence at 400-480 nm following excitation at 334-364 nm(14.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with CD8 plasmid alone served as the control. Activation of the T cell-specific transcription factor NFAT was assayed by co-transfection of CAML expression plasmids with the NFAT-SEAP plasmid SXNFAT. Expression of SEAP from this reporter depends on cross-linking of the T cell receptor or stimulation of the second messengers protein kinase C and Ca (by treatment with PMA plus ionomycin) and is completely blocked by cyclosporin A or FK506. As shown previously(6.Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), overexpression of full-length CAML replaced the usual requirement for Ca influx, while having no effect on the requirement for PMA costimulation, consistent with a selective effect on Ca signaling. To define the degree of activation in transiently transfected T cells more precisely, we developed an assay comparing the effects of CAML and mutant constructs with that of thapsigargin. Unlike ionomycin, which acts at both the endoplasmic reticulum and the cell surface, thapsigargin activates capacitative Ca influx selectively by depleting intracellular Ca stores(15.Ghosh T.K.

Chem. 1989; 264: 12266-12271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NFAT activation in control cells was characterized by a discrete maximal response at 5 nM thapsigargin (Fig. 1, dotted line) with PMA costimulation. By marked contrast, CAML overexpression not only significantly activated NFAT in the absence of thapsigargin but also shifted the dose-response curve to the left, causing a maximal response at 2.5 nM and a marked enhancement of activation due to thapsigargin concentrations as low as 250 pM (Fig. 1, solid line). A reproducible measure of CAML activity could be obtained by expressing the degree of activation due to CAML plus PMA as a percentage of maximal activation induced by the addition of thapsigargin. To define the active residues in the CAML protein, we made 10 different deletion mutants and inserted them into the eukaryotic expression plasmid pFLEX, which adds the FLAG epitope to the N terminus of inserted genes. Proteins encoded by these expression plasmids were verified as being correct by transfection into COS cells, followed by extraction and Western blotting with the FLAG monoclonal antibody (data not shown). Each protein yielded a band of the correct size on Western blots, thus demonstrating roughly similar levels of accumulation. Transfection-titration experiments in Tag Jurkat cells were performed with the 10 mutant CAML constructs together with the control and full-length vectors. Fig. 2A shows the portions of CAML-coding sequence left in each construct, while Fig. 2B indicates the effectiveness of each construct at activating NFAT as a percentage of maximal activation due to CAML plus thapsigargin. Deletions removing a portion of or all of the N-terminal half of the protein had no important effect in the assay (compare residues 189-296 with the full-length 1-296) nor did removal of the last seven amino acids from the short hydrophilic C terminus(1-289). By contrast, removal of 46 residues from the C-terminal end(1-250) effectively abolished NFAT activity. To further localize the activating activity within the hydrophobic domain, we next tested plasmids encoding subregions of the three putative transmembrane domains. One that encoded a surprisingly small part of the protein, the predicted second and third membrane-spanning regions (residues 240-289), was active in this assay. The loop region (residues 220-240) between the putative membrane domains 1 and 2 was not necessary, as it could be deleted without any apparent effect (compare 220-289 with 240-289). Domains 1 and 2(195-265) or either domain 2 or 3 alone (220-265 and 268-289) lacked significant activity in the NFAT assay. We conclude from these experiments that domains 2 and 3 are necessary and sufficient to form the minimum active fragment of CAML. This interpretation is supported by independent comparison of human and chicken CAML genes showing that the greatest area of sequence similarity is within the C terminus(19.Bram, R. (1996) Gene (Amst.), in pressGoogle Scholar). Indeed, of the 50 residues within the 240-289 domain, 46 were identical between the two species and two others were highly conserved. Because overexpression of CAML shifts the dose-response curve of thapsigargin to lower drug levels, we inferred that CAML acts positively in this signaling pathway to activate NFAT. To examine the possibility of a dominant negative effect in any of the mutant CAML constructs we similarly investigated dose-response curves for a shift to higher thapsigargin levels. The 240-289 active fragment, containing the putative second and third membrane-spanning domains, displays elevated NFAT activity and increased sensitivity to thapsigargin, as indicated by the left shift of the titration curve (Fig. 3, triangles). The assay results with this plasmid resemble those of transfections with the full-length CAML plasmid, although the values are often higher with the short fragment, suggesting the possibility of an inhibitory or modulatory region within the N-terminal half of the protein. Each mutant plasmid with NFAT-stimulating activity (1-289, 44-296, 189-296, 220-289, and 240-289) also showed a similar shift of thapsigargin response to lower levels. By contrast, each of the inactive mutant plasmids (1-250, 1-201, 195-265, 220-265, 268-289), while directing appropriate protein expression as measured by Western blot analysis, did not shift the response of cells to thapsigargin to higher levels by comparison with control transfections (Fig. 3, squares and data not shown). Thus, we can find no evidence for a dominant negative effect of any of our constructs. Similar results were obtained using ionomycin titration instead of thapsigargin. To further localize the effects of overexpression of mutant CAML constructs, we asked whether calcineurin was an obligate intermediate in the activation of NFAT. Cells transfected with the 240-289 expression plasmid were stimulated with PMA in the presence or absence of cyclosporin A at 100 ng/ml. Addition of this immunosuppressive level of cyclosporin A completely abrogated NFAT expression (data not shown), consistent with our model in which this CAML fragment triggers NFAT through activation of calcineurin. To verify that the activation of calcineurin was due to elevation of Ca, we measured the effect of the residue 240-289 expression plasmid on cytoplasmic Ca levels. Cells transfected with full-length CAML and those expressing the 240-289 deletion mutant were loaded with indo-1 and identified by staining for a cell surface co-transfected marker. Control transfections had normal resting Ca fluorescence levels (Fig. 4A), while cells overexpressing either CAML or the 240-289 fragment displayed a significant number showing markedly elevated [Ca] (Fig. 4, B and C). Addition of EGTA to the cell medium during the FACS analysis caused cells with elevated [Ca] to drop down to base line within 4-5 s (data not shown). Thus, overexpression of this relatively small peptide is sufficient to elevate [Ca] to levels similar to that of the full-length protein, an effect likely produced by increased influx of Ca from outside the cell. The structure-function data presented here demonstrate that residues 240-289 of CAML are necessary and sufficient to activate Ca influx when overexpressed in Jurkat T cells. These residues overlap the previously noted transmembrane domains 2 and 3. Because the N-terminal half of the protein does not activate Ca influx and is not necessary for the activity of the 240-289 fragment, we propose that it may regulate CAML function under normal circumstances. However, we cannot exclude a regulatory role for other factors (e.g. altered interference by interacting proteins or altered subcellular localization). Studies to address this issue are under way. The finding that the modest 50-residue fragment of CAML can activate Ca influx argues against an enzymatic role for CAML in this context, since it seems unlikely that such a small peptide could catalyze a reaction producing a small second messenger. We favor instead a model in which this domain of CAML forms a direct protein interaction site by which it contacts and activates the next signaling protein in the pathway. The downstream target of CAML is currently unknown but could include such well characterized molecules as the inositol trisphosphate receptor or the endoplasmic reticulum Ca pump or the hypothesized intracellular Ca leak channel(20.Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar). To date, we have not been able to ascertain the filling state of intracellular stores in CAML-overexpressing cells and hence cannot yet place the putative target upstream or downstream of the site where the capacitative Ca influx signal is generated. Indeed, because of the extreme hydrophobic nature of residues 240-289, CAML may itself be a component of an internal Ca channel."
https://openalex.org/W2087166296,"Abstract The glucose-stimulated rise in Fru-2,6-P2 in liver results from xylulose 5-P activation of a specific protein phosphatase 2A which dephosphorylates Fru-6-P,2-kinase:Fru-2,6-bisphosphatase (Nishimura, M., and Uyeda, K. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 26100-26106). In order to determine the role of xylulose 5-P in regulating Fru-2,6-P2 in liver, the effect of fatty acids, various hexoses, and hormones was examined in perfused rat liver and in intact rats. When 24-h starved rat livers were perfused with acetate, butyrate, or propionate, Fru-2,6-P2 and xylulose 5-P decreased to the same extent and at similar rates. The activity ratios of the kinase and the phosphatase changed in a reciprocal manner, indicating that the phosphorylated form of the enzyme was increased by the fatty acids perfusion. The fatty acids caused the similar changes in the metabolites and the phosphorylation state of the bifunctional enzyme in livers of fed animals. Fructose, galactose, or mannose perfusion in starved rat liver increased both Fru-2,6-P2 and xylulose 5-P and converted the bifunctional enzyme to the dephospho form. Both the Fru-2,6-P2 and xylulose 5-P levels in rats fed a high fat diet decreased over 50% compared to that in control rats. These results indicated a close correlation between Fru-2,6-P2 and xylulose 5-P levels and the phosphorylation state of fructose 6-P,2-kinase:fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase. Fatty acid inhibition of glucose metabolism can be explained by a decrease in xylulose 5-P, which lowers xylulose 5-P-activated protein phosphatase 2A activity, resulting in more phosphorylated form of the bifunctional enzyme and consequently lower Fru-2,6-P2."

An understanding of this problem is important to utilization of the data being generated by the human genome project and to further the design and engineering of proteins with specific structures and functions. Loops and turns, the connections between the regular secondary structures, are critical to the design of properly folded proteins. These structures are difficult to characterize because of their range of conformations. The short β-turns and reverse turns were the first to be characterized(1.Venkatachalam C.M. Biopolymers. 1968; 6: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar, 2.Sibanda B.L. Blundell T.L. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 759-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar); then the longer -loops were described(3.Leszczynski J.F. Rose G.D. Science. 1986; 234: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar); and finally a more comprehensive definition of loops was published ((4.Ring C.S. Kneller D.G. Langridge R. Cohen F.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 685-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar); for review, see (5.Fetrow J.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 708-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar)). We are interested in defining the role that loops, particularly -loops, play in protein folding, function, and stability. -Loops are nonregular protein secondary structures defined as a sequence of six or more residues with a short distance between segment termini and a lack of regular hydrogen bonding between backbone residues(3.Leszczynski J.F. Rose G.D. Science. 1986; 234: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). However, significant hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions can exist between side chain and backbone atoms within the loop itself. 1B. A. Kell and J. S. Fetrow, unpublished results. -Loops are generally found at protein surfaces(3.Leszczynski J.F. Rose G.D. Science. 1986; 234: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Because they are positioned at protein surfaces, changes in the loop amino acid sequence, as well as changes in loop length, are generally less disruptive to the rest of the protein than changes made in residues in the protein core. Indeed, previous studies have found that large changes within loop regions rarely affect the ability of the protein to fold, although the function of the protein may be disrupted if the loop plays an important role in protein function (for review, see (5.Fetrow J.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 708-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar)). Thus, loop replacement or loop swap experiments are good methods with which to analyze the role that a loop plays in protein function; furthermore, the importance of loops for protein folding and stability can be determined by spectroscopic and crystallographic studies of loop replacement proteins(6.Murphy M.E.P. Fetrow J.S. Burton R.E. Brayer G.D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1429-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 7.Hynes T.R. Kautz R.A. Goodman M.A. Gill J.F. Fox R.O. Nature. 1989; 339: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The significance of -loop D, residues 70-84, to the structure and function of iso-1-cytochrome c of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is investigated here. Cytochrome c is a small protein found in the electron transport system of most organisms. Iso-1-cytochrome c shuttles electrons from cytochrome c reductase to cytochrome c oxidase within the inter-mitochondrial space(8.Pettigrew G.W. Moore G.R. Cytochromes c: Biological Aspects. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1987Crossref Google Scholar, 9.Salemme F.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 299-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). It also interacts with cytochrome c peroxidase, cytochrome b, and sulfite oxidase. Despite sequence variation, a general tertiary fold is found in c-type cytochromes from prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms(8.Pettigrew G.W. Moore G.R. Cytochromes c: Biological Aspects. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1987Crossref Google Scholar, 10.Timkovich R. Dolphin D. The Porphyrins. Academic Press, New York1979: 241-293Crossref Google Scholar). The overall tertiary fold consists of three α-helices, one at the amino terminus, one at the carboxyl terminus, and one near residues 60-64, and three or four -loops, surrounding a heme group that is covalently bound to the protein by two thioether linkages to cysteine residues(8.Pettigrew G.W. Moore G.R. Cytochromes c: Biological Aspects. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1987Crossref Google Scholar, 10.Timkovich R. Dolphin D. The Porphyrins. Academic Press, New York1979: 241-293Crossref Google Scholar). The positions of the -loops are conserved, although the loops are the major sites of insertions and deletions between family members from different species(11.Fetrow J.S. Cardillo T.S. Sherman F. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 6: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This general tertiary structure is depicted in Fig. 1. The advantage of studying mutations in S. cerevisiae cytochrome c is that mutants that affect the protein structure and those that affect the function can be distinguished in vivo. Because S. cerevisiae requires a functional cytochrome c to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources, function can be assayed by growth of mutant yeast strains on lactate, glycerol, or ethanol media(12.Schweingruber M.E. Sherman F. Stewart J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6577-6580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of holoprotein, cytochrome c to which the heme group is covalently attached, can be detected by whole cell difference spectroscopy following growth of cells in dextrose medium, regardless of the functionality of the protein(12.Schweingruber M.E. Sherman F. Stewart J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6577-6580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Elliott W.B. Margoliash E. Grove E.L. Perkins A.J. Developments in Applied Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1971: 125-140Crossref Google Scholar). A lack of holoprotein would indicate that a mutation has altered the fold or stability of apo- or holoprotein so that it is more readily proteolyzed or that it has disrupted a step in the biosynthetic processing of holocytochrome c, such as transcription in the nucleus, translation on free ribosomes, mitochondrial recognition and import, or recognition by cytochrome c heme lyase, the protein that covalently attaches heme to the apoprotein(14.Dumont M.E. Cardillo T.S. Hayes M.K. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5487-5496Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 15.Nicholson D.W. Hergersberg C. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19034-19042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous loop deletion and replacement experiments have been done on -loops in yeast iso-1-cytochrome c. That work established that deletion of a portion of loop A, residues 21-28, or loop D, residues 74-78, resulted in a complete deficiency of holocytochrome c protein; however, holoprotein was still produced when portions of two other loops, loops B and C, were deleted(11.Fetrow J.S. Cardillo T.S. Sherman F. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 6: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Replacement mutations at the loop A position yielded results similar to the loop replacement experiment results described for other proteins: the mutant proteins are altered in stability or function yet are still able to fold into a native-like holoprotein. In each loop A replacement mutant, a heme-bound native-like cytochrome molecule is found in the cell, although the protein is not always functional(6.Murphy M.E.P. Fetrow J.S. Burton R.E. Brayer G.D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1429-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 11.Fetrow J.S. Cardillo T.S. Sherman F. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 6: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the current study, loop D was the target of loop replacement experiments so that the role of this loop in protein function and structure could be studied. Here we describe a novel, rapid method for insertion of these mutations into the yeast genome at the wild type iso-1-cytochrome c (CYC1) locus. This protocol was developed so that the mutated cytochromes c are under the same regulatory controls as wild type cytochrome c, and only one copy of the mutant gene exists in the haploid yeast cell. Amino acids at the loop D position in yeast iso-1-cytochrome c were replaced by homologous loop residues from prokaryotic c-type cytochromes and by heterologous loops from other proteins. The ability of the mutant proteins to fold and function was tested in vivo. An in vivo competition study was designed to determine whether the mutated apoproteins could compete with wild type holoprotein production. Because none of the loop replacement mutations produced a folded protein, directed, random mutagenesis was applied to six highly conserved residues within loop D: Tyr-74, Ile-75, Pro-76, Gly-77, Thr-78, and Lys-79. (Five of these six residues are those that had previously been deleted in the loop D deletion mutation.) The sequence variability that is allowed in these residues while still producing a minimally functional cytochrome c was thus identified. Although random mutagenesis has previously been applied to interior residues and hydrophobic cores, this is the first description of random mutagenesis of a loop region in a protein and is a step toward identifying the importance of loop-loop and loop-protein interactions in the structure, folding, and function of globular proteins. The symbol CYC1 represents the wild type gene encoding iso-1-cytochrome c; CYC7 represents the locus encoding iso-2-cytochrome c. When compared with sequences of other c-type cytochromes, iso-1-cytochrome c has a five-residue extension at the amino terminus. In this paper, we follow the tradition of numbering iso-1-cytochrome c as it is aligned with tuna cytochrome c; thus, numbering begins at methionine residue −5 and ends with glutamic acid 103. Loop D is the -loop secondary structure, residues 70-84, in yeast iso-1-cytochrome c. In this study, loop D was replaced by structurally homologous loops from other cytochromes c and by heterologous loops from other proteins; the mutant proteins are designated RepD1-D4, where Rep symbolizes a loop replacement mutant, D denotes loop D, and the number represents the individual replacements designated in Table 1. Yeast strains generated by standard mutagenesis procedures (see below) are designated by a C followed by the strain number; thus C6 is the yeast strain encoding the wild type cytochrome c, and C93 is the yeast strain encoding wild type cytochrome c containing a cysteine to threonine mutation at residue 102 (C102T). Yeast strains generated by the directed, random mutagenesis protocol are designated by the oligonucleotide number (3R or 4R for Pro-76 and Gly-77, 8R for Thr-78 and Lys-79, or 9R for Tyr-74 and Ile-75) followed by the strain number.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The genotype of the strains used in this study are as follows: Escherichia coli HB101: supE44, hsdS20 (rBmB), recA13, ara-14, proA2, lacY1, galK2, rpsL20, xyl-5, mtl-1(16.Bolivar F.

Strain C93 is isogenic with C6 except that it contains the C102T mutation in the CYC1 gene, as described above. The E. coli plasmid, pYC17, containing a deletion of residues Tyr-74 through Thr-78 in loop D and the C102T mutation in iso-1-cytochrome c, was used for site-directed mutagenesis. This plasmid was created from the previously described parent plasmid pAB541 (containing the loop D deletion, residues 74-78), which was created from the wild type plasmid pAB458(11.Fetrow J.S. Cardillo T.S. Sherman F. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 6: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It contains an ampicillin resistance marker for selection in E. coli and an f1(IG) origin of replication so that single-stranded DNA can be produced after infection by R408 phage (18.Russel M. Kidd S. Kelley M.R. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). For incorporation of mutant cytochromes c in the CYC1 locus of the yeast genome, the yeast integration plasmid pYC30 was constructed from plasmid pAB571 (kindly provided by T. Cardillo). pYC30 contains an origin of replication and an ampicillin resistance gene for maintenance and selection in E. coli, a LEU2 marker for selection in yeast, and an f1(IG) origin of replication for single-stranded DNA production after R408 infection.

The 2.2-kilobase pair SalI-XhoI LEU2 fragment was inserted at the BglII site 515 bp from the start of the BamHI-EcoRI CYC1 fragment. The CYC1 fragment is flanked by MluI sites 262 bp upstream and 197 bp downstream of the beginning and end of the CYC1 locus, respectively.

Oligonucleotides were designed to replace loop D in yeast iso-1-cytochrome c with homologous loops from the prokaryote c-type cytochromes found in the organisms Pseudomonas aeruginosa (residues 50-61) and Paracoccus denitrificans (residues 80-99) and with heterologous loops from myoglobin (residues 37-50) and thermolysin (residues 214-219). The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the loop replacements are shown in Table 1. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer and purified as described by the Applied Biosystems protocol. Loop D mutations were created by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using a modification of the method of Kunkel et al.(19.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). Briefly, parent plasmid pYC17 was transformed into competent E. coli CJ236 cells, a dut, ung strain that utilizes uracil in place of thymidine during DNA replication(19.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). Uracil-incorporated single-stranded DNA was isolated by standard protocols (18.Russel M. Kidd S. Kelley M.R. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) 4 h after infection of CJ236 cells with phage R408. Each of the designed oligonucleotides was annealed to the single-stranded pYC17 DNA by heating to 85°C and slowly cooling to 29°C. This annealing mix was combined with an extension/ligation mix containing buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM MgCl, 5 mM ATP, 10 mM dithiothreitol, dNTP mix (2.5 mM each dNTP), T4 Gene 32 protein (5 ng/ml), T4 DNA polymerase, and T4 DNA ligase. Chemical suppliers were New England Biolabs, Boehringer Mannheim, and U. S. Biochemical Corp. The reaction was incubated sequentially on ice for 5 min, room temperature for 5 min, and then 37°C for 60 min, at which time a standard E. coli transformation was performed (20.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.25Google Scholar) using competent HB101 cells. Cells were plated on YT + ampicillin medium (0.8% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, and 50 mg/liter ampicillin). Colonies were screened by purification of the plasmid DNA using the alkaline lysis plasmid preparation (20.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.25Google Scholar) and then digested with selected restriction enzymes. Fragments were separated and analyzed by agarose or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Correct insertions resulted in an increase in the size of an AvaII band or a creation of a new restriction site. Positive candidates were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (U. S. Biochemical Corp. Sequenase kit) of NaOH-denatured plasmid DNA prepared by large scale plasmid preparation (Promega). To study the effects of the mutant cytochrome c under the same regulatory conditions as wild type CYC1, a fast, simple method to integrate and screen for the mutant gene at the yeast CYC1 locus was developed (Fig. 2). First, mutant cyc1 sequences were cloned into a yeast integration plasmid, pYC31, which contains BamHI-EcoRI fragment encompassing the CYC1 locus and the LEU2 marker inserted into the BglI site of this fragment, as described above. The MluI fragment of the plasmid containing the mutant cyc1 sequence was excised from FMC low melting agarose and ligated into pYC31, which had previously been linearized with MluI and dephosphorylated to prevent intramolecular re-ligation. Yeast cells of strain B7684, in which the CYC1 gene has been replaced with URA3 gene, were made competent by lithium acetate protocol (21.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1994: 13.7.1-13.7.2Google Scholar) and transformed with pYC31-derived plasmids linearized with BamHI. Transformants were plated on synthetic dextrose (SD) medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, without amino acids and ammonium sulfate; 2% dextrose; 2.2% ammonium sulfate) without leucine SD(-leu) to select for integration of the LEU2 marker through homologous recombination. Selected transformants were then screened on SD medium lacking uracil SD(-ura) for removal of the cyc1::URA3 fragment from the chromosome. Several yeast colonies that grew on SD(-leu) but not on SD(-ura) were selected, subcloned on YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose), restreaked on SD(-ura), SD(-leu), SD(-trp), and SD(-his) to check strain phenotype. The cyc1 locus of one or two of the colonies that tested correctly was sequenced. Yeast genomic DNA from haploid strains was isolated by a glass beads protocol (21.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1994: 13.7.1-13.7.2Google Scholar) and a first PCR was performed to amplify the CYC1 region of the yeast genomic DNA using the Promega PCR sequencing kit. The first PCR product was purified from nucleotides and primers with Millipore Ultrafree-MC-low binding cellulose filter and protocols supplied by the manufacturer. The purified PCR product was used as the DNA template in a second PCR using the Applied BioSystems Taq dideoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit. Sequencing reactions were run on an Applied Biosystems DNA Sequencer. For each mutant yeast strain, the entire length of the CYC1 locus was sequenced at least twice. Growth curves were done by modification of a previously published procedure(11.Fetrow J.S. Cardillo T.S. Sherman F. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 6: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The haploid yeast strains produced by the mutagenesis and integration procedures described above were crossed with B2111 and screened for their ability to grow on SD medium. Studying the loop D replacement mutations in diploid strains should eliminate the possibility of interference by background mutations and provide a system in which any effects on growth of the yeast strain can be directly accounted for by the changes made in the cytochrome c gene(12.Schweingruber M.E. Sherman F. Stewart J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6577-6580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An overnight culture was made by inoculating a single colony of the diploid cytochrome c mutant in YPD medium and growing overnight at 30°C. After growth for 16 h, the cultures were synchronized by placing them at 4°C overnight. Cells were centrifuged and rinsed with liquid lactate medium. Ten ml of liquid lactate medium in side arm flasks (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, without amino acids and ammonium sulfate; 1% lactate; 2% ammonium sulfate) was inoculated with a quantity of synchronized cells to start the culture at a density of exactly 8 Klett units (KU). Cell density was measured by a Klett-Summerson electric colorimeter. Culture flasks were shaken at 130 rpm at 25, 30, or 37°C, depending on the experiment, and cell density was measured at 3-4-h intervals over a 25-30-h period. Yeast strains C6 (wild type), C93 (wild type, C102T) and C15 (del cyc1) are isogenic with the experimental strains, except at the iso-1-cytochrome c locus. C6 and C93 were included as positive controls, and C15 was included as a negative control. Because reduced cytochrome c exhibits a characteristic absorbance peak at 548 nm, the relative amount of iso-1-cytochrome c present in the mutant yeast strains was determined by low temperature (−196°C) difference spectroscopy on an SLM-Aminco UV-visible DW2000 spectrophotometer. Liquid YPD medium was inoculated with a colony of mutant diploid yeast cells and grown overnight at 30°C. The growth stage of the cultures was synchronized by refrigeration at 4°C for 8 h. One ml of this stationary culture was used to inoculate 25 ml of YPD medium, and these cultures were grown at 25, 30, or 37°C with aeration for 15-16 h. Cultures were spun at 3,500 rpm for 3 min at 4°C, supernatant was discarded, and cells were washed with 10 ml of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. This wash procedure was repeated, and cells were resuspended in 0.8 ml of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. To control for the number of cells present in the sample, cell density was measured on a KlettSummerson colorimeter by making a 1:40 to 1:200 dilution of the stock cells in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. 250-μl samples, made from the stock cells, gave a cell density of 350 KU based on the cell density and dilution factor of the diluted cells. One 250-μl sample of stock cells was reduced with 25 μl of 13 mg/ml dithionite (sample), and another 250-μl sample of the stock cells was oxidized with 25 μl of 5% hydrogen peroxide (reference). Both sample and reference were then mixed with 250 μl of a saturated sucrose solution. Cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and a difference spectrum was recorded from 500 to 650 nm. Yeast strains C6 (wild type) and C93 (wild type, C102T) were included as positive controls representing 100% cytochrome c, and C15 (del cyc1) was studied as the negative control representing 0% cytochrome c. Immunoblotting was done to determine whether apoprotein was present in the loop D deletion and replacement mutants. Haploid yeast strains were grown for 15-16 h in YPD medium and then diluted by one-third with YPD medium and grown for approximately 2 h. Total yeast protein extracts were isolated by methods described previously(22.Yaffe M.P. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4819-4823Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). 0.16 ml of 1.85 M NaOH, 7.4% 2-mercaptoethanol mixture was added to 1 ml of cultures grown to the same culture density. After a 10-min incubation on ice, 0.16 ml of 50% trichloroacetic acid was added, and samples were placed on ice for a second 10-min incubation. After a brief spin, the pellets were washed with 1.5 ml of ice-cold acetone. Pellets were resuspended in 2 × sample buffer (4% SDS, 24% glycerol, 100 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% Sigma blue G dye). Samples were heated for 4 min at 95°C and spun to remove insoluble material. Equal volumes of samples were loaded on a denaturing Tricine-SDS polyacrylamide gel(23.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). For Western blots, proteins were transferred to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose sheets (Bio-Rad) and washed in blocking buffer (5% low fat dry milk in PBS-T (80 mM disodium hydrogen phosphate, 20 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 100 mM sodium chloride, and 0.1% Tween 20)). Blots were incubated with anti-cytochrome c rabbit serum, which recognizes both apo- and holocytochrome c (compliments of M. Dumont). Blots were washed with PBS-T and incubated further with anti-rabbit Ig, horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody (Amersham Corp.) for 30 min. Further washes with PBS-T were followed by detection with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Corp.). The blots were wrapped immediately in plastic wrap and exposed to autoradiography film (Fuji) for 1-5 min at room temperature. To analyze the ability of wild type apocytochrome c to be converted to holocytochrome c in the presence of mutant cytochrome c, haploid yeast strains containing the loop D replacement mutations were mated with a haploid yeast strain containing wild type cytochrome c (αGH6, CYC1). Diploid yeast strains were used in in vivo spectroscopic and growth assays (as described above) to determine levels of wild type cytochrome c which could be converted to holocytochrome c in the presence of mutant cytochrome c. Diploid strains with mutant cytochrome c and wild type (mutant/CYC1) were compared with diploid strains with cytochrome c deletion mutant and wild type protein (del cyc1/CYC1). Directed, random mutagenesis was performed essentially as described previously(24.Fumo G. Spitzer J.S. Fetrow J.S. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 164: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2017964873,"The rat basophilic cell line RBL-1 is known to express high levels of the Ca2+ current activated by store depletion, known as Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current (ICRAC), the main Ca2+ influx pathway so far identified in nonexcitable cells. We show here that, as reported in other cell types, metabolic drugs strongly inhibit the Ca2+ influx operated by store depletion in RBL-1 cells also. We have tested the hypothesis that intracellular adenine and/or guanine nucleotide levels act as coupling factors between ICRAC and cell metabolism. Using the whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique, we demonstrate that addition of ADP to the intracellular solution significantly reduces ICRAC induced by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. This phenomenon differs from other regulatory pathways of ICRAC, since it is highly temperature-dependent, is observable only in the presence of low intracellular Ca2+ buffering capacity, and requires a cytosolic factor(s) which is rapidly lost during cell dialysis. Moreover, the inhibition is specific for ADP and is partially mimicked by ADPbetaS and AMP, but not by GDP or GTP."
https://openalex.org/W1984184143,"Glucose stimulation raises the pH of pancreatic β-cells, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We have now investigated the acute effects of metabolizable (glucose and the mitochondrial substrate α-ketoisocaproic acid, KIC) and nonmetabolizable (high K and the K-ATP channel blocker tolbutamide) insulin secretagogues on the pH of pancreatic β-cells isolated from normal mice, as assessed by BCECF fluorescence from single cells or islets in the presence of external bicarbonate. The typical acute effect of glucose (22-30 mM) on the pH was a fast alkalinization of approximately 0.11 unit, followed by a slower acidification. The relative expression of the alkalinizing and acidifying components was variable, with some cells and islets displaying a predominant alkalinization, others a predominant acidification, and others yet a mixed combination of the two. The initial alkalinization preceded the [Ca] rise associated with the activation of voltage-sensitive Ca channels. There was a significant overlap between the glucose-evoked [Ca] rise and the development of the secondary acidification. Depolarization with 30 mM K and tolbutamide evoked pronounced [Ca] rises and concomitant cytosolic acidifications. Blocking glucose-induced Ca influx (with 0 Ca, nifedipine, or the K-ATP channel agonist diazoxide) suppressed the secondary acidification while having variable effects (potentiation or slight attenuation) on the initial alkalinization. KIC exerted glucose-like effects on the pH and [Ca], but the amplitude of the initial alkalinization was about twice as large for KIC relative to glucose. It is concluded that the acute effect of glucose on the pH of pancreatic β-cells is biphasic. While the initial cytosolic alkalinization is an immediate consequence of the activation of H-consuming metabolic steps in the mitochondria, the secondary acidification appears to originate from enhanced Ca turnover in the cytoplasm. The degree of coupling between glucose metabolism and Ca influx as well as the relative efficacies of these processes determines whether the acute pH response of a β-cell (or of a tightly coupled multicellular system such as an islet of Langerhans) is predominantly an alkalinization, an acidification, or a mixed proportion of the two.

Pancreatic β-cells are endocrine cells specialized in the synthesis and secretion of insulin. Physiological release of the hormone is the result of a complex sequence of biophysical and biochemical events, involving entry of glucose through the GLUT-2 transporter, metabolic degradation of glucose to yield ATP, inhibition of ATP-sensitive K (K-ATP) channels following a rise in the cytosolic concentration of the nucleotide, membrane depolarization, activation of voltage-sensitive Ca channels, rises in the cytosolic free Ca concentration ([Ca]), protein phosphorylation, and subsequent steps leading to exocytosis (for reviews, see (1.Wollheim C.B.

The study of the modulation of cellular function by cytosolic pH (pH) has drawn a great deal of interest in many different cell types including pancreatic β-cells. Experimental maneuvers thought to cause changes in the pH of pancreatic β-cells have long been known to affect insulin secretion(4.Smith J.S. Pace C.S.

Several effector systems in the β-cell are either known or suspected to be pH-sensitive in the physiological range. For example, the key glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase is strongly pH-sensitive (acidification depresses the activity of the enzyme(14.Busa W.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar)). Furthermore, K-ATP channel activity in β-cells is exquisitely sensitive to pH changes around the physiological levels (alkalinization above resting pH enhances channel activity while acidification depresses it(15.Misler S. Gillis K. Tabcharani J. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 109: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16.Proks P. Takano M. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 475: 33-44Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar)). This may in fact explain why glucose-induced electrical activity is so sensitive to the pH changes imposed by the administration of weak acids and bases. Indeed, cytosolic alkalinization causes membrane hyperpolarization and inhibition of electrical activity while cytosolic acidification is thought to cause symmetric changes on these parameters (11.Pace C.S.

Interestingly, in the absence of functional K-ATP channels (for example, in the presence of sulfonylureas and high external Ca concentrations), the cytosolic alkalinizing agent NHCl evokes changes on bursting electrical activity which appear to be the mirror image of those evoked under regular conditions(20.Barbosa R.M.

In a follow-up study(13.Juntti-Berggren L. Civelek V.N. Berggren P.-O. Schultz V. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. J. Biol.

In a very recent study using bicarbonate-containing solutions, Shepherd and Henquin (29.Shepherd R.M. Henquin J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7915-7921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) reported sustained pH rises in response to glucose, which could be suppressed by DIDS, a blocker of the Na-dependent HCO/Cl exchanger, and strongly attenuated (although in the intermediate-high glucose concentration range only) by replacing the external solution for a bicarbonate-free solution. These effects were interpreted assuming that, in the presence of bicarbonate and high glucose, the DIDS-sensitive exchanger overcompensates and opposes an acidifying tendency associated with Ca influx and accumulation in the cytosol(29.Shepherd R.M. Henquin J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7915-7921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester of BCECF cytosolic free Ca concentration acetoxymethyl ester of fura-2 ATP-sensitive K channel α-ketoisocaproic acid 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid cytosolic pH 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid. Using single cells and islets exposed to a physiological (bicarbonate-containing) buffer, we have now assessed the possibility that an acidifying mechanism linked to the stimulation of Ca influx might contribute to the short-term effect of glucose on the cytosolic pH of pancreatic β-cells. Furthermore, we have compared the effects of glucose and KIC, a metabolic substrate that feeds directly the mitochondria, with the purpose of assessing the role of mitochondrial metabolism in the glucose-evoked pHresponses. The results indicate that the typical acute pHresponse of mouse pancreatic β-cells to glucose is a transient rapid alkalinization, followed by a slower acidification. While the initial alkalinization is an immediate consequence of the activation of mitochondrial metabolism, the secondary acidification is probably linked to enhanced turnover (influx followed by active extrusion and/or accumulation in organelles) of Ca in the cytoplasm. Islet isolation and culture were carried out essentially as described previously(31.Wollheim C.B. Meda P. Halban P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 188-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), with some modifications(32.Silva A.M. Rosário L.M. Santos R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17095-17103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 3- to 6-month-old female albino mice (Charles River Breeding Laboratories) weighing 28-40 g were killed by cervical dislodgement, and the islets were isolated by collagenase (type P, Boehringer Mannheim) digestion of the pancreas. For culture, the islets were transferred into sterile RPMI 1640-based medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin), pH adjusted to 7.2 with NaOH to give 7.4 in the incubator. Collagenase-isolated mouse islets (700-1200 islets from 6 pancreata) were hand-picked and transferred into an Eppendorf tube containing Ca- and Mg-free medium supplemented with 1 mM EGTA (in mM: 112.6 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 NaSO, 20 NaHCO, 1.2 NaHPO, 16 HEPES, pH 7.4). The islets were washed twice in this medium, allowed to incubate for 10-15 min, and finally dissociated into cells by trypsinization with 0.05% trypsin, as described previously(31.Wollheim C.B. Meda P. Halban P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 188-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cell viability, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion, was typically higher than 90%. The dispersed cells were finally resuspended in RPMI 1640-based medium, aliquoted into glass coverslips which had been coated previously with 100 μg/ml poly-L-lysine (Sigma) and stored in Petri dishes at 37°C in a 5% CO, 95% air incubator. The cells were allowed to attach to the coverslips for about 2-3 h, after which fresh culture medium was added to the Petri dishes. The standard salt solution used in the microfluorescence experiments had the following composition (mM): 125 NaCl, 5 KCl, 25 NaHCO, 2.56 CaCl, 1.1 MgCl. This solution was supplemented with different concentrations of glucose or KIC, as required, and constantly gassed with 95% O/5% CO for a final pH of 7.4. The solutions used to calibrate fura-2 fluorescence in terms of [Ca] were as described previously(32.Silva A.M. Rosário L.M. Santos R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17095-17103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Castro E. Tomé A.R. Miras-Portugal M.T. Rosário L.M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 426: 524-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The solutions used to calibrate BCECF fluorescence in terms of pH had the following composition (mM): 100 KCl, 10 NaCl, 1 MgCl, and 10 MOPS (pH adjusted to different values with KOH or HCl). Cells attached to coverslips were washed in physiological salt solution supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then loaded with 4 μM fura-2/AM and/or 2 μM BCECF/AM for 60 min at 37°C in this medium. Groups of 4-8 islets were typically incubated in the original culture medium supplemented with 4 μM fura-2/AM or 1 μM BCECF/AM for 45 min at 37°C. The loaded islets were then transferred into a small (34 μl) fast perifusion chamber placed on the stage of an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Diaphot). The bottom of the chamber was coated previously with poly-L-lysine to facilitate islet attachment, which was usually achieved in less than 10 min under stationary conditions. Experiments involving isolated cells were carried out using the original cell-containing coverslips as bottoms for the perifusion chamber. The temperature and flow rate in the chamber were 37°C and approximately 2 ml/min, respectively. The perifusion system used in the experiments and the respective temperature control stages have been described previously in detail (33.Castro E. Tomé A.R. Miras-Portugal M.T. Rosário L.M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 426: 524-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The [Ca] and the pH were recorded from single cells or islets using a dual excitation microfluorescence system (Deltascan, Photon Technology International, Princeton, NJ), essentially as described previously for single islets and single chromaffin cells(20.Barbosa R.M. Salgado A.P. Santos R.M. Rosário L.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 32.Silva A.M. Rosário L.M. Santos R.M. J. Biol.

Briefly, single cells or islets were alternately excited at 340/380 nm (for [Ca] measurements) or at 440/500 nm (for pH measurements) via two monochromators. The fluorescence was detected by a photomultiplier after passing through a band pass interference filter centered at 510 ([Ca] measurements) or 535 nm (pH measurements). The data were automatically corrected for background fluorescence and acquired at 10 Hz by a 386SX/16 MHz computer. The measuring field was routinely centered on the cell or islet of interest by means of a rectangular diaphragm placed on the emission path. Cells which have been double-labeled with fura-2 and BCECF (for combined [Ca] and pH measurements) were stimulated twice with glucose or KIC, first in the [Ca]- and then in the pH-recording mode. This was because the available beam splitting equipment did not allow the use of more than two different excitations wavelengths at a time. Inner filter effects (resulting in faint fura-2 fluorescence) did not allow combined [Ca] and pH measurements to be carried out from single islets. In control experiments, the pH proved to be extremely sensitive to medium pH and to the flow rate of the perifusion solution. While the medium pH was strictly and permanently monitored (and corrected by forced CO gassing if necessary) prior to perifusion, regular checks were carried out to make sure that the flow rate did not change significantly upon changing the solutions. The fluorescence ratio F/F was converted into pH values using an in vitro calibration procedure, as follows. Fluorescence excitation spectra were recorded from droplets of MOPS-buffered BCECF (1 μM) solutions, under conditions equivalent to those used for the recording of intracellular dye fluorescence. A calibration curve of F/Fversus pH was obtained after applying the latter procedure to different calibration solutions in the pH range 6.5-7.8. The calibration data were fitted to a linear function, and the respective fitting parameters used to read the pH values off the calibration curve. For identical monochromator slits, the BCECF fluorescence recorded from single cells at 440 nm was typically very low compared to that at 500 nm, resulting in noisy F/F (or calibrated pH) records. In the single cell experiments we have minimized this noise by increasing the exit slit of the excitation monochromator yielding the F signal, as required. This strategy was, however, not feasible in the case of the single islet experiments, presumably owing to differential inner filter effects at the two excitation wavelengths. To reduce the noise associated with the ratiometric fluorescence recording from single islets, we have resorted to replacing the F data for a computer-generated polynomial function with a virtually identical time course. The fluorescence ratio F/F was converted into [Ca] values using the calibration equation of Grynkiewicz et al.(35.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), as described previously by our laboratory(32.Silva A.M. Rosário L.M. Santos R.M. J. Biol.

Antibiotics and RPMI 1640 medium were from Biological Industries (Beth Haemeck, Israel). Except where otherwise indicated, all other chemicals were from Sigma. All results (text and figures) were expressed as mean ± S.D. The plots in the figures were generated using commercially available software (Sigma Plot, Jandel Scientific). We have measured the intracellular pH from single mouse islets of Langerhans using the fluorescent probe BCECF. The average resting pH in the presence of 3 mM glucose was 7.01 ± 0.07 (± S.D., n = 49 islets). The effects of raising glucose concentration from 3 to 22 mM on the pH are depicted in Fig. 1A. The typical pH response was an initial alkalinization of approximately 0.11 unit, followed by a slower acidifying phase (e.g.. islets 2 and 3 in Fig. 1A). This pattern was representative of 69% of the islets examined (34 out of 49 islets). The glucose-evoked pH responses were highly variable from islet to islet, with some islets (21%, i.e. 11 out of 49 islets; e.g. islet 1) actually displaying a pure alkalinizing phase while others (8%, i.e. 4 out of 49 islets; e.g. islet 4) displayed a predominant acidifying phase with residual signs of alkalinization. It is also noteworthy that islets displaying a multiphasic pH response to glucose exhibited a mixed proportion of the alkalinizing and acidifying components. For example, while in some islets (e.g. islet 2 in Fig. 1A) the pH remained close to or distinctly above the resting level after 4-6-min exposures to high glucose, in other islets (e.g. islet 3) the pH dropped to near-baseline levels or even below baseline during continued stimulation with high glucose. The maximal amplitude of the alkalinizing phase (difference between peak and basal pH), measured from experiments displaying either multiphasic pH responses (initial alkalinization, followed by a pronounced acidifying phase), a pure alkalinizing phase, or a predominant acidifying phase with residual alkalinization in response to 22 mM glucose, was 0.11 ± 0.05 (n = 26 islets) 2The computation of accurate response amplitude, time lag, and time-to-peak values required single islet experiments where the basal BCECF fluorescence ratio did not undergo any evident spontaneous drift. This was, however, not the case for a fraction of the overall pool of valid pH experiments. Indeed, there were occasions when the basal pH was found to be drifting, albeit not at such a high rate that it would compromise the whole experiment. Moreover, in several other experiments, the pH was recorded from glucose-stimulated islets that had been subjected to a previous glucose challenge (after an appropriate recovery time in 3 mM glucose). While these experiments have been taken into account for the calculation of average resting pH and for qualitative assessment of pH response patterns, they were not used for the computation of amplitude, time lag, or time-to-peak values since these parameters are expected to be critically sensitive to glucose priming (see below). Thus, the estimation of these parameters was made from a smaller pool (n = 20 or 26 islets) of valid pH experiments than that used for qualitative assessment and for the estimation of average resting pH (n = 49 islets).; in these experiments, the alkalinizing phase occurred 31 ± 10 s after the beginning of the stimulus. The time-to-peak of the initial alkalinization, measured from experiments displaying either multiphasic pH responses or a predominant acidifying phase, averaged 85 ± 30 s (n = 20 islets). The islets displayed a heterogenous off response to glucose. Thus, while in most of the islets examined, the pH was slowly and monophasically recovered to baseline levels following the decrease in glucose concentration from 22 to 3 mM (e.g. islet 1 in Fig. 1A), in other cases, the pH transiently overshot the levels reached during stimulation before it finally declined to baseline (e.g. islets 2 and 3). Using separate islets labeled with the Ca indicator fura-2, we have characterized the effects of high glucose on the [Ca] with the main aim of assessing the physiological responsiveness of the islet pool used for the pH experiments. Examples of typical responses are shown in Fig. 1B. Raising glucose concentration from 3 to 22 mM typically resulted in a drop of [Ca] below baseline lasting 1-3 min (average 88 ± 24 s, n = 12 islets). This was followed by a pronounced [Ca] rise, after which the [Ca] either remained elevated (albeit with oscillations, e.g. islets 5 and 8 in Fig. 1B) or declined to lower levels (e.g. islets 6 and 7) during continued stimulation with high glucose. In these experiments, the time-to-peak and the maximal amplitude of the [Ca] responses were 270 ± 58 s and 133 ± 68 nM (n = 12 islets), respectively. Removal of the high glucose stimulus was often accompanied by a transient accentuation of the oscillatory behavior. The pH and the [Ca] experiments depicted in Fig. 1 suggest that maximal alkalinization might occur at a time when the [Ca] remains low or even below baseline in response to the glucose challenge. Since, owing to inner filter effects (see “Experimental Procedures”), the pH and the [Ca] cannot be recorded from the same islets, we have double-labeled isolated β-cells with BCECF and fura-2, aiming at investigating the relationship between glucose-evoked pH and [Ca] changes at the single cell level. Due to the specificity of the available microfluorescence detection system, the pH and the [Ca] recordings were carried out in sequence, rather than simultaneously. In the following experiments, the cells were typically subjected to 30 mM glucose pulses for 4-6 min in the [Ca] recording mode, allowed to recover for at least 11 min in basal (2 mM) glucose, and finally subjected to an identical high glucose pulse in the pH recording mode. Identification of the monitored cells as β-cells relied on the specific responsiveness of the latter to blockers of the K-ATP channel, e.g. the sulfonylurea tolbutamide(36.Wesslen N. Pipeleers D.G. Van de Winkel M. Rorsman P. Hellman B. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1987; 131: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, we have routinely stimulated the cells with 250 μM tolbutamide at the beginning of each experiment and considered a pronounced [Ca] response to the sulfonylurea as evidence that the monitored cell was indeed a β-cell (see Fig. 4B for a typical response). Fig. 2A (traces labeled with a single asterisk) shows that most β-cells responded to the high glucose pulse with a small and transient fall in [Ca], which was followed by a pronounced rise toward a level several hundreds of nanomolars above baseline. It is also apparent that both the onset and the time course of the glucose-evoked [Ca] rises were highly variable from cell to cell. These characteristics are similar to what has been described previously for rat and ob/ob mouse β-cells(37.Herchuelz A. Pochet R. Pastiels C. Van"

https://openalex.org/W2057294744,"The stimulatory guanine nucleotide binding protein (G) is heterotrimeric (αβ), and mediates activation of adenylyl cyclase by a ligand-receptor complex. The α subunit of G (Gα) has a guanine nucleotide binding site, and activation occurs when tightly bound GDP is displaced by GTP. Together, GDP and fluoroaluminate (AlF) form a transition state analog of GTP that activates G. The work of other investigators suggests that AlF causes subunit dissociation when it activates G. We have observed that in solution AlF did not cause G subunits to dissociate unless NaCl was also present. The effect of NaCl was concentration dependent (10-200 mM). Omitting F, Al, or Mg prevented the NaCl-induced dissociation of G subunits. NaSO could not substitute for NaCl in causing subunit dissociation, but KCl could, suggesting that the anion was responsible for the effect. G subunit reassociation occurred when the concentration of Cl was reduced even though the concentrations of AlF and Mg were maintained. The absence of Cl did not prevent AlF binding to Gα. We have concluded that AlF, a ligand which is capable of activating G proteins, can bind to G in solution without causing subunit dissociation."

Polypeptides of 25, 50, and 70 kilodaltons were found to associate with the Fas intracellular domain, and this binding was stable in the presence of 1 M NaCl. These interactions were also detected using a mouse Fas fusion protein containing an Ile to Asn mutation, which is responsible for a lymphoproliferative disorder in certain strains of mice (lpr). Furthermore, the binding of cellular proteins to Fas could be blocked upon incubation with a polyclonal antibody directed against the cytoplasmic domain of Fas.

Polypeptides of 25, 50, and 70 kilodaltons were found to associate with the Fas intracellular domain, and this binding was stable in the presence of 1 M NaCl. These interactions were also detected using a mouse Fas fusion protein containing an Ile to Asn mutation, which is responsible for a lymphoproliferative disorder in certain strains of mice (lpr). Furthermore, the binding of cellular proteins to Fas could be blocked upon incubation with a polyclonal antibody directed against the cytoplasmic domain of Fas. The strong association of cellular proteins with the cytoplasmic region implies that constitutive interactions may exist to regulate apoptotic signaling through the Fas antigen. The activation of the Fas/APO-1 antigen by the Fas ligand or specific agonist antibodies results in a rapid induction of apoptosis(1.Traut B.C. Klas C. Peters A.M.J. Matzku S. Moller P. Falk W.

The resulting condensation and fragmentation of nuclei, loss of plasma membrane, and cell shrinkage are common morphological features of the apoptotic process. Analysis of a mouse lymphoproliferation mutation, lpr, provides genetic evidence that the Fas molecule is critically involved in T-cell regulation(4.Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nagata S. Nature. 1992; 356: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2696) Google Scholar). The lpr mutation has been mapped to a point mutation in the cytoplasmic domain of the mouse Fas antigen, which abrogates its ability to initiate apoptosis(4.Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Brannan C.I.

The Fas antigen is a member of a large family of cell surface molecules, which includes the p55 and p75 TNF 1The abbreviations used are: TNFtumor necrosis factorGSTglutathione S-transferaseIPTGisopropylthiogalactosidePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoridePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisFDFas deletionPCRpolymerase chain reactionTBSTTris-buffered saline/Tween 20.receptors, CD27, CD30, CD40, the lymphotoxin-β receptor, and the p75 neurotrophin receptor(6.Smith C.A.

Today. 1992; 13: 151-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). While the homology among these receptors has been dictated primarily by similar extracellular cysteine-rich repeats, functional analysis of the p55 TNF receptor and the Fas antigen in transducing apoptosis has defined a cytoplasmic region of 89 amino acids, which has been designated the “cell death” domain(5.Itoh N.

Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). A similar sequence has also been discovered in the cytoskeletal protein ankyrin and in a number of proteins that bind to Fas and the p55 TNF receptor death domains. These proteins, MORT1/FADD(9.Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol.

Each protein can independently initiate cell death when transiently overexpressed in heterologous cells. The ubiquitous expression patterns of these proteins, the finding of a similar motif in ankyrin, and in vitro analysis (9.Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J.

The biochemical mechanisms responsible for Fas action are incompletely understood. An acidic sphingomyelinase activity is induced upon cross-linking of Fas with monoclonal antibodies in U937 cells (13.Cifone M.G. DeMaria R. Roncaioli P. Rippo M.R. Azuma M. Lanier L.L. Santoni A. Testi R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 177: 1547-1552Crossref Scopus (594) Google Scholar) that gives rise to higher intracellular ceramide levels. A similar activity has also been detected upon TNF-α binding to the p55 TNF receptor(14.Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Weigmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar); however, recent evidence suggests an important role for a neutral sphingomyelinase in Fas and p55 TNF receptor signal transduction. In addition, cellular tyrosine phosphorylation is increased within minutes after engagement of the Fas antigen in Jurkat and U937 cells(15.Eischen C.M. Dick C.J. Leibson P.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1947-1954PubMed Google Scholar). The potential involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation in Fas signal transduction is supported by the identification of FAP-1/BAS, a protein tyrosine phosphatase, which negates Fas-mediated apoptosis(16.Sato T. Irie S. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The effects of FAP-1 upon anti-Fas antibody-induced cell death have been mapped to an interaction of FAP-1 with the C terminus of the Fas antigen, a region known to attenuate Fas-mediated apoptosis(5.Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the cytoplasmic domain is clearly necessary for Fas to function as a receptor (4.Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nagata S. Nature. 1992; 356: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2696) Google Scholar, 5.Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and numerous binding interactions have been defined for Fas(17.Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 479-482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), we have investigated the binding properties of the intracellular domain of Fas using recombinant fusion proteins. Our results indicate that strong protein-protein associations exist that map to distinct regions of the Fas molecule. The protein binding interactions are specific, because an anti-Fas antibody can effectively block the binding. Surprisingly, the predominant binding interactions are still observed in a cytoplasmic Fas mutation (lpr), suggesting the Fas receptor can participate in constitutive protein-protein interactions that regulate its apoptotic function. The mouse Fas cDNA (courtesy of S. Nagata) was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV5 using BglII and ClaI sites in the polylinker. The resulting pCMV5-mFas plasmid was purified by alkaline lysis and equilibrium centrifugation through a CsCl gradient. All GST fusion bacterial expression constructs were prepared using the pGSTag vector(18.Ron D. Dressler H. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-869PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion mutants of the Fas wild-type cytoplasmic sequence similar to those described by Itoh and Nagata (5.Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were generated by PCR. The Fas deletion (FD) mutants were obtained by using a common 5′ primer (5′-CGGGATCCAATGCCTCAAATCTTAGCT-3′), unique 3′ primers (FD2, 5′-GCTCTAGATCATCGAGCAAATTTTTTAGCTTC-3′; FD4, 5′-GCTCTAGATCAACCCTTGATTAAATCTTGATA-3′; FD5, 5′-GCTCTAGATCATGATTTTCCAAGGTCCTTCTG-3′; FD7, 5′-GCTCTAGATCATCTGCGACATTCGGCTTTTTT-3′; FD8, 5′-GCTCTAGATCAGTCCTGAAATTTATCTAAGGT-3′), and pCMV5-mFas as a template. The reaction mix contained the 5′ primer (1 ng/μl), 3′ primer (1 ng/μl), pCMV5-mFas (1 ng/μl), 1.25 unit of cloned Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), 1 × Pfu polymerase buffer, and 200 nM dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP in 100 μl. After 30 cycles (melting for 1 min at 94°C; annealing for 1.5 min at 50°C; extension for 1 min at 72°C), the PCR reactions were subjected to an additional 8-min incubation at 72°C. Each reaction mix was then incubated with 0.2% SDS at 65°C for 15 min followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Each PCR reaction yielded a single product that was subsequently isolated by gel purification, cut with BamHI and XbaI, and ligated into pGSTag using T4 ligase. Ligation reactions were used for transformation of SG1117 Escherichia coli, which were selected on LB-ampicillin agar plates. Positive clones were screened by restriction analysis, DNA sequencing, and IPTG-inducible GST-fusion protein expression. The GST fusion bacterial expression construct containing the Ile to Asn point mutation at residue 225 as found in lpr mice was generated with two sets of PCR primers: set 1 (5′ primer, 5′-CGGGATCCATGCCTCAAATCTTAGCT-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-ATTTTCTCGAGCAAATTT-3′); set 2 (5′ primer, 5′-TTTGCTCGAGAAAATAACAACAAGA-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-GCTCTAGATCACTCCAGACATTGTCCTTCATT-3′); a point mutation (A) found in the lpr form of mouse Fas is indicated. PCR using each set of primers was carried out independently as described above with the exception that for primer set 2 Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) was used in order to introduce the point mutation in the PCR product. The PCR products were isolated and analyzed as described above. The PCR product from primer set 1 was digested with BamHI and XhoI; the PCR product from primer set 2 was digested with XbaI and XhoI. After isolation by gel purification, the PCR products from primer set 1 and set 2 were incubated with pGSTag (BamHI- and XbaI-digested), ligated using T4 ligase, and used for transformation into SG1117 E. coli. The clones were verified by restriction analysis, DNA sequencing, and IPTG-inducible protein expression. A mFas expression construct encoding amino acids 221-306 fused to GST (GST-mFas-(221-306)) was generated as follows. The pCMV5-mFas vector was first digested with XhoI and the resulting fragment isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The single-stranded ends were filled using Klenow DNA polymerase and the fragment recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The fragment was then cut with SalI, isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Similarly, pGSTag was digested with XhoI, gel-purified, incubated with Klenow fragment to polish the ends, phenol/chloroform-extracted and ethanol-precipitated, digested with SalI, and gel-purified. The digested mFas fragment and pGSTag were then incubated with T4 ligase. The ligation reaction was then used to transform SG1117 E. coli and plated onto LB-ampicillin agar plates. Clones were confirmed by restriction analysis, DNA sequencing, and IPTG-inducible protein expression. E. coli carrying the pGSTag constructs were grown until the bacterial cultures reached midlogarithmic growth phase (0.4-0.5 A). IPTG was then added to 0.1 mM, and the cultures were incubated for 6 h further at 20°C. GST protein was purified from cultures incubated at 37°C for 3 h. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 15 min, the pellets resuspended in 20 ml of Buffer A (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, and 25 μg/ml PMSF), and bacteria disrupted using a probe sonicator. Lysed bacteria were centrifuged at 3500 × g for 10 min at 4°C to remove insoluble debris. Each supernatant was incubated with 1 ml of Sepharose-GSH (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 30 min at 4°C while rotating gently. The Sepharose matrix was recovered by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 2 min at 4°C and washed twice with 10 ml of Buffer A. The matrix was then washed twice with 10 ml of Buffer B (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, and 25 μg/ml PMSF), equilibrated with 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, packed into a disposable Bio-Rad column, and eluted in 0.5-ml fractions with 20 mM GSH, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0. Protein assays were performed on the fractions (Bio-Rad) and protein-containing fractions analyzed on SDS-PAGE to ensure the integrity of the GST-fusion proteins. Fusion proteins were stored at 4°C in the presence of 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM dithiothreitol. In order to remove the glutathione in the protein preparations, GST and GST-fusion proteins were passed over a Sephadex G-25 column and collected in fractions. Fractions containing protein were pooled and used for incubations with metabolically labeled cellular lysates (see below). All cell lines were cultured at 37°C in 5% CO. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum; L929 cells were grown in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts + 10% horse serum; and Jurkat and Hut78 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 + 10% fetal calf serum (heat-inactivated). All cultures were maintained in the presence of 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HeLa and L929 cells were grown on tissue culture dishes; Jurkat and Hut78 cells were grown in suspension in tissue culture flasks. HeLa and L929 cells were passaged upon reaching confluence; Jurkat and Hut78 cells were passaged upon reaching approximately 1-2 × 106 cells/ml. Metabolic labeling was performed using Express label [S]methionine and -cysteine (DuPont NEN). HeLa and L929 cells were grown until the cultures reached 70-80% confluence on 10-cm tissue culture dishes. Jurkat and Hut78 cells were also grown on 10-cm tissue culture dishes at 10 × 106/plate. The cells were then washed twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and then washed with 2 ml of methionine- and cysteine-free medium. The cells were then incubated at 37°C in 5 ml of methionine- and cysteine-free medium for 20 min in order to reduce intracellular stores of methionine and cysteine. To each plate of cells, [S]methionine and -cysteine were added to 0.1 mCi/ml, and the cells were incubated for 3 h at 37°C. After labeling, the S-containing medium was removed, and the cells were washed 4 times with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. HeLa and L929 cells were isolated by scraping. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 900 × g and lysed for 10 min on ice in Lysis Buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, and 25 μg/ml PMSF) and vortexed briefly. The lysed cells were then centrifuged at 900 × g for 3 min to remove insoluble debris. Supernatants were removed and stored at −80°C until use. In experiments where anti-GST-mFas or anti-GST IgG were preincubated with the GST-fusion proteins prior to the addition of lysates, 2-mercaptoethanol was not present in the Lysis Buffer used to lyse or wash the protein complexes. Cell lysates from S-labeled cells were thawed and precleared with 50 μl of Sepharose-GSH (Sepharose-GSH/Lysis Buffer, 1:1 v/v) and 25 μg GST for 2 h at 4°C. The Sepharose matrix was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The supernatants were subsequently incubated with 50 μl of Sepharose-GSH (Sepharose-GSH/Lysis Buffer, 1:1 v/v) and 10 μg of GST protein or the GST-fusion protein for 2 h at 4°C. The matrix was recovered by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge, and the supernatants were discarded. The matrix was washed 4 times with 1 ml of ice-cold Lysis Buffer, followed by 2 washes with 1 ml of 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0. The GST- or GST-fusion protein was then eluted from the Sepharose-GSH matrix by incubating twice with 50 μl of 20 mM GSH, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0 (10-min incubation at room temperature) and isolated by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm and pooling the supernatants. To 100 μl of eluate, 25 μl of 5 × SDS-PAGE buffer was added, and each preparation was heated to 100°C for 5 min. Equal volumes of the preparations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography (ENHANCE, DuPont NEN). The dried gels were exposed to radiographic film for 2-10 days at −80°C. The binding assay to GST or GST-mFas-(194-306) and analysis of associated cellular proteins were performed as described above except for the presence of different salt concentrations in the Lysis Buffer used to wash the protein complexes on the matrix. After incubation of precleared lysates with GST or GST-mFas-(194-306), the Sepharose matrix was subjected to washes with Lysis Buffer containing 200, 300, 400, 500, or 1000 mM NaCl. The remaining proteins were eluted with 20 mM GSH and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography as described above. Polyclonal antibodies were prepared in rabbits using either GST or the GST-mFas-(221-306) fusion protein as the immunogen. IgG was prepared from serum using Sepharose-protein A as described previously(19.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The concentration of IgG was quantitated by protein assay (Bio-Rad) and stored at −80°C until use. Purified GST-mFas-(221-306) (1 μg) was incubated with bovine thrombin (Sigma) at 0.01 unit/μl in Thrombin Buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 2.5 mM CaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol) for 2 h at 37°C. This was loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE along with 1 μg of GST and GST-mFas-(221-306) (no thrombin cleavage). The separated proteins were then blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked using 10% dry milk/TBST for 1 h at 4°C, followed by anti-GST-Fas serum at a 1:1000 dilution in 1% dry milk/TBST for 1 h at 4°C and goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (Boehringer Mannheim) at a 1:5,000 dilution in 1% dry milk/TBST for 1 h at 4°C. The blot was developed using ECL (Amersham Corp.). The binding assay to GST or GST-mFas-(194-306) and analysis of associated cellular proteins was performed as described above, except that labeled lysates were prepared without 2-mercaptoethanol. Anti-GST or anti-GST-mFas at 10, 33, or 100 μg was preincubated with 50 μl of Sepharose-GSH (Sepharose-GSH/Lysis Buffer, 1:1, v/v) and 10 μg of GST-mFas-(194-306) for 30 min at 4°C. Binding assays and analysis of associated cellular proteins were performed as described above. The cytoplasmic domain of the Fas antigen contains an 89-amino acid motif (residues 204-292) required for antibody-induced apoptosis in murine L929 cells(5.Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize potential binding interactions of the intracellular sequence of mFas, a series of glutathione S-transferase proteins were prepared that contained different sequences from the cytoplasmic domain of the mouse Fas antigen. Fig. 1 shows the FD mutants, which are based upon the work of Itoh and Nagata (5.Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who assessed the cytotoxic activities of the human Fas deletion mutants after transfection in murine L929 cells. The GST-mFas FD mutants share a common N terminus fused in frame to GST but differ by sequential deletions at the C terminus of the mFas intracellular domain. The longest construct, GST-mFas-(194-306), contained part of the juxtamembrane domain (amino acids 194-203), the entire death domain (amino acids 204-292), and the C-terminal region (amino acids 293-306). The last 14 amino acids define an inhibitory domain by analogy to studies performed with the human Fas antigen(5.Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two other constructs, GST-mFas-(221-306) and GST-mFas lpr, were also generated. The fusion protein, GST-mFas-(221-306), differs from GST-mFas-(194-306) by lacking 27 amino acids at the N terminus of the mFas coding region that includes 17 amino acids of the death domain (Fig. 1). The GST-mFas lpr construct represents a protein with identical primary structure to GST-mFas-(194-306) except for a single amino acid change at residue 225, where an isoleucine was replaced by an asparagine residue (Fig. 1). Certain strains of mice carrying this mutation in the Fas antigen develop lymphadenopathy and an autoimmune syndrome. This point mutation has been shown to interfere with the ability of Fas to transmit an apoptotic signal(4.Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nagata S. Nature. 1992; 356: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2696) Google Scholar). A variety of Fas-responsive cell lines have been defined, in which expression of Fas antigen results in the initiation of apoptosis upon cross-linking the receptor with agonist antibody(1.Traut B.C. Klas C. Peters A.M.J. Matzku S. Moller P. Falk W. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar, 2.Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M.

To evaluate binding interactions of Fas, two cell lines that are negative for Fas antigen expression, L929 and HeLa cells, and two lines that express Fas, Jurkat and Hut78, were analyzed for binding using affinity-purified bacterial GST-mFas fusion proteins. All four cell lines are responsive to agonist antibody (sensitivity for L929 and HeLa cells has been demonstrated after transfection of Fas cDNA). Lysates from [S]methionine and -cysteine-labeled HeLa, L929, and Jurkat cells were prepared and precleared with recombinant GST protein to remove potential GST binding proteins. These lysates were then incubated with Sepharose-GSH beads containing either GST alone or GST-mFas-(194-306). After extensive washes with a lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 200 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Due to the relatively low sensitivity of this technique, associated proteins were sometimes difficult to detect together in a single experiment. Several cellular proteins were observed to bind nonspecifically to GST and GST-mFas-(194-306). However, three polypeptides of relative molecular masses 25, 50, and 70 kilodaltons from HeLa, L929, and Jurkat cell lines (referred to as p25, p50, and p70) were observed to bind to the GST-mFas-(194-306) protein but not to GST (Fig. 2). In Jurkat cells, p25 is clearly present but is obscured by a closely migrating protein found in the GST and GST-fusion protein lanes. Similar protein associations were observed in Hut78 cells (data not shown). In order to assess the strength of the protein interactions detected with the GST-fusion proteins, the GST-mFas-polypeptide complexes were subjected to washes with increasing salt concentrations. The p25, p50, and p70 polypeptides were found to be associated with GST-mFas-(194-306) over a range of salt concentrations from 200 mM to 1 M (Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that strong interactions exist between these cellular polypeptides and mFas cytoplasmic amino acids 194-306. The specificity of these interactions was tested using an anti-GSTmFas antibody. A polyclonal antibody was generated to the recombinant GST-mFas-(221-306) protein. The antibody recognized the Fas intracellular domain by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A). The antibody was affinity-purified and then used to assess the nature of the binding interactions between the GST-mFas-(194-306) recombinant protein and p25, p50, and p70. The GST-mFas-(194-306) protein was preincubated with increasing amounts of the anti-GST-mFas or anti-GST antibody and used to screen HeLa cell metabolically labeled lysates as described under “Materials and Methods.” Incubation with the anti-GST-mFas IgG blocked binding of p25 and p70 to GST-mFas (Fig. 4B). A longer exposure indicated that the p50 protein was similarly disrupted. Control experiments indicated that the anti-GST antibody had no effect up to 100 μg of IgG. These findings indicate that the three polypeptides associate specifically with the mFas intracellular domain containing amino acid residues 194-306. To characterize the association of cellular proteins with the Fas cytoplasmic domain, two other GST-mFas fusion proteins were used to assay metabolically labeled HeLa cell lysates. The first, GST-mFas lpr, represents a protein with identical primary structure to GST-mFas-(194-306) except for a single amino acid change at residue 225, where an isoleucine was replaced by an asparagine (see Fig. 1). The mouse Fas antigen harboring such a mutation has been shown to lack biological activity. The second fusion protein, GST-mFas-(221-306), differs from GST-mFas-(194-306) in that the N-terminal 27 amino acids of the mFas coding region are missing, creating a deletion of 17 amino acids at the N terminus of the death domain (see Fig. 1). Binding experiments with HeLa and L929 cell extracts indicated that while both p25 and p70 interacted strongly with both GST-mFas lpr and GST-mFas-(194-306), only p25 was found to be strongly associated with GST-mFas-(221-306) (Fig. 5). These findings imply that p25 and p70 interact with mFas via distinct domains. Binding of p70 to Fas appears to require a region between residues 194 and 221, while p25 binds to more C-terminal sequences. Furthermore, the fact that both p25 and p70 bind to GST-mFas lpr is intriguing as the lpr mutant is believed to represent an inactive form of Fas. To define further the binding of p50 to the cytoplasmic domain of wild-type Fas, a series of C-terminal mutations (FD) were assayed, which corresponded to deletions made in the human Fas antigen(5.Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolically labeled HeLa cell lysates were assayed for p50 binding using these GST-fusion proteins (Fig. 1). The p50 protein was found to strongly associate with all the FD mutants except GST-mFas FD2, which contains residues 194-221 of mouse Fas (Fig. 6A). Since p50 binds tightly to the FD4 mutant (mFas-(194-267)), the binding domain for p50 spans residues 222 to 268 of mFas. In addition, all the FD mutant proteins used in this analysis were found to bind equally well to labeled p70 from HeLa cells (Fig. 6B). These results are consistent with the mapping of p70 binding to a region of Fas between amino acids 194 and 221 (Fig. 5). Attempts to visualize binding of p25 to the FD mutants did not provide conclusive mapping information; however, the binding of p25 to GST-mFas-(221-306) (Fig. 5) indicated that p25 interacts with the C-terminal 85 amino acids of Fas. Taken together, the GST-fusion protein data demonstrate that each cellular protein displays a distinctive binding interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of mouse Fas. Binding of p70 has been localized to residues 194-221; p50 binds to residues 222-268; and p25 binds a region between residues 221 and 306. The mouse Fas intracellular domain is therefore capable of multiple protein-protein interactions. The Fas antigen belongs to a group of cell surface receptors, the TNF receptors, CD40, CD30, and the p75 neurotrophin receptor, for which intracellular receptor signaling pathways are not well defined. A major question regarding the mechanism of Fas-mediated cell killing is how activation of the receptor leads to the biochemical reactions responsible for apoptosis. A number of activities, including sphingomyelin turnover(13.Cifone M.G. DeMaria R. Roncaioli P. Rippo M.R. Azuma M. Lanier L.L. Santoni A. Testi R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 177: 1547-1552Crossref Scopus (594) Google Scholar), tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation(15.Eischen C.M. Dick C.J. Leibson P.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1947-1954PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Sato T. Irie S. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), and activation of ras(21.Gulbins E. Bissonnette R. Mahboubi A. Martin S. Nishioka W. Brunner T. Baier G. Baier-Bitterlich G. Byrd C. Lang F. Kolesnick R. Altman A. Green D. Immunity. 1995; 2: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) have been implicated. However, none of these enzymatic activities have been physically linked to the Fas receptor. To begin to understand Fas receptor function, we have utilized recombinant GST-fusion proteins to assay for proteins that associate with cytoplasmic sequences of Fas. In contrast to the yeast two-hybrid approach, this approach provides direct biochemical evidence for interacting proteins from cell lysates. Three proteins of apparent molecular masses 25, 50, and 70 kilodaltons, from HeLa, Jurkat, L929, and Hut78 cells, display strong interactions with the intracellular domain of mouse Fas. These proteins are not restricted to Fas-expressing cells, since HeLa and L929 cells do not express the Fas antigen(5.Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Wong G.H.W. Goeddel D.V. J. Immunol. 1993; 152: 1751-1755Google Scholar); these two cell lines are rendered Fas-sensitive upon introduction of the Fas cDNA by transfection. The binding interactions are stable even in the presence of 1 M NaCl and could be specifically blocked by polyclonal antibodies against the Fas intracellular domain. Mapping data suggest that each protein binds to a different Fas cytoplasmic sequence (Fig. 7). Since these proteins were found to bind to the Fas intracellular domain in the absence of ligand, it is possible that these interactions are constitutive in nature. However, given that the intracellular domain of Fas has been demonstrated to self-associate(9.Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7795-7798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar, 22.Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E. Chumakov I. Shemer-Avni Y. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 387-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), it is also possible that the resultant recombinant fusion protein complexes contain the Fas intracellular domain in dimeric or oligomeric form. This suggests that the recombinant Fas proteins used here may mimic the behavior of the receptor upon agonist binding. Supporting the idea that these interactions are constitutive in nature is the behavior of the labeled HeLa cell proteins toward the mFas lpr mutant fusion protein. A comparable level of binding was observed to the lpr and wild-type fusion proteins, suggesting that the lpr mutation does not interfere with these associations. These results are of interest because mouse experiments clearly demonstrate that the Ile to Asn lpr change results in a biologically inactive receptor. The 25- and 70-kilodalton proteins are similar in size to two cellular proteins, MORT1/FADD (9.Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar) and RIP(11.Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.-H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), respectively, both of which were identified using a yeast interaction screening technique with the human Fas cytoplasmic domain. The MORT1/FADD and RIP proteins were shown to induce apoptosis when overexpressed in heterologous cells. In contrast to FADD and RIP proteins, the p25 and p70 proteins were found to interact with the lpr mutant form of Fas. Also, p70 maps to a different binding domain than the RIP protein(11.Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.-H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Several reasons may account for the differential results observed with these metabolically labeled proteins. First, the p25 and p70 proteins may be different from MORT1/FADD and RIP proteins. Second, there may be species-specific differences, because the mouse Fas lpr mutation (Ile to Asn) is somewhat different from the human Fas lpr mutation (Val to Asn). Third, the p25 and p70 proteins may bind to the Fas lpr protein through different conformational states, which may be exhibited either by Fas or the interacting proteins. In this regard, a potential disadvantage with the use of recombinant fusion proteins is that the exact folding of the cytoplasmic domains may not be reproduced. For many receptor systems, ligand binding leads to dimerization or aggregation of receptors, which facilitates post-translational modifications such as tyrosine phosphorylation. The action of agonist anti-Fas antibodies indicates that aggregation of Fas may serve as a key step in initiating its apoptotic function. This model of Fas action has been borne out by experiments demonstrating that the intracellular domains of both Fas and the p55 TNF receptor self-associate(22.Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E. Chumakov I. Shemer-Avni Y. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 387-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 23.Song H.Y. Dunbar J.D. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22492-22495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The experiments here demonstrate that strong and multiple protein-protein interactions exist in the absence of antibody or Fas ligand. Similar sized proteins to p25 and p50 using Fas cross-linking followed by immunoprecipitation were recently reported(24.Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that ligand-independent protein interactions are possible for Fas. If the cell death proteins that have been identified as potential partners for the Fas antigen and the p55 TNF receptor (17.Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 479-482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) function as protein association domains, the binding of the Fas ligand or agonist antibodies to the Fas receptor may lead to one of several possibilities: (a) additional protein interactions; (b) dissociation and relocalization of Fas-associated proteins to their cellular site of action; or (c) appropriate conformational changes that unmask a cell death activity in the constitutively associated protein complex. Direct assays of receptor proximal events will be required in order to discriminate among these possibilities.
