https://openalex.org/W2026727204,"Interactions between tumor cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumor microenvironment significantly influence cancer growth and metastasis. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is known to be a critical mediator of the CAF phenotype, and osteopontin (OPN) expression in tumors is associated with more aggressive phenotypes and poor patient outcomes. The potential link between these two pathways has not been previously addressed. Utilizing in vitro studies using human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MDA-MB231 (OPN+) and MCF7 (OPN-) human breast cancer cell lines, we demonstrate that OPN induces integrin-dependent MSC expression of TGF-β1 to mediate adoption of the CAF phenotype. This OPN-TGF-β1 pathway requires the transcription factor, myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1). In vivo studies with xenotransplant models in NOD-scid mice showed that OPN expression increases cancer growth and metastasis by mediating MSC-to-CAF transformation in a process that is MZF1 and TGF-β1 dependent. We conclude that tumor-derived OPN engenders MSC-to-CAF transformation in the microenvironment to promote tumor growth and metastasis via the OPN-MZF1-TGF-β1 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3149015896,"STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1), an endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensor that triggers the store-operated Ca2+ entry activation, has recently been implicated in cancer progression. However, the role of STIM1 in the progression and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been addressed. In this study, we confirmed increased expression of STIM1 in highly invasive CRC cell lines. Enhanced expression of STIM1 promoted CRC cell metastasis in vitro and in vivo, whereas silencing of STIM1 with small interfering RNA resulted in reduced metastasis. Ectopic expression of STIM1 in CRC cells induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), whereas silencing of STIM1 had the opposite effect. Furthermore, STIM1 expression was markedly higher in CRC tissues than in adjacent noncancerous tissues. STIM1 overexpression correlated with poor differentiation and higher tumor node metastasis stage. CRC patients with positive STIM1 expression had poorer prognoses than those with negative STIM1 expression. Moreover, STIM1 was found to be a direct target of miR-185, a microRNA (miRNA) that has not previously been reported to be involved in EMT, in both CRC tissues and cell lines. Taken together, these findings demonstrate for the first time that STIM1 promotes metastasis and is associated with cancer progression and poor prognosis in patients with CRC. In addition, we show that expression of STIM1 is regulated by a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism mediated by a new EMT-related miRNA. This novel miR-185–STIM1 axis promotes CRC metastasis and may be a candidate biomarker for prognosis and a target for new therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2007086793,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) bind to and post-transcriptionally regulate the stability of mRNAs. La-related protein 1 (LARP1) is a conserved RBP that interacts with poly-A-binding protein and is known to regulate 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract (TOP) mRNA translation. Here, we show that LARP1 is complexed to 3000 mRNAs enriched for cancer pathways. A prominent member of the LARP1 interactome is mTOR whose mRNA transcript is stabilized by LARP1. At a functional level, we show that LARP1 promotes cell migration, invasion, anchorage-independent growth and in vivo tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we show that LARP1 expression is elevated in epithelial cancers such as cervical and non-small cell lung cancers, where its expression correlates with disease progression and adverse prognosis, respectively. We therefore conclude that, through the post-transcriptional regulation of genes such as mTOR within cancer pathways, LARP1 contributes to cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2019977244,"Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumors and an important contributor to anti-tumor drug resistance. Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is one of the key mediators of the hypoxia signaling pathway, and was recently proven to be required for sorafenib resistance in hepatocarcinoma (HCC). MicroRNAs have emerged as important posttranslational regulators in HCC. It was reported that miR-338-3p levels are associated with clinical aggressiveness of HCC. However, the roles of miR-338-3p in HCC disease and resistance to its therapeutic drugs are unknown. In this study, we found that miR-338-3p was frequently down-regulated in 14 HCC clinical samples and five cell lines. Overexpression of miR-338-3p inhibited HIF-1α 3′-UTR luciferase activity and HIF-1α protein levels in HepG2, SMMC-7721, and Huh7 cells. miR-338-3p significantly reduced cell viability and induced cell apoptosis of HCC cells. Additionally, HIF-1α overexpression rescued and HIF-1α knock-down abrogated the anti-HCC activity of miR-338-3p. Furthermore, miR-338-3p sensitized HCC cells to sorafenib in vitro and in a HCC subcutaneous nude mice tumor model by inhibiting HIF-1α. Collectively, miR-338-3p inhibits HCC tumor growth and sensitizes HCC cells to sorafenib by down-regulating HIF-1α. Our data indicate that miR-338-3p could be a potential candidate for HCC therapeutics."

https://openalex.org/W2060817767,"Cancer cells gain a growth advantage through the so-called Warburg effect by shifting glucose metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) has been suggested to function in metabolic reprogramming; however, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. We found that the aberrant expression of wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase 3α (IDH3α), a subunit of the IDH3 heterotetramer, decreased α-ketoglutarate levels and increased the stability and transactivation activity of HIF-1α in cancer cells. The silencing of IDH3α significantly delayed tumor growth by suppressing the HIF-1-mediated Warburg effect and angiogenesis. IDH3α expression was associated with the poor postoperative overall survival of lung and breast cancer patients. These results justify the exploitation of IDH3 as a novel target for the diagnosis and treatment of cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2045994086,"Cytokines of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) family, such as IL-1α/β and IL-18, have pleiotropic activities in innate and adaptive immune responses in host defense and diseases. Insight into their biological functions helped develop novel therapeutic approaches to treat human inflammatory diseases. IL-33 is an important member of the IL-1 family of cytokines and is a ligand of the ST2 receptor, a member of the IL-1 receptor family. However, the role of the IL-33/ST2 axis in tumor growth and metastasis of breast cancer remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that IL-33 is a critical tumor promoter during epithelial cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in the breast. IL-33 dose- and time-dependently increased Cancer Osaka Thyroid (COT) phosphorylation via ST2-COT interaction in normal epithelial and breast cancer cells. The IL-33/ST2/COT cascade induced the activation of the MEK-ERK (MEK-extracellular signal-regulated kinase), JNK-cJun (cJun N-terminal kinase-cJun) and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) signaling pathways, followed by increased AP-1 and stat3 transcriptional activity. When small interfering RNAs of ST2 and COT were introduced into cells, IL-33-induced AP-1 and stat3 activity were significantly decreased, unlike that in the control cells. The inhibition of COT activity resulted in decreased IL-33-induced epithelial cell transformation, and knockdown of IL-33, ST2 and COT in breast cancer cells attenuated tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells. Consistent with these observations, ST2 levels were positively correlated with COT expression in human breast cancer. These findings provide a novel perspective on the role of the IL-33/ST2/COT signaling pathway in supporting cancer-associated inflammation in the tumor microenvironment. Therapeutic approaches that target this pathway may, therefore, effectively inhibit carcinogenesis in the breast."
https://openalex.org/W1995589601,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) is enriched in the bone matrix and serves as a key factor in promoting bone metastasis in cancer. In addition, TGFβ signaling activates mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) functions, which is important for the malignant progression. Here, we demonstrate that TGFβ regulates the level of microRNA-96 (miR-96) through Smad-dependent transcription and that miR-96 promotes the bone metastasis in prostate cancer. The enhanced effects in cellular growth and invasiveness suggest that miR-96 functions as an oncomir/and metastamir. Supporting this idea, we identified a downstream target of the TGFβ-miR-96 signaling pathway to be AKT1S1 mRNA, whose translated protein is a negative regulator of mTOR kinase. Our findings provide a novel mechanism accounting for the TGFβ signaling and bone metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2037885504,"Both androgen action and PI3K medicated signaling pathways have been implicated in prostate tumorigenesis. Our androgen receptor (AR) conditional transgenic mice developed murine prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN) and prostatic adenocarcinoma lesions recapitulating human prostate cancer development and progression. Role of transgenic AR contributing to malignancy was demonstrated by high degree of transgenic AR expression in atypical and tumor cells in mPIN as well as prostatic adenocarcinoma lesions of the transgenic mice, but not in adjacent normal tissue. Interestingly, reduced PI3K/Akt activation also appeared in these mouse atypical and tumor cells, suggesting an interaction between androgen and PI3K/AKT pathways. In this study, we further investigated this interaction. We showed that the androgen depletion or knockdown of AR expression results in elevated levels of active phosphorylated AKT in prostate cancer cells. Castration of conditional Pten knock-out mice showed increased Akt, phosphorylated Akt, and pS6 expression in the mouse prostate. Using a series of newly generated Ar reporter and Pten knock-out compound mice, we showed that Pten loss directly represses endogenous Ar expression in prostatic epithelial cells. Moreover, Pten loss and PI3K/Akt activation reduced Ar-mediated transcription in purified Pten-null cells. This study provides novel evidence demonstrating interplay between androgen and PI3K pathways, as well as introduces unique and relevant mouse models for further studies of PI3K and AR pathways in the context of prostate tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2080761603,"Rationale TRPM4 is a non-selective Ca2+-activated cation channel expressed in the heart, particularly in the atria or conduction tissue. Mutations in the Trpm4 gene were recently associated with several human conduction disorders such as Brugada syndrome. TRPM4 channel has also been implicated at the ventricular level, in inotropism or in arrhythmia genesis due to stresses such as ß-adrenergic stimulation, ischemia-reperfusion, and hypoxia re-oxygenation. However, the physiological role of the TRPM4 channel in the healthy heart remains unclear. Objectives We aimed to investigate the role of the TRPM4 channel on whole cardiac function with a Trpm4 gene knock-out mouse (Trpm4-/-) model. Methods and Results Morpho-functional analysis revealed left ventricular (LV) eccentric hypertrophy in Trpm4-/- mice, with an increase in both wall thickness and chamber size in the adult mouse (aged 32 weeks) when compared to Trpm4+/+ littermate controls. Immunofluorescence on frozen heart cryosections and qPCR analysis showed no fibrosis or cellular hypertrophy. Instead, cardiomyocytes in Trpm4-/- mice were smaller than Trpm4+/+with a higher density. Immunofluorescent labeling for phospho-histone H3, a mitosis marker, showed that the number of mitotic myocytes was increased 3-fold in the Trpm4-/-neonatal stage, suggesting hyperplasia. Adult Trpm4-/- mice presented multilevel conduction blocks, as attested by PR and QRS lengthening in surface ECGs and confirmed by intracardiac exploration. Trpm4-/-mice also exhibited Luciani-Wenckebach atrioventricular blocks, which were reduced following atropine infusion, suggesting paroxysmal parasympathetic overdrive. In addition, Trpm4-/- mice exhibited shorter action potentials in atrial cells. This shortening was unrelated to modifications of the voltage-gated Ca2+ or K+ currents involved in the repolarizing phase. Conclusions TRPM4 has pleiotropic roles in the heart, including the regulation of conduction and cellular electrical activity which impact heart development."
https://openalex.org/W2132967875,"There is often over 50% carbon loss during the thermal conversion of biomass into biochar, leading to it controversy for the biochar formation as a carbon sequestration strategy. Sometimes the biochar also seems not to be stable enough due to physical, chemical, and biological reactions in soils. In this study, three phosphorus-bearing materials, H3PO4, phosphate rock tailing (PRT), and triple superphosphate (TSP), were used as additives to wheat straw with a ratio of 1: 0.4–0.8 for biochar production at 500°C, aiming to alleviate carbon loss during pyrolysis and to increase biochar-C stabilization. All these additives remarkably increased the biochar yield from 31.7% (unmodified biochar) to 46.9%–56.9% (modified biochars). Carbon loss during pyrolysis was reduced from 51.7% to 35.5%–47.7%. Thermogravimetric analysis curves showed that the additives had no effect on thermal stability of biochar but did enhance its oxidative stability. Microbial mineralization was obviously reduced in the modified biochar, especially in the TSP-BC, in which the total CO2 emission during 60-d incubation was reduced by 67.8%, compared to the unmodified biochar. Enhancement of carbon retention and biochar stability was probably due to the formation of meta-phosphate or C-O-PO3, which could either form a physical layer to hinder the contact of C with O2 and bacteria, or occupy the active sites of the C band. Our results indicate that pre-treating biomass with phosphors-bearing materials is effective for reducing carbon loss during pyrolysis and for increasing biochar stabilization, which provides a novel method by which biochar can be designed to improve the carbon sequestration capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2070697701,"Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) responds to diverse cellular stresses, and regulates oncogenic activities (for example, proliferation, survival and migration) through direct transcriptional regulation or protein-protein interactions. Although aberrant ATF3 expression is frequently found in human cancers, the role of ATF3 in tumorigenesis is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that ATF3 suppresses the development of prostate cancer induced by knockout of the tumor suppressor Pten in mouse prostates. Whereas the oncogenic stress elicited by Pten loss induced ATF3 expression in prostate epithelium, we found that ATF3 deficiency increased cell proliferation and promoted cell survival, leading to early onset of mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and the progression of prostate lesions to invasive adenocarcinoma. Importantly, the loss of ATF3 promoted activation of the oncogenic AKT signaling evidenced by high levels of phosphorylated AKT and S6 proteins in ATF3-null prostate lesions. In line with these in vivo results, knockdown of ATF3 expression in human prostate cancer cells by single guided RNA-mediated targeting activated AKT and increased matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression. Our results thus link ATF3 to the AKT signaling, and suggest that ATF3 is a tumor suppressor for the major subset of prostate cancers harboring dysfunctional Pten."
https://openalex.org/W2049778128,"Further understanding of the molecular biology and pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is crucial for future therapeutic development. SMAD4, recognized as an important tumor suppressor, is a central mediator of transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. This study investigated the role of SMAD4 in HCC. Nuclear localization of SMAD4 was observed in a cohort of 140 HCC patients using tissue microarray. HCC cell lines were used for functional assay in vitro and in immune-deficient mice. Nuclear SMAD4 levels were significantly increased in patient HCC tumors as compared with adjacent tissues. Knockdown of SMAD4 significantly reduced the efficiency of colony formation and migratory capacity of HCC cells in vitro and was incompatible with HCC tumor initiation and growth in mice. Knockdown of SMAD4 partially conferred resistance to the anti-growth effects of BMP ligand in HCC cells. Importantly, simultaneous elevation of SMAD4 and phosphorylated SMAD2/3 is significantly associated with poor patient outcome after surgery. Although high levels of SMAD4 can also mediate an antitumor function by coupling with phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8, this signaling, however, is absent in majority of our HCC patients. In conclusion, this study revealed a highly non-canonical tumor-promoting function of SMAD4 in HCC. The drastic elevation of nuclear SMAD4 in sub-population of HCC tumors highlights its potential as an outcome predictor for patient stratification and a target for personalized therapeutic development."
https://openalex.org/W1976291870,"There are significant challenges to restoring binaural hearing to children who have been deaf from an early age. The uncoordinated and poor temporal information available from cochlear implants distorts perception of interaural timing differences normally important for sound localization and listening in noise. Moreover, binaural development can be compromised by bilateral and unilateral auditory deprivation. Here, we studied perception of both interaural level and timing differences in 79 children/adolescents using bilateral cochlear implants and 16 peers with normal hearing. They were asked on which side of their head they heard unilaterally or bilaterally presented click- or electrical pulse- trains. Interaural level cues were identified by most participants including adolescents with long periods of unilateral cochlear implant use and little bilateral implant experience. Interaural timing cues were not detected by new bilateral adolescent users, consistent with previous evidence. Evidence of binaural timing detection was, for the first time, found in children who had much longer implant experience but it was marked by poorer than normal sensitivity and abnormally strong dependence on current level differences between implants. In addition, children with prior unilateral implant use showed a higher proportion of responses to their first implanted sides than children implanted simultaneously. These data indicate that there are functional repercussions of developing binaural hearing through bilateral cochlear implants, particularly when provided sequentially; nonetheless, children have an opportunity to use these devices to hear better in noise and gain spatial hearing."
https://openalex.org/W1980533832,"The four R-spondins (RSPO1-4) and their three related receptors LGR4, 5 and 6 (LGR4-6) have emerged as a major ligand-receptor system with critical roles in development and stem cell survival through modulation of Wnt signaling. Recurrent, gain-of-expression gene fusions of RSPO2 (to EIF3E) and RSPO3 (to PTPRK) occur in a subset of human colorectal cancer. However, the exact roles and mechanisms of the RSPO-LGR system in oncogenesis remain largely unknown. We found that RSPO3 is aberrantly expressed at high levels in approximately half of Keap1-mutated lung adenocarcinomas (ADs). This high RSPO3 expression is driven by a combination of demethylation of its own promoter region and deficiency in Keap1 instead of gene fusion as in colon cancer. Patients with RSPO3-high tumors (~9%, 36/412) displayed much poorer survival than the rest of the cohort (median survival of 28 vs 163 months, log-rank test P<0.0001). Knockdown (KD) of RSPO3, LGR4 or their signaling mediator IQGAP1 in lung cancer cell lines with Keap1 deficiency and high RSPO3-LGR4 expression led to reduction in cell proliferation and migration in vitro, and KD of LGR4 or IQGAP1 resulted in decrease in tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. These findings suggest that aberrant RSPO3-LGR4 signaling potentially acts as a driving mechanism in the aggressiveness of Keap1-deficient lung ADs."
https://openalex.org/W2033954491,"Background The total activity volume performed is an overall measure that takes into account the frequency, intensity, and duration of activities performed. The importance of considering total activity volume is shown by recent studies indicating that light physical activity (LPA) and intermittent moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) have health benefits. Accelerometer-derived total activity counts (TAC) per day from a waist-worn accelerometer can serve as a proxy for an individual's total activity volume. The purpose of this study was to develop age- and gender-specific percentiles for daily TAC, minutes of MVPA, and minutes of LPA in U.S. youth ages 6 – 19 y. Methods Data from the 2003 – 2006 NHANES waist-worn accelerometer component were used in this analysis. The sample was composed of youth aged 6 – 19 years with at least 4 d of ≥ 10 hours of accelerometer wear time (N = 3698). MVPA was defined using age specific cutpoints as the total number of minutes at ≥4 metabolic equivalents (METs) for youth 6 – 17 y or minutes with ≥2020 counts for youth 18 – 19 y. LPA was defined as the total number of minutes between 100 counts and the MVPA threshold. TAC/d, MVPA, and LPA were averaged across all valid days. Results For males in the 50th percentile, the median activity level was 441,431 TAC/d, with 53 min/d of MVPA and 368 min/d of LPA. The median level of activity for females was 234,322 TAC/d, with 32 min/d of MVPA and 355 min/d of LPA. Conclusion Population referenced TAC/d percentiles for U.S. youth ages 6-19 y provide a novel means of characterizing the total activity volume performed by children and adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W1998496138,"Several plasma non-lipid biomarkers have been shown to predict major cardiovascular events (MCVEs) in population studies. Our objective was to investigate the relationship between lipid and non-lipid biomarkers levels achieved during statin therapy and the incidence of MCVEs in patients with stable coronary heart disease (CHD). We conducted a substudy of the TNT (Treating to New Targets) study, which was a randomized trial that compared the efficacy of high (80 mg) versus low (10 mg) dose atorvastatin for the secondary prevention of CHD. Fasting plasma levels of standard lipids and of 18 non-lipid biomarkers were obtained after an 8-week run-in period on atorvastatin 10 mg in 157 patients who experienced MCVEs during the 4.9 years of study follow-up and in 1349 controls. MCVE was defined as CHD death, nonfatal, non-procedure-related myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal or nonfatal stroke. After adjusting for age, sex and treatment arm, plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), insulin, neopterin, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], and the soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) were predictive of recurrent MCVEs (P≤0.02 for each doubling of plasma concentration). However, no significant association was observed between the risk of recurrent MCVEs and plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, adiponectin, cystatin C, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, matrix metalloproteinase-9, myeloperoxidase, osteopontin, soluble CD40 ligand, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, or soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. After further adjustment for diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and BMI, the relationship between hsCRP, insulin and MCVE were no longer significant, while the relationship between Lp(a), neopterin, NT-proBNP and sRAGE and MCVE remained statistically significant. In conclusion, in patients with CHD treated with atorvastatin, plasma levels of Lp(a), neopterin, NT-proBNP, and sRAGE are associated with the risk of recurrent MCVEs.

https://openalex.org/W2044228695,"To understand the mechanisms involved in the strong killing effect of carbon-ion beam irradiation on cancer cells with TP53 tumor suppressor gene deficiencies.DNA damage responses after carbon-ion beam or X-ray irradiation in isogenic HCT116 colorectal cancer cell lines with and without TP53 (p53+/+ and p53-/-, respectively) were analyzed as follows: cell survival by clonogenic assay, cell death modes by morphologic observation of DAPI-stained nuclei, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by immunostaining of phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX), and cell cycle by flow cytometry and immunostaining of Ser10-phosphorylated histone H3.The p53-/- cells were more resistant than the p53+/+ cells to X-ray irradiation, while the sensitivities of the p53+/+ and p53-/- cells to carbon-ion beam irradiation were comparable. X-ray and carbon-ion beam irradiations predominantly induced apoptosis of the p53+/+ cells but not the p53-/- cells. In the p53-/- cells, carbon-ion beam irradiation, but not X-ray irradiation, markedly induced mitotic catastrophe that was associated with premature mitotic entry with harboring long-retained DSBs at 24 h post-irradiation.Efficient induction of mitotic catastrophe in apoptosis-resistant p53-deficient cells implies a strong cancer cell-killing effect of carbon-ion beam irradiation that is independent of the p53 status, suggesting its biological advantage over X-ray treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2048816591,"The interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) broadly inhibit virus infections, particularly at the viral entry level. However, despite this shared ability to inhibit fusion, IFITMs differ in the potency and breadth of viruses restricted, an anomaly that is not fully understood. Here, we show that differences in the range of viruses restricted by IFITM1 are regulated by a C-terminal non-canonical dibasic sorting signal KRXX that suppresses restriction of some viruses by governing its intracellular distribution. Replacing the two basic residues with alanine (KR/AA) increased restriction of jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus and 10A1 amphotropic murine leukemia virus. Deconvolution microscopy revealed an altered subcellular distribution for KR/AA, with fewer molecules in LAMP1-positive lysosomes balanced by increased levels in CD63-positive multivesicular bodies, where jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus pseudovirions are colocalized. IFITM1 binds to cellular adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3), an association that is lost when the dibasic motif is altered. Although knockdown of AP-3 itself decreases some virus entry, expression of parental IFITM1, but not its KR/AA mutant, potentiates inhibition of viral infections in AP-3 knockdown cells. By using the substituted cysteine accessibility method, we provide evidence that IFITM1 adopts more than one membrane topology co-existing in cellular membranes. Because the C-terminal dibasic sorting signal is unique to human IFITM1, our results provide novel insight into understanding the species- and virus-specific antiviral effect of IFITMs."
https://openalex.org/W2157127236,"Background Continuity of medical care is widely believed to lead to better health outcomes and service utilization patterns for patients. Most continuity studies, however, have only used administrative claims to assess longitudinal continuity with a provider. As a result, little is known about how interpersonal continuity (the patient's experience at the visit) relates to improved health outcomes and service use. Methods We linked claims-based longitudinal continuity and survey-based self-reported interpersonal continuity indicators for 1,219 Medicare beneficiaries who completed the National Health and Health Services Use Questionnaire. With these linked data, we prospectively evaluated the effect of both types of continuity of care indicators on emergency department use, hospitalization, and mortality over a five-year period. Results Patient-reported continuity was associated with reduced emergency department use, preventable hospitalization, and mortality. Most of the claims-based measures, including those most frequently used to assess continuity, were not associated with reduced utilization or mortality. Conclusion Our results indicate that the patient- and claims-based indicators of continuity have very different effects on these important health outcomes, suggesting that reform efforts must include the patient-provider experience when evaluating health care quality."

GDE4 is expressed in intestinal epithelial cells, spermatids, and macrophages, whereas GDE7 is particularly expressed in gastro-esophageal epithelial cells. Unlike other mammalian GP-PDEs, GDE4 and GDE7 cannot hydrolyze either glycerophosphoinositol or glycerophosphocholine. Unexpectedly, both GDE4 and GDE7 show a lysophospholipase D activity toward lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC). We purified the recombinant GDE4 and GDE7 proteins and show that these enzymes can hydrolyze lyso-PC to produce lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Further characterization of purified recombinant GDE4 showed that it can also convert lyso-platelet-activating factor (1-O-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; lyso-PAF) to alkyl-LPA. These data contribute to our current understanding of mammalian GP-PDEs and of their physiological roles via the control of lyso-PC and lyso-PAF metabolism in gastrointestinal epithelial cells and macrophages.

https://openalex.org/W2035275726,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is characterized by aberrant overexpression of mucins that contribute to its pathogenesis. Although the inflammatory cytokines contribute to mucin overexpression, the mucin profile of PC is markedly distinct from that of normal or inflamed pancreas. We postulated that de novo expression of various mucins in PC involves chromatin modifications. Analysis of chromatin modifying enzymes by PCR array identified differential expression of NCOA3 in MUC4-expressing PC cell lines. Immunohistochemistry analysis in tumor tissues from patients and spontaneous mouse models, and microarray analysis following the knockdown of NCOA3 were performed to elucidate its role in mucin regulation and overall impact on PC. Silencing of NCOA3 in PC cell lines resulted in significant downregulation of two most differentially expressed mucins in PC, MUC4 and MUC1 (P<0.01). Immunohistochemistry analysis in PC tissues and metastatic lesions established an association between NCOA3 and mucin (MUC1 and MUC4) expression. Spontaneous mouse model of PC (K-ras(G12D); Pdx-1cre) showed early expression of Ncoa3 during pre-neoplastic lesions. Mechanistically, NCOA3 knockdown abrogated retinoic acid-mediated MUC4 upregulation by restricting MUC4 promoter accessibility as demonstrated by micrococcus nuclease digestion (P<0.05) and chromatin immuno-precipitation analysis. NCOA3 also created pro-inflammatory conditions by upregulating chemokines like CXCL1, 2, 5 and CCL20 (P<0.001). AKT, ubiquitin C, ERK1/2 and NF-κB occupied dominant nodes in the networks significantly modulated after NCOA3 silencing. In addition, NCOA3 stabilized mucins post translationally through fucosylation by FUT8, as the knockdown of FUT8 resulted in the downregulation of MUC4 and MUC1 at protein levels."
https://openalex.org/W2015930857,"Preventing a pest population from damaging an agricultural crop and, at the same time, preventing the development of pesticide resistance is a major challenge in crop protection. Understanding how farming practices and environmental factors interact with pest characteristics to influence the spread of resistance is a difficult and complex task. It is extremely challenging to investigate such interactions experimentally at realistic spatial and temporal scales. Mathematical modelling and computer simulation have, therefore, been used to analyse resistance evolution and to evaluate potential resistance management tactics. Of the many modelling approaches available, individual-based modelling of a pest population offers most flexibility to include and analyse numerous factors and their interactions. Here, a pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus) population was modelled as an aggregate of individual insects inhabiting a spatially heterogeneous landscape. The development of the pest and host crop (oilseed rape) was driven by climatic variables. The agricultural land of the landscape was managed by farmers applying a specific rotation and crop protection strategy. The evolution of a single resistance allele to the pyrethroid lambda cyhalothrin was analysed for different combinations of crop management practices and for a recessive, intermediate and dominant resistance allele. While the spread of a recessive resistance allele was severely constrained, intermediate or dominant resistance alleles showed a similar response to the management regime imposed. Calendar treatments applied irrespective of pest density accelerated the development of resistance compared to ones applied in response to prescribed pest density thresholds. A greater proportion of spring-sown oilseed rape was also found to increase the speed of resistance as it increased the period of insecticide exposure. Our study demonstrates the flexibility and power of an individual-based model to simulate how farming practices affect pest population dynamics, and the consequent impact of different control strategies on the risk and speed of resistance development."
https://openalex.org/W2072027812,"FOXA1 expression correlates with the breast cancer luminal subtype and patient survival. RNA and protein analysis of a panel of breast cancer cell lines revealed that BRCA1 deficiency is associated with the downregulation of FOXA1 expression. Knockdown of BRCA1 resulted in the downregulation of FOXA1 expression and enhancement of FOXA1 promoter methylation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, whereas the reconstitution of BRCA1 in Brca1-deficent mouse mammary epithelial cells (MMECs) promoted Foxa1 expression and methylation. These data suggest that BRCA1 suppresses FOXA1 hypermethylation and silencing. Consistently, the treatment of MMECs with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycitydine induced Foxa1 mRNA expression. Furthermore, treatment with GSK126, an inhibitor of EZH2 methyltransferase activity, induced FOXA1 expression in BRCA1-deficient but not in BRCA1-reconstituted MMECs. Likewise, the depletion of EZH2 by small interfering RNA enhanced FOXA1 mRNA expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis demonstrated that BRCA1, EZH2, DNA methyltransferases (DNMT)1/3a/3b and H3K27me3 are recruited to the endogenous FOXA1 promoter, further supporting the hypothesis that these proteins interact to modulate FOXA1 methylation and repression. Further co-immunoprecipitation and ChIP analysis showed that both BRCA1 and DNMT3b form complexes with EZH2 but not with each other, consistent with the notion that BRCA1 binds to EZH2 and negatively regulates its methyltransferase activity. We also found that EZH2 promotes and BRCA1 impairs the deposit of the gene silencing histone mark H3K27me3 on the FOXA1 promoter. These associations were validated in a familial breast cancer patient cohort. Integrated analysis of the global gene methylation and expression profiles of a set of 33 familial breast tumours revealed that FOXA1 promoter methylation is inversely correlated with the transcriptional expression of FOXA1 and that BRCA1 mutation breast cancer is significantly associated with FOXA1 methylation and downregulation of FOXA1 expression, providing physiological evidence to our findings that FOXA1 expression is regulated by methylation and chromatin silencing and that BRCA1 maintains FOXA1 expression through suppressing FOXA1 gene methylation in breast cancer."

These ion channels are oligomeric complexes formed by the pore-forming CaVα1 with the auxiliary CaVβ and CaVα2δ subunits. CaVα2δ increases the peak current density and improves the voltage-dependent activation gating of CaV1.2 channels without increasing the surface expression of the CaVα1 subunit. The functional impact of genetic variants of CACNA2D1 (the gene encoding for CaVα2δ), associated with shorter repolarization QT intervals (the time interval between the Q and the T waves on the cardiac electrocardiogram), was investigated after recombinant expression of the full complement of L-type CaV1.2 subunits in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. By performing side-by-side high resolution flow cytometry assays and whole-cell patch clamp recordings, we revealed that the surface density of the CaVα2δ wild-type protein correlates with the peak current density. Furthermore, the cell surface density of CaVα2δ mutants S755T, Q917H, and S956T was not significantly different from the cell surface density of the CaVα2δ wild-type protein expressed under the same conditions. In contrast, the cell surface expression of CaVα2δ D550Y, CaVα2δ S709N, and the double mutant D550Y/Q917H was reduced, respectively, by ≈30–33% for the single mutants and by 60% for the latter. The cell surface density of D550Y/Q917H was more significantly impaired than protein stability, suggesting that surface trafficking of CaVα2δ was disrupted by the double mutation. Co-expression with D550Y/Q917H significantly decreased CaV1.2 currents as compared with results obtained with CaVα2δ wild type.

In this work, we have characterized the CaVα2δ mutations associated with arrhythmogenic activity in regard to their functional impact on the cardiac L-type CaV1.2 currents. Using a fluorescence-labeled and extracellularly tagged CaVα2δ subunit, we show here that missense mutations D550Y, S709N and D550Y/Q917H significantly altered the cell surface density of CaVα2δ. Decreasing the cell surface density of CaVα2δ D550Y/Q917H was found to profoundly decrease L-type peak current densities as compared with currents measured with CaVα2δ wild type (WT). Altogether, our data support a model where CaVα2δ modulates channel function without altering the trafficking of CaV1.2 and establishes the cell surface density of CaVα2δ relative to the pore-forming CaVα1 as the single most important determinant in the stimulation of CaV1.2 currents by CaVα2δ.

Recently, caspase-2 has been implicated in nonapoptotic functions including maintenance of genomic stability and tumor suppression. Our previous studies demonstrated that caspase-2 also regulates cellular redox status and delays the onset of several ageing-related traits. In the current study, we tested stress tolerance ability in caspase-2-deficient (Casp2(-/-)) mice by challenging both young and old mice with a low dose of the potent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generator, PQ that primarily affects lungs. In both groups of mice, PQ induced pulmonary damage. However, the lesions in caspase-2 knockout mice were consistently and reproducibly more severe than those in wild-type (WT) mice. Furthermore, serum interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 levels were higher in PQ-exposed aged Casp2(-/-) mice indicating increased inflammation. Interestingly, livers from Casp2(-/-) mice displayed karyomegaly, a feature commonly associated with ageing and aneuploidy. Given that Casp2(-/-) mice show impaired antioxidant defense, we tested oxidative damage in these mice. Protein oxidation significantly increased in PQ-injected old Casp2(-/-) mice. Moreover, FoxO1, SOD2 and Nrf2 expression levels were reduced and induction of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase activity was not observed in PQ-treated Casp2(-/-) mice. Strong c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) activation was observed in Casp2(-/-) mice, indicative of increased stress. Together, our data strongly suggest that caspase-2 deficiency leads to increased cellular stress largely because these mice fail to respond to oxidative stress by upregulating their antioxidant defense mechanism. This makes the mice more vulnerable to exogenous challenges and may partly explain the shorter lifespan of Casp2(-/-) mice."
https://openalex.org/W1967053772,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is an extremely aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis and low patient survival. Because chemotherapy for advanced HNSCC is often ineffective, discovering new therapeutic targets that are important for HNSCC development and progression and elucidating their molecular mechanisms are required. In the present study, we describe the role of DRAK1 (death-associated protein kinase-related apoptosis-inducing kinase 1) as a novel negative regulator of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) tumor suppressor signaling pathway for the first time in human HNSCC cells. DRAK1 was significantly overexpressed in primary human HNSCCs and in HNSCC cell lines. Through gain- and loss-of-function experiments, we demonstrated that the DRAK1 expression level regulated TGF-β1-induced transcriptional activity and expression of the tumor suppressor gene p21Waf1/Cip1. DRAK1 depletion enhanced TGF-β1-induced growth inhibition in vitro and suppressed tumorigenicity in xenograft models in vivo. Mechanistically, DRAK1 was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and bound to Smad3, thereby interrupting Smad3/Smad4 complex formation, which is the core process for the induction of tumor suppressor genes by TGF-β1. Thus, our findings suggest that cytoplasmic DRAK1 increases tumorigenic potential through inhibition of TGF-β1-mediated tumor suppressor activity in HNSCC cells and may be a potential therapeutic target for HNSCCs."
https://openalex.org/W2083077952,"Melanoma is a highly aggressive disease that is difficult to treat owing to rapid tumor growth, apoptotic resistance and high metastatic potential. The MET proto-oncogene (MET) tyrosine kinase receptor promotes many of these cellular processes, but while MET is often overexpressed in melanoma, the mechanism driving this overexpression is unknown. As the MET gene is rarely mutated or amplified in melanoma, MET overexpression may be driven to increased activation through promoter elements. In this report, we find that transcription factors PAX3 and ETS1 directly interact to synergistically activate MET expression. Inhibition of PAX3 and ETS1 expression in melanoma cells leads to a significant reduction of MET receptor levels. The 300-bp 5' proximal MET promoter contains a PAX3 response element and two ETS1 consensus motifs. Although ETS1 can moderately activate both of these sites without cofactors, robust MET promoter activation of the first site is PAX dependent and requires the presence of PAX3, whereas the second site is PAX independent. The induction of MET by ETS1 via this second site is enhanced by hepatocyte growth factor-dependent ETS1 activation, thereby MET indirectly promotes its own expression. We further find that expression of a dominant-negative ETS1 reduces the ability of melanoma cells to grow both in culture and in vivo. Thus, we discover a pathway where ETS1 advances melanoma through the expression of MET via PAX-dependent and -independent mechanisms."

Epidemiological studies have shown that adolescent and young women are at increased risk of developing breast cancer following exposure to ionising radiation compared with older women, and that risk is dose-dependent. Although it is well understood which individuals are at risk of radiation-induced breast carcinogenesis, the molecular genetic mechanisms that underlie cell transformation are less clear. To identify genetic alterations potentially responsible for driving radiogenic breast transformation, we exposed the human breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A to fractionated doses of X-rays and examined the copy number and cytogenetic alterations. We identified numerous alterations of c-MYC that included high-level focal amplification associated with increased protein expression. c-MYC amplification was also observed in primary human mammary epithelial cells following exposure to radiation. We also demonstrate that the frequency and magnitude of c-MYC amplification and c-MYC protein expression is significantly higher in breast cancer with antecedent radiation exposure compared with breast cancer without a radiation aetiology. Our data also demonstrate extensive intratumor heterogeneity with respect to c-MYC copy number in radiogenic breast cancer, suggesting continuous evolution at this locus during disease development and progression. Taken together, these data identify c-MYC as a radiosensitive locus, implicating this oncogenic transcription factor in the aetiology of radiogenic breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2134180523,"Tumor-initiating cells are a subpopulation in aggressive cancers that exhibit traits shared with stem cells, including the ability to self-renew and differentiate, commonly referred to as stemness. In addition, such cells are resistant to chemo- and radiation therapy posing a therapeutic challenge. To uncover stemness-associated functions in glioma-initiating cells (GICs), transcriptome profiles were compared to neural stem cells (NSCs) and gene ontology analysis identified an enrichment of Ca2+ signaling genes in NSCs and the more stem-like (NSC-proximal) GICs. Functional analysis in a set of different GIC lines regarding sensitivity to disturbed homeostasis using A23187 and Thapsigargin, revealed that NSC-proximal GICs were more sensitive, corroborating the transcriptome data. Furthermore, Ca2+ drug sensitivity was reduced in GICs after differentiation, with most potent effect in the NSC-proximal GIC, supporting a stemness-associated Ca2+ sensitivity. NSCs and the NSC-proximal GIC line expressed a larger number of ion channels permeable to potassium, sodium and Ca2+. Conversely, a higher number of and higher expression levels of Ca2+ binding genes that may buffer Ca2+, were expressed in NSC-distal GICs. In particular, expression of the AMPA glutamate receptor subunit GRIA1, was found to associate with Ca2+ sensitive NSC-proximal GICs, and decreased as GICs differentiated along with reduced Ca2+ drug sensitivity. The correlation between high expression of Ca2+ channels (such as GRIA1) and sensitivity to Ca2+ drugs was confirmed in an additional nine novel GIC lines. Calcium drug sensitivity also correlated with expression of the NSC markers nestin (NES) and FABP7 (BLBP, brain lipid-binding protein) in this extended analysis. In summary, NSC-associated NES+/FABP7+/GRIA1+ GICs were selectively sensitive to disturbances in Ca2+ homeostasis, providing a potential target mechanism for eradication of an immature population of malignant cells."

In the present study we discerned the molecular mechanisms of potential interaction between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and the MEK/ERK pathway in inducing apoptosis in TNBC cells. Here we observed that induction of ER stress alone was not sufficient to trigger significant apoptosis but simultaneous inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway enhanced ER stress-induced apoptosis via a caspase-dependent mechanism. Our study also demonstrated nifetepimine, a dihydropyrimidone derivative as a potent anti-cancer agent in TNBC cells. Nifetepimine down-regulated the MEK/ERK pathway in MDAMB-231 and MDAMB-468 cells and resulted in blockage of ER stress-mediated GRP78 up-regulation. Detailed mechanistic studies also revealed that nifetepimine by down-regulating pERK expression also declined the promoter binding activity of TFII-I to the GRP78 promoter and in turn regulated GRP78 transcription. Studies further extended to in vivo Swiss albino and SCID mice models also revalidated the anti-carcinogenic property of nifetepimine. Thus our findings cumulatively suggest that nifetepimine couples two distinct signaling pathways to induce the apoptotic death cascade in TNBC cells and raises the possibility for the use of nifetepimine as a potent anti-cancer agent with strong immune-restoring properties for therapeutic intervention for this group of cancer bearers.

Currently, investigating endoplasmic reticulum stress as a potential target for cancer therapy has gained importance for exploring new horizons in drug development for these subgroups of breast cancer patients. The efficient functioning of the ER is essential for proper cellular activities and survival. Several cellular stress conditions, such as nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, and disturbances of calcium flux, lead to accumulation and aggregation of unfolded and/or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen and cause so-called ER stress (9.Harding H.P.

Moreover, GRP78 expression has been shown in some cases to be associated with tumor development and growth and correlated with resistance to certain forms of chemotherapy. It seems that some cancer cells may have adapted to ER stress by activation of the UPR without resulting in apoptosis (13.Lee E. Nichols P. Spicer D. Groshen S. Yu M.C. Lee A.S.

De-regulation of GRP stress protein expression in human breast cancer cell lines.Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1999; 54: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As a “master” regulator of the UPR, GRP78 is believed to play an essential role in counteracting the apoptosis inducing potential of ER stress by multiple mechanisms such as binding to the unfolded proteins to alleviate ER stress conditions, and binding to calcium to prevent its release from the ER (12.Lee A.S. GRP78 induction in cancer: therapeutic and prognostic implications.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 3496-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Reports suggest that human caspase-4 plays an important role in ER stress-induced apoptosis of human neuroblastoma and HeLa cells (17.Hitomi J. Katayama T. Eguchi Y. Kudo T. Taniguchi M. Koyama Y. Manabe T. Yamagishi S. Bando Y. Imaizumi K. Tsujimoto Y. Tohyama M. Involvement of caspase-4 in endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis and Ah-induced cell death.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Caspase-4 have been reported to be physically associated with GRP78 and down-regulation of GRP78 plays a role in facilitating the activation of caspase-4 and apoptosis (18.Jiang C.C. Chen L.H. Gillespie S. Wang Y.F. Kiejda K.A. Zhang X.D. Hersey P. Inhibition of MEK sensitizes human melanoma cells to endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9750-9761Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The GRP promoters contain multiple copies of ER stress response elements. It has been previously observed that a protein complex exhibits enhanced binding to the ER stress response element of the GRP78 promoter on thapsigargin-induced stress (19.Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Identification of the cis-acting endoplasmic reticulum stress response element responsible for transcriptional induction of mammalian glucose-regulated proteins: involvement of basic leucine zipper transcription factors.J.

The mammalian endoplasmic reticulum stress response element consists of an evolutionarily conserved tripartite structure and interacts with a novel stress-inducible complex.Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Later this protein binding within the ER stress response element has been identified as the multitranscription factor TFII-I (21.Parker R. Phan T. Baumeister P. Roy B. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Lee A.S. Identification of TFII-I as the endoplasmic reticulum stress response element binding factor ERSF: its autoregulation by stress and interaction with ATF6.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3220-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). TFII-I plays a significant role in signal transduction. TFII-I is phosphorylated at serine/threonine and tyrosine residues, and its activity is regulated by phosphorylation (22.Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Regulation of TFII-I by phosphorylation.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33443-33448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It has also been acknowledged that ERK phosphorylates TFII-I in vitro at serines 627 and 633 and thereby regulates its promoter binding activity (23.Kim D.W. Cochran B.H. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase binds to TFII-I and regulates its activation of the c-fos promoter.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1140-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Hence it can be suggested that the ERK pathway may participate in regulation of GRP78 transcription. Activation of the MEK/ERK pathway is a common cause for resistance of cells to apoptosis mediated by the death receptor and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways (24.Roberts P.J. Der C.J. Targeting the Raf-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade for the treatment of cancer.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3291-3310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2186) Google Scholar, 25.Hersey P. Zhuang L. Zhang X.D. Current strategies in overcoming resistance of cancer cells to apoptosis melanoma as a model.Int. Rev. Cytol. 2006; 251: 131-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this regard, we examined the potential interaction between the UPR and MEK/ERK pathway in regulation of sensitivity of breast carcinoma cells to ER stress-induced apoptosis. Thus regulation of the MEK/ERK pathway by any therapeutic agent may effectively interfere with GRP78 gene transcription, which might be effective in inducing apoptosis in breast cancer cells. On the basis of the above discussion, which highlights the importance of the cross-talk between ER stress and the MEK/ERK pathway in induction of cancer cell apoptosis, our present work was focused on exploring the possibility of inducing apoptosis in TNBC cells by targeting ER stress and MEK/ERK pathways with a synthetic dihydropyrimidone, nifetepimine. Our laboratory has previously identified nifetepimine as a potential immune-restoring agent in tumor bearers (26.Ghosh S. Adhikary A. Chakraborty S. Nandi P. Mohanty S. Chakraborty S. Bhattacharjee P. Mukherjee S. Putatunda S. Chakraborty S. Chakraborty A. Sa G. Das T. Sen P.C. Nifetepimine, a dihydropyrimidone, ensures CD4+ T cell survival in tumor micro-environment by maneuvering sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA).J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 32881-32896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here we have explored the role of nifetepimine in inducing apoptosis in TNBC cells in both in vitro and in vivo models. Underlying molecular mechanisms revealed that nifetepimine regulates GRP78 gene transcription by down-regulating phospho-ERK expression in TNBC cells and thereby induces significant apoptosis in breast cancer cells in vitro. The efficacy of nifetepimine was also justified from tumor regression in in vivo mice models. Our study thus reports for the first time an intricate mechanism of nifetepimine-mediated cancer regression in triple negative breast cancer cells and also suggests the role of nifetepimine as a possible therapeutic agent with a strong immunmodulatory and anti-carcinogenic effect, which can be used to treat patients with cancer. The human mammary epithelial carcinoma cells (MDAMB-231 and MDAMB-468; maintained in complete DMEM) were obtained from NCCS, India. Male Swiss albino mice were obtained from Chittaranjan National Cancer Research Institute, Kolkata, India. The SCID mice experiments were performed in NCCS, Pune. All ethical guidelines of the animal ethics committee of the Institute for handling and performing of the experiments were followed. Nifetepimine has been synthesized using 3-nitrobenzaldehyde, ethyl acetoacetate, and urea as described (26.Ghosh S. Adhikary A. Chakraborty S. Nandi P. Mohanty S. Chakraborty S. Bhattacharjee P. Mukherjee S. Putatunda S. Chakraborty S. Chakraborty A. Sa G. Das T. Sen P.C. Nifetepimine, a dihydropyrimidone, ensures CD4+ T cell survival in tumor micro-environment by maneuvering sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA).J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 32881-32896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For in vitro studies, 50 μm nifetepimine was used and for in vivo studies, 10 mg/kg body weight (EAC bearing mice) and 15 mg/kg body weight (SCID mice) were used. Male Swiss albino mice (20 g) were randomly divided into four groups of 10 animals each including (i) untreated set (non-tumor bearing), (ii) EAC bearing set (which were intraperitoneally injected with 1 × 106 exponentially grown EACs in 0.25 ml sterile PBS), (iii) nifetepimine-treated set (non-tumor-bearing), and (iv) nifetepimine-treated tumor bearing set. The detailed experiments were performed using nifetepimine at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight (injected intraperitoneally) as identified from our previous studies (26.Ghosh S. Adhikary A. Chakraborty S. Nandi P. Mohanty S. Chakraborty S. Bhattacharjee P. Mukherjee S. Putatunda S. Chakraborty S. Chakraborty A. Sa G. Das T. Sen P.C. Nifetepimine, a dihydropyrimidone, ensures CD4+ T cell survival in tumor micro-environment by maneuvering sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA).J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 32881-32896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Untreated mice received dimethyl sulfoxide instead of nifetepimine. For the SCID mice experiments the mice were divided into two groups with 4 mice in each group (i) tumor-bearing set (injected with 2 × 106 MDAMB-231 cells with Matrigel (1:1) in the mammary fat pad) and (ii) nifetepimine-treated tumor bearing set (15 mg/kg body weight injected at the site of the tumor). After 7 doses of nifetepimine injection, the mice were sacrificed and the tumors were collected for immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Tumor volume was measured on every date of treatment and tumor weight was evaluated following sacrifice of the mice. Cytosolic calcium concentration was measured using a fluorimetric ratio technique. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended at a density of 106 cells/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin and incubated in the dark with Fura-2AM (final concentration 5 μm) (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature under slow agitation. Cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in calcium-free Hanks' buffered saline solution (135 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 11.6 mm Hepes, 11.5 mm glucose adjusted to pH 7.3 with NaOH) prior to measurements. After centrifugation, 0.5 to 1 × 106 cells were suspended in 3 ml of Hanks' buffered saline solution in a quartz cuvette and inserted into a Hitachi spectrofluorimeter equipped with a stirring apparatus and a thermostatted (37 °C) cuvette holder, and connected to a PC computer. The fluorescence was recorded at 510 nm in the spectrofluorometer using an excitation source of 340 or 380 nm. Maximum Fura-2 fluorescence (Fmax) was obtained by adding 1 μm ionomycin (Sigma) to the cell suspension in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2, and minimum fluorescence (Fmin) was determined without added calcium in the presence of 5 mm EGTA (Sigma). The cytosolic [Ca2+] was calculated from the Fura-2AM fluorescence intensity as: [Ca2+]cyt = Kd (F − Fmin)/(Fmax − F), where Kd = 224 nm for Fura-2 and R is the ratio of fluorescence values (F) (R = F340/F380). The effect of nifetepimine on triple negative breast cancer cell death was assessed by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Briefly, MDAMB-231 and MDAMB-468 cells were plated and allowed to grow at 37 °C. Both cells were treated with nifetepimine and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide was added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Isopropyl alcohol was added to the cells and absorbance was measured in an ELISA reader (Bio-Rad) at 570 nm. Viability of the cells was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion test. The cells (10 μl suspension) were placed on coverslips at the required dilutions; each coverslip was placed cell-side down onto a slide containing a drop of 0.125% trypan blue dye (w/v in sterile isotonic saline). Using gentle pressure with gauze at the coverslip edges only, excess dye solution was removed. The slides were viewed within 10 min with a light microscope at ×40 and 50 to 100 cells were counted. Viable cells remained unstained, whereas the nuclei of non-viable cells were stained blue. The ratio of viable cells to the total number of cells counted was recorded as a percent viability for each coverslip. Cells/ml = the number of cells per quadrant equals 104 cells/ml (50 cells per quadrant = 0.5 million cells/ml); total cells: cells/ml × original volume; and cell viability (%) = total viable cells (unstained)/total cells (stained and unstained) × 100 were used. For the determination of cell death, cells were stained with propidium iodide and annexin V-FITC (BD Pharmingen) and analyzed on a flow cytometer (FACS Calibur, BD Bioscience) equipped with 488 nm argon laser light source, using Cell Quest Software (BD Biosciences). Electronic compensation of the instrument was done to exclude overlapping of the emission spectra. 10,000 total events were acquired for analysis using Cell Quest software. Annexin V/7-AAD positive cells were regarded as apoptotic cells. Briefly cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in each Petri dish in DMEM for 16–20 h. Thereafter the cells were treated with nifetepimine at 50 μm for 24 h. At the end of treatment the cells were collected and fixed with 100% methanol for 5 min at −20 °C. After centrifugation, the cell pellets were collected with 4 μg/ml of propidium iodide solution containing 100 μg/ml of RNase and 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Subsequently, the samples were analyzed in a FACS calibur system (BD Biosciences) using CellQuest software. The percentage of cell cycle phases was analyzed by ModFit LT software (version 2.0, BD Biosciences). Histogram display of DNA content (x axis, PI fluorescence) versus counts (y axis) has been displayed. CellQuest statistics was employed to quantitate the data at different phases of cell cycle. MDAMB-231 and MDAMB-468 cells were lysed in buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm DTT) and nuclei were pelleted by a brief centrifugation. The supernatant was spun at 100,000 × g to get a cytosolic fraction. The nuclear extract was prepared in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 420 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF. All buffers were supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures. For direct Western blot analysis, cell lysates of the particular fractions containing 30 μg of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membrane. The protein levels of GRP78 (Sigma), cleaved caspase-9 and -3, pERK, pJAK, TFII-I, and caspase-4 was determined with specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For immunoprecipitation studies GRP78 and caspase-4 immune complexes were immunoprecipitated using GRP78 antibody with Protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). The immunopurified were immunoblotted with caspase-4 antibody. Similarly to study the phosphorylation status of TFII-I, at first TFII-I was immune precipitated and then immunoblotted with phosphoserine and phosphotyrosine antibodies (Sigma). The protein of interest was visualized by chemiluminescence. Equal protein loading was confirmed by reprobing the blots with α-actin/histone H1/GAPDH antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For the identification of subcellular localization of TFII-I under different conditions, the MDAMB-231 cells were fixed with 4% p-formaldehyde and permeabilized with Triton X-100. Cells were then stained with anti-TFII-I antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by FITC-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized with a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For live cell imaging of calcium, MDAMB-231 and MDAMB-468 cells were treated with nifetepimine for 4 and 8 h and incubated with Fluo-3AM in Hanks' buffered saline solution for 30 min and then visualized with a BD Bioscience Pathway microscope. GRP78 mRNA was estimated using a semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR method. Briefly, total RNA from cells was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed and amplified using the U.S. Biochemical Corp. RT-PCR kit and TaqMan DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions by 30 cycles (each cycle consisting of 30 s at 94 °C, 2 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C). The primers used were 5′-GGTGAAGAGGATACAGCAGAAA (sense) and 5′-GACACAGCTAGGGTTCACAATA (antisense). MDAMB-231 and MDAMB-468 cells were transfected with 300 pmol of GRP-78-siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and MEK siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) separately for 12 h. Levels of the respective proteins were estimated by Western blotting. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed using CHIP assay kit (Millipore) following the manufacturer's instructions. Isolated chromatin was precipitated with TFII-I antibody. Input DNA, rabbit IgG-pulled DNA, served as controls for all the experiments. Immunoprecipitated DNA was then subjected to 40 cycles of PCR using primers for the respective promoter regions, 5′-CATTGGTGGCCGTTAAGAATGACCAG (forward) and 5′-AGTATCGAGCGCGCCGTCGC (reverse), yielding a 223-bp product. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter was used as a nonspecific control for all CHIP experiments. Histological studies of liver and heart tissue of EAC bearing mice were carried out after nifetepimine administration. The MDAMB-231 tumors (control and nifetepimine treated) were excised and also subjected to histological studies using hematoxylin and eosin staining. The expression profiles of pERK were analyzed by immunofluorescence in tissue sections using anti-pERK antibody and visualized under confocal microscopy (Zeiss). Values are shown as mean ± S.E. except otherwise indicated. Data were analyzed and, when appropriate, significance of the differences between mean values was determined by a Student's t test. Results were considered significant at p < 0.05. Most of the current commercially available anti-cancer therapies induce apoptosis in various cell types, however, they are found to be mostly ineffective against the triple negative cells lacking estrogen, progesterone, and Her2/neu receptors. Our previous studies have already reported nifetepimine as a potent immune restorative agent in tumor bearers but the effect of nifetepimine on triple negative breast cancer is yet to be investigated. To reach the goal, triple negative human breast carcinoma cell lines, MDAMB-231 and MDAMB-468, were selected. Prior to application on TNBC cells we treated hormone receptor positive MCF-7 cells with nifetepimine and observed that a dose-dependent cell death occurred, producing about 45% of cell death at 50 μm (Fig. 1A, left panel). But because many commercial anti-cancer agents can induce apoptosis in MCF-7 we shifted our focus to the more resistant TNBC cells. Thus, both MDAMB-231 and MDAMB-468 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of nifetepimine for 0 to 24 h and the percentage of cell death was assessed to be about 42% at a dose of 50 μm after 24 h in MDAMB-231 cells (Fig. 1A, middle panel) and about 39% at the dose of 50 μm at 24 h in MDAMB-468 cells (Fig. 1A, right panel). Next we performed a time-dependent experiment and also observed cell death of about 40% in both MDAMB-231 and MDAMB-468 (Fig. 1B) at 24 h at a fixed concentration of 50 μm. As evident from our previous studies as well as our present findings treatment with 50 μm nifetepimine for 24 h was the optimum dose and time (Fig. 1C, left panel) because higher doses resulted in death of peripheral blood mononuclear cells thereby restricting us to use a dose of 50 μm for further studies. We also found that doses beyond 50 μm also generated toxicity in MCF-10A cells (Fig. 1C, right panel) and hence a 50 μm dose was selected for all further experiments. MCF-10A, MDAMB-231, and MDAMB-468 cell death was further reconfirmed using trypan blue exclusion assay (Fig. 1D). Nifetepimine was also found to increase the MDAMB-231 and MDAMB-468 cell population in the sub G0/G1 phase (Fig. 1E). The percentage of cell apoptosis was further reinstated to about 40% in both MDAMB-231 and MDAMB-468 cells (Fig. 1F) using Annexin V-PI staining. During apoptosis, a series of proteolytic cleavages of various intracellular polypeptides are initiated by the action of a unique family of serine/threonine proteases called caspases. The molecular mechanisms involving nifetepimine-induced cell death were delineated and we observed that nifetepimine induced processing of procaspase-9 and -3 in a time-dependent manner in both MDAMB-231 (Fig. 1G, left panel) and MDAMB-468 cells (Fig. 1G, right panel), thereby resulting in caspase activation. In conformity with this we also found that pre-treatment of these cells with cell-permeable inhibitors of caspase-9, caspase-3, as well as pan-caspase inhibitor followed by nifetepimine treatment significantly abrogated nifetepimine-triggered cell death cl"
https://openalex.org/W2149545540,"Previous investigations that have studied motor unit firing rates following strength training have been limited to small muscles, isometric training, or interventions involving exercise machines. We examined the effects of ten weeks of supervised barbell deadlift training on motor unit firing rates for the vastus lateralis and rectus femoris during a 50% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) assessment. Twenty-four previously untrained men (mean age = 24 years) were randomly assigned to training (n = 15) or control (n = 9) groups. Before and following the intervention, the subjects performed isometric testing of the right knee extensors while bipolar surface electromyographic signals were detected from the two muscles. The signals were decomposed into their constituent motor unit action potential trains, and motor units that demonstrated accuracy levels less than 92.0% were not considered for analysis. One thousand eight hundred ninety-two and 2,013 motor units were examined for the vastus lateralis and rectus femoris, respectively. Regression analyses were used to determine the linear slope coefficients (pulses per second [pps]/% MVC) and y-intercepts (pps) of the mean firing rate and firing rate at recruitment versus recruitment threshold relationships. Deadlift training significantly improved knee extensor MVC force (Cohen's d = .70), but did not influence force steadiness. Training had no influence on the slopes and y-intercepts for the mean firing rate and firing rate at recruitment versus recruitment threshold relationships. In agreement with previous cross-sectional comparisons and randomized control trials, our findings do not support the notion that strength training affects the submaximal control of motor units."
https://openalex.org/W1973615482,"HTRA2, a serine protease in the intermembrane space, has important functions in mitochondrial stress signaling while its abnormal activity may contribute to the development of Parkinson's disease. Mice with a missense or null mutation of Htra2 fail to thrive, suffer striatal neuronal loss, and a parkinsonian phenotype that leads to death at 30-40 days of age. While informative, these mouse models cannot separate neural contributions from systemic effects due to the complex phenotypes of HTRA2 deficiency. Hence, we developed mice carrying a Htra2-floxed allele to query the consequences of tissue-specific HTRA2 deficiency. We found that mice with neural-specific deletion of Htra2 exhibited atrophy of the thymus and spleen, cessation to gain weight past postnatal (P) day 18, neurological symptoms including ataxia and complete penetrance of premature death by P40. Histologically, increased apoptosis was detected in the cerebellum, and to a lesser degree in the striatum and the entorhinal cortex, from P25. Even earlier at P20, mitochondria in the cerebella already exhibited abnormal morphology, including swelling, vesiculation, and fragmentation of the cristae. Furthermore, the onset of these structural anomalies was accompanied by defective processing of OPA1, a key molecule for mitochondrial fusion and cristae remodeling, leading to depletion of the L-isoform. Together, these findings suggest that HTRA2 is essential for maintenance of the mitochondrial integrity in neurons. Without functional HTRA2, a lifespan as short as 40 days accumulates a large quantity of dysfunctional mitochondria that contributes to the demise of mutant mice."
https://openalex.org/W1995356743,"Gaining the full activity of the insulin receptor (IR) requires the proteolytic cleavage of its proform by intra-Golgi furin-like activity. In mammalian cells, IR is expressed as two isoforms (IRB and IRA) that are responsible for insulin action. However, only IRA transmits the growth-promoting and mitogenic effects of insulin-like growth factor 2. Here we demonstrate that the two IR isoforms are similarly cleaved by furin, but when this furin-dependent maturation is inefficient, IR proforms move to the cell surface where the proprotein convertase PACE4 selectively supports IRB maturation. Therefore, in situations of impaired furin activity, the proteolytic maturation of IRB is greater than that of IRA, and accordingly, the amount of phosphorylated IRB is also greater than that of IRA. We highlight the ability of a particular proprotein convertase inhibitor to effectively reduce the maturation of IRA and its associated mitogenic signaling without altering the signals emanating from IRB. In conclusion, the selective PACE4-dependent maturation of IRB occurs when furin activity is reduced; accordingly, the pharmacological inhibition of furin reduces IRA maturation and its mitogenic potential without altering the insulin effects.Background: The insulin receptor exists as two isoforms: IRA and IRB.Results: IRA and IRB are similarly matured by furin, but when furin activity is reduced, IRB is matured by PACE4.Conclusion: Proprotein convertase inhibition can selectively reduce IRA maturation and its signaling.Significance: This can be considered as a new opportunity to target IRA signaling in cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2040530855,"Maduramicin, a polyether ionophore antibiotic derived from the bacterium Actinomadura yumaensis, is currently used as a feed additive against coccidiosis in poultry worldwide. It has been clinically observed that maduramicin can cause skeletal muscle and heart cell damage, resulting in skeletal muscle degeneration, heart failure, and even death in animals and humans, if improperly used. However, the mechanism of its toxic action in myoblasts is not well understood. Using mouse myoblasts (C2C12) and human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD and Rh30) cells as an experimental model for myoblasts, here we found that maduramicin inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. Further studies revealed that maduramicin induced accumulation of the cells at G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, and induced apoptosis in the cells. Concurrently, maduramicin downregulated protein expression of cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4 and CDK6), and CDC25A, and upregulated expression of the CDK inhibitors (p21Cip1 and p27Kip1), resulting in decreased phosphorylation of Rb. Maduramicin also induced expression of BAK, BAD, DR4, TRADD and TRAIL, leading to activation of caspases 8, 9 and 3 as well as cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). Taken together, our results suggest that maduramicin executes its toxicity in myoblasts at least by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptotic cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2026106393,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded Latent Membrane Protein 2A (LMP2A) is an EBV latency-associated protein regularly expressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In B cells, LMP2A activity resembles that of a constitutively activated antigen receptor, which recruits the Syk tyrosine kinase to activate a set of downstream signaling pathways. LMP2A also downregulates cellular Syk levels. In the present study, we demonstrate that Syk interacts with the integrin β4 subunit (ITGβ4) of integrin α6β4 in epithelial cells and that concurrent LMP2A expression interferes with this interaction by competitive binding to Syk. We find that both Syk and LMP2A have an effect on ITGβ4 cell surface expression. However, in LMP2A expressing cells, ITGβ4 remains concentrated at the cellular protrusions, an expression pattern characteristic of motile cells, including NPC-derived epithelial cells. This effect of LMP2A on ITGβ4 localization is associated with a greater propensity for migration and invasion in-vitro, and may contribute to the invasive property of LMP2A-expressing NPC."

Face processing has been associated with the occipito-temporal cortex (OT). The present study investigated whether face processing in healthy adults can be modulated by applying tDCS over the OT. Experiment 1 investigated whether tDCS can affect N170, a face-sensitive ERP component, with a face orientation judgment task. The N170 in the right hemisphere was reduced in active stimulation conditions compared with the sham stimulation condition for both upright faces and inverted faces. Experiment 2 further demonstrated that tDCS can modulate the composite face effect, a type of holistic processing that reflects the obligatory attention to all parts of a face. The composite face effect was reduced in active stimulation conditions compared with the sham stimulation condition. Additionally, the current polarity did not modulate the effect of tDCS in the two experiments. The present study demonstrates that N170 can be causally manipulated by stimulating the OT with weak currents. Furthermore, our study provides evidence that obligatory attention to all parts of a face can be affected by the commonly used tDCS parameter setting."
https://openalex.org/W2082719657,"Normal thymus function reflects interactions between developing T-cells and several thymic stroma cell types. Within the stroma, key functions reside in the distinct cortical and medullary thymic epithelial cell (TEC) types. It has been demonstrated that, during organogenesis, all TECs can be derived from a common thymic epithelial progenitor cell (TEPC). The properties of this common progenitor are thus of interest. Differentiation of both cTEC and mTEC depends on the epithelial-specific transcription factor FOXN1, although formation of the common TEPC from which the TEC lineage originates does not require FOXN1. Here, we have used a revertible severely hypomorphic allele of Foxn1, Foxn1R, to test the stability of the common TEPC in vivo. By reactivating Foxn1 expression postnatally in Foxn1R/- mice we demonstrate that functional TEPCs can persist in the thymic rudiment until at least 6 months of age, and retain the potential to give rise to both cortical and medullary thymic epithelial cells (cTECs and mTECs). These data demonstrate that the TEPC-state is remarkably stable in vivo under conditions of low Foxn1 expression, suggesting that manipulation of FOXN1 activity may prove a valuable method for long term maintenance of TEPC in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2070580553,"The identification of key tumorigenic events in Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) subgroup medulloblastomas (MBSHH) will be essential for the development of individualized therapies and improved outcomes. However, beyond confirmation of characteristic SHH pathway mutations, recent genome-wide sequencing studies have not revealed commonly mutated genes with widespread relevance as potential therapeutic targets. We therefore examined any role for epigenetic DNA methylation events in MBSHH using a cross-species approach to candidate identification, prioritization and validation. MBSHH-associated DNA methylation events were first identified in 216 subgrouped human medulloblastomas (50 MBSHH, 28 Wnt/Wingless, 44 Group 3 and 94 Group 4) and their conservation then assessed in tumors arising from four independent murine models of Shh medulloblastoma, alongside any role in tumorigenesis using functional assessments in mouse and human models. This strategy identified widespread regional CpG hypo-methylation of VAV1, leading to its elevated expression, as a conserved aberrant epigenetic event, which characterizes the majority of MBSHH tumors in both species, and is associated with a poor outcome in MBSHH patients. Moreover, direct modulation of VAV1 in mouse and human models revealed a critical role in tumor maintenance, and its abrogation markedly reduced medulloblastoma growth. Further, Vav1 activity regulated granule neuron precursor germinal zone exit and migration initiation in an ex vivo model of early postnatal cerebellar development. These findings establish VAV1 as a critical epigenetically regulated oncogene with a key role in MBSHH maintenance, and highlight its potential as a validated therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker for the improved therapy of medulloblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2057514430,"DEAF1 is a transcriptional regulator associated with autoimmune and neurological disorders and is known to bind TTCG motifs. To further ascertain preferred DEAF1 DNA ligands, we screened a random oligonucleotide library containing an “anchored” CpG motif. We identified a binding consensus that generally conformed to a repeated TTCGGG motif, with the two invariant CpG dinucleotides separated by 6–11 nucleotides. Alteration of the consensus surrounding the dual CpG dinucleotides, or cytosine methylation of a single CpG half-site, eliminated DEAF1 binding. A sequence within the Htr1a promoter that resembles the binding consensus but contains a single CpG motif was confirmed to have low affinity binding with DEAF1. A DEAF1 binding consensus was identified in the EIF4G3 promoter and ChIP assay showed endogenous DEAF1 was bound to the region. We conclude that DEAF1 preferentially binds variably spaced and unmethylated CpG-containing half-sites when they occur within an appropriate consensus."
https://openalex.org/W2021411370,"Motoneurons are furnished with a vast repertoire of ionotropic and metabotropic receptors as well as ion channels responsible for maintaining the resting membrane potential and involved in the regulation of the mechanisms underlying its membrane excitability and firing properties. Among them, the GABAA receptors, which respond to GABA binding by allowing the flow of Cl− ions across the membrane, mediate two distinct forms of inhibition in the mature nervous system, phasic and tonic, upon activation of synaptic or extrasynaptic receptors, respectively. In a previous work we showed that furosemide facilitates the monosynaptic reflex without affecting the dorsal root potential. Our data also revealed a tonic inhibition mediated by GABAA receptors activated in motoneurons by ambient GABA. These data suggested that the high affinity GABAA extrasynaptic receptors may have an important role in motor control, though the molecular nature of these receptors was not determined. By combining electrophysiological, immunofluorescence and molecular biology techniques with pharmacological tools here we show that GABAA receptors containing the α6 subunit are expressed in adult turtle spinal motoneurons and can function as extrasynaptic receptors responsible for tonic inhibition. These results expand our understanding of the role of GABAA receptors in motoneuron tonic inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1965570309,"Detachment of non-malignant epithelial cells from the extracellular matrix causes their apoptosis, a phenomenon called anoikis. By contrast, carcinoma cells are anoikis-resistant, and this resistance is thought to be critical for tumor progression. Many oncogenes trigger not only anti- but also pr-apoptotic signals. The proapoptotic events represent an aspect of a phenomenon called oncogenic stress, which acts as a safeguard mechanism blocking tumor initiation. In cells that become malignant, oncogene-induced antiapoptotic signals outbalance the proapoptotic ones. It is now thought that treatments blocking the antiapoptotic events but preserving the proapoptotic signals can be particularly effective in killing tumor cells. Whether or not oncogenes induce any proanoikis signals that can be used for enhancing the efficiency of approaches aimed at triggering anoikis of cancer cells has never been explored. β-Catenin is a major oncoprotein that is often activated in colorectal cancer and promotes tumor progression via mechanisms that are understood only in part. We found here that β-catenin triggers both anti- and proanoikis signals in colon cancer cells. We observed that the antianoikis signals prevail and the cells become anoikis-resistant. We further established that one proanoikis signal in these cells is triggered by β-catenin-induced downregulation of an apoptosis inhibitor tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and subsequent reduction of the activity of a transcription factor NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB), a mediator of TNFR1 signaling. We also found that the effect of β-catenin on TNFR1 requires the presence of transcription factor TCF1, a β-catenin effector. We demonstrated that ablation of β-catenin in colon cancer cells triggers their anoikis and that this anoikis is enhanced even further if low TNFR1 or NF-κB activity is artificially preserved in the β-catenin-deprived cells. Thus, inhibition of TNFR1 or NF-κB activity can be expected to enhance the efficiency of approaches aimed at blocking β-catenin-driven anoikis resistance of colon carcinoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2017680185,"Background Kazakhstan has been inhabited by different populations, such as the Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Uzbek and others. Here we investigate allelic and haplotypic polymorphisms of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes at DRB1, DQA1 and DQB1 loci in the Kazakh ethnic group, and their genetic relationship between world populations. Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 157 unrelated Kazakh ethnic individuals from Astana were genotyped using sequence based typing (SBT-Method) for HLA-DRB1, -DQA1 and -DQB1 loci. Allele frequencies, neighbor-joining method, and multidimensional scaling analysis have been obtained for comparison with other world populations. Statistical analyses were performed using Arlequin v3.11. Applying the software PAST v. 2.17 the resulting genetic distance matrix was used for a multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS). Respectively 37, 17 and 19 alleles were observed at HLA-DRB1, -DQA1 and -DQB1 loci. The most frequent alleles were HLA-DRB1*07:01 (13.1%), HLA-DQA1*03:01 (13.1%) and HLA-DQB1*03:01 (17.6%). In the observed group of Kazakhs DRB1*07:01-DQA1*02:01-DQB1*02:01 (8.0%) was the most common three loci haplotype. DRB1*10:01-DQB1*05:01 showed the strongest linkage disequilibrium. The Kazakh population shows genetic kinship with the Kazakhs from China, Uyghurs, Mongolians, Todzhinians, Tuvinians and as well as with other Siberians and Asians. Conclusions/Significance The HLA-DRB1, -DQA1and -DQB1 loci are highly polymorphic in the Kazakh population, and this population has the closest relationship with other Asian and Siberian populations."
https://openalex.org/W1997184540,"In this paper, a simplified model of an incompressible fluid flow along with heat and mass transfer past a porous flat plate embedded in a Darcy type porous medium is investigated. The velocity, thermal and mass slip conditions are utilized that has not been discussed in the literature before. The similarity transformations are used to transform the governing partial differential equations (PDEs) into a nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The resulting system of ODEs is then reduced to a system of first order differential equations which was solved numerically by using Matlab bvp4c code. The effects of permeability, suction/injection parameter, velocity parameter and slip parameter on the structure of velocity, temperature and mass transfer rates are examined with the aid of several graphs. Moreover, observations based on Schmidt number and Soret number are also presented. The result shows, the increase in permeability of the porous medium increase the velocity and decrease the temperature profile. This happens due to a decrease in drag of the fluid flow. In the case of heat transfer, the increase in permeability and slip parameter causes an increase in heat transfer. However for the case of increase in thermal slip parameter there is a decrease in heat transfer. An increase in the mass slip parameter causes a decrease in the concentration field. The suction and injection parameter has similar effect on concentration profile as for the case of velocity profile."
https://openalex.org/W1966240538,"Abstract Calcium transients in the cell nucleus evoked by synaptic activity in hippocampal neurons function as signaling end point in synapse-to-nucleus communication. As an important regulator of neuronal gene expression, nuclear calcium is involved in the conversion of synaptic stimuli into functional and structural changes of neurons. Here we identify two synaptic organizers, Lrrtm1 and Lrrtm2, as targets of nuclear calcium signaling. Expression of both Lrrtm1 and Lrrtm2 increased in a synaptic NMDA receptor- and nuclear calcium-dependent manner in hippocampal neuron within 2 to 4 hours after the induction of action potential bursting. Induction of Lrrtm1 and Lrrtm2 occurred independently of the need for new protein synthesis, required calcium/calmodulin (CaM) dependent protein kinases and the nuclear calcium signaling target, CREB binding protein (CBP). Analysis of reporter gene constructs revealed a functional CRE in the proximal promoter of Lrrtm2 indicating that, at least Lrrtm2, is regulated by the classical nuclear calcium- CaMKIV-CREB/CBP pathway. These results suggest that one mechanism by which nuclear calcium signaling controls neuronal network function is by regulating the expression of Lrrtm1 and Lrrtm2."
https://openalex.org/W1975412997,"Larvae of the Northern pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pinivora, TP) carry microscopic needles (setae), which by penetrating skin and mucous membranes, may cause inflammatory/immune derived symptoms in man. In the present study the stimulatory effects of setae on human blood lymphocytes in vitro was investigated. Blood mononuclear cells were separated from venous blood or buffy coat of ten healthy individuals, six previously exposed to setae and four with no known exposure. Lymphoproliferation was measured as uptake of 3H-thymidine. Setae were prepared from TP larvae. Setae and saline setae extracts stimulated proliferation of T-lymphocytes in the presence of monocytic cells. Stimulation was pronounced in cells from persons who had been exposed to setae, and weak in cells from non-exposed donors. Chitin also induced lymphocyte proliferation in most donors, but to a lesser extent and independently of donor's previous exposure to setae. In conclusion, setae contain molecules that in the presence of monocytes activate human T-lymphocytes to proliferation. The antigenic nature of stimulatory molecules was supported by the significantly stronger lymphocyte response in persons previously exposed to setae than in non-exposed donors. The nature of such molecules remains to be defined."
https://openalex.org/W1979563528,"Sequence similarity tools, such as BLAST, seek sequences most similar to a query from a database of sequences. They return results significantly similar to the query sequence and that are typically highly similar to each other. Most sequence analysis tasks in bioinformatics require an exploratory approach, where the initial results guide the user to new searches. However, diversity has not yet been considered an integral component of sequence search tools for this discipline. Some redundancy can be avoided by introducing non-redundancy during database construction, but it is not feasible to dynamically set a level of non-redundancy tailored to a query sequence. We introduce the problem of diverse search and browsing in sequence databases that produce non-redundant results optimized for any given query. We define diversity measures for sequences and propose methods to obtain diverse results extracted from current sequence similarity search tools. We also propose a new measure to evaluate the diversity of a set of sequences that is returned as a result of a sequence similarity query. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in post-processing BLAST and PSI-BLAST results. We also assess the functional diversity of the returned results based on available Gene Ontology annotations. Additionally, we include a comparison with a current redundancy elimination tool, CD-HIT. Our experiments show that the proposed methods are able to achieve more diverse yet significant result sets compared to static non-redundancy approaches. In both sequence-based and functional diversity evaluation, the proposed diversification methods significantly outperform original BLAST results and other baselines.
