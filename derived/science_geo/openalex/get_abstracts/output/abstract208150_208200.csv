https://openalex.org/W1620372854,"Popular opinion about artificial intelligence has passed through two phases. A generation ago, very few people believed that any machine could ever think as a man does. Now, however, it is widely held that this goal wiir be reached quite soon, perhaps in our lifetimes. It is my thesis that the second of these attitudes is nearly as unsophisticated as the first. Yesterday's skepticism was based on ignorance of the capacities of machines; today's con-"

Seven newborns developed tumors, three of which were diagnosed as fibrosarcomas, in 2 to 6 weeks; none of the adults have tumors after 11 weeks. Virus was demonstrated in two of the tumors by injecting a tumor-suspension preparation into the chick wing-web where tumors subsequently appeared. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that sarcomas have developed in primates after a virus has been injected."

https://openalex.org/W2019498571,"After fertilization of the sea urchin egg the rate of protein synthesis by a cell-free ribosomal system increases markedly. This increase can be attributed to newly synthesized messenger RNA, since (i) the rate of polypeptide synthesis elicited by synthetic messenger polyribonucleotides changes only slightly after fertilization, and (ii) the enzymes for the formation of amino acyl transfer RNA's of phenylalanine and leucine and the polymerization of polypeptide are in excess in the unfertilized egg. Polypeptide synthesis has been characterized in development to the gastrula stage."

https://openalex.org/W1972499252,"IT is a well-established fact that the uptake of bacteria by phagocytes is enhanced by serum factors (opsonins) acting on bacterial surface. The importance of serum opsonins in the phagocytosis of bacteria by fixed macro-phages of the reticulo-endothelial system has been demonstrated by organ perfusion technique. It has been shown that serum factors playing a part in bacterial opsonization include immune or natural antibody, complement and possibly a third unidentified factor1,2."

https://openalex.org/W1989234493,"A WELL-ESTABLISHED fact in clinical dermatology is the frequent occurrence of dermatitis caused by bichromates (hexavalent chromium), while dermatitis caused by trivalent chromium compounds (for example, chromium sulphate) is very rare or non-existent. This seems to be in contradiction with the prevalent opinion that protein-affinity enhances for a given substance its sensitizing capacity. It appeared to me from a large number of experiments with guinea pigs that it is relatively easy to sensitize guinea pigs for chromium with trivalent chromium compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2052747788,"PREVIOUS observations in this laboratory have indicated that the injection of catecholamines and certain posterior pituitary polypeptides into the lateral ventricle of the cat is associated with characteristic and drug-specific pressor–depressor responses of the peripheral circulation1. During the course of these earlier experiments, it was noted that the intraventricular introduction of posterior pituitary polypeptides was followed by a prompt increase of flow in urine. Other observers have reported that the peripheral administration of various posterior pituitary preparations may, on occasion, be attended by a rise of urine flow consequent to a solute diuresis2,3. The present experiments were designed to define certain aspects of the ‘diuretic’ effect of these drugs during their central administration."

https://openalex.org/W1998996419,"WHILE investigating the effect of large doses of fractions of blood on the survival of rat skin homografts, it was found that intraperitoneal injections of an α2-protein fraction from human, rat, rabbit, or bovine sera could prolong the survival of homografts in outbred albino rats. At the time of writing, 4 of 20 of these grafts have survived for eight and 4 of a further 20 for six months and are still apparently healthy. This fraction was prepared from whole serum by a modification of the chromatographic method of Steinbuch and Quentin1 on DEAE cellulose. Of Steinbuch and Quentin's three fractions only that eluted with 0.5 molar pH. 5 acetate buffer was effective. Kamrin2 had previously produced a marked prolongation of survival of rat skin homografts by injecting a series of plasma fractions, of which the most potent contained the highest concentration of α2-protein. It seems, therefore, that the fractions used by Kamrin and the fraction I have used probably contain a common active principle."

This process could be repeated until the fertile population was eradicated without the mating required by Knipling's models. This method may be of use in ecology and in economic control of populations."
