https://openalex.org/W123677889,"A broad spectral absorbance band in the near infrared region of cytochrome oxidase* (cf. Fig. 1) was first reported by Griffiths and Wharton (2). They observed that this band near 830 rnp disappeared on complete reduction of the enzyme by substrate and reappeared on reoxidation. The rate of these changes was roughly equivalent to the rate of the changes observed in the a-peak at 605 rnp. In addition, they found that in the presence of cyanide the chromophore could be reduced but could not be reosidized. Recent,ly, Gibson and Greenwood2 observed, through the use of rapid reaction techniques, that the kinetics of the changes in the absorbance of cytochrome oxidase in the near infrared region and in the or-band were essentially identical, These data support the hypothesis that the chromophore absorbing near 830 rnp is an integral component of cytochrome oxidase, but they do not identify the chromophore. The accumulatâ€™ing evidence that many copper-containing prot,eins exhibit absorption bands in the near infrared region (3-6), together with the demonstration that purified preparations of cytochrome oxidase contain copper (2, 7-12), directed our attention toward the possibliity that this metal may be a constituent of the chromophore in question. In this communication, experiments are described that establish a precise correlation among the intensity of the near infrared band, the copper content, and specific activity. This correlation persists as the values of these entities are decreased or obliterated by a variety of treatments and are partially restored by others."

https://openalex.org/W58278699,"Growth of Hemophilus parainjluenzae requires the formation of an electron transport system consisting of six cytochrome components (1). As a compensatory mechanism for changing environment, this bacterium can modify the cytochrome oxidase composition and the proportions of the cytochromes during conditions where there is no cell division (2). The intact bacterium has remarkable permeability to many substrates that reduce the respiratory pigments and produce an oxygen uptake (3). n-Lactate, L-lactate, succinate, reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide, and formate added to washed suspensions of this bacterium produce rapid rates of oxygen utilization (3). The dehydrogenases for these substrates are part of the membranebound electron transport system (3). Rupture of the bacteria with alumina releases the glycolytic enzymes and disrupts the respiratory activity produced by intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (3). The membrane fragments isolated from bacteria ruptured with alumina contain the substrate-stimulated oxygen uptake properties and the substrate-reducible dehydrogenases and cytochromes found in the intact cells (1, 3). This report presents evidence indicating that each of these five substrates reduces a distinct membrane-bound dehydrogenase, that these dehydrogenases are very likely flavoproteins, and that each dehydrogenase can be formed differentially during different growth conditions. The great variability in the composition of the cytochrome and flavoprotein components of the electron transport systems during conditions of limited net growth suggests that each respiratory pigment is added individually to the membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1997446812,"MUSCLE owes its morphological and biochemical identity to proteins such as actin, myosin, tropomyosin, etc.,1 and it is reasonable to suspect that these molecules are somehow represented in the genome. Until rather recently, it was generally believed that all new proteins are manufactured by freshly made messenger RNA's of exceedingly short half-lives. However, recently it has become rather evident that there are at least a few systems in which genetic messages are sent many generations before they are used2. Is this the case with myogenesis, or is the necessary information for muscle differentiation sent shortly before it is called into play ?"
