https://openalex.org/W2510993966,"Orthopedic implants containing biodegradable magnesium have been used for fracture repair with considerable efficacy; however, the underlying mechanisms by which these implants improve fracture healing remain elusive. Here we show the formation of abundant new bone at peripheral cortical sites after intramedullary implantation of a pin containing ultrapure magnesium into the intact distal femur in rats. This response was accompanied by substantial increases of neuronal calcitonin gene-related polypeptide-α (CGRP) in both the peripheral cortex of the femur and the ipsilateral dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Surgical removal of the periosteum, capsaicin denervation of sensory nerves or knockdown in vivo of the CGRP-receptor-encoding genes Calcrl or Ramp1 substantially reversed the magnesium-induced osteogenesis that we observed in this model. Overexpression of these genes, however, enhanced magnesium-induced osteogenesis. We further found that an elevation of extracellular magnesium induces magnesium transporter 1 (MAGT1)-dependent and transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 7 (TRPM7)-dependent magnesium entry, as well as an increase in intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the accumulation of terminal synaptic vesicles in isolated rat DRG neurons. In isolated rat periosteum-derived stem cells, CGRP induces CALCRL- and RAMP1-dependent activation of cAMP-responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1) and SP7 (also known as osterix), and thus enhances osteogenic differentiation of these stem cells. Furthermore, we have developed an innovative, magnesium-containing intramedullary nail that facilitates femur fracture repair in rats with ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis. Taken together, these findings reveal a previously undefined role of magnesium in promoting CGRP-mediated osteogenic differentiation, which suggests the therapeutic potential of this ion in orthopedics."
https://openalex.org/W2514790758,"In response to the current global health emergency posed by the Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak and its link to microcephaly and other neurological conditions, we performed a drug repurposing screen of ∼6,000 compounds that included approved drugs, clinical trial drug candidates and pharmacologically active compounds; we identified compounds that either inhibit ZIKV infection or suppress infection-induced caspase-3 activity in different neural cells. A pan-caspase inhibitor, emricasan, inhibited ZIKV-induced increases in caspase-3 activity and protected human cortical neural progenitors in both monolayer and three-dimensional organoid cultures. Ten structurally unrelated inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases inhibited ZIKV replication. Niclosamide, a category B anthelmintic drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, also inhibited ZIKV replication. Finally, combination treatments using one compound from each category (neuroprotective and antiviral) further increased protection of human neural progenitors and astrocytes from ZIKV-induced cell death. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy and identify lead compounds for anti-ZIKV drug development."

https://openalex.org/W2507192932,"The field of biocatalysis has advanced from harnessing natural enzymes to using directed evolution to obtain new biocatalysts with tailor-made functions. Several tools have recently been developed to expand the natural enzymatic repertoire with abiotic reactions. For example, artificial metalloenzymes, which combine the versatile reaction scope of transition metals with the beneficial catalytic features of enzymes, offer an attractive means to engineer new reactions. Three complementary strategies exist: repurposing natural metalloenzymes for abiotic transformations; in silico metalloenzyme (re-)design; and incorporation of abiotic cofactors into proteins. The third strategy offers the opportunity to design a wide variety of artificial metalloenzymes for non-natural reactions. However, many metal cofactors are inhibited by cellular components and therefore require purification of the scaffold protein. This limits the throughput of genetic optimization schemes applied to artificial metalloenzymes and their applicability in vivo to expand natural metabolism. Here we report the compartmentalization and in vivo evolution of an artificial metalloenzyme for olefin metathesis, which represents an archetypal organometallic reaction without equivalent in nature. Building on previous work on an artificial metallohydrolase, we exploit the periplasm of Escherichia coli as a reaction compartment for the 'metathase' because it offers an auspicious environment for artificial metalloenzymes, mainly owing to low concentrations of inhibitors such as glutathione, which has recently been identified as a major inhibitor. This strategy facilitated the assembly of a functional metathase in vivo and its directed evolution with substantially increased throughput compared to conventional approaches that rely on purified protein variants. The evolved metathase compares favourably with commercial catalysts, shows activity for different metathesis substrates and can be further evolved in different directions by adjusting the workflow. Our results represent the systematic implementation and evolution of an artificial metalloenzyme that catalyses an abiotic reaction in vivo, with potential applications in, for example, non-natural metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2507608410,"Detection of more than 1,000 different T-cell specificities in parallel facilitates identification of cancer and autoimmune antigens. Identification of the peptides recognized by individual T cells is important for understanding and treating immune-related diseases. Current cytometry-based approaches are limited to the simultaneous screening of 10–100 distinct T-cell specificities in one sample. Here we use peptide–major histocompatibility complex (MHC) multimers labeled with individual DNA barcodes to screen >1,000 peptide specificities in a single sample, and detect low-frequency CD8 T cells specific for virus- or cancer-restricted antigens. When analyzing T-cell recognition of shared melanoma antigens before and after adoptive cell therapy in melanoma patients, we observe a greater number of melanoma-specific T-cell populations compared with cytometry-based approaches. Furthermore, we detect neoepitope-specific T cells in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and peripheral blood from patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Barcode-labeled pMHC multimers enable the combination of functional T-cell analysis with large-scale epitope recognition profiling for the characterization of T-cell recognition in various diseases, including in small clinical samples."
https://openalex.org/W2512442926,"Cyclin-dependent kinases 12 and 13 (CDK12 and CDK13) play critical roles in the regulation of gene transcription. However, the absence of CDK12 and CDK13 inhibitors has hindered the ability to investigate the consequences of their inhibition in healthy cells and cancer cells. Here we describe the rational design of a first-in-class CDK12 and CDK13 covalent inhibitor, THZ531. Co-crystallization of THZ531 with CDK12-cyclin K indicates that THZ531 irreversibly targets a cysteine located outside the kinase domain. THZ531 causes a loss of gene expression with concurrent loss of elongating and hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II. In particular, THZ531 substantially decreases the expression of DNA damage response genes and key super-enhancer-associated transcription factor genes. Coincident with transcriptional perturbation, THZ531 dramatically induced apoptotic cell death. Small molecules capable of specifically targeting CDK12 and CDK13 may thus help identify cancer subtypes that are particularly dependent on their kinase activities."

https://openalex.org/W2509535979,"We recently discovered a structurally novel class of endogenous lipids, branched palmitic acid esters of hydroxy stearic acids (PAHSAs), with beneficial metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects. We tested whether PAHSAs protect against colitis, which is a chronic inflammatory disease driven predominantly by defects in the innate mucosal barrier and adaptive immune system. There is an unmet clinical need for safe and well tolerated oral therapeutics with direct anti-inflammatory effects. Wild-type mice were pretreated orally with vehicle or 5-PAHSA (10 mg/kg) and 9-PAHSA (5 mg/kg) once daily for 3 days, followed by 10 days of either 0% or 2% dextran sulfate sodium water with continued vehicle or PAHSA treatment. The colon was collected for histopathology, gene expression, and flow cytometry. Intestinal crypt fractions were prepared for ex vivo bactericidal assays. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells pretreated with vehicle or PAHSA and splenic CD4+ T cells from syngeneic mice were co-cultured to assess antigen presentation and T cell activation in response to LPS. PAHSA treatment prevented weight loss, improved colitis scores (stool consistency, hematochezia, and mouse appearance), and augmented intestinal crypt Paneth cell bactericidal potency via a mechanism that may involve GPR120. In vitro, PAHSAs attenuated dendritic cell activation and subsequent T cell proliferation and Th1 polarization. The anti-inflammatory effects of PAHSAs in vivo resulted in reduced colonic T cell activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression. These anti-inflammatory effects appear to be partially GPR120-dependent. We conclude that PAHSA treatment regulates innate and adaptive immune responses to prevent mucosal damage and protect against colitis. Thus, PAHSAs may be a novel treatment for colitis and related inflammation-driven diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2508267175,"Background Depression during adolescence is a serious mental health problem. Difficulties in regulating evoked emotions after stressful life events are considered to lead to depression. This study examined if depressive symptoms were mediated by various cognitive emotion regulation strategies after stressful life events, more specifically, the loss of a loved one, health threats or relational challenges. Methods We used a sample of 398 adolescents (Mage = 16.94, SD = 2.90), including 52 depressed outpatients, who all reported stressful life event(s). Path analyses in Mplus were used to test mediation, for the whole sample as well as separately for participants scoring high versus low on depression, using multigroup analyses. Results Health threats and relational challenging stressful life events were associated with depressive symptoms, while loss was not. More frequent use of maladaptive strategies was related to more depressive symptoms. More frequent use of adaptive strategies was related to less depressive symptoms. Specific life events were associated with specific emotion regulation strategies. The relationship between challenging, stressful life events and depressive symptoms in the whole group was mediated by maladaptive strategies (self-blame, catastrophizing and rumination). No mediation effect was found for adaptive strategies. Conclusion The association between relational challenging, stressful life events and depressive symptoms was mediated by maladaptive, cognitive emotion regulation strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2509038340,"Biochemical and genetic strategies demonstrate that the antifungal natural product beauvericin targets both multidrug efflux and TOR signaling to limit drug resistance and to sensitize resistant pathogens to drug treatment during infection. There is an urgent need for new strategies to treat invasive fungal infections, which are a leading cause of human mortality. Here, we establish two activities of the natural product beauvericin, which potentiates the activity of the most widely deployed class of antifungal against the leading human fungal pathogens, blocks the emergence of drug resistance, and renders antifungal-resistant pathogens responsive to treatment in mammalian infection models. Harnessing genome sequencing of beauvericin-resistant mutants, affinity purification of a biotinylated beauvericin analog, and biochemical and genetic assays reveals that beauvericin blocks multidrug efflux and inhibits the global regulator TORC1 kinase, thereby activating the protein kinase CK2 and inhibiting the molecular chaperone Hsp90. Substitutions in the multidrug transporter Pdr5 that enable beauvericin efflux impair antifungal efflux, thereby impeding resistance to the drug combination. Thus, dual targeting of multidrug efflux and TOR signaling provides a powerful, broadly effective therapeutic strategy for treating fungal infectious disease that evades resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2509229026,"An appropriate inflammatory response plays critical roles in eliminating pathogens, whereas an excessive inflammatory response can cause tissue damage. Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), a master regulator of hematopoiesis, plays critical roles in T cells; however, its roles in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated inflammation in macrophages are unclear. Here, we demonstrated that upon TLR4 ligand stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), macrophages reduced the expression levels of RUNX1. Silencing of Runx1 attenuated the LPS-induced IL-1β and IL-6 production levels, but the TNF-α levels were not affected. Overexpression of RUNX1 promoted IL-1β and IL-6 production in response to LPS stimulation. Moreover, RUNX1 interacted with the NF-κB subunit p50, and coexpression of RUNX1 with p50 further enhanced the NF-κB luciferase activity. Importantly, treatment with the RUNX1 inhibitor, Ro 5-3335, protected mice from LPS-induced endotoxic shock and substantially reduced the IL-6 levels.

However, excessive inflammation can cause tissue damage, leading to sepsis and death. Sepsis often occurs in patients with infection and is the leading cause of death in hospitalized patients (2.Deutschman C.S. Tracey K.J.

Currently, exploring new effectors as potential targets to prevent sepsis are still under extensive investigation. Macrophages play critical roles in sepsis by regulating inflammation (7.Shalova I.N.

Macrophages can recognize pathogens through Toll-like receptors and produce various proinflammatory cytokines through transcription factor activation, such as nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (9.Aderem A. Role of Toll-like receptors in inflammatory response in macrophages.Crit. Care Med. 2001; 29: S16-S18Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The NF-κB family consists of five members: p50/p105, p52/p100, p65 (RelA), RelB, and c-Rel. They share an evolutionarily conserved Rel homology region and can form heterodimers or homodimers (10.Vallabhapurapu S. Karin M. Regulation and function of NF-κB transcription factors in the immune system.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 693-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar). The precursors of p50 subunit and p52 subunit are p105 and p100, respectively (11.Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. NF-κB-inducing kinase regulates the processing of NF-κB2 p100.Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). However, both p50 and p52 lack a transcription activation domain, and they may inhibit transcription unless they interact with other NF-κB family members or other transcription factors containing a transcription activation domain (10.Vallabhapurapu S. Karin M. Regulation and function of NF-κB transcription factors in the immune system.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 693-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar). The p50-p65 heterodimer is the classical NF-κB family member (12.Urban M.B. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. NF-kappa B contacts DNA by a heterodimer of the p50 and p65 subunit.EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The runx family, another group of key transcription factors, is composed of RUNX1 (also known as acute myeloid leukemia 1 (AML1)), RUNX2, and RUNX3 (13.Ito Y. Bae S.C. Chuang L.S. The RUNX family: developmental regulators in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2015; 15: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In humans, RUNX1 is one of the genes most frequently altered by chromosome translocation and point mutations in acute myelogenous leukemia (14.Osato M. Point mutations in the RUNX1/AML1 gene: another actor in RUNX leukemia.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4284-4296Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).

Previous studies suggest that RUNX1 mediates transactivation of Rorc to promote TH17 differentiation and interacts with RORγt to induce IL-17 production (26.Lazarevic V. Chen X. Shim J.H. Hwang E.S.

Immunol. 2011; 12: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Interestingly, RUNX1 is required for the optimal expression of Foxp3 in natural regulatory T cells and also interacts physically with FOXP3 (27.Rudra D. Egawa T. Chong M.M. Treuting P. Littman D.R.

Moreover, RUNX1 deficiency in CD4+ T cells causes lethal lung inflammation (28.Wong W.F. Kohu K. Nakamura A. Ebina M. Kikuchi T. Tazawa R. Tanaka K. Kon S. Funaki T. Sugahara-Tobinai A. Looi C.Y.

Immunol. 2012; 188: 5408-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although a role for RUNX1 has been suggested in T cells, it remains unclear about how RUNX1 regulates TLR4-mediated inflammation in macrophages. Previous studies reported that RUNX1 could promote STAT3 activation and inhibit the expression of SOCS3/4 in epithelial cancer (29.Scheitz C.J. Lee T.S. McDermitt D.J. Tumbar T. Defining a tissue stem cell-driven Runx1/Stat3 signalling axis in epithelial cancer.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 4124-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The SOCS family, especially SOCS3/4, plays a negative regulatory role in TLR4-mediated inflammation (30.Elliott J. Johnston J.A. SOCS: role in inflammation, allergy and homeostasis.Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 434-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this study, we asked whether RUNX1 played vital roles in TLR4-mediated inflammation. We found that RUNX1 interacted with the NF-κB subunit p50 to enhance the production of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages, such as IL-1β and IL-6, and a RUNX1 inhibitor, Ro 5-3335, could protect mice from LPS-induced shock. Our data identify RUNX1 as a positive regulator in macrophage inflammatory responses via the p50 pathway. To explore the role of RUNX1 in macrophages, we first examined whether RUNX1 expression was regulated in response to TLR4 agonist (LPS) stimulation at the mRNA and protein levels. RUNX1 was expressed in the human monocytic cell line, THP-1, mouse macrophage-like cell line, RAW264.7, and primary mouse peritoneal macrophages (PEMs) (Fig. 1, A–C). The purity of CD11b+ F4/80+ PEMs was analyzed by FACS (supplemental Fig. S1). In response to LPS stimulation, RUNX1 expression at the mRNA level was significantly reduced in all these cells (Fig. 1, A–C, i.e. ∼6 h). We also detected a substantial decrease of RUNX1 at the protein level in these cells following LPS treatment (Fig. 1D, supplemental Fig. S2, A–B). To determine whether other stimuli affect the expression of Runx1 in macrophages, macrophages were stimulated with IL-1β, IL-6, or TNF-α. However, these cytokines did not modulate Runx1 mRNA and protein expression in PEMs (supplemental Fig. S3). These results demonstrate that RUNX1 is constitutively expressed in macrophages, and TLR4 activation decreases RUNX1 levels in macrophages. To study the role of RUNX1 in primary macrophages, we used specific siRNA to knockdown Runx1 in PEMs. The mRNA levels of Runx1 decreased by 70% in the siRunx1-transfected PEMs compared with the negative controls (Fig. 1E). The knockdown efficiency was also confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1E). Next, we analyzed the effects of Runx1 silencing on the production of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages. In response to LPS, the siRunx1-transfected PEMs produced diminished inflammatory cytokine expression at the mRNA level, including Il-1β and Il-6, but not Tnf-α, compared with the controls (Fig. 1F). We also examined IL-6 concentrations using an ELISA kit, and we confirmed that Runx1-silenced PEMs produced lower IL-6 levels than control cells at the indicated times (6, 12, and 24 h) (Fig. 1G). In addition to Il-1β or Il-6, the mRNA levels of other LPS-dependent genes including Il-12b, Csf2, and Ccl3 were also decreased in the siRunx1-transfected PEMs (supplemental Fig. S4, A–C). To further confirm the effect of RUNX1 on TLR4-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines, we overexpressed RUNX1 in RAW 264.7 cells. Upon LPS treatment, RAW 264.7 cells that overexpressed RUNX1 had profoundly enhanced Il-6 and Il-1β expression levels, but not Tnf-α, compared with control cells that overexpressed GFP (Fig. 2A). Additionally, RUNX1 overexpression also induced RAW 264.7 cells to secrete more IL-6 into the supernatant, as detected by ELISA (Fig. 2B). As the RUNX1 inhibitor, Ro 5-3335 has been previously well described (31.Cunningham L. Finckbeiner S. Hyde R.K. Southall N. Marugan J. Yedavalli V.R. Dehdashti S.J. Reinhold W.C. Alemu L. Zhao L.

Jeang K.T. et al.Identification of benzodiazepine Ro5–3335 as an inhibitor of CBF leukemia through quantitative high throughput screen against RUNX1-CBFβ interaction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 14592-14597Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we next examined whether it could inhibit TLR4-triggered production of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages. As shown in Fig. 2, C–E, Ro 5-3335 substantially blocked the expression of Il-6 at the mRNA and protein level in THP-1 cells, RAW 264.7 cells, and PEMs. We also found that Ro 5-3335 could inhibit the expression of Il-6 in PEMs stimulated with the TLR2 agonist, PGN, but not the TLR3 agonist, poly(I:C), or the TLR9 agonist, CpG (supplemental Fig. S5). These findings indicate that RUNX1 might positively regulate the TLR4 signaling pathway and proinflammatory cytokine production in macrophages. MAPKs and NF-κB signaling have critical roles in the induction of inflammatory cytokine production (32.Hommes D.W. Peppelenbosch M.P. van Deventer S.J. Mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase signal transduction pathways and novel anti-inflammatory targets.Gut. 2003; 52: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 33.Hoffmann A. Natoli G. Ghosh G. Transcriptional regulation via the NF-κB signaling module.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6706-6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). To reveal the function of RUNX1 in the TLR4 signaling pathway, we first analyzed the phosphorylation levels of MAPKs and NF-κB. Fig. 3, A–B, shows that Runx1 knockdown did not affect the ERK, JNK, p38, or p65 phosphorylation levels in PEMs. Additionally, we did not detect IκBα degradation differences between the Runx1-silenced and wild type PEMs (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the RUNX1 inhibitor, Ro 5-3335, did not affect p65 phosphorylation levels or IκBα degradation in PEMs (supplemental Fig. S6). Because RUNX1 is predominantly located in the nucleus (34.Yoshida N. Ogata T. Tanabe K. Li S. Nakazato M. Kohu K. Takafuta T. Shapiro S. Ohta Y. Satake M. Watanabe T. Filamin A-bound PEBP2β/CBFβ is retained in the cytoplasm and prevented from functioning as a partner of the Runx1 transcription factor.Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), it is possible that RUNX1 might physically interact with or cooperate with other transcription factors in the nuclei to regulate inflammation. In agreement with this speculation, we observed that treatment with the NF-κB inhibitor, BAY 11-7082, strictly abrogated LPS-induced IL-6 and IL-1β production in the GFP control or RUNX1-overexpressing macrophages (Fig. 3C). Next, we examined the effect of RUNX1 on NF-κB activation using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Although RUNX1 expression alone did not induce activation of the reporter gene in 293T cell, co-expression of RUNX1 and the NF-κB family members, p105, p50, or p65, significantly increased the NF-κB reporter activity compared with co-expression of the GFP control (Fig. 3D). The RUNX1 inhibitor, Ro 5-3335, partly reversed the synergized effect between RUNX1 and p50, p65, or p105 (Fig. 3E). We next investigated whether RUNX1 could interact with p105, p50, or p65. 293T cells were transiently transfected with RUNX1 together with p105, p50, p65, or the GFP-myc vector control. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-p50/p105, p65, or anti-Myc antibodies. We noticed that RUNX1 preferred to be coprecipitated with p50, compared with the other NF-κB family members including p105 and p65 (Fig. 4A). Immunoprecipitation using an anti-RUNX1 antibody was also performed, which indeed pulled down p50 (Fig. 4B). Next, we asked whether RUNX1 interacted with the endogenous p50, and confirmed the endogenous interaction between RUNX1 and p50 in THP-1 cells (Fig. 4C). The interaction between RUNX1 and p50 was not significantly changed by LPS treatment in RAW 264.7 at early time points (30 or 60 min), which overexpressed RUNX1 (Fig. 4D). These findings suggest that RUNX1 might regulate TLR4 signaling and proinflammatory cytokine production by binding to p50. We further investigated whether RUNX1 could affect the recruitment of p50 to the Il-6 promoter using a ChIP analysis. Consistent with previous reports (35.Yamamoto M. Yamazaki S. Uematsu S. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Kuwata H. Takeuchi O. Takeshige K. Saitoh T. Yamaoka S. Yamamoto N. Yamamoto S.

Cell. 2002; 9: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), the levels of p50 on the Il-6 promoter were unchanged in macrophages in response to LPS treatment, and the RUNX1 inhibitor did not affect the recruitment of p50 to the Il-6 promoter (supplemental Fig. S7, left panel). However, the RUNX1 inhibitor greatly reduced the levels of RNA polymerase II binding to the Il-6 promoter (supplemental Fig. S7, right panel). These results support the role of RUNX1 in regulating IL-6 transcript in macrophages after LPS stimulation. We then sought to determine which domain of RUNX1 could interact with p50. Different truncations of RUNX1 were constructed, including the N-terminal fragment (R1–242), the C-terminal fragment (R243–453), and the Runt domain (R50–178) (Fig. 4E). We noticed that all of these truncations could interact with p50 (Fig. 4F). This interaction is similar to the interaction between RUNX1 and Ets-1; both N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of RUNX1 can bind to Ets-1 (37.Kim W.Y. Sieweke M. Ogawa E. Wee H.J. Englmeier U. Graf T. Ito Y. Mutual activation of Ets-1 and AML1 DNA binding by direct interaction of their autoinhibitory domains.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1609-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To further determine which domain of RUNX1 was responsible for NF-κB activation, we overexpressed different truncations of RUNX1 in RAW 264.7 cells. Following LPS stimulation, the C-terminal fragment and the full-length RUNX1 showed enhanced IL-6 expression, but the N-terminal fragment showed no significant effect (Fig. 4G). These results indicate that RUNX1 is dependent on its C-terminal region to augment TLR4-NF-κB activity. Excessive TLR4-NF-κB activation is critical for the induction of sepsis that is accompanied by exacerbated inflammatory responses (6.Zhang Y. Lu Y. Ma L. Cao X. Xiao J. Chen J. Jiao S. Gao Y. Liu C. Duan Z. Li D. He Y. Wei B. Wang H.

To investigate the in vivo role of RUNX1 in inflammation, we utilized a murine endotoxic shock model via intraperitoneal injection of a lethal dose of LPS. LPS induced death in over 80% of mice at 20 h, whereas the RUNX1 inhibitor, Ro 5-3335, significantly improved the mouse survival rates at 20 h, 48 h, or longer time points when used at 5 mg/kg (Fig. 5A). We further examined the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in various organs and serum in these mice. Unexpectedly, we observed no significant differences in the Il-1β, Il-6, or Tnf-α mRNA levels in the liver, spleen, lungs, or serum IL-6 concentrations at 3 h after the Ro 5-3335 intervention when compared with the DMSO control mice. 5M. Luo, S. Zhou, D. Feng, J. Xiao, W. Li, C. Xu, H. Wang and T. Zhou, unpublished data. However, the Il-6 mRNA levels were selectively decreased in the kidneys of the treated mice at a later stage (i.e. 24 h) (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that the RUNX1 inhibitor may resolve IL-6 production in the kidneys and protect against LPS-induced septic shock. Excessive TLR4-NF-κB signaling is closely related to uncontrolled inflammation, tissue damage, and septic shock (38.Wu H. Chen G. Wyburn K.R. Yin J. Bertolino P. Eris J.M. Alexander S.I.

However, its role is still unknown in the regulation of TLR4-NF-κB signaling in macrophages. In the current study, we found that RUNX1 mRNA and protein expression levels decreased following LPS stimulation in macrophages. Silencing of Runx1 and treatment with the RUNX1 inhibitor, Ro 5-3335, attenuated the expression of Il-6 and Il-1β, but not Tnf-α, in mouse peritoneal macrophages, RAW 264.7 cells, and human THP-1 cells. In agreement with this, RUNX1 overexpression enhanced the production of TLR4-induced IL-6 and IL-1β. These findings indicate that RUNX1 is a positive regulator of the TLR4 pathway for the induction of the inflammatory response. Our study is consistent with previous findings that RUNX1 could promote STAT3 phosphorylation by inhibiting SOCS3/4 expression in epithelial cancer cells (29.Scheitz C.J. Lee T.S. McDermitt D.J. Tumbar T. Defining a tissue stem cell-driven Runx1/Stat3 signalling axis in epithelial cancer.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 4124-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and STAT3 is a major signal component in IL-6 signaling (43.Bromberg J. Wang T.C. Inflammation and cancer: IL-6 and STAT3 complete the link.Cancer Cell. 2009; 15: 79-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Although another recent study reported that RUNX1 inhibits NF-κB signaling by blocking the activity of the IκB kinase in leukemia (44.Nakagawa M. Shimabe M. Watanabe-Okochi N. Arai S. Yoshimi A.

These contradictory observations might be due to the different cell types that were used and treated with different experimental methods. In our study, we also determined whether RUNX1 affected expression of the MyD88-independent genes, such as Ifn-β and Ccl5. No significant difference of their expression was detected at the mRNA levels in RAW 264.7 cells overexpressed by either GFP or RUNX1 (supplemental Fig. S8, A and B).

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a novel clinical therapeutic target in many chronic airway diseases related with tissue remodeling.

Expression levels of E-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin, α-smooth muscle actin (SMA), histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), and HDAC4 were determined by western blotting and/or immunofluorescent staining. Hyperacetylation of histone H2 and H4 by TSA was measured by western blotting. After siHDAC transfection, the effects of HDAC2 and HDAC4 silencing on expression of E-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin, α-SMA, HDAC2, and HDAC4 in TGF-β1-induced A549 were determined by RT-PCR and/or western blotting. We assessed the change in migration capacity of A549 cells by using cell migration assay and transwell invasion assay.TGF-β1 altered mRNA and protein expression levels of EMT markers including E-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin, α-SMA, slug, and snail in A549 cells. Inhibition and silencing of HDAC2 and HDAC4 by TSA and siRNA enhanced TGF-β1-induced EMT in A549 cells. TSA blocked the effect of TGF-β1 on the migratory ability of A549 cells. In experiments using PNECs and inferior turbinate organ cultures, TSA suppressed expression of EMT markers induced by TGF-β1.We showed that EMT is induced by TGF-β1 in airway epithelial cells and nasal tissue via activation of HDAC2 and HDAC4, and that inhibition of HDAC2 and HDAC4 by TSA reduces TGF-β1-induced EMT. This observation indicates that histone deacetylase inhibitors such as TSA could be potential candidates for treatment of recalcitrant CRS related with tissue remodeling."

Loss of KATP channel function due to mutations in ABCC8 or KCNJ11, genes encoding the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) or the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir6.2, respectively, results in congenital hyperinsulinism. Many SUR1 mutations prevent trafficking of channel proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. Channel inhibitors, including sulfonylureas and carbamazepine, have been shown to correct channel trafficking defects. In the present study, we identified 13 novel SUR1 mutations that cause channel trafficking defects, the majority of which are amenable to pharmacological rescue by glibenclamide and carbamazepine. By contrast, none of the mutant channels were rescued by KATP channel openers. Cross-linking experiments showed that KATP channel inhibitors promoted interactions between the N terminus of Kir6.2 and SUR1, whereas channel openers did not, suggesting the inhibitors enhance intersubunit interactions to overcome channel biogenesis and trafficking defects. Functional studies of rescued mutant channels indicate that most mutants rescued to the cell surface exhibited WT-like sensitivity to ATP, MgADP, and diazoxide. In intact cells, recovery of channel function upon trafficking rescue by reversible sulfonylureas or carbamazepine was facilitated by the KATP channel opener diazoxide.

https://openalex.org/W2511075865,"Site selectivity of protein N-linked glycosylation is dependent on many factors, including accessibility of the modification site, amino acid composition of the glycosylation consensus sequence, and cellular localization of target proteins. Previous studies have shown that the bacterial oligosaccharyltransferase, PglB, of Campylobacter jejuni favors acceptor proteins with consensus sequences ((D/E)X1NX2(S/T), where X1,2 ≠ proline) in flexible, solvent-exposed motifs; however, several native glycoproteins are known to harbor consensus sequences within structured regions of the acceptor protein, suggesting that unfolding or partial unfolding is required for efficient N-linked glycosylation in the native environment. To derive insight into these observations, we generated structural homology models of the N-linked glycoproteome of C. jejuni. This evaluation highlights the potential diversity of secondary structural conformations of previously identified N-linked glycosylation sequons. Detailed assessment of PglB activity with a structurally characterized acceptor protein, PEB3, demonstrated that this natively folded substrate protein is not efficiently glycosylated in vitro, whereas structural destabilization increases glycosylation efficiency. Furthermore, in vivo glycosylation studies in both glyco-competent Escherichia coli and the native system, C. jejuni, revealed that efficient glycosylation of glycoproteins, AcrA and PEB3, depends on translocation to the periplasmic space via the general secretory pathway. Our studies provide quantitative evidence that many acceptor proteins are likely to be N-linked-glycosylated before complete folding and suggest that PglB activity is coupled to general secretion-mediated translocation to the periplasm. This work extends our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying N-linked glycosylation in bacteria."

The coatings were deposited on Si and 316L stainless steel substrates by magnetron sputtering in an Ar+CH4 mixed atmosphere and were examined for elemental composition, chemical bonds, surface topography, surface electrical charge and biocompatible characteristics. The net surface charge was evaluated at nano and macroscopic scale by measuring the electrical potential and work function, respectively. The biocompatible tests comprised determination of cell viability and cell attachment to the coated surface. The deposited coatings had C/(metal+Si) ratios close to unity, while a mixture of metallic carbide, free-carbon and oxidized species formed on the film surface. The coatings' surfaces were smooth and no influence of surface roughness on electrical charge or biocompatibility was found. The biocompatible characteristics correlated well with the electrical potential/work function, suggesting a significant role of surface charge in improving biocompatibility, particularly cell attachment to coating's surface. Replacement of either Ti or Ta by Si in the (TiZrNbTaHf)C coating led to an enhanced surface electrical charge, as well as to superior biocompatible properties, with best results for the (TiZrNbSiHf)C coating."
https://openalex.org/W2511101410,"A wide range of insects living at higher latitudes enter diapause at the end of the warm season, which increases their chances of survival through harsh winter conditions. In this study we used RNA sequencing to identify genes involved in adult reproductive diapause in a northern fly species, Drosophila montana. Both diapausing and non-diapausing flies were reared under a critical day length and temperature, where about half of the emerging females enter diapause enabling us to eliminate the effects of varying environmental conditions on gene expression patterns of the two types of female flies.RNA sequencing revealed large differences between gene expression patterns of diapausing and non-diapausing females, especially in genes involved with metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, and metal and nucleotide binding. Differently expressed genes included several gene groups, including myosin, actin and cytochromeP450 genes, which have been previously associated with diapause. This study also identified new candidate genes, including some involved in cuticular hydrocarbon synthesis or regulation (desat1 and desat2), and acyl-CoA Δ11-desaturase activity (CG9747), and few odorant-binding protein genes (e.g. Obp44A). Also, several transposable elements (TEs) showed differential expression between the two female groups motivating future research on their roles in diapause.Our results demonstrate that the adult reproductive diapause in D. montana involves changes in the expression level of a variety of genes involved in key processes (e.g. metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis) which help diapausing females to cope with overwintering. This is consistent with the view that diapause is a complex adaptive phenotype where not only sexual maturation is arrested, but also changes in adult physiology are required in order to survive over the winter."

In the current study, the aim was to obtain deeper understanding of the effect of microgrooves on shape and orientation of osteoblast-like cells and to relate this effect to their proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. To this end, two microgrooved polystyrene (PS) substrates, differing in the width of the grooves (about 2 μm and 4 μm) and distance between individual grooves (about 6 μm and 11 μm, respectively) were fabricated using a combination of photolithography and hot embossing. MG-63 human osteosarcoma cells were cultured on these microgrooved surfaces, with unpatterned hot-embossed PS substrate as a control. Scanning electron- and fluorescence microscopy analyses showed that on patterned surfaces, the cells aligned along the microgrooves. The cells cultured on 4 μm-grooves / 11 μm-ridges surface showed a more pronounced alignment and a somewhat smaller cell area and cell perimeter as compared to cells cultured on surface with 2 μm-grooves / 6 μm-ridges or unpatterned PS. PrestoBlue analysis and quantification of DNA amounts suggested that microgrooves used in this experiment did not have a strong effect on cell metabolic activity or proliferation. However, cell differentiation towards the osteogenic lineage was significantly enhanced when MG-63 cells were cultured on the 2/6 substrate, as compared to the 4/11 substrate or unpatterned PS. This effect on osteogenic differentiation may be related to differences in cell spreading between the substrates."

After an initial characterization, by multilocus sequence analysis, of 15 strains of X. arboricola isolated from Prunus, one strain did not group into the pathovar pruni or into other pathovars of this species and therefore it was identified and defined as a X. arboricola pv. pruni look-a-like. This non-pathogenic strain and two typical strains of X. arboricola pv. pruni were selected for a whole genome and phenotype comparative analysis in features associated with the pathogenesis process in Xanthomonas. Comparative analysis among these bacterial strains isolated from Prunus spp. and the inclusion of 15 publicly available genome sequences from other pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of X. arboricola revealed variations in the phenotype associated with variations in the profiles of TonB-dependent transporters, sensors of the two-component regulatory system, methyl accepting chemotaxis proteins, components of the flagella and the type IV pilus, as well as in the repertoire of cell-wall degrading enzymes and the components of the type III secretion system and related effectors.

The aim of this analysis was to investigate the effect of supplemented AA and DHA on phospholipid metabolism.Plasma samples of a randomized, double-blind infant feeding trial were used for the analyses of phospholipid species by flow-injection mass spectrometry. Healthy term infants consumed isoenergetic formulae (intervention formula with equal amounts of AA and DHA-IF, control formula without additional AA and DHA-CF) from the first month of life until the age of 120 days. A group of breast milk (BM) -fed infants was followed as a reference.The plasma profile detected in newborns was different from 4 month old infants, irrespective of study group. Most relevant changes were seen in higher level of LPC16:1, LPC20:4, PC32:1, PC34:1 and PC36:4 and lower level of LPC18:0, LPC18:2, PC32:2, PC36:2 and several ether-linked phosphatidylcholines in newborns. The sum of all AA and DHA species at 4 month old infants in the CF group showed level of 40% (AA) and 51% (DHA) of newborns. The supplemented amount of DHA resulted in phospholipid level comparable to BM infants, but AA phospholipids were lower than in BM infants. Interestingly, relative contribution of DHA was higher in ether-linked phosphatidylcholines in CF fed infants, but IF and BM fed infants showed higher overall ether-linked phosphatidylcholines levels.In conclusion, we have shown that infant plasma phospholipid profile changes remarkably from newborn over time and is dependent on the dietary fatty acid composition. A supplementation of an infant formula with AA and DHA resulted in increased related phospholipid species."

The structure of a complex with S-adenosylhomocysteine and two molecules of tetrahydropapaverine (THP; one as the S conformer and a second in the R configuration) (dmin = 1.8 Å) revealed key features of substrate recognition. Pavine NMT converted racemic THP to laudanosine, but the enzyme showed a preference for (±)-pavine and (S)-reticuline as substrates. These structures suggest the involvement of highly conserved residues at the active site. Mutagenesis of three residues near the methyl group of SAM and the nitrogen atom of the alkaloid acceptor decreased enzyme activity without disrupting the structure of the protein. The binding site for THP provides a framework for understanding substrate specificity among numerous NMTs involved in the biosynthesis of BIAs and other specialized metabolites.

Pavine NMT converted racemic THP to laudanosine, but the enzyme showed a preference for (±)-pavine and (S)-reticuline as substrates. These structures suggest the involvement of highly conserved residues at the active site. Mutagenesis of three residues near the methyl group of SAM and the nitrogen atom of the alkaloid acceptor decreased enzyme activity without disrupting the structure of the protein. The binding site for THP provides a framework for understanding substrate specificity among numerous NMTs involved in the biosynthesis of BIAs and other specialized metabolites. This information will facilitate metabolic engineering efforts aimed at producing medicinally important compounds in heterologous systems, such as yeast.

Facchini P.J. Benzylisoquinoline alkaloid metabolism: a century of discovery and a brave new world.Plant Cell Physiol. 2013; 54: 647-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Although a large body of knowledge has been acquired on numerous enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of BIAs, many basic biochemical questions remain unanswered. The molecular structural basis of substrate recognition and catalysis among BIA biosynthetic enzymes is still poorly understood for several key conversions. This information is not only of fundamental importance in plant metabolic biochemistry, but it also establishes a framework for manipulating natural BIA biosynthetic pathways as an approach toward obtaining rare or novel compounds with desirable pharmacological properties. In particular, several efforts are under way to transfer entire BIA biosynthetic pathways found exclusively in plants to heterologous systems, such as yeast (2.Fossati E. Ekins A. Narcross L. Zhu Y. Falgueyret J.P. Beaudoin G.A. Facchini P.J. Martin V.J. Reconstitution of a 10-gene pathway for synthesis of the plant alkaloid dihydrosanguinarine in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Nat.

Biol. 2014; 10: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The ability to control and modify the substrate specificities and catalytic activities of enzymes obtained from the biosynthetic machinery found in plants will be central to the success of these metabolic engineering objectives. An ultimate goal of this ambitious work is to generate novel compounds with modifications that may improve on the pharmacological properties of naturally accessible BIAs. In addition, naturally occurring compounds that are difficult to obtain from natural sources may be produced more economically through heterologous systems. The methylation of secondary and tertiary amines occurs at several key points in BIA biosynthesis (4.Ziegler J. Facchini P.J. Alkaloid biosynthesis: metabolism and trafficking.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2008; 59: 735-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), with each conversion typically catalyzed by specific members of a unique N-methyltransferase (NMT) subclade. Three related NMTs with relatively distinct substrate specificities have been reported and include a coclaurine NMT (CNMT) involved in the formation of the branch-point intermediate (S)-reticuline (5.Kozbial P.Z. Mushegian A.R. Natural history of S-adenosylmethionine-binding proteins.BMC Struct. Biol. 2005; 5: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar); tetrahydroprotoberberine NMT (TNMT) (6.Schubert H.L.

CNMT is mainly responsible for the N-methylation of the central 1-benzylisoquinonline intermediate (S)-coclaurine, whereas TNMT primarily accepts various protoberberine alkaloids, such as (S)-canadine and (S)-stylopine. PavNMT is known to accept substrates with a pavine scaffold. Although a number of NMT variants have been isolated and characterized, the molecular structural basis of catalysis and substrate specificity has not yet been determined for any NMT involved in BIA metabolism. Sequence analysis of NMTs from BIA biosynthesis indicates <20% sequence identity with the closest structurally characterized homologues. To provide insight into the structure and function of NMTs involved with BIA biosynthesis, we report a series of structural and functional studies of PavNMT from the common meadow rue (Thalictrum flavum). Previously, reported substrate range for PavNMT was determined by detection of radioactively labeled reaction products separated by thin layer chromatography (21.Jain A. Ziegler J. Liscombe D.K. Facchini P.J. Tucker P.A. Panjikar S. Purification, crystallization and X-ray diffraction analysis of pavine N-methyltransferase from Thalictrum flavum.Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2008; 64: 1066-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Using reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry detection and quantification, the enzymatic activity of PavNMT was reevaluated with a more sensitive and quantitative assay. Enzyme assays performed using potential substrates representing several major BIA subgroups showed that PavNMT exhibited a preference for (±)-pavine and the 1-benzylisoquinoline (S)-reticuline but also accepted the protoberberines scoulerine and stylopine and, to a lesser extent, tetrahydropapaverine (THP) (Table 1). Interestingly, (R)-reticuline was not accepted as a substrate, revealing a strong stereoselectivity for (S)-reticuline. Unfortunately, most of the other substrates evaluated were only available in racemic form, and the stereospecificity of PavNMT for other alkaloid substrates cannot be determined at this time. As our crystallographic results indicate below, however, the presence of two enantiomers in the racemic mixtures of most substrates could affect the apparent kinetics in a somewhat complex manner. A racemic mixture of THP was converted by PavNMT to laudanosine with a significant amount of apparent substrate inhibition seen at higher concentrations of substrate: Km = 16 μm, Kis = 120 μm, and kcat = 0.00079 s−1 (Fig. 2B). As described below, our crystallographic results suggest that the apparent substrate inhibition (i.e. a decrease in activity at higher concentrations of substrate) probably arises from the binding of the (R)-isomer in a non-productive mode that may inhibit the enzyme at higher total concentrations of the racemic substrate. Consistent with this structural information, substrate inhibition was not detected when enantiomerically pure (S)-reticuline was used as the substrate (Fig. 2C).TABLE 1Substrate specificity profile of PavNMTAlkaloid classAlkaloidSubstrate consumedaUnder standard assay conditions: 20 μm alkaloid substrate, 20 μm SAM, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in a 40-μl reaction containing 2 μg of PavNMT protein and incubated for 1 h.%Pavine(±)-Pavine7.9 ± 1.91-Benzylisoquinoline(R,S)-Tetrahydropapaverine0.10 ± 0.01PapaverineNDbND, not detected.(S)-Reticuline9.7 ± 2.6cSpecific activity: 10.6 picokatals mg protein−1.(R)-ReticulineNDProtoberberine(R,S)-Scoulerine0.8 ± 0.1(R,S)-Stylopine2.7 ± 0.3ProtopineCryptopineNDAporphineGlaucineNDMorphinanCodeineNDSecoberberineCanadalineNDPthalideisoquinolineNoscapineNDBisbenzylisoquinolineBerbamineNDa Under standard assay conditions: 20 μm alkaloid substrate, 20 μm SAM, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in a 40-μl reaction containing 2 μg of PavNMT protein and incubated for 1 h.b ND, not detected.c Specific activity: 10.6 picokatals mg protein−1. Open table in a new tab Selenomethionine-substituted PavNMT was expressed in Escherichia coli and crystallized at pH 6.0 in a monoclinic crystal form containing two protomers in the asymmetric unit (Vm = 2.01 Å3/Da, 39% solvent). Anomalous differences and dispersive differences from data measured at three wavelengths were used to locate 29 well ordered selenium atoms from the 36 selenomethionine residues predicted based on amino acid sequence. The experimental electron density map extended to 2.8 Å resolution and allowed the autobuild module in PHENIX to construct an initial model for 588 of 794 residues (74%). Higher resolution data from native crystals extending to 2.0 Å were used to build and refine a model for 341 residues in each of the two polypeptide chains found in the asymmetric unit (Table 2). The native C terminus of each protomer is visible in each of the two copies in the asymmetric unit, but roughly 50 residues (51 in chain A and 48 in chain B) at the N terminus of each protomer are not well ordered. Of these disordered residues, 41 are derived from a non-natural sequence containing an N-terminal hexahistidine tag and the polylinker of the expression vector. As a result, only 10 and 7 residues from the native N termini of the two polypeptide chains are not sufficiently ordered to model. In the apoenzyme structure, two loops (residues 70–79 and 91–103 in chain A and residues 71–79 and 91–107 in chain B) are not sufficiently well ordered to model the protein completely. In the SAM and SAH complexes, however, only residues 72–78 in chain A and residues 73–77 in chain B are missing, in addition to the disordered residues at the N terminus. In the SAH·(S)-THP·(R)-THP complex, the 70s loop is completely ordered in both protomers, and only the N-terminal residues are disordered. Because all of these structures are determined in essentially the same crystal form with two copies in the asymmetric unit, the presence of order and disorder in specific loops does not appear to be related to crystal packing effects. Instead, it appears that the binding of each substrate induces a stepwise change in conformation of the protein that is consistent with an ordered sequence for substrate binding.TABLE 2Crystallographic statisticsCrystalSeMetApoenzymeSAM complexSAH complexSAH·THP2 complexH206A SAM complexPDB code5KN45KOC5KPG5KOK5KPCData collectionUnit cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)53.2, 72.3, 96.753.7, 72.3, 97.154.6, 72.0, 96.253.9, 72.0, 95.153.8, 71.6, 95.254.2, 71.7, 96.3β (degrees)99.699.899.099.2599.299.0Wavelength (Å)0.979150.979320.953690.9840.9800.9800.9800.980Resolution (Å)aValues from the outermost resolution shell are given in parentheses.40-2.8 (2.87-2.80)40-2.9 (2.97-2.90)40-2.7 (2.77-2.70)40-2.0 (2.05-2.00)40-2.3 (2.36-2.30)40-1.6 (1.64-1.60)40-1.8 (1.84-1.80)40-2.5 (2.57-2.50)RsymbRsym = Σi|Ii − 〈I〉|/Σi Ii, where Ii is the ith integrated intensity of a given reflection and 〈I〉 is the weighted mean of all measurements of I.0.118 (0.611)0.130 (0.743)0.104 (0.815)0.074 (0.794)0.087 (0.819)0.040 (0.626)0.037 (0.169)0.129 (0.820)I/σI13.6 (3.2)13.8 (2.8)16.2 (2.5)11.9 (1.5)12.2 (1.8)23.7 (2.4)24.7 (7.57)8.8 (1.9)Completeness (%)99.5 (96.5)99.6 (97.0)99.7 (99.3)94.1 (78.5)97.0 (84.6)99.6 (99.1)97.4 (92.0)99.6 (99.9)Redundancy7.5 (7.5)7.6 (7.5)7.6 (7.5)5.3 (4.0)3.8 (3.6)4.2 (4.2)4.5 (4.4)3.8 (3.8)RefinementResolution (Å)40-2.040-2.340-1.640-1.840-2.5Unique reflections47,29832,20694,28865,35925,334RworkcRwork = Σ‖Fo| − |Fc‖/Σ|Fo for 95% of reflection data used in refinement./RfreedRfree = Σ‖Fo| − |Fc‖/Σ|Fo| for 5% of reflection data excluded from refinement.0.200/0.2540.186/0.2470.197/0.2420.169/0.1980.231/0.315Total no. of atoms54395701629762615602Protein atoms53025591556157345534SAM/SAH atoms545210254Water atoms1378368242536Average B-factors (protein)44.147.225.827.543.9Average B-factors (water)40.744.031.922.836.8Average B-factors (SAM/SAH)55.722.120.9Average B-factors (THP)26.7Root mean square deviation from ideal geometryBond lengths (Å)0.0100.0110.0070.0080.013Bond angles (degrees)1.071.301.051.111.47a Values from the outermost resolution shell are given in parentheses.b Rsym = Σi|Ii − 〈I〉|/Σi Ii, where Ii is the ith integrated intensity of a given reflection and 〈I〉 is the weighted mean of all measurements of I.c Rwork = Σ‖Fo| − |Fc‖/Σ|Fo for 95% of reflection data used in refinement.d Rfree = Σ‖Fo| − |Fc‖/Σ|Fo| for 5% of reflection data excluded from refinement. Open table in a new tab The overall structure of PavNMT reveals the presence of an α/β SAM-binding domain with a canonical Rossmann fold that is shared among most SAM-dependent methyltransferases (5.Kozbial P.Z.

In addition to this domain, a primarily α-helical BIA-binding domain forms the majority of the putative binding site for the methyl group acceptor. The sequence, structure, and topology of the lid domain appear most similar to the Plasmodium phosphoethanolamine NMTs (PfPMT) (8.Lee S.G. Kim Y. Alpert T.D. Nagata A. Jez J.M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 11559-11569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (supplemental Movies 1 and 2). Although the sequence identity is <20% and the root mean square deviation for C-α atoms is over 3–4 Å after filtering away the most different parts of the structures, the fairly high DALI Z-scores (∼28–29) for these structures indicate substantial similarity in the arrangement of secondary structure elements (11.Holm L. Rosenström P. Dali server: conservation mapping in 3D.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: W545-W549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3053) Google Scholar). Three N-terminal helices that encircle and cap off the BIA-binding domain appear to be unique to PavNMT and related NMTs from plants. The functional significance of this unique structural feature is not clear at present, although some of the residues at the N terminus of helix α3 form part of the dimer interface described below. PavNMT forms a dimer with 2-fold rotational symmetry in the asymmetric unit that is not seen in homologous NMTs (Fig. 3B). Gel filtration analysis confirms that PavNMT forms a dimer in solution. Nineteen residues from each protomer form an extensive network of interactions, resulting in the formation of 12 hydrogen bonds and two ionic interactions between subunits as well as the burial of ∼1020 Å2 of accessible surface area, which is 6.5% of the total accessible surface area per subunit (Fig. 4). Although PISA (12.Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6768) Google Scholar) predicts that this putative dimer interface is only marginally stable and may not be significant in solution, most of the interfacial residues involved with hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions are conserved among eight characterized NMTs with roles in BIA biosynthesis. This observation supports the functional significance of the dimerization interface (Fig. 3). The majority of the dimer interface involves residues on the “back” side of the SAM-binding domain away from the loops that cover the “front” side and thus provide access to the active site. As a result, the loops covering the active site are located at the distal ends of the dimer. It is unclear whether the dimer structure may mediate cooperative effects with respect to substrate binding or catalysis. However, the nature of the dimer interface suggests that hinge movements between the BIA-binding domain and the SAM-binding domain of one protomer would affect the hinge movements in the second protomer. Comparisons between the structures of apo-PavNMT, the PavNMT·SAM complex, and the PavNMT·SAM·THP complex do suggest the presence of a small hinge-opening movement between the SAM-binding and BIA-binding domains that could lead to cooperative effects on substrate binding or catalysis. NMTs employ a surprisingly large variety of mechanisms to bind to SAM, although the overall architecture of the SAM-binding domain (i.e. the Rossmann fold) is highly conserved (6.Schubert H.L. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Many paths to methyltransfer: a chronicle of convergence.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 329-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 7.Gana R.

Biol. 2013; 13: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Structures of PavNMT in complex with SAM and SAH reveal a mode of cofactor binding that is most similar to Class Ia SAM-dependent NMTs (7.Gana R. Rao S. Huang H. Wu C. Vasudevan S. Structural and functional studies of S-adenosyl-l-methionine binding proteins: a ligand-centric approach.BMC Struct. Biol. 2013; 13: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The side chains of several conserved polar residues form hydrogen bonds or water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the amino group (Ser140), carboxylate group (Lys95 and Ser97), vicinal hydroxyl groups of the ribose moiety (Asn159 and Gln163), and the adenine base (Asp185), which all help position the SAM methyl donor for reaction with the BIA acceptor (Fig. 5). In addition, the highly conserved GXGXG sequence motif I runs directly underneath the ribose moiety, forming the central platform for the SAM-binding site. Sequence alignments of NMTs involved with BIA biosynthesis indicate a high level of conservation in most of the residues forming direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonds, indicating a common mechanism of substrate recognition (FIGURE 4., FIGURE 5.). It is notable that the specific interactions between SAM and PavNMT differ from the specific SAM-binding interactions seen in other NMTs, including the most closely related enzymes with known three-dimensional structures (i.e. phosphoethanolamine NMT from Plasmodium species and the mycolic acid cyclopropane synthases from M. tuberculosis). The diversity of binding modes for SAM that is seen among different NMTs has been extensively analyzed previously (5.Kozbial P.Z. Mushegian A.R. Natural history of S-adenosylmethionine-binding proteins.BMC Struct. Biol. 2005; 5: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 7.Gana R. Rao S. Huang H. Wu C. Vasudevan S. Structural and functional studies of S-adenosyl-l-methionine binding proteins: a ligand-centric approach.BMC Struct. Biol. 2013; 13: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The structure of PavNMT was also determined in the presence of the product SAH and a racemic mixture of THP. One molecule of (S)-THP lies in a binding pocket lined primarily with aromatic residues and where the secondary amino group is positioned within ∼3 Å from the position expected for the methyl donor (Fig. 6 and supplemental Movie 3). The benzyl group of (S)-THP is most deeply buried in the substrate-binding pocket, whereas the isoquinoline moiety lies in a more exposed position where the plane of the six-carbon ring is stacked in a parallel arrangement against the benzyl group of a molecule of (R)-THP. The molecule of (R)-THP appears to be bound more loosely, with fewer direct contacts with the protein than seen for the molecule of (S)-THP. The loop formed by residues 75–91 covers both THP molecules, and the structure of this loop appears to be dependent on the binding of both THP molecules, because it is disordered when THP is not bound (e.g. in the structures of the apoenzyme as well as the complexes containing SAH or SAM). The steady-state kinetic parameters for THP appear similar to those for pavine (22.Farrow S.C. Hagel J.M. Beaudoin G.A. Burns D.C. Facchini P.J. Stereochemical inversion of (S)-reticuline by a cytochrome P450 fusion in opium poppy.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2015; 11: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), except for a significant amount of apparent substrate inhibition at higher concentrations of THP. The binding of (R)-THP in a non-productive binding mode next to (S)-THP, which is bound in a productive mode, suggests that the (R)-THP may inhibit the release of products from the enzyme when higher concentrations of the racemic substrate are added to the reaction. The biological significance of the binding of (R)-THP is unclear, but the similarity in structure of (R)-THP to the physiologically important intermediate (R)-reticuline suggests that the mode of inhibition seen here may also occur under cellular conditions. The structure of the (S)-THP·(R)-THP complex also suggests that PavNMT or perhaps other NMTs may also bind to larger, more complex alkaloid intermediates like the bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids. Several hundred structures are known for these compounds, including many that have been isolated from Thalictrum species (13.Ropivia J. Derbré S. Rouger C. Pagniez F. Le Pape P. Richomme P. Isoquinolines from the roots of Thalictrum flavum L., and their evaluation as antiparasitic compounds.Molecules. 2010; 15: 6476-6484Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The role of NMTs in the biosynthesis of bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids is poorly understood, but the structure of the (S)-THP·(R)-THP complex raises the intriguing possibility that some of these compounds may be effective substrates for NMTs. Although crystals of PavNMT were grown in the presence of pavine under a wide range of conditions, including conditions identical to those used for crystallizing the PavNMT·SAH·THP2 complex, pavine was not bound at the active site of PavNMT in any crystals analyzed to date. Co-crystallization of PavNMT with (S)-reticuline, which has a structure very similar to that of (S)-THP (Fig. 1), has also failed to yield the structure of an enzyme·substrate complex, although (S)-reticuline has kinetic parameters similar to those of THP and thus appears to be an equally effective substrate. Patterns of sequence conservation at the 13 positions that line the binding pocket for (S)-THP suggest how sequence variation may determine substrate specificity in PavNMT and the other NMTs involved with BIA biosynthesis (Fig. 6). Nine positions (His232, Phe255, Leu260, Pro288, Trp295, Tyr326, Trp327, Phe330, and Tyr338) almost always contain hydrophobic or aromatic residues, but only two of these positions (Phe255 and Trp295) show a high level of sequence conservation across all NMTs. At four other positions (Phe96, Pro98, Gly291, and Phe292), there are very high levels of sequence variation. When considered in the context of substrate specificity and biological function, it is likely that these patterns of sequence variation relate to functionally important differences in substrate specificity among the broad range of BIA substrates for NMT enzymes found in these pathways. It is interesting to note that there are no direct hydrogen bonds between (S)-THP and PavNMT. Binding specificity appears to arise primarily through steric effects, van der Waals interactions, and π-stacking effects. Two highly conserved residues at the active site (Glu205 and His206) are positioned near the activated methyl group of SAM, but these residues do not appear to have specific roles in substrate binding (FIGURE 4., FIGURE 5., FIGURE 6.). These residues are conserved in all of the NMTs involved with BIA biosynthesis as well as most other less closely related NMTs. Replacement of each residue with Ala results in a small decrease in protein stability as observed through a slight reduction in melting temperature determined using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) and the dye 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate (Table 3). Replacement of both residues with alanine leads to a larger decrease in Tm, but the overall structure appears intact when monitored by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Moreover, the crystal structure of the H206A mutant confirms that the mutation does not affect the structure of the protein, apart from slight changes in the immediate region around the side chain at the active site. As expected, the addition of THP and SAH either one at a time or together stabilize the wild-type protein and each mutant in a roughly additive manner, confirming that mutations at these positions affect catalysis more than substrate binding.TABLE 3Melting transition temperatures as determined by differential scanning fluorimetry using 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonateEnzyme/mutantTmaValues are determined from the average of duplicate measurements, which typically differ by <0.2 °C.

Time-series Poisson regression models were applied to analyze the association between air pollution and epilepsy.A 10 μg/m3 increase of NO2, SO2, and O3 concentrations corresponded to 3.17% (95%Cl: 1.41%, 4.93%), 3.55% (95%Cl: 1.93%, 5.18%), and -0.84% (95%Cl: -1.58%, 0.09%) increase in outpatient-visits for epilepsy on the concurrent days, which were significantly influenced by sex and age. The effects of NO2 and SO2 would be stronger when adjusted for PM2.5. As for O3, a -1.14% (95%Cl: -1.90%, -0.39%) decrease was evidenced when adjusted for NO2. The lag models showed that the most significant effects were evidenced on concurrent days.We discovered previously undocumented relationships between short-term air pollution exposure and epilepsy: while NO2 and SO2 were positively associated with outpatient-visits of epilepsy, O3 might be associated with reduced risk."
https://openalex.org/W2510132231,"Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a negative regulator of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) through its role to degrade angiotensin II. In rats with subtotal nephrectomy (STNx), adverse cardiac remodelling occurs despite elevated cardiac ACE2 activity. We hypothesised that diminazene aceturate (DIZE), which has been described as having an off-target effect to activate ACE2, would have beneficial cardiac effects in STNx rats. STNx led to hypertension, diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and increased cardiac ACE, ACE2, Ang II and Ang 1–7 levels. Cardiac gene expression of ADAM17 was also increased. In STNx, two-weeks of subcutaneous DIZE (15mg/kg/d) had no effect on blood pressure but improved diastolic dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis, reduced ADAM17 mRNA and shifted the cardiac RAS balance to a cardioprotective profile with reduced ACE and Ang II. There was no change in cardiac ACE2 activity or in cardiac Ang 1–7 levels with DIZE. In conclusion, our results suggest that DIZE exerts a protective effect on the heart under the pathological condition of kidney injury. This effect was not due to improved kidney function, a fall in blood pressure or a reduction in LVH but was associated with a reduction in cardiac ACE and cardiac Ang II levels. As in vitro studies showed no direct effect of DIZE on ACE2 or ACE activity, the precise mechanism of action of DIZE remains to be determined."

The underlying mechanisms of GC-promoted dysregulation of lipid metabolism, however, are not fully understood. GCs could facilitate the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in the liver of animals, and the potential role of MDSCs in GC-induced hepatic steatosis was therefore investigated in this study. We demonstrated that granulocytic (G)-MDSC accumulation mediated the effects of GCs on the fatty liver, in which activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3)/S100A9 signaling plays an important role. ATF3-deficient mice developed hepatic steatosis and displayed expansion of G-MDSCs in the liver and multiple immune organs, which shared high similarity with the phenotype observed in GC-treated wild-type littermates. Adoptive transfer of GC-induced or ATF3-deficient G-MDSCs promoted lipid accumulation in the liver, whereas depletion of G-MDSCs alleviated these effects. Mechanistic studies showed that in MDSCs, ATF3 was transrepressed by the GC receptor GR through direct binding to the negative GR-response element. S100A9 is the major transcriptional target of ATF3 in G-MDSCs. Silencing S100A9 clearly alleviated G-MDSCs expansion and hepatic steatosis caused by ATF3 deficiency or GC treatment.

We observed the formation of such aggregates during proliferation of Huh-7.5 cells, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, in a microfabricated low-adhesion microwell system (SpheroFilm; formed of mass-producible silicone elastomer) on the length scales up to 500 μm. The cell proliferation was also tracked with immunofluorescence staining of F-actin and cell proliferation marker Ki-67. Meanwhile, our complementary 3D Monte Carlo simulations, taking cell diffusion and division, cell-cell and cell-scaffold adhesion, and gravity into account, illustrate the role of these factors in the formation of spheroids. Taken together, our experimental and simulation results provide an integrative view of the process of spheroid formation for Huh-7.5 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2516649413,"Purpose To examine the association of myopia with the visual field (VF) defects in open-angle glaucoma (OAG) using paired eyes to eliminate the effect of unknown confounding factors that are diverse among individuals. Methods One hundred eighteen eyes of 59 subjects with myopia (spherical equivalent [SE] ≥ -2 diopter [D] and axial length ≥ 24.0 mm) whose intra-ocular pressure between paired eyes was similar and the mean deviation (MD) of the Humphrey VF test differed by more than 6 dB were included. Refractive errors (SE, axial length) and parameters associated with the papillary and parapapillary myopic deformation (tilt ratio, torsion angle, and β-zone parapapillary atrophy [PPA] area without Bruch’s membrane) were measured in each eye. The paired eyes were divided into worse and better eyes according to the MD of the VF, and parameters were compared between them. Further, multiple linear regression analysis was performed to examine the correlation of the difference in various parameters with the MD difference between paired eyes. Results The SE of all eyes was -6.39 ± 2.15 D (mean ± standard deviation) and axial length was 26.42 ± 1.07 mm. MD of the worse and better VF eyes were -13.56 ± 6.65 dB and -4.87 ± 5.32 dB, respectively. Eyes with worse VFs had significantly greater SE, axial length, tilt ratio, and PPA area without Bruch’s membrane than those with better VFs (all P < 0.05). In multiple linear regression analysis, the difference of the MD between paired eyes was significantly correlated with the difference in the tilt ratio and PPA area without Bruch’s membrane. Conclusion The myopic papillary and parapapillary deformations, but not refractive error itself, were related to the worse VF in paired eyes with OAG. This suggests that myopia influences the severity of the glaucomatous VF defects via structural deformation."
https://openalex.org/W2518556646,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are small in diameter, diffuse easily in the brain, and represent a highly efficient means by which to transfer a transgene to the brain of a large animal. A major demerit of AAV vectors is their limited accommodation capacity for transgenes. Thus, a compact promoter is useful when delivering large transgenes via AAV vectors. In the present study, we aimed to identify the shortest astrocyte-specific GFAP promoter region that could be used for AAV-vector-mediated transgene expression in the marmoset brain. The 2.0-kb promoter region upstream of the GFAP gene was cloned from the marmoset genome, and short promoters (1.6 kb, 1.4 kb, 0.6 kb, 0.3 kb and 0.2 kb) were obtained by progressively deleting the original 2.0-kb promoter from the 5' end. The short promoters were screened in the mouse cerebellum in terms of their strength and astrocyte specificity. We found that the 0.3-kb promoter maintained 40% of the strength of the original 2.0-kb promoter, and approximately 90% of its astrocyte specificity. These properties were superior to those of the 1.4-kb, 0.6-kb (20% promoter strength) and 0.2-kb (70% astrocyte specificity) promoters. Then, we verified whether the 0.3-kb GFAP promoter retained astrocyte specificity in the marmoset cerebral cortex. Injection of viral vectors carrying the 0.3-kb marmoset GFAP promoter specifically transduced astrocytes in both the cerebral cortex and cerebellar cortex of the marmoset. These results suggest that the compact 0.3-kb promoter region serves as an astrocyte-specific promoter in the marmoset brain, which permits us to express a large gene by AAV vectors that have a limited accommodation capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2509637311,"Animal studies suggest a role of vitamin D in fetal lung development although not studied in preterm animals. We tested the hypothesis that vitamin D depletion aggravates respiratory insufficiency in preterm rat offspring. Furthermore, the effects of vitamin D depletion on growth and lung surfactant were investigated. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned low vitamin D (VDL) or control diet before mating and followed with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (s-25(OH)D) determinations. After cesarean section at gestational day 19 (E19) or day 22 (E22), placental weight, birth weight, crown-rump-length (CRL), oxygenation (SaO2) at 30 min and survival time were recorded. The pup lungs were analyzed for phospholipid levels, surfactant protein A-D mRNA and the expression of the vitamin D receptor (VDR). S-25(OH)D was significantly lower in the VDL group at cesarean section (12 vs. 30nmol/L, p<0.0001). Compared to the controls, E19 VDL pups had lower birth weight (2.13 vs. 2.29g, p<0.001), lung weight (0.09 vs. 0.10g, p = 0.002), SaO2 (54% vs. 69%, p = 0.002) as well as reduced survival time (0.50 vs. 1.25h, p<0.0001). At E22, the VDL-induced pulmonary differences were leveled out, but VDL pups had lower CRL (4.0 vs. 4.5cm, p<0.0001). The phospholipid levels and the surfactant protein mRNA expression did not differ between the dietary groups. In conclusion, Vitamin D depletion led to lower oxygenation and reduced survival time in the preterm offspring, associated with reduced lung weight and birth weight. Further studies of vitamin D depletion in respiratory insufficiency in preterm neonates are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2515057041,"Trehalose serves as a key structural component in the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. M. tuberculosis trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (MtbTPP), an essential enzyme in the trehalose biosynthesis OtsAB pathway, catalyzes the dephosphorylation of trehalose-6-phosphate (trehalose-6-P) to generate trehalose, and plays a critical role in M. tuberculosis survival-associated cell wall formation and permeability. Therefore, MtbTPP (OtsB2) is considered a promising potential target for discovery of antimicrobial drugs. However, the absence of structural information of MtbTPP restrains our understanding of its underlying catalytic mechanism. Here, we report the high-resolution crystal structures of apo active MtbTPP and its trehalose-6-P bound complex. The apo structure presents a canonical haloacid dehalogenase superfamily structural fold plus an extra N-terminal domain. The catalytic center is located in a positively charged cleft between the hydrolase domain and the cap domain, demonstrating a highly conserved substrate binding pocket. The role of residues interacting with the substrate in catalysis were probed by site-directed mutagenesis. Asp147, Asp149, Asp330, and Asp331 were found to be pivotal for the enzymatic activity of MtbTPP. The MtbTPP structures reported here provide insight into a key step in the biosynthesis of trehalose, which would facilitate future development of anti-TB therapeutics.-Shan, S., Min, H., Liu, T., Jiang, D., Rao, Z.

https://openalex.org/W2517778167,"Inflammation and oxidative stress are considered the main drivers of vasomotor dysfunction and progression of atherosclerosis after inhalation of particulate matter. In addition, new studies have shown that particle exposure can induce the level of bioactive mediators in serum, driving vascular- and systemic toxicity. We aimed to investigate if pulmonary inflammation would accelerate nanoparticle-induced atherosclerotic plaque progression in Apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE-/-) mice. ApoE -/- mice were exposed to vehicle, 8.53 or 25.6 μg nanosized carbon black (CB) alone or spiked with LPS (0.2 μg/mouse/exposure; once a week for 10 weeks). Inflammation was determined by counting cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Serum Amyloid A3 (Saa3) expression and glutathione status were determined in lung tissue. Plaque progression was assessed in the aorta and the brachiocephalic artery. The effect of vasoactive mediators in plasma of exposed ApoE-/- mice was assessed in aorta rings isolated from naïve C57BL/6 mice. Pulmonary exposure to CB and/or LPS resulted in pulmonary inflammation with a robust influx of neutrophils. The CB exposure did not promote plaque progression in aorta or BCA. Incubation with 0.5% plasma extracted from CB-exposed ApoE-/- mice caused vasoconstriction in aorta rings isolated from naïve mice; this effect was abolished by the treatment with the serotonin receptor antagonist Ketanserin. In conclusion, repeated pulmonary exposure to nanosized CB and LPS caused lung inflammation without progression of atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice. Nevertheless, plasma extracted from mice exposed to nanosized CB induced vasoconstriction in aortas of naïve wild-type mice, an effect possibly related to increased plasma serotonin."
https://openalex.org/W2507937021,"Many daily life activities demand precise integration of spatial and temporal information of sensory inputs followed by appropriate motor actions. This type of integration is carried out in part by the cerebellum, which has been postulated to play a central role in learning and timing of movements. Cerebellar damage due to atrophy or lesions may compromise forward-model processing, in which both spatial and temporal cues are used to achieve prediction for future motor states. In the present study we sought to further investigate the cerebellar contribution to predictive and reactive motor timing, as well as to learning of sequential order and temporal intervals in these tasks. We tested patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) and healthy controls for two related motor tasks; one requiring spatio-temporal prediction of dynamic visual stimuli and another one requiring reactive timing only. We found that healthy controls established spatio-temporal prediction in their responses with high temporal precision, which was absent in the cerebellar patients. SCA6 patients showed lower predictive motor timing, coinciding with a reduced number of correct responses during the 'anticipatory' period on the task. Moreover, on the task utilizing reactive motor timing functions, control participants showed both sequence order and temporal interval learning, whereas patients only showed sequence order learning. These results suggest that SCA6 affects predictive motor timing and temporal interval learning. Our results support and highlight cerebellar contribution to timing and argue for cerebellar engagement during spatio-temporal prediction of upcoming events."
https://openalex.org/W2514063612,"Facial asymmetry often persists even after mandibular deviation corrected by the bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy (BSSRO) operation, since the reference facial sagittal plane for the asymmetry analysis is usually set up before the mandibular menton (Me) point correction. Our aim is to develop a predictive and quantitative method to assess the true asymmetry of the mandible after a midline correction performed by a virtual BSSRO, and to verify its availability by evaluation of the post-surgical improvement.A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Hospital of Stomatology, Sun Yat-sen University (China) of patients with pure hemi-mandibular elongation (HE) from September 2010 through May 2014. Mandibular models were reconstructed from CBCT images of patients with pre-surgical orthodontic treatment. After mandibular de-rotation and midline alignment with virtual BSSRO, the elongation hemi-mandible was virtually mirrored along the facial sagittal plane. The residual asymmetry, defined as the superimposition and boolean operation of the mirrored elongation side on the normal side, was calculated, including the volumetric differences and the length of transversal and vertical asymmetry discrepancy. For more specific evaluation, both sides of the hemi-mandible were divided into the symphysis and parasymphysis (SP), mandibular body (MB), and mandibular angle (MA) regions. Other clinical variables include deviation of Me point, dental midline and molar relationship. The measurement of volumetric discrepancy between the two sides of post-surgical hemi-mandible were also calculated to verify the availability of virtual surgery. Paired t-tests were computed and the P value was set at .05.This study included 45 patients. The volume differences were 407.8±64.8 mm3, 2139.1±72.5 mm3, and 422.5±36.9 mm3; residual average transversal discrepancy, 1.9 mm, 1.0 mm, and 2.2 mm; average vertical discrepancy, 1.1 mm, 2.2 mm, and 2.2 mm (before virtual surgery). The post-surgical volumetric measurement showed no statistical differences between bilateral mandibular regions.Mandibular asymmetry persists after Me point correction. A 3D quantification of mandibular residual asymmetry after Me point correction and mandible de-rotation with virtual BSSRO sets up a true reference mirror plane for comprehensive asymmetry assessment of bilateral mandibular structure, thereby providing an accurate guidance for orthognathic surgical planning."
https://openalex.org/W2518349775,"Despite the large number of tsunamis that impact Mexico’s Pacific coast, stratigraphic studies focusing on geological impacts are scanty, making it difficult to assess the long-term risks for this vulnerable region. Surface samples and six cores were taken from Laguna Mitla near Acapulco to examine sedimentological and geochemical evidence for marine incursion events. Sediment cores collected from behind the beach barrier are dominated by intercalated layers of peat and inorganic sediments, mostly silt and clay, with little or no sand. Sand- and shell-rich clastic layers with high levels of sulfur, calcium, and strontium only occur adjacent to the relict beach ridge remnants near the center of the lagoon. With the exception of one thin fine sand layer, the absence of sand in the near-shore cores and the predominance of the terrigenous element titanium in the inorganic layers, evidently eroded from the surrounding hillslopes, suggests that these large-grained intervals do not represent episodic marine incursions, but rather were likely formed by the erosion and redeposition of older marine deposits derived from the beach ridge remnants when water levels were high. These results do not support the occurrence of a large tsunami event at Laguna Mitla during the Late Holocene."
https://openalex.org/W2507605318,"Aims This prospective, repeated measures study utilized a convergent parallel mixed methods approach to assess sleep experiences among individuals who were alcohol-dependent undergoing inpatient detoxification and treatment at a clinical research facility across the transition periods associated with the rehabilitation process: the initial adjustment to becoming an inpatient and the transition from inpatient to outpatient status. Methods This study included individual semi-structured interviews and quantitative measures relating to psychological distress, sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and sleep-related beliefs and behavior (n = 33; 66.7% male). Interviews were conducted and questionnaires were administered within one week of participants’ scheduled discharge date and again four to six weeks post-discharge when they returned for a follow-up visit (or via phone). Results Participants self-reported significant sleep disturbances at both study time points. Of those participants with valid data at both time points (n = 28), there were no significant changes in mean scores from pre- to post-discharge with the exception of self-efficacy for sleep (SE-S) being significantly higher post-discharge. Preliminary qualitative findings suggested differences between those with ongoing sleep disturbances, those whose sleep disturbances had resolved, and those with no sleep disturbances at either time point. Conclusions This analysis highlights individual variation in sleep throughout the process of inpatient treatment and transition to outpatient aftercare in individuals with alcohol dependence. Collecting quantitative and qualitative data concurrently and combining emerging themes from qualitative data with quantitative analyses allowed for a more thorough examination of this relatively novel area of research and provided information that can be utilized to inform future behavioral sleep interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2507676788,"Visual environments may simultaneously comprise stimuli of different significance. Often such stimuli require incompatible responses. Selective visual attention allows an animal to respond exclusively to the stimuli at a certain location in the visual field. In the process of establishing its focus of attention the animal can be influenced by external cues. Here we characterize the behavioral properties and neural mechanism of cueing in the fly Drosophila melanogaster. A cue can be attractive, repulsive or ineffective depending upon (e.g.) its visual properties and location in the visual field. Dopamine signaling in the brain is required to maintain the effect of cueing once the cue has disappeared. Raising or lowering dopamine at the synapse abolishes this after-effect. Specifically, dopamine is necessary and sufficient in the αβ-lobes of the mushroom bodies. Evidence is provided for an involvement of the αβposterior Kenyon cells."
https://openalex.org/W2510942012,"The Bacille Calmette Guérin (BCG) vaccine is the only routine vaccination at birth that effectively induces neonatal T-helper 1 (Th1)-polarized immune responses. The primary cytokine that drives CD4+ T-cell Th1 differentiation is interleukin (IL)-12 p70, a heterodimeric cytokine composed of the IL-12 p35 and IL-12 p40 subunits. We therefore examined the mechanisms involved in BCG vaccine stimulation of IL-12 p35 and p40 production from human umbilical cord (neonatal) cells. We found that BCG bacilli did not upregulate IL-12 p35 mRNA production, but upregulated IL-12 p40 mRNA production in a Toll-like receptor (TLR)2-dependent manner, in human neonatal monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mdDCs). The combination of TLR2 signaling, Type I interferon (IFN), and Type II IFN induced maximal levels of IL-12 p35 and p40 mRNA production in human neonatal mdDCs. The cell-free supernatants of reconstituted BCG vaccine vials contained extracellular mycobacterial (BCG) DNA which could induce IFN-α (Type I IFN) production in human neonatal plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). BCG bacilli also stimulated human neonatal CD16lo natural killer (NK) cells to produce IFN-γ (Type II IFN) in a TLR2-dependent manner. We have therefore proposed a model where BCG vaccine could stimulate the combination of neonatal conventional DCs (cDCs), pDCs, and CD16lo NK cells to produce optimal neonatal IL-12 p35 and p40 (IL-12 p70) production and subsequent CD4+ T-cell Th1 polarization. An adjuvant that emulates the mechanism by which the BCG vaccine stimulates neonatal IL-12 p35 and p40 production could improve vaccine strategies at birth for protection against intracellular pathogens and toxins."
https://openalex.org/W2514150506,"Introduction Telomere length, a marker of cell aging, seems to be affected by the same factors thought to be associated with breast cancer prognosis. Objective To examine associations of peripheral blood cell-measured telomere length with traditional and potential prognostic factors in breast cancer patients. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data collected before surgery from 162 breast cancer patients recruited consecutively between 01/2011 and 05/2012, at a breast cancer reference center. Data on the main lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity) were collected using standardized questionnaires. Anthropometric factors were measured. Tumor biological characteristics were extracted from pathology reports. Telomere length was measured using a highly reproducible quantitative PCR method in peripheral white blood cells. Spearman partial rank-order correlations and multivariate general linear models were used to evaluate relationships between telomere length and prognostic factors. Results Telomere length was positively associated with total physical activity (rs = 0.17, P = 0.033; Ptrend = 0.069), occupational physical activity (rs = 0.15, P = 0.054; Ptrend = 0.054) and transportation-related physical activity (rs = 0.19, P = 0.019; P = 0.005). Among post-menopausal women, telomere length remained positively associated with total physical activity (rs = 0.27, P = 0.016; Ptrend = 0.054) and occupational physical activity (rs = 0.26, P = 0.021; Ptrend = 0.056) and was only associated with transportation-related physical activity among pre-menopausal women (rs = 0.27, P = 0.015; P = 0.004). No association was observed between telomere length and recreational or household activities, other lifestyle factors or traditional prognostic factors. Conclusions Telomeres are longer in more active breast cancer patients. Since white blood cells are involved in anticancer immune responses, these findings suggest that even regular low-intensity physical activity, such as that related to transportation or occupation, could be recommended to breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2510533855,"Although correlation network studies from co-expression analysis are increasingly popular, they are rarely applied to proteomics datasets. Protein co-expression analysis provides a complementary view of underlying trends, which can be overlooked by conventional data analysis. The core of the present study is based on Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis applied to a glioblastoma multiforme proteomic dataset. Using this method, we have identified three main modules which are associated with three different membrane associated groups; mitochondrial, endoplasmic reticulum, and a vesicle fraction. The three networks based on protein co-expression were assessed against a publicly available database (STRING) and show a statistically significant overlap. Each of the three main modules were de-clustered into smaller networks using different strategies based on the identification of highly connected networks, hierarchical clustering and enrichment of Gene Ontology functional terms. Most of the highly connected proteins found in the endoplasmic reticulum module were associated with redox activity while a core of the unfolded protein response was identified in addition to proteins involved in oxidative stress pathways. The proteins composing the electron transfer chain were found differently affected with proteins from mitochondrial Complex I being more down-regulated than proteins from Complex III. Finally, the two pyruvate kinases isoforms show major differences in their co-expressed protein networks suggesting roles in different cellular locations."
https://openalex.org/W2509905050,"We investigated the intersection of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)-β signaling in glioblastoma (GBM), given that both gene products strongly influence neoplastic behavior. C/EBP-β is known to drive the mesenchymal transcriptional signature in GBM, likely through strong microenvironmental influences, whereas the genetic contributions to its up-regulation in this disease are not well described. We demonstrated that stable overexpression and activation of WT EGFR (U87MG-WT) led to elevated C/EBP-β expression, as well as enhanced nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity, leading to up-regulation of C/EBP-β transcription and translation. Deeper investigation identified bidirectional regulation, with C/EBP-β also causing up-regulation of EGFR that was at least partially dependent on the STAT3. Based on ChIP-based studies, we also found that that the translational isoforms of C/EBP-β [liver-enriched transcription-activating protein (LAP)-1/2 and liver inhibitory protein (LIP)] have differential occupancy on STAT3 promoter and opposing roles in transcriptional regulation of STAT3 and EGFR. We further demonstrated that the shorter C/EBP-β isoform, LIP, promoted proliferation and migration of U87MG glioma cells, potentially via induction of cytokine IL-6. Our molecular dissection of EGFR and C/EBP-β pathway interactions uncovered a complex signaling network in which increased activity of either EGFR or C/EBP-β leads to the up-regulation of the other, enhancing oncogenic signaling. Disrupting the EGFR-C/EBP-β signaling axis could attenuate malignant behavior of glioblastoma.-Selagea, L., Mishra, A., Anand, M., Ross, J., Tucker-Burden, C., Kong, J., Brat, D. J.

This new, efficient methodology converts the general clustering problem into the community detection problem in graph by using the Jensen-Shannon distance, a dissimilarity measure originating in Information Theory. Moreover, we use graph theoretic concepts for the generation and analysis of proximity graphs. Our methodology is based on a newly proposed memetic algorithm (iMA-Net) for discovering clusters of data elements by maximizing the modularity function in proximity graphs of literary works. To test the effectiveness of this general methodology, we apply it to a text corpus dataset, which contains frequencies of approximately 55,114 unique words across all 168 written in the Shakespearean era (16th and 17th centuries), to analyze and detect clusters of similar plays. Experimental results and comparison with state-of-the-art clustering methods demonstrate the remarkable performance of our new method for identifying high quality clusters which reflect the commonalities in the literary style of the plays."

Arsenite, as well as other agents, triggered relocalization also of hEndoV to cytoplasmic stress granules. As inosines in RNA are highly abundant, hEndoV activity is likely regulated in cells to avoid aberrant cleavage of inosine-containing transcripts. Indeed, we find that hEndoV cleavage is inhibited by normal intracellular ATP concentrations. The ATP stores inside a cell do not overlay stress granules and we suggest that hEndoV is redistributed to stress granules as a strategy to create a local environment low in ATP to permit hEndoV activity.

As inosines in RNA are highly abundant, hEndoV activity is likely regulated in cells to avoid aberrant cleavage of inosine-containing transcripts. Indeed, we find that hEndoV cleavage is inhibited by normal intracellular ATP concentrations. The ATP stores inside a cell do not overlay stress granules and we suggest that hEndoV is redistributed to stress granules as a strategy to create a local environment low in ATP to permit hEndoV activity. Deamination of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) is a reaction that occurs spontaneously in cells and is enhanced by exposure to nitrosative agents formed as a response to inflammation, infection, or from the environment (1Lindahl T.

Consequences of adenosine deamination in RNA depend on which type and part of a transcript is deaminated and may result in altered coding, splicing, stability, and structure of an RNA or in intracellular relocalization (5Alseth I. Dalhus B. Bjørås M. Inosine in DNA and RNA.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2014; 26: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition to arbitrary deamination events, inosine is also introduced in RNA by specific enzymes in a highly regulated manner to increase transcriptomic diversity (6Mannion N. Arieti F. Gallo A.

Responsible enzymes are the adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) 2The abbreviations used are: ADAR, adenosine deaminases acting on RNA; ncRNA, non-coding RNA; EndoV, endonuclease V; PABPC1, polyadenylate-binding protein C1; qRT, quantitative real-time; co-IP, co-immunoprecipitation. that catalyze A to I editing on mRNA and non-coding (nc)RNA including long ncRNA, micro (mi)RNA and small interfering (si)RNA.

Also some tRNAs undergo A to I editing at the anticodon wobble adenosine A34, a reaction that is catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on tRNA (ADATs) (12Wolf J. Gerber A.P.

ADATs are homologs to the ADARs and their editing is essential for protein synthesis (12Wolf J. Gerber A.P.

The reaction catalyzed by EndoV is cleavage of the second phosphodiester bond 3′ to inosine in an Mg2+-dependent manner (15Yao M. Hatahet Z. Melamede R.J. Kow Y.W.

Cleavage of RNA was catalyzed with similar efficiencies for E. coli (Ec) EndoV and hEndoV, and kinetics were comparable with EcEndoV on DNA, suggesting that RNA is the preferred substrate for hEndoV (16Morita Y. Shibutani T. Nakanishi N. Nishikura K. Iwai S. Kuraoka I. Human endonuclease V is a ribonuclease specific for inosine-containing RNA.Nat.

Commun. 2013; 4: 2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Consistent with a substrate preference for RNA, cellular distribution of hEndoV is mainly cytoplasmic (19Fladeby C. Vik E.S. Laerdahl J.K. Gran Neurauter C. Heggelund J.E. Thorgaard E. Strøm-Andersen P. Bjørås M. Dalhus B. Alseth I. The human homolog of Escherichia coli endonuclease V is a nucleolar protein with affinity for branched DNA structures.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e47466Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A robust in vitro activity for recombinant hEndoV has been demonstrated, however, the function of hEndoV at the cellular level is not yet known. To get insight into hEndoV biology, we have performed biochemical analyses of endogenous and ectopically expressed hEndoV and find the same inosine-RNA specificity. Moreover, we find that hEndoV interacts with polyadenylate-binding protein C1 (PABPC1) in vitro and that both proteins relocate to cytoplasmic stress granules in cultured human cells upon exposure to various toxic agents. We suggest that this is a mechanism for the cell to regulate hEndoV activity. Human EndoV has been identified as a ribonuclease with specificity for inosine-containing RNA (16Morita Y. Shibutani T. Nakanishi N. Nishikura K. Iwai S. Kuraoka I. Human endonuclease V is a ribonuclease specific for inosine-containing RNA.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17Vik E.S. Nawaz M.S. Strøm Andersen P. Fladeby C. Bjørås M. Dalhus B. Alseth I. Endonuclease V cleaves at inosines in RNA.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As this result was obtained with recombinant enzyme purified from E. coli, we tested whether hEndoV showed the same catalytic activity when expressed in human cells. Stably transfected T-REx 293 cell lines with ectopic expression of FLAG-hEndoV and the catalytic inactive site-specific mutant D52A (17Vik E.S. Nawaz M.S. Strøm Andersen P. Fladeby C. Bjørås M. Dalhus B. Alseth I. Endonuclease V cleaves at inosines in RNA.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) were established. Cell-free cytoplasmic extracts (S100) were made and Western blot analyses revealed similar levels of expression for the two FLAG-hEndoV variants (data not shown). To test for activity, an RNA oligonucleotide (IIUI) corresponding to part of the α-tropomyosin mRNA known to be highly deaminated by ADARs (20Scadden A.D. Smith C.W. Specific cleavage of hyper-edited dsRNAs.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4243-4252Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) was used as substrate. In FLAG-hEndoVwt extracts, a robust cleavage was observed both with the single- and double-stranded IIUI substrates (Fig. 1A, upper and middle panels) demonstrating that hEndoV is active at inosines in RNA also when expressed in human cells. RNA without inosine was not cleaved by these extracts (Fig. 1A, lower panel). As expected, the FLAG-hEndoV(D52A) mutant was inactive toward the IIUI RNA substrates (Fig. 1A). Inosine cleavage was not seen in extract from non-transfected T-REx 293 cells, indicating that endogenous hEndoV activity is absent or below the detection limit (Fig. 1A). Use of higher amounts of extracts gave only unspecific degradation of the substrates (data not shown). To assess hEndoV binding to substrate, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed. The EMSAs revealed weak shifts with the FLAG-hEndoVwt extracts with the single-stranded IIUI substrate (Fig. 1B, upper left panel). For the FLAG-hEndoV(D52A) extract, strong bands were detected demonstrating that the inactive D52A mutant makes more stable contacts with the inosine-RNA substrate than hEndoVwt. No binding of endogenous hEndoV (T-REx) was detected in EMSAs using the ssIIUI substrate (Fig. 1B, upper left panel). With the double-stranded IIUI substrate, shifts were only seen with the FLAG-hEndoV(D52A) extract (Fig. 1B, upper right panel). Fractions of the EMSA reaction mixtures were run on denaturing gels to test for cleavage. No cleavage was detected even for recombinant hEndoV (Fig. 1B, middle panels), demonstrating that the EMSA condition does not allow for hEndoV activity. Using control RNA substrates without inosine (ss/dsCtr), no specific bands corresponding to hEndoV were seen, however, some unspecific shifts of lower mobility were visible in all three extracts at comparable levels, demonstrating the similarity of the extracts (Fig. 1B, lower panels). To identify potential activity of endogenous hEndoV (without overexpression), a larger amount of T-REx 293 cells were cultivated and a cytoplasmic (S100) protein extract prepared. The extract was run through a Superdex 75 column followed by ResQ and ResS chromatography (Fig. 2A). A corresponding extract from cells overexpressing FLAG-hEndoVwt was run in parallel and used for identifications of fractions rich in hEndoV as we assumed that FLAG-hEndoV and endogenous hEndoV have similar chromatographic properties. After ResS purification, the FLAG-hEndoV peak was identified and the corresponding fractions for the T-REx extract were tested. Cleavage products of similar size as those generated by FLAG-hEndoV and recombinant hEndoV were found in ResS fractions 10–14 when using the single-stranded IIUI substrate, demonstrating the endogenous hEndoV also has affinity for inosines in RNA (Fig. 2B). To verify that cleavage in Fig. 2B is executed by hEndoV, immunoprecipitations with a commercially available antibody as well as a monoclonal antibody raised against hEndoV were performed on peak fractions (Fig. 2, A and B). The precipitated materials were subjected to Western blot analysis and probing with a polyclonal hEndoV antibody identified endogenous hEndoV in the fractions (Fig. 2C). Recombinant hEndoV migrates slightly faster than the endogenous protein, which could be due to post-translational modifications not present in the recombinant version or alternatively that human cells express a different isoform. Human ENDOV mRNA is known to exist in numerous splice variants (19Fladeby C. Vik E.S. Laerdahl J.K. Gran Neurauter C. Heggelund J.E. Thorgaard E. Strøm-Andersen P. Bjørås M. Dalhus B. Alseth I. The human homolog of Escherichia coli endonuclease V is a nucleolar protein with affinity for branched DNA structures.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e47466Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As the IIUI substrates contain multiple inosines, several cleavage sites for hEndoV could exist. To obtain higher resolution, a sequencing gel was run where the single- and double-stranded IIUI substrates were run adjacent to RNA markers of known sizes. The gel revealed that for both endogenous and recombinant hEndoV, the preferred cleavage position was 3′ to the middle insoine (I10) with some nicking also next to the furthermost 5′ inosine (I9) especially for the double-stranded substrate (Fig. 2D). It appears that expression both in human and E. coli cells give active and comparable hEndoV enzymes suggesting that there are no extensive post-translational modifications of hEndoV that are critical for enzymatic activity. Initially EndoV homologs were characterized as DNA repair enzymes, however, recombinant hEndoV apparently does not share this property (16Morita Y. Shibutani T. Nakanishi N. Nishikura K. Iwai S. Kuraoka I. Human endonuclease V is a ribonuclease specific for inosine-containing RNA.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17Vik E.S. Nawaz M.S. Strøm Andersen P. Fladeby C. Bjørås M. Dalhus B. Alseth I. Endonuclease V cleaves at inosines in RNA.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We tested whether this was true also for hEndoV expressed in human cells. Activity assays revealed no cleavage of DNA with inosine, neither after overexpression nor with endogenously expressed hEndoV (data not shown). Our data demonstrate that endogenous hEndoV is an inosine-specific ribonuclease that is expressed at a low level at least in the cell line used originating from kidney epithelium. However, expression levels of hENDOV mRNA do vary among different tissues as previously demonstrated by transcript profiling (19Fladeby C. Vik E.S. Laerdahl J.K. Gran Neurauter C. Heggelund J.E. Thorgaard E. Strøm-Andersen P. Bjørås M. Dalhus B. Alseth I. The human homolog of Escherichia coli endonuclease V is a nucleolar protein with affinity for branched DNA structures.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e47466Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). That work demonstrated expression of hENDOV in 12 different tissues where cervix, colon, and adrenal gland had low/no expression. Highest hENDOV transcript levels were found in pancreas and testis possibly suggesting a vital function for hEndoV in these organs. We compared the amount of hENDOV mRNA in three different cell lines: T-REx 293 (kidney), HeLa (cervix), and HAP1 (myeloid) by qRT-PCR. The levels of hENDOV mRNA were normalized to GAPDH and tested for quality control by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3). We found that both HeLa and HAP1 cells had significantly less hENDOV mRNA than T-REx 293 cells (about 50 and 20% of the levels of T-Rex, respectively; Fig. 3). Exposure of the cells to arsenite or nitrite did not significantly change the amount of hENDOV transcripts in either of the cell lines (Fig. 3). It appears that hENDOV mRNA levels vary between various cell lines and tissues, but the steady-state levels of the hENDOV mRNA are not altered in response to stress. To learn more about the cellular function of hEndoV, we searched for protein partners interacting with hEndoV by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments coupled to MS analysis. We used cytoplasmic extracts made from cells overexpressing the FLAG-hEndoV(D52A) mutant taking advantage of its more stable interaction with inosine-containing RNA (Fig. 1B). MS analysis of the immunoprecipitated material revealed various ribosomal proteins as well as proteins known to be involved in different aspects of RNA metabolism (Table 1). Among the hits, a protein that caught our interest was PABPC1, which is a protein that binds poly(A) tails of mRNAs and is involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism including regulation of mRNA translation and stability in the cytoplasm (21Mangus D.A. Evans M.C. Jacobson A. Poly(A)-binding proteins: multifunctional scaffolds for the post-transcriptional control of gene expression.Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 223Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). To verify the interaction, co-IP using anti-FLAG beads and the hEndoV(D52A) extract was repeated and the precipitated material subjected to Western blot analysis using an antibody against PABPC1. The co-IP confirmed the interaction between hEndoV(D52A) and PABPC1 (Fig. 4A, upper panel). Co-IP with an extract with overexpressed FLAG-hEndoVwt also precipitated PABPC1, showing that the protein-protein interaction is not a consequence of the amino acid change introduced in D52A (Fig. 4A). Given that both PABPC1 and hEndoV bind RNA, we next sought to determine whether the interaction was RNA dependent. Treatment of the extracts with RNase completely abolished co-IP of PABPC1 by both FLAG-hEndoVwt and D52A, demonstrating that the interaction relied on RNA (Fig. 4A, upper panel). For the T-REx 293 extracts, co-IP gave a weak band for PABPC1, indicating some unspecific binding of PABPC1 to the anti-FLAG beads. Also this signal was lost by RNase treatment (Fig. 4A, upper panel). Reprobing of the membrane with a hEndoV antibody confirmed that both FLAG-hEndoVwt and D52A were precipitated (Fig. 4A, lower panel).TABLE 125 top proteins identified by MS after co-IP with FLAG-hEndoV(D52A)T test p valueT test differenceProtein nameGene namePeptide counts (all)2.52E-053.70734Endonuclease VENDOV21;17;17;14;11;8;8;7;6;6;6;6;6;5;4;2;2;15.26E-063.00836X-box-binding protein 1XBP11;1;1;14.0E-062.98271Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1IGF2BP115;112.30E-052.30214Polyadenylate-binding protein 1; polyadenylate-binding protein 3PABPC1;PABPC322;21;21;21;11;11;7;6;6;6;5;5;5;4;4;4;4; 3;3;3;2;1;1;1;1;10.0006286372.10569Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3IGF2BP36;2;10.0001854071.90331Nuclease-sensitive element-binding protein 1YBX18;7;4;20.0002371131.77645Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2IGF2BP24;4;4;3;3;3;30.04304611.75115Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factorMANF1;10.006809581.74702Polyadenylate-binding protein 4PABPC416;16;16;16;12;7;4;3;3;2;2;2;20.02709081.65183La-related protein 1LARP19;8;6;3;3;2;1;1;1;1;1;10.0166851.59752Histone H3; histone H3.3C; histone H3.2; histone H3.1t; histone H3.3; histone H3.1H3F3B;H3F3A;H3F3C;HIST2H3A; HIST3H3;HIST1H3A2;2;2;2;2;2;2;2;2;20.0003843251.54604Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit β2-like 1GNB2L11;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;10.0001188161.5447Y-box-binding protein 3YBX37;6;6;20.01508471.5411Double-stranded RNA-binding protein Staufen homolog 1STAU17;7;7;6;2;15.38E-061.49226La-related protein 7LARP75;5;4;3;2;20.003182451.48783Protein mago nashi homolog;Protein mago nashi homolog 2MAGOHB;MAGOH1;1;1;1;10.003488731.48094Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6EIF62;10.0001759991.36854Uncharacterized protein C7orf50C7orf501;10.0005448391.34037Putative helicase MOV-10MOV104;4;20.0001663081.23335tRNA (cytosine(34)-C(5))-methyltransferaseNSUN214;12;8;60.005099541.231317SK snRNA methylphosphate capping enzymeMEPCE6;40.0004231261.2146Nuclear cap-binding protein subunit 1NCBP120.003788861.18884Protein BUD31 homologBUD313;2;1;10.001146631.17908FACT complex subunit SPT16SUPT16H50.01280861.14924Hepatoma-derived growth factor-related protein 3HDGFRP33;2 Open table in a new tab To test if there is a functional interaction between hEndoV and PABPC1, recombinant proteins were purified and activity assays performed. The single-stranded IIUI substrate was incubated with a fixed amount of hEndoV (0.2 nm) and increasing amounts of PABPC1 (0.6 to 3.6 nm). Addition of PABPC1 stimulated hEndoV activity and a 3-fold molar excess of PABPC1 increased cleavage from 17 to 22%. With further addition of PABPC1, more cleavage was seen and with 20-fold excess of PABPC1 (3.6 nm), 32% of the substrate was incised (Fig. 4, B and C). PABPC1 consists of four RNA-binding domains (RRM1–4) followed by a linker and a conserved C-terminal MLLE domain (21Mangus D.A. Evans M.C. Jacobson A. Poly(A)-binding proteins: multifunctional scaffolds for the post-transcriptional control of gene expression.Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 223Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 22Xie J. Kozlov G.

The RRM domains mediate circularization of mRNA required for protein translation, whereas the MLLE domain mediates binding to PABP-binding proteins. To identify specific regions involved in hEndoV interaction, the two domains RRM1–4 and MLLE were expressed separately in E. coli, purified, and tested in activity assays. The RRM1–4 protein stimulated hEndoV activity comparable with full-length PABPC1, whereas the MLLE domain had no effect (Fig. 4, B, upper panel, and C). As controls, pure GST and BSA were included where none had effect on hEndoV activity. The highest amount of protein partners alone (3.6 nm) did not result in any cleavage (Fig. 4B, upper panel). To study potential effects on substrate binding, EMSAs were performed. Also here PABPC1 had a positive effect on hEndoV evident as stronger binding to the RNA substrate. Without PABPC1, 70 nm hEndoV shifted 15% of the substrate, which increased to 45% with a 10-fold excess of PABPC1 (700 nm) (Fig. 4B, middle panel, and C). A small increase in hEndoV binding was observed by addition of RRM1–4 and MLLE (33 and 31%), but the effect was not as strong as seen for full-length PABPC1. GST in 10-fold excess only had a marginal effect. 700 nm of the protein partners alone did not give any visible band shifts using the IIUI substrate (Fig. 4B, middle panel). The EMSA conditions allowed only for substrate binding and not cleavage (Fig. 4B, lower panel). No supershift indicative of a complex with both hEndoV and PABPC1 was observed, suggesting that the contact between the two proteins is weak or transient. In fact, Western blot analysis of the bound material only identified hEndoV in the shifts and not PABPC1 (Fig. 4D). PABPC1 and hEndoV both have a cytoplasmic localization in cells (17Vik E.S.

Previous research has shown that upon cellular stress, PABC1 accumulates in cytoplasmic granules referred to as stress granules (24Kedersha N.L. Gupta M. Li W. Miller I. Anderson P. RNA-binding proteins TIA-1 and TIAR link the phosphorylation of eIF-2α to the assembly of mammalian stress granules.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). These granules contain a selection of RNAs and proteins and are multimolecular aggregates of stalled translational pre-initiation complexes. They are formed in response to certain stress factors to temporarily reduce translation of housekeeping genes and optimize translation of stress-response genes with the aim to increase cell survival (25Kedersha N.

We tested for redistribution of hEndoV and possible colocalization with PABPC1 in stress granules in human cells by the use of a T-REx 293 cell line stably transfected with GFP-hEndoVwt.

https://openalex.org/W2512839926,"Characterizing how people move through space has been an important component of many disciplines. With the advent of automated data collection through GPS and other location sensing systems, researchers have the opportunity to examine human mobility at spatio-temporal resolution heretofore impossible. However, the copious and complex data collected through these logging systems can be difficult for humans to fully exploit, leading many researchers to propose novel metrics for encapsulating movement patterns in succinct and useful ways. A particularly salient proposed metric is the mobility entropy rate of the string representing the sequence of locations visited by an individual. However, mobility entropy rate is not scale invariant: entropy rate calculations based on measurements of the same trajectory at varying spatial or temporal granularity do not yield the same value, limiting the utility of mobility entropy rate as a metric by confounding inter-experimental comparisons. In this paper, we derive a scaling relationship for mobility entropy rate of non-repeating straight line paths from the definition of Lempel-Ziv compression. We show that the resulting formulation predicts the scaling behavior of simulated mobility traces, and provides an upper bound on mobility entropy rate under certain assumptions. We further show that this formulation has a maximum value for a particular sampling rate, implying that optimal sampling rates for particular movement patterns exist."
https://openalex.org/W2513538560,"Leucocytozoon parasites infect many species of avian hosts, including domestic chicken, and can inflict heavy economic loss on the poultry industry. Two major species of Leucocytozoon parasites have been reported in China, L. sabrazesi and L. caulleryi, although L. sabrazesi appears to be more widespread than L. caulleryi in southern China. The traditional method for detecting Leucocytozoon infection is microscopic examination of blood smears for the presence of mature gametocytes in circulation, which may miss infections with low parasitemia (gametocytemia) or immature gametocytes. Here we developed a PCR-based method to monitor L. sabrazesi infections at seven sites in four provinces of China after testing two PCR primer pairs based on parasite mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) and cytochrome c oxidase III (coxIII) genes. We compared the results of PCR detection with those of microscopic observation. As expected, the PCR assays were more sensitive than microscope examination in detecting L. sabrazesi infection and were able to detect parasite DNA after gametocytes disappeared in the blood stream. Using these methods, we investigated monthly dynamics of L. sabrazesi in chickens from a free-range farm in Xiamen, Fujian province of China, over one year. Our results showed that chickens were infected with L. sabrazesi year-round in southern China. Finally, we tested several compounds for potential treatment of Leucocytozoon infections, including primaquine, ketotifen, clomipramine hydrochloride, desipramine hydrochloride, sulfaquinoxaline, and pyrimethamine. Only primaquine had activity against L. sabrazesi gametocytes. Our results provide important information for controlling parasite transmission in southern China and disease management."
https://openalex.org/W2507732467,"Computational modelling and simulation is increasingly being used to complement traditional wet-lab techniques when investigating the mechanistic behaviours of complex biological systems. In order to ensure computational models are fit for purpose, it is essential that the abstracted view of biology captured in the computational model, is clearly and unambiguously defined within a conceptual model of the biological domain (a domain model), that acts to accurately represent the biological system and to document the functional requirements for the resultant computational model. We present a domain model of the IL-1 stimulated NF-κB signalling pathway, which unambiguously defines the spatial, temporal and stochastic requirements for our future computational model. Through the development of this model, we observe that, in isolation, UML is not sufficient for the purpose of creating a domain model, and that a number of descriptive and multivariate statistical techniques provide complementary perspectives, in particular when modelling the heterogeneity of dynamics at the single-cell level. We believe this approach of using UML to define the structure and interactions within a complex system, along with statistics to define the stochastic and dynamic nature of complex systems, is crucial for ensuring that conceptual models of complex dynamical biosystems, which are developed using UML, are fit for purpose, and unambiguously define the functional requirements for the resultant computational model."
https://openalex.org/W2508283366,"Privacy-aware search of outsourced data ensures relevant data access in the untrusted domain of a public cloud service provider. Subscriber of a public cloud storage service can determine the presence or absence of a particular keyword by submitting search query in the form of a trapdoor. However, these trapdoor-based search queries are limited in functionality and cannot be used to identify secure outsourced data which contains semantically equivalent information. In addition, trapdoor-based methodologies are confined to pre-defined trapdoors and prevent subscribers from searching outsourced data with arbitrarily defined search criteria. To solve the problem of relevant data access, we have proposed an index-based privacy-aware search methodology that ensures semantic retrieval of data from an untrusted domain. This method ensures oblivious execution of a search query and leverages authorized subscribers to model conjunctive search queries without relying on predefined trapdoors. A security analysis of our proposed methodology shows that, in a conspired attack, unauthorized subscribers and untrusted cloud service providers cannot deduce any information that can lead to the potential loss of data privacy. A computational time analysis on commodity hardware demonstrates that our proposed methodology requires moderate computational resources to model a privacy-aware search query and for its oblivious evaluation on a cloud service provider."
https://openalex.org/W2208738455,"Traffic congestion is an important problem both on an individual and on a societal level and much research has been done to explain and prevent their emergence. There are currently many systems which provide a reasonably good picture of actual road traffic by employing either fixed measurement points on highways or so called ""floating car data"" i.e. by using velocity and location data from roaming, networked, GPS enabled members of traffic. Some of these systems also offer forecasting of road conditions based on such historical data. To my knowledge there is as yet no system which offers advance notice on road conditions based on a signal which is guaranteed to occur in advance of these conditions and this is the novelty of this paper. Google Search intensity for the German word stau (i.e. traffic jam) peaks 2 hours ahead of the number of traffic jam reports as reported by the ADAC, a well known German automobile club and the largest of its kind in Europe. This is true both in the morning (7 am to 9 am) and in the evening (4 pm to 6 pm). The main result of this paper is then that after controlling for time-of-day and day-of-week effects we can still explain a significant additional portion of the variation of the number of traffic jam reports with Google Trends and we can thus explain well over 80% of the variation of road conditions using Google search activity. A one percent increase in Google stau searches implies a .4 percent increase of traffic jams. Our paper is a proof of concept that aggregate, timely delivered behavioural data can help fine tune modern societies and prompts for more research with better, more disaggregated data in order to also achieve practical solutions."
https://openalex.org/W2513748314,"Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) capacitors (MOSCAP) have been instrumental in making CMOS nano-electronics realized for back-to-back technology nodes. High-k gate stacks including the desirable metal gate processing and its integration into CMOS technology remain an active research area projecting the solution to address the requirements of technology roadmaps. Screening, selection and deposition of high-k gate dielectrics, post-deposition thermal processing, choice of metal gate structure and its post-metal deposition annealing are important parameters to optimize the process and possibly address the energy efficiency of CMOS electronics at nano scales. Atomic layer deposition technique is used throughout this work because of its known deposition kinetics resulting in excellent electrical properties and conformal structure of the device. The dynamics of annealing greatly influence the electrical properties of the gate stack and consequently the reliability of the process as well as manufacturable device. Again, the choice of the annealing technique (migration of thermal flux into the layer), time-temperature cycle and sequence are key parameters influencing the device's output characteristics. This work presents a careful selection of annealing process parameters to provide sufficient thermal budget to Si MOSCAP with atomic layer deposited HfSiO high-k gate dielectric and TiN gate metal. The post-process annealing temperatures in the range of 600°C -1000°C with rapid dwell time provide a better trade-off between the desirable performance of Capacitance-Voltage hysteresis and the leakage current. The defect dynamics is thought to be responsible for the evolution of electrical characteristics in this Si MOSCAP structure specifically designed to tune the trade-off at low frequency for device application."
https://openalex.org/W2509491445,"Belowground tri-trophic study systems present a challenging environment in which to study plant-herbivore-natural enemy interactions. For this reason, belowground examples are rarely available for testing general ecological theories. To redress this imbalance, we present, for the first time, data on a belowground tri-trophic system to test the slow growth, high mortality hypothesis. We investigated whether the differing performance of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) in controlling the common pest black vine weevil Otiorhynchus sulcatus could be linked to differently resistant cultivars of the red raspberry Rubus idaeus. The O. sulcatus larvae recovered from R. idaeus plants showed significantly slower growth and higher mortality on the Glen Rosa cultivar, relative to the more commercially favored Glen Ample cultivar creating a convenient system for testing this hypothesis. Heterorhabditis megidis was found to be less effective at controlling O. sulcatus than Steinernema kraussei, but conformed to the hypothesis. However, S. kraussei maintained high levels of O. sulcatus mortality regardless of how larval growth was influenced by R. idaeus cultivar. We link this to direct effects that S. kraussei had on reducing O. sulcatus larval mass, indicating potential sub-lethal effects of S. kraussei, which the slow-growth, high-mortality hypothesis does not account for. Possible origins of these sub-lethal effects of EPN infection and how they may impact on a hypothesis designed and tested with aboveground predator and parasitoid systems are discussed."
