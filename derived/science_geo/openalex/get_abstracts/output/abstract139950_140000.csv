https://openalex.org/W1973238763,"The endogenous CYP2B6 gene becomes phenobarbital (PB) inducible in androstenol-treated HepG2 cells either transiently or stably transfected with a nuclear receptor CAR expression vector. The PB induction mediated by CAR is regulated by a conserved 51-base pair element called PB-responsive enhancer module (PBREM) that has now been located between −1733 and −1683 bp in the gene's 5′-flanking region. An in vitro translated CAR acting as a retinoid X receptor α heterodimer binds directly to the two nuclear receptor sites NR1 and NR2 within PBREM. In a stably transfected HepG2 cell line, both PBREM and NR1 are activated by PB and PB-type compounds such as chlorinated pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls and chlorpromazine. In addition to PBREM, CAR also transactivates the steroid/rifampicin-response element of the humanCYP3A4 gene in HepG2 cells. Thus, activation of the repressed nuclear receptor CAR appears to be a versatile mediator that regulates PB induction of the CYP2B and other genes.

Ironically it can often result in activation of xenochemicals to more toxic and/or carcinogenic products (1Conney A.H. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4875-4917PubMed Google Scholar). Inducible gene transcription by exposure to xenochemicals is characteristic for CYPs, which increases the organism's defense capability against toxicity and carcinogenicity. Since the discovery of PB induction 35 years ago (2Remmer H. Merker H. Science. 1963; 142: 1657-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), PB has served as a prototype for a large group of structurally and functionally diverse xenochemicals that induce CYP2B genes. A PB-responsive enhancer activity was first associated with a 177-bp DNA sequence (−2318/−2155 bp) of the rat CYP2B2 gene in primary hepatocytes (3Trottier E. Belzil A. Stoltz C. Anderson A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and was later confirmed using an in situ injection method (4Park Y. Li H. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23725-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the corresponding sequence was also found in the mouseCyp2b10 gene (5Honkakoski P. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14943-14949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The enhancer activity of the 177-bp sequence has now been delimited to a 51-bp element PBREM inCyp2b10 (6Honkakoski P. Moore R. Washburn K.A. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and similar DNA element in CYP2B2 (7Stoltz C. Vachon M.-H. Trottier E. Dubois S. Paquet Y. Anderson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8528-8535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,8Kim J. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29423-29425Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The nuclear orphan receptor heterodimer CAR-RXR has been identified as a transactivator of PBREM (9Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The nuclear orphan receptor CAR was originally characterized as a constitutive activator of an empirical set of retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) (10Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.-S. Martinoli M. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Consistently, CAR-mediated PBREM activity observed in HepG2 cells was PB-independent (9Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Thus, CAR remains to be established as a true signal mediating PB induction. Most recently, the CAR-mediated transactivation of RAREs has been reported to be repressed by 3α-androstenol and androstanol (11Forman B.M. Tzameli I. Choi H.-S. Chen J. Simha D. Seol W. Evans R.M. Moore D.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Considering the functional properties of CAR, we have examined whether CAR can activate the endogenous CYP2B gene and whether activation is PB-dependent in a stable HepG2 cell line transfected with a CAR expression vector. We have also located the PBREM sequence in the human CYP2B6 gene and demonstrated PB responsiveness of PBREM in HepG2 cells. TCPOBOP was synthesized using the method of Kendeet al. (12Kende A.S. Ebetino F.H. Drendel W.B. Sundaralingam M. Glover E. Poland A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 28: 445-453PubMed Google Scholar). 3α-Androstenol was obtained from Steraloids (Wilton, NH); o,p′-DDT, methoxychlor, and PCB were from AccuStandard (New Haven, CT). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. CAR-β cDNA was amplified as described in a previous report (9Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) and cloned into between the BamHI andXhoI site of pCR3 vector. In the case of the luciferase reporter plasmid, the 160-bp thymidine kinase (tk) promoter was amplified from pBLCAT2 plasmid and cloned into the BglII andHindIII sites of pGL3-Basic vector containing the firefly luciferase reporter gene (Promega). The complementary oligonucleotides of human and mouse PBREM and the triplicate human NR1 ((5′-gatcACTGTACTTTCCTGACCTTGgatc-3′)3) sequences were synthesized and were cloned in front of the tk promoter (BglII site), resulting in PBREM-tk-luciferase and (NR1)3-tk-luciferase reporter gene plasmids. The (ER6)3-tk-CAT reporter gene plasmid was constructed by insertion of (5′-GATCAATATGAACTCAAAGGAGGTCAGTG-3′)3 into the pBLCAT-2 basic vector (13Lehmann J.M. McKee D.D. Watson M.A. Willson T.M. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1016-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (9Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). A stable transfected HepG2 cell line (g2car-3) was transfected with a pCR3-mCAR expression vector and selected by neomycin resistance. The enhancer-containing plasmids (0.1 μg) were co-transfected with pRL-SV40 (0.2 μg) into g2car-3 cells (17-mm well) using calcium phosphate co-precipitation and incubated for 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured simultaneously using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Promoter activities were determined from three independent transfections and calculated from firefly luciferase activities normalized against Renilla luciferase activities of an internal control pRL-SV40 plasmid. For the CAT assays, a CYP3A4 (ER6)3-tk-CAT reporter gene plasmid (1.0 μg) was co-transfected with pCMVβgal (Promega) as an internal control. 3α-Androstenol (4 μm) was included in the culture medium, which produced maximal repression of theCYP2B6 gene in the CAR-transfected HepG2 cells (EC50 ≅ 1 μm). To measure CYP2B6 mRNA, total RNA was subsequently prepared from HepG2 and g2car-3 cells using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). One-twentieth of each cDNA synthesized from 2 μg of RNA was subjected to 37- and 29-cycle amplifications ofCYP2B6 mRNA from HepG2 and g2car-3 cells, respectively. The primers (5′-CACCCTAACACCCATGACCG-3′ and 5′-GATCACACCATATCCCCGGA-3′) were designed from the reported sequences (GenBankTM accession number J02864) across intron 1 of the CYP2B6 gene. PCR reactions were performed using Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) with TaqStart antibody (CLONTECH) at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 40 s. The amplified DNA (276 bp) was separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized with staining by ethidium bromide. β-Actin mRNA was amplified as an internal control. hCAR and RXRα were translated using TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The double-stranded oligonucleotides of the human NR1, NR2 (5′- gatcCATGGACTTTCCTGAACCAAgatc-3′), or ER6 were labeled using [32P]dCTP and DNA polymerase Klenow fragment. Gel-shift assays were performed as described previously (9Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). For competition, 200-fold excess of each cold probe was included in the incubation. The cosmid clone F17390 containing the humanCYP2B6 gene was generously provided by Dr. H. W. Mohrenweiser (14Hoffman S.M. Fernandez-Salguero P. Gonzalez F.J. Mohrenweiser H.W. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 41: 894-900PubMed Google Scholar). A 5 kbp of the 5′-flanking region was amplified by PCR using primers generated from exon 1 and the cosmid vector, digested to smaller fragments (0.5–1.0 kbp) by sonication, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and cloned into the SmaI site the pUC18 vector. Over 100 pUC18 clones were sequenced, and sequence data were assembled by Sequencher to complete the 1.8-kbp 5′-flanking region ofCYP2B6 gene. The GenBankTM accession number of this sequence is AF081569. The levels of CYP2B6 mRNA were measured in the transfected HepG2 cells to obtain more direct evidence that CAR can mediate PB induction of the CYP2B gene (Fig.1 A). First, HepG2 cells are transiently transfected with CAR-expressing plasmids and then treated with 3α-androstenol alone or both 3α-androstenol and TCPOBOP (the most potent PB-type inducer known). RT-PCR assay reveals that endogenous CYP2B6 mRNA is present in CAR-transient transfected HepG2 cells but not in nontransfected HepG2 cells. Androstenol treatment represses CYP2B6 mRNA in CAR-transfected HepG2 cells. Subsequently, TCPOBOP dramatically inducesCYP2B6 mRNA in 3α-androstenol-treated CAR-transfected HepG2 cells. These transient transfections showed that the endogenousCYP2B6 gene can be regulated by CAR and PB. We then constructed a stable HepG2 cell line (named g2car-3) transfected with a CAR-expressing plasmid in order to measure mRNA more consistently. First, stable expression of CAR resulted in a dramatic increase of CYP2B6 mRNA in the g2car-3 cells as indicated by intense bands after just 29 cycles (Fig. 1 B). However, 37 cycles of PCR does not amplify mRNA from HepG2 (left two lanes in Fig. 1 A). The expression levels of CYP2B6 mRNA in g2car-3 cells are roughly comparable with that of Cyp2b10 mRNA in PB-treated mouse livers. Using this stable cell line, dose-dependent induction was examined with PB and TCPOBOP. As expected,CYP2B6 mRNA is induced in a dose-dependent manner by the inducers in 3α-androstenol-treated g2car-3 cells (Fig.1 B). The results show unequivocally that CAR mediates induction of the endogenous CYP2B6 gene in response to PB and TCPOBOP. The mouse PBREM is a 51-bp DNA enhancer consisting of two nuclear receptor DR4 motifs (NR1 and NR2) flanking a NF1 binding site (6Honkakoski P. Moore R. Washburn K.A. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The corresponding 51-bp DNA is found in a −1.7-kbp region of the humanCYP2B6 gene, while its 5′ to 3′ orientation is opposite from the mouse and rat PBREM sequences (Fig.2). The 16-bp NR1 site of human PBREM differs by only 1 base from mouse NR1, making NR1 the most conserved sequence between human, mouse, and rat PBREM elements. The NR1 site, thus, may be the key element conferring enhancer activity to PBREM. Since the human NR2 is 87% sequence identical to NR1 and also binds toin vitro translated CAR-RXR heterodimer (Fig.3 A), the function of NR2 may be redundant. On the other hand, the least conserved NF1 site may not be critical for PB responsiveness in agreement with our previous findings (9Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous findings (9Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), neither PB or 3α-androstenol (10 μm) affected binding of in vitro translated CAR (data not shown). Moore et al.have also shown that androstenol and androstanol do not inhibit binding of CAR to RARE sequences, while they appear to dissociate SRC-1 from CAR (11Forman B.M. Tzameli I. Choi H.-S. Chen J. Simha D. Seol W. Evans R.M. Moore D.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Therefore, it remains to be investigated whether PB can recruit transcriptional co-activators to activate PBREM.Figure 3PB responsiveness of CAR-mediated transactivation in g2car-3 cells.

Luci, luciferase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We then examined whether CAR-mediated transactivation of PBREM is PB-inducible. For this, the PBREM-tk-luciferase reporter gene was transfected into 3α-androstenol-treated g2car-3 cells, which were then induced by TCPOBOP. CAR-mediated transactivation was enhanced by 5–10-fold in g2car-3 cells (Fig. 3 B). NR1 alone appears to be sufficient to confer PB responsiveness to CAR-mediated transactivation. Moreover, the (NR1)3-tk-luciferase reporter gene displays a high TCPOBOP responsiveness (Fig.3 B), suggesting that PB and TCPOBOP probably induce CAR-mediated transactivation by displacing 3α-androstenol. These transactivations by CAR are totally consistent with the induction of the endogenous CYP2B6 gene (Fig. 1). Thus, the nuclear receptor CAR can mediate PB-inducible transcription of theCYP2B6 gene through its binding to the NR1 site of PBREM. 3α-Androstenol is one of the 16-androstenes in human urine and is also present in circulation (15Gower D.B. Ruparelia B.A. J. Endocrinol. 1993; 137: 167-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The reported peripheral plasma concentration (nanomolar) of 3α-androstenol in men is substantially lower than the micromolar concentration required to repress CAR-mediated transactivation in HepG2 cells. Although 16-androstenes may accumulate to higher levels and/or steroids may repress CAR at substantially lower concentration in liver, how CAR is actually repressed in liver remains as a question of major interest. PBREM is a versatile enhancer that responds to a great number of PB-type inducers with very diverse structures (6Honkakoski P. Moore R. Washburn K.A. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Therefore, known PB-type inducers o,p′-DDT, methoxychlor, PCB, and chlorpromazine were selected to examine whether induction by these inducers is also CAR-mediated. All four xenochemicals are found to induce CYP2B6 mRNA in 3α-androstenol-treated g2car-3 cells (Fig. 4 A). The (NR1)3-tk-luciferase reporter activity is also increased by these PB-type inducers (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC), dexamethasone (DEX), and clofibrate, which are classical CYP1A, CYP3A, and CYP4A inducers, respectively, neither transactivate PBREM nor induce CYP2B6 mRNA (Fig. 4, Aand B). A slight increase by 3-MC of mRNA may not be mediated by CAR, since 3-MC did not activate PBREM. DEX actually represses both mRNA and PBREM activity. It is known that DEX treatment decreases CYP2B mRNA in rat hepatoma-derived Fao cells (16de Waziers I. Bouguet J. Beaune P.H. Gonzalez F.J. Ketterer B. Barouki R. Pharmacogenetics. 1992; 2: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), while DEX induces the Cyp2b gene in mouse primary hepatocytes (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which DEX represses PBREM remains to be investigated. CAR, nevertheless, displays a versatility to mediate transactivation by a number of known PB-type inducers and a specificity which corresponds only to that of PB-type inducers. PB is a pleiotropic agent that induces various drug-metabolizing enzymes, including the CYP3A gene (18Waxman D.J. Azaroff L. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 577-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 19Honkakoski P. Negishi M. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 1998; 12: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5, A and B,in vitro translated CAR-RXR heterodimer binds to the steroid/rifampicin-responsive ER6 element of human CYP3A4gene and mediates PB-inducible transactivation of the response element in the g2car-3 cells. Therefore, the pleiotropic PB actions can, in part, be explained by the ability of CAR-RXR heterodimer to bind to distinct nuclear receptor motifs. Alternatively, since ER6 is reported to be activated by PXR and PB (13Lehmann J.M. McKee D.D. Watson M.A. Willson T.M. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1016-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar), PB may activate multiple nuclear orphan receptors to induce various CYP genes. These effects of PB are concerted to increase hepatic metabolic capability. For example, proliferation of endoplasmic reticulum increases membranes into which CYP protein is inserted, while heme synthesis and glucose metabolism supply the prosthetic group protoheme and the reducing agent NADPH, respectively. Does CAR play a role in endoplasmic reticulum proliferation and/or regulate glucose metabolism? Whether CAR is responsible for these pleiotropic actions of PB remains a focus of future investigation. Nuclear orphan receptors have now emerged as major mediators of xenochemical-inducible transcription of CYP genes. In addition to CAR, pregnenolone X receptor, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α activate xenochemical-induced transcription of the CYP3A and CYP4A genes, respectively (20Kliewer S.A. Moore J.T. Wade L. Staudinger J.L. Watson M.A. Jones S.A. McKee D.D. Oliver B.B. Willson T.M. Zetterstrom R.H. Perlmann T. Lehmann J.M.

As a family of proteins with a low affinity to diverse ligands and with a binding flexibility to various DNA motifs, the nuclear receptors may collectively induce a large set of CYP and conjugation enzymes in response to myriads of xenochemicals. Induction, in turn, could result in increased metabolism of xenochemicals and endogenous substrates (e.g. steroids and lipids) to produce other potential ligands of nuclear receptors. For example, the pesticide methoxychlor is metabolized by CYP2B enzyme to estrogenic products (24Bulger W.H. Feil V.J. Kupfer D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 27: 115-124PubMed Google Scholar). As methoxychlor also activates CAR and CYP2B expression, CAR could be directly involved in increasing availability of ligands for estrogen receptors. A functional cross-talk between CYP and nuclear receptor superfamilies may have important consequences in the physiological and pathological responses to xenochemicals."
https://openalex.org/W2073264699,"This study was undertaken to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective actions of lithium against glutamate excitotoxicity with a focus on the role of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic genes. Long term, but not acute, treatment of cultured cerebellar granule cells with LiCl induces a concentration-dependent decrease in mRNA and protein levels of proapoptotic p53 and Bax; conversely, mRNA and protein levels of cytoprotective Bcl-2 are remarkably increased. The ratios of Bcl-2/Bax protein levels increase by approximately 5-fold after lithium treatment for 5–7 days. Exposure of cerebellar granule cells to glutamate induces a rapid increase in p53 and Bax mRNA and protein levels with no apparent effect on Bcl-2 expression. Pretreatment with LiCl for 7 days prevents glutamate-induced increase in p53 and Bax expression and maintains Bcl-2 in an elevated state. Glutamate exposure also triggers the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol. Lithium pretreatment blocks glutamate-induced cytochrome c release and cleavage of lamin B1, a nuclear substrate for caspase-3. These results strongly suggest that lithium-induced Bcl-2 up-regulation and p53 and Bax down-regulation play a prominent role in neuroprotection against excitotoxicity. Our results further suggest that lithium, in addition to its use in the treatment of bipolar depressive illness, may have an expanded use in the intervention of neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2030562643,"Chlamydia infections are epidemiologically linked to human heart disease. A peptide from the murine heart muscle–specific α myosin heavy chain that has sequence homology to the 60-kilodalton cysteine-rich outer membrane proteins of Chlamydia pneumoniae , C. psittaci , and C. trachomatis was shown to induce autoimmune inflammatory heart disease in mice. Injection of the homologous Chlamydia peptides into mice also induced perivascular inflammation, fibrotic changes, and blood vessel occlusion in the heart, as well as triggering T and B cell reactivity to the homologous endogenous heart muscle–specific peptide. Chlamydia DNA functioned as an adjuvant in the triggering of peptide-induced inflammatory heart disease. Infection with C. trachomatis led to the production of autoantibodies to heart muscle–specific epitopes. Thus, Chlamydia -mediated heart disease is induced by antigenic mimicry of a heart muscle–specific protein."
https://openalex.org/W2062567347,"Cellular ischemia results in activation of a number of kinases, including p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); however, it is not yet clear whether p38 MAPK activation plays a role in cellular damage or is part of a protective response against ischemia. We have developed a model to study ischemia in cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. In this model, two distinct phases of p38 MAPK activation were observed during ischemia. The first phase began within 10 min and lasted less than 1 h, and the second began after 2 h and lasted throughout the ischemic period. Similar to previous studies using in vivo models, the nonspecific activator of p38 MAPK and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, anisomycin, protected cardiac myocytes from ischemic injury, decreasing the release of cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase by approximately 25%. We demonstrated, however, that a selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB 203580, also protected cardiac myocytes against extended ischemia in a dose-dependent manner. The protective effect was seen even when the inhibitor was present during only the second, sustained phase of p38 MAPK activation. We found that ischemia induced apoptosis in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes and that SB 203580 reduced activation of caspase-3, a key event in apoptosis. These results suggest that p38 MAPK induces apoptosis during ischemia in cardiac myocytes and that selective inhibition of p38 MAPK could be developed as a potential therapy for ischemic heart disease.

In the isolated perfused rat heart, p38 MAPK is activated by global ischemia, and activation is maintained during reperfusion (6Bogoyevitch M.A. Gillespie-Brown J. Ketterman A.J. Fuller S.J.

In the same model, neither ERKs nor JNKs are activated by ischemia, whereas reperfusion after ischemia activates JNK (6Bogoyevitch M.A. Gillespie-Brown J. Ketterman A.J. Fuller S.J. Ben-Levy R.

Commun. 1996; 218: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) or lack of activation (6Bogoyevitch M.A. Gillespie-Brown J. Ketterman A.J. Fuller S.J. Ben-Levy R. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 162-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) of ERKs on reperfusion, possibly the result of different assay methods. More recently, it was observed that although JNK1 (also termed JNK46) is not activated by ischemia, this stress results in translocation of JNK1 to the nucleus, where it is then phosphorylated and activated on reperfusion (9Mizukami Y. Yoshioka K. Morimoto S. Yoshida K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16657-16662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Ischemia and reperfusion also activate members of the MAPK family in kidney and liver differentially (7Yin T. Sandhu G. Wolfgang C.D. Burrier A. Webb R.L. Rigel D.F. Hai T. Whelan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19943-19950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 10Bradham C.A. Stachlewitz R.F. Gao W. Qian T. Jayadev S. Jenkins G. Hannun Y. Lemasters J.J.

However it is not clear from these studies whether activation of these kinases is part of the protective response of the cell or if these signals mediate the cellular damage and death caused by ischemia or ischemia/reperfusion. Evidence suggests that myocardial ischemic cell death occurs by both apoptosis and necrosis (12Kajstura J. Cheng W. Reiss K. Clark W.A. Sonnenblick E.H. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Olivetti G. Anversa P.

From the timing of p38 MAPK activation during ischemia and initiation of apoptosis, Yinet al. (7Yin T. Sandhu G. Wolfgang C.D. Burrier A. Webb R.L. Rigel D.F. Hai T. Whelan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19943-19950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) speculate that activation of p38 MAPK initiates the signal for apoptotic cell death. Indeed, p38 MAPK activation has been implicated in mediating apoptosis in several cell types (14Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5036) Google Scholar, 15Kawasaki H. Morooka T. Shimohama S. Kimura J. Hirano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20490-20494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Recent studies in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes support a role for the α isoform of p38 MAPK in mediating apoptosis; overexpression of activated MAPK kinase 3b, which phosphorylates and activates p38 MAPK, induces apoptosis that is increased by coexpression of p38α and is decreased by expression of a dominant negative form of this isoform (17Wang Y. Huang S. Sah V.P. Ross Jr., J. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2161-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). In contrast, a separate study demonstrates that activation of p38 MAPK can prevent apoptosis in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (18Zechner D. Craig R. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Sabbadini R.A. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8232-8239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Furthermore, others have proposed that p38 MAPK activation mediates a phenomenon termed preconditioning, which confers cardiac protection from ischemia. Preconditioning is a highly effective method of protecting the heart from ischemic damage by subjecting it to sublethal periods of ischemia before the prolonged ischemia (6Bogoyevitch M.A. Gillespie-Brown J. Ketterman A.J. Fuller S.J. Ben-Levy R. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 162-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 8Knight R.J. Buxton D.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cohen M.V. Sideman S. Beyar R. Analytical and Quantitative Cardiology. Plenum Press, New York1997: 39-55Google Scholar). A protective function for p38 MAPK is supported by a recent study in which the role of p38 MAPK in preconditioning was examined in isolated rabbit cardiac myocytes (21Weinbrenner C. Liu G.-S. Cohen M.V. Downey J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2383-2391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with anisomycin, an activator of p38 MAPK, protects isolated rabbit cardiac myocytes against ischemia-induced cell fragility, leading to the suggestion that p38 MAPK protects the heart against ischemia. The addition of SB 203580, a selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK (22Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar), during a preconditioning treatment abolishes the protective effect of preconditioning, supporting the initial observation (21Weinbrenner C. Liu G.-S. Cohen M.V. Downey J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2383-2391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Similar results, showing that SB 203580 inhibits the protection afforded by ischemic preconditioning against myocardial infarction, were obtained using isolated rat hearts (24.Maulik, N., Yoshida, T., Zu, Y.-L., and Engelman, R. M. (1998) inVascular and Myocardial Aspects of Ischemic Heart Disease, Nevada.Google Scholar). Most previous ischemia studies have investigated MAPK activation in whole heart, which contains a large proportion of non-myocyte cells, mainly fibroblasts and endothelial cells. In the present study, we used primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes and confirmed that p38 MAPK is activated in a model of ischemia which uses a glucose-free hypoxic incubation. We report that activation of p38 MAPK occurred in two distinct phases and that inhibition of p38 MAPK during the second phase protected cardiac myocytes from ischemic injury. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that sustained p38 MAPK mediates ischemia-induced cell injury and death in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. All antibodies were used according to manufacturers' protocols. Anisomycin (Sigma) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at 5 mg/ml and used to give a final Me2SO concentration less than 0.01%. SB 203580 (Calbiochem) was dissolved in Me2SO at 10 mmand used to give final a Me2SO concentration less than 0.1%. Primary cultures of ventricular myocytes from 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were performed by gentle, serial trypsinization, as described previously (25Simpson P. Savion S. Circ. Res. 1982; 50: 101-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) with modifications (26Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Chen C.-H. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1086-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A preplating step was included to reduce the number of contaminating non-myocytes. Myocytes were plated at 800 cells/mm2 in 35- or 60-mm dishes (Falcon). Myocytes represented 90–95% of total adhering cells. Division of non-myocytes was prevented by the addition of 0.1 mm bromodeoxyuridine to medium for the first 4 days of culture. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 1% CO2 incubator in M-199 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 80 μm vitamin B12for the first 4 days. Vitamin C (80 μm) was present from day 2. On day 4, myocytes were placed in defined (10 μg/ml insulin, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 80 μm vitamin C, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 80 μm vitamin B12) M-199 medium. Myocytes exhibited a spontaneous contraction rate of approximately 250–300 beats/min, and cultures with a slower contraction rate were not used. The higher rate of contractionversus that seen by Simpson and Savion (25Simpson P. Savion S. Circ. Res. 1982; 50: 101-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) is partly the result of the increased density of cultures used here. Experiments were performed on days 5 and 6 of culture. Ischemia was induced in a humidified 37 °C incubator within an air-tight Plexiglas glove box (Anaerobic Systems) maintained with 0.2–0.5% O2, 1% CO2, and the balance N2. Medium (defined minimal essential medium and Hank's balanced salt solution without glucose) was equilibrated to low O2 within the glove box for at least 90 min before commencing experiments. Inside the glove box, cells were washed twice with warm, preequilibrated medium before the addition of incubation medium (1.5 ml/35-mm dish). O2was measured using an electronic gas analyzer OXOR®II or Fyrite® (both from Bacharach). After ischemic or normoxic treatments, incubation medium was stored at 4 °C, and the same volume of cold buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) was added to the cells. The cells were scraped and lysed by trituration. Lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was stored at 4 °C. LDH activity was measured from both medium (released LDH) and cell lysate (retained LDH) using a spectrophotometric assay (Sigma). Results were expressed as released LDH activity as a percent of total (released plus retained) LDH activity. After treatment, cells were placed on ice, and the incubation medium was aspirated and discarded. Cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Laemmli loading buffer at 2 × concentration (2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.04 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 0.12m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.28 m β-mercaptoethanol) was added (150 μl/35-mm dish). Cells were scraped and lysed by trituration. Samples were frozen in dry ice/ethanol then transferred immediately to −80 °C. Prior to electrophoresis, samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Electrophoresis was performed with approximately 20 μg of protein/sample on 10% low ratio bisacrylamide (100:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide). After Western blotting, filters were probed sequentially with dual phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180Tyr182), total p38 MAPK (both from New England Biolabs), or ERK2 antiserum, and immunoreactivity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. ERK2 antiserum (DC3; obtained from Dr. J. E. Ferrell, Stanford University) was raised against XenopusERK2 (27Chou S.-Y. Baichwal V. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1117-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and recognizes both non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of ERK2. Antiserum was used at a dilution of 1/500. Blots were stripped by incubation in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS for 30 min at 50 °C followed by two washes with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween, then blocking. Activation of p38 MAPK requires phosphorylation on both Thr180 and Tyr182, which is specifically recognized by the antibody used, and therefore activation is expressed as the ratio of dual phospho-p38 MAPK to total p38 MAPK immunoreactivity, which allows correction for differences in protein loading. Because dual phospho-p38 immunoreactivity was usually undetectable in control cells, results were normalized to the ratio of the 10-min ischemia sample. Phosphorylation of JNK was assayed as above, except that 50 μg of cell lysate protein was electrophoresed, and filters were probed with anti-active JNK (Promega). The p38 MAP kinase assay kit from New England Biolabs was used with a few modifications. Sodium orthovanadate (2 mm), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor were added fresh to lysis buffer, and the cells were lysed by trituration. p38 MAPK was immunoprecipitated, its catalytic activity determined using the in vitro kinase assay to phosphorylate recombinant activating transcription factor-2 (ATF2), and the reaction mixture separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blots were probed with the ATF2 antibody provided in the kit (specific for phospho-Thr71), and immunoreactivity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Filters were stripped as above and reprobed with anti-p38 MAPK. The ratio of phospho-ATF2 to p38 MAPK immunoreactivity was determined for each sample, and then results were expressed as fold activation over control. Cardiac myocytes (one 100-mm dish/treatment) were treated, and then the incubation medium was aspirated and discarded. Cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into 800 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) and lysed by trituration. Samples were extracted on ice for 15 min, and then cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. A sample of supernatant was retained for electrophoresis. 20 μl of dual phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180 Tyr182) antibody (New England Biolabs) was added to the remainder of the supernatant, and samples were rotated overnight at 4 °C. 60 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, and the samples were rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, electrophoresed on 10% low ratio bisacrylamide SDS-PAGE, then subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-p38 MAPK, anti-dual phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180 Tyr182), or anti-p38α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Autoradiographs were scanned using an ArcusII flatbed scanner (AGFA) with FotoLookPS 2.07.2, and the band density was analyzed by NIH ImageTM. Preparation of nuclear proteins from cardiac myocytes was performed exactly as described by Clerk and Sugden (28Clerk A. Sugden P.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Approximately 50 μg of nuclear protein was electrophoresed on 8% SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis was performed. ATF2 was detected using phosphorylation state-independent antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cell death from ischemic or normoxic incubations was assessed using two dyes that distinguish between live and dead cells. Calcein acetoxymethyl ester (calcein AM; Molecular Probes) and propidium iodide (PI) were added to the incubation medium at final concentrations of 2 μm and 1 μg/ml, respectively, and dishes incubated at 37 °C for 15 min (ischemic samples were maintained under ischemic conditions during this incubation). Cells were viewed using a Zeiss microscope and a 40 × objective and were scored as live (green cytosolic fluorescence from calcein AM) or dead (red nuclear fluorescence from PI). After ischemic or normoxic incubation, cells were scraped into incubation medium to allow retention of any floating cells and were harvested by centrifugation. DNA was prepared by standard techniques (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Identical amounts of DNA (2 μg) were electrophoresed through 1.8% agarose and DNA visualized on a UV transilluminator. Samples were treated exactly as for analysis of p38 MAPK immunoreactivity except that samples were submitted to 12% SDS-PAGE, and filters were probed with anti-CPP32 (H-277) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Data were compared using Student'st test for observations between two samples with unequal variance, with one-tailed distribution. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Activation of MAPKs in primary neonatal rat cardiac myocytes in response to simulated ischemia was investigated. The model used combines two properties of ischemia: decreased energy source, because incubations are performed in the absence of glucose, and hypoxia, with oxygen levels between 0.2 and 0.5%. p38 MAPK activation was estimated by Western blot analysis using an antibody that specifically recognizes the dual phosphorylated (on residues Thr180 and Tyr182), active form of the enzyme. Antibody recognizing p38 MAPK regardless of its phosphorylation state was used to normalize for differences in protein loading. This antibody is specific for the α isoform of p38 MAPK, and the level detected remained constant throughout ischemia. Dual phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was observed within 10 min of ischemia, remained maximal until 30 min, then decreased but remained above basal until 180 min of ischemia (Fig.1, A and B). At later time points, dual phosphorylation increased again with a peak at 240 min and remained high for 420 min (Fig. 1, A andB). We and others (30Webster K.A. Discher D.J. Bishopric N.H. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 453-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have observed that when cardiac myocytes are fed with fresh medium, they cease contracting for a period of time. In our study, cells stopped contracting for approximately 20 min, then spontaneous contraction recovered gradually to a normal rate within 60–90 min. Because this corresponds with the timing of the first phase of p38 MAPK activation, and a change of medium is required to induce ischemic conditions, we examined p38 phosphorylation levels after changing incubation medium and maintaining cells under normoxic conditions. Transient phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was observed after simply feeding fresh medium (Fig. 1, C and D). Cardiac myocytes can be maintained healthily in culture for up to 8 days with multiple changes of medium. Although this does not show that the initial ischemic p38 MAPK activation and that induced by changing medium are equivalent, these results do demonstrate that transient activation of p38 MAPK can occur without long term harmful effects to cardiac myocytes. To confirm that dual phosphorylation of p38 MAPK during ischemia truly reflected activation, p38 MAPK was immunoprecipitated and used in anin vitro kinase assay with recombinant ATF2 as a substrate. We observed more than a 6-fold increase in the phosphorylation of ATF2 over basal after 20 min of ischemia (Fig. 1 E) and more than a 4-fold increase after 25 or 30 min of ischemia (n = 1, data not shown). A similar activation ratio was obtained by incubating cells with anisomycin, an activator of p38 MAPK (Fig.1 E). Thus, p38 MAPK is indeed activated during ischemia. To determine if ischemia-induced phosphorylation is unique to p38 MAPK, we examined phosphorylation of other MAPKs. Phosphorylation of ERK2 (p42 MAPK) was estimated using a gel electrophoresis mobility shift assay with an antibody that detects both inactive (non-phosphorylated) and active (dual phosphorylated) ERK2. The reduced mobility form of ERK2, indicating phosphorylation as seen with 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment, was not observed at any time during prolonged ischemia (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, probing with anti-active JNK, which detects the dual phosphorylated active forms of both JNK1 and JNK2, showed little or no activation of JNK in 10–240 min of ischemia (Fig. 2 B) and no activation in 300, 360, or 420 min of ischemia (n = 1, data not shown). Taken together, our results indicate that changing medium transiently activates p38 MAPK, whereas ischemia results in a transient, then sustained activation of p38 MAPK, but not ERK2 or JNK, in primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes; these results are consistent with previous studies performed in whole heart (6Bogoyevitch M.A. Gillespie-Brown J.

Commun. 1996; 218: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Release of the cytosolic enzyme LDH, caused by cell membrane leakage, was used to assess cell damage resulting from ischemia. Under the conditions used in this study, 7–9 h of ischemic incubation resulted in the release of between 45 and 60% of cellular LDH, whereas 7–9 h of normoxic incubation resulted in release of less than 6% of total LDH. To determine if the activation of p38 MAPK protects myocytes from ischemic stress or mediates the damage from ischemia, we first used anisomycin. Anisomycin is a protein synthesis inhibitor that activates MAPK family members and has been shown to protect myocytes from ischemia (21Weinbrenner C. Liu G.-S. Cohen M.V. Downey J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2383-2391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This result has been used to implicate p38 MAPK in the protective mechanism (21Weinbrenner C. Liu G.-S. Cohen M.V. Downey J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2383-2391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). To confirm that anisomycin was protective in our model, cells were pretreated with anisomycin and then subjected to ischemia, either in the presence or absence of additional anisomycin. Fig.3 demonstrates that anisomycin protected myocytes from ischemia-induced injury; LDH release was reduced significantly when anisomycin was present either during the pretreatment only or during both the pretreatment and the prolonged ischemia. Anisomycin is a nonspecific reagent, and therefore these data do not prove that p38 MAPK activation is the mechanism by which anisomycin protects myocytes. More direct evidence for this would require inhibition of the anisomycin-induced protection by a selective p38 MAPK inhibitor. Therefore, we next used an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB 203580, which has been shown to inhibit p38 MAPK selectively over other MAPK family members and several other kinases (23Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar, 31Young P.R. McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. Kassis S. Doyle M.L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12116-12121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that the presence of SB 203580 during ischemia resulted in a significant dose-dependent decrease in LDH release from myocytes (Fig. 4 A). These data indicate that inhibition of p38 MAPK during ischemia protects myocytes from ischemic damage, whereas previous results have suggested that activation of p38 MAPK protects myocytes. As mentioned previously, activation of p38 MAPK was shown to occur in two phases in these cells (Fig. 1, A and B). To determine if inhibition of p38 MAPK during only one, or both phases, was necessary for the protection seen with SB 203580, the p38 MAPK inhibitor was added at different times during ischemia, and the effect on injury was examined. Adding the inhibitor to cells 45 min after the start of ischemia (which is after the first peak of p38 MAPK phosphorylation, Fig. 1 B) gave a level of protection not significantly different from that seen when the inhibitor was present from the start of ischemia (Fig. 4 B). SB 203580 is a reversible inhibitor; isolated p38 MAPK can be washed free of inhibitor and be fully active (23Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Galla"

Ceramide-induced cyto c release is prevented by preincubation of mitochondria with a low concentration (40 nm) of Bcl-2. The release takes place when cytoc is oxidized but not when it is reduced. Upon cytoc loss, mitochondrial oxygen consumption, mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨ), and Ca2+ retention are diminished. Incubation with Bcl-2 prevents, and addition of cytoc reverses the alteration of these mitochondrial functions. In ATP-energized mitochondria, ceramides do not alter ΔΨ, neither when cyto c is oxidized nor when it is reduced, ruling out a nonspecific disturbance by ceramides of mitochondrial membrane integrity. Furthermore, ceramides decrease the reducibility of cytoc. We conclude that the apoptogenic properties of ceramides are in part mediated via their interaction with mitochondrial cytoc followed by its release and that the redox state of cytoc influences its detachment by ceramide from the inner mitochondrial membrane. In the present study we show thatN-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide),N-hexanoylsphingosine (C6-ceramide), and, to a much lesser extent, C2-dihydroceramide induce cytochromec (cyto c) release from isolated rat liver mitochondria.

Recently, the importance of ceramide in cell metabolism has been broadly investigated. It is now evident that ceramide is involved as a second messenger in what has become known as the sphingomyelin cycle (1Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), apoptosis, and differentiation in many cell types (2Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which ceramide mediates apoptosis have not yet been fully addressed, however, it is known that mitochondria are targets of ceramide. Thus, direct inhibition of complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain by ceramide (3Gudz T.I. Tserng K.Y. Hoppel C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24154-24158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), ceramide-induced generation of reactive oxygen species in intact mitochondria (4Garcia-Ruiz C.

As a part of the respiratory chain, it is needed for cell life, and as one of the triggers of apoptosis, it is needed for cell death. It is now well accepted that many apoptogenic factors induce cell death via mitochondrial cyto c release (8Kluck R.M. Bossy Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 5303: 1132-1136Crossref Scopus (4266) Google Scholar). The released cytochrome switches on the death machinery, for example, by activation of caspases (9Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4448) Google Scholar, 10Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6199) Google Scholar). The anti-apoptoic protein, Bcl-2, was shown to prevent apoptosis both upstream (8Kluck R.M. Bossy Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 5303: 1132-1136Crossref Scopus (4266) Google Scholar) and downstream (11Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Brustugun O.T. Doskeland S.O. Nature. 1998; 391: 469Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar) of cyto c release. In the present study we show that 1) C2-ceramide (N-acetylsphingosine), C6-ceramide (N-hexanoylsphingosine), and, to a much lesser extent, DHC (C2-dihydroceramide) release cyto c from isolated mitochondria, 2) ceramide-induced cyto c release occurs when cyto c is oxidized but not when it is reduced, 3) this release is prevented by Bcl-2, 4) cyto c release causes a decrease in mitochondrial oxygen consumption, transmembrane potential (ΔΨ), and Ca2+ retention, all of which are prevented by preincubation of mitochondria with Bcl-2 and reversed by addition of cyto c, and 5) ceramide interacts with cytoc and changes its reducibility. C2- and C6-ceramide were obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (Läufelfingen, Switzerland), DHC from Calbiochem (Luzern, Switzerland), horse heart cytochrome cfrom Sigma, mouse monoclonal cyto c antibody from RDI (Flanders, NJ), anti-mouse Ig and horseradish peroxidase from Amersham and His6-human Bcl-2 from Novartis (Basel, Switzerland). Ceramide stock solutions were prepared at a 500 times concentration in ethanol (containing 1% Me2SO) and kept at −20 °C. The vehicle always served as control. Isolation of rat liver mitochondria was performed by differential centrifugation as described (12Lötscher H.R. Winterhalter K.H. Carafoli E. Richter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9325-9330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein content of mitochondria and the mitochondrial supernatants were determined by the Biuret method with bovine serum albumin as standard. Freshly isolated mitochondria (10 mg protein/ml) were incubated at room temperature in 0.1 m HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin (1.5 μg/ml each). To investigate the effect of ceramide when cyto c is oxidized, mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III was blocked by 50 nm antimycin A (AA), and after 1 min, ceramide (20 μm) or the vehicle was added. Mitochondria were incubated for 2 min and then energized with 1 mm ascorbate (Asc) plus 0.4 mmtetramethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine (TMPD) (Asc/TMPD). The effect of ceramide on mitochondria when cyto c is reduced was studied by addition of ceramide 1 min after Asc/TMPD. Bcl-2 (40 nm) was added 5 min before AA. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, mitochondria were spun at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was spun at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant of the second centrifugation was used for the detection of cytoc either spectrophotometrically or by gel electrophoresis. Spectrophotometric measurements were done in a Varian Cray spectrophotometer. As the blank sample, 10 mg of mitochondrial protein was diluted in 1 ml of the buffer, mixed gently, and spun immediately in 2 steps as mentioned above, and the supernatant was considered as the blank. The absorption of the supernatants of mitochondria incubated with ceramide or the vehicle was then recorded before and after reduction with sodium dithionite. The concentration of cytoc was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 19.0 mm−1 cm−1 for reduced cytoc at 550–540 nm (13Dutton P.L. Petty K.M. Bonner H.S. Morse S.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 387: 536-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and is expressed as the percentage of the control. For gel analysis, 20 μl of the supernatant of mitochondria incubated with ceramide or the vehicle was separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. For Western blotting, 20 μg of protein of supernatants were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, probed by a monoclonal mouse anti-cyto c antibody, and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence. For studying the possible influence of ΔΨ on mitochondrial cytoc release, ΔΨ was fully abrogated by incubation of mitochondria with 5 μm rotenone, 50 nm AA, and 1 μm carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone. The absence of ΔΨ was verified as explained below. After 10 min, mitochondria were spun as described above, and the supernatant was tested for the presence of cytoc by Western blotting. For studying mitochondrial functions, 1 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml was incubated in 0.1 m HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, with the following compounds present where appropriate: 10–20 μm ceramide, 50 nm AA to block complex III, Asc/TMPD to reduce cytoc, 1 mm KCN to block complex IV, 1 mm ATP as the substrate of ATPase, 1 μmcarbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone to uncouple mitochondria, and 1.7 μg/ml oligomycin to block ATPase. Ceramide was added when cyto c was oxidized, i.e. after AA, or when it was reduced, i.e., after Asc/TMPD. Bcl-2 was added 5 min prior to the above mentioned compounds. Oxygen consumption was measured at room temperature with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Yellow Spring Instruments, Yellow Spring, OH) under continuous stirring. Mitochondrial transmembrane potential was measured in an Aminco DW-2A spectrophotometer at 511–533 nm in the presence of 10 μm safranin as described (14Schweizer M. Richter C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4524-4528Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and release was measured in 0.1 mHEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10 μm CaCl2(10 nmol of Ca2+/mg of mitochondrial protein) at 685–675 nm in the presence of 50 μm Arsenazo III as described (15Frei B. Winterhalter K.H. Richter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7394-7401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The optical density of a 10 μm oxidized horse heart cyto c solution in the presence of 10 μm ceramide or the vehicle was recorded between 380 and 600 nm at 1-nm intervals with a Varian Cray spectrophotometer. Oxidized cyto c was then reduced stepwise by the repeated addition of 2 μm ascorbate (taken from a 2 mm freshly prepared stock solution) to the cuvette. After each reduction step, the optical density was again recorded. The recorded optical density of the oxidized cyto c in each wavelength was subtracted from the corresponding one of the reduced cyto c and plotted against the wavelengths. Ceramide-induced mitochondrial cyto c release was determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 A), by Western blotting (Fig.1 B), and spectrophotometrically (Fig. 1 C). In these experiments, ceramide was added when cyto c was mainly oxidized, i.e. after blocking the complex III. Addition of ceramide to mitochondria when cyto c was mainly reduced,i.e., in the presence of Asc/TMPD, did not increase the released cyto c, compared to the control (Fig.1 D). Preincubation of mitochondria with 40 nmBcl-2 (4 pmol of Bcl-2/mg of mitochondrial protein) fully prevented the release of cyto c induced by ceramide (see Fig.1 B). When equal volumes (20 μl) of the supernatants of mitochondria incubated with ceramides were separated by SDS-PAGE, an increase in the total protein amount released into the supernatant was detected (Fig. 1 A). When equal amounts (20 μg) of the released proteins were analyzed by Western blot, a specific increase in the cyto c was found (Fig. 1 B). To investigate the consequences of cyto c release on mitochondrial functions, we measured mitochondrial oxygen consumption, ΔΨ, and Ca2+ homeostasis. Fig.2 A shows that addition of ceramide to mitochondria when cyto c was oxidized decreased the oxygen consumption supported by Asc/TMPD. Conversely, ceramide added to mitochondria when cyto c was reduced did not change the oxygen consumption (Fig. 2 B). The decreased oxygen consumption caused by ceramide was prevented by preincubation of mitochondria with 40 nm Bcl-2 (Fig. 2 C) and was reversed by the addition of 200 nm exogenous cytoc (200 pmol of cyto c/mg of mitochondrial protein) (Fig. 2 D). A decrease in ΔΨ is considered important when cells commit suicide (16Mignotte B. Vayssiere J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 A shows that addition of ceramide to mitochondria when cyto c was oxidized caused a decrease in ΔΨ. This figure also shows that addition of 200 nm exogenous cyto c resulted in a full gain of ΔΨ. Incubation of mitochondria with 40 nm Bcl-2 prevented the loss of ΔΨ caused by ceramide (not shown). Fig. 3 B shows that ceramide did not alter ΔΨ when cyto c was mainly reduced. When ΔΨ was built up as a consequence of ATP hydrolysis instead of respiration, ceramide did not change ΔΨ, neither when cyto c was oxidized nor when it was reduced (not shown). Mitochondria are important calcium buffers in eukaryotic cells, and mitochondrial calcium release is involved in apoptosis (17Kruman I. Guo Q. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 51: 293-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Fig.4 shows that C6-ceramide, added to mitochondria when cyto c was mainly oxidized, caused a decrease in Ca2+ retention by mitochondria, in a Bcl-2 sensitive manner. The same results were obtained with C2-ceramide and, to a minor extent, with DHC (not shown). Addition of ceramide to mitochondria when cyto c was reduced did not change the mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis (not shown). Reduction of cyto c can be followed photometrically. Fig.5 shows that in the presence of C2-ceramide, the reduction of cyto c by Asc was hampered, as evidenced by the smaller increase in the optical densities of the γ- and α-regions. Again, C2-ceramide was most effective, followed by C6-ceramide and DHC (not shown). The present study shows that ceramide induces cyto crelease from isolated mitochondria, an event strongly influenced by the redox state of cyto c, and that incubation of mitochondria with Bcl-2 prevents the cyto c release. Release of cytoc decreases mitochondrial oxygen consumption, ΔΨ, and the Ca2+ buffering capacity of mitochondria, all of which are reversed by addition of exogenous cyto c. For all parameters measured, the observed rank order of potency is C2 > C6 > DHC. This study also provides evidence for a possible direct interaction of ceramide and cytoc. There is growing evidence that mitochondria are involved in apoptosis (16Mignotte B. Vayssiere J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The release of cyto c from mitochondria triggers apoptosis (18Rossé T. Olivier R. Monney L. Rager M. Conus S. Fellay I. Jansen B. Borner C. Nature. 1998; 391: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), and ΔΨ decreases during apoptosis (16Mignotte B. Vayssiere J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 19Shidoji Y. Nakamura N. Moriwaki H. Muto Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 932-947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, prevention of cyto c release (22Macho A. Hirsch T. Marzo I. Marchetti P. Dallaporta B. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. J. Immunol. 1998; 158: 4612-4619Google Scholar) as well as stabilization of ΔΨ (23Hennet T. Bertoni G. Richter C. Peterhans E. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1456-1460PubMed Google Scholar) prevent apoptosis. Furthermore, mitochondria carry the pro- and antiapoptotic proteins, cytoc and Bcl-2. The presence of procaspase-3 in mitochondria was also shown recently (24Mancine M. Nicholson D.W. Roy S. Thornberry N.A. Peterson E.P. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1485-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Several mediators, pathways, and factors are involved in apoptosis (25Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6179) Google Scholar,26Hermann S. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2425) Google Scholar). Among them, ceramide has been shown to directly target mitochondria. Zhang et al. (27Zhang P. Liu B. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Rhee S.G. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30615-30618Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) showed that in Molt-4 leukemic cells, 6 h of incubation with C6-ceramide increased the cytosolic concentration of cyto c, which was preventable by overexpression of Bcl-2. In a study by Amarante-Mendeset al. (28Amarante-Mendes G.P. Naekyung Kim C. Liu L. Huang Y. Perkins C.L. Green D.R. Bhalla K. Blood. 1998; 91: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) 6 h of incubation with C2-ceramide caused the cytosolic accumulation of cytoc in control but not in Bcr-Abl-overexpressing HL-60 cells. In the present study, we show that ceramide directly causes the release of cyto c from isolated mitochondria and accordingly hypothesize that cyto c is the prime mitochondrial target of ceramide. The fact that incubation of mitochondria with a low concentration of Bcl-2, used in this study, prevents ceramide-induced cyto c release and its consequences suggests a specific function of the oncoprotein in ceramide-mediated apoptotic signals. To investigate a possible direct interaction of ceramide with cytoc, we primed Sepharose columns with the biologically actived-C2-ceramide or biologically inactivel-C2-ceramide. 2P. Ghafourifar, C. Richter, and J. Brunner, unpublished observation.We observed that d-C2-ceramide but notl-C2-ceramide columns selectively retained cytoc and that the retained protein could be eluted withd-C2-ceramide. We also observed that reduced cyto c had a much lower affinity tod-C2-ceramide column, compared to the oxidized cyto c. Because of that observation together with the fact that ceramide affects the reducibility of cyto c (Fig. 5), we hypothesize that ceramide may directly interact with cytoc, with a higher affinity for the oxidized protein, and that this interaction changes the physicochemical properties of cytoc, leading to its rejection from mitochondria. The fact that cyto c has multiple lipid binding sites and that the lipid-bound cyto c shows a lower affinity for attachment to the artificial membranes (29Subramanian M. Jutila A. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1394-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) strengthens this hypothesis. Under our experimental conditions, prevention of mitochondrial cytoc reduction is paralleled by the disappearance of ΔΨ. To distinguish which of these two is decisive for ceramide-induced cytoc release, we investigated by Western blot analysis whether cyto c is released because of ΔΨ collapse. We found that the absence of ΔΨ, achieved by blocking respiration and uncoupling of mitochondria, does not result in cyto c release, indicating that binding of cyto c to the outer side of the inner mitochondrial membrane does not require ΔΨ. These results also indicate that the release of cyto c by ceramide is not a consequence of a nonspecific solubilization of mitochondrial membranes due to the lipophilicity of ceramide, but rather is a specific event. The release of other mitochondrial proteins apart from cytoc is also increased upon treatment with ceramide (Fig.1 A). We argue that this apparently nonspecific protein release by ceramide is due to a general weakening of mitochondria upon cyto c release. Fig. 1 D supports this argument by showing that when ceramide does not cause cyto c loss, other mitochondrial proteins are also not released. This notion, together with the fact that addition of exogenous cyto c reverses all the altered mitochondrial functions, leads us to conclude that mitochondrial cyto c is a prime target for ceramide. This conclusion does not rule out other possibilities, for example, the modification of Bcl-2 by ceramide. In contrast to the finding that binding of cyto c to the inner mitochondrial membrane is not a function of ΔΨ, the formation and the maintenance of ΔΨ is dependent on the presence of a functional cyto c (cf. Fig. 3 A). Disruption of ΔΨ was shown to be involved in ceramide-induced apoptosis (30De-Maria R. Lenti L. Malisan F. d'Agostino F. Tomassini B. Zeuner A. Rippo M.R. Testi R. Science. 1997; 277: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). According to our study, cyto c has a critical role in ΔΨ formation, in that stabilization of cytoc stabilizes ΔΨ. Bcl-2 is located at the outer mitochondrial membrane (31Lithgow T. van Driel R. Bertram J.F. Strasser A. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 4: 411-417Google Scholar) and has been shown to stabilize ΔΨ (23Hennet T. Bertoni G. Richter C. Peterhans E. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1456-1460PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that Bcl-xL, another oncoprotein with mitochondrial location, binds cyto c (32Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Schofield L. Israels S. Roncinske R. Yoshida K. Bharti A. Yuan Z. Saxena S. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6939-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Based on the present results and the close proximity of Bcl-2 to mitochondrial cyto c, it may be speculated that Bcl-2 stabilizes ΔΨ by preventing cytoc loss. Nonspecific solute transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane, operated via a Bcl-2-sensitive megachannel (the “permeability transition pore”) is considered to be the reason for the collapse of ΔΨ and many other features of apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 33Hirsch T. Marzo I. Kroemer G. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). It was also reported that operation of such a pore causes cytoc release, and thus it was concluded that cyto crelease occurs downstream to pore formation and ΔΨ collapse (34Yang J.C. Cortopassi G.A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Because addition of cyto c reverses the ceramide-induced decrease in mitochondrial oxygen consumption, ΔΨ, and Ca2+-maintaining capacity (see Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4), we argue that ceramide-induced apoptosis is not mediated via opening a nonspecific megachannel or pore. The fact that ceramide does not affect ΔΨ when it is supported by ATP gives further support to this argument. It was reported by Gudz et al. (3Gudz T.I. Tserng K.Y. Hoppel C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24154-24158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) that ceramide decreases the activity of complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, as deduced from the measurement of mitochondrial oxygen consumption supported by Asc/TMPD. Cyto c shuttles electrons between complex III and IV, and oxygen is consumed at the level of complex IV. Figs. 2 D and 3 A show that the addition of cytoc to mitochondria recovered the decreased respiration and the reduced ΔΨ. Therefore, we conclude that parts of the ceramide-induced reduction of complex III activity is due to cytoc loss. Garcia-Ruiz et al. (4Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Fernandez-Checa J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11369-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) showed that ceramide induces superoxide radical formation in isolated rat liver mitochondria. From the elegant recent study by Cai and Jones (35Cai J. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11401-11404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), it is evident that superoxide formation by mitochondria is a consequence, and not the cause, of cyto c loss. Release of cyto c from mitochondria produces a gap in the hierarchically arranged mitochondrial respiratory complexes III and IV, and therefore a site for electron leakage. Present finding explains the ceramide-induced superoxide formation, reported by Garcia-Ruiz et al. (4Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Fernandez-Checa J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11369-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), and supports the hypothesis that cyto c is the prime mitochondrial site of action of ceramide. We reported (23Hennet T. Bertoni G. Richter C. Peterhans E. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1456-1460PubMed Google Scholar) that TNF-α added to cells induces a drop in ΔΨ that is accompanied by increased reactive oxygen species formation in mitochondria and that both events are prevented in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells. It is known that de novo ceramide synthesis is part of the transmembrane signaling transduction mechanism of TNF-α receptor (36Kuroki J. Hirokawa M. Kitabayashi A. Lee M. Horiuchi T. Kawabata Y. Miura A.B. Leukemia. 1996; 10: 1950-1958PubMed Google Scholar, 37Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Exp.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar). It was also reported that stimulation of TNF-α receptors causes apoptotic cell death by releasing mitochondrial cytoc (41Tang D.G. Li L. Zhu Z.Y. Joshi B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The present study makes the link: after de novo ceramide synthesis upon TNF-α receptor stimulation, mitochondrial cyto c is released, ΔΨ is decreased, and reactive oxygen species formation is favored. Accordingly, overexpression of Bcl-2 prevents the apoptogenic properties of TNF-α (37Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) by prevention of ceramide-induced cyto c release. It was reported by Hampton et al. (42Hampton M.B. Zhivotovsky B. Slater A.F.G. Burgess D.H. Orrenius S. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) that cytoc does not necessarily need to be reduced to activate caspases. The investigators acknowledged, however, that they were unable to keep cyto c oxidized in the presence of cytosolic extracts. In the present study, we show that oxidized cyto cis released by ceramide (Fig. 1, A–C) and that ceramide decreases the reducibility of oxidized cyto c (Fig. 5). Regarding the fact that both ceramide and cyto c are strong mediators of caspase-induced apoptosis (43Tepper A.D. Boesen-de-Cock J.G.R. de Vries E. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2042381753,"Functional insulin receptors are known to occur in pancreatic beta cells; however, except for a positive feedback on insulin synthesis, their physiological effects are unknown. Amperometric measurements at single, primary pancreatic beta cells reveal that application of exogenous insulin in the presence or absence of nonstimulatory concentrations of glucose evokes exocytosis mediated by the beta cell insulin receptor. Insulin also elicits increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in beta cells but has minimal effects on membrane potential. Conditions where the insulin receptor is blocked or cell surface concentration of free insulin is reduced during exocytosis diminishes secretion induced by other secretagogues, providing evidence for direct autocrine action of insulin upon secretion from the same cell. These results indicate that the beta cell insulin receptor can mediate positive feedback for insulin secretion. The presence of a positive feedback mechanism for insulin secretion mediated by the insulin receptor provides a potential link between impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2126782620,"The so-called thioredoxin system, thioredoxin (Trx), thioredoxin reductase (Trr), and NADPH, acts as a disulfide reductase system and can protect cells against oxidative stress. In<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, two thioredoxins (Trx1 and Trx2) and one thioredoxin reductase (Trr1) have been characterized, all of them located in the cytoplasm. We have identified and characterized a novel thioredoxin system in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. The<i>TRX3</i> gene codes for a 14-kDa protein containing the characteristic thioredoxin active site (WCGPC). The <i>TRR2</i>gene codes for a protein of 37 kDa with the active-site motif (CAVC) present in prokaryotic thioredoxin reductases and binding sites for NADPH and FAD. We cloned and expressed both proteins in<i>Escherichia coli</i>, and the recombinant Trx3 and Trr2 proteins were active in the insulin reduction assay. Trx3 and Trr2 proteins have N-terminal domain extensions with characteristics of signals for import into mitochondria. By immunoblotting analysis of<i>Saccharomyces</i> subcellular fractions, we provide evidence that these proteins are located in mitochondria. We have also constructed <i>S. cerevisiae</i> strains null in Trx3 and Trr2 proteins and tested them for sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide. The Δtrr2 mutant was more sensitive to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, whereas the Δ<i>trx3</i> mutant was as sensitive as the wild type. These results suggest an important role of the mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase in protection against oxidative stress in<i>S. cerevisiae</i>."
https://openalex.org/W2163309884,"Casade Blue (CB), a fluorescent dye, was used to investigate the dynamics of interactions between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumenal chaperones including calreticulin, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), and ERp57. PDI and ERp57 were labeled with CB, and subsequently, we show that the fluorescence intensity of the CB-conjugated proteins changes upon exposure to microenvironments of a different polarity. CD analysis of the purified proteins revealed that changes in the fluorescence intensity of CB-ERp57 and CB-PDI correspond to conformational changes in the proteins. Using this technique we demonstrate that PDI interacts with calreticulin at low Ca2+ concentration (below 100 μm), whereas the protein complex dissociates at >400 μmCa2+. These are the Ca2+ concentrations reminiscent of Ca2+ levels found in empty or full ER Ca2+ stores. The N-domain of calreticulin interacts with PDI, but Ca2+ binding to the C-domain of the protein is responsible for Ca2+ sensitivity of the interaction. ERp57 also interacts with calreticulin through the N-domain of the protein. Initial interaction between these proteins is Ca2+-independent, but it is modulated by Ca2+binding to the C-domain of calreticulin. We conclude that changes in ER lumenal Ca2+ concentration may be responsible for the regulation of protein-protein interactions. Calreticulin may play a role of Ca2+ “sensor” for ER chaperones via regulation of Ca2+-dependent formation and maintenance of structural and functional complexes between different proteins involved in a variety of steps during protein synthesis, folding, and post-translational modification.

How chaperones interact to facilitate protein folding and what is a role of the ER lumenal ions in these processes is not known. In this paper we studied interactions between calreticulin and two related ER membrane chaperones, PDI and ERp57, and we investigated the role of Ca2+ in these protein-protein interactions. We show that calreticulin interacts with PDI in a Ca2+-dependent manner reminiscent of emptying and refilling of the ER Ca2+ stores. Formation of the ERp57-calreticulin complex was initiated by a Ca2+-independent conformational change in ERp57 followed by additional Ca2+-dependent conformational changes in the complex. Ca2+ sensitivity of the calreticulin-PDI and calreticulin-ERp57 complexes was confined to the high capacity Ca2+ binding, C-domain of calreticulin. We conclude that calreticulin interacts with ER lumenal chaperones and that the protein may play a role of Ca2+ “sensor” for these interactions.

Proteins were labeled with Cascade Blue (CB) acetyl azide by adaptation to a FluroTag FITC Conjugation Kit procedure as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, CB (1.11 mg/ml) was dissolved in 100 mm carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.0. Six hundred μg of purified PDI or ERp57 (2.6 mg/ml) in a 100 mm sodium carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.0, was used directly for labeling. The dye was added dropwise to the protein mixture with constant stirring. The reaction vial was incubated in the dark for 2 h at room temperature with gentle stirring. Labeled proteins were separated from the free dye on a Sephadex G-25M column (3.5 ml, bed height 2.6 cm) previously equilibrated with PBS. The reaction mixture was applied, and fractions (0.25 ml each) were eluted with PBS. The fluorescence of each fraction was determined at the excitation wavelength 385 nm and the emission wavelength 430 nm using a Perkin-Elmer spectrophotometer. Fractions containing labeled protein were combined and used directly for protein-protein interaction studies. Determination of the stoichiometry of the labeling revealed that there were 4 and 5 molecules of CB conjugated per each molecule of ERp57 and PDI, respectively, indicating that over 90% of the protein was labeled with the dye. Fluorescence measurements were performed at an excitation wavelength 385 nm (slit, 15 nm) and an emission wavelength 430 nm (slit, 15 nm) at room temperature using a Luminescence Spectrometer LS50B (Perkin-Elmer). Fluorescence intensities were measured with constant stirring in 1.5 ml of a binding buffer containing 10 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 100 mmKCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA. Appropriate proteins and/or ions were added to the reaction mixture, and the corresponding changes in fluorescence intensity were monitored. Quantum yields of CB or CB-labeled proteins were calculated from the emission spectra (420–460 nm) obtained at the λexcitation of 385 nm. Initial rates of the protein-protein interaction and time constants were calculated using an exponential decay function using Origin version 4.1 software. For circular dichroism (CD) analysis, proteins were dialyzed for 16 h against a buffer containing of 25 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Dialysis was performed using Spectra/Por dialysis tubing (cut-off 12–14 kDa) in a QuixSep Microdialyzer. CD measurements were carried out on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD), interfaced to an Epson Equity 386/25 and controlled by Jasco software. The thermostable cell holder was maintained at 25 °C with a Lauda RMS circulatory water bath (Lauda, Westbury, NY). The instrument was routinely calibrated with ammonium d-(+)-10-camphor sulfonate at 290.5 and 192 nm. Each sample was scanned 10 times, and noise reduction was applied to remove the high frequency before calculating molar ellipticities. The voltage to multiplier was kept below 500 V to prevent distortion of the CD spectrum. The cell path length used was 0.02 cm, and the protein concentrations were 0.6 mg/ml in the far ultraviolet. Concentrations were determined on a Cary 3 UV-visible spectrophotometer and were corrected for light scattering. Molar extinction coefficients were calculated from tyrosine and tryptophan compositional values and were 43,780, 45,040, and 81,480 for ERp57, PDI, and calreticulin, respectively. Molar ellipticities were calculated from the following equation: [θ] = θobs/10 × l × c, where θobs is in millidegrees, l is the pathlength in centimeters, and c is the concentration in moles/liter × number of amino acids in the sequence. The unit for molar ellipticity is degree centimeter squared per pmol. The CD spectra were analyzed for secondary structure elements by the Contin ridge regression analysis program of Provencher and Glöckner (38Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar). All recombinant techniques were conducted according to standard protocols (39Ausubel F.M. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publication Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar). Refolding of RNase B in the presence of CB-labeled proteins was carried out as described previously (23Zapun A. Darby N.J. Tessier D.C. Michalak M. Bergeron J.J.M. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6009-6012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated using Max Chelator, Winmaxc version 1.70. CB acetyl azide reacts with aliphatic amines in proteins to yield stable carboxamides, is highly fluorescent, and resists quenching upon protein conjugation (40Whitaker J.E. Haugland R.P. Moore P.L. Hewitt P.C. Reese M. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). One unique feature of CB is that it has a different fluorescence intensity depending on the polarity of the solvent used (Fig. 1 and TableI). For example, CB alone had relatively high fluorescence intensity in PBS and water but significantly lower fluorescence in nonpolar solvents such as n-propyl alcohol and n-butanol (Fig. 1 and Table I). This observation suggested to us that the dye may also be sensitive to exposure to the hydrophilic or hydrophobic environments in a protein. To test these ER lumenal chaperones, PDI and ERp57 were labeled with CB to generate CB-PDI and CB-ERp57, respectively. Labeled proteins displayed emission and excitation spectrum similar to the unconjugated fluorophore. Similar to CB alone, fluorescence intensity of the protein-conjugated CB (CB-ERp57 and CB-PDI) had different relative quantum yields in various solvents (Table I) suggesting that the protein-conjugated dye had a different fluorescence intensity depending on whether it was exposed to a polar or a nonpolar microenvironment.Table IRelative quantum yield of Cascade Blue acetyl azide (CB) and CB coupled to ERp57 (CB-ERp57) or PDI (CB-PDI) in different solvents of various polaritySolventCBCB-ERp57CB-PDIQλmaxQλmaxQλmaxnmnmnmPBS141614361435Water0.944160.834361.37435Ethanol0.684080.634311.13430Methanol0.624070.164350.8743025% glycerol0.384150.924370.1744150% glycerol0.284150.194380.38437Propyl alcohol0.0054120.344330.61432Butanol0.00374130.224380.29433 Open table in a new tab Native PDI and ERp57 catalyze a variety of thiol/disulfide exchange reactions (17Noiva R.

It was, therefore, important to demonstrate that CB labeling of PDI and ERp57 does not interfere with the function of these chaperones. We examined disulfide isomerase activity of CB-PDI and CB-ERp57 on the refolding of RNase B the presence and absence of calreticulin and calnexin (Fig. 2). Fig.2 shows that similar to native PDI and ERp57 (23Zapun A. Darby N.J. Tessier D.C. Michalak M. Bergeron J.J.M. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6009-6012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), CB-PDI and CB-ERp57 catalyzed refolding of RNase B indicating that labeled proteins retained their chaperone activity. Refolding of RNase B catalyzed by CB-PDI or CB-ERp57 was not influenced by changes of Ca2+ or Zn2+ concentration. Next we tested effects of ions (Ca2+ and Zn2+) and purified calreticulin on CB alone and on CB labeled proteins. Fluorescence intensity of CB alone did not change in the presence of Ca2+, Zn2+ or purified calreticulin (Fig.3 A). However, the amplitude of fluorescence of the labeled proteins was sensitive to ion-induced conformational changes. Fig. 3, B and C show that addition of Zn2+ to CB-PDI or CB-ERp57 resulted in significant decrease in fluorescence intensity of the labeled proteins. To test whether changes in fluorescence intensity induced by Zn2+ (Fig. 3, B and C) reflected conformational alterations in CB-PDI and CB-ERp57 we carried out CD analysis of the purified proteins. Fig. 4reveals that the CD spectra of ERp57 and PDI are very similar in shape, having minima at 219 and 210 nm with molar ellipticity values of −10330o and −10180o at 219 nm and −9490° and −9670° at 210 nm, respectively. The Contin version program for calculating secondary structural elements (TableII) indicates the α-helical content for both proteins was 25–30%, and the combined β-sheet and β-turn was ∼50%. The values for PDI are similar to those reported in previous studies by Wetterau et al. (41Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Laplauch M. McLean L.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4406-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 42Wetterau J.R. Combs K.A. McLean L.R. Spinner S.N. Aggerbeck L.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9728-9735Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Both proteins underwent a conformational change upon addition of Zn2+ with a loss in the amount of α-helix and a concomitant increase in β-sheet–β-turn. Similarly, pancreatic calreticulin showed no change upon addition of Ca2+ but underwent a reduction in α-helix and an increase in combined β-sheet–β-turn upon addition of 2 mm Zn2+, a finding also reported earlier by Khanna et al. (26Khanna N.C. Tokuda M. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8883-8887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apoprotein has ∼10% α-helix and 50% β-sheet–β-turn, upon analysis (Table II). We concluded that Zn2+-dependent changes in the fluorescence intensity of CB-ERp57 and CB-PDI (Fig. 3) may be due to conformational changes in the proteins (Fig. 4) resulting in exposure of the conjugated CB to protein microenvironments of a different polarity (Fig. 1).Figure 4CD analysis of ER lumenal proteins.

We first investigated the interaction between CB-PDI and calreticulin (Fig. 5). CB-PDI was incubated with Zn2+ to induce conformational changes in the protein followed by addition of the purified pancreatic calreticulin (Fig.5 A). Fig. 5 A shows that calreticulin induced a very rapid increase in fluorescence intensity of CB-PDI indicative of protein-protein interaction-induced conformational changes in the protein. The calculated initial rate of calreticulin and PDI interaction was 21.4 ± 0.6 units/s (mean ± S.E.,n = 3), whereas the time constant of the process was 0.16 ± 0.01 s (mean ± S.E., n = 3). Fig. 5 B illustrates that the effect was saturable with respect to calreticulin and did not require the presence of Zn2+. Identical results were obtained withE. coli- and Pichia-expressed recombinant proteins (data not shown). Fig. 5 C reveals that, in agreement with our earlier observations (16Baksh S. Burns K. Andrin C. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31338-31344Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), calreticulin did not interact with PDI in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+.

The enzyme is a possible drug target for treatment of certain cancers and for tuberculosis. The crystal structure of the complex of the enzyme from Escherichia coli, and the fungal mycotoxin cerulenin reveals that the inhibitor is bound in a hydrophobic pocket formed at the dimer interface. Cerulenin is covalently attached to the active site cysteine through its C2 carbon atom.

Because the number of TNFR members is rapidly expanding, we expected that even more numbers of the superfamily would exist. By searching an EST (expressed sequence tag) data base, we identified a new member of the TNFR and its ligand. Here we give an initial characterization of the receptor and its ligand. A data base containing more than 2 million ESTs obtained from over 750 different cDNA libraries was generated by Human Genome Sciences, Inc., using high throughput automated DNA sequence analysis of randomly selected human cDNA clones. A specific homology and motif search using the known amino acid sequence and motif of TNFR members against this data base revealed several ESTs with a translated sequence 35–55% homologous to that of the TNFR family. Several clones were identified from cDNA libraries of PHA-activated T cells, T helper cells, leukocytes, a healing abdomen wound, primary dendritic cells, and adipose tissue. A full-length AITR cDNA clone encoding an intact N-terminal signal peptide was obtained from a human activated T cell library and selected for further investigation. The complete cDNA sequence of both strands of this clone was determined, and its homology to TNFR members was confirmed. Similarly, TL6 (TNF ligand 6) was identified through a systematic comparison of sequence homology with TNF ligand family members. Partial TL6 sequences, which were 25% homologous to that of TNF ligand family members, were identified from endothelial, HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial cell), brain, and fetal liver cDNA libraries. A full-length cDNA clone was obtained from a human brain cDNA library. Full-length and HA (hemagglutinin A epitope)-tagged AITR encoding the putative entire AITR protein (amino acids 26–234) were amplified by PCR using sense (5′-CTAGCTAGCTAGVVVAGCGCCCCACCGGGGGTCCC-3′, and 5′-CTAGCTAGCTAGCTATCCATATGATGTTCCAGATTATGCTCAGCGCCCCACCGGGGGTCCC-3′, respectively) and antisense (5′-AAGGAAAAAAGC GGGCCGCTCACACCCACAGGTCTCCCAG-3′) primers, cut withNheI/NotI, and fused in-frame downstream of a CD5 leader sequence (28Jang I.K.

Science. 1995; 269: 1421-1427Crossref Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 37Schindler U. Baichwal V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5820-9796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis, cDNA probes were labeled with 32P using the Rediprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Unincorporated nucleotide was removed from the labeled probe using CHROMA SPIN-100 (CLONTECH). Two human multiple tissue poly(A) RNA blots containing approximately 2 μg of poly(A) RNA per lane from various human tissues were purchased fromCLONTECH. In addition, two cell line blots containing 20 mg of total RNA from different cell lines were used. Northern blotting was performed with the Expressed Hybridization Solution (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's manual. For RT-PCR analysis, total RNA was isolated from human PBMC after stimulation with dexamethasone, PMA/ionomycin, or anti-CD3/CD28 mAbs and from unstimulated or LPS-stimulated HUVEC cells. RT-PCR was performed under standard conditions. pcDNA3/CD5L-AITR-HA plasmid (5 μg/10 cm-plate) was co-transfected into HEK293 EBNA cells (2 × 106 cells/plate) by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method with pRK/TRAF1, -2, -3, -5, or -6-Flag vector (5 μg/plate). Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors). For immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated with anti-Flag M2 (Eastman Kodak Co.) or control murine IgG1 mAb at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by incubation with 20 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein G-Sepharose (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) for another hour. Precipitates were thoroughly washed with lysis buffer, then fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel before transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Western blot analysis was performed with anti-HA mAb coupled with horseradish peroxidase (Boehringer Mannheim) and visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Approximately 0.5 × 106 HEK293 EBNA cells/well were seeded on 6-well plates. After 24 h, cells were transfected by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method using various combinations of pcDNA3.1/CD5L-AITR plus pRK5 plasmids encoding TRAFs, dnTRAF2, NIK, or dnNIK. The total amount of plasmid was adjusted to 2.0 μg by adding empty vector. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were lysed in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was measured using 20 μl of cell extract. 5 μl of cell extract was used to assay β-galactosidase activity as an internal control, and luminescence values were normalized by individual β-galactosidase activity. AITR-Fc fusion protein was used for ligand screening and cell-binding experiments. A fragment encoding the predicted extracellular domain of AITR (amino acids 26–139) was amplified using a sense primer flanked by an NheI site (5′-AGACCCAAGCTTGTGGGCTCTTGAAA CCCGGCATG-3′) and an antisense primer flanked by a BglII site (5′-GAAAGATCT GGGCTCTGCCGGCGGGGACCCTGGGAC-3′). The amplified fragment was cut with NheI/BglII and cloned into mammalian vector pCEP4, in-frame with CD5L at the 5′ end and with the Fc portion of human IgG1 at the 3′ end (pCEP4/CD5L-AITR-Fc). pCEP4/CD5L-AITR-Fc was transfected into HEK293 EBNA cells. AITR-Fc fusion protein was purified from pCEP4/CD5L-AITR-Fc-transfected HEK293 EBNA cell supernatants using the protein G column. To generate a Flag-tagged soluble form of TL6 protein (amino acids 39–169), the Flag-tagged TL6 expression vector (pCEP4/CD5L-TL6-Flag) was constructed by PCR amplification of TL6 coding sequences using sense (5′-CTAGCTAGCCCAGCGCCCCGACTACAAGGA CGACGATGACAAGGAGACT GCTAAGGAGCCC-3′) and antisense (5′-CCGCTC GAGCTATAGTAAGAAGGCTCC-3′) primers, digesting the product withNheI/XhoI, and cloning into pCEP4, in-frame with the CD5L sequence. The construct was expressed in HEK293 EBNA cells. Transfected cell supernatants containing secreted TL6-Flag were harvested and used for binding assays. For some experiments, TL6-Flag protein was purified from harvested supernatants, using anti-Flag gel (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein binding assays were done essentially as described (12Pan G. O'Rourke K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Gentz R. Ebner R. Ni J. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 276: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). For cell-binding assays, HEK293 EBNA cells were transfected using pcDNA3.1/CD5L-AITR or pcDNA3.1, as described above. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested and incubated consecutively with TL6-Flag-containing supernatant, anti-Flag antibody, and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL). Flow cytometry analysis was performed using the Becton Dickinson FACScan (San Jose, CA). Jurkat T cells were stably transfected by electroporation using linearized pcDNA3.1/CD5L-AITR and selected in the presence of Zeocin (Invitrogen). A binding assay for this cell line was performed as described above. To test the ability of AITR-Fc fusion protein to bind membrane-bound TL6, pCEP4/TL6 was stably transfected into HEK293 EBNA cells. After selection in the presence of hygromycin, TL6-expressing cells were harvested and incubated with AITR-Fc protein, followed by FITC-conjugated anti-human IgG1 antibody (Southern Biotechnology). The Becton Dickinson FACScan was used for flow cytometry analysis. AITR was identified by searching an EST data base. A full-length cDNA of a clone from a human activated T-cell cDNA library, which is tentatively named AITR (for activation-inducible TNFR family member), encodes a 234-amino acid type I transmembrane protein with a calculated molecular mass of 25 kDa (Fig.1 A). The receptor has a signal peptide (the first 25 amino acids) and a single transmembrane region (amino acids 140–158). When compared with the extracellular domain of other TNFR family members, AITR displays three cysteine-rich pseudorepeats corresponding to the second, third, and fourth TNFR motif, respectively. The first cysteine pseudorepeat contains eight cysteine residues and lacks C4. Therefore, it is unlikely that the canonical pattern of C1-C2, C3-C5, and C4-C6 disulfide bridges exist in this motif. The second pseudorepeat shows some features of the third TNFR motif, but it is atypical in that C5 is not present even though it contains 7 cysteine residues. The third pseudorepeat shows extensive homologies with the fourth pseudorepeat of 4-1BB. The cytoplasmic domain contains acidic amino acids that are highly conserved in the cytoplasmic domains of 4-1BB, CD27, and GITR. Overall, AITR exhibits a high homology (55% identity) to murine GITR (Fig. 1 B), but there is a mismatch in the first cysteine-rich pseudorepeat between GITR and AITR, because the first pseudorepeat of GITR corresponds to the first TNFR cysteine-rich motif (24Nocentini G. Giunchi L. Ronchetti S. Krausz L.T. Bartoli A. Moraca R. Migliorati G. Riccardi C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6216-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). We investigated expression of AITR mRNA in multiple human tissues by Northern blot hybridization (Fig. 1 C). 1.25-kilobase mRNA was detected in lymph node, peripheral blood leukocytes, and, weakly, in spleen. We also tested a variety of tumor cell lines for expression of AITR mRNA (Fig. 1 C). A 1.25-kilobase message was detected only in the colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line, SW480, among the cell lines tested. The expression of virtually all members of the TNFR superfamily is enhanced by antigen stimulation/lymphocyte activation (1Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, AITR expression was up-regulated in PBMC after stimulation. No AITR message was detectable in unstimulated PBMC when we used a sensitive RT-PCR method (Fig. 1 C). AITR expression was clearly induced within 24 h by typical PBMC stimulation such as treatment with PMA plus ionomycin or soluble anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 mAbs. FACS analysis for AITR expression, however, showed that a small population of activated PBMC expressed AITR on the cell surface at 48 h after stimulation, suggesting that a prolonged period of stimulation is required for maximum expression of AITR. 2B. Kwon, unpublished data. Expression of AITR was not induced by treatment with dexamethasone. This property was different from that of GITR (24Nocentini G. Giunchi L. Ronchetti S. Krausz L.T. Bartoli A. Moraca R. Migliorati G. Riccardi C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6216-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that 4-1BB molecules associate with TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF3 (27Arch R.H. Thompson C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 558-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Jang I.K.

Because the cytoplasmic domain of AITR is similar to that of 4-1BB, we tested its ability to co-precipitate five of the six known TRAFs that were overexpressed in HEK293 EBNA cells. We observed an interaction of AITR with TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF3 but not with TRAF5 and TRAF6 (Fig.2 A). The association of AITR with TRAF2 suggested that, like other members of the TNFR superfamily (27Arch R.H. Thompson C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 558-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Jang I.K.

A. 1996; 94: 2460-2465Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar), AITR might mediate NF-κB activation through TRAF2. To test this possibility, we used an NF-κB reporter system in HEK293 EBNA cells (31Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1421-1427Crossref Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Co-transfection with the AITR expression vector typically induced greater than 3-fold higher luciferase activity when compared with the vector transfection control (Fig. 2, B andC). When co-expressed with TRAF2, AITR induced greater luciferase activity than did TRAF2 alone (Fig. 2, B andC). More importantly, overexpression of dominant-negative TRAF2, which lacked the RING and zinc finger motifs (31Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1421-1427Crossref Scopus (977) Google Scholar), abrogated the luciferase activity induced by AITR (Fig. 2 B). This indicates that TRAF2 is an important mediator of NF-κB activation for AITR. A similar observation was made when we blocked the activity of NIK, which was thought to lie downstream of TRAF2 in the NF-κB signaling pathway, by overexpression of the dominant-negative NIK (36Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), which lacked the two lysine residues of the catalytic domain (Fig.2 B). Taken together, these data indicate that AITR mediates NF-κB activation through the TRAF2/NIK pathway. Since TRAF1 and TRAF3 were found to associate with AITR in HEK293 EBNA cells, we examined the effects of TRAF1 and TRAF3 on NF-κB activation induced by AITR. As shown in Fig. 2 C, introduction of TRAF3 nearly abolished the luciferase activity induced by AITR overexpression. To a lesser extent, TRAF1 overexpression diminished AITR-induced NF-κB activation. These data suggest that TRAF1 and especially TRAF3 down-regulate AITR-induced NF-κB activation. To identify AITRL, we screened a panel of Flag-tagged candidate TNF ligand proteins for binding to AITR-Fc fusion protein by immunoprecipitation. AITR-Fc selectively bound TL6-Flag among Flag-tagged TNF ligand proteins tested (Fig.3 A). In our experimental conditions, 4-1BB and TR2 (HVEM) bound their cognate ligands, 4-1BBL and LIGHT (38Mauri D.N. Ebner R. Montgomery R.I. Kochel K.D. Cheng T.C. Yu G.L. Reben S. Murphy M. Eisenberg R.J. Cohen G.H. Spear P.G. Ware C.F. Immunity. 1998; 8: 21-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), respectively (data not shown). Furthermore, our data clearly showed that TL6-Flag protein bound AITR transiently expressed on the cell surface of HEK293 EBNA cells and AITR constitutively expressed on the cell surface of Jurkat cell (Fig. 3 B,upper and middle panels, respectively). Since TL6 is a transmembrane protein (see below), we used flow cytometry to determine whether AITR-Fc fusion protein was able to bind HEK293 EBNA cells that were stably transfected with full-length TL6. We found that AITR-Fc protein was capable of binding TL6 expressed on HEK293 EBNA cells (Fig. 3 B, lower panel). Next, we tested whether interactions between AITR and TL6 would result in NF-κB activation. In an NF-κB reporter assay, ligand-dependent NF-κB activation was demonstrated by co-transfecting transmembrane TL6 with AITR (data not shown) or transfecting TL6-expressing HEK293 EBNA cells (Fig. 3 C). In addition, when AITR was transiently transfected into HEK293 EBNA cells, which constitutively secreted soluble TL6 protein, NF-κB activation markedly increased as compared with empty vector-tansfected HEK293 EBNA cells (Fig. 3 C). Similarly, higher NF-κB activation was induced by treating with soluble TL6 protein HEK293 cells that were transiently transfected with AITR (data not shown). This indicates that TL6 is able to trigger AITR-specific activation of NF-κB. It appears that higher induction of NF-κB by TL6 is correlated with a stronger association of AITR with TRAF2 in HEK293 EBNA cells, since stronger association of AITR with TRAF2 was observed in cells that were co-transfected with TL6 than in cells that were transfected with AITR alone.2 TL6 was one of the TNF ligand proteins initially identified by an EST data base search. Hydrophilicity analysis of a full-length TL6 clone from a brain cDNA library predicts a single hydrophobic transmembrane domain and the absence of a signal sequence (Fig.4 A). TL6 contains two potential glycosylation sites in the C-terminal region. These features suggest that TL6 is a type II membrane protein with the C-terminal region extracellular. Northern blot analysis of human tissue RNAs revealed expression of a single 2.4-kilobase TL6 mRNA in pancreas (Fig. 4 B). Various human cell lines and PBMC were also examined for TL6 expression. No message was detectable in either unstimulated or stimulated T-cell lines (CEM-6 and Jurkat), B-cell lines (Priess and Frev), promyelocytic cell line (HL-60), monocytic cell line (THP-1), and PBMC by RT-PCR (data not shown). In contrast, HUVEC cells constitutively expressed TL6, and its expression was up-regulated after stimulation with LPS (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, it is speculated that AITR and its ligand are important for interactions between activated T lymphocytes and blood vessels. AITR has 55% identity with murine GITR at the amino acid level. The high sequence conservation between human and mouse provides evidence that AITR is the human homologue of murine GITR. At this point, however, the possibility remains that these two receptors may serve distinct functions from one another, based on the following facts. 1) There is a mismatch in the first cysteine-rich pseudorepeat between GITR and AITR; 2) in contrast to GITR, AITR is not inducible by dexamethasone. In summary, we have identified a novel protein of the TNFR superfamily, AITR, which activates NF-κB through a TRAF2-mediated mechanism. Expression of AITR is activation-inducible. The ligand for AITR is a member of the TNF ligand family and is constitutively expressed in an endothelial cell line. This indicates that AITR and its ligand may be involved in activated T cell trafficking. We thank Sister Mary Etta Kiefer and Pat Mantel for editing the manuscript."

Although the hMLH1 protein has been found to copurify with another MMR protein hPMS2 as a heterodimer, their function in MMR is unknown. In this study, we have identified the physical interaction regions of both hMLH1 with hPMS2. We then examined the effects of hMLH1 missense alterations found in HNPCC kindreds for their interaction with hPMS2. Four of these missense alterations (L574P, K616Δ, R659P, and A681T) displayed >95% reduction in binding to hPMS2. Two additional missense alterations (K618A and K618T) displayed a >85% reduction in binding to hPMS2, whereas three missense alterations (S44F, V506A, and E578G) displayed 25–65% reduction in binding to hPMS2. Interestingly, two HNPCC missense alterations (Q542L and L582V) contained within the consensus interaction region displayed no effect on interaction with hPMS2, suggesting that they may affect other functions of hMLH1. These data confirm that functional deficiencies in the interaction of hMLH1 with hPMS2 are associated with HNPCC as well as suggest that other unknown functional alteration of the human MutL homologues may lead to tumorigenesis in HNPCC kindreds.

Mismatch repair is characterized by the recognition and repair of mispaired nucleotides that may arise from misincorporation during DNA replication, recombination between DNA lacking perfect homology, and physical damage to DNA such as deamination of a methylated cytosine (1Friedberg E.C.

The mutL gene was first identified in the enteric bacteria Salmonella typhimuriumLT7 as a mutator (mutator LT7 or MutL) (5Demerec M. Lahr E.L. Miyake T. Galehran E. Balbinder E. Baric S. Hashimoto K.

The MutL protein was purified based on its ability to complement E. coli mutL extracts for mismatch repair (7Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although a specific biochemical function has not yet been identified for MutL, it does appear to interact with the mismatch recognition protein MutS (7Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leading to subsequent activation of the endonucleolytic activity of MutH (8Welsh K.M. Lu A.L. Clark S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15624-15629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which initiates excision repair by introducing a strand scission on the unmodified strand of hemimethylated GATC sequences (9Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). This mechanism of methyl-directed mismatch repair appears to be unique to Gram-negative bacteria, because homologues of MutH have not been found in either Gram-positive bacteria or eukaryotes. The gene coding for MutL has been highly conserved throughout evolution (for review, see Refs. 10Fishel R. Wilson T. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Homologous genes have been found in a number of organisms including the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae where there are at least fourMutLhomologues (MLH): MLH1, MLH2, MLH3, and PMS1 (Post MeioticSegregation) (Ref. 11Kolodner R.

Unfortunately the nomenclature has become complicated. Although human hMLH1 is most closely related to yeast MLH1, the human hPMS1 appears most closely related to yeast MLH2 and/or MLH3, and human hPMS2 is most closely related to yeast PMS1. Both genetic and biochemical evidence have suggested that the S. cerevisiae MLH1 and PMS1 form a heterodimer, and both genes have been shown to be essential for MMR (14Prolla T.A. Christie D.-M.

Copurification of the human hMLH1-hPMS2, based on its ability to complement MMR in extracts derived from a cell line that was genetically deficient for hMLH1, has confirmed the evolutionary conservation of this heterodimer (16Li G.-M.

Germline mutations in hMSH2 (humanMutS homologue) and hMLH1 account for approximately 70% of the HNPCC kindreds (20Peltomaki P. Vasen H.F. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1146-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Mutations in the other MMR genes hPMS1, hPMS2, and hMSH6 appear rare; however, they have been reported in a few atypical families (13Nicolaides N.C. Papadopoulos N. Liu B. Wei Y.F. Carter K.C.

Biochemical characterization and structure/function analysis of the MMR proteins has contributed to our understanding of their contribution(s) to hereditary and sporadic carcinogenesis. In S. cerevisiae, an interaction region between MLH1 and PMS1 was localized to the carboxyl termini of both proteins using a two-hybrid in vivoassay system (21Pang Q. Prolla T.A. Liskay R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4465-4473Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In this study, we have localized the biochemical interaction region of hMLH1 and hPMS2 to similar, but not identical, carboxyl-terminal regions of both proteins. We found that the interaction region of hMLH1 lies between amino acids 506 and 675, whereas the interaction region of hPMS2 lies between amino acids 675 and 850. To evaluate the biochemical interactions of hMLH1 mutations found in HNPCC in vitro, we constructed several derivatives of the hMLH1 protein that contained mutations previously reported to cosegregate with cancer susceptibility. We found that the L574P, K616Δ, K618A, K618T, R659P, and A681T missense mutations of hMLH1 displayed a >80% loss of interaction with hPMS2, whereas the S44F, V506A, and E578G missense mutations displayed a 20–80% reduction in interaction with hPMS2. Two missense alterations (Q542L and L582V) showed no reduction in hPMS2 interaction, and one of those (Q542L) was also found to have no effect in the dominant mutator assay (22Shimodaira H. Filosi N. Shibata H. Suzuki T. Radice P. Kanamaru R. Friend S.H. Kolodner R.D. Ishioka C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These data indicate that loss or reduced interaction between hMLH1 and hPMS2 may play a causative role in the development of HNPCC. However, other as yet undefined functional alterations also appear to contribute to cancer susceptibility. These data are largely consistent with anin vivo dominant mutator assay developed in yeast that was used to examine mutations of hMLH1 found in HNPCC (22Shimodaira H. Filosi N. Shibata H. Suzuki T. Radice P. Kanamaru R. Friend S.H. Kolodner R.D. Ishioka C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). PCR reaction were performed using the High Fidelity PCR kit from Boehringer Mannheim. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) 3948 nucleic acid synthesis and purification system. DNA plasmid constructs were purified using Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) DNA purification kits. In vitro transcription and translation (IVTT) reactions were performed using the Promega (Madison, WI) TNT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Radiolabeled [35S]methionine used to label proteins was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Glutathione-linked agarose beads were purchased from Sigma. Tris-HCl, NaCl, Tween 20, and dithiothreitol were purchased form Amresco (Solon, OH). All other reagents used were of the highest quality commercially available. The cloning of hMLH1 and hPMS2 has been previously described (12Bronner C.E. Baker S.M. Morrison P.T. Warren G. Smith L.G. Lescoe M.K. Kane M. Earabino C. Lipford J. Lindblom A. Tannergard P. Bollag R.J. Godwin A.R. Ward D.C. Nordenskjeld M. Fishel R. Kolodner R. Liskay R. Nature. 1994; 368: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). Both hMLH1 and hPMS2 were subcloned into pET-29a using NdeI and BamHI. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were made using the pGEX system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For ease of subcloning, pGEX-4T-2 was modified as follows. 1) The vector DNA was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and gel purified, and 2) the following linker was introduced by ligation (top strand, 5′-GAT CCG AGA ACC TGT ACT TCC AGG GAC ATA TGG CCA TGG GTA CCG-3′; bottom strand, 5′-AAT TCG GTA CCC ATG GCC ATA TGT CCC TGG AAG TAC AGG TTC TCG-3′); this vector is referred to as pGEX-SG1 and allows for subcloning using NdeI and NcoI restriction endonuclease sites in which the ATG initiation codon is in-frame with the GST moiety. This vector also contains a TEV protease site just upstream of the NdeI and NcoI sites. AnNdeI restriction site (CATATG) was introduced into both hMLH1 and hPMS2 at the initiator ATG by a method that was similar to the introduction of an NcoI site in hMSH2 (23Fishel R. Ewel A. Lescoe M.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5539-5542PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kallal L. Kurjan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2897-2907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pGEX-hMLH1 and pGEX-hPMS2 were constructed by digesting the pGEX-SG1 and the pET29a constructs of hMLH1 and hPMS2 with NdeI andNotI and ligating the genes into the vector. The hMLH1 deletion mutants were constructed using PCR truncation mutagenesis. Forward primers were designed by using a codon that had a guanine in the first position and adding the next 17 nucleotides to the following sequence; 5′-GCG GAT CCC ATG G-3′. The reverse primers were designed by adding the first 18 nucleotides of the complementary strand to the following sequence; 5′-GGC ATA CTC GAG CTA-3′. Using a forward and reverse primer, a PCR reaction was performed using pET-hMLH1 as template. The PCR product and pET-24d were digested withNcoI and XhoI, gel-purified, and ligated together. The hPMS2 deletion mutants were constructed in the same manner. The forward primers were designed by using a codon with a guanine in the first position and adding the next 18 nucleotides to the following sequence: 5′-GGC TAC GGT CTC CAT ATG-3′. Reverse primers were designed by adding the first 18 nucleotides of the complementary strand to the following sequence: 5′-CGC GGA GGA TCC CTA-3′. The PCR product and pET-29a were digested with NdeI and BamHI, gel purified, and ligated together. All of these constructs were sequenced in their entirety (ABI377) to eliminate possible PCR mutagenesis. The HNPCC mutants of hMLH1 were constructed by overlapping PCR using primers containing the required mutation (24Kallal L. Kurjan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2897-2907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR products were gel-purified and ligated into bluescript-hMLH1. These constructs were sequenced to verify mutagenesis and then subcloned into pET-29a. The pET constructs were then sequenced in their entirety to eliminate the possibility of second site mutations. An overnight culture of pGEX-hPMS2 or pGEX-hMLH1 was grown in LB medium with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. 50 ml of LB with ampicillin was inoculated with 1 ml overnight culture and grown to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.5. Isopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm and placed in a shaker at 30 °C for 2 h. Induced cells were pelleted and resuspended in 800 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (Boehringer Mannheim) plus protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.8 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.8 mg/ml pepstatin, and 0.1 mm EDTA). Lysozyme was added to a concentration of 1 mg/ml and left on ice for 30 min. Triton X-100 and dithiothreitol were then added to final concentrations of 0.2% and 2 mm, respectively, and the lysate was frozen and thawed two times to completely lyse the cells. DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) was added to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml, and the lysate was incubated on ice for 20 min. Cell debris was cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in a refrigerated Eppendorf (Model 5402) centrifuge for 30 min. and the supernatant was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube with rehydrated GST beads such that approximately 10–50 ng of protein were bound to each 25 μl of beads (see below for quantification of GST fusion protein levels). The lysate/GST beads were incubated at 4 °C on a rocking platform. After rocking at 4 °C for 1–2 h, the lysate/GST beads were spun at 1,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 30 s, the supernatant was removed, and the beads were gently resuspended in 500 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.75 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.8 mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.8 mg/ml pepstatin). The centrifugation/resuspension was repeated three times to wash the beads free of most nonspecific lysate proteins. The slurry was then added to a 14-ml sterile polypropylene tube, diluted with binding buffer to approximately 50 μl of packed glutathione beads/ml and incubated at 4 °C on a rocking platform for 30 min to allow bovine serum albumin to coat the beads. 500 μl (10–50 ng of bound GST fusion protein) of these coated GST fusion protein-associated glutathione beads was then aliquoted into 1.5-ml Microcentrifuge tubes. GST fusion protein expression levels were determined by binding the lysate to glutathione beads (as above), followed by 3× wash and quantification of protein on Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels using bovine serum albumin as a standard (14Prolla T.A. Christie D.-M. Liskay R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 407-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IVTT (Promega) Reactions with [35S]methionine were performed with pET-hPMS2 or pET-hMLH1 using purified DNA (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. IVTT reactions were prerun to determine the relative molar concentration of each construct. This was calculated using the specific activity of the [35S]methionine, correcting for the number of methionines in each IVTT construct and using SDS-PAGE and a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software (Sunnyvale, CA) to quantitate labeled peptide. Up to 10 μl of the IVTT protein was added to each tube such that each sample had relative equimolar concentrations of IVTT protein. An IVTT reaction that used pET24d as the vector was added to normalize the total amount of IVTT buffer/reaction mixture in each tube. They were incubated for at least 1 h at 4 °C on a rocker. The beads were washed three times with the binding buffer and then resuspended in 50 μl of SDS loading buffer (0.25 Tris, pH 6.8, 5% sucrose, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.005% bromphenol blue). The samples were resolved on an SDS-PAGE and then imaged using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The GST-IVTT interaction assay system is not absolutely quantitative and is likely to depend on the relative association constant (k assoc) of the individual hMLH1 mutant proteins with hPMS2. Thus, subtle changes in the relative concentration of interacting peptides may influence the ultimate measure of interaction. To provide modest control between experiments for such concentration-dependent processes, we determined the approximate molar concentrations of the GST fusion protein and the IVTT protein (see “Materials and Methods” above), and each interaction experiment was designed to contain a nearly identical ratio of the test peptides. Relative interaction (Intrel) with hPMS2 by each missense mutant hMLH1 protein was determined as the fraction of the mutant interaction ratio (IRm) divided by the wild type interaction ratio (IRwt). Intrel = IRm/IRwt. The mutant interaction ratio IRm was determined by quantitating the amount of interacting peptide (Molecular Dynamic PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software) and dividing this number by the quantitated amount of pre-experiment IVTT-expressed protein (Molecular Dynamic PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software). This quantitation was determined (as above) for each experiment which a priori contains all of the mutant proteins to be tested as well as the wild type protein control on a single SDS-PAGE gel. The wild type interaction ratio (IRwt) was calculated similarly by quantifying the amount of wild type IVTT protein precipitated in an interaction experiment and dividing it by the IVTT expression control. In this way, each interaction precipitation was normalized to the amount of protein expressed by IVTT and introduced into the interaction experiment. Results are presented as the mean and S.D. of four separate experiments. These statistical methods would appear make the GST-IVTT assay system semiquantitative in nature. The hMLH1 and hPMS2 proteins were purified as a stable heterodimer based on complementation of MMR in a human hMLH1-deficient cell extract (16Li G.-M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). To map the interaction region(s) between these proteins, we developed an assay that relies on the use of a GST fusion protein expressed inE. coli as a “bait” and in vitro transcribed and translated (IVTT) protein as “prey.” This assay proved to be effective for all of the combinations that would be necessary for this study; GST-hPMS2::IVTT-hMLH1 (Fig.1 A) and GST-hMLH1::IVTT-hPMS2 (Fig. 1 B). The interaction for each of these IVTT full-length peptides was specific for the GST fusion proteins because we observed nearly undetectable nonspecific background binding as demonstrated by incubation and centrifugal precipitation of the IVTT-expressed protein with the glutathione beads alone, E. coli lysate + glutathione beads, and pGEX (the GST moiety alone) + glutathione beads as controls (Fig. 1, 2nd and 4th lanes). Furthermore, densitometric comparison of the pGEX (only)lane with the GST fusion (either hMLH1 or hPMS2)lane demonstrated that the signal to background ratio in this assay approaches 200-fold. These results suggested that this bait-prey system was sufficient to map the interaction region(s) of the hMLH1-hPMS2 heterodimer. Using the GST-IVTT assay, we mapped the interaction domain of hMLH1 with hPMS2 (Fig. 2). In each experiment, a comparison between pairs of signals obtained when IVTT-hMLH1 peptide is added to the GST vector alone versus the GST-hPMS2 fusion is required to determine relevant interaction. Amino acid residues 1–500 of hMLH1 did not appear to significantly interact with GST-hPMS2 (Fig. 2, pairs 2, 4, and 5). However, significant interaction was identified in the carboxyl terminus of the MLH1 protein (amino acids 253–756: Fig. 2, pairs 3 and6). This apparent interaction region was further resolved by truncating this carboxyl-terminal interaction fragment in 25 amino acid increments. We found that amino acid residues 506–756 of hMLH1 interacted with GST-hPMS2, whereas hMLH1 amino acid residues 531–756 showed no detectable interaction (Fig. 2; pairs 6 and7, respectively). Furthermore, hMLH1 amino acid residues 410–675 displayed interaction with GST-hPMS2, whereas hMLH1 amino acid residues 410–650 did not (Fig. 2; pairs 8 and 9, respectively). These results suggest that the most significant hPMS2 interaction region of hMLH1 is located between amino acid residues 506 and 675. It is worth noting that there is a significantly reduced interaction with hPMS2 when one compares hMLH1 amino acid residues 506–756 with hMLH1 amino acid residues 410–675. These results suggest that the interaction region of hMLH1 with hPMS2 may extend the carboxyl terminus from amino acid residue 675. We also determined the interaction domain of hPMS2 with hMLH1 (Fig.3). As suggested above, a comparison between pairs of signals obtained when IVTT-hPMS2 peptide was added to the GST vector alone versus the GST-hMLH1 fusion is required to determine relevant interaction. The first 600-amino acid residues of hPMS2 did not display significant binding to GST-hMLH1 (Fig. 3; pairs2, 4, and 5). In contrast, amino acid residues 602–862 of hPMS2 appeared sufficient to bind GST-hMLH1 (Fig.3; pair 6). Using the truncation strategy described above as a mechanism to resolve the interaction region, we found that amino acid residues 675–862 of hPMS2 bound to GST-hMLH1 (Fig. 3; pair7) and that the interaction was lost with truncation of 25 amino acid residues (amino acids 700–862: Fig. 3; pair 8). Similarly, amino acid residues 675–850 of hPMS2 interacted with GST-hMLH1 (Fig. 3; pair 9), and the interaction was lost with truncation of 25 amino acid residues (amino acids 675–825: Fig.3, pair 10). These results suggest that the hMLH1 interaction region of hPMS2 is located between amino acid residues 675 and 850. Several missense mutations of hMLH1 have been reported to cosegregate with HNPCC and are found to be within the region of hMLH1 that we had determined to interact with hPMS2 (20Peltomaki P. Vasen H.F. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1146-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). As a first step in determining the functional consequences of these alterations, we have examined hMLH1 containing the V506A, Q542L, L574P, E578G, L582V, K616Δ, K618A, K618T, R659P, and A681T missense mutations for their interaction with hPMS2. We also tested the S44F mutation, because alteration of the homologous residue in S. cerevisiae has been reported to effect the interaction of yeast Mlh1p with Pms1p (21Pang Q. Prolla T.A. Liskay R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4465-4473Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In each of four separate experiments, we determined the relative IVTT protein expression (Fig. 4 A) and exposed equivalent molar quantities of IVTT protein to identical quantities of GST-hPMS1 for each interaction pair under study. To rule out selective degradation of mutant proteins, we assessed the stability of the missense mutant proteins in the glutathione agarose-GST-lysate by incubating the IVTT proteins for 5 h under interaction conditions (a normal interaction incubation is 1 h) and then resolving an aliquot by SDS-PAGE. We found no detectable degradation of the mutant peptides during this 5-fold-longer incubation period (data not shown). Interestingly, this lack of degradation could be demonstrated for the full-length protein as well as the numerous internal-start peptides that constitute the bulk of the background lower molecular weight material. Thus, it is unlikely that any reduction in interaction with hPMS2 is because of either altered expression levels or decreased stability of the mutated proteins. Initial experiments suggested that several of the hMLH1 missense mutant proteins might display subtle alterations in binding to hPMS2. To substantiate this comparison, we developed a semiquantitative measurement of hMLH1 interaction with hPMS2 (see “Materials and Methods”). A representative experiment is shown in Fig.4 B. Six of the hMLH1 missense mutant proteins (L574P, K616Δ, K618A, K618T, R659P, and A681T) showed >85% reduction in their interaction with hPMS2. The S44F, E578G, and V506A MLH1 missense mutant proteins displayed 25–65% of that observed with wild type interaction with hPMS2 (26.5 ± 7.1%, 54.9 ± 9.2%, and 65.7 ± 10.9%, respectively). Two hMLH1 missense mutant proteins, Q542L and L582V, appeared to have little effect on interaction with hPMS2 (102.5 ± 2.7% and 101.5 ± 30% of wild type interaction, respectively). It is interesting to note that two different hMLH1 missense mutations at residue 618 (K618A and K618T) had nearly identical effects on their interaction with hPMS2 (11.8 ± 2.5% and 5.3 ± 1.3% of wild type, respectively), thus reducing the likelihood that the altered interactions observed were artificial. Mutations in the human MutL homolog, hMLH1, appear to account for approximately 35% of HNPCC patients (20Peltomaki P. Vasen H.F. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1146-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The hMLH1 protein was purified as a heterodimer with hPMS2 protein by biochemical complementation of MMR in an hMLH1-deficient cell extract (16Li G.-M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Although the role of the hMLH1-hPMS2 heterodimer in MMR has not been elucidated, it is believed to be an integral component of the MMR machinery. These observations suggested that a disruption of the hMLH1-hPMS2 heterodimer might block the process of MMR and manifest itself as HNPCC. To test whether disruption of hMLH1 and hPMS2 interaction could be a cause of cancer susceptibility in HNPCC, we first mapped the interaction region(s) of hMLH1 and hPMS2. We found that this interaction was confined to a single region located in the carboxyl terminus of both proteins. This observation is similar to that reported for the respective homologues (MLH1 and PMS1) in S. cerevisiae. Comparison of the data presented here and similar studies with the yeast homologues suggest that these heterodimers interact through similar regions on each of these proteins. A summary of the hMLH1 and hPMS2 interaction regions is detailed in Fig.5. Interestingly, sequence comparison of the five known MLH1 homologues does not reveal significant conserved homology within the interaction region (15% identity; 38/250 amino acids). However, sequence comparison of the five PMS1 (PMS2) homologues (excluding hPMS1, which is largely nonhomologous) reveals significant homology within the consensus interaction region (35% identity; 61/175 amino acids). We found a strong correlation between HNPCC mutations and a loss of hMLH1 interaction with hPMS2. We tested 11 hMLH1 missense alterations reported in HNPCC kindreds and located in the consensus interaction domain of hMLH1. Nine of these missense alterations displayed reduced interaction with hPMS2. Four of these alterations (L574P, K616D, R659P, and A681T) displayed nearly undetectable interaction with hPMS2 (>99%), whereas two alterations (K618A and K618T) displayed a significant loss of interaction (>85%). Because gross alteration of protein structure can not be eliminated and is likely to be functionally significant for several of these missense mutations, our observations with the K618T and K618A alterations provide significant foundation for the idea that protein structure is not the only contributor to heterodimer protein interaction. This notion is underlined by the observation that the K616Δ alteration (which is located in the first of three lysine residues that includes Lys-618) displays nearly undetectable interaction. Thus, it is appears possible that one or all three of these lysine residues form a charge-based contact between hMLH1 and hPMS2. Although the S44F alteration of hMLH1 was found to be outside of the consensus hPMS2 interaction region, we tested this missense alteration in our system because the homologous alteration in S. cerevisiae displayed reduced interaction with PMS1 (21Pang Q. Prolla T.A. Liskay R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4465-4473Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We found a reproducible reduction in the ability of S44F hMLH1 to interact with hPMS2 (26.5% of wild type). We consider three possibilities. 1) The GST-IVTT assay for mapping these regions may have failed to detect a possible interaction domain at the amino terminus of hMLH1, where the fusion is located, 2) the S44 amino acid may be in close spatial proximity to the consensus hPMS2 interaction region, or 3) substitution of Ser-44 with a phenylalanine gravely disrupts the protein structure such that the downstream interaction region is largely affected. The V506A and E578G hMLH1 missense alterations, both, appeared to display consistent reduced binding to hPMS2. Although it is still possible that these alterations do not alter interaction with hPMS2in vivo, it is interesting to note that a functional defect has been confirmed for these alterations using a yeast dominant mutator assay that would appear to depend on similar protein-protein interactions (22Shimodaira H. Filosi N. Shibata H. Suzuki T. Radice P. Kanamaru R. Friend S.H. Kolodner R.D. Ishioka C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Two hMLH1 missense alterations, Q542L and L582V, did not appear to affect interaction with hPMS2. These alterations have been reportedly identified in patients meeting the Amsterdam criteria for HNPCC (25Vasen H.F. Mecklin J.P. Khan P.M. Lynch H.T. Dis. Colon Rectum. 1991; 34: 424-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar,26Han H.J. Maruyama M. Baba S. Park J.G. Nakamura Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We can not rule out the possibility that an altered interaction by these amino acid changes is obscured by the amino-terminal GST fusion of these constructs. However, more provocative possibilities are that the Q542L and L582V may be either nonfunctional polymorphisms or that these alterations affect a function of the hMLH1 protein other than interaction with hPMS2. Interestingly, the Q542L missense alteration has no effect in an independent yeast dominant mutator assay system (22Shimodaira H. Filosi N. Shibata H. Suzuki T. Radice P. Kanamaru R. Friend S.H. Kolodner R.D. Ishioka C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Because these alterations are reportedly from well defined HNPCC kindreds, these results appear to support the notion that there are other functional alterations of the human MutL homologues that may contribute to cancer susceptibility. The 11 hMLH1 proteins containing missense alterations appear to establish a strong link between HNPCC and loss of interaction with hPMS2. It is interesting to note that there have been no reports of single-amino acid substitutions in hPMS2, which are located in the hMLH1 interaction domain. This observation may suggest that there is another molecular partner for hMLH1 that has a redundant function with hPMS2 (similar to the findings with hMSH3 and hMSH6). hPMS1 could be a candidate for this role. We have previously identified the interaction domains of hMSH2 with hMSH3 and hMSH2 with hMSH6 (27Guerrette S. Wilson T. Gradia S. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6616-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, we found no effect of missense alterations found in HNPCC kindreds on the interaction with either hMSH3 and hMSH6. This observation suggested that alteration of a static interaction between hMSH2 with hMSH3 or hMSH6 was unlikely to play a causative role in HNPCC. Here we confirm the correlation between altered interaction between hMLH1 and hPMS2 and susceptibility to HNPCC.

Recently, we found that UV irradiation of human skin leads to inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in keratinocytes and endothelial cells (ECs). We have now searched for the role of iNOS expression and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in UVA-induced apoptosis as detected by DNA-specific fluorochrome labeling and in DNA fragmentation visualized by in situ nick translation in ECs. Activation with proinflammatory cytokines 24 h before UVA exposure leading to iNOS expression and endogenous NO synthesis fully protects ECs from the onset of apoptosis. This protection was completely abolished in the presence of the iNOS inhibitorl-N 5-(1-iminoethyl)-ornithine (0.25 mm). Additionally, preincubation of cells with the NO donor (Z)-1-[N(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate at concentrations from 10 to 1000 μm as an exogenous NO-generating source before UVA irradiation led to a dose-dependent inhibition of both DNA strand breaks and apoptosis. In search of the molecular mechanism responsible for the protective effect, we find that protection from UVA-induced apoptosis is tightly correlated with NO-mediated increases in Bcl-2 expression and a concomitant inhibition of UVA-induced overexpression of Bax protein. In conclusion, we present evidence for a protective role of iNOS-derived NO in skin biology, because NO either endogenously produced or exogenously applied fully protects against UVA-induced cell damage and death. We also show that the NO-mediated expression modulation of proteins of the Bcl-2 family, an event upstream of caspase activation, appears to be the molecular mechanism underlying this protection."
https://openalex.org/W2054999062,"The modulation of presynaptic calcium channel activity by second messengers provides a fine tuning mechanism for neurotransmitter release. In neurons, the activation of certain G protein-coupled receptors reduces N-type channel activity by ∼60%. In contrast, activation of protein kinase C (PKC) results in an approximately 50% increase in N-type channel activity, and subsequent G protein inhibition is antagonized. Here, we describe the molecular determinants that control the dual effects of PKC-dependent phosphorylation. The double substitution of two adjacent PKC consensus sites in the calcium channel domain I-II linker (Thr422, Ser425) to alanines abolished both PKC-dependent up-regulation and the PKC-G protein cross-talk. The single substitution of Ser425 to glutamic acid abolished PKC up-regulation but had no effect on G protein modulation. Replacement of Thr422 with glutamic acid eliminated PKC-dependent up-regulation and mimicked the effects of PKC phosphorylation on G protein inhibition. Our data suggest that Thr422 mediates the antagonistic effect of PKC on G protein modulation, while phosphorylation of either Thr422 or Ser425 are sufficient to increase N-type channel activity. Thus, Thr422 serves as a molecular switch by which PKC is able to simultaneously trigger the up-regulation of channel activity and antagonize G protein inhibition.

Calcium influx through neuronal voltage-dependent calcium channels mediates a range of cytoplasmic responses, such as neurotransmitter release, proliferation, and the activation of calcium-dependent enzymes. Most neurons express multiple calcium channel types with distinct functional properties, and molecular cloning has identified genes encoding at least eight different neuronal calcium channel α1 subunits (termed α1A through α1H). Functional expression in heterologous expression systems has revealed that α1Aencodes for P/Q-type calcium channels (1Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.-S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hofmann F.

The physiological properties of presynaptic calcium channels are extensively modulated by second messenger molecules, including protein kinase C and G protein βγ subunits (17Dunlap K. Fischbach G.D.

The activation of certain G protein-coupled seven-helix transmembrane receptors mediates a pronounced voltage-dependent inhibition of both N-type and P/Q-type calcium currents (Refs. 22Ikeda S.R.

Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 531-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). This inhibition is probably caused by direct 1:1 binding of G protein βγ subunits to the calcium channel α1subunit, resulting in a reluctance of the channels to undergo opening in response to membrane depolarization (27Patil P.G. deLeon M.

A. 1998; 95: 4035-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast, stimulation of protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation results in a substantial up-regulation of N-type channel activity (19Stea A. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Neuron. 1995; 5: 929-940Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (194) Google Scholar). PKC 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. and Gβγmodulation are functionally coupled (termed cross-talk), such that PKC-dependent phosphorylation of the channel antagonizes subsequent G protein inhibition (20Swartz K.J. Merrit A. Bean B.P. Lovinger D.M. Nature. 1993; 361: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 21Swartz K.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 305-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 29Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that cross-talk between G protein and PKC pathways mainly occurs at the level of the calcium channel α1 subunit (29Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In particular, the cytoplasmic linker connecting domains I and II of the α1B subunit is a crucial determinant of both G protein inhibition and PKC-G protein cross-talk. This region has also been implicated in PKC-dependent up-regulation of N-type calcium channels (19Stea A. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Neuron. 1995; 5: 929-940Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (194) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility of a common mechanism underlying the dual effects of protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation. Here, we identify individual amino acid residues within the α1B domain I-II linker that mediate up-regulation by PKC-dependent phosphorylation as well as the cross-talk between PKC and G protein pathways. Using site-directed mutagenesis in combination with functional expression in human embryonic kidney cells, we show that phosphorylation of either threonine 422 or serine 425 is sufficient to mediate PKC-dependent up-regulation of the channel. Whereas the nature of serine 425 does not affect G protein inhibition, substitution of the threonine residue to glutamic acid to create a permanent phosphoform drastically reduces the degree of G protein inhibition. We propose a model whereby threonine 422 acts as a molecular switch by which protein kinase C up-regulates the activity of N-type calcium channels and concomitantly antagonizes their inhibition by G protein βγ subunits. The remaining (∼20%) degree of G protein inhibition is further reduced upon deletion of the 3′ third of the α1B carboxyl terminus, suggesting that the calcium channel domain I-II linker and the carboxyl terminus might cooperatively interact with G protein βγ subunits. DNA encoding wild type α1Bchannels was subcloned into the cytomegalovirus expression vector. The α1B-cytomegalovirus construct was cut withSpeI and SplI, and theSpeI–SplI fragment was then subcloned into a modified pSL1180 Bluescript vector (which had been cut withStuI and SmaI and recircularized to eliminate aKpn2I site in the polylinker). A Kpn2I fragment was excised from this construct and subcloned into a modified pSL1180 vector (in which a NarI–NarI fragment was deleted). Site-directed mutagenesis of PKC consensus sites was carried out on this construct using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutations were confirmed via DNA sequencing. TheKpn2I fragment was subsequently subcloned into theSpeI–SplI construct in pSL1180, and theSpeI–SplI fragment was ligated into the full-length α1B construct in cytomegalovirus. After completion of subcloning, the 900-base pair Kpn2I fragment contained in the full-length sequence was completely sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutations and to eliminate the possibility of cloning and polymerase chain reaction artifacts. A carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant lacking amino acid residues 1955–2336 was constructed by eliminating an XbaI fragment contained between an XbaI site in the α1Bcarboxyl terminus and a second XbaI site in the 3′ portion of the polylinker of the cytomegalovirus expression vector. The construct was cut with XbaI and recircularized, and the successful elimination of the XbaI fragment was confirmed via enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. Human embryonic kidney TSA 201 cells were grown in standard Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.4 mg/ml neomycin. The cells were grown to 85% confluency, split with trypsin EDTA, and plated on glass coverslips at 10% confluency 12 h prior to transfection. Immediately prior to transfection, the medium was replaced, and the cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding for calcium channel α1B, β1b, and α2 subunits (at a 1:1:1 molar ratio) using a standard calcium phosphate protocol. After 12 h, the medium was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the cells were allowed to recover for 12 h. Subsequently, the cells were incubated at 28 °C in 5% CO2 for 1–2 days prior to recording. Immediately prior to recording, individual coverslips were transferred to a 3-cm culture dish containing recording solution composed of 20 mmBaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 40 mm triethanolamine chloride, 10 mm glucose, 65 mm CsCl (pH 7.2). Whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) linked to a personal computer equipped with pCLAMP version 6.0. Patch pipettes (Sutter borosilicate glass; BF150–86-15) were pulled using a Sutter P-87 microelectrode puller, fire-polished using a Narashige microforge, and showed typical resistances of 2–3 megaohms. The internal pipette solution contained 105 mm CsCl, 25 mm triethanolamine chloride, 1 mm CaCl2, 11 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), supplemented with nystatin. Nystatin was dissolved in Me2SO at 100 mg/ml and diluted directly into the pipette solution. After seal formation, nystatin was allowed to equilibrate into the patch for 5–10 min to permit electrical access. Currents were typically elicited from a holding potential of −100 mV to various test potentials using Clampex software (Axon Instruments). Current-voltage relations were generated by utilizing a ramp protocol (dV/dt = 1 mV/ms) as reported previously (30Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Snutch T.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Somatostatin (RBI Chemicals) was dissolved in water to give a stock solution of 1 mm, and PMA (RBI) was dissolved in Me2SO at a stock concentration of 2 mm. These compounds were diluted into the external recording solution at the appropriate final concentrations and perfused directly onto the cell using a gravity-driven microperfusion system. At the applicable concentrations, Me2SO by itself had no effect on calcium channel activity. In every case, peak current inhibition was assessed 15 s after somatostatin application. Data were filtered at 1 kHz and recorded directly onto the hard drive of the computer. Data were analyzed using Clampfit (Axon Instruments). All curve fitting was carried out in Sigmaplot 4.0 (Jandel Scientific). Unless stated otherwise, all error bars represent S.E. values, numbers in parentheses displayed in thefigures reflect numbers of experiments, and pvalues given reflect Student's t tests. We have previously shown that N-type (α1B + α2δ + β1b) calcium channels transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney cells are reversibly inhibited by 50–70% via activation of endogenous somatostatin receptors (Ref. 29Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar; see Fig.1 C). In contrast, activation of protein kinase C with 100–400 nm of the phorbol ester PMA results in a pronounced (50–60%) up-regulation of α1B N-type currents (Ref. 29Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar; see Fig. 1 D). Subsequent to PMA treatment, inhibition of N-type channel activity by somatostatin is dramatically reduced (see Fig. 1 D), consistent with previous observations in intact neurons (20Swartz K.J. Merrit A. Bean B.P. Lovinger D.M. Nature. 1993; 361: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 21Swartz K.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 305-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides directed against two subregions of the α1B calcium channel domain I-II linker block the modulatory effects of exogenously applied Gβγ subunits (29Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). One of the peptides is a substrate for in vitrophosphorylation by protein kinase C, and when phosphorylated in vitro, it loses the ability to interfere with G protein modulation (29Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). These results suggested that cross-talk between protein kinase C and G protein pathways might occur in this subregion of the α1B domain I-II linker. Two putative protein kinase C consensus sites, Thr422 and Ser425, are contained with this region of the channel (Fig.1, inset). To test whether one or both of these residues might mediate PKC/Gβγ cross-talk, we replaced both sites with alanine residues. Fig. 1 A depicts current records obtained from the double alanine mutant in the absence and the presence of 100 nm somatostatin. Similar to that observed with the wild type channel (Fig. 1), activation of somatostatin receptors mediates a reversible and pronounced inhibition of channel activity, paired with a slowing of activation kinetics and an apparent slowing of inactivation. Fig. 1 B illustrates the effect of PMA on channel activity and on somatostatin modulation of the alanine double mutant. While application of 100 nm PMA had no detectable effect on channel activity, the subsequent application of 100 nm somatostatin produced the same degree of G protein inhibition as that observed in the absence of PMA. Fig. 1, Cand D, illustrates the effect of alanine substitution for a number of experiments. There are two effects evident. First, the alanine mutation per se significantly reduces the degree of somatostatin inhibition seen with the wild type channel from 53 ± 5 to 36 ± 5% (p = 0.02) (Fig. 1 C). Second, while PMA treatment reduced the somatostatin effect for the wild type channel, the somatostatin sensitivity of the double mutant was not altered by PMA (36 ± 5 versus 37 ± 5%,p = 0.86; Fig. 1 C), indicating that cross-talk between PKC and G protein pathways is blocked by the double alanine substitution. In addition, the PMA-induced up-regulation observed with the wild type channels was reduced from 49 ± 14 to 6 ± 5% when both PKC consensus sites were simultaneously replaced with alanines (Fig. 1 D). Thus, the critical structures mediating up-regulation of channel activity and inhibition of direct G protein action appear to reside within overlapping regions of the calcium channel domain I-II linker and contain one or both of Thr422 and Ser425. To elucidate which of the two residues mediate the effects of PKC, we “permanently phosphorylated” either Thr422 or Ser425 by replacing them individually with glutamic acid residues. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the S425E mutant exhibits a somatostatin response comparable with that of the wild type channel (p = 0.41), suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser425 does not antagonize G protein action. PMA treatment had no significant effect on current amplitude (p = 0.83, paired t test; see also Fig.3 B), suggesting that replacing Ser425 with glutamic acid mimics a permanently up-regulated state of the channel. Nonetheless, PMA treatment significantly attenuated the degree of somatostatin inhibition from 46 ± 7 to 15 ± 4% (p = 0.004) (Figs. 2 B and3 A), suggesting that replacement of Ser425 with glutamic acid does not preclude phosphorylation of the adjacent Thr422 residue and that cross-talk between PKC and Gβγ modulation is probably mediated by Thr422 rather than Ser425. If this is correct, then mimicking phosphorylation of Thr422 (i.e.T422E) should reduce the degree of G protein inhibition to those levels observed after PKC phosphorylation of the wild-type channel. This is supported by the current records shown in Fig. 2, C andD, and the data presented in Fig. 3 A. The T422E mutant showed a significantly reduced somatostatin sensitivity, which was comparable in magnitude with that observed with the wild type channel after PMA treatment (WT (with PMA) = 20 ± 5%; T422E (without PMA) = 20 ± 3%, p = 0.91). These data indicate that replacing Thr422 with a negatively charged side group mimics the antagonistic effect of PKC on G protein inhibition. PMA application did not further affect somatostatin sensitivity of T422E (T422E (with PMA) = 14 ± 3%,p = 0.29). Also, PMA failed to increase the peak current amplitude of T422E (p = 0.71) (Figs.2 D and 3 B), suggesting that similar to S425E, the T422E construct is likely be tonically up-regulated. Overall, the data suggest that whereas only Thr422 is capable of mediating the cross-talk effect, phosphorylation of either Ser425 or Thr422 is sufficient to fully up-regulate channel activity.Figure 3A, effect of somatostatin on calcium channel N-type channel activity with or without prior application of 100 nm PMA. The S425E mutant exhibits a somatostatin sensitivity that is not significantly different from that of the wild type channel. With prior application of PMA, the degree of somatostatin inhibition of both the wild type and the S425E mutant is reduced to similar levels. In contrast, even in the absence of PMA, the T422E mutant exhibits a somatostatin sensitivity that parallels that of a PMA-treated wild type channel, and PMA does not further effect somatostatin sensitivity. The holding potential was −100 mV, and the test potential was typically +20 mV. Error barsrepresent S.E. values. B, up-regulation of wild type and mutant channels by 100 nm PMA. Note that the glutamic acid substitution of either Thr422 or Ser425 blocks up-regulation by PMA. Experimental conditions were as described forA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm this hypothesis, we created two additional mutants in which Thr422 and Ser425 were substituted individually by alanines in order to further define the relative contributions of the individual PKC consensus sites to the overall action of PKC. As shown in Fig. 4 A, T422A exhibits a somatostatin sensitivity that closely parallels that seen with the T422A/S425A double mutant shown in Fig. 1. After treatment with 100 nm PMA, the degree of somatostatin inhibition of T422A did not decrease significantly (37 ± 5% (without PMA)versus 32 ± 3% (with PMA), p = 0.42) and remained significantly (p < 0.003) larger than that of the PMA-treated wild type channel (20 ± 5%). These data indicate that cross-talk between PKC and G protein pathways is blocked upon selective removal of the Thr442 PKC substrate. Consistent with this notion, removal of the Ser425 PKC substrate (i.e. S425A) did not significantly change G protein sensitivity (p = 0.49), nor did it affect cross-talk between the G protein and PKC pathways (48 ± 7% (without PMA) versus 18 ± 3% (with PMA),p < 0.002, Fig. 4 A). Both T422A and S425A exhibited a similar degree of PKC-dependent up-regulation (Fig. 4 B), which did not differ significantly from that observed with the wild type channel (p > 0.79). This further supports the notion that N-type channel activity is fully up-regulated upon phosphorylation of either Thr422 or Ser425, whereas only Thr422 is capable of mediating the cross-talk between PKC and G protein pathways. To examine the voltage dependence of the T422E mutant, we utilized a ramp protocol to allow the acquisition of complete current-voltage relations without contamination from receptor desensitization. Fig.5 compares the somatostatin response of wild type channels to that of the T422E mutant at a number of test potentials. In both cases, the effect of somatostatin is dependent on membrane potential and is consistent with the direct inhibition of native N-type calcium channels by G proteins (18Bourinet E. Soong T.W.

As evident from Fig. 5, somatostatin produced a significantly greater inhibition of the wild type channels at all potentials. Although the T422E mutant is capable of undergoing G protein modulation, the voltage dependence of Gβγ dissociation appears be shifted toward more hyperpolarized potentials in the mutant channel. Several studies have implicated the carboxyl terminus in the direct G protein modulation of voltage-dependent calcium channels (33Quin N. Platano Olcese R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8866-8871Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 34Zhang J.F. Ellinor P.T. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1996; 17: 991-1003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the carboxyl terminus contains several putative protein kinase C consensus sites. To examine the possibility that the carboxyl terminus might contribute to the modulation of N-type calcium channels by PKC and G proteins, we examined a deletion mutant in which the last third of the carboxyl terminus of α1B (residues 1955–2336) was deleted (α1BΔCOOH). Fig.6 B depicts a current record obtained with the deletion mutant in the presence and absence of somatostatin. Although somatostatin reduces the peak current amplitude and mediates the slowing of activation kinetics typical of direct Gβγ modulation, the degree of inhibition is reduced compared with the wild type channel (from 53 ± 5% to 32 ± 2%, p = 0.02). In contrast, up-regulation by PMA remains intact (Fig. 6 C and inset), suggesting that the deleted portion of the carboxyl-terminal does not directly mediate PKC-dependent changes in channel activity. Following pretreatment with PMA, somatostatin application resulted in only a small effect on peak current amplitude (4 ± 2% inhibition), at a test potential of +20 mV (Fig. 6 D). Hence, PKC-dependent phosphorylation in combination with deletion of the carboxyl terminus further reduces the degree of Gβγ modulation. To further examine this observation, we deleted the carboxyl-terminal region of the T422E mutant. As seen from Fig. 6 D, this mutant showed only a ∼10% inhibition in response to somatostatin at a test potential of +20 mV. The degree of inhibition did not differ significantly from that seen with mutant T422E after PMA treatment (p = 0.1) but was significantly lower than the sensitivity of the α1BΔCOOH construct (p = 0.025). These data indicate that deletion of the carboxyl terminus and replacement of Thr422 with glutamic acid produce additive effects on G protein sensitivity. This particular construct did not express well in HEK cells, and we were unable to systematically examine the voltage dependence of somatostatin action. Overall, the data suggest that the carboxyl region mediates an important role in stabilizing the Gβγ interaction with the calcium channel α1 subunit, especially when PKC sites in the α1B domain I-II linker are phosphorylated. Whole cell currents of exogenously expressed α1B N-type channels are up-regulated by activation of protein kinase C by either phorbol esters (such as PMA) or activation of coexpressed metabotropic glutamate receptors (19Stea A. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Neuron. 1995; 5: 929-940Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Here, we have used application of 100 nmPMA to stimulate protein kinase C in human embryonic kidney cells expressing α1B channels. Consistent with the results of Stea and co-workers (19Stea A. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Neuron. 1995; 5: 929-940Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (194) Google Scholar), PMA application resulted in a pronounced increase in channel activity for wild type α1B channels that was blocked by pretreatment with staurosporine. In their study, Stea and co-workers (19Stea A. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Neuron. 1995; 5: 929-940Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (194) Google Scholar) were able to confer aspects of PKC sensitivity of α1B onto the less sensitive α1A channels by inserting the domain I-II linker of α1B into α1A. We have previously shown that a fusion protein directed against the α1B I-II linker region is a substrate for PKC-dependent phosphorylation (29Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Two considerations have led us to focus on a pair of PKC consensus sites (Thr422 and Ser425) located within a 20-amino acid stretch (residues 410–428) of the α1B I-II linker. First, this stretch of residues is both a substrate for in vitro phosphorylation by PKC and has also been implicated in the PKC-mediated antagonism of G protein inhibition of wild type α1B channels (29Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Second, certain amino acid substitutions in the vicinity of the corresponding region in α1A increases PKC sensitivity of α1A. 2G. W. Zamponi and T. P. Snutch, unpublished observations. Here, we show that the double substitution of Thr422 and Ser425 for alanines abolishes the PKC-dependent up-regulation of α1B channels, suggesting that phosphorylation of one or both of these residues is sufficient to mediate up-regulation. Individual substitutions of these residues for glutamic acid also precluded the effect of PKC stimulation. In contrast, individual substitution of these two residues for alanines had no adverse effect on PKC-dependent up-regulation. These data imply that the effects of phosphorylation of the two PKC consensus sites are nonadditive and that phosphorylation of either Thr422 or Ser425 is sufficient to mediate complete up-regulation of channel activity in an all or none manner. At present, the molecular mechanisms by which the phosphorylation event affects channel activity remain to be determined. It is possible that phosphorylation induces a conformational change in the domain I-II linker that directly affects activation. Alternatively, phosphorylation of these residues might alter the interaction with the calcium channel β subunit, which in turn may affect channel activation. Such a mechanism would be consistent with data of Stea and co-workers (19Stea A. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Neuron. 1995; 5: 929-940Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (194) Google Scholar), who reported that the calcium channel β subunit is required for PKC-dependent up-regulation. Recently, Shistik et al. (35Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) showed that deletion of N-terminal residues 2–46 abolished PKC-dependent up-regulation of rabbit heart α1C channels expressed inXenopus oocytes. The N-terminal region of rat brain α1B N-type calcium channel is 51 residues shorter than that of the rabbit heart α1C channel and thus lacks the motif identified by Shistik et al. (35Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is no counterpart to Thr422 present in the rabbit heart α1C sequence, and the analog to Ser425(Ser499 in the rabbit heart α1C sequence) is not part of a PKC consensus motif. This suggests that the molecular mechanism underlying the PKC-dependent modulation of N-type calcium channel activity is fundamentally different from that for the rabbit cardiac L-type isoform. Over the past several years, a number of studies have examined the molecular determinants of G protein modulation of presynaptic calcium channels (18Bourinet E. Soong T.W. Stea A. Snutch T.P. Proc.

A. 1997; 94: 1512-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It is now widely accepted that the Gβγ subunits are the active G protein species mediating the antagonistic effect on presynaptic calcium channel activity (28Zamponi G.W. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4035-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 29Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P.

The G protein βγ subunits are able to interact with two separate regions within the calcium channel domain I-II linker (29Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 36DeWaard M. Liu H. Walker D. Scott V.E.S. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). We have previously suggested that the PKC dependent phosphorylation of one of these two I-II linker Gβγ binding motifs might mediate the previously identified antagonistic effect of PKC stimulation on G protein sensitivity (29Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Here, we present further confirmation for the involvement of the domain I-II linker region in direct G protein modulation of N-type calcium channels. Each, the double alanine mutant and the T422E and T422A constructs, exhibited a significantly reduced sensitivity to somatostatin-induced Gβγ modulation. Neither of these substitutions resulted in significant changes in current kinetics or half-activation potential, minimizing the possibility of an indirect effect due to changes in channel gating. We suggest the possibility that these substitutions more likely reduce the affinity of the channel for binding Gβγ. In addition to the domain I-II linker, the carboxyl terminus (33Quin N. Platano Olcese R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8866-8871Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 34Zhang J.F. Ellinor P.T. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1996; 17: 991-1003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) as well as domain I (38Stephens G.J. Canti C. Page K.M. Dolphin A.C. J. Physiol. 1998; 509: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and the amino terminus (39Page K.M. Canti C. Stephens G.J. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the calcium channel α1 subunit have all been implicated in direct G protein modulation. Here, we present corroborating evidence that the carboxyl terminus contributes to a portion of the overall G protein inhibition of N-type channels. A deletion of one-third of the carboxyl-terminal region significantly reduced but did not eliminate the somatostatin-induced inhibition of α1B channels. The deleted portion contains a highly conserved motif that was recently implicated in Gβγ binding to α1E channels (33Quin N. Platano Olcese R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8866-8871Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Together with our results, it appears that while the carboxyl terminus probably contributes to Gβγ binding to N-type calcium channels, the major determinant of G protein action is the domain I-II linker. That the carboxyl terminus contributes to Gβγ binding could account for the observation that α1B or α1E channel constructs containing the α1C I-II linker remain sensitive to G protein inhibition (33Quin N. Platano Olcese R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8866-8871Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 34Zhang J.F. Ellinor P.T. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1996; 17: 991-1003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) 3E. Bourinet, personal communication. despite the fact that α1C I-II linker fusion proteins do not bind Gβγ. It is possible that the carboxyl region cooperatively enhances binding to the α1C I-II linker in these chimeric constructs. Kinetic modeling of G protein inhibition of single N-type calcium channels has shown that G protein binding results in a reluctance of channels to undergo transitions from the closed states to channel opening (27Patil P.G. deLeon M. Reed R.R. Dubel S. Snutch T.P. Yue D.T. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2509-2521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Upon membrane depolarization, G proteins dissociate from the channels prior to opening, and the associated increase in first latency to opening results in a decrease in peak current amplitude. Within the framework of this model, the binding of Gβγto the domain I-II linker and perhaps the carboxyl terminus mediates the stabilization of the closed state by inducing a conformational change in the channel protein. The translation of G protein binding into a change in channel function may be mediated by residues located in domain I, consistent with previous studies (34Zhang J.F. Ellinor P.T. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1996; 17: 991-1003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 38Stephens G.J. Canti C. Page K.M. Dolphin A.C. J.

Overall, a model emerges in which Gβγ interacts with two high affinity regions within the calcium channel domain I-II linker (residues 353–389 and 410–428 (29Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 36DeWaard M. Liu H. Walker D. Scott V.E.S. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and a lower affinity site in the carboxyl terminus (33Quin N. Platano Olcese R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8866-8871Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). PKC-dependent phosphorylation probably destabilizes Gβγ binding to the second site within the I-II linker Gβγ binding domain (i.e. residues 410–428), thereby shifting the voltage dependence of Gβγ dissociation to more hyperpolarized potentials and perhaps reducing the increase in first latency to opening associated with Gβγ binding (27Patil P.G. deLeon M. Reed R.R. Dubel S. Snutch T.P. Yue D.T. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2509-2521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Single channel experiments will ultimately be required to confirm any effects of phosphorylation (and of the T422E substitution) on first latency. Our data indicate that up-regulation of N-type channel activity occurs via phosphorylation of either Thr422 or Ser425, whereas G protein modulation is antagonized by phosphorylation of only Thr422. The selective phosphorylation of Ser425 would result in up-regulation by ∼50%, and the subsequent stimulation of the G protein pathway would produce a ∼50% inhibition of the PKC-enhanced current, resulting in an overall inhibition of ∼25%. Phosphorylation of Thr422(or of both residues simultaneously) would also result in the 50% up-regulation, but subsequent G protein inhibition would be attenuated to ∼20% and result in a net up-regulation by ∼20%. Since activation of PKC and G protein pathways individually would respectively produce a 50% increase and a 50% decrease in control current levels, Thr422 and Ser425 may function as an integration center for inputs from PKC and G protein pathways to produce multiple levels of calcium channel activity. Together with recent reports that protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation disrupts the interactions between syntaxin and the calcium channel II-III linker (16Yokoyama C.T. Sheng Z. Catterall W.A. J. Neurocsi. 1997; 17: 6929-6938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this convergence of second messenger pathways directly at the level of the calcium channel α1 subunit would provide a mechanism to precisely control neurotransmitter release at presynaptic nerve terminals."
https://openalex.org/W2136655847,"Following T cell antigen receptor (TCR) engagement, the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) ZAP-70 is rapidly phosphorylated on several tyrosine residues, presumably by two mechanisms: an autophosphorylation and a trans-phosphorylation by the Src-family PTK Lck. These events have been implicated in both positive and negative regulation of ZAP-70 activity and in coupling this PTK to downstream signaling pathways in T cells. We show here that Tyr315 and Tyr319 in the interdomain B of ZAP-70 are autophosphorylated in vitro and become phosphorylated in vivo upon TCR triggering. Moreover, by mutational analysis, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Tyr319 is required for the positive regulation of ZAP-70 function. Indeed, overexpression in Jurkat cells and in a murine T cell hybridoma of a ZAP-70 mutant in which Tyr319 was replaced by phenylalanine (ZAP-70-Y319F) dramatically impaired anti-TCR-induced activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells and interleukin-2 production, respectively. Surprisingly, an analogous mutation of Tyr315 had little or no effect. The inhibitory effect of ZAP-70-Y319F correlated with a substantial loss of its activation-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and up-regulation of catalytic activity, as well as with a decreased in vivocapacity to phosphorylate known ZAP-70 substrates, such as SLP-76 and LAT. Collectively, our data reveal the pivotal role of Tyr319phosphorylation in the positive regulation of ZAP-70 and in TCR-mediated signaling."

For straight replacement-type targeting construct, a neo cassette was inserted into exon 7 of the ℓMTP gene between a SmaI and aXhoI site (data available from L. C. upon request). The conditional targeting construct was designed by inserting a neo-loxP cassette in the XbaI site of intron 6 and a loxP fragment in the BamHI site of intron 4 of the ℓMTP (Fig.1 A). A thymidine kinase cassette was ligated to the 5′ end of the construct. An R1 ES cell line was obtained from Dr. Andras Nagy at the University of Toronto. The cells were expanded to passage 14 and used to generate knockout mice as described previously (17Nakamuta M. Chang B.H.J. Zsigmond E. Kobayashi K. Lei H. Ishida B.Y. Oka K. Li E. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25981-25988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Three positive ES cell clones were injected into blastocysts of C57BL/6J, and chimeric mice were obtained. They were mated with C57BL/6J mice, and germ line transmission was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Most experiments were conducted on siblings of F2 or F3 mice. The mice were weaned at 21 days and fed either a chow diet (Teklad 7001) or a high fat cholesterol diet (ICN 960393) containing 1.23% cholesterol and 17.84% fat. Total RNA from the liver and small intestine were isolated using TriZOL (Life Technologies, Inc.). A polymerase chain reaction product containing the first 350 base pairs of the mouse ℓMTP cDNA were cloned into pBluescript KS vector and used as a probe for RNase protection assay. The authenticity of the clone was verified by sequencing, and the antisense strand RNA was transcribed by using MAXIscript (Ambion). The assay was done using the RPAII kit (Ambion) with 5 μg of total RNA following the instructions of the vendor's manual. A β-actin probe was used as an internal control in the assay. Liver and small intestine were removed, and total proteins were extracted by a Wheaton No. 6 hand-held homogenizer in buffer B (10 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 2.5 mm sodium phosphate monobasic, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Microsomal fractions were isolated from extracts of liver and small intestine by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in buffer B, and the protein concentration was determined by a DC Protein Assay Kit from Bio-Rad. Ten μg of microsomal protein was loaded onto a 4–15% gradient polyacrylamide gel, and a rabbit anti-bovine ℓMTP antiserum (a gift from Dr. David Gordon of Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute) was used for Western blot analysis. One hundred μg of microsomal protein was used to measure the MTP-mediated [14C]triglyceride transfer activity as described in Jamilet al. (18Jamil H. Dickson Jr., J.K. Chu C.-H. Lago M.W. Rinehart J.K. Biller S.A. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6549-6554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Blood was collected after a 4–5-h fast, and total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were measured by enzymatic kits (Sigma Diagnostics). Two hundred μl of pooled plasma from 3–4 animals was loaded on a FPLC system with 2 Superose 6 columns connected in series (Pharmacia FPLC System, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 0.5-ml fractions were collected using an elution buffer (1 mm EDTA, 154 mmNaCl, and 0.02% NaN3, pH 8.2) (19Cole T. Kitchens R.T. Daugherty A. Schonfeld G. FLPC BioCommunique. 1988; 4: 4-6Google Scholar). Lipid contents in individual fractions were determined with enzymatic assay kits (Sigma Diagnostics). Very low density (VLDL), intermediate density (IDL), low density (LDL), and high density (HDL) lipoproteins are well separated by this technique (19Cole T. Kitchens R.T. Daugherty A. Schonfeld G. FLPC BioCommunique. 1988; 4: 4-6Google Scholar). A replication-defective adenovirus containing recombinant Cre recombinase, AdCre1, was a gift from Dr. Frank Graham (McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada) (20Anton M. Graham F.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4600-4606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was amplified in 293 cells and purified as described previously (21Kobayashi K. Oka K. Forte T. Ishida B.Y. Teng B.-B. Ishimura-Oka K. Nakamuta M. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6851-6860Google Scholar). Eight-week-old male mice were injected with 3 × 109 plaque-forming units of AdCre1 through a jugular vein. The AdCre1-treated mice were fed either a normal chow or a high cholesterol diet before and after injection. At day 10–21 after adenovirus administration, the mice were sacrificed and studied. Hepatocytes were isolated from AdCre1-treated mice by White's method (22White A. Clin. Genet. 1997; 52: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) except that the perfusion was done on an anesthetized animal through the portal vein instead of on excised liver. A pulse-chase experiment using [35S]methionine was done to determine apoB degradation and secretion in these cells (23Yeung S.J. Chen S.-H. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Triglyceride secretion in vivo was quantified by the intravenous administration of Triton WR1339 (24Li X. Catalina F. Grundy S.M. Patel S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 210-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma triglycerides were measured at 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after treatment; the triglyceride accumulation remained linear during this time. As reported by Raabe et al. (15Raabe M. Flynn L.M. Zlot C.H. Wong J.S. Véniant M.M. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8686-8691Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), we produced ℓMTP knockout mice by gene targeting in ES cells and found that inactivation of the ℓMTP locus in mice is embryonic lethal in the homozygous state. 2B. H.-J. Chang, M. Nakamuta, and L. Chan, unpublished observations. We have therefore produced a conditional knockout construct shown in Fig.1 A. It would insert two loxP sequences encompassing exons 5 and 6. Deletion of these exons would be predicted to inactivate the ℓMTP protein because it causes a shift in the translation frame of the mRNA if the remaining exons are correctly spliced into a mutant mRNA. Homologous recombination was verified by digestion of genomic ES cell DNA with BamHI and Southern blot analysis using a probe outside the targeting vector (Fig.1 A). The presence of a diagnostic 4-kb fragment instead of the wild-type 6-kb fragment indicates insertion of the targeted vector by homologous recombination. 14 of 124 clones (11%) that were G418- and FIAU-resistant exhibited a pattern consistent with homologous recombination. 3 of 14 ES cell clones were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts, yielding 8 chimeric mice with agouti coat color indicating essentially 100% contribution of ES cells. Chimeric males were bred with C57BL/6J females, and germ line transmission was observed in 5% (2/40) of the progeny by Southern blot analysis of tail DNA (Fig.1 B). Heterozygous and homozygous floxed ℓMTP−/− mice were obtained by cross-breeding. These animals were fertile and produced normal-sized litters. The birth weights, growth, and development of wild-type, ℓMTP+/−, and ℓMTP−/− mice were indistinguishable. The basal plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels are similar in the three types of animals while they were on a regular chow diet (TableI). Therefore, insertion of the loxP sequences and the neo cassette did not appear to disrupt the function of ℓMTP under basal conditions. Two weeks after these animals were put on a high cholesterol diet, there was an approximate doubling of the plasma cholesterol but little change in plasma triglyceride concentrations. Again, the levels were not significantly different among the three groups of animals (Table I).Table IPlasma lipids in wild-type and floxed MTP knockout miceGenotypeBefore AdCre1 administration (normal chow)Before AdCre1 administration (high cholesterol diet for 2 weeks)3 weeks after AdCre1 administration (high cholesterol diet)TGaTG, triglyceride; CHOL, cholesterol.CHOLaTG, triglyceride; CHOL, cholesterol.TGCHOLTGCHOL+/+34.90 ± 1.3190.39 ± 5.0342.89 ± 3.76191.21 ± 11.5268.62 ± 7.23227.58 ± 12.48+/−35.41 ± 2.4895.37 ± 3.4543.32 ± 2.73207.22 ± 18.8471.52 ± 18.38180.69 ± 12.38bSignificant difference between +/+ and +/− (p < 0.05).−/−40.67 ± 3.5285.18 ± 13.4743.12 ± 4.61174.53 ± 11.9154.95 ± 7.20119.60 ± 23.97cSignificant difference between +/+ and −/− (p < 0.01).The number of mice studied before AdCre1 administration were 6 each from +/+ and +/− and 4 from −/−; after AdCre1 treatment there were 4 for each genotype.a TG, triglyceride; CHOL, cholesterol.b Significant difference between +/+ and +/− (p < 0.05).c Significant difference between +/+ and −/− (p < 0.01). Open table in a new tab The number of mice studied before AdCre1 administration were 6 each from +/+ and +/− and 4 from −/−; after AdCre1 treatment there were 4 for each genotype. We examined the effect of the introduction of Cre recombinase on the ℓMTP gene and its expression in wild-type and knockout animals. Induction of Cre recombinase expression was effected by the intravenous administration of a purified recombinant adenovirus carrying the Cre1 recombinase (AdCre1) (20Anton M. Graham F.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4600-4606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We removed the liver and small intestine and extracted DNA, RNA, and microsomes from these tissues 1.5–3 weeks after AdCre1 treatment. By Southern blot analysis, we found that AdCre1 treatment produced a deletion of the floxed exons in the ℓMTP gene in the liver. By EcoRV digestion, hybridization using the probe shown produced a 6.5-kb band in the intact floxed ℓMTP gene (Fig.2). Upon deletion of the floxed portion of the gene, it produced a 3.5-kb band with the removal of the DNA between the loxP sequences, which has an EcoRV site in exon 5. When we examined the blot from DNA extracted from the small intestine, it was evident that the floxed ℓMTP locus remained intact. The liver specificity is not unexpected because adenoviral vectors administered intravenously are taken up preferentially by liver cells (25Chan L. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For heterozygous ℓMTP knockout mice, deletion of the floxed ℓMTP allele was also detected in the liver but not the small intestine (data not shown). We next examined liver and small intestine ℓMTP mRNA levels following AdCre1 administration. We used RNase protection assay with an ℓMTP cDNA fragment and a β-actin cDNA fragment as internal control. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the ℓMTP mRNA band is essentially undetectable in the liver of Cre-treated ℓMTP−/− mice, whereas the ℓMTP mRNA level in treated ℓMTP+/− mouse liver was only slightly reduced. In comparison, the concentration of ℓMTP mRNA in the small intestine of mice of all three genotypes and in the liver of wild-type mice was unaffected by AdCre1 administration. Therefore, there was good correlation between ℓMTP mRNA expression and the presence of an undisrupted ℓMTP gene, and Cre-induced deletion of exons 5 and 6 led to the absence of detectable ℓMTP mRNA. Since the antisense probe used corresponds to a region of the ℓMTP gene 5′ to the missing exons, these results suggest that in the AdCre1-treated mouse liver, if the disrupted ℓMTP gene were transcribed at all, the RNA transcript was so unstable and its steady-state concentration so low that it was undetectable by RNase protection. To examine whether these changes at the DNA and mRNA levels are reflected at the protein level, we isolated microsomes from the liver and small intestine and performed immunoblot analysis using an ℓMTP antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 B, a ℓMTP immunoreactive band was easily detectable in wild-type mouse liver and small intestine, being slightly more intense in the latter. Following AdCre1 treatment there was a reduction in intensity of the immunoreactive band in the liver, but not small intestine, of the heterozygous floxed ℓMTP+/− mice. In the homozygous floxed ℓMTP−/− mice, the Cre gene transfer to the liver completely eliminated the ℓMTP band. Interestingly, there seemed to be a concomitant increase in the intensity of the ℓMTP band in the small intestine following AdCre1 treatment. ℓMTP has a relatively long half-life (4.4 days in HepG2 cells (26Lin M.C.M. Gordon D. Wetterau J.R. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1073-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). These results indicate that in mice, within 10 days of acute interruption of ℓMTP gene transcription, there is essentially no immunoreactive ℓMTP left in the liver cells. We determined the MTP activity in the microsomes isolated from AdCre1-treated wild-type, floxed heterozygous ℓMTP+/−, and floxed homozygous ℓMTP−/− animals. The results shown in Fig. 3 C reveal that the MTP triglyceride transfer activity of microsomes isolated from the liver of heterozygous floxed ℓMTP+/− (3.7%) mice is reduced to about half that of the wild-type (7.3%), and the activity of the homozygous floxed ℓMTP−/− mice is almost down to background level (1.3%). In contrast, the intestinal MTP triglyceride transfer activity in all three groups of animals is very similar (7.8%, 8.6%, and 7.7%, respectively, for wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous knockout animals). Therefore, in the liver and small intestine there is good correlation between ℓMTP protein expression and MTP functional activity, which suggests that ℓMTP, and not protein-disulfide isomerase, is limiting under these conditions. The plasma lipid levels of the different types of mice before and after AdCre1 treatment are shown in Table I. Before adenovirus administration, the mice were put on a high cholesterol diet, and their plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels were similar in the three groups of animals. Following AdCre1 injection, there was a significant reduction in the plasma cholesterol concentration in the homozygous ℓMTP−/− mice, which was significantly lower than that in wild-type animals. The cholesterol level in the heterozygous animals was intermediate between those of wild-type and homozygous knockout animals. The plasma triglyceride level was not statistically different between the three groups of animals, although it tended to be lower in the homozygous mice. Because functional ℓMTP is required for apoB biogenesis (12Gordon D.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 14Wetterau J.R. Lin M.C.M. Jamil H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1345: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), we analyzed the plasma for apoB-100 and apoB-48 expression by immunoblot analysis. We took plasma from these mice 2 weeks following AdCre1 treatment. In animals that were on regular chow (Fig. 3 D,left panel), there was no difference in wild-type and heterozygous knockout animals; both had clearly detectable apoB-48, but barely detectable apoB-100. In homozygous knockout animals, apoB-100 was undetectable and apoB-48 was markedly reduced and barely detectable. In wild-type animals that were fed a high cholesterol diet (Fig. 3 D, right panel), plasma apoB-100 and apoB-48 were clearly detected on the blot, with apoB-48 being a much more intense band than the apoB-100 band. In comparison, the AdCre1-treated heterozygous floxed ℓMTP+/− mice had mildly reduced apoB-48 and markedly reduced apoB-100 bands. When we analyzed the plasma from AdCre1-treated homozygous floxed ℓMTP−/− mice, we found a marked reduction in the intensity of the apoB-48 band and an almost complete disappearance of the apoB-100 band. Therefore, specific inactivation of the ℓMTP locus in the liver leads to an essentially complete absence of circulating apoB-100 and a marked decrease in plasma apoB-48. These changes would be consistent with the annulment of apoB-100 and apoB-48 production by the liver with the preservation of apoB-48 production in the small intestine in the AdCre1-treated homozygous floxed ℓMTP−/− mice. We next analyzed the plasma lipoproteins in the different groups of mice by FPLC analysis (Fig. 4). Plasma was obtained from wild-type, heterozygous floxed ℓMTP+/−, and homozygous floxed ℓMTP−/−mice 10 to 21 days following AdCre1 treatment. In chow-fed animals, in comparison with wild-type, the ℓMTP−/− mice displayed a complete absence of the VLDL and IDL/LDL peaks (Fig. 4 A,top panel) and a markedly reduced HDL peak. In heterozygous animals, only minor reductions were observed in the VLDL and IDL/LDL regions, with no change in the HDL region compared with wild-type animals. Among animals that were fed a high cholesterol diet, wild-type mice developed a prominent VLDL peak, a substantial IDL/LDL, and a prominent HDL peak. In the Cre-treated homozygous floxed ℓMTP−/− mice, there was essentially a complete absence of detectable lipoproteins in the VLDL and IDL/LDL fractions. There was a slight reduction in the HDL peak. Therefore, the markedly reduced apoB-100 production resulting from the almost complete inhibition of MTP activity in the ℓMTP−/− mice was sufficient to abrogate a VLDL/IDL/LDL response to high cholesterol diet feeding. The heterozygous ℓMTP+/− mice, which had intermediate ℓMTP mass and MTP activity (Fig. 3), displayed an intermediate lipoprotein phenotype (Fig. 4 A, middle panel). The plasma lipoprotein triglyceride was entirely in the VLDL region (Fig.4 A, bottom panel) in wild-type animals. It was essentially abolished in ℓMTP−/−mice. To explore the mechanism of the marked VLDL deficiency in the ℓMTP−/− mice, we measured the rate of triglyceride production in these animals. The intravenous administration of Triton WR1339 inhibits the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. The accumulation of plasma triglyceride following Triton treatment reflects the triglyceride secretion rate from the liver and intestine. Because the animals were on a fat-free diet during this experiment, the secretion came exclusively from the liver. As shown in Fig.4 B, the triglyceride secretion rate in ℓMTP−/− mice (0.09 ± 0.04 mg/min/100 g) was reduced to less than one-tenth that in the wild-type controls (1.02 ± 0.19 mg/min/100 g). The rate in heterozygous knockout mice was intermediate (0.52 ± 0.07 mg/min/100 g). Thus, the absence of VLDL/IDL/LDL in the knockout animals was a result of failure of production, not increased catabolism. Pulse-chase experiments on cultured hepatocytes isolated from wild-type and homozygous knockout animals revealed that there was complete failure of secretion of apoB in ℓMTP−/− animals, which would account for the absence of VLDL production in these animals. Albumin production was normal (Fig. 4 C). In conclusion, we have produced a viable abetalipoproteinemia gene knockout mouse model using a Cre/loxP strategy. We found that the liver-specific disruption of the ℓMTP gene was sufficient to completely abrogate the plasma VLDL/LDL response to a high cholesterol diet. Because conventional knockout of the ℓMTP gene is embryonic lethal in the homozygous state, the conditional knockout mice will be a valuable model for studying the metabolic defect and pathophysiology of abetalipoproteinemia as well as the role of MTP in apoB biosynthesis and the biogenesis of apoB-containing lipoproteins in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2137618759,"Activation of p21-activated kinases (Paks) is achieved through binding of the GTPases Rac or Cdc42 to a conserved domain in the N-terminal regulatory region of Pak. Additional signaling components are also likely to be important in regulating Pak activation. Recently, a family of Pak-interacting guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Pix) have been identified and which are good candidates for regulating Pak activity. Using an active, truncated form of αPix (amino acids 155–545), we observe stimulation of Pak1 kinase activity when αPix155–545 is co-expressed with Cdc42 and wild-type Pak1 in COS-1 cells. This activation does not occur when we co-express a Pak1 mutant unable to bind αPix. The activation of wild-type Pak1 by αPix155–545 also requires that αPix155–545 retain functional exchange factor activity. However, the Pak1H83,86L mutant that does not bind Rac or Cdc42 is activated in the absence of GTPase by αPix155–545 and by a mutant of αPix155–545 that no longer has exchange factor activity. Pak1 activity stimulated in vitro using GTPγS-loaded Cdc42 was also enhanced by recombinant αPix155–545 in a binding-dependent manner. These data suggest that Pak activity can be modulated by physical interaction with αPix and that this specific effect involves both exchange factor-dependent and -independent mechanisms."

The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Müller cells contain a blue and UV light-absorbing opsin, the RPE retinal G protein-coupled receptor (RGR, or RGR opsin). The spectral properties of RGR purified from bovine RPE suggest that RGR is conjugated in vivo to a retinal chromophore through a covalent Schiff base bond.

The RPE and Müller cell opsin, a putative RPE retinal G protein-coupled receptor (RGR, or RGR opsin), is most similar in amino acid sequence to retinochrome, a photoisomerase that catalyzes the conversion of all-trans- to 11-cis-retinal in squid photoreceptors (6Hara T.

RGR has been isolated from bovine RPE microsomal membranes under dark conditions, and its absorption spectrum reveals two pH-dependent species with absorption maxima in the blue (λmax = ∼466 nm) and near-ultraviolet (λmax = ∼364 nm) regions of light (8Hao W. Fong H.K.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6251-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The shape of the absorption peaks and the biochemical properties of the photopigment are consistent with those of a retinylidene Schiff base chromophore, the pK a of which is markedly different from those of the visual pigments. RGR is localized to intracellular membranes in the RPE and Müller cells (9Pandey S. Blanks J.C. Spee C. Jiang M. Fong H.K.W. Exp.

Peropsin is another retinochrome-like opsin, and melanopsin most closely resembles cephalopod visual pigments. The presence of multiple opsins in the RPE signals that the RPE may consist of primary photoreceptive cells.

Regulation of the multistep retinoid pathways in the RPE is highly coordinated with visual pigment status and lighting conditions through complex and unknown mechanisms (27Dowling J.E. Nature. 1960; 163: 114-118Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar).On the basis of its subcellular localization in RPE microsomes, ability to form a stable photopigment with bound all-trans-retinal, and amino acid sequence homology to retinochrome, RGR may be involved in a retinochrome-like mechanism of the vertebrate visual cycle or in a novel form of phototransduction. All retinaldehyde-based opsins involve stereospecific cis,trans photoisomerization of the bound chromophore as a central step in their biological function. In this paper, we describe studies to directly identify the endogenous chromophore of RGR from the RPE and to investigate the photochemistry of RGR by analyzing the effect of light on the isomeric configuration of the bound retinal.DISCUSSIONThe spectral properties of RGR purified from bovine RPE suggest that RGR is conjugated in vivo to a retinal chromophore by means of a covalent Schiff base bond. In this study, the endogenous chromophore of RGR was extracted and identified following hydroxylamine derivatization. Our findings indicate that the predominant chromophore of RGR is all-trans-retinal. Irradiation of RGR results in stereospecific conversion of the bound all-trans isomer to 11-cis-retinal. These results support the notion that RGR functions as a stereospecific photoisomerase in the RPE and Müller cells.Chromophore of RGRIn addition to all-trans-retinal, a minor constant amount of 13-cis-retinal was observed routinely in the retinoid extracts from RGR. The origin of 13-cis-retinal is unclear. Persistent small amounts of this isomer have been observed likewise in retinoid extracts of retinochrome (31Ozaki K. Terakita A. Hara R. Hara T. Vision Res. 1986; 26: 691-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A small amount of the 13-cis isomer was also present in our retinoid extract of rhodopsin following the extraction conditions. As a non-physiological constituent, the 13-cis isomer may be formed by thermal isomerization during the protein denaturation. 11-cis-Retinal also was extracted in the dark from RGR. Since RGR photoisomerizes bound all-trans- to 11-cis-retinal, it is conceivable that the 11-cis-retinaloxime originated from a population of physiologically relevant 11-cis-retinal·RGR complex. In relation to this assumption, when the RPE microsomal membranes were preincubated with exogenous all-trans-retinal, 11-cis-retinal was completely absent in purified RGR, although 13-cis-retinal was still present. It is probable that a small fraction of RGR is bound in situ to 11-cis-retinal, which can be quantitatively displaced from the protein by an excess of the all-trans isomer. In a control experiment, the endogenous chromophore of rhodopsin was extracted and analyzed in a similar manner. As expected, the physiologically relevant 11-cis- and all-trans-retinal isomers were identified in rhodopsin, along with the small amount of 13-cis-retinal.The procedure for purification of RGR extends over 20 h, and during this time, there is a potential for spontaneous thermal isomerization of the retinal chromophore in RGR from a hypothetical 11-cis to all-trans configuration. The actual extent of thermal isomerization of 11-cis-retinal was investigated in three separate purifications of RGR. Overall, there were only slight differences in the distribution of retinal isomers between that in microsomes and the final steps of purification. A small ∼3% decrease in 11-cis-retinal and a slight increase in all-trans-retinal were associated with the step of solubilization of RPE microsomal membranes in the presence of digitonin. The actual amount of 11-cis-retinal that underwent artifactual isomerization was significantly less than the total amount of all-trans-retinal in RGR. Thus, the results exclude the possibility that the major endogenous chromophore of RGR from microsomes was originally 11-cis-retinal, which converted to the all-trans configuration during purification of RGR in the dark.Interestingly, the reaction of the chromophore of RGR with hydroxylamine produced syn and anti isomers of all-trans-retinaloxime in a syn/antiratio of ∼9, which is significantly higher than thesyn/anti- retinaloxime ratios of ∼2 and 3.4 observed in reactions with illuminated rhodopsin and free all-trans-retinal, respectively (30Groenendijk G.W.T. De Grip W.J. Daemen F.J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 617: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The singularsyn/anti-oxime ratio for RGR suggests that the protein retains a folded conformation. The interaction between chromophore and hydroxylamine may be constrained by the structure of the binding site for all-trans-retinal, such that the production of the syn isomer of all-trans-retinaloxime is strongly favored in the microenvironment of the reaction. The denaturation of RGR in the presence of SDS then lowers thesyn/anti-all-trans-retinaloxime product ratio to ∼1.3 (Fig. 5).Photoisomerase ActivityIrradiation of the all-trans-retinal·RGR complex modifies the relative amounts of only the two physiologically relevant isomers,i.e. all-trans- and 11-cis-retinals. When irradiated with monochromatic light at 470 or 370 nm, all-trans-retinal in RGR, as in retinochrome, isomerizes stereospecifically to 11-cis-retinal. Only 11-cis-retinal is newly formed in RGR, and relative levels of 13-cis and other isomers of retinal are unchanged. The photoisomerization of all-trans-retinal in RGR was dependent on a folded protein structure since denaturation of RGR in SDS abolished the cis,trans stereospecificity.Although the chromophore in RGR was converted specifically to 11-cis-retinal, the highest level to which the 11-cis isomer increased was ∼50% of total retinals under our experimental conditions. The formation of 11-cis-retinal in RGR contrasts with photoisomerization of the chromophore in retinochrome, in which the 11-cis isomer may increase to as much as 80% of total retinals after illumination (35Ozaki K. Hara R. Hara T. Kakitani T. Biophys. J. 1983; 44: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The extent to which 11-cis-retinal is formed in RGR may be reduced by stereospecific photoreversal of the chromophore back to the all-trans isomer. Irradiation of RGR does not lead to bleaching or a large shift in the λmax of the blue light-absorbing form of RGR (8Hao W. Fong H.K.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6251-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We conclude that 11-cis-retinal does not dissociate freely from the purified protein in the presence of light. Therefore, continuous light exposure may result in photoisomerization of the 11-cis-retinal bound to irradiated RGR and, eventually, a photoequilibrium of RGR bound to both 11-cis and all-trans isomers. The larger extent to which 11-cis-retinal can be formed in retinochrome upon illumination with orange light may be attributed to the difference of ∼26 nm between the λmax of retinochrome (496 nm) and that of meta retinochrome (470 nm).The extinction coefficients of RGR469 (62,800) and RGR370 (66,100) are slightly higher than that of retinochrome (60,800) (36Hara T. Hara R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and 1.5- and 1.6-fold greater than that of rhodopsin (40,600), respectively. Although RGR has a higher extinction coefficient, its photosensitivity appears to be lower than that of rhodopsin. Under our experimental conditions, RGR469 is at least one-third as efficient as rhodopsin in using the energy of photons. The photosensitivity of RGR469 is ∼7-fold greater than that of CRALBP (1078 cm−1m−1) (33Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7618-7622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data support the argument that photoisomerization of the bound chromophore is physiologically relevant in the function of RGR. It is possible that RGR is a still more efficient photoisomerase under in vivo conditions or within an optimal lipid membrane environment. Retinal-binding proteins may also serve to transfer retinals to and from RGR and to accelerate the net production of 11-cis-retinal. Recently, CRALBP has been shown to increase the rate of 11-cis-retinol synthesis by RPE isomerohydrolase (37Winston A. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2044-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In squid, RALBP (retinaldehyde-bindingprotein) downloads 11-cis-retinal from meta retinochrome to meta rhodopsin through an exchange of isomers (38Terakita A. Hara R. Hara T. Vision Res. 1989; 29: 639-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).A mechanism for rapid synthesis of 11-cis-retinal must exist for the regeneration of visual pigments under photopic conditions. The synthesis of 11-cis-retinol by the RPE isomerohydrolase provides one such mechanism that also can act during dark adaptation. Although it can be demonstrated that RGR is a stereospecific photoisomerase that favors conversion of all-trans-retinal to the 11-cis isomer, there is yet no direct evidence that the 11-cis-retinal from RGR dissociates and enters the pathway for regeneration of visual pigments. The RPE appears to have divergent pools of 11-cis-retinal, the function of which may be to participate in a novel phototransduction system of the RPE, to supply a chromophore for peropsin or melanopsin, or to regenerate rhodopsin and the cone pigments under scotopic and intense photopic lighting conditions. Further characterization of RPE opsins and the precise flow of retinoids through the RPE, including analysis of retinoid metabolism in mouse mutants that lack RGR, will test the hypothesis that RGR functions in a retinochrome-like arm of the vertebrate visual cycle. A number of visual pigment homologues have been identified outside of photoreceptor cells in vertebrates. Nonvisual opsins reside in the pineal gland, melanophores, Müller cells, and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) 1The abbreviations used are: RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; RGR, RPE retinal G protein-coupled receptor; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; ROS, rod outer segment(s).1The abbreviations used are: RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; RGR, RPE retinal G protein-coupled receptor; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; ROS, rod outer segment(s).

The RPE and Müller cell opsin, a putative RPE retinal G protein-coupled receptor (RGR, or RGR opsin), is most similar in amino acid sequence to retinochrome, a photoisomerase that catalyzes the conversion of all-trans- to 11-cis-retinal in squid photoreceptors (6Hara T.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). RGR has been isolated from bovine RPE microsomal membranes under dark conditions, and its absorption spectrum reveals two pH-dependent species with absorption maxima in the blue (λmax = ∼466 nm) and near-ultraviolet (λmax = ∼364 nm) regions of light (8Hao W. Fong H.K.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6251-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The shape of the absorption peaks and the biochemical properties of the photopigment are consistent with those of a retinylidene Schiff base chromophore, the pK a of which is markedly different from those of the visual pigments. RGR is localized to intracellular membranes in the RPE and Müller cells (9Pandey S. Blanks J.C. Spee C. Jiang M. Fong H.K.W. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 58: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and is able to bind exogenously added all-trans-retinal more efficiently than 11-cis-retinal (10Shen D. Jiang M. Hao W. Tao L. Salazar M. Fong H.K.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13117-13125Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); however, the structure of its endogenous chromophore is unknown. In addition to RGR, the RPE contains the visual pigment homologues peropsin and melanopsin (4Sun H. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9893-9898Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 5Provencio I. Jiang G. De Grip W.J. Hayes W.P. Rollag M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The presence of multiple opsins in the RPE signals that the RPE may consist of primary photoreceptive cells. This monolayer of highly differentiated epithelial cells is essential for the normal function of adjoining photoreceptors. Its diverse and unique roles in the visual process include the removal by phagocytosis of the discarded tips of photoreceptor outer segments (11Young R.W. Bok D. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 42: 392-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar), storage of retinoids (12Zimmerman W.F.

The origin of 13-cis-retinal is unclear. Persistent small amounts of this isomer have been observed likewise in retinoid extracts of retinochrome (31Ozaki K. Terakita A. Hara R. Hara T. Vision Res. 1986; 26: 691-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A small amount of the 13-cis isomer was also present in our retinoid extract of rhodopsin following the extraction conditions. As a non-physiological constituent, the 13-cis isomer may be formed by thermal isomerization during the protein denaturation. 11-cis-Retinal also was extracted in the dark from RGR. Since RGR photoisomerizes bound all-trans- to 11-cis-retinal, it is conceivable that the 11-cis-retinaloxime originated from a population of physiologically relevant 11-cis-retinal·RGR complex.

The actual extent of thermal isomerization of 11-cis-retinal was investigated in three separate purifications of RGR. Overall, there were only slight differences in the distribution of retinal isomers between that in microsomes and the final steps of purification. A small ∼3% decrease in 11-cis-retinal and a slight increase in all-trans-retinal were associated with the step of solubilization of RPE microsomal membranes in the presence of digitonin. The actual amount of 11-cis-retinal that underwent artifactual isomerization was significantly less than the total amount of all-trans-retinal in RGR. Thus, the results exclude the possibility that the major endogenous chromophore of RGR from microsomes was originally 11-cis-retinal, which converted to the all-trans configuration during purification of RGR in the dark.Interestingly, the reaction of the chromophore of RGR with hydroxylamine produced syn and anti isomers of all-trans-retinaloxime in a syn/antiratio of ∼9, which is significantly higher than thesyn/anti- retinaloxime ratios of ∼2 and 3.4 observed in reactions with illuminated rhodopsin and free all-trans-retinal, respectively (30Groenendijk G.W.T. De Grip W.J. Daemen F.J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 617: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The singularsyn/anti-oxime ratio for RGR suggests that the protein retains a folded conformation. The interaction between chromophore and hydroxylamine may be constrained by the structure of the binding site for all-trans-retinal, such that the production of the syn isomer of all-trans-retinaloxime is strongly favored in the microenvironment of the reaction. The denaturation of RGR in the presence of SDS then lowers thesyn/anti-all-trans-retinaloxime product ratio to ∼1.3 (Fig. 5).Photoisomerase ActivityIrradiation of the all-trans-retinal·RGR complex modifies the relative amounts of only the two physiologically relevant isomers,i.e. all-trans- and 11-cis-retinals. When irradiated with monochromatic light at 470 or 370 nm, all-trans-retinal in RGR, as in retinochrome, isomerizes stereospecifically to 11-cis-retinal. Only 11-cis-retinal is newly formed in RGR, and relative levels of 13-cis and other isomers of retinal are unchanged. The photoisomerization of all-trans-retinal in RGR was dependent on a folded protein structure since denaturation of RGR in SDS abolished the cis,trans stereospecificity.Although the chromophore in RGR was c"

Deletion of the CAAX box from RhoAVal-14 decreased the strength of the interaction, suggesting that lipid modification of RhoA is important for efficient binding to PLD1. The specificity of the interaction was validated by showing that the PLD1 D4 fragment interacts with glutathione S-transferase-RhoA in vitro in a GTP-dependent manner and that it associates with RhoAVal-14 in COS-7 cells, whereas the N-terminal two-thirds of PLD1 does not. Finally, we show that recombinant D4 peptide inhibits RhoA-stimulated PLD1 activation but not ARF- or PKC-α-stimulated PLD1 activation.

PLD catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) to yield phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline (2Exton J.H. J. Biol.

PA itself may play a role(s) as a second messenger; PA has been shown in vitro to stimulate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (4Moritz A. De Graan P.N.E. Gispen W.H. Wirtz K.W.A. J. Biol.

Two alternatively spliced forms, termed PLD1a and PLD1b, exist for PLD1 (18Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Cook S. Nozawa Y. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3860-3868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). PLD1a comprises 1074 amino acids, whereas PLD1b is a shorter form lacking 38 amino acids residues (585–622). PLD2 is ∼50% identical to PLD1 and is constitutively active in vitro and in vivo (15Colley W. Sung T.C. Roll R. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). In contrast, PLD1a and PLD1b exhibit a low basal activity and are stimulated by ARF, RhoA, and PKC-α in the presence of PIP2. These findings were demonstrated using purified recombinant PLD1 and activators (18Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Cook S. Nozawa Y. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3860-3868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), which led to the conclusion that PLD1 interacts directly with the lipid cofactor PIP2 and the protein activators. Since the PKC-α and the small G protein activators elicit a synergistic activation when combined, it was also proposed that they would mediate PLD1 stimulation through interactions at separate sites (18Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Cook S. Nozawa Y. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3860-3868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). These sites of interaction, however, have not yet been defined. We address this question in the present study and show that the C-terminal region of PLD1 is the RhoA-binding domain. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was purchased from Sigma, and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-PC (DPPC), PIP2, [choline-methyl-3H]DPPC, and GTPγS were from sources previously reported (12Kuribara H. Tago K. Yokozeki T. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Morii N. Narumiya S. Katada T. Kanaho Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25667-25671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A template for PCR to generate cDNA fragments for truncation mutants of human (h) PLD1a was prepared from total RNA of HL60 cells by reverse transcription with random hexamer mixed primers, followed by PCR with a set of primers designed to amplify the entire open reading frame of hPLD1a. The PCR product was cloned into pT7Blue(R) vector (Novagen). cDNA fragments encoding amino acid residues 1–415 (D1), 365–727 (D2), 663–1074 (D3), 712–1074 (D4), and 763–1074 (D5) of hPLD1a were generated by PCR with primers containing 5′-BclI and 3′-NotI sites, digested with BclI and NotI, and purified. A cDNA fragment encoding amino acid residues 712–1015 (D6) of hPLD1a was obtained from the D4 cDNA by digestion withPvuII. The cDNA fragments for D1–D6 were ligated into the yeast expression vector pVP16 containing the VP16 transcription activation domain (a generous gift of Dr. Stanley Fields). The cDNAs encoding wild type and mutants of RhoA were ligated into the vector pBTM116 containing LexA-binding domain as described previously (19Shibata H. Mukai H. Inagaki Y. Homma Y. Kimura K. Kaibuchi K. Narumiya S. Ono Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids were co-transfected intoSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain L40 cells and plated on synthetic complete media lacking tryptophan and leucine. Interaction was basically assessed by a filter assay for β-galactosidase activity (20Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Wild type RhoA was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein (GST-RhoA) and purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B column chromatography. After removal of free glutathione by Q-Sepharose column chromatography, the purified GST-RhoA was stored at −80 °C until use. The D4 peptide was expressed in E. coli as a FLAG epitope-tagged protein (FLAG-D4). cDNA of the D4 peptide was amplified by PCR with a sense primer containing 5′-XhoI/EcoRI sites and an antisense primer containing a 3′-BglII site using pT7Blue(R)-hPLD1a as a template, digested with XhoI and BglII, and inserted into the pFLAG MAC vector (Eastman Kodak Co.). FLAG-D4 was inducibly expressed in E. coli strain BL21 cells at 30 °C for 3 h with 0.3 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After disruption of cells by sonication and centrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min), solubilized FLAG-D4 was purified with an anti-FLAG M2 antibody affinity resin (Kodak) and stored at −80 °C until use. Five μg of GST-RhoA was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min with 5 μg of FLAG-D4 in the presence of 40 μm GDP or GTPγS in a total volume of 50 μl. GST-RhoA was then precipitated with a glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin in the presence of 0.3%n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. FLAG-D4 co-precipitated with GST-RhoA was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Kodak). For the expression of FLAG-D4 in COS-7 cells, the D4 cDNA amplified by PCR as described above was digested with EcoRI and BglII and cloned into pTB701-FLAG vector (a generous gift of Drs. S. Kuroda and U. Kikkawa) (21Kuroda S. Tokunaga C. Kiyohara Y. Higuchi O. Konishi H. Mizuno K. Gill G.N. Kikkawa U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31029-31032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). To express a FLAG-tagged peptide (FLAG-D(1+2)) which complemented the FLAG-D3/D4 peptides, a cDNA encoding amino acid residues 1–670 was generated. In brief, an allele of hPLD1b altered through the insertion of a stop codon at amino acid 671 was used. The allele was generated using a pentapeptide mutagenesis protocol (22Hayes F. Hallet B. Cao Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28833-28836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) that will be described in detail elsewhere. pTB701-FLAG-D(1+2) was constructed by insertion of the 1.8-kilobase pair BglII-BamHI fragment of pCGN-D(1+2) into the BglII-BglII gap of pTB701-FLAG-hPLD1a (see below). pEF-BOS-HA-RhoA and pEF-BOS-HA-RhoAVal-14 were prepared as described previously (23Kuroda S. Fukata M. Kobayashi K. Nakafuku M. Nomura N. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23363-23367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were co-transfected with pTB701-FLAG-D4 or pTB701-FLAG-D(1+2) and either pEF-BOS-HA-RhoA or pEF-BOS-HA-RhoAVal-14 by electroporation. After 48 h, the cells were lysed in a buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. FLAG-D4 or FLAG-D(1+2) was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant with the anti-FLAG M2 antibody affinity resin, and co-immunoprecipitated HA-tagged RhoA or RhoAVal-14 was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (16B12, BAbCO). To prepare FLAG-hPLD1a, the cDNA encoding the full-length of hPLD1a was amplified by PCR with primers containing an MunI site using pT7Blue(R)-hPLD1a as a template, digested with MunI, and inserted into the pTB701-FLAG vector. The plasmid was transfected into COS-7 cells by electroporation. After being cultured for 48 h, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and centrifuged (50,000 × g, 30 min), and solubilized FLAG-hPLD1a was purified with the anti-FLAG M2 antibody affinity resin. For RhoA purification, bovine brain cytosol was subjected to the DEAE-Toyopearl 650S and the phenyl-Toyopearl 650M column chromatography (12Kuribara H. Tago K. Yokozeki T. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Morii N. Narumiya S. Katada T. Kanaho Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25667-25671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The major peak of RhoA eluted from the latter column (12Kuribara H. Tago K. Yokozeki T. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Morii N. Narumiya S. Katada T. Kanaho Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25667-25671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was re-chromatographed on a phenyl-Toyopearl 650M column. To highly purify ARF, the partially purified ARF from bovine brain cytosol by DEAE-Sepharose and Sephacryl S-200 column chromatography (12Kuribara H. Tago K. Yokozeki T. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Morii N. Narumiya S. Katada T. Kanaho Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25667-25671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was then sequentially subjected to chromatography on a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B and a phenyl-Toyopearl 650M column. Both the purified small G proteins were estimated to be greater than 90% pure by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Recombinant PKC-α was expressed in and purified from Sf21 cells as previously reported (24Fujise A. Mizuno K. Ueda Y. Osada S. Hirai S.-I. Takayanagi A. Shimizu N. Ohwada K. Nakajima H. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31642-31648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FLAG-hPLD1a was reconstituted with the purified RhoA or ARF or recombinant PKC-α in the presence of PE/PIP2/[choline-methyl-3H]DPPC vesicles (158.64 μm) in a molar ratio of 16:1.4:1 (9Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). The reaction also contained the indicated concentrations of the FLAG-D4 peptide. For the activation of FLAG-hPLD1a by PKC-α, 100 nm PMA was included in the reaction. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 45 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.4, 3 mm EGTA, 150 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mmCaCl2, 40 μm GTPγS, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and then the production of [3H]choline was determined (12Kuribara H.

Proteins in samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membrane was blocked and incubated with the first antibodies and then with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (12Kuribara H. Tago K. Yokozeki T. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Morii N. Narumiya S. Katada T. Kanaho Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25667-25671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were detected with an ECL immunoblotting detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. To identify the PLD1 domains mediating interaction with each activator, we employed the LexA version of the yeast two-hybrid system (26Bartel P.L. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar). Since reporter gene activation in this system requires import of the fusion proteins into the nucleus and this nuclear import is often unsuccessful for large proteins (26Bartel P.L. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar), fragments of hPLD1 and the activators (RhoA, ARF, and PKC-α) were fused to the binding domain of LexA and the herpes VP16/GAL4 activation domain, respectively. Consistent with our previous report (27Sung T.C. Roper R. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4519-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), RhoAVal-14, the active form of RhoA, successfully interacted with the C terminus of PLD1. However, this was the only combination that succeeded (data not shown). The RhoAVal-14/PLD1 C terminus interaction appears likely to be specific, since the corresponding C-terminal regions of mammalian PLD2 and yeast PLD, which are related in sequence to mammalian PLD1 but do not respond to RhoA (15Colley W. Sung T.C. Roll R. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), did not activate the yeast reporter genes when co-expressed with RhoAVal-14 (data not shown). To begin to validate the RhoA-PLD1 interaction, we switched the PLD fragments to the VP16 activation vector and RhoA to the LexA DNA binding vector and attempted to subdivide the interacting PLD1 region (Fig. 1 A). Confirming the results described above, the N-terminal (D1) and central (D2) fragments did not interact with RhoAVal-14, but the C terminus (D3, amino acid residues 663–1074, and D4, amino acid residues 712–1074) did. Further truncation of the D4 fragment from either end (D5, amino acid residues 763–1074, and D6, amino acid residues 712–1015) eliminated the interaction. These results demonstrate that a 362-amino acid C-terminal fragment of hPLD1 constitutes essentially the minimal fragment capable of interacting with RhoAVal-14 in the yeast two-hybrid system. The C-terminal motif CAAX (C, cysteine; A, aliphatic amino acid; X, any amino acid) found in RhoA family members is post-translationally modified by geranylgeranylation on the cysteine residue, which leads to subsequent proteolysis and carboxylmethylation (28Katayama M.

J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These post-translational modifications of the Rho GTPases are important for promoting interaction with their GDP/GTP exchange proteins and effectors (30Ando S. Kaibuchi K. Sasaki T. Hiraoka K. Nishiyama T. Mizuno T. Asada M. Nunoi H. Matsuda I. Matsuura Y. Polakis P. McCormick F. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25709-25713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hori Y.

Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6442-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To examine the role of C-terminal modification of RhoA in the interaction with PLD1 in the yeast two-hybrid system, four types of RhoA (wild type, the CAAXdeletion mutant RhoACLVL−, the active mutant RhoAVal-14, and the CAAX-deleted active mutant RhoAVal-14CLVL−) were tested (Fig.1 B). Wild type RhoA and RhoACLVL− both failed to interact, confirming that PLD1 specifically interacts with the active form of RhoA. RhoAVal-14CLVL−interacted with PLD1, but the interaction was clearly weaker than that observed with RhoAVal-14, suggesting that geranylgeranylation of RhoA strengthens the interaction with PLD1. An important control for two-hybrid interactions is to demonstrate successful association in vitro. This was addressed by mixing bacterially expressed GST-RhoA with FLAG-D4 in the presence of GDP or GTPγS and precipitating the GST-RhoA using glutathione-Sepharose (Fig. 2). In the presence of GTPγS, FLAG-D4 was readily co-precipitated (lane 4), whereas very little FLAG-D4 was co-precipitated in the presence of GDP (lane 3). GST itself did not interact with FLAG-D4 at all (lanes 1 and 2). Thus, the D4 fragment specifically interacts only with the active form of RhoA in vitro as well. We previously reported that non-geranylgeranylated RhoA does not activate rat brain PLD, whereas geranylgeranylated RhoA does (12Kuribara H. Tago K. Yokozeki T. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Morii N. Narumiya S. Katada T. Kanaho Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25667-25671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which was recently confirmed by Bae et al. (33Bae C.D. Min D.S. Fleming I.N. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11596-11604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The results shown in Figs. 1 B and 2 nonetheless provide evidence that non-geranylgeranylated RhoA interacts with hPLD1a, although seemingly not as well as geranylgeranylated RhoA (Fig. 1 B). These observations, taken together, suggest that the post-translational modification of RhoA plays a role not only in the interaction with PLD1 but also, as a separate event, in the subsequent activation of PLD1. Another important control for two-hybrid interactions is to demonstrate association in a physiological setting. We addressed this by examining interaction of the D4 peptide with RhoA in COS-7 cells. When FLAG-D4 was co-expressed with HA-RhoA or -RhoAVal-14 in COS-7 cells and immunoprecipitated, HA-RhoAVal-14 readily co-immunoprecipitated, whereas there was very little evidence for interaction of FLAG-D4 with wild type RhoA (Fig.3 A, lanes 5 and6 in the upper panel). Equivalent amounts of FLAG-D4 and of RhoA were expressed in each sample, ruling out differences in protein stability or expression as an explanation for the finding (Fig. 3 A, middle andlower panels, respectively). The expression levels of FLAG-D1 and -D2 in COS-7 cells were extremely low as compared with FLAG-D4, which prevented subsequent analysis of their interaction or lack of interaction with RhoA. However, FLAG-D(1+2), which encodes amino acids 1–670 of hPLD1b and is thus complementary to FLAG-D3/D4, was expressed in COS-7 cells to a level comparable with that of FLAG-D4 (Fig. 3 B, middle panel). As anticipated, FLAG-D(1+2) failed to interact with both wild RhoA and RhoAVal-14 (Fig. 3 B, upper panel). These results in a physiological setting strengthen the premise that the PLD1 D4 fragment specifically interacts with the active form of RhoA. Although the results presented thus far conclusively demonstrated an interaction between the D4 peptide and the active form of RhoA, they did not indicate whether ARF or PKC-α might also activate PLD1 through interaction with the C terminus. We addressed this by examining the effects of the D4 peptide on PLD1 stimulation by ARF, RhoA, and PKC-α. The D4 peptide inhibited RhoA-stimulated PLD1 activation in a dose-dependent manner, but not ARF- and PKC-α-stimulated activation (Fig. 4). These results suggest that ARF and PKC-α interact with other regions of PLD1 and also rule out possible sources of nonspecific inhibition that might otherwise represent alternative mechanisms through which the D4 peptide could be causing inhibition of RhoA-mediated activation of PLD1. Various proteins, including Rhofillin, PKN, Rhotekin, PRK2, citron, Rho kinase/p160ROCK/ROK, p140mDia, and myosin-binding subunit, have been identified as downstream effectors for RhoA (34Aelst L.V. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the RhoA-binding domains of Rhofillin, PKN, Rhotekin, and PRK2 share about 50% homology and have therefore been denoted as the RhoA effector motif class 1 (REM-1) (35Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The RhoA-binding motif of the other effectors, termed REM-2, does not share homology with REM-1 (36Fujisawa K. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Saito Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol.

The nature of the interaction of PLD1 with the Rho family GTPases seems to be different from those of the already reported Rho-binding effectors. PLD1 appears to be able to interact with many subsets of Rho family members at the same site, as is inferred from the observation that Rac1 and Cdc42 also activate hPLD1a, and their effects are not synergistic with RhoA or with each other (18Hammond S.M.

These observations suggest that the mechanism employed by the PLD1 RhoA-binding motif is different from that used by REM-1 and REM-2.

https://openalex.org/W2002600260,"Assembly of ternary thrombin-heparin-fibrin complexes, formed when fibrin binds to exosite 1 on thrombin and fibrin-bound heparin binds to exosite 2, produces a 58- and 247-fold reduction in the heparin-catalyzed rate of thrombin inhibition by antithrombin and heparin cofactor II, respectively. The greater reduction for heparin cofactor II reflects its requirement for access to exosite 1 during the inhibitory process. Protection from inhibition by antithrombin and heparin cofactor II requires ligation of both exosites 1 and 2 because minimal protection is seen when exosite 1 variants (γ-thrombin and thrombin Quick 1) or an exosite 2 variant (Arg93 → Ala, Arg97 → Ala, and Arg101 → Ala thrombin) is substituted for thrombin. Likewise, the rate of thrombin inhibition by the heparin-independent inhibitor, α1-antitrypsin Met358 → Arg, is decreased less than 2-fold in the presence of soluble fibrin and heparin. In contrast, thrombin is protected from inhibition by a covalent antithrombin-heparin complex, suggesting that access of heparin to exosite 2 of thrombin is hampered when ternary complex formation occurs. These results reveal the importance of exosites 1 and 2 of thrombin in assembly of the ternary complex and the subsequent protection of thrombin from inhibition by heparin-catalyzed inhibitors.

Catalysis of AT is dependent on a unique pentasaccharide sequence found on about one-third of naturally occurring heparin chains. Pentasaccharide-containing heparin chains bind AT with high affinity and induce a conformational change in the reactive center loop of AT that facilitates its interaction with target proteinases. Whereas this conformational change is sufficient to accelerate the reactivity of AT with factor Xa, inhibition of thrombin is only effected by heparin chains that are of sufficient length to bridge the inhibitor and the proteinase (6Jordan R.E. Oosta G.M. Gardner W.T. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10081-10090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to catalyzing AT, heparin also activates heparin cofactor II (HCII), a naturally occurring serpin whose only target in the coagulation system is thrombin. Heparin-induced catalysis of HCII has been described as a “double bridging” effect because, in addition to the heparin bridge between thrombin and HCII, a second bridge is formed when heparin displaces the acidic amino terminus of HCII which then binds thrombin (7Whinna H.C. Church F.C. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast to AT, HCII does not bind with high affinity to a unique sequence of heparin (8Tollefsen D.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 1209-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Interactions of thrombin with inhibitors and substrates are mediated by positively charged exosites (9Fenton J.W.I. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1988; 14: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 10Stubbs M.T. Bode W. Thromb. Res. 1993; 69: 1-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 11Di Cera E. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 701-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Exosite 1 binds fibrinogen, the fifth and sixth growth factor domains of thrombomodulin, hirudin, and the amino terminus of HCII. As a recognition site, exosite 1 is commonly employed as an initial docking site that orients the substrate or inhibitor with the active site of thrombin (12Jackman M.P. Parry M.A.A. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15375-15383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second positively charged region, exosite 2, is the heparin-binding site. To bridge thrombin to AT or HCII, heparin binds simultaneously to exosite 2 on thrombin and to the serpin (13Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In addition to serving as docking sites, exosites 1 and 2 may also serve allosteric regulatory roles by influencing reactivity of the active site (14Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25493-25499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although heparin is an effective anticoagulant, it has limitations, particularly in patients with acute coronary ischemic syndromes (15Weitz J. Hirsh J. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1993; 122: 364-373PubMed Google Scholar, 16Granger C.B. Becker R. Tracy R.P. Califf R.M. Topol E.J. Pieper K.S. Ross A.M. Roth S. Lambrew C. Bovill E.G. J. Am. Coll.

These limitations have been attributed, at least in part, to the inability of the heparin-AT complex to inactivate thrombin bound to fibrin. Thrombin bound to fibrin remains enzymatically active and is protected from rapid inhibition by plasma inhibitors, in the presence of heparin (19Weitz J.I. Hudoba M. Massel D. Maraganore J. Hirsh J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 20McKenzie C.R. Abendschein D.R. Eisenberg P.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1285-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The basis of this resistance is thought to reflect formation of a ternary thrombin-heparin-fibrin complex wherein thrombin is protected from inactivation by AT (21Hogg P.J. Jackson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3619-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 22Hogg P.J. Jackson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 241-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ternary complex is formed because heparin augments thrombin binding to fibrin, presumably by bridging the protease to fibrin (22Hogg P.J. Jackson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 241-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since thrombin binds fibrin via exosite 1, and heparin binds to thrombin exosite 2, we predicted that both exosites were essential not only for formation of the ternary complex but also for rendering thrombin within the complex resistant to inhibition by AT and other heparin-catalyzed inhibitors. To explore this possibility, we measured the binding of thrombin to immobilized fibrin monomer in the absence or presence of heparin, and we compared thrombin binding with the binding of thrombin variants with impaired exosites 1 or 2. In addition, protection of thrombin from inhibition by AT in the presence of fibrin was examined using the same thrombin variants. We also studied the extent to which thrombin is protected from inactivation by HCII and by α1-antitrypsin Met358 → Arg, inhibitors whose mode of interaction with thrombin differs from that of AT. It was observed that only when both exosites of thrombin are ligated is fibrin-bound thrombin protected from inactivation by either the heparin-AT or heparin-HCII complex. In contrast, fibrin-bound thrombin is susceptible to inhibition by α1-antitrypsin Met358 → Arg even in the presence of heparin suggesting that formation of the ternary thrombin-heparin-fibrin complex does not impair access of macromolecular inhibitors to the active site of the enzyme. The use of a fourth inhibitor, consisting of a covalent complex of heparin and AT (23Chan A. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Klement P. Mitchell L. Baranowski B. Monagle P. Andrew M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22111-22117Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), revealed that accessibility of AT-bound heparin to thrombin within the ternary complex is impaired. Thus, these studies not only elucidate the mechanism of ternary thrombin-fibrin-heparin complex assembly but also explain why thrombin within this complex is protected from inhibition by AT and HCII. Human α-thrombin, γ-thrombin, plasminogen-free fibrinogen, and factor Xa were obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). The naturally occurring thrombin variant Quick 1, with a Cys to Arg mutation at position 67 in exosite 1 (24Henriksen R.A. Mann K.G.

Human plasma AT and HCII were from Affinity Biologicals (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada). The covalent antithrombin-heparin (ATH) complex (23Chan A. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Klement P. Mitchell L.

Thrombin blocked at its active site withd-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone (FPRCK; Calbiochem) was prepared as described previously (14Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25493-25499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The chromogenic thrombin substrate N-ρ-tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-ρ-nitroanilide (tGPR-pNA), hexadimethrine bromide (Polybrene), gelatin-agarose, and Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro-amide (GPRP-NH2) were from Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd. (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Unless otherwise specified, all experiments were performed with heparin with high affinity for AT. High affinity heparin was prepared by affinity chromatography of unfractionated heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa (grade II; Sigma) using an AT-Sepharose column (27Young E. Hirsh J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1990; 64: 559-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Human AT and cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used to prepare the column according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 2–5 mg of AT were immobilized per ml of Sepharose. The column (50 ml bed volume) was equilibrated with 0.05 m Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS). Unfractionated heparin (10 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml of TBS and pumped onto the column at an approximate flow rate of 15 ml/h at 4 °C, followed by another 90 ml of starting buffer. Bound material was eluted with 90 ml of 2.0 m NaCl, collecting 3-ml fractions. The heparin-containing fractions, identified by Alcian blue staining (23Chan A. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Klement P. Mitchell L. Baranowski B. Monagle P. Andrew M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22111-22117Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), were pooled, precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol, dissolved in starting buffer, and reapplied to the re-equilibrated column. After repeating the procedure three times, the final product was dissolved in 0.15 m NaCl, and its concentration was determined using a protamine sulfate turbidometric assay (28Hatton M.W.C. Berry L. Regoeczi E. Thromb. Res. 1978; 13: 655-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The high affinity heparin prepared in this way had a specific activity of 280 anti-Xa units/mg when compared with the 1st International Unfractionated Heparin Standard and had an average molecular mass of 15,000 Da, as determined by high pressure liquid chromatography (29Cosmi B. Fredenburgh J.C. Rischke J. Hirsh J. Young E. Weitz J.I. Circulation. 1997; 95: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Plasminogen-free human fibrinogen was subjected to gelatin-agarose adsorption to remove fibronectin. Approximately 15 ml of fibrinogen (∼130 μm) was mixed in a tube for 30 min with 5 ml of gelatin-agarose. After centrifugation for 10 min, the supernatant was removed and exposed a second time to a new aliquot of gelatin-agarose. The fibrinogen concentration in the supernatant was determined using a molecular weight of 340,000 and by measuring the absorbance using ε2801% of 15.1 (21Hogg P.J. Jackson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3619-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) after correction for light scatter at 320 nm using the relationship A280corr =A 280 − 1.7 × A 320(30Bloom J.W. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4419-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Soluble fibrin (SF) was prepared by clotting fibrinogen (60–100 μm) at 37 °C for 4–6 h with 2 nm thrombin (21Hogg P.J. Jackson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3619-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The resultant fibrin was sedimented by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min and transferred to dialysis tubing (12,000–14,000 molecular weight cut-off, 2.5 cm wide). After dialysis against distilled water (>200 volume) at 4 °C overnight to remove fibrinopeptides A and B, the material was dialyzed against 20 mm acetic acid for approximately 8 h until dissolved. A molecular weight of 340,000 and ε2801% value of 14.0 was used to calculate the SF concentration (31Lewis S.D. Janus T.J. Lorand L. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6772-6777Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), which was typically about 100 μm. Aliquots were stored at −70 °C. Prior to use, SF was neutralized with 40% v/v 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and polymerization was blocked by the addition of 5 mmGPRP-NH2 (32Kawasaki K. Hirase K. Miyano M. Tsuji T. Iwamoto M. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1992; 40: 3253-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Approximately 35 mg of fibrinogen was coupled to 3 ml of cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose, as described above for AT. To block unreacted amino groups, the resin was packed in a small column (0.7 × 9 cm) and washed over 2 h with 15 ml of coupling buffer and then with 10 ml of TBS. Finally, the washed resin was removed from the column and diluted 1:2 with TBS, and the immobilized fibrinogen was converted to fibrin monomer (FM) by addition of thrombin at a final concentration of 2 nm. After 3 h incubation with gentle end-over-end mixing in a 15-ml conical tube at room temperature (33Heene D.L. Matthias F.R. Thromb. Res. 1973; 2: 137-154Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the FM-Sepharose was transferred to a column (0.7 × 9 cm) and washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl (10 volumes) followed by TBS (10 volumes). The amount of FM conjugated to the Sepharose was determined by performing a BCA Protein Assay (Pierce) on an aliquot of the FM-Sepharose using fibrinogen as the standard and unconjugated Sepharose as a blank. The rates of inactivation of (a) thrombin, γ-thrombin, Quick 1 dysthrombin, or RA-thrombin by AT, HCII, or α1-antitrypsin Met358 → Arg and (b) factor Xa by AT were measured discontinuously under pseudo first-order rate conditions (13Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) in the absence or presence of heparin, or SF, or both. Either thrombin (20 nm), factor Xa (60 nm), or a thrombin variant (20–60 nm) was incubated for 5 min at room temperature in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.6% PEG 8000, pH 7.4 (TSP), containing 10 mmGPRP-NH2 and various concentrations of heparin (0–100 μm) and SF (0–12 μm). Reaction mixtures were aliquoted to 96-well round bottom microtiter plates (Fisher, Nepean, Ontario, Canada), and an equal volume of inhibitor (in a concentration at least 10-fold higher than that of the proteinase) was added to each well at time intervals ranging from 2 s to 10 min. Reactions were terminated simultaneously by the addition of 200 μl of a solution containing 222 μm tGPR-pNA and 10 mg/ml Polybrene, and residual proteinase activity was determined by the initial rate of substrate hydrolysis measured at 405 nm using a Spectra Max 340 Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). The pseudo first-order rate constant of inhibition was calculated by fitting the data to the first-order rate Equation 1.Vt/Vo=e−k1tEquation 1 where V o represents proteinase activity at time = 0; V t represents proteinase activity at time = t, and k 1represents the pseudo first-order rate constant. The apparent second-order rate constant (k 2) of inhibition was then obtained by dividing k 1 by the inhibitor concentration (13Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). When high concentrations of heparin were used, the rates of proteinase inactivation were too fast to be measured under these conditions. To circumvent this problem, reactions were done in the presence of tGPR-pNA, which serves as a competitive inhibitor (34Griffith M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7360-7365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To correct for the presence of chromogenic substrate, the pseudo first-order rate constant of inhibition was given by Equation 2.k1=kapp×(1+[S]/Km)Equation 2 where k app is the apparent pseudo first-order rate constant, [S] is the concentration of competitor, and K m is the Michaelis-Menten constant of the proteinase for tGPR-pNA (13Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). TheK m values of thrombin and factor Xa for tGPR-pNA were determined to be 14 and 34 μm, respectively. In experiments where SF reduced the rate of proteinase inactivation, fold inhibition was calculated by dividing thek 2 value in the absence of SF by that measured in its presence. Inhibition of thrombin in the presence of ATH was determined by continuous assay of thrombin activity, monitored by cleavage of a fluorescent substrate. A 2-ml solution containing 18 nm ATH and 50 μmmethoxysuccinyl-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (AFC-67, Enzyme System Products, Dublin, CA) in TBS was incubated at room temperature with stirring in a 3-ml quartz cuvette. Fluorescence (λex 400 nm and λem 505 nm; slit widths 10 nm) was monitored at 0.5-s intervals in a Perkin-Elmer LS 50B spectrofluorimeter. SF and heparin were added, alone or in combination, to the cuvette at final concentrations of 4 μm and 500 nm, respectively. Finally, thrombin was added to a final concentration of 2 nm. Plots of I 505 versus time were analyzed by nonlinear least squares analysis of Equation 3 (25Ye J. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17965-17970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).It=(Imax/k1)(1−e−k1t)Equation 3 where k 1 and I max, the maximal rate of fluorescence change, were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using TableCurve (Jandel, San Rafael, CA). The chromogenic activity of 5 nmthrombin in TSP was determined with 185 μmtGPR-pNA in the presence of various concentrations of GPRP-NH2 (0.5–25 mm) or SF (1–6 μm) in 96-well round bottom microtiter plates. The initial rates of substrate hydrolysis, measured as the change in absorbance at 405 nm per min, were determined over 10 min using a microplate reader and were compared with the activity of thrombin in the absence of GPRP-NH2 and SF. Chromogenic substrate reactions were performed in 96-well round bottom microtiter plates in TSP at room temperature. Solutions of 5 nm thrombin, γ-thrombin, or RA-thrombin, SF (0 or 4 μm), 5 mm GPRP-NH2, and heparin (0 or 500 nm) were mixed and then added to a range of tGPR-pNA concentrations (0–250 μm). The initial rates of substrate hydrolysis were determined by monitoring the reaction at 405 nm using a microplate reader and were plottedversus tGPR-pNA concentration. The data were then analyzed by nonlinear regression of the Michaelis-Menten Equation4V=(Vmax)×(S)/(Km+S)Equation 4 to solve for K m, the Michaelis-Menten constant, and V max, the maximum rate of substrate hydrolysis, given V, the rate of substrate hydrolysis, and S, the substrate concentration. Binding studies were carried out in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.6% PEG 8000, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.4, at room temperature in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes (Rose Scientific, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) in total volumes of 500 μl. FM-Sepharose (50 μl; 1.4 μmfinal FM concentration) was mixed with thrombin, γ-thrombin, or RA-thrombin (100 nm final concentration) in the absence or presence of various concentrations of unfractionated heparin (25 nm to 15 μm final concentration). After mixing for 2 min, FM-agarose was sedimented by centrifugation for 1 min in a microcentrifuge at 15,000 × g. An aliquot of each supernatant was transferred to a 96-well round bottom microtiter plate, and a solution of 222 μm tGPR-pNA and 10 mg/ml Polybrene was added simultaneously to each well. Hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate was monitored by measuring the increase in absorbance at 405 nm over time using a plate reader. The quantity of thrombin bound to FM-Sepharose was calculated by subtracting the thrombin activity in the supernatant from a control measurement of thrombin activity in the absence of FM-Sepharose. Thrombin activity was converted to thrombin concentration using the specific activity of thrombin, determined under these conditions. All values reported represent the mean ± S.D. of at least two separate experiments, each done in duplicate. To quantify the consequences of ternary thrombin-heparin-fibrin complex formation, the influence of SF on thrombin inactivation by AT was determined in the absence or presence of 100 nm heparin (Fig.1 A). SF produced a concentration-dependent and saturable decrease in the heparin-catalyzed rate of inactivation of thrombin. In the presence of 100 nm heparin, the addition of 6 μm SF decreased k 2 by a factor of 50, from a value of 2.97 ± 1.01 × 108 to 6.04 ± 1.20 × 106m−1 min−1. Half-maximal reduction in k 2 occurred with approximately 25 nm SF. With 10 nm heparin, 6 μm SF had slightly less of an inhibitory effect, causing a 41-fold reduction in k 2 at 6 μmSF (not shown). Hogg and Jackson (21Hogg P.J. Jackson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3619-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) observed a 310-fold reduction at 10 nm heparin. These differences could reflect the fact that the high affinity heparin used in the present studies had lower specific activity. In the absence of heparin, less than a 2-fold reduction in the rate of thrombin inhibition occurred when SF was present at concentrations up to 6 μm. In parallel experiments, the heparin dose-response for thrombin inhibition was determined in the presence of 4 μm SF (Fig. 1 B). With all concentrations of heparin tested, SF reduced the heparin-catalyzed rate of thrombin inactivation by AT. A maximal reduction in the rate of thrombin inhibition of 58-fold occurred with 100 nm heparin. In addition to a persistent reduction in k 2, 4 μm SF also altered the shape of the heparin titration curve. The heparin dose-response curve is biphasic in the absence of SF, characteristic of a surface approximation phenomenon (13Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 34Griffith M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7360-7365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of SF, there is a saturable increase in k 2 with a significantly lower maximal rate of inhibition. This result suggests that SF alters the mechanism of thrombin inactivation by the AT-heparin complex. As a control experiment, the rates of thrombin inactivation in the absence and presence of both 10 nm heparin and 4 μm SF were determined over a range of AT concentrations (not shown). As predicted, varying AT concentration from 50 to 500 nm (the range of AT concentrations used in our studies) had no effect on k 2 because calculations take the inhibitor concentration into account (13Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). As further controls, the effects of SF or GPRP-NH2 on the chromogenic activity of thrombin for tGPR-pNA were examined. The presence of SF up to 6 μm or GPRP-NH2 up to 25 mmhad no effect on the rate of tGPR-pNA hydrolysis by thrombin (data not shown). Furthermore, the effect of GPRP-NH2 on the heparin-catalyzed and uncatalyzed rates of thrombin inactivation by AT were determined to ensure that the decreases in rates were not caused by the peptide. GPRP-NH2, at concentrations up to 5 mm, caused a less than 2-fold reduction ink 2 (data not shown). To account for this small effect, 5 mm GPRP-NH2 was present in all reactions, even when the sample did not contain SF. To examine directly the effect of SF on the catalytic activity of heparin, factor Xa was substituted for thrombin. Since factor Xa binds neither heparin nor fibrin, only the heparin-fibrin interaction would remain. As with thrombin, a range of SF concentrations had no effect on the uncatalyzed rate of factor Xa inhibition by AT. In contrast to thrombin, SF produced only a modest dose-dependent reduction in the rate of factor Xa inhibition in the presence of 10 or 100 nm heparin (not shown). At 10 nm heparin, 4 μm SF reducedk 2 by a factor of 6 (from a value of 4.70 ± 0.90 × 106 to 7.63 ± 1.0 × 105m−1 min−1) with half-maximal inhibition occurring at approximately 0.4 μmSF. With 100 nm heparin, SF reduced the rate constant only 2-fold. The relatively small magnitude of these inhibitory effects suggests that the heparin-SF interaction does not compromise the ability of heparin to catalyze AT to any appreciable extent. The influence of SF on the heparin-catalyzed and uncatalyzed rates of thrombin inactivation by HCII was examined because, unlike AT which interacts solely with the active site of thrombin, the amino-terminal region of HCII requires an additional interaction with thrombin exosite 1 (35Hortin G.

Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 424-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed by varying the concentrations of each of the following three components: SF, heparin, and HCII. Similar to AT, SF caused a dose-dependent and saturable decrease in the heparin-catalyzed rates of thrombin inactivation by HCII, although the magnitude of the effect was much greater (Fig. 2 A). In contrast to the 50-fold reduction in the rate of thrombin inactivation by AT in the presence of 100 nm heparin, 6 μm SF reduced the heparin-catalyzed rate of HCII by 222-fold (from 2.14 ± 0.05 × 108 to 9.64 ± 4.49 × 105m−1 min−1). Half-maximal inhibition occurred at approximately 5 nm SF. When the heparin concentration was reduced from 100 to 10 nm, the inhibitory effect of S"

These results are discussed in light of the current models of actin structure. Profilin is a remarkable actin-binding protein. This small (15-kDa), ubiquitous, essential protein binds monomeric (G) actin in a 1:1 molar ratio (1Carlsson L. Nyström L.-E. Sundkvist I. Markey F. Lindberg U. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 115: 465-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Although the profilin-actin complex is unable to spontaneously nucleate actin filaments, it can productively associate with the barbed ends specifically (2Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6631-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 3Pring M. Weber A. Bubb M.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1827-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This unique property confers a dual function to profilin, depending on the capping of barbed ends. When barbed ends are blocked by capping proteins, profilin sequesters G-actin. In contrast, in motile regions of the cell where uncapped barbed ends are actively elongating, the profilin-actin complex can actively participate in filament growth. The profilin-MgATP-actin complex (PA) 1The abbreviations used are: PA, profilin-MgATP-actin complex; NBD, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzene-2-oxa-1,3-diazole, EDC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide; S1, myosin subfragment-1. can therefore be considered as an end-specific quasipolymerizable actin monomer. Recent results (4Didry D. Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25602-25611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) show that this property of profilin is used to enhance the processivity of treadmilling (i.e. steady-state barbed end assembly)in the presence of actin depolymerizing factor. In the mechanism that was proposed based on thermodynamic data (5Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 6Perelroizen I. Didry D. Christensen H. Chua N.-H. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12302-12309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), F-actin assembly from profilin-actin is possible only because of its coupling to ATP hydrolysis, as follows. Profilin-actin associates with the barbed end; the interaction of profilin with actin is weakened once the actin-bound ATP has been hydrolyzed; profilin then dissociates from that end, thus promoting the incorporation of one actin subunit in the filament and regenerating a free barbed end available for further growth from PA. Profilin is reused at each cycle and works as a catalyzer of assembly. While polymerization of actin alone proceeds in a manner uncoupled from ATP hydrolysis (7Pollard T.D. Weeds A.G. FEBS Lett. 1984; 170: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 8Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. Korn E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9983-9986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these two reactions are proposed to occur in a compulsory order when actin filaments grow from profilin-actin units. In this paper, the proposed mechanism of barbed end growth from profilin-actin is challenged by kinetic experiments. Understanding the kinetics of filament assembly from profilin-actin in depth also has implications concerning the structure of the filament. In the atomic model of the actin filament proposed by Holmes et al. (9Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar) and refined by Lorenz et al. (10Lorenz M. Popp D. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 826-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), the profilin interaction area on actin is exposed at the barbed end, accounting for the association of profilin-actin to a growing barbed end, but not to a pointed end. Hence, within Holmes' model, it is anticipated that profilin can cap the barbed ends. On the other hand, examination of the actin-actin contacts in the crystals of the profilin-actin complex (11Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C.W. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) shows evidence for a nonhelical ribbon structure of the profilin-actin complex, in which extensive actin-actin contacts, however different from those present in the Lorenz et al. atomic model of the actin filament (10Lorenz M. Popp D. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 826-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) are involved. It was proposed (12Schutt C.E. Rozycki M.D. Myslik J.C. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 186-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 13Chik J.K. Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 607-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) that barbed end growth from profilin-actin could involve the transient extension of profilin-ATP-actin ribbons. The transition from ribbon to filament would be coupled to ATP hydrolysis and dissociation of profilin. According to this model, the profilin-actin ribbon would exist in solution only in the ATP- or ADP-Pi-bound form, and the orientation of the actin monomer in the filament derived from the ribbon would be different from the Holmes atomic model. In the present work, we first determined the rate parameters for barbed end elongation from profilin-actin using a turbidimetric method. We next attempted to find conditions under which profilin-actin would undergo spontaneous self-assembly, with the goal to characterize the profilin-actin polymer. The EDC-cross-linked profilin-actin complex appears able to polymerize into filaments, which exhibit the same helical structure and same thermodynamic stability as native F-actin filaments. Profilin-actin filaments therefore provide a tool to probe the structure of the actin filament and the interface of actin with other actin-binding proteins. Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder (14Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and isolated as CaATP-G-actin through Sephadex G-200 chromatography (15McLean-Fletcher S. Pollard T.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) in G buffer (5 mmTris/Cl−, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% NaN3, pH 7.8). MgATP-G-actin (<20 μm) was prepared by incubation of CaATP-G-actin with 0.2 mm EGTA and 1 mol eq plus 10 μm excess MgCl2 for 3 min and used immediately afterward. MgATP-G-actin was polymerized by the addition of 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.1m KCl. CaATP-G-actin was polymerized by the addition of 0.1m KCl. Actin was NBD-labeled (16Detmers P. Weber A. Elzinga M. Stephens R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 99-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spectrin-actin seeds were prepared from human erythrocytes, and their molar concentration was determined as described (17Casella J.F. Maack D.J. Lin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10915-10921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by titration by gelsolin. Gelsolin-actin seeds were prepared at a 2 μmconcentration by incubation of 2 μm human plasma gelsolin (a generous gift from Dr. Yukio Doi) with 4.2 μmCaATP-G-actin in G buffer. Profilin was isolated from bovine spleen by poly(l-proline) affinity chromatography (18Perelroizen I. Marchand J.-B. Blanchoin L. Didry D. Carlier M.-F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8472-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). S1(A1) and S1(A2) isoforms of chymotryptic myosin subfragment-1 were resolved by SP-trisacryl chromatography (19Fievez S. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11837-11842Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were carried out at 20 °C using a Spex Fluorolog 2 spectrofluorimeter at the following wavelengths: NBD-actin, λexc 475 nm and λem 530 nm; rhodamine-phalloidin, λexc 530 nm and λem575 nm; tryptophan fluorescence, λexc 295 nm and λem 330 nm. Turbidity measurements were performed at 20 °C at 310 nm using a Cary 1 Varian spectrophotometer with 1-cm path cuvettes. All solutions were thoroughly filtered and degassed before the experiment. Initial rates of filament growth were measured using turbidity or NBD fluorescence. Spectrin-actin seeds were used to initiate elongation at the barbed end (20Schafer D.A. Jennings P.B. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), while gelsolin-actin seeds initiated elongation at the pointed end. At time 0, MgATP-G-actin (or CaATP-G-actin), in the absence or presence of profilin or profilin-actin covalent complex, was supplemented simultaneously with seeds and salts, and the time course of assembly was recorded. The actin concentrations were chosen so that the spontaneous nucleation could be neglected. The rate of barbed end growth J at a given total concentration of G-actin ([Ao]) and in the presence of different total amounts [Po] of profilin was monitored turbidimetrically. Data were analyzed as follows,J=[S](k+A[A]+k+PA[PA])Equation 1 with [Ao] = [A] + [PA]. In Equation 1, [S] is the concentration of spectrin-actin seeds; [A] and [PA] are the concentrations of free and profilin-bound G-actin; and k+A and k+PA are the corresponding barbed end association rate constants. The contribution of the off rates was neglected in equation 1 because measurements were carried out at actin concentrations well above the critical concentration. The change inJ as the concentration [Po[ of profilin was increased reflected the increase in the contribution of PA to barbed end assembly as G-actin was gradually saturated by profilin. The concentration of PA was calculated as follows,[PA]=[Po]+[Ao]+KPA−([Po]+[Ao]+KPA)2−4[Po]·[Ao]2Equation 2 where K PA represents the equilibrium dissociation constant for profilin-actin. Measurements of J in absorbance units/s were converted in μm assembled F-actin/s using a critical concentration calibration curve as described previously (21Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), from which the polymerization of 1 μm F-actin led to an increase of 0.0017 absorbance units at 310 nm (1-cm optical path). Combining Equations 1 and 2 led to the expression of J as a function of [Po], [Ao], andK PA. Analysis of the data within this expression led to the determinations of k+A(from the measurement of J in the absence of profilin), k+PA (from the measurement ofJ in the presence of saturating amounts of profilin), andK PA, by adjustment of the theoretical curve to the data at different concentrations of profilin. The rate of barbed end growth was also measured at different concentrations of G-actin and either in the absence or in the presence of saturating amounts of profilin (i.e. 1 mol eq of G-actin plus an excess of 5 μm bovine profilin or of 30 μm Arabidopsis thaliana profilin 3 (6Perelroizen I. Didry D. Christensen H. Chua N.-H. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12302-12309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar)). The resulting J(c) plots for actin and profilin-actin were used to derive the values of k+B for actin or profilin-actin and of the critical concentrations C c for polymerization, as follows.J=[S](k+BC−Cc)Equation 3 All experiments were performed using freshly prepared G-actin in G buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol to be sure that Cys374 was thoroughly reduced, so that all of the actin in the preparation was able to bind profilin with high affinity. We reasoned that if a very small proportion of G-actin was oxidized, it would give rise to spontaneous polymerization at high actin concentrations even in the presence of an excess of profilin. Therefore, where appropriate, the spontaneous polymerization measured in the absence of seeds was subtracted from the data. The cross-linking of Glu364 of actin to Lys125 of bovine profilin (which corresponds to Lys115 ofAcanthamoeba profilin) was performed using EDC as described (22Vandekerckhove J.S. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 23Combeau C. Didry D. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14038-14046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, actin was dialyzed at 4 °C versus 2 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm CaCl2 buffer (pH 7.8); profilin was prepared in 5 mm HEPES, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm CaCl2 buffer (pH 7.8). Samples were brought to 20 °C. Actin (15 μm, 60 ml) was activated with 2 mm EDC and 2 mmsulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide for 20 min at pH 6.5. 20 μmprofilin and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol were then added, the pH was adjusted to 7.8, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min before it was quenched by 10 mm glycine. The yield of the cross-link was about 15% (Fig. 1, inset, lane a). The mixture obtained at the end of the cross-linking reaction was first loaded on a DEAE-cellulose column (DE52; Whatman; 2.5-cm diameter, 10-cm length) equilibrated in DEAE buffer (5 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, pH 7.8) (Fig.1). Free profilin was recovered in the flow-through. Following a wash step with one column volume of DEAE buffer supplemented with 50 mm NaCl (Fig. 1, inset, lane b), the mixture of free actin and covalent profilin-actin complex was eluted with DEAE buffer containing 250 mm NaCl (Fig. 1, inset, lane c). The eluate was applied to a poly(l-proline)-agarose column (1.5-cm diameter, 12-cm length) equilibrated in PLP buffer (10 mmTris/Cl−, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 m glycine, 0.1 m KCl, pH 7.8). Free actin was recovered in the flow-through (Fig. 1,inset, lane d), and profilin-actin covalent complex was then eluted with PLP buffer containing 30% Me2SO, according to the procedure used for isolation of profilactin complex (24Rozycki M. Schutt C.E. Lindberg U. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 100-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The eluted complex was rapidly concentrated to about 30 μm by ultrafiltration over a Diaflo PM30 membrane in a 100-ml Amicon cell, dialyzed against G buffer, and centrifuged at 400,000 × g for 45 min. The covalent complex obtained at this stage was at least 90% pure as juged by SDS gel electrophoresis and appeared able to self-assemble reversibly upon the addition of salt. The capacity of covalent profilin-actin to undergo self-assembly declined with time following isolation of the complex. About 70% of the covalent profilin-actin complex that eluted from poly(l-proline)-agarose was polymerizable on day 1. This proportion declined by 2-fold within 2 weeks. A cycle of polymerization was added as a final step of the purification of covalent profilin-actin, as follows. The solution of covalent PA was incubated with 0.2 mm EGTA and 40 μm MgCl2 for 3 min and then overnight with 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 m KCl at room temperature. The solution was centrifuged at 400,000 ×g for 45 min. The pellet, which typically contained about 70% of initial PAcov, was resuspended and dialyzed against G buffer for 24 h, with a brief sonication after 16 h. The solution was again centrifuged at 400,000 × g for 45 min. No visible pellet was found. The supernatant consisted of pure covalent profilin-actin (Fig. 1,inset, lane e). About 2.5 mg of covalent profilin-actin complex were obtained, corresponding to 7% of the initially reacted actin. This material was used within a week. Small amounts of oligomers of high molecular mass, occasionally present after the cross-link, were eliminated in the purification steps (compare lanes a and e). Several independent preparations of covalent profilin-actin complex yielded a material that behaved in a reproducible fashion in the different experiments. The concentration of the covalent profilin-actin complex was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad reagent) using G-actin as a standard. Profilin-actin covalent complex (1.5 μm) in G buffer was first converted into MgATP-bound PAcov by incubation with EGTA and MgCl2 as described above for G-actin and was induced to polymerize by the addition of 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mKCl at 20 °C. At different times of the polymerization process, 4-μl aliquots of the sample were deposited on air glow-discharged carbon coated grids. Following adsorption to the grid for 10 s, the specimens were negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate and observed in a CM12 (Philips) electron microscope. Electron micrographs taken at a 35,000-fold magnification on electron image plates (Eastman Kodak Co.) were developed for 5 min in full-strength D19 developer (Kodak). Images were selected according to the quality of their optical diffraction pattern (no astigmatism, defocus value in the range 0.5–1 μm, presence of the first and sixth layer lines). Images were digitized with a rotating drum microdensitometer (Optronics P-1000) using a scan raster of 25 μm. The filaments were straightened and cut to a length corresponding to 4–7 axial repeats and a width slightly larger than the diameter. The axial repeat is typically equal to 36.5 nm. The mean value of the densities surrounding the filaments was subtracted from the images, which were floated in 512 × 512 arrays. Fourier transforms were calculated. They were characterized by the presence of three layer lines (ll0, ll1, and ll6), which can be indexed by the selection rule l = −6n + 13m. Actin or PAcov complex in G buffer was freed from ATP by Dowex-1 treatment (25Mockrin S.C. Korn E.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5359-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), polymerized at 5 μm, and split into samples supplemented with 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 20 μm S1(A1). Samples were centrifuged 15 min later at 400,000 × g for 10 min at 20 °C in the TL 100 Beckman ultracentrifuge. Pellets were resuspended in the original volume of G buffer. Supernatants and resuspended pellets were submitted to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue-stained. Actomyosin MgATPase activity of myosin subfragment-1 was measured in the presence of 17 μmF-actin or F-PAcov and 1 μmS1(A1) at 20 °C in a buffer containing 5 mm Tris/Cl−, pH 7.8, 0.1 m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmγ-32P-labeled ATP. The reaction was started by the addition of S1(A1). Aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed from the solution at 30-s intervals; brought into 1 n HCl, 10 mm ammonium molybdate; and processed for 32Pi extraction as described (8Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. Korn E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9983-9986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actin or PAcov was polymerized overnight at 1 μm in the presence of 0.05m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 μm tetramethyl rhodamine-phalloidin. In vitromotility assays were conducted using whole myosin tethered to monoclonal antibodies (anti LMM 5C3–2) immobilized onto a nitrocellulose-coated glass coverslip, as described (26Winkelmann D.A. Bourdieu L. Ott A. Kinose F. Libchaber A. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2444-2453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The rhodamine-phalloidin filaments were diluted to 3–5 nm in motility buffer (25 mm imidazole, 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 7.5 mm ATP, 0.1% methylcellulose, pH 7.6) supplemented with oxygen scavengers. Observations were made on a Zeiss microscope using a 100× Plan Apochromat objective equipped with epifluorescence optics. Images of moving filaments were recorded with a SVHS video recorder. Since profilin binds derivatized actin very poorly (27Malm B. FEBS Lett. 1984; 173: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the conventional method using the increase in fluorescence of N-pyrenyl-carboxyamidomethyl- or NBD-labeled actin as a probe of polymerization is inadequate in its presence. Turbidimetry, which has proven useful to monitor actin polymerization in the case of ADF/cofilin (21Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), was used. The initial rate of barbed end assembly from spectrin-actin seeds was measured at a given G-actin concentration and in the presence of increasing amounts of profilin. Fig.2 a shows that when filament barbed ends elongated from CaATP-G-actin subunits, profilin inhibited the growth in a concentration-dependent fashion. Total inhibition of growth was observed at saturation by profilin. Data, analyzed as described under “Materials and Methods,” indicate that profilin binds CaATP-G-actin with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 1.2 ± 0.2 μm and that the profilin-CaATP-actin complex does not participate in barbed end assembly. Preassembled F-actin (5 μm) was also used to measure barbed end growth in the presence of 5 μm CaATP-G-actin, either in the absence or presence of 20 μm profilin. Turbidity increased in the absence of profilin, demonstrating active barbed end growth, but decreased when profilin was added together with G-actin. 70% depolymerization of the F-actin seeds was observed within 5 min. In conclusion, in the presence of CaATP-actin, profilin acts as a pure G-actin-sequestering protein. In particular, it does not cap the barbed ends. In contrast, when barbed ends elongated from MgATP-G-actin subunits, profilin caused only a partial (40%) inhibition of growth. The data (Fig. 2 a) are quantitatively consistent with the view that profilin binds MgATP-G-actin with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 0.1 μm, and the profilin-MgATP-actin complex associates productively with the barbed ends of actin filaments. At saturation by profilin, filaments grew from profilin-actin units exclusively, at a rate 40% lower than from MgG-actin alone. No further inhibition was observed at concentration of profilin as high as 100 μm, again indicating no detectable capping of the barbed ends by profilin. In conclusion, in the presence of CaATP-actin, profilin acts as a pure G-actin-sequestering protein. In contrast, the complex of profilin with MgATP-actin participates in barbed end assembly. The different behaviors of profilin-Ca-actin and profilin-Mg-actin are in agreement with the conclusion of previous works (5Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 6Perelroizen I. Didry D. Christensen H. Chua N.-H. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12302-12309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) that the effective participation of profilin-actin in barbed end growth required ATP hydrolysis to be coupled to polymerization, a condition that was fulfilled for profilin-Mg-actin but not for profilin-Ca-actin. The hydrolysis of ATP during polymerization of profilin-Mg-actin was measured at a high concentration (46 μmMg-[γ-32P]ATP-G-actin 1:1 complex plus 60 μm profilin). A short sonication was applied immediately after the addition of salt to enhance the rate of polymerization by fragmentation. Filament assembly showed a short lag followed by a rapid increase in light scattering (complete in less than 1 min). ATP was hydrolyzed in a manner that showed no detectable uncoupling from polymerization. However, a definite proof that elongation is coupled to hydrolysis requires the demonstration that the rate of elongation be kinetically limited at high concentration by the rate of ATP hydrolysis. The rate constants for profilin-MgATP-actin association to and dissociation from the barbed ends can be derived from the analysis of the dependence of the rate of filament growth on profilin-actin concentration (J(c) plot; Ref. 8Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. Korn E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9983-9986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The J(c) plots for Mg-actin and profilin-Mg-actin (Fig. 2 b) were derived from growth rate measurements using spectrin-actin seeds. The values found for the association rate constants were 4.9 ± 0.5 μm−1s1 for Mg-actin, in agreement with Pollard and Mooseker (28Pollard T.D. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and 3.5 ± 0.4 μm−1s−1 for profilin-Mg-actin. The rate constants for MgATP-actin and profilin-MgATP-actin dissociation from the barbed ends were derived from the ordinate intercepts of the plots. Values of 0.6 ± 0.2 s−1 and 1 ± 0.3 s−1were found for actin and profilin-actin, respectively. In other words, when barbed ends are actively elongating from profilin-actin as well as from G-actin subunits, terminal subunits dissociate at a rate 1 order of magnitude lower than the rate of dissociation of ADP-F-actin (8 s−1). In conclusion, the present kinetic data rule out a simple model for barbed end growth from profilin-actin, according to which actin incorporation and profilin release from the barbed end would be tightly coupled to Pi release, as described in Fig. 7 (Scheme I). In this scheme, the dissociation rate constant measured in a regime of growth is the dissociation rate constant of ADP-actin, k D. The resultingJ(c) plot for profilin-actin would then be a straight line with an ordinate intercept equal tok D, and the critical concentration (abscissa intercept) would be 1 order of magnitude higher than the experimentally observed value of 0.3 μm. In a range of high concentrations of profilin-actin, theJ(c) plot deviated from linearity and curved downward (Fig. 2 b, inset), indicating that the association of profilin-actin units to barbed ends was rate-limited by another reaction. We propose this reaction to be ATP hydrolysis, since this feature appears to be characteristic of the barbed end growth from profilin-actin and was not observed when the elongation from G-actin was measured. Quantitatively identical data were obtained with bovine profilin and A. thaliana profilin 3 (compare open circles and closed diamonds in Fig.2 b, inset). When observed in electron microscopy, filaments assembled from profilin-actin units displayed a structure strictly identical to those assembled from unliganded actin. No profilin was detected in the pellets of sedimented filaments. Efforts were made to detect nonhelical ribbon-like extensions of filaments that might be transiently formed at the barbed ends in regimes of rapid growth. At very high G-actin concentration, ATP hydrolysis is known to be more largely uncoupled from F-actin assembly (7Pollard T.D. Weeds A.G. FEBS Lett. 1984; 170: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 29Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3052-3059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), hence profilin might remain transiently bound to F-ATP-actin stretches, possibly in a ribbon-like structure (12Schutt C.E. Rozycki M.D. Myslik J.C. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 186-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Specimens undergoing rapid assembly at high concentrations of profilin-actin were rapidly observed in the initial stages of the reaction. No structural difference was seen between the core and the end-proximal regions of the filaments assembled from profilin-actin. The possibility that the ATP-bound profilin-actin ribbon at the tip of the growing filament was too small to be detectable by EM cannot be discarded. Finally, [BeF3−,H2O], a structural analog of Pi that binds to F-ADP-actin filaments and reconstitutes the intermediate state in ATP hydrolysis on F-actin (30Combeau C. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17429-17436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used to"
https://openalex.org/W1985189094,"Adhesion of platelets to sites of vascular injury is critical for hemostasis and thrombosis and is dependent on the binding of the vascular adhesive protein von Willebrand factor (vWf) to the glycoprotein (GP) Ib-V-IX complex on the platelet surface. A unique but poorly defined characteristic of this receptor/ligand interaction is its ability to support platelet adhesion under conditions of high shear stress. To examine the structural domains of the GPIb-V-IX complex involved in mediating cell adhesion under flow, we have expressed partial (GPIb-IX), complete (GPIb-V-IX), and mutant (GPIbα cytoplasmic tail mutants) receptor complexes on the surface of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and examined their ability to adhere to a vWf matrix in flow-based adhesion assays. Our studies demonstrate that the partial receptor complex (GPIb-IX) supports CHO cell tethering and rolling on a bovine or human vWf matrix under flow. The adhesion was specifically inhibited by an anti-GPIbα blocking antibody (AK2) and was not observed with CHO cells expressing GPIbβ and GPIX alone. The velocity of rolling was dependent on the level of shear stress, receptor density, and matrix concentration and was not altered by the presence of GPV. In contrast to selectins, which mediate cell rolling under conditions of low shear (20–200 s−1), GPIb-IX was able to support cell rolling at both venous (150 s−1) and arterial (1500–10,500 s−1) shear rates. Studies with a mutant GPIbα receptor subunit lacking the binding domain for actin-binding protein demonstrated that the association of the receptor complex with the membrane skeleton is not essential for cell tethering or rolling under low shear conditions, but is critical for maintaining adhesion at high shear rates (3000–6000 s−1). These studies demonstrate that the GPIb-IX complex is sufficient to mediate cell rolling on a vWf matrix at both venous and arterial levels of shear independent of other platelet adhesion receptors. Furthermore, our results suggest that the association between GPIbα and actin-binding protein plays an important role in enabling cells to remain tethered to a vWf matrix under conditions of high shear stress.

Cell/cell and cell/matrix adhesive interactions are fundamental to a broad range of physiological processes, including inflammation, immunity, and hemostasis. The ability of circulating cells, such as leukocytes and platelets, to adhere to the vessel wall requires specialized adhesion mechanisms capable of withstanding the mechanical challenge of flowing blood. The mechanism by which leukocytes adhere to the vascular endothelium is the paradigm for cell adhesion under flow. This is a multistep process in which the initial interaction of these cells with the endothelium involves selectin-mediated leukocyte rolling. This interaction serves to reduce the velocity of cell movement over the endothelium and increases the probability of forming irreversible stationary adhesion contacts between leukocyte β2-integrins and ICAM-1 (intercellularadhesion molecule 1) on the endothelial cell surface (1Lawrence M.B. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 859-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar, 2Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6400) Google Scholar). A similar multistep adhesion mechanism has recently been proposed to explain stable platelet adhesion to areas of vessel wall injury under conditions of high shear stress, such as those encountered in the microvasculature or in stenotic arteries (3Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 4Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Platelet tethering to the injured vessel wall under conditions of rapid blood flow is critically dependent on the interaction between subendothelial-bound vWf 1The abbreviations used are: vWf, von Willebrand factor; BvWf, bovine von Willebrand factor; HvWf, human von Willebrand factor; GP, glycoprotein; ABP, actin-binding protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. and the GPIb-V-IX complex on the platelet surface. This adhesive interaction is characterized by a rapid receptor/ligand on/off rate that supports reversible adhesion contacts. Similar to leukocyte adhesion under flow, the vWf/GPIb-V-IX interaction is critical for platelet tethering as a prerequisite for integrin-mediated cell arrest (3Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 5Savage B. Shattil S.J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11300-11306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A major difference between selectins and GPIb-V-IX is the shear forces under which they must operate in vivo to support cell adhesion. For example, adhesion contacts mediated by selectins are relatively sensitive to disruption by increasing shear, with detachment of leukocytes occurring at shear stresses below 7 dyne/cm2(∼200 s−1) (1Lawrence M.B. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 859-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). Platelets, on the other hand, adhere to vessel walls at shear stresses of up to 60 dyne/cm2(∼1600 s−1) under normal physiological conditions and can also form stable adhesion contacts at pathological levels of shear of up to 300 dyne/cm2 (∼8000 s−1) (6Kroll M.H. Hellums D. McIntire L.V. Schafer A.I. Moake J.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 1525-1541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of platelets to form stationary adhesion contacts under conditions of high shear is dependent on several factors. First, bond formation between vWf and GPIb must occur with sufficient rapidity to enable the capture of platelets from flowing blood. Second, the vWf/GPIb interaction must have sufficient tensile strength to resist the detaching effects of high shear. Third, integrin engagement of the adhesive surface must occur rapidly to retain platelets at the site of vessel wall injury. Despite its fundamental importance, the unique biomechanical characteristics of the vWf/GPIb interaction enabling platelet tethering under high shear remain poorly understood. The high tensile strength of the vWf/GPIb interaction is likely to reflect the formation of a large number of active bonds between vWf and GPIb, a process favored by the high GPIb density on the platelet surface and the multivalency of vWf. In this regard, GPV may play an important role, as it has been postulated to cross-link two GPIb molecules on the cell surface, thereby facilitating multivalent interactions. Anchorage of GPIb to the membrane skeleton may also be important for regulating the vWf/GPIb interaction by regulating the receptor distribution on the cell surface. Previous studies examining the role of the cytoplasmic tail of GPIbα in regulating receptor function have yielded conflicting results. Cunningham et al. (7Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have reported normal binding of vWf to mutant GPIbα receptors with C-terminal deletions of up to 52 amino acids. In contrast, Dong et al.(8Dong J.-F. Ki C.Q. Sae-Tung G. Hyun W. Afshar-Kharghan V. Lopez J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12421-12427Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have recently reported that the removal of as few as six C-terminal amino acids from GPIbα has a profound inhibitory effect on the ability of the receptor to bind vWf. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear, but may reflect methodological differences between the two studies. Studies of the purified GPIb-V-IX complex have demonstrated that ∼70% of GPIb is complexed to actin-binding protein in vivo (9Fox J.E.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This linkage appears to play an important role in maintaining the normal cytoskeletal architecture of resting platelets and in limiting mobility of the receptor complex within the plane of the plasma membrane (8Dong J.-F. Ki C.Q. Sae-Tung G. Hyun W. Afshar-Kharghan V. Lopez J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12421-12427Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies of the cytoplasmic tail of GPIbα have demonstrated that the interaction between GPIbα and ABP is essential for anchoring the entire receptor complex to the membrane skeleton (7Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Peptide binding and antibody inhibition studies have demonstrated that sequences contained within the central portion of the GPIbα cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 535–568 and 570–590) interact with purified ABP (10Andrews R.K. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18605-18611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although mutagenesis studies have confirmed an important role for residues 570–590 in this interaction in vivo (7Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the contribution of amino acids between positions 535 and 568 in regulating the GPIb/ABP interaction in vivoremains to be established. In an attempt to investigate the structural domains of the GPIb-V-IX complex involved in regulating cell adhesion, we have expressed partial (GPIb-IX), complete (GPIb-V-IX), and mutant (GPIbα cytoplasmic tail mutants) receptor complexes on the surface of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and examined the ability of these receptors to support cell adhesion under flow conditions. Our studies demonstrate that the GPIb-IX complex is pivotal in mediating cell rolling at both venous and arterial levels of shear in the absence of other platelet adhesion receptors. Interestingly, GPV does not appear to significantly alter GPIb-mediated cell rolling or the strength of cell attachment to a vWf matrix. Studies of GPIbα truncation mutants have also demonstrated that the cytoplasmic tail of GPIbα does not regulate the initial tethering or rolling of CHO cells on vWf at low shear stress, but plays an important role in maintaining cell attachment to the matrix under high shear. The monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) WM23, AK2 (anti-GPIbα), and FMC25 (anti-GPIX) were generous donations from Prof. Michael Berndt (Baker Medical Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia). mAb SW16 (anti-GPV) was from The Central Laboratory of the Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service (CLB, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). All other materials were from sources we have described previously (11Jackson S.P. Schoenwaelder S.M. Yuan Y. Rabinowitz I. Salem H.H. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol.

CHO cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. CHO cells were transfected with a set of three expression plasmids, which individually contained the cDNAs encoding for GPIbα, GPIbβ, and GPIX. These plasmids were a kind gift from Dr. José López and were constructed using the pDX expression vector as described previously (14Lopez J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The selection plasmid pPNT(s) (a gift from Dr. Phil Bird, Monash Medical School, Box Hill Hospital) was cotransfected to confer resistance to G418. Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique, and cells were put under selection pressure after 48 h using 800 μg/ml G418. Control CHO cells were transfected with the expression vector pDX (containing no GPIb-IX cDNA) and pPNT(s) and selected under the same conditions. Individual G418-resistant clones were isolated with glass cloning cylinders and screened for their surface expression of GPIbα by immunofluorescence microscopy using mAb WM23 and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. Positive clones were analyzed for their expression level of GPIbα and GPIX by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). CHO cells expressing GPIb-IX (CHO-Ib-IX) were subsequently cotransfected with pDX containing GPV cDNA and a selection plasmid, pPB-3 (a gift from Dr. Phil Bird), to confer hygromycin resistance. Resistant CHO cells were selected using 400 μg/ml hygromycin, analyzed for expression of GPV by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis and subjected to two rounds of cell sorting using magnetic beads conjugated to sheep anti-mouse IgG (Dynal, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, after having labeled CHO cells with the anti-GPV mAb SW16. Deletions were introduced into double-stranded GPIbα cDNA in pDX by polymerase chain reaction using the ExSiteTM polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Amplification was performed using two primers: P1, 5′-TTG TGT GGC TGT GGT CAG AGC-3′ (nucleotides 4718 to 4698, numbering according to Wenger et al. (15Wenger R.H. Kieffer N. Wicki A.N. Clemetson K.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar)); and P2, 5′-GCT TGG GTA CGG CCT AAT GGC-3′ (nucleotides 4821–4841). CHO-β-IX cells (kindly donated by Dr. José López) were transfected with either wild-type or deleted forms of GPIbα cloned in pDX and the resistance plasmid pZeoSV using FuGene TM6 transfection reagent (Boehringer Mannheim). Selection was initiated using 200 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen), and resistant clones were cultured for 2 weeks and then analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Samples containing 107 CHO cells/100 μl were permeabilized using 0.3% saponin in PBS (containing Complete™ anti-protease mixture (Boehringer Mannheim) and 130 mm sucrose) for 6 min at 37 °C, after which the reaction was stopped on ice. The cells were washed and then incubated for 15 min on ice with 0.05 mg/ml NHS-Biotin (Immuno-Pure®NHS-SS-Biotin, Pierce) in PBS. After two further washes, the cells were lysed and incubated with 50 μl of protein G beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the cleared lysates were incubated with 20 μg/ml mAb (ALMA 12 (anti-GPIbα), ALMA 16 (anti-GPIX), or an isotype-matched control) plus 50 μl/ml protein G for 2 h on ice and then washed thoroughly. Immunoprecipitated proteins were removed from the beads by boiling in 1% SDS buffer for 5 min, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin for 1 h, the immunoprecipitated bands were detected using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Glass coverslips were coated with 10 μg/ml bovine vWf (BvWf), human vWf (HvWf), or fibrinogen at 4 °C overnight and then blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. CHO-Ib-IX, CHO-β-IX, and CHO-pDX cells were harvested with 0.5 mm EDTA, washed twice with PBS, resuspended in Tyrode's buffer containing 2 mm EDTA to a final concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml, and then applied to the vWf-coated coverslips for 30 min at room temperature. For some assays, a suspension of CHO-Ib-IX cells was preincubated with the anti-GPIbα mAb AK2 (5 μg/ml) prior to application to coverslips. Non-adherent cells were aspirated, and the coverslips were washed four times with PBS. Adherent cells were visualized using an inverted phase-contrast microscope (Olympus IX-70). Flow assays were performed as described by Cooke et al. (16Cooke B.M. Usami S. Perry I. Nash G.B. Microvasc. Res. 1993; 45: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Glass microcapillary tubes (Microslides, Vitro Dynamics Inc., Mountain Lakes, NJ; 100 mm long with a rectangular cross-section of 0.3 × 3.0 mm (height × width)) were coated with the indicated concentration (10–100 μg/ml) of BvWf or HvWf at 4 °C overnight, washed three times with PBS, and then blocked with either 0.1% bovine serum albumin or 25% heat-inactivated human serum at room temperature for 1 h. In the majority of studies, CHO cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were perfused through the microcapillary tubes at a shear rate of 150 s−1 for 5 min and visualized using video microscopy. At the end of the cell perfusion period, the microcapillary tube was perfused with cell-free buffer at the same shear stress, and one representative field was recorded on video for 1 min for subsequent analysis. Following this, the shear stress was increased incrementally to 750, 1500, 3000, 6000, 7500, 9000, and 10,500 s−1. At each shear rate tested, the same field on the microcapillary tube was videotaped for 1 min. In studies examining cell tethering to immobilized vWf, cells were perfused through the microcapillary tubes at shear rates ranging from 75 to 300 s−1 for 10 min. At the indicated time points during the 10 min, 10 fields were videotaped, and the number of adherent cells/field was quantitated off line. Video recordings were analyzed off line, and the velocity of rolling was calculated as follows. All adherent cells present within one field (or 25 cells/field in some experiments) were marked, and the distance traveled per unit time was recorded. The monitor was calibrated using a 0.01-mm stage micrometer (Olympus), and the rolling velocity was expressed in μm/s. For image capture and analysis, the Microcomputer Imaging Device (MCIDTM) software was used (Imaging Research Inc., Ontario, Canada). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to the method of Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Bovine and human vWf were purified from plasma cryoprecipitate by size-exclusion chromatography according to the method of Montgomery and Zimmerman (18Montgomery R.R. Zimmerman T.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 1498-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Fibrinogen was purified from fresh frozen plasma as described by Jakobsen and Kierulf (19Jakobsen E. Kierulf P. Thromb. Res. 1973; 3: 145-159Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (98) Google Scholar). All proteins were demonstrated to be >95% pure by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of electrophoresed proteins. Significant differences were detected using one-way analysis of variance and Student's t test using the Prism software package (GraphPAD Software for Science, San Diego, CA). It is well established that GPIb-IX expressed on the surface of heterologous cells is competent to bind human vWf in the presence of cationic modulators, such as ristocetin or botrocetin (7Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 14Lopez J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these modulators provide a convenient method to investigate the vWf/GPIb-IX interaction in vitro, their regulatory effects on vWf or GPIb-IX do not necessarily mimic those that occur in vivo. An alternative approach involves using bovine vWf, which spontaneously binds GPIb-IX in the absence of cationic modulators (20Moake J.L. Olson J.D. Troll J.H. Tang S.S. Funicella T. Peterson D.M. Thromb. Res. 1980; 19: 21-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,21Puszkin E.G. Mauss E.A. Zucker M.B. Blood. 1990; 76: 1572-1579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In preliminary studies, we examined the ability of immobilized BvWf to support adhesion of GPIb-IX-transfected CHO cells. Under static conditions CHO-Ib-IX, but not CHO-pDX or CHO-β-IX, adhered to purified BvWf (Fig. 1). This adhesion was specific to the vWf/GPIb-IX interaction in that it did not occur on a fibrinogen matrix and was abolished by the anti-GPIbα mAb AK2 (Fig.1). Consistent with previous reports, GPIb-IX-transfected CHO cells did not form stable adhesion contacts with a human vWf matrix in the absence of a cationic modulator (7Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of shear stress on the BvWf/GPIb-IX interaction, we performed in vitro flow-based assays using BvWf-coated microcapillary tubes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In initial studies, CHO-Ib-IX cells were preadhered to the BvWf matrix for 5 min prior to the initiation of flow. Applying shear (150 s−1) to adherent CHO-Ib-IX cells converted their adhesion from stationary to rolling adhesion (Fig.2 A, upper panel). High power magnification of the CHO cells using differential interference contrast microscopy clearly demonstrated a rotational motion of the cells, indicative of cell rolling. The majority of cells appeared to roll at a uniform velocity, although occasional cells would halt periodically before returning to their previous rolling velocity. Prolonged cell contact with the BvWf matrix prior to the initiation of flow did not lead to irreversible cell adhesion or influence subsequent rolling velocity. Perfusion of CHO-Ib-IX cells in the presence of EDTA (2 mm) did not influence the rolling phenomenon, excluding a major role for endogenous CHO cell integrins in this process. Exposure of CHO-Ib-IX cells or the vWf matrix to a broad range of shear rates (150–12,000 s−1) did not appear to induce significant alterations in the interaction between cells and matrix. For example, prolonged exposure of the matrix to high shear stress did not alter subsequent CHO-Ib-IX cell tethering or rolling. Furthermore, utilizing the same matrix for multiple experiments at different shear stresses yielded identical results to experiments performed on virgin matrices. All cells appeared to roll at a similar velocity over the entire surface of the microcapillary tube, and the rolling velocity of individual cells did not appear to change over a 10-min observation period. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that cell rolling is due to the reversible characteristics of the vWf/GPIb interaction rather than to loss of molecules from the cell surface or the matrix. We examined the effect of several independent parameters, including shear rate, receptor density, and matrix concentration, on the velocity of CHO-Ib-IX cell rolling. In all experiments, rolling velocities were determined under equilibrium binding conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As demonstrated in Fig. 2 (Aand B), incremental increases in shear rate resulted in a corresponding increase in the velocity of cell rolling, from 2 μm/s at 150 s−1 up to 8.5 μm/s at 6000 s−1. Under similar experimental conditions, clones with 2–3-fold higher surface expression of GPIb-IX exhibited an ∼50% reduction in rolling velocity (Fig. 3, A andB). Matrix concentration also had a profound effect on CHO cell rolling. As demonstrated in Fig. 3 C, increasing the coating concentration of BvWf from 10 to 50 μg/ml resulted in a 5.5-fold reduction in the rate of cell rolling at 150 s−1. To investigate whether human vWf could also support rolling of GPIb-IX-transfected CHO cells, CHO-Ib-IX cells were perfused through HvWf-coated microcapillary tubes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As with the bovine protein, CHO-Ib-IX cells were able to tether and roll on a HvWf matrix in the absence of cationic modulators. The ability of CHO-Ib-IX cells to tether was greatly influenced by the matrix concentration and wall shear rate. At a low HvWf-coating concentration (10 μg/ml), CHO-Ib-IX cells tethered poorly to the matrix at all shear rates tested, whereas at a high matrix concentration (100 μg/ml), cells preferentially tethered at low shear rates (Fig. 4). The bovine protein was more effective at supporting CHO-Ib-IX cell tethering at both low (10 μg/ml) and high (100 μg/ml) matrix concentrations; however, as with the human matrix, cell tethering was apparent only at relatively low shear rates (<300 s−1). Similar to our findings with BvWf, the velocity of CHO-Ib-IX cell rolling on HvWf was dependent on the shear rate (Table I). Overall, the velocity of CHO-Ib-IX cell rolling on a human matrix was 2–3-fold faster than that observed with the bovine protein.Table IMean rolling velocity of CHO-Ib-IX cells on 100 μg/ml human or bovine vWfRolling velocityDifferenceHuman vWfBovine vWfμm/s-foldShear rate150 s−13.621.193.0750 s−15.722.382.41500 s−16.952.92.4Rolling velocity was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data presented are from three experiments in which 25 cells were analyzed on each matrix at each shear rate tested. Open table in a new tab Rolling velocity was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data presented are from three experiments in which 25 cells were analyzed on each matrix at each shear rate tested. As demonstrated in Fig. 5, at a high matrix concentration (100 μg/ml BvWf), >85% of CHO-Ib-IX cells remained attached to BvWf at shear rates as high as 3000 s−1. Higher shear resulted in a progressive decrease in the number of attached cells, although even at the highest shear rate tested (10,500 s−1), ∼15% of cells were still able to adhere and roll on the BvWf matrix. This contrasted significantly with the HvWf matrix, from which ∼30% of CHO-Ib-IX cells detached at a shear rate of 750 s−1, ∼65% at 1500 s−1, and ∼95% at 3000 s−1. Treating the cells with EDTA (2 mm) had no inhibitory effect on their resistance to detachment by high shear forces (data not shown). As with the rolling velocity, the resistance of CHO-Ib-IX cell detachment was greatly influenced by the matrix concentration (see Fig. 7) and receptor density (data not shown).Figure 7Effect of GPV on shear-induced cell detachment from bovine vWf. CHO-Ib-IX and CHO-Ib-V-IX cells were detached from 50 μg/ml (panel i), 25 μg/ml (panel ii), and 10 μg/ml (panel iii) BvWf over a wide range of shear rates (150–6000 s−1). The shear rate was increased incrementally every 60 s to a maximum of 6000 s−1. At each shear rate, the same field was videotaped, and the number of adherent cells was counted off line. Note that CHO-Ib-V-IX cells were perfused through the same microcapillary tube as CHO-Ib-IX cells at a cell concentration of 1 × 106cells/ml.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate a potential role for GPV in regulating the rolling phenomena, we transfected CHO-Ib-IX cells with GPV as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As demonstrated in Fig.6 A, high levels of GPV were expressed on the surface of CHO-Ib-V-IX cells when analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Both CHO-Ib-V-IX and CHO-Ib-IX cells expressed comparable levels of GPIbα. Cells expressing GPV appeared to roll in a similar manner to cells expressing GPIb-IX alone. Interestingly, no difference was detected in the velocity of cell rolling between CHO-Ib-V-IX and CHO-Ib-IX cells when compared at both low (150 s−1) and high (3000 s−1) shear rates (Fig. 6 B) and when examined over a broad range of different BvWf matrix concentrations (data not shown).

We hypothesized that phosphorylation of HSP20 in vascular smooth muscles is associated with alterations in the macromolecular associations of HSP20. Treatment of bovine carotid artery smooth muscles with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin, led to increases in the phosphorylation of HSP20 and dissociation of macromolecular aggregates of HSP20. However, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and forskolin treatment of a muscle that is uniquely refractory to cyclic nucleotide-dependent vasorelaxation, human umbilical artery smooth muscle, did not result in increases in the phosphorylation of HSP20 or to dissociation of macromolecular aggregates. HSP20 can be phosphorylated in vitro by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in both carotid and umbilical arteries and this phosphorylation of HSP20 is associated with dissociation of macromolecular aggregates of HSP20.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15302-15309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both HSP20 and HSP27 dissociate from the aggregated form in response to heat stress (5Kato K. Goto G. Inaguma Y.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15302-15309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We hypothesized that the cellular functions of HSP20 and HSP27 are modulated by both phosphorylation and macromolecular association with specific proteins. Furthermore, we postulated that HSP20 and/or HSP27 are cellular signaling molecules that regulate the state of contraction and relaxation of vascular smooth muscle.DISCUSSIONCyclic nucleotide-dependent relaxation of vascular smooth muscle is associated with increases in the phosphorylation of a small heat shock-related protein, HSP20 (1Beall A.C. Kato K. Goldenring J.R. Rasmussen H. Brophy C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11283-11287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In this investigation, we demonstrate that this increase in phosphorylation is associated with a dissociation of macromolecular aggregates of HSP20 in a muscle that displays normal cyclic nucleotide-dependent vasorelaxation, bovine carotid artery. The non-phosphorylated HSP20 eluted from the column just before the catalase standard (232 kDa) and the phosphorylated HSP20 just before the aldolase standard (158 kDa). Thus, the macromolecular aggregates of non-phosphorylated HSP20 are in an aggregate with a molecular mass greater than 232 kDa and the phosphorylated HSP20 in an aggregate with a molecular mass less than 158 kDa. Since the phosphorylated HSP20 was clearly in an aggregate with a molecular mass greater than 67 kDa, it appears that the HSP20 aggregates do not dissociate completely into monomers after maximal activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways with IBMX and forskolin.In a muscle that is uniquely refractory to cyclic nucleotide-dependent vasorelaxation, human umbilical artery smooth muscle, HSP20 is not phosphorylated (3Berg C. Brophy C.M. Dransfield D. Lincoln T.M. Goldenring J. Rasmussen H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H202-H212PubMed Google Scholar, 4Brophy C.M. Beall A. Lamb S. Dickinson M. Ware D.J. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 1354-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The macromolecular aggregates of HSP20 from umbilical smooth muscle do not dissociate with activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways. However, HSP20 is present in umbilical smooth muscle and can be phosphorylated in vitro with the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). The in vitro phosphorylation of HSP20 is associated with disaggregation of macromolecular aggregates.Another small heat shock protein, HSP27, is a predominant protein in vascular smooth muscle and is phosphorylated by receptor-initiated signaling cascades involving MAPKAP kinase-2 in smooth muscles (12Brophy C.M. Woodrum D. Dickinson M. Beall A. J. Vasc. Surg. 1998; 27: 963-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Both HSP20 and HSP27 are predominantly cytosolic proteins in vascular smooth muscles. HSP27 also exists in macromolecular aggregates in bovine carotid artery smooth muscle, however, the aggregates do not dissociate with activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways. In carotid artery smooth muscle, HSP27 is in a similar fraction as the HSP20 after stimulation with IBMX and forskolin, suggesting that phosphorylated HSP20 may exist in a complex with HSP27. In the umbilical artery smooth muscle immunoreactive HSP27 was in two fractions and did not change after stimulation of the tissues with IBMX and forskolin.The initiation of vascular smooth muscle contraction is associated with increases in the phosphorylation of the MLC20 (19Miller-Hance W.C. Miller J.R. Wells J.N. Stull J.T. Kamm K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13979-13982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this investigation, we determined that the MLC20 were in the same fraction as non-phosphorylated HSP20 in cytosolic homogenates of unstimulated bovine carotid artery smooth muscle. Stimulation of strips of carotid artery smooth muscle with IBMX and forskolin led to a shift of the MLC20 to fraction 35. This is the same fraction as the HSP20 was in after IBMX and forskolin treatment. However, in both unstimulated and IBMX/forskolin-treated umbilical artery smooth muscle, the MLC20 were in fraction 35, suggesting that phosphorylated HSP20 may exist in an aggregate with the MLC20. Immunoreactive α-actin was present in both fractions 30 and 35 from both tissues. Using an actin co-sedimentation assay, we have recently demonstrated that phosphorylated recombinant HSP20 is associated with globular actin whereas non-phosphorylated recombinant HSP20 is associated with filamentous actin (20Brophy C.M. Lamb S. Graham A. J. Vasc. Surg. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). In addition, α-actin co-immunoprecipitates with HSP20 (20Brophy C.M. Lamb S. Graham A. J. Vasc. Surg. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). Thus, while the precise mechanism by which HSP20 modulates vasorelaxation are not known, these data suggest that HSP20 is associated with specific elements of the contractile machinery, α-actin and MLC20, and may modulate vasorelaxation through a direct interaction with contractile elements.While these studies examine vascular smooth muscles from different arterial beds and different species, these two tissues display marked differences in physiologic responses to activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways. Thus, these two different tissues represent a useful model to compare the events associated with cyclic nucleotide-dependent vasorelaxation. In addition, the doses of IBMX and forskolin used to activate cyclic nucleotide-dependent cellular signaling pathways are essentially maximal doses of each agent. These doses of IBMX and forskolin lead to rapid and complete relaxation of agonist pre-contracted carotid, but not umbilical artery smooth muscles (3Berg C. Brophy C.M. Dransfield D. Lincoln T.M. Goldenring J. Rasmussen H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H202-H212PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of umbilical artery smooth muscles with IBMX and forskolin does not lead to significant increases in the phosphorylation of HSP20 and in fact the amount of HSP20 phosphorylation after IBMX and forskolin treatment of umbilical artery smooth muscle did not exceed basal levels of HSP20 phosphorylation in carotid arteries.The data using these two muscles suggests that the small heat shock proteins, HSP20 and HSP27, are predominantly cytosolic proteins in vascular smooth muscles. Cyclic nucleotide-dependent increases in the phosphorylation of HSP20 leads to dissociation of macromolecular aggregates of HSP20. In addition, activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways in vascular smooth muscles leads to changes in the macromolecular associations of MLC20. Thus, HSP20 may be an important downstream signaling mediator of cyclic nucleotide-dependent vasorelaxation and may mediate relaxation through direct interaction with specific elements of the contractile machinery. Agonist pre-contracted bovine carotid artery smooth muscle relaxes with the addition of the guanylyl cyclase activator, sodium nitroprusside, or the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin.

Goldenring J.R. Rasmussen H. Brophy C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11283-11287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In this investigation, we demonstrate that this increase in phosphorylation is associated with a dissociation of macromolecular aggregates of HSP20 in a muscle that displays normal cyclic nucleotide-dependent vasorelaxation, bovine carotid artery. The non-phosphorylated HSP20 eluted from the column just before the catalase standard (232 kDa) and the phosphorylated HSP20 just before the aldolase standard (158 kDa). Thus, the macromolecular aggregates of non-phosphorylated HSP20 are in an aggregate with a molecular mass greater than 232 kDa and the phosphorylated HSP20 in an aggregate with a molecular mass less than 158 kDa. Since the phosphorylated HSP20 was clearly in an aggregate with a molecular mass greater than 67 kDa, it appears that the HSP20 aggregates do not dissociate completely into monomers after maximal activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways with IBMX and forskolin.In a muscle that is uniquely refractory to cyclic nucleotide-dependent vasorelaxation, human umbilical artery smooth muscle, HSP20 is not phosphorylated (3Berg C. Brophy C.M. Dransfield D. Lincoln T.M. Goldenring J. Rasmussen H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H202-H212PubMed Google Scholar, 4Brophy C.M. Beall A. Lamb S. Dickinson M. Ware D.J. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 1354-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The macromolecular aggregates of HSP20 from umbilical smooth muscle do not dissociate with activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways. However, HSP20 is present in umbilical smooth muscle and can be phosphorylated in vitro with the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). The in vitro phosphorylation of HSP20 is associated with disaggregation of macromolecular aggregates.Another small heat shock protein, HSP27, is a predominant protein in vascular smooth muscle and is phosphorylated by receptor-initiated signaling cascades involving MAPKAP kinase-2 in smooth muscles (12Brophy C.M. Woodrum D. Dickinson M. Beall A. J. Vasc. Surg. 1998; 27: 963-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Both HSP20 and HSP27 are predominantly cytosolic proteins in vascular smooth muscles. HSP27 also exists in macromolecular aggregates in bovine carotid artery smooth muscle, however, the aggregates do not dissociate with activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways. In carotid artery smooth muscle, HSP27 is in a similar fraction as the HSP20 after stimulation with IBMX and forskolin, suggesting that phosphorylated HSP20 may exist in a complex with HSP27. In the umbilical artery smooth muscle immunoreactive HSP27 was in two fractions and did not change after stimulation of the tissues with IBMX and forskolin.The initiation of vascular smooth muscle contraction is associated with increases in the phosphorylation of the MLC20 (19Miller-Hance W.C. Miller J.R. Wells J.N. Stull J.T. Kamm K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13979-13982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this investigation, we determined that the MLC20 were in the same fraction as non-phosphorylated HSP20 in cytosolic homogenates of unstimulated bovine carotid artery smooth muscle. Stimulation of strips of carotid artery smooth muscle with IBMX and forskolin led to a shift of the MLC20 to fraction 35. This is the same fraction as the HSP20 was in after IBMX and forskolin treatment. However, in both unstimulated and IBMX/forskolin-treated umbilical artery smooth muscle, the MLC20 were in fraction 35, suggesting that phosphorylated HSP20 may exist in an aggregate with the MLC20. Immunoreactive α-actin was present in both fractions 30 and 35 from both tissues. Using an actin co-sedimentation assay, we have recently demonstrated that phosphorylated recombinant HSP20 is associated with globular actin whereas non-phosphorylated recombinant HSP20 is associated with filamentous actin (20Brophy C.M. Lamb S. Graham A. J. Vasc. Surg. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). In addition, α-actin co-immunoprecipitates with HSP20 (20Brophy C.M. Lamb S. Graham A. J. Vasc. Surg. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). Thus, while the precise mechanism by which HSP20 modulates vasorelaxation are not known, these data suggest that HSP20 is associated with specific elements of the contractile machinery, α-actin and MLC20, and may modulate vasorelaxation through a direct interaction with contractile elements.While these studies examine vascular smooth muscles from different arterial beds and different species, these two tissues display marked differences in physiologic responses to activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways. Thus, these two different tissues represent a useful model to compare the events associated with cyclic nucleotide-dependent vasorelaxation. In addition, the doses of IBMX and forskolin used to activate cyclic nucleotide-dependent cellular signaling pathways are essentially maximal doses of each agent. These doses of IBMX and forskolin lead to rapid and complete relaxation of agonist pre-contracted carotid, but not umbilical artery smooth muscles (3Berg C. Brophy C.M. Dransfield D. Lincoln T.M. Goldenring J. Rasmussen H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H202-H212PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of umbilical artery smooth muscles with IBMX and forskolin does not lead to significant increases in the phosphorylation of HSP20 and in fact the amount of HSP20 phosphorylation after IBMX and forskolin treatment of umbilical artery smooth muscle did not exceed basal levels of HSP20 phosphorylation in carotid arteries.The data using these two muscles suggests that the small heat shock proteins, HSP20 and HSP27, are predominantly cytosolic proteins in vascular smooth muscles. Cyclic nucleotide-dependent increases in the phosphorylation of HSP20 leads to dissociation of macromolecular aggregates of HSP20. In addition, activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways in vascular smooth muscles leads to changes in the macromolecular associations of MLC20. Thus, HSP20 may be an important downstream signaling mediator of cyclic nucleotide-dependent vasorelaxation and may mediate relaxation through direct interaction with specific elements of the contractile machinery. Cyclic nucleotide-dependent relaxation of vascular smooth muscle is associated with increases in the phosphorylation of a small heat shock-related protein, HSP20 (1Beall A.C. Kato K. Goldenring J.R.

https://openalex.org/W2020482185,"Stimulation of mammalian cells results in subcellular relocalization of Ras pathway enzymes, in which extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases rapidly translocate to nuclei. In this study, we define conditions for nuclear localization of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MKK1) by examining effects of perturbing the nuclear export signal (NES), the regulatory phosphorylation sites Ser218 and Ser222, and a regulatory domain at the N terminus. After disrupting the NES (Δ32–37), nuclear uptake of MKK was enhanced when quiescent cells were activated with serum-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or BXB-Raf-1 cotransfection. Uptake was enhanced by mutation of Ser218and Ser222 to Glu and Asp, respectively, and blocked by mutation of these residues to Ala, although mutation of Lys97 to Met, which renders MKK catalytically inactive, did not interfere with uptake. Therefore, nuclear uptake of MKK requires incorporation of phosphate or negatively charged residues at the activation lip but not enzyme activity. On the other hand, uptake of an active MKK mutant with disrupted NES (Δ32–51) was elevated in quiescent as well as stimulated cells, and pretreatment of cells with the MKK inhibitor 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis[2-aminophenylthio]butadiene blocked nuclear uptake. Thus, signaling downstream of MKK is also necessary for translocation. Finally, wild type MKK containing an intact NES translocates to nuclei during mitosis before envelope breakdown. Comparison of mutants with Ser to Glu and Asp or Ala substitutions indicates that Ser phosphorylation is also required for mitotic nuclear uptake of MKK."
https://openalex.org/W2076226689,"Iron regulatory protein-1 (IRP-1) controls the expression of several mRNAs by binding to iron-responsive elements (IREs) in their untranslated regions. In iron-replete cells, a 4Fe-4S cluster converts IRP-1 to cytoplasmic aconitase. IRE binding activity is restored by cluster loss in response to iron starvation, NO, or extracellular H2O2. Here, we study the effects of intracellular quinone-induced oxidative stress on IRP-1. Treatment of murine B6 fibroblasts with menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB), a redox cycling drug, causes a modest activation of IRP-1 to bind to IREs within 15–30 min. However, IRE binding drops to basal levels within 60 min. Surprisingly, a remarkable loss of both IRE binding and aconitase activities of IRP-1 follows treatment with MSB for 1–2 h. These effects do not result from alterations in IRP-1 half-life, can be antagonized by the antioxidantN-acetylcysteine, and regulate IRE-containing mRNAs; the capacity of iron-starved MSB-treated cells to increase transferrin receptor mRNA levels is inhibited, and MSB increases the translation of a human growth hormone indicator mRNA bearing an IRE in its 5′-untranslated region. Nonetheless, MSB inhibits ferritin synthesis. Thus, menadione-induced oxidative stress leads to post-translational inactivation of both genetic and enzymatic functions of IRP-1 by a mechanism that lies beyond the “classical” Fe-S cluster switch and exerts multiple effects on cellular iron metabolism.

As an essential constituent of many cellular macromolecules, iron participates in numerous biochemical activities, such as oxygen transport or electron transfer reactions (1Frausto da Silva J.J.R. Williams R.J.P. The Biological Chemistry of the Elements: The Inorganic Chemistry of Life. 21. Clarendon, Oxford1991: 319-368Google Scholar). Excess of iron is, however, toxic for cells, and pathologic conditions of iron overload are associated with tissue injury and degeneration. The reactivity of ferrous/ferric iron against H2O2 and O·̄2 to yield hydroxyl radicals in the Fenton/Haber-Weiss reactions provides a molecular basis for iron toxicity (2Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4450) Google Scholar). Considering that reactive oxygen species (ROS), 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; IRP-1, iron-regulatory protein 1; IRE, iron-responsive element; TfR, transferrin receptor; MSB, menadione sodium bisulfite; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; hGH, human growth hormone; BSO, l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine. including H2O2 and O·̄2, are inevitable byproducts of aerobic respiration, cells have to tightly control iron homeostasis to minimize the toxic effects of iron. In vertebrates, iron uptake by the transferrin receptor (TfR) and intracellular iron storage in ferritin are controlled by the IRE/IRP regulatory system: TfR and ferritin mRNAs contain iron-responsive elements (IREs) in their untranslated regions, which constitute the binding sites for two related iron regulatory proteins, IRP-1 and IRP-2. Both IRPs are activated by iron deficiency and NO to bind to IREs. This activation results in stabilization of TfR mRNA, which contains IREs in the 3′-untranslated region, and translational inhibition of ferritin mRNA, which contains an IRE in the 5′-untranslated region (reviewed in Refs. 3Hentze M.W.

IRP-1, which is considerably more abundant than IRP-2 in most tissues examined so far, is a bifunctional protein that assembles a cubane 4Fe-4S cluster in response to increased cellular iron levels. This cluster assembly renders it to be a cytosolic aconitase and inhibits its IRE binding activity. The two mutually exclusive functions of IRP-1 as an IRE-binding protein and as an aconitase are controlled by a reversible switch between 4Fe-4S-IRP-1 and apo-IRP-1 (for reviews see Refs. 3Hentze M.W.

Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). In addition to iron starvation and NO, which induce both IRP-1 and IRP-2, IRP-1 is specifically activated to bind to IREs when cells are exposed to low micromolar concentrations of H2O2 (8Martins E.A.L.

H2O2 constitutes a distinct signal independent from iron starvation and NO, which induces 4Fe-4S cluster disassembly and activation of IRE binding (10Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 11Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. Atzberger A. Ansorge W. Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 10559-10563Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The physiology of oxidative stress is intimately connected with the regulation of iron metabolism. Treatment of cultured fibroblasts with H2O2inhibits the synthesis of endogenous ferritin (9Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and the translation of a transfected hGH reporter under the control of an IRE (14Menotti E. Henderson B.R. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1821-1824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, pharmacological treatment of cultured fibroblasts with antimycin A, a respiratory chain inhibitor that stimulates generation of ROS in mitochondria, also leads to IRP-1 activation (10Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, treatment of rats with the drug phorone, which elicits oxidative stress by depletion of glutathione pools, induces ferritin synthesis (13Cairo G. Tacchini L. Pogliaghi G. Anzon E. Tomasi A. Bernelli- Zazzera A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 700-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Thus, iron metabolism and oxidative stress are interconnected in multiple ways, probably involving primary and compensatory responses influenced by the chemical nature of the ROS and the time of treatment. These considerations prompted us to study the effects of other oxidative stress-inducing agents on cellular iron metabolism. Considerable attention was recently drawn to the so-called “quinone-induced oxidative stress.” Quinones are pro-oxidant compounds that undergo redox cycling under aerobic conditions (15Cadenas E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Inside the cell, quinones are reduced to semiquinone radicals by one-electron transfer reductases and to hydroquinones by NADPH-quinone reductases at the expense of NADPH. These intermediates readily react with O2 and O·̄2 to regenerate the quinone and to yield O·̄2 and H2O2, respectively. Apart from this, some quinones engage in nucleophilic addition reactions that deplete the intracellular glutathione pool. Quinone-induced oxidative stress has been shown to elicit various genetic responses: Menadione (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, vitamin K3) activates the metallothionein gene CUP1 inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (16Liu X. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 592-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and aziridinyl-benzoquinones activate the cell cycle inhibitor p21 in human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells (17Qiu X. Forman H.J. Schönthal A.H. Cadenas E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31915-31921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Menadione or 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone induce γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, the rate-limiting enzyme of glutathione synthesis, in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial (18Shi M.M. Iwamoto T. Forman H.J. Am J. Physiol. 1994; 11: L414-L421Google Scholar) and rat lung epithelial L2 cells (19Shi M.M. Kugelman A. Iwamoto T. Tian L. Forman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26512-26517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, menadione activates the expression of the mRNA encoding the macrophage inflammatory protein-1α in rat alveolar macrophages (20Shi M.M. Godleski J.J. Paulauskis J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5878-5883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and induces a heat shock response in human hepatoma HepG2 and Chinese hamster lung V79 cells (21McDuffee A.T. Senisterra G. Huntley S. Lepock J.R. Sekhar K.R. Meredith M.J. Borrelli M.J. Morrow J.D. Freeman M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 171: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Interestingly, menadione also negatively modulates surface expression and recycling of the insulin receptor in human erythrocytes (22Malorni W. Masella R. Santini M.T. Iosi F. Samoggia P. Cantafora A. Merrell D. Peterson S.W. Exp. Cell. Res. 1993; 206: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and of the transferrin receptor in the human hematopoietic cells lines K562 and HL-60 (23Malorni W. Iosi F. Santini M.T. Testa U. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 309-318PubMed Google Scholar). The latter result indicates that quinone-induced oxidative stress may affect cellular iron metabolism. In this study, we have utilized menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB), a water-soluble derivative of menadione, to assess the effects of quinone-induced oxidative stress on cellular iron metabolism and, in particular, on the activities of IRP-1 and the expression of IRE-containing mRNAs. MSB,N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC),l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO), desferrioxamine, paraquat, and diamide were purchased from Sigma. The fluorescent dye 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and heme arginate was from Leiras Oy (Turku, Finland). Polyclonal ferritin antibodies were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim, and hGH antibodies were from the National Hormone and Pituitary Program (Baltimore, MD). Murine B6 and Ltk−fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 ng/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. B6.IREhGH cells (10Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) were grown in the same medium, additionally supplemented with hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium. The redox-sensitive fluorescent probe 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate was employed to assess levels of intracellular H2O2by fluorescence-activated cell sorting as described (11Pantopoulos K.

The dye is oxidized to 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein by H2O2, and thus 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein fluorescence intensity serves as a measure for the intracellular H2O2concentration. Detergent extracts were prepared by lysis of cells in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 40 mm KCl, and 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4.

When administered to cells, menadione, like other quinones, undergoes redox cycling that leads to oxidative stress. In B6 fibroblasts, the accumulation of ROS in response to the water-soluble menadione derivative MSB is time-dependent: treatment of cells with 100 μm MSB for 15, 30, 60, or 120 min results in 1.8-, 2.6-, 3.1-, or 3.0-fold increases in intracellular H2O2 levels, respectively, as measured by 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein fluorescence (Fig.1). This prompted us to kinetically analyze the effects of MSB on the IRE binding activity. After 15 min of treatment of B6 cells with 100 μm MSB, IRP-1 is slightly (1.8-fold) activated (Fig. 2 A,top panel, lanes 1 and 2). However, IRE binding activity decreases to 1.3-fold within 30–45 min and reaches basal levels after 1–2 h (lanes 3–6). This analysis of cytoplasmic extracts by EMSA reveals the “spontaneous” IRE binding activity in cells. The levels of total, “activable” IRP-1 can be assessed after treatment of the cell extracts with 2-mercaptoethanol (26Hentze M.W. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Science. 1989; 244: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Reducing agents compete at high concentrations with the cysteines of IRP-1 for co-ordinating the 4Fe-4S cluster and thus liberate the total IRE binding capacity (26Hentze M.W. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Science. 1989; 244: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 27Hirling H. Henderson B.R. Kühn L.C.

Analysis of activable IRP-1 has become a common practice in many studies over the last few years, first because it yields valuable information on IRP-1 content and second because it can serve as a control for equal protein loading. In extracts of MSB-treated cells this assay yielded an unexpected outcome: the activable IRE binding is significantly (∼80%) diminished after treatment of cells with 100 μmMSB for >45 min (Fig. 2 A, bottom panel, comparelanes 1–3 with lanes 4–6).Figure 2Time-dependent effect of menadione on IRE binding activity. A, B6 cells (107) were left untreated (lane 1) or treated with 100 μm MSB for 15, 30, 45, 60, or 120 min (lanes 2–6). B, B6 cells (107) were pretreated overnight with 100 μm desferrioxamine (lanes 2–6) or left untreated (lane 1). Subsequently, cells received no further treatment (lanes 1and 2) or were treated with 100 μm MSB for 15, 30, 60, or 120 min (lanes 2–6). Cytoplasmic extracts (25 μg) were analyzed by EMSA with 25,000 cpm 32P-labeled IRE probe in the absence (top panel) or presence (bottom panel) of 2% 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME). The positions of the IRE-IRP-1 complexes and of excess free IRE probe are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further investigate this unexpected response of IRP-1, cells were pretreated overnight with the iron chelator desferrioxamine (100 μm) to increase the levels of spontaneous IRE binding. Subsequently, the cells were treated with 100 μm MSB for different time intervals. Analysis of IRE binding in cytoplasmic extracts shows that the treatment with desferrioxamine results in a complete (8-fold) activation of IRP-1 (Fig. 2 B,top and bottom panels, lanes 1 and2). Administration of MSB to iron-starved cells for 15–60 min has no significant effects on IRP-1 (lanes 2–5). Interestingly, treatment with MSB for 2 h results in a marked decrease in both spontaneous as well as activable IRE binding of IRP-1 in desferrioxamine-pretreated cells (lane 6). Thus, MSB elicits two distinct effects on IRP-1: brief (15–45 min) incubations result in a slight IRP-1 activation, whereas longer (>1 h) treatments lead to a reduction of activable IRE binding in control cells and of spontaneous and activable IRE binding in iron-starved cells. To determine the optimal conditions for these responses, control and iron-starved B6 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of MSB for 30 min or 2 h, respectively. Analysis of cytoplasmic extracts for IRE binding shows that maximal IRP-1 activation is achieved with relatively low concentrations of MSB (Fig.3 A, 2-fold activation with 10 μm and 2.5-fold with 25 μm MSB, respectively). On the other hand, higher concentrations of MSB are required to inactivate IRE binding: administration of 10 μm MSB to iron-starved B6 cells for 2 h fails to elicit any effects on IRP-1, whereas higher doses of MSB (50 and 100 μm) lead to 60 and 90% inactivation of IRP-1, respectively (Fig. 3 B). To assess the effects of menadione on IRP-2, we utilized murine Ltk− fibroblasts, which express significantly higher levels of IRP-2 than B6 cells. Analysis of IRE binding activity following treatment of iron-starved Ltk− cells with 100 μm MSB for 2 h lead to the inactivation of IRP-2 and, as expected, IRP-1 (Fig.3 C). This result suggests that menadione-induced oxidative stress affects both iron regulatory proteins. The two effects of MSB on IRP-1 are antagonized by pretreatment of B6 cells with 30 mm NAC for 2 h. This antioxidant first inhibits the partial activation of IRE binding after a short (30–60 min) exposure to low (25 μm) concentrations of MSB (Fig.4 A, compare lanes 2–4 with lanes 5–7) and second protects the spontaneous and activable IRE binding in iron-starved and control cells from inactivation after a longer (2 h) treatment with higher (100 μm) concentrations of MSB (Fig. 4 B, comparelanes 7 and 8, upper and lower panel). Treatment with 100 μg/ml BSO for 18 h, which depletes the intracellular glutathione pools (29Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5972) Google Scholar), does not elicit significant changes in IRE binding activity (Fig. 4 C,lanes 1 and 2 and Ref. 11Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. Atzberger A. Ansorge W. Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9802-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Interestingly, treatment with 100 μm MSB for 2 h following BSO treatment leads to a more profound, almost complete loss of the activable IRE binding compared with control cells (Fig. 4 C,lanes 3 and 4). In iron-replete cells, IRP-1 acquires enzymatic activity as a cytoplasmic aconitase at the expense of IRE binding. To investigate the effect of MSB on the aconitase activity of IRP-1, cytoplasmic aconitase activity was measured in the extracts of MSB-treated and untreated control cells. Treatment of B6 fibroblasts with 25 μm MSB for 30 min results in a partial (15%) inactivation, whereas a higher concentration of MSB (100 μm) leads to 60 or 82% inactivation of cytoplasmic aconitase within 30 or 120 min, respectively (Fig.5). These results show that MSB negatively modulates the aconitase activity of IRP-1. At the early stages of the treatment, this effect correlates with the activation of IRE binding (Figs. 2 A and 3 A). However, at a later stage (2 h), MSB leads to a decline of both the aconitase (Fig.5) and IRE binding (Figs. 2 and 3 B) activities of IRP-1. Previous work by several laboratories established that the aconitase and IRE binding activities of IRP-1 are reciprocally regulated by an Fe-S cluster switch. The simultaneous loss of both activities by menadione is unusual and raises the possibility that IRP-1 could be degraded. To evaluate this possibility, B6 cells were metabolically pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 2 h. Subsequently, cells were either directly harvested or chased with media containing excess unlabeled methionine in the presence of 100 μm MSB for 30 min, 1 h or 2 h. Immunoprecipitation of IRP-1 from cell lysates shows that treatment with 100 μm MSB over 2 h does not affect the stability of newly synthesized IRP-1 (Fig.6 A). To assess the effects of menadione on the steady-state levels of IRP-1, B6 cells were treated with 100 μm MSB for up to 2 h, and IRP-1 was analyzed by Western blotting. No differences in IRP-1 content were found (Fig. 6 B). We conclude that menadione-induced oxidative stress does not profoundly affect the stability of IRP-1. How does the menadione-induced inactivation of IRP-1 affect the expression of IRE-containing mRNAs? We first examined whether MSB modulates TfR mRNA expression. B6 cells were treated with 100 μm desferrioxamine for 6 h to increase the steady-state levels of TfR mRNA as a result of IRP-1 activation. To assess the effects of MSB on TfR mRNA stabilization, 100 μm MSB was administered together with desferrioxamine for 2 h, in the presence or absence of the antioxidant NAC (30 mm). Following the removal of MSB, incubation with desferrioxamine was continued for up to 6 h, with or without NAC. This treatment is sufficient to allow a partial stabilization of TfR mRNA (9Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). To induce complete stabilization or degradation of TfR mRNA, as a control, cells were treated with 100 μmdesferrioxamine or heme arginate overnight. Northern blot analysis (Fig. 7, upper panel) shows that MSB down-regulates TfR mRNA to the levels of untreated cells, and this effect is inhibited by NAC (lanes 1 and4–6). Equal RNA loading was confirmed by hybridization with a ferritin H chain probe (Fig. 7, bottom panel). Consistent with previous results (9Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), ferritin H chain mRNA levels are increased after treatment with heme arginate (lane 3), likely due to heme-induced transcriptional activation (30Coccia E.M. Profita V. Fiorucci G. Romeo G. Affabris E. Testa U. Hentze M.W. Battistini A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3015-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments employing iron-starved cells (preincubated overnight with desferrioxamine) did not show any significant menadione-induced changes on TfR mRNA steady-state levels (data not shown). Considering that under these conditions TfR mRNA molecules are protected by binding of iron regulatory proteins to their IREs, it is conceivable that the IRPs already engaged in complexes with IREs are less susceptible to menadione-induced inactivation. The expression of ferritin is controlled at the translational level by the IRE/IRP regulatory system. The switch of IRP-1 from aconitase to IRE binding activity inhibits ferritin mRNA translation. To analyze the effect of menadione on ferritin biosynthesis, B6 cells were pretreated overnight with 5 μm ferric ammonium citrate to increase basal levels of ferritin expression and subsequently subjected to treatment with 100 μm MSB for 2 h in the presence or absence of the antioxidant NAC (30 mm). Following metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine, ferritin biosynthesis was assessed by immunoprecipitation. Iron manipulations with 100 μm heme arginate or desferrioxamine result in a profound stimulation or inhibition, respectively, of ferritin translation (Fig. 8 A,lanes 1–3). Likewise, extracellular oxidative stress after treatment with 100 μm H2O2, which activates IRE binding (8Martins E.A.L. Robalinho R.L. Meneghini R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 9Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), inhibits ferritin synthesis (lane 7). Unexpectedly, menadione-induced oxidative stress, under conditions where IRP-1 is completely inactivated, also inhibits ferritin synthesis (compare lanes 1 and 4). This inhibitory effect of MSB is antagonized by addition of NAC (lanes 5–6). It should be noted that oxidative stress results in an apparent inhibition of global protein synthesis, as the radioactivity of trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material in extracts of MSB- and H2O2-treated cells constitutes only ∼15–20% of that in control extracts (this refers to Fig. 8, A andB). To compare the specific effects of oxidative stress on ferritin biosynthesis, immunoprecipitations were performed after normalization for trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactivity. The data presented in Fig. 8 A show that the inhibitory effect of MSB is not due to the global reduction of protein synthesis but specific for ferritin, because the synthesis of an unrelated polypeptide, the spliceosomal protein U1A, is not affected by any of the treatments. In addition, the results shown in Fig. 7 (bottom panel) indicate that the steady-state levels of ferritin H chain mRNA are not affected by MSB. The apparent inhibition of ferritin mRNA translation by MSB is unexpected in the light of the MSB-induced inactivation of IRE binding. To further investigate this, the previously described stably transfected cell line B6.IREhGH (10Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) was utilized to assess the effects of MSB on the expression of an hGH indicator mRNA, which is under the control of a ferritin IRE in its 5′-untranslated region. Cells were subjected to iron manipulations with 100 μm heme arginate or desferrioxamine for 4 h or oxidative stress by treatment with 100 μm extracellular H2O2 for 1 h or 100 μm MSB for 2 h. Following metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine, biosynthesis of (endogenous) ferritin and (transfected) hGH were analyzed by immunoprecipitation. As in wild type B6 cells (Fig. 8 A), ferritin expression in B6.IREhGH cells was repressed by both extracellular H2O2 and MSB (data not shown). In contrast, hGH biosynthesis is inhibited by extracellular H2O2 and even slightly enhanced by MSB (Fig.8 B). We conclude that the inactivation of IRP-1 by MSB derepresses the translation of the IRE-regulated hGH reporter mRNA. However, this does not apply to the translation of ferritin mRNA, which appears to be specifically inhibited by a mechanism involving non-IRE sequences in response to menadione-induced oxidative stress. Menadione-induced oxidative stress regulates IRP-1 in a biphasic mode. Initially, relatively low concentrations (10–100 μm) of MSB elicit a partial activation of IRE binding within 15–30 min, which is accompanied by the inactivation of its cytoplasmic aconitase activity. Subsequently, higher (50–100 μm) concentrations of MSB administered to cells for 2 h inhibit both the IRE binding and aconitase activities of IRP-1. The presence or absence of the 4Fe-4S cluster is a critical determinant for the function of IRP-1 as an aconitase or as an IRE-binding protein. On that basis, the early response of IRP-1 to menadione can be interpreted as a “classical,” though incomplete, Fe-S cluster switch. The mechanism underlying the oxidative stress-mediated Fe-S switch of IRP-1 has remained elusive. The sensitivity of the Fe-S cluster in the bacterial transcription factor FNR under aerobic conditions (31Lazazzera B.A. Beinert H. Khoroshilova N. Kennedy M.C. Kiley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2762-2768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and the inactivation of the 4Fe-4S cluster in bacterial and mammalian mitochondrial aconitases by O·̄2 (32Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19328-19333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) formed a basis to propose a “direct attack” model to explain the oxidative stress-mediated Fe-S switch in IRP-1. According to this, the Fe-S cluster of IRP-1 is liable to direct chemical modification and/or removal by ROS (34Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 174-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Recent data have defined conditions of intracellular oxidative stress that are not sufficient to activate IRP-1 (11Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. Atzberger A. Ansorge W. Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9802-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent evidence suggests that the activation of IRP-1 by extracellular H2O2 operates via a stress-response signaling pathway and not solely by a direct interaction of IRP-1 with H2O2 (10Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 11Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. Atzberger A. Ansorge W. Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 10559-10563Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 35Hentze M.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 282-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The early responses of IRP-1 to MSB do not rule out the possibility that quinone-induced oxidative stress may promote conditions favoring a destabilization of the 4Fe-4S cluster by ROS. An alternative scenario would be that menadione and extracellular H2O2may activate the same stress-response pathway, at least in the early stages of MSB treatment, considering the early similarities in their effects on IRP-1 (partial activation of IRE binding within 15–30 min; Fig. 2 A and Refs. 8Martins E.A.L. Robalinho R.L. Meneghini R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar and 9Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Under many experimental conditions, the functions of IRP-1 as a cytoplasmic aconitase or an IRE-binding protein have been found to be inversely correlated. Here we show that MSB treatment for >1 h leads to a decline of both aconitase and IRE binding activities. Such an inactivation of IRP-1 has not been elicited by other stimuli so far. When B6 cells were subjected to prolonged incubations with 100 μm paraquat, another redox cycling drug, the IRE binding activity was partially induced (9Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). On the other hand, treatment of Ltk− cells with diamide, a strong oxidant, resulted in a reversible inactivation of IRE binding, which could be recoveredin vivo by iron starvation after removing diamide from the cells and in vitro by treatment of cell extracts with 2-mercaptoethanol (36Müllner E.W. Rothenberger S. Müller A.M. Kühn L.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We have reproduced these data in parallel treatments of cells with paraquat, diamide, and MSB and found that only MSB leads to a nonreversible decrease in the IRE binding activity of IRP-1 (data not shown). Thus, the inactivation of both IRP-1 functions appears to be a more specific response to menadione- (or quinone-) induced oxidative stress. What is the molecular basis for this inactivation of IRP-1 (and IRP-2)? The biological effects of menadione and other quinones are based on their potential to undergo redox cycling and thus generate ROS, and on their electrophile character in nucleophilic addition reactions, resulting in depletion of glutathione (15Cadenas E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). We suggest that the inactivation of IRPs observed here could be a result of a nonreversible oxidation of critical amino acid residue(s) in IRPs by ROS generated via quinone-induced oxidative stress. This may lead to a rearrangement of the protein folding associated with functional inactivation. The pharmacological depletion of glutathione in B6 cells (Ref. 11Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. Atzberger A. Ansorge W. Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9802-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar and Fig.4 C) and in rats (13Cairo G. Tacchini L. Pogliaghi G. Anzon E. Tomasi A. Bernelli- Zazzera A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 700-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) alone is not sufficient to elicit significant effects on the IRE binding activity of IRP-1. However, depletion of glutathione appears to render IRP-1 more susceptible to the putative oxidative inactivation by menadione (Fig. 4 C). In agreement with this scenario, the antioxidantN-acetylcysteine antagonizes IRP-1 inactivation by scavenging the ROS. The critical oxidation step may be preceded by a partial or complete disassembly of the Fe-S cluster. The targets of nonreversible oxidation of proteins under conditions of oxidative stress are not necessarily specific, because all amino acid residues are sensitive to oxidant attack by hydroxyl radicals, generated via the Fenton/Haber-Weiss reactions (reviewed in Ref. 37Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar). Inside the cell, oxidized proteins are usually prone to degradation by the proteasome (reviewed in Ref. 38Grune T. Reinheckel T. Davies K.J.A. FASEB J. 1996; 11: 526-534Crossref Scopus (726) Google Scholar). This implies that the putative oxidation of IRP-1 by menadione-induced oxidative stress may affect its half-life, which is otherwise relatively long (>12 h) (25Pantopoulos K. Gray N. Hentze M.W. RNA. 1995; 1: 155-163PubMed Google Scholar, 39Tang C.K. Chin J. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24466-24470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even though we have not determined the half-life of IRP-1 in menadione-treated cells, the data presented in Fig. 6 exclude the possibility that IRP-1 inactivation by menadione is due to protein degradation. The menadione-induced inactivation of IRP-1 modulates the expression of IRE-containing mRNAs at the levels of mRNA stability and translation. First, it inhibits the increase in TfR mRNA levels by iron starvation in B6 cells. Second, it leads to a specific translational derepression of an IRE-controlled hGH reporter mRNA in stably transfected B6.IREhGH cells. Considering the inhibitory effects of oxidative stress on global translation (see “Results”), the stimulation of hGH mRNA translation is relative. On the other hand, in contrast to the apparent translational stimulation of the hGH indicator (Fig. 8 B), MSB appears to elicit a specific translational inhibition of endogenous ferritin mRNAs (Fig.8 A). The underlying mechanism remains to be defined. However, technical reasons also need to be considered as explanations for the observed failure to identify de novo synthesized ferritin (Fig. 8 A); a possibly oxidative modification of newly synthesized ferritin polypeptides may lead to their degradation or negatively affect their recognition by the ferritin antibodies. We conclude that menadione-induced oxidative stress controls both IRP-1 activities and thereby controls cellular iron metabolism via the IRE/IRP regulatory system. The effects of menadione are clearly distinct from those of extracellular H2O2, emphasizing the notion that IRP-1 responds differentially to diverse oxidative stress stimuli. We thank Drs. Thomas Preiss and Dirk Ostareck for critical reading of the manuscript and for helpful suggestions."

However, the uncoupled GTPase activity of the V400G and H448E mutants is severely impaired, theV max values being 11- and 40-fold lower, respectively. Both mutant forms promoted fMet-tRNAfMet binding to 70 S ribosomes with similar efficiencies and were as sensitive to competitive inhibition by GDP as wild-type IF2. Formation of the first peptide bond, as measured by the puromycin reaction, was completely inhibited in the presence of the H448E mutant but still significant in the case of the V400G mutant. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation revealed that, in contrast to wild-type IF2, both mutant proteins stay blocked on the ribosome after formation of the 70 S initiation complex. This probably explains their dominant negative effect in vivo. Our results underline the importance of GTP hydrolysis for the recycling of IF2.

The functional 70 S initiation complex ready for elongation contains only the initiator tRNA and mRNA. During its formation the initiation factors are released and GTP is hydrolyzed. The presence and hydrolysis of GTP which are directly linked to the presence of IF2 have been shown to be essential for initiation of protein biosynthesis (4Laalami S. Timofeev A.V. Putzer H. Leautey J. Grunberg-Manago M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of GTP is still not clear. IF2 is one of the largest G-proteins known, and, in contrast to other proteins of this class which carry the G-domain in their N-terminal region, the G-domain of IF2 is centrally located in the protein. IF2 has been shown to bind GTP with a 10-fold lower affinity than GDP, in contrast to EF-Tu which binds GTP 100 times less efficiently than GDP (5Fasano O. Bruns W. Crechet J.B. Sander G. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 89: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 6Pon C.L. Paci M. Pawlik R.T. Gualerzi C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8918-8924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its lower overall affinity for guanine nucleotides (1000-fold for GDP, 10-fold for GTP) might enable IF2 to self-cycle from the GDP to the GTP state. Free IF2 does not show any GTPase activity; this is induced upon binding of the 50 S subunit during 70 S complex formation. The IF2 GTPase depends completely on the presence of the ribosome (7Grunberg-Manago M. Dessen P. Pantaloni D. Godefroy-Colburn T. Wolfe A.D. Dondon J. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 94: 461-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 8Kolakofsky D. Dewey K.F. Hershey J.W.B. Thach R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 1066-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, in Bacillus stearothermophilus, both IF2 and its isolated G-domain were shown to be capable of hydrolyzing GTP in the absence of ribosomes when 20% ethanol was included in the reaction (9Gualerzi C.O. Severini M. Spurio R. La Taena A. Pon C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16356-16362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to define the E. coli IF2 G-domain more precisely, we had previously mutated very conserved residues suspected to be involved in GTP binding or hydrolysis and assessed the effect of these mutant proteins in vivo in a strain carrying a null mutation in the chromosomal copy of infB (4Laalami S. Timofeev A.V. Putzer H. Leautey J. Grunberg-Manago M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The different mutations globally confirmed a theoretical three-dimensional model of the IF2 G-domain (10Cenatiempo Y. Deville F. Dondon J. Grunberg-Manago M. Sacerdot C. Hershey J.W.B. Hansen H.F. Petersen H.U. Clark B.F.C. Kjeldgaard M. la Cour T.F.M. Mortensen K.K. Nyborg J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5070-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and demonstrated the crucial importance of GTP hydrolysis in translation initiation. Six out of seven mutations in that study were lethal and of those, two (Val400 to Gly and His448 to Glu) exhibited a strong dominant inhibitory effect over the wild-type protein (4Laalami S. Timofeev A.V. Putzer H. Leautey J. Grunberg-Manago M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). An alignment of the primary structures of several G-domains reveals that the valine 400 residue of IF2 is equivalent to valine at position 20 in E. coli EF-Tu and, from a structural point of view, corresponds to glycine at position 12 in the mammalian protooncogenic Ha-ras protein, p21. Indeed, these residues are found within the G1 region (GXXXXGK), a consensus element of the G-domain specifically involved in the interaction with the α and β phosphates of GDP/GTP (11Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 721-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 12La Cour T.F.M. Nyborg J. Thirup S. Clark B.F.C.

A V20G substitution in E. coli EF-Tu (analogous to the V400G mutation in IF2) causes a 5–10-fold reduction in GTPase activity and impairs its stimulation by the ribosome (14Jacquet E. Parmeggiani A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2861-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Jacquet E. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The histidine 448 residue of IF2, the last residue of the second consensus element (DXXGH) constituting the G-domain, is well conserved in initiation and elongation factors of different organisms (16Dever T.E. Glynias M.J. Merrick W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1814-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 17Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). Mutations of the corresponding residue of EF-Tu (His84) underline the importance of this residue for polypeptide synthesis and GTP hydrolysis (18Scarano G. Krab I.M. Bocchini V. Parmeggiani A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19Cool R.H. Parmeggiani A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) but it is not yet clear how this residue, which is not in direct contact with the γ-phosphate of GTP, participates in GTP hydrolysis (20Berchtold H. Reshetnikova L. Reiser C.O.A. Schirmer N.K. Sprinzl M. Hilgenfeld R. Nature. 1993; 365: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The work presented here follows up on our in vivo studies and describes the major biochemical and enzymatic characteristics of the V400G and H448E IF2 mutants in vitro. Based on their impaired GTPase activity and their incapacity to leave the initiation complex and permit elongation, we present a rationale for the dominant inhibitory effect of the two mutant IF2 proteins. Strains and plasmids used are described in Table I. All strains were grown in Luria Bertani (LB) medium.

Timofeev A.V. Putzer H. Leautey J. Grunberg-Manago M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), giving rise to pSL4V400G and pSL4H448E. In these plasmids, expression of the mutantinfB genes is under control of the thermoinducible pL and pR promotors. The correct insertion and the presence of the mutation in the inserted fragments were confirmed by DNA sequencing (22Sanger F. Nicklin S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52671) Google Scholar). In order to purify the mutated IF2α proteins without contamination of the wild-type protein we constructed a strain (SL679R) that expresses only the short form (β) of the factor. The 1.6-kilobaseBglII-HindIII fragment of pB18Δ45 (23Sacerdot C. Vachon G. Laalami S. Morel-Deville F. Cenatiempo Y. Grunberg-Manago M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), carrying the mutant infB gene expressing only the β form of IF2 was cloned into the low copy number plasmid pCL1920 (24Lerner C.G. Inouye M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4631Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid, pCLΔinfB45, was used to transform the strain SL598R (21Laalami S. Putzer H. Plumbridge J. Grunberg-Manago M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 335-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Curing of the λinfB transducing phage was performed as described in Ref.21Laalami S. Putzer H. Plumbridge J. Grunberg-Manago M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 335-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar. This gave rise to strain SL679R that expresses only the short form of the factor. Strain SL679R was transformed with the plasmids pSL4V400G and pSL4H448E. The strains were grown at 30 °C in LB medium in the presence of ampicillin and chloramphenicol to an OD550 = 1, then the temperature was shifted to 42 °C to allow expression of the mutant proteins from the thermoinducible pLpR promoters and incubation was carried on for 2 more hours. The culture was chilled on ice, the cells harvested, washed, and kept frozen at −80 °C. Overexpression of the mutant IF2 proteins was monitored by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and immunoblotting of aliquots at different times during heat induction. Cell disruption and preparation of a crude extract was performed as described (25Dondon J. Plumbridge J.A. Hershey J.W.B. Grunberg-Manago M. Biochimie (Paris). 1985; 67: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A 50% ammonium sulfate precipitate was resuspended in LSB buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 1 mmMgOAc, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol) and dialyzed against the same buffer for 2 × 1 h. Proteins were then loaded on a Mono Q column (Pharmacia) and eluted with a 200–500 mm KCl gradient in LSB buffer. Fractions containing IF2α protein were pooled and, after lowering the salt concentration to about 100 mm by dilution with LSB buffer, loaded on a Mono S column (Pharmacia) and separated by a 200–400 mm KCl gradient in LSB buffer. Ribosome tight couples (70 S) and ribosomal subunits (30 S and 50 S) were isolated from E. coli MRE600 cells, freshly harvested from exponential growth phase, based on methods described in detail elsewhere (26Weiel J. Hershey J.W.B. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5859-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) except that the ribosomal subunits were fractionated on a 10–30% (w/w) hyperbolic sucrose gradient in a Beckmann SW28 rotor at 27,000 rpm at 4 °C for 14 h. IF2-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis was measured as described (10Cenatiempo Y. Deville F. Dondon J. Grunberg-Manago M. Sacerdot C. Hershey J.W.B. Hansen H.F. Petersen H.U. Clark B.F.C.

Nature. 1969; 223: 694-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Reactions (25 μl) were stopped with a mixture of 100 μl of 1 m perchloric acid and 1 ml of 1 m KH2PO4 and the amount of [32P]phosphate liberated during the reaction was determined as described previously (28Beaudry P. Sander G. Grunberg-Manago M. Douzou P. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Kinetic constants were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots based on initial rate measurements carried out with [γ-32P]GTP concentrations of 5–50 μm, which is in the K m range of wild-type IF2. Reactions contained limiting amounts of IF2 with respect to 30 S and 50 S ribosomal subunits, initiation factors IF1 and IF3, polyAUG and labeled f[3H]Met-tRNAfMet. The exact concentrations are given in the legend to Fig. 3. The reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 5 min. Ribosome bound fMet-tRNAfMet was measured by filter binding assay (29Nirenberg M.W. Leder P. Science. 1964; 145: 1399-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The effect of GDP on the fMet-tRNAfMet binding reaction was studied by keeping the GTP concentration in the reaction constant at 0.1 mm and varying the GDP concentration in steps from 0 to 10 mm GDP (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 mm). The fMet-tRNAfMetbinding reaction was carried out for 15 min and the puromycin reaction for 20 min. The reaction buffer was the same as described for fMet-tRNAfMet binding except that the magnesium acetate concentration was 10 mm. The reactions were diluted with 100 μl of cold reaction buffer, chilled on ice, and loaded on a 7–20% sucrose gradient in the same buffer. The gradients were centrifuged at 23,000 rpm in a Beckmann SW41 rotor for 12.5 h. 500-μl fractions were collected and proteins were precipitated with trichloracetic acid and dissolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. The fractions were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-IF2 antibodies. The E. colitranslation initiation factor IF2 exists as two forms in the cell, IF2α and IF2β, which support bacterial growth equally well under normal growth conditions (23Sacerdot C. Vachon G. Laalami S. Morel-Deville F. Cenatiempo Y. Grunberg-Manago M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In order to purify the large form, IF2α, of two IF2 mutants (V400G and H448E) without contamination by wild-type protein we constructed a strain (SL679R, TableI) expressing only the short form IF2β. This strain is a derivative of SL598R (21Laalami S. Putzer H. Plumbridge J. Grunberg-Manago M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 335-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and carries the same replacement of the chromosomal copy of the infB gene by acat cassette. Survival of the cell is assured by the recombinant plasmid pCLΔinfB45 expressing solely the β form of the factor. The mutated infB alleles are supplied by a second compatible plasmid and their expression is controlled by the λ thermoinducible promoters pRpL. Expression of the mutant proteins was induced by shifting the temperature of the culture from 30 °C to 42 °C. The α-form of both mutant proteins was purified from these strains by fast protein liquid chromatography techniques described under “Experimental Procedures” and tested in a variety of in vitro assays. As shown previously (4Laalami S. Timofeev A.V. Putzer H. Leautey J. Grunberg-Manago M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), both IF2 mutations, V400G and H448E, are lethal to E. coli. To determine whether they were affected in their ability to hydrolyze GTPin vitro, we performed an uncoupled GTPase assay, where the initial rate of [γ-32P]GTP hydrolysis by IF2 was measured in the presence of 70 S ribosomes, but in the absence of any tRNA or mRNA. As shown in Fig. 1, both mutants have practically lost their ability to hydrolyze GTP. We also measured the initial rates of GTP hydrolysis by wild-type and mutant forms of IF2 as a function of increasing GTP concentration. The resulting double-reciprocal plot is shown in Fig.2. Determination of theK m values derived from Fig. 2 revealed that the affinity of neither of the mutant proteins for GTP is reduced compared with wild-type IF2 (Table II). On the contrary, the respective K m values are slightly lower than that of the wild-type protein, especially in the case of the V400G mutant (15.3 μm versus 30 μm for the wild-type protein).Table IIKm andVmax values for the uncoupled GTPase activity of wild-type and mutant IF2 proteins.Vmax is expressed as moles of GTP hydrolyzed per mole of factor per minute.IF2K mV maxwt30 ± 5 μm0.8 ± 0.16V400G15.3 ± 3.9 μm0.07 ± 0.015H448E24.7 ± 3.5 μm0.02 ± 0.01 Open table in a new tab The velocity of the uncoupled GTPase activity of the mutant proteins is strongly reduced compared with that of the wild-type IF2, however. As determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots (Fig. 2), the V400G and the H448E mutants exhibit 11.4- and 40-fold lower V maxvalues than the wild-type protein, respectively (Table II). This clearly indicates that it is the catalytic activity, and not the ability to bind the substrate, that is impaired in the mutants. On the other hand, this loss of activity is not sufficient in itself to explain their dominant negative behavior over the wild-type proteinin vivo. The main role of IF2 in translation initiation is to promote fMet-tRNAfMet binding to the ribosome. We tested the ability of both mutant proteins to promote fMet-tRNAfMet binding to 70 S ribosomes (30 S + 50 S subunits) in the presence of translation initiation factors IF1 and IF3. Fig. 3 shows the initial rate of factor-dependent fMet-tRNAfMet binding for the different IF2 proteins. The V400G mutant is 1.5-fold more active and the H448E mutant 1.3-fold less active than the wild-type IF2. We also measured the efficiency of fMet-tRNAfMet binding as a function of GTP concentration. The capacity to promote this reaction increases for all three proteins in the 0 to 1 mmGTP range (Fig. 4). In this assay the activity of the V400G mutant is slightly lower than that observed with wild-type IF2. The H448E mutant promotes about 60% of tRNA binding compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. 4), but this level still represents a full stoichiometric binding of fMet-tRNAfMet. As described above, the binding of GTP to the mutant IF2 proteins as analyzed by K m measurements of the uncoupled GTPase activity is not impaired. In order to detect potential differences in the sensitivity of the mutant proteins to the presence of GDP we measured the inhibitory effect of various GDP concentrations on fMet-tRNAfMet binding in the presence of a constant GTP concentration (0.1 mm). The results are summarized in Table III. The two mutant IF2s appear to be slightly more inhibited at very low GDP concentrations, but the overall pattern of inhibition is practically identical for all three proteins.Table IIIInhibitory effect of GDP on IF2-dependent fMet-tRNAfMet binding to ribosomes (GTP = 0.1 mm)GDP% of fMet-tRNAfMet bound to 70 S ribosomeswtV400GH448Emm0100 ± 5.7100 ± 3.4100 ± 2.40.0194.5 ± 3.263.8 ± 2.362 ± 0.50.149.5 ± 1.548.3 ± 2.859 ± 4.2123.4 ± 2.513.9 ± 4.120 ± 3.1101.5 ± 0.83.3 ± 0.61.6 ± 0.7fMet-tRNAfMet bound in the absence of GDP is considered as 100% binding. Open table in a new tab fMet-tRNAfMet bound in the absence of GDP is considered as 100% binding. The correct positioning of fMet-tRNAfMet is promoted by IF2 and IF3 and is essential for peptide bond formation during the first round of elongation. We measured the capacity of the mutant proteins to promote formation of the first peptide bond in the puromycin reaction, as a function of the GTP concentration (Fig.5). Upon addition of GTP, the wild-type protein and the V400G mutant quickly reach their full activity with an only slight increase in efficiency in the 0.25 to 1 mm GTP range. In contrast, no formation of fMet-puromycin can be observed, regardless of the GTP concentration, when the initiation complex was formed with the H448E IF2 mutant (Fig. 5). If one relates these data to the quantity of fMet-tRNAfMet bound to ribosome it becomes apparent that in the presence of the V400G mutant almost 100% of the fMet-tRNAfMet is converted to fMet-puromycin (compare Figs. 4 and 5). On the other hand, based on the quantity of fMet-tRNAfMet initially bound, more than twice as much puromycin-fMet-tRNAfMet is formed in the presence of wild-type IF2. This suggests that IF2 and hence ribosome recycling is more efficient with wild-type factor. GTP hydrolysis is believed to be essential for the recycling of IF2. We thus tested to see whether the wild-type and the mutants proteins were still associated with the ribosome after the puromycin reaction. This was done by separating the ribosomes contained in the reaction mixture on sucrose gradients and by analyzing the different fractions for the presence or absence of IF2 by Western blot (Fig. 6). In the case of the wild-type protein, practically all the IF2 had left the ribosome after the puromycin reaction and was present in the top fractions of the gradient, where unbound proteins are to be found. In contrast, both mutant proteins stay bound to the ribosome and are found in the 30 S, 50 S, and 70 S regions of the gradient. We thus conclude that neither of the mutant factors are efficiently recycled following formation of the first peptide bond. The role of GTP and its hydrolysis during translation initiation has never been clear. Earlier in vitro studies, using non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs, had suggested that GTP hydrolysis may be important for the release of IF2 from the 70 S initiation complex (30Lelong J.C. Grunberg-Manago M. Dondon J. Gros D. Gros F. Nature. 1970; 226: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Lockwood A.H. Sarkar P. Maitra U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lockwood A.H. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2884-2894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We wished to carry out a mutational analysis to test this hypothesis, to precisely define the amino acid residues involved in GTP hydrolysis and to correlate the in vivo phenotype of a mutant protein to its characteristics in vitro. If the analogy between the EF-Tu G-domain structure and the three-dimensional model for the IF2 G-domain holds true, then the IF2 V400G and H448E mutants should only be impaired in their catalytic (GTPase) activity but not in their affinity for the substrate as is the case for equivalent (V20G) or similar (H84G) substitutions in EF-Tu (15Jacquet E. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 19Cool R.H. Parmeggiani A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This is exactly what we observed, the V maxvalues for the V400G and H448E mutants being 11.4- and 40-fold lower than that observed for the wild-type GTPase, respectively. At the same time, the affinity for GTP was not adversely affected, but rather slightly increased, up to 2-fold in the case of the V400G mutant (TableII). It is interesting to note that the equivalent mutation in EF-Tu (V20G) led, on the contrary, to a less efficient binding of GTP (15Jacquet E. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The V20G mutation in EF-Tu caused a 5–10-fold decrease in GTPase activity and impaired its stimulation by the ribosome (14Jacquet E. Parmeggiani A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2861-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Jacquet E. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The impaired GTPase activity of the IF2 V400G mutant thus indicates that the capacity to hydrolyze GTP, although totally dependent on the presence of the 50 S ribosomal subunit, resides within the IF2 protein itself. The main function of IF2 in the cell is the binding and correct positioning of fMet-tRNAfMet on the 70 S ribosome for the subsequent elongation step. As shown in Fig. 3 both wild-type and mutant proteins promote fMet-tRNAfMet binding to the ribosome in a GTP-dependent manner. In the absence of GTP, very little or no binding was observed. Binding of fMet-tRNAfMet to the ribosome is especially sensitive to the presence of GTP when IF2 is present at low (catalytic) concentrations, as is the case in the experiments reported here (32Fakunding J.L. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4206-4212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Dubnoff J.S. Lockwood A.H. Maitra U. J. Biol.

Thach R.E. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 229: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Both mutant proteins promote efficient fMet-tRNAfMet binding to the ribosome (Fig. 4). A comparison of initial rate measurements in the presence of 1 mm GTP (Fig. 3) revealed slight differences, with the V400G mutant being 1.5 times faster than the wild-type protein. On the other hand, the H448E mutant was somewhat slower (1.3-fold) than the wild-type protein. At optimal GTP concentrations (1 mm), the H448E mutant is still able to bind fMet-tRNAfMet in stoichiometric quantities. The wild-type protein binds fMet-tRNAfMet most efficiently, due to factor recycling, but the V400G mutant also seems to exhibit some catalytic activity (Fig. 4). It was observed previously (6Pon C.L. Paci M. Pawlik R.T. Gualerzi C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8918-8924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that, at low concentrations of wild-type IF2 and 30 S subunits, GDP acts as a competitive inhibitor of 30 S initiation complex formation. We obtained comparable results when measuring the formation of 70 S initiation complex in the presence of limiting amounts of IF2. The capacity of both wild-type and mutant proteins to promote fMet-tRNAfMetbinding to 70 S ribosomes was inhibited by GDP to roughly the same extent in all three cases (Table III). This suggests that the overall affinities for GDP and GTP are not significantly altered in either IF2 mutant relative to the wild-type protein. Since the mutant IF2 proteins mediate fMet-tRNAfMet binding to the ribosome, this cannot account for their incapacity to support growth. However, a difference between the wild-type and the mutant proteins was observed in the formation of the first peptide bond, measured by the puromycin reaction. Due to factor recycling, wild-type IF2 leads to the formation of 2.5 times more fMet-puromycin than fMet-tRNAfMet initially bound (compare Figs. 4 and 5). The H448E mutant is completely inactive in promoting the formation of fMet-puromycin, the V400G mutant allows the stoichiometric conversion of all bound fMet-tRNAfMet into fMet-puromycin, indicating that it is not recycled. The activity of the IF2 V400G mutant can be explained in two ways. Either the residual GTPase activity is sufficient for some factor release to occur, or the formation of fMet-puromycin can still take place even with the factor bound to the ribosome. While we cannot rule out that some GTP hydrolysis contributes to the overall activity observed, we rather favor the second possibility. Formation of fMet-puromycin was assayed under conditions close to those used for determining the initial rates of the uncoupled GTPase (i.e. reaction time, IF2:ribosome ratio) and where neither of the mutant proteins showed detectable GTPase activity (Fig. 1). Moreover, puromycin is a very small molecule compared with the EF-Tu·GTP·aa-tRNA ternary complex normally involved in the formation of the first peptide bond and might still be able to react with fMet-tRNAfMetdespite the presence of IF2. Experiments with a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog (GDPCH2P) support this possibility. First peptide bond formation in the presence of wild-type IF2 and GDPCH2P still occurred substantially when assayed via the formation of fMet-puromycin (36Benne R. Voorma H.O. FEBS Lett. 1972; 20: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus we believe that IF2 V400G does not hydrolyze GTP and leave the ribosome but still permits near stoichiometric conversion of bound fMet-tRNAfMet into fMet-puromycin (compare Figs. 4 and 5). In the case of the H448E mutant we speculate that the fMet-tRNAfMet is not correctly positioned with respect to the peptidyl-hydrolase center, or its conformation is different to that of the wild-type or the V400G IF2, such that the amino acid moiety on the tRNA is shielded, thereby inhibiting the puromycin reaction. The differential behavior of the two GTPase mutants also suggests that there is no direct link between GTP hydrolysis and the first peptide bond formation. This conclusion is supported by previous experiments where GTP was removed from the 30 S initiation complex without altering the ability of the subsequent 70 S complex to participate in peptide bond formation (33Dubnoff J.S. Lockwood A.H. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2884-2894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in the 1970's, using non-hydrolyzable GTP analogues (30Lelong J.C. Grunberg-Manago M. Dondon J. Gros D. Gros F. Nature. 1970; 226: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Lockwood A.H. Sarkar P. Maitra U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lockwood A.H. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2884-2894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have led to the current belief that GTP hydrolysis is necessary for the rapid release of IF2. Our experiments strongly support this view. When the puromycin reactions are subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation it is apparent that only the wild-type IF2 leaves the ribosome. Several conclusions can be drawn from this observation. First of all, the fact that the mutant factors are not released from the ribosome after formation of fMet-puromycin provides a good explanation for their dominant negative behavior in vivo. Translation factor-dependent GTP hydrolysis involves an interaction with the ribosomal GTPase center on the 50 S subunit which encompasses the binding sites for L11 and the pentameric protein complex L10·(L12)4 (37Rosendahl G. Douthwaite S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 1013-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 38Egebjerg J. Douthwaite S.R. Liljas A. Garrett R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). IF2 and EF-Tu have both been shown to interact with this region of the ribosome (39Kay A. Sander G. Grunberg-Manago M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 51: 979-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 40Heimark R.L. Hershey J.W. Traut R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 779-784Google Scholar, 41Langer J.A. Lake J.A. J.

An IF2 molecule which stays blocked on the ribosome would inhibit binding of the ternary EF-Tu·GTP·aa-tRNA complex and consequently subsequent elongation steps. The difference observed between the two mutants in the puromycin reaction can only account for the correct positioning of the fMet-tRNA on the ribosome, but not for its ability to promote formation of the first peptide bond. The question remains why the dominant negative effect of the IF2 V400G mutant is stronger than that of the H448E mutant (4Laalami S. Timofeev A.V. Putzer H. Leautey J. Grunberg-Manago M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), despite a slightly higher residual GTPase activity. A likely answer is provided by the sucrose gradient experiment. After centrifugation, all of the IF2 V400G cosediments with the different ribosomal particles and none has dissociated sufficiently from the 70 S ribosome to be found at the top of the gradient. On the other hand, the H448E mutant clearly dissociates more easily as judged by a steady increase of the IF2 concentration toward the 30 S fractions and the top of the gradient. In the case of the V400G mutant at least, the presence of factor in the 50 S region of the gradient reflects, to some extent, binding of IF2 to this ribosomal subunit. Recentrifugation of the different gradient fractions through a sucrose cushion revealed some IF2 V400G associated with the 50 S subunit (data not shown). The increased ability of the H448E mutant to dissociate from the ribosome, despite its practically inexistent GTPase activity, probably explains why this mutant is less inhibitory to bacterial growth in the presence of wild-type IF2. This observation also underlines the importance of the conformational state of IF2 for binding to the ribosome. Independent of the GTPase activity, even slight alterations of the G-domain can have important consequences for the rest of the protein, its affinity to the ribosome and the positioning and reactivity of the fMet-tRNAfMet. The weak, but inverse effect on the affinity of IF2 for GTP, relative to the corresponding V20G mutation in EF-Tu, highlights some structural differences between the two factors. Nevertheless, our results essentially confirm the close functional relationship between the EF-Tu and IF2 G-domains and show the importance of the Val400 and His448residues for GTP hydrolysis and IF2 recycling during formation of the first peptide bond.

Here the axotactin ( axo ) gene of Drosophila was shown to encode a member of the neurexin protein superfamily secreted by glia and subsequently localized to axonal tracts. Null mutations of axo caused temperature-sensitive paralysis and a corresponding blockade of axonal conduction. Thus, the AXO protein appears to be a component of a glial-neuronal signaling mechanism that helps to determine the membrane electrical properties of target axons."

Results from the three independent lines of experiments have clearly indicated the effect of the copolymer in promoting pyrimidine motif triplex formation at neutral pH. In the presence of the copolymer, the binding constant for pyrimidine motif triplex formation at neutral pH was about 100 times higher than that observed with TFO alone. Moreover, the triplex-promoting efficiency of the copolymer was more than 20 times higher than that of the physiological concentration (about 1 mm) of spermine, a putative intracellular triplex stabilizer (30Thomas T. Thomas T.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14068-14074Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Kinetic data have also demonstrated that the major contribution for the copolymer-mediated promotion of triplex formation resulted from the considerable increase in the association rate constant rather than the decrease in the dissociation rate constant. The ability of the PLL-g-Dex copolymer to promote pyrimidine motif triplex formation at physiological pH would support further progress in therapeutic applications of the antigene strategy in vivo. We synthesized 23-mer complementary oligonucleotides for target duplex Pur23A and Pyr23T (Fig. 1 b) and the 15-mer homopyrimidine TFO Pyr15T (Fig.1 b) on an ABI DNA synthesizer using the solid-phase cyanoethyl phosphoramidite method and purified them with reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a Wakosil DNA column. 5′-Biotinylated Pyr23T (denoted as Bt-Pyr23T) was prepared from biotin phosphoramidite. Two different nonspecific TFOs, Pyr15NS-1 and Pyr15NS-2 (Fig. 1 b), were synthesized as mentioned above and purchased from Grainers Japan Co. (Tokyo, Japan), respectively. The concentration of all oligonucleotides was determined by UV absorbance. Complementary strands Pur23A and Pyr23T were annealed by heating at up to 90 °C, followed by a gradual cooling to room temperature. The annealed sample was applied on a hydroxyapatite column (KOKEN Inc.) to remove unpaired single strands. The concentration of the duplex DNA (Pur23A·Pyr23T) was determined by UV absorption considering the DNA concentration ratio of 1 OD = 50 μg/ml, with aM r of 15180. The purified oligonucleotide solutions were dialyzed (molecular weight cutoff = 500) extensively against Buffer A (10 mm sodium cacodylate-cacodylic acid (pH 6.8), 200 mm sodium chloride, and 20 mmmagnesium chloride) with or without the triplex stabilizer (0.84 mm spermine or 0.038 mm PLL-g-Dex copolymer). The PLL-g-Dex copolymer (number average molecular weight = 7.9 × 104) (Fig. 1 a) was prepared by a reductive amination reaction between poly (l-lysine) and dextran T-10, as described in detail previously (22Maruyama A. Katoh M. Ishihara T. Akaike T. Bioconjugate Chem. 1997; 8: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 31Maruyama A. Watanabe H. Ferdous A. Katoh M. Ishihara T. Akaike T. Bioconjugate Chem. 1998; 9: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The purified copolymer solution was dialyzed (molecular weight cutoff = 1000) extensively against Buffer A. Isothermal titration experiments were carried out on a MCS ITC system (Microcal Inc.) essentially as described previously (25Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar,26Kamiya M. Torigoe H. Shindo H. Sarai A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 4532-4538Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, the TFO and Pur23A·Pyr23T duplex DNA solutions were prepared by extensive dialysis against Buffer A with or without the triplex stabilizer. The TFO solution in Buffer A with or without the triplex stabilizer was injected 20 times in 5-μl increments at 10-min intervals into the Pur23A·Pyr23T duplex solution without changing the reaction conditions. The heat for each injection was subtracted by the heat of dilution of the injectant, which was measured by injecting the TFO into Buffer A with or without the triplex stabilizer. Each corrected heat was divided by the number of moles of TFO injected and analyzed with Microcal Origin software supplied by the manufacturer. Kinetic experiments were performed on an IAsys instrument (Affinity Sensors Cambridge Inc.), where a real-time biomolecular interaction was measured with a laser biosensor (27Cush R. Cronin J.M.

The resonant layer of a cuvette was washed with 200 μl of 10 mm acetate buffer (pH 4.6) and then activated with 200 μl of a mixture of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide andN-hydroxysuccinimide solution. The activated surface was washed again with 10 mm acetate buffer (pH 4.6), and streptavidin in 10 mm acetate buffer (pH 4.6) was immobilized on the surface. After blocking the remaining reactive groups with 1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.5), the cuvette was washed extensively with 10 mm acetate buffer (pH 4.6) and then with 20 mm hydrochloric acid to remove the loosely associated protein. The cuvette was washed with Buffer A, and Bt-Pyr23T (1.2 μm in Buffer A) was added to bind with the streptavidin on the surface. After washing the cuvette with the same buffer, complementary oligonucleotide Pur23A (1.2 μm in Buffer A) was added to hybridize with Bt-Pyr23T. After extensive washing and equilibrating of the Bt-Pyr23T·Pur23A-immobilized surface with Buffer A with or without the triplex stabilizer for more than 30 min, the TFO in 200 μl of Buffer A with or without the triplex stabilizer was injected over the immobilized Bt-Pyr23T·Pur23A duplex, and then triplex formation was monitored for 30 min. This was followed by washing the cuvette with Buffer A with or without the triplex stabilizer, and the dissociation of the preformed triplex was monitored for an additional 20 min. Finally, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) was injected for 3 min for a complete break of the Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding between the TFO and Pur23A, during which the Bt-Pyr23T·Pur23A duplex may be partially denatured. The Bt-Pyr23T·Pur23A duplex was regenerated by injecting 1.2 μm Pur23A. The resulting sensorgrams were analyzed with Fastfit software supplied by the manufacturer to calculate the kinetic parameters. EMSA experiments were performed essentially as described previously, with slight modifications (23Ferdous A. Watanabe H. Akaike T. Maruyama A.

In 9 μl of reaction mixture, 32P-labeled duplex (∼10,000 cpm; ∼1 ng) was mixed with increasing concentrations of Pyr15T and the nonspecific oligonucleotide Pyr15NS-2 in either the absence or presence of the triplex stabilizer, (spermine or the PLL-g-Dex copolymer) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.0), 100 mm sodium chloride, and 10 mmmagnesium chloride. Pyr15NS-2 was added to achieve equimolar concentrations of TFO in each lane as well as to minimize the adhesion of the DNA (target duplex and Pyr15T) to plastic surfaces during incubation and subsequent losses during processing. After a 6-h incubation at 37 °C, 2 μl of 50% glycerol solution containing bromphenol blue and 1 μl of thymus DNA (6 μg) were added without changing the pH and salt concentrations of the reaction mixtures. Thymus DNA was added to chase the ionic interaction between DNA (target duplex and TFO) and the copolymer as described previously (23Ferdous A. Watanabe H. Akaike T. Maruyama A.

Samples were then directly loaded onto a 15% native polyacrylamide gel prepared in buffer (50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, and 10 mm magnesium chloride), and electrophoresis was performed at 8 V/cm for 16 h at 4 °C. The percentage of the formed triplex was estimated as described previously (23Ferdous A. Watanabe H. Akaike T. Maruyama A.

We have examined the thermodynamics of pyrimidine motif triplex formation between the 23-bp target duplex Pur23A·Pyr23T and its specific 15-mer TFO, Pyr15T (Fig.1 b), at 25 °C and pH 6.8 by ITC under three different conditions: 1) Buffer A (10 mmsodium cacodylate-cacodylic acid at pH 6.8 containing 200 mm sodium chloride and 20 mm magnesium chloride), 2) Buffer A + 0.84 mm spermine, and 3) Buffer A + 0.038 mm PLL-g-Dex copolymer. The concentration of amino groups in 0.84 mm spermine is equivalent to that in 0.038 mm PLL-g-Dex copolymer. Fig. 2 a compares the ITC profiles of the initial three injections for triplex formation between Pyr15T and Pur23A·Pyr23T at 25 °C and pH 6.8 with TFO alone or in the presence of spermine or the PLL-g-Dex copolymer. The magnitudes of the exothermic peaks in the presence of 0.038 mm PLL-g-Dex copolymer were much larger than those observed with TFO alone. Triplex formation in the presence of 0.038 mm PLL-g-Dex copolymer reached to equilibrium within 10 min after each injection of Pyr15T. On the other hand, the magnitudes of the exothermic peaks in the presence of 0.84 mm spermine were indistinguishable from those observed with TFO alone. Fig. 2 b shows a 200-min ITC profile for triplex formation in the presence of the PLL-g-Dex copolymer. An exothermic heat pulse was observed after each injection of Pyr15T into Pur23A·Pyr23T. The magnitude of each peak decreased gradually with each new injection, and a small peak was still observed at a molar ratio of [Pyr15T]/[Pur23A·Pyr23T] = 2. The area of the small peak was equal to the heat of dilution measured in a separate experiment by injecting Pyr15T into the same buffer (data not shown). The area under each peak was integrated, and the heat of dilution of Pyr15T was subtracted from the integrated values. The corrected heat was divided by the number of moles injected, and the resulting values were plotted as a function of the molar ratio of [Pyr15T]/[Pur23A·Pyr23T], as shown in Fig. 2 c. The resulting titration plot was fitted to a sigmoidal curve by using a nonlinear least-squares method. The binding constant (K a) and the enthalpy change (ΔH) were obtained from the fitted curve (25Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar, 26Kamiya M. Torigoe H. Shindo H. Sarai A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 4532-4538Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) and the entropy change (ΔS) were calculated from the equation ΔG = −RTlnK a = ΔH − TΔS. The titration plots with TFO alone or in the presence of spermine are also shown in Fig. 2 c. The thermodynamic parameters under these conditions were obtained from these plots in the same way. Table I summarizes the thermodynamic parameters of triplex formation at 25 °C and pH 6.8 obtained from ITC under the three different conditions. The signs of both ΔH and ΔS were negative under all reaction conditions. Because an observed negative ΔS was unfavorable for triplex formation, triplex formation was driven by a large negative ΔH under each condition. The magnitude of the ΔH of pyrimidine motif triplex formation in the presence of 0.038 mm PLL-g-Dex copolymer was 2.5 times larger than those observed with TFO alone or in the presence of 0.84 mm spermine, consistent with the ITC profiles in Fig.2 a. The K a of pyrimidine motif triplex formation was increased 2.6 times or 95.9 times by the addition of 0.84 mm spermine or 0.038 mm PLL-g-Dex copolymer, respectively. Although the concentration of amino groups in 0.84 mm spermine and 0.038 mmPLL-g-Dex copolymer is equivalent, an increase inK a by the addition of 0.038 mmPLL-g-Dex copolymer was much higher than that by the addition of 0.84 mm spermine.Table IThermodynamic parameters for triplex formation between the 15-mer TFO Pyr15T and the 23-bp duplex Pur23A · Pyr23T at 25 °C and pH 6.8 in 10 mm sodium cacodylate-cacodylic acid, 200 mm sodium chloride, and 20 mm magnesium chloride with or without the triplex stabilizer obtained from ITC measurementsTriplex stabilizerK aK a(relative)ΔGΔHΔSm −1kcal mol−1cal mol−1K−1None(1.97 ± 0.43) × 1051.0−7.22 ± 0.15−34.9 ± 2.2−92.7 ± 8.00.84 mm spermine(5.15 ± 0.29) × 1052.6−7.79 ± 0.03−34.1 ± 3.2−88.2 ± 10.80.038 mmPLL-g-Dex copolymer(1.89 ± 0.32) × 10795.9−9.93 ± 0.11−87.9 ± 2.3−262 ± 8.1The concentration of Pyr15T is 120 μm in the syringe. Pyr15T is injected 20-times in 5-μl increments into Pur23A · Pyr23T. The concentration of Pur23A · Pyr23T is 5 μm in the cell. The obtained values are the average of at least three ITC experiments. Open table in a new tab The concentration of Pyr15T is 120 μm in the syringe. Pyr15T is injected 20-times in 5-μl increments into Pur23A · Pyr23T. The concentration of Pur23A · Pyr23T is 5 μm in the cell. The obtained values are the average of at least three ITC experiments. To understand the putative mechanism involved in the tremendous increase in K a of pyrimidine motif triplex formation in the presence of the PLL-g-Dex copolymer (Table I), we have assessed the kinetic parameters for the association and dissociation of Pyr15T with Pur23A·Pyr23T at 25 °C and pH 6.8 by IAsys. Fig.3 a compares the IAsys sensorgrams representing the triplex formation and dissociation involving 2.0 μm of the specific (Pyr15T) or nonspecific (Pyr15NS-1) TFOs (Fig. 1 b) and the immobilized Bt-Pyr23T·Pur23A at 25 °C and pH 6.8 in either the absence or presence of the triplex stabilizer. The injection of Pyr15T alone (Pyr15T in no stabilizer) over the immobilized Bt-Pyr23T·Pur23A caused an increased response, and the injection of Pyr15T and spermine (Pyr15T in 0.84 mm spermine) slightly increased the response. However, the response was substantially changed when Pyr15T and the PLL-g-Dex copolymer were injected (Pyr15T in 0.038 mm copolymer). It is important to note that the negligible response observed when Pyr15NS-1 was injected with the PLL-g-Dex copolymer (Pyr15NS-1 in 0.038 mmcopolymer) indicates that the specificity of triplex formation was preserved in the presence of the copolymer. Taken together, it unambiguously indicates that the PLL-g-Dex copolymer significantly increased the association rate constant of triplex formation, and its triplex-promoting efficacy was remarkably higher than that of spermine. We have measured a series of association and dissociation curves at the various concentrations of Pyr15T in the presence of the PLL-g-Dex copolymer to obtain the kinetic parameters. An increase in the concentration of Pyr15T led to a gradual change in the response of the association curves as shown in Fig.3 b. The on-rate constant (k on) was obtained from the analysis of each association curve. Fig.3 c shows a plot of k on against the concentrations of Pyr15T. The resultant plot was fitted to a straight line (r 2 = 0.98) using a linear least-squares method. The association rate constant (k assoc) was determined from the slope of the fitted line (27Cush R.

On the other hand, the off-rate constant (k off) was obtained from the analysis of each dissociation curve (Fig. 3 a; data not shown). Because k off is usually independent of the concentration of the injected solution, the dissociation rate constant (k dissoc) was determined by averagingk off for several concentrations (27Cush R.

In the present study we show that a CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) site in the proximal regulatory region is required for the phorbol ester response. Mutation of the C/EBP site results in the loss of basal and TPA-responsive activity. Gel mobility supershift analysis shows that C/EBPα binding to this site is increased by TPA treatment. Moreover, cotransfection of the human involucrin reporter plasmid with C/EBPα increases promoter activity to an extent comparable with TPA treatment. Mutation of the C/EBP-binding site eliminates these responses. Transfection experiments using GADD153 to create C/EBP-null conditions confirm that C/EBP factors are absolutely required for promoter activity and TPA responsiveness. C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ inhibit both TPA- and C/EBPα-dependent promoter activation, indicating functional differences among C/EBP family members.

The PRR drives nearly one-half of the activity of the promoter. Site specific mutation experiments indicate that an activator protein 1 (AP1)-binding site, AP1-1, located within the PRR, is absolutely required for promoter activity (20Welter J.F. Crish J.F.

Based on previous studies showing that the C/EBP-binding site of the hINV promoter is important for activity (14Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Banks E.B. Welter J.F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 501-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that C/EBP factors may have a role in regulating hINV expression during keratinocyte differentiation. In the present study we show that each C/EBP protein differentially regulates hINV promoter activity via the hINV promoter C/EBP site and that C/EBP factor binding to this site is dramatically increased following treatment of keratinocytes with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). We show that C/EBPα is a component of this complex. We also use an inhibitory member of the C/EBP family, GADD153, to show that C/EBP factor activity is required for the TPA-dependent increase in activity.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To create the C/EBP site mutant, the fragment containing the wild type C/EBP site (5′-GCTGCTTAAG-3′) was released as part of a larger fragment by digestion of pINV-241 with ApaI/PstI and replaced with the identical segment containing a mutated C/EBP site (5′-GCTGAGATCT-3′). The modified nucleotides are underlined. The structure of the mutated AP1-1 site in pINV-241(AP1-1m) has been previously described (20Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The junction between the hINV gene sequences and the luciferase reporter gene sequence is identical in all constructs. Keratinocytes (60% confluent) were transfected in 60-mm-diameter dishes. Lipofectin reagent (16 μg) and 4.0 μg of test plasmid were added to cells in 3 ml of KSFM and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C. After 5 h, additional KSFM (3 ml) was added, and the incubation was continued for another 19 h. After 24 h in fresh KSFM, cells were washed and treated for 24 h with KSFM or KSFM containing 50 ng/ml TPA (delivered from a 5 mg/ml stock in Me2SO) (20Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 21Banks E.B. Crish J.F. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Control groups received the Me2SO vehicle. For cotransfection experiments, involucrin reporter plasmid (2.5 μg) was transfected with various concentrations of transcription factor expression plasmid. The final expression vector concentration was maintained constant by addition of an empty expression vector. The C/EBP factors C/EBPβ (CRP2, rat) and C/EBPδ (CRP3, mouse) were expressed using pMEX (Dr. Peter Johnson of the Frederick Cancer Research Center) (25Williams S. Cantwell C. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). C/EBPα was obtained from Dr. David Samols (Case Western Reserve University) (31Hendricks Taylor L.R. Darlington G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4726-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). GADD153 and pCMV-neo were obtained from by Dr. Nikki Holbrook (27Fawcett T.W. Eastman H.B. Martindale J.L.

For luciferase assay, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, dissolved in 250 μl of cell culture lysis reagent (Promega), and harvested by scraping. Luciferase assays were performed immediately using a Promega luciferase assay kit (20Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The results are expressed as luciferase activity per μg of protein. All assays were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times. The triplicates routinely varied by less than 15%. As a control to assure comparable transfection efficiency, we utilized a green fluorescent protein plasmid and determined the percent of cells transfected by visual inspection (21Banks E.B. Crish J.F. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar,32Banks E.B. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For mobility shift assays, the reaction (20 μl) contained 15% glycerol, 75 mm KCl, 0.375 mm dithiothreitol, 0.375 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 12.5 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), 2.5 μg of nuclear extract, and 0.3 ng of radiolabeled DNA. The mixture was incubated for 5 min at room temperature, and samples were immediately electrophoresed at 250 V for 1.5 h on a 5% nondenaturing acrylamide gel using 0.25× TBE running buffer. The gels were then dried for autoradiography. For competition studies, radioinert DNA competitor was added as a 20- or 200-fold molar excess. For gel supershift assays, the complete gel mobility shift assay mixture, without the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide, was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h in the presence of an antibody specific for the C/EBP isoform using 1 μg of rabbit IgG per reaction. Dr. Steven McKnight kindly provided the C/EBPα-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies generated against amino acids 247–358 of rat C/EBPα (C/EBPα-(247–358)). An additional C/EBPα-specific antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biologicals (catalog no. sc-61X). The 32P-labeled DNA was then added to the mixture and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The resulting complexes were electrophoresed on a nondenaturing gel for characterization. C/EBPβ (sc-150)- and C/EBPδ (sc-636)-specific antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biologicals. Cultured keratinocytes, grown in KSFM, were treated for 24 h with KSFM or with KSFM containing 50 ng/ml TPA before preparation of nuclear extracts as described previously (20Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 33Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Equal quantities of nuclear protein were electrophoresed on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. C/EBPα was detected using rabbit anti-human C/EBPα at a dilution of 1:500 (catalog no. sc-61X, Santa Cruz Biologicals) followed by a goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody used at a 1:10,000 dilution. Secondary antibody binding was visualized using chemiluminescent detection reagents. A C/EBP transcription factor binding site located in the hINV promoter proximal regulatory region is required for hINV promoter activity (14Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Banks E.B. Welter J.F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 501-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that basal promoter activity (open bars) is reduced to 5–10% of control in the absence of a functional C/EBP site. In addition, TPA treatment increases promoter activity 8-fold; this TPA-dependent activation is absent when the C/EBP site is mutated (solid bars). These results demonstrate a requirement for the C/EBP site for both basal and TPA-activated promoter activity. We next tested the effects of C/EBP transcription factors on promoter activity. Fig.2 A shows that transfection of increasing concentrations of C/EBPα expression plasmid with a constant amount of hINV reporter plasmid increases hINV promoter activity in a concentration-dependent manner in the absence of TPA treatment. Expression is maximally increased by 0.4 μg of C/EBPα plasmid, and the level is not significantly increased at higher concentrations. As different C/EBP heterodimers are known to differentially regulate gene expression, we determined whether C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ can regulate the C/EBPα-dependent activation. As shown in Fig. 2 B, C/EBPβ and -δ are equally efficient inhibitors of the C/EBPα-dependent activity. In addition, as shown in Fig.3, the C/EBP proteins do not regulate promoter activity when the C/EBP-binding site is mutated. These results (i) show that C/EBP proteins can regulate hINV promoter activity in the absence of TPA treatment, (ii) provide evidence for a dynamic regulatory interaction among C/EBP proteins, and (iii) demonstrate that the proteins act through the C/EBP-binding site.Figure 3C/EBP factor regulation requires the hINV C/EBP site. Keratinocytes were transfected with 2.5 μg of pINV-241 or pINV-241(C/EBPm) in the presence of 2.5 μg of empty expression vector, pMEX (C, control), or vector expressing C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, or C/EBPδ. After transfection, the cells were harvested, and extracts were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity as outlined under “Materials and Methods.” The values are the average of four independent experiments ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To obtain additional evidence of a role for C/EBP factors in TPA-dependent activation, we treated keratinocytes with TPA in the presence of GADD153, a C/EBP family member that inhibits the activity of other C/EBP proteins by inhibiting interaction of the C/EBP-GADD153 complex with DNA (23Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar, 27Fawcett T.W. Eastman H.B. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14285-14289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This treatment creates an environment in which C/EBP activity is selectively eliminated. As shown in Fig.4 A, transfection of TPA-treated cells with increasing concentrations of GADD153 produces a concentration-dependent inhibition of TPA-dependent promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 2, C/EBPα activates the promoter in the absence of TPA treatment. We would predict that GADD153 would also inhibit the C/EBPα-dependent activation. Fig. 4 B shows that GADD153 produces a concentration-dependent inhibition of C/EBPα-dependent activation of promoter activity. In addition, GADD153 produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of basal promoter activity; 0.4 μg of GADD153 expression plasmid/transfection reduced basal activity to 5% of normal (not shown). The above described results provide functional evidence suggesting a role for C/EBP proteins as regulators of hINVgene expression. To determine whether TPA treatment alters C/EBP binding, we treated cultures with or without TPA and assayed binding by gel mobility shift assay using the double-stranded hINV C/EBP site oligonucleotide, 5′-GGTTTGCTGCTTAAGATGCCTG-3′ (C/EBP-binding site in bold). As shown in Fig. 5, gel mobility shift assay indicates that binding to 32P-labeled C/EBP-binding site is increased by >10-fold following treatment with TPA (lanes 1 and 2). The binding is specific, because addition of a 20- or 200-fold molar excess of radioinert C/EBP oligonucleotide inhibits the binding (lanes 3 and4). No inhibition of binding to 32P-labeled C/EBP oligonucleotide is observed with oligonucleotides encoding consensus AP2 or ets binding sites or a mutant C/EBP-binding site (not shown). In addition, two different C/EBPα-specific antibodies identify the complex prepared from TPA-treated cells as containing C/EBPα (lanes 5 and 6). C/EBPβ- or C/EBPδ-specific antibodies do not detect protein binding (not shown). The gel mobility shift experiment indicate that C/EBPα binding to the hINV C/EBP site is increased by TPA treatment. To determine whether this is caused by a change in C/EBPα level, we measured C/EBPα levels in nuclear extracts prepared from untreated and TPA-treated keratinocytes. As shown in Fig. 6, TPA treatment did not increase C/EBPα protein levels. Previous studies indicate that AP1 is an important mediator of TPA-dependent regulation (20Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 21Banks E.B. Crish J.F. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 22Takahashi H. Iizuka H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 10-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the AP1-binding site is located adjacent to the C/EBP-binding site (34Crish J.F. Zaim T.M. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30460-30465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we wanted to assess the role of C/EBP relative to AP1. We therefore evaluated whether both sites are required for TPA- and C/EBPα-dependent activation of hINV promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 7, mutation of either site results in a loss of TPA- and C/EBPα-dependent activation. The PRR of the hINVpromoter is the region immediately upstream of the TATA box. This region includes nucleotides −241 to −7, drives 50% of the activity of the promoter, and contains the consensus binding site for CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein AP1, the ets factors, and activator protein-2 (14Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Banks E.B. Welter J.F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 501-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Mutation of the C/EBP site results in the loss of promoter activity. In contrast, mutation of the ets factor binding sites (EBS-1, EBS-2) or the AP2-binding site changed basal promoter activity but did not effect TPA regulation. 2R. L. Eckert, unpublished observation. Our present results suggest that the C/EBP site is essential for TPA-dependent promoter activity. These results suggest a dual role for C/EBP in maintaining basal promoter activity and in mediating activation in response to TPA. C/EBP proteins comprise a family of bZIP domain proteins that readily form homo- and heterodimers (24Yeh W.-C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 25Williams S. Cantwell C. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). These proteins are important regulators of cell differentiation. For example, C/EBPα is a transcriptional activator in adipocytes (35MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). High levels of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ accumulate early in adipocyte differentiation but are replaced by C/EBPα during late differentiation. C/EBPβ and -δ appear to play an important role in accelerating differentiation (24Yeh W.-C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), and ectopic expression of C/EBPβ in multipotent NIH-3T3 cells causes them to convert to committed adipoblasts. The accumulation of C/EBPα late in differentiation is correlated with expression of markers of adipose differentiation (24Yeh W.-C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 36Lane M.D. Lin F.T. MacDougald O.A. Vasseur Cognet M. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1996; 20 Suppl. 3: S91-S96PubMed Google Scholar). C/EBP proteins also differentially regulate gene expression in the liver (37Chowdhury S. Gotoh T. Mori M. Takiguchi M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 500-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 38Nolten L.A. van Schaik F.M. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1636-1645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C/EBP proteins are also expressed in keratinocytes (39Wang H. Liu K. Yuan F. Berdichevsky L. Taichman L.B. Auborn K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4839-4844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Swart G.W. van Groningen J.J. van Ruissen F. Bergers M. Schalkwijk J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ is a negative regulator of human papillomavirus transcription in keratinocytes (39Wang H. Liu K. Yuan F. Berdichevsky L. Taichman L.B. Auborn K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4839-4844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and human C/EBPα is highly expressed in the epidermis (40Swart G.W. van Groningen J.J. van Ruissen F. Bergers M. Schalkwijk J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Little is known regarding their role as regulators of expression of keratinocyte genes; however, C/EBPα is expressed in suprabasal epidermis and in differentiated keratinocytes (40Swart G.W. van Groningen J.J. van Ruissen F. Bergers M. Schalkwijk J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A recent report indicates that C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and GADD153 are differentially expressed during keratinocyte differentiation (41Maytin E.V. Habener J.F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 238-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). C/EBPδ expression in the epidermis has not been studied. A recent abstract suggests that C/EBPβ directs expression of cytokeratin 10, a keratin that is expressed in the suprabasal epidermal layers (42Maytin E.V. Lin J.C. Habener J.F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Our present experiments show that C/EBP proteins alter pINV-241 promoter activity in a C/EBP site-dependent manner. C/EBPα increases basal transcription as efficiently as TPA treatment. In contrast, C/EBPβ and -δ can suppress C/EBPα-dependent activation. This is consistent with the ability of these proteins to form zippered heterodimers and with the fact that different C/EBP complexes differentially regulate gene expression (23Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar, 24Yeh W.-C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 25Williams S. Cantwell C. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 26Scott L.

Chem. 1992; 267: 20465-20470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result shows that differential expression of C/EBP factors during keratinocyte differentiation could, in principle, differentially regulate involucrin gene expression. Our studies indicate that the TPA-dependent activation of hINV promoter activity is correlated with increased binding of C/EBPα to the hINV promoter C/EBP site but that concentration of C/EBPα protein is not altered by TPA treatment. Recent in vitro studies show that C/EBP is a good substrate for protein kinase C but indicate that protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation reduces C/EBPα binding to DNA (43Mahoney C.W. Shuman J. McKnight S.L. Chen H.C. Huang K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19396-19403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This reduction in DNA binding is thought to result from phosphorylation of serine residues within the DNA-binding region. However, as discussed by the authors (43Mahoney C.W. Shuman J. McKnight S.L. Chen H.C. Huang K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19396-19403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this scenario has not been confirmed in cells. It is possible that additional factors are phosphorylated by protein kinase C that assist C/EBPα to bind DNA or that, in vivo, serine phosphorylation actually enhances DNA binding. Moreover, there may be cell type-specific effects. Additional detailed studies will be necessary to determine how protein kinase C alters C/EBPα phosphorylation in keratinocytes. However, it is clear that the increased C/EBPα DNA binding is not the result of changes in C/EBPα concentration. GADD153 is a unique member of the C/EBP transcription factor family that forms transcriptionally inactive complexes with other C/EBP proteins. GADD153 forms heterodimeric complexes with other C/EBP proteins that are unable to bind to DNA and thus do not regulate transcription (27Fawcett T.W. Eastman H.B. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14285-14289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 28Bartlett J.D. Luethy J.D. Carlson S.G. Sollott S.J. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20465-20470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, GADD153 can be used selectively to create C/EBP-null conditions (i.e. to selectively knock out C/EBP function). We show that GADD153 inhibits basal transcription. The fact that GADD153 suppresses basal promoter activity suggests that endogenous C/EBP proteins are involved in maintaining basal promoter function. When C/EBP levels are artificially elevated by transfection of C/EBPα, GADD153 also inhibits this response, verifying the C/EBP protein requirement for promoter activity. We also show that the TPA-dependent activation of hINV promoter activity is suppressed by GADD153, suggesting that TPA-dependent activation involves signal transduction events that include C/EBP factors. This suggestion is supported by the finding that TPA treatment increases complex formation at the hINV C/EBP-binding site and that C/EBPα is a part of this complex. C/EBPα is the primary C/EBP factor that interacts with the hINV C/EBP site in cells maintained under basal conditions; no binding of C/EBPβ or -δ was detected. A possible mechanism to explain the increased promoter activity in response to TPA is that TPA increases C/EBPα binding to the promoter. Consistent with this possibility, gel mobility supershift experiments suggest that C/EBPα is an abundant component of the C/EBP site binding activity present in TPA-treated cells. Involucrin gene expression and promoter activity are regulated by a variety of transcription factors. TPA is a potent inducer of keratinocyte differentiation and an efficient activator of hINVgene expression and promoter activity (20Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). TPA-dependent activation of promoter activity has been shown to require the presence of functional AP1 sites (20Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 21Banks E.B. Crish J.F. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 22Takahashi H. Iizuka H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 10-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates the role of C/EBP factors. These results are interesting for several reasons. First, the C/EBP and AP1 sites in the hINV promoter PRR are separated by only 10 nucleotides (34Crish J.F. Zaim T.M. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30460-30465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This close proximity should permit AP1-C/EBP factor interaction. Second, both the AP1 and C/EBP-binding sites must be intact for either TPA- or C/EBPα-dependent promoter activation. This requirement suggests that C/EBP and AP1 factors interact to produce the response and that members of both families are required for activation. Understanding the mechanism of this regulation will require further study. Third, promoter activity requires the presence of both AP1 and C/EBP proteins (i.e. dominant inhibitory proteins of either class inactivate the promoter) (44Efimova T. LaCelle P.T. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Fourth, both C/EBP and AP1 factor binding activity is increased by TPA treatment (20Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Taken together these features suggest that a multiprotein complex, including C/EBP and AP1, may be required for hINV gene expression. Our results suggest that this complex includes C/EBPα."

Recovery from the light response requires the termination of all activating steps in the cascade and the resynthesis of cGMP. Synthesis of cGMP is catalyzed by a membrane-bound retina-specific guanylyl cyclase in rod outer segments (ROS-GC). 1The abbreviations used are: ROS-GC, membrane-bound retina-specific guanylyl cyclase in rod outer segments; GCAP, guanylyl cyclase-activating protein; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; ROS, rod outer segment(s); DTT, dithiothreitol.1The abbreviations used are: ROS-GC, membrane-bound retina-specific guanylyl cyclase in rod outer segments; GCAP, guanylyl cyclase-activating protein; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; ROS, rod outer segment(s); DTT, dithiothreitol.

Their mechanism of activation is different from other family members: Ca2+-binding proteins act on an intracellular domain of ROS-GC (14Podzdnyakov N. Goraczniak R. Margulis A. Duda T. Sharma R.K.

The activity of the ROS-GC forms is regulated by a photoreceptor-specific Ca2+-binding protein named guanylyl cyclase-activating protein (GCAP) that is also expressed in two isoforms (GCAP-1 and GCAP-2) (18Palczewski K.

In the dark, when the [Ca2+ ] is high (500 nm), ROS-GC activity is low, and it is stimulated at least 10-fold during the light response, when the [Ca2+] drops to ≤100 nm. Both GCAP forms are heterogeneously acylated at the N terminus by C14:0, C14:1, C14:2, and C12:0 fatty acids. Although the N-terminal fatty acyl group may be important for regulation of ROS-GC, it is probably not essential for membrane binding (18Palczewski K. Subbaraya I. Gorczyca W.A. Helekar B.S.

Several experiments have indicated that GCAP-1 is associated with rod outer segment membranes or ROS-GC independent of [Ca2+] (16Duda T. Goraczniak R. Surgucheva I. Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Gorczyca W.A.

Ca2+-loaded GCAP-1 competes with a constitutively active GCAP-1 mutant for binding to ROS-GC (25Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Surgucheva I. Hulmes J.D. Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Crabb J.W. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), which also led to the conclusion that GCAP-1 forms a stable complex with ROS-GC independent of [Ca2+]. In contrast, GCAP-2 does show a Ca2+ sensitivity of its membrane association; it binds more efficiently to membranes at [Ca2+] < 200 nm(23Olshevskaya E.V. Hughes R.E. Hurley J.B. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14327-14333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Knowledge about the precise interaction domains in GCAP-1 and GCAP-2 is incomplete or nonexistent. So far, peptide competition studies have indicated that the N-terminal 20 amino acids of GCAP-1 are involved in regulation of ROS-GC (18Palczewski K. Subbaraya I. Gorczyca W.A. Helekar B.S. Ruiz C.C. Ohguro H. Huang J. Zhao X. Crabb J.W. Johnson R.S. Walsh K.A. Gray-Keller M.P. Detwiler P.B. Baehr W.

In addition, two peptides (Glu57–Lys86 and Asp37–Asp163 in GCAP-1) including the first and third functional Ca2+-binding motifs (EF-hands) inhibited stimulation of ROS-GC (24Otto-Bruc A. Buczylko J. Surgucheva I. Subbaraya I. Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Crabb J.W. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4295-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A 25-amino acid truncation at the N terminus of GCAP-1 abolished the ability to increase ROS-GC activity almost completely (24Otto-Bruc A. Buczylko J. Surgucheva I. Subbaraya I. Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Crabb J.W. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4295-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It was the aim of our project to identify the domain(s) in GCAP-1 that is directly involved in the interaction with ROS-GC. We synthesized an oligopeptide library of overlapping peptides spanning the entire amino acid sequence of GCAP-1. Peptides were used in competitive screening assays and column affinity binding studies. By this approach, we found that ROS-GC and tubulin bind as a complex to a 15-amino acid peptide of GCAP-1. Coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrated the presence of an interacting complex of ROS-GC, GCAP-1, and tubulin independent of [Ca2+]. Peptides spanning the whole amino acid sequence of GCAP-1 were synthesized using a Multipin peptide synthesis kit (Chiron Mimotopes) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Each peptide was 12 amino acids long and overlapped with the preceding one by 10 amino acids. All peptides were obtained in their amide form at the carboxyl terminus. Fmoc-protected amino acids were attached via carbodiimide chemistry. After 12 cycles of coupling, the N terminus of each peptide was acetylated by incubating with 3% acetanhydride and 0.5%N-ethyldiisopropylamine in dimethylformamide for 100 min. For synthesis of the myristoylated form of peptide 1, the acetylation was omitted. Instead, myristic acid was coupled to the peptide's free N terminus using the same chemistry as for coupling Fmoc-protected amino acids. Deprotection, cleavage, precipitation, and washing of peptides were done as recommended by the manufacturer. Lyophilized peptides were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Peptide 37/38 and the GCAP-2 and the recoverin peptides were synthesized in larger amounts as described (26Zoche M. Bienert M. Beyermann M. Koch K.-W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8742-8747Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Peptides were coupled to activated thiol-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) via a thiol group according to the manufacturer's description. The peptide-Sepharose was equilibrated with 1 mm dodecyl maltoside, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4) and incubated with an extract of membrane and/or cytoskeletal proteins from rod outer segments (ROS). ROS and the extract were obtained as described (5Koch K.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8634-8637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Frins S. Bönigk W. Müller F. Kellner R. Koch K.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8022-8027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, ROS (9–13 mg/ml rhodopsin) were diluted 30-fold with a low salt buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm DTT) and centrifuged at 30,000 ×g for 30 min. Washed ROS membranes were homogenized and solubilized in 5% Triton X-100, 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), and 1 mm DTT. Subsequent centrifugation removed the majority of membrane proteins, including rhodopsin and the cGMP-gated channel (present in the Triton X-100 supernatant). The pellet was solubilized with 20 mm dodecyl maltoside, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 m KCl, and 1 mm DTT and centrifuged. This extract (dodecyl maltoside extract) was enriched in ROS-GC and contained tubulin, actin, and a few other unidentified proteins in minor quantities. Before application to the column, the extract was adjusted to 1 mm dodecyl maltoside, 50 mm KCl, and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). The extract was incubated with the Sepharose at 4 °C for at least 2 h. The unbound fraction was collected, and the Sepharose was washed with 1 mm dodecyl maltoside, 20 mmHepes-KOH (pH 7.4), and 0.5 m NaCl (10-fold the volume of the column) and subsequently with the same buffer containing 1m NaCl. Salt was removed by washing with 20 mmHepes (pH 7.4). Bound proteins were eluted with 0.5% SDS and 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4). The Triton X-100 extract (5Koch K.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8634-8637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was also used to test binding of tubulin to peptide columns in the absence of ROS-GC. The activity of ROS-GC was determined as described previously (5Koch K.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8634-8637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Frins S. Bönigk W. Müller F. Kellner R. Koch K.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8022-8027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In all experiments, the incubation volume was 50 μl. Added peptides were dissolved in 0.5% Me2SO and 0.05% Tween 20, which caused little interference with the guanylyl cyclase activity. Controls were incubated under identical buffer conditions. Free Ca2+ was adjusted by Ca2+/EGTA buffers as described (20Frins S. Bönigk W. Müller F. Kellner R. Koch K.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8022-8027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The coding sequence of bovine GCAP-1 was amplified from a full-length cDNA clone (20Frins S. Bönigk W. Müller F. Kellner R. Koch K.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8022-8027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) via polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: 5′-sense primer, CAGGGATCCACCATGGGGAACATTATGGAC; and 3′-antisense primer, AGGGAATTCTATCAGCCGTCGGCCTCCGCG. The product obtained after 15 cycles of polymerase chain reaction was subcloned into pBluescript SK vector via the introduced BamHI andEcoRI sites. One of the resulting clones was sequenced to exclude that errors had been introduced by the polymerase chain reaction. The GCAP-1/pBluescript plasmid was linearized by digestion withNcoI, and the ends were filled in with Klenow polymerase. The GCAP-1 coding sequence was then released by digestion withEcoRI and inserted between the NdeI andEcoRI restriction sites of the pET21a(+) expression vector (Novagene). GCAP-1 protein was expressed from GCAP-1/pET21a(+) in anEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain carrying the plasmid pBB131 (a kind gift of Dr. J. Gordon) encoding for yeastN-myristoyltransferase. Cells were grown at 37 °C to anA 600 of ∼0.5 in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml kanamycin and then supplemented with 50 μg/ml myristic acid. Thirty minutes after addition of myristic acid, the expression of GCAP-1 was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Expression was allowed to proceed for 4 h. Cells from 1 liter of expression culture were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 250 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), and stored frozen at −20 °C until further use. The thawed cell suspension was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence of 0.1% Tween 20, 100 μg/ml lysozyme (SERVA), and 10 units/ml DNase I (TaKaRa). Lysis was terminated by addition of 1 mm DTT and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The insoluble fraction was collected by centrifugation at 370,000 ×g for 20 min and solubilized by stirring in 250 ml of buffer containing 6 m guanidin chloride, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2.5 mm DTT for 1 h at room temperature. The resulting suspension was filtered and dialyzed at 4 °C against three changes of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7) containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mmDTT, followed by two changes of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 200 μm CaCl2 and 1 mm DTT. Precipitated material was removed by centrifugation at 370,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was concentrated using Centriplus devices (Amicon, Inc.) with a molecular mass cutoff of 10 kDa. The concentrate was applied to a Superdex 75 XK16/60 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7), 100 mm NaCl, and 200 μm CaCl2. Fractions containing recombinant GCAP-1 were pooled and bound to ceramic hydroxylapatite type I (Bio-Rad) in an HR5/5 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Elution was performed by a 0–100% gradient of 300 mmsodium phosphate (pH 7) in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7) and 200 μm CaCl2. Recombinant GCAP-1 was obtained in >90% purity and stored at −80 °C. Protein A-Sepharose was equilibrated with 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0). Polyclonal anti-GCAP-1 serum from immunized rabbit (20Frins S. Bönigk W. Müller F. Kellner R. Koch K.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8022-8027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was adjusted to 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and incubated with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at room temperature. Afterward, the Sepharose was washed with 40 ml of 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and with 40 ml of 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and equilibrated with 0.2 m sodium borate buffer (pH 9.0). The Sepharose beads were resuspended in 40 ml of sodium borate, and 1.1 g of dimethyl pimelimidate was added to the suspension. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped with 0.2 m ethanolamine. Coimmunoprecipitation of GCAP-1 and ROS-GC was done as follows. Soluble ROS proteins were separated from the membranes by centrifugation of a 5-fold diluted suspension of ROS in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) (45,000 rpm for 15 min; Beckman TLA-45). The supernatant was concentrated with a Centricon device (cutoff = 10 kDa), adjusted to 150 mm KCl, and incubated with the anti-GCAP antibody-Sepharose equilibrated in the same buffer (200 μl of supernatant and 100 μl of Sepharose). The unbound fraction was separated from the beads by a quick spin using 0.45 micropure separators (Amicon, Inc.). Pelleted ROS membranes (see above) were resuspended in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5); solubilized in 500 μl of buffer containing 2% Triton X-100, 0.5 m KCl, and 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4); and centrifuged for 15 min at 45,000 rpm. The supernatant was incubated with the anti-GCAP antibody-Sepharose beads. Samples were run in parallel with either 1 mmCaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA present, including all subsequent washing steps. Samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, for 30 min at 4 °C, and for 10 min at room temperature and then spun. The filtrates were collected (unbound fractions), and the beads were washed with 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.15 m KCl, and 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5). These washing cycles were done five times and were followed by a washing step with 10 mmTris (pH 7.5). Bound proteins were eluted first with 100 mmglycine (pH 2.5) and second with 2% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed as described (20Frins S. Bönigk W. Müller F. Kellner R. Koch K.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8022-8027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The polyclonal anti-ROS-GC antibody (27Koch K.-W. Stecher P. Kellner R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was diluted 1:5000; the polyclonal anti-GCAP-1 antibody (20Frins S. Bönigk W. Müller F. Kellner R. Koch K.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8022-8027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was diluted 1:10,000; and the monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma) was diluted 1:50,000. The secondary horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibodies were diluted 1:5000. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Ninety-six peptides encompassing the entire amino acid sequence of GCAP-1 were tested at a concentration of 0.1 mm for their efficiency to inhibit the ROS-GC activity in the presence of GCAP and 10−9m Ca2+. Most peptides caused a weak inhibition from 0 to 10% (Fig.1). A few peptides even showed a small stimulatory effect (see, for example, peptides 8–10). The most effective peptides were peptides 37 and 38 (74MEYVAALSLVLKGK87); they caused 30–40% inhibition (Fig. 1). Peptides of intermediate efficiency (20–30%) were peptides 1 (amino acids 2–15), 15 and 18 (amino acids 30–47), and 44 and 45 (amino acids 88–102). Peptides that displayed inhibition ≥20% were further examined at increasing concentrations (0.1–0.3 mm). The results for peptides 1, 38, and 44 are shown in Fig. 2 A (peptide 36 was chosen as a control). The normalized ROS-GC activity was lowered to 30% with 0.3 mm peptide 38. Less strong, but still significant were the inhibitory effects of peptides 1 and 44 (60–70% normalized ROS-GC activity) and peptide 37 (60–70% normalized ROS-GC activity) (data not shown). Peptides 15, 18, and 45 were of similar efficiency as peptide 44 (data not shown). A small effect was seen with peptide 36 (Fig. 2 A). Because native GCAP-1 contains a myristoyl group at the N terminus, we synthesized a myristoylated and a nonmyristoylated form of the N-terminal peptide. The nonmyristoylated peptide did not change the ROS-GC activity (data not shown), whereas the myristoylated peptide displayed the modest inhibitory effect shown in Fig. 1 (peptide 1). Basal ROS-GC activity in washed ROS membranes depleted of GCAP was not influenced by most peptides, with the exception of peptides 45–47, which showed a weak inhibition of 20% (data not shown). In conclusion, peptides 37 and 38 were the most effective in interfering with ROS-GC activity. In further studies, we used a peptide that encompassed the sequences of both peptides 37 and 38 (peptide 37/38) (Fig.3 A).Figure 2A, normalized ROS-GC activity at different peptide concentrations. Activity was measured at 1 nm Ca2+ in whole ROS. ROS-GC activity without peptide was set to 1.

The IC50 value of 0.14 mm, however, was larger than the one observed for peptide 37/38 (0.07 mm). We conclude that the three additional amino acids (Phe73–Glu75) in peptide 37/38 determine the affinity of ROS-GC for GCAP-1. It is interesting that flanking regions of this domain (represented by peptides 36 (Fig.2 A) and 39 (data not shown)) showed only a marginal effect. A peptide from recoverin related to peptide 37/38 caused only 15% inhibition of ROS-GC at low [Ca2+], whereas the related peptide from GCAP-2 showed 50% inhibition (GCAP-1 peptide 37/38 caused 75% inhibition (Fig. 3, B andC); all peptides at 0.1 mm). These results indicated that the GCAP-1 peptide (and the almost identical GCAP-2 peptide) acts specifically on ROS-GC and that the amino acid differences between recoverin and GCAP peptides are critical for the interaction with ROS-GC. Recombinant GCAP-1 was added to a suspension of ROS in which ROS-GC was inhibited by either peptide 37/38 or 38. GCAP-1 at 12 μm could completely relieve the inhibition by both peptides. Addition of GCAP-1 to a ROS suspension without peptides did not change the maximal rate of ROS-GC activity (Fig. 4). This experiment clearly showed that the observed inhibition is caused by a direct interference of the peptides with the GCAP-1/ROS-GC interaction, which can be overcome by an additional amount of GCAP-1. We next examined whether inhibitory peptides could change the [Ca2+] at which the activation of ROS-GC was half-maximal. The inhibitory effect of peptides 37/38 and 38 (0.1 mm peptide) was studied within the physiologically important range of [Ca2+] (Fig.5). Peptide 37/38 was more efficient than peptide 38, consistent with the results in Fig. 2 B. Peptides at 0.1 mm did not significantly change the Ca2+regulation of ROS-GC activity (Fig. 5, inset). The activation of ROS-GC was half-maximal at 60 nmCa2+ and cooperative (n H = 1.6) independent of peptide addition. The EC50 of 60 nm is at the lower range of reported values in the literature (50–280 nm) (12Pugh Jr., E.N. Duda T. Sitaramayya A. Sharma R.K. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 429-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). ROS-GC activity at high [Ca2+] was not influenced by these peptides. Basal ROS-GC activity in ROS membranes depleted of GCAP was also not influenced at high or low [Ca2+]. Therefore, peptides 37/38 and 38 interfere with the GCAP-1/ROS-GC interaction and not with basal ROS-GC activity. We tested direct binding of ROS-GC to the most effective GCAP peptide (peptide 37/38). Peptide 37/38 was covalently coupled to an activated thiol-Sepharose matrix via an additional N-terminal cysteine and a glycine spacer (37/38-Sepharose). The 37/38-Sepharose was incubated with an extract containing ROS-GC and other ROS membrane and cytoskeletal proteins. Two controls were used, Sepharose columns to which either cysteine (Cys-Sepharose) or peptide 53 (53-Sepharose) was coupled. GCAP-1 peptide 53 (102CIDRDELLTIIR113) was chosen as a control because it did not show a significant effect in our screening assay (Fig. 1) and could be coupled to the column matrix via its terminal cysteine. No protein was retained by these columns (Fig. 6 A, bound,C and 53 lanes), and the unbound fractions of the Cys-Sepharose and 53-Sepharose were identical in their protein composition when compared with the starting material (C and53 lanes). Occasionally, some proteins bound nonspecifically to these columns (data not shown). Two major polypeptides of 112 and 55 kDa, respectively, were bound to the 37/38-Sepharose. They were completely removed from the ROS extract (Fig. 6 A,nonbound, 37/38 lane) and could be eluted from the Sepharose by 0.5% SDS (bound, 37/38 lane). Western blotting of the unbound and bound fractions revealed that the band at 112 kDa is ROS-GC (Fig. 6 B), whereas the protein at 55 kDa was identified as tubulin (Fig. 6 D, DE, B lane). A few other proteins appeared in both the bound and unbound fractions of the 37/38-Sepharose. Therefore, binding of these proteins to the 37/38-Sepharose was not specific, whereas it was for ROS-GC and tubulin. Tubulin in a control extract without ROS-GC (Fig.6 C, TE) did not bind to the 37/38-Sepharose (Fig.6 D, TE, NB lane). Sometimes tubulin was lost, probably due to aggregation when ROS-GC was not present. The results of the peptide affinity chromatography suggested that ROS-GC and tubulin bind as a complex to GCAP-1. We tested this by coimmunoprecipitation using a polyclonal GCAP-1 antibody (20Frins S. Bönigk W. Müller F. Kellner R. Koch K.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8022-8027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This antibody, covalently coupled to protein A-Sepharose, specifically immunoprecipitated GCAP-1. GCAP-1 was partially eluted from the beads by glycine; the remaining GCAP-1 was eluted by SDS (data not shown). Both ROS-GC and tubulin coimmunoprecipitated with GCAP-1 (Fig.7, A and B,SDS elution). Tubulin could be partially eluted by glycine, whereas ROS-GC needed an SDS buffer for elution. The presence of either 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA did not change the binding of the ROS-GC·tubulin complex to GCAP-1. Thus, the interaction of the ROS-GC·tubulin complex with GCAP-1 seemed to be independent of Ca2+. A small amount of ROS-GC and tubulin was not immunoprecipitated (Fig. 7, A and B,nonbound); however, GCAP-1, ROS-GC, and tubulin were not bound to protein A-Sepharose without immobilized GCAP-1 antibody (c lanes). These results confirmed that ROS-GC and tubulin form a complex with GCAP-1. We have identified a 15-amino acid region located C-terminally from the second EF-hand (Phe73–Lys87) in GCAP-1 as the main interaction domain (Fig. 3) for ROS-GC. The peptide interfered with the GCAP-1-dependent activation of ROS-GC at low [Ca2+], which indicates that it critically disturbs the Ca2+-dependent activation of ROS-GC by GCAP-1. We cannot exclude that the peptides also compete with the action of GCAP-2. However, based on other reports (21Gorczyca W.A. Polans A.S. Surgucheva I.G. Subbaraya I. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8022-8027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), GCAP-1 is the major component of bovine ROS homogenates. We compared the region with regions adjacent to the second EF-hand in GCAP-2, recoverin, and calmodulin, three other Ca2+-binding proteins involved in regulation of phototransduction (21Gorczyca W.A.

Nature. 1993; 361: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). GCAP-1 and GCAP-2 are almost identical in this region and, not surprisingly, showed the same inhibition of ROS-GC activity (Fig. 3, B and C). The related peptide from recoverin was much less effective. Sequence identity between GCAP-1 and recoverin is only found at 8 out of 15 positions. Significant differences in recoverin compared with GCAP-1 are Lys84 (corresponding to Met74 in GCAP-1) and the stretch of five amino acids at His91–Ala95(Ser81–Lys85 in GCAP-1), which is more hydrophobic in GCAP-1. We conclude that the differences in amino acid sequences in the compared regions are essential for different target recognition of recoverin and GCAP-1. Other regions that were less effective in the competition studies might also participate in controlling ROS-GC activity. For example, a myristoylated N-terminal peptide significantly decreased ROS-GC activity, whereas a nonmyristoylated form failed to show an effect. This result is in agreement with two previous studies. One study showed that a myristoylated peptide from the N terminus decreased GCAP-1-stimulated ROS-GC activity (18Palczewski K. Subbaraya I. Gorczyca W.A. Helekar B.S. Ruiz C.C. Ohguro H. Huang J. Zhao X. Crabb J.W. Johnson R.S. Walsh K.A. Gray-Keller M.P. Detwiler P.B. Baehr W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar); in the other study, it was reported that an N-terminally truncated mutant of GCAP-1 was unable to stimulate ROS-GC (24Otto-Bruc A. Buczylko J. Surgucheva I. Subbaraya I. Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Crabb J.W. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4295-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The myristoylated N terminus of GCAP-1 might be involved in locating GCAP-1 close to the membrane in the right orientation to interact with ROS-GC. Otto-Bruc et al. (24Otto-Bruc A. Buczylko J. Surgucheva I. Subbaraya I. Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Crabb J.W. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4295-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) identified three larger regions in GCAP-1 as putative interaction domains. These regions correspond to peptides 1–7, 27–38, and 68–75. Although our screening assay narrowed down two of their regions to a stretch of 15 amino acids (peptides 1 and 37/38), we did not observe any significant inhibitory effect with peptides from the C-terminal part (peptide 68–75 in Fig. 1). Incubation with a peptide mixture that covered this entire region also showed no significant inhibitory effect (data not shown). One explanation for these two different results is that the interaction domain represented by this C-terminal region needs a correct folding, which might be present in the larger peptide of Otto-Bruc et al. (24Otto-Bruc A. Buczylko J. Surgucheva I. Subbaraya I. Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Crabb J.W. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4295-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated direct binding of ROS-GC to peptide 37/38 by affinity chromatography. ROS-GC bound to this peptide in a complex with tubulin. The same complex formation was observed when ROS-GC was coimmunoprecipitated with GCAP-1. These two independent experiments strongly suggest that there exists a tight association of ROS-GC with the cytoskeletal protein tubulin. Association of ROS-GC with the outer segment cytoskeleton has been noted by different investigators based on fractionation, solubilization, and overlay studies (5Koch K.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8634-8637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Fleischman D. Denisevich M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5060-5066Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 33Hallett M.A. Delaat J.L. Arikawa K. Schlamp C.L. Kong F. Williams D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1803-1812PubMed Google Scholar). So far, only actin has been identified as one of the interacting components (33Hallett M.A. Delaat J.L. Arikawa K. Schlamp C.L. Kong F. Williams D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1803-1812PubMed Google Scholar). Our finding that tubulin and ROS-GC form a complex with GCAP-1 indicates that Ca2+/cGMP signaling in photoreceptor cells occurs in close proximity to cytoskeletal elements, but it is unclear whether cytoskeletal proteins are directly involved in enzyme regulation. The immunoprecipitation studies also indicate that GCAP-1 and ROS-GC form a stable complex independent of the free [Ca2+]. This is consistent with previous cross-linking experiments in which GCAP-1 was found to be in close proximity to ROS-GC at high and low [Ca2+] (16Duda T. Goraczniak R. Surgucheva I. Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Gorczyca W.A. Palczewski K. Sitaramayya A. Baehr W. Sharma R.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8478-8482Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Competition experiments of Ca2+-loaded GCAP-1 with a constitutively active GCAP-1 mutant also showed that Ca2+-bound GCAP binds to ROS-GC (25Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Surgucheva I. Hulmes J.D. Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Crabb J.W. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). All these findings support a model in which a change in cytosolic [Ca2+] would be detected by GCAP-1 while it is bound to ROS-GC. Activation occurs by a conformational switch in GCAP-1 that is transmitted to the cyclase. Such a regulatory mechanism would be different from classical calmodulin-regulated systems, in which calmodulin controls the activity of its targets by Ca2+-dependent binding and dissociation (31Klee C.B. Crouch T.H. Richman P.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 489-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar), but the mechanism would resemble the regulation of calmodulin targets containing IQ motifs (34Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). We thank D. Höppner-Heitmann for excellent technical assistance and Dr. U. B. Kaupp for helpful comments on the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2163727669,"Recent studies from many laboratories revealed remarkable structural, distributional, and functional diversities of oligo/polysialic acids (OSA/PSA) that exist in organisms ranging from bacteria to man. These diversities are further complicated by the fact that OSA/PSA spontaneously form lactones under even mildly acidic conditions. By using high performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) with nitrate eluents, we found that lactonization of α2,8-linked OSA/PSA (oligo/poly-Neu5Ac, oligo/poly-Neu5Gc and oligo/poly-KDN) proceeds readily, and the lactonization process displays three discrete stages. The initial stage is characterized by limited lactonization occurring between two internal sialic acid residues, reflected by a regular pattern of lactone peaks interdigitated with non-lactonized peaks on HPAEC. In the middle stage, multiple lactonized species are formed from a molecule with a given degree of polymerization (DP), in which the maximum number of lactone rings formed equals DP minus 2. At the final stage, completely lactonized species become the major components, resulting in drastic changes in the physicochemical properties of the sample. Interestingly, the smallest lactonizable OSA are tetramer, trimer, and dimer at the initial, middle, and final stages, respectively. At any of the stages, OSA/PSA of higher DP lactonize more rapidly, but all the lactone rings rapidly open up when exposed to mild alkali. Lactonized OSA/PSA are resistant to both enzyme- and acid-catalyzed glycosidic bond cleavage. The latter fact was utilized to obtain more high DP oligo/poly(α2,8-Neu5Gc) chains from a polysialoglycoprotein. Our results should be useful in preparation, storage, and analysis of OSA/PSA.

Recent studies on oligo/polysialic acids 1In this paper, we refer to those with DP equal to or higher than 10 as polymers since they can be differentiated from the homologues of DP <10 by antibodies, as reported elsewhere, and can be easily prepared by precipitating polylactone from water as shown in this paper.(OSA/PSA) 2The abbreviations used are: OSA, oligosialic acids; PSA, polysialic acids; HPAEC, high performance anion-exchange chromatography; PAD, pulsed amperometric detection/detector; DP, degree of polymerization; Neu5Ac, 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid; Neu5Gc, 5-N-glycolylneuraminic acid; KDN, 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero- d-galactonononic acid; PSGP, polysialoglycoprotein; 5L1, 5L2, 5L3, etc., lactones of pentameric Neu5Ac with one, two, and three lactone rings per molecule, respectively; GD3, II3(NeuAc)2-LacCer; GD1b, II3(NeuAc)2-GgOse4Cer. have revealed remarkable structural (1Sato C.

Structural diversities of OSA/PSA are further complicated by their ease of lactonization. The existence of lactones in OSA/PSA was suggested first many years ago (10McGuire E.J. Binkley S.B. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It was suspected that lactonization could significantly alter the physicochemical and biological properties of OSA/PSA such as charge density, conformation, and antigenicity (11Lifely M.R. Gilbert A.S. Moreno C. Carbohydr. Res. 1981; 94: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Lifely M.R. Gilbert A.S. Moreno C. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 134: 229-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Both α2,8- and α2,9-linked oligo/poly-Neu5Ac lactonized rapidly under acidic conditions (11Lifely M.R. Gilbert A.S. Moreno C. Carbohydr. Res. 1981; 94: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Lifely M.R. Gilbert A.S. Moreno C. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 134: 229-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Similar phenomenon was observed in gangliosides containing α2,8-linked Neu5Ac dimer (13Bassi R. Riboni L. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G. Carbohydr. Res. 1989; 193: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Tsuda M. Terabayashi T. Kawanishi Y. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 70: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that passing a solution of sodium salt of colominic acid (a mixture of oligo/poly(α2,8-Neu5Ac) homologues) through a Dowex 50 (H+-form) column or simply dialyzing it against water can induce lactonization (15Zhang Y. Lee Y.C. Glycobiology. 1997; 7 (abstr.): 1027Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Failure to completely de-lactonize OSA/PSA mixtures after partial hydrolysis under acidic conditions severely limited their separation by capillary electrophoresis (16Cheng M.-C. Lin S.-L. Wu S.-H. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 260: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Similarly, during the separation of OSA from hydrolysate of colominic acid on an anion-exchange column, we observed that each OSA peak of an expected degree of polymerization (DP) contained a small amount of OSA with a higher than expected DP (e.g. the OSA of DP5 in the expected DP4 peak). Co-existence of OSA of two different DP was also detected in samples obtained elsewhere. Apparently, loss of negative charges upon lactonization of OSA caused them to elute at the positions of lower DP. The natural occurrence of sialic acid lactones in glycolipids also underscores the significance of lactonization in vivo(17Gross S.K. Williams M.A. McCluer R.H. J. Neurochem. 1980; 34: 1351-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Riboni L. Sonnino S. Acquotti D. Malesci A. Ghidoni R. Egge H. Mingrino S. Tettamanti G. J. Biol.

However, it is not clear whether lactonization in vivo occurs spontaneously by merely acid-catalyzed chemical reactions or is actively controlled by enzymatic processes, although lactonization could be indirectly regulated byO-substitutions and de-O-substitutions on sialic acids, which are suggested to be tightly controlled in living systems (21Varki A. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 22Shi W.-X. Chammas R. Varki A. J. Biol.

Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, systematic investigation on acid-catalyzed lactonization of OSA/PSA will not only provide useful information for proper sample handling in vitro but also shed light on our understanding of related processes in vivo. It has been suggested by NMR and substitution studies (11Lifely M.R. Gilbert A.S. Moreno C. Carbohydr. Res. 1981; 94: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) that lactonization of oligo/poly(α2,8-Neu5Ac) occurs between two adjacent sialic acid residues, the carboxyl group of one residue esterifying the 9-hydroxyl group of the residue at the reducing side to form a 6-membered ring (Fig. 1). The same lactone ring was also observed between the two α2,8-linked sialic acid residues in GD3 and GD1b ganglioside lactones (24Ando S. Yu R.K. Scarsdale J.N. Kusunoki S. Prestegard J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3478-3483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Acquotti D. Fronza G. Ragg E. Sonnino S. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1991; 59: 107-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). If this is the only type of lactone ring, there will be three possible lactone species from a trimer, i.e.(Neu5Acα2,8)3-(1′:9)-lactone (A), (Neu5Acα2,8)3-(1“:9′)-lactone (B), and (Neu5Acα2, 8)3-(1′:9, 1”:9′)-di-lactone (AB) (see Fig. 1). It is obvious that the possible patterns of lactonization will become progressively complicated as DP increases. The lack of detailed understanding of the lactonization most likely is due to unavailability of effective methodology. Spectrometric methods such as IR (11Lifely M.R. Gilbert A.S. Moreno C. Carbohydr. Res. 1981; 94: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Lifely M.R. Gilbert A.S. Moreno C. Carbohydr.

We have developed a highly sensitive and efficient method for analysis of OSA/PSA using high performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) and pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) by utilizing either neutral or alkaline conditions for separation (27Zhang Y. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Lee Y.C. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). By using this method, we systematically studied acid-catalyzed lactonization of OSA/PSA as reported in this paper.

Ohta, Kyoto Research Laboratories, Marukin Shoyu Co., Uji, Japan. The enzyme activity was defined and determined as reported (28Myers R.W. Lee R.T. Lee Y.C. Thomas G.H. Reynolds L.W. Uchida Y. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 101: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Oligo(α2,8-Neu5Gc), Oligo(α2,8-KDN), and polysialoglycoprotein (PSGP) from salmon eggs are gifts from Drs. S. and Y. Inoue, Academia Sinica (Taipei, Taiwan). Oligo-Neu5Acs were also prepared as described (29Kitazume S. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, a quaternary methylamine anion-exchange column (1 × 29 cm) was used in 10 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.5) with a linear gradient eluent from 0 to 0.4m NaCl. Samples were adjusted to pH 12 for a few minutes prior to the chromatography (see “Discussion”). To remove the contaminating free oligo/poly-Neu5Gc chains (resulted from auto-hydrolysis) as well as peptides free of oligo/poly-Neu5Gc from PSGP, 10 mg of the PSGP was fractionated on a Sephacryl S-300 column (1 × 118 cm) equilibrated and eluted with 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.6). The effluent was monitored byA 215 nm, and the absorption peaks were checked with HPAEC by injecting small aliquots of the fractions before and after partial hydrolysis with 0.1 m HCl at 80 °C for 15 min. Fractions containing intact PSGP showed the diagnostic peak patterns of oligo/poly-Neu5Gc by HPAEC (27Zhang Y. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Lee Y.C. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) only after partial hydrolysis. Such fractions were therefore pooled and desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column (0.7 × 19 cm) equilibrated and eluted with water, freeze-dried, and stored at −20 °C. Dionex (Sunnyvale, CA) Bio-LC was used with the CarboPac PA-1 and PA-100 columns in combination with a pulsed amperometric detector (PAD-2) using the SC-PAD-2 detector cell with a gold working electrode and a silver/AgCl reference electrode. The detector sensitivity was set at 1 μA. Potential and time settings of the detector were as follows: E 1 = +0.05 V (t 1 = 0.42 s), E 2 = +0.65 V (t 2 = 0.18 s),E 3 = −0.10 V (t 3 = 0.36 s). These settings are optimal for nitrate eluent and also give excellent results when eluting with NaOH only or NaOH with sodium acetate. A Spectra SYSTEM AS3000 autosampler (Thermo Separation Products, San Jose, CA) was used for sample injection and maintenance of sample temperature at 4 °C prior to injection. Data were collected via Dionex ACI (advanced computer interface) and Dionex AI-450 software. For the separation of the lactones, neutral nitrate gradients were produced by mixing 0.5 m NaNO3 and water. Freshly prepared 0.5 m NaNO3, typically of pH 6.0–6.5, was used directly for HPAEC. However, the pH of the solution stored in the reservoir of the eluent degas module (Dionex) must be tested to confirm that a proper pH is maintained. 3The pH may rise occasionally because of contamination from the NaOH-containing reservoirs. To ensure detector response and to maintain a stable base line, a postcolumn pneumatic controller (Dionex) driven by pressured nitrogen gas was used to add a solution of 0.5 m NaNO3 in 1m NaOH at 0.5 ml/min to the postcolumn eluent before it enters the detector. When it was desirable to have lactone rings opened, alkaline elutions were used that contained a constant flow of 0.1 m NaOH in addition to a gradient generated with 0.5m NaNO3. All eluents were sparged and pressured under helium using the Dionex eluent degas module. Lactonization of α2,8-linked OSA/PSA were induced with such mild acidic solutions as 40 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.8), 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 3.2), and 20 mm HCl. Lactonization at 4 °C, room temperature (23 °C), 37, 55, and 80 °C were tested. Samples were also lactonized by passing through a Dowex 50 (H+-form) column at room temperature. Lactonization in strong acid was performed by treating the samples with 1 m HCl at ambient temperature for 2 h or at 4 °C overnight. The samples were diluted 100 times with water before injection. When 250 mg of colominic acid (Na+-form) was dissolved in 1 ml of 1 m HCl and kept at ambient temperature for 2 h, a white, milky suspension of extensively lactonized PSA was formed, which will be referred to as “polylactone.” Polylactone was separated by centrifugation and washed with 1 ml of distilled de-ionized water three times by repeated suspension and centrifugation. After freeze-drying, the polylactone samples were stored at −20 °C. Colominic acid (100 mg, Na+-form) was dissolved in 1 ml of water and dialyzed against 1 liter of distilled de-ionized water at 4 °C for 3 days in a dialysis tubing (molecular mass cut-off = 1 kDa) with a daily change of water. After dialysis, the sample was lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. Freeze-drying and subsequent storage of the dried sample at −20 °C did not change the lactonization pattern (data not shown). Dialysis of pentamer and hexamer of oligo-Neu5Ac was performed on a micro scale. 4Details of this procedure will be published elsewhere. Briefly, 50 μl each of the samples (Na+-form) at 1 mg/ml was transferred into a 250-μl polypropylene screw-top microvial (Sun Brokers, Wilmington, NC). A cut piece of dialysis membrane (molecular mass cut-off = 1 kDa) was placed on top of the vial and screwed tight with an open-top cap. The vial was immersed upside-down in 500 ml of distilled de-ionized water and dialyzed with stirring at 4 °C for 1 day. After dialysis, the samples were diluted with water before analysis by HPAEC. OSA of DP2–6 were purified on a quaternary methylamine column as described earlier and desalted by passing through a Bio-Gel P-2 column equilibrated and eluted with 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The sample solutions were frozen and stored at −20 °C for 6 months to 1 year and analyzed by HPAEC. Neuraminidase digestion was performed at 4 °C to minimize possible opening or rearrangement of the lactone rings as well as auto-hydrolysis of glycosidic linkages. Dialyzed OSA and colominic acid were diluted with 80 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.8) to a final concentration of 40 mm sodium acetate and digested with a neuraminidase (20–80 milliunits of enzyme per μg of substrate) at 4 °C for different periods and directly injected to the CarboPac PA-1 column. Following the analysis, the column was cleaned by eluting with 0.2 m NaOH at 0.2 ml/min overnight to remove any neuraminidase that might have accumulated under neutral eluting condition. The stability of colominic acid polylactones in acid was tested by hydrolyzing lactonized (experimental) and freshly NaOH-treated (control) samples. For experimental samples, to a mixture of 57 μl of 1 mHCl and 10 μl of 1 m NaOH in a 0.5-ml screw-capped polypropylene microcentrifuge tube (USA/Scientific Plastics, Ocala, FL) was added 400 μl of 3 mg/ml polylactone. For control samples, 10 μl of 1 m NaOH and 400 μl of 3 mg/ml polylactone were mixed and kept at ambient temperature for 5 min to open all lactone rings. To the mixture was then added 57 μl of 1 m HCl. The experimental and control, both in capped tubes with a final concentration of 0.1 m HCl, were heated at 80 °C in a glycerol bath in a heating block. After different times, the tubes were cooled on ice, and a calculated amount of NaOH was added to neutralize the solutions. Aliquots of the neutralized samples were analyzed with HPAEC using an alkaline sodium nitrate as eluent. Acid hydrolysis of purified PSGP was carried out in a similar manner. For the experimental, 20 μl of 10 mg/ml PSGP and 10 μl of 0.1m NaOH were mixed and kept at ambient temperature for 10 min to remove any possible O-acetylation that may prevent lactonization. To the mixture was added 10 μl of 4 m HCl and left at ambient temperature for 2 h (to induce lactonization) followed by dilution with water to a final concentration of 0.1m HCl. For the control, equivalent amounts of solutions were used except that the NaOH and HCl were pre-mixed and diluted first before adding to the PSGP. The samples were then heated at 80 °C for 15 min before they were neutralized and analyzed by HPAEC. We have shown that colominic acid can be separated into a series of peaks by HPAEC using a neutral nitrate eluent (27Zhang Y. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Lee Y.C. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Under neutral elution conditions, retention of OSA/PSA on the CarboPac PA-1 column is mainly determined by the number of ionized carboxyl groups. Lactonization reduces the number of negative charges and should cause the elution time to decrease. Indeed, we observed that the peak distribution pattern of OSA/PSA changed upon lactonization. However, fragmentation of OSA/PSA due to glycosidic bond cleavage can also change the peak distribution pattern. To distinguish between the two possible causes, we treated the sample with NaOH (final concentration of 20 mm over and above neutralization of acids) immediately before injection or carried out the elution using an alkaline nitrate eluent. Brief exposure to alkali such as these opened lactone rings but retained glycosidic linkages. Representative chromatograms from a series of periodic injections of a colominic acid sample kept at 4 °C in 20 mm HCl solution are shown in Fig. 2. The original peak distribution pattern of the sample (Fig. 2 A) changed within 40 min in 20 mm HCl (Fig. 2 B). The peak height of high DP homologues decreased dramatically, and new peaks (which are unlabeled) appeared between the two adjacent low DP homologue peaks (which are labeled with DP). Continued incubation resulted in further decrease of the high DP peaks, and the pattern of new peaks between the two adjacent low DP homologues became more complex (Fig.2 C). However, in the subsequent analysis (Fig.2 D) in which the same sample after 10 h incubation was treated with NaOH prior to injection, all the original high DP peaks were restored concomitant with disappearance of the new peaks found between the two adjacent low DP homologues. The peak distribution patterns of Fig. 2, A and D, are nearly the same except that in Fig. 2 D monomer and dimer peaks increased somewhat, apparently due to limited glycosidic cleavage. These results suggest that there was no significant degradation of the high DP homologues under the acidic condition used here. Therefore, the apparent diminishing of high DP homologues in Fig. 2, B andC, was mostly caused by lactonization and not by hydrolysis. The lactonized species not only appeared as the alkali-sensitive new peaks between two adjacent low-DP homologues (Fig. 2, B andC) but also fused together, forming a broad raised base line (Fig. 2 C) similar to the pattern shown by capillary electrophoresis (16Cheng M.-C. Lin S.-L. Wu S.-H. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 260: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). By comparing samples with and without NaOH treatment, significant lactonization of OSA/PSA was also observed under conditions that were frequently used for acid hydrolysis. For example, at pH 4.8, a lactonization pattern similar to that of Fig. 2 B was observed at both 37 and 55 °C (not shown). At 80 °C in 0.1m HCl, which is a typical hydrolytic condition for de-sialylation of glycoconjugates, instead of fragmentation of OSA/PSA chains revealed by the NaOH-treated hydrolysate, extensive lactonization occurred as indicated by broad peaks around monomer, dimer and trimer, respectively (not shown). Since lactonization requires protonation of the carboxyl group, we tested whether colominic acid in free acid form can spontaneously form lactones. A colominic acid (Na+-form) solution was passed through a Dowex 50 (H+-form) column and examined by HPAEC. A pattern similar to that of Fig. 2 C was observed (not shown), indicating that lactonization proceeded quickly and extensively. This result was consistent with that obtained by IR spectroscopy (11Lifely M.R. Gilbert A.S. Moreno C. Carbohydr. Res. 1981; 94: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Lifely M.R. Gilbert A.S. Moreno C. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 134: 229-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mere dialysis of the colominic acid sample (Na+-form) against water also induced limited and selective lactonization, which gave a pattern (not shown) similar to that of Fig. 2 B. To ascertain if the shifting of individual peaks is due to lactonization and also to assign proper DP values to these peaks, we studied lactonization of purified individual oligo(α2,8-Neu5Ac) of DP2–6. All incubations were at 4 °C to minimize glycosidic cleavage. A set of chromatograms after 10 h incubation at pH 3.2 is shown in Fig.3. Each chromatogram (Fig. 3,B–E) except for that of dimer (Fig. 3 A) contains three kinds of peaks as follows: 1) the latest eluting original OSA peak; 2) the small peaks of monomer, dimer, and trimer, etc. (resulted from hydrolysis); and 3) the broad and skewed peaks labeled withL. When these samples were treated with NaOH, all the L peaks disappeared, whereas the original OSA peaks were restored nearly to their original height (not shown). Therefore, the L peaks are lactonized species. As a specific example, Neu5Ac pentamer (Fig. 3 D) formed three groups of lactonized species, designated as 5L3, 5L2, and 5L1 (see Footnote 2). We interpret that 5L3, 5L2, and 5L1 are pentamers with different numbers of lactone rings since they eluted in close proximity to non-lactonized dimer, trimer, and tetramer (indicating that they have 2, 3, and 4 residual carboxyl groups, see “Discussion”), respectively. Within each L peak there are lactone ring position isomers, which is reflected by the broad and skewed nature of the L peaks. Such assignments were supported by data obtained under higher chromatographic resolution, which was accomplished by using a more moderate gradient or isocratic elution. For example, the two lactone ring position isomers (see Fig. 1; (Neu5Acα2, 8)3-(1′:9)-lactone (A) and (Neu5Acα2, 8)3-(1“:9′)-lactone (B)) in the peak 3L1 (Fig.3 B) were isolated using isocratic elution. They both reverted to the original trimer upon the NaOH treatment (data not shown). Interestingly, Neu5Ac dimer did not form any lactone even when kept at 4 °C for 3 days (data not shown). We also quantified each species at timed intervals, on the basis that the molar response factors of lactonized species are equal to or close to those of their parent non-lactonized species (see “Discussion”). Quantitative analysis of the average lactonization rate at potential lactonizable sites on each OSA revealed that OSA with higher DP lactonized more rapidly and had higher percentage of potential sites being lactonized (not shown). Fig.4 shows the lactonization patterns of oligo-Neu5Acs of DP2–6 after incubation in 1 m HCl at 4 °C overnight. Treating these samples with NaOH reversed all the lactone (L-labeled) peaks to their non-lactonized precursors (see dash-lined chromatograms in Fig. 4). Compared with the patterns shown in Fig. 3, lactonization was more extensive, and more than half of dimers eluted as an alkali-sensitive peak that had the same elution time as monomer, which indicated that the lactonized dimers contained one lactone ring per molecule (labeled as 2L1). Lactone peaks (i.e. 3L2, 4L3, 5L4, and 6L5) having approximately the same elution time with monomer also appeared as the major species in each of other OSA, suggesting that a significant fraction of these molecules underwent complete lactonization, which involved all carboxyl groups except that on the reducing-terminal residue (see the (Neu5Acα2,8)3-(1′:9, 1“:9′)-di-lactone (AB) in Fig. 1). Similar to the results observed at pH 3.2, OSA with higher DP lactonized more rapidly and extensively. For instance, whereas all the pentamer and hexamer molecules lactonized, the original non-lactonized molecules still existed in OSA with DP <5. Surprisingly, degradation by acid hydrolysis was hardly detected in oligo-Neu5Acs kept at 4 °C in 1 m HCl, suggesting that formation of lactone rings protects against glycosidic cleavage (also see other results shown later). The above results show that lactonization of OSA/PSA can occur in discrete stages (see “Discussion”). The most interesting stage is the “initial stage,” which is manifested by a limited and selective lactonization pattern (Fig. 2 B). This stage can be reached also by simply dialyzing the sample against water or by prolonged storage in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) at −20 °C. The lactonization patterns in Fig. 5,A1 and B1, show that dialyzed pentamer and hexamer each formed one major lactone peak that eluted near the non-lactonized tetramer and pentamer peaks, respectively, indicating only mono-lactone was formed from each oligomer. Similar patterns were observed in oligo-Neu5Acs of DP4–6 after long term storage at −20 °C but that dimer and trimer did not form any lactone. NaBH4-reduced colominic acid can still be lactonized in a similar fashion as non-reduced colominic acid (not shown), supporting th"

SSAT converts spermine and spermidine to their N 1-acetyl derivatives, which can be excreted from the cell or further metabolized, by polyamine oxidase, ultimately to putrescine. SSAT activity is highly regulated and is induced in response to high intracellular levels of natural polyamines (3Pegg A.E. Erwin B.G. Biochem.

Additionally, SSAT activity can be induced by a number of other stimuli, including hormones, physiological stimuli, drugs, and toxic agents (1Casero R.A. Pegg A.E.

Cellular levels of SSAT are usually very low, and therefore, it has been difficult to study the regulation of this enzyme under cellular conditions where it is not induced. Studies of SSAT under conditions where the enzyme has been induced have provided evidence of SSAT regulation at the levels of transcription (5Casero R.A. Mank A.R. Xiao L. Smith J. Bergeron R.J.

Structural polyamine analogues of the bis(ethyl)polyamine type, which are currently of interest as cancer chemotherapeutic agents because of antineoplastic effects against a variety of tumor types, are the most potent inducers of SSAT activity identified to date (1Casero R.A. Pegg A.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 12Casero R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P.

Prestigiacomo L.J. Bergeron R.J. Casero R.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2071-2075PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that although these analogues are quite similar in structure to the natural polyamines and can induce SSAT activity, they are not themselves substrates of the acetyltransferase because of their N terminal substituents. The bis(ethyl)polyamine analogues accumulate intracellularly, induce SSAT activity, and deplete intracellular polyamine pools. Correlations have been demonstrated between the cytotoxicity of these analogues and the SSAT induction, which in some cell types can reach greater than 1000-fold. However, it is not yet clear whether SSAT induction is integral to analogue cytotoxicity. How the various levels of SSAT regulation combine to produce the rapid and high induction of enzyme activity, which results from exposure to these analogues is not yet fully understood. The current studies were therefore carried out to obtain a greater understanding of the natural cellular regulation of the SSAT enzyme in its noninduced state and to examine SSAT regulation during induction of the enzyme by the polyamine analogueN 1,N 12-bis(ethyl)spermine (BE 3-4-3). We now report the establishment of a CHO cell line stably transfected with human SSAT and which expresses levels of SSAT activity which have allowed investigation of cellular properties and regulation of the enzyme in its noninduced state. Induction of SSAT by BE 3-4-3 was used to provide a more detailed understanding of SSAT regulation by contrasting the properties of SSAT in the presence of the analogue to those in the noninduced state. [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (50 or 63 Ci/mol) was obtained from ICN Biochemicals (Costa Mesa, CA). The proteasome inhibitor MG 132 was purchased from Calbiochem. Cycloheximide was obtained from Sigma. LipofectAMINE and Geneticin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. BE 3-4-3 was kindly provided by Dr. Raymond Bergeron (University of Florida, Gainesville, FL). CHO cells were maintained in minimum essential α-medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biological, Norcross, GA), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (CHO medium). Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere and were passaged every 5–7 days to maintain exponential growth. To assess cell growth over time, cells were plated at 2 × 10 3 cells/cm2 in 24-well plates in 2 ml of medium and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere. Cells from triplicate wells were harvested at appropriate times and counted using a model ZF Coulter Counter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). To assess the colony forming ability of the transfected cell lines, single cell suspensions of each cell line were plated in triplicate in 60-mm culture dishes, at densities of 25, 50, 100, and 150 cells/dish, in 6 ml of CHO medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin (selective medium). Cells were grown for 5 or 10 days and then stained with crystal violet (5% (w/v) in 95% ethanol) to visualize colonies. Colonies of ≥50 cells were counted. The plasmid pSAT9.3 containing the SSAT cDNA in the Bluescript vector (15Casero Jr., R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Applegren N.B. Wiest L. Pegg A.E. J. Biol.

The resulting product contained the entire SSAT coding region flanked by 31 and 123 base pairs of 5′ and 3′-noncoding sequences, respectively. The BamHI/NheI fragment was sequenced to confirm the absence of polymerase chain reaction-induced mutations and ligated into the same sites of a pCMV-Neo-Bam vector generously provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore MD) in which the multiple cloning site had been expanded to include unique AflII andNheI sites. The resulting plasmid was termed pCMV-SSAT. Exponentially growing CHO cells were plated at a density of 1 × 104cells/cm2 and 12–18 h allowed for adherence to the culture plate. For transfection, cells were incubated with LipofectAMINE (20 μg/plate) and 2 μg of plasmid DNA for 5 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 5 h, the medium was aspirated, fresh medium (minimum essential α-medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) was added, and cultures were incubated for an additional 43 h. Cells were then replated at low density in selective medium and incubated for 12–16 days, at which time individual colonies were selected and transferred to individual wells of a 24-well plate. Exponentially growing cells were plated in triplicate at 5–6 × 104 cells/cm2. Following attachment, the medium was changed, and the cells were incubated for 48 h, unless otherwise indicated. SSAT activity was determined in cellular extracts by an assay which measures the amount of incorporation of radioactivity from [1-14C]acetyl-CoA into [1-14C]acetylspermidine in 10 min at 30 °C as described previously (16Matsui I. Wiegand L. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2454-2459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A standard assay mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 3 mm spermidine, and 16 μm (50 mCi/mmol) or 12.7 μm (63 mCi/mmol) [1-14C]acetyl-CoA in a total volume of 100 μl. For assessment of SSAT half-life, at the end of the 48-h incubation period, 200 μm cycloheximide was added in the absence or presence of any other agent. Cells were harvested at the time of cycloheximide addition and at no fewer than four subsequent times, and SSAT activity was measured. SSAT activity half-life was determined from an exponential curve fit applied to plots of SSAT activityversus time. Values reported were derived from several individual experiments, each of which contained triplicate cultures at each time point and are the mean ± S.D. where n = the number of individual samples assayed. To adjust for variation between complete experiments, all values were normalized to the mean SSAT activity at time 0. Cells were plated as described for SSAT activity determination, harvested, and extracted with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Aliquots were then assayed for polyamine content using an ion-pair reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography separation method and postderivatization with o-phthalaldehyde as described previously (17Pegg A.E. Wechter R. Poulin R. Woster P.M. Coward J.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8446-8453Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Proteins present in cellular extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE using a 15% gel. Electrotransfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Micron Separations Inc., Waterborough, MA) was followed by hybridization with a polyclonal anti-SSAT antibody (prepared as described previously (18Casero Jr., R.A. Gabrielson E.W. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3955-3958PubMed Google Scholar)) and detection using the Vistra Western blot detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Visualization and quantitation were accomplished using a Molecular Dynamics Fluorimager model 595 and ImageQuant application software. The35S-labeled wtSSAT protein was synthesized in the TNT-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) from the T7 promoter of the plasmid pSAT9.3 containing the SSAT cDNA in the Bluescript vector (15Casero Jr., R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Applegren N.B. Wiest L. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 810-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (19Coleman C.S. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12164-12169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To follow the rate of SSAT degradation, 30-μl aliquots were removed from the crude reticulocyte lysate assay at the desired times, mixed with SDS sample buffer, boiled for 10 min, and resolved by SDS-PAGE as described previously. Total cellular RNA was isolated using Qiashredder columns and the RNeasy RNA purification kit from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). Northern analysis was carried out using Hybond N+ membrane according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Ethidium bromide staining was used as a loading control. A fluorescein-labeled full-length SSAT probe, to which membranes were hybridized, was prepared by transcription from the T3 promoter of the pSAT9.3 plasmid containing the SSAT cDNA in the Bluescript vector (15Casero Jr., R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Applegren N.B. Wiest L. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 810-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Signal detection utilized the Vistra signal amplification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and visualization and quantitation were the same as for Western blot analysis. In order to establish a cell line that would express increased levels of SSAT activity, CHO cells were stably transfected with pCMV-SSAT, a plasmid coding for human wtSSAT under control of the CMV promoter. Forty-four clones were selected and screened for SSAT activity levels in the absence and presence of BE 3-4-3, which was used to determine whether the SSAT activity of the clone was inducible by a polyamine analogue. Of the 44 clones selected, 13 exhibited significantly greater basal SSAT activity (650–1900 pmol/min/mg protein) than control cells transfected with empty vector (24 pmol/min/mg protein) (Fig.1). SSAT activity of the same 13 clones was also induced, after 48 h in the presence of 0.5 or 1 μm BE 3-4-3, to levels significantly higher than those induced in control cells under the same conditions (Fig. 1). The clones were numbered sequentially at the time that each was transferred from its initial culture well when confluence had been reached. Therefore, the numbering reflects the relative initial growth rates of the individual clones with clone 1 the fastest and clone 44 the slowest. Twelve of the 13 clones that expressed increased basal levels of SSAT were among the clones numbered 22–44, suggesting that the increased SSAT levels may have had an effect on the initial growth of these clones and slowed the establishment of thriving colonies. The wtSSAT clone 43, which exhibited increased basal SSAT expression both in the absence and presence of the inducing agent, was selected for further studies and is the clonal cell line referred to unless otherwise stated. Since one objective of these studies was to determine whether increased SSAT activity has an effect on cell growth and viability, the colony forming ability and population growth characteristics of the wtSSAT clone were compared with those of control cells containing empty vector. Assessment of the ability to form colonies from single cells revealed that the size of the colonies resulting from growth of the wtSSAT clone, either 5 days (Fig. 2) or 10 days following plating, was considerably smaller than that of colonies formed from control cells. Visual inspection of cell size and cell number per colony indicated that this difference in colony size was a result of cell number per colony and cannot be attributed to differences in the sizes of individual cells between the wtSSAT clone and the control. This indicates a difference in the rate of growth between the two cell lines with growth of the wtSSAT cells slower than the vector control under these clonal conditions. The percent of colonies formed, however, was quite similar for the wtSSAT clone (46 ± 3 at day 5 and 51 ± 8 at day 10) and the vector control (50 ± 8 at day 5 and 55 ± 10 at day 10). Despite the slower rate of growth of the wtSSAT cells observed in the colony forming experiments described above, there was no detrimental effect of SSAT expression on the growth of exponentially growing cultures of the wtSSAT cells. Populations of untreated wtSSAT clone cells and vector control cells grew similarly, with doubling times of 19.2 ± 1.6 and 17.5 ± 0.6 h, respectively and a plateau density for each of 4–5 × 105cell/cm2. The presence of higher levels of SSAT also had little effect on cell growth in the presence of 1 μm BE 3-4-3, with cessation of exponential growth between 48 and 72 h and a final density 8–10 times the original cell number for the vector control and 14–17 times the original cell number for the wtSSAT clone. IC50values determined following 120-h incubation with BE 3-4-3 were 2 × 10−8m and 9 × 10−9m for the wtSSAT clone and vector control, respectively, indicating a slight decrease in the sensitivity of the wtSSAT clone to this polyamine analogue. Two other wtSSAT clones (clones 29 and 41) that had increased levels of basal SSAT activity similar to clone 43 were also tested for colony forming ability, population growth, and sensitivity to BE 3-4-3. Results were similar to those reported for wtSSAT clone 43 (data not shown). These results suggest that an increase in basal SSAT activity from 24 to ∼1600 pmol/min/mg protein may have an effect on initial cell growth rates from a single cell but does not adversely affect the growth of the exponentially growing cell populations. In fact, the results suggest that the increased SSAT activity may even render these cells marginally less sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of the polyamine analogue BE 3-4-3. To assess the effects of the increased basal SSAT levels on polyamine homeostasis in the wtSSAT clone, intracellular polyamine pools, SSAT activity, and activity of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) andS-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC), two of the polyamine synthetic enzymes, were measured over time (TableI). The SSAT activity of the wtSSAT clone was initially higher than control and rose throughout the 48-h period of the measurements, while that of the control cells remained comparatively low at all time points. ODC activity increased in both the control and wtSSAT clone over time, but was higher in the wtSSAT clone at all times. AdoMetDC activity was initially higher in the wtSSAT clone and increased to a greater extent over time than that of the control. Distinct polyamine pool perturbations were observed at all time points in wtSSAT cells, where putrescine levels were highly increased, spermidine levels were moderately decreased, andN 1-acetylspermidine andN 8-acetylspermidine were present in measurable quantities.Table IPolyamine pools and SSAT, ODC, and AdoMetDC activities in wtSSAT and vector control cellsTimePolyaminesEnzyme activitiesPutrescineSpermidineSpermineN 1-AcetylspermidineN 8-AcetylspermidineSSATODCAdoMetDChnmol/mg proteinpmol/min/mg proteinnmol/30 min/mg proteinnmol/30 min/mg proteinControl04.47 ± 1.789.80 ± 0.445.25 ± 0.75NDaND, not detected.ND8 ± 40.22 ± 0.090.31 ± 0.10244.32 ± 0.7211.05 ± 1.726.14 ± 0.88NDND11 ± 20.58 ± 0.040.46 ± 0.08483.07 ± 0.9810.22 ± 3.735.51 ± 1.71NDND12 ± 10.55 ± 0.090.41 ± 0.12wtSSAT014.73 ± 2.607.41 ± 1.094.19 ± 0.330.73 ± 0.160.74 ± 0.16309 ± 160.84 ± 0.120.90 ± 0.192419.00 ± 2.048.96 ± 1.256.28 ± 0.561.48 ± 0.210.76 ± 0.17479 ± 391.21 ± 0.021.69 ± 0.124822.22 ± 2.067.11 ± 0.855.02 ± 0.401.50 ± 0.341.02 ± 0.18932 ± 241.99 ± 0.062.42 ± 0.67Intracellular polyamine levels, and the activity of SSAT, ODC, and AdoMetDC, were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures,” using cell extracts of exponentially growing control or wtSSAT clone cells harvested at 0, 24, and 48 h.

Open table in a new tab Intracellular polyamine levels, and the activity of SSAT, ODC, and AdoMetDC, were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures,” using cell extracts of exponentially growing control or wtSSAT clone cells harvested at 0, 24, and 48 h. Values are averages ± S.D. of measurements from triplicate cultures of a representative experiment. The level of SSAT activity measured in the wtSSAT clone under normal growth conditions was sufficiently high to allow detailed investigation of the degradation of the SSAT protein and its intracellular half-life. Cells were incubated for 48 h, treated with cycloheximide to prevent new protein synthesis, and then harvested for SSAT activity measurements and Western blot analysis to quantitate the amount of SSAT protein. From the assay results (Fig. 3), the SSAT activity half-life was determined to be 29 min and the SSAT protein half-life was 26 min. These data indicate that, in the noninduced state, the SSAT protein is short-lived and that decreases in protein are responsible for and directly proportional to reductions in enzyme activity. Preliminary indications that SSAT may be degraded via the ubiquitin/proteasomal pathway have been published based on in vitro studies of the breakdown of SSAT protein synthesized in a coupled transcription/translation system in reticulocyte lysates (19Coleman C.S. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12164-12169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We have now found that a specific inhibitor of the 26 S proteasome, MG 132 (20Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar), has a profound effect on SSAT degradation in this system (Fig. 4). In the absence of the proteasomal inhibitor, SSAT was rapidly degraded and higher molecular weight bands of labeled protein, consistent with ubiquitination of SSAT, appeared at 15 min and remained present through 1 h. In the presence of 50 μm MG 132, the rate of degradation of SSAT was reduced and the SSAT-ubiquitin bands were visible throughout the 3-h period of the assay (Fig. 4). To confirm that intracellular degradation of SSAT occurs through the proteasome complex as suggested by the in vitro data, two types of experiments were carried out using the transfected CHO cells. First, SSAT activity and SSAT protein amounts were assessed in the presence of 25 μm MG 132 added concurrently with cycloheximide so that the effect of the proteasomal inhibitor on the intracellular half-life of SSAT could be determined (Fig.5). In the presence of MG 132, the SSAT activity and protein amounts were directly proportional (Fig. 5), as they were in the absence of the inhibitor (Fig. 3). The SSAT activity and SSAT protein half-lives were each extended significantly from 29 min to >300 min in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor. Second, the cellular SSAT activity was assessed at the beginning and end of a 4 h incubation in the absence or presence of 10, 25, and 50 μm MG 132. With no drug present, SSAT activity increased only slightly from 1338 ± 140 to 1587 ± 140 pmol/min/mg protein after 4 h. In contrast, SSAT activity was increased significantly to 4805 ± 383, 4668 ± 113, and 4182 ± 430 pmol/min/mg protein, following 4-h exposure to 10, 25, or 50 μm MG 132, respectively. These results correlate with the reduced protein degradation in the presence of MG 132 observed with the SSAT half-life determination. Together, these data indicate that cellular SSAT degradation is occurring through proteasomal action with loss of protein and enzyme activity occurring simultaneously. Having established SSAT parameters under noninducing conditions, it was possible to investigate changes in SSAT regulation during induction by the polyamine analogue BE 3-4-3, one of the most potent SSAT-inducing agents known. SSAT activity and protein expression were assessed in crude extracts of the wtSSAT clone and vector control following 48-h incubation with BE 3-4-3 concentrations ranging from 0 to 25 μm. Cells of the wtSSAT clone exhibited basal SSAT activity of ∼700 pmol/min/mg protein, a 2-fold increase in SSAT activity was noted at 0.1 μm BE 3-4-3, the lowest concentration tested, and there was a steep concentration-dependent increase of activity to a maximum of ∼60,000 pmol/min/mg protein reached after exposure to 5 μm BE 3-4-3 (Fig.6 A). Western blot analysis indicated a concentration-dependent increase of SSAT protein, which correlated directly with the observed SSAT activity increase (Fig. 6 B). Although the SSAT activity was much lower in the control CHO cells (basal SSAT activity of ∼25 pmol/min/mg protein), similar effects of BE 3-4-3 were observed. There were SSAT activity increases of 1.5-, 2-, and 7-fold following exposure to 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 μm BE 3-4-3, respectively. The SSAT activity increase was much greater after exposure to 1 μmBE 3-4-3, and the maximum activity of ∼10,000 pmol/min/mg protein was reached at 2 μm BE 3-4-3 (Fig. 6 A). The SSAT protein of the control was detectable only in extracts from cells exposed to ≥1 μm BE 3-4-3 where a concentration-dependent increase of SSAT protein directly correlating with the SSAT activity increase was observed (Fig.6 B). These data indicate that the effects of BE 3-4-3 on SSAT regulation are similar for the control and the wtSSAT cells. The rapid and large increase of SSAT protein and activity in the presence of BE 3-4-3 may result from the effects of the analogue at one or more levels of SSAT regulation. To investigate whether this polyamine analogue was exerting an effect on the longevity of the SSAT protein, the half-life of SSAT in the presence of BE 3-4-3 was determined using two different protocols. First, cells of the wtSSAT clone were incubated in the presence of 0.5 μm BE 3-4-3 for 48 h, at which time cycloheximide was added and cells were harvested at several time points for SSAT activity measurements and half-life determination. Second, cells were incubated in drug-free conditions for 48 h, at which time 0.5 μm BE 3-4-3 was added concurrently with cycloheximide, and cells were harvested at several times for determination of SSAT activity and half-life. The presence of BE 3-4-3 for 48 h prior to the addition of cycloheximide resulted in significant lengthening of the SSAT half-life to >200 min as compared with 29 min in the absence of the polyamine analogue (Fig.7). Concurrent addition of the analogue with the inhibitor of new protein synthesis also resulted in significant lengthening of the SSAT half-life from 29 to 85 min (Fig.7). These data indicate that interaction between BE 3-4-3 and existing protein prevents degradation of the enzyme and prolongs its period of activity. To investigate the regulation of SSAT at the level of SSAT message, steady state SSAT mRNA levels were determined in control and wtSSAT cultures which had been exposed either to no drug or varying concentrations of BE 3-4-3 for 48 h. In the absence of the inducing agent, the SSAT message level of the wtSSAT clone was 5.7 ± 2.8 (n = 9) times greater than that of the control cells, indicating increased SSAT transcription with the CMV promoter. Thus, in the noninduced state an ∼6-fold increase in SSAT mRNA (described above) resulted in a ∼28-fold SSAT activity increase (Fig.6). The effect of BE 3-4-3 on the SSAT message was similar in the two cell lines with SSAT mRNA increased only slightly over that in each cell line in the absence of the polyamine analogue. At BE 3-4-3 concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 μm, in a representative experiment, the SSAT message increases were 1.6-, 2.9-, and 2.4-fold, respectively, for the control, and 1.2-, 2.1-, and 2.0-fold, respectively, for the wtSSAT clone. Therefore these data indicate that the ≤3-fold increases in steady state levels of SSAT mRNA in the presence of BE 3-4-3 are far too small to fully account for the ≥90-fold concentration-dependent induction of SSAT activity mediated by BE 3-4-3 in either the control or the wtSSAT clone. Although there is abundant evidence that SSAT plays a very important role in polyamine metabolism in mammalian cells (1Casero R.A. Pegg A.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 7Fogel-Petrovic M. Vujcic S. Brown P.J. Haddox M.K. Porter C.W.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1964-1969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), details of the mechanisms of SSAT regulation are not well understood. One of the difficulties inherent to the study of SSAT has been that the very low cellular levels of this enzyme have prevented accurate assessment of its properties under normal cellular conditions. Information related to SSAT properties and regulation has come largely from studies of the enzyme following exposure to agents that induce its activity, often quite dramatically, and that may alter its regulation. Additionally, effects on cell growth and survival often result from the use of inducing agents, and it has been difficult to assess which effects are directly attributable to the increased SSAT activity. The SSAT protein has been expressed at high levels in bacterial systems (22Parry L. Lopez-Ballester J. Wiest L. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2701-2709Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); however, stable overexpression in mammalian cells has not previously been achieved. The successful stable transfection and overexpression of the SSAT protein in CHO cells reported here has now enabled study of the properties and regulation of SSAT without the use of an inducing agent. Furthermore, the SSAT activity of all of the clones exhibiting increased basal levels of SSAT was highly inducible by BE 3-4-3, a characteristic that provided the basis for assessing changes in SSAT regulation during its induction. The basal level of SSAT activity achieved in the clones transfected with SSAT cDNA, while substantially greater than the endogenous level in CHO cells, was still modest compared with SSAT activity levels observed in many cell lines in the presence of an inducing agent. However, it should be noted that many of the potent SSAT inducers are either substrates or inhibitors of the enzyme. Therefore, the extent to which such induction alters SSAT activity toward endogenous polyamines is not clear. The increased basal level of SSAT in the transfected CHO cells (from 24 to ∼1600 pmol/min/mg protein) clearly caused altered polyamine homeostasis with perturbations in the polyamine distribution that were consistent with increased flux through the catabolic pathways. Putrescine levels were highly increased, spermidine was decreased, andN 1-acetylspermidine accumulated. The polyamine synthetic enzymes ODC and AdoMetDC are responsible for maintaining intracellular spermidine and spermine levels, and the observed increases in the activities of these enzymes would function to restore the polyamine pools depleted by SSAT mediated polyamine catabolism. These compensatory actions prevent depletion of the polyamine pools and may partially explain why there is little effect on growth of the wtSSAT clone. Polyamine depletion has been implicated in cytostasis and cytotoxicity resulting from polyamine analogues, even when SSAT activity is only moderately induced (14Davidson N.E. Mank A.R. Prestigiacomo L.J. Bergeron R.J. Casero R.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2071-2075PubMed Google Scholar, 23McCloskey D.E. Casero R.A. Woster P.M. Davidson N.E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3233-3236PubMed Google Scholar, 24Libby P.R. Henderson M. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6226-6231PubMed Google Scholar). However, in those instances, ODC was also down-regulated by the analogue and therefore no increase in polyamine synthesis occurred to replenish the pools. There was also an increase in the total intracellular polyamine content in the wtSSAT clones, a cellular parameter that is usually tightly controlled by the actions of the polyamine metabolic enzymes. The production of detectable levels ofN 8-acetylspermidine, which is unlikely to be produced directly by SSAT since SSAT is highly specific for the formation of N 1-acetylspermidine (25Della Ragione F. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), may be a cellular response to limit the total polyamine level since the only known fate of N 8-acetylspermidine is de-acetylation or excretion from the cell. The profound effects on cell growth brought about by exposure to polyamine analogues that are powerful inducers of SSAT has raised the question of whether increased SSAT activity is in itself detrimental to cell growth and survival. The current data suggest that increased SSAT activity may at least retard cell growth from the single cell stage, since the majority of the clones that exhibited increased SSAT activity were among the slowest growing of all the clones selected, no clones exhibiting extremely high levels of SSAT activity were isolated, and the wtSSAT clone 43 grew more slowly under clonal conditions. The fact that the population growth characteristics of the clones expressing increased SSAT activity were similar to the control cells suggests that the observed increase of SSAT activity does not adversely affect the growth of exponentially growing cell populations. This latter observation is consistent with the recent findings of Alhonen et al. (21Alhonen L. Karppinen A. Uusi-Oukari M. Vujcic S. Korhonen V. Halmekyto M. Kramer D. Hines R. Janne J. Porter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1964-1969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) that primary fetal fibroblasts, derived from transgenic mice overexpressing SSAT and which express a 20-fold increase in SSAT activity, grew similarly to primary fibroblasts derived from nontransgenic counterparts. The current finding that the wtSSAT clone was actually marginally less sensitive to growth inhibition by BE 3-4-3 than the control cells, however, differs from the observation in that study where the SSAT overexpressing fetal fibroblasts displayed an increased sensitivity to a polyamine analogue. The increase in SSAT expression in the transfected CHO cells was clearly due to an increase in mRNA content. There was an approximately 6-fold increase in mRNA levels in the uninduced state. This increase is probably due to the greater strength of the CMV promoter compared with the endogenous SSAT promoter, but an increased gene copy number in the transfected cells may also contribute. The observation that the magnitude of the SSAT activity increase is greater than the SSAT mRNA increase suggests translational regulation of SSAT. Regulation at the level of translation has been demonstrated for both of the polyamine synthetic enzymes ODC and AdoMetDC (26Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and this may be a common feature of the polyamine-related enzymes. Since the SSAT derived from the transfected plasmid construct does not contain the complete 5′- and 3′-UTR regions of the endogenous gene, yet the data suggest translational regulation of SSAT, we can conclude that these regions are not factors in regulation of SSAT translation in the noninduced state. Parry et al. (8Parry L. Balaña Fouce R. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have previously reported that in COS-7 cells, neither the 5′- nor 3′-UTR of SSAT mRNA was important for translational regulation of SSAT by BE 3-4-3. We have now provided data that substantiate previous estimates (8Parry L. Balaña Fouce R. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Matsui I. Pegg A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 675: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 10Erwin B.G. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) that, under conditions where the enzyme is not induced, SSAT is a short-lived protein. Our results indicate that under normal cellular growth conditions the SSAT protein has a half-life of 26–29 min and SSAT degradation occurs through the proteasomal complex. SSAT activity is directly proportional to the amount of SSAT protein. When BE 3-4-3 is present, the degradation of SSAT is inhibited, and this stabilization contributes to the increases in SSAT protein but is far less than is needed to account for the total increase observed. The lengthened SSAT half-life in the presence of the analogue, even in the absence of new protein synthesis, suggests that a direct stabilizing interaction between BE 3-4-3 and the SSAT protein may be one factor contributing to the increased SSAT activity. The results indicate that the SSAT half-life in the presence of BE 3-4-3 is increased from 29 min to greater than 200 min. The presence of BE 3-4-3 also slightly increases the amount of SSAT mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner, but this increase is also far too small to account for the massive increase in SSAT activity. Therefore, we can conclude that transcriptional regulation is not a major factor in the observed SSAT induction. The small increase in SSAT message observed may result from stabilization of the SSAT mRNA and a lengthening of the SSAT mRNA half-life. Such an effect has been observed by Fogel-Petrovic et al.(6Fogel-Petrovic M. Shappell N.W. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19118-19125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where they reported an increase of SSAT message half-life from 17 to 64 h in the presence of BE 3-4-3. The similarity of the SSAT message increase for both the control and the wtSSAT clone would indicate that if such stabilization is occurring, then it does not involve the portions of the 5′- and 3′-UTRs, which are not present in the wtSSAT clone."
https://openalex.org/W2021789745,"Signaling by guanine nucleotide–binding proteins (G proteins) involves sequential protein-protein interactions. G protein–βγ subunit (Gβγ) interactions with phospholipase C–β2 (PLC-β2) were studied to determine if all Gβ contacts are required for signaling. A peptide encoding Gβ amino acid residues 86 to 105 stimulated PLC-β2. Six residues (96 to 101) within this sequence could transfer signals and thus constitute a core signal transfer region. Another peptide, encoding Gβ amino acid residues 115 to 135, did not substantially stimulate PLC-β2 by itself but inhibited Gβγ stimulation, indicating that residues 115 to 135 constitute a general binding domain. Resolution of signal transfer regions from general binding domains indicates that all protein-protein contacts are not required for signal transfer and that it may be feasible to synthesize agonists and antagonists that regulate intracellular signal flow."
https://openalex.org/W2040574693,"In human cardiac myocytes, we have previously identified a functional β3-adrenoceptor in which stimulation reduces action potential duration. Surprisingly, in cardiac biopsies obtained from cystic fibrosis patients, β3-adrenoceptor agonists produced no effects on action potential duration. This result suggests the involvement of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride current in the electrophysiological effects of β3-adrenoceptor stimulation in non-cystic fibrosis tissues. We therefore investigated the control of CFTR activity by human β3-adrenoceptors in a recombinant system: A549 human cells were intranuclearly injected with plasmids encoding CFTR and β3-adrenoceptors. CFTR activity was functionally assayed using the 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinolinium fluorescent probe and the patch-clamp technique. Injection of CFTR-cDNA alone led to the expression of a functional CFTR protein activated by cAMP or cGMP. Co-expression of CFTR (but not of mutated ΔF508-CFTR) with high levels of β3-adrenoceptor produced an increased halide permeability under base-line conditions that was not further sensitive to cAMP or β3-adrenoceptor stimulation. Patch-clamp experiments confirmed that CFTR channels were permanently activated in cells co-expressing CFTR and a high level of β3-adrenoceptor. Permanent CFTR activation was not associated with elevated intracellular cAMP or cGMP levels. When the expression level of β3-adrenoceptor was lowered, CFTR was not activated under base-line conditions but became sensitive to β3-adrenoceptor stimulation (isoproterenol plus nadolol, SR 58611, or CGP 12177). This later effect was not prevented by protein kinase A inhibitors. Our results provide molecular evidence that CFTR but not mutated ΔF508-CFTR is regulated by β3-adrenoceptors expression through a protein kinase A-independent pathway.

Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 421-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The β3-adrenoceptor gene contains two introns (2Lelias J.M. Kaghad M. Rodriguez M. Chalon P. Bonnin J.

Biochem. 1993; 213: 1117-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) leading to alternative splice isoforms, whereas β1- and β2-adrenoceptor genes are intronless. β3-Adrenoceptors are G protein-coupled receptors that interact with either Gs or Gi proteins (4Chaudhry A.

Invest. 1996; 98: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Depending on the tissue, β3-adrenoceptor stimulation produces functional effects that are either comparable with or opposite to those produced by β1- and β2-adrenoceptor stimulation. For instance, in adipose tissue, β3-adrenoceptor stimulation increases lipolysis through an elevation in intracellular cAMP concentration (6Hollenga C. Brouwer F. Zaagsma J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 200: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7Zilberfarb V. Piétri-Rouxel F. Jockers R. Krief S. Delouis C. Issad T. Strosberg A.D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 801-807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as does β1- or β2-adrenoceptor stimulation. In the human heart, we have previously demonstrated that β3-adrenoceptors mediate negative inotropic effects (5Gauthier C. Tavernier G. Charpentier F. Langin D. Le Marec H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) in stark contrast to the classical positiveinotropic effects caused by β1- and β2-adrenoceptor stimulation. Negative inotropy as produced by β3-adrenoceptors stimulation is unlikely to be related to stimulation of the cAMP pathway but rather to stimulation of the cGMP pathway (8Gauthier C. Leblais V. Kobzik L. Trochu J.-N. Khandoudi N. Bril A. Balligand J.-L. Le Marec H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1377-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and is associated with an acceleration in the relaxation phase of the twitch and with a shortening of the action potential duration (5Gauthier C. Tavernier G. Charpentier F. Langin D. Le Marec H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The present study issued from the observation that in myocardial samples from cystic fibrosis patients, β3-adrenoceptor stimulation produced negative inotropic effects but remarkably did not shorten the action potential. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) 1The abbreviations used are: CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; CF, cystic fibrosis; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; SPQ, 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinolinium; CPT-cGMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)guanosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate; Rp-8-Br-cAMPS, Rp-8-bromoadenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothiorate; Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS, Rp-8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothiorate; BRL 37344, 4-[-[2-hydroxy-(3-chlorophenyl)ethyl-amino]propyl] phenoxyacetate; SR 58611, (R,S)-N-[(25)-7-ethoxycarbonylmethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronapht-2-yl]-(2R)-2-(3-chloro-phenyl)-2-hydroxyethanamine hydrochloride; CGP 12177, 4-[3-t- butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy]benzimidazol-2-1. gene encoding an ATP-binding cassette protein (9Riordan J.R.

Res. 1992; 71: 1002-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, the simplest explanation accounting for our observation was that β3-adrenoceptors in non-cystic fibrosis tissues control a repolarizing CFTR chloride conductance lacking in cystic fibrosis tissues. We confirmed this hypothesis using various techniques in a heterologous mammalian expression system. Human ventricular biopsies were obtained from three cystic fibrosis (CF) patients homozygous for the ΔF508 mutation who underwent cardiopulmonary transplantation and from five non-CF patients used as control. Heart and tissues were placed in a transport solution and conveyed rapidly to the laboratory. Preparations were dissected and placed in an experimental chamber. They were superfused at a flow rate of 5 ml/min with oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) Tyrode solution (37 ± 0.5 °C) composed as follows: 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.7 mm CaCl2, 1.1 mm MgCl2, 0.33 mmNaH2PO4, 5 mm glucose, and 20 mm NaHCO3. Tissues were equilibrated for 60 min and then subjected to field stimulation at a pacing cycle length of 1,700 ms. Action potentials were recorded as described previously (12Gauthier C. Laurent K. Charpentier F. Drouin E. Chevallier J.-C. Le Marec H. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1994; 26: 1267-1271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) using conventional 3 m KCl-filled microelectrodes coupled to an Ag-AgCl electrode connected to an amplifier (Biologic VF 102; Claix, France). The tissue chamber was grounded through an Ag-AgCl electrode. The action potentials were recorded on a digital tape recorder (Biologic DTR-1200) for off-line analysis. The human lung epithelial-derived cell line A549, the African green monkey kidney-derived cell line COS-7, and the human colonic carcinoma cell line T84 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). A549 and COS-7 cells were cultured as previously reported (13Mohammad-Panah R. Demolombe S. Riochet D. Leblais V. Loussouarn G. Pollard H. Baró I. Escande D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C310-C318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T84 cells were grown in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics (100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin; all from Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, Scotland), maintained in a humidified incubator (95% air, 5% CO2) at 37 °C and passaged weekly. Transgene cDNAs were subcloned into pECE or pcDNA3 mammalian expression vectors under the control of a SV40 enhancer/promoter or a cytomegalovirus promoter, respectively. pECE-CFTR (a kind gift from P. Fanen, INSERM, Créteil, France) and pcDNA3-CFTR (a gift from J. Ricardo, Lisbon, Portugal) plasmids encoded the wild-type CFTR protein. pcDNA3-ΔF508-CFTR plasmid (also from J. Ricardo) encoded the mutated ΔF508-CFTR protein. Alternative splicing of the β3-adrenoceptor mRNA could generate three isoforms with different C-terminal regions: (i) the A isoform is the shortest protein; (ii) the B isoform, which corresponds to the A isoform extended by 12 amino acids in the C-terminal region, is the only isoform expressed in rat and is supposedly not expressed in human; and (iii) the C isoform corresponds to the A isoform extended by 6 amino acids in the C-terminal region and is the prevalent isoform in humans (2Lelias J.M. Kaghad M. Rodriguez M. Chalon P. Bonnin J. Dupre I. Delpech B. Bensaid M. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Caput D. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Levasseur S. Pigeon C. Reyl-Desmars F. Caput D. Lewin M.J.M. Gastroenterol. Clin. Biol. 1995; 19: 668-672PubMed Google Scholar). As the C-terminal region of the β3-adrenoceptor is involved in the coupling with G proteins (1Strosberg A.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 421-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), plasmids encoding either for the A (pcDNA3-β3A) and C (pcDNA3-β3C) isoforms present in human tissues were generated and expressed in mammalian cells. For control experiments, we used a pECE plasmid lacking the insert and a pcDNA3-ROMK2 plasmid encoding a renal outer medulla potassium channel (a gift from S. C. Hebert, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). For microcytofluorometry and patch-clamp experiments, cells settled on glass coverslips (Nunclon; InterMed Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were microinjected with plasmids at day 1 or 2 after plating. Our protocol to intranuclearly microinject individual cells using the Eppendorf ECET microinjector 5246 system and the ECET micromanipulator 5171 system has been reported in detail elsewhere (13Mohammad-Panah R. Demolombe S. Riochet D. Leblais V. Loussouarn G. Pollard H. Baró I. Escande D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C310-C318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids were diluted at various final concentrations (0.01–130 μg/ml) in an injection buffer made of 50 mm NaOH, 40 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with NaOH, supplemented with 0.5% fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran to visualize successfully injected cells. The method we used for cell transfection with the 22-kDa polyethylenimine synthetic vector (a gift from J. P. Behr, CNRS, Illkirch, France) has been reported in detail elsewhere (15Pollard H. Remy J.-S. Loussouarn G. Demolombe S. Behr J.-P. Escande D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7507-7511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded either on glass coverslips for microcytofluorometry experiments or in 6-well plates (Poly Labo, Strasbourg, France) for cAMP and cGMP assays. The area of coverslips and wells was identical. COS-7 cells were transfected at a polyethylenimine/DNA ratio of 2 equivalents with 4 μg of plasmids/well. pcDNA3-CFTR was used at 2 μg/well, pcDNA3-β3A at 1 μg/well, and pcDNA3-β3C at 1 μg/well. To identify successfully transfected cells, we also added a plasmid encoding a green fluorescent protein (pTR-UF2-green fluorescent protein; a gift from P. Lory, CNRS, Montpellier, France) to obtain a final amount of 4 μg of plasmid/well. The Cl− channel activity of CFTR was assessed using the halide-sensitive fluorescent probe SPQ (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described previously (13Mohammad-Panah R. Demolombe S. Riochet D. Leblais V. Loussouarn G. Pollard H. Baró I. Escande D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C310-C318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 24 h post-injection or transfection, cells placed on glass coverslips were loaded with SPQ using a hypotonic shock procedure. The coverslip was mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Diaphot; Nikon, Japan) equipped for fluorescence and illuminated at 360 nm. The emitted light was collected at 456 ± 33 nm by a high resolution image intensifier coupled to a video camera (Extended ISIS camera system; Photonic Science, Robertsbridge, United Kingdom) connected to a digital image processing board controlled by FLUO software (Imstar, France). Cells were maintained at 37 °C and continuously superfused with the extracellular solution containing: 145 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4, with NaOH. A microperfusion system allowed local application and rapid change of the different experimental mediums. I− and NO3− mediums were identical to the extracellular solution except that I− and NO3− replaced Cl− as the dominant extracellular anion. I− and NO3− mediums also contained 10 μm bumetamide (Sigma) to inhibit the Cl−/Na+/K+ co-transporter. To standardize fluorescence intensity, the initial fluorescence level in the presence of I− was taken as zero. The membrane permeability to halides (p) was determined as the rate of SPQ dequenching upon perfusion with NO3− medium (see Fig.2 A). Whole cell currents were recorded with the ruptured patch configuration of the patch-clamp technique as described previously (16Baró I. Roch B. Hongre A.-S. Escande D. J. Physiol. 1994; 478: 469-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cells were placed on the stage of an inverted microscope and bathed at 37 °C in the same extracellular solution as used in SPQ experiments. Patch pipettes with a tip resistance of 2.5–5 MΩ were electrically connected to a patch-clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200A; Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Stimulation, data recording and analysis were performed by Acquis I software made by Gérard Sadoc (distributed by Biologic) through an analog-to-digital converter (Tecmar TM100 Labmaster; Scientific Solution, Solon, OH). The pipette solution contained 74.5 mm CsCl, 70.5 mm aspartic acid, 5 mm HEPES, 1 mm BAPTA, 5 mm MgATP, pH 7.2, with CsOH. During Cl− current recording, the cell was locally perfused with a Cl− free solution containing 149 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with CsOH. Two stimulation protocols were used: voltage ramps applied at a frequency of 0.2 Hz from −80 to +60 mV (depolarization rate, 46.7 mV/s; holding potential, −60 mV) and voltage steps imposed for 500 ms every 2 s from −60 mV to various potentials between −100 and +60 mV. Determination of intracellular cAMP and cGMP contents was performed 24 h after transfection. COS-7 cells were incubated in the extracellular solution supplemented with 100 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. For the cAMP assay, cells were incubated at 37 °C with the same medium containing either 0 or 10 μm forskolin (Sigma) for 5 min. For the cGMP assay, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 500 μm cGMP analog for 20 min. At the end of the incubation period, cells were lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing. All samples were subsequently boiled at 90 °C for 5 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were assayed for cAMP or cGMP by using a cAMP or cGMP enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI). Data are the means ± S.E. of duplicate assays and normalized to total cell protein content determined by the method of Lowry et al. (17Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cAMP-stimulating mixture contained 10 μm forskolin plus 100 μm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. A cGMP analog, CPT-cGMP (8-(4-chlorophenylthio)guanosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate) and two PKA inhibitors, Rp-8-Br-cAMPS (Rp-8-bromoadenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothiorate), and Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS (Rp-8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothiorate) were obtained from Biolog (Bremen, Germany). (−)-Isoproterenol and nadolol were from Sigma. BRL 37344 (4-[-[2-hydroxy-(3-chlorophenyl)ethyl-amino]propyl] phenoxyacetate) was a gift from SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals (Surrey, UK), SR 58611 ((R,S)-N-[(25)-7-ethoxycarbonylmethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronapht-2-yl]-(2R)-2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethanamine hydrochloride) was from Sanofi Recherche (Montpellier, France) and CGP 12177 (4-[3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy]benzimidazol-2-1) was from Ciba Geigy (Basel, Switzerland). For SPQ experiments, drugs were dissolved in Me2SO (Sigma) so that the final concentration of the solvent was less than 0.1%. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. ofn number of experiments. Statistical significance of the observed effects was assessed by a Student's t test. In control human endomyocardial tissues from non-CF patients (Fig. 1), the specific β3-adrenoceptor agonist BRL 37344 (0.3 μm) reduced the action potential duration by −13.8 ± 3.8% (n = 5; p < 0.01) and also slightly reduced the action potential amplitude (−3.7 ± 0.4%;p < 0.05). These effects were not observed in eight myocardial preparations obtained from ΔF508/ΔF508 CF patients (Fig.1), suggesting that the electrophysiological effects of β3-adrenoceptor stimulation in non-CF tissues were mediated by activation of a chloride repolarizing current flowing through CFTR channels that are not functional in CF cardiac muscle. CFTR channels are known to activate under intracellular cAMP (18Cheng S.H. Rich D.P. Marshall J. Gregory R.J. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2700-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of recombinant CFTR protein to intracellular cAMP and cGMP was investigated in A549 cells intranuclearly injected with a CFTR encoding plasmid (100 μg/ml) and monitored with the SPQ fluorescence assay. A549 cells were chosen because this cell line was previously demonstrated to lack endogenous CFTR protein (22Finkbeiner W.E. Carrier S.D. Teresi C.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1993; 9: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Under base-line conditions, cells injected with plasmids alone or containing the CFTR expression cassette exhibited a low permeability to halide (Fig.2 A and Fig.3, left panel). Cells expressing CFTR but not cells injected with the plasmid lacking the insert displayed a ≈6-fold increase in the rate of SPQ dequenching upon application of the cAMP-stimulating mixture (Fig. 2 Aand Fig. 3, left panel). Similarly, in cells expressing CFTR, the rate of SPQ dequenching was increased approximately 3-fold by preincubation with 500 μm CPT-cGMP (Fig. 2, Band C). As shown in Fig. 2 C, the effect of cGMP stimulation was partially reversible upon CPT-cGMP washout. From this first set of experiments, we concluded that recombinant CFTR proteins produced by intranuclear injection of CFTR plasmid were sensitive to stimulation through both the cAMP- and cGMP-dependent pathways. In a second set of experiments, various cell lines co-expressing either recombinant or endogenous CFTR and recombinant β3-adrenoceptors were investigated. In A549 cells injected with β3-adrenoceptor isoform A alone, the base-line membrane permeability to halide was not different from cells injected with the plasmid lacking the insert (Fig. 3, left panel) either in the absence or presence of cAMP. Surprisingly, cells co-injected with CFTR plus the A or the C isoform of β3-adrenoceptor exhibited an 8–10-fold increase inp base line that was not further increased upon cAMP stimulation (Fig. 3, left panel). To ensure that this effect was related to β3-adrenoceptor expression, cells were co-injected with CFTR cDNA and with a cDNA encoding a K+ channel (ROMK2). In these cells,p base line was similar to that in control cells and markedly increased in response to cAMP elevation. In cells expressing the mutated ΔF508-CFTR protein, there was no increase inp base line related to co-expression with β3-adrenoceptor A or C isoforms. As expected, ΔF508-CFTR proteins were not sensitive to cAMP even in the presence of the β3-adrenoceptor (Fig. 3, left panel). Similar results were also obtained in COS-7 cells injected (not illustrated) or transfected (Fig. 3, middle panel) with CFTR and β3-adrenoceptor plasmids. In transfected COS-7 cells,p base line increased about 3-fold in cells co-expressing CFTR and either the A or C isoform of β3-adrenoceptor. This effect was not observed in cells expressing CFTR or β3-adrenoceptor alone. In COS-7 cells co-transfected with CFTR and the A or C isoform of β3-adrenoceptor, cAMP stimulation produced a small albeit significant increase in halide permeability (Fig. 3, middle panel). T84 cells endogenously express the CFTR protein (23Tabcharani J.A. Low W. Elie D. Hanrahan J.W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Again, T84 cells injected with the A isoform of β3-adrenoceptor cDNA exhibited a 2-fold increase inp base line as compared with noninjected cells (Fig. 3, right panel). This set of experiments shows that recombinant β3-adrenoceptor activates both endogenous and recombinant CFTR irrespectively to the transfection method used. Patch-clamp experiments were performed in cells co-expressing β3-adrenoceptor and CFTR to further characterize the halide conductance responsible for the increased membrane permeability. A549 cells co-expressing CFTR and the A isoform of β3-adrenoceptor displayed a high amplitude time-independent Cl− current in the absence of cAMP stimulation (Fig. 4). This Cl− current possessed characteristics reminiscent to the CFTR Cl− current recorded under cAMP stimulation in cells expressing CFTR alone. On average, in the absence of cAMP stimulation, the current amplitude at +60 mV was 25.2 ± 5.4 pA/pF (n = 12) in cells injected with CFTR plus β3-adrenoceptor but only 8.1 ± 3.1 pA/pF (n = 11) in cells injected with CFTR alone (p < 0.05). These results confirmed that the increase in p base line in cells co-expressing CFTR and β3-adrenoceptors was related to the activation of CFTR chloride current in the absence of cAMP stimulation. To modulate the effects of β3-adrenoceptor on CFTR activity, the levels of expression of CFTR and β3-adrenoceptor were varied independently. In A549 cells, varying the level of CFTR expression in the absence of β3-adrenoceptor expression did not modify the base-line permeability to halide (Fig.5, left panel). In contrast, in the presence of a constant expression level of β3-adrenoceptor isoform A (100 μg/ml),p base line increased as the CFTR plasmid concentration in the injected medium increased from 3 to 100 μg/ml (Fig. 5, right panel). In another set of experiments, we varied the injected concentration of β3-adrenoceptor isoform A plasmid from 0.03 to 3 μg/ml in the presence of a constant CFTR concentration (30 μg/ml). In these cells, β3-adrenoceptors were selectively activated using 10 μm isoproterenol, a nonselective β-adrenoceptor agonist, in the presence of 10 μm nadolol, a β1- and β2-adrenoceptor antagonist (24Lee R.J. Evans D.B. Baky S.H. Laffan R.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1975; 33: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that cells expressing CFTR alone were not responsive to isoproterenol in the presence of nadolol (data not shown), suggesting that A549 cells lack endogenous β3-adrenoceptors. As the expression level of β3-adrenoceptor isoform A was increased, p base line increased, the effects of β3-adrenoceptor stimulation with isoproterenol plus nadolol were progressively reduced, and the effects of the cAMP-activating mixture were also reduced (Fig.6). So, at a low injected β3-adrenoceptor cDNA concentration (i.e.0.1 μg/ml), the base-line halide permeability was not different from control cells but increased 3–4-fold upon β3-adrenoceptor stimulation. Inversely, at the highest injected β3-adrenoceptor cDNA concentration (i.e. 3 μg/ml), the increase inp base line was such that the effects of β3-adrenoceptor stimulation or direct cAMP elevation were abolished. To further assess the CFTR regulation by β3-adrenoceptor stimulation, we tested a full β3-adrenoceptor agonist, SR 58611, and a partial β3-adrenoceptor agonist that possesses also β1- and β2-adrenoceptor antagonistic properties, CGP 12177 (25Blin N. Camoin L. Maigret B. Strosberg A.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1094-1104PubMed Google Scholar). In cells co-expressing CFTR (30 μg/ml) and a low level of β3-adrenoceptor isoform A (0.1 μg/ml), a 15-min application of SR 58611 (1 μm) or CGP 12177 (1 μm) increased p values 2- or 3-fold, respectively (Fig. 7,middle and right panels). This effect was not observed in cells expressing CFTR alone. We concluded that the effects produced by β3-adrenoceptor expression on the CFTR protein depend on the expression level of the β3-adrenoceptors: (i) at a low level of β3-adrenoceptor expression, the CFTR channels remained in the close state and were sensitive to β3-adrenoceptor pharmacological stimulation and (ii) at a high level of β3-adrenoceptor expression, CFTR channels were permanently activated and lost their sensitivity to either β3-adrenoceptor agonists or direct cAMP stimulation. In an attempt to determine whether the PKA activation was involved in CFTR regulation by β3-adrenoceptor stimulation, A549 cells were incubated for 20 min with a mixture of two PKA inhibitors, Rp-8-Br-cAMPS (100 μm) and Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS (100 μm). Rp-8-Br-cAMPS and Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS are specific for PKA type I and II, respectively (26Gjertsen B.T. Mellgren G. Otten A. Maronde E. Genieser H.-G. Jastorff B. Vintermyr O.K. McKnight G.S. Døskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20599-20607Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). PKA-dependent CFTR stimulation by isoproterenol (for review see Ref. 27Böhm M. Flesch M. Schnabel P. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was used as a control experiment to check efficient PKA inhibition under our experimental conditions. In A549 cells injected with CFTR cDNA alone, isoproterenol, through a β1- and/or β2-adrenoceptor stimulation, increased the p value 3-fold (Fig. 7, left panel). After incubation with PKA inhibitors, this effect was abolished (Fig. 7, left panel). In contrast, in cells co-expressing CFTR and β3-adrenoceptor, pre-treatment with PKA inhibitors had no effects on CFTR activation by β3-adrenoceptor agonists (SR 58611 or CGP 12177; Fig. 7,middle and right panels). These results demonstrated that the regulation of CFTR conductance by β3-adrenoceptor stimulation was independent from the PKA pathway. In another set of experiments, we determined whether the basal activation of CFTR by a high level β3-adrenoceptor expression was dependent on an increase in intracellular cyclic nucleotides. To test this hypothesis, intracellular cAMP and cGMP levels were measured in COS-7"

By using the technique of isothermal titration calorimetry, we have studied the thermodynamics of binding of the Shc and IRS-1 PTB domains to tyrosine-phosphorylated NPXY-containing peptides derived from known receptor binding sites. The results showed that relative contributions of enthalpy and entropy to the free energy of binding are dependent on specific phosphopeptides. Binding of the Shc PTB domain to tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides from TrkA, epidermal growth factor, ErbB3, and insulin receptors is achieved via an overall entropy-driven reaction. On the other hand, recognition of the phosphopeptides of insulin and interleukin-4 receptors by the IRS-1 PTB domain is predominantly an enthalpy-driven process. Mutagenesis and amino acid substitution experiments showed that in addition to the tyrosine-phosphorylated NPXY motif, the PTB domains of Shc and IRS-1 prefer a large hydrophobic residue at pY-5 and a small hydrophobic residue at pY-1, respectively (where pY is phosphotyrosine). These results agree with the calculated solvent accessibility of these two key peptide residues in the PTB domain/peptide structures and support the notion that the PTB domains of Shc and IRS-1 employ functionally distinct mechanisms to recognize tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors.

Protein tyrosine phosphorylation provides a central control mechanism in regulating protein-protein interactions and activation of enzymes in mitogenic signal transduction following activation of cytokine and growth factor receptors (1Hunter T.

Key events in receptor signaling are the interactions of signaling molecules such as adaptor protein Shc and insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1) 1The abbreviations used are: IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate 1; IR, insulin receptor; IL-4R, interleukin-4 receptor; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; pY, phosphotyrosine; PTB, phosphotyrosine binding; SASA, solvent-accessible surface area; SH2 Src homology-2, Fmoc,N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; EGF, epidermal growth factor; PH, pleckstrin homology. with activated and tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors. Binding to the activated receptor results in tyrosine phosphorylation of these signaling molecules, which in turn experience specific interactions with downstream signaling proteins and/or enzymes. For example, in insulin receptor (IR) signaling, upon binding to the activated receptor, IRS-1 is phosphorylated on many tyrosine residues, which enables IRS-1 to interact with various Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing proteins, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein tyrosine phosphatase SH-PTP2, and Grb2 (3Sun X.J. Crimmins D.L. Myers M.G.J. Miralpeix M. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7418-7428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc interacts with the SH2 domain of the adaptor protein Grb2, which in turn binds via its Src homology 3 (SH3) domains to the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, SOS, leading to Ras activation (4Salcini A.

Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Both IRS-1 and Shc can bind to the activated and tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor through their phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain (also called PID or SAIN domain) (6Gustafson T.A. He W.

PTB domains that are structurally and functionally distinct from SH2 domains recognize amino acid residues N-terminal (rather than C-terminal) to the phosphotyrosine (pY) (2Pawson T.

In particular, PTB domains preferentially bind to phosphorylated proteins at sites containing a NPXpY motif and hydrophobic amino acids N-terminal to this sequence (12Trüb T. Cho W.E. Wolf G.

Different PTB domains exhibit distinct selectivity for residues N-terminal to the NPXpY-motif. For example, the IRS-1 PTB domain favors hydrophobic residues at the pY-6 and pY-8 positions and an Ala at pY-1 for high affinity binding (15Wolf G. Trüb T. Ottinger E. Groninga L. Lynch A.

Recent structural analysis revealed that the two PTB domains are structurally related but employ two very different mechanisms for recognizing the phosphotyrosine and the hydrophobic residues N-terminal to the NPXpY sequence (17Zhou M.-M.

For example, the Shc PTB domain binds to activated and tyrosine-phosphorylated TrkA, ErbB2, ErbB3, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors (20Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J.

Studies of thermodynamics of protein-ligand interactions can provide important insights into the structural and functional relationships of molecular recognition of the system. In an effort to determine further the structural and dynamic basis of functional differences in the molecular mechanisms by which the Shc and IRS-1 PTB domains recognize tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides, we have studied thermodynamics of peptide binding of the PTB domains using the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) technique. The phosphopeptides used in this study were derived from known Shc- and IRS-1-binding sites on growth factor and cytokine receptors. Results from these studies revealed that the PTB domains of Shc and IRS-1 appear to bind in a thermodynamically distinct manner to the NPXpY-containing peptides. The components of the free energy of the interactions show that the high affinity binding of the Shc PTB domain to the phosphopeptides is an overall entropy-driven process. In contrast, recognition of the IRS-1 PTB domain to the IR and IL-4R phosphopeptides is achieved predominantly by a large enthalpy contribution. By using site-directed mutagenesis and amino acid substitution, we have further quantified the relative contribution of the pY-5 and pY-1 residues in phosphopeptide binding to the PTB domains. The PTB domain of Shc (residues 17–207) was cloned, expressed, and purified using procedures as described previously (17Zhou M.-M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.T. Petros A.P. Meadows R.P.

Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31119-31123Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pET15b (Novagen), which introduces a His tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site at the N terminus of the recombinant protein. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells, which were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyanoside for 4 h at 37 °C. The His-tagged protein was purified by affinity chromatography on a nickel-NTA column (Qiagen) and was treated with thrombin to remove the His tag. The PTB domain of IRS-1 used in this study consists of residues 157–267 of the full-length protein. A slightly larger protein (residues 157–278) was subcloned into pET30b plasmid (Novagen) and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3pLysS) cells with an additional Leu-Glu-(His)6 sequence at the C terminus as described previously (18Zhou M.-M. Huang B. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Shuker S.B. Miyazak M. Trüb T. Shoelson S.E. Fesik S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The cells were grown overnight in LB media, and the expression of the protein was induced using 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyanoside at 25 °C for 6 h. The cells were then disrupted using a French press. The His-tagged protein was purified by a nickel-NTA column. Subsequent cleavage of this protein with thrombin at a natural cleavage site (267–268) removed the C-terminal His-tag and the extra amino acids to give the PTB domain of IRS-1 (residues 157–267). The IRS-1 PTB mutant Met- 257 → Ala was prepared as described previously, using the Chameleon Double-Stranded, Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA), and the template plasmid used in the mutagenesis was pET30b-IRS1 (18Zhou M.-M. Huang B. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Shuker S.B. Miyazak M. Trüb T. Shoelson S.E. Fesik S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of the mutant IRS-1 PTB domain was accomplished as described for the wild-type protein. The tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides used in the experiments reported here were synthesized by the Protein Core Facility at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, using an Fmoc-based strategy. Phosphotyrosine was incorporated using the reagent Fmoc-Tyr(PO3H2) with HBTU/HOAt activation. Analysis of the purified peptides by analytical high pressure liquid chromatography demonstrated homogeneity. Calorimetric measurements were performed with an Omega instrument (Microcal, Northampton, MA) (26Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out at 25 °C in a 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer of pH 8.0 containing 200 mm NaCl, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm EDTA. This condition was optimal for protein stability of the PTB domains of Shc and IRS-1, as there was no sign of significant protein aggregation for up to 0.5–1 mm protein concentration as determined by NMR spectroscopy. Both the PTB domains and the phosphopeptides were dissolved in the same buffer. The concentrations of protein and phosphopeptide were typically of 30–300 μm and 1–2 mm, respectively. To optimize the ITC measurements, the c value (c = [PTB domain]/K D) was controlled in the range of 10–200 for all the ITC experiments, except for the weak binding of the IRS-1 PTB domain to the phosphopeptides of IR-pY960 (K D = 87.07 ± 3.84 μm) and TrkA-pY490 (K D = 678 ± 96.53 μm) (Table I).Table IThermodynamic parameters obtained for binding of the Shc PTB domain to NPXpY-containing phosphopeptides at pH 8.0 and 25 °CProtein pY sitespY peptidesK DΔHTΔSΔGμmkcal mol−1kcal mol−1kcal mol−1TrkA, pY490HIIENPQpYFSDA0.19 ± 0.013.63 ± 0.1112.75 ± 0.15−9.12 ± 0.03hEGFR, pY1148SLDNPDpYQQDFF1.69 ± 0.15−2.82 ± 0.085.02 ± 0.11−7.84 ± 0.05hErbB3, pY1309SAFDNPDpYWHSRLF0.33 ± 0.04−2.54 ± 0.086.27 ± 0.13−8.81 ± 0.08IR, pY960LYASSNPEpYLS4.22 ± 0.902.54 ± 0.299.85 ± 0.16−7.31 ± 0.14IL-4R, pY497LVIAGNPApYRS12.25 ± 5.220.87 ± 0.147.58 ± 0.15−6.71 ± 0.28TrkA A-5, pY490HIAENPQpYFSDA0.70 ± 0.172.78 ± 0.1411.16 ± 0.10−8.38 ± 0.14The experimental conditions of the ITC measurements were described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” Three ITC experiments were conducted for each phosphopeptide at slightly different protein concentrations.

Each titration experiment consisted of 25 10-μl injections of a peptide into the calorimetric cell containing 1.34 ml of a protein solution. A 250-s period was allowed between each injection, and there was an initial 60-s delay at the start of the experiment. Reaction enthalpies were also measured for injection of buffer into the protein and the phosphopeptide into the buffer. In each case, the measured enthalpies were found to be negligible compared with the enthalpy of the binding of the phosphopeptide to the PTB domains. The mean of the enthalpy of injection of buffer into the protein was subtracted from raw titration data prior to curve fitting. The peptide concentration was determined gravimetrically, whereas the protein concentration was measured using the Lowry method. Titration curves were fit to an in-built function by a non-linear least squares method using the ORIGIN software (Microcal, Northampton, MA). This function is based upon the binding of a ligand to a macromolecule (26Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar) and contains n(reaction stoichiometry), K D (dissociation constant), and ΔH (reaction enthalpy) as the variable parameters. These parameters can thus be directly determined from curve fitting. From the values of K D and ΔH, the free energy (ΔG) and entropy change (ΔS) upon peptide binding can be calculated using the relationship: −RT ln(1/K D) = ΔG = ΔH − TΔS, where Ris the universal molar gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. All NMR spectra were acquired at 30 °C on a Bruker DRX-500 NMR spectrometer. Uniformly 15N-labeled proteins of the IRS-1 PTB domain were prepared for the NMR experiments by growing bacteria that overexpress the PTB domain in an M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source. The NMR samples of wild-type and the Met-257 → Ala mutant of the IRS-1 PTB domain were prepared at a concentration of 0.5 mm in 50 mm Tris-d 11/HCl buffer of pH 6.5, containing 50 mm NaCl and 5 mm dithiothreitol-d 10 in 90% H2O, 10% 2H2O. Two-dimensional1H/15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra were acquired with 96 and 1024 complex points in ω1 and ω2, respectively. The NMR spectra were processed and analyzed using the NMRPipe (27Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

We used the same TrkA receptor peptide (HIIENPQpYFSDA) in the isothermal titration calorimetry studies as the one used in our recent structural analysis of the Shc PTB domain-TrkA phosphopeptide complex by NMR (17Zhou M.-M.

The parameters include binding affinity, binding stoichiometry, enthalpy of binding (ΔH), and free energy change (ΔG) by a nonlinear fit of the binding isotherm, as well as entropy of binding (ΔS) from a difference between the free-energy change and the enthalpy of binding. A representative calorimetric isotherm and the corresponding titration curve of the Shc PTB domain binding to the TrkA peptide (Fig. 1 A) show that a heat absorbance is associated with the peptide binding, indicating that the interaction is endothermic at 25 °C (ΔH = 3.63 kcal/mol). The heat absorbance upon addition of the phosphopeptide to the protein solution underwent a sharp change at 1:1 molar ratio of the protein to peptide, suggesting that the Shc PTB domain binding to the TrkA peptide is very tight, and the stoichiometry of this interaction is 1:1. By using these ITC data, we calculated a dissociation constant (K D) to be 190 nm (Table I). Furthermore, the thermodynamic titration data revealed that the high affinity binding of the Shc PTB domain to the TrkA peptide is achieved by an overall entropy-driven process as the free energy of binding (ΔG = −9.12 kcal/mol) results predominantly from a large favorable entropic contribution (TΔS= 12.75 kcal/mol).Figure 1Isothermal titration calorimetric data for binding of the Shc PTB domain to TrkA-pY490 (A) and the IRS-1 PTB domain to tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides of IL4R-pY497 (B), IR-pY960 (C), and IR(A-1)-pY960 (D). The solid lines show the fit of the data to a function based on the binding of a ligand to a macromolecule using the software ORIGIN (26Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal.

The results indicated that while the enthalpy of binding (either exothermic or endothermic reaction) is phosphopeptide-specific, change of entropy (TΔS) always favors the binding. Moreover, this large favorable entropic contribution appears to be the major determinant for the high affinity of the Shc PTB domain binding to the phosphopeptides. This observation is consistent not only with the phosphopeptides that contain the consensus sequence of ΨXNPXpY (where Ψ pY-5 is a hydrophobic residue) known for the high affinity binding to the Shc PTB domain but also with the IR phosphopeptide that contains large hydrophobic residues at pY-6 to pY-8 instead of pY-5. To study further the thermodynamics of the PTB domain of Shc binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides, we conducted ITC measurements using a phosphopeptide derived from IL-4 receptor (pY497). This IL-4R phosphopeptide is not a biological ligand for the Shc PTB domain as Shc has not been linked to IL-4R signaling. On the other hand, the IL-4R peptide represents a biologically relevant binding site for the IRS-1 PTB domain (23Wang L.M. Myers M.G.J. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M. Pierce J.H.

Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The ITC results showed that the PTB domain of Shc binds to the IL-4R peptide much weaker than to those phosphopeptides from the known Shc binding sites (Table I). Interestingly, the Shc binding of the IL-4R peptide is also dictated by a large favorable entropic contribution. Taken together, our ITC results suggest that under the conditions of our study, binding of the Shc PTB domain to the NPXpY-containing phosphopeptides of the TrkA, EGF, ErbB3, and insulin receptors appears to be an overall entropy-driven process. We performed an ITC titration using a phosphopeptide from the IL-4R (pY497) (LVIAGNPApYRS) which is a known binding site for IRS-1 (23Wang L.M. Myers M.G.J. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M.

Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, binding of the IRS-1 PTB domain to the IL-4R peptide (see Table II) is exothermic (ΔH = −9.43 kcal/mol) and involves an unfavorable change of entropy (TΔS = −1.63 kcal/mol). Curve fitting of the ITC data gave a dissociation constant K D of 1.82 μm for this PTB domain-peptide complex. Thus, the IL-4R peptide interaction with the IRS-1 PTB domain is enthalpy-driven, which is in sharp contrast to the entropy-driven binding of the Shc PTB domain.Table IIThermodynamic parameters obtained for binding of the IRS-1 PTB domain to NPXpY-containing phosphopeptides at pH 8.0 and 25 °CProtein pY sitespY peptidesK DΔHTΔSΔGμmkcal mol−1kcal mol−1kcal mol−1IL-4R, pY497LVIAGNPApYRS1.82 ± 0.11−9.43 ± 0.15−1.63 ± 0.17−7.80 ± 0.04IR, pY960LYASSNPEpYLS87.07 ± 3.84−10.74 ± 0.30−5.22 ± 0.33−5.52 ± 0.03IR (A-1), pY960LYASSNP A pYLS2.32 ± 0.25−10.85 ± 0.09−3.19 ± 0.15−7.66 ± 0.07IR (I-1), pY960LYASSNP I pYLS8.40 ± 1.14−5.91 ± 0.110.99 ± 0.18−6.90 ± 0.08IR (F-1), pY960LYASSNP F pYLS6.64 ± 0.27−5.35 ± 0.071.69 ± 0.09−7.04 ± 0.03IR (A-1), Y960LYASSNPAYLS∼0aThese thermodynamic parameters cannot be determined since the measured signal (ΔH) is observed to be zero.TrkA, pY490HIIENPQpYFSDA678.02 ± 96.53−9.65 ± 0.76−5.34 ± 0.85−4.31 ± 0.08hEGFR, pY1148SLDNPDpYQQDFF∼0aThese thermodynamic parameters cannot be determined since the measured signal (ΔH) is observed to be zero.hErbB3, pY1309SAFDNPDpYWHSRLF∼0aThese thermodynamic parameters cannot be determined since the measured signal (ΔH) is observed to be zero.IRS-1 PTB-M257AIL-4R, pY497LVIAGNPApYRS24.64 ± 2.21−8.36 ± 0.37−2.10 ± 0.42−6.26 ± 0.06IR (A-1), pY960LYASSNP A pYLS21.98 ± 0.22−7.58 ± 0.08−1.25 ± 0.07−6.33 ± 0.02The experimental conditions of the ITC measurements were described in detail under “Experimental Procedures” and Table I.

Errors quoted for K D and ΔH are standard deviations from the three ITC experiments, whereas errors onTΔS and ΔG are propagated errors. Binding of the IRS-1 PTB domain to the IR-pY960 peptide (LYASSNPEpYLS) also appears to be governed mainly by an enthalpy contribution (ΔH = −10.74 kcal/mol andTΔS = −5.22 kcal/mol). However, binding affinity of the IR-pY960 peptide to the IRS-1 PTB domain (K D = 87.07 μm) is ∼50-fold weaker than that of the IL4R-pY497 peptide (K D = 1.82 μm) (Fig. 1 C, Table II). This marked reduction of the peptide binding affinity correlates with an increased entropy penalty. The major difference in amino acid sequence between the IL-4R and IR phosphopeptides is the residue at pY-1. To determine the contribution of the pY-1 residue to binding of the IRS-1 PTB domain, we substituted the Glu pY-1 in the IR-pY960 peptide by an Ala. The latter amino acid corresponds to the Ala pY-1 in the IL-4R phosphopeptide. The ITC measurements showed that this single amino acid substitution led to a 38-fold increase of the binding affinity to 2.32 μm (Fig.1 D and Table II), which is nearly the same as that of the IL-4R peptide binding to the IRS-1 PTB domain (K D = 1.82 μm).

Each member of this family has two conserved nucleotide binding domains. The binding protein-dependent maltose transport complex (MTC) ofE. coli comprises four protein subunits (3Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8946-8951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One copy each of MalF and MalG probably form a channel in the cytoplasmic membrane through which maltose passes. Two copies of the peripheral membrane ATP-binding protein MalK are associated with MalF and MalG. The hydrolysis of ATP by MalK is presumed to energize the process of sugar transport. Additionally, MalK plays a role in the regulation of maltose transport through two distinct pathways. MalK regulates the expression of mal genes through an unknown mechanism that is dependent on the mal transcriptional activator MalT (4Reyes M. Shuman H.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4598-4602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MalK also interacts with unphosphorylated enzyme IIAglc(EIIAglc) of the phosphenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system, which lowers the activity of the MTC and decreases maltose transport (5Dean D.A. Reizer J. Nikaido H. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21005-21010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies of the MTC have provided evidence that the two copies of MalK interact functionally within the complex. It has been shown that the MTC hydrolyzes ATP with positive cooperativity (6Davidson A.L. Laghaeian S.S. Mannering D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4858-4863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and the mutation of the ATP-binding site in a single MalK subunit in the MTC severely impairs transport (7Davidson A.L. Sharma S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5458-5464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We are characterizing the in vivo tetramerization of the Mal proteins as a model for membrane protein assembly. In this paper, we provide biochemical evidence that MalK forms a dimer in the absence of the MalF and MalG proteins. We have utilized several MalK mutants carrying transposon-mediated in-frame epitope insertions that were previously characterized for their ability to assemble into the complex and transport maltose (8Lippincott J. Traxler B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1337-1343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dimerization of several of the mutant proteins with wild-type MalK was shown using coimmunoprecipitation techniques. Furthermore, the oligomerization of MalK was confirmedin vivo using the λ repressor fusion assay (9Hu J.C. O'Shea E.K. Kim P.S. Sauer R.T. Science. 1990; 250: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The dimerization of MalK may represent an initial step in the assembly of the maltose transport complex. The bacterial strains and plasmids that were used in this study are listed in TableI. Plasmid preparation, cloning, and transformation were carried out as described previously (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To make plasmid constructs for co-immunoprecipitation, DNA fragments containingmalK insertion mutants with the IPTG-inducibletrc promoter and lacI q from pTrc99A-based plasmids were subcloned into pAYC184 usingSphI and HindIII. To make the λ repressorcI-malK fusion, polymerase chain reaction-amplified wild-type malK gene was subcloned into pJH391 digested withSalI and BamHI. This construct, pKK700, produces a protein consisting of the N-terminal 132 amino acids of the cI repressor fused to the N terminus of MalK.Table IBacterial strains, plasmids, and phage used in this studyStrain, plasmid, or phageRelevant genotypeSource or referenceStrainsBT6MC1000 ΔmalB101 zjb::Tn5 (ΔmalE,F,G,K,lamB,malM)Laboratory collectionBT8MC4100malT(Con)12Traxler B.

Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Minimal media were supplemented with thiamine and all of the amino acids except cysteine and methionine and with glycerol at 0.2%. Antibiotics were used at final concentrations of 100 μg/ml for ampicillin and 30 μg/ml for chloramphenicol. Strains were grown in supplemented M63 minimal medium at 37 °C with aeration to an A 600 of 0.3. Strains were induced with 1 mm IPTG for 5 or 15 min and then 1 ml of culture was labeled by the addition of 120 μCi of [35S]methionine for 10 min. Labeling was stopped by the addition of 0.05% cold methionine, and the cultures were immediately placed on ice. Cells were washed one time with and then resuspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA (Buffer A). The resuspended cells were lysed with two 15-s bursts of a probe sonicator. Lysates were aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. The coimmunoprecipitation procedure was adapted from a method described by Davidson and Nikaido (3Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8946-8951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were solubilized with 1% dodecyl maltoside for 20 min on ice. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. This insoluble fraction (Fig. 1 A, lane 2) likely represents a mixture of unbroken cells, insoluble protein, and residual soluble material after removal of the soluble extract. The remaining soluble extracts were diluted 1:10 in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.01% dodecyl maltoside (Buffer B). The insertion-specific antiserum was added and incubated on ice for 1–2 h or overnight. To isolate immune complexes, 25 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in Buffer B was added to the extracts and incubated on ice for 30 min, with mixing every 5 min. The protein A-Sepharose beads were sedimented in a microcentrifuge and washed three times with 0.5 ml of Buffer B. The beads were heated to 65 °C for 20 min in 25 μl of gel loading buffer before the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels. The procedure to immunoprecipitate epitope-tagged MalK alone was adapted from a procedure used by Traxler and Beckwith (12Traxler B. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10852-10856Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were solubilized with 2% SDS followed by heating at 65 °C for 20 min. This extract was then diluted 1:17 in Buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2% Triton X-100) and centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge to remove insoluble material. Insertion-specific antiserum was added to the soluble extract and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were isolated as described above except that Buffer C was used for washing the protein A-Sepharose beads. Phosphorimages were scanned using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager SF, and the data were analyzed with the Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant software, version 3.1. Mutant and wild-type MalK species were readily detected and quantitated in the induced whole cell extracts (Fig. 1 A). These quantitations were corrected for background labeled cellular proteins. Strains, vector plasmids, and λKH54 were provided in the strain kit for repressor fusions courtesy of Jim Hu. The cI-malK fusion construct in strain KTK51 produces a protein that is approximately 12 kDa larger than MalK as detected by Western analysis using a MalK-specific antiserum provided by Howard Shuman (data not shown). The level of the cI repressor-MalK fusion in uninduced KTK51 was lower than that of MalK expressed from the normal chromosomal locus in BT8. These strains were then tested for immunity to bacteriophage λ by cross-streak analysis without IPTG. Cultures of BT8 transformed with the pLK plasmids were grown with aeration at 37 °C in supplemented M63. During the final 2 h of growth before labeling, 1 mm IPTG was added to induce expression of the malK mutations, and 2 mm cAMP was added for the last 5 min. Cells were pulse-labeled for 30 s with 40–50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and then mixed with 0.05% cold methionine for 10 min of continued incubation. After labeling, cells were converted to spheroplasts as described previously (12Traxler B. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10852-10856Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Proteolysis was done on 0.5-ml portions of spheroplasts for 20 min at 0 °C with 25 μg/ml trypsin and stopped as described previously (12Traxler B. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10852-10856Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After proteolysis, spheroplasts were harvested and resuspended in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 2% SDS, 1 mmEDTA, and heated to 65 °C for 20 min. These samples were diluted 1:17 in Buffer C. MalF protein was immunoprecipitated with a specific antiserum, using the previously described method (12Traxler B. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10852-10856Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and results were analyzed after SDS-PAGE on 12.5% resolving gels. Results presented are an average of 2–4 experiments. All samples were checked for integrity of spheroplasts during proteolysis by SDS-PAGE of extracts prior to immunoprecipitation (data not shown). General chemicals and media supplies were purchased from Difco, Fisher Scientific, and Sigma. IPTG was purchased from Bachem. Maltose was bought from Pfanstiehl. Lysozyme, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and cAMP were from Sigma, and trypsin was from Worthington. Prestained protein molecular weight markers and acrylamide were obtained from Bio-Rad. Soybean trypsin inhibitor, SDS, and n-dodecylmaltoside were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. [35S]Methionine was purchased from NEN Life Science Products (EXPRE35S35S label). The oligomeric state of MalK was analyzed in extracts prepared from E. colistrains (containing a chromosomal deletion of the malFGKregion) producing both wild-type and epitope-tagged MalK species. MalK550 contains an in-frame insertion of 31 mostly hydrophilic amino acids, retains MalK functions, and is recognized by a polyclonal antiserum specific for the insertion (8Lippincott J. Traxler B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1337-1343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Manoil C. Bailey J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 250-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cells expressing bothmalK550 and malK +, each from a plasmid under the control of the trc promoter, were induced briefly with IPTG, labeled with [35S]methionine, and sonicated. Based on the observation that MalFGK2 tetramers are stable in dodecyl maltoside (3Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8946-8951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these extracts were solubilized with this nonionic detergent. Although previous studies have demonstrated that MalK tends to form inclusion bodies when highly expressed in E. coli (4Reyes M. Shuman H.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4598-4602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Walter C. Honer zu Bentrup K. Schneider E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8863-8869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), more than 90% of the MalK species in our extracts was present in the soluble fraction (Fig.1 A), likely due to the short induction time used. These solubilized extracts were used for coimmunoprecipitation studies. The soluble fractions were incubated with the insertion-specific antiserum. Under these conditions, both MalK550 and wild-type MalK were immunoprecipitated from strains expressing both proteins (Fig.1 B, lane 1). MalK550 was easily distinguished from wild-type MalK due to its reduced electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE gels. Only MalK550 was immunoprecipitated from a strain expressing MalK550 alone, and no proteins were immunoprecipitated from a strain expressing only wild-type MalK (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and 3). These results show that wild-type MalK is associated with MalK550 in these solubilized whole cell extracts. Similar results were obtained with a related MalK insertion mutant, MalK556, which has similar phenotypes to MalK550 (data not shown). Immunoprecipitations also were carried out on extracts solubilized with 2% SDS and diluted in 2% Triton X-100. Only MalK550 was recovered in these reactions (Fig. 1 C), showing that the interaction between MalK species can be disrupted by denaturation in ionic detergent and that the antiserum is specific for MalK550. The heteromeric complex also does not reform in vitro after denaturation and partial renaturation. In order to show that the observed MalK-MalK550 oligomer is due to specific interaction rather than nonspecific aggregation during sample preparation, the procedure was carried out using an equivalent amount of an irrelevant affinity purified antiserum, anti-human Hck (N-30) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and using protein A-Sepharose beads alone (Fig. 1 D, lanes 2and 3). The hetero-oligomeric complex was recovered only in the immunoprecipitation containing the insertion-specific antiserum (Fig. 1 D, lane 1). The immunoprecipitation also was carried out with extracts solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 instead of dodecyl maltoside. Again, we observed more than 90% of MalK species in the soluble fraction and the coimmunoprecipitation of the hetero-oligomeric complex (data not shown), indicating that the solubility of MalK and its oligomeric association are maintained in both nonionic detergents. In order to determine the oligomeric state of MalK, the amount of immunoprecipitated MalK550 and wild-type MalK was quantitated and analyzed using an equation describing the distribution of random pairs. If MalK is a dimer, cells expressing a mixture of MalK550 and wild-type MalK would contain three species of dimer: MalK550 homodimer, wild-type MalK homodimer, and MalK550/wild-type MalK heterodimer. The insertion-specific antiserum would immunoprecipitate MalK550 homodimers and MalK550/wild-type MalK heterodimers only. Assuming random mixing of MalK550 and wild-type MalK molecules, the distribution of heterodimer and both homodimers in the extract is described by the binomial expansionp 2 + 2pq + q 2= 1, where p and q represent the proportions of MalK550 and wild-type MalK, respectively. The pq term represents the proportion of heterodimer, and p 2and q 2 represent the proportion of each homodimer. Using this equation, the relative amounts of each molecule immunoprecipitated by the insertion-specific antiserum can be predicted based on the relative amounts of MalK550 and wild-type MalK present in the whole cell extracts. These amounts were determined, and the above equation was used to predict the relative amounts of MalK550 and wild-type MalK that should be immunoprecipitated (TableII). Similar binomial expansions were used to predict the relative proportions that would be present in the immunoprecipitations if the oligomer was a trimer or a tetramer. The relative amounts of the two MalK species actually present in the immunoprecipitations were found to agree with values predicted for a dimeric species (two independent analyses are shown). This suggests that MalK550 and wild-type MalK molecules are present in the extract as randomly associated dimers.Table IIImmunoprecipitation of a MalK dimerMalK speciesaMalK molecules present in whole cell extracts.

Open table in a new tab In separate studies, the ratio of the relative proportions of MalK550 and wild-type MalK that were expressed in the cells was altered by switching the vectors carrying the malK alleles. In these experiments, the ratio of MalK550 to wild-type MalK in whole cell extracts was 4:1, in contrast to ratios close to 3:7 in the experiments above. Again, wild-type MalK coimmunoprecipitated with MalK550 using the insertion-specific antiserum. Consistent with the prediction of the binomial expansion, the amount of wild-type MalK recovered was substantially smaller than in the above experiments and close to that expected for dimers. However, the difference between the predicted ratios for dimers, trimers and tetramers is not significant due to the small population of wild-type MalK (data not shown). In order to assay for the association and dissociation of MalK in vitro, sonicated whole cell extracts were prepared from two different strains expressing either MalK550 or wild-type MalK. These extracts were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for various times and then were solubilized with dodecyl maltoside and immunoprecipitated as before, using the insertion-specific antiserum. A small amount of hetero-oligomer was recovered (Fig. 2). The proportion of wild-type MalK relative to MalK550 that was coimmunoprecipitated increased 47% over 1.5 h. The MalK oligomer can form in vitro from two separate populations of MalK molecules. To assay for MalK oligomerization in vivo, full-length malK was fused to the coding region for the N-terminal DNA binding domain of the bacteriophage λ cI repressor. A strain expressing this cI repressor-MalK fusion and various control strains were cross-streaked against λ. The ability of a fusion protein to confer immunity to λ indicates the formation of an active dimeric repressor protein (9Hu J.C. O'Shea E.K. Kim P.S. Sauer R.T. Science. 1990; 250: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Although the control strains were λ-sensitive, the cI repressor-MalK fusion protein (expressed from pKK700) conferred resistance to λ (Fig.3), providing additional evidence for the formation of MalK dimers in vivo. The cI-malKfusion plasmid restores a Mal+ phenotype to the ΔmalK strain HS3169 on maltose MacConkey plates, indicating that the fusion protein is functional for transport. There were no bands other than the cI repressor-MalK fusion protein visible on a Western blot developed with a MalK-specific antiserum (data not shown), indicating that the maltose transport function was conferred by the fusion protein and not by a MalK breakdown product. Previously, two other MalK insertion mutants, MalK552 and MalK554, were characterized, and both were found to be deficient in maltose transport and in MTC assembly (8Lippincott J. Traxler B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1337-1343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mutants were tested with the coimmunoprecipitation assay in order to determine whether their assembly defects are due to an inability to dimerize. MalK552 and MalK554 were each expressed with wild-type MalK and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the insertion-specific antiserum. Both assembly incompetent mutants form hetero-oligomers (Fig. 4). This result suggests that although both of these MalK mutants are unable to assemble into a functional transport complex, these phenotypes are not due to a dimerization defect. These mutants are dissimilar in that themalK552 gene is dominant to wild-type malK when expressed at high levels, whereas malK554 is recessive. It is likely that the behavior of these mutants is due to a difference in some other intermolecular interaction in the MTC assembly pathway. Therefore, we tested the different dominance phenotypes of thesemalK alleles in a biochemical assay that measures MalFGK2 assembly. We have described a protease sensitivity assay to measure the oligomerization of the MTC in vivo (12Traxler B. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10852-10856Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, the MalF component of the complex is initially inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane in a form that is sensitive to cleavage by trypsin in its periplasmic domains. If the protein assembles with both MalG and MalK, MalF becomes trypsin-resistant. We compared the abilities of the insertion mutant proteins expressed from the dominantmalK552 and the recessive malK554 mutations to compete with wild-type MalK for complex assembly in a Mal+strain with this assay. We found that although the MalK554 mutant did not inhibit the acquisition of protease resistance of MalF relative to the positive control (the assembly and transport proficient MalK556 insertion mutant), MalK552 had a strong inhibitory effect (TableIII). Although both of the assembly defective MalK insertion mutants apparently dimerize, the two mutants are different in their abilities to compete with wild-type MalK for MalFGK2 assembly. The difference in the genetic dominance of the mutations is revealed in the proteolysis assay.Table IIIMalK+/MalK mutant competition for MalFGK2 assemblyMal proteinsaMal proteins were expressed in derivatives of BT8 containing pLK plasmids (9).

Control cultures of these strains grown in the absence of IPTG (i.e. without significant expression of the MalK insertion mutants) show an average MalF protease resistance of 77%. Open table in a new tab We have shown that the MalK protein forms a dimer in the absence of the two integral membrane proteins, MalF and MalG, that are associated with MalK in the maltose transport complex in E. coli. A mixed oligomer of two distinguishable forms of the MalK protein was isolated from extracts of strains that do not express MalF and MalG (Fig. 1). Quantitation of the immunoprecipitated MalK proteins showed that a dimer was isolated and not a higher order oligomer (TableII). The fact that an equation that describes the random distribution of homodimers and heterodimers accurately predicted the results of the coimmunoprecipitation assays shows that a very high proportion of the epitope-tagged MalK protein is present in the solubilized extract as a dimer. Based on these data, we suggest that MalK forms a dimer prior to assembling into the membrane bound complex and that this dimerization may represent a step in an ordered assembly pathway of the MTC. The formation of heterodimers by mixing whole cell extracts each containing either tagged or wild-type MalK shows that the dimerization can occur in vitro (Fig. 2). The inefficiency of heterodimer formation in this mixing experiment may indicate that the MalK dimer is relatively stable, resulting in a scarcity of free monomer and/or a slow rate of dimer dissociation. This observation also implies that the dimers observed in Fig. 1 were formed in vivo. The formation of dimers in vitro can be used as an assay to determine what factors may be necessary for MalK association and dissociation. It is possible that the small amount of dimer being formed in this assay is produced from MalK monomers present in the whole cell extracts. However, we consider this unlikely, as the calculations that were discussed above showed that the amount of MalK monomer present in these extracts is likely to be small. Additional evidence for dimerization was provided by the λ cI repressor fusion assay in vivo (Fig. 3). The cI repressor-MalK fusion protein was expressed in the presence of the MalF and MalG proteins of the MTC. This shows that the dimerization that was observed in vitro occurs in vivo and therefore is likely to be biologically significant. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that the cI repressor-MalK fusion protein complements the transport defect of a ΔmalK strain. Heteromeric complexes were also identified between wild-type MalK and the MalK552 and MalK554 insertion mutants (Fig. 4). These mutant proteins are unable to assemble into MalFGK2 complexes with protease-resistant MalF in the absence of wild-type MalK (9Hu J.C. O'Shea E.K. Kim P.S. Sauer R.T. Science. 1990; 250: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Therefore, the assembly defect of these MalK mutants seems to be unrelated to dimerization and likely occurs at a subsequent step in complex assembly. For transport activity, the malK552 allele is dominant to wild-type malK and MalK552 also prevents the formation of MalFGK2 complexes containing protease-resistant MalF (Table III). The insertion in MalK552 might allow stable formation of MalK/MalK552 heterodimers that are incompetent for late stages of complex tetramerization. Paradoxically, the malK554 mutation is recessive tomalK + even though the MalK554 protein can dimerize with wild-type MalK. One possible explanation for these results is that a MalK/MalK554 complex may be destabilized at a subsequent stage of complex assembly. This situation would liberate the wild-type MalK to interact anew with the intracellular population of MalK molecules. The assembly of a stable tetramer of wild-type MalFGK proteins could then “select” for the rarer wild-type MalK homodimers (resulting in protease-resistant MalF and maltose transport). Further studies will identify the stage of assembly that is blocked with these mutants and contribute to our understanding of the assembly pathway. The dimer form of the nucleotide binding domain protein, HisP, from the ABC transporter histidine permease in Salmonella typhimuriumhas also been described by Nikaido et al. (21Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27745-27752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). They found that purified HisP hydrolyzes ATP with a nonlinear dependence on protein concentration, in a manner suggesting that the active form of HisP is a dimer. In gel filtration analysis of purified HisP, only about 3% of the soluble protein was in the dimer peak, whereas the rest of the protein eluted as a monomer. In contrast to this, there appears to be a high proportion of MalK dimers in our solubilized extracts. The discrepancies between the results with the MalK and HisP proteins may be due to differences in assay conditions. Purified proteins were assayed in the HisP system, whereas complex cell extracts were assayed in the MalK experiments. Although MalK and HisP are homologues, they have distinct biological roles and may therefore have different dimerization and assembly characteristics. In addition to assembling into a membrane bound transport complex and hydrolyzing ATP as HisP does, MalK also regulates the expression of malgenes and the activity of the transporter (4Reyes M. Shuman H.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4598-4602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Dean D.A. Reizer J. Nikaido H. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21005-21010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the MalK insertion mutants examined in this study are proficient for the MalK/MalT-dependent mal gene regulation (8Lippincott J. Traxler B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1337-1343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the dimerization of MalK may also be important in this process. The in vivo assembly pathway of the MTC or other members of the ABC transporter superfamily is unknown. The finding that MalK efficiently forms a dimer in the absence of MalF and MalG implies that a dimer of the nucleotide binding domain proteins of these transporters may be a first step in their assembly pathways. However, Liu and Ames (22Liu P. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3495-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) recently reported that HisP molecules are recruited individually to the HisQM complex in vitro. Clearly, there are important differences between the in vitro reconstitution studies with the HisQMP2 complex and our studies of MalK dimerization in whole cell extracts. If the different oligomerization characteristics that are observed with HisP and MalK are due to biological differences between these proteins, distinct assembly pathways of different ABC transporters may exist. Alternatively, either the MalK dimer or monomer may be proficient for complex assembly. This idea is consistent with a model that supposes an efficient assembly process in which the complex incorporates each subunit of the MTC as they become available and not necessarily in a strictly ordered pathway. Our results suggest that the dimer form of MalK is the physiologically relevant species for assemblyin vivo. The present studies provide a basis for future work in which the protein domains responsible for dimerization can be determined. Subsequently, the role that dimerization plays in the assembly of the MTC and in the regulatory roles of MalK can be explored experimentally. The coimmunoprecipitation techniques can be employed to isolate higher order assembly intermediates of the MTC and could also be valuable in the characterization of other systems.

Many eukaryotic gene products elicit remarkable functional diversity, even those involved in basic cellular processes. In particular, increasing evidence indicates that a number of ribosomal proteins fulfill a second function apart from ribosome and protein synthesis (1Wool I.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 164-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Ribosome biogenesis takes place in the nucleolus where rDNA is transcribed in a large precursor RNA which is then processed by nucleotide modifications and specific cleavages into mature rRNAs that eventually assemble with ribosomal proteins into ribosomal subunits (2Mélèse T. Xue Z. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar,3Shaw P.J. Jordan E.G. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 93-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). This process requires a number of additional factors, such as small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA) 1The abbreviations used are: snoRNA, small nucleolar RNAs; RRM, RNA Recognition Motif; PEV, Position Effect Variegation; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SELEX, selection-amplification procedure; NS, non-selected sequence; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and non-ribosomal nucleolar proteins. Our knowledge of nucleolar proteins is limited. However, a shared structural feature is the presence of modules thought to represent functional domains (3Shaw P.J. Jordan E.G. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 93-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Such modules include basic and acidic stretches, which possibly interact with ribosomal proteins (4Xue Z. Mélèse T. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 414-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and the so-called RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) (5Nagai K. Oubridge C. Jessen T.H. Li J. Evans P.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), which could bind either rRNAs at different stages of maturation or snoRNAs. Ribosome biogenesis is tightly regulated in a close relationship with cell growth or differentiation. It has long been shown that changing cell culture conditions in a way that either improves the growth rate or induces a differentiation program results in enhancedversus decreased ribosome biosynthesis, respectively (6Nomura M. Sci. Am. 1984; 250: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutations that disrupt gene functions necessary for ribosome assembly often result in growth defects. In yeast or mammalian cell lines, requirement for cell growth has been demonstrated for several snoRNAs (7Maxwell E.S. Fournier M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 35: 897-934Crossref Scopus (545) Google Scholar) and for all the components of RNase MRP, the best characterized snoRNP (8Tollervey D. Kiss T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, several classes of mutations cause growth alteration during development, such as theMinute class (9Lindsley D.T. Zimm G.G. The Genome of Drosophila melanogaster. Academic Press Inc., San Diego1992: 433-441Google Scholar), widely believed to affect ribosomal protein genes (10Saeboe-Larssen S. Lyamouri M. Merriam J. Oksvold M.P. Lambertsson A. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1215-1224PubMed Google Scholar), and mini and bobbedmutations, which alter rRNA production (11Kay M.A. Jacobs-Lorena M. Genetics. 1987; 3: 347-351Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The Drosophila modulo gene (mod) has first been characterized as a dominant suppressor of Position Effect Variegation (PEV) (12Garzino V. Pereira A. Laurenti P. Graba Y. Levis R.W. Le Parco Y. Pradel J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4471-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PEV occurs in experimental strains where genes placed close to constitutive heterochromatin are randomly turned on or off, leading to mosaic adult structures. The products of genes that modify PEV are believed to change the local chromatin structure, which leads, when they are mutated, to an increased (suppression of variegation) or a decreased (enhancement of variegation) expression of neighboring genes (13Elgin S.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 14Henikoff S. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15Wakimoto B.T.

The dominant PEV suppression phenotype of mod, therefore, suggests that its product participates in the formation of multimeric protein complexes that package the DNA, promoting chromatin compaction and inactivation (12Garzino V. Pereira A. Laurenti P. Graba Y. Levis R.W. Le Parco Y. Pradel J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4471-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We have recently reported thatmod, apart from its role in chromatin structuration, has a second cellular function and is required in nucleolus activity and protein synthesis capacity (17Perrin L. Demakova O. Fanti L. Kallenbach S. Mal'ceva N.I. Pimpinelli S. Zhimulev I. Pradel J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2753-2761PubMed Google Scholar). First, cell clones deficient formod express phenotypic traits characteristic ofMinute mutations. Second, the protein, while actually associated to condensed chromatin and heterochromatin sites, is also abundantly found at the nucleolus. Consistent with this localization, Mod displays a modular organization which is often found in nonribosomal nucleolar proteins, including an acidic stretch, two basic regions located at both ends of the molecule, and four reiterated RRMs in the remaining core portion (18Krejci E. Garzino V. Mary C. Bennani N. Pradel J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8101-8115Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Birney E. Kumar S. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5803-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The goal of the investigation reported here was to gain insight into the nucleic acid interactions established by Mod at the nucleolus and chromatin and to determine the molecular mechanism that controls the distribution and balances the function of the protein in the two sub-nuclear compartments. The data show that the two basic domains independently contact DNA without sequence specificity, whereas RRMs provides a sequence-specific RNA-binding activity. We also report that nucleolar Mod is phosphorylated and associated to an RNA moiety, whereas the chromatin-bound Mod appears to be unmodified. A functional scheme is finally proposed in which modification by phosphorylation modulates Mod subnuclear distribution and balances its function at the nucleolus and chromatin. Primers used to generate by polymerase chain reaction sequences encoding the Mod variants were: 1) ACGTGGATCCGCCCAAAAGAAAGCCGTCACCG; 2) ACGTGGATCCGGCCGTATTTATGGTACTACGCAA; 3) ACGTGGATCCGAAGTGCCGCAGTTCAGTGAAGA; 4) ACGTGGATCCTCAGTTTGGCTCAATAAATATAGGGGC; and 5) ACGTGGATCCTGAAGAAGCGCCTGTAGAGAAGCC. Primers pairs (1+2), (2+3), (1+4), (3+4), and (4+5) were used to produce full-length Mod, the protein variants truncated from one or the two basic domains located at the N and C termini and RRMs, respectively. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were produced fromBamHI-digested polymerase chain reaction products cloned in pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), purified according to Smith and Johnson (20Smith D.B.

For SDS-PAGE, proteins were fractionated on 7.5% gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. Bidimensional gel analysis was performed as described in (21O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol.

After SDS-PAGE in the second dimension and electrotransfer, Mod was revealed with anti-Mod monoclonal antibody (mAb) LA9 and anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Promega). Schneider cells nuclei were isolated according to Bellaiche et al. (22Bellaiche Y. Bandyopadhyay R. Desplan C. Dostatni N. Development. 1996; 122: 3499-3508PubMed Google Scholar), resuspended in 30 μl/106 cells of cold RSB buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 800 unit RNasin/ml, mixture of protease inhibitors, pH 7.4), sonicated on ice 2 × 5 s and centrifuged at 4 °C first at 14,000 × g for 10 min and then at 105 × g for 1 h. Samples (20 μl) of the resulting extract were preincubated for 20 min at 37 °C, run on native 3–20% polyacrylamide gels in Tris-glycine, pH 8.3, and transferred on nitrocellulose in carbonate buffer (10 mm NaHCO3/Na2CO3-NaOH, pH 9.8). When indicated, samples were supplemented during the preincubation at 37 °C with M12 or non-selected sequence (NS) RNAs (at final concentration ranging from 50 ng/ml to 1 μg/ml) or with RNase A (5 μg/ml). Interactions between32P-end-labeled RNA (1 ng) and protein were performed for 15 min at 20 °C in 20 μl final of 20 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mg/ml tRNA, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.8% VRC, RNasin (400 units/ml), 5% glycerol, pH 7.4. RNA protein complexes were revealed by autoradiography after 8% PAGE (20 mA) at 4 °C under non-denaturing conditions (5% glycerol, 0.5 × Tris-borate-EDTA). K d values were established from quantification at the phosphoimager in serial experiments with increasing protein concentration and constant probe amount. Isolation and fractionation of nuclei were carried out as described previously (23Garzino V. Moretti C. Pradel J. Biol. Cell. 1987; 61: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei, purified under conditions that prevent loss of nuclear material, were successively extracted in 0.15 and 0.3 m NaCl, and chromatin fragments were solubilized by sonication in 0.45 m NaCl. Western analysis of the recovered fractions was performed with a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against chromatin-bound proteins like histone 2B, nucleosoluble components (S5 and P11 antigens), and Mod (17Perrin L. Demakova O. Fanti L. Kallenbach S. Mal'ceva N.I. Pimpinelli S. Zhimulev I. Pradel J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2753-2761PubMed Google Scholar, 23Garzino V. Moretti C. Pradel J. Biol. Cell. 1987; 61: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The Mod protein was detected in 0.15 m and 0.30–0.45 m NaCl fractions only. For Mod immunoprecipitation assays, sub-nuclear fractions were prepared from either 1 g of dechorionated embryos or 108 KC cells, diluted in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15m, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5) supplied with a mixture of protease inhibitors and preincubated for 1 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Depleted samples (1 ml) were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in the same buffer with 10 mg of protein A-Sepharose saturated with an excess mAb LA9 (1.6 mg of IgG purified from ascitic fluid for 100 mg of protein A-Sepharose beads). Beads were washed three times in 10 mmTris-HCl, 0.5 m LiCl, 0.1% SDS, 2% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4, then in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was prepared for SDS-PAGE. KC cells were exponentially grown in D22 medium, centrifuged, and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C in HN buffer (50 mm Hepes, 0.15m NaCl, pH 7.6) at a density of 106 cells/ml. After centrifugation, cells were incubated again, 3 h at 25 °C and 108 cells/ml, in HN buffer supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1.8 mm glucose, 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate, and, except when specified, with 10% fetal calf serum. Nuclei were purified and fractionated as described previously (23Garzino V. Moretti C. Pradel J. Biol. Cell. 1987; 61: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) but in the presence of an excess of sodium pyrophosphate (10 mm) and of phosphatase inhibitors (2 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1 m sodium fluorure, 20 mm EDTA, and 20 mm EGTA). Mod immunoprecipitation was also performed in the presence of sodium pyrophosphate and phosphatase inhibitors. Purified GST fusion proteins (5 μg) were added to dsDNA-cellulose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 0.5 ml in NT2 buffer supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and incubated at 20 °C for 2.5 h. After centrifugation and three washes in NT2 (0.5 ml each), bound proteins were stepwise eluted from the beads with 0.5 ml of NT2 containing increasing amounts of NaCl. Fractions, including the three washes, were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and analyzed by Western blotting. For embryonic Mod, nuclei were isolated and fractionated as described previously (24Tsai D.E. Harper D.S. Keene J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4931-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). DNA binding assays were performed using 85 and 250 μg of nucleosoluble and chromatin-bound proteins, respectively. We used the synthetic RNA pool first described in Tsai et al. (24Tsai D.E. Harper D.S. Keene J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4931-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). SELEX procedure was essentially as described in Ghisolfi-Nieto et al. (25Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Purified GST fusion proteins (5 μg) were incubated with 20 μl of 50% glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 4 °C in NT2 buffer (100 μl final volume). After three washes in 0.5 ml of NT2 buffer, beads were suspended in 50 μl of binding buffer (20 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 2.5% polyvinyl alcohol, 1 mm EGTA, 100 μg/ml tRNA, 125 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.8%, pH 7.4) and incubated with the RNA sample (0.5 μg) for 5 min at 20 °C. For the first two rounds, RNA samples were preincubated for 5 min at 20 °C with Sepharose beads without protein prior to the selection step. After the third round, 0.5 m urea was added in the last wash. Polymerase chain reaction products were cloned and sequenced after seven rounds of selection/amplification. RNAs were transcribedin vitro by T7 RNA polymerase, 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, purified on a 10% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel, eluted overnight, and precipitated with ethanol. Labeled RNA (50,000 cpm) was renatured in reaction buffer at 37 °C for 15 min and complex formation carried out at 20 °C for 15 min in the presence of increasing amounts of Mod. Enzymatic cleavage reactions by RNase T1 (10−2 unit), RNase V1 (0.2 unit), RNase T2 (0.2 unit), or nuclease NC (0.2 unit) were performed at 20 °C for 5 min in 10 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 μg of carrier tRNA, pH 7.5. Iron-EDTA reactions were done as in (26Lentzen G. Moine H. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Wintermeyer W. RNA. 1996; 2: 244-253PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by phenol/chloroform extraction, and RNA fragments recovered by ethanol precipitation were analyzed on 20% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels. RNase T1 and alkaline ladders served for cleavage site assignments. RNase A salivary gland treatment was as in Richter et al. (27Richter L. Bone J.R. Kuroda M.I. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, salivary glands were preincubated for 2 min in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100, and then for 8 min in either phosphate-buffered saline alone (as a control) or phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml RNase A. Polytene chromosome squashes and staining were performed as described in Clarket al. (28Clark R.F. Wagner C.R. Craig C.A. Elgin S.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 203-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Mod was detected by the mAb LA9 at 20 μg/ml and Maleless (Mle) by affinity purified rabbit anti-Mle antibodies (gift of M. Kuroda) at a dilution of 1/500. Anti-mouse-fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated and anti rabbit-tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson) were used at a dilution of 1/150. Slides were examined under an Axiophot microscope (Zeiss). Mod has been previously shown to bind DNA bothin vitro and in vivo (12Garzino V. Pereira A. Laurenti P. Graba Y. Levis R.W. Le Parco Y. Pradel J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4471-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18Krejci E. Garzino V. Mary C. Bennani N. Pradel J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8101-8115Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cross-linking/immunoprecipitation experiments moreover demonstrated interaction with several repetitive elements, consistent with the protein association to heterochromatin and the dominant phenotype of PEV suppression (17Perrin L. Demakova O. Fanti L. Kallenbach S. Mal'ceva N.I. Pimpinelli S. Zhimulev I. Pradel J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2753-2761PubMed Google Scholar). In order to identify the domains in Mod involved in DNA binding, GST fusions of various truncated versions of the protein were tested on dsDNA-cellulose chromatography. The results showed that the deletion of the two positively charged N- and C-terminal domains is required to abolish the ability of Mod to bind DNA in this assay, whereas truncated mutant proteins of only one of these domains still exhibit some activity (not shown). We further develop SELECT experiments (29Oliphant A.R. Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2944-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) to ask the question of sequence specificity in Mod DNA binding. No obvious consensual motif was revealed by sequence comparison of 40 clones obtained after five rounds of selection/amplification performed using the full-length protein. Thus, the two terminal domains in Mod likely interact with DNA without sequence specificity. The Mod sequence contains a number of putative phosphorylation sites (18Krejci E. Garzino V. Mary C. Bennani N. Pradel J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8101-8115Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Metabolic incorporation of32P in KC cells, followed by immunoprecipitation, Western blotting and autoradiography, reveals that Mod gives rise to a single band of 78 kDa (Fig. 1 A,lane 2), indicating that the protein actually is phosphorylated in vivo. Consistently, treating Western blots with alkaline phosphatase progressively reduces and finally abolishes the 32P labeling (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3and 4). Next, by comparing the 32P incorporation in starved and serum-stimulated cells, we noticed that serum addition raised the specific incorporation in Mod by a factor of 16, whereas the increase in crude cell extracts and purified nuclei was only 2.7- or 4.7-fold, respectively (Fig. 1 B). As internal control to these experiments, we compared the Western signals from serial dilutions of cell extracts grown in the presence or absence of 10% fetal calf serum to show that the serum has no significant effect on Mod de novosynthesis (not shown). These data strongly suggest that serum enhances Mod phosphorylation. To investigate for Mod phosphorylation in vivo, protein isoelectric variants present in embryos were analyzed by dimensional PAGE followed by a Western blot analysis. Nuclear extracts were prepared either in the presence of a mixture of phosphatase inhibitors or digested with phosphatases. Mod from phosphatase-treated extracts runs as a single spot with an apparent pI of 7.2, indicating that the multiple isoforms differing by negative charges (pI from 7.2 to 5.2) observed from non-digested nuclei, correspond to stepwise phosphorylation events on several amino acid residues (Fig.1 C). We previously reported a procedure that combines stepwise salt extraction with low and high speed centrifugations, to isolate distinct subnuclear fractions from purified nuclei, and a comparative Western analysis demonstrating that nucleosoluble proteins and components firmly bound to chromatin were recovered in distinct subfractions; the former by extraction at low salt concentration (0–0.15 m and then 0.15–0.3 mNaCl) and the latter by sonication after raising NaCl concentration from 0.30 to 0.45 m (23Garzino V. Moretti C. Pradel J. Biol. Cell. 1987; 61: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Mod was detected in nucleosoluble (0–0.15 m NaCl) and chromatin (0.30–0.45 m) fractions only. Most significantly, the protein has never been seen in the intermediate salt extract (0.15–0.30 m), ruling out the possibility of a cross contamination between nucleolar and chromatin Mod fractions. This led us to conclude, when considered with immunolocalization and genetic data, that part of the protein is firmly bound to chromatin, whereas the major fraction is nucleolar and solubilized at low salt (17Perrin L. Demakova O. Fanti L. Kallenbach S. Mal'ceva N.I. Pimpinelli S. Zhimulev I. Pradel J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2753-2761PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether this differential distribution could be related to different phosphorylation states of the protein, we analyzed 32P incorporation in Mod from sub-nuclear fractions. The protein was immunoprecipitated from chromatin and nucleosoluble fractions of metabolically labeled KC cells and revealed by Western blotting and autoradiography. As shown in Fig.2 A, nucleosoluble Mod is highly labeled, whereas the chromatin-bound protein does not have detectably incorporated radioactive phosphates. These data suggest that Mod is present in two different states in the nucleus: the nucleolar population is phosphorylated, whereas its chromatin-bound counterpart is not or is poorly phosphorylated. These data also suggested the hypothesis that phosphorylation could control Mod DNA-binding activity. To test the hypothesis, nucleolar and chromatin fractions prepared from embryos were assayed on dsDNA-cellulose chromatography. Data in Fig.2 B indicate that Mod extracted from chromatin strongly binds DNA and is eluted at NaCl concentrations of 0.5–1.0 m, whereas the nucleosoluble protein shows significantly weaker affinity and is eluted at NaCl concentrations of 0.2–0.3 m. Significantly, Mod from a nucleolar extract digested by phosphatase exhibits a substantially improved DNA-binding activity (elution at NaCl concentrations of 0.3–1.0 m). We therefore conclude that phosphorylation likely down-regulates Mod DNA-binding activity in vitro. The presence of four RRMs in Mod led us to investigate the RNA binding properties of the protein. We first tested the affinity of GST-Mod or of a truncated version consisting only of the four RRMs (GST-RRM) to homopolymeric oligoribonucleotides. Both are able to bind poly(G) and poly(U), to a lesser extent poly(A), but not poly(C) (not shown). Second, we used GST-Mod and GST-RRM proteins in a selection-amplification procedure known as SELEX (30Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (8055) Google Scholar) to look for nucleotide specificity in RNA binding. PCR products were cloned and sequenced after seven rounds of selection/amplification of a 25-nucleotide-long random sequence (24Tsai D.E. Harper D.S. Keene J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4931-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Out of 43 sequences selected from the GST-Mod, 24 obey the consensus (UUAC(N)xGU(A/G)G(U/A)(M)x), where N and M are complementary nucleotides putatively able to form a stem, and “x” is comprised between 4 and 6 (Fig. 3). The other clones lack the consensus and do not efficiently bind Mod in gel shift controls (not shown). Their selection can originate from unspecific interaction with the basic terminal domains present in the full-length protein. This hypothesis is supported by the second SELEX experiment performed with GST-RRM. 10 clones from this selection were sequenced, and all were found to match with the consensus defined in Fig. 3. This experiment first confirms the consensual motif derived from the selection by GST-Mod and secondly indicates that RNA binding specificity is only provided by the RRM-containing domain. Band shift assays were performed to confirm that selected sequences actually interact with Mod fusion proteins and to get an estimate of their affinities (K d values are given in Fig. 3). M8 and M12 were found to correspond to the aptamers of highest affinity, with K d values of 25 nm for GST-Mod and of 10 nm for GST-RRM. The other selected RNAs present weaker affinities, with K d values ranging from 100 nm to 1000 nm. Fig.4 reports only the data obtained with M12 aptamer and the various controls done. The aptamer is actually shifted by GST-Mod and GST-RRM, whereas a ribonucleotide lacking the consensus (non-selected sequence, NS) does not (Fig. 4 A). Fig.4 B provides other controls showing that anti-Mod mAb LA9 inhibits the interaction (lane 2), GST alone is ineffective (lane 3), and competition with unlabeled M12 progressively abolishes the shift whereas competition with ribonucleotide NS has no effect (lanes 4–8). Taken together these data indicate that Mod is a sequence-specific RNA binding protein and support the idea that the bipartite motif defined here constitutes a high affinity site for the protein. The conformation of M12 was investigated using several enzymatic probes (31Ehresmann C. Baudin F. Mougel M. Romby P. Ebel J.P. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9109-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) such as RNase V1 (specific for paired nucleotides; Fig.5 B, lane 9), RNase T1 (specific for unpaired guanines; Fig. 5 B, lane 1), RNase T2 (preferential cut after unpaired adenines; Fig.5 B, lane 5), and nuclease from Neurospora crassa (specific for unpaired nucleotides; Fig.6 A). The results are reported on the secondary structure model derived from the enzymatic probing (Fig. 5 C). The data support the existence of a stable hairpin structure presenting an external loop (nucleotides G27–U31) and two internal loops (nucleotides A13–C21/A38–A41 and A47–A55). The external loop is well defined by the presence of an RNase T1 cut at G30 and of several RNase T2 or nuclease NC cleavages at U29 and A28 (see Fig. 5, A and B). Interestingly, G27 is not accessible to RNase T1, indicating that this peculiar guanine is either stacked within the loop or base paired with U31. Many hairpin loops closed by non-canonical base pairs (G–A or G–U) have been described (32Wyatt J.R. Tinoco J.I. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 465-496Google Scholar). In most of the selected aptamers, position U31 is predominantly U or A (see Fig. 3). Other single-stranded specific RNase cleavages are mainly located in the regions A15–U19, U48–A52, and G64–A67 (Fig. 5,A and B). The existence of helices I and II is supported by the presence of several RNase V1 cleavages at positions 9–11, 22–24, 36, 44–45, and 59"

Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels mediate Ca2+currents in muscle, endocrine cells, and neurons. They regulate a variety of important cell functions such as contractility, excitability, secretion, and gene expression. A distinct feature ofl-type Ca2+ channels is their high affinity for Ca2+ antagonists (1Birnbaumer L. Campbell K.P. Catterall W.A. Harpold M.M. Hofmann F. Horne W.A. Mori Y. Schwartz A. Snutch T.P.

Surprisingly, only the chimeric channel containing sequence stretches of the cardiac α1C-asubunit was efficiently blocked by (+)-cis-diltiazem. Sequence comparison of α1S and α1C-a revealed two nonconserved amino acids in segment IVS6. Transfer of a single amino acid (Ile1487) from segment IVS6 of the cardiac α1C-a sequence to the carp skeletal muscle α1S enhanced BTZ sensitivity of the resulting mutant to the level of the α1A/α1C-a chimera. The second divergent amino acid (Val1504, α1C-anumbering) was identified as a strong class C channel inactivation determinant. BTZ blocks Ca2+ channels in a use-dependent manner (18Lee K.S. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1983; 302: 790-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). The structural basis of state-dependent Ca2+ channel block by BTZ is not sufficiently understood. Use-dependent block can be attributed to state-dependent removal of guarding structures or high affinity drug binding to open or inactivated channels during membrane depolarization (19Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 69: 497-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar, 20Starmer C.F. Grant A.O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 28: 348-356PubMed Google Scholar). A detailed analysis of the impact of both amino acids for Ca2+ channel block of α1C-a mutants enabled not only the identification of additional determinants of the diltiazem receptor site but also provided new insights into the molecular mechanism of l-type Ca2+ channel block by BTZ. Our data suggest that besides the putatively pore orientated amino acids in the central part of segment IVS6 (12Hering S. Aczél S. Grabner M. Döring F. Berjukow S. Mitterdorfer J. Sinnegger M.J.

Furthermore, a residue in segment IVS6 (Val1504) that is localized close to the intracellular mouth of the pore and determines inactivation also appears to modulate drug binding. We obtained first structural evidence for a guarded and modulated BTZ receptor of l-type channels. Chimeras AL1 and AL16 were generated by replacing the transmembrane segments IIIS6 and IVS6 and the adjacent S5-S6 linkers of the rabbit brain class A Ca2+ channel (BI-2) α1A (21Mori Y. Friedrich T.

Lc is a construct corresponding to α1C-a-cDNA (23Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S.

Amino acid and nucleotide numbering is according to α1C-a (see Ref.23Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S.

All mutations were introduced by using polymerase chain reaction, which was performed with proof-reading Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). Fragments amplified by polymerase chain reaction were sequenced entirely to confirm sequence integrity. Two microelectrode voltage-clamp ofXenopus oocytes was performed 2–7 days after microinjection of cRNAs in approximately equimolar mixtures of α1 (0.3 ng/50 nl)/β1a (0.1 ng/50 nl)/α2δ (0.2 ng/50 nl) as described previously (8Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out at room temperature in bath solution with the following composition: 40 mm Ba(OH)2, 40 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose (pH adjusted to 7.4 with methanesulfonic acid). Voltage recording and current injecting microelectrodes were filled with 2.8 m CsCl, 0.2 m CsOH, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and had resistances of 0.3–2 MΩ. Activation of endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl− conductance by barium influx through Ca2+ channels was eliminated by injecting 50–100 nl of a 0.1 m1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid solution (adjusted with methanesulfonic acid to pH 7.0) into oocytes 20–40 min before the experiments. The recording chamber (150 μl of total volume) was continuously perfused at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with control or drug-containing solutions. The pClamp software package (version 6.0, Axon Instruments, Inc.) was used for data acquisition and analysis. Data were digitized at 2 kHz, filtered at 1 kHz, and stored on a computer hard disk. Leakage current correction was performed by using average values of scaled leakage currents elicited by a 10 mV hyperpolarizing voltage step. Tonic (“resting state-dependent”) block was measured as peak IBa inhibition during the first pulse after a 3-min equilibration in drug-containing solution at rest (holding potential −80 mV), and use-dependent current inhibition was subsequently estimated during 0.1 or 1 Hz trains of 100-ms test pulses. Inactivation of IBa during a pulse train was estimated by applying similar test pulses in the absence of drug. Recovery of IBa from inactivation was studied at −80 mV by depolarizing Ca2+channels during a 3-s prepulse to 20 mV and subsequent application of a second test pulse to 20 mV at various time intervals after the conditioning prepulse. Peak IBavalues were normalized to the peak current measured during the prepulse. IBa recovered between 90 and 100% during a subsequent 3-min rest at −100 mV. The time course of IBarecovery from inactivation was fit to single or biexponential functions (IBa, recovery =A*exp(−t/τrec, fast) +B*exp(−t/τrec, slow) +C). Data are given as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance of IBa block by diltiazem or gallopamil compared with current decay under control conditions was calculated according to unpaired Student t test (p < 0.05). Fig.1 A shows a schematic representation of the class A/l-type chimeras AL1 and AL16 consisting of either l-type sequence of carp skeletal muscle α1S (AL1) or rabbit heart α1C-a(AL16) in segments IIIS6 and IVS6 and adjacent S5-S6 loops. Previously identified determinants of the BTZ receptor site in the central part of the putative pore-lining α-helical IVS6 segment (Tyr1386, Ala1390, and Ile1393; see Refs. 12Hering S. Aczél S.

Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 872-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) are highlighted in Fig. 1 B. The amino acid sequences of α1C-a and α1S IVS6 segments are identical with the exception of two nonconserved amino acid residues (Fig.1 C). Leu1383 → Ile and Ile1400 → Val represent conservative substitutions as each of the residues is nonpolar, hydrophobic, and of comparable size. As shown in Fig.1 D, corresponding IBa values of chimeras AL1 and AL16 displayed different kinetic properties with chimera AL1 inactivating significantly faster (52 ± 1% IBainactivation during a 300-ms pulse from −80 to 20 mV,n = 18) than AL16 (31 ± 2%, n = 13, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1 D). Our recent finding that inactivation determinants in pore lining S6 segments affect use-dependent Ca2+ channel block by PAA (24Hering S. Aczél S. Kraus R.L. Berjukow S. Striessnig J. Timin E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13323-13328Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) prompted us to examine possible differences in PAA and BTZ sensitivity between chimeras AL1 and AL16 (Fig. 1 D). Drug sensitivity was characterized as resting state and use-dependent IBa inhibition (see also Refs. 12Hering S. Aczél S. Grabner M. Döring F. Berjukow S. Mitterdorfer J. Sinnegger M.J.

Despite the presence of l-type sequence in both constructs (Fig. 1 A), (+)-cis-diltiazem (100 μm) induced much less IBa inhibition of AL1 compared with the pronounced block of AL16 (Fig. 2,A and B). Fig. 2 compares IBa block of AL1 and AL16 by (−)-gallopamil and (+)-cis-diltiazem. In line with previous observations, (−)-gallopamil (100 μm) induced pronounced use-dependent Ca2+ channel block of AL1 and AL16 (12Hering S. Aczél S. Grabner M. Döring F. Berjukow S.

Resting state-dependent Ca2+ channel block was more prominent for the benzothiazepine than for the PAA (Fig. 2 B; see Ref. 18Lee K.S. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1983; 302: 790-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar for similar observations on cardiac myocytes). Thus, the results shown in Fig. 2 A suggest that crucial determinants of the BTZ receptor are missing in the α1Ssequence of AL1. Differences in (+)-cis-diltiazem sensitivity were further analyzed by comparing the time course of IBarecovery at rest. Diltiazem slowed IBa recovery mainly by delaying the slow recovery component (τrec, slow) (Fig.2, C and D). In line with the more pronounced use-dependent block, IBa of AL16 recovered at a significantly slower rate from block by the benzothiazepine than IBa of AL1 (τrec, slow (AL1) = 35 ± 3 s versus τrec, slow (AL16) = 63 ± 10 s, Fig. 2, A, C, and D). The fast recovery time constant was not significantly changed (τrec, fast (AL1) = 1.1 ± 0.2 sversus τrec, fast (AL16) = 1.2 ± 0.2 s). To elucidate the structural basis for the higher BTZ sensitivity of AL16 (Fig. 2), we transferred Ile1383 from α1C-a to the α1S-derived IVS6 segment of AL1 and analyzed the sensitivity of the resulting mutant (L1383I) for (+)-cis-diltiazem. As shown in Fig. 3, mutation L1383I (Fig.1 B) significantly enhanced the BTZ sensitivity of AL1. The single leucine to isoleucine substitution in segment IVS6 of AL1 induced the same amount of resting state and use-dependent block by (+)-cis-diltiazem (100 μm) as in the highly sensitive chimera AL16 (Fig. 3 A). The IC50 value of use-dependent IBa inhibition of AL16 (IC50 = 70 ± 15 μm) did not significantly differ from the mutant L1381I (IC50 = 83 ± 20 μm, p > 0.05) but was significantly different from AL1 (IC50 = 880 ± 65 μm, n ≥ 3 for each concentration). Furthermore, recovery of L1383I in the presence of (+)-cis-diltiazem was slower than in AL1 and comparable with recovery of AL16 (τrec, slow (L13831I) = 59 ± 7 s, Figs.2 C and 3 B). Mutation L1383I transferred not only the sensitivity for (+)-cis-diltiazem but additionally slowed inactivation kinetics compared with AL1 (see inset in Fig.3 A, 27 ± 3% during 300-ms test pulse to 20 mV,n = 6, significantly slower than AL1). The later finding was also evident from a reduced accumulation of Ca2+ channels in inactivation during control pulse trains (white columns in Fig. 3 A). Taken together, the rearrangement of a single methyl group in the outer part of segment IVS6 (mutation L1383I) increased sensitivity for (+)-cis-diltiazem by delaying unblock of resting Ca2+channels. A crucial role of Ile1383 for block of resting Ca2+ channels by (+)-cis-diltiazem is further supported by an enhanced resting state-dependent block of L1383I compared with AL1 (Fig. 3 A). Results in Fig. 3 illustrate that an amino acid at the outer channel mouth in segment IVS6 may have a specific effect on (+)-cis-diltiazem binding and dissociation to resting (closed) channels. Because this finding was obtained using chimeric channels, which might produce peculiar effects caused by an altered sequence environment, we subsequently studied the role of both divergent amino acids in segment IVS6 (Ile1383 and Val1400) using the cardiac α1C-a subunit derived construct Lc (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 4, substitution of the “cardiac” isoleucine in position 1487 by either the corresponding leucine of the carp skeletal muscle α1S or an alanine (I1487L or I1487A) significantly reduced use-dependent channel block by accelerating unblock at rest (Fig. 4, compare unblock of I1487A with unblock of Lc). Substituting alanine for valine in position 1504 at the inner channel mouth (V1504A) dramatically slowed Ca2+ channel inactivation (Fig. 4 A) and simultaneously diminished use-dependent IBa inhibition by (+)-cis-diltiazem (Fig. 4 B). A subsequent analysis of the IBa recovery kinetics from block clearly demonstrated that this substitution at the inner channel mouth (V1504A) did not significantly affect unblock of resting channels (Fig. 4 C, compare unblock of V1504A and Lc). To investigate the kinetics of (+)-cis-diltiazem interaction with Ca2+ channels in the open state, we analyzed the rate and extent of IBa decay at different drug concentrations during depolarizing test pulses to 20 mV (26Holmgren M. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). As for the l-type construct Lc, (+)-cis-diltiazem blockade of mutants I1487A and V1504A occurred with bimolecular association kinetics. The drug association rate (k on) for all three constructs was proportional to the drug concentration, and the off rate (k off) was independent of the applied drug concentration (Fig. 5). We observed no differences between the drug association kinetics of Lc and mutant I1487A. However, V1504A displayed significantly slowed association kinetics compared with Lc with k on(Lc) = (5.85 ± 0.24) × 103m−1s−1 versus k on(V1504A) = (4.93 ± 0.24) × 103m−1s−1 (p < 0.005). No significant changes in k off were observed for the Lc mutants. The characteristics of stereospecific and use-dependent l-type Ca2+ channel block by diltiazem can be transferred to the lowly sensitive α1A subunit of class A Ca2+ channels by threel-type specific amino acids that have previously been identified as high affinity determinants of the PAA receptor site (11Hockerman G.H. Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22119-22122Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar,12Hering S. Aczél S. Grabner M. Döring F. Berjukow S. Mitterdorfer J.

These experiments suggested that the BTZ and PAA receptors have overlapping but not identical determinants in the Ca2+channel segment IVS6. Cai et al. (13Cai D. Mulle J.G. Yue D.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 872-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) reported an approximately 10-fold increase in the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of Ca2+ currents by diltiazem if the PAA receptor determinants in segments IVS6 of an l-type channel (α1C-a) were replaced by the corresponding α1A amino acids. Here we confirm a key role of segment IVS6 for Ca2+ channel interaction with (+)-cis-diltiazem and report additional BTZ-specific receptor determinants in this pore lining segment (Fig. 2). Our data show that an amino acid residue (Ile1487), which is located close to the extracellular mouth of the l-type channel pore, as well as an inactivation determinant (Val1504; α1C-anumbering) at the inner channel mouth participate in the regulation of Ca2+ channel block by BTZs. As shown in Fig. 4, an alanine or leucine substitution of Ile1487 in Lc (compare also AL1 and L1383I, Fig. 3) substantially accelerated channel unblock at rest (Figs. 3 and 4) without altering the association or dissociation rate of (+)-cis-diltiazem for open channels (Fig. 5). The reduction in use-dependent block in the Lc mutants can therefore be explained by an enhanced recovery of channels between the individual pulses of a train rather than by a reduced drug affinity of the channels in the open state. Enhanced recovery could be caused by a reduced bulkiness of a single amino acid resulting in facilitated drug dissociation or alternatively by a direct interaction of the drug molecule with the amino acid side chain in the resting state. If the bulkiness of a single isoleucine in position 1487 would restrict dissociation of (+)-cis-diltiazem from its receptor, removal of the side chain by the substituting isoleucine with the substantially smaller alanine is expected to facilitate channel unblock to a greater extent than exchanging isoleucine for the equally bulky and hydrophobic leucine. However, both Leu and Ala reduced use-dependent Ca2+ channel block to a comparable extent (Fig. 4). Furthermore, channel unblock kinetics of I1487L and I1487A at rest were indistinguishable and occurred at a significantly faster rate than unblock of Lc (Fig. 4, C andD). It is therefore unlikely that the enhanced unblock at rest is determined by the bulkiness of a single amino acid in position 1487. Instead, a single methyl group appears to form part of the BTZ-binding pocket of resting closed channels. It is hard to distinguish whether this methyl group exclusively contributes to binding of diltiazem to closed resting channels or additionally forms part of a complex guarding structure. In thel-type environment of Lc, amino acid substitutions I1487L and I1487A did not significantly decrease resting state-dependent block (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, we favor a “guarding hypothesis” where I1487 simultaneously forms part of a guarding structure. It is tempting to speculate that this guarding structure determines not only channel unblock (Figs. 2, 3, and4 C) but also access of (+)-cis-diltiazem to its binding determinants (Fig. 6). Our data suggest that the BTZ receptor is located closer to the extracellular mouth of the channel pore than the PAA receptor (11Hockerman G.H. Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol.

A cluster of homologous inactivation determinants located close to the inner mouth of the channel pore affecting Ca2+ channel block by PAA was recently identified in segment IIIS6 (24Hering S.

Here we report an analogous role of a residue at the inner mouth of the pore in segment IVS6 in a recombinant l-type channel. As shown in Fig. 4 A, substituting a single valine in segment IVS6 by alanine (V1504A) dramatically slowed Ca2+ channel inactivation kinetics and reduced use-dependent block (Fig.4, A and B). It is interesting to note that the inactivation determinant valine in position 1504 of Lc (Val1504) is conserved in all known Ca2+channel classes with the exception of the α1S subunit cloned from carp skeletal muscle (Fig. 1). These findings provide further evidence for a key role of S6 segments in inactivation gating of Ca2+ channels and confirm a crucial role of homologous residues that are located at the inner channel mouth (see Ref. 30Hering S. Berjukow S. Aczél S. Timin E.N. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 439-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar for review). The analysis of (+)-cis-diltiazem interaction with the inactivation-deficient mutant V1504A at a depolarized potential revealed a reduced drug association rate (k on) compared with mutants I1487A and Lc (Figs. 4 and 5). The reduced use-dependent block of V1504A (Fig. 4 B) is therefore caused by a reduced drug binding reaction at 20 mV and not by an accelerated channel unblock at rest as observed for I1487L and I1487A (Figs. 4 D and 5). Once the drug gained access to its receptor determinants in the open state, inactivating channels are in a more favorable conformation for interaction with (+)-cis-diltiazem than the “noninactivating” mutant V1504A (Figs. 4 A and5). A guarded and modulated receptor hypothesis illustrating the impact of Ile1478 at the outer channel mouth and Val1504at the inner channel mouth in use-dependent Ca2+ channel block by (+)-cis-diltiazem is schematically illustrated in Fig. 6. Ile1487 and Val1504 are separated by five turns of the α-helical IVS6 segments (≈ 27 Å). Compared with the short distance of the putative pharmacophores of diltiazem (between 6 and 9 Å; see Ref. 31Barrish J.C. Spergel S.H. Moreland S. Grover G. Hedberg A. Pudzianowski A.T. Gougoutas J.Z. Mally M.F. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1993; 1: 309-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) the extended structure of the BTZ receptor suggests that some of the inactivation determinants at the inner channel mouth of IIIS6 (15Kraus R.L. Grabner M. Ostler D. Hering S. Striessnig J. Biophys. J. 1998; 74 (abstr.): 107Google Scholar) and IVS6 (Fig. 4) affect Ca2+ channel block not by contributing binding energy butvia allosteric modulation of the drug binding process. However, neither an additional drug trapping of (+)-cis-diltiazem in an inactivated channel state (24Hering S. Aczél S. Kraus R.L. Berjukow S. Striessnig J. Timin E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13323-13328Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) nor a direct contribution of binding energy by Val1504 can be excluded (Fig. 6). In summary, we describe for the first time determinants of the BTZ receptor site that selectively affect BTZ interaction with Ca2+ channels in resting and open or inactivated states. We have demonstrated that a mutation at the inner channel mouth reducing channel inactivation (V1504A) simultaneously reduces the affinity of the BTZ binding site at depolarized potentials. Mutations at the external mouth of the pore (I1487L and I1487A) modulate drug dissociation without significantly affecting the drug affinity of open channels. Further mutational analysis of drug receptor sites will require a differentiation between drug access pathways, drug-binding sites, and conformational changes during membrane depolarization (e.g. inactivation).

When cells are cultured on glycerol, the maximum specific growth rate is decreased from 0.13 to 0.11 h−1 while growth yield is lowered by 20% (from 1.14 × 108 to 9.12 × 107 cells ml−1). Kinetic studies suggest that the effect on growth is mitochondrial in origin. In isolated mitochondria we found that the alternative oxidase actively competes with the cytochrome pathway for reducing equivalents and contributes up to 24% to the overall respiratory activity. Metabolic control analysis reveals that the alternative oxidase exerts a considerable degree of control (22%) on total electron flux. Furthermore, the negative control exerted by the alternative oxidase on the flux ratio of electrons through the cytochrome and alternative pathways is comparable with the positive control exerted on this flux-ratio by the cytochrome pathway. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to report a phenotypic effect because of plant alternative oxidase expression. We suggest that the effect on growth is the result of high engagement of the non-protonmotive alternative oxidase in yeast respiration that, consequently, lowers the efficiency of energy conservation and hence growth.

In addition to a cytochrome c oxidase, plant mitochondria contain a cyanide- and antimycin-resistant alternative oxidase that catalyzes the reduction of molecular oxygen to water upon oxidation of ubiquinol (1Moore A.L.

Additional regulatory factors include the mitochondrial concentration of α-keto acids (10Hoefnagel M.H.N. Millar A.H. Wiskich J.T. Day D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and the redox status of the sulfhydryl/disulfide system (11Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N.

Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 703-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) has considerably improved our understanding of the molecular nature of the oxidase. Scrutiny of cDNA-deduced amino acid sequences has resulted in a model of the catalytic site of the protein that has been postulated to contain a coupled binuclear iron center (12Moore A.L.

Recent work in our laboratory has resulted in the functional expression of the alternative oxidase (from Sauromatum guttatum) in the yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe (14Albury M.S. Dudley P. Watts F.Z. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17062-17066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), a system that has been used to study structure-function relations of the alternative oxidase by site-directed mutagenesis (15Albury M.S. Affourtit C. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30301-30305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The plant alternative oxidase is non-protonmotive (16Moore A.L.

Plant Physiol. 1982; 70: 1271-1276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that any contribution of the enzyme to the overall respiratory activity would affect the efficiency of mitochondrial energy metabolism in plants. Although constitutive over-expression or silencing of the alternative oxidase protein in tobacco and potato has been shown to affect mitochondrial respiration (18Vanlerberghe G.C. Vanlerberghe A.E. McIntosh L. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1503-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Hiser C. Kapranov P. McIntosh L. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), it has not been shown to alter the characteristics of plant growth. The functional expression of the alternative oxidase in S. pombe (14Albury M.S. Dudley P. Watts F.Z. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17062-17066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) has raised the question as to whether or not the mitochondrial respiratory kinetics and growth of this yeast are affected by the constitutive presence of the oxidase. Relatively few studies have been performed to characterize the mitochondrial respiratory kinetics of S. pombe (20Moore A.L. Walters A.J. Thorpe J. Fricaud A.C. Watts F.Z. Yeast. 1992; 8: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 21Jault J.M. Comte J. Gautheron D.C. Dipietro A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, the presence of at least two substrate dehydrogenases is evident as both added NADH and succinate are readily oxidized in isolated mitochondria (20Moore A.L. Walters A.J. Thorpe J. Fricaud A.C. Watts F.Z. Yeast. 1992; 8: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 21Jault J.M. Comte J. Gautheron D.C. Dipietro A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The exhibited respiratory activity is fully sensitive to antimycin and myxothiazol and is linearly dependent upon the Q-redox poise (20Moore A.L. Walters A.J. Thorpe J. Fricaud A.C. Watts F.Z. Yeast. 1992; 8: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggesting that the respiratory chain does not branch at the level of the Q-pool. Heterologous expression of the plant alternative oxidase establishes cyanide-insensitive mitochondrial respiratory activity in S. pombe (14Albury M.S. Dudley P. Watts F.Z. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17062-17066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and thereby introduces an additional oxygen-reducing pathway. Because of the presence of two oxidases and an external-NADH dehydrogenase, the mitochondrial respiratory chain in this yeast system is comparable with those found in plants. In transformed S. pombe cells, functional expression of the alternative oxidase may be fully repressed or induced by including or excluding thiamine in the growth medium, respectively (14Albury M.S. Dudley P. Watts F.Z. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17062-17066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This system therefore provides an excellent model to study effects of the presence of the plant alternative oxidase on growth and mitochondrial respiration. In the present paper, growth physiology experiments suggest that the functional expression of the alternative oxidase inhibits the growth ofS. pombe cells, both in terms of growth yield and rate. Kinetic analysis of respiration strongly indicates that these effects on growth are mitochondrial in origin since they reveal that the non-protonmotive alternative oxidase actively competes for reducing equivalents with the cytochrome pathway, contributing up to 24% to the total mitochondrial respiratory activity. MCA reveals that the alternative oxidase has a considerable degree of control on overall electron flux (C J = 0.22) at the expense of the cytochrome pathway. The calculated control coefficients indicate that the cytochrome route and the alternative oxidase exert comparable control on the relative fluxes through the respective quinol-oxidizing pathways. Both of these observations confirm the potential of the alternative oxidase to divert reducing equivalents away from the cytochrome pathway, thereby lowering the overall efficiency of energy conservation. The S. pombestrain used was sp.011 (ade6–704, leu1–32,ura4-D18, h −). Minimal media and growth conditions for both growth and kinetic experiments were as described by Murray et al.(22Murray J.M. Carr A.M. Lehmann A.R. Watts F.Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3525-3531Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with the additional inclusion of 2.75 μm FeCl3 and lack of Mn2+ and the presence or absence of 0.5 mmthiamine. Growth experiments were performed in minimal medium containing 2% glucose or 3% glycerol with 0.1% glucose. The construction of plasmid pREP1/AOX that contains the alternative oxidase coding sequence under control of the nmt1 promoter has been previously reported by Alburyet al. (14Albury M.S. Dudley P. Watts F.Z. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17062-17066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). S. pombe cells were transformed using a modified lithium acetate method (23Okazaki K. Okazaki N. Kume K. Jinno S. Tanaka K. Okayama H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6485-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). S. pombe cells were aerobically grown overnight in 1-liter minimal medium cultures to a density of approximately 5 × 107 cells ml−1 (mid-logarithmic phase). Mitochondrial isolation was based on a protocol previously described by Moore et al.(20Moore A.L. Walters A.J. Thorpe J. Fricaud A.C. Watts F.Z. Yeast. 1992; 8: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) but without incubation of cells with 0.5 mβ-mercaptoethanol nor the subsequent KCl washes and purification of mitochondria on Percoll gradients. Spheroplasts were prepared essentially as described (20Moore A.L. Walters A.J. Thorpe J. Fricaud A.C. Watts F.Z. Yeast. 1992; 8: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) but with modified concentrations: cells (0.5–1.5 × 109 ml−1) were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min with 1 mg ml−1 Zymolyase and for a further 45 min following the addition of 1 mg ml−1 lysing enzymes. Respiratory activity and reduction level of the Q-pool were simultaneously measured voltametrically in a specially constructed chamber (University of Sussex) housing a Rank oxygen electrode and glassy carbon and platinum electrodes connected to a Ag/AgCl reference electrode similar to that described by Moore et al. (6Moore A.L. Dry I.B. Wiskich J.T. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 76-80Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Mitochondria (0.5–1.0 mg) were incubated in 2.2-ml reaction medium that contained 0.3m mannitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm K2PO4 buffer, 10 mmKCl, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), and 1 μm Q-1. Other chemicals specific to the experiment were added as described in the legends of Figs. 2 and 3.Figure 3Effect of alternative oxidase expression on kinetics of quinone-reducing enzymes in S. pombemitochondria. The dependence of electron flow through succinate dehydrogenase (A) and the external NADH dehydrogenase (B) upon the reduction level of the Q-pool was determined in mitochondria lacking (○) or containing (●) the alternative oxidase by titrating the oxidation of 9 mmsuccinate in the presence of 0.2 mm ATP and 9 mm glutamate (A) or the oxidation of 1.8 mm NADH (B) with 0–30 nm antimycin A under state 4 conditions. The antimycin A titrations were obtained from three different mitochondrial preparations, and each set of kinetics is a summation of data from two to three separate respiratory traces. The data shown in the insets represent steady states unaffected by antimycin A and are averages of 5–24 respiratory traces from ten separate mitochondrial preparations. Steady states were reached upon oxidation of 9 mm succinate + 0.2 mm ATP + 9 mm glutamate (inset A) or 1.8 mm NADH (inset B) under state 4 (1 and 2), state 3 (1 mm ADP;3 and 4), or uncoupled conditions (1 μm CCCP; 5 and 6). Steady states 1, 3, and 5 were reached in mitochondria lacking the alternative oxidase and 2, 4, and 6 in mitochondria containing the oxidase. Combined data in each panel were modeled as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Batch cultures (150-ml minimal medium with or without 0.5 mm thiamine and as carbon source either 2% glucose or 3% glycerol with 0.1% glucose) were inoculated from agar plates with transformed (pREP1/AOX) S. pombe cells and grown aerobically in an incubator/shaker at 30 °C. Light microscopy revealed that the morphology of cells with and without alternative oxidase was comparable, and therefore light scattering was considered a suitable way to determine cell numbers. At set times, aliquots (2 ml) were taken and diluted, and the optical density was read at 595 nm (A 595). Determination of a standard curve revealed that the scattering of light at 595 nm is linearly dependent upon the counted number of S. pombe cells ml−1up to A 595 values of 0.5. The concentration of mitochondrial protein was estimated using the bicinchoninic acid method with bovine serum albumin as a standard (24Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar). Chemicals were, unless stated otherwise, obtained from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, UK) or ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Aurora, OH). Mitochondria isolated from S. pombe cells expressing the alternative oxidase contain a respiratory network that is comparable with those found in plant systems. A relatively easy to use model to describe and predict respiratory kinetics within plant mitochondria has been postulated by Van den Bergen and colleagues (9Van den Bergen C.W.M. Wagner A.M. Krab K. Moore A.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We have used this approach, in which both quinone-reducing and quinol-oxidizing enzymes are assumed to exhibit reversible Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to Q/QH2 (sum of substrate and product is constant), to model the kinetic S. pombe data presented in this paper. Because this model accounts for total electron flux from respiratory substrate to oxygen, it effectively describes the kinetic behavior of the entire electron transfer system and therefore provides a good starting point to study mitochondrial electron transfer in terms of metabolic control analysis (see Refs. 25Fell D.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar and 26Brand M.D. J. Theor. Biol. 1996; 182: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The electron transfer system in S. pombe mitochondria was studied using a “top-down” approach (26Brand M.D. J. Theor. Biol. 1996; 182: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 27Krab K.

Biomembr. 1995; 27: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), being divided into two quinone-reducing blocks (succinate dehydrogenase with dicarboxylate carrier and external-NADH dehydrogenase) and two quinol-oxidizing blocks (cytochrome pathway and alternative oxidase), all of which are linked by the Q-pool. Hyperbolic fits (9Van den Bergen C.W.M. Wagner A.M. Krab K. Moore A.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) describing the experimentally derived kinetics of the individual blocks were used to calculate steady state reduction levels of the Q-pool and to derive elasticities of the respective enzyme blocks with respect to QH2 (27Krab K. Van den Bergen C.W.M. Moore A.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: S289Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 28Moore A.L. Leach G. Whitehouse D.G. van den Bergen C.W.M. Wagner A.M. Krab K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 145-151Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Flux and flux ratio control coefficients were calculated from the elasticity coefficients using a matrix-based method according to Westerhoff and Kell (30Westerhoff H.V. Kell D.B. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1987; 30: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To investigate whether or not growth characteristics of batch-cultured S. pombe were affected by the expression of the non-protonmotive alternative oxidase, growth curves were determined using cells transformed with pREP1/AOX grown on either a fermentable or non-fermentable carbon source in the presence or absence of thiamine (Fig. 1). The results presented in Fig. 1 A indicate that growth of S. pombe on glucose is not affected by the presence of the alternative oxidase since the growth yield in the absence or the presence of the oxidase is the same (∼1.3 × 108cells ml−1). However, a semi-logarithmic representation of these data (Fig. 1 B) reveals a small difference in growth rate during log phase with cells expressing the oxidase exhibiting a 12% lower rate than control cells (0.167 instead of 0.190 h−1). The decrease in growth rate during (early) exponential phase is more pronounced (18%) when cells are grown on glycerol (from 0.131 to 0.108 h−1, Fig. 1 D). The growth curve presented in Fig. 1 C clearly shows that under the latter conditions, when the yeast has to rely predominantly on mitochondrial respiration to produce ATP, the expression of the alternative oxidase has an additional effect on the growth yield that is lowered by 20% (from 1.14 × 108 to 9.12 × 107 cells ml−1). To confirm that these effects on growth yield and rate could be specifically attributed to the expression of the alternative oxidase and were not because of a thiamine limitation, similar growth studies were performed using cells transformed with pREP1 only (i.e.a plasmid lacking the alternative oxidase gene). No differences could be observed between cells grown in the absence or the presence of thiamine (data not shown). The results presented above indicate that the growth physiology of S. pombe is negatively affected by the expression of a single gene encoding the plant alternative oxidase (Fig. 1). These results strongly suggest that the observed effects on growth might be because of an effect on mitochondrial respiration. We therefore investigated respiratory kinetics in mitochondria isolated from cells in which the expression of the alternative oxidase was either induced or repressed. The dependence of electron flow through quinol-oxidizing pathways upon the reduction level of the Q-pool was determined by titrating respiratory activity with malonate in a variety of respiratory states (6Moore A.L. Dry I.B. Wiskich J.T. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 76-80Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 7Dry I.B. Moore A.L. Day D.A. Wiskich J.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 8Siedow J.N. Moore A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1142: 165-174Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9Van den Bergen C.W.M. Wagner A.M. Krab K. Moore A.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); the results of these experiments are summarized in Fig.2. In cells not expressing the alternative oxidase, electron flow through the cytochrome pathway under state 4 conditions is approximately linearly dependent upon the Q-redox poise (Fig. 2 A). Addition of ADP induces a subtle change in this kinetic behavior that is reflected by stimulated electron transfer rates at high (>80%) Q-reduction levels only. Uncoupling with CCCP results in a more significant increase in oxygen uptake rates than in state 3, but again, this occurs exclusively at these high reduction levels of the Q-pool (Fig. 2 A). Consequently, in S. pombe mitochondria the kinetic behavior of the cytochrome pathway with respect to Q/QH2 under both state 3 and uncoupled conditions is concave. These kinetics are different from those found in any plant system studied to date (cf. Ref. 31Millar A.H. Finnegan P.M. Whelan J. Drevon J.J. Day D.A. Plant Cell Environ. 1997; 20: 1273-1282Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The data depicted in Fig. 2 B represent experiments performed using mitochondria possessing the alternative oxidase. Fig.2 B indicates that electron transfer through the alternative oxidase commences when the Q-pool is approximately 20% reduced and that this flow increases disproportionally upon an increasing Q-redox poise. Activity at such a low Q-reduction level suggests that the relative affinity of the alternative oxidase for QH2 is high compared with that found in plants (when the alternative oxidase has not been activated) and indicates that the oxidase has the potential to compete for electrons with the cytochrome pathway (10Hoefnagel M.H.N. Millar A.H. Wiskich J.T. Day D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A direct comparison of cytochrome pathway kinetics (Fig. 2 C) reveals that electron flow through the cytochrome route under state 4 and state 3 conditions is diminished by expression of the alternative oxidase, particularly at Q-reduction levels higher than 30%, whereas electron transfer under uncoupled conditions is not affected significantly at any Q-reduction level. This is illustrated by the kinetics of the overall oxygen uptake which show that, under state 4 and state 3 conditions, oxygen uptake rates are higher at comparable reduction levels in mitochondria lacking the alternative oxidase (Fig.2 A) than in mitochondria possessing the enzyme (Fig.2 B). Under uncoupled conditions, the kinetics are comparable in both types. The kinetics of quinol-oxidizing pathways should be independent of the source of reducing equivalents i.e. the type of substrate. The data represented by the insets of Fig. 2, Aand B were obtained during succinate-oxidation in the absence of malonate and also include steady states achieved upon oxidation of added NADH under different energetic conditions (see steady states 6–9). It is clear that the latter steady states can be readily described by the appropriate curves fitted through data obtained by malonate titrations. This indicates that the quinol-oxidizing pathways are indeed kinetically independent of the employed quinone-reducing enzyme(s), both in cells with and without alternative oxidase. A second point to be addressed with respect to theinsets of Fig. 2 concerns succinate dehydrogenase which, as is the case in many mammalian (32Gutman M. Kearney E.B. Singer T.P. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4763-4770Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and plant mitochondria (33Oestreicher G. Hogue P. Singer T.P. Plant Physiol. 1973; 52: 622-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), requires activation. In S. pombe, activation is ensured by including ATP and glutamate (to remove any bound oxaloacetate by transamination) in the reaction mixture (20Moore A.L. Walters A.J. Thorpe J. Fricaud A.C. Watts F.Z. Yeast. 1992; 8: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). From theinsets of Fig. 2, it can be seen that the steady states reached in the absence of glutamate and/or ATP (see steady states 1 and 2) fit well on the curves describing the overall state 4 kinetics of Q-oxidizing routes, confirming that it is indeed the activation of succinate dehydrogenase that is responsible for increased respiratory activity and not a stimulation of the cytochrome or alternative pathway. Finally, the steady states achieved in the presence of antimycin A (see steady state 9) confirm that the alternative oxidase is either absent (Fig. 2 A, inset) or present (Fig. 2 B, inset), respectively, in mitochondria isolated from cells grown in medium containing or lacking thiamine. Antimycin-insensitive respiratory activity (steady state 9 in Fig.2 B, inset) was fully inhibited by octyl-gallate (data not shown), a potent specific inhibitor of the alternative oxidase (34Hoefnagel M.H.N. Wiskich J.T. Madgwick S.A. Patterson Z. Oettmeier W. Rich P.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The dependence of electron transfer through quinone-reducing enzymes upon the reduction level of the Q-pool was determined by titrating the oxidation rates of succinate or NADH with antimycin A (9Van den Bergen C.W.M. Wagner A.M. Krab K. Moore A.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The data shown in Fig. 3 reveal that the expression of the alternative oxidase does not have a significant effect on the kinetic behavior, under state 4 conditions, of either succinate dehydrogenase (Fig. 3 A) or the external-NADH dehydrogenase (Fig. 3 B). The insets of Fig. 3show respiratory steady states that are unaffected by antimycin A and were achieved during succinate- or NADH-oxidation under state 4, state 3, and uncoupled conditions in the presence or the absence of the alternative oxidase. An effect of the protonmotive force upon kinetics of non-protonmotive quinone-reducing pathways would not be anticipated. It is clear, however, that addition of ADP or CCCP to mitochondria lacking the alternative oxidase results in steady states (see steady states 3 and 5 in insets, respectively) that cannot be described by the fits of state 4 kinetics of succinate (Fig.3 A, inset) and external-NADH dehydrogenase (Fig.3 B, inset). The reason for the lack of fit is, at present, unclear. To quantify the effects of the expression of the alternative oxidase on the kinetic behavior of the overall electron transfer system in S. pombemitochondria, experimental data representing the kinetics of both the quinol-oxidizing (Fig. 2) and quinone-reducing (Fig. 3) enzymes were modeled using hyperbolic expressions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The parameters obtained from the mathematical fits were used to calculate Q-reduction levels under different metabolic conditions at which the system reaches a steady state and to calculate the relative contributions of the individual enzymes to the total electron flow. In Fig. 4 A, fitted data from Figs. 2 B, 3 A, and 3 Bhave been combined and reveal the kinetic interplay between quinone-reducing and quinol-oxidizing enzymes in mitochondria containing the alternative oxidase. Respiratory steady states are achieved when the electron flow through the reducing pathways equals the flow through oxidizing pathways and are represented by the intersection of the curves describing the kinetics of the respective routes. In vivo, it is likely that multiple substrates are oxidized. We have therefore calculated the kinetic parameters for the combined oxidation of succinate and NADH under state 4, state 3, and uncoupled conditions (labeled A–C in Fig. 4, respectively) that are tabulated in Fig. 4 B. Of particular importance are the findings that the alternative oxidase contributes up to 24% of the total electron flow under state 4 conditions and that even under state 3 conditions—likely to reflect the in vivosituation most closely—as much as 19% of the overall respiratory activity is accounted for by alternative oxidase activity. Since the alternative oxidase is a non-protonmotive enzyme (16Moore A.L. Bonner W.D. Rich P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 186: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Moore A.L. Bonner W.D. Plant Physiol. 1982; 70: 1271-1276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), such a high engagement in respiration is likely to lower the overall efficiency of energy transduction. The mathematical expressions that we have used to describe the experimentally determined kinetic dependence of each of the respiratory enzymes on the reduction level of the Q-pool (Figs. 2 and 3) provide a good basis to evaluate the effect of alternative oxidase expression on the kinetic behavior of the overall mitochondrial electron transfer system using MCA. The elasticity of the respective enzymes with respect to the Q-redox poise can be directly calculated from the rate equation of the enzyme, its derivative function, and the steady state reduction level of the Q-pool. Control coefficients can then be calculated from the elasticity coefficients using a matrix-based approach (30Westerhoff H.V. Kell D.B. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1987; 30: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The results presented in Fig. 5illustrate how the position of the respiratory steady state reached upon the combined state 4 oxidation of succinate and NADH is affected by the presence of the alternative oxidase (Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, the data quantify how control in these two steady states is distributed among the individual respiratory enzymes (Fig.5 B). Although intuitively it is expected that the additional presence of a quinol-oxidizing enzyme should result in an increased flux control (C J) exerted by the dehydrogenases, it can be seen from Fig. 5 B that control on total electron flux exerted by the combined activities of succinate and external-NADH dehydrogenase is not significantly affected by the expression of the alternative oxidase (remains ∼10%). Interestingly, control exerted by the alternative oxidase on total electron flux is approximately 22%. This appears to be fully at the expense of the control formerly exerted by the cytochrome pathway. The relatively powerful position the alternative oxidase appropriates within the electron transfer system is further illustrated by the degree of control exerted by this oxidase on the ratio of fluxes through both pathways. The negative control exerted by the alternative oxidase on the flux-ratio of electrons through quinol-oxidizing routes is comparable with the positive control exerted on this flux-ratio by the cytochrome pathway (C rca is −0.964 compared with 1.115, Fig.5 B). The results described in this paper show that expression of the plant alternative oxidase inhibits the glycerol-dependent growth of the yeast S. pombe (Fig. 1, C andD). It is unlikely that this inhibition is an artifactual effect of heterologous expression since growth on glucose is considerably less affected (Fig. 1, A and B). This paper is, to our knowledge, the first to report a phenotypic effect of alternative oxidase expression. Previously, plants have been genetically modified to yield a higher level of, in vitroactive, alternative oxidase protein (18Vanlerberghe G.C. Vanlerberghe A.E. McIntosh L. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1503-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Hiser C. Kapranov P. McIntosh L. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, these plants were not phenotypically affected, possibly because of restricted engagement of the oxidase in vivo. The negative effect onS. pombe growth suggests that, in this system, the alternative oxidase is not merely expressed (cf. Ref. 14Albury M.S. Dudley P. Watts F.Z. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17062-17066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) but also contributes in vivo to the overall respiratory activity. Analysis of mitochondrial respiratory kinetics strongly indicates that the alternative oxidase has indeed the potential to be engaged duringS. pombe respiration. This is particularly evident from the alternative oxidase kinetics with respect to the Q-redox poise that suggest a relatively high affinity of the enzyme for QH2relative to Q (Fig. 2 B). In plants, alternative oxidase activity is stimulated by pyruvate, mainly at low Q-redox levels (35Umbach A.L. Wiskich J.T. Siedow J.N. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This apparently increased relative affinity for QH2 enables the enzyme to compete for reducing equivalents with the cytochrome pathway (10Hoefnagel M.H.N. Millar A.H. Wiskich J.T. Day D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). When the alternative oxidase kinetics in S. pombe are considered in relation to the kinetics of the other enzymes interacting with the Q-pool, the potential of the oxidase to actively compete for reducing equivalents is confirmed. MCA shows that the alternative oxidase exerts ∼22% of the total control on overall electron flux during state 4 conditions, which is at the expense of the cytochrome path (Fig. 5). Furthermore, control of the alternative oxidase on the relative electron fluxes through the QH2-oxidizing pathways is almost equal (in absolute terms) to that of the cytochrome pathway (Fig. 5). Kinetic modeling of the interaction between mitochondrial respiratory enzymes predicts that, in transformed S. pombe, ∼20% of the total respiratory activity is accounted for by the alternative oxidase (Fig. 4). From Fig. 2C it is apparent that the presence of a kinetically competent alternative oxidase results in decreased electron flow through the cytochrome pathway both under state 4 (at any Q-redox poise) and state 3 (at Q-redox levels > 30%) conditions. Since the uncoupled cytochrome pathway kinetics are not significantly affected, particularly at Q-reduction levels above 40% (Fig. 2), it is unlikely that the decreased state 4 and 3 activities are because of reduced expression levels of any one of the components of the cytochrome pathway. Instead, the competitive action of the alternative oxidase is likely to restrict the amount of substrate (i.e.QH2) available for the cytochromebc 1 complex. Interestingly, not only the cytochrome pathway but also the total oxidative state 4 and 3 activities are affected by alternative oxidase expression (cf. Fig. 2, A and B). This suggests that the decrease in cytochrome pathway activity is not fully compensated for by alternative oxidase activity. This may be explained by the different capacities of the respective pathways. The electron turnover capacity of the cytochrome pathway is measured as the specific oxygen consumption rate in mitochondria lacking the alternative oxidase (Fig. 2 A). Under comparable conditions, the electron turnover capacity of the alternative pathway is measured as the specific antimycin-resistant oxygen uptake rate (Fig.2 B). It is evident that the total electron turnover capacity of the alternative oxidase is considerably lower than that of the cytochrome pathway under any energetic condition and at any Q-reduction level. This might be because of differences in protein levels and/or might be related to the minimum V max values of the two pathways. The reported minimum V max of the alternative oxidase is 186 electrons s−1 (34Hoefnagel M.H.N. Wiskich J.T. Madgwick S.A. Patterson Z. Oettmeier W. Rich P.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which is approximately half the value reported for the yeast cytochromebc 1 complex (36Ljungdahl P.O. Pennoyer J.D. Trumpower B.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and one-eighth of that reported for yeast cytochrome c oxidase (37Geier B.M. Schägger H. Ortwein C. Link T.A. Hagen W.R. Brandt U. Von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is therefore tempting to speculate that alternative oxidase expression confers a respiratory pathway in S. pombe that transfers fewer electrons per second than the endogenous cytochrome pathway. When the availability of QH2 for the latter pathway is restricted by the competitive action of the alternative oxidase, the overall rate of electron turnover is decreased. The kinetic data shown in Figs. 2 and 3 are reasonably well described by the mathematical model developed by Van den Bergen and co-workers (9Van den Bergen C.W.M. Wagner A.M. Krab K. Moore A.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 27Krab K. Van den Bergen C.W.M. Moore A.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: S289Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 29Krab K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This model, which assumes homogeneity of the Q-pool, has been successfully used to model mitochondrial respiratory kinetics in several plant systems (9Van den Bergen C.W.M. Wagner A.M. Krab K. Moore A.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 31Millar A.H. Finnegan P.M. Whelan J. Drevon J.J. Day D.A. Plant Cell Environ. 1997; 20: 1273-1282Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). S. pombe is therefore comparable with plants in that the core of its respiratory chain is formed by one homogeneous Q-pool that connects dehydrogenases with oxidases. However, the two systems differ in the way in which the kinetics of the cytochrome pathway are regulated by the protonmotive force. In plant mitochondria, a reduced protonmotive force results in strongly increased cytochrome pathway activity at any Q-reduction level (6Moore A.L. Dry I.B. Wiskich J.T. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 76-80Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 7Dry I.B. Moore A.L. Day D.A. Wiskich J.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 9Van den Bergen C.W.M. Wagner A.M. Krab K. Moore A.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10Hoefnagel M.H.N. Millar A.H. Wiskich J.T. Day D.A. Arch. Biochem.

Plant Cell Environ. 1997; 20: 1273-1282Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, cytochrome pathway activity in S. pombe is stimulated by a decreased protonmotive force only at high reduction levels of the Q-pool (Fig. 2 A). Although the effect of the protonmotive force in S. pombemitochondria is not clearly understood, it appears that the electron transfer rate of the cytochrome pathway is increased upon uncoupling while the relative affinity for QH2 is decreased. This may explain why the cytochrome pathway kinetics are less affected by alternative oxidase expression under uncoupled conditions than under state 4 or state 3 conditions. Although the mathematical fits do not differ significantly (Fig. 2 C), the data in Fig. 2,A and B show that, at low Q-reduction levels (<40%), uncoupled oxygen uptake rates are higher in the absence than in the presence of the alternative oxidase. This suggests that the oxidase is only able to compete for reducing equivalents at a relatively low Q-redox poise. At higher Q-reduction levels, (>40%) cytochrome pathway activity is increased to such a degree that the contribution of the alternative oxidase to the overall rate becomes insignificant. In conclusion, the results presented in this paper are the first to report a phenotypic effect because of the expression of the plant alternative oxidase. We suggest that the mechanisms which down-regulate the engagement of the alternative oxidase under physiological conditions in plants are non-operative in S. pombe. Consequently, the alternative oxidase is capable of contributing considerably to respiration under a variety of physiological conditions. Interestingly, such a contribution results in diminished mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates and, significantly, in a decreased overall efficiency of energy conservation. This has a distinct detrimental effect on yeast growth, particularly when cells are cultured on a non-fermentable carbon source. We thank Dr. D. G. Whitehouse for critically reading the manuscript."

Spectrin, the most abundant protein of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton, is composed of two structurally similar but nonidentical proteins, α- and β-spectrin, encoded by separate genes. α- and β-spectrin are composed primarily of homologous 106-amino acid repeats that fold into three antiparallel α-helices connected by short nonhelical segments (1Speicher D.W.

Science. 1993; 262: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). α- and β-spectrin combine to form heterodimers, which in turn self-associate to form tetramers and higher order oligomers to form a lattice-like structure that is critical for erythrocyte membrane stability as well as erythrocyte shape and deformability. In the red cell, spectrin maintains cellular shape, regulates the lateral mobility of integral membrane proteins, and provides structural support for the lipid bilayer (3Morrow J.S. Rimm D.L.

The predicted isoform contains an COOH terminus different from that in erythrocyte, with the last 22 amino acids of erythrocyte β-spectrin replaced by a new sequence of 213 amino acids. There are no data regarding the molecular mechanisms that regulate the tissue-specific or developmental stage-specific expression of β-spectrin isoforms. For example, it is unknown whether or not isoforms of β-spectrin are transcribed from the same gene by tissue-specific utilization of alternate promoters. This report describes the identification and characterization of a promoter of the human β-spectrin gene that directs high level expression in erythroid cells at all stages of development. This expression of the human β-spectrin gene is mediated by a compact promoter that requires GATA-1 and CACCC-binding proteins for its activity. This promoter does not direct high level activity in nonerythroid tissues, including brain and muscle, suggesting that additional regulatory elements are required for expression of the β-spectrin gene in these tissues. Total RNA was prepared from human fetal liver tissue; human bone marrow; or the human tissue culture cell line K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis with erythroid characteristics, ATCC, CCL 243), HEL (erythroleukemia, ATCC, TIB 180), or HeLa (epithelial-like carcinoma, cervix, CCL 2) using the guanidinium thiocynate-chloroform method as described (33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar). 1 μg of total human fetal liver RNA was reverse transcribed using primer A (Table I) and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI). Single-stranded oligonucleotide ligation and PCR amplification were carried out as described using primers B + D and C + D (34Edwards J.B. Delort J. Mallet J.

Costa F.F. Linzie B.L. Forget B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20449-20454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used as hybridization probe to screen a human genomic DNA library. The library is a Charon 4A bacteriophage library containing fragments of genomic DNA partially digested with AluI andHaeIII with EcoRI linkers added. Selected recombinants that hybridized to the screening probe were purified and subcloned into pGEM-7Z plasmid vectors (Promega). Subcloned fragments were analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion, Southern blotting, and nucleotide sequencing. The transcription initiation site of the erythroid β-spectrin cDNA was determined using an RNase protection assay. A 32P-labeled antisense RNA probe was synthesized by transcription with T7 polymerase of a 180-bp DdeI–ApaI fragment corresponding to the first exon and 5′-flanking sequences of the human β-spectrin gene. The probe (1 × 105 cpm/assay) was hybridized to template RNA at 42 °C for 16 h. Templates in these reactions were 20 μg of total human fetal liver RNA, 20 μg of total RNA from the human cell lines K562 and HEL, or 20 μg of tRNA. Hybrids were digested with a mixture of the nucleases RNase A and RNase T1 (0.125 units and 5 units, respectively, per assay) at 37 °C for 30 min. After digestion, protected fragments were detected by autoradiography after electrophoresis in 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels. Further increases in nuclease concentration or length of incubation did not alter the pattern of the protected fragment (not shown). Nucleotide sequencing was performed using the dideoxy chain termination method of Sanger et al. (36Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar) with T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase; U.S. Biochemical Corp.). The sequencing primers were the Sp6 or T7 vectors of the pGEM-7Z plasmid vector or, for some reactions, synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to known cDNA sequences (Table I). Deoxyinosine trisphosphate was substituted for deoxyguanosine trisphosphate to resolve band compressions and ambiguities. Nuclear extracts were prepared from K562, HEL, MEL (murine erythroleukemia, NIGMS GM00086E), and HeLa cells by hypotonic lysis followed by high salt extraction of nuclei as described by Andrews and Faller (37Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Probes for DNase I footprinting were by produced by PCR amplification of plasmid p173 (see below) as template and a pair of oligonucleotide primers that flank the plasmid polylinker. One oligonucleotide was 5′-end-labeled with [32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase prior to use in PCR. Reaction mixes contained 1–20 μg of MEL cell nuclear extracts, 20,000 cpm of labeled probe, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (38Mason P. Enver T. Wilkinson D. Williams J. Hames B. Higgins S. Gene Transcription: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 47-54Google Scholar). After digestion with DNase I, samples were electrophoresed in 6% polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. The tissue culture cell lines K562 and HEL (erythroid), SH-SY5Y (neural), and HeLa (nonerythroid) were used to study expression of the putative promoter of the gene. K562, MEL, and SH-Sy5Y cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. HeLa cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Test plasmids were prepared by inserting a 700-bp fragment of the 5′-flanking β-spectrin genomic DNA upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene in the plasmid pGL2B (Promega) in both orientations. These plasmids were designated p700-forward and p700-reverse, respectively. Serial truncations of this 700-bp fragment in the pGL2B plasmid were constructed using convenient restriction enzyme sites or PCR amplification. Test plasmids were sequenced to exclude cloning or PCR-generated artifacts. All plasmids tested were purified using Qiagen columns (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA) or cesium chloride plasmid purification, and at least two preparations of each plasmid were tested in triplicate. 107 K562, MEL, and SH-SY5Y cells were transfected by electroporation with a single pulse of 300 V at 960 microfarads with 20 μg of test plasmid and 0.5 μg of pCMVβ, a mammalian reporter plasmid expressing β-galactosidase driven by the human cytomegalovirus immediate early gene promoter (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). 105 HeLa cells were transfected with 2.0 μg of test plasmid and 0.25 μg of the pCMVβ plasmid by lipofection using 4 μl of Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed, and the levels of both luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were determined in cell extracts. All assays were performed in triplicate. Differences in transfection efficiency were determined by co-transfection with the pCMVβ plasmid. COS cells (107) were transfected with 20 μg of the expression plasmids pMT/BKLF (39Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) (a kind gift of Drs. M. Crossley and S. Orkin) or pSG5/erythroid Kruppel-like factor (EKLF) (40Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) (a kind gift of Dr. J. Bieker) as described above. Forty-eight hours after transfection, nuclear extracts were prepared for use in gel shift analyses. Antibodies to GATA-1 and Sp1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to BKLF and EKLF were a kind gift of Drs. M. Crossley and S. Orkin. Binding reactions were carried out as described (41Gallagher P.G. Forget B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1339-1348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Competitor oligonucleotides were added at molar excesses of 10- or 100-fold. Resulting complexes were separated by electrophoresis through 6% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA at 21 °C at 200 watts for 2 h. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. A 576-bp β-spectrin promoter fragment was excised from plasmid p504 (see below) as a KpnI/HindIII fragment and cloned into the KpnI/HindIII sites of pSP72. The HindIII site in the pSP72 β-spectrin plasmid was destroyed by digestion with HindIII, filling in the ends, and religation. A 1909-bp BsaHI/HindIII fragment containing the coding region of the humanAγ-globin gene was cloned into theClaI/HindIII sites of pSP72. A 2614 bpAatII/PvuII fragment from the β-spectrin plasmid was ligated to a 2266 bp EcoRV/AatII fragment from the Aγ-globin plasmid to create the plasmid pSP72βsp/Aγ. The 2483-bp βsp/Aγ gene was excised from this plasmid with EcoRV andHindIII and used for microinjection. Transgenic mice were generated as described in Hogan et al. (42Hogan B. Constantini F. Lacey E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) and Sabatinoet al. (43Sabatino D.E. Cline A.P. Gallagher P.G. Garrett L.J. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Forget B.G. Bodine D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6634-6640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fertilized eggs were collected from superovulated FVB/N female mice approximately 9 h after mating to CB6F1 male mice. After purification, β-spectrin promoter/Aγ-globin DNA fragments were microinjected into the male pronucleus of fertilized eggs. The injected eggs were transferred into pseudopregnant CB6F1 foster mothers. Founders were identified by Southern blotting of genomic DNA obtained from tail biopsies. Copy number was determined by comparing transgenic mouse DNA to K562 DNA. Founder animals were crossed to FVB/N mice for propagation. Total cellular RNA was extracted from mouse tissues, including 10.5-day embryo blood cells, 13.5-day fetal livers, and adult reticulocytes using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies). The tissue-specific pattern of expression of the erythroid β-spectrin promoter/Aγ-globin reporter transgene was analyzed using an RNase protection assay. Linear DNA templates for the RNase protection assay were prepared byEcoRI digestion of a human β-spectrin/Aγ-globin plasmid or by HindIII digestion of a murine α-globin plasmid. Templates were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The 32P-labeled antisense RNA probe was synthesized by transcription with T7 polymerase (MAXIscriptIn Vitro Transcription Kit; Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). The probe (1 × 105 cpm/assay) was hybridized to template RNA at 42 °C overnight. Templates in these reactions were 1 μg of total murine spleen or bone marrow RNA; 10 μg of total RNA from muscle, brain, heart, liver, kidney, lung, or testis; or 10 μg of tRNA. Hybrids were digested with a mixture of the nucleases RNase A and RNase T1. After digestion, protected fragments were detected by autoradiography after electrophoresis in 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Computer-assisted analyses of derived nucleotide sequences were performed utilizing the sequence analysis software package of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (44Genetics Computer Group The GCG Sequence Analysis Software Package, version 8. Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI1994Google Scholar) and the BLAST algorithm, National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, MD) (45Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70715) Google Scholar). Primary screening of a human genomic DNA library with the β-spectrin cDNA probe V252 (Fig.1 A) yielded six hybridization-positive plaques. Selected recombinants were analyzed, and one clone was identified, λ27, that spanned ∼21 kilobase pairs of DNA containing the β-spectrin gene. A limited restriction map of this region is shown in Fig. 1 B. To identify the 5′-end of the human β-spectrin cDNA, RNase mapping with RNase A and RNase T1 nucleases was performed. These experiments identified a single transcription initiation site (Fig.2) and predicted the presence of an additional 64 bp in the mRNA upstream of the 5′-end of the sequence obtained from cDNA cloning. These additional 64 bp of upstream 5′-untranslated sequence were obtained by 5′-RACE. Sequences obtained by RACE were verified by comparison with corresponding genomic DNA sequences (Fig. 3). The sequences around the transcription start site, GCA+1CCAG, closely match transcription initiation recognition sequences, YYA+1NWYY (46Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). No additional ATGs were present in the 5′-untranslated sequences. Taken together, these data suggest that this sequence is at or very near the 5′-end of the human β-spectrin erythroid cDNA.Figure 35′-Flanking genomic DNA sequence. The nucleotide sequence of the 5′-flanking genomic DNA of the human β-spectrin gene is shown. Consensus sequences for potential DNA-protein binding sites are underlined. The transcription initiation site, +1, is denoted by the arrow. The junction between exon 1 and intron 1 is marked by the inverted triangle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The nucleotide sequence of the 5′-flanking genomic DNA upstream of the human β-spectrin cDNA transcription start site is shown in Fig.3. Inspection of the sequence reveals a lack of consensus TATA or CCAAT sequences. Consensus sequences for a number of potential DNA-binding proteins, including GATA-1 (two sites) and Sp1/CACCC-related proteins, characteristics of an erythroid gene promoter, are present in the 5′-flanking sequences. GATA motifs bind GATA-1, a zinc finger transcription factor essential for erythroid development. GC or G(T/C)ACC motifs are the binding sites for a number of transcription factor proteins, including ubiquitous Sp1 and Sp1-like proteins, and cell-restricted proteins such as EKLF. To investigate if the region from −623 to +77 was capable of directing expression of a reporter gene in cultured mammalian cells, test plasmids p700-forward and p700-reverse were transiently transfected into erythroid (K562 and MEL), neural (SY5Y), or nonerythroid (NIH3T3) cells. The relative luciferase activity was determined 48 h after transfection and compared with the activity obtained with pGL2B, a negative control, the promoterless plasmid, and pGL2P, a positive control, the luciferase reporter gene under control of the SV40 early promoter. As shown in Fig.4, the putative β-spectrin gene erythroid promoter plasmid, p700-forward, directed high level expression of the luciferase reporter gene only in erythroid cells. The plasmid with the promoter in reverse orientation, p700-reverse, did not direct expression of the reporter gene in any of the cell lines. Transient transfection analysis of deletions of this β-spectrin gene erythroid promoter fragment identified a 250-bp minimal promoter fragment, p173, that directed erythroid-specific expression of the reporter gene (Fig. 4). The 250-bp minimal promoter fragment contains potential binding sites for GATA-1, as well as Sp1- and CACCC-related proteins, a combination shown to be adequate for expression of a minimal promoter in other erythroid-specific genes. There was minimal to no reporter gene activity in transfected HeLa or SY5Y cells. Consensus sequences for a number of potential DNA-binding proteins, including GATA-1 and CACCC-related proteins, were present in the β-spectrin gene promoter. To identify binding sites for transcription factors within the β-spectrin promoter, DNase I footprinting analysis with nuclear extracts from MEL cells was performed (Fig.5). Footprints at three protected sites were observed. Two sites, sites 1 and 2, contain consensus binding sequences for GATA-1. The third site, site 3, consists of a long GC-rich region of sequences that are recognized by members of the Kruppel-like family of transcription factors as well as CACCC-related proteins. To determine if nuclear proteins could bind these GATA-1 sites in vitro, double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the corresponding β-spectrin promoter GATA-1 sequences (site 1, E + F; site 2, G + H; Table I) or control sequences (I + J; Table I) (47Mignotte"

There is no preferential partitioning of carbamoyl phosphate between the arginine and pyrimidine biosynthetic pathways.

The interaction of CPSase-ATCase was further demonstrated by the unexpectedly weak inhibition of the coupled reaction by the bisubstrate analog, N-(phosphonacetyl)-l-aspartate (PALA). The anomalous effect of PALA suggests that, in the coupled reaction, the effective concentration of carbamoyl phosphate in the vicinity of the ATCase active site is 96-fold higher than the concentration in the bulk phase.

Channeling probably plays an essential role in protecting this very unstable intermediate of metabolic pathways performing at extreme temperatures. Hyperthermophilic organisms exhibit a series of extraordinary structural and functional adaptations to extreme environmental conditions, in particular to high temperature (1Lowe S.E. Jain M.K. Zeikus J.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 451-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Adams M.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 627-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 3Adams M.W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 15: 261-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Pyrococcus abyssi, a hyperthermophilic and barophilic/barotolerant archaea belonging to the sulfur metabolizing group (4Erauso G. Reysenbach A.L. Godfroy A. Meunier J.R. Crump B. Partensky F. Baross J.A. Marteinsson V. Barbier G. Pace N.R. Prieur D. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 160: 338-349Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar), grows anaerobically at temperatures between 67 and 102 °C, with an optimum of 96 °C. Survival of these organisms at these extreme temperatures requires not only proteins of remarkable thermostability, but also some mechanisms to protect labile intermediates from thermal degradation. As in most eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms, the first two reactions of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway are catalyzed by carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (CPSase, EC6.3.5.5) 1The abbreviations used are: CPSase, carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase; ATCase, aspartate transcarbamoylase; OTCase, ornithine transcarbamoylase; PALA, N-(phosphonacetyl)-l-aspartate.1The abbreviations used are: CPSase, carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase; ATCase, aspartate transcarbamoylase; OTCase, ornithine transcarbamoylase; PALA, N-(phosphonacetyl)-l-aspartate. and aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase, EC 2.1.3.2). The product of the CPSase reaction, carbamoyl phosphate, is also a substrate for ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTCase, EC 2.1.3.3) in the arginine biosynthetic pathway. P. abyssi contains a single CPSase (5Purcarea C. Simon V. Prieur D. Hervé G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which provides carbamoyl phosphate for both pyrimidine and arginine biosynthesis. This intermediate is extremely unstable at elevated temperature. At 96 °C, the optimum growth temperature of P. abyssi, the half-life of carbamoyl phosphate is only 2–3 s (6Allen C.M.J. Jones M.E. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 1238-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,7Van de Casteele M. Demarez M. Legrain C. Glansdorff N. Piérard A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 1177-1183Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Consequently, protective mechanisms are likely to be operative ensuring that carbamoyl phosphate is efficiently delivered to the next enzyme in the reaction sequence without significant thermal degradation. Metabolic channeling, a process whereby the product of one enzyme is directly transferred to the next enzyme in the pathway without being released into the bulk solvent, provides a means of sequestering unstable intermediates. The transfer of intermediates requires physical association of the coupled enzymes either as stable complexes such asE. coli tryptophan synthetase (8Yanofsky C. Biochim. Biophys.

The first two enzymes of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway of P. abyssi were recently isolated and characterized (5Purcarea C. Simon V. Prieur D. Hervé G. Eur. J.

The subunit structure of P. abyssi ATCase resembles Escherichia coli ATCase, in a sense that it is comprised of 34-kDa catalytic and 17-kDa regulatory subunits. Remarkably, CPSase activity in P. abyssi is associated with a 35-kDa polypeptide and is thus much smaller than the 120-kDa domain or subunit which catalyzes this reaction in mesophilic organisms. The insensitivity of ATCase to carbamoyl phosphate analogs, phosphonacetate and pyrophosphate (24Purcarea C. Erauso G. Prieur D. Hervé G. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1967-1975Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), suggested that the carbamoyl phosphate-binding site is shielded to some extent from the bulk solvent and that the intermediate may be sequestered within a complex. In this report, isotope dilution experiments and pre-steady state kinetic measurements (26Ovádi J. Tompa P. Vertessy B. Orosz F. Keleti T. Welch G.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have directly demonstrated carbamoyl phosphate channeling between P. abyssi CPSase and both ATCase and OTCase. At ambient temperatures, the channeling is leaky, but the channeling efficiency appreciably increases at elevated temperature. [14C]Sodium bicarbonate (57.3 mCi/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products Inc.; [U-14C]aspartate (300 mCi/mmol) and [14C]ornithine (210 mCi/mmol) from CEA-Saclay, Service of Biochemistry; aspartate, carbamoyl phosphate, ornithine, trichloroacetic acid, and hydroxylamine were from Sigma; Sephacryl S300 Superfine was from Pharmacia. Bio-Rex 70 from Bio-Rad;N-(phosphonacetyl)-l-aspartate (PALA) was a gift from Drs. V. Narayanan and L. Kedda of the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Division of Cancer Treatment, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. P. abyssi strain GE5 was isolated and characterized by Erauso et al. (4Erauso G. Reysenbach A.L. Godfroy A. Meunier J.R. Crump B. Partensky F. Baross J.A. Marteinsson V. Barbier G. Pace N.R. Prieur D. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 160: 338-349Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These cells were grown at 95 °C under anaerobic conditions in enriched artificial seawater containing elemental sulfur (4Erauso G. Reysenbach A.L. Godfroy A. Meunier J.R. Crump B. Partensky F. Baross J.A. Marteinsson V. Barbier G. Pace N.R. Prieur D. Arch.

E. coli EK1104 (F− ara thiΔpro-lac ΔpyrB pyrF ± rpsL) (27Nowlan S.F. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pKSAT3, which encodes the P. abyssi pyrBI operon in Bluescript II KS+ vector (25Purcarea C. Hervé G. Ladjimi M.M. Cunin R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4143-4157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was transformed into E. coli strain EK1104 for expression of the recombinant P. abyssi ATCase. P. abyssi and E. coli cell-free extracts were prepared by resuspending the frozen cells in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA) and sonication six times for 30 s using a Biosonik III sonicator at 20 kilocycles/s. The extracts were dialyzed against the same buffer overnight at 4 °C. P. abyssi CPSase was purified as described previously (5Purcarea C. Simon V. Prieur D. Hervé G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Due to the instability of the protein during later stages of purification, the procedure was carried through ion-exchange and size exclusion chromatography steps (28.Purcarea, C., Enzymes Involved in Carbamoyl Phosphate Metabolism from the Hyperthermophilic and Barophilic Marine Archaebacterium Pyrococcus abyssi. Ph. D. thesis, 1995, Paris-Sud, Paris, France.Google Scholar) resulting in a 43-fold purification of the enzyme. E. coli ATCase was isolated from EK1104 cells transformed with the plasmid pEK2 (27Nowlan S.F. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase activity was measured using the method described by Abdelal and Ingraham (29Abdelal A.T. Ingraham J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 69: 652-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), which relies on the conversion of [14C]carbamoyl phosphate to hydroxylurea. The 0.300-ml assay mixture (25Purcarea C. Hervé G. Ladjimi M.M. Cunin R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4143-4157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, quenched with 30 μl of 1.2 mhydroxylamine, and then incubated for 10 min at 100 °C. After addition of 0.7 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid, the samples were treated as described below for the coupled reaction. Aspartate transcarbamoylase activity was assayed by a procedure (30Perbal B. Hervé G. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 70: 511-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) in which radiolabeled carbamoyl aspartate synthesized from [U-14C]aspartate is isolated by ion exchange chromatography. The substrate concentrations in the 0.300-ml assay mixture and the incubation time were adapted to each temperature as described previously (24Purcarea C. Erauso G. Prieur D. Hervé G. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1967-1975Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Ornithine transcarbamoylase activity was assayed by measuring the formation of radiolabeled citrulline from [14C]ornithine (31Abdelal A.T. Kennedy E.H. Nainan O. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 1387-1396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or [14C]carbamoyl phosphate (32Robin J.P. Penverne B. Hervé G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The assay mixture, consisting of 0.2 mm [14C]ornithine (200,000 cpm/μmol), 5 mm carbamoyl phosphate, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in a final volume of 1.0 ml and then quenched by addition of 100 μl of 1n HCl. The product, [14C]citrulline, was isolated by chromatography on Bio-Rex 70 cation exchange column when the substrate was [14C]ornithine or by removing unreacted radiolabeled [14C]carbamoyl phosphate by quenching in 10% trichloroacetic acid and heating at 100 oC (32Robin J.P. Penverne B. Hervé G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The progress curve for the CPSase-ATCase-coupled reaction was obtained by measuring the time-dependent formation of [14C]carbamoyl aspartate. The assay mixture consisted of 60 mm [14C]bicarbonate (200,000 cpm/μmol), 120 mm NH4Cl, 0.75 mm ATP, and 20 mm aspartate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, in a total volume of 300 μl (5Purcarea C. Simon V. Prieur D. Hervé G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 32Robin J.P. Penverne B. Hervé G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Assays were conducted at 37, 70, and 90 °C and the concentrations of all the substrates was varied as described previously (5Purcarea C. Simon V. Prieur D. Hervé G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The same procedure was used to measure the CPSase-OTCase-coupled reaction, except that aspartate was replaced with 0.2 mm ornithine. The steady state rate of carbamoyl aspartate or citrulline formation, V o, was determined by a least squares fit of the data to the Easterby equation (34Easterby J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 293: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The transient time (τ) was then obtained by extrapolating the steady state rate to the time axis. Continued extrapolation to the concentration axis gave —[I], where [I] is the steady state concentration of the carbamoyl phosphate. Because [I] is dependent on V o, the observed values were normalized to the velocity obtained for the progress curve at 37 °C in cell extracts, using the expression,[I]normalized=[I]observed(Voextract,37°C)(Voobserved)Equation 1 One unit of CPSase, ATCase, or OTCase activity is defined as the formation of 1 μmol of product per hour. Specific enzymatic activity is expressed as units/mg of enzyme or, in the case of cell-free extracts, of total protein. Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method (33Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard. Substrate saturation curves were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation by least square analysis using the program KaleidaGraph. Channeling was analyzed using the approach devised by Ovádiet al. (26Ovádi J. Tompa P. Vertessy B. Orosz F. Keleti T. Welch G.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) for coupled enzymes, E 1and E 2, that catalyze sequential reactions. The steady state velocity of the individual reactions catalyzed by each of these enzymes, V E1 andV E2, was measured using their respective substrates.S→E1k1I→E2k2PEquation 2 The overall reaction rate of the coupled enzyme system,V o, was also measured as a function of time in the presence of all substrates. For partial channeling, the following criteria must be satisfied,VE1=Voand1/τobs>kΓ2(1)≤kΓ2Equation 3 where k Γ2(1) andk Γ2 are the pseudo first-order rate constants for the second reaction in the presence and absence of the first enzymeE 1, respectively. To determine whether theP. abyssi enzymes form complexes that could be isolated, 2-ml aliquots (20 mg) of the dialyzed cell-free extracts were applied to a 1.4 × 50-cm Sephacryl S-300 Superfine column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The column was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.15 ml min-l and fractions (1.0–1.7 ml) were collected and assayed for CPSase, ATCase, and OTCase activity. Column temperature was controlled between 23 and 70 °C by circulating water through the column jacket. Substrates or inhibitors were added to the dialysis and elution buffers as indicated in the text. The catalytic and regulatory properties of P. abyssi CPSase and ATCase were previously described (5Purcarea C. Simon V. Prieur D. Hervé G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Purcarea C. Erauso G. Prieur D. Hervé G. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1967-1975Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Prior to undertaking the channeling studies it was necessary to characterize the OTCase activity in dialyzed P. abyssi cell-free extracts. At 37 °C in the presence of saturating concentrations of carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine, the OTCase specific activity was found in six determinations to be 0.42 ± 0.02 units/mg of cell protein. The rate of product formation is linear for at least 15 min. The carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine saturation curves obtained at 37 °C conformed to Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Nonlinear least squares analysis of this data gave a V max of 0.62 ± 0.08 units/mg, and K m for carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine of 8.0 ± 1.4 and 28.5 ± 5.1 μm, respectively. It is noteworthy, that for OTCase, theK m for the carbamoyl phosphate is 7.5-fold lower than the [S]0.5 value (60.0 ± 2.3 μm) obtained for P. abyssi ATCase (24Purcarea C. Erauso G. Prieur D. Hervé G. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1967-1975Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), suggesting an appreciably higher affinity for the intermediate. Channeling can be detected by measuring the extent to which [14C]carbamoyl phosphate produced endogenously by CPSase is diluted by unlabeled carbamoyl phosphate added to the assay mixture. 2During the course of the 30-min incubation approximately 40% of the exogenous carbamoyl phosphate is hydrolyzed. Thus, the mean concentration of carbamoyl phosphate is 20% lower than the nominal concentration on the x axis. Taking this factor in consideration, the dilution profiles of both the coupled system and uncoupled control would be shifted by 20% to lower concentrations but the shape of the curves would not be significantly altered. Dilution of endogenous carbamoyl phosphate was measured in P. abyssi GE5 dialyzed cell-free extracts containing constitutive levels of all three enzymes, CPSase, ATCase, and OTCase. However, the CPSase-ATCase-coupled reaction could be isolated since the omission of ornithine from the assay mixture resulted in less than 0.1% incorporation of the carbamoyl phosphate into citrulline. At 37 °C, in the presence of saturating [14C]sodium bicarbonate, MgATP, NH4Cl, and aspartate, the incorporation of radiolabeled substrate into carbamoyl aspartate (Fig. 1) was unaffected by unlabeled exogenous carbamoyl phosphate at concentrations up to 125 μm, a value 2-fold greater than the observed [S]0.5 for the intermediate. The concentration of CPSase substrates, ATP, bicarbonate, and ammonia remain relatively unchanged, with only 4.6, 0.03, 0.01% consumed during the course of the reaction. Moreover, the maximum velocity of the ATCase is such that only 7.9 nmol of carbamoyl phosphate could be consumed during the 30-min incubation reaction, a value that corresponds to 25.9 μm. Thus, the plateau in the dilution curve is not an artifact resulting in consumption of both endogenous and exogenous carbamoyl phosphate and represents instead partial compartmentation of the intermediate. This interpretation is confirmed by control experiments that assessed isotopic dilution in an uncoupled system. The same experiment was conducted in extracts of pKSAT3 E. colitransformants (25Purcarea C. Hervé G. Ladjimi M.M. Cunin R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4143-4157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells lack E. coli ATCase, so the carbamoyl phosphate synthesized from [14C]bicarbonate by the E. coli CPSase can only be incorporated into carbamoyl aspartate by the recombinant P. abyssi ATCase. In this case (Fig. 1), the lowest concentrations of exogenous carbamoyl phosphate effectively competes with the endogenous intermediate and produces an appreciable dilution of isotope incorporated into carbamoyl aspartate. In the P. abyssi CPSase-ATCase-coupled reaction, dilution of the endogenous intermediate by high concentrations of exogenous carbamoyl phosphate demonstrates that under these conditions channeling is partial or leaky, not absolute. Nevertheless, these experiments clearly show that in P. abyssi the endogenously synthesized intermediate does not freely equilibrate with carbamoyl phosphate in the bulk phase. Judging from the altered response to allosteric effectors (24Purcarea C. Erauso G. Prieur D. Hervé G. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1967-1975Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the conformational transitions exhibited by P. abyssi ATCase appear to be influenced by temperature. The lability of carbamoyl phosphate makes it impractical to conduct the isotope dilution experiments at elevated temperature. Consequently, the temperature dependence of channeling in the CPSaseATCase-coupled reaction was investigated by carrying out the same experiment at reduced temperature. The dilution profiles obtained at 37 and 22.5 °C are similar at higher concentrations of carbamoyl phosphate, but at 22.5 °C, isotope dilution begins to occur at much lower concentrations of exogenous carbamoyl phosphate (Fig.2). Nevertheless, it is clear that channeling still occurs at the lower temperature. The effect of exogenous carbamoyl phosphate on the incorporation of the radiolabeled intermediate into citrulline was also measured at 37 °C in theP. abyssi cell-free extracts employing the same saturating concentrations of CPSase substrates and 0.2 mm ornithine (Fig. 1). Aspartate was omitted from the assay mixture, so that the formation of radiolabeled carbamoyl aspartate was negligible. Again, no significant isotope dilution occurs up to a concentration of exogenous carbamoyl phosphate of 300 μm which is 38-fold higher than the K m for carbamoyl phosphate of the OTCase, suggesting that the intermediate is also partially channeled to the arginine biosynthetic enzyme. As in the case of the CPSase-ATCase-coupled reaction only a small fraction of the CPSase substrates (4.3% of the ATP) is utilized during the course of the reaction, and the maximum amount of carbamoyl phosphate that could be converted to citrulline by OTCase was 5.7 nmol, corresponding to a concentration of 19.1 μm. The transient time (τ), a parameter that reflects 3It can be calculated that the transient time represents 0.67 of the time required for the system to reach steady state. the time required for a coupled enzyme system to reach steady-state, and the effective concentration of intermediate (34Easterby J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 293: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 35Welch G.R. Easterby J.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 193-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) can be obtained from the progress curve for the formation of the final product (see “Experimental Procedures”). The parameters for unlinked enzymes can be directly determined under circumstances where no channeling would be expected, in this case the coupled reaction between the P. abyssi CPSase and E. coli ATCase. For perfect or absolute channeling both τ and [I] are zero. Intermediate values for these parameters are indicative of partial or leaky channeling. The time course of carbamoyl aspartate formation for the CPSase-ATCase-coupled reaction was obtained for the endogenous enzymes in GE5 dialyzed cell-free extracts as well as purified P. abyssi CPSase in the presence of either partially purified P. abyssi ATCase or purified E. coli ATCase. At 37 °C using cell-free extracts, the progress curve for carbamoyl aspartate formation in the presence of saturating substrates reaches steady state after a short lag phase and remains constant for at least 40 min. Analysis of this data gave a τ of 16 s and a steady state concentration of carbamoyl phosphate [I] of 0.34 μm (Table I). In contrast, when P. abyssi CPSase was coupled to E. coliATCase at the same temperature, values of 51 s and 5.8 μm were obtained for τ and [I], respectively. The carbamoyl phosphate concentration depends on the final steady state velocity of carbamoyl aspartate formation, so all values for intermediate concentration were normalized (see “Experimental Procedures”) to the observed rate at 37 °C obtained with cell extracts. The normalized value for the steady state carbamoyl phosphate concentration in the P. abyssiCPSase-E. coli ATCase-coupled reaction was 2.23 μm or about 7-fold higher than the value obtained forP. abyssi cell extracts. The shorter transient time and lower steady state carbamoyl phosphate concentration is consistent with the idea that the intermediate is partially channeled between the active sites of the P. abyssi enzymes.Table ITransient time parametersProteinSubstrateTemperatureTransient timeCarbamoyl phosphateObservedNormalizedsμmP. abyssiextractAspartate37 °C16.30.340.3470 °C3.38.760.17Ornithine37 °C31.21.090.26P. abyssi CPSase, P. abyssiATCaseAspartate70 °C4.08.900.1790 °C000P. abyssi CPSase,E. coliATCaseAspartate37 °C51.05.802.2370 °C23.941.31.04 Open table in a new tab At 70 °C in cell-free extracts, the steady state rate of product formation remains linear for only 2 min. The transient time was found to be 3.3 s (Table I), a value that is 5-fold smaller than the value obtained at 37 °C. The increased velocity at elevated temperature results in an appreciably higher carbamoyl phosphate concentration. However, the normalized steady state concentration of the intermediate at measured at 70 °C is 0.17 μm. Similar results were obtained for a mixture of isolated P. abyssi CPSase and ATCase (Fig.3 A). The transient time was 4.0 s and the normalized steady state carbamoyl phosphate concentration was 0.17 μm, in good agreement with the values obtained for dialyzed cell-free extracts at the same temperature. The progress curve measured at 70 °C for the purifiedP. abyssi CPSase coupled to E. coli ATCase gives a transient time of 23.9 s and a normalized steady state carbamoyl phosphate concentration of 1.04 μm. Remarkably, at 90 °C both the transient time and steady state concentration of carbamoyl phosphate for the P. abyssiCPSase-ATCase homologous couple are immeasurably small (Fig.3 B and Table I) suggesting that at temperatures close to the optimal growth rate of the organism carbamoyl phosphate channeling is absolute. The corresponding control using the heterologous enzyme system could not be carried out at 90 °C since E. coliATCase is instantaneously inactivated at this temperature. Transient time measurement at 37 °C indicates that carbamoyl phosphate is also partially channeled to ornithine transcarbamoylase. In these experiments, the progress curve for citrulline formation was measured using dialyzed extract supplemented with saturating ornithine and no aspartate.

More specifically, β-Ala348 succeeds βB.

Interestingly, dII is not required for transhydrogenation to occur (decoupled from proton translocation), as initially shown by Yamaguchi and Hatefi (7Yamaguchi M. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28165-28168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mixtures of recombinant dI and dIII from the same species or from different species catalyze decoupled “forward” and “reverse” reactions (cf. Reaction 1) and the so-called “cyclic reaction” (which involves the reduction of bound NADP+ by NADH, followed by the oxidation of bound NADPH by AcPyAD+) (5Fjellström O. Johansson C. Rydström J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11331-11341Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 8Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J.

From a recent study, it was observed that mixtures of rrI plus rrIII and rrI plus ecIII behaved similarly (10Fjellström O. Bizouarn T. Zhang J.-W. Rydström J. Venning J.D. Jackson J.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). They catalyzed high cyclic reaction rates (about the same as those observed in the complete E. coli and R. rubrum enzymes) that were limited by the transfer of hydride equivalents (10Fjellström O. Bizouarn T. Zhang J.-W. Rydström J. Venning J.D. Jackson J.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and slow reverse reaction rates that, with excess rrI under usual assay conditions, were limited by the release of NADP+ (5Fjellström O. Johansson C. Rydström J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11331-11341Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 8Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). With this knowledge at hand, it is now possible to use the rrI plus ecIII system to complement mutagenesis experiments performed on the complete enzyme. In addition to substrate binding affinities and hydride equivalent transfer rates, release rates of NADP+ and relative affinities between domains are properties that can be studied in mixtures of rrI and ecIII. A three-dimensional model of the NAD(H)-binding site in E. coli transhydrogenase has been predicted (11Fjellström O. Olausson T. Hu X. Källebring B. Ahmad S. Bragg P.D. Rydström J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 21: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It adopts the structure of a classical βαβαβ dinucleotide binding domain and constitutes approximately half of the residues in ecI. The structure of alanine dehydrogenase (l-AlaDH), a homologue of transhydrogenase domain I, has recently been solved (12Baker P.J. Sawa Y. Shibata H. Sedelnikova S.E. Rice D.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The monomeric unit of l-AlaDH consists of two structurally similar domains, one of which adopts a classical dinucleotide binding fold responsible for NAD(H) binding, thus supporting the general features of the model (11Fjellström O. Olausson T. Hu X. Källebring B. Ahmad S. Bragg P.D. Rydström J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 21: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Since proton translocation is very likely associated with conformational changes that affect binding and release of NADP(H) (5Fjellström O. Johansson C. Rydström J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11331-11341Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,13Hutton M. Day J.M. Bizouarn T. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Glavas N.A. Hou C. Bragg P.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7694-7702Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), information about the structural architecture of the NADP(H)-binding site is essential for understanding the proton pumping mechanism. It has been proposed that ecIII adopts a structure resembling the classical βαβαβ fold found in e.g.glutathione and thioredoxin reductases (2Olausson T. Fjellström O. Meuller J. Rydström J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the present report, the development of a model comprising parts of the NADP(H)-binding domain is described. The prediction was tested by site-directed mutagenesis. In this context, the availability of a functional cysteine-free transhydrogenase (cfTH) (15Meuller J. Zhang J. Hou C. Bragg P.D. Rydström J. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) has been important. Using this transhydrogenase, single cysteine mutants were introduced into strategic positions. By probing the various mutants with the sulfhydryl-specific reagents NEM and MIANS, information about the location of the mutations relative to the substrate was gained. Furthermore, the reactivities of certain cysteine mutants of cfTH and ecIII enzymes toward diazotized AADP and AAD (analogues of NADP and NAD, respectively, where the amide group has been exchanged for a diazonium moiety) were examined; the aim was to find residues that would be spatially close to the nicotinamide ring. The results of all labeling experiments are discussed in view of the predicted model. The plasmid, here denoted pCLNH, carries the gene coding for the cfTH to which an N-terminal histidine tag has been added. 2J. Meuller and J. Rydström, unpublished observations. This plasmid served as the DNA template for the construction of three cysteine mutants, cfβA348C, cfβA390C, and cfβR425C. The plasmid (here denoted pEcIII) coding for the N-terminal histidine-tagged ecIII, was used as template for the introduction of a set of three single cysteine mutants, i.e. ecIIIH345C, ecIIIR350C, and ecIIID392C. The pEcIII was constructed from the pNHis plasmid (5Fjellström O. Johansson C. Rydström J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11331-11341Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The primers (MedProbe, Norway), GCGTCGAACCATGGAAGCCAGGAAGTGGGTGAGCACCGC and GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT (M13 Fp), with pNHIS as template, were used for polymerase chain reaction amplification of the fragment coding for residues β286–β462. The NcoI/BamHI fragment was excised from pNHIS and replaced by the NcoI- andBamHI-treated polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragment to yield pEcIII. The Quikchange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used for the preparation of these six mutants, and the protocol from the manufacturer was strictly followed. The cfβK424C mutant was made by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (16Olausson T. Hultman T. Holmberg E. Rydström J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13237-13244Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 17Glavas N. Ahmad S. Bragg P.D. Olausson T. Rydström J. J. Biol.

Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), using aPauI/AatII cassette. The ecIIIA348C mutant was achieved by excision of the BssHII/SmaI cfβA348C mutant fragment and subsequent transfer to pEcIII. The ecIIIK424C mutant was made essentially as the original ecIII (5Fjellström O. Johansson C. Rydström J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11331-11341Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but using the cfβK424C mutant plasmid as template. The full-length genes were sequenced to verify the correctness of all mutant products. Domain I fromR. rubrum was expressed and purified essentially as described (6Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Bizouarn T. Grimley R. Diggle C. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Expression and solubilization of the E. coli transhydrogenase enzymes and domains were carried out essentially as described (21Hu X. Zhang J.W. Persson A. Rydström J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, cells were resuspended in 30 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing protease inhibitor (CompleteTM EDTA-free, Boehringer Mannheim), pH 7.5; cells were disrupted using an X-press (AB Biox, Göteborg, Sweden). In the case of the ecIII mutants, the proteins were purified as described (5Fjellström O. Johansson C. Rydström J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11331-11341Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Following the solubilization and subsequent centrifugation of the cfTH enzyme and the cfTH mutants, the supernatant was added to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (2–3 ml of resin/g of membrane pellet), preequilibrated with buffer A (30 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mg/ml Brij 35, 1 mg/ml Thesit, pH 7.5), containing 0.5m NaCl and 7 mm imidazole. This batch was incubated with gentle mixing until more than 80% of the protein had bound to the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (after about 1 h). Regular column chromatography followed, where the gel was first washed with 10–15 column volumes of buffer A containing 0.7 mNaCl and 30 mm imidazole. In a second wash (5–10 column volumes), the salt and imidazole concentrations were decreased to 0.1m and 10 mm, respectively. The protein was eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration to 150 mmin a single step. The transhydrogenase-containing fractions were pooled, diluted with one volume of buffer A, and applied to a 6-ml Resource Q column, pretreated with 20 ml of buffer A, 30 ml of buffer B (buffer A containing 1 m NaCl), and finally 40 ml of buffer A. The column was washed with 15 column volumes of 200 mmNaCl in buffer A. The protein was eluted by increasing the NaCl concentration from 200 to 500 mm in a narrow 5-ml gradient to yield a high concentration of the protein; the transhydrogenase-containing fractions were pooled, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. All mutants displayed a purity greater than 90% as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10–20% gradient gels (Novex, Germany) (not shown). All experiments were performed at 25 °C. NEM and MIANS (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were dissolved in 50% methanol prior to use. The concentration of MIANS was determined optically using an absorption coefficient of 17,000m−1 cm−1 at 322 nm. To determine the time-dependent effect of these probes on reverse and cyclic transhydrogenation rates, normally 200 μm NEM or 4 μm MIANS were added to the enzyme. When labeling experiments were carried out in the presence of substrates, these were incubated together with the protein for 5 min before the labeling reagent was added. Transhydrogenation reactions of cfTH and cfTH mutants were assayed in cfTH buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml Brij 35, pH 7.0). The dIdIII assay buffer (20 mm each of Mes, Mops, Ches, and Tris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) was used for the reconstituted rrI plus ecIII system. Reverse and cyclic transhydrogenase activities were measured optically as described (5Fjellström O. Johansson C. Rydström J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11331-11341Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 22Palmer T. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1099: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The negatively charged MIANS molecule becomes fluorescent when it reacts with sulfhydryl groups. Therefore, the kinetics of MIANS labeling of single cysteine mutants was monitored by a SPEX model FL1T1 τ2 spectrofluorometer. Excitation and emission slits were both 4.3 nm. The excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 330 and 418 nm, respectively. Reactions were initiated by the addition of MIANS to a final concentration of 4 μm. The absorbances of the substrates or substrate analogues at 330 and 418 nm were measured, and inner filter effects were corrected for according to the method developed by Kubista et al. (23Kubista M. Sjöback R. Eriksson S. Albinsson B. Analyst. 1994; 119: 417-419Crossref Google Scholar). Diazotization of the substrate analogues AADP and AAD was performed according to the protocol developed by Fisher et al. (24Fisher T.L. Vercellotti S.V. Anderson B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4293-4299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the concentrations of the products were determined optically using an absorption coefficient of 19,600m−1 cm−1 at 263 nm (24Fisher T.L. Vercellotti S.V. Anderson B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4293-4299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for both substrate analogues. The experiments designed to analyze the effects of NNAD(P) on cyclic reaction rates catalyzed by ecIII mutants are described in the legend to Fig. 5. In the case of the ecIIIK424C mutant, 1.8 μmecIIIK424C, 860 μm NNAD(P), and 0.40 μm rrI were used. Similar procedures (see figure legend of Fig. 5) were followed when the effects of NNAD(P) on reverse activities catalyzed by cfβA348C and cfβA390C were investigated. 530 μmNNAD(P) was added to 16.7 μm cfβA348C, and 530 μm NNAD(P) was added to 4.3 μm cfβA390C; 5-μl samples were withdrawn at selected times and added to 1 ml of cfTH buffer; reverse reaction rates were measured using 500 μm NADPH and 500 μmAcPyAD+. Purified, detergent-dispersed, cfTH, and cfTH mutants were diluted with cfTH buffer to a concentration of about 1.5 mg/ml. NEM (1 mm) or MIANS (1 mm) was incubated for 1 h with the protein before the addition of trypsin. NADPH (1 mm) or NADP+ (5 mm) was added to the protein sample 5 min prior to the initiation of proteolysis. The proteins were digested at ambient temperature with trypsin at a mass ratio of 1:30 of trypsin:transhydrogenase, with and without NEM or MIANS and in the absence and presence of NADPH or NADP+. The reactions were terminated after 45 min by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor, at the mass ratio 2:1 of trypsin inhibitor/trypsin. Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10–20% gradient gels. The concentration of proteins were determined by BCA using bovine serum albumin as standard (25Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18335) Google Scholar). The concentration of NADP+ was determined by a modified Klingenberg procedure previously described (5Fjellström O. Johansson C. Rydström J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11331-11341Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The concentration of NADPH was deduced from optical spectra of the ecIII enzyme samples using an extinction coefficient of 6200m−1 cm−1 at 339 nm. The NADP(H) concentrations were compared with the corresponding BCA-determined protein concentrations in order to determine the amount of NADP(H) bound per ecIII protein. Equilibrium dialysis, performed essentially as described (26Bizouarn T. Diggle C. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), was used to measure dissociation constants of cfTH and efTH mutant proteins for NADPH. Proteins, with and without 1 mm NEM, were incubated for 30 min (cfβA390C) or 2 h (cfTH and cfβK424C) at ambient temperature, before they were dialyzed against 1 liter of dialysis buffer (20 mm Mops, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Brij, pH 7.0) at 0 °C for 12–16 h. The protein was then concentrated to a final volume of at least 0.9 mg ml−1. 60 μl of protein and 60 μl of buffer or buffer plus NADPH were applied to opposite sides of the dialysis membrane. The dialysis chamber was rotated at about 60 rpm at 4 °C. After 6 h, 40-μl aliquots from each chamber were transferred to 1 ml of a buffer containing 10 mm Mops, pH 7.0. The fluorescence of the sample was measured at the emission wavelength of 460 nm using an excitation wavelength of 340 nm. Oxidized glutathione and glutathione reductase were added to determine the fluorescence contribution from NADPH. Sequence similarity searches such as FASTA and BLAST (27Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58697) Google Scholar) failed to unambiguously detect any proteins homologous to domain III of transhydrogenases. Therefore, modeling by homology was not applicable, and information about structural arrangements must rely on alternative procedures. Secondary structure and accessibility predictions in combination with multiple sequence alignments represent important tools in this context. The shaded residues in the E. coli transhydrogenase sequence shown in Fig. 1 signify positions that are conserved (36% of all residues in dIII) among transhydrogenases from 11 different sources. The result of the secondary structure and accessibility predictions by the PHD program (28Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2630) Google Scholar, 29Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 20: 216-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) is presented in the same figure. The patterns that emerge can be compared with conserved features observed in other NADP(H)-binding proteins with known structures. Among these proteins, the classical βαβαβ dinucleotide binding domain is the most common structure, but alternative NAD(P)(H)-binding folds exist (30Bellamacina C.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 31Lesk A.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). There are several characteristics of the transhydrogenase sequences (Fig. 1), suggesting that indeed domain III comprises a classical dinucleotide binding fold, and henceforth, strands and helices are labeled according to standard nomenclature for such a fold (32Adams M.J. Ford G.C. Koekkoek R. Lentz P.J. McPherson Jr., A. Rossman M.G. Smiley I.E. Schevitz R.W. Wonacott A.J. Nature. 1970; 227: 1098-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 33Rossman M.G. Liljas A. Brändén C.I. Banaszak L.J. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 11. Academic Press, Inc., New York1975: 62-102Google Scholar). First, many essential properties of the Wierenga fingerprint are maintained. Second, the predicted secondary structure also emphasizes that this region should adopt a Rossman βαβ fold. Third, at the C-terminal end of βB, one or more positively charged residues are found to interact with the 2′-phosphate group on the NADP(H) molecule in e.g.glutathione reductase, trypanothione reductase, 17-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. The β-His345 and β-Arg350residues in E. coli transhydrogenase are, according to the prediction, in appropriate positions to stabilize the 2′-phosphate in a related manner. The information in Fig. 1 can be used for further tracing of the secondary structure elements that make up the dinucleotide binding fold. For example, residues β-His354 to β-Leu359 are likely to be part of αC. βC is less evident and has therefore not been assigned. The minimal β-sheet in a classical dinucleotide binding domain contains four strands, βA, βB, βC, and βD. Since the switch point, creating the cleft into which the substrate is fitted, is situated between the C-terminal ends of βA and βD, these strands should exhibit conserved features. The hydrophobic character of βA and the glycine-rich consensus at the switch point are well recognized, but the features of βD have been analyzed in less detail. From analysis of the six NADP(H)-binding proteins, glutathione reductase, trypanothione reductase, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, ferredoxin reductase, and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase (see Fig.1), it is observed that they all carry a strictly conserved glycine residue located at the C-terminal end of βD or succeeding βD, approximately where the switch point is formed; furthermore, the strand is hydrophobic, and in glutathione reductase and trypanothione reductase a well conserved aspartic acid residue is located at the N terminus of βD. The lengths of the βD strands vary. Residues β-Asp383 to β-Gly389 in E. colitranshydrogenase are suggested to constitute βD. The three β-strands (βA, βB, and βD) making up the dinucleotide binding core have now been assigned. Some NAD(P)(H)-binding proteins do not contain additional β-strands in this fold (30Bellamacina C.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In transhydrogenase, however, the stretch β418–β424 is strongly predicted as a β-strand; it is hydrophobic; its N-terminal residues are conserved, which is reasonable since they should be close to the substrate; the conserved β-Arg416 could correspond to well conserved charged residues preceding βE in several other proteins; and finally, in the “PREDB” program, designed to predict β-strand contacts, β-Asp383 to β-Gly389 and β-Gln418 to β-Lys424 were strongly predicted to make contacts as parallel β-strands. 3T. Hubbard, personal communication. The result of the prediction is summarized as a visual guide in Fig.2. Below, on the one hand, experiments intended to test this model will be described, and, on the other hand, the model will be used with the aim to help rationalize the properties of several mutants. Four single cysteine mutants, cfβA348C, cfβA390C, cfβK424C, and cfβR425C, were constructed, expressed, and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These residues should, according to the prediction, be in or near the NADP(H)-binding site. Some kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the mutants are given in Table I. None of the mutated residues was essential, but cfβA348C, cfβK424C, and cfβR425C displayed markedly reduced reverse transhydrogenation activities. In addition to yielding the lowest activities, cfβR425C also gave the most elevated KmNADPH value, approximately 8-fold higher than that displayed by cfTH. The substitution cfβA348C was intended to change the properties of transhydrogenase as little as possible; still, however, both reverse and cyclic transhydrogenation ra"

Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh1994: 531-546Google Scholar). These reactions lead to an increase in the mechanical strength, elasticity, and resistance to degradation by plasmin of fibrin clots and promotion of wound healing. Congenital FXIII deficiency is a severe bleeding disorder associated with impaired wound healing and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion in women (2Lorand L. Losowsky M.S. Miloszewski K.J.M. Prog. Hemost. Thromb. 1980; 5: 245-290PubMed Google Scholar). In most cases the disorder is due to FXIIIA deficiency, and only a few cases with FXIIIB deficiency have been reported (3Ichinose A. Bloom A.L. Forbes C.D. Thomas D.P. Tuddenham E.G.D. Haemostasis and Thrombosis. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh1994: 531-546Google Scholar). The FXIIIA gene is located on chromosome 6p24-25 (4Board P.G. Webb G.C. McKee J. Ichinose A. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1986; 48: 25-27Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and spans more than 160 kb of sequence and contains 15 exons (5Ichinose A. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5829-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In addition to its presence in plasma, FXIII exists inside monocytes and macrophages (6Henriksson P. Becker S. Lynch G. McDonagh J.

Invest. 1985; 76: 528-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although the intracellular form of FXIII is a homodimer of FXIIIA alone without FXIIIB, it has functional characteristics identical to those of plasma factor XIII. Genetic studies have confirmed that plasma and intracellular FXIIIA are the products of the same gene (4Board P.G. Webb G.C. McKee J. Ichinose A. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1986; 48: 25-27Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 5Ichinose A. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5829-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 14Ichinose A. Hendrickson L.E. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6900-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It is evident that FXIIIA is actively synthesized in circulating monocytes (10Weisberg L.J. Shiu D.T. Conkling P.R. Shuman M.A. Blood. 1987; 70: 579-582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kradin R.L. Lynch G.W. Kurnick J.T. Erikson M. Colvin R.B. McDonagh J. Blood. 1987; 69: 778-785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it may also be synthesized in megakaryocytes (15Kiesselbach T.H. Wagner R.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1972; 202: 318-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast, the possible biosynthesis of FXIIIA in human liver has been debated (16Kaczmarek E. Liu Y. Berse B. Chen C.S. McDonagh J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17Adány R. Antal M. Thromb.

Transplantations of bone marrow have presented indirect evidence that bone marrow cells are a source of plasma FXIIIA (9Poon M.C. Russell J.A. Low S. Sinclair G.D. Jones A.R. Blahey W. Ruether B.A. Hoar D.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). FXIIIA belongs to a family of TGases, members of which are expressed in various organs, and is regulated by diverse mechanisms. Both keratinocyte TGase and seminal plasma TGase are expressed in highly specialized tissues. The former is expressed prominently in differentiating keratinocytes (20Thacher S.M. Rice R.H. Cell. 1985; 40: 685-695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar); the latter is synthesized by prostatic epithelial cells (21Ho K.C. Quarmby V.E. French F.S. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12660-12667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue TGase is ubiquitously expressed in many cells and tissues (22Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed transcriptional regulatory mechanisms for these genes. The expression of tissue TGase may prove to be regulated by DNA methylation (23Lu S. Davies P.J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4692-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and retinoid response elements were found in the mouse tissue TGase promoter (24Nagy L. Saydak M. Shipley N. Lu S. Basilion J.P. Yan Z.H. Syka P. Chandraratna R.A.S. Stein J.P. Heyman R.A. Davies P.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4355-4365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In the human TGase 3 gene, SP-1- and Ets-1-like motifs were required for the function of its promoter (25Lee J.H. Jang S.I. Yang J.M. Markova N.G. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4561-4568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Analysis of the keratinocyte TGase promoter indicated a region containing three AP-2-like motifs essential for its expression (26Mariniello L. Qin Q. Jessen B.A. Rice R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31358-31363Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast, mechanisms regulating the expression of the FXIIIA gene have not been reported. The mechanism of release of FXIIIA from the synthesizing cells in vivo also remains unknown to date (27Kaetsu H. Hashiguchi T. Foster D. Ichinose A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of the FXIIIA promoter, we have characterized cis-acting sequences and trans-acting factors responsible for the activation of transcription and for the tissue-specific expression of the TATA-less FXIIIA gene in the present study. The megakaryoblastic leukemia cell lines MEG-01 and MEG-J and the histiocyte lymphoma cell line U937 were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The hepatoma cell line HepG2 and the cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and the antibiotics. Finally, the transformed embryonic kidney cell line 293 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and the same antibiotics as mentioned above. HepG2 and HeLa were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank and 293 from the Health Science Research Resources Bank. U937 and MEG-J were kind gifts from Drs. S. Yokoyama and H. Mizoguchi, respectively, and MEG-01 was provided by H. Saito. RNA was isolated from a variety of cells including U937, MEG-01, MEG-J, HepG2, 293, and HeLa by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate method. Five μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde, transferred to a nylon membrane (Zeta-Probe, Bio-Rad), and hybridized with the DIGTM-RNA probe (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) made from the cDNA for FXIIIA (14Ichinose A. Hendrickson L.E. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6900-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Detection was performed using a DIGTM-nucleic acid detection kit following the manufacturer's instructions. The membrane was exposed to Kodak XAR autoradiography film, and the film was subjected to semi-quantitation of mRNA bands by Densitograph 3.01 Imaging Analyzer (Atto Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The fluorescence intensity of the band for FXIIIA was normalized to that for β-actin. To determine the transcription initiation site of the FXIIIA gene, rapid amplification of 5′-cDNA ends (5′-RACE) was performed using a 5′-RACE System, version 2.0 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and total RNA from U937, MEG-01, and HepG2. The cDNA was first synthesized from 500 ng of total RNA using SuperscriptTM II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and an antisense primer (5′-CACATAGAAAGACTGC-3′ designed for exon III of FXIIIA) at 42 °C for 60 min. The cDNA purified by a GlassMax spin cartridge (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used in terminal dideoxynucleotide transferase (TdT) tailing, and PCR was then performed with an internal antisense primer (5′-ACTGCTCTTCTGCCTCCAAA-3′ designed for exon II of FXIIIA) and a 5′-sense primer termed Abridged Anchor Primer. This was followed by a nested PCR using a nested gene-specific antisense primer (5′-GGAAGTGTCGACCATTTTTGACTTTACAAG-3′ designed for exon II of FXIIIA) and a nested adapter primer termed Abridged Universal Amplification Primer. PCR products were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and by the dideoxy sequencing method both directly and after subcloning into pBluescript vectors (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The 5′-RACE experiment was repeated by employing a separate antisense primer for the PCR (5′-GACTTTACAAGGTCCTGCAGG-3′ designed for exon II) and fresh mRNA samples. A chimeric DNA fragment containing the 5′-flanking region, exon I, and exon II of the FXIIIA gene was prepared by ligation of a PstI fragment (−290 to +74) of a 5′-genomic clone into a PstI-cleaved cDNA plasmid for FXIIIA in pBluescript II SK+ (50Takahashi N. Tsukamoto H. Umeyama H. Castaman G. Rodeghiero F. Ichinose A. Blood. 1998; 91: 2830-2838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A probe for S1 nuclease mapping was produced by the single-strand PCR method using Taq DNA polymerase, an antisense primer designed from the sequence in exon II (GSP2, 5′-GGTCCTGGAAGTTTCTGACAT-3′), and the chimeric DNA plasmid as a template. Poly(A) mRNAs were purified from MEG-01 and U937 cells using an oligo(dT)- cellulose column. The probe was hybridized with 2 μg of the mRNA sample in 12.5 mm HEPES, pH 6.4, and 0.4 m NaCl at 60 °C for 8 h and then treated with 500–2000 units S1 nuclease (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 30 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 1 mm zinc acetate, 0.2 m NaCl, and 5% glycerol at 37 °C for 60 min. 10 μg of yeast tRNA was added to the reaction mixture, and then the protected DNA was recovered by precipitation with ethanol. The samples were electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 8m urea, together with a sequencing reaction mixture produced by employing the same antisense primer and template chimeric DNA as used in the generation of the probe. DNAs were transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized with a sense strand digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled RNA probe, which was generated by 20 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) and the chimeric DNA plasmid as a template. Detection of the DNA was achieved using a DIG nucleic acid detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim). A DIG-labeled oligonucleotide (GSP2) was hybridized with 5 μg of poly(A) mRNA at 45 °C for 8 h in a solution containing 0.4 m NaCl and 12.5 mmHEPES, pH 6.4. After ethanol precipitation, the oligonucleotide was extended by Superscript IITM reverse transcriptase using FXIIIA mRNA as a template. DNA products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 6% sequencing gel containing 8 m urea in parallel with dideoxy sequencing ladders. Detection of the DNA was achieved using the DIG nucleic acid detection kit. Genomic clones of FXIIIA were obtained in the previous study (5Ichinose A. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5829-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A 4.5-kb fragment containing the 5′-flanking region of FXIIIA was excised from a phage clone withHindIII and subcloned into a HindIII site of promoter-less pCAT-Basic and -Enhancer vectors (Promega, Madison, WI). A fragment containing −290 to +75 relative to the transcription start site was isolated from the subcloned vector by digestion withPstI and inserted into the PstI site of promoter-less CAT vector (pCAT 0), generating pCAT −290/+75 (Fig.1). A fragment spanning from −2331 to −115 was obtained by digestion of the first CAT construct containing the 4.5-kb fragment with HindIII and SacI and inserted into pCAT −290/+75 digested with HindIII andSacI, generating pCAT −2331/+75. The pCAT −2331/+75 was digested with SacI and XbaI and blunt-ended and circularized, generating pCAT −2331/−115. CAT constructs containing fragments spanning from positions −1593, −806, −114 to +75 were obtained by digestion of HindIII and StuI,SmaI, or SacI of pCAT −2331/+75, respectively, and religation. The sequences of 5′- and 3′-boundaries of generated CAT constructs were verified both by digestion with several restriction enzymes and by dideoxy sequencing. Large scale plasmid preparation was made using a plasmid purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). A series of CAT plasmids harboring either a deletion or nucleotide substitutions that alter or abolish consensus sequences for protein-binding sites was also constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using an overlap extension PCR protocol (28Pan J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22600-22608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two separate PCR fragments for each half of a final hybrid product were generated employing mutagenesis primers (Table I) and outside primers (forward primer, 5′-CTCCTGAAAATCTCGCC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3′). The two products were mixed, and a second PCR was performed using the two outside primers. The resulting products were digested with HindIII and XbaI and ligated into HindIII/XbaI sites of a promoterless CAT plasmid. The inserts were then sequenced to confirm the intended mutations.Table ISequences of the double-stranded oligonucleotides used in this studyOligonucleotideSequenceSite AWild typeTCCTCTTAGGAAGTTATTTAAGAGCCAACTGTCTTMutantaThe oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis.TCCTCTTAGGAAGTTATTTAAGAGCttcCTGTCTTDeletion SCAGGGGAGGAGGGTGAGGGCTCCTCASCTCAAACGGACTCGGGAAAGACAAGSite BWild typeTGGAGAAGGGGGAGGAGAAAACCCTGMutantaThe oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis.TGGAGAAttttGAGGAGAAAACCCTGSite CWild typeCAGATCTAGGGGTGGGGATGGGGAGMutant 1aThe oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis.CAGATCTAGGGGTttttATGGGGAGMutant 2CAGATCTAGGGGcGGGGATGGGGAGMutant 3CAGATCTAGGGaTGGGGATGGGGAGSite DWild typeCTGGTTGCGGTGGGGAGGGCAGATCTMutantaThe oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis.CTGGTTGCGGTttttAGGGCAGATCTXIIIA GATA-1Wild typeTCATCTGAAAGATAGAAAGATGAAAMutantaThe oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis.TCATCTGAAAgATtGAAAGATGAAAXIIIA Ets-1aWild typeCCATTCCTGCAGGAAGTCTTGTGGTMutantaThe oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis.CCATTCCTGCAttAAcTCTTGTGGTXIIIA Ets-1bWild typeTTATTTGCACAGGAGGGACACGTTGMutantaThe oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis.TTATTTGCACAttAGcGACACGTTGConsensusEts-1GCAATAAACAGGAAGTGGTTTGGATA-1GAGTCCATCTGATAAGACTTATCTGCTGCCMZF-1ZN1–4GATCTAAAAGTGGGGAGAAAAZN5–13GATCCGGCTGGTGAGGGGGAATCGPEA-3CTCCGGAGCAGGAAGGCTGATNF-1TATTTTGGATTGAAGCCAATATGATAATGASP-1ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGCLowercase letters indicate the bases mutated.

Both pCAT-Basic and -Control vectors were also employed as negative and positive controls, respectively. After 24 h in culture, the cells were harvested, and cell lysates were prepared. Each transfection experiment was repeated at least three times. CAT activity was measured by the standard method and β-galactosidase activity by the colorimetric method. CAT expression levels were normalized to β-galactosidase activity to correct for differences in transfection efficiency and cell number. Nuclear extracts from culture cells were prepared according to a modified Dignam's method (29Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9155) Google Scholar). Final protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). DNase I footprinting was performed in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.75 mm dithiothreitol, 7.5% glycerol, and 3 μg of poly(dI-dC). Fifty μg of crude nuclear extracts was added and incubated for 10 min on ice. Then, 32P-end-labeled DNA fragments −289 to +75 (10 ng, 5 × 104 cpm) were added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 20 min on ice. At room temperature, digestion with 1 unit of DNase I (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) was allowed to proceed for exactly 1 min. To the control without nuclear extracts, 0.08 or 0.16 units of DNase I was added. The reaction was terminated by adding a stop solution containing 1.5m sodium acetate, 20 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml tRNA. The DNA sample was analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. The corresponding FXIIIA sequence generated by the Maxam and Gilbert method was run alongside the reaction to serve as a marker. Footprinting assays were performed for both strands of the FXIIIA promoter. Complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed, end-labeled with 32P, and purified using Sephadex G-50 quick spin columns (Boehringer Mannheim). Nuclear proteins were preincubated in a reaction solution containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). A competitor DNA was added when needed. After 10 min, the32P-end-labeled duplex oligonucleotide (2 × 104 cpm) was added, and the reaction was incubated for 20 min on ice. For supershift experiments, 2 μl of control rabbit IgG or control rat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) against 1 μl of αNF-1 (a generous gift from Dr. Naoko Tanese), αSP-1, αEst-1 (a kind gift from Dr. Dennis Watson), αEst-1/Est-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), αGATA-1 (N6), or αGATA-2 (RC1.1) (provided by M. Yamamoto) antibody was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 30 min. Northern blot analysis employing total RNAs obtained from cultured cell lines showed a single mRNA band of about 4.0 kb both in U937 and MEG-01 cells, but the band was not detectable in MEG-J, HepG2 or 293 cells (Fig.2), or HeLa cells (data not shown). Semi-quantitation of the bands by an image analyzer revealed that the FXIIIA mRNA level in U937 cells was 3-fold that in the MEG-01 cells, when normalized to β-actin mRNA levels. Rapid amplification of the 5′-cDNA ends was performed to identify the transcription start site of the FXIIIA gene. A single band was observed in both U937 and MEG-01 cells (data not shown); a PCR product of the same size was visible in HepG2 cells only after PCR was performed extensively. Sequencing of 10 subclones of the resulting transcripts revealed that all 10 clones started at a G nucleotide located 76 nucleotides upstream from the first exon/intron boundary. This indicated the presence of a single major transcription initiation site for the FXIIIA gene (large asterisk in Fig.3). These results were also confirmed by direct sequencing of the PCR products for U937 and MEG-01 cells (data not shown). When the 5′-RACE experiment was repeated by employing a new antisense primer and fresh mRNA samples, two major bands were observed: one band corresponded to the tentative transcription initiation site (+1), whereas another band fell upon an A nucleotide 218 bases upstream of the tentative initiation site (small asterisk in Fig. 3). An S1 nuclease mapping analysis, employing a DNA fragment containing the 5′-flanking region, exon I, and exon II of the XIIIAgene, yielded two major bands for both MEG-01 and U937 (data not shown), which corresponded to an A nucleotide 24 bases and a C nucleotide 7 bases upstream from the first exon/intron boundary (open triangles in Fig. 3). A primer extension experiment was also performed using the total RNA from U937, MEG-01, and HepG2 and the oligonucleotide GSP2 and yielded a single major fragment (data not shown) that corresponded to an A nucleotide 40 bases upstream from the first exon/intron boundary (small circle in Fig. 3). As described above, the results of the 5′-RACE, S1 mapping, and primer extension were inconsistent. However, we concluded the tentative +1 nucleotide was a major transcription initiation site for theFXIIIA gene, because all other candidates detected by S1 mapping and primer extension were rather downstream of the 5′-ends of our 6 cDNA clones (14Ichinose A. Hendrickson L.E. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6900-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and the clones of other investigators (18Grundmann U. Amann E. Zettlmeissl G. Küpper H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8024-8028Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, it is unlikely that the A nucleotide 218 bases upstream of the tentative initiation site, which was detected by the second 5′-RACE trial, is a real one, since no nearby promoters were identified by the following experiments (see below). Fragments of various lengths containing the transcription initiation site were inserted into a promoter-less CAT vector, and the constructs were transiently transfected into various cultured cells. Promoter activities were then measured by CAT assay after 24 h of culture. A segment of 2.4 kb that included the 5′-flanking region from −2331 to +75 (transcription start site numbered as +1) was able to transcribe a CAT reporter gene in U937 and MEG-01 cells, whereas this expression was as low as background levels in HepG2, MEG-J, 293 (Fig. 1), and HeLa cells (data not shown). These results indicated that the expression of FXIIIA is hematopoietic cell type-specific. Deletion analysis revealed that a region from −114 to +75 was essential for the expression (a minimal or core promoter) and that this region also showed promoter activity in HepG2 cells (Fig. 1). In U937 cells, stepwise deletions from −2331 to −1593, −806, or −290 resulted in progressive increases in CAT activity, whereas a deletion from −806 to −290 resulted in a decrease in CAT activity in MEG-01 cells. These results indicated that the 5′-upstream region −2331 to −290 contained silencers for the expression in both U937 and MEG-01 cells and that an enhancer specific for MEG-01 cells was present in the region −806 to −290. A deletion from −290 to −114 resulted in a slight decrease in CAT activity in U937 cells but an increase in MEG-01 and HepG2 cells. These results indicated that a weak enhancing element(s) was present in this region for U937 cells, whereas there was a silencing element(s) for MEG-01 and HepG2 cells. To identify nuclear factor binding sites in the core promoter and cell type-specific regulatory region, DNase I footprint assays were performed for the region −290 to +75. Crude nuclear extracts from U937, MEG-01, HepG2 and 293 cells were used for the assays, and both sense and antisense strands were employed as well. Experiments using U937 and MEG-01 nuclear extracts allowed identification of four distinct regions: site A, −39 to −13, and site B, −92 to −73 (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6); sites C and D, from −260 to −223 (lanes 13 and 14). Nuclear proteins from HepG2 cells protected two regions as follows: site B and site C (lanes 7 and 15), whereas 293 nuclear extracts weakly protected a single region, site B (lanes 8 and16). A search for putative transcription factor binding sites using the TRANSFAC 3.2 data base revealed that site A contained a PEA-3 (30Buttice G. Kurkinen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7196-7204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a partial sequence for NF-1 (31Garlatti M. Aggerbeck M. Bouguet J. Barouki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32629-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)-binding sites. It was also revealed that each of sites B, C, and D contained both myeloid zinc finger-1 (MZF-1)- (32Morris J.F. Hromas R. Rauscher III, F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1786-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and SP-1 (33Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar)-binding sites, which partially overlap each other (Fig. 3). It seemed likely that three other sites downstream of site A and upstream and downstream of site C/D were also possibly protected (Fig.4). These regions, however, were excluded from further detailed studies for the following reasons. Only nonspecific bands were observed for the three sites when examined by a gel-shift assay (data not shown), and a computer-assisted search revealed no consensus sequences for transcription factors in these three regions.

We reported earlier that the activation of JAK2 is essential for all the examined signals induced by human GM-CSF through the box1 region of βc, such as promotion of cell survival and proliferation. To elucidate the role of JAK2 in cell survival and proliferation, we generated an artificial activation system by constructing a chimeric molecule (β/JAK2) consisting of βc extracellular and transmembrane regions fused with JAK2, and we analyzed various signaling events in interleukin-3-dependent mouse pro-B cell, BA/F3. The β/JAK2 was constitutively phosphorylated in the absence of human GM-CSF and murine interleukin-3, and this led to proliferation and cell survival. Western blot analysis showed that STAT5, Shc, and SHP-2 were not phosphorylated in the cells, and the consistent activation of β-casein and c-fospromoters was not enhanced. In contrast, c-myctranscription was constitutively activated. We propose that the activation of β/JAK2 suffices for survival and proliferation and that the activation of STAT5 and mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade is not required for these activities in BA/F3 cells.

The Janus tyrosine kinases (JAK) family has four known members, JAK1, 2, 3 and Tyk2, that play an essential role in the signal transduction of cytokine receptors and interferon receptors (1Ihle J.N.

Subsequent studies showed that JAKs were activated in response to a wide variety of cytokines including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) 1The abbreviations used are: GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSFR, GM-CSF receptor; IL-3, interleukin-3; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; hGM-CSF, human GM-CSF; mIL-3, murine IL-3; PI3-K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; CIS, cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein. and interleukin-3 (IL-3) (2Ihle J.

Targeted disruption of JAKs in mice revealed the essential roles of JAKs in cytokine signals in vivo. JAK2 knockout mice are embryonic lethal because of the absence of definitive erythropoiesis (7Parganas E. Wang D. Stravopodis D. Topham D.J. Marine J.-C. Teglund S. Vanin E.F. Bodner S.

The myeloid progenitors from the fetal liver of JAK2-deficient mice failed to respond to erythropoietin, IL-3 and GM-CSF; hence, the essential role of JAK2 in these cytokine signals became evident. The GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFR) consists of an α subunit and a common β (βc) subunit, shared by the receptors for GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 (9Miyajima A. Mui A.L.-F. Ogorochi T. Sakamaki K. Blood. 1993; 82: 1960-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We reported that although the addition of GM-CSF induces oligomerization of α and β subunits, the β subunit is present as a homodimer even before the addition of GM-CSF (10Muto A. Watanabe S. Miyajima A. Yokota T. Arai K. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1911-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is also reported that GM-CSF induced dimerization of βc (11Lopez A.F. Vadas M.V. Woodcock J.M. Milton S.E. Lewis A. Elliott M.J. Gillis D. Ireland R.E. Olwell E. Park L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24741-24747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). βc does not contain intrinsic kinase activity; rather, GM-CSF activates JAK2 through the box1 region (4Quelle F.W. Sato N. Witthuhn B.A. Inhorn R.C. Eder M. Miyajima A. Griffin J. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4335-4341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and dominant negative JAK2 blocked all the examined activities of human (h) GM-CSF in BA/F3 cells (5Watanabe S. Itoh T. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12681-12686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In studies done using a series of βc mutants, multiple signaling pathways were induced by GM-CSFR, and all required the box1 region of βc (12Sakamaki K. Miyajima I. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3541-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 13Watanabe S. Muto A. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Arai K. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7587-7592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). One pathway is the activation of the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade followed by c-fos/c-juntranscriptional activation. This pathway requires a membrane distal region of βc containing tyrosine residues in addition to the box1 region. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of βc by JAK2 in response to GM-CSF stimulation and the following recruitment of SH2-containing effectors such as Shc, SHP-2 through association of SH2 domain, and phosphorylated tyrosine residues of βc has been proposed (14Itoh T.

In contrast, cell survival and low level proliferation can be induced through a βc mutant having no tyrosine residue or only the membrane proximal region containing box1 and box2 regions. These activities are abrogated by deletion of the box1 region or co-expression of dominant negative JAK2, suggesting that cell survival and low level proliferation require JAK2 activation but no cytoplasmic region of βc. Nevertheless, only limited knowledge is available to explain the promotion of proliferation and survival induced by GM-CSF, because the precise mechanisms through which JAK2 transduces signals to downstream pathways remain to be elucidated. One approach to resolve such issues is to differentiate the activation of JAK2 from receptor phosphorylation-dependent signals. We generated a chimeric protein consisting of the βc extracellular and transmembrane domains and JAK2 designated as β/JAK2 and analyzed signaling in BA/F3 cells. Our evidence shows that β/JAK2 is phosphorylated constitutively in BA/F3 cells, and the cells survive and proliferate without activation of STAT5 or the MAPK cascade. RPMI 1640 was purchased from Nikken BioMedical Laboratories Co. Ltd. Fetal calf serum was purchased from Biocell Laboratories Co. Ltd. Recombinant mIL-3 produced in silkworm,Bombyx mori was purified as described (17Miyajima A. Schreurs J. Otsu K. Kondo A. Arai K. Maeda S. Gene. 1987; 58: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Recombinant hGM-CSF and G418 were kindly provided by Schering-Plough. The anti-hGM-CSF receptor β chain (S-16, N-20), anti-JAK2 (HR-758, C-20), anti-STAT5a (L-20), STAT5b (C-17), and anti-SHP-2 (C-18) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antiphosphotyrosine (4G10), anti-Shc, and anti-JAK2 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The antiphospho-Akt (Ser-473) and anti-Akt antibodies were from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine were purchased from Sigma. CIS cDNA and Bcl-xL cDNA used as probes in the Northern blot analysis were gifts from Drs. A. Yoshimura (Kurume University, Japan) and Y. Tsujimoto (Osaka University), respectively. The JAK2 cDNA (pBSK-JAK2) was kindly provided by Dr. J. Ihle (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital). The βc cDNA was originally cloned into pME18S vector containing SRα, as a promoter (18Watanabe S. Mui A.L.-F. Muto A. Chen J.X. Hayashida K. Miyajima A. Arai K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The construction of pME-β/JAK2, a chimera gene encoding βc extracellular and transmembrane regions fused with the N terminus of the full-length JAK2 was done as follows. Two fragments containing the coding region of JAK2, corresponding to amino acid positions 4 to 455 and 456 to 1129, were isolated from pBSK-JAK2 by digesting in HaeI/XhoI andXhoI/NheI, respectively. The coding region of βc extracellular and transmembrane domains (corresponding to amino acid positions 1 to 455) was prepared by isolating theXhoI/FspI fragment from pME18S-βc. TheXhoI/NheI fragment of JAK2 was inserted into the expression vector pME18S using XhoI and SpeI sites, then theXhoI/FspI fragment of βc and theHaeI/XhoI fragment of JAK2 were inserted at theXhoI site. COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfection of COS7 cells with plasmid was done using LipofectAMINE™ (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction. A mIL-3-dependent pro-B cell line, BA/F3, was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 0.25 ng/ml mIL-3, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. To obtain stable transfectants, BA/F3 cells or BAFGMRα, which stably express the wild-type hGM-CSFR α subunit, were cotransfected with pME-β/JAK2 and the pKU-2Neo vector (containing a neomycin-resistant gene) by electroporation, as described (18Watanabe S. Mui A.L.-F. Muto A. Chen J.X. Hayashida K. Miyajima A. Arai K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). After a 2-week selection using 1 mg/ml G418, drug-resistant clones were screened for surface expression of β/JAK2 by FACS analysis (Becton Dickinson), and size of β/JAK2 was confirmed by Western blotting using an anti-JAK2 antibody. Cells cultured with or without mIL-3 and/or hGM-CSF for 12 h were lysed with TTE buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 20 mm EDTA). Genomic DNA was extracted as described (19Taglialatela G. Gegg M. Perez-Polo J.R. Williams L.R. Rose G.M. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and was then suspended in 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, containing 20 μg of DNase-free RNase. Equal amounts of nucleic acids from each sample were separated through a 1.8% agarose gel then the fragmented DNA was visualized after ethidium bromide staining. Analysis of incorporation of [3H]thymidine was done as described (5Watanabe S. Itoh T. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12681-12686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were seeded into a 96-well plate (1 × 104cells/well) with various concentrations of mIL-3 or hGM-CSF as indicated, then the cells were cultured for 24 h, labeled with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well) for 4 h, then harvested onto a glass fiber filter. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine was measured using a filter counter (model 1450 MicroBetaTM, Wallac, Turku, Finland). Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were done as described (5Watanabe S. Itoh T. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12681-12686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (1 × 107 cells/sample) were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Immunoprecipitation was carried out with the indicated antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For Western blotting of total cell lysates, 4 × 105 cell were lysed with 20 μl of lysis buffer, mixed with a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5 μg of bromphenol blue/ml, and boiled. Samples were separated through 10% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels, and transferred to a Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and Western blottings were performed using appropriate antibodies. The immuno reactive bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instruction. PI3-K activity associated with antiphosphotyrosine antibody immunoprecipitates were assayed as follows. Cells (1.5 × 107/sample) were lysed and immunoprecipitated with antiphosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) as described above except that the lysis buffer contained 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with the lysis buffer, twice with 0.5 m LiCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and twice with 100 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Lipid kinase assays were performed on the beads in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 200 μmadenosine, 0.1 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol, and 0.1 mg/ml phosphatidylserine. The kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and MgCl2 to final concentrations of 10 μm and 10 mm, respectively. After incubation at 25 °C for 15 min, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 125 μl of 1n HCl, and the reaction mixtures were extracted with CHCl3:CH3OH (2:1, v/v), spotted onto oxalate-treated thin layer chromatography plates (Silica Gel 60, Merck), and developed using a solvent system of CHCl3, CH3OH, H2O, 25% NH4OH (90:65:8:12, v/v/v/v). Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate was visualized by autoradiography, and 32P incorporation was quantified using a FUJI image analyzer (model BAS-2000). Activity of Akt was analyzed by Western blotting of total cell lysate using antiphosphorylated-Akt antibody. Cells (4.5 × 106cells/sample) were transfected with 30 μg of β-caseinluciferase (20Mui A.L.-F. Wakao H. O'Farrell A.-M. Harada N. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) or 3 μg of c-fos luciferase (18Watanabe S. Mui A.L.-F. Muto A. Chen J.X. Hayashida K. Miyajima A. Arai K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) plasmids by electroporation as described (18Watanabe S. Mui A.L.-F. Muto A. Chen J.X. Hayashida K. Miyajima A. Arai K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The cells were separated to three groups and incubated with depletion medium for 6 h then stimulated with mIL-3 (1 ng/ml), hGM-CSF (10 ng/ml), or left unstimulated for another 6 h. The sample indicated as random culture was cultured in mIL-3 (0.25 ng/ml)-containing media for 12 h immediately after transfection. The cells were lysed with 20 μl of 250 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, and protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer (model LB9501; Berthold Lumat Co. Ltd., Japan) and a luciferase assay substrate (Promega, Madison, WI). Northern blots were performed with mRNA prepared using the Fast Track 2.0 kit (Invitrogen, CA). Briefly, 1 μg of mRNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde and transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary blotting. The blots were hybridized with cDNA probes (c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, bcl-xL,CIS, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes) labeled by the Ready-To-GoTM kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using [α-32P]dCTP. The blotted membrane was visualized using a FUJI image analyzer (model BAS-2000). To analyze the direct signals from JAK2, we constructed a JAK2 chimera, β/JAK2, in which the extracellular and transmembrane domains of βc were fused to the N terminus of full-length JAK2. The total length of the β/JAK2 is 1580 amino acids (Fig. 1 A). We first examined the expression and size of β/JAK2 in COS7 cells. COS7 cells were harvested after 24 h of culture after transfection of β/JAK2 or wild-type JAK2 as a control, then subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-βc N terminus (S16) or anti-JAK2 antibodies followed by Western blotting using an anti-JAK2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc). A 170–180-kDa band that corresponds to the expected size of β/JAK2 appeared (Fig. 1 B). We next prepared BA/F3 cells stably expressing β/JAK2 (BAFβ/JAK2) and β/JAK2 together with the hGM-CSFR α subunit (BAFα,β/JAK2). The expression of β/JAK2 in BA/F3 cells was confirmed by flow cytometry assay (Fig. 1 C) and Western blotting (Fig.2).Figure 2Phosphorylation of the β/JAK2 in BA/F3 cells. The BAFGMR (BA/F3 cells expressing wild-type hGM-CSFR), BAFβ/JAK2, and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells were depleted of mIL-3 for 6 h, stimulated with mIL-3 or hGM-CSF for 10 min, and subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-JAK2 antibody followed by Western blotting. β/JAK2 and endogenous wild-type JAK2 are indicated by arrows.anti-PTyr, antibody against phosphorylated Tyr.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine the activity of β/JAK2, we first examined tyrosine phosphorylation of β/JAK2 in BA/F3 cells by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting. We used BA/F3 cells expressing wild-type hGM-CSFR (BAFGMR) or parental BA/F3 cells as a control in the following experiments. Fig. 2 shows Western blotting patterns obtained with either an antiphosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) or anti-JAK2 antibodies of anti-JAK2 immunoprecipitants of BAFGMR, BAFβ/JAK2, or BAFα,β/JAK2 cells. The anti-JAK2 antibody immunoprecipitated β/JAK2 as well as the endogenous JAK2, and β/JAK2 was phosphorylated even in the absence of mIL-3 or hGM-CSF in both BAFβ/JAK2 cells and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells. In contrast, endogenous JAK2 was phosphorylated only after mIL-3 stimulation. hGM-CSF stimulation induced phosphorylation of endogenous JAK2 in BAFGMR cells but not in BAFβ/JAK2 or BAFα,β/JAK2 cells. Therefore, β/JAK2 is constitutively phosphorylated in BA/F3 cells regardless of the presence of hGM-CSFR α subunit or hGM-CSF stimulation. In addition, transphosphorylation to endogenous JAK2 from β/JAK2 did not occur. Because there was a constitutive phosphorylation of β/JAK2, we next examined survival and proliferation of the BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells. Fig.3 A shows DNA fragmentation patterns of BAFGMR, BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2 cultured in the absence or presence of mIL-3 or hGM-CSF. As expected, the DNA from BAFGMR cells cultured in growth factor-free media for 12 h was fragmented. When BAFGMR cells were cultured either in mIL-3 or hGM-CSF, no fragmentation was observed. In the case of BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells, only a residual ladder DNA was observed. We next analyzed the proliferation of BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells by [3H]thymidine incorporation analysis. As shown in Fig. 3 B, in BAFGMR, incorporation of [3H]thymidine was not evident in the absence of factor, and incorporation was stimulated in the presence of mIL-3 or hGM-CSF in a dose-dependent manner. Both BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells had a significant level of [3H]thymidine incorporation in the absence of mIL-3 or hGM-CSF. When cells were cultured in mIL-3-containing media, increased [3H]thymidine incorporation occurred in a mIL-3 dose-dependent manner. In contrast, hGM-CSF did not stimulate [3H]thymidine incorporation in BAFβ/JAK2 or in BAFα,β/JAK2 cells. These results indicate that the expression of β/JAK2 supports DNA replication in BA/F3 cell in addition to cell survival. It should be noted that the level of proliferation was less than that observed with mIL-3 stimulation. We then examined long term proliferation of these cells by examining cell number and viability by making use of trypan blue dye exclusion (Fig. 3 C). As expected, the BAFGMR cells all died within one day after mIL-3 depletion (left upper panel). In contrast, more than 70% of BAFβ/JAK2 cells and 90% of BAFα,β/JAK2 cells survived without mIL-3 for at least 4 days. The cell number of BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells constantly increased, but the growth rate was slower than that of the cells cultured in mIL-3. Furthermore, we were able to maintain both BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells in medium containing no mIL-3 for more than four months (data not shown). A role for PI3-K followed by Akt activation in cell survival was reported in various cells. Because we found that both PI3-K and Akt are activated by mIL-3 or hGM-CSF stimulation in BAFGMR cells, 2R. Liu, T. Itoh, and S. Watanabe, unpublished results. we examined whether these kinases are activated in BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells. PI3-K activity co-immunoprecipitated with antiphosphotyrosine antibody was determined by in vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 4 A, residual kinase activity was observed after depletion of mIL-3 for 5 h, and activity was induced by mIL-3 stimulation in all the three cells. Random culture samples showed almost the same level of activity as that of the depleted sample. The addition of hGM-CSF into BAFα,β/JAK2 cells did not affect the PI3-K activity. Akt is assumed to be downstream of PI3-K, and we next analyzed Akt activity by Western blotting using antiphospho-Akt antibody (Fig. 4 B). Consistent with the results of PI3-K, almost no activity was observed from depleted samples of any of the cells. Activity was induced by the addition of mIL-3, and random-cultured samples showed very weak activity in comparison to the depleted cells. Taken together, these results indicate that no constitutive activation of the PI3-K pathway in BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells exists in the absence of factors. We also examined the effect of wortmannin, a PI3-K-specific inhibitor. The addition of wortmannin up to 200 nm, which completely suppressed the GM-CSF-induced activation of PI3-K and Akt in BAFGMR cells, did not show any inhibitory effect on factor-independent proliferation of BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells (data not shown), further eliminating the possible involvement of this pathway within these cells. To examine whether cellular proteins are phosphorylated in BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells, we did Western blot analysis of total cell lysates using antiphosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 5 A). Cells were depleted of mIL-3 for 6 h and restimulated by mIL-3 or hGM-CSF for 10 min. In all the cells, the addition of mIL-3 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of various cellular proteins. Random-cultured cells in the presence of mIL-3 showed significant tyrosine phosphorylation in every cell lines. In contrast, although BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells grew in the absence of factors, no significant tyrosine-phosphorylated band was observed. We previously found that STAT5, Shc, and SHP-2 are tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to hGM-CSF in BA/F3 cells expressing hGM-CSFR, and this phosphorylation requires the tyrosine residues of βc (14Itoh T. Muto A. Watanabe S. Miyajima A. Yokota T. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7587-7592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Itoh T. Liu R. Yokota T. Arai K. Watanabe S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 742-752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We analyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation of these molecules in both BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting. When BA/F3 cells were depleted of mIL-3 for 5 h, no residual phosphorylation of STAT5 was observed, and the STAT5 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to mIL-3, in accord with our previous reports (Fig. 5 B). In BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells, no phosphorylation of STAT5 was observed with samples of factor-depleted cells. The addition of hGM-CSF induced little tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 in BAFα,β/JAK2 cells. Because tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 is transient, it is possible that phosphorylation of STAT5 is not observed with unsynchronized cells. We examined the state of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 from random-cultured BA/F3 cells. STAT5 is weakly but significantly tyrosine-phosphorylated within the sample of random-cultured cells, thus indicating that β/JAK2 cannot phosphorylate STAT5 in the absence of mIL-3 in BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells. Although both BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells grew without mIL-3, tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 was never observed. Similarly, we analyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and SHP-2 by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting under the same conditions used for STAT5. Both Shc and SHP-2 were phosphorylated by mIL-3 stimulation in all the cells, and weak phosphorylation was observed in the random-cultured BA/F3 cells. In contrast, in mIL-3-depleted BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells, neither Shc nor SHP-2 was phosphorylated. A positive role for the activation of Shc and SHP-2 in the MAPK pathway was proposed (15Itoh T. Liu R. Yokota T. Arai K. Watanabe S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 742-752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results suggested that neither STAT5 nor MAPK pathway is required for survival and proliferation of BA/F3 cells in this system. To determine whether STAT5 and MAPK pathways are functionally defective in BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells, we further analyzed the activities of β-casein and c-fos promoters, assumed to be targets of STAT5 and the MAPK cascade, respectively (21Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). A transient transfection analysis was made using β-caseinor c-fos promoters fused to the luciferase-coding region. Luciferase activity of random-cultured cells, factor-depleted cells, and factor restimulated cells was examined. As shown in Fig.6 A, the β-caseinluciferase activity was induced about 5-fold in all the cells after depletion and readdition of mIL-3. The β-casein luciferase activity of random-cultured BA/F3 cells showed higher luciferase activity than was observed in mIL-3 restimulated cells. In contrast, hGM-CSF stimulation did not induce the activity of β-casein luciferase in BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells. These results are consistent with those observed in experiments examining tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5. We suggest that constitutively activated β/JAK2 does not activate STAT5 in BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells. Similarly, c-fosluciferase activity in unstimulated BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells was significantly lower than that observed in cells subjected to mIL-3 stimulation (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, thec-fos luciferase activity of random-cultured BA/F3 cells was higher than that in cells stimulated with mIL-3. We previously found that immediate early genes, c-fos, c-jun, bcl-x L, and c-myc are activated either by mIL-3 or hGM-CSF stimulation in BA/F3 cells. For c-fos and c-jun gene activation, the membrane distal region of βc is required in addition to the membrane proximal region. In contrast, c-mycactivation requires only the membrane proximal region, and this requirement is the same as that required for cell proliferation. To analyze whether these genes are activated or not in BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells, we performed Northern blot analysis. Factor-depleted cells were restimulated for 30 min for c-fos, c-jun, and CIS analysis and for 3 h for c-myc and bcl-x Lanalysis. As shown in Fig. 6 C, by 6 h of mIL-3 depletion, levels of c-fos, c-jun,bcl-x L, and CIS fell to background levels, and mIL-3-induced these genes in all the three cells. In contrast, even after mIL-3 depletion, the level of c-mycexpression remained significantly higher in BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells than in the parental BA/F3 cells. These results indicate that c-myc transcription is selectively activated by the constitutively active β/JAK2 molecule. In the present study, we found that activation of JAK2 using a chimeric β/JAK2 supports long term survival and proliferation of BA/F3 cells in the absence of mIL-3. Chimeric JAK2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated constitutively in BA/F3 cells regardless of the presence of hGM-CSFR α subunit or hGM-CSF. Similar to the model proposed for the receptor-type tyrosine kinase (22Ullich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar), JAKs are assumed to be activated by homodimer formation followed by transphosphorylation by JAKs themselves (2Ihle J. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 3Watanabe S. Arai K. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1996; 6: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of β/JAK2 in the present work may occur through constitutive dimer formation of the β/JAK2. We reported that hGM-CSF receptor β subunit forms a dimer even in the absence of hGM-CSF in BA/F3 cells and that the cytoplasmic region of βc is not required for this dimer formation (10Muto A. Watanabe S. Miyajima A. Yokota T. Arai K. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1911-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although attempts to show the presence of a dimer form of β/JAK2 using a chemical cross-linker were not successful (data not shown), we speculate that the chimeric β/JAK2 forms a dimer through transmembrane and extracellular regions of βc. Analyses using mutant receptors as well as mutant JAKs showed an essential role of JAK2 in the IL-3 and GM-CSF signaling pathway (5Watanabe S. Itoh T. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12681-12686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The JAK2 knock-out mice revealed the essential role of JAK2 for IL-3 signals in vivo (7Parganas E. Wang D. Stravopodis D. Topham D.J. Marine J.-C. Teglund S. Vanin E.F. Bodner S. Colamonici O.R. van Deursen J.M. Grosveld G. Ihle J.N.

Cell. 1998; 93: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Our initial idea to isolate the activity of JAK2 was based on the finding that there are several activities of hGM-CSF that require JAK2 activation but not the C-terminal region of βc. During mutation analysis of βc, we found distinct signaling pathways of hGM-CSFR (13Watanabe S. Muto A. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Arai K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 983-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The signaling pathway that requires the receptor C terminus region was initiated by phosphorylation of βc tyrosine residues, and then a cascade of signaling molecules such as the MAPK pathway by protein-protein interactions followed. STAT activation also requires tyrosine residues, because it is assumed that STAT binds to phosphorylated tyrosine through its SH2 domain. On the other hand, there are signaling pathways that require only JAK2 activation through the box1 region but not the receptor tyrosine residues, leading to cell survival, cell proliferation, and c-myc activation. The only event that is constitutively activated in BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2 cells was c-myc transcription. Taken together, an important role for c-myc in cell survival and proliferation is strongly suggested. In the present work, the activation of JAK2 occurred without involvement of the cytoplasmic region of βc. β/JAK2 transduces signals for cell survival and weak proliferation. We previously revealed that a mutant βc lacking all the tyrosines that cannot activate STAT5 or the MAPK cascade is still capable of maintaining cell survival and weak but significant proliferation. In addition, we recently found that PI3-K and Akt activation induced by IL-3 or GM-CSF does not play an essential role in cell survival in BA/F3 cells,2 which is consistent with the current observation that no induction of PI3-K and Akt occurs in BAFβ/JAK2 and BAFα,β/JAK2. Taken together, it is strongly suggested that activation of the MAPK and PI3-K cascades as well as STAT5 by cytokines is not essential for survival and proliferation of BA/F3 cells. We constructed and analyzed another type of chimeric JAK2 using Gyrase B as an artificial dimerizer (23Farrar M.A. Alberola-Ila J. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 24Mohi M.G. Arai K. Watanabe S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3299-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). With this fusion protein of Gyrase B and JAK2 (GyrB/JAK2), which is assumed to be inducibly dimerized by binding to the chemical compound coumermycin, we obtained different results from β/JAK2. The addition of coumermycin results in activation of this chimeric JAK2 molecule and induces phosphorylation of STAT5 but does not support long term survival, proliferation, and MAPK cascade activation of BA/F3 cells. It is of interest that phosphorylation of STAT5 and proliferation are antiparallel events in GyrB/JAK2 and β/JAK2. This finding supports the notion that STAT5 may not be involved in signaling for proliferation or survival of BA/F3 cells. The different activities of these chimeras may be explained by differences in subcellular localization of these molecules, because GyrB/JAK2 may exclusively locate in cytoplasm, and β/JAK2 is the transmembrane protein. There are other examples of JAK2 fusions with transmembrane molecules such as the EGF receptor and the erythropoietin receptor (25Nakamura N. Chin H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19483-19488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 26Joneja B. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11176-11184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In both cases, the chimeras can mediate proliferative signaling without activating the MAPK cascade. Finally, naturally occurring TEL-JAK2 fusion proteins, as a result of chromosomal translocations, have been found via patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia and are assumed to cause malignancy within hematopoietic cells (27Lacronique V. Boureux A. Della Valle V. Poirel H. Quang C.T. Mauchauffe M. Berthou C. Lessard M. Berger R. Ghysdael J. Bernard O.A.

Marynen P. Blood. 1997; 90: 2535-2540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TEL-JAK2 exhibits constitutive tyrosine kinase activity, and its expression confers mIL-3-independent proliferation to BA/F3 cells, yet the molecular pathways that mediate the signals from this molecule remain to be clarified. Further studies using our β/JAK2 chimera may help gain an insight into the mechanism of JAK2 signaling in hematopoiesis as well as in leukemogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2051540693,"α-Dystrobrevin, the mammalian orthologue of theTorpedo 87-kDa postsynaptic protein, is a dystrophin-associated and dystrophin-related protein. Knockout of the gene in the mouse results in muscular dystrophy. The control of the α-dystrobrevin gene in the various tissues is therefore of interest. Multiple dystrobrevin isoforms differing in their domain content are generated by alternative splicing of a single gene. The data presented here demonstrate that expression of α-dystrobrevin from three promoters, that are active in a tissue-selective manner, also plays a role in the function of the protein in different tissues. The most proximal promoter A is active in brain and to a lesser extent in lung, whereas the most distal promoter B, which possesses several Sp1 binding sites, is restricted to brain. Promoter C, which contains multiple consensus myogenic binding sites, is up-regulated during in vitro myoblast differentiation. Interestingly, the organization and the activity of the α-dystrobrevin promoters is reminiscent of those in the dystrophin gene. Taken together we suggest that the multipromoter system, distributed over a region of 270 kilobases at the 5′-end of the α-dystrobrevin gene, has been developed to allow the regulation of this gene in different cell types and/or different developmental stages. α-Dystrobrevin, the mammalian orthologue of theTorpedo 87-kDa postsynaptic protein, is a dystrophin-associated and dystrophin-related protein.

Dystrobrevin, a dystrophin related protein, was originally identified from the Torpedo californica electric organ as an 87-kDa phosphoprotein associated with the cytoplasmic face of the postsynaptic membrane (1Carr C. Fischbach G.D. Cohen J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1753-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 2Wagner K.R. Cohen J.B. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1993; 10: 511-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The protein is expressed in the electric organ, skeletal muscle, and brain, and it has been postulated to play a role in synaptic structure and function, because it copurifies with the acetylcholine receptors and rapsyn from the electric organ membranes. The protein is concentrated with the acetylcholine receptors at the synapse, but it is also found extrasynaptically at the sarcolemma of both Torpedo electric organ and vertebrate muscle. Furthermore, dystrobrevin is also found in association with dystrophin and the 58-kDa syntrophins in the Torpedo electric organ (3Kramarcy N.R. Vidal A. Froehner S.C. Sealock R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2870-2876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,4Dwyer T.M. Froehner S.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). By contrast to the single known Torpedo dystrobrevin molecule, cDNAs encoding several different isoforms differing in their domain content and tissue distribution have been identified in both human and mouse (5Blake D.J.

Genet. 1996; 5: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The longest isoform, α-dystrobrevin-1 (94 kDa), has a tyrosine kinase substrate domain similar to theTorpedo protein (2Wagner K.R. Cohen J.B. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1993; 10: 511-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 5Blake D.J. Nawrotzki R. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Davies K.E. J. Biol.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 11-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and two predicted α-helical-coiled coil domains (9Blake D.J. Tinsley J.M. Davies K.E. Knight A.E. Winder S.J. Kendrick-Jones J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 133-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which it shares with α-dystrobrevin-2, while α-dystrobrevin-3 has simply the ZZ-domain. The genetic basis of this isoform diversity and additional alternative splicing was resolved by the determination of the genomic organization of the coding region of a single gene on mouse chromosome 18 (6Ambrose H.J. Blake D.J. Nawrotzki R.A. Davies K.E. Genomics. 1997; 39: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The conservation of the genomic organization between dystrophin and α-dystrobrevin is maintained across the homologous CRCT, 1The abbreviations used are: CRCT, cysteine-rich carboxyl-terminal domain; 5′-UTR, 5′-untranslated region; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s); YAC, yeast artificial chromosome; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; MED-1, multiple start site element; MEF-1, myocytespecific enhancing factor 1; M-CAT, muscle-CAT heptamer CATTCCT. indicating that both genes evolved from an ancestral duplication event (10Roberts R.G. Brobrow M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Considerable evidence supports an association of dystrophin and α-dystrobrevin. Dystrophin and α-dystrobrevin colocalize in skeletal muscle, copurify biochemically, and associate directlyin vitro via the coiled-coil region of dystrophin (11Nawrotzki R. Loh N.Y. Ruegg M.A. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2595-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Metzinger L. Blake D.J. Squier M.V. Anderson L.V. Deconinck A.E. Nawrotzki R. Hilton-Jones D.

A. 1997; 94: 12413-12418Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The expression pattern of the α-dystrobrevin gene also closely parallels that of dystrophin, where a set of diverse isoforms are generated in vivo by alternative splicing in brain and muscle. Dystrophin expression in muscle and brain results in three 14-kb transcripts (muscle-type, brain-type, and Purkinje cell-type), controlled by promoters at the 5′-end of the gene (14Nudel U. Zuk D. Einat P. Zeelon E. Levy Z. Neuman S. Yaffe D. Nature. 1989; 337: 76-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 15Gorecki D.C. Monaco A.P. Derry J.M. Walker A.P. Barnard E.A. Barnard P.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1992; 1: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In addition, a whole family of smaller mRNAs are transcribed from promoters lying between exons within the rod domain of the gene. The first of these transcripts designated Dp71 (apodystrophin-1) and apodystrophin-3, encode the CRCT, or the first part of the CRCT, respectively, and are expressed predominantly in brain and non-muscle tissues from a housekeeping like promoter (16Blake D.J.

Davies K.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Other smaller transcripts are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, such as in peripheral nerve (Dp116, Ref. 18Byers T.J. Lidov H.G.W. Kunkel L.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), the retina, brain, and cardiac muscle (Dp260, Ref. 19D'Souza V.N. thi Man N. Morris G.E. Karges W. Pillers D.M. Ray P.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and throughout the central nervous system (Dp140, Ref. 20Lidov H.G.W. Selig S. Kunkel L.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In view of the similarity between dystrophin and α-dystrobrevin, and the recent evidence that mice null for α-dystrobrevin suffer from muscular dystrophy and impaired aggregation of acetylcholine receptors (21Zhou H. Grady R.M. Sanes J.R. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1998; 24: 1534Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine the regulation of this gene. Our preliminary evidence indicated a minimum of four 5′-UTR exons, suggesting that the regulation of the α-dystrobrevin gene might be as complex as dystrophin. While in the process of investigating whether particular α-dystrobrevin isoforms are associated with a specific 5′-UTR region, we identified additional 5′-UTR exon sequences, consistent with a regulation of expression by multiple promoters. Here we present evidence that the mouse 5′-region of the gene is composed of seven 5′-UTR exons covering 270 kb of genomic DNA and demonstrate that α-dystrobrevin is expressed from three promoters that are active in a tissue-selective manner. Our data suggest that this multipromoter system of the α-dystrobrevin gene has been developed to allow the regulation of this gene in different cell types and/or different developmental stages. To determine the order and estimate the distance between the 5′-UTR exons, a BAC (mouse 129/sv) genomic library was screened (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) by a PCR approach using primer sets specific for the 5′-UTR exon A (RnpAf, 5′-GGGGGAAAAGAATCTGACTCTGT-3′; RnpAr, 5′-CTGCTTTTGTAGTTCACGCAC-3′), exonB (RnpBf, 5′-GTGCGTGCGCGTCCGTGG-3′; RnpBr, 5′-CTCGCCAAACTCTTAGAAGGTG-3′), exonC (RnpCf, 5′-GCATCTGCCAGTGGGACTTC-3′; RnpCr, 5′-CCAGGTACAGCATCCTTTCTTC-3′), exon D (UTRDf1, 5′-GATAAATAGGATTTACAAGCC-3′; UTRDr, 5′-GAAGAGACAGCATGGACTTT-3′); and coding exon3 (DB3f, 5′-ACATAGAACTCAACGTGGCC-3′; DB3r1, 5′-GTGGATTTGGTGAGTGGTTG-3′). Selected BAC clones, which were positive for more than one exon, were isolated and further analyzed. To establish a rare–cutter restriction enzyme map, 0.25 μg of mBAC DNA was digested with MluI,NotI, SalI, and XhoI and separated on a 1% agarose gel using the FIGE Mapper Electrophoresis System (Bio-Rad). After transfer to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the DNA was probed sequentially with exon-specific oligonucleotide sequences derived from the UTR exons A–G and coding exon 1 (UTRAf, 5′-CGGAAGAGTTAGAGGCATGTTG-3′; UTRBf, 5′-GGTGACACAGGCGCCGGTCC-3′; UTRCf, 5′-TGGCTAAATCTGTTCTCCCATG-3′; UTRDf2, 5′-GTCTTCAAATGCCACAGTCAGC-3′; DB1s, 5′-GATTGAAGATAGTGGAAAAAGAGG-3′; UTREf1, UTRFf1, UTRGf1, see Fig.1). To isolate genomic DNA upstream and downstream of the 5′-UTR exons E, F, and G, which were detected in a minority of α-dystrobrevin cDNAs, a YAC vectorette library of the YAC clone ICRFy902M0312Q was screened by PCR using hemi-nested primer sets made from the sequences of exon E, F, and G (see Fig. 1) and a universal vectorette primer as described previously (6Ambrose H.J. Blake D.J. Nawrotzki R.A. Davies K.E. Genomics. 1997; 39: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Vectorette PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced using Sp6 and T7 primers. Splice junction sequences were determined by nucleotide alignment of genomic sequence to the cDNA sequence using BESTFIT and GAP (Genetics Computer Group, version 8.0; Madison, WI). RNA extraction, Northern blots, and RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (22Blake D.J. Schofield J.N. Zuellig R.A. Gorecki D.C. Phelps S.R. Barnard E.A. Edwards Y.H.

Genomic regions spanning the most 5′-end exons A, B, and C, and their adjacent 5′-flanking sequences were amplified by PCR using the primer sets RnpAf/RnpAr for exon A, RnpBf/RnpBr for exon B, and RnpCf/RnpCr for exon C, subloned into pGEM-T, and used to generate cRNA probes. 1 μg of denaturated total RNA from mouse tissues or cultured cells was converted into first strand cDNA with Expand Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). 2 μl of diluted first strand reactions (1:5 in water) were used in 50 μl of PCR reactions, performed under standard conditions using Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). UTR exon containing transcripts were amplified using oligonucleotides derived from exons A–G (UTRAf–Gf) and an oligonucleotide derived from exon 3 (DB3r2, 5′-CGTTCCAAATGTCCACCAGG-3′). Transcripts encoding different α-dystrobrevin isoforms were amplified by PCR using a common oligonucleotide derived from exon 8 (DB8f, 5′-CCTGAGCTGTGCTTCCAGCCGTG-3′) and oligonucleotides specific for α-dystrobrevin-1 (DB21r, 5′-AGGCAGATGCTGAACGGATG-3′), α-dystrobrevin-2 (DB18r, 5′-AGCAATGAGAAGGTCAGCAGGAC-3′), and α-dystrobrevin-3 (DB11r, 5′-TCATGTTATCCATCTAGACGC-3′). PCR products were detected by Southern hybridization with an oligonucleotide derived from exon 1 (DB1s) or a 416-bpNsiI/HindIII fragment of the m32 cDNA clone (5Blake D.J. Nawrotzki R. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Davies K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7802-7810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). 5′-RACE was carried out using the 5′ AmpliFINDER RACE kit (CLONTECH). 1 μg of poly(A)+RNA isolated from mouse tissues was reverse transcribed using a primer derived from exon 6 (DB6r, 5′-TGCAGAAGAGGCAGCCATACC-3′). The anchor ligated cDNA was then PCR amplified using the anchor primer and the internal primer derived from exon 3 (DB3r2,). PCR-products were cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega), and the largest were sequenced using Sequenase v2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) The sequences of 20 exon A-, B-, or C-containing clones were aligned using PILE UP (Genetics Computer Group, version 8.0; Madison, WI). Mouse genomic DNA and the primer set ProAf/ProAr (5′-CGCGGATCCTCCAGTGAGGGAAGGCAG-3′, 5′-CGCGGATCCCTCTAACTCTTCCGCAG-3′) was used to amplify a 1068-bp product spanning the 858-bp flanking region and the first 210 bp of exon A. Accordingly, a 666-bp product, including the 528-bp flanking region, and the first 138 bp of exon B and a 1169-bp product spanning the 994-bp flanking region and the first 175 bp of exon C were amplified using the primer set ProBf/ProB (5′-CGAAGATCTGATAGGCAACCACTGCACAC-3′, 5′-CGAAGATCTTGCAGGGAGGTGTGGGCC-3′) and ProCf/ProCr (5′-CGCGGATCCCAGACTGATTGGGACATGTG-3′, 5′-CGCGGATCCTTTAGTTCCAGTTCATCTAGAG-3′). After digestion with BamHI or BglII, the PCR products were subcloned into the BglII site of the pGL-3 basic vector. H-2Kb-tsA58 cells (23Morgan J.E. Beauchamp J.R. Pagel C.N. Peckham M. Ataliotis P.

Myoblast fusion was induced by culturing the cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% horse serum and 1% chicken embryo extract (differentiation medium) at 39 °C in 10% CO2. H-2Kb-tsA58 myoblasts at approximately 40% confluence were transiently transfected with 2 μg of luciferase transporter construct and 0.5 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid (Promega) using Superfect protocol (Qiagen). The cells to be maintained as myoblasts were incubated in growth medium throughout the experiment, whereas cells to be differentiated into myotubes were switched to differentiation medium after reaching 80% confluence (usually within 24 h). Cells were harvested 72 h after the start of transfection. NIH3T3 cells were transfected in the same manner and harvested 60 h after the start of transfection. Each transfection was performed in triplicate and repeated twice. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested into 200 μl of Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega). Cell extract (20 μl) was mixed with 100 μl luciferase assay reagent (Promega) and light production quantified using a Turner Designs Model 20 luminometer. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using an enzyme assay system (Promega) and then analyzed using a spectrophotometer at 420 nm. Western blots using the primary antibody β-CT-FP (diluted 1:1000) and Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, donkey anti-mouse (diluted 1:5000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) were performed as described previously (24Blake D.J.

We have described multiple transcripts for mouse α-dystrobrevin that encode three protein isoforms (5Blake D.J. Nawrotzki R. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Davies K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7802-7810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 6Ambrose H.J. Blake D.J. Nawrotzki R.A. Davies K.E.

Some of these transcripts differed in their 5′-UTRs, suggesting that they may be by alternative splicing of different 5′-exons, indicative of transriptional regulation by multiple promoters. To determine the origin of these transcripts and the mechanism of α-dystrobrevin expression, we characterized genomic fragments covering the 5′-end of the gene. We have reported previously the exon-intron boundaries of four UTR exons A–D, derived from different cDNA clones. Here, 5′-UTR sequences have been extended to their 5′-ends by sequencing of RACE products of the dystrobrevin mRNAs from mouse heart and brain. A PCR approach on a YAC vectorette library of the YAC clone ICRFy902M0312Q positive for the dystrobrevin gene was used to clone three additional 5′-UTR exons and determine their exon-intron boundaries (Fig.1). Exon sizes and splice junctions sequences of all seven 5′-UTR exons are summarized in TableI. The splice junctions have the conserved GT and AG dinucleotides present at the 5′ splice donor and 3′ splice acceptor sites (25Shapiro M.B. Senapathy P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7155-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar). The three most upstream exons, exons A, B, and C, are all of similar size and are larger than the internal exonsD–G. Mapping of the 640-kb YAC clone ICRFy902M0312Q indicated that the maximum distance between the UTR exons is approximately 270 kb. To determine the order and estimate the distance between the UTR exons, a mouse BAC genomic library was screened using primer pairs for all 5′-UTR exons and the coding exon 3. This resulted in the isolation of three overlapping BACs, two of which (BAC 343 and BAC 547) had insert sizes of 170 and 140 kb and contained the first coding exon, UTR exons A and D. The third BAC, with an insert size of 160 kb, contained the other five UTR exons: exons C, G, E, F, and B. Fig. 2 A shows the approximate positions of the seven UTR exons spanning a distance of approximately 270 kb relative to the 25 coding exons of the gene.Table IExon-intron boundaries of the α-dystrobrevin 5′-UTR exonsExon Name3′-Splice acceptor siteExon/intron boundaries5′-Splice donor siteFirst baseExon sizeLast baseUTRAAGTCTTTT−243242−2AAAAGCAGgtaaggtc…UTRBGCTTCAGG−35223−129ATTGCAAGgtgtgtgt…UTRCGTTAAAGA−338209−129GGTCCAGGgtaagtga…UTRD…cattacagATAAATAG−128127−2AATTTTAGgtgagtgc…UTRE…tcttcaagGCCCCAGA128−129CCTGGCTGgtatgtac…UTRF…ttttttagATGCTGGT93−129CACTCCAGgtcagtga…UTRG…tggtgcagGTACTTTC53−129TAGGGTTGgtaggtag…Lowercase letters indicate the intron sequences; uppercase letters indicate exon sequences. Nucleotide positions of start and end of individual exons are relative to the translational start site of the α-dystrobrevin gene (6Ambrose H.J. Blake D.J. Nawrotzki R.A. Davies K.E.

Nucleotide positions of start and end of individual exons are relative to the translational start site of the α-dystrobrevin gene (6Ambrose H.J. Blake D.J. Nawrotzki R.A. Davies K.E. Genomics. 1997; 39: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the seven 5′-UTR exons to the sequences of 5′-RACE products from brain and heart revealed a complex pattern of alternative splicing. As indicated in Fig. 2 B, exon A was spliced directly to exon 1, the first protein-coding exon, while both exon B and exon C were separated from exon 1 by a further exon, exon D. In a minority of RACE clones, one or the other of three additional 5′-UTR exons, exons E, F, and G, were spliced between exons B and D. All RACE clones were identical in sequence downstream of exon 1. These results suggest that the different dystrobrevin transcripts are generated by differential usage of three promoters. Twenty RACE clones for each type of end-terminal UTR exon (exons A, B, and C) were sequenced and provide an indication of the location of transcriptional start sites. The majority of the exon A-positive clones terminated 239 bp upstream of the 3′-end of exon A. By contrast, RACE clones positive for exon B and exon C ended at several different points, but in each case there was a cluster of clones. Thus for exon B clones terminated at nucleotide −95, −110, −121, −128, −134, −142, −148, −197, and −200, where the 3′-end of the exon is designated as −1. Similarly transcription initiation sites were identified at nucleotide positions −121, −146, −171, −185, amd −209 for exon C. In all three populations of RACE clones we did not find any clones that were spliced within these regions. Moreover, there are no multiple AG sequences to serve as splice acceptor sites. To confirm the location of the cap sites for the various α-dystrobrevin mRNAs, three genomic probes were constructed and used in the RNase protection assay. Probe A was a 299-bp PCR fragment of exon A and its 5′-flanking region. Using this probe, a major 243-bp fragment was protected by mRNA from mouse brain, heart, lung, and skeletal muscle. Additionally, a second product at 170 bp was also evident, albeit at very low intensity, indicating that this fragment might reflect a minor transcription start site (Fig.3). By contrast probe B, a 268-bp PCR fragment of exon B and its 5′-flanking region, revealed multiple protected products ranging in size from 223 to 109 bp. None of these fragments were protected by mRNA from lung or muscle. Using a 258-bp PCR fragment of exon C and its 5′-flanking region revealed major protected products at 209, 195, 164, and 135 bp. Interestingly, the intensity of the 135-bp protected fragment was significantly higher in skeletal muscle than in all the other tissues. This protected fragment probably reflects a preferentially used cap site for α-dystrobrevin mRNAs in skeletal muscle. Weak muscle-specific products at 183 and 175 bp were also detected. In summary, multiple transcription start sites for all three promoters were detected. To identify putative regulatory promoter elements that flank the most upstream 5′-UTR exons, we sequenced a 858-, 528-, and 994-bp upstream of exons A, B, and C, respectively (Fig.4). In common with other genes with multiple transcription start sites, no typical TATA or CAAT box was present in the most distal promoter B region. However, we found the motif GCTCCC downstream of the ∼100-bp multiple start site window, which is identical to a conserved downstream element defining a new subclass of RNA-polymerase II promoters (26Ince T.A. Scotto K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30249-30252Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Computer-assisted analysis revealed several putative transription factor binding sites including Sp1 and Ap2. The promoter C sequence also contained no TATA box in the first 100 bp, although a CAAT box consensus was observed at nucleotide −337. Interestingly, we identified multiple sequences within a 370-bp region known to mediate skeletal and cardiac muscle expression of a number of genes. These include four conserved MEF-1 motifs (27Buskin J. Hauschka S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2627-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) at −294, −234, −150, and −48, a TGCCTGG motif at −363 (28Baldwin T.J. Burden S.J. Nature. 1989; 341: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and a M-CAT motif at −30 (29Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4271-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), where the most distal cap site is designated as +1. Examination of the most proximal promoter A sequence did not reveal a consensus TATA box or binding sites for common transcription factors such as Sp1 or CAAT factors, and the sequence was not GC-rich. The major initiation site is located within a pyrimidine-rich sequence, TTTTGTCAGTCTTTT (cap site underlined). This sequence is similar to the initiator (Inr) consensus sequence, 5′-PydPyd-CA-PydPydPydPydPyd, that can direct specific transcription initiation in TATA less and non-GC-rich promoters (30Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). Several putative transcription factor sites, inclucding AP1 and PuF, were found within the promoter A sequence. Genomic fragments containing the putative promoter regions A, B, and C (Fig. 4) were cloned upstream of the luciferase gene. These constructs were then transiently transfected into the mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 and mouse myogenic H2K-tsA58 cell lines. All constructs directed luciferase expression in NIH3T3 cells (Fig.5 A). The level of luciferase activity produced by the constructs containing sequences of the 5′-flanking regions of exon B and exon C was substantially higher in forward (Bf and Cf) than in reverse orientation (Br and Cr). The promoter strength of the construct Bf was comparable with the activity of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter used as a control. The construct Cf was about 3-fold stronger than this promoter. The 5′-flanking region of exon A showed orientation-independent expression in this cell line and was excluded from further analysis. To investigate the effect of myoblast differentiation on α-dystrobrevin expression, we transfected the aforementioned constructs into H2K-tsA58 myoblasts and analyzed luciferase activity in total cell extracts prepared from H2K-tsA58 muscle cells at different time points during myoblast fusion. The construct Cf exhibited higher luciferase activity in myotubes than in undifferentiated myoblasts, with a ∼200-fold increase in differentiated H2K-tsA58 myotubes over that obtained with the promoter construct Bf (Fig. 5 B), which showed similar low levels of activity in myoblasts and myotubes. Luciferase activities in extracts of cells transfected with a construct containing the same region in reverse orientation (Cr and Br) and a promoterless pGL-3 basic vector are shown as negative controls. In order to determine the endogenous transcription pattern of α-dystrobrevin in the H2K-tsA58 cell line, total RNA was isolated from myoblast cultures at various stages of differentiation. First, the differential usage of 5′-UTR sequences was investigated by RT-PCR using UTR exon-specific forward primers and a common reverse primer in exon 3. PCR products were detected by hybridization to an oligonucleotide probe derived from exon 1. Little or no exon A or exon B containing transcripts could be detected in this cell line at the different time points tested (Fig. 6 A). By contrast, levels of exon C-containing transcripts increased steadily from very low levels at the nonconfluent myoblast stage to higher levels in cultures containing differentiated multinucleated myotubes. A 370-bp amplification product of utrophin was present at all different time points at similar levels, indicating that its expression was not affected during myogenesis (11Nawrotzki R. Loh N.Y. Ruegg M.A. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2595-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether exon C-containing transcripts encode all three α-dystrobrevin isoforms, we performed RT-PCR using a common forward primer and isoform-specific reverse primers. Southern blot analysis of the PCR products using a radiolabeled m32 cDNA probe (5Blake D.J. Nawrotzki R. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Davies K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7802-7810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) revealed single bands for all three dystrobrevin isoforms in proliferating myoblasts (Fig. 6 B). After switching to differentiation medium, the level of α-dystrobrevin-3 (Fig. 6 B,α-db-3) increases and then stabilizes as myoblast fusion proceeds. In the case of α-dystrobrevin-1 (Fig. 6 B,α-db-1) and -2 (Fig. 6 B, α-db-2), an additional u"

Glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) transport by UhpT is inactivated if cysteine replaces either Asp388 or Lys391 but not if both are replaced. This suggests that Asp388 and Lys391 are involved in an intrahelical salt bridge and that neither is required for normal UhpT function. This interpretation is strengthened by the finding that mutations at Lys391 (K391N, K391Q, and K391T) are recovered as revertants of the inactive D388C variant. Further work shows that although the D388C variant is null for G6P transport, movement of32Pi by homologous Pi/Pi exchange is unaffected. This raises the possibility that this derivative may have latent function, a possibility confirmed by showing that D388C is a gain-of-function mutation in which phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is the preferred substrate. Added study of the Pi/Pi exchange shows that in wild type UhpT this partial reaction is readily blocked by G6P but not PEP. By contrast, in the D388C variant, Pi/Piexchange is unaffected by G6P but is inhibited by both PEP and 3-phosphoglycerate. These latter substrates are used by PgtP, a related Pi-linked antiporter, which lacks the Asp388-Lys391 salt bridge but has instead an uncompensated arginine at position 391. For this reason, we conclude that in both UhpT and PgtP position 391 can serve as a determinant of substrate selectivity by acting as a receptor for the anionic carboxyl brought into the translocation pathway by PEP.

This well characterized transporter is one of a class of secondary transport systems that together form the Major Facilitator Superfamily (4Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 708-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), the largest known collection of related secondary transporters. Although members of the Major Facilitator Superfamily show great diversity in their substrate specificity and kinetic mechanism, they all share a common structural theme, one characterized by the presence of approximately 12 transmembrane segments thought to transverse the membrane in an α-helical conformation. Direct information as to the arrangement of these helices is limited, although several potential models have been formulated in specific cases (7Goswitz V.C. Brooker R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 8Venkatesan P. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One approach to the analysis of helix packing in membrane proteins involves identification of interacting charged residues in transmembrane helices. Ordinarily, one expects the presence of an uncompensated electric charge to be highly destabilizing to such structures, due to the low dielectric of the hydrophobic environment. However, this circumstance can be mitigated if oppositely charged amino acids are brought together to form an ion pair or salt bridge (10Rashin A.A. Honig B. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 173: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 11Honig B.H. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5412-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The idea that such a salt bridge may stabilize secondary structure has both theoretical and experimental support (11Honig B.H. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This approach led to identification of an intrahelical ion pairing involving Asp388 and Lys391 in TM11. 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane segment; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PGA, phosphoglyceric acid; 2DG6P, 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane segment; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PGA, phosphoglyceric acid; 2DG6P, 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.Further study indicated that this salt bridge is essential for proper UhpT function and that at least one member of this pair, Lys391, can play a direct role in determining substrate specificity. Strain XL1-Blue (recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi1 hsdR17 supE44 relA1 lac (F′ proAB lacI q ZΔM15 Tn10)) (Stratagene Cloning Systems) was used for all cloning steps.

Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3546-3555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) served as host for tests of expression and function of plasmid-encoded UhpT and its derivatives. Plasmids pBS281 and pTrc(HisC6S) encoded wild type UhpT and a histidine-tagged cysteine-less UhpT, respectively (20Tamai E. Fann M.-C. Tsuchiya T. Maloney P.C. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). 2J. A. Hall, M.-C. Fann, and P. C. Maloney, unpublished results.pTrc(HisC6S) was constructed by replacing the six cysteines found in UhpT with serine residues (21Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).1 Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using either sequential polymerase chain reaction (22Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Morton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6770) Google Scholar) or by the method of Kunkel (23Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). Mutant uhpT alleles were sequenced using the Sequenase (v. 2.0) reaction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to confirm the desired mutation and rule out the presence of other changes. Strain RK5000 carrying a pTrc(HisC6S) derivative encoding the D388C mutation was grown overnight at 37 °C in LB broth containing F6P (0.15%) and ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Overnight cultures were washed and resuspended in an equal volume of M63 minimal medium salts (24Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431Google Scholar), and 0.1-ml aliquots were plated on M63 minimal plates containing thiamine (2 μg/ml), required amino acids (each 50 μg/ml), ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and F6P (0.15%) as a carbon source. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4–5 days, after which colonies arising from the background lawn were picked and restreaked on minimal plates to isolate single colonies. To ensure that growth was due to suppressor mutation(s) in uhpT, candidate plasmids were isolated, anduhpT was excised at its flanking restriction sites by digestion with NcoI and NgoMI. The uhpT gene was reinserted into a parental vector, which was then used to transform strain RK5000 to confirm the original phenotype. In most cases, the phenotype traveled with uhpT, and in these instances the gene was completely sequenced to identify the responsible mutation(s). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using cell extracts without preheating in sample buffer (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205506) Google Scholar). Protein was transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with a peptide-directed rabbit polyclonal antibody reactive to a UhpT C-terminal epitope (26Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual.

Western blots were developed using chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and after scanning the films, UhpT expression was quantitated by densitometry of digitized images, as described (27Matos M.

Cells grown overnight in LB broth plus antibiotic were diluted 200-fold in the same medium and grown at 37 °C to a density of 2–5 × 108 cells/ml. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice, and then resuspended in Buffer A (50 mm MOPS/K, 100 mm potassium sulfate, 1 mm magnesium sulfate, pH 7.0) to achieve an OD660 of 1.4, equivalent to about 2 × 109cells/ml. After equilibration at room temperature, G6P or PEP transport was initiated by adding a one-twentieth volume of labeled substrate (final concentration, 50 μm), after which aliquots were removed for filtration on Millipore filters (0.45-μm pore size) and washing (twice) with 5 ml of Buffer A lacking magnesium sulfate. Transport of Pi was monitored in the same way, using cells pregrown in M63 minimal medium (as above) with 0.2% glucose as carbon source. The high Pi content of M63 (24Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.

To assay transport (and metabolism) of F6P or PEP in vivo, overnight broth cultures were diluted 1000-fold into M63 salts (above) containing 0.15% F6P or PEP as carbon source. Cultures were placed at 37 °C with continuous shaking, and growth was monitored by changes in optical density at 660 nm. Unlabeled substrates (G6P, F6P, 3-PGA, PEP, 2DG6P, and glycerol 3-phosphate), from Sigma, contained 0.5–1.0% inorganic phosphate (30Friedrich M.J. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3556-3563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was ignored in calculation of kinetic constants. [14C]G6P (56.6 μCi/μmol) and [32P]KPi (1 Ci/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. [14C]PEP (38.6 μCi/μmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Our main objective was to identify possible inter- or intrahelical salt bridges that might exist among or within UhpT transmembrane helices. The topological map of this transporter (Fig.1), as well as results from earlier studies (28Fann M.-C. Davies A.H. Varadhachary A. Kuroda T. Sevier C. Tsuchiya T. Maloney P.C. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), led us to choose four cationic residues (Lys82, Arg275, Lys391, and Lys404) and four anionic residues (Asp279, Glu305, Asp388, and Asp400) as candidate participants in salt bridges. Our experimental approach to this question then proceeded in two phases. Initially, we replaced each target with cysteine to determine whether normal function was disrupted. For those cases in which a significant deficit was recorded, we then asked whether function was preserved if a residue of like charge was present (Table I). In this screen, only the K404C variant retained partial function, indicating that most of our target residues were essential for G6P transport by UhpT. In most of these latter cases, it appeared that this requirement was specific, because only for position 279 and 388 was it possible to substitute a residue of like charge and recover significant function (Table I).Table IUhpT function in mutants of charged residues within the hydrophobic sectorUhpT derivativeG6P transportnmol/min/mg proteinWild type82.1K82C0.7R275C1.9D279C0.2E305C3.6D388C1.0K391C0.2D400C2.8K404C23.8K82Rnot recoveredR275K0.3D279E18.4E305D1.9D388E20.7K391R1.1D400E0.2 Open table in a new tab The second step in our analysis was based on the fact that three pairs of these residues were in a registration (i, i+3) or (i, i+4) consistent with their participation in a salt bridge in an α-helix. Members of the remaining pair, Lys82 and Glu305, were at the center of their respective helices, where they too might interact (7Goswitz V.C. Brooker R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we generated double mutants in which cysteine residues replaced each target pair (Table II). This test provided clear positive evidence that Asp388 and Lys391 might normally interact as an ion pair, because sugar phosphate transport in the D388C/K391C double mutant was about half that found in the wild type protein (Table II); when normalized to UhpT expression, the specific activity of this double mutant was about 75% that of the wild type.2 In no other case, however, did the specific activity in the double mutants rise above about 1% of the parental protein. Thus, this approach did not provide evidence of interaction for our other targets.Table IIUhpT function in double mutants of selected pairs of charged residuesUhpT derivativeG6P transportnmol/min/mg proteinWild type82.1K82C/E305C0.2R275C/D279C0.3D388C/K391C36.5D400C/K404C1.0 Open table in a new tab To further test the idea of an interaction between Asp388 and Lys391, we isolated revertants of the inactive D388C mutation by screening for growth on F6P as a carbon source. This genetic screen was initiated with the expectation that if Asp388 and Lys391 interact so as to eliminate an uncompensated charge, at least some revertants of D388C might map to position 391. We performed this screen in an otherwise cysteine-less background rather than with the wild type protein, because the partially reduced activity of the cysteine-less protein (compare TablesI and III) allowed for a denser background lawn on minimal plates,2 increasing the frequency of revertants. In addition, this cysteine-less parental protein had an N-terminal polyhistidine tag (20Tamai E. Fann M.-C. Tsuchiya T. Maloney P.C.

Values are the means from three independent experiments. Open table in a new tab As noted under “Experimental Procedures,” we were able to eliminate revertants arising from mutations outside the UhpT structural gene. Those that remained contained the original D388C mutation along with a second site suppressor at position 391 in which Lys391 was replaced by one of three uncharged residues, threonine, glutamine, or asparagine. We characterized these revertants in several ways. For example, phenotypic growth tests in liquid medium confirmed that each of these double mutants utilized F6P (Fig. 2). Indeed, they grew slightly more rapidly than did the parental, cysteine-less protein (Fig. 2). By contrast, the host strain, RK5000 (ΔuhpT), and the D388C mutant showed greatly delayed responses; eventual growth of these strains presumably reflects the appearance of adaptive revertants arising after slow growth under strong selective pressure (33Cairns J. Overbaugh J. Miller S. Nature. 1988; 335: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 34Foster P.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 467-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We also examined the three suppressor mutants with respect to their expression of UhpT and their capacity to transport G6P (Table III). In the wild type protein, the D388C mutation had reduced UhpT expression nearly 2-fold (not shown), and a similarly reduced expression was found when the D388C mutation was placed in the cysteine-less background (Table III). In both cases, however, G6P transport was reduced to near background levels (Tables Iand III). By contrast, in all suppressor mutations, both UhpT expression and G6P transport were elevated to levels resembling that found in the parental protein. It is evident, then, that neither Asp388 nor Lys391 are required for normal UhpT function. Equally clear, the presence of one without the other is detrimental. This behavior strongly argues that Asp388 and Lys391 form an ion pair in TM11. UhpT and its relatives comprise a coherent family of transporters and receptors (4Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Henderson P.J.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 708-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), each having high specificity for some organic phosphate ester and low affinity toward inorganic phosphate (1Maloney P.C. Ambudkar S.V. Anantharam V. Sonna L.A. Varadhachary A. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This family has twelve bacterial members, seven of which have been functionally characterized (28Fann M.-C. Davies A.H. Varadhachary A. Kuroda T. Sevier C. Tsuchiya T. Maloney P.C. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A multiple alignment of the amino acid sequences within this group (28Fann M.-C. Davies A.H. Varadhachary A. Kuroda T. Sevier C. Tsuchiya T. Maloney P.C. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) suggests that some residues within TM11 are highly conserved. This is not true, however, for residues assigned to the intrahelical salt bridge in UhpT, Asp388 and Lys391 (Fig. 3). Instead, most family members have either an aliphatic (Ala or Val) or polar (Ser, Thr, or Asn) residue at these positions. However, in one case, the phosphoenolpyruvate transporter of Salmonella typhimurium, we noted the presence of Val388 and Arg391. This was of interest for two reasons. First, the presence of an apparently uncompensated positive charge in the PgtP TM11 contrasted sharply with evidence that this was detrimental to UhpT. Second, because of their acidic carboxyl group, substrates of PgtP (PEP and PGAs) (35Saier Jr., M.H. Wentzel D.L. Feucht B.U. Judice J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5089-5096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Varadhachary A. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 130-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) carry one more negative charge than do substrates of UhpT. For this reason, we considered it feasible that Arg391 in PgtP might serve as an internal receptor for the anionic carboxyl on PEP and PGA. And, if so, we reasoned that the D388C variant in UhpT, which no longer transports F6P or G6P, might show an unexpected bias toward transport of PgtP substrates due to the remaining Lys391. To test this idea, we exploited the fact that UhpT and PgtP (and other members of this family) each display a Pi self-exchange reaction (3Sonna L.A. Ambudkar S.V. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6625-6630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Ambudkar S.V. Larson T.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9083-9086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Elvin C.M. Hardy C.M. Rosenberg H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 1054-1058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, if the UhpT D388C derivative retained this partial reaction, one might justify an extended search for substrates other than G6P. When we examined Pi transport in both the D388C mutant and its parental protein, it became clear that despite its null phenotype for G6P transport (Tables I and III), the mutant displayed considerable Pi self-exchange (Fig.4). For example, the reactions had comparable Michaelis constants (K m values of 740 and 550 μm, respectively, for parent and mutant), and nearly equivalent maximal velocities (105 and 59 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively). Given that the D388C variant is expressed at only 60% of the parental level (Table III), we concluded that D388C UhpT displays an essentially normal Pi self-exchange reaction. Having found that Pi self-exchange is normal in the D388C mutant, we used this reaction as a vehicle to compare substrate preference for parental and mutant proteins. This was essential because UhpT itself does not transport three-carbon organophosphates (29Maloney P.C. Ambudkar S.V. Thomas J. Schiller L. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 238-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the mutant we wished to analyze does not respond to sugar 6-phosphates (Table III). Accordingly, for both wild type and mutant proteins, we ranked putative substrates with respect to their capacity to inhibit Pi self-exchange. As expected from earlier work (29Maloney P.C. Ambudkar S.V. Thomas J. Schiller L. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 238-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this reaction was strongly inhibited by G6P or the nonmetabolizable 2DG6P in wild type UhpT, whereas PEP and 3-PGA were ineffective inhibitors (Fig.5 A). These findings contrasted sharply with results obtained with the D388C variant, which was strongly inhibited by PEP and 3-PGA but not by G6P and 2DG6P (Fig.5 B). Neither protein responded to glycerol 3-phosphate, a substrate of the related GlpT antiporter (37Ambudkar S.V. Larson T.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9083-9086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Elvin C.M. Hardy C.M. Rosenberg H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 1054-1058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To quantitate these observations, we calculated for each substrate an inhibition constant (K i) from linear Dixon plots (40Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3269) Google Scholar) (Fig.5 C and Table IV). This showed that the D388C mutation causes a 50–100-fold decrease in theK i value for normal UhpT substrates while at the same time increasing by 20-fold the apparent affinity for PEP or 3-PGA.Table IVInhibition constants for UhpT substratesTest substrateK iWild type UhpTD388C UhpTμmG6P22 ± 51100 ± 4802DG6P17 ± 41500 ± 440PEP1200 ± 15098 ± 363-PGA2400 ± 290160 ± 48G3P49005900Inhibition constants (K i) were determined for each test substrate as an inhibitor of P i self-exchange, using linear Dixon plots (40Dixon M.

G3P, glycerol 3-phosphate. These findings strongly suggested that D388C is a gain-of-function mutation in UhpT, and to test this directly we examined this protein with respect to both growth on and transport of PEP. The first test clearly documented that the D388C variant was able to use PEP as sole carbon source, in contrast to its revertants or to the wild type protein (Fig. 6 A). Similarly, only the mutant, not its revertants, was able to transport PEP (Fig.6 B). Coupled with the observation that UhpT transports G6P only when the Asp388/Lys391 salt bridge remains intact or when both its elements are removed, these findings lead us to conclude that in both UhpT and PgtP position 391 can serve as a determinant of substrate selectivity. The study of membrane transport proteins reveals several instances in which a functional or structural role can be assigned to one or more charged residues in a transmembrane helix. The former category is well represented by several cases in E. coli, including two charged residues (Glu126 and Arg144) thought necessary for substrate binding in the lactose permease, LacY (8Venkatesan P. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9802-9807Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), a pair of cationic residues (Arg46 and Arg275) that may function as substrate recognition elements in UhpT (28Fann M.-C. Davies A.H. Varadhachary A. Kuroda T. Sevier C. Tsuchiya T. Maloney P.C. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and acidic residues (Asp51 and Asp120) that help set co-ion specificity for MelB, the Na+/melibiose cotransporter (41Wilson D.M. Wilson T.H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3083-3086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such residues may also act as stabilizing factors by virtue of their interaction in a salt bridge. Thus, in bacteriorhodopsin, Arg227 and Asp96 form an interhelical salt bridge, whereas Arg82 and Asp85 are involved in an intrahelical ion pair (14Stern L.J. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14202-14208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interhelical salt bridges in LacY have also been recognized (9Varela M.F. Wilson T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6606-6612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); indeed, these have been indispensable to development of current models of helix packing in this symporter (9Varela M.F. Wilson T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6606-6612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, it has been proposed that Arg499 and Glu503 form an ion pair in the Na+/glucose cotransporter, SGLT1 (42Panayotova-Heiermann M. Loo D.D.F. Lam J.T. Wright E.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10522-10528Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used site-directed and second site suppressor mutagenesis as tools to ask if charged residues in the UhpT hydrophobic sector might take part in salt bridges, basing our interpretation on the original analysis of salt bridges in LacY (43King S.C. Hansen C.L. Wilson T.H. Biochim. Bipophys. Acta. 1991; 1062: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This approach highlighted two residues in TM11, Asp388 and Lys391, as interacting in an intrahelical ion pair. Thus, sugar phosphate transport was not found after individual replacement of either Asp388 or Lys391, but function was retained when uncharged residues replaced both of them (Tables II andIII). Initially, the null phenotype arising when Asp388 and Lys391 were removed individually led us to believe that UhpT function was disrupted due to inappropriate helix packing, but this view did not easily explain why a related antiporter, PgtP (32% identity), contained an apparently uncompensated arginine at position 391. We therefore considered the possibility that lack of function in some of our derivatives was related to altered substrate specificity rather than a change in structure. This seemed more likely when we found that Pi self-exchange was unaffected by the D388C mutation (the K391C mutant has not been tested). Subsequently, by using this partial reaction as a screening tool, we showed that D388C is a gain-of-function mutation that biases substrate preference toward PEP and 3-PGA and away from G6P and F6P (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6 and Table IV). Two questions are raised by our findings. 1) What is the molecular basis of the new substrate specificity in the D388C variant? 2) Why is there at the same time a discrimination against normal UhpT substrates? No definitive answers can be offered to either question, but a single perspective does address both issues. An early model (44Ambudkar S.V. Sonna L.A. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) specified that two electropositive centers in UhpT associate with a pair of negative charges brought into the active site by the anionic substrates, Pi and G6P; indeed, we recently identified two required arginines (Arg46 and Arg275) that may fulfill this function (28Fann M.-C. Davies A.H. Varadhachary A. Kuroda T. Sevier C. Tsuchiya T. Maloney P.C. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). If the configuration that accepts sugar phosphate must achieve an electroneutrality, one might expect that substrates such as PEP and PGA, which carry an additional negative charge relative to G6P, might require the presence of a third positive center before productive binding can occur. The second question is answered in much the same way. That is, when the D388C variant is presented with G6P, failure to achieve an electrostatic balance at the sugar phosphate binding site would be associated with an abortive carrier-substrate complex. Although such arguments account for our findings related to transport of PEP or G6P, this reasoning does not directly explain why the Pi self-exchange is unimpaired in the D388C mutant. At the least one must conclude that TM11 is not involved in binding of Pi. This might be expected if the Piself-exchange exploits a different configuration of the protein (44Ambudkar S.V. Sonna L.A. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), possibly relying predominantly on factors related to either or both of the two essential arginine residues, one of which lies in TM1 (Arg46), the other in TM7 (Arg275). The absence of either of these inactivates G6P transport (28Fann M.-C. Davies A.H. Varadhachary A. Kuroda T. Sevier C. Tsuchiya T. Maloney P.C. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but in light of the work reported here, it could be instructive to examine the Pi self-exchange reaction as these arginines are removed individually. The finding of PEP transport by the D388C mutant also leads one to question the stoichiometry and electrical character of the reaction. The kinetic parameters of Pi self-exchange by D388C deviate little from its parent (Fig. 4), implying that heterologous Pi/3-PGA or Pi/PEP antiport by this mutant would retain the exchange stoichiometry shown by wild type UhpT during transport of G6P. In this latter case, early work suggests that UhpT selects monovalent Pi to use in an electroneutral exchange with divalent G6P, with an overall 2-for-1 stoichiometry (44Ambudkar S.V. Sonna L.A. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A similar 2-for-1 stoichiometry during heterologous Pi/PEP antiport is therefore expected to be electrogenic, carrying negative charge inward, because for our assay conditions (pH 7) PEP or 3-PGA mainly exists as the trivalent anion. Because this reaction would occur against the cellular membrane potential (inside negative), one might also expect, as is found, a relatively low growth yield on PEP (Fig.6 A) and a relatively low rate of PEP transport (Fig.6 B). Although we have not yet studied the electrical character of heterologous exchange in D388C, it is clear that this single mutation (D388C) could have mechanistic impact on more than one attribute of the antiport reaction. That substrate specificity can be altered by change of a single amino acid residue has been demonstrated for several transporters. In LacY, for example, point mutations lead to a preference for maltose (45Brooker R.J. Wilson T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3959-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), sucrose (46King S.C. Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9638-9644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or malto-oligosaccharides (47Olsen S.G. Greene K.M. Brooker R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6269-6275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, point mutants in the melibiose carrier of E. coli can show altered cation and/or sugar specificity (48Niiya S. Yamasaki K. Wilson T.H. Tsuchiya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8902-8906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Botfield M.C. Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12909-12915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most recently efficient transport of lactose was described for a mutant of the E. coli maltose ABC transporter (50Merino G. Shuman H.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7687-7694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even among this group, however, our finding that the D388C mutation alters the substrate selectivity of UhpT is unusual. Given that the new preference for PEP or 3-PGA reflects interaction between Lys391 and the substrate carboxyl, we infer that in wild type UhpT the C1 position of G6P lies on TM11 in the neighborhood of the Asp388/Lys391 ion pair. Of additional interest is the possibility that the approaches described here might let us assign specific functional roles to other charged residues. For example, TM7 contains two charged residues, Arg275 and Asp279 (Fig. 3), one of which (Arg275) is known to lie on the translocation pathway (51Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and is believed to aid in substrate recognition (28Fann M.-C. Davies A.H. Varadhachary A. Kuroda T. Sevier C. Tsuchiya T. Maloney P.C. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Arg275 is conserved among relatives of UhpT (28Fann M.-C. Davies A.H. Varadhachary A. Kuroda T. Sevier C. Tsuchiya T. Maloney P.C. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but only UhpT has a charged residue at position 279. This situation is reminiscent of that found in TM11, where one of a pair of charges (Asp388) is unique to UhpT, whereas the other (Lys391) is more broadly represented (Fig. 3). Although our tests did not identify the Arg275/Asp279 pair as a simple salt bridge, we should not rule out the possibility that these residues associate such that a more general function of Arg275 is moderated by Asp279 to optimize the features specific to UhpT. We thank Wolfgang Epstein and Robert Brooker for helpful discussion and Robert Kadner for the gift of strain RK5000."
https://openalex.org/W2045715394,"The mannose transporter of bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) mediates uptake of mannose, glucose, and related hexoses by a mechanism that couples translocation with phosphorylation of the substrate. It consists of the transmembrane IICMan·IIDMan complex and the cytoplasmic IIABMan subunit. IIABManhas two domains (IIA and IIB) that are linked by a 60-Å long alanine-proline-rich linker. IIABMan transfers phosphoryl groups from the phospho-histidine-containing phospho-carrier protein of the PTS to His-10 on IIA, hence to His-175 on IIB, and finally to the 6′-OH of the transported hexose. IIABMan occurs as a stable homodimer. The subunit contact is mediated by a swap of β-strands and an extensive contact area between the IIA domains. The H10C and H175C single and the H10C/H175C double mutants were used to characterize the phosphoryl transfer between IIA to IIB. Subunits do not exchange between dimers under physiological conditions, but slow phosphoryl transfer can take place between subunits from different dimers. Heterodimers of different subunits were produced in vitroby GuHCl-induced unfolding and refolding of mixtures of two different homodimers. With respect to wild-type homodimers, the heterodimers have the following activities: wild-type·H10C, 50%; wild-type·H175C 45%; H10C·H175C, 37%; and wild-type·H10C/H175C (double mutant), 29%. Taken together, this indicates that both cis andtrans pathways contribute to the maximal phosphotransferase activity of IIABMan. A phosphoryl group on a IIA domain can be transferred either to the IIB domain on the same or on the second subunit in the dimer, and interruption of one of the two pathways results in a reduction of the activity to 70–80% of the control.

IIABMan transfers phosphoryl groups from the phospho-histidine-containing phospho-carrier protein of the PTS to His-10 on IIA, hence to His-175 on IIB, and finally to the 6′-OH of the transported hexose. IIABMan occurs as a stable homodimer. The subunit contact is mediated by a swap of β-strands and an extensive contact area between the IIA domains. The H10C and H175C single and the H10C/H175C double mutants were used to characterize the phosphoryl transfer between IIA to IIB. Subunits do not exchange between dimers under physiological conditions, but slow phosphoryl transfer can take place between subunits from different dimers. Heterodimers of different subunits were produced in vitroby GuHCl-induced unfolding and refolding of mixtures of two different homodimers. With respect to wild-type homodimers, the heterodimers have the following activities: wild-type·H10C, 50%; wild-type·H175C 45%; H10C·H175C, 37%; and wild-type·H10C/H175C (double mutant), 29%. Taken together, this indicates that both cis andtrans pathways contribute to the maximal phosphotransferase activity of IIABMan. A phosphoryl group on a IIA domain can be transferred either to the IIB domain on the same or on the second subunit in the dimer, and interruption of one of the two pathways results in a reduction of the activity to 70–80% of the control. The carbohydrate transporters of the bacterial phosphotransferase system (enzymes II of the PTS) 1The abbreviations used are: PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent carbohydrate:phosphotransferase system (EC 2.7.1.69); IIABMan, hydrophilic subunit of the mannose transporter; IICMan and IIDMan, transmembrane subunits of the mannose transporter; HPr, histidine-containing phospho carrier protein of the PTS; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; GuHCl, guanidinium hydrochloride; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. mediate uptake concomitant with phosphorylation of hexoses and hexitols. They consist of four functional units termed IIA, IIB, IIC, and IID that occur either as individual subunits in a protein complex or as independently folding domains of a multidomain protein. IIA and IIB sequentially transfer a phosphoryl group from the phosphoryl carrier protein HPr to the transported substrate. IIC and IID span the membrane and mediate substrate translocation. Substrate translocation is activated by the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle of IIB (1Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol.

The IIB domains of some PTS transporters regulate the activity of antiterminator and transcription activator proteins (13Stülke J. Arnaud M. Rapoport G. Martin-Verstraete I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In the absence of the cognate substrate, the IIB domain of the β-glucoside transporter (IIBCABgl) phosphorylates the antiterminator protein BglG and thereby inactivates it. This way, IIBCABglfeedback inhibits its own expression in the absence of a transportable substrate (inducer) (14Schnetz K. Rak B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The multidomain composition of the PTS transporters and their dimeric structure allows for various forms of interallelic and intergenic complementation. For instance, the coexpression of two mutated IICBGlc subunits of the glucose transporter with inactive B and C domains, respectively, resulted in complementation of transport activity (29Lanz R. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12239-12243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Complementation has also been observed between inactive mutants of IICBAMtl (30Meijberg W. Schuurman-Wolters G.K. Robillard G.T.

Lengeler J.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 213: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 33Vogler A.P. Broekhuizen C.P. Schuitema A. Lengeler J.W. Postma P.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is generally assumed that complementation in vitro is because of the formation of heterodimers between two different inactive subunits and not only to transient association of different inactive homodimers. The E. coli IIABMan subunit is a homodimer (see Fig. 1 A). Each monomer comprises two independently folding domains, the A domain (residues 1–133) and the B domain (residues 156–323) connected by a 23-residue long alanine-proline-rich linker (35Erni B. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 63: 13-23Crossref Google Scholar, 36Erni B. Zanolari B. Graff P. Kocher H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18733-18741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The IIAMan domain contains a five-stranded β-sheet (strand order 21345) covered by helices on either face ((βα)4,αβ). Four strands are parallel, and the fifth antiparallel strand which forms one edge of the sheet is swapped between the subunits in the dimer. His-10, which is phosphorylated during phosphoryl transfer from HPr to IIB, is located at the topological switchpoint of the fold. Its imidazole ring is hydrogen bonded to Asp-67, which acts as a general base increasing the nucleophilicity of the imidazole ring (19Nunn R.S. Markovic-Housley Z. Génovésio-Taverne J.C. Flükiger K. Rizkallah P.J. Jansonius J.N. Schirmer T. Erni B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The B domain contains a 180° twisted seven-stranded β-sheet (strand order 3241567, 1–6 are parallel and 7 is antiparallel) covered by helices on both faces, as deduced from the IIBLev subunit which is 47% identical to the IIBMan domain. His-175, which accepts the phosphoryl group from His-10 and transfers it to the sugar, is located on an exposed loop between the first β-strand and α-helix (23Schauder S. Nunn R.S. Lanz R. Erni B. Schirmer T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Only the A domain participates in the dimer interface. The monomer-monomer interaction occurs through the interlocked β-strands and an extensive contact area of 1700 Å2 composed mainly of hydrophobic residues. This confers high stability, and the IIABMan dimer can be dissociated only concomitant with complete denaturation (37Markovic-Housley Z. Cooper A. Lustig A. Flükiger K. Stolz B. Erni B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10977-10984Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The B domain interacts with the transmembrane IICMan·IIDMan complex of the mannose transporter. The IIABMan·IICMan·IIDMan complex, which can be purified intact, has a stoichiometry closest to 2:1:2 (38Rhiel E. Flükiger K. Wehrli C. Erni B. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 39Huber F. Erni B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 810-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 40Erni B. Zanolari B. Kocher H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5238-5247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The IIABMan dimer can also be purified as a soluble protein. Dissociated from the transmembrane IICMan·IIDMan complex, IIABManhas an elongated form. Ratios f/fo of 1.81 and 1.72 were calculated from the sedimentation coefficient (s 20,w = 3.7 S) determined by analytical ultracentrifugation (37Markovic-Housley Z. Cooper A. Lustig A. Flükiger K. Stolz B. Erni B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10977-10984Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and the diffusion coefficient (D = 4.73 10−7 cm2sec−1) determined by dynamic light scattering, respectively. The axial ratio of >10:1 derived fromf/fo (41Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1980: 557-565Google Scholar) is compatible with a fully extended dimer (Fig. 1 B) composed of the central A dimer (50 Å along the major axis), the two linkers (66 Å when fully elongated), and the two B domains (35 Å average diameter). It has been shown previously (34Stolz B. Huber M. Markovic-Housley Z. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27094-27099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the active site mutants of IIABMan, H10C, and H175C, are completely inactive when assayed alone, but that approximately 3% of wild-type activity is recovered when the purified proteins are mixed in a 1:1 ratio. Here we show, that much higher activity is recovered when the purified mutants are mixed, completely unfolded with GuHCl, and then renatured. True heterodimers form only under these drastic conditions. Phosphoryl transfer between subunits within the dimer is very efficient, whereas transfer between different dimers is possible but inefficient. E. coli WA2127ΔHIC (manXYZ ptsHIcrr (42Mao Q. Schunk T.

Markovic-Housley Z. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27094-27099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IIABMan was overexpressed and purified as described (34Stolz B. Huber M. Markovic-Housley Z. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27094-27099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme I and HPr were purified, and membranes containing IICMan·IIDMan were prepared as described (42Mao Q. Schunk T. Flükiger K. Erni B. J. Biol.

Stock solution of purified wild-type and mutant IIABMan were adjusted to a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml. Volumes from the different stocks were mixed to achieve the desired molar ratios or molar fractions. The mixtures were then split in two aliquots. One aliquot was diluted with 8 m GuHCl to a final concentration of 4 m GuHCl (37Markovic-Housley Z. Cooper A. Lustig A. Flükiger K. Stolz B. Erni B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10977-10984Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and to the other aliquot, the same volume of buffer A (10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) was added. Both samples were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Both samples were then diluted 20–60-fold with buffer A to the desired a IIABMan concentration (3–125 μg/ml) and incubated for another 2 h at 4 °C. In vitrophosphorylation of [14C]Glc was assayed by ion-exchange chromatography as described (34Stolz B. Huber M. Markovic-Housley Z. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27094-27099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 100 μl of incubation mixture contained 0.5 μg of enzyme I, 2.8 μg of HPr, and 0.5 μl of crude membranes (∼4 μg of protein) containing the IICMan·IIDMan complex. The final concentration of renatured IIABMan varied between 3 ng and 130 ng/100 μl of incubation mixture. The exact values are indicated in the figure legends. The specific activity of [14C]Glc was 1000 cpm/nmol. The rate and the extent of protein phosphorylation was measured as described (45Gutknecht R. Lanz R. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12234-12238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The incubation mixture (50 mm NaPi, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm NaF, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol) contained, per 250 μl, 1.5 μg of enzyme I, 2.5 μg of HPr, and 85 μg of IIABMan. The phosphorylation reaction was started by adding to the incubation mixture at 24 °C [33P]PEP to a final concentration of 80 μm. Aliquots of 40 μl were withdrawn at the indicated time points and diluted into 1 ml of 80% ammonium sulfate solution at 4 °C. The protein precipitates were collected on glass microfibre filters (GF/F, Whatman) under suction, washed, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The background counts because of enzyme I and HPr (less than 10%) were subtracted from the counts of the complete system. Phosphorylated proteins were analyzed on 17.5% polyacrylamide gels as described (21Eberstadt M. Grdadolnik S.G. Gemmecker G. Kessler H. Buhr A. Erni B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11286-11292Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 20-μl incubation mixtures contained 134 μm [33P]PEP, 0.15 μg of enzyme I, 0.46 μg of HPr, 10 μg of IIABMan, and 0.3 μl of IICMan·IIDMan-containing membranes. Wild-type IIABMan, H10C, H175C, and H10C/H175C double mutant were purified by phosphocellulose chromatography and gel filtration. A 1:1 mixture of purified H10C and H175C has about 5% of the specific activity of wild-type IIABMan. The activity increases nonlinearly at low concentration, and the concentration activity profile does not change after 24 h of preincubation (Fig.2). These results suggest that the activity is because of transient association between two different inactive homodimers (second order reaction) and that monomers do not exchange to form heterodimers. However, when mixtures of H10C and H175C were denatured in GuHCl and then refolded by rapid dilution, a 20-fold higher specific phosphotransferase activity was obtained (Fig.3 A). When H10C and H175C were mixed in different proportions, the activity profile was bell-shaped with a maximum at a 1:1 molar ratio (Fig. 3 B), as expected for a binomial distribution of active heterodimers and inactive homodimers. The activities of heterodimers between wild-type and mutated subunits was characterized in the following experiments. Constant amounts of wild-type IIABMan were mixed with increasing amounts of either H10C or H175C. One-half of the mixture was denatured with GuHCl and then renatured by dilution, the other was diluted only. The phosphotransferase activity remained approximately constant at all concentrations of H10C and H175C (Fig. 3 C) independently of whether 100% of wild-type IIABMan occurs as homodimer (no GuHCl) or whether only 11% of IIABMan was in homodimers and the rest in heterodimers with an inactive subunit. The activity was linearly dependent upon the concentration of wild-type IIABMan when wild-type and H10C or H175C were mixed in different molar ratios, denatured, and then renatured (Fig.3 D). This suggests that the presence of a subunit with only one inactive domain in a heterodimer has no effect on the overall phosphotransferase activity of the wild-type subunit. Mixtures between wild-type IIABMan and an excess of the H10C/H175C double mutant were prepared to characterize the phosphoryl transfer between A and B domains on the same subunit. The concentration of wild-type IIABMan was kept constant, and the concentration of the double mutant increased to a maximum of 16:1 (Fig. 3, E andF). At a concentration ratio of 16:1, when only 6% of the wild-type protein is in homodimers and 94% in heterodimers with the double mutant, the activity is still 60% of the control and identical to the activity of the nondenatured mixture. The 40% decrease of activity is because of competition of the excess of inactive homodimers (8-fold over active homo- and heterodimers) for the IICMan·IIDMan complex. Competitive inhibition becomes more pronounced when the concentration of IICMan·IIDMan is rate-limiting. Under these conditions, the phosphotransferase activity is reduced to 50% when the concentration of wild-type homodimer plus heterodimer equals the concentration of the H10C/H175C homodimer (Fig. 3 F).Figure 3Effect of GuHCl unfolding/renaturation upon phosphotransferase activity of IIABManmixtures.

Means and S.D. are of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) With each experiment, a control with pure wild-type IIABManwas carried along as a reference for 100% activity and as control of refolding yield. The activity recovered after rapid dilution of wild-type IIABMan was 80 ± 30% (TableI, column IIABMan homodimer). The specific activity of heterodimers was calculated as follows. The activity contributed by IIABMan wild-type homodimers was subtracted from the total phosphotransferase activity of a mixture of all dimers. The resulting difference was then divided by the concentration of heterodimers in the mixture. The concentrations of homo- and heterodimers were calculated from the binomial distribution. The specific activities of the different dimers are summarized in TableI. The turn-over number of wild-type IIABMan from experiment to experiment varies between 2500 min−1 and 1200 min−1. The H10C·H175C heterodimer has a turnover of 370 min−1. This is 37% of the activity of wild-type IIABMan measured under the same conditions. The turn-over numbers of heterodimers between a wild-type subunit and either H10C or H175C are 50 and 45% of wild-type homodimer, and the turnover-number of a heterodimer between a wild-type subunit and a H10C/H175C double mutant is 30%.Table IPhosphotransferase activity of IIABMan dimersSpecific activity (per dimer)Measured for mixture of all dimersCalculated forIIABMan homodimerActive heterodimerInactive homodimernmol Glc 6-phosphate/nmol dimer/minIIABMan · IIABManMixedaIIABMan components mixed and diluted.25501 × 2550GuHClbIIABMan components mixed, denatured and refolded by dilution.15861 × 1586 (62%)c% recovered wild-type IIABMan activity after denaturation and refolding.IIABMan · IIABManMixed12301 × 1230GuHCl9961 × 996 (81%)c% recovered wild-type IIABMan activity after denaturation and refolding.H10C · H175C (1:1)Mixed10eActivity due to phosphoryltransfer between dimers.1 × 0GuHCl1860.5 × 372 (37%)dActivity of heterodimer in % of wild-type dimer.0.5 × 0IIABMan · IIABManMixed26561 × 2656GuHCl18051 × 1805 (67%)c% recovered wild-type IIABMan activity after denaturation and refolding.IIABMan · H10C (1:8)Mixed18131 × 18138 × 0GuHCl17870.11 × 18131.77 × 896 (50%)dActivity of heterodimer in % of wild-type dimer.7.11 × 0IIABMan · IIABManMixed22461 × 2246GuHCl13871 × 1387 (62%)c% recovered wild-type IIABMan activity after denaturation and refolding.IIABMan · H175C (1:8)Mixed15801 × 15808 × 0GuHCl14320.11 × 15801.77 × 710 (45%)dActivity of heterodimer in % of wild-type dimer.7.11 × 0IIABMan · IIABManMixed11541 × 1154GuHCl14961 × 1496 (130%)c% recovered wild-type IIABMan activity after denaturation and refolding.IIABMan · H10C/H175C (1:16)Mixed8341 × 83216 × 0GuHCl9210.06 × 14961.88 × 442 (29%)dActivity of heterodimer in % of wild-type dimer.15.1 × 0The specific activities were calculated from Fig. 3, A–Eand the control experiments with pure wild-type IIABMan.

The specific activities (in bold) of the homo- and heterodimers were calculated from the measured activity of the mixtures of dimers, the measured specific activity of pure wild-type IIABManhomodimers (in bold), and the concentrations of hetero- and homodimers in the mixtures derived from the binomial distribution (initalics). IIABMan is phosphorylated with [33P]PEP in the presence of enzyme I and HPr and is dephosphorylated in the presence of IICMan·IIDMan and glucose (Fig.4 A). The H175C mutant is stably phosphorylated at His-10 but cannot be dephosphorylated because His-175 is missing. The H10C mutant is weakly phosphorylated although His-10 is missing. It is dephosphorylated in the presence of IICMan·IIDMan and glucose, indicating that phosphorylation occurred at His-175. Phosphorylation of H10C is HPr-dependent but much slower than phosphorylation of wild-type IIABMan (Fig. 5). His-175 must be phosphorylated by HPr directly. Contamination of H10C by IIABMan, which could complement the IIA function, can be excluded because H10C was isolated from an E. coli strain with a chromosomal deletion of the manXYZ operon. It is likely, that phosphorylation of IIB is a consequence of high local concentration of HPr which binds to mutated IIA and then nonspecifically delivers the phosphoryl group to a nearby His-175. Phosphorylation at His-10, whether in wild-type IIABMan or in H175C results in an increased stabilization of the IIABMan dimer against dissociation by sodium dodecyl sulfate, and this effect is not reversed as a consequence of dephosphorylation by IICMan·IIDMan and mannose (Fig. 4 B).Figure 5Time course of phosphorylation of IIABMan. Purified wild-type IIABMan (circles) and H10C (squares) was incubated with [33P]PEP in the presence of catalytic amounts of enzyme I with HPr (open symbols) and without HPr (closed symbols). The reaction was stopped at the indicated time points by ammonium sulfate precipitation. Protein precipitates were collected on filters and counted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) IIABMan consists of two domains, IIA and IIB, that sequentially transfer a phosphoryl group from the phosphoryl carrier protein HPr to the transported sugar. IIABMan is a homodimer. The subunits are tightly linked through mutual exchange of β-strands between the β-sheets of IIA (19Nunn R.S. Markovic-Housley Z. Génovésio-Taverne J.C. Flükiger K. Rizkallah P.J. Jansonius J.N. Schirmer T. Erni B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The B domains, in contrast, neither interact with each other nor strongly interact with the IIA domains to which they are, however, covalently linked via 60-Å long alanine-proline-rich linker (Fig. 1, A andB). Phosphoryl groups can be transferred from IIA to IIB on the same subunit (cis), on different subunits (trans), or both. Our results indicate that cisand trans pathways are of comparable efficiency. Wild-type IIABMan with four sites and four pathways (twocis and two trans) per dimer has the highest specific activity. The heterodimer between wild-type and H10C or H175C with three active sites and only two pathways (one cis and one trans) has 50% specific activity. The active monomer in this heterodimer retains its full activity. Heterodimers with only one functional A and one functional B domain and only one pathway (cis or trans) retain between 30 and 40% activity. Taken together, this indicates that both cis andtrans pathways contribute to the maximal phosphotransferase activity of IIABMan. A phosphoryl group on a IIA domain can be transferred either to the IIB domain on the same or on the second subunit in the dimer, and interruption of one of the two pathways results in a reduction of the activity by 20% to 30% of the control. The results confirm our previous observation of interallelic complementation (34Stolz B. Huber M. Markovic-Housley Z. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27094-27099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and similar observations by others (26Chen Q. Amster-Choder O.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1768-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). But in the case of IIABMan, the interpretation has changed. The weak complementation was because of phosphoryl transfer between randomly colliding homodimers. IIABMan monomers do not exchange, as evident from the structure of the IIA dimer (19Nunn R.S. Markovic-Housley Z. Génovésio-Taverne J.C. Flükiger K. Rizkallah P.J. Jansonius J.N. Schirmer T. Erni B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the long linker (Fig. 1 B) allows sterically unconstrained interaction between IIA and IIB domains on different dimers. The linker allows the IIA dimer to dock on the IIBMan·IICMan·IIDMan complex in either of two orientations (Fig. 1 C). The cisorientation is presented in Fig. 1 A. A IIABMan mutant with His-86 on the IIA domain replaced by Asn was described to have the same properties as H175C mutant with an inactive IIB domain (34Stolz B. Huber M. Markovic-Housley Z. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27094-27099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Erni B. Zanolari B. Graff P. Kocher H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18733-18741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the x-ray structure of IIA showed that His-86 is in a surface-exposed loop and far from the active site. In addition, His-86 is not conserved in any of the homologous proteins (see below). Both observations make His-86 an unlikely target for mutations with a strong phenotype. Resequencing showed the supposed H86N mutation to contain the H175C mutation. We conclude that the H86N mutant is neutral and that vectors must have been exchanged by mistake. Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Vibrio furnissii,and Lactobacillus casei express transporters homologous to the mannose transporter of E. coli except that IIA and IIB are expressed as separate proteins subunits and not as two domains connected by an alanine-proline-rich linker (48Veyrat A.

(complete and in progress) of: Yersinia pestis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Why two forms of IIAB units and what function if any does the linker have? All things being equal, binding of the IIABMan dimer to the IICMan·IIDMan complex must be much stronger than binding of a monomeric IIB subunit because the dimer forms two contacts per molecule, whereas a IIB monomer forms only one (54Fersht A.R. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1985: 308Google Scholar). Although not covalent in the chemical sense, binding might become very strong, and IIAB remain membrane-bound for most of the time. Untying of IIB from the IIC·IID complex is necessary whenever IIB has a regulatory function and must diffuse to other targets. For example, monomeric IIBLev of B. subtilis is not only a subunit of the fructose transport complex, but it also can phosphorylate and thereby inactivate the transcriptional activator LevR (16Martin-Verstraete I.

The transporter for Glc and GlcNAc (IICBGlc·IIAGlc and IICBAGlcNAc) are homologous, but whereas IICBAGlcNAc is a three-domain protein, IIAGlc and IICBGlc are independent subunits. IIAGlc plays a pivotal role in regulation of catabolite repression and inducer inclusion, and it has been shown to interact with glycerol kinase, the transporters for lactose and maltose, and adenylate cyclase (5Peterkofsky A.

These interactions with soluble and membrane-bound target proteins require that IIAGlc can freely diffuse through the cell. The structural stability of the IIAB dimers and their mechanism of phosphoryl transfer might be unique among the different families of dimeric PTS transporters. Nevertheless, it indicates that interactions between different subunits within a dimer (first order reaction) as well as interactions between different dimers (second order reaction) have to be taken into consideration when weak interallelic complementation is observed. The ease with which stable heterodimers can be generated by reversible unfolding will facilitate the characterization by fluorescence energy transfer of domain motions that might occur during phosphorylation and transport of mannose.

https://openalex.org/W2090911496,"Mitochondrial transcription in the earlyXenopus laevis embryo resumes several hours before active mtDNA replication, effectively decoupling mtDNA transcription and replication. This developmental feature makes Xenopusembryogenesis an appealing model system to investigate the regulation of mitochondrial transcription. Studies reported here refine our understanding of the timing, magnitude, and mechanism of this transcriptional induction event. Northern analyses of six mitochondrial mRNAs (normalized to mtDNA) reveal that transcript levels remain basal between fertilization and gastrulation and then undergo a coordinate induction, culminating in a 20–28-fold increase over egg levels by 48 h of development. Measurement of mitochondrial run-on transcription rates demonstrates a good correlation between transcription rates and transcript levels, showing that transcription itself is the primary determinant of transcript abundance. Experimental increases in mitochondrial ATP and energy charge also correlate with patterns of transcript levels and transcription rates, suggesting that developmental changes in the biochemical composition of the mitochondrial matrix could be regulating transcriptional activity. Consistent with this idea, transcriptional run-on rates in mitochondria of early embryos can be stimulated by the addition of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates to the run-on reaction. However, mitochondria of later stages do not show this response to the addition of metabolite. In combination, these data suggest that mitochondrial transcription is under metabolic regulation during earlyXenopus embryogenesis."

Rev. 1997; 61: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The editing has been proposed to proceed through a reaction that is initiated at an editing site by an endonucleolytic cleavage producing a 5′-fragment with a 3′-OH and a 3′-fragment with a 5′-monophosphate (4Blum B. Bakalara N. Simpson L. Cell. 1990; 60: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). U-addition by a terminal uridylyltransferase activity (TUTase) or U-deletion by an exonuclease activity at the 3′-OH followed by re-ligation of the 5′- and 3′-fragments would complete one editing cycle which could be reiterated at subsequent sites. Experimental evidence in support of the proposed mechanism has been obtained in vitro (5Seiwert S.D. Heidmann S. Stuart K.

Genetic information specifying the location of the U-insertions and deletions is carried on guide RNAs (gRNAs). 1The abbreviations used are: gRNA, guide RNA; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT, reverse transcriptase; nt, nucleotide; TUTase, terminal uridylyltransferase. A specific gRNA is able to bind to its cognate mRNA immediately 3′ of a block of editing sites and also contains a template complementary to a block of edited sequence (4Blum B. Bakalara N. Simpson L. Cell. 1990; 60: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated in vitro for certain Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania tarentolae mRNAs that the appropriate gRNA directs the U-insertions and deletions at the editing sites; changing the templating sequence of the gRNA results in the corresponding change to the number of U-insertions and deletions (5Seiwert S.D. Heidmann S. Stuart K. Cell. 1996; 84: 831-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 6Kable M.L. Seiwert S.D. Heidmann S. Stuart K.

U-insertions within some L. tarentolae mRNAs have been reported to be catalyzed by a mitochondrial lysate independent of added gRNA. Initially it was suggested that gRNAs endogenous to the mitochondrial lysate were directing the insertions (9Frech G.C. Bakalara N. Simpson L. Simpson A.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 178-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, it was subsequently demonstrated that the U-insertions were unaffected by mutations to the mRNA that should have inhibited interactions with endogenous gRNA (10Connell G.J. Byrne E. Simpson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4212-4218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Characterization of the reaction was complicated by difficulty in solubilizing the majority of the U-insertion activity from the crude mitochondrial lysate, making subsequent enrichment inefficient and leaving the assays vulnerable to artifacts caused by contaminating activities. The low level of U-insertions also hindered any significant biochemical characterization and prevented the localization of the U-insertions within individual RNAs. As a result, the biological significance of the gRNA-independent reaction observedin vitro was unclear. We describe here a novel assay that has facilitated the enrichment and characterization of the gRNA-independent U-insertion activity. The majority of the U-insertions occurring independent of gRNA are adjacent to a 34-nucleotide A-U sequence element that is immediately 5′ of the editing sites on the cytochrome b transcript. This element is both necessary for the cytochrome b gRNA-independent editing and also sufficient to induce gRNA-independent insertions within a mammalian transcript. The sequence of the A-U element is highly similar to the templating sequence of cytochrome bgRNA I and a sequence immediately upstream of editing sites of the ND7 mRNA, which is the other characterized mRNA that supports gRNA-independent U-insertions (8Byrne E. Connell G.J. Simpson L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6758-6765Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The intermediates produced during the reaction are consistent with a mechanism proposed for gRNA-directed editing (4Blum B. Bakalara N. Simpson L. Cell. 1990; 60: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that gRNA-independent editing may result from association of the editing components with the 34-nucleotide A-U element present on the cytochrome bmRNA. An old laboratory strain (UC strain) of L. tarentolae was grown to a density of 1 to 2 × 108 cells/ml in 2-liter flasks containing 500 ml of BHI media (DIFCO) supplemented with 10 μg/ml hemin. The flasks were loosely covered with foil and shaken at 100 rpm at 27 °C in an Innova 4230 incubator (New Brunswick Scientific). After washing three times with SHE (2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Hepes 7.5 and 0.25 m sorbitol), cells were lysed in a Stansted Disrupter (Energy Service Co.) at 1200 p.s.i. as described previously (10Connell G.J. Byrne E. Simpson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4212-4218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were purified by flotation in a Renograffin density gradient (11Braly P. Simpson L. Kretzer F. J. Protozool. 1974; 21: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and after washing three times with SHE, resuspended in 950 μl of solubilization buffer (25 mm Hepes 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm KCl, 0.1 mm ATP, 1 mg/ml Pefabloc, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for every 500 ml of starting culture. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.5%, and the solution was gently mixed by inversion and left on ice for 5 min. The mitochondrial lysate was centrifuged at 11,000 × gat 4 °C for 5 min and the supernatant frozen on dry ice for storage at −80 °C. The protein concentration of the unfractionated extract was 2.3 ± 0.1 μg/μl. A 250-μl aliquot of the extract was thawed on ice and loaded onto a linear 5-ml 10–40% sucrose gradient and centrifuged in a Ti55 rotor at 100,000 × g for 12 h at 4 °C. Fractions (450 μl) were collected from the top of the gradient. RNAs were transcribed either from PCR products or directly from synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides using T7 RNA polymerase (12Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). The template for the parental transcript (wild type) containing the 5′ 178 nucleotides of pre-edited cytochrome band a mutated gRNA-binding site was amplified from plasmid pNB2-S1 (9Frech G.C. Bakalara N. Simpson L. Simpson A.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 178-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using oligodeoxynucleotide primers 5692 and 10211. The same plasmid was used both for the amplification of the Δ(3–10) template with primers 10513 and 10211, and the S(8A to 8C) template with 10703 and 10211. The Δ(35–54) template was synthesized through reverse transcription of circular wild type cytochrome b RNA with primer 10076 followed by PCR amplification of the extension products using 10076 and 10132. The template for Δ(31–39) was similarly synthesized by RT-PCR using 10795 and 10796. The templates for the 5′-extended wild type and S(8A to 8C) cytochrome b RNAs were synthesized by RT-PCR of circular wild type cytochrome b and circular S(8A to 8C) RNAs, respectively, using primers 7845 and 10797. The template for the RNA transcript used to demonstrate the importance of a 5′-phosphate and 3′-OH to the ligation reaction was synthesized by RT-PCR of circular wild type cytochrome b using primers 9962 and 9964. This RNA has 5′ and 3′ termini that would be produced by endonucleolytic cleavage 3′ of base 44, a location where several U insertions were detected (Fig. 2 C). The template for the wild type 192-nucleotide human light chain ferritin transcript was amplified from ATCC clone 124280 using primers 10704 and 10705. The template for the ferritin transcript in which 34 internal nucleotides were substituted with the A-U element, was constructed in 3 steps. First, the 5′-fragment of the template was amplified with the forward PCR primer 10704 and reverse primer 12122 containing a 3′-extension complementary to the AU element. Second, the 3′-fragment was amplified with forward primer 12121, containing a 5′-extension with the sequence of the A-U element, and reverse primer 10705. Third, the products from the first two PCR amplifications were gel purified, mixed together, and PCR amplified using primers 10704 and 10705. The product was cloned into pBluescript II KS(+) (Stratagene) and verified by sequencing. The template containing the 8A to 8C mutated A-U element was synthesized similarly except that primers 12333 and 12334 were used in place of 12121 and 12122. The RNAs for the gel shift assay were transcribed directly from synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides: 10899 for the wild type RNA, 12309 for the ferritin competitor transcript, and 12525 for the 8A to 8C mutant. The promoter portion of the oligonucleotide templates was annealed to oligonucleotide 5690 prior to initiating the reactions. Transcription reactions (50 to 100 μl) were carried out at 37 °C with 1 mm each NTP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 100 mm spermidine (basic), 1% Triton X-100, 13 mm MgCl2, and 50 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). A 5-fold molar excess of GMP over GTP was included in the reactions for RNAs used in subsequent ligation reactions. RNAs for the gel-shift assay were synthesized to a specific activity of 2.4 × 106 cpm/μg by the addition of [α-32P]UTP under the conditions described above with the exception that the total MgCl2 concentration was increased to 22 mm and the GTP, ATP, and CTP concentrations to 4 mm each. The transcript used to demonstrate the importance of 5′-phosphate and 3′-OH groups to the ligation reaction was primed with 1 mm ApG. ITP was substituted for GTP during this transcription to ensure that all transcripts were primed with a 5′-OH (12Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). The RNA was then either radiolabeled through kination of the 5′-OH with [γ-32P]ATP or through ligation of [5′-32P]Cp to the 3′-OH. All cytochrome btranscripts were purified on 6% polyacrylamide (acrylamide:bis-acrylamide weight ratio of 19:1), 8 m urea; the shorter RNAs used in the gel-shift assays were purified on 8% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels. RNAs were eluted and precipitated with ethanol. Intramolecular circular RNAs were formed by incubating 2 to 5 μm linear RNAs for 2 h at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, 15% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 10 units/μl T4 RNA ligase (New England Biolabs). The intramolecular circular ligation products were purified on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, eluted, and precipitated with ethanol. Several criteria were used to identify and purify the circular RNAs from intermolecular ligation products potentially complicating the U-insertion assay. First, primer extension analysis was used to extend through the ligation junction. Extension of a circular RNA yields a cDNA product that is close to full-length whereas extension of an intermolecular dimer yields both this cDNA and, providing the RT primer-binding site is not at the extreme ends of the RNA, a second shorter product. Second, when radiolabeled GTP primed and unlabeled GMP primed RNAs are incubated together in a ligation reaction, the linear ligation products, identified by the primer extension, are the only predominant radiolabeled bands. Third, the electrophoretic mobility of circular RNAs relative to linear RNAs varies significantly with the percentage of acrylamide. Small quantities of linear contaminants co-migrating with circular RNAs on the 6% gel are readily detected when re-electrophoresed on higher percentage gels. The circular cytochromeb transcripts were heated at 65 °C for 3 min in a 10-μl volume containing 5 mm Tris, pH 8.3 (27 °C), and 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. After the addition of 25 μl of reaction mixture (40 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 6 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 40 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm GTP, 0.1 mm UTP, 5 μCi [α-32P]UTP, 1 mg/ml Pefabloc SC, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), the RNAs were incubated at 27 °C for 10 min. Either 15 μl of the fractionated or non-fractionated mitochondrial extracts were added to the RNAs and incubated at 27 °C for an additional 50 min. Reactions with non-fractionated extract contained 1 pmol of substrate RNA, whereas those with the fractionated extract contained 0.5 pmol. Reactions were terminated by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. Products were resolved on 9% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and quantified after PhosphorImager scanning (Molecular Dynamics). Circular cytochrome b transcripts were extract treated under the direct assay conditions with 1 mm4-thio-UTP (Amersham) substituted for both labeled and unlabeled UTP. Circular RNAs were purified on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, eluted, and ethanol precipitated. RNAs were resuspended in a total volume of 50 μl containing 0.5% SDS and 6 mm EDTA. After heating at 65 °C for 3 min, the RNA solution was added to a 1.5-ml plastic tube containing 10 μl of organomercury-derivatized agarose (Bio-Rad) that had been washed three times in 1 × buffer (400 mm NaCl, 40 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 3 mmEDTA, and 0.5% SDS) and resuspended in 50 μl of 2 × buffer (800 mm NaCl and 80 mm Hepes pH 7.5). The solution was incubated at room temperature for 30 min on a rocker. The beads were pelleted for 5 s in a microcentrifuge and after removing the supernatant, resuspended in 600 μl of 1 × buffer and heated at 65 °C for 5 min. The beads were re-pelleted, the supernatant discarded and the washing procedure repeated an additional 5 times. After the last wash, RNA was eluted from the beads by heating at 65 °C in 1 × buffer containing 100 mmdithiothreitol and 30 pmol of the DNA primer (7534 or 10040) used for subsequent cDNA synthesis. The RNA was ethanol precipitated using 5 μg of glycogen (Boehringer-Mannheim) as a carrier, and the organomercury column enrichment procedure repeated an additional two times. The RNA from the 3rd cycle of enrichment was reverse transcribed into cDNA and PCR amplified for cloning using primers 7534 and 8494 or 10040 and 10041. Bio-X-ACT (Intermountain Scientific) was used to increase the fidelity during the amplification. U-insertions within extract-treated linear RNAs were detected using an RNase H reaction (9Frech G.C. Bakalara N. Simpson L. Simpson A.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 178-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Linear RNAs were extract-treated as described for the circular substrates with the exception that the UTP concentration was at 0.5 μm and the specific activity increased to 2.5 × 105 Ci/mol. Heparin (6 μg/ml) was included within the reactions to reduce the amount of 3′-end labeling relative to the internal U-additions. The extract reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm and incubation at 27 °C for 3 min followed by the addition of SDS to 0.5%, proteinase K (50 μg/ml), and a further 30-min incubation. The RNA was then phenol/chloroform extracted, gel purified, eluted, and ethanol precipitated. Oligodeoxynucleotide 10951 was annealed to the ferritin transcripts, 7622 to the 5′-extended cytochrome b RNAs, and 7534 to the wt cytochrome b RNAs for subsequent RNase H digestion. The gel-shift assays were performed similar to a previously described procedure (13Konarska M.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 845-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). After denaturation, 8 pmol of the RNAs were incubated for 50 min with extract under U-insertion conditions but in the absence of UTP (so that complications from TUTase activity would be avoided) and GTP. The concentration of dithiothreitol was reduced to 3 mm. Where indicated, the competitor ferritin transcript was added to the binding reactions at the same time as the A-U containing RNA. The binding reactions were resolved on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bis-acrylamide weight ratio of 80:1). The assay for ligase activity through the gradient was performed as for U-insertion activity using 0.5 pmol of radiolabeled linear wild type cytochrome b transcript that had been GMP primed. Circular cytochrome b RNA was reacted with the fractionated extract under U-insertion conditions either in the absence of NTP or presence of 1 mm each of 4-thio-UTP, GTP, and ATP. Full-length linear RNAs formed during the reactions were gel purified, eluted, and precipitated in ethanol. Linear RNAs isolated from the reaction containing 4-thio-UTP were enriched for those with insertions by one passage through the organomercury column matrix. RNAs were incubated with 4 units of poly(A) polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C for 30 min in a reaction containing 50 mm Hepes pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm CTP, and 40 units of RNasin (Promega). The poly(C) tailed RNAs were amplified for cloning and sequencing with primers 9209 and 9295. Clones with the same mapped cleavage site were included only if the length of each poly(C) extension was unique indicating that they had originated from different RNAs. There is a 1 nucleotide uncertainty in mapping the cleavage sites adjacent to genomically encoded C nucleotides, and when UTP is included within the editing reaction, the mapping is also complicated by genomically encoded U nucleotides. RNA isolated from the sucrose fractions was electrophoresed in a 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham). Hybridization in Church-Gilbert buffer (0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin) was performed at 65 °C for the 12 S probe (oligodeoxynucleotide 10855) and at 55 °C for the gRNA probe (oligodeoxynucleotide 10854). Oligodeoxynucleotide probes were 5′-end labeled and were added to the hybridizations at a final concentration of 1 pmol/ml and a specific activity of 1 × 106 cpm/pmol. Oligodeoxynucleotides shown below were used in this study.

Cytochromeb mRNA contains 15 sites near its 5′-end that are editedin vivo through the insertion of a total of 39 U nucleotides. In vivo editing of cytochrome bmRNA has been proposed to be directed through the sequential action of 2 different gRNAs (4Blum B. Bakalara N. Simpson L. Cell. 1990; 60: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 10Connell G.J. Byrne E. Simpson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4212-4218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Sugisaki H. Takanami M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 887-891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome b gRNA I contains the templating sequence to potentially guide the appropriate number of U-insertions into the first (3′-most) seven editing sites. Editing creates a gRNA-binding site for cytochrome b gRNA II which contains the template to complete editing at the remaining sites. An RNA transcript containing the first 178 nucleotides from the 5′-end of the pre-edited cytochrome b mRNA of L. tarentolae was used as a substrate for an in vitroU-insertion assay. The 178-nucleotide cytochrome btranscript was circularized with T4 RNA ligase, and then incubated with a solubilized L. tarentolae mitochondrial extract in the presence of [α-32P]UTP, salts, and the appropriate cofactors (Fig. 1 A). Approximately 1% of the input circular cytochrome btranscripts are modified with U-insertions (assuming an average of 2 insertions per molecule). A major advantage of a circular substrate over a linear one is that the circularization prevents a TUTase activity from catalyzing U-addition to the 3′-end. Thus, all the U-additions to a circle, by definition, have to be internal. Circular cytochrome b RNA has a significantly different mobility on a denaturing gel than the corresponding linear molecules, and as a result the circular RNA is resolved from both the endogenous molecules that become intensely labeled during the reaction (Fig. 1 A, −RNA) and from cytochrome b RNA degradation products that are also substrates for the TUTase activity (Fig. 1 A,marker). In addition, circular RNAs have been demonstrated to be more stable to nucleolytic degradation than their linear counterparts, and the functional properties of many RNAs are not significantly altered as a result of the ligation (15Puttaraju M. Been M.D. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1995; 33: 49-51PubMed Google Scholar, 16Schindewolf C.A. Domdey H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1133-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 17Bohjanen P.R. Colvin R.A. Puttaraju M. Been M.D. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3733-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The gRNA binding sequence (anchor) on the cytochrome btranscript was mutagenized (Fig. 1 B) so as to inhibit interaction with the small amount of endogenous cytochrome bgRNA I. The mutagenized RNA is as good a substrate for U-insertions indicating that the reaction does not require endogenous gRNA to interact with the gRNA-binding site (Fig. 1 A, −anchor). This transcript is used in all subsequent assays and will be referred to as “wild type.” The solubilized extract supporting the gRNA independent U-insertion activity can be fractionated over a linear 10–40% sucrose gradient (Fig. 1 A). Fractions were collected from the top of the gradient and assayed in the absence of added cognate-gRNA. The U-insertion activity is predominantly within fractions 6 and 7 and is resolved from the endogenous ribosomal RNA (fractions 10 and 11), identified by Northern analysis (Fig. 1 A) and which also appears to be labeled by the TUTase activity (Fig. 1 A, lanes 10 and 11, intensely labeled bands). TUTase activity appears to be present through most of the gradient since the endogenous RNA is labeled from fraction 3–11. The specific activity of the gRNA-independent U-insertion activity in fractions 6 and 7 is increased 50-fold over the unfractionated extract. Fractions 6 and 7 each contain approximately 10% of the total protein loaded onto the gradient. The remaining increase in specific activity is probably a result of fractionating away RNAs or proteins that are inhibitory to the reaction. The endogenous cytochrome b gRNA I is spread throughout the gradient (Fig. 1 A, Northern analysis). The wide distribution is suggestive that the gRNA is in heterogeneously sized complexes with other factors, in agreement with previous studies (18Pollard V.W. Harris M.E. Hajduk S.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 19Goringer H.U. Koslowsky D.J. Morales T.H. Stuart K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Frech G.C. Simpson A.M. Bringaud F. Byrne E. Bakker A. Simpson L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The fractions containing the peak U-insertion activity (6 and 7) each contain approximately 10% of the endogenous gRNA. The low efficiency of the gRNA-independent reaction had previously prevented the cloning and sequencing of individual RNAs with insertions (9Frech G.C. Bakalara N. Simpson L. Simpson A.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 178-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We enriched for RNAs containing inserted U nucleotides by exploiting the observation that 4-thiouridine could be incorporated by the mitochondrial extract into the cytochrome b transcript with 85% of the efficiency of uridine (data not shown). RNAs containing 4-thiouridine insertions form mercaptides with an organomercurial column matrix which permit their partitioning from the bulk non-modified RNA (Fig.2 A). Those RNAs containing thiouridine insertions were eluted from the organomercurial matrix with dithiothreitol for RT-PCR, cloning, and sequencing. After organomercury column enrichment, 28% of the sequenced clones contained inserted U nucleotides (Fig. 2, B andC). As a result of the assay design, only 108 nucleotides of the substrate RNA could initially be screened for insertions (arrows in Fig. 2 C); the remaining 70 nucleotides were used as primer-binding sites during the RT-PCR amplification and any U-insertions within this region would not have been detected. In a parallel experiment, however, primers binding to different regions of the circular cytochrome b RNA were used for the RT-PCR. This resulted in the generation of molecules with circularly permuted ends and permitted U-insertions to also be detected within the original primer-binding sites (circles in Fig. 2 C). The U-insertions are predominantly localized either within an 8-nucleotide sequence corresponding to the 5′-end of the non-permuted cytochromeb transcript or within an 18-nucleotide region that is normally edited in vivo (Fig. 2 C, boxed sequence). It should be emphasized that there are no insertions between nucleot"
