https://openalex.org/W2040417680,"We demonstrate that mice lacking the oxysterol receptor, LXRα, lose their ability to respond normally to dietary cholesterol and are unable to tolerate any amount of cholesterol in excess of that which they synthesize de novo. When fed diets containing cholesterol, LXRα (−/−) mice fail to induce transcription of the gene encoding cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a), the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis. This defect is associated with a rapid accumulation of large amounts of cholesterol in the liver that eventually leads to impaired hepatic function. The regulation of several other crucial lipid metabolizing genes is also altered in LXRα (−/−) mice. These results demonstrate the existence of a physiologically significant feed-forward regulatory pathway for sterol metabolism and establish the role of LXRα as the major sensor of dietary cholesterol."

The α subunits of some heterotrimeric G proteins cycle between thioacylated and deacylated states in a receptor-regulated fashion. We have identified, purified, and characterized an enzyme acyl-protein thioesterase that deacylates Gα proteins and at least some other thioacyl protein substrates, including Ha-RAS. The action of this enzyme on thioacylated heterotrimeric Gs is regulated by activation of the G protein. Although native and recombinant acyl-protein thioesterases act as both acyl-protein thioesterases and lysophospholipases in vitro, we demonstrate by transfection that the enzyme can accelerate the turnover of thioacyl groups on Gsα in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1982131071,"N-Glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) is abundantly expressed in most mammals, but it is not detectable in humans. The expression of NeuGc is controlled by cytidine monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-NeuAc) hydroxylase activity. We previously cloned a cDNA for mouse CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase and found that the human genome contains a homologue. We report here the molecular basis for the absence of NeuGc in humans. We cloned a cDNA for human CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase from a HeLa cell cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a 486-amino acid protein, and its deduced amino acid sequence lacks a domain corresponding to the N-terminal 104 amino acids of the mouse CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase protein, although the human protein is highly identical (93%) to the rest of the mouse hydroxylase protein. The N-terminal truncation of the human hydroxylase is caused by deletion of a 92-base pair-long exon in human genomic DNA. The human hydroxylase expressed in COS-7 cells exhibited no enzymatic activity, and a mouse hydroxylase mutant, which lacks the N-terminal domain, was also inactive. A chimera composed of the human hydroxylase and the N-terminal domain of the mouse hydroxylase displayed the enzyme activity. These results indicate that the human homologue of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase is inactive because it lacks an N-terminal domain that is essential for enzyme activity. The absence of NeuGc in human glycoconjugates is due to a partial deletion in the gene that encodes CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase.

Sialic acids are components of the carbohydrate chains of glycoconjugates and are involved in cell-cell recognition (1Rutishauser U. Acheson A. Hall A.K. Mann D.M. Sunshine J.

N-Acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) 1The abbreviations used are: NeuAc,N-acetylneuraminic acid; NeuGc,N-glycolylneuraminic acid; CMP-NeuAc, cytidine monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: NeuAc,N-acetylneuraminic acid; NeuGc,N-glycolylneuraminic acid; CMP-NeuAc, cytidine monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s). andN-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) are two of the most abundant derivatives. Previous studies suggest that some adhesion molecules recognize glycoconjugates containing NeuGc and NeuAc with different affinities. Sialoadhesin, a cell adhesion molecule of marginal zone macrophages, recognizes NeuAcα2–3Gal but not NeuGcα2–3Gal (7Kelm S. Schauer R. Manuguerra J.C. Gross H.J. Crocker P.R. Glycoconj. J. 1994; 11: 576-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mouse CD22, a B cell-restricted adhesion molecule, binds more strongly to NeuGcα2–6Gal than to NeuAcα2–6Gal (7Kelm S. Schauer R. Manuguerra J.C. Gross H.J. Crocker P.R. Glycoconj. J. 1994; 11: 576-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Influenza hemagglutinins recognize glycoconjugates that contain NeuAc and NeuGc with different affinities (8Higa H.H. Rogers G.N. Paulson J.C. Virology. 1985; 144: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that the diversity of sialic acids is biologically important in recognition events mediated by glycoconjugates.Although NeuGc-containing glycoconjugates are found in most mammals (5,6Varki A. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), NeuGc is not detectable in normal human tissues. Glycoconjugates containing NeuGc are immunogenic in human, and an antibody against NeuGc, which is known as Hanganutziu-Deicher antibody, is produced by patients who receive therapeutic injections of animal antisera (9Higashi H. Naiki M. Matuo S. Okouchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 79: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar,10Merrick J.M. Zadarlik K. Milgrom F. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1978; 57: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).NeuGc is assumed to be produced from NeuAc through enzymatic hydroxylation of the N-acetyl residue of free NeuAc, CMP-NeuAc, or glycoconjugate-linked NeuAc (11Schauer R. Wember M. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1971; 352: 1282-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Buscher H.P. Casals-Stenzel J. Schauer R. Mestres-Ventura P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 77: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that the major mechanism for biosynthesis of NeuGc is hydroxylation of CMP-NeuAc (13Shaw L. Schauer R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1988; 369: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14Muchmore E.A. Milewski M. Varki A. Diaz S. J. Biol.

Therefore, the activity of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase plays a key role in the regulation of NeuGc expression in glycoconjugates. We showed previously that the conversion of CMP-NeuAc to CMP-NeuGc is carried out by an electron transport system that includes NADH-dependent cytochromeb 5 reductase, cytochromeb 5, and CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase (17Kozutsumi Y. Kawano T. Yamakawa T. Suzuki A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 704-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Kozutsumi Y. Kawano T. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Yamakawa T. Suzuki A. J. Biochem.

J. 1993; 10: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The activity of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase regulates the overall velocity of the hydroxylation reaction (19Kawano T. Kozutsumi Y. Takematsu H. Kawasaki T. Suzuki A. Glycoconj. J. 1993; 10: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, we purified (20Kawano T. Kozutsumi Y. Kawasaki T. Suzuki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9024-9029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned mouse CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase (21Kawano T. Koyama S. Takematsu H. Kozutsumi Y. Kawasaki H. Kawashima S. Kawasaki T. Suzuki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16458-16463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and showed that the ratio of NeuGc to NeuAc in glycoconjugates is regulated by the expression level of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase (21Kawano T.

The human genome contains a band that hybridizes with the mouse CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase cDNA (21Kawano T. Koyama S. Takematsu H. Kozutsumi Y. Kawasaki H. Kawashima S. Kawasaki T. Suzuki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16458-16463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To clarify the molecular basis for the absence of NeuGc in humans, we cloned and expressed the human homologue. We report here that the human CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase protein is inactive because of a partial deletion in the human CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase gene.DISCUSSIONCarbohydrate structures differ markedly from one animal species to another and even among tissues in the same species. NeuGc is one of the abundant derivatives of sialic acid and is expressed in most mammals. For example, NeuGc comprises 95 and 11% of total sialic acids expressed in mouse and rat liver glycoconjugates, respectively (16Lepers A. Shaw L. Schneckenburger P. Cacan R. Verbert A. Schauer R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Almost all sialic acid in rat thymus CD45 and Thy-1 is NeuGc (25van der Merwe P.A. Crocker P.R. Vinson M. Barclay A.N. Schauer R. Kelm S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9273-9280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In contrast, no expression of NeuGc was observed in normal human tissues. The absence of NeuGc in humans is supported by the evidence that NeuGc is highly immunogenic to humans. Antibodies that recognize gangliosides containing NeuGc appear after administration of animal serum to humans (9Higashi H. Naiki M. Matuo S. Okouchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 79: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 10Merrick J.M. Zadarlik K. Milgrom F. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1978; 57: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Another example of the species-specific absence of a carbohydrate sequence and its immunogenicity in humans is the Galα1–3Gal epitope. This epitope is expressed in various mammals but not in old world monkeys, apes, and humans (26Galili U. Shohet S.B. Kobrin E. Stults C.L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17755-17762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies against glycoconjugates containing the Galα1–3Gal epitope are naturally occurring in humans (27Galili U. Macher B.A. Buehler J. Shohet S.B. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The reason for the absence of the Galα1–3Gal epitope in humans is that human α-1,3-galactosyltransferase gene is a nonfunctional pseudogene, which contains nonsense codons in all three reading frames because of multiple frameshift mutations (28Larsen R.D. Rivera-Marrero C.A. Ernst L.K. Cummings R.D. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Joziasse D.H. Shaper J.H. Jabs E.W. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6991-6998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism for the absence of NeuGc differs from that of the Galα1–3Gal epitope. Southern blot analysis of the human genome revealed that the CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase gene is present in human genome in one copy (data not shown). mRNA for the human CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase homologue is transcribed (Fig. 3 and 4 B), and the protein was translatedex vivo (Fig. 4 C). However, the human hydroxylase is inactive because of the deletion of one exon in the hydroxylase genome (Fig. 5).As shown in Fig. 4 D, the N terminus of the mouse CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase is essential for enzyme activity. Schlenzka et al. (30Schlenzka W. Shaw L. Kelm S. Schmidt C.L. Bill E. Trautwein A.X. Lottspeich F. Schauer R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) cloned a partial cDNA for porcine CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase and proposed that CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase is an iron-sulfur protein of the Rieske type, and the N-terminal domain of the mouse CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase contains the Rieske iron-sulfur center. Evidence for the essential nature of this domain for hydroxylase activity is provided by the transfection experiments in this paper (Fig. 4 D). Schlenzka et al. (30Schlenzka W. Shaw L. Kelm S. Schmidt C.L. Bill E. Trautwein A.X. Lottspeich F. Schauer R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) also suggested that the probable binding sites for CMP-NeuAc and for cytochromeb 5 are in the middle of the mouse CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase sequence. There are no data concerning the binding sites for CMP-NeuAc or cytochrome b 5. However, these sites are highly conserved in the mouse, the porcine, and the human hydroxylases. Amino acid sequences of functionless proteins are likely to undergo mutations, but the amino acid sequences of the mouse, the porcine, and the human hydroxylases are highly conserved, even though the human hydroxylase is inactive. We cloned a cDNA for a mouse CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase isoform that lacks 46 amino acids in the middle of the normal full-length hydroxylase (31Koyama S. Yamaji T. Takematsu H. Kawano T. Kozutsumi Y. Suzuki A. Kawasaki T. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The short isoform is expressed in various mouse tissues and shows no enzyme activity. The amount of the short isoform mRNA is about 10–25% of total hydroxylase mRNA (31Koyama S. Yamaji T. Takematsu H. Kawano T. Kozutsumi Y. Suzuki A. Kawasaki T. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The biological function of the inactive mouse isoform is unknown. However, the presence of the enzymatically inactive human hydroxylase and the inactive mouse hydroxylase isoform suggests the possibility of other biological functions of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase. Further studies are required to answer these questions.The absence of NeuGc results in a partial loss of diversity of human glycoconjugate structures. Mouse CD22 binds more strongly to NeuGcα2–6Gal than to NeuAcα2–6Gal (7Kelm S. Schauer R. Manuguerra J.C. Gross H.J. Crocker P.R. Glycoconj. J. 1994; 11: 576-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 25van der Merwe P.A. Crocker P.R. Vinson M. Barclay A.N. Schauer R. Kelm S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9273-9280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). On the other hand, human CD22 binds equally to NeuAcα2–6Gal and to NeuGcα2–6Gal (2Kelm S. Schauer R. Crocker P.R. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), so NeuAc compensates for NeuGc in the function of human CD22 binding. Polymorphic variations of the expression of NeuGc-containing gangliosides have been reported in dog erythrocytes (32Yasue S. Handa S. Miyagawa S. Inoue J. Hasegawa A. Yamakawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1978; 83: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 33Hashimoto Y. Yamakawa T. Tanabe Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 96: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), cat erythrocytes (34Hamanaka S. Handa S. Inoue J. Hasegawa A. Yamakawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 86: 695-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and rat small intestine (35Bouhours D. Bouhours J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15540-15545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggest that NeuGc is not vitally essential for these animals. Therefore, it is possible that NeuAc or other components of cells compensate for the lack of NeuGc in humans or in NeuGc-deficient animals. The absence of NeuGc may confer protection against infection by certain pathogen. For example, K99, an enterotoxigenic strain of Escherichia coli, adheres to ganglioside GM3(NeuGc) but not to GM3(NeuAc) in intestinal epithelial cells (3Smit H. Gaastra W. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. de Graaf F.K. Infect. Immun. 1984; 46: 578-584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). K99 causes diarrhea in neonatal calves, lambs, and piglets, which express GM3(NeuGc). On the other hand, K99 does not adhere to human intestine because of the absence of GM3(NeuGc) in humans (36Deneke C.F. McGowan K. Larson A.D. Gorbach S.L. Infect. Immun. 1984; 45: 522-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that the loss of diversity of sialic acids is not necessarily unfavorable to humans.Several studies have suggested that certain human tumor cells express NeuGc-containing glycoconjugates (6Varki A. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), but these data are controversial. Most of these studies used antibodies against NeuGc-containing glycoconjugates, but not chemical analysis, to detect NeuGc in tumors. Although a few studies identified the presence of NeuGc expression in tumors by chemical analyses, their results are also controversial. Furukawa et al. (37Furukawa K. Yamaguchi H. Oettgen H.F. Old L.J. Lloyd K.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18507-18512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that no NeuGc expression was observed in human melanoma or astrocytoma cell lines, but Marquinaet al. (38Marquina G. Waki H. Fernandez L.E. Kon K. Carr A. Valiente O. Perez R. Ando S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5165-5171PubMed Google Scholar) reported that NeuGc-containing gangliosides were expressed in breast tumor tissues. Our present finding excludes the possibility of the biosynthesis of NeuGc by CMP-NeuAc hydroxylation in humans. We assume that the hydroxylation of CMP-NeuAc is the major biosynthetic pathway and that other pathways minor, because the level of mRNA and activity of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase correlate with the expression of NeuGc (21Kawano T. Koyama S. Takematsu H. Kozutsumi Y. Kawasaki H. Kawashima S. Kawasaki T. Suzuki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16458-16463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Therefore, we consider that the NeuGc is biosynthesized almost exclusively by the hydroxylation of CMP-NeuAc, and molecular mechanisms for the possible expression of NeuGc in human tumors require further study.It remains to be determined whether NeuGc and hydroxylase activity are present in primates. On the basis of our present findings, molecular cloning of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylases of primates is now in progress in our laboratory to identify when the partial deletion of the hydroxylase genome occurred in primate evolution.In summary, we identified that the human CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase is the inactive protein because of the lack of the N-terminal domain, which is essential for CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase activity. We conclude that the absence of NeuGc in humans is due to the deletion of one exon in CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase genome. This study will contribute to understanding of molecular basis for the diversity of glycoconjugate structures in mammals. Sialic acids are components of the carbohydrate chains of glycoconjugates and are involved in cell-cell recognition (1Rutishauser U. Acheson A. Hall A.K. Mann D.M. Sunshine J.

Takematsu H. Kawasaki T. Suzuki A. Glycoconj. J. 1993; 10: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, we purified (20Kawano T. Kozutsumi Y. Kawasaki T. Suzuki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9024-9029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned mouse CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase (21Kawano T. Koyama S. Takematsu H. Kozutsumi Y. Kawasaki H. Kawashima S. Kawasaki T. Suzuki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16458-16463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and showed that the ratio of NeuGc to NeuAc in glycoconjugates is regulated by the expression level of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase (21Kawano T.

The human genome contains a band that hybridizes with the mouse CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase cDNA (21Kawano T. Koyama S. Takematsu H. Kozutsumi Y. Kawasaki H. Kawashima S. Kawasaki T. Suzuki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16458-16463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To clarify the molecular basis for the absence of NeuGc in humans, we cloned and expressed the human homologue. We report here that the human CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase protein is inactive because of a partial deletion in the human CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase gene. DISCUSSIONCarbohydrate structures differ markedly from one animal species to another and even among tissues in the same species. NeuGc is one of the abundant derivatives of sialic acid and is expressed in most mammals. For example, NeuGc comprises 95 and 11% of total sialic acids expressed in mouse and rat liver glycoconjugates, respectively (16Lepers A. Shaw L. Schneckenburger P. Cacan R. Verbert A. Schauer R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Almost all sialic acid in rat thymus CD45 and Thy-1 is NeuGc (25van der Merwe P.A. Crocker P.R. Vinson M. Barclay A.N. Schauer R. Kelm S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9273-9280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In contrast, no expression of NeuGc was observed in normal human tissues. The absence of NeuGc in humans is supported by the evidence that NeuGc is highly immunogenic to humans. Antibodies that recognize gangliosides containing NeuGc appear after administration of animal serum to humans (9Higashi H. Naiki M. Matuo S. Okouchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 79: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 10Merrick J.M. Zadarlik K. Milgrom F. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1978; 57: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Another example of the species-specific absence of a carbohydrate sequence and its immunogenicity in humans is the Galα1–3Gal epitope. This epitope is expressed in various mammals but not in old world monkeys, apes, and humans (26Galili U. Shohet S.B. Kobrin E. Stults C.L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17755-17762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies against glycoconjugates containing the Galα1–3Gal epitope are naturally occurring in humans (27Galili U. Macher B.A. Buehler J. Shohet S.B. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The reason for the absence of the Galα1–3Gal epitope in humans is that human α-1,3-galactosyltransferase gene is a nonfunctional pseudogene, which contains nonsense codons in all three reading frames because of multiple frameshift mutations (28Larsen R.D. Rivera-Marrero C.A. Ernst L.K. Cummings R.D. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Joziasse D.H. Shaper J.H. Jabs E.W. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6991-6998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism for the absence of NeuGc differs from that of the Galα1–3Gal epitope. Southern blot analysis of the human genome revealed that the CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase gene is present in human genome in one copy (data not shown). mRNA for the human CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase homologue is transcribed (Fig. 3 and 4 B), and the protein was translatedex vivo (Fig. 4 C). However, the human hydroxylase is inactive because of the deletion of one exon in the hydroxylase genome (Fig. 5).As shown in Fig. 4 D, the N terminus of the mouse CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase is essential for enzyme activity. Schlenzka et al. (30Schlenzka W. Shaw L. Kelm S. Schmidt C.L. Bill E. Trautwein A.X. Lottspeich F. Schauer R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) cloned a partial cDNA for porcine CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase and proposed that CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase is an iron-sulfur protein of the Rieske type, and the N-terminal domain of the mouse CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase contains the Rieske iron-sulfur center. Evidence for the essential nature of this domain for hydroxylase activity is provided by the transfection experiments in this paper (Fig. 4 D). Schlenzka et al. (30Schlenzka W. Shaw L. Kelm S. Schmidt C.L. Bill E. Trautwein A.X. Lottspeich F. Schauer R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) also suggested that the probable binding sites for CMP-NeuAc and for cytochromeb 5 are in the middle of the mouse CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase sequence. There are no data concerning the binding sites for CMP-NeuAc or cytochrome b 5. However, these sites are highly conserved in the mouse, the porcine, and the human hydroxylases. Amino acid sequences of functionless proteins are likely to undergo mutations, but the amino acid sequences of the mouse, the porcine, and the human hydroxylases are highly conserved, even though the human hydroxylase is inactive. We cloned a cDNA for a mouse CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase isoform that lacks 46 amino acids in the middle of the normal full-length hydroxylase (31Koyama S. Yamaji T. Takematsu H. Kawano T. Kozutsumi Y. Suzuki A. Kawasaki T. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The short isoform is expressed in various mouse tissues and shows no enzyme activity. The amount of the short isoform mRNA is about 10–25% of total hydroxylase mRNA (31Koyama S. Yamaji T. Takematsu H. Kawano T. Kozutsumi Y. Suzuki A. Kawasaki T. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The biological function of the inactive mouse isoform is unknown. However, the presence of the enzymatically inactive human hydroxylase and the inactive mouse hydroxylase isoform suggests the possibility of other biological functions of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase. Further studies are required to answer these questions.The absence of NeuGc results in a partial loss of diversity of human glycoconjugate structures. Mouse CD22 binds more strongly to NeuGcα2–6Gal than to NeuAcα2–6Gal (7Kelm S. Schauer R. Manuguerra J.C. Gross H.J. Crocker P.R. Glycoconj. J. 1994; 11: 576-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 25van der Merwe P.A. Crocker P.R. Vinson M. Barclay A.N. Schauer R. Kelm S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9273-9280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). On the other hand, human CD22 binds equally to NeuAcα2–6Gal and to NeuGcα2–6Gal (2Kelm S. Schauer R. Crocker P.R. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), so NeuAc compensates for NeuGc in the function of human CD22 binding. Polymorphic variations of the expression of NeuGc-containing gangliosides have been reported in dog erythrocytes (32Yasue S. Handa S. Miyagawa S. Inoue J. Hasegawa A. Yamakawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1978; 83: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 33Hashimoto Y. Yamakawa T. Tanabe Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 96: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), cat erythrocytes (34Hamanaka S. Handa S. Inoue J. Hasegawa A. Yamakawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 86: 695-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and rat small intestine (35Bouhours D. Bouhours J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15540-15545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggest that NeuGc is not vitally essential for these animals. Therefore, it is possible that NeuAc or other components of cells compensate for the lack of NeuGc in humans or in NeuGc-deficient animals. The absence of NeuGc may confer protection against infection by certain pathogen. For example, K99, an enterotoxigenic strain of Escherichia coli, adheres to ganglioside GM3(NeuGc) but not to GM3(NeuAc) in intestinal epithelial cells (3Smit H. Gaastra W. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. de Graaf F.K. Infect. Immun. 1984; 46: 578-584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). K99 causes diarrhea in neonatal calves, lambs, and piglets, which express GM3(NeuGc). On the other hand, K99 does not adhere to human intestine because of the absence of GM3(NeuGc) in humans (36Deneke C.F. McGowan K. Larson A.D. Gorbach S.L. Infect. Immun. 1984; 45: 522-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that the loss of diversity of sialic acids is not necessarily unfavorable to humans.Several studies have suggested that certain human tumor cells express NeuGc-containing glycoconjugates (6Varki A. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), but these data are controversial. Most of these studies used antibodies against NeuGc-containing glycoconjugates, but not chemical analysis, to detect NeuGc in tumors. Although a few studies identified the presence of NeuGc expression in tumors by chemical analyses, their results are also controversial. Furukawa et al. (37Furukawa K. Yamaguchi H. Oettgen H.F. Old L.J. Lloyd K.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18507-18512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that no NeuGc expression was observed in human melanoma or astrocytoma cell lines, but Marquinaet al. (38Marquina G. Waki H. Fernandez L.E. Kon K. Carr A. Valiente O. Perez R. Ando S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5165-5171PubMed Google Scholar) reported that NeuGc-containing gangliosides were expressed in breast tumor tissues. Our present finding excludes the possibility of the biosynthesis of NeuGc by CMP-NeuAc hydroxylation in humans. We assume that the hydroxylation of CMP-NeuAc is the major biosynthetic pathway and that other pathways minor, because the level of mRNA and activity of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase correlate with the expression of NeuGc (21Kawano T. Koyama S. Takematsu H. Kozutsumi Y. Kawasaki H. Kawashima S. Kawasaki T. Suzuki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16458-16463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Therefore, we consider that the NeuGc is biosynthesized almost exclusively by the hydroxylation of CMP-NeuAc, and molecular mechanisms for the possible expression of NeuGc in human tumors require further study.It remains to be determined whether NeuGc and hydroxylase activity are present in primates. On the basis of our present findings, molecular cloning of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylases of primates is now in progress in our laboratory to identify when the partial deletion of the hydroxylase genome occurred in primate evolution.In summary, we identified that the human CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase is the inactive protein because of the lack of the N-terminal domain, which is essential for CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase activity. We conclude that the absence of NeuGc in humans is due to the deletion of one exon in CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase genome. This study will contribute to understanding of molecular basis for the diversity of glycoconjugate structures in mammals.

The lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 was found to express the α5 chain at relatively high levels but no detectable amounts of other α chains. The laminin variants containing α5 chain were purified from the conditioned medium of A549 cells by immunoaffinity chromatography using the anti-laminin monoclonal antibody 4C7 which was shown recently to recognize the laminin α5 chain (Tiger, C.-F., Champliaud, M.-F., Pedrosa-Domellof, F., Thornell, L.-E., Ekblom, P., and Gullberg, D. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 28590–28595). The purified laminin variants consisted of three chains with molecular masses of 350, 220, and 210 kDa. The 350-kDa chain was specifically recognized by another anti-α5 chain monoclonal antibody capable of recognizing denatured α5 chain on immunoblots, whereas the 210-kDa chain was recognized by an anti-γ1 chain antibody. The purified α5 chain-containing laminin variants (hereafter referred to as laminin-10/11) were highly active in mediating adhesion of A549 cells to the substratum with potency as high as that of laminin-5 and significantly higher than those of laminin-1, laminin-2/4, or fibronectin. Adhesion to substrata coated with laminin-10/11 was specifically inhibited by anti-integrin antibodies directed against the integrin α3 or β1 subunit but not by those against α2 or α6 subunit, indicating that laminin-10/11 is specifically recognized by integrin α3β1. Given the wide distribution of laminin-10/11 in the basement membrane of various tissue types and dominant expression of integrin α3β1 in most epithelial cells, specific interaction of laminin-10/11 with integrin α3β1 may play an important role in in vivo regulation of proliferation and differentiation of epithelial cells through the basement membrane.

Laminins are a family of basement membrane proteins implicated in diverse functions of epithelial and neuronal cells including adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and programmed cell death. Laminins are disulfide-linked heterotrimers of three distinct but distantly related subunit chains termed α, β, and γ. Nine genetically distinct laminin chains, i.e. α1–5, β1–3, and γ1–2, have been identified in man and mouse (1Engvall E. Wewer U.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Combinations of these chains generate at least 11 different laminin variants, although the differences in biological functions among these variants are understood only poorly. Interaction of cells with laminins is mediated by a variety of cell surface receptors including integrins, membrane-bound proteoglycans (e.g. dystroglycan), and other membrane glycoproteins, of which integrins are of crucial importance with respect to the control of growth and differentiation of cells by the basement membrane (2Ekblom P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 700-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To date, nine different integrins (α1β1, α2β1, α3β1, α6β1, α6β4, α7β1, α9β1, αvβ3, and α?β8) have been suggested to be receptors for laminins (3Mercurio A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 419-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Specificities of interactions of various laminin variants with integrins have been investigated extensively with laminin-1 (a prototype laminin purified from the EHS 1The abbreviations used are: EHS, Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. tumor), laminin-2/4 (merosin), and laminin-5 (also referred to as kalinin, epiligrin, nicein, or ladsin), but those of other newly identified laminins, particularly those containing α4 and α5 chains, remain to be defined. Laminin-10/11 is composed of α5, β1/2, and γ1 chains (4Miner J.H. Patton B.L. Lentz S.I. Gilbert D.J. Snider W.D. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The laminin α5 chain was cloned initially in mouse and found to be more related to a Drosophila laminin α chain than to other laminin α chains (5Miner J.H. Lewis R.M. Sanes J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28523-28526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). cDNA clones encoding the G-domain of the human α5 chain were isolated, and the gene encoding it has been mapped to chromosome 20q13.2-13.3 (6Durkin M.E. Loechel F. Mattei M.-G. Gilpin B.J. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast to other laminin α chains, α5 is expressed widely in adult tissues including placenta, heart, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas (4Miner J.H. Patton B.L. Lentz S.I. Gilbert D.J.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), suggesting that laminin-10/11 may be the major laminin isoforms in the adult basal laminae. Despite its wide distribution in the body, however, the biological functions and integrin binding specificity of laminin-10/11 are yet to be defined with purified proteins. In the present study we screened a panel of human tumor cell lines for those selectively expressing laminin-10/11. One of the human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, A549, was found to express the α5 chain at high levels but no detectable amounts of other α chains. Purification of laminin-10/11 from the conditioned medium of A549 cells allowed us to characterize the cell adhesive activity and integrin binding specificity of these widely expressed laminin variants. Laminin-1 was purified from mouse EHS tumor tissues by the method of Paulsson et al. as described previously (11Murayama O. Nishida H. Sekiguchi K. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Laminin-5 was purified from the conditioned medium of the human gastric carcinoma line MKN45 by immunoaffinity chromatography using affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against human laminin γ2 chain (12Fukushima Y. Ohnishi T. Arita N. Hayakawa T. Sekiguchi K. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Human laminin-2/4 (merosin) was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Plasma fibronectin was purified from outdated human plasma by gelatin-affinity chromatography (13Sekiguchi K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3967-3973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and other human tumor cell lines used in this study were obtained from Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank (Tokyo, Japan), except for the human lung squamous carcinoma cell RERF-LC-AI and the cervix epidermoid carcinoma cell CaSki, which were obtained from RIKEN Gene Bank (Tsukuba, Japan) and American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), respectively. These cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 100 units/ml penicillin G, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Bioscience, Lenexa, KS) unless otherwise indicated, at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells by the acid guanidinium isothiocyanate method (14Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized using a First Strand Synthesis Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A cDNA fragment encoding domain IIIb of the human laminin α5 chain was amplified by RT-PCR from CaSki cells using the primers 5′-TGTATCTGTCCACCACGCACTG-3′ (sense strand) and 5′-ACATCTTGAGCCCTGCACGTTC-3′ (antisense strand), which were modeled after the cDNA sequence 4258–4587 of mouse laminin α5 chain (5Miner J.H. Lewis R.M. Sanes J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28523-28526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The resulting 330-base PCR product was isolated on a low melting point agarose gel and ligated into EcoRV-cleaved pBluescript II KS(+). The nucleotide sequence of the amplified cDNA, deposited into GenBank under accession number AB010099, was 86% homologous to the corresponding sequence of mouse α5 chain cDNA. A pair of nested primers, 5′-GACTGCCTGCTGTGCCAGC-3′ (sense strand) and 5′-GGGGTAGCCATGAAAGCCCG-3′ (antisense strand), was used for routine amplification of the laminin α5 chain transcript by RT-PCR. The RNA transcripts encoding the domain IIIb of human laminin α1 chain were also amplified by RT-PCR using primers 5′-AAGTGTGAAGAATGTGAGGATGGG-3′ (sense strand; nucleotides 3020–3043 (7Nissinen M. Vuolteenaho R. Boot-Handford R. Kallunki P. Tryggvason K. Biochem.

Similarly, the transcripts encoding human laminin β1, β2, and γ1 chains were amplified using the PCR primers 5′-AACTGTGAGCAGTGCAAGCCGTTT-3′ (sense strand for β1 chain; nucleotides 1054–1077 (15Pikkarainen T.

Kallunki T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6751-6758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), and 5′-CATCCTGCTTCAGTGAGAGAATGG-3′ (antisense strand for γ1 chain; nucleotides 1203–1226). PCR products were amplified under the following conditions: 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 61 °C (α5 and β2 chains), 57 °C (γ1 chain), 55 °C (α1 chain) or 53 °C (β1 chain) for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis using 2% agarose gels. Monoclonal antibodies against human laminin α5 and α1 chains were produced by fusion of SP2/0 mouse myeloma cells with splenocytes from mice immunized with GST fusion proteins containing the IIIb domain of each laminin α chain. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli using pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified on glutathione-Sepharose. Hybridomas were first screened for reactivity with GST fusion proteins used as immunogens and then selected for reactivity on immunoblots with intact human laminin α chains secreted by human lung carcinoma cells. Monoclonal antibodies against human laminin β1 chain (4E10) and γ1 chain (2E8) were purchased from Chemicon. Monoclonal antibodies against integrin α5 and β1 subunits, 8F1 and 4G2, were produced and characterized in our laboratory and were described previously (18Manabe R. Oh-e N. Maeda T. Fukuda T. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against laminin-2/4 were also produced by immunizing mice with human laminin-2/4 and screened for positive reactivity with reduced, denatured α2 chain on immunoblots. One of these antibodies, 10G1, specifically stained ∼300-kDa α2 chain but not ∼200-kDa β/γ chains. Monoclonal antibodies against human integrin α2 and α3 subunits, P1E6 and P1B5, respectively, were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and the monoclonal antibody against human integrin α6 subunit (GoH3) was from Cosmo Bio (Tokyo). 31 human tumor-derived cell lines (13 lung carcinomas, 4 gastric carcinomas, 3 cervix carcinomas, 3 gliomas, 2 kidney carcinomas, 2 choriocarcinomas, 1 fibrosarcoma, 1 hepatoma, 1 oral carcinoma, and 1 pancreatic carcinoma) were grown to confluence in 15-cm culture dishes with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The conditioned media were harvested and clarified by sequential centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min and 15,000 × g for 30 min followed by precipitation with ammonium sulfate at 40% saturation. The resulting precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 40 min and then dissolved in and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl. The precipitates were screened for the expression of laminin α chains by immunoblotting with antibodies specific to each α chain. The human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 was grown to confluence in 1,700-cm2 roller bottles with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (400 ml/bottle). After the cells reached confluence, the conditioned medium was harvested once every 6 days and clarified by centrifugation. Pooled conditioned medium (3–5 liters) was first precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate and then dissolved in and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (8.1 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4). The precipitated proteins were subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography with the monoclonal anti-human laminin antibody 4C7 which was shown recently to recognize the laminin α5 chain (19Tiger C.-F. Champliaud M.-F. Pedrosa-Domellof F. Thornell L.-E. Ekblom P. Gullberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28590-28595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The affinity column was prepared by coupling 1 mg of 4C7 IgG purified from ascites (Life Technologies, Inc.) using protein G-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to CNBr-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia). The bound proteins were eluted from the 4C7 column with 0.1 m triethylamine (pH 11.5), neutralized, and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. SDS-PAGE was carried out on 4% gels under nonreducing or reducing conditions (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Proteins on the membrane were reacted with chain-specific monoclonal antibodies followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (EY Laboratories, San Mateo, CA). Bound antibodies were visualized with ECL Western blotting detection regents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell adhesion assay was performed as described previously (21Kikkawa Y. Umeda M. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) were incubated with different types of laminins or fibronectin at 37 °C for 1 h and then blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin for another h at the same temperature. A549 cells were trypsin treated and suspended in serum-free DMEM at a density of 3 × 105cells/ml; then 0.1 ml of the cell suspension was added to each well of the plates followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. The attached cells were fixed and stained with a 0.4% crystal violet in methanol (w/v) for 30 min. After washing with distilled water, the stained cells were extracted with 0.1 m citrate in 50% ethanol. The absorbance of each well of the plates was measured at 590 nm with a model 3550 microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Photomicrographs of cells stained with Diff-Quik (International Reagents Corp., Kobe, Japan) were taken on Minicopy films (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Tokyo) with an Olympus IMT-2 microscope (Olympus Optical Co., Ltd., Tokyo). To identify the receptor for laminin-10/11, monoclonal antibodies against different types of integrins were preincubated individually with A549 cells in a volume of 0.05 ml of incubation solution (4 × 105 cells/ml) at room temperature for 15 min. The preincubated cells were transferred onto plates precoated with different proteins and then incubated further at 37 °C for 30 min. After staining with crystal violet, the attached cells were quantified as described above. Protein concentration was determined by the dye method using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. To purify and characterize human laminin-10/11, we screened by RT-PCR a panel of 31 human tumor cell lines for expression of the laminin α5 chain. The PCR primers were designed according to the nucleotide sequence of human α5 chain cDNA encoding the IIIb domain, which had been cloned by RT-PCR from total RNA extracted from human cervix epidermoid carcinoma cells using primers modeled after the mouse α5 cDNA sequence (5Miner J.H. Lewis R.M. Sanes J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28523-28526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Expression of the laminin α1 chain, the α chain of the classical laminin-1, was also screened by RT-PCR in parallel to select cells expressing α5 but not α1. One of the human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, A549, was found to express the α5 chain mRNA at relatively high levels but not that of α1 chain, although another lung carcinoma cell line, RERF-LC-AI, expressed α1 but not α5 (Fig. 1 A). To confirm the selective expression of the α5 chain by A549 cells, the conditioned medium of A549 cells was analyzed for expression of α5 and α1 chains by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies specific to each laminin α chain. The monoclonal antibodies were produced by immunizing mice with recombinant GST fusion proteins containing the IIIb domain of either the α5 or α1 chain. Immunoblotting with the monoclonal antibody against the α5 chain (clone 15H5) specifically detected a protein band migrating at the ∼800-kDa region in the conditioned medium of A549 cells but not that of RERF-LC-AI cells (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, the monoclonal antibody against the α1 chain (clone 5A3) specifically stained a protein band migrating at the same region in the conditioned medium of RERF-LC-AI cells, but not that of A549 cells. The ∼800-kDa protein secreted by A549 cells was strongly reactive with a monoclonal antibody specific to the laminin γ1 chain and migrated only slightly above the α1-containing laminin variant(s) secreted by RERF-LC-AI cells. Immunoblotting with antibodies specific for the α2 or α3 showed that no detectable amounts of these laminin α chains were expressed by A549 cells (data not shown). Because the anti-γ1 chain antibody did not detect any bands corresponding to the molecular masses of the α4 chain-containing laminin-8 or laminin-9 (i.e. 500–600 kDa) in the conditioned medium of A549 cells, it is likely that A549 cells express only laminin-10 (α5β1γ1) or laminin-11 (α5β2γ1) among the 11 laminin variants identified to date. Because laminin-10 and laminin-11 differ in their β chain types, we examined the expression of laminin β1 and β2 chains in A549 and RERF-LC-AI cells by RT-PCR (Fig. 1 C). The results showed that both β1 and β2 chains were expressed in both cell types, indicating that A549 cells expressed both laminin-10 and laminin-11. The relative amounts of the PCR products for β1 and β2 chains also indicated that A549 cells expressed more β1 chain than β2 chain, whereas RERF-LC-AI cells expressed more β2 than β1. These results suggest that laminin-10 is the major laminin variant expressed in A549 cells. Laminin-10/11 in the conditioned medium of A549 cells was purified by fractionation with 40% ammonium sulfate followed by immunoaffinity chromatography using the monoclonal antibody 4C7, which was previously considered to recognize the α1 chain but has recently been shown to recognize the α5 chain (19Tiger C.-F. Champliaud M.-F. Pedrosa-Domellof F. Thornell L.-E. Ekblom P. Gullberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28590-28595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The protein eluted from a 4C7-Sepharose column gave a single band with molecular mass of ∼800 kDa on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and three bands with molecular masses of 350, 220, and 210 kDa under reducing conditions (Fig. 2 A). The nonreduced ∼800-kDa band was recognized by the anti-α5 monoclonal antibody 15H5 and also by monoclonal antibodies specific for the β1 or γ1 (Fig. 2 B), confirming that the purified ∼800-kDa protein was either laminin-10 or a mixture of laminin-10 and laminin-11. In support of this conclusion, the 350-kDa and 210-kDa bands on the reducing gel were specifically stained by monoclonal antibodies specific for the α5 chain (350-kDa band) and for the γ1 chain (210-kDa band), respectively (Fig. 2 B). Weak reactivity of the anti-β1 monoclonal antibody with reduced protein prevented identification of the subunit type(s) of the 220-kDa chain (data not shown). However, the apparent size of the chain was consistent with that of the β1 or β2 chain, supporting the conclusion that the laminin variants purified from the conditioned medium of A549 cells were α5 chain-containing laminin-10/11. The purified laminin-10/11 did not show any detectable bands at ∼150 kDa, indicating that nidogen/entactin was not associated with the purified protein. The cell adhesive activity of the purified laminin-10/11 was compared with those of other laminin variants (i.e. laminin-1, laminin-2/4, and laminin-5) and fibronectin using A549 cells. A549 cells readily attached and spread onto surfaces coated with laminin-10/11, as was the case with surfaces coated with laminin-5 (Fig. 3). Cells spread on the laminin-10/11-coated surface assumed an elongated, spindle-shape morphology with thin processes, as opposed to the cells on the laminin-5-coated surface which displayed a well spread cobblestone-like morphology with greater cell-substratum contact area. Cells were less adherent to the surfaces coated with laminin-1, laminin-2/4, or fibronectin with limited cell spreading at the same coating concentration. In support of this conclusion, quantitative analysis of cells adhering to surfaces coated with increasing concentrations of different adhesion proteins showed that laminin-10/11 and laminin-5 were almost equally active in mediating adhesion of A549 cells, exhibiting maximal activity at concentrations as low as 3 nm. At this concentration, other laminin variants as well as fibronectin were barely capable of supporting cell adhesion (Fig. 4). The coating concentrations for half-maximal adhesion were ∼2 nm for laminin-10/11 and laminin-5, 4 nm for laminin-2/4, 5 nm for fibronectin, and 6 nm for laminin-1. Similar results were also obtained with other cell types including A172 human glioma cells and A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells (data not shown).Figure 4Adhesion of A549 cells onto surfaces coated with laminin-10/11 and other adhesive proteins. 96-well microtiter plates were coated with increasing concentrations of laminin-10/11 (LN10/11, •), mouse laminin-1 (LN1, ▪), laminin-2/4 from human placenta (LN2/4, ▵), laminin-5 (LN5, □), or fibronectin (FN, ○) and incubated with A549 cells at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, cells attached to the surfaces were quantified by crystal violet staining as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each point represents the mean of triplicate assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because cell adhesion onto the laminin-coated substratum is mediated predominantly by the integrin family of adhesion receptors, we examined the effects of function-blocking monoclonal antibodies against various integrin subunits on adhesion of A549 cells onto the surfaces coated with laminin-10/11 or other adhesive proteins (Fig. 5). Adhesion onto surfaces coated with laminin-1, laminin-5, and fibronectin was specifically inhibited by antibodies against integrin α6, α3, and α5 subunit, respectively, and also by the antibody against integrin β1 subunit, consistent with previous reports (12Fukushima Y. Ohnishi T. Arita N. Hayakawa T. Sekiguchi K. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 21Kikkawa Y. Umeda M. Miyazaki K. J.

Interestingly, adhesion of A549 cells onto laminin-10/11-coated surfaces was inhibited completely by anti-integrin α3 antibody and by anti-integrin β1 antibody, but not by antibodies against other α subunits including anti-α6 antibody. These results indicated that cell adhesion onto laminin-10/11 is mediated by integrin α3β1, as is the case with laminin-5. Specific inhibition of the laminin-10/11-mediated cell adhesion by anti-integrin α3 subunit antibody was also observed with A172 glioma cells (data not shown). The newest laminin α chain identified to date, α5, has been established as the most widely expressed α chain in mammalian tissues. The anti-human laminin monoclonal antibody 4C7, which was reported initially to be directed against the α1 chain, has been shown to recognize the α5 chain (19Tiger C.-F. Champliaud M.-F.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28590-28595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), resolving the previous discrepancy in histological distribution between mouse laminin-1 and its human counterpart defined by 4C7 (2Ekblom P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 700-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical studies using 4C7 and other antibodies specific for mouse α5 chain showed that the α5 chain is localized in basement membranes of a wide variety of epithelial tissues and of blood vessels (4Miner J.H.

Deutzmann R. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 285-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Despite the ubiquitous distribution of the α5 chain, however, the biological functions of the laminin variants containing the α5 chain remain to be determined, mainly because these laminin variants have not been purified in intact form. This study was performed to characterize the biological activities of laminin-10/11 using purified, intact proteins. The strategies employed to purify laminin-10/11 were as follows. First, we selected a human cell line that expresses only α5 chain by screening more than 30 different human tumor cell lines by RT-PCR and immunoblotting. Conditioned medium of cultured cells is superior to tissue extracts as a source of intact laminins because the laminin variants reactive with the 4C7 antibody can be solubilized only after proteolytic digestion (e.g. pepsin digestion) but not by neutral salt or EDTA extraction, which instead solubilizes laminin-2/4 (25Ehrig K. Leivo I. Argraves W.S. Ruoslahti E. Engvall E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3264-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 26Brown J.C. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 329-338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, we produced a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes human α5 chain on immunoblots. The availability of such a monoclonal antibody is crucial to identify the α5 chain because final verification of purified laminin-10/11 requires immunoblotting under reducing conditions. No such monoclonal antibodies recognizing reduced, denatured human α5 chain have been reported to date. We also produced a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes α1 chain on immunoblots. The α1 chain has a molecular mass similar to that of α5 chain, and therefore it is important to distinguish these two α chains with specific antibodies. Previous confusion regarding the specificity of 4C7 antibody also made it crucial to distinguish α1 and α5 chains on immunoblots. Third, we employed affinity chromatography with 4C7-Sepharose to ensure the authenticity of the purified protein. Based on these strategies, we selected A549 cells as a source for human laminin-10/11 and purified them on a 4C7-Sepharose column. In a separate experiment, we also purified laminin-10/11 by conventional procedures for purification of laminins from tissues,i.e. size fractionation on Sepharose 4B-CL, heparin-Sepharose chromatography, and ion exchange chromatography with HiTrap Q-Sepharose. The resulting laminin-10/11 preparation contained some contaminant proteins but exhibited essentially identical cell adhesive and integrin binding activities as observed with those purified by 4C7 immunoaffinity chromatography. 2Y. Kikkawa, unpublished observation. The laminin-10/11 thus purified gave a single band migrating at ∼800 kDa under nonreducing conditions and consisted of three chains of 350, 220, and 210 kDa. Based on the reactivity with monoclonal antibodies specific for α5, β1, or γ1 chain on immunoblots, we concluded that the 350-kDa chain was α5 and the 210-kDa chain was γ1. Other α chains including α1, α2, and α3 were not detectable in the purified laminin-10/11. The absence of a 500–600-kDa protein in the purified laminin-10/11 also made it unlikely that the α4 chain-containing laminin variants copurified with laminin-10/11. Weak reactivity of the anti-β1 monoclonal antibody with reduced, denatured protein failed to identify the 220-kDa chain, but the 220-kDa chain is considered to be a mixture of β1 and β2 chains because both transcripts encoding β1 and β2 chains were detectable in A549 cells by RT-PCR. The presence of the β1 chain was verified by positive staining of the unreduced ∼800-kDa band with the anti-β1 antibody. The relative molecular mass of the α5 chain estimated from SDS-PAGE (350 kDa) was significantly smaller than the mass of mouse α5 chain (450 kDa) calculated from the amino acid sequence predicted from the cDNA (5Miner J.H. Lewis R.M. Sanes J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28523-28526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the α5 chain expressed in A549 cells is processed post-translationally proteolysis as observed with the α2 and α3 chains (27Engvall E.

Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 285-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) were also found to be significantly smaller than the predicted mass. It is also possible that the 350-kDa form of α5 chain was generated by alternative RNA splicing, as has been reported for the α3 chain (29Ferrigno O. Virolle T. Galliano M.-F. Chauvin N.

Using purified laminin-10/11, we demonstrated that laminin-10/11 is a highly adhesive protein, as potent as laminin-5 in mediating cell attachment and spreading onto the substratum. Cell adhesion onto laminin-10/11-coated surfaces was mediated by integrin α3β1 but not by α6β1. Integrin α3β1, once thought to be a promiscuous receptor recognizing laminin-1, collagen, and fibronectin with low affinities, has been shown to recognize laminin-5 preferentially (21Kikkawa Y. Umeda M. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar,22Carter W.G. Ryan M.C. Gahr P.J.

Our results indicate that integrin α3β1 is a dominant surface receptor recognizing both laminin-5 and laminin-10/11, both of which are major constituents of basement membranes of a wide variety of epithelial tissues. Although our results provide the first clear evidence demonstrating the integrin binding specificity of laminin-10/11, there have been previous reports on identification of integrin types binding to human laminin. Gehlsen et al. (33Gehlsen K.R. Dickerson K. Argraves W.S. Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19034-19038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that integrin α3β1 was specifically bound by an affinity column of human laminin which was prepared from placenta after pepsin digestion followed by immunoaffinity chromatography with a B1 (β1) chain-specific monoclonal antibody (34Wewer U. Albrechtsen R. Manthorpe M. Varon S. Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12654-12660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the laminin used in their study appeared to be a mixture of truncated forms of laminin variants containing the β1 chain, its strong reactivity with 4C7 (25Ehrig K. Leivo I. Argraves W.S. Ruoslahti E. Engvall E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3264-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) indicated that the human laminin from pepsinized placenta contained a significant amount of laminin-10/11 in truncated form. In support of this, we found that human placental laminins obtained from different commercial sources, either purified after pepsin digestion or EDTA extraction, were strongly reactive with our anti-α5 monoclonal antibody on immunoblots.2 The specific binding of integrin α3β1 to an affinity column of human laminin from pepsinized placenta is therefore consistent with our conclusion that laminin-10/11 is specifically recognized by integrin α3β1. Essentially an identical approach was also taken by Sonnenberg et al. (35Sonnenberg A. Gehlsen K.R. Aumailley M. Timpl R. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 197: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) to identify laminin-binding integrin types, resulting in a similar conclusion except that human laminin could also bind to integrin α6β1 with lower affinity. The apparent discrepancy between these two previous reports may have been caused by the differences in the proportion of laminin-10/11 relative to other contaminant laminin variants. Among three other laminin variants examined in this study, laminin-10/11 seems to be more related to laminin-5 than to other laminin variants (i.e. laminin-1 and laminin-2/4) in adhesive properties. Laminin-5 has been reported to be most potent in mediating adhesion of keratinocytes (32Rousselle P. Aumailley M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), endothelial cells (36Kikkawa Y. Akaogi K. Mizushima H. Yamanaka N. Umeda M. Miyazaki K. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1996; 32: 46-52Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and glioma cells (12Fukushima Y. Ohnishi T. Arita N. Hayakawa T. Sekiguchi K. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) among various adhesive proteins including laminin-1, laminin-2/4, fibronectin, and vitronectin. Our results showed that laminin-10/11 has potency comparable to that of laminin-5 in mediating cell adhesion to the substratum. Furthermore, both laminin variants seem to be specifically recognized by integrin α3β1, although laminin-5 can also be recognized by integrin α6β4 which plays an important role in hemidesmosome assembly (37Baker S.E. Hopkinson S.B. Fitchmun M. Andreason G.L. Frasier F. Plopper G. Quaranta V. Jones J.C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2509-2520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the α chains of laminin-10/11 and laminin-5, i.e. α5 and α3, seem to be evolutionally the most related among five different laminin α chains (38Doliana R. Bellina I. Bucciotti F. Mongiat M. Perris R. Colombatti A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A full sized laminin α3 chain, α3B, was identified recently in mouse and human, showing the highest homology to the α5 chain at the amino acid level (4Miner J.H. Patton B.L. Lentz S.I. Gilbert D.J. Snider W.D. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 38Doliana R. Bellina I. Bucciotti F. Mongiat M. Perris R. Colombatti A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Despite these similarities, however, it should be noted that morphologies of cells adhering onto surfaces coated with either laminin-10/11 or laminin-5 were significantly different. Cells on laminin-10/11-coated surfaces assumed an elongated morphology with multiple thin processes, and those adhering to laminin-5-coated surfaces assumed a cobblestone-like morphology. This clear distinction in adhering cell morphology suggests that the signals transduced from substrate-adsorbed laminin-10/11 and laminin-5 through integrin α3β1 are functionally different. The differences in signaling events could be either quantitative,i.e. simply the result of differences in the binding affinity of these laminin variants with integrin α3β1, which in turn determines the magnitude of cytoplasmic signals elicited by the ligand-ligated integrin, or qualitative, i.e. the result of differences in the involvement of coreceptors such as dystroglycan and integrin α6β4, which also bind to substrate-bound laminin variants (39Campbell K.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 675-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 40Giancotti F.G. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, integrin α3β1 has been shown to associate with transmembrane-4 superfamily proteins (41Nakamura K. Iwamoto R. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1691-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 42Berditchevski F. Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17784-17790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and EMMPRIN (43Berditchevski F. Chang S. Bodorova J. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29174-29180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). These integrin-associated membrane proteins could be involved in the regulation of signaling events mediated by ligand-ligated integrin α3β1, leading to different cell morphologies on substrata coated with different laminin variants. In summary, we purified laminin-10/11 from the conditioned medium of A549 cells and demonstrated that it is highly competent in mediating cell adhesion to the substratum in an integrin α3β1-dependent manner. Given that laminin-10/11 are the predominant laminin variants of most epithelial tissues and that integrin α3β1 is the most abundant integrin receptor expressed in epithelial cells of different tissue types, specific interaction of integrin α3β1 with laminin-10/11 may play a central role not only in the adhesion of epithelial cells to underlying basement membranes but also in the regulation and maintenance of the differentiated phenotypes of epithelial cells in vivo."

Phosphorylated phosphoinositides play a crucial role in the transduction of signals induced by a variety of stimuli, including growth factors, hormones, and neurotransmitters. Signaling by phosphoinositides is conserved from yeast to mammalian cells. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 1The abbreviations used are: PI, phosphatidylinositol; PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate; PI(3,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-biphosphate; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate; kb, kilobase(s); GST, glutathione S-transferase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; GroPIns(3,5)P2, deacylated PI(3,5)P2. is sequentially phosphorylated by a PI 4-kinase to produce PI(4)P and by a PI(4)P 5-kinase to generate PI(4,5)P2. PI(4,5)P2 is a substrate for phospholipase C, yielding inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (1Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3313) Google Scholar). IP3 binds to specific receptors and induces the release of calcium from intracellular stores, whereas diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C. The increase in intracellular calcium and the activation of protein kinase C act in synergy to regulate transcription and to control other cellular events. More recently, it has been shown that PI(4,5)P2 can, at least in mammalian cells, be further phosphorylated by PI-3 kinase to generate PI(3,4,5)P3, a mediator of cell growth and survival (Ref. 2Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar and references therein). In addition, PI(4,5)P2 can directly regulate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton through specific interactions with actin-associated proteins (3Lassing I. Lindberg U.

Several lipid kinases able to generate PI(4,5)P2 have been identified in mammalian cells. They fall into two subfamilies (type I and type II), differing both biochemically and immunologically, that together form a novel family of homologous PI kinases with no homology to PI 3-kinases or classical PI 4-kinases (11Divecha N.

Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that both types generate PI(4,5)P2, but the type I enzyme is a PI(4)P 5-kinase whereas the type II enzyme is a PI(5)P 4-kinase. Both types of enzymes also seem to catalyze the phosphorylation of PI(3)P (17Zhang X. Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J. Norris F.A. Chen J. Thum O. Prestwich G.D. Majerus P.W. Anderson R.A. J.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two predicted proteins, FAB1 and MSS4, show extensive sequence similarity to the mammalian PIP kinases. The FAB1 gene was identified based on the fab1 mutant phenotype of aberrant chromosome segregation. Further characterization of the fab1 mutant indicated that loss of FAB1 causes defects in vacuole function and morphology and in cell surface integrity (19Yamamoto A. DeWald D.B. Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. Emr S.D. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 525-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The MSS4 gene was first identified as a multicopy suppressor of the temperature-sensitive lethality caused by a mutation in the PI 4-kinase gene STT4 (20Yoshida S. Ohya Y. Nakano A. Anraku Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). MSS4 was also isolated recently as a multicopy suppressor of the growth defect caused by loss of TOR2, a yeast homologue of PI 3- and 4-kinases (21Helliwell S.B. Howald I. Barbet N. Hall M.N. Genetics. 1998; 148: 99-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike FAB1,MSS4 is essential, suggesting that these two proteins have different cellular functions. Based on their homology with mammalian PIP kinases, FAB1 and MSS4 are assumed to be the yeast counterparts of the mammalian lipid kinases, although kinase activity for FAB1 and MSS4 has yet to be demonstrated. This study was undertaken to determine whether, as predicted by its primary structure, MSS4 is a PIP kinase and to identify its cellular function(s). We demonstrate that MSS4 accounts for most of the PI(4)P 5-kinase activity in yeast and controls organization of the actin cytoskeleton. The S. cerevisiaestrains used in this study are listed in TableI. All strains were isogenic derivatives of JK9–3d. Escherichia coli strain MH4 is Δ(lac)X74 hsr- hsm+ strA leuB600 galE galK. Plasmids used in this study were as follows. Plasmids pSH22, pSH23, and pSD6 are pSEY18 (2 μ URA3), YCplac111 (CEN LEU2), and YCplac33 (CEN URA3), respectively, carrying MSS4 on a 4.1-kbBamHI-XhoI fragment. pSD2 (pGST-MSS4) is the yeast GST-fusion vector pEG-KT (2 μ URA3 leu2-d) (22Mitchell D.A.

Cells containing pGST-MSS4 (JK9–3da/α/pSD2) were grown at 30 °C in SRaff/Gly-URA to early logarithmic phase. Expression of the GST-MSS4 fusion protein was induced by the addition of 2% (final) galactose for 8 h. The cells were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), lysed with glass beads in a bead-beater, and centrifuged at 500 × g, 4 °C, for 10 min to remove cell debris. GST-MSS4 was precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing five times with lysis buffer and five times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, the beads were stored at −70 °C until use. The lipids used in this assay were PI (Lipid Products), PI(3)P (gift from Dr. G. Painter), PI(4)P (Calbiochem), and PI(5)P (gift from Drs. G. Prestwich and G. Peng). Dried lipids were sonicated into 46 μl of assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 25 °C, 2 mm MgCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 120 mm NaCl) to give a final concentration in the assay of 100 μm substrate and 300 μm phosphatidylserine (Lipid Products). GST-MSS4 bound to glutathione beads (4 μl) was added to the assay, and the reactions were started by the addition of 15 μl of assay buffer containing 5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP and 43 μm ATP. Kinase activities were tested at 30 °C for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 243 μl of methanol/chloroform (2:1), and the lipids products were extracted by the addition of 58 μl of 2.4 m HCl and 245 μl of chloroform. The lower phase was washed with 239 μl of upper phase (47:48:3, 1 m HCl/methanol/chloroform, v/v/v), and the lipids were analyzed by TLC on a Whatman LKD5 TLC plate as described by Munnik et al.

After autoradiography for 1.5 h at room temperature, the phosphorylated spots were scraped, deacylated, and analyzed by HPLC as described (26Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J.

SD100 and SD102 were grown at 24 °C to an A 600 of 0.7 in medium containing 50 μCi/ml [3H]inositol (Amersham). The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in one-fifth of the original volume. After control samples had been removed, the cells were incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots (200 μl) were collected, and the cells were arrested by the addition of 500 μl of methanol. The samples were dried in vacuo, and lipid extraction was performed as described previously (26Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Some experiments (Fig. 4 A) were done without temperature shift. In this case, the cells were labeled at 30 °C, and lipids were immediately extracted, as described above. The entire open reading frame of theMSS4 gene was deleted in MH272–1da/α with a polymerase chain reaction-generated fragment containing theHIS3MX6 module (A. Wach, and P. Philippsen, Biozentrum, Basel, Switzerland) flanked by 45 nucleotides homologous to the region either directly upstream of the start codon or downstream of the stop codon of MSS4. The oligonucleotides used for generation of the polymerase chain reaction disruption cassette were 5′-GACAGTTTGCCCTATATCGCTTTTCCCTATCAATAGTTTCTAACTCGCGCCAGATCTGTTTAGCTTGCC-3′ and 5′-AGACTGAGTACATAGTCGATAGGTTATTTACCTGTGCCCTACTCACGAGCTCGTTTAAACTGGATGGCG-3′. The disruption was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Chemical mutagenesis and identification of mutants were performed as described previously (27Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Guthrie C. Fink G. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. 194. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1991: 302-318Google Scholar). Briefly, the plasmid pSH23 was mutagenized in vitro for various times with 1 m hydroxylamine. The level of mutagenesis was assessed by testing the plasmids for complementation of the leucine auxotrophy of the E. colistrain MH4. Plasmid aliquots in which 5% of the LEU2 genes had been inactivated were used to transform SD2–5a/pSH22 (URA3). Leu+ transformants were replica plated at 24 °C on 5-fluoroorotic acid-containing medium to select for loss of the pSH22 plasmid (carrying the wild-type MSS4). The colonies were afterward plated on YPD at 24 and 37 °C for detection of a temperature-sensitive phenotype. Plasmids conferring a temperature-sensitive growth were isolated and retested on the original host strain SD2–5a/pSH22, using the same procedure. The recessivemss4-2tsallele was isolated from 12,000 transformants. The mss4-2ts allele in the temperature-sensitive strain SD102 was complemented by a plasmid-borne copy of MSS4 (pSD6). Cells were grown to early logarithmic phase, fixed in formaldehyde, and stained with TRITC-phalloidin (Sigma) to visualize actin, as described previously (28Benedetti H. Raths S. Crausaz F. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1023-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To determine the cellular function of MSS4, we constructed a strain deleted for MSS4. The disruption replaced the entire open reading frame of MSS4 with HIS3. In agreement with a previous report (20Yoshida S. Ohya Y. Nakano A. Anraku Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we found that MSS4 is essential for growth in our strain background. When a heterozygous diploidmss4Δ::HIS3/MSS4 strain (SD1) was sporulated and dissected, only the two His− spores gave rise to colonies on rich medium containing either glucose or galactose as a carbon source (data not shown). Because deletion of MSS4 is lethal, we isolated a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant to facilitate the analysis of MSS4 function (see “Materials and Methods”). The temperature-sensitive mutant SD102, carrying themss4-2ts allele, grew like wild type at the permissive temperature (24 or 30 °C) but stopped growing 4 h (corresponding to approximately 3 generations) after shift to the restrictive temperature (37 °C). To further assess the consequences of loss of MSS4, themss4-2ts strain was examined under the light microscope after incubation at the restrictive temperature. The only striking observation was the appearance of “ghost” cells (see Fig. 1), suggesting a loss of viability of the mutant cells at 37 °C. Indeed, the mutant cells started to die after 2 h at 37 °C, as evidenced by staining with the vital dye methylene blue. After 4 h at 37 °C, ∼60% of themss4-2ts cells stained intensely with methylene blue (data not shown), whereas no appreciable staining was observed for a wild-type control. MSS4 was identified in our laboratory in a screen for multicopy suppressors of the growth defect of ator2tsstrain (21Helliwell S.B. Howald I. Barbet N. Hall M.N. Genetics. 1998; 148: 99-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TOR2 encodes a putative phosphatidylinositol kinase with two essential functions (29Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schneider U. Deuter-Reinhard M.

One function is to control translation initiation and G1 progression in response to nutrients (33Barbet N. Schneider U. Helliwell S.B. Stansfield I. Tuite M. Hall M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 34Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar); the second function is to control the organization of the actin cytoskeleton via a Rho-type GTPase switch (35Schmidt A. Kunz J. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13780-13785Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 36Schmidt A. Bickle M. Beck T. Hall M.N. Cell. 1997; 88: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Overexpression of MSS4 restores both growth (21Helliwell S.B. Howald I. Barbet N. Hall M.N. Genetics. 1998; 148: 99-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and actin organization (data not shown) of ator2ts mutant defective in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. The above results suggest that MSS4, like TOR2, is also involved in organization of the actin cytoskeleton. To test this, we examined if the lack of MSS4 also caused a defect in the polarized distribution of the actin cytoskeleton. Wild-type (SD100) andmss4-2ts(SD102) cells were grown at 24 °C and then shifted to 37 °C. At time points, aliquots were removed, and the cells were fixed and stained with TRITC-phalloidin to visualize F-actin (Fig. 1). When grown at 24 °C, both wild-type cells andmss4-2ts cells displayed the normal cell cycle-dependent distribution of actin (37Kilmartin J.V. Adams A.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 922-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 38Adams A.E. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 934-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), with cortical actin patches concentrated in the bud or septum, and actin cables aligned toward the concentrated patches. A shift from 24 to 37 °C caused, in both strains, a heat-induced disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Cables were no longer visible, and actin patches were more randomly distributed after 1 h at 37 °C. However, whereas the heat-induced disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton was transient in wild-type cells, lasting only 1–2 h, this perturbation was irreversible in themss4-2ts cells and became even more severe after 3 or 4 h at 37 °C. Thus, like TOR2, MSS4 is required for organization of the actin cytoskeleton. The actin cytoskeleton is regulated by the Rho family of small GTPases (for review, see Ref. 39Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). Since overexpression of RHO2, encoding a member of this family, restored both organization of the actin and growth in a tor2ts, we asked if overexpression of RHO2 could also suppress anmss4-2ts mutation. Themss4-2tsmutant (SD102) was transformed with the high copy number plasmid pRHO2, and transformants were monitored for growth at 37 °C. As shown in Fig. 2 A, overexpression ofRHO2 restored growth of the mss4-2tsstrain at restrictive temperature. We also examined whether overexpression of RHO2 could suppress the actin organization defect of the mss4-2ts strain. SD102 transformed with pRHO2 or with an empty vector was grown at 24 °C, shifted to 37 °C for 4 h, fixed, and stained with TRITC-phalloidin. Contrary to cells carrying an empty vector, which displayed the actin defect, cells transformed with pRHO2 regained the ability to polarize actin patches and to form actin cables (Fig. 2 B). The findings that overexpression of RHO2, encoding an actin-related function, suppressed both the growth defect and the actin defect of an mss4-2ts mutant suggest that the essential function of MSS4 is to control the actin cytoskeleton. MSS4 shares high sequence homology with the PIP kinases and has therefore been classified as a PI(4)P 5-kinase (15Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2881-2884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, MSS4 has yet to be demonstrated to have enzymatic activity. To determine whether MSS4 is indeed a PI(4)P 5-kinase, we expressed and purified MSS4 as a GST-MSS4 fusion protein. The GST-MSS4 hybrid was functional as determined by the ability of the GST-MSS4 gene fusion to complement an MSS4 disruption (data not shown). GST-MSS4 was assayed for PI kinase activity using PI, PI(3)P, PI(4)P, or PI(5)P as substrates. Reaction products were resolved by thin layer chromatography and visualized by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 3 A, purified GST-MSS4 had strong kinase activity on PI(4)P and weak activity on PI(3)P; no activity was detected toward PI or PI(5)P. After deacylation and HPLC analysis, the product of the PI(4)P kinase reaction was identified as PI(4,5)P2, and the product of the PI(3)P reaction was identified as PI(3, 4)P2 (Fig. 3, B andC). Thus, as observed previously for at least the mammalian type I PIP kinase, MSS4 phosphorylates PI(4)P on the D-5 position and PI(3)P on the D-4 position in vitro. These results indicate that MSS4 is a dual substrate-specific PIP kinase in vitro, generating PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3, 4)P2 from PI(4)P and PI(3)P, respectively. To determine the substrate specificity of MSS4 in vivo, we first tested the effect of MSS4 overexpression on cellular phosphoinositide levels. A wild-type strain (SD100) and a strain containing MSS4 on a multicopy plasmid (SD2–5a/pSH22) were labeled with [3H]inositol, and the labeled lipids were deacylated and analyzed by HPLC. Overexpression of MSS4 induced about a 1.7-fold increase in the level of PI(4,5)P2 compared with a wild-type strain (Fig. 4 A). Overexpression of MSS4 had no influence on the cellular levels of PI(3)P, PI(4)P, or PI(3, 5)P2. No PI(3, 4)P2was detected in lipid extracts from the control strain, but a small amount of PI(3,4)P2 (93 ± 6 cpm versus13,487 ± 497 cpm for PI(4,5)P2) was detected in the strain overexpressing MSS4. Thus, it seems that although MSS4 has the potential to generate PI(3,4)P2, production of this lipidin vivo is minor. To confirm that the increase in cellular PI(4,5)P2 was due to MSS4, we determined whether the strain containing the temperature-sensitive mss4-2tsallele had lowered levels of PI(4,5)P2. Wild-type (SD100) and mss4-2ts (SD102) cells were labeled with [3H]inositol at 24 °C, washed, and shifted to 37 °C. Aliquots were removed at various times, and the tritiated lipid content was analyzed by HPLC. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the temperature-sensitive strain SD102 contained levels of PI and PI(4)P comparable with those of the wild-type strain, at both permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. However, the level of PI(4,5)P2in the mutant strain was moderately reduced already at permissive temperature and severely reduced at nonpermissive temperature. At permissive temperature, SD102 contained about 35% of the amount of PI(4,5)P2 found in wild-type cells. A shift to the higher temperature induced a transient and mild increase in the level of PI(4,5)P2 in wild-type cells, whereas in the mutant the level of PI(4,5)P2 dropped, reaching (within 1 h) approximately 10% of the level found in the wild type. Thus, MSS4 is a PI(4)P 5-kinase both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, MSS4 is the major PI(4)P 5-kinase in S. cerevisiae under normal growth conditions. We demonstrate that, under normal growth conditions, MSS4 is the major PI(4)P 5-kinase in S. cerevisiae. Furthermore, like mammalian PIP kinases, MSS4 has dual substrate specificity in vitro (17Zhang X. Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J. Norris F.A. Chen J. Thum O. Prestwich G.D. Majerus P.W. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17756-17761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 18Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Comparison of the substrate specificities of MSS4 and mammalian PIP kinases indicates that MSS4 is more closely related to type I than to type II PIP kinases, phosphorylating primarily PI(4)P to generate PI(4,5)P2 and to a lesser extent PI(3)P, yielding PI(3,4)P2. Mammalian type I PIP kinases can, in addition, further phosphorylate PI(3,4)P2 to produce PI(3,4,5)P3 (17Zhang X. Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J. Norris F.A. Chen J. Thum O. Prestwich G.D. Majerus P.W. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17756-17761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Unlike the studies with mammalian PIP kinases, which demonstrated only the in vitro activities of these enzymes, we examined the activity of MSS4 in vitro andin vivo. We found that MSS4 produces PI(4,5)P2both in vitro and in vivo. However, we did not detect PI(3,4,5)P3 in yeast lipid extracts under any of our experimental conditions, and PI(3,4)P2 was detected only weakly and only when MSS4 was overexpressed. This may indicate that, although MSS4 can generate PI(3,4)P2 in vitro, the production of this lipid in vivo may not be physiologically relevant. Alternatively, synthesis of PI(3,4)P2 might be tightly regulated and might require a very specific stimulus. For example, the synthesis of the recently discovered lipid PI(3,5)P2 (26Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 40Whiteford C.A. Brearley C.A. Ulug E.T. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) is induced by hyperosmotic shock (26Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of PI(3,4)P2 remains to be determined. Several lines of evidence indicate that the essential function of MSS4 is involved in organization of the actin cytoskeleton. First, overexpression of MSS4 suppresses both the growth defect and the actin defect of a tor2ts mutant that is inviable because of an actin defect (Ref. 21Helliwell S.B. Howald I. Barbet N. Hall M.N. Genetics. 1998; 148: 99-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). Second, loss of MSS4 causes a growth arrest that is coincident with a disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Third, overexpression ofRHO2, encoding a Rho-type GTPase involved in organization of the actin cytoskeleton (36Schmidt A. Bickle M. Beck T. Hall M.N. Cell. 1997; 88: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), suppresses both the growth defect and the actin defect of an mss4-2ts mutant. Finally, overexpression of a type I PIP kinase in mammalian cells induces massive actin polymerization (41Shibasaki Y. Ishihara H. Kizuki N. Asano T. Oka Y. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7578-7581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 42Sakisaka T. Itoh T. Miura K. Takenawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3841-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We could not detect any effect of overexpression of MSS4 from a high copy plasmid on the actin cytoskeleton (data not shown), but under these conditions, the cellular level of PI(4,5)P2 was less than doubled (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, a 65% reduction in the cellular level of PI(4,5)P2, as observed in ourmss4-2ts mutant at permissive temperature, had no visible effect on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. These results may suggest that the intracellular levels of PI(4,5)P2 can fluctuate significantly without a major effect on the actin cytoskeleton. More severe changes in PI(4,5)P2 levels, like the 90% decrease in themss4-2ts mutant at restrictive temperature, might be necessary to affect organization of actin. How is MSS4 required for organization of the actin cytoskeleton? PIP(4,5)P2 binds and regulates the function of several actin-binding proteins, including profilin (3Lassing I. Lindberg U. Nature. 1985; 314: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), gelsolin (4Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1987; 325: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), gCap39 (5Yu F.X. Johnston P.A. Sudhof T.C. Yin H.L. Science. 1990; 250: 1413-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), N-WASP (10Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), ERM proteins (9Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell. Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), α-actinin, and vinculin (7Fukami K. Furuhashi K. Inagaki M. Endo T. Hatano S. Takenawa T. Nature. 1992; 359: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 8Fukami K. Endo T. Imamura M. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1518-1522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a simple model for the role of MSS4 in organization of the actin cytoskeleton is that, by generating PIP(4,5)P2, it directly controls the interactions between actin and the actin-binding proteins. Another possibility is that MSS4 signals to the actin cytoskeleton indirectly, through the Rho-type GTPases (43Schmidt A. Hall M.N. Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian type I PIP kinases are believed to signal to the actin cytoskeleton as downstream effectors of Rho and Rac GTPases (44Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 45Hartwig J.H. Bokoch G.M. Carpenter C.L. Janmey P.A. Taylor L.A. Toker A. Stossel T.P.

Our finding thatRHO2 is a multicopy suppressor of themss4-2ts mutation suggests that MSS4 signals to the actin cytoskeleton as part of a signaling pathway involving Rho-type GTPases. This model is strengthened by the fact thatMSS4 is a multicopy suppressor of a tor2mutation, and TOR2 signals to the actin cytoskeleton via RHO1 and RHO2 (21Helliwell S.B. Howald I. Barbet N. Hall M.N. Genetics. 1998; 148: 99-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Schmidt A. Bickle M. Beck T. Hall M.N. Cell. 1997; 88: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MSS4 may be in a pathway with PKC1 (see below), which is a direct downstream effector of RHO1 (47Nonaka H. Tanaka K. Hirano H. Fujiwara T. Kohno H. Umikawa M. Mino A. Takai Y.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9193-9196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae protein kinase C (PKC) homologue PKC1 plays a major role in ensuring cell integrity (49Levin D.E. Bartlett-Heubusch E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1221-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 50Paravicini G. Cooper M. Friedli L. Smith D.J. Carpentier J.L. Klig L.S. Payton M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4896-4905Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and is activated by heat or hypotonic shock (51Davenport K.R. Sohaskey M. Kamada Y. Levin D.E. Gustin M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30157-30161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 52Kamada Y. Jung U.S. Piotrowski J. Levin D.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that MSS4 and PKC1 are involved in a common signaling pathway. First, the MSS4 gene was originally identified as a multicopy suppressor of a temperature-sensitive mutation in the PI 4-kinase geneSTT4, which had previously been implicated in PKC1 signaling (20Yoshida S. Ohya Y. Nakano A. Anraku Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Second, both MSS4 and PKC1 were isolated as multicopy suppressors of a tor2 mutation (21Helliwell S.B. Howald I. Barbet N. Hall M.N. Genetics. 1998; 148: 99-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One function of TOR2 is to control organization of the actin cytoskeleton by activating RHO1 (36Schmidt A. Bickle M. Beck T. Hall M.N. Cell. 1997; 88: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and both MSS4 and PKC1 can suppress the loss of this function. Third, like a tor2mutant, an mss4 mutant fails to properly localize actin during polarized cell growth. pkc1 mutants have not been shown to have defects in actin organization, but cells altered in SLT2/MPK1, a mitogen-activated protein kinase activated by PKC1, exhibit delocalized actin (53Mazzoni C. Zarov P. Rambourg A. Mann C. J. Cell. Biol. 1993; 123: 1821-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Fourth, we observed that high temperature triggers synthesis of PI(4,5)P2, suggesting that MSS4, like PKC1, is activated by heat shock. How MSS4 may be related to PKC1, RHO1, RHO2, and TOR2 in a pathway(s) remains to be determined. We thank Dr. G. Painter for the gift of PI(3)P, Drs. G. Prestwich and G.

Incorporation of Env, therefore, is essential for the formation of infectious viral particles. The cytosolic domain of the Env transmembrane subunit gp41 is the portion of the Env protein complex that is most likely to interact with the internal structural proteins of the virus (2Gelderblom H.R.

As a consequence, the internal structural proteins of these viruses need to compete with the internalization machinery of the cell in order to acquire Env (9Egan M.A. Carruth L.M. Rowell J.F. Yu X.

Although the functional significance of this phenomenon is not understood, it is clear that Env behaves like other plasma membrane proteins that are rapidly internalized from the cell surface. Rapid internalization involves recruitment of plasma membrane proteins to clathrin-coated pits, a process that is mediated by interaction of endocytic signals found in the cytosolic domains of the proteins with the clathrin-associated adaptor complex AP-2 (10Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar, 11Robinson M.S.

A direct interaction between μ2 and tyrosine-based sorting signals from the cytosolic domains of several cellular integral membrane proteins has been recently demonstrated (13Ohno H. Stewart J.

To assess the diverse functions of the cytosolic domain of Env including its role in internalization from the plasma membrane, we are analyzing its interaction with cellular and viral proteins. Anti-Env antibodies allowed us to co-immunoprecipitate Env with the AP-2 complex from HIV-1-infected lymphocytes, demonstrating that these proteins associate in vivo. Using GST-Env tail fusion proteins, we then identified the μ2 chain of AP-2 as a protein that interacts with the cytosolic domain of Env. Binding of μ2 to the cytosolic domain of Env was dependent on the presence and the context of a tyrosine-based sorting motif that is crucial for Env internalization (7Rowell J.F. Stanhope P.E. Siliciano R.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 473-488PubMed Google Scholar), but it was also influenced by a glycine residue that had not previously been identified to be important for efficient endosomal sorting. Moreover, sequence as well as context dependence of μ2 binding to the cytosolic domain of Env was mimicked by the intact AP-2 complex. The results presented here suggest that the glutathioneS-transferase (GST) gene fusion system may be useful to analyze the interaction of the cytosolic domain of Env with other cellular or viral proteins. This system may also permit further dissection of μ2 functional regions and definition of the requirements for the binding of tyrosine-based sorting signals to adaptor complexes other than AP-2. All constructs used in the in vitro binding assays were made by ligation of polymerase chain reaction (Pwo DNA polymerase; Boehringer Mannheim)-amplified DNA fragments into pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Primer sequences were as follows: 5′-AATCCCGGGATAGTTTTTGCTGTAC-3′ and 5′-CTTAAGACCACTTGCCACCCATCTTA-3′. The polymerase chain reaction products were phosphorylated and inserted intoSmaI-linearized pGEX-3X. The expression vectors 3M9 for μ2, pcwt for HIV-1 Env, and the deletion mutants of Env have been described (13Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed either in the GST fusion constructs or in the Env expression vectors using the Quick Change™ system (Stratagene). The following primers were used: R709A, 5′-GTGAATAGAGTTGCGCAGGGATATTCAC-3′; Q710A, 5′-GTGAATAGAGTTAGGGCCGGCTATTCACCATTATCG-3′; G711A, 5′-GAGTTAGGCAGGCATATTCTCCATTATCG-3′; Y712A, 5′-GAGTTAGGCAGGGAGCTTCTCCATTATCG-3′; S713A, 5′-GAGTTAGGCAGGGATATGCACCATTATCG-3′; P714A, 5′-GTTAGGCAGGGATATTCAGCATTATCGTTTC-3′; L715A, 5′-GGCAGGGATATTCGCCGGCGTCGTTTCAGACC-3′; Y768A, 5′-GTGCCTCTTCAGCGCTCACCGCTTGAGAGAC-3′; Y768C, 5′-GTGCCTCTTCAGCTGCCACCGCTTGAG-3′. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Chronically infected Jurkat cells were established by transfecting the cells with proviral DNA (HXB2 strain; Ref. 18). Cells surviving the acute phase of virus production were propagated for 4–6 weeks in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Virus production was monitored by p24 capture (Abbott) and by SDS-PAGE analysis of purified virions. To perform the immunoblot analysis, uninfected or infected cells were washed in PBS and then lysed in 500 μl of a Triton X-100-based lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm EDTA) essentially as described (19Nesterov A. Kurten R.C. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6320-6327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Precleared lysates were preincubated for 1.5 h with 50 μl of Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Env was precipitated using the anti-Env monoclonal antibody b12 (20Roben P. Moore J. Thali M. Sodroski J. Barbas III, C.F. Burton D. J. Virol. 1994; 71: 6869-6874Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dennis Burton, immobilized on Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B overnight at 4 °C. After SDS-PAGE separation, the precipitated material was transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Those membranes were then probed with Sigma antibodies 100/2 (anti-α-adaptin) or 100/1 (anti-β-adaptin). Bound antibodies were visualized after binding of secondary antibodies by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli strain TB1 and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Precultures (4 ml of LB medium supplemented with 0.5 md-sorbitol and 2.5 mm betaine) were grown overnight at 37 °C. They were transferred to 400 ml of LB medium supplemented with 1 md-sorbitol and 2.5 mm betaine and grown for 8 h at 37 °C. Cultures were shifted to 25 °C and induced overnight with 0.1 mmIsopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. The purification on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions including a heat shock step with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgSO4, and 2 mm ATP for 10 min at 37 °C. [35S]Methionine-labeled μ2 was prepared using a coupled transcription-translation system (TNT®, Promega,). Precleared in vitrotranslated μ2 (2 μl) was incubated with 5 μg of GST fusion protein in 500 μl of binding buffer (0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 0.1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 50 μm dithiothreitol, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 2 h at room temperature. Loading buffer was added to washed beads, and the samples were run on SDS-PAGE. The amount of μ2 bound to the different GST fusion protein mutants was determined by measuring the radioactivity of the signals using the Instant ImagerTM system (Packard). T cell lysate was prepared from Jurkat cells essentially as described (21Dietrich J. Kastrup J. Nielsen B.L. Odum N. Geisler C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 227-281Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed three times with cytosol buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 125 mmCH3COOK, 2.5 mm(CH3COO)2Mg, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml glucose), and the resulting pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of cytosol buffer containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell suspension was frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed on ice, and drawn five times through a 21-gauge syringe. After centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 ×g, 4 °C, the supernatant was transferred to new tubes in 100-μl aliquots and stored at −80 °C. Aliquots were precleared in 900 μl of PBS containing 1.5 mg of GST proteins on Sepharose 4B beads at 35 °C for 30 min. 300 μl of precleared lysate was incubated with 100 μg of fusion protein on Sepharose 4B beads at 35 °C for 2 h. Beads were washed three times with PBS and boiled in gel sample buffer. Afterward, SDS-PAGE proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with Sigma antibody 100/2 (anti-α -adaptin) or 100/1 (anti-β -adaptin). Bound antibodies were visualized after binding of secondary antibodies by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Twenty-four hours after transfection with the Env expression plasmids, HeLa cells were metabolically labeled for 16 h with [35S]cysteine (50 μCi/ml). The labeled cells were chilled on ice and biotinylated for 30 min in 1 ml of PBS containing 1.5 mg/ml NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce). After three washes with PBS, 50 mm glycine, the cells were returned to 37 °C for different periods of time to allow for endocytosis to occur. To remove biotin from surface proteins that had not been internalized, cells were again chilled on ice and incubated twice for 15 min with 50 mm glutathione and for an additional 15 min with 60 mm 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (MESNa). Free sulfhydryl groups were blocked by washing the cells three times with 50 mm glycine in PBS. The cells were then lysed in 1× radioimmune precipitation buffer, and viral proteins were immunoprecipitated with serum from an individual infected with HIV-1. Following immunoprecipitation, 90% of the material was boiled in 10% SDS, while the remaining 10% of the material was analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE to assess the amount of total Env in each sample. Biotinylated Env was recovered with streptavidin-agarose, followed by SDS-PAGE. The intensity of the Env signal was quantified using the Instant ImagerTM system. The proportion of internalized Env was determined by subtracting for each time point the activity of the glutathione/MESNa-resistant biotin-tagged Env at 0 °C from the activity of the glutathione/MESNa-resistant biotin-tagged Env at 37 °C and dividing the remaining activity by one-hundredth of the activity of Env from cells that had not undergone reduction. The overall goal of our work is to identify proteins interacting with the cytosolic domain of HIV-1 Env. Since Env is rapidly retrieved from the cell surface after its transport to the plasma membrane (7Rowell J.F. Stanhope P.E. Siliciano R.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 473-488PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether Env interacts with the clathrin-associated protein complex AP-2. As shown in Fig. 1, AP-2 was detected in anti-Env immunoprecipitates from chronically infected lymphocytes but not in anti-Env immunoprecipitates from noninfected cells. A detailed analysis of the requirements for the observed Env-AP-2 interaction cannot be performed in infected cells, because many mutations in Env will affect the efficiency of viral replication and consequently also the levels of Env expression. Env-AP-2 interactions were therefore analyzed in more detail in vitro. The cytosolic domain of Env contains two motifs that strongly resemble tyrosine-based endocytosis signals, one at position 712 (Y712SPL) and the other at position 768 (Y768HRL) (Fig. 3 A). Both motifs are well conserved among different strains of HIV-1 (18). Recently, the medium chain (μ2) of the clathrin-associated protein complex AP-2 was found to interact with tyrosine-based signals conforming to the canonical motif YXXØ, where X is any amino acid and Ø is a an amino acid with a bulky hydrophobic side chain (13Ohno H.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29009-29015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to test whether the cytosolic domain of Env of HIV-1 associates with μ2. The cytosolic tail was expressed as a GST fusion protein (GST-EnvCD) in E. coli. The medium chain (μ2) of the clathrin-associated protein complex AP-2 was translatedin vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Fig. 2 shows that μ2 bound to GST-EnvCD but not to GST. For comparison, one-tenth of the in vitrotranslated μ2 is shown in the first lane. Typically, about 5–15% of the in vitro translated μ2 bound to GST-EnvCD.Figure 2Binding of the cytosolic domain of HIV-1 Env and μ2. In vitro translated [35S]Met-labeled μ2 was incubated for 2 h with bacterially expressed GST (lane 3) or a fusion protein consisting of the whole cytosolic domain of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein fused to GST (GST-EnvCD, lane 4). Binding of μ2 to the immobilized recombinant proteins was analyzed on SDS-PAGE. For comparison, one-tenth of the in vitro produced μ2 was applied to lane 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To identify the binding site for μ2 in the cytosolic domain of Env, we tested the interaction of μ2 with various Env tail deletion mutants (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). Deletions that did not affect the membrane-proximal tyrosine motif Y712SPL had little or no effect on the association of μ2 with the cytosolic tail. Deletion of a region containing this membrane-proximal tyrosine-based motif, however, severely reduced the binding of μ2 to the cytosolic tail. In contrast, a deletion of region containing the motif Y768HRL had less of an effect. A more detailed analysis of the requirements for μ2 binding was then performed using mutants where single amino acids were mutated to alanine (Fig. 3 C). As expected from the results shown in Fig. 3 B, mutation of Tyr768 had very little impact on the binding of μ2 to the cytosolic domain of Env. Similarly, substitutions of amino acids Arg709, Gln710, or Ser713, respectively, by alanine influenced binding of μ2 only marginally. In contrast, binding of μ2 was decreased by mutation of Gly711 or Pro714 and even more dramatically by mutation of Tyr712 or Leu715. Thus, residues in the membrane-proximal tyrosine-based motif but not in the membrane-distal one are critical for the binding. Although the specificity of the binding of μ2 to the cytosolic domain of Env of HIV-1 was apparent from the effects on binding of the deletion mutants and single amino acid substitutions, we corroborated these results by testing the ability of different peptides to inhibit the binding of μ2 to EnvCD. If protein-protein complexes were allowed to form in the presence of the peptide RRQGYSPL, binding of μ2 was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. No inhibition was observed if binding was performed in the presence of the peptide RRQGASPL, further confirming the specificity of this interaction (Fig. 4). Most interestingly, the peptide RRFSYHRL, the sequence of which conforms to the distal tyrosine-based signal, also interfered with the binding of μ2, while the tyrosine-mutated version of the same peptide did not. Thus, while the sequence YHRL within the context of the complete cytosolic domain of Env contributed very little to the binding of μ2 (see Fig. 3), it still was a potent μ2 binding element in the form of a small peptide. To test whether the same region of the cytosolic domain of Env important for μ2 binding represents the binding motif for intact AP-2 complexes, beads coated with some of our GST-EnvCD fusion proteins were incubated with cytosol of T cells and washed three times, and bound material was eluted. After SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting was performed using antibodies against either of the two large chains of the AP-2 complex (Fig. 5). Whereas the wild-type EnvCD, as well as the Y768C mutant, precipitated α and β-adaptin, the Y712A mutant did not. Substitution of Gly711 for alanine, however, still allowed for the precipitation of some α- and β-adaptin. These results demonstrate that the association of not only the isolated medium chain μ2 but also the intact AP-2 complex with the cytosolic domain of Env is critically dependent on the integrity of the membrane-proximal sequence Y712SPL. In addition, Gly711 also contributes to the binding of EnvCD to AP-2. The functional importance of some residues in the cytosolic domain of Env in its sorting to intracellular compartments was assessed using a biochemical internalization assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). None of the deletion mutants was tested for endocytosis, because the cytosolic domain of Env partially overlaps with the viral Rev function, which is necessary for Env expression in intact cells (22Hammarskjöld M.-L. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fig. 6shows the results of our internalization studies for three of the mutants where single amino acids had been substituted. The same mutations in the cytosolic domain of Env that led to a decrease in association with μ2 and the intact AP-2 complex (see Figs. 3 C and 5, respectively) also reduced Env internalization. On the other hand, mutation of Tyr768, which had little effect on μ2/AP-2 binding, did not affect endocytosis of Env. Using a fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based endocytosis assay, Siliciano and colleagues (7Rowell J.F. Stanhope P.E. Siliciano R.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 473-488PubMed Google Scholar) had already demonstrated that the Tyr712in the membrane-proximal motif but not Tyr768 in the membrane-distal motif was important for internalization of Env from the cell surface. Our data thus confirm those results and also show that glycine at position −1 with respect to the membrane-proximal Y712SPL motif (Gly711) influences the recruitment of Env into clathrin-coated pits. Most importantly, these data establish a correlation between the binding of the cytosolic domain of Env to μ2, as well as to the intact AP2 complex, in vitro and the efficiency of Env internalization in vivo. The intracellular domain of HIV-1 Env is absolutely required for viral dissemination, but very little is known about its functions. This prompted us to look for proteins interacting with the cytosolic domain of Env. Here we report that the medium chain μ2 of the clathrin-associated protein complex AP-2 as well as the complete AP-2 complex binds the cytosolic domain of Env fused to GST. Furthermore, Env and AP-2 form a complex in vivo, i.e. in infected lymphocytes. Binding of μ2/AP-2 to the cytosolic domain of Env correlates well with Env internalization from the cell surface. Such fusion proteins may therefore be useful not only as probes to identify other proteins interacting with the cytosolic domain of Env but also to analyze the requirements of functional interactions of the adaptor protein complexes or its subunits with the cytosolic domain of Env. Determinants in the cytosolic domain of Env have been implicated in the directed release of HIV-1 observed in polarized epithelial cells as well as in the retrieval of Env from the cell surface (7Rowell J.F. Stanhope P.E. Siliciano R.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 473-488PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sauter M.M. Pelchen-Matthews A. Bron R. Marsh M. LaBranche C.C. Vance P.J. Romano J. Haggarty B.S. Hart T.K.

In both instances, a membrane-proximal tyrosine (Tyr712) was demonstrated to be part of the signal(s) responsible for the respective sorting process. Tyrosines have been identified as critical components of sorting signals in the cytosolic domains of different cellular membrane proteins destined for various cellular compartments (10Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar, 12Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Together, these data led us to investigate whether the cytosolic domain of Env interacts with elements of the cellular sorting machinery. As a probe, we used a protein where GST was fused to the cytosolic domain of Env. It was demonstrated previously that GST fusion proteins containing tyrosine-based sorting signals can bind proteins involved in the sorting of cellular membrane proteins (13Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated that the cytosolic domain of Env in the context of a GST fusion protein binds to μ2. Such an interaction between the whole cytosolic domain of Env and μ2 was not observed in the yeast two-hybrid system, 3H. Ohno and J. Bonifacino, unpublished observations. thus demonstrating the usefulness of the in vitro binding approach in order to study these interactions. Having established that the cytosolic domain of Env in the context of a GST fusion protein can bind to μ2, we sought to define the requirements for this interaction. The cytosolic domain of Env contains two YXXØ motifs. Both motifs are highly conserved among almost all primary viral isolates analyzed so far (18), indicating that they belong to functionally important regions of this domain. The results of the present study demonstrate that only the membrane-proximal tyrosine-based motif Y712SPL, but not the more C-terminally located motif Y768HRL, is important for μ2 binding. The lack of a contribution of the YHRL motif to μ2 binding was not due to a lower intrinsic affinity of this motif for μ2. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, Ohno et al. (25Ohno H. Aguilar R.C. Fournier M.C. Hennecke S. Cosson P. Bonifacino J.S. Virology. 1997; 238: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) recently showed that the membrane-distal motif as such can bind to μ2. Our peptide competition experiments shown in Fig. 4 indicated that the YHRL motif may have even a slightly higher affinity for μ2. The results of the in vitro binding assays presented here thus suggest that μ2 cannot access the YHRL motif in the context of the whole cytosolic domain. Support for this hypothesis is provided by the analysis of Env internalization (Fig. 6). Our analysis as well as a previous study (7Rowell J.F. Stanhope P.E. Siliciano R.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 473-488PubMed Google Scholar) found that tyrosine at position 712 but not tyrosine at position 768 is critical for Env internalization. Remarkably, the correlation between binding of μ2 to the cytosolic domain of Env and endocytosis of Env holds even for the Gly711 to Ala mutant. Glycine at position −1 relative to the critical Y712SPL motif has not been previously recognized to influence the internalization of membrane receptors. Mutant G711A showed an intermediate phenotype in the μ2 binding assay as well as in the endocytosis assay. Together, our data suggest that binding of μ2 to the cytosolic domain of Env defines the specificity for the recruitment of the protein by the AP-2 complex. Therefore, we tested whether the cytosolic domain of Env also associates with the intact AP-2 complexin vitro and, if so, whether the specificity of binding to EnvCD was the same for μ2 and the intact complex. Our results showed, first, that EnvCD-AP-2 association was likewise dependent on the intactness of the membrane-proximal but not of the membrane-distal tyrosine-based motif. Second, we could reproducibly precipitate the large chains α- and β-adaptin of AP-2 with the Gly711to alanine mutant, although its interaction with the intact AP-2 complex may be weaker than its association with μ2. Therefore, the strength of interaction of μ2 with cognate signals in the cytosolic domains of membrane proteins may be modulated by an interaction of μ2 with the other subunits of AP-2. Appropriate spacing of the tyrosine signal was shown to be crucial for the sorting of a cellular protein to lysosomes (26Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Russell D. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), presumably mediated by the AP-1 complex. A possible explanation for the different recognition by μ2/AP-2 of the Y712SPL motif and the Y768HRL motif may thus be due to different placement relative to the plasma membrane. Alternatively, folding of the cytosolic domain of Env may be such that Y768HRL is not accessible to μ2/AP-2. The Y768HRL motif is positioned within one of two amphipathic regions of the cytosolic domain of Env that have been proposed to associate with the inner face of the plasma membrane (27Haffar O.K. Dowbenko D.J. Berman P.W. Virology. 1991; 180: 439-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 28Srinivas S.K. Srinivas R.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Compans R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7121-7127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It could thus be that the conformational context of the Y768HRL motif in vivo prevents its recognition by the AP-2 complex in cells. The situation may be different for the region close to the membrane-spanning domain of Env. This region is predicted to form neither α-helices nor β-sheets (29Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Y712SPL motif within that context may thus adopt the “tight turn” structure, which was predicted to be the conformational determinant shared by tyrosine-based internalization signals (30Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Our results do not allow us to exclude the possibility that the membrane-distal motif contributes to the EnvCD-AP-2 binding but that the interaction with Tyr768 is dependent on the interaction of AP-2 with the membrane-proximal motif. However, since the Tyr768 to Cys mutation does not affect Env internalization (Fig. 6), we do not consider this to be a very likely scenario. Preliminary results suggest that the described Env fusion proteins not only bind with remarkable specificity to μ2/AP-2 but that they can also selectively interact with other cellular sorting complexes. Work is in progress to test whether the association with those complexes also correlates with the in vivo sorting of Env. Such an analysis is particularly desirable with regard to the membrane-proximal region of the Env tail, which is involved not only in Env endocytosis (Ref. 7Rowell J.F. Stanhope P.E. Siliciano R.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 473-488PubMed Google Scholar and this study) but also in the polarized sorting of Env (24Lodge R. Lalonde J.P. Lemay G. Cohen E.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This situation is reminiscent of the co-linearity of endocytosis signals and basolateral sorting signals that is observed in a number of cellular proteins (31Rodriguez-Boulan E. Zurzolo C. J. Cell. Sci. 1993; 17: 9-12Crossref Google Scholar). In summary, these studies show that the μ2 subunit of AP-2 as well as the intact AP-2 complex bind to a tyrosine-based signal within cytosolic domain of Env involved in endocytosis. A second tyrosine-based motif in the cytosolic tail of Env that is not relevant for Env internalization seems to be largely shielded from recognition by μ2/AP-2. In all, our data describe a case where components of the cellular sorting machinery discriminate between two potential binding sites based on their position in the cytosolic domain of the protein. Thus, our data demonstrate that it is not possible to predict if a putative μ2 binding sequence will function in vivo, based on in vitro studies alone, underscoring the importance of corroborating data from binding experiments with functional studiesin vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2164116473,"Growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) binding to their receptors, which belong to the cytokine receptor superfamily, activate Janus kinase (JAK) 2 tyrosine kinase, thereby leading to their biological actions. We recently showed that GH mainly stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor and its association with Grb2, and concomitantly stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase activity in liver, a major target tissue. Using specific antibodies, we now show that GH was also able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1/IRS-2 in liver. In addition, the major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in anti-p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) immunoprecipitate from liver of wild-type mice was IRS-1, and IRS-2 in IRS-1 deficient mice, but not epidermal growth factor receptor. These data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 may be a major mechanism for GH-induced PI3-kinase activation in physiological target organ of GH, liver. We also show that PRL was able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of both IRS-1 and IRS-2 in COS cells transiently transfected with PRLR and in CHO-PRLR cells. Moreover, we show that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-3 was induced by both GH and PRL in COS cells transiently transfected with IRS-3 and their cognate receptors. By using the JAK2-deficient cell lines or by expressing a dominant negative JAK2 mutant, we show that JAK2 is required for the GH- and PRL-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, -2, and -3. Finally, a specific PI3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, completely blocked the anti-lipolytic effect of GH in 3T3 L1 adipocytes. Taken together, the role of IRS-1, -2, and -3 in GH and PRL signalings appears to be phosphorylated by JAK2, thereby providing docking sites for p85 PI3-kinase and activating PI3-kinase and its downstream biological effects."

To clarify the biochemical events that may be responsible for the genotoxic and carcinogenic effects observed in this transgenic model, several parameters of redox homeostasis in the liver were examined prior to development of hepatic tumors. By 2 months of age, production of reactive oxygen species, determined by the peroxidation-sensitive fluorescent dye, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate, was significantly elevated in TGF-α/c-myctransgenic hepatocytes versus either wild type or c-myc single transgenic cells, and occurred in parallel with an increase in lipid peroxidation. Concomitantly with a rise in oxidant levels, antioxidant defenses were decreased, including total glutathione content and the activity of glutathione peroxidase, whereas thioredoxin reductase activity was not changed. However, hepatic tumors which developed in TGF-α/c-myc mice exhibited an increase in thioredoxin reductase activity and a very low activity of glutathione peroxidase. Furthermore, specific deletions were detected in mtDNA as early as 5 weeks of age in the transgenic mice. These data provide experimental evidence that co-expression of TGF-α and c-myc transgenes in mouse liver promotes overproduction of reactive oxygen species and thus creates an oxidative stress environment. This phenomenon may account for the massive DNA damage and acceleration of hepatocarcinogenesis observed in the TGF-α/c-myc mouse model.

Current knowledge suggests that endogenous oxidants generated by multiple intracellular pathways may be considered as an important class of naturally occurring carcinogens (1Cerutti P.A. Trump B.F.

The term encompasses many species including superoxide (O·̄2), hydroxyl (HO⋅), peroxyl (RO2·), and alkoxyl (RO⋅) radicals, and certain nonradicals such as singlet oxygen (1O2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) that can be easily converted into radicals. ROS can produce genetic mutations as well as gross chromosomal alterations and thus contribute to cancer development at initiation, promotion and progression stages (4Cerutti P.A. Lancet. 1994; 344: 862-863Abstract PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 5Wiseman H. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar). There is also accumulating evidence that oxidative damage to DNA may play a critical role in aging (6Ames B.N. Shigenaga M.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

In addition, a number of recent studies have demonstrated that ROS at submicromolar levels act as novel intra- and intercellular second messengers and thus modulate various aspects of cellular functions including proliferation, apoptosis and gene expression (8Suzuki Y.J.

Although the chemical nature of the ROS generated in response to the activation of various receptors has not been well characterized, H2O2 has been shown to be a major component of ROS in cells treated with EGF, platelet-derived growth factor, or TGF-β1 (12Sundaresan M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30334-30338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The stimulation of ROS production by TGF-α either in vitroor in vivo has not been yet reported. TGF-α is a member of a family of growth factors which elicit their growth regulation by triggering the EGF receptor signaling cascade (25Luetteke N.S. Lee D.C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 265-276PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously found that cooperation of TGF-α and c-myc pathways in the liver cells is extremely efficient in acceleration of hepatocarcinogenesis in double transgenic mice (26Murakami H. Sanderson N.D. Nagy P. Marino P.A. Merlino G. Thorgeirsson S.S. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1719-1723PubMed Google Scholar, 27Santoni-Rugiu E. Nagy P. Jensen M.R. Factor V.M. Thorgeirsson S.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 407-428PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, TGF-α/c-myc mice not only developed tumors more rapidly than either of the parental lines, but the multiplicity and tumor size were significantly increased, indicating escalation of both initiation and promotion stages of cancer development. Two hallmarks of hepatocarcinogenesis associated with TGF-α/c-myc signaling are widespread dysplasia (27Santoni-Rugiu E. Nagy P. Jensen M.R. Factor V.M. Thorgeirsson S.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 407-428PubMed Google Scholar) and profound chromosomal abnormalities (28Sargent L.M. Sanderson N.D. Thorgeirsson S.S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2137-2142PubMed Google Scholar). The rapid development of a dysplastic phenotype preceded the early onset of liver tumor growth and was associated with marked cellular enlargement, up-regulation of TGF-β1 gene expression and growth cessation indicative of premature senescence (29Kao C.Y. Factor V.M. Thorgeirsson S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,30Factor V.M. Jensen M.R. Thorgeirsson S.S. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 1434-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the most remarkable biological consequence of constitutive co-expression of TGF-α and c-myc transgenes was severe DNA damage. In 2-month-old double transgenic hepatocytes, the frequency of chromosomal breakage was increased nearly 10-fold, whereas the number of aberrations observed in c-myc and TGF-α single transgenic hepatocytes was only 1.3- and 3-times background, respectively (28Sargent L.M. Sanderson N.D. Thorgeirsson S.S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2137-2142PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the presence of nonrandom chromosomal breaks recorded prior to tumor development and persistent enhancement of chromosomal damage in hepatocellular carcinomas 2L. M. Sargent, X. Zhou, C. L. Keck, N. D. Sanderson, D. B. Zimonjic, N. C. Popescu, and S. S. Thorgeirsson, manuscript in preparation. 2L. M. Sargent, X. Zhou, C. L. Keck, N. D. Sanderson, D. B. Zimonjic, N. C. Popescu, and S. S. Thorgeirsson, manuscript in preparation. suggested that TGF-α/c-myc hepatocytes exhibited a mutator phenotype (4Cerutti P.A. Lancet. 1994; 344: 862-863Abstract PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Given the known carcinogenic properties of ROS, we hypothesized that enhanced metabolic generation of oxygen radicals in rapidly proliferating TGF-α/c-myc transgenic hepatocytes might be responsible for genetic instability and acceleration of liver cancer in this animal model. The present study was undertaken to examine whether the chronic activation of mitogenic signaling induced by overexpression of c-myc and TGF-α transgenes creates a state of oxidative stress in mouse liver. The following chemicals were used: collagenase (type H) (Boehringer Mannheim), and 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). GSH, glutathione assay kit, glutathione peroxidase assay kit, and lipid peroxidation kit were purchased from Calbiochem, G NOME DNA isolation kit was from BIO 101, Inc. (Vista, CA), and protein assay was from Bio-Rad. Male c-myc single transgenic, TGF-α/c-myc double transgenic and wild type (WT) mice were generated in (CD1 × B6CBA)F1 background as described previously (26Murakami H. Sanderson N.D. Nagy P. Marino P.A. Merlino G. Thorgeirsson S.S. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1719-1723PubMed Google Scholar, 30Factor V.M. Jensen M.R. Thorgeirsson S.S.

Cell. 1990; 61: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The animal study protocols were conducted according to National Institutes of Health guidelines for animal care. Mice were fed a standard rodent chow and water ad libitum. Hepatocytes were isolated by two-step collagenase perfusion of the liver followed by isodensity centrifugation in Percoll as described previously (29Kao C.Y. Factor V.M. Thorgeirsson S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion and was typically greater than 90%. To assess levels of intracellular ROS, flow cytometric analysis was performed using the oxidative-sensitive probe DCFH-DA as described (32Bass D.A. Parce J.W. Dechatelet L.R. Szejda P. Seeds M.C. Thomas M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 1910-1917PubMed Google Scholar,33Hagen T.M. Yowe D.L. Bartholomew J.C. Wehr C.M. Do K.L. Park J.Y. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3064-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes (0.5 × 106/ml) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C either in the presence or absence of 5 μmDCFH-DA. After incubation, the cells were transferred to an ice water bath, and formation of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) was analyzed by flow cytometry using a Becton Dickinson FACSCAN with excitation and emission settings of 495 and 525 nm, respectively. The DNA of dead cells was stained with propidium iodine (5 μm/ml) before the measurement of DCF fluorescence. Ten thousand propidium iodine-negative viable cells from duplicate samples were analyzed per point. Relative fluorescence intensity was calculated as the difference between DCF fluorescence and autofluorescence measured in unstained cell suspensions for each cell preparation analyzed. Values were converted from log fluorescence to linear fluorescence intensity by application of the equation (34Sharrow S.O. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1991: 5.2.1-5.2.10Google Scholar): relative fluorescence intensity = 10[(Ch#exp-Ch#ctl)/256], where Ch#exp = measured mean channel number of experimental sample stained with DCFH-DA; Ch#ctl = measured mean channel number of negative control (in the absence of dye); and 256 = number of channels per decade with 4-decade log amplification. Tissue assays were performed on livers washed free of blood via retrograde venous perfusion with 0.9% NaCl containing either 0.16 mg/ml heparin or EDTA as anticoagulant. Liver tissue was rinsed in ice-cold saline, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −70 °C prior to use. The concentration of GSH in liver homogenates (5% w/v in 5% metaphosphoric acid) was determined by a colorimetric assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. A standard curve was generated using known quantities of GSH. The contents of malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxylalkenals (4-HNE) in liver homogenates prepared in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (10% w/v), were determined by a colorimetric assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. A standard curve was generated using known quantities of 4-hydroxynonenal as the diethylacetal, in acetonitrile. Tissue samples were homogenized in two volumes of ice-cold buffer containing 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm EDTA, 10 μg of aprotinin, 10 μg of leupeptin, and 10 μg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cellular GPx activities were determined utilizing a standard GPx assay kit following the manufacturer's instructions. GPx enzymatic activity was monitored in Hewlett Packard diode-array spectrophotometer as the rate of NADPH oxidation at 340 nm. One unit of GPx will oxidize 1 μmol of NADPH/min at 30 °C. Thioredoxin reductase activities in tissue homogenates were determined using the NADPH-dependent reduction of 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) method essentially as described previously (35Tamura T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1006-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The tissue homogenates were prepared as above for GPx determinations and the assay mixtures (1 ml) contained 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.24 mmNADPH, bovine serum albumin (0.2 mg/ml), and 2.5 mm5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (50 μl of a 50 mmsolution in absolute ethanol). The change in absorbance at 412 nm was monitored over 1 min at 30 °C. Activity was defined as micromoles of NADPH oxidized per min by ΔA 412/(13.6 × 2), since 1 mol of NADPH yields 2 mol of thionitrobenzoate. Plasma was collected from retro-orbital puncture. The concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, triglycerides, and total cholesterol were measured utilizing an automated multichannel analyzer (Anilytics Incorporated, Gaithersburg, MD). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad detergent-compatible protein assay with bovine serum albumin as the protein standard. Total DNA was isolated from liver samples using the G NOME DNA isolation kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Detection of mtDNA deletion present in the direct repeats of mtDNA (direct repeat 17 corresponding to bp 979–5650 of mouse mtDNA) (36Tanhauser S.M. Laipis P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24769-24775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) was performed by PCR utilizing the primers AGTCGTAACAAGGTAAGCAT (bp 1094–1113) and ATGCTAGGAGAAGGAGAAAT (bp 4915–4934) and the following conditions: denaturation (96 °C, 40 s); primer annealing (50 °C, 30 s); primer extension (72 °C, 2 min); 35 cycles. The PCR product of the intact repeat is 4671 bp, while the predicted size of the deletion between the direct repeats is 3821 bp, producing a PCR deletion product of 851 bp. The PCR products were analyzed on a 1% Tris-acetate-EDTA-agarose gel and visualized using ethidium bromide. Fragments of liver were fixed in a 100 mm phosphate-buffered solution (pH 7.4) of 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% neutral formaldehyde for 4 h and then postfixed in 100 mm phosphate-buffered 1% osmium tetroxide solution for an additional 2 h. After embedding in Epon 812, ultrathin sections were cut with a Diatome diamond knife on LKB ULTRATOM III ultratome (LKB Ultratome, Uppsala, Sweden), then contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined on a JEOL 100CX transmission electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan). Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. The significance of the difference of means was determined by the paired Student's t test. To determine whether TGF-α/c-mychepatocytes generate higher levels of ROS, DCFH-DA was utilized as a substrate for detection of H2O2 and other hydroperoxides (32Bass D.A. Parce J.W. Dechatelet L.R. Szejda P. Seeds M.C. Thomas M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 1910-1917PubMed Google Scholar, 37Cathcart R. Schwiers E. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 134: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 38Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). This assay involves the incorporation of the nonpolar compound, DCFH-DA, into the hydrophobic regions of the cell where it is hydrolyzed to DCFH. In the presence of appropriate oxidants, DCFH gives rise to DCF, which is membrane-impermeable and highly fluorescent, and can be detected by fluorescent-activated sorter analysis. Fig. 1 A demonstrates that the rate of oxidation of DCFH-DA to DCF was comparable in 5-week-old WT, c-myc, and TGF-α/c-myc mice. However, by 10 weeks of age, double transgenic hepatocytes generated significantly greater amounts of peroxides, as shown by a shift to the right in the mean logarithmic fluorescence intensity to that of c-myc and WT mice (Fig. 1 B). Quantitative measurements showed that the levels of peroxide production was increased by 8.2-fold in TGF-α/c-myc transgenic hepatocytes versus 3.2-fold in c-myc cells between 5 and 10 weeks of age. No significant difference was found between the mean DCF fluorescence intensity in WT hepatocytes over a period of the first 2 months of life (Fig. 1 A). We next examined the rate of lipid peroxidation as a downstream measure of accumulated oxidative damage to membrane lipids. Lipid peroxidation is important because it amplifies the free radical process, and because its products could lead to cellular and tissue damage (39Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5821) Google Scholar). No differences were found in the tissue content of 4-HNE and malondialdehyde, the major aldehyde end products of membrane lipid peroxidation, in liver samples from WT and c-myc mice (Fig. 2). In contrast, approximately 2-fold higher levels of 4-HNE and malondialdehyde were present in TGF-α/c-myc livers compared with either age-matched WT or c-myc mice. In addition, double transgenic livers exhibited a greater sensitivity to collagenase perfusion and consistently yielded 3–5-fold less viable hepatocytes than age-matched WT controls, as judged by cell counting and trypan blue exclusion (data not shown), indicating altered membrane properties. Furthermore, by 10 weeks of age, c-myc and TGF-α/c-myc mice showed a 2- and 4-fold increase in the plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase, respectively (Fig. 3 A), apparently as a consequence of cumulative free radical cytotoxic activity. In addition, double transgenic mice had higher plasma levels of cholesterol (Fig. 3 B) and triglyceride (not shown). Histologically, TGF-α/c-myc hepatocytes displayed signs of “fatty liver” phenotype (Fig. 4 B) further suggesting a disorder in a lipid metabolism. Together, these data demonstrate that co-expression of TGF-α and c-myc transgenes in mouse liver results in the creation of an oxidative stress environment and tissue damage starting at a very young age.Figure 3Plasma concentration of alanine aminotransferase (A) and cholesterol (B) in WT, c-myc, and TGF-α/c-myc mice. The data are mean ± S.E., n = 5 in each age group of mice. *p < 0.003 when compared with age-matched WT or c-myc mice; **p < 0.02 when compared with age-matched c-myc mice by Student's ttest.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4TGF-α/c-myc hepatocytes exhibit signs of fatty liver phenotype.

Med. 1997; 22: 1259-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we next assayed the effects of increased ROS production on mtDNA damage. For this we used a PCR approach and screened hepatic DNA for large 3821-bp mtDNA deletions associated with direct sequence repeats normally present in aging mice (36Tanhauser S.M. Laipis P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24769-24775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that this deletion was undetectable in 5- and 10-week-old WT livers in the absence of oxidative stress. In contrast, the deletion was readily detectable in both c-myc and TGF-α/c-myc mice as early as 5 weeks of age. The amount of deletion product was more extensive in the TGF-α/c-myc livers which produced higher levels of peroxides (Fig. 1). The presence of early mtDNA damage did not correlate with the loss of mitochondrial morphology. Electron microscopy showed no clear evidence of swelling or degeneration of mitochondria in randomly examined TGF-α/c-myc hepatocytes at 10 weeks of age. However, double transgenic hepatocytes from 10-week-old mice contained frequent residual bodies or lipofuscin granules and secondary lysosomes carrying various cytoplasmic organelles (Fig. 6 A andB). These structures are found in large numbers in senescent cells in vivo as well as in aging cells of diverse organisms and are recognized as morphological signs of aging (41Brunk U.T. Collins V.P. Sohal R.S. Age Pigments. Elsevier/North Holland Biomedical Press, Elsevier, Amsterdam1981: 243-264Google Scholar, 42Rubin H. Chow M. Yao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4392) Google Scholar). GSH regulates the intracellular concentration of ROS via reactions catalyzed by GPx (44Ursini F. Maiorino M. Brigelius-Flohe R. Aumann K.D. Roveri A. Schomburg D. Flohe L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 38-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). We thus determined whether modulation of GSH levels and activity of cytosolic GPx, the major glutathione peroxidase isozyme present in liver (45Frampton J. Conkie D. Chambers I. McBain W. Dexter M. Harrison P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 3671-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), contribute to development of oxidative stress in TGF-α/c-myc livers. In WT mice, the amount of cellular GSH was about 35% lower (p < 0.001) in 5-week-old than in 10-week-old livers (Fig. 7). These results indicate that the GSH system is not fully developed in the maturing mouse livers at 5 weeks. Both transgenic lines showed a similar pattern of expression of cellular GSH during liver ontogenesis, but the amount of GSH was consistently lower in the transgenic animals as compared with WT controls (Fig. 7). In contrast, the activity of GPx, a key antioxidant enzyme, was decreased only in TGF-α/c-myc and not in c-myc livers (Fig. 8 A), concomitant with elevation in lipid peroxidation (Fig. 2). It is noteworthy that there was no significant difference in the activity of GPx in liver samples from WT and c-myc mice of different ages. However, the activity of GPx increased in TGF-α/c-myc livers in an age-dependent manner. This induction of GPx activity may be an adaptive response to compensate for increased oxidative stress in double transgenic livers consistent with reports in aging livers (46Ji L.L. Dillon D. Wu E. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: R918-R923PubMed Google Scholar,47Powers S.K. Lawler J. Criswell D. Lieu F.K. Martin D. J. Appl. Physiol. 1992; 72: 1068-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the tumors which developed in TGF-α/c-myc livers displayed very little GPx activity (16% of peritumoral levels) (Fig. 8 A). We next examined the activity of thioredoxin reductase, a cellular selenocysteine-containing protein (48Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W1997204703,"Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), an important element in eukaryotic signal transduction, is synthesized either by phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PtdIns(4)P 5K) from phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) or by phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinase (PtdIns(5)P 4K) from phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PtdIns(5)P). Two Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes, MSS4 and FAB1, are homologous to mammalian PtdIns(4)P 5Ks and PtdIns(5)P 4Ks. We show here that MSS4 is a functional homolog of mammalian PtdIns(4)P 5K but not of PtdIns(5)P 4K in vivo. We constructed a hemagglutinin epitope-tagged form of Mss4p and found that Mss4p has PtdIns(4)P 5K activity. Immunofluorescent and fractionation studies of the epitope-tagged Mss4p suggest that Mss4p is localized on the plasma membrane, whereas Fab1p is reportedly localized on the vacuolar membrane. A temperature-sensitive mss4-1 mutant was isolated, and its phenotypes at restrictive temperatures were found to include increased cell size, round shape, random distribution of actin patches, and delocalized staining of cell wall chitin. Thus, biochemical and genetic analyses on Mss4p indicated that yeast PtdIns(4)P 5K localized on the plasma membrane is required for actin organization. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), an important element in eukaryotic signal transduction, is synthesized either by phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PtdIns(4)P 5K) from phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) or by phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinase (PtdIns(5)P 4K) from phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PtdIns(5)P).

Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate; PtdIns(4)P 5K, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate; PLD, phospholipase D; PIPK, phosphatidylinositol phosphokinase; FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; kb, kilobase(s); anti-HA, anti-hemagglutinin. has been recognized as an important element in eukaryotic signal transduction. Hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 by phospholipase C produces two second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol. IP3 mobilizes Ca2+ from intracellular stores, such as the endoplasmic reticulum in animal cells (1Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1984; 312: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar) and vacuoles in plants (2Schumaker K.S. Sze H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3944-3946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and yeast (3Belde P.J.M. Vossen J.H. Borst-Pauwels G.W.F.H. Theuvenet A.P.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is well known that the elevated intracellular Ca2+stimulates a variety of calcium-modulating signaling enzymes, including calmodulin-dependent protein kinases and calcineurin, a type II B phosphoprotein phosphatase (4Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol, on the other hand, activates the conventional isoforms of protein kinase C, which in turn play a critical role in the regulation of a number of cellular functions in mammalian cells (5Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3537) Google Scholar). In the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, a protein kinase C-homologous gene (PKC1) was isolated (6Levin D.E. Fields F.O. Kunisawa R. Bishopp J.M. Thorner J. Cell. 1990; 62: 213-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), whose product was shown to function in cell wall integrity and cell cycle progression (7Levin D.E. Bartlettt-Heubusch E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1221-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 8Yoshida S. Ikeda E. Uno I. Mitsuzawa H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 231: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In vitro studies of Pkc1p, however, indicated that Pkc1p is strongly activated by phosphatidylserine in the presence of Rho1p, but not by diacylglycerol (9Kamada Y. Qadota H. Python C.P. Anraku Y. Ohya Y. Levin D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9193-9196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The stimulation by phosphatidylserine alone is characteristic of the atypical ζ isoform of protein kinase C, which is stimulated by phosphatidylserine alone. Since the biochemical property of Pkc1p is different from that of the conventional isoforms of mammalian protein kinase C, it remains unclear whether and how diacylglycerol acts as an important second messenger in S. cerevisiae. PtdIns(4,5)P2 is also known to function as a regulator of actin-binding proteins (10Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 169-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) such as profilin (11Lassing I. Lindberg U. Nature. 1985; 314: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), gelsolin (12Janmey P.A. Stossel T. Nature. 1987; 325: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), and α-actinin of vertebrates (13Fukami K. Furuhashi K. Inagaki M. Endo T. Hatano S. Takenawa T. Nature. 1992; 359: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Recently, profilin was reported to be localized both in the plasma membrane and cytosolic fractions inS. cerevisiae, with the membrane association presumably facilitated by its interaction with phosphatidylinositol metabolites (14Ostrander D.B. Gorman J.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27045-27050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that through its regulation of actin-binding proteins, phosphatidylinositol metabolites affect the cytoskeleton in yeast. Moreover, PtdIns(4,5)P2 stimulates GDP to GTP exchange of ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) (15Terui T. Kahn R.A. Randazzo P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28130-28135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the GTP-bound form of ARF1 triggers the attachment of the coat proteins (16Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 17Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 18Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), PtdIns(4,5)P2 may play a critical role in coat assembly. Interestingly, PtdIns(4,5)P2 was found to work as a cofactor for brain membrane phospholipase D (PLD) (19Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Pertile P. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21403-21406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings led to the proposal that PLD and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase) with their respective products, PtdIns(4,5)P2 and phosphatidic acid, form a positive feedback loop that causes a vesicle fusion with the acceptor membrane (19Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Pertile P. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21403-21406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since PtdIns(4,5)P2 as well as phosphatidic acid activates an ARF GTPase-activating protein (20Randazzo P.A. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10758-10763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), they further postulated that the positive feedback loop is halted by the conversion of active ARF-GTP to ARF-GDP. Thus, PtdIns(4,5)P2 may work as a crucial factor in membrane trafficking. Ins(4,5)P2 is synthesized either from PtdIns(4)P by the phosphorylation on the fifth hydroxyl group of themyo-inositol ring or from PtdIns(5)P by the phosphorylation on the fourth hydroxyl group (21Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PtdIns(4)P 5K) and phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinase (PtdIns(5)P 4K), both of which catalyze PtdIns(4,5)P2synthesis, are functionally different (22Zhang X.

Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Physiological functions of mammalian PtdIns(5)P 4K and PtdIns(4)P 5K, however, remain to be elucidated. The sequences of mammalian PtdIns(4)P 5K and PtdIns(5)P 4K isoforms have homology to those of two yeast gene products, Fab1p and Mss4p (23Boronenkov I. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2881-2884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 24Divecha N. Truong O. Huan J.J. Hinchliffe K.A. Irvine R.F. Biochem.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32937-32943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Though the FAB1 gene is not essential, the product, localized on the vacuolar membrane, is required for the vacuolar function and morphology (27Yamamoto A. DeWald D.B. Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. Emr S.D. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 525-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). MSS4 was originally identified as a multicopy suppressor of the temperature-sensitive mutation in the STT4 gene (28Yoshida S. Ohya Y. Goebl M. Nakano A. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1166-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which encodes an PtdIns 4-kinase, suggesting involvement of Mss4p in PtdIns(4)P metabolism (29Yoshida S. Ohya Y. Nakano A. Anraku Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Since a deletion of the MSS4 gene is lethal, characterization of conditional-lethal mutants of mss4 is useful for understanding the function of MSS4. We report here that Mss4p has PtdIns(4)P 5K activity in vitro and that expression of murine type Iβ PtdIns(4)P 5K functionally replaces MSS4 in vivo. Unlike Fab1p, Mss4p is located primarily on the plasma membrane. Analyses of a temperature-sensitive mss4mutant revealed that Mss4p is involved in the establishment of cell morphology. The yeast strains used are listed in Table I. The complete and minimal yeast media as well as the sporulation medium and procedures of tetrad analysis were as described (30Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). YPGS medium contains 2% galactose, 0.1% sucrose, 1% Bacto-yeast extract, and 2% polypepton, whereas YPA medium for pre-sporulation consists of 1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% polypepton, and 1% potassium acetate (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). Yeast transformation was carried out with lithium acetate (31Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plates containing 0.2% 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA, Sigma) were used to select yeast cells capable of losing a URA3 marked plasmid. E. colistrains, DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) and SCS1 (Stratagene), were used for gene manipulation.

The insertion of the 3.9-kb BamHI-XhoI fragment ofMSS4 into the vector pBluescript SK+ resulted in pYO1956, which was used for the construction of otherMSS4-containing plasmids and as a template for error-prone polymerase chain reaction. pYO1958, which was designed to aidMSS4 gene disruption, mss4::HIS3, was constructed by ligation of the 5.0-kb EcoRI-EcoRI fragment of pYO1956 and the 1.3-kb BamHI-XhoI fragment of pJJ215 containing the HIS3 gene. pYO1959, pYO1960, and pYO1962 were made by inserting the 3.9-kbBamHI-XhoI fragment of pYO1956 containingMSS4 into the BamHI-XhoI gap of pRS315, pRS314, and pRS316, respectively. pYO1964 was formed by replacing the 1.2-kb NdeI-KpnI fragment of pYO1960 with the NdeI-KpnI linker, which was made by annealing the oligomers TATGTGAGATCTGGTAC and CAGATCTCACA.

Open table in a new tab Unless otherwise stated, all of the markers in the parent plasmid are present in the plasmid. The PtdIns(4)P 5K and PtdIns(5)P 4K genes were then inserted to theBglII site of a single-copy plasmid with the GAL1promoter (pYO761) to yield pYO2116 and pYO2117, respectively, and to a multicopy counterpart (pYO767) to produce pYO2118 and pYO2119, respectively. We also inserted the murine and human PIPK genes to theBglII site of a single copy plasmid with the GAPpromoter (pYO2141) to get pYO2142 and pYO2143, respectively. Similar insertions of the PIPK genes to a multicopy plasmid with theGAP promoter (pYO2144) resulted in pYO2145 and pYO2146. We selected and used only those plasmids with the genes whose sequences agreed with the published ones and inserted in the right direction. A 3HA tag was introduced to the N terminus of Mss4p as follows. AnAvrII adaptor was made by annealing the two oligonucleotides, CCGGATCCTAGG and CCGGCCTAGGAT, and was inserted to the AccIII site of pYO1959. After checking the direction of insertion by DNA sequencing, we digested the plasmid withAvrII and ligated it with the NheI-digested 3HA tag of pYO1365. The SphI-XhoI fragment of the resultant plasmid carrying 3HA-tagged MSS4 was inserted to the SphI-XhoI gap of pRS314 and pQR324 to produce plasmids pYO1965 and pYO1966, respectively. Cell lysates were made in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) by vortexing six times for 30 s each with acid-washed glass beads (425–600 μm in diameter, Sigma). After preadsorption with protein A cellulofine (Seikagaku-kogyo, Tokyo), the samples (300 μg of protein, assayed by Bio-Rad protein assay kit) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with saturating amounts of 16B12 anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Berkeley Antibody, Richmond, CA) and then adsorbed to protein A cellulofine. The adsorbed immunoprecipitates were then washed four times with RIPA buffer and four times further with buffer T (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 μm ATP, 0.25 m sucrose, and 0.15m NaCl). To determine the PtdIns(4)P 5K activity in the immunoprecipitates, we incubated 10 μl of sample in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 50 μm ATP, 80 μmPtdIns(4)P (Sigma), and 5.0 or 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence or absence of 50 μm phosphatidic acid in a total volume of 50 μl. After 60 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.4 ml of chloroform/methanol/12 n HCl (100:200:1 by volume). The lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (33Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar), dried, and, together with PtdIns(4,5)P2, which was used as standard, were spotted on Merck Silica gel 60 TLC plates impregnated with 1.2% potassium oxalate, with the exception of the experiment whose result is shown in lanes 4 and 5 of Fig. 1 C, in which a similarly treated Whatman 60A plate was utilized. The samples were separated with the solvent system of chloroform/methanol/acetone/acetic acid/water (42:30:12:12:12 by volume), and [32P]Ins(4,5)P2 was visualized by autoradiography except for the product on the Whatman plate, which was processed by BAS2000 Fuji bioImaging analyzer. We first made an mss4 strain carrying the mutant gene on a centromer plasmid; the 3.1-kb BamHI-XhoI fragment of pYO1958 carrying the mss4::HIS3 gene was used to transform the diploid strain, YPH501. His+transformants were selected, and the disruption of one of the chromosomal MSS4 gene copies was confirmed by Southern hybridization. The MSS4/mss4::HIS3 diploid strain, named YOC801, was transformed with pYO1962 carryingMSS4 and URA3, and the transformants were subjected to tetrad dissection. His+ Ura+ asci were selected and designated YOC802 (mss4::HIS3(pYO1962)). Random mutations were introduced by error-prone polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (34Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Appl. 1992; 2: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar) in the PI(4)P 5-kinase-conserved region ofMSS4 using the two synthetic oligonucleotides, CCTTCTCAAAAGTCAAAGCA and TCGTACTACCGTTCCGGTA, corresponding to bases 841–860 and 2055–2025, respectively. The amplified 1.2-kb fragment was purified, digested with NdeI and KpnI, and then inserted to the NdeI-KpnI gap of pYO1964. Approximately 4,000 independent clones were made, and DNA of the plasmid pool was employed for transformation of YOC802 strain. The transformants that grew on SD-Trp medium at 23 °C were streaked on FOA (−Trp) plates and grown at 23 or 37 °C so that theMSS4-URA3 plasmid is eliminated. Out of 496 transformants that grew in SD-Trp, 15 strains grew on FOA plates at 23 °C but not at 37 °C. Finally, one temperature-sensitive mutation (mss4-1) on plasmid (pYO1970) was further analyzed. The mss4-1 mutation and the wild-type MSS4 gene were integrated into the genome by one-step plasmid integration strategy. We utilized plasmids pYO1974 and pYO1975 digested withSacI and AvrII to transform YOC802 and selected the integrants for the LEU2 marker. After being incubated at 23 °C for 2 days, the cells were streaked on FOA plates and were incubated at 23 °C for 3 days so that theMSS4-URA3 plasmid was eliminated. Single colonies were picked up and were tested for temperature sensitivity. A temperature-sensitive mss4-1 strain was thus obtained and designated YOC808, whereas the MSS4 gene integrated in the same locus was labeled YOC807. Immunofluorescent staining of yeast cells was carried out according to Pringle et al.(35Pringle J.R. Preston R.A. Adams A.E.M. Stearns T. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Jones E.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 31: 357-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to early exponential phase at 30 °C in YPD medium. HA-tagged Mss4p was visualized by indirect immunofluorescence using 16B12 anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody as the first antibody and an fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) as the second antibody. DNA, actin, and chitin were stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes), and calcofluor white M2R new (Sigma), respectively. Cell morphology and fluorescent staining were observed and photographed using a BX60 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo). Cell fractionation experiments were performed using the previously described techniques (36Ohya Y. Caplin B.E. Qadota H. Tibbetts M.F. Anraku Y. Pringle J.R. Marshall M.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A BLAST search of protein sequence data bases revealed that yeast Mss4p has 36, 33, and 31% identity with murine type Iα, type Iβ PtdIns(4)P 5K, and human PtdIns(5)P 4K, respectively, in agreement with previous reports. To examine whether Mss4p is a functional homolog of any of the mammalian phosphatidylinositol phosphokinases (PIPKs) in yeast, we constructed plasmids carrying the genes encoding murine type Iβ PtdIns(4)P 5K and human PtdIns(5)P 4K hooked up to either the constitutive GAP promoter or the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter. After these expression plasmids were introduced to YOC802 strain carryingmss4::HIS3 and a URA3-MSS4 plasmid, the growth on FOA plates was examined. We found that all the transformants expressing the type Iβ PtdIns(4)P 5K gene were capable of growing on FOA plates (Fig. 1 A,panels b and c). On the other hand, expression of the PtdIns(5)P 4K gene failed to complement the MSS4 gene disruption, irrespective of copy number or the promoters used (Fig. 1 A, panels b and c). We next made a temperature-sensitive MSS4 mutant and tested the suppression of the temperature sensitivity by mammalian PIPKs. Mutations were introduced into the conserved region for PIPK within theMSS4 gene, and one of the mutants that grew at 23 °C but not at 37.5 °C (mss4-1) was studied (see “Materials and Methods”). The temperature-sensitive mss4-1 strain was transformed with plasmids containing the two mammalian PIPK genes under the control of the two different promoters to test if the temperature sensitivity is suppressed. When murine type Iβ PtdIns(4)P 5K was expressed under the GAL1 promoter on either the single copy or multicopy plasmid, the strain grew on a galactose-containing plate at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 1 A, panels eand f). On a glucose-containing plate on which the expression of type Iβ PtdIns(4)P 5K under the GAL1promoter is reduced, however, suppression of mss4-1 was observed only with the multicopy plasmid, indicating the failure of suppression when expression is greatly reduced. When the same gene was placed on plasmids under the GAP promoter, the plasmid-harboring strains grew at the restrictive temperature irrespective of the copy number (Fig. 1 A, panels e and f). Murine type Iβ PtdIns(4)P 5K therefore suppresses the temperature sensitivity of mss4-1. In contrast, human PtdIns(5)P 4K failed to suppress the temperature sensitivity in any of the combinations of the plasmids and the promoters tested. Therefore, the functional complementation analysis with the deletion and the temperature-sensitive mutations ofmss4 suggest that MSS4 encodes PtdIns(4)P 5K. To analyze the Mss4p functions, we inserted the 3HA-epitope tag at the N-terminal of Mss4p. Introduction of the 3HA-epitope tag preserves its essential function because the tagged MSS4 with a single copy plasmid can fully complement mss4::HIS3 at all the temperatures examined (23, 30, and 37 °C). These results indicate that the 3HA-tagged Mss4p is functional in vivo. Western blotting analysis of the cells expressing the tagged Mss4p has shown that the anti-HA monoclonal antibody recognized a single band with a molecular mass of 86 kDa, which matched the predicted molecular weight of Mss4p (data not shown). To examine PtdIns(4)P 5K activity of the MSS4gene product, we immunoprecipitated the 3HA-tagged MSS4protein expressed in yeast with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody and determined the kinase activity in the immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1 B). The immunoprecipitate from the YOC804 cells carrying the tagged MSS4 gene on a multicopy plasmid had the highest PtdIns(4)P 5K activity, followed by that from the YOC803 cells, which harbored the same gene on a single copy plasmid, whereas that from the cells with untagged Mss4p (YOC806) exhibited little activity. Furthermore, the PtdIns(4)P 5K activity in the immunoprecipitates was found to be stimulated by the addition of 50 μmphosphatidic acid (Fig. 1 B), a characteristic property of PtdIns(4)P 5K but not of PtdIns(5)P 4K (37Jenkins G.H. Fisette P.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 11547-11554Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the tagged Mss4p possesses PtdIns(4)P 5K activity and that the amount of the kinase activity is copy number-dependent. We examined whether the PtdIns(4)P 5K activity of the mss4-1 mutant changes at the restrictive temperature. We first made a strain with the MSS4 gene disrupted but harboring a 3HA-tagged mss4-1 gene on a multicopy plasmid and designated it YOC823. The strain was cultured at 23 °C, was transferred to 38 °C at early exponential growth phase, and was further cultivated for 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 h before being harvested. The"
https://openalex.org/W1970480600,"The ribotoxic stress response, which is conserved between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, is a cellular reaction to cytotoxic interference with the function of the 3′-end of the large (23 S/28 S) ribosomal RNA. The 3′-end of the large rRNA is directly involved in the three sequential steps of translational elongation: the aminoacyl-tRNA binding, the peptidyl transfer, and the ribosomal translocation. In mammalian cells, the ribotoxic stress response involves activation of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and transcriptional induction of immediate early genes such as c-fos and c-jun. Active ribosomes are essential mediators of the ribotoxic stress response. We demonstrate here that the transcriptional response of mammalian cells to ultraviolet radiation (UV response) displays the characteristics of a ribotoxic stress response, inasmuch as (i) the activation of stress kinases and gene expression in response to UV requires the presence of active ribosomes at the moment of irradiation; (ii) UV irradiation inhibits protein synthesis; and (iii) irradiation of cells with UV causes specific damage to the 3′-end of the 28 S rRNA. In contrast, the activation of the stress kinases by hyperosmolarity, by the DNA-cross-linking agent diepoxybutane, or by growth factors and cytokines does not depend on the presence of active ribosomes. Our results identify UV as a potential ribotoxic stressor and support the notion that some of the cellular signaling cascades in response to UV might be generated in the ribosome, possibly triggered by damage to rRNA.

Baumann B. Cotten M. Angel P. Wagner E.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5338-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The transcriptional induction of c-fos by UV is mediated by phosphorylation of a member of the ternary complex factor family of transcription factors, either Elk-1 or Sap-1 (5Sachsenmaier C.

Several serine/threonine-proline motifs in the transactivation domains of TCFs are targets for phosphorylation by the proline-directed mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (reviewed in Ref. 8Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, all three families of MAP kinases, the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), the stress-activated protein kinases/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (SAPK/JNK), and the p38/RK/Mpk2/CSBP/HOG-1 kinase (hereafter referred to as p38/HOG-1), are activated by UV irradiation (5Sachsenmaier C.

Litfin M. Karin M. Herrlich P. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 301-311PubMed Google Scholar), but the full response of c-fos to UV requires also the cyclic AMP response element proximal to the TATA box (10Iordanov M. Bender K. Ade T. Schmid W. Sachsenmaier C. Engel K. Gaestel M. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Consistently, the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein is also phosphorylated on the crucial serine residue 133 following UV irradiation by a p38/HOG-1-dependent cyclic AMP response element-binding protein kinase (10Iordanov M. Bender K. Ade T. Schmid W. Sachsenmaier C. Engel K. Gaestel M. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, MAP kinases are activated by a broad spectrum of physiological stimuli and adverse environmental agents. In general, the ERK family of MAP kinases mediates the proliferative cellular response to mitogenic growth factors, whereas SAPK/JNK and p38/HOG-1 are thought to be important components of the cellular response to different kinds of stress, including hyperosmotic, genotoxic, and proinflammatory stresses (reviewed in Ref. 8Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). It is plausible that both the degree of incurred cellular damage and interactions with other stress-induced signaling pathways (e.g. activation of the p53 tumor supressor and of the c-Abl protein kinase; Ref. 16Liu Z.-G. Baskaran R. Lea-Chou E.T. Wood L. Chen Y. Karin M. Wang J.Y.J. Nature. 1996; 384: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) allow SAPK/JNK and p38HOG-1 to determine the cell fate favoring either cell survival or apoptotic death. Whereas specific cell surface receptors are undoubtedly the primary sensors for stress induced by proinflammatory cytokines, the nature of the receptive molecules sensing physical agents such as UV remains elusive. A major obstacle to the identification of the proper sensors is that in damaged cells physical agents produce a variety of molecular alterations, some of which are irrelevant to the generation of stress signals. UVB irradiation of HeLa cells causes clustering and multimerization of the receptors for epidermal growth factor (EGF), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-1α/β (IL-1) (17Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Since the same effects were induced by hyperosmotic shock, it has been proposed that UV and hyperosmolarity use similar growth factor/cytokine receptor-dependent signal transduction pathways to activate SAPK/JNK1 (17Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). However, one of us has previously reported that the p38/HOG-1-dependent phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element-binding protein by UVC could not be prevented by a prior functional down-modulation of growth factor receptors (10Iordanov M. Bender K. Ade T. Schmid W. Sachsenmaier C. Engel K. Gaestel M. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Here, we extend this observation to SAPK/JNK1 and provide evidence that the UV-induced activation of SAPK/JNK1 is independent of the action of UV on the TNF-α, IL-1, and EGF receptors. UV-induced damage to DNA has long been considered a possible intermediate for the cellular responses to UV (reviewed in Refs. 2Bender K. Blattner C. Knebel A. Iordanov M. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J.

While the increased susceptibility of xeroderma pigmentosum patients (who are deficient in DNA repair synthesis after UV irradiation) to UV-induced skin cancer clearly establishes a connection between UV-induced DNA damage and UV carcinogenesis, the role of DNA lesions in the immediate early effects of UV (e.g.activation of SAPK/JNK1) is still debated (2Bender K. Blattner C. Knebel A. Iordanov M. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. Biol. 1997; 37: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Enucleated HeLa cells are able to activate SAPK/JNK1 after UV irradiation, supporting therefore the notion that the UV sensing molecules and all of the components of the UV-induced signal transduction to SAPK/JNK1 must be extranuclear (20Devary Y. Rosette C. Di Donato J.A. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Still, the action spectra of UV (measured by gene activation, cytotoxicity, and carcinogenesis) strongly support the notion that the primary sensors for UV are molecules with UV absorption maxima identical to that of nucleic acids (2Bender K. Blattner C. Knebel A. Iordanov M. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. Biol. 1997; 37: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 21Stein B. Rahmsdorf H.J. Steffen A. Litfin M. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5169-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In view of this, RNA and ribonucleoprotein complexes are potential candidates for the role of UV sensors. We have recently reported a novel stress signaling pathway in mammalian cells (ribotoxic stress response) (22Iordanov M.S. Pribnow P. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.-Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that is initiated at, or in close proximity to, the functional center of the 28 S ribosomal RNA and that leads to activation of SAPK/JNK1 and of its activator SEK1/JNKK/MKK4 (23–25; hereafter referred to as SEK1/MKK4). Damage to the α-sarcin/ricin loop (S/R loop) of the 28 S rRNA, which is induced by exposure of cells to the ribotoxic enzyme ricin A chain, or α-sarcin (hereafter referred to as ricin and sarcin, respectively), strongly activated SEK1/MKK4 and SAPK/JNK1 and transcriptionally induced the expression of c-fos and c-jun (22Iordanov M.S. Pribnow P. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.-Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding of peptidyltransferase inhibitors (e.g. anisomycin, blasticidin S, and gougerotin) to the adjacent peptidyl transferase center of the 28 S rRNA (26Brimacombe R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 365-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 27Rodrigues-Fonseca C. Amils R. Garrett R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 224-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) also potentiated the SAPK/JNK1 cascade (22Iordanov M.S. Pribnow P. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.-Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, the ribotoxic stress response is characterized by the following features that allow its distinction from the cellular responses to genotoxic, hyperosmotic, and proinflammatory agents: (i) ribotoxic stressors interfere with translational elongation; (ii) ribotoxic stressors interfere with the function of the 3′-end (domains V and VI) of the 28 S rRNA by means of either covalent modifications (damage) to RNA or binding to the peptidyl transferase center of the 28 S rRNA; (iii) activation of stress kinases in response to ribotoxic stress requires the presence of active ribosomes at the moment of cellular exposure to the stressor (22Iordanov M.S. Pribnow P. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.-Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, we demonstrate that the response of mammalian cells to both UVC and UVB irradiation displays all three characteristics of a ribotoxic stress response and that this UV response is mechanistically different from the genotoxic, hyperosmotic, and proinflammatory stress responses. Anisomycin, puromycin, cycloheximide, emetine, T-2 toxin, diepoxybutane,d-sorbitol, EGF (recombinant human), and abrin A (lectin from Abrus precatotius) were from Sigma. Pactamycin was a generous gift from The Upjohn Co. TNF-α (recombinant mouse) and IL-1α (recombinant mouse) were from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Puromycin and cycloheximide were dissolved freshly before use in double-distilled H2O. Anisomycin, emetine, pactamycin, and T-2 toxin were dissolved in (H3C)2SO. In all of the cases when (H3C)2SO was used as a vehicle, corresponding control cells received the same amount of the vehicle alone (typically not more than 0.2% (v/v)). d-Sorbitol was dissolved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as a 3 mstock solution. All radiochemicals were from NEN Life Science Products. Rat-1 cells were maintained as described previously (28Magun B.E. Rodland K.D. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 891-897PubMed Google Scholar). The derivative cell line FC2-Rat1 has been described by Rodland et al. (29Rodland K. Wersto S. Hobson S. Kohn E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All experiments presented here were performed using confluent, quiescent cultures obtained through serum deprivation for typically 24 h. HeLa tk−cells and MEF cells were maintained as described for Rat-1 cells, except that the medium for MEFs was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) instead of calf serum (HyClone). UVC irradiation was performed using the 254-nm source of a 3uv™ Transilluminator (UVP, Inc., Upland, CA). Irradiation was performed from above (17-cm distance), through serum-free culture medium. UVB irradiation was performed using a UV-transilluminator (model 3–3100, midrange bulb, half-maximal peak, 295–330 nm) from Fotodyne, Inc. (Hartland, WI) by placing the tissue culture dish on the transilluminator and irradiating through the plastic bottom of the culture dish (Sarstedt, Sparks, NV). The amount of UVC (λ < 280 nm) received by the cells using this mode of irradiation was less than 0.01%; the spectral transmission of the plastic tissue culture dish was determined spectrophotometrically (using a DU® -64 Spectrophotometer; Beckman Instruments) by measuring the absorbance in the range 210–400 nm. Measurements of radiant incidence were performed using a UVX digital radiometer and UVX-25 and UVX-31 Sensors (UVP) in accordance with the manufacturer's operating instruction manual, and irradiation times were subsequently calculated. All immunoprecipitations and immunocomplex kinase reactions were performed as described for SAPK/JNK1 by Iordanov et al. (22Iordanov M.S. Pribnow P. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.-Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation of SAPK/JNK1, the antibody sc-474 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was used; for immunoprecipitation of ERK1, the antibody sc-93 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used. The p38/HOG-1-specific serum was a generous gift from G. Johnson. The analysis of threonine 223 phosphorylation of SEK1/MKK4 using the antibody 9151S (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA), was performed as described by Iordanov et al. (22Iordanov M.S. Pribnow P. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.-Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rat-1 cells were harvested from two 10-cm tissue culture dishes per experimental point, and total cellular RNA was extracted, separated by electrophoresis, and analyzed in a Northern blot procedure as described previously (28Magun B.E. Rodland K.D. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 891-897PubMed Google Scholar). The hybridization probes for c-fos and cyclophilin were described by Pribnow et al. (30Pribnow D. Muldoon L. Fajardo M. Theodor L. Chen S. Magun B.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1004-1012Google Scholar). Incorporation of [3H]leucine was performed as described by Iordanovet al. (22Iordanov M.S. Pribnow P. Magun J.L.

Determination of protein synthesis using FC2-Rat1 cells and a CAT assay has been described by Rodland et al. (29Rodland K. Wersto S. Hobson S. Kohn E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A detailed description of the method is provided in Ref. 22Iordanov M.S. Pribnow P. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.-Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. The following primers (Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc., The Woodlands, TX) were used for mapping the UV-induced lesions in the 3′-end of the 28 S rRNA: 5′-CGGCGCTGCCGTATCG-3′, 5′-CCCACAGATGGTAGCT-3′, 5′-CACATACACCAAATGTC-3′, 5′-ATGGCAACAACACATC-3′, 5′-ACGTTCCCTATTAGTG-3′, 5′-CAATCCAACGCTTGGTG-3′, 5′-CGACATCGAAGGATCA-3′, 5′-TCGCTATGAACGCTTG-3′, 5′-CAGAAGGATCGTGAGG-3′, 5′-CTTAGGACACCTGCGT-3′, 5′-GAGTAGTGGTATTTCAC-3′, 5′-TTGACATTCTGAGCAC-3′, 5′-GCGACGCTTTCCAAG-3′, and 5′-TAGGTTGAGATCGTTTC-3′. The quantification of all experiments based on detection of 32P (immunocomplex kinase assays and primer extensions) was performed using the PhosphorImager™ apparatus and the IPLab Gel™ software from Molecular Dynamics, Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA). Statistical analyses were performed using the StatView™ software from Abacus Concepts, Inc. (Berkeley, CA). Although some chemical stressors such as anisomycin, ricin, and palytoxin have been shown to activate SAPK/JNK1 through ribosome-mediated signal transduction pathways (22Iordanov M.S. Pribnow P. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.-Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Iordanov M.S. Magun B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3528-3534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), less is known concerning the mechanisms of stress kinase activation by physical agents such as ultraviolet radiation. We examined the possibility that UV irradiation of Rat-1 cells could activate SAPK/JNK1 through ribosome-dependent pathways. Rat-1 cells were irradiated with increasing doses of UVC, and SAPK/JNK1 activity was assayed 15 min later. SAPK/JNK1 activity increased linearly with the UVC dose up to 100 J/m2, after which the activity of the kinase did not change significantly (Fig. 1 A, left). The leveling of the rate of increase at doses of UVC higher than 100 J/m2 reflected indeed saturation of the ability of SAPK/JNK1 to be activated, since neither the amount of anti-SAPK/JNK1 antibody nor the substrate for the immunocomplex kinase assay was limiting (data not shown). Agents that act through ribotoxic signaling pathways have been shown to inhibit protein translation in the same dose range as their activation of stress kinases (22Iordanov M.S. Pribnow P. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.-Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the linear range response to UVC, there was a strong correlation (R2 = 0.864, p < 0.0001, Fig. 1 C, left) between activation of SAPK/JNK1 and translational inhibition (Fig. 1 B, left), which was measured by incorporation of [3H]leucine into protein. To confirm that the decrease in [3H]leucine incorporation reflected a real inhibition of translation rather than a reduced uptake of [3H]leucine by the irradiated cells, we applied an assay for protein synthesis that is independent of isotope uptake. A derivative of the parental Rat-1 cells, the cell clone FC2-Rat1, bears a stably integrated chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene under the control of the 1-kilobase promoter sequence of the human c-fos gene (29Rodland K. Wersto S. Hobson S. Kohn E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The expression of the CAT mRNA is kept at very low levels in quiescent cells but can be induced up to 100-fold upon stimulation with EGF in the presence of cycloheximide (data not shown). The presence of cycloheximide prevents the translation of the CAT mRNA into CAT protein. Release from the cycloheximide-induced translational arrest (Fig. 2, t = 0 min) allows efficient translation of the accumulated CAT mRNA. The accumulation of CAT protein increased linearly within 2 h following the wash-out of cycloheximide as measured by a CAT activity assay (Fig. 2). Since EGF was also removed from the medium together with cycloheximide, the increase of CAT activity resulted solely from translation of the CAT mRNA accumulated before the wash-out. Irradiation of the cells with UVC (150 J/m2) 60 min after the release from translational arrest resulted in a substantial decrease in CAT activity detectable both 30 and 60 min after the irradiation (Fig. 2). We therefore concluded that UVC irradiation of cells indeed interferes with the process of translation.Figure 2UVC-induced inhibition of CAT mRNA translation in FC2-Rat1 cells. Serum-deprived cells were stimulated for 2 h with EGF (40 ng/ml) in the presence of cycloheximide (25 μg/ml). Thereafter both EGF and cycloheximide were removed from the medium by extensive washout (indicated asrelease, t = 0 min). The accumulation of CAT protein was monitored by measuring CAT activity at 0, 60, 90, and 120 min after the release. UVC (150 J/m2) was applied 60 min after the release (arrow). Squares represent CAT activity in the nonirradiated cells; circles represent CAT activity in the UV-irradiated cells. S.D. was obtained from experimental points in triplicates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The activation of SAPK/JNK1 by ribotoxic stressors is abolished by immediate pretreatment of cells with ribosomal inhibitors that are unable to activate SAPK/JNK1 (22Iordanov M.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3528-3534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). By contrast, activation of SAPK/JNK1 through cell surface receptors or by hyperosmotic stress does not require the presence of active ribosomes and is not blocked by ribosomal inhibitors (22Iordanov M.S. Pribnow P. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.-Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Iordanov M.S. Magun B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3528-3534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that UVC-induced activation of SAPK/JNK1 is mediated through active ribosomes, we pretreated cells with pactamycin and emetine (antibiotics that fail to activate SAPK/JNK1 in Rat-1 cells) and assayed whether such pretreatment would inhibit the ability of UVC to activate SAPK/JNK1. For comparison, we studied the effects of the same drugs on the activation of SAPK/JNK1 by the ribotoxin abrin, an RNAN-glycosidase that specifically depurinates residue A4324 of the 28 S rRNA (32Endo Y. Mitsui K. Motizuki M. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5908-5912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); by sorbitol, an inducer of the hyperosmotic stress response (33Galcheva-Gargova Z. Derijard B. Wu I.-H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar); or by a genotoxic agent, the DNA cross-linker diepoxybutane (DEB). Pretreatment of cells with either pactamycin or emetine abolished the activation of SAPK/JNK1 by abrin but had no significant effect on the activation of SAPK/JNK1 by sorbitol or by DEB (Fig. 3, Aand B). Under the same conditions, both pactamycin and emetine pretreatments strongly suppressed the activation of SAPK/JNK1 by a saturating dose (150 J/m2) of UVC radiation (Fig. 3,A and B). We employed emetine to rapidly inhibit translation (within 1 min after administration; Ref. 22Iordanov M.S. Pribnow P. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.-Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in order to determine the time interval in which the activation of SAPK/JNK1 by UV is dependent on the functional integrity of ribosomes. When given 1 min before, together with, or 1 min after the beginning of UVC irradiation (which itself lasted 30 s), emetine inhibited the activation of SAPK/JNK1 by ≥80% (Fig. 4). Thereafter, emetine became less effective in inhibiting the UV-induced activation of SAPK/JNK1. Similar time dependence of the sensitivity to emetine was obtained when SAPK/JNK1 was activated by the peptidyltransferase inhibitor anisomycin (Fig. 4). However, whether given before or after stimulation of cells with IL-1α, emetine was unable to affect the activation of SAPK/JNK1 by this cytokine (Fig. 4; see “Discussion”). As with pactamycin and emetine, in Rat-1 cells pretreated with either cycloheximide or puromycin the ability of UVC to activate SAPK/JNK1 was inhibited by 94 and 88%, respectively (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4–6). By contrast, pretreatment with cycloheximide or with puromycin failed to inhibit the activation of SAPK/JNK1 by IL-1α or hyperosmotic shock (data not shown). I"

https://openalex.org/W1980815930,"The RET proto-oncogene encodes a functional receptor tyrosine kinase (Ret) for the Glial cell line Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF). RET is involved in several neoplastic and non-neoplastic human diseases. Oncogenic activation of RET is detected in human papillary thyroid tumours and in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 syndromes. Inactivating mutations of RET have been associated to the congenital megacolon, i.e. Hirschprung's disease. In order to identify pathways that are relevant for Ret signalling to the nucleus, we have investigated its ability to induce the c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinases (JNK). Here we show that triggering the endogenous Ret, expressed in PC12 cells, induces JNK activity; moreover, Ret is able to activate JNK either when transiently transfected in COS-1 cells or when stably expressed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts or in PC Cl 3 epithelial thyroid cells. JNK activation is dependent on the Ret kinase function, as a kinase-deficient RET mutant, associated with Hirschsprung's disease, fails to activate JNK. The pathway leading to the activation of JNK by RET is clearly divergent from that leading to the activation of ERK: substitution of the tyrosine 1062 of Ret, the Shc binding site, for phenylalanine abrogates ERK but not JNK activation. Experiments conducted with dominant negative mutants or with negative regulators demonstrate that JNK activation by Ret is mediated by Rho/Rac related small GTPases and, particularly, by Cdc42."

Neurocan and brevican are restricted to the central nervous system, whereas aggrecan is expressed predominantly in cartilage. The longest versican splice variants (V0 and V1) display an even wider distribution and are present in a number of mesenchymal (27Bode-Lesniewska B. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Odermatt B.F. Briner J.

In vitro experiments suggest that hyalectans play a modulatory role in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and hence may participate in the nervous system in the control of axon growth and guidance. Inhibitory activity on neuronal cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth has been described for neurocan (29Friedlander D.R. Milev P. Karthikeyan L. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Grumet M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 669-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and for brevican (24Yamada H. Fredette B. Shitara K. Hagihara K. Miura R. Ranscht B. Stallcup W.B. Yamaguchi Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7784-7795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, aggrecan from nasal cartilage is a potent inhibitor of neurite outgrowth (30Snow D.M. Watanabe M. Letourneau P.C. Silver J. Development. 1991; 113: 1473-1485PubMed Google Scholar). Because brain and cartilage aggrecan differ largely in the extent of post-translational modifications (31Li H. Domowicz M. Hennig A. Schwartz N.B. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), this finding still needs to be confirmed with the more relevant brain-derived aggrecan. Evidence that hyalectans may also be involvedin vivo in the control of axonal growth and guidance is provided by our recent observation of the transient versican V0/V1 expression in tissues that act as barriers during the development of the peripheral nervous system (32Landolt R.M. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Zimmermann D.R. Development. 1995; 121: 2303-2312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although versicans V0 and V1 are also present in the central nervous system (27Bode-Lesniewska B. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Odermatt B.F. Briner J. Heitz P.U. Zimmermann D.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), there are indications that a third splice variant, versican V2, is the major isoform in adult brain. The assumption is based on results from reverse transcriptase-PCR (16Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Zimmermann D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32992-32998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Northern blot experiments (18Ito K. Shinomura T. Zako M. Ujita M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 958-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) as well as on comparative immunohistochemical studies (26Paulus W. Baur I. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Zimmermann D.R. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast to the other versican splice variants, versican V2 transcripts are only detectable in the central nervous system (16Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Zimmermann D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32992-32998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the protein level, a versican-like proteoglycan (25Perides G. Rahemtulla F. Lane W.S. Asher R.A. Bignami A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23883-23887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and several small molecular size hyaluronan-binding proteins (33Delpech B. Halavent C. J. Neurochem. 1981; 36: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 34Perides G. Lane W.S. Andrews D. Dahl D. Bignami A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5981-5987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been identified in brain extracts. Partial peptide sequences suggest that these components are derived from versican V1 by a proteolytic process (35Perides G. Asher R.A. Lark M.W. Lane W.S. Robinson R.A. Bignami A. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). No biochemical data are currently available to confirm the presence of the versican V2 proteoglycan in the central nervous system. To close this gap, we have now determined the complete cDNA sequence of bovine versican, we have prepared several domain-specific antibodies via immunization with recombinant core protein fragments or synthetic peptides, and we have purified and characterized the different versican isoforms from bovine brain tissues. Bovine tissues were obtained from the local abattoir. The tissues were immediately placed on ice and processed within 1 h postmortem. Total RNA was isolated from bovine forebrain using a RNeasy total RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) and random hexamer primers (total volume 20 μl). Either 1 μl of this reverse transcription reaction or 100 ng of bovine genomic DNA was used as the template in different PCRs. Primer sequences and cycling conditions are listed in Table I. Initial cDNA fragments were obtained by PCR with guessmer primers that were based on comparisons of chick (36Shinomura T. Nishida Y. Ito K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14461-14469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mouse (18Ito K. Shinomura T. Zako M. Ujita M. Kimata K. J. Biol.

The PCR products were either sequenced directly or cloned into a pGEM-T vector using an A/T cloning kit (Promega, Madison, WI).

Northern blots using 1.5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from bovine forebrain were prepared as described previously (28Zimmermann D.R. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Schubert M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes covering bases 1–916 (numbers refer to bovine versican V0cDNA), 2842–4092, and 9552–10291, respectively, were used for hybridization. All polyclonal antibodies were prepared by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits with either histidine-tagged recombinant core protein fragments (GAG-αI: amino acids 366–769, GAG-αII: 991–1335, and GAG-β: 1340–1613, all relative to versican V0) or with NH2- and COOH-terminal peptides (LQKVNMEKSPPVKGS and KHDHRWSRRWQESRR, respectively) linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce). Both peptides were supplemented with a COOH-terminal cysteine residue to allow efficient coupling viam-maleimido benzoyl-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester (Pierce). Fusion proteins were prepared as described elsewhere (28Zimmermann D.R. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Schubert M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). All antisera were purified by affinity chromatography. Antisera against GAG-αI, GAG-αII, and GAG-β were preabsorbed on bacterial control extract columns followed by purification on corresponding fusion protein columns (NHS-activated HiTrap matrix, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antibodies against the NH2- and COOH-terminal ends of versican were affinity purified by binding to the corresponding peptides immobilized on UltraLink iodoacetyl columns (Pierce). 300 g of bovine forebrain was homogenized in a Waring blender using 4 volumes of extraction buffer containing 0.5m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride (Pefabloc SC; Pentapharm, Basel, Switzerland), 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin (buffer modified from Ref. 37Yamagata M. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Anat. Embryol. 1993; 187: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The homogenate was stirred for 5 h at 4 °C and subsequently centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. Proteins were differentially precipitated from the supernatant by the addition of solid ammonium sulfate. After an initial step at 30% saturation, versican-containing fractions were precipitated by increasing the ammonium sulfate concentration in the supernatant to 60%. All precipitates were allowed to form overnight at 4 °C and were collected by centrifugation at 27,000 ×g for 45 min. The 60% precipitate was resuspended in buffer A (6 m urea, 50 mm Tris, 10 mmEDTA, pH 6) and batch absorbed to Q-Sepharose FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C overnight. After column packing, the resin was washed with buffer A containing 0.3 m NaCl, and elution was achieved by applying a NaCl gradient from 0.3 to 2 m. Versican-containing fractions, identified on a slot blot with anti-GAG-αII polyclonal antibodies, were pooled and dialyzed extensively against 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mmTris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8 (buffer B). Subsequently, hyaluronan-EAH-Sepharose, prepared by coupling hyaluronan (Sigma) to EAH-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) through cross-linking withN-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) (38Tengblad A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 578: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), was added to the dialyzed fractions. The batch absorption was performed at 4 °C for 20 h. After packing the resin into a column, a washing gradient from 0.5 to 2 m NaCl in buffer B was applied, and elution was achieved with 4 m guanidine-HCl, 20 mmTris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8. Versican-containing fractions (identified as described above) were pooled, concentrated in a Biomax-100 spin concentrator (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and dialyzed against 40 mm NaOAc, pH 8, 10 mm EDTA. 100-μl aliquots were digested with 1 milliunit of carrier-free chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan) in 40 mm NaOAc, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride, pH 8 at 37 °C for 7 h or overnight. Isolated fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 4–15% gels (Bio-Rad) and Coomassie Blue stained with a colloidal blue staining kit (Novex, San Diego, CA). For immunoblots, samples were separated under reducing and denaturing conditions on 4–15% Phast polyacrylamide gels (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and blotted onto Nytran NY13 membranes (Schleicher & Schüll, Dassel, Germany) by diffusion transfer at 70 °C for 20 min. Binding of the first antibody (dilution 1:500–1:1000) was done overnight followed by detection with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies and color reaction with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (all from Promega). The starting points for the cloning of the entire bovine versican cDNA sequence were short cDNA stretches amplified from total bovine brain RNA with reverse transcriptase-PCR and guessmer primers. These guessmer primers were derived from versican cDNA sequences that were highly conserved among the human, mouse, and chicken homologs and lay close to the alternative splice junctions (Fig. 1, primer pairs a*/b* and c*/d*). In this way we obtained bovine cDNA fragments encoding parts of the hyaluronan binding region and the COOH-terminal domains. Based on these sequences, we generated primers (e/f) for a long reverse transcriptase-PCR, which yielded a 3.2-kb amplification product extending over the entire GAG-α-encoding portion of versican V2 and a short PCR fragment, which originated from the versican V3 transcript. No amplification product derived from the V1 splice variant was obtained in this reaction (expected size 5.5 kb). We therefore amplified two small versican V1 cDNA fragments that crossed over the splice junctions into the GAG-β-encoding sequence. For each of these two reverse transcriptase-PCRs we used one perfect match and one guessmer primer (primer pairs: e/k* and l*/f, respectively). Because the GAG-β domain is encoded by a single exon in the human and the mouse genome, we then tried to amplify the remaining bovine GAG-β sequence in a long PCR using genomic DNA as template. The 5.1-kb fragment we obtained corresponded to the expected size. Finally, the portions including the translation initiation or translation termination sequences were each amplified with a perfect match and a guessmer primer (g* or j*), coined from species-conserved 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions, respectively. Using this strategy, we PCR cloned overlapping cDNA fragments that covered the entire coding region of bovine versican corresponding to a 3,361-amino acid core protein in bovine versican V0, 2,380 amino acids in V1, 1,623 amino acids in V2, and 642 amino acids in V3 (all exclusive of the 20-amino acid secretory signal sequence). The cDNA and deduced amino acid sequences of the four splice variants of bovine versican are not shown in this paper but are available from the GenBank data base. From our PCR results we could conclude that mRNAs of all versican splice variants (V0–V3) are present in bovine brain tissue. However, no quantitative assertion could be made based on these experiments. We therefore prepared Northern blots with probes that covered portions encoding the NH2-terminal region, the GAG-α domain, or the COOH-terminal portion of versican (Fig. 2). All three probes detected a single band about 6.5 kb long corresponding to the expected size of the V2 splice variant. Because no signals were detected in the range predicted for the mRNAs of the V0, V1, and V3 isoforms, we concluded that these transcripts remained below the detection limit of the Northern blot. Based on the cDNA sequence, we prepared polyclonal antibodies against different parts of the versican core protein (Fig. 3). Some of the antigens chosen for immunization are present in all four versican isoforms (NH2- and COOH-terminal peptides), and others are only included in the splice variants V0 and V2(fragments GAG-αI and GAG-αII) or in V0 and V1 (fragment GAG-β), respectively. In immunoblotting experiments with bovine brain extracts, the polyclonal antibodies specific for the GAG-α domain detected a predominant core protein band of approximately 400 kDa after chondroitinase ABC digestion (Fig. 4). This band was also weakly visible before the enzyme treatment, probably reflecting unprocessed versican core protein from the intracellular pool. An almost identical picture was obtained with antibodies directed against the NH2-terminal versican peptide, whereas antibodies specific for the GAG-β domain did not recognize the 400-kDa component. In contrast, GAG-β-specific antibodies detected two larger core proteins, which migrated well above the 400-kDa marker protein. Because these two bands were barely visible on blots developed with the polyclonal antibodies against the NH2-terminal peptide we concluded that these two core proteins must be present in minute amounts and are only detectable as a result of the high immunoreactivity of the anti-GAG-β antibodies. Finally, a minor band migrating at around 80 kDa was recognized by the NH2-terminal peptide antibodies. The mobility of this band was unaffected by chondroitinase ABC treatment.Figure 4Immunoblot analysis of bovine brain extract. A protein extract from bovine brain was separated on a 4–15% SDS-Phastgel under reducing conditions before (−) and after (+) chondroitinase (Ch'ase) ABC digestion. Blots were incubated with polyclonal antibodies against the NH2-terminal peptide (N) and against the fusion proteins GAG-α (αII) and GAG-β.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Versicans were solubilized efficiently from brain tissues with a detergent-containing high salt buffer, confirming previous experiments by Yamagata and co-workers (37Yamagata M. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Anat. Embryol. 1993; 187: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Subsequent extraction of the insoluble fraction with 4 m guanidine-HCl yielded less than 5% additional material recognized by GAG-α- and GAG-β-specific antibodies (data not shown). More than 90% of the soluble immunoreactive material could be precipitated with ammonium sulfate at saturation levels between 30 and 60% (data not shown). Further purification of the versican proteoglycan isoforms could be achieved by anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose (Fig. 5), in which the versican-containing fractions eluted in a broad peak between 0.7 and 1.2 msodium chloride. The subsequent affinity chromatography step on a hyaluronan column demonstrated the high stability of the versican-hyaluronan interaction, which could be disrupted only under relatively harsh conditions (4 m guanidine-HCl). To monitor the purification process, aliquots of versican-containing fractions were analyzed with SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6). The 400-kDa core protein component observed by immunoblotting the crude brain extract became clearly visible in the Coomassie Blue-stained gels after anion exchange chromatography and was highly enriched after affinity purification on the hyaluronan column. Without chondroitinase ABC treatment, this component barely entered the gel, indicative of its proteoglycan character. At least three other GAG-carrying components were present after the Q-Sepharose chromatography step. Their core proteins either migrated on SDS-PAGE as a double band around 150 kDa or as single band slightly above the 84-kDa protein marker. None of these smaller size bands displayed immunoreactivity with anti-versican antibodies (data not shown), and they mostly disappeared after hyaluronan affinity chromatography. The final proteoglycan preparation usually contained 50–100 μg of protein/100 g of brain tissue (wet weight). The proteoglycan fraction obtained by hyaluronan affinity chromatography was characterized further by immunoblot analysis using the entire panel of domain-specific polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 7). Compared with the immunoblotting analysis of the crude brain extracts (Fig. 4), no major changes in the relative amounts of the large molecular mass core proteins were observed. Only the quantitatively minor 80-kDa component of the crude brain extract had been lost during our purification procedure. Again, the two large core proteins migrating around 500 kDa were recognized by the GAG-β-specific polyclonal antibodies and displayed very weak immunoreactivity with antibodies against the NH2- and the COOH-terminal ends of versican. Because the upper band was also apparent on both GAG-α-specific immunoblots, we could conclude that these two components corresponded to the intact V0 and V1 core proteins of bovine versican, respectively. Both of these large versican splice variants had formerly evaded detection in the less sensitive Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 6). In contrast to these quantitatively minor splice variants, the predominant 400-kDa core protein band displayed no immunoreactivity with antibodies against the GAG-β domain. It was, however, recognized by both anti-GAG-α antibodies and by antibodies directed against the NH2- and COOH-terminal peptides. We therefore could conclude that the predominant band in our brain extract preparation corresponded to the complete versican V2 core protein. The intact versican V2 carries several chondroitin sulfate side chains preventing it from entering 4–15% Phastgels without chondroitinase ABC digestion. Although the size of intact versican V2cannot be assessed from the electrophoretic mobili"

The mannose-binding protein ofAcanthamoeba is thought to mediate adhesion of parasites to host cells. We characterized the amoeba lectin with respect to its carbohydrate binding properties and the role in amoeba-induced cytopathic effect (CPE). Sugar inhibition assays revealed that the amoeba lectin has the highest affinity for α-Man and Man(α1–3)Man units. In vitro cytopathic assays indicated that mannose-based saccharides which inhibit amoeba adhesion to corneal epithelial cells were also potent inhibitors of amoeba-induced CPE. Another major finding was thatN-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) which does not inhibit adhesion of amoeba to host cells is also an inhibitor of amoeba-induced CPE. The Acanthamoebae are thought to produce CPE by secreting cytotoxic proteinases. By zymography, one metalloproteinase and three serine proteinases were detected in the conditioned media obtained after incubating amoebae with the host cells. The addition of free α-Man and GlcNAc to the co-culture media inhibited the secretion of the metalloproteinase and serine proteinases, respectively. In summary, we have shown that the lectin-mediated adhesion of the Acanthamoeba to host cells is a prerequisite for the amoeba-induced cytolysis of target cells and have implicated a contact-dependent metalloproteinase in the cytopathogenic mechanisms ofAcanthamoeba.

However, the disease also occurs, if less frequently, in non-contact lens wearers.

The parasite's ability to cause cytolysis and necrosis of host tissues is clearly a key component of Acanthamoeba infection but our understanding of how this is achieved is still rudimentary. In the present study, we show that the Acanthamoeba lectin binds α-Man and α1–3-d-mannobiose with highest affinity and that the lectin-mediated adhesion of the amoeba to host cells is a prerequisite for the amoeba-induced cytolysis of target cells. An Acanthamoeba strain derived from an infected human cornea (MEEI 0184; Acanthamoeba castellanii based on morphological characteristics) was used throughout this study. The parasites were axenically cultured in a proteose peptone/yeast extract/glucose medium (14Bornes J.T. Bornes W.G. Meyers D. J. Parasitol. 1970; 56: 904-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To characterize the sugar binding properties of the amoeba lectin a solid-phase assay was used (8Yang Z. Cao Z. Panjwani N. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 439-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, wells of microtiter plates were coated with bovine serum albumin-α-d-mannopyranosylphenylisothiocyanate (Man-BSA (Sigma), 15–25 mol of α-d-mannopyranoside/mol of albumin, 0.03 μg/ml, 50 μl/well in 0.1 m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, 4 °C, overnight); nonspecific binding was blocked with 1% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline (1 h, room temperature), a 50-μl aliquot of 35S-labeledAcanthamoebae (5 × 106 cells/ml in phosphate-buffered saline; 1–2 cpm/parasite, >95% trophozoites) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove unbound Acanthamoebae, 0.1 ml of 2% SDS was added to each well, and the radioactivity in aliquots of solubilized material was determined in a scintillation counter. To characterize the specificity of the amoeba lectin, a range of saccharides were tested for their ability to inhibit the adhesion of amoebae to Man-BSA (see Table I). The 25 saccharides tested were purchased from Sigma, V-Labs Inc. (Covington, LA), and Pfanstiehl Laboratories Inc. (Waukegan, IL), and included α1–3-d-mannobiose, α1–6-d-mannobiose, α1–3,α1–6-d-mannotriose, and α1–3,α1–6,α1–3,α1–6-d-mannopentose (Table I). Serial dilutions of sugars were tested to calculate the concentration required for 50% inhibition of the binding.Table IComparison of inhibitory effect of various saccharides on Acanthamoeba binding to Man-BSA and Acanthamoeba-induced cytopathic effect (CPE)SaccharideInhibition of binding to Man-BSAInhibition of CPEaImmortalized rabbit corneal epithelial cell cultures were used as target cells.

These two sugars were toxic to epithelium upon prolonged (overnight) incubation and were therefore not analyzed for their effect in the CPE assays. To determine whether any other lectin, besides the mannose-binding protein is present on the amoeba surface, the solid-phase assays were performed using microtiter wells coated with a number of neoglycoproteins includingN-acetyl-d-glucosamine-BSA(GlcNAc-BSA),N-acetyl-galactosamine-BSA, fucose-BSA, and galactose-BSA. These neoglycoproteins contained 15–30 mol of sugar/mol of albumin. To characterize the role of carbohydrate-mediated host-parasite interactions in the cytopathogenic mechanisms ofAcanthamoeba, in vitro cytopathic assays were performed using cell cultures of corneal epithelium as target cells. Since primary cultures of corneal epithelium have limited life span and can only be passaged 2 to 3 times without significant alteration in cell morphology, corneal epithelial cells with extended life span were produced. For this, the primary corneal epithelial cell cultures prepared as described earlier (15Jumblatt M.M. Neufeld A.H. Invest. Opthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1983; 24: 1139-1143Google Scholar, 16Panjwani N. Michaelopoulos G. Song J. Zaidi T.S. Yogeeswaran G. Baum J. Invest. Opthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1990; 31: 689-695Google Scholar) were infected with SV40 large T antigen cDNA (17Perrone R.D. Grubman S.A. Rogers L.C. Lee D.W. Moy E. Murray S.L. Torres V.E. Jefferson D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G335-G345PubMed Google Scholar). Retroviruses were used to transduce both the 3′-phosphotransferase gene conferring G418 antibiotic resistance and the SV40 large T antigen cDNA into the primary cultures. For infection, irradiated producer cells (ΨCRIP-SV40, 1 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) were added to confluent primary cultures of corneal epithelium. Two to three days after infection, the transformed cells were selected by adding G418 (500 μg/ml) into the culture medium. To promote the growth of the selected cells, initially they were co-cultured with irradiated fibroblast cells. After 10–12 days, when the cultures reached 30–40% confluence, G418 as well as fibroblasts were withdrawn. As of this stage, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1) containing fetal bovine serum (15%), dimethyl sulfoxide (0.5%), gentamicin (40 μg/ml), epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), insulin (5 μg/ml), and cholera toxin (0.1 μg/ml). When these cells reached over 50% confluence, they were passaged with a split ratio of 1:2. Upon phase-contrast microscopy, no fibroblastic cells could be detected subsequent to the first passage. The entire cell population was epithelioid. The cultures reacted positively with mAb AE5 which reacts with keratin K3, a marker for corneal epithelial cells. This further established the epithelial origin of the immortalized cells. To evaluate theAcanthamoeba-induced CPE on corneal epithelial cells, the parasites (>95% trophozoites) were rinsed three times in a serum-free medium supplemented with 0.4% BSA (18Panjwani N. Zhao Z. Ahmad S. Yang Z. Jungalwala F. Baum J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14015-14023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and aliquots of the parasite suspension (0.2 × 105 to 1 × 106parasites/ml; 300 μl/well for 24-well plates; 1 ml/well for 6-well plates) were added to wells of confluent cultures of epithelium which had been rinsed and preincubated in the serum-free medium for 2 h. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C in a CO2incubator and were periodically examined under a phase-contrast microscope for the presence of cell-free plaques in the monolayer for up to 28 h. Control wells contained the target cells in the medium without the parasites. To evaluate the effect of saccharides onAcanthamoeba-induced CPE, the assays were performed in the presence of sugars (0.03–100 mm). To estimate the relative inhibitory potency of each sugar, the CPE assays were terminated when, based on observations under a phase-contrast microscope, the culture wells incubated with the amoeba in the absence of saccharides exhibited approximately 50% destruction of the monolayer (10–14 h). At the end of the incubation period, the cultures were stained with Giemsa (Diff-Quik, Dade Diagnostic Inc., Aguada, PR). Approximate cell density in each well was estimated by scanning the stained plates in a calibrated, computer-assisted Bio-Image Scanner (Mllipore, Ann Arbor, MI). CPE was expressed as percentage of the optical density by the following formula. %CPE=O.D.of epithelial cells incubated with amoebaO.D.of control cells×100Equation 1 To determine whether the mechanisms modulating the CPE produced by intact amoeba and the amoeba-conditioned medium (ACM) are distinct, the CPE assays were also performed using the ACM in the presence and absence of saccharides. To produce the ACM, exponentially growing parasites (>95% trophozoites) in the protease peptone/yeast medium were rinsed and were then incubated in the serum-free medium supplemented with 0.4% BSA (2 × 105 to 1 × 106 cells/ml, 37 °C, 24 h) in the presence and absence of saccharides (α-Man and GlcNAc, 50 mm). At the end of the incubation period, the parasites were removed by centrifugation and the supernatants were analyzed for their ability to produce CPE. In some cases saccharides were added to the ACM after it was produced. Cell lysis was quantified by measuring 51Cr release from prelabeled cells. For radiolabeling, confluent monolayer cultures of corneal epithelium in 24-well plates were incubated in cell culture medium containing Na51CrO4 (460 mCi/mg, 12 μCi/ml, NEN Life Science Products) for 18–20 h. At the end of the labeling period, the cells were extensively rinsed and were then incubated with Acanthamoeba (1 × 106parasites/ml) in the presence or absence of saccharides (50 mm α-Man or GlcNAc). The cultures were periodically examined under a phase-contrast microscope for CPE. When approximately 50–70% cell loss occurred in the monolayers, aliquots of cell-free conditioned media from each well were analyzed for specific51Cr release. To determine specific 51Cr release values, counts/min released in control wells incubated in media alone without the parasites were deducted from the counts/min released in the test wells. Percent specific release was calculated using a formula: E/T × 100, where E is counts/min released in test wells minus the counts/min released in control wells, and T is the total counts/min (counts/min cells + counts/min supernatant in control wells). Counts/min of cells was determined by incubation of the control wells with 0.5% Triton X-100. Conditioned media from each well was also analyzed for lactate dehydrogenase release using an lactate dehydrogenase assay kit purchased from Sigma. In each case, there were four wells/group. The same procedure was used to determine whether ACM possesses cytolytic activity. To determine whether the mannose-mediated host-parasite interactions influence the levels of secretory proteinases, conditioned media obtained by incubating the amoebae with primary cultures of corneal epithelium in the presence and absence of saccharides (α-Man and GlcNAc, 50 mm, 6–8 h) were analyzed by zymography. The zymography was performed using separating gels containing 10% acrylamide and 2 mg/ml gelatin, essentially as described by Kleiner and Stetler-Stevenson (19Kleiner D.E. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Samples to be analyzed were diluted in the electrophoresis sample buffer (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) without mercaptoethanol and were then applied to the gels. After electrophoresis, the proteinases separated on gels were renatured by incubating the gels in 2.5% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to remove SDS. Following this, the gels were incubated for 18 h in a developing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mmCaCl2) and were then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Areas of digestion were visualized as nonstaining regions of the gel. In some experiments, samples were pretreated with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, 1 mm), an inhibitor of serine proteinases (21James G.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 86: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), for 1 h prior to electrophoresis, or 1,10-phenanthroline (1 mm), an inhibitor of metalloproteinases (22Powers J.C. Harper J.W. Powers J.C. Harper H.W. Proteinase Inhibitors. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1986: 219Google Scholar), was added to the developing buffer. To determine whether GlcNAc and/or α-Man influence the levels of secretory proteinases of Acanthamoeba by contact-independent mechanisms, ACM prepared in the presence and absence of the saccharides (50 mm) were also analyzed by zymography. In solid-phase assays, binding of amoebae to Man-BSA was dose-dependent (Fig. 1). Amoebae did not bind to a number of other neoglycoproteins including galactose-BSA, fucose-BSA,N-acetyl-d-galactosamine-BSA, and GlcNAc-BSA (Fig. 1). To characterize the carbohydrate binding properties of the amoeba lectin, sugar inhibition studies were performed. Concentrations of sugars required for 50% inhibition were calculated from inhibition curves and are listed in Table I. Among various monosaccharides tested, α-Man was the most potent inhibitor of amoeba binding to Man-BSA. Compared with α-Man the inhibitory potency of methyl-β-mannopyranoside and d-mannose was 8- and 10-fold less, respectively. Epimers of d-mannose,i.e. altrose (C-3) and talose (C-4), were not inhibitory but glucose (C-2) was a weak inhibitor. Compared withd-mannose, the inhibitory potency of d-glucose was 3.5-fold lower. d-Lyxose, which is equivalent tod-mannose with the C-5 substituent missing, was not inhibitory. The reduction of d-mannose tod-mannitol by sodium borohydride completely destroyed its ability to inhibit the amoeba binding to Man-BSA. Neitherd-mannosamine norN-acetyl-d-mannosamine were inhibitory.d-Glucosamine was also not inhibitory. However, GlcNAc and α-l-fucose were weak inhibitors. Their inhibitory potencies were 26- and 14-fold lower, respectively, compared with that of α-Man. Both mannobioses, the mannotriose, and the mannopentose were also potent inhibitors; the inhibitory potency of α1–3-d-mannobiose was approximately three times greater than that of α1–6-d-mannobiose and α-Man alone. α1–3,α1–6-d-mannotriose and α1–3,α1–6,α1–3,α1–6-d-mannopentose were slightly better inhibitors than α1–3-d-mannobiose (Table I). Acanthamoeba trophozoites have been shown to produce a CPE on a variety of cultured mammalian cells (5van Klink F. Alizadeh H. Stewart G.L. Pidherney M.S. Silvany R.E. He Y. McCulley J.P.

To determine whether the carbohydrate-mediated adhesion of Acanthamoebato corneal epithelium is a prerequisite for the parasite-induced target cell damage, CPE assays were performed in the presence and absence of various saccharides. The pathogenic ocular isolate ofAcanthamoeba used in the present study produced extensive CPE on both immortalized (Fig. 2) as well as primary (Fig. 3) rabbit corneal epithelial cells in culture. Within 8–10 h incubation with the parasites, small cell-free plaques were seen in the monolayers (Fig. 2, 8 h). With the continued incubation with the amoebae, the size of the cell-free areas increased (Fig. 2, 16 h), and eventually the monolayer surrounding the large plaques lifted entirely from the culture dish resulting in almost complete loss of the cell layer (Fig. 2, 24 h). The extent of the monolayer destruction depended on the concentration of amoebae, the nature of cell cultures (primaryversus immortalized), the length of the incubation period, and the composition of the media used for the assay. When immortalized cultures were used, an amoeba concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml was required to completely destroy the monolayer within 20 h. All CPE assays were performed in a serum-free medium supplemented with 0.4% BSA. If BSA was omitted from the media, the destruction of the monolayer occurred approximately twice as fast (data not shown).Figure 3α-Man inhibitsAcanthamoeba-induced cytopathic effect. Confluent primary corneal epithelial cultures in 6-well plates were incubated with Acanthamoebae (1 × 106 parasites/ml) in the presence or absence of various saccharides (0.1 m) for 20 h. The plates were then stained with Giemsa and scanned to estimate approximate cell density. A value of 1.0 was assigned to the cell density of the plates incubated in media alone (Cont.). The values for cultures incubated with amoebae in the presence and absence of saccharides are expressed as change in the density with respect to control plates. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. (n = 4 in each group). Photographs of the plates are shown in the bottom panel. Note that methyl-α-mannopyranoside (α-Man) markedly inhibited the amoeba-induced CPE, whereas α-l-fucose (α-Fuc) and β-galactose (β-Gal) had little effect. α-Man also inhibited CPE at a lower (5 mm) concentration (not shown, results similar to those shown above for 100 mm concentration).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Upon phase-contrast microscopy, it was evident that when amoebae were incubated with monolayers, they adhered to the cells within minutes. All saccharides which inhibited amoeba binding to Man-BSA also inhibited the amoeba binding to corneal epithelial cells (not shown).In vitro CPE assays, for the most part, revealed a direct correlation between the ability of the sugar to inhibit theAcanthamoeba binding to Man-BSA and to inhibit the amoeba-induced CPE (Table I). α-Man, both mannobioses, the mannotriose, and the mannopentose which were potent inhibitors of amoeba binding to Man-BSA were also potent inhibitors of amoeba-induced CPE; saccharides such as mannitol, mannosamine,N-acetyl-d-mannosamine, methyl-α- and methyl-β-galactopyranoside which did not inhibit amoeba binding to Man-BSA also did not inhibit amoeba-induced CPE. One striking exception was GlcNAc which was a weak inhibitor of the amoeba adhesion to Man-BSA but a potent inhibitor of CPE (see below). Primary cultures were relatively less susceptible to amoeba-induced CPE in that 1 × 106 parasites/ml were required to completely destroy the monolayer within 24 h. This parasite concentration is five times higher than that required to produce the same degree of CPE when immortalized cultures were used as target cells. Only a limited number of saccharides were tested for their ability to inhibit the amoeba-induced CPE on primary cultures. At a sugar concentration of 5 mm or less, α-Man, both mannobioses, the mannotriose, the mannopentose, and GlcNAc inhibited CPE. Methyl-α-d-galactopyranoside, methyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, and α-l-fucose were not inhibitory up to 100 mmconcentration (Fig. 3). As described above, GlcNAc, a weak inhibitor of amoebae adhesion to Man-BSA, was a potent inhibitor of amoeba-induced CPE. The inhibitory potency of GlcNAc in the amoeba adhesion assay was 26 times less than that of α-Man (Fig. 4,top panel; Table I). In contrast, in the CPE assays, the inhibitory potency of both α-Man and GlcNAc was nearly identical (Fig. 4, bottom panel; Table I). Amoebae did not adhere to the cell monolayer when α-Man was present. In addition, α-Man almost completely inhibited amoeba-induced CPE. Cell-free plaques were not detected in the presence of α-Man (Figs. 3 and Fig. 5, top panel, group M). α-Man, however, did not inhibit the lifting of the intact monolayer from the cell substratum upon “prolonged” (24–28 h) incubation of the cultures with amoebae (Fig. 5, middle and bottom panels, groups M). In the absence of α-Man, nearly complete loss of cell layer occurred around 20 h; in the presence of α-Man (50 mm), after an approximate 24-h incubation with the amoebae, the cell layer began to lift from the periphery (Fig. 5, middle panel, group M) and continued to roll inwards until the entire layer was lifted from the dish (Fig. 5, bottom panel, group M). This occurred more than 4 h after the complete loss of the cell layer had occurred in the cultures incubated without the sugar. When GlcNAc (50 mm) was present in the media, amoebae adhered tightly to the monolayer. Despite this, the cell layer remained attached to the culture dish during the entire assay period of 28 h (Fig. 5, middle and bottom panels, groups G). GlcNAc markedly delayed, but did not completely inhibit plaque formation. Upon careful examination of the cultures incubated with amoebae in the presence of GlcNAc for 28 h, small plaques could be seen in the monolayer (Fig. 5, bottom panel, group G). Since CPE assays were performed in the serum-free media, incubations were not continued beyond 28 h.Figure 5GlcNAc but not α-Man inhibits detachment of the monolayer from the substratum.

Note that plaque formation did not occur in the presence of α-Man (panel 1). However, when incubations were continued beyond the total destruction of the monolayers incubated with amoebae in the absence of sugar (group A), within 4–6 h the cultures incubated with amoebae in the presence of α-Man began to lift from the periphery (panel 2, row M) and continued to roll inwards until the entire layer was lifted from the dish (panel 3, row M).

Immunol. 1994; 12: 63-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar,7Hunziker W. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. J. Mamm. Gland Biol. Neopl. 1998; 3: 289-304Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Initial characterization of the endocytic pathway in polarized MDCK cells indicated that fluid phase markers internalized from the apical or basolateral cell surface enter distinct apical and basolateral early endosomes before converging in late endosomes (8Bomsel M. Prydz K. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3243-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 9Parton R.G. Prydz K. Bomsel M. Simons K. Griffiths G. J.

More recently, evidence has been provided for a common endocytic compartment accessible to membrane markers internalized from the apical or basolateral surface. In intestinal Caco-2 cells, transferrin internalized from the basolateral surface reaches an apical endocytic compartment that also receives membrane proteins internalized from the apical side (12Hughson E.J. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 13Knight A. Hughson E. Hopkins C.R. Cutler D.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Similarly, transferrin internalized from the basolateral or the apical side of MDCK cells enters a common endosomal compartment in the apical cytoplasm (14Odorizzi G. Pearse A. Domingo D. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). After internalization, the pIgR is transferred from basolateral early endosomes to an apical tubular-vesicular compartment that is accessible to markers internalized from the apical surface (15Apodaca G. Katz L.A. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 16Barroso M. Sztul E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Although the pIgR and the TfR have access to this apical endosomal compartment, the pIgR is efficiently transcytosed, whereas the TfR is excluded from the transcytotic pathway and recycled. Furthermore, pIgR internalized from the apical surface into apical endosomes does not transcytose to the basolateral domain but recycles. Thus, the accessibility of the apical endosomal compartment to membrane proteins internalized from the apical and basolateral surface and its ability to sort receptors into the transcytotic or recycling pathway indicate that this compartment, also termed apical recycling endosome, plays a central role in polarized sorting in the endocytic pathway of epithelial cells. Recent evidence indicates that the organization of the intracellular vesicular transport in epithelial cells is not unique to polarized cells. Fibroblasts possess two biosynthetic routes that, based on the proteins they transport and the underlying regulatory mechanisms, correspond to the apical and basolateral pathway of epithelial cells (17Musch A. Xu H.X. Shields D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 18Yoshimori T. Keller P. Roth M.G. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Similarities in the organization of the endocytic system between polarized and nonpolarized cells are also emerging (4Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). Receptors internalized by nonpolarized cells are first delivered to peripheral early endosomes before being transferred to a more perinuclear compartment (19Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) that shares many of the characteristics of the apical recycling endosome described in polarized cells. It is thus conceivable that the endocytic pathway of epithelial cells has been adapted for polarized sorting by the expression of specific regulatory molecules such as epithelial specific GTPases of the Rab family of proteins. Rab17 is one of the few Rab proteins restricted to epithelial cells (20Lütcke A. Jansson S. Parton R.G. Chavrier P. Valencia A. Huber L. Lehtonen E. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In kidney proximal tubule cells, Rab17 localizes to the basolateral membrane and apical tubules. Although it is not known if the organelles labeling for Rab17 are associated with the endosomal system, Rab17 has been implicated in regulating transcytosis. In the present study we took advantage of MDCK cells expressing a well characterized transcytotic receptor, the pIgR, to analyze whether Rab17 regulates transcellular transport. Murine Rab17 was expressed in MDCK cells, where it localized to small vesicles and tubules enriched in the apical cytoplasm of the cell. dIgA internalized from the apical or the basolateral cell surface colocalized to a significant extent with Rab17 positive organelles. Furthermore, basolateral to apical transcytosis of dIgA was impaired in MDCK cells overexpressing Rab17, whereas expression of a Rab17 mutant defective in membrane association did not affect transcytosis. These results implicate Rab17 in the regulation of transcytosis through the apical recycling endosome in polarized cells. Recombinant DNA techniques were carried out according to standard procedures. Total RNA was extracted from BALB/c mouse kidney, primed with oligo-dT and reverse transcribed. Two primers covering the N-terminal (5′-GGG GTA CCC CAT CGA TAG CCA TGG CGC AGG CTG CTG GGC TGC-3′) and C-terminal (5′-TAG GTA CCG CGG ATC CTA TCG TGC ACA GCA CTG GC-3′) region of Rab17 (20Lütcke A. Jansson S. Parton R.G. Chavrier P. Valencia A. Huber L. Lehtonen E. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) were used to amplify reverse transcribed RNA by PCR. The PCR product was cloned into pCB6 using ClaI and BamHI sites introduced by the PCR primers. The sequence of all PCR products was verified. The following differences to the published sequence of Rab17 (20Lütcke A. Jansson S. Parton R.G. Chavrier P. Valencia A. Huber L. Lehtonen E. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) were found in two independent PCR products: nucleotide 55 of the coding sequence was a C (instead of G) and nucleotide 138 a T (instead of C), the first of these differences resulting in a change at the amino acid level (Val-19 to Leu). Polyclonal rabbit antisera were custom made using keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide derived from the hypervariable region of the murine Rab17 (amino acids QRAGDTGSSRPQEGEAVA) and affinity purified on peptide coupled to Affi-Gel 10. The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by the following criteria: a) a single protein of ∼25 kDa was recognized by Western blots in mouse liver, kidney, and intestine but not in other organs (not shown);b) the antibody did not react with MDCK cells by immunofluorescence or Western blot, but it did recognize a ∼25 kDa protein in cells transfected with the murine Rab17 cDNA (see “Results”); and c) the presence of 0.1 mg/ml peptide inhibited the reactivity of the antibody in immunofluorescence or Western blot experiments (not shown). The Rab17 C211A/C212A mutant was constructed by PCR using a 5′ sense primer (5′-GGG GTA CCC CAT CGA TAG CCA TGG CGC AGG CTG CTG GGC TGC-3′) and a 3′ mutagenic antisense primer (5′-GTA CCG CGG ATC CTA TCG TGC AGC GGC CTG GCG CTG CC-3′), and the PCR product was verified by sequencing. Cells were cultured and transfected essentially as described (21Hunziker W. Male P. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3515-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). First, MDCK cells expressing the pIgR from a cytomegalovirus-based vector conferring hygromycin resistance (pCEP4, Invitrogen) were generated and characterized. Cells from one pIgR-expressing clone were then transfected with wild-type or mutant Rab17 cDNAs in pCB6 and selected for G418 and hygromycin resistance. Clones were screened for Rab17 expression by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. To prepare membrane and cytosol fractions the cells were scraped from a confluent 10 cm dish into 400 μl of PBS and passed three times through a 22-gauge needle followed by one passage through a 30-gauge needle. This resulted in the disruption of 80–95% of the cells as determined by trypan blue staining, leaving the nuclei intact. Nuclei and nondisrupted cells were pelleted and the proteins in the postnuclear supernatant were determined using the Bio-Rad assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min. The supernatant and pellet were solubilized in sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide), and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Rab17 was detected using the affinity purified antibody (1:1000) followed by a peroxidase-conjugated anti-Rabbit antibody (1:1000, Sigma) and chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Endogenous Rab5 and Rab4 were detected with monoclonal antibodies kindly provided by M. Zerial, Heidelberg and P. van der Sluijs, Utrecht, respectively. Cells were fixed for 30 min in 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized for 5 min in 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.05% SDS. After blocking in 10% goat serum, cells were incubated with affinity purified anti-Rab17, followed by fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-Rabbit IgG (1:100). Where cells had been allowed to internalize dIgA-biotin, Texas red-conjugated streptavidin (1:100, Jackson Immunologicals) was present during the incubation with the second antibody. After washing, cells were mounted in Moviol (Calbiochem) and viewed in a Zeiss Axiophot inverted microscope. Pictures were taken on Kodak T-MAX 400 film, using identical conditions for exposure, development, and printing. Transcytosis experiments of prebound or preinternalized dIgA were essentially carried out as previously outlined (21Hunziker W. Male P. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3515-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cells grown on 24-mm TranswellTM filters were washed with PBS+ and incubated for 30 min in cysteine-methionine free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm Hepes. Cells were pulse-labeled by placing the filters on a 100-μl drop of35S-Easytag protein-labeling mix (3 mCi/ml, NEN Life Science Products) in cysteine-methionine free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 15 min. After washing once with prewarmed complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to chase labeled proteins to the cell surface. Cells were cooled on ice, washed 3 times with PBS+, and sulfo-NHS biotin (1.5 mg/ml in PBS+) was added to the apical (250 μl) or basolateral (100 μl) compartment for 30 min on ice. Cells were then washed 5 times with PBS+, 0.2 m glycine, filters were removed from the holders and cells lysed in 1 ml of PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitors. Nuclei were pelleted, and the receptors were immunoprecipitated from the supernatant with an antibody to secretory component (22De Hoop M. von Poser C. Lange C. Ikonen E. Hunziker W. Dotti C.G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) essentially as described (23Hunziker W. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3291-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). One-sixth of the immunoprecipitate was used to estimate total labeled protein, whereas surface biotinylated receptors were precipitated from the remainder using streptavidin-agarose as outlined (23Hunziker W. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3291-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 24Hunziker W. Harter C. Matter K. Mellman I. Cell. 1991; 66: 907-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). To monitor polarized secretion of gp80, 100 μl of the apical and basolateral media were collected after the 30-min chase, and proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (7.5% nonreducing gels), autoradiography, and densitometry. Western blot analysis using an anti-gp80 antibody (kindly provided by Claudia Koch-Brandt) confirmed that the secreted 80-kDa protein was gp80. Stably transfected MDCK cells expressing the pIgR and Rab17 were grown on TranswellTMfilters as polarized cell monolayers and allowed to internalize dIgA from the apical or basolateral cell surface for 45 min at 37 °C as described above. Electron microscopy of ultrathin frozen sections was performed essentially as described previously (25Raposo G. Nijman H.W. Stoorvogel W. Liejendekker R. Harding C.V. Melief C.J. Geuge H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed for 2 h at room temperature in 2% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Cells were then rinsed in PBS containing 0.15% glycine and embedded in 10% gelatin. Gelatin blocks were incubated for 16 h in 2.3m sucrose at 4 °C and frozen in liquid nitrogen. 50-nm thin cryosections were made with a cryo-ultramicrotome (Leica Ultracut S). Sections were sequentially incubated at room temperature with anti-Rab17 antibody and protein A conjugated to 15 nm of gold, followed by anti-IgA and protein A coupled to 10 nm of gold. Sections were examined with a Jeol 1010 transmission electron microscope. Less than 3% of the Rab17 or dIgA labeling was associated with the nucleus. To characterize a possible involvement of Rab17 in transcellular transport, we transfected MDCK cells stably expressing the pIgR (26Hunziker W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29003-29009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with cDNAs encoding either a wild-type Rab17 cDNA or a Rab17 mutant in which the isoprenylation site was inactivated (Rab17 C211A/C212A) and analyzed the localization of Rab17 and its effect on transcytosis. Similar approaches have been used to establish a role of other Rab proteins in different exocytic and endocytic pathways (for reviews, see Refs. 27Pfeffer S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 28Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 949-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 29Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). To test whether endogenous Rab17 expressed by MDCK cells interferes with the detection of the transfected murine protein, cell extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis using an affinity purified antibody generated to a peptide derived from the C-terminal hypervariable region of murine Rab17 (see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig. 1 A, no endogenous MDCK proteins were detected by the anti-peptide antibody (lane 1). The antibody did, however, recognize a band of ≈25 kDa in cells transfected with the murine Rab17 cDNA (lane 2 and see below). Reverse transcription-PCR on MDCK RNA using primers derived from the 5′- and 3′-coding region of the murine Rab17 cDNA sequence resulted in the amplification of a PCR product of ≈600 base pairs, indicating the presence of an endogenous Rab17 transcript. Thus, our anti-peptide antibody either did not cross-react with the canine Rab17 or the levels of endogenously expressed Rab17 in MDCK cells were too low to be detected by immunological methods. Because the antibody did not detect the endogenous protein, we were able to detect a transfected wild-type or a nonisoprenylated mutant murine Rab17 without the need for epitope tagging. To characterize MDCK cells transfected with wild-type or mutant Rab17, we first analyzed the expression levels of the GTPase in selected clones by subjecting equal amounts of total protein to Western blot analysis. Two clones expressing similar levels of the wild-type or mutant protein were chosen for further experiments (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3). As judged by immunofluorescence, all cells in a given population expressed the GTPase as well as the pIgR (see below and Fig. 2). Because the cysteine residues in the isoprenylation site of Rab17 C211A/C212A were substituted for alanines, the mutant was not expected to associate with membranes. To test the ability of Rab17 to associate with membranes, MDCK cells were homogenized, and membranes were pelleted from a postnuclear fraction. The membrane pellet (P) and the supernatant (S) were then analyzed by Western blot for the presence of Rab17. Rab17 was recovered in the pellet fraction, whereas Rab17 C211A/C212A remained in the supernatant (Fig. 1 B), indicating that Rab17 but not the mutant was probably isoprenylated. Similarly, endogenous Rab5 (Fig. 1 C) and Rab4 (Fig. 1 D) were efficiently recovered in the membrane pellet. In conclusion, MDCK cell lines were generated that coexpressed the pIgR and similar levels of either wild-type Rab17 or a mutant unable to associate with membranes. Next we characterized the intracellular localization of transfected Rab17 by immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells expressing the wild-type or mutant GTPase were allowed to endocytose biotinylated dIgA for 60 min, and following fixation and permeabilization, Rab17 and internalized dIgA-biotin were visualized. As shown in Fig. 2 and consistent with the Western blot results described above, no Rab17 was detected in MDCK cells expressing the pIgR alone (Fig. 2, E and F). In cells transfected with the wild-type Rab17, the protein localized to a vesicular compartment concentrated in the perinuclear region and extending into the cell periphery (Fig. 2 A). The Rab17-positive compartment overlapped to a significant extent with endocytosed dIgA (Fig. 2 B, compare with Fig. 2 A). Confocal laser microscopy (not shown) and immunoelectron microscopy (see below) confirmed the extensive colocalization of dIgA and Rab17, although in both cases organelles exclusively staining for Rab17 or dIgA were observed also. In contrast to cells expressing wild-type Rab17, cells transfected with Rab17 C211A/C212A showed a diffuse cytosolic and nuclear staining (Fig. 2 C), indicating that the mutant GTPase remained soluble in the cytosol and diffused into the nucleus. These results show that Rab17 is associated with vesicles and tubules and that at least a subpopulation of the Rab17 compartment is accessible to internalized dIgA. We next used cryo-immunogold-electronmicroscopy to determine in more detail the subcellular localization of Rab17 in polarized MDCK cell monolayers and to confirm the apparent colocalization of Rab17 and dIgA observed by light microscopy. MDCK cells grown on TranswellTM units (see Fig. 3 A, inset) were allowed to internalize biotinylated dIgA from the basolateral or apical surface for 45 min, fixed, and Rab17 and dIgA were visualized by immunogold labeling. As shown in Fig. 3 A, Rab17 (arrows) was detected on a population of small vesicles and tubules highly enriched in the apical pole of the cells. Of 900 gold particles representing Rab17 labeling, less than 3% were associated with the basolateral or apical plasma membrane. The observed localization of Rab17 to apical vesicles and tubules was consistent with the localization in proximal kidney tubules (20Lütcke A. Jansson S. Parton R.G. Chavrier P. Valencia A. Huber L. Lehtonen E. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), but little Rab17 staining was observed on the basolateral plasma membrane. A significant fraction of the Rab17 positive vesicles and tubules contained dIgA, which had been internalized from the apical (Fig. 3 B) or the basolateral (Fig. 3 C) domain. Depending on the labeling density for dIgA, 30–50% of the Rab17-positive membranes also labeled for dIgA. In addition, Rab17-positive organelles that lacked dIgA as well as endocytic vesicles that carried dIgA but were devoid of Rab17 were observed. In conclusion, murine Rab17 expressed in MDCK cells was associated with small cytoplasmic vesicles and tubules present in the apical region of polarized cells and Rab17-positive organelles were accessible to dIgA endocytosed from the apical or the basolateral cell surface. The observation that Rab17 and internalized dIgA colocalize (see Figs. 2, C and D and 3, B andC) suggested that the protein might be involved in regulating polymeric immunoglobulin receptor trafficking. Therefore, we next analyzed whether transport of dIgA bound to the pIgR was altered in MDCK cells expressing wild-type or mutant Rab17.125I-dIgA prebound to the basolateral surface of polarized cell monolayers was allowed to internalize and transcytose. After the indicated time, the fraction of dIgA released into the apical or basolateral compartment or present on the basolateral surface or inside the cells was determined. As shown in Fig. 4 A and similar to previous observations (21Hunziker W. Male P. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3515-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 26Hunziker W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29003-29009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Hunziker W. Whitney J.A. Mellman I. Cell. 1991; 67: 617-627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), 30–40% of the prebound dIgA was transcytosed in control MDCK cells. In cells expressing Rab17, however, the kinetics as well as the final extent of transcytosis were reduced. The inhibitory effect was not because of the transfectionper se since transcytosis was not altered in MDCK clones transfected with the pIgR and the human TfR (not shown) or the mutant Rab17 (see below and Fig. 6). Furthermore, inhibition of transcytosis did not result from a block in endocytosis since dIgA was cleared from the basolateral surface with similar kinetics in control and Rab17-expressing cells (Fig. 4 B). Consistent with this observation, the initial rate of intracellular dIgA accumulation in control and Rab17-expressing cells was similar (Fig. 4, Band C). At later times, however, less dIgA accumulated intracellularly in Rab17-expressing cells, probably reflecting a larger fraction of the ligand being recycled and released into the basolateral media (Fig. 4 D). Thus, the lack of an effect on endocytosis and the stimulation of recycling indicate that transfected Rab17 did not exert a general inhibitory effect on endocytic membrane transport.Figure 6Polarized cell surface delivery of gp80 and the pIgR. A, gp80 secretion. MDCK cells overexpressing Rab17 or control cells were metabolically labeled for 15 min and labeled proteins were then chased for 30 min to the cell surface. Equal volumes of apical and basolateral media were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Western blot analysis showed that the major 80-kDa protein secreted by MDCK cells was gp80 (not shown). A, apical; B, basolateral. B, basolateral transport of the pIgR. The apical or basolateral cell surface of the cell monolayer was biotinylated, cells were lysed, and the pIgR was immunoprecipitated. An aliquot of the immunoprecipitate was directly analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Total), from the remainder biotinylated surface receptors were isolated using immobilized streptavidin and analyzed by SDS-PAGE autoradiography (Surface).A, apical; B, basolateral.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In MDCK cells, newly synthesized pIgR is directly delivered from the TGN to the basolateral cell surface (see also Fig. 6 B) and the receptors present on the apical surface reflect molecules that have transcytosed (31Mostov K.E. Deitcher D.L. Cell. 1986; 46: 613-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). If Rab17 interferes with transcytosis of the pIgR, the number of receptor molecules on the apical plasma membrane at steady state may be reduced. Thus, we determined the polarized surface distribution of the pIgR in control cells and cells expressing wild-type or mutant Rab17 by measuring the relative binding of125I-dIgA to the apical or basolateral compartments on ice. As shown in Fig. 5, 65% of the total surface pIgR localized to the apical domain of control cells or cells expressing Rab17 C211A/C212A, whereas in Rab17-expressing cells the pIgR was predominantly on the basolateral surface. The effect of Rab17 on the surface distribution of the pIgR is thus consistent with the observed inhibition of transcytosis. To confirm that overexpression of Rab17 specifically affected the endocytic transport of the pIgR, we analyzed the apical secretion of newly synthesized gp80 (32Urban J. Parczyk K. Leutz A. Kayne M. Kondor-Koch C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2735-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and the basolateral delivery of newly synthesized pIgR (31Mostov K.E. Deitcher D.L. Cell. 1986; 46: 613-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) in control and Rab17-overexpressing cells. MDCK cells grown on permeable filters were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and labeled proteins were chased to the cell surface for 30 min. The apical or basolateral medium was collected, and secreted gp80 was trichloroacetic acid precipitated. On the same filters, the apical or basolateral plasma membrane of the cell monolayer was biotinylated, the pIgR was immunoprecipitated, and receptors that had reached the surface were isolated with streptavidin-agarose. Precipitated gp80 and pIgR were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 6 A, control and Rab17-overexpressing MDCK cells secreted gp80 predominantly into the apical compartment. Also newly synthesized pIgR was delivered in a vectorial fashion to the basolateral cell surface of control and Rab17-expressing cells (Fig. 6 B). These experiments show that Rab17 does not affect polarized cell surface transport in the biosynthetic route. Thus, e"

(1991) Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 7, 663–698). The caspase family of mammalian proteases, related to the nematode death protein CED-3, plays a crucial role in apoptosis and inflammation. We report here the isolation and characterization of a new caspase, tentatively termed ERICE (Evolutionarily RelatedInterleukin-1β ConvertingEnzyme). Based on phylogenetic analysis, ERICE (caspase-13) is a member of the ICE subfamily of caspases which includes caspase-1 (ICE), caspase-4 (ICErel-II, TX, ICH-2), and caspase-5 (ICErel-III, TY). Overexpression of ERICE induces apoptosis of 293 human embryonic kidney cells and MCF7 breast carcinoma cells. Like other members of the subfamily, ERICE is not activated by the serine protease granzyme B, a caspase-activating component of cytotoxic T cell granules. Therefore, ERICE most likely does not play a role in granzyme B-induced cell death. ERICE, however, was activated by caspase-8 (FLICE, MACH, Mch-5), the apical caspase activated upon engagement of death receptors belonging to the tumor necrosis factor family. This is consistent with a potential role for ERICE in this receptor-initiated death pathway. Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is a process of fundamental importance to cellular homeostasis in metazoan organisms (Ellis, R. E., Yuan, J., and Horvitz, H. R. (1991) Annu. Rev.

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an evolutionarily conserved process central to the normal development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms (1Ellis R.E. Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis of the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans has revealed three core components of the death pathway, ced-3, ced-4, andced-9 (2Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R.

PCT Publication WO 95/00160. 1995; Google Scholar). All members of the caspase family share a number of amino acid residues crucial for substrate binding and catalysis (29Walker N.P.C. Talanian R.V.

For caspase-1, these residues include Cys285 and His237, which hydrogen bond with the thiohemiacetal of the enzyme-substrate complex, and Gly238, which forms the oxyanion hole that stabilizes the oxyanion of the reaction intermediates. Arg179, Gln283, Arg341, and Ser347 form the binding pocket for the carboxylate side chain of the P1-aspartic acid. Although the mechanism of their protease action is conserved, differences in primary sequences account for differential substrate specificity. The caspase family has been divided into three groups based upon substrate specificity using a positional scanning substrate combinatorial library (31Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). The most divergent amino acid substitution occurs at substrate position P4. Caspases-2, -3, and -7, and CED-3 have a preference for the motif DExD↓, and caspases-6, -8, and -9 display a specificity for (I/V/L)ExD↓. Members of these two subfamilies play a prominent role in cell death. In contrast, caspases 1, 4, and 5, which belong to the ICE subfamily and possess a WEHD↓ substrate specificity, appear to play a primary role in cytokine maturation and inflammation. Hydrophobic amino acids are not found in the P4 position of substrates known to be cleaved during cell death (31Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). Caspase inhibitors have been constructed based upon the presumed substrate specificity of the different caspases. The first caspase-1 subfamily specific inhibitor was based upon the tetrapeptide recognition sequence YVAD present in prointerleukin-1β, a natural substrate for caspase-1. Similarly, a tetrapeptide inhibitor was designed around the putative PARP cleavage site, DEVD, to be selective for the proapoptotic caspases (32Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). Aldehyde derivatives of these inhibitors are reversible and form a thiohemiacetal with the active site cysteine. Chloromethyl, fluoromethyl, acyloxymethyl, diazomethyl, α-pyrazoloxymethyl, and phosphinyloxymethyl ketones function as irreversible inhibitors by covalently forming a thiomethyl ketone to the sulfur atom of the active site cysteine in the large subunit (30Wilson K.P. Black J.-A.F. Thomson J.A. Kim E.E. Griffith J.P. Navia M.A. Murcko M.A. Chambers S.P. Aldape R.A. Raybuck S.A. Livingston D.J. Nature. 1994; 370: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). In vitro data show Ac-YVAD-aldehyde to be a potent inhibitor of caspase-4 and caspase-1 but ineffective in inhibiting caspase-3 and caspase-7. In contrast, caspase-3 and caspase-7 are potently inhibited by Ac-DEVD-CHO (33Margolin N. Raybuck S.A. Wilson K.P. Chen W. Fox T. Gu Y. Livingston D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7223-7228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, a number of pathogenic viruses also encode caspase inhibitors as a means of attenuating immune surveillance mechanisms that work by inducing apoptosis of infected cells. For example, the pox virus cytokine response modifier protein CrmA inhibits caspase-1 and -8 most effectively (11Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar, 34Muzio M. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2952-2956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), whereas the baculovirus protein p35 inhibits numerous activated caspases (6Xue D.

Science. 1995; 269: 1885-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Caspases exist as single polypeptide zymogens composed of a prodomain of variable length plus a large subunit (which contains the catalytic cysteine) and a small subunit (for reviews, see Refs. 36Villa P.

All caspases require accurate processing at the internal aspartate residues to generate an active dimeric enzyme. Activated members of the caspase family function as the effector arm of the cell death pathway by cleaving a growing number of cellular substrates including lamins (41Lazebnik Y.A. Takahashi A.

However, granzyme B will not productively process members of the ICE subfamily in keeping with the less prominent role for this subfamily in apoptosis (57Darmon A.J. Ehrman N. Caputo A. Fujinaga J.

Caspase-8 is the initiating caspase in the apoptotic cascade that is activated by engagement of death receptors belonging to the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. Caspase-8 contains two NH2-terminal tandem repeats within the prodomain which are homologous to the death effector domain in the adaptor molecule FADD and allow for its recruitment to the receptor signaling complex. The remainder of the molecule is highly similar to the CED-3 subfamily of caspases (19Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel K.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R.

In a cell-free system, caspase-8 has been shown to process a variety of proapoptotic caspases; but like granzyme B, it did not activate members of the ICE subfamily (34Muzio M. Salvesen G.S.

We report here the cloning and characterization of a novel member of the ICE subfamily termed ERICE for EvolutionarilyRelated ICE (caspase-13). Based upon sequence identity, it is most related to caspase-4 and caspase-5. Overexpression of ERICE in MCF7 and 293 cells induces apoptosis that can be blocked by p35 or CrmA. As expected, mutation of the catalytic cysteine abolishes its proapoptotic activity. In keeping with it being a member of the ICE subfamily, ERICE is not activated by granzyme B. However, unlike other characterized members of the ICE subfamily, ERICE is activated by caspase-8, consistent with a potential role in apoptosis. A data base containing more than 1 million ESTs (expression sequence tags) was generated through the combined efforts of Human Genome Sciences and the Institute for Genomic Research using high throughput automated DNA sequence analysis of randomly selected human cDNA clones (58Adams M.D. Kerlavage A.R.

A full-length clone (HFJAB36) representative of the original EST was obtained by screening a human skin fibroblast cDNA library. Expression constructs encoding full-length ERICE were made with a COOH-terminal hemagglutinin tag. Alteration of the active site cysteine to alanine was accomplished by site-directed mutagenesis employing a four-primer two-step polymerase chain reaction protocol as described previously (61Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). Alteration of potential aspartate cleavage sites was performed following the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The fidelity of polymerase chain reaction for full-length and mutant expression constructs was confirmed by sequence analysis. Cell death assays were performed as described (62Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). Adult and fetal human multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) containing 2 μg/lane poly(A)+ RNA were hybridized according to the manufacturer's instructions, using a 32P-labeledBamHI/PvuII 400-base pair restriction fragment containing most of the ERICE prodomain. In vitrotranslated 35S-labeled ERICE and its mutants were treated using either granzyme B or recombinant caspase-8 as described previously (22Duan H. Orth K. Chinnaiyan A. Poirier G. Froelich C.J.

To determine whether ERICE was productively processed on exposure to caspase-8 or granzyme B, radiolabeled ERICE was incubated with biotinylated YVAD chloromethyl ketone as described previously (34Muzio M.

Streptavidin beads were washed three times with biotinylation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% CHAPS, 2 mm dithiothreitol), and bound protease was eluted by boiling in sample buffer, resolved on a 10–20% acrylamide gel, and visualized by autoradiography. The cleavage boundaries were mapped using ERICE mutants in which candidate aspartate residues were changed to alanine. For in vivo cleavage studies, mutant ERICE was cotransfected with FLICE or Fas with or without CrmA. Lysates were made with 500 μl of lysis buffer as described previously (19Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel K.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2741) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed with anti-hemagglutinin or anti-FLAG antibodies. The full-length 2.2-kilobase ERICE cDNA contained an open reading frame of 377 amino acids encoding a protein of predicted molecular mass 43.0 kDa (Fig. 1 A). A BLAST search of the GenBank protein sequence data base revealed ERICE to possess significant homology to other members of the caspase family, particularly the ICE subfamily, which includes caspase-1, caspase-4, caspase-5, and murine caspases-11 and -12 (Fig. 1 B). ERICE has 75% sequence identity to caspase-4, 61% sequence identity to caspase-5, and 47% identity to caspase-1. Based on the x-ray crystal structure of ICE (29Walker N.P.C. Talanian R.V. Brady K.D. Dang L.C. Bump N.J. Ferenz C.R. Franklin S. Ghayur T. Hackett M.C. Hammill L.D. Herzog L. Hugunin M. Houy W. Mankovich J.A. McGuiness L. Orlewicz E. Paskind M. Pratt C.A. Reis P. Summani A.

Cell. 1994; 78: 343-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), several amino acid residues critical for binding and catalysis have been identified. These residues include the catalytic dyad Cys285 and His237, and Gly238, which stabilizes the tetrahedral intermediate. Arg179, Gln283, Arg341, and Ser347 form the binding pocket for the S1subsite. These seven residues are conserved in all caspases thus far characterized including ERICE (Fig. 1 B). Although the sequence homology is very high between ERICE and caspases-4 and -5, residues that make up the P2–P4 binding pocket are not conserved, suggesting a different substrate specificity. The QAC(R/Q/G)G motif conserved in all caspases is conserved in ERICE (Fig. 1 B). ERICE is the 13th member of the caspase family (Fig. 1 C) and is tentatively designated caspase-13. Northern blot analysis revealed ERICE to be constitutively expressed mainly in peripheral blood lymphocytes, spleen, and placenta. The transcript size of 1.6 kilobases corresponded to the full-length cDNA obtained from the fibroblast cDNA library (Fig. 2 A). ERICE was highly expressed in HeLa cells but not in transformed hematopoietic cell lines including Burkitt's lymphoma, Raji cells, or in promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells (Fig. 2 B). To study the functional role of ERICE, we transiently transfected MCF7 breast carcinoma cells and 293 embryonic kidney cells with an expression vector encoding full-length ERICE and assayed for apoptosis. Like other caspases, ERICE was able to induce cell death (Fig. 3, A and B). However, unlike caspase-4 and caspase-5, removal of the prodomain was not necessary to induce apoptosis (12Munday N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ali A. Casano F.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15870-15876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). ERICE-transfected MCF7 and 293 cells displayed morphologic alterations typical of adherent cell lines undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 3 C). To determine whether protease activity was required for inducing apoptosis, the catalytic cysteine was altered to an alanine. Consistent with a requirement for enzymatic activity, the Cys to Ala mutant did not induce apoptosis in either the MCF7 or 293 cells. Furthermore, apoptosis induced by ERICE was efficiently blocked by virally encoded caspase inhibitors p35 and CrmA (Fig. 3, A and B). Although overexpressed ERICE induces apoptosis, this may not reflect its primary function because other ICE subfamily members do not appear to play a prominent proapoptotic role. In keeping with this, granzyme B, which is known to induce apoptosis through the productive processing of caspases, cleaves but does not activate caspase-1, the prototypical member of the ICE subfamily. Additionally, members of the ICE subfamily are not productively processed by caspase-8, the apical caspase involved in proximal death receptor signaling. To address whether ERICE was productively processed by granzyme B or caspase-8, it was incubated with either protease (Fig. 4, A and C), and the emergence of active ERICE was assessed by reaction with biotinylated YVAD chloromethyl ketone, which covalently binds the catalytic cysteine within the large subunit of proteolytically competent (active) caspases (Fig. 4 B). Caspase-8 processing of ERICE led to the generation of two subunits. One of the subunits was the prodomain plus the large catalytic subunit (pro+large), and the other was the small catalytic subunit. This is similar to the activation of caspase-1 in which the p45 zymogen must initially be processed to a stable active p35 pro+large subunit. Further processing, namely cleavage between the pro and large subunit, is highly dilutional sensitive and very inefficient in vitro such that in vitro translated zymogens do not undergo complete processing. Given the low concentration of in vitro translated ERICE, it was not surprising that caspase-8 processed it only to the pro+large and small subunits. Regardless, caspase-8-processed ERICE was efficiently labeled with biotinylated YVAD, indicative of generation of active ERICE (Fig. 4 B). Granzyme B appeared to be more promiscuous, cleaving ERICE into a number of discrete fragments (Fig. 4 C), none of which labeled with biotinylated YVAD (data not shown). In vivo, mutant ERICE was processed by both caspase-8 and Fas in a CrmA-inhibitable fashion (Fig. 5). Therefore, although ERICE is cleaved by both caspase-8 and granzyme B, it is only cleavage by caspase-8 which is productive and leads to the generation of active ERICE.Figure 5In vivo processing of ERICE is CrmA-inhibitable. Catalytically inactive ERICE was cotransfected with caspase-8 or Fas in the presence or absence of CrmA. The formation of subunits was monitored by Western blotting for the hemagglutinin epitope-tagged ERICE. The expression of caspase-8 and Fas is shown in the lower panels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To map caspase-8 processing sites within ERICE, potential aspartate cleavage sites were mutated and tested as caspase-8 substrates. Productive cleavage was found to require Asp289 as alteration of this residue abolished processing (Fig. 4 D). Therefore, ERICE must be cleaved by caspase-8 following Asp289 to yield an active heterodimeric enzyme. Notably, this aspartate is found in the sequence context LEED (residues 286–289) which is the preferred substrate for caspase-8 cleavage. In summary, this is the first example of an ICE subfamily member that is activated by caspase-8 and suggests a potential downstream role for active ERICE in caspase-8-mediated cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2001456643,"PECAM-1 is an adhesion molecule expressed on hemopoietic and endothelial cells. Recently, it was observed that PECAM-1 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to a variety of physiological stimuli. Furthermore, tyrosine-phosphorylated PECAM-1 was shown to associate with SHP-2, a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase expressed ubiquitously. In light of the significance of tyrosine protein phosphorylation as a regulatory mechanism, we wished to understand better the nature and impact of the protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) mediating PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Through reconstitution experiments in COS-1 cells, we determined that mouse PECAM-1 could be tyrosine-phosphorylated by Src-related PTKs and Csk-related PTKs, but not by other kinases such as Syk, Itk, and Pyk2. Using site-directed mutagenesis and peptide phosphorylation studies, we found that these PTKs were efficient at phosphorylating Tyr-686, but not Tyr-663, of PECAM-1. Src-related enzymes also phosphorylated mouse PECAM-1 at one or more yet to be identified sites. In other studies, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of PECAM-1 by Src or Csk family kinases was sufficient to trigger its association with SHP-2. Moreover, it was able to promote binding of PECAM-1 to SHP-1, a SHP-2-related protein-tyrosine phosphatase expressed in hemopoietic cells. Taken together, these findings indicated that the Src and Csk families of kinases are strong candidates for mediating tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 and triggering its association with SH2 domain-containing phosphatases under physiological circumstances.

It is abundantly expressed on endothelial cells as well as various hemopoietic cell types, including platelets, myeloid cells, monocytes, mast cells, and defined T-cell subsets. The structure of PECAM-1 is highly conserved across species. It contains an extracellular segment with six Ig-like domains (C2 type), a single hydrophobic transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain of ∼120 amino acids. Several isoforms of PECAM-1 having a different cytoplasmic domain are also potentially generated by alternative splicing. Immunolocalization studies have indicated that PECAM-1 is concentrated at intercellular junctions, suggesting that it may regulate cell-cell interactions (reviewed in Refs. 3DeLisser H.M. Newman P.J.

This notion was further strengthened by the discovery that PECAM-1 is a potent adhesion molecule. Unlike most other adhesion molecules, however, PECAM-1 can participate both in homophilic and heterophilic interactions. In addition to itself (5DeLisser H.M. Chilkotowsky J. Yan H.-C. Daise M.L.

Interestingly, the participation of PECAM-1 in homotypicversus heterotypic interactions is controlled by its cytoplasmic region (6Sun Q.-H. DeLisser H.M. Zukowski M.M. Paddock C. Albelda S.M.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A highly conserved tyrosine in this domain, tyrosine 686 (Tyr-686), is important for this regulation (14Famiglietti J. Sun J. DeLisser H.M. Albelda S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The capacity of PECAM-1 to mediate adhesion seems to be involved in a variety of biological processes, including release of leukocytes from the bone marrow, migration of inflammatory cells across endothelia, development of the cardiovascular system, and angiogenesis (reviewed in Refs. 3DeLisser H.M.

Invest. 1997; 99: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Further to its participation in cell adhesion, PECAM-1 can operate as a signal transduction molecule. This idea was initially suggested by the observation that PECAM-1 undergoes phosphorylation on tyrosine residues in response to several stimuli. These include mechanical stimulation of endothelial cells (15Osawa M. Masuda M. Harada N. Lopes R.B. Fujiwara K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 72: 229-237PubMed Google Scholar), platelet aggregation (16Jackson D.E. Ward C.M. Wang R. Newman P.J. J. Biol.

Whereas the exact impact of tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 has not been fully elucidated, there is some evidence that it may regulate the adhesive properties of PECAM-1 (Ref. 14Famiglietti J. Sun J. DeLisser H.M. Albelda S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 prompts its association with intracellular signal transduction molecules. Following platelet aggregation (16Jackson D.E. Ward C.M. Wang R. Newman P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6986-6993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) or stimulation of FcεRI on basophils (18Sagawa K. Kimura T. Swieter M. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31086-31091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), PECAM-1 associates with SHP-2, a PTP with two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains at its amino terminus. This association was determined to require a pair of tyrosines in the cytoplasmic domain of human PECAM-1 (Tyr-663 and Tyr-686), and the tandem SH2 domains of SHP-2 (Refs. 20Jackson D.E. Kupcho K.R. Newman P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24868-24875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar and 21Masuda M. Osawa M. Shigematsu H. Harada N. Fujiwara K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the sequences surrounding Tyr-663 and Tyr-686 are reminiscent of an “immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif” (or ITIM) (22Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 368: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 23D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C.

This motif is present in “inhibitory” receptors such as FcγRIIb and the killer inhibitory receptors, and can inhibit cell signaling by recruiting SH2 domain-bearing phosphatases. However, the exact physiological consequences of the interaction of PECAM-1 with SHP-2 remain to be determined. To better comprehend the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in the function of PECAM-1, it is critical to have a detailed understanding of the protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) responsible for this phosphorylation. To this end, we have studied the ability of various classes of cytoplasmic PTKs to induce PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in COS-1 cells. The results of our studies showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of mouse PECAM-1 could be mediated by the Src family and Csk family of PTKs. Further analyses revealed that both types of kinases were apt at phosphorylating Tyr-686 of PECAM-1, but were unable to cause detectable phosphorylation of Tyr-663. Finally, it was observed that phosphorylation of mouse PECAM-1 by either Src or Csk family kinases was sufficient to induce binding to SHP-2, as well as to the closely related phosphatase SHP-1. COS-1 cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and antibiotics. The wild-type mousepecam-1 cDNA, as well as the tyrosine 686 (Tyr-686)-to-phenylalanine 686 (Phe-686) mutant, were described (14Famiglietti J. Sun J. DeLisser H.M. Albelda S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). An additional variant bearing a tyrosine 663 (Tyr-663)-to-phenylalanine 663 (Phe-663) substitution was created by site-directed mutagenesis. The cDNA in which both Tyr-663 and Tyr-686 were replaced by phenylalanines (Y663F/Y686F mutant) was produced by standard recombinant DNA technology, using the Phe-663 and Phe-686pecam-1 cDNAs as templates.

Anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Institute, Lake Placid, New York. Transient transfections in COS-1 cells were performed by the DEAE-dextran method, according to a previously detailed protocol (33Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, COS-1 cells were harvested and lysed in TNE buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) supplemented with 10 μg/ml each of the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin,N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone,N-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, as well as the phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride (50 mm) and sodium orthovanadate (1 mm). PECAM-1 was immunoprecipitated using mAb MEC 13.3, followed by Staphylococcus aureus protein A (Calbiochem) coupled to rabbit anti-rat IgG. SHP-1 and SHP-2 were immunoprecipitated with the antisera specified above, and the immune complexes were subsequently captured with S. aureus protein A. After three washes, bound proteins were separated in 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels. Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were detected by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10, whereas PECAM-1 was revealed by immunoblotting with the polyclonal rabbit anti-PECAM-1 serum. Expression of PTKs, SHP-1, and SHP-2 was verified by immunoblotting of equivalent amounts of cell lysates with the relevant antibodies. Immunoreactive products were detected with125I-goat anti-mouse IgG (ICN) for mouse antibodies and125I-protein A (Amersham) for rabbit antisera, and subsequent autoradiography. Data were quantitated with a PhosphorImager (BAS 2000; Fuji). Lck and Csk were expressed by transient transfection in COS-1 cells and immunoprecipitated from 100 μg of cell lysates using the indicated antisera. After extensive washing of the immunoprecipitates, immune complex kinase reactions were conducted for 15 min at room temperature in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 2 μm non-radioactive ATP, and 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products Inc.). Where specified, synthetic peptides (5 μg) were added as substrates. Phosphorylated products were resolved in 16.5% Tricine gels and detected by autoradiography. The synthetic peptides corresponding to Tyr-663 (PQNMDVEY663TEVEVSS) and Tyr-686 (TRATETVY686SEIRKVD) of mouse PECAM-1 were synthesized commercially. A peptide containing part of the ζ chain of the T-cell antigen receptor complex (NQLYNELNLGRREEYDVLDK) was provided by Dr. Philip Morton (Monsanto Co., St. Louis, MO). GST fusion proteins were produced and purified as outlined in a previous publication (34Peri K.G. Gervais F. Weil R. Davidson D. Gish G.D. Veillette A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2765-2772PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception that protein expression was induced by overnight culture at room temperature in the presence of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. The abundance of the fusion proteins was verified by gel electrophoresis of representative aliquots and staining with Coomassie Blue (data not shown). Approximately 1 μg of the fusion proteins immobilized on agarose-glutathione beads (Sigma) was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with lysates from COS-1 cells expressing PECAM-1 alone, or with either Lck or Csk. Following several washes, bound proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and probed by anti-PECAM-1 immunoblotting. The expression of PECAM-1, Lck and Csk in transfected cells was verified by immunoblotting of lysates with the appropriate antisera (data not shown). Earlier reports have documented that PECAM-1 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to a wide variety of stimuli (15Osawa M. Masuda M. Harada N. Lopes R.B. Fujiwara K. Eur. J.

As these stimuli trigger the activation of several classes of cytoplasmic PTKs, it is difficult to infer from these studies which of these kinases is responsible for PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. As a matter of fact, it is conceivable that more than one of these enzymes carries out PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in physiological situations. To help identify these PTKs, we wished to dissect the requirements for PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in a heterologous system. Transient transfections in COS-1 cells were chosen for these analyses, as they have proven to be very useful for exploring the tyrosine phosphorylation of other substrates (35Chan A.C. Iwashima M.

A mouse pecam-1 cDNA was transiently transfected in COS-1 cells, in the absence or presence of PTKs known to regulate hemopoietic and/or endothelial cell functions. After 60 h, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 containing buffer, and PECAM-1 was immunoprecipitated using anti-PECAM-1 mAb MEC 13.3. Following several washes, immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (Fig. 1, A and B, top panel). The abundance of PECAM-1 in the immunoprecipitates was also verified by stripping the immunoblot and reprobing with a polyclonal rabbit anti-PECAM-1 serum (bottom panel). In the absence of exogenous PTKs (Fig. 1 A, lane 8), mouse PECAM-1 was not detectably tyrosine-phosphorylated in COS-1 cells. However, upon expression of the Src-related kinases p56lck(lane 9), p56lyn (lane 12), p53lyn (lane 13), and p60c-src (lane 14), there was a prominent increase in its phosphotyrosine content. Introduction of p50csk (lane 10), which belongs to a separate enzyme family (reviewed in Ref. 40Chow L.M.L. Veillette A. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 207-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1. By contrast though, Syk (lane 11), a kinase playing an essential role in numerous hemopoietic cell types (reviewed in Ref. 41van Oers N.S.C. Weiss A. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), was incapable of stimulating PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. The differential effects of these PTKs on PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation were not caused by variations in the levels of PECAM-1 expression, as indicated by the immunoblot with anti-PECAM-1 antibodies (bottom panel). Moreover, there were no tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in anti-PECAM-1 immunoprecipitates obtained from cells not transfected with the pecam-1 cDNA (lanes 1–7), showing that the immunoreactive products detected were clearly PECAM-1. It is noteworthy, however, that PECAM-1 frequently migrated as a doublet in these assays, most likely as a result of being differentially glycosylated in its extracellular domain. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 could also be documented when only the cell surface-associated PECAM-1 was immunoprecipitated from transfected COS-1 cells (data not shown). In another experiment (Fig. 1 B), we tested the ability of Chk, a Csk-related enzyme selectively expressed in hemopoietic cells and brain (27Chow L.M.L. Jarvis C. Hu Q. Nye S.H. Gervais F.G.

As was the case for Lck (lane 3) and Csk (lane 4), p52chk (lane 5) was also efficient at provoking tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1. By comparison, unrelated protein- tyrosine kinases such as Itk (lane 6; Ref. 45Siliciano J.D. Morrow T.A. Desiderio S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11194-11198Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and Pyk2 (data not shown; Ref. 46Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar) were unable to induce this phosphorylation. Next, we wished to determine which tyrosine residue(s) in mouse PECAM-1 was phosphorylated by the Src and Csk families of PTKs. To this end, we first tested the impact of mutating the two postulated sites of PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, Tyr-663 and Tyr-686, on the phosphorylation of PECAM-1 in COS-1 cells (Fig. 2 A). Cells were transfected with a pecam-1 cDNA in which either Tyr-663 or Tyr-686 was replaced by phenylalanine, in the presence of either a representative Src family kinase (p56lck) or p50csk. Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of anti-PECAM-1 immunoprecipitates showed that Phe-663 PECAM-1 (lanes 5 and 6) was as extensively tyrosine-phosphorylated by Lck and Csk as wild-type PECAM-1 (lanes 2 and 3). In fact, the phosphotyrosine content of Phe-663 PECAM-1 (lanes 5 and6) was slightly greater (∼2-fold) than that of wild-type molecules (lanes 2 and 3). While the exact basis for this phenomenon is not known, it is possible that Phe-663 PECAM-1 interacted less efficiently with endogenous SH2 domain-containing phosphatases expressed in COS-1 cells (see Fig. 8), thereby allowing more stable phosphorylation of other tyrosines in its cytoplasmic domain. This experiment also revealed that Phe-686 PECAM-1 was efficiently phosphorylated by p56lck (lane 8). However, this mutant failed to be detectably phosphorylated by Csk (lane 9).Figure 8Impact of mutation of Tyr-663 and Tyr-686 on the binding of mouse PECAM-1 to SHP-1 and SHP-2. The ability of various mutants of PECAM-1 to associate with SHP-1 and SHP-2 was ascertained in transiently transfected COS-1 cells. The detection of immunoreactive products above and below PECAM-1 in lanes 1–4 (top panel) is due to nonspecific cross-reactivity of the antiserum with proteins of unknown identity (data not shown). The migrations of PECAM-1, SHP-1, SHP-2, and Lck are indicated on theleft. Exposures: first panel, 24 h;second panel, 16 h; third and fourth panels, 8 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The inability of individual mutations at Tyr-663 and Tyr-686 to abolish Lck-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of mouse PECAM-1 raised the possibility that both sites were phosphorylated by the Src family kinase. To evaluate this prospect, a pecam-1 cDNA in which both tyrosines were replaced by phenylalanines was created. When expressed in COS-1 cells (Fig. 2 B), we found that Y663F/Y686F PECAM-1 was still tyrosine phosphorylated in the company of p56lck (lane 5). Such a finding implied that phosphorylation at one or more additional tyrosines on PECAM-1 was induced by Lck. In this assay, we also noted that the phosphotyrosine content of Phe-686 PECAM-1 (lane 4) in the presence of p56lck was reduced ∼3-fold by comparison to that of wild-type PECAM-1 (lane 2). While not seen in the experiment depicted in Fig. 2 A, this effect was occasionally observed in other assays (data not shown). It suggested that Lck may be able to phosphorylate Tyr-686 (see below). To address more directly the ability of Lck and Csk to phosphorylate Tyr-663 and Tyr-686, in vitro peptide phosphorylation assays were conducted. Peptides corresponding to Tyr-663 (PQNMDVEY663TEVEVSS) and Tyr-686 (TRATETVY686SEIRKVD) were synthesized, and their ability to act as substrates for Lck and Csk was tested in immune complex kinase reactions (Fig. 3).

However, the signaling mechanisms of cytokine-mediated LDL receptor induction are largely unexplored. In the present studies, we examined the potential involvement of different mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Northern analysis demonstrated that IL-1β or TNF significantly increased LDL receptor transcript in HepG2 cells, whereas expression of another tightly regulated sterol-responsive squalene synthase gene was unaffected. IL-1β treatment resulted in transient activation of three MAPK cascades, namely p46/54JNK, p38MAPK, and ERK-1/2, with maximal activation of 20-, 25-, and 3-fold, respectively, occurring 15–30 min after cytokine addition. PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MAPK kinase activity, inhibited IL-1β-induced LDL receptor expression. In contrast, SB202190, a specific inhibitor of p38MAPK, enhanced IL-1β-induced LDL receptor expression, with a concomitant increase in ERK-1/2 activity. Similarly, TNF induced LDL receptor expression also required ERK-1/2 activation. Finally, sterols repressed IL-1β induced receptor expression, without affecting ERK-1/2 activation. These results show that IL-1β- or TNF-induced LDL receptor expression requires ERK-1/2 activation, that the p38MAPK pathway negatively regulates LDL receptor expression, and that sterols inhibit induction at a point downstream of ERK-1/2 in HepG2 cells.

The concentrations of IL-1β and TNF similar to those found following infection induce low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor expression in human hepatoma (HepG2) cells, and this effect is not part of its mitogenic response, as IL-1β did not increase DNA synthesis (15Moorby C.

Interestingly, a 1.56-kilobase pair region of the 5′-flanking region of the human LDL receptor promoter has been shown to confer IL-1β-dependent induction to an heterologous gene, suggesting that increased receptor expression results from activation of LDL receptor transcription and is not due to an alteration in LDL receptor mRNA stability (18Stopeck A.T. Nicholson A.C. Mancini F.P. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17489-17494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have also established that, unlike TNF, IL-1β-induced LDL receptor transcription does not require protein synthesis and, therefore, likely depends on activation of a preexisting component(s). The initial step in their action is the association of agonist with its cell surface receptors, followed by intracellular protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (19Guy G.R. Chua S.P. Wong N.S.

The signal transduction mechanisms by which these cytokines stimulates LDL receptor expression are poorly characterized. Many extracellular signals elicit specific biological responses through activation of MAPK cascades (22Sturgill T.W. Wu J. Biochim. Biophys.

The three major subfamilies of MAPKs in higher eukaryotes include ERK-1/2, 46/54JNK, and p38MAPK, all of which are activated by phosphorylation of a tyrosine and a threonine residue catalyzed by a dual specificity MAPK kinase. ERKs are most strongly activated by mitogenic signals such as growth factors or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), whereas p46/54JNK, and p38MAPK are activated by stressful stimuli such as the inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β, and TNF, thermal shock, and osmotic shock (23Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Activation of MAPKs leads to distinct cellular responses mediated by phosphorylation of specific target substrates (25Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown involvement of ERK-1/2 signaling cascade in TPA-induced LDL receptor expression in HepG2 cells (28Kumar A. Chambers T.C. Cloud-Heflin B.A. Mehta K.D. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 4220-4228Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the early in vivosignaling events triggered by IL-1β that elicit LDL receptor activation in HepG2 cells. We show that, although IL-1β at physiological concentrations strongly activates the stress-activated p46/54JNK and p38MAPK in these cells, induction of LDL receptor expression actually depends on the mild induction of the ERK-1/2 signaling cascade by this cytokine. We also demonstrate that the stress-activated p38MAPK cascade negatively regulates LDL receptor expression via ERK-1/2. These results provide new insight into the mechanisms of IL-1β action and suggest that the MAPKs may be the critical components that control LDL receptor expression. IL-1β was purchased from R & D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). TNF was obtained from Collaborative Biomedical (Bedford, MA).

[α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Dupont (Boston, MA), and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit was obtained from Amersham International. Cholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. HepG2 cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in Eagle's minimum essential medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies Inc.), 2 mml-glutamine, 20 units/ml penicillin, and 20 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE with an 10% acrylamide separation gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 192 mmglycine, and 10% methanol at 4 °C for 12–16 h at a constant current of 50 mA or for 2 h at 300 mA with similar results. Nitrocellulose membranes were processed as described previously (28Kumar A. Chambers T.C. Cloud-Heflin B.A. Mehta K.D. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 4220-4228Google Scholar,29Kumar A. Mehta K.D. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 231: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes were incubated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.2% v/v Tween 20 (Tris/NaCl/Tween 20) with 5% w/v non-fat dried milk for 1 h, washed in Tris/NaCl/Tween 20 (3 × 5 min), and incubated for 1 h with primary antibody in Tris/NaCl/Tween 20 containing 1% milk at room temperature for non-phospho-antibodies and overnight at 4 °C for phospho-specific antibodies. The following dilutions were used for individual antibodies against different proteins: ERK-1/2 (1:1600), phospho-ERK-1/2 (1:1000), phospho-p46/54JNK (1:1000), phospho-p38MAPK (1:1600), phospho-MEK-1/2 (1:1000), and MKP-1 (1:1500). After further washing in Tris/NaCl/Tween 20, membranes were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-IgG secondary antibody (Bio-Rad, diluted 1:5000), and immunoreactive proteins were detected by ECL as described by the supplier. Quantitative analyses of protein levels were performed by scanning of the autoradiograms and are representative of three or more independent experiments. HepG2 cells were grown and treated as described in the figure legends. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol, and Northern blotting was done essentially as described earlier (28Kumar A. Chambers T.C. Cloud-Heflin B.A. Mehta K.D. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 4220-4228Google Scholar,30Mehta K.D. Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10406-10414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μg of total cellular RNA were fractionated on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a Zeta probe membrane by capillary blotting. RNA blots were hybridized with LDL receptor and squalene synthase-specific single-stranded M13 probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Hybridized filters were washed and exposed to Kodak x-ray film. The relative intensities of specific bands were determined densitometrically within the linear range of film on a model 300A laser densitometer (Molecular Dyanamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and Image Quant software. LDL receptor mRNA was normalized to squalene synthase (included in this study) or to β-actin (data not shown) mRNA level, and data for each points were plotted as the percentage of LDL receptor mRNA as compared with controls. Human LDL receptor promoter-reporter constructs were transfected into HepG2 cells using LipofectAMINE (31Dhawan P. Chang R. Mehta K.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4132-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and the effect of PD98059 on IL-1β-induced expression of the luciferase gene was determined. Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and removed from the flask by gentle scraping into 0.25 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 μm okadaic acid, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin). After 15 min on ice, insoluble material was removed by sedimentation for 20 min at 100,000 × g, and ERK-1/2 activity was determined by an immune complex kinase assay with myelin basic protein as the substrate as described previously (32Osborn M.T. Chambers T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30950-30955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Briefly, each cell extract (400 μg) was mixed with 10 μl of anti-ERK-1/2 antibody for 1 h, and then 30 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose in lysis buffer was added for an additional 1 h. The immune complex was recovered by sedimentation for 5 min in a microcentrifuge, washed three times with 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 2 mm sodium vanadate and once with ERKs reaction buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 6 μm pepstatin). The immunoprecipitate was resuspended in 30 μl of reaction buffer containing 6 μg of myelin basic protein and 5 μl of 0.3 mm[γ-32P]ATP (30,000 cpm/pmol). After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by 8 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer and heating to 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide), and gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Northern blot analysis of HepG2 cells that had been incubated in the absence and presence of 5 ng/ml IL-1β for various periods of time showed that LDL receptor induction reached a peak at 4 h after IL-1β stimulation and remained elevated thereafter (Fig. 1). Furthermore, we tested whether IL-1β would similarly stimulate another tightly regulated gene involved in cholesterol homeostasis, squalene synthase. Our results show that, in contrast to LDL receptor gene, IL-1β did not affect expression of the squalene synthase gene (Fig. 1). The activation of MAPKs requires specific phosphorylation of the threonine and tyrosine residues within the TXY motif (33Gomez N. Cohen P. Nature. 1991; 353: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 34Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). We first evaluated the temporal characteristics of MAPKs activation in response to 5 ng/ml IL-1β stimulation in HepG2 cells by using antibodies specific for phosphorylated (activated) forms of ERK-1/2, p46/54JNK, and p38MAPK. These antibodies do not recognize inactive, unphosphorylated enzymes. As shown in Fig. 2 A, stimulation by IL-1β preferentially activated p46/54MAPK (20-fold) and p38MAPK (25-fold) as compared with ERK-1/2 (3-fold). The increased activation of p46/54JNK and p38MAPKwere detected within 5 min of exposure to IL-1β, reached a peak in 15–30 min, and returned to the basal level at 90 min. Consistent with the immunoblot analyses, an increase in ERK-1/2 activity after 30 min of IL-1β treatment, which declined to the basal level at 90 min, was observed in immune complex kinase assays using myelin basic protein as a substrate (Fig. 2 B). As a positive control for ERK-1/2 activation in the kinase assay, extracts from cells treated with 100 nm TPA for 15 min were included because we have observed earlier TPA-dependent ERK-1/2 activation in HepG2 cells (28Kumar A. Chambers T.C. Cloud-Heflin B.A. Mehta K.D. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 4220-4228Google Scholar). The kinetics and fold activation of ERK-1/2 by immune complex kinase assay were similar to those obtained on immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibody. Therefore, we have used the phospho-specific immunoblot as an index of kinase activity in our subsequent experiments. Taken together, these results establish that the different MAPKs are rapidly and transiently activated by IL-1β in HepG2 cells. The activation of ERK-1/2 is catalyzed by the dual specificity kinase, MEK-1/2 (35Seger R. Ahn N.G. Posada J. Munar E.S. Jensen A.M. Cooper J.A. Cobb M.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14373-14381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L. Science. 1992; 258: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). To phosphorylate and activate ERK-1/2, MEK-1/2 must itself be serine-phosphorylated (37Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 38Dent P. Haser W. Haystead T.A. Vincent L.A. Roberts T.M. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1992; 257: 1404-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). This portion of the ERK-1/2 activation cascade was analyzed by immunoblotting total lysates with an antibody specific for serine-phosphorylated (activated) MEK. As shown in Fig. 3, IL-1β induced MEK-1/2 phosphorylation with kinetics similar to that of ERK-1/2 activation. MAPKs phosphorylation is a reversible process, indicating that protein phosphatases play a crucial role in controlling enzymatic activity (39Alessi D.R. Smythe C. Keyse S.M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2015-2020PubMed Google Scholar). The dual specificity phosphatase family is exemplified by mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), which dephosphorylates these kinases at both the Thr and Tyr residues necessary for enzymatic activity (40Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 41Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16116-16119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In view of recent demonstrations (42Sun H. Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1995; 266: 285-288Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 43Brondello J.M. McKenzie F.R. Sun H. Tonks N.K. Pouyssegur J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1895-1904PubMed Google Scholar, 44Kusari A.B. Byon J. Bandyopadhyay D. Kenner K.A. Kusari J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1532-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) that expression and activity of MKP-1 are regulated in response to stress and insulin, the expression of MKP-1 was measured in HepG2 cells that had been incubated in the absence and presence of 5 ng/ml IL-1β for identical periods of time. As shown in Fig. 3, IL-1β did not induce any significant changes in MKP-1 expression at those time points where maximum activation of MEK-1/2, or MAPKs was observed, suggesting that the increases in MAPKs activity are not due to changes in MKP-1 expression level. A slight increase in MKP-1 expression was observed at later time points, suggesting the possibility that this increase may account for the decrease in ERK-1/2 phosphorylation. The above results are consistent with the notion that activation of ERK-1/2 is mediated by MEK-1/2 activation. Next, we examined the role of MEK-1/2 and its downstream effectors, ERK-1/2, in mediating IL-1β-induced expression of the LDL receptor by use of a selective inhibitor of MEK activation, PD98059 (45Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 46Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that PD98059 (5–50 μm) completely blocked IL-1β-induced ERK-1/2 activation without affecting activation of p46/54JNK or p38MAPK. Neither IL-1β nor PD98059 affected ERK-1/2 protein expression, as indicated by immunoblotting of the same extracts with a phosphorylation-independent ERK antibody (Fig. 4). Having established these conditions, the effect of 5–50 μmPD98059 on IL-1β-dependent activation of LDL receptor expression was next examined in HepG2 cells. As shown in Fig. 5, 80% inhibition of IL-1β-dependent LDL receptor expression was observed in HepG2 cells pretreated with PD98059, suggesting an absolute requirement of this signaling cascade in IL-1β-induced LDL receptor expression. Furthermore, transfection of HepG2 cells with human LDL receptor promoter-reporter plasmids followed by IL-1β treatment resulted in an increased luciferase gene expression, and this effect was blocked by the PD98059. 2A. Kumar and K. D. Mehta, unpublished results. We have repeated the above experiments using PD98059 and IL-1β from two different sources with similar results in at least four different studies.Figure 5Effect of PD98059 and SB202190 on IL-1β- induced LDL receptor expression. HepG2 cells were grown as described in Fig. 1. They were either untreated or treated with IL-1β (5 ng/ml) for 4 h either in the absence or presence of indicated concentrations of PD98059 or SB202190 added 30 min prior to IL-1β addition. Total RNA (20 μg) was subjected to Northern blot analysis. The filter was hybridized with a 32P-labeled LDL receptor probe. A representative autoradiogram is shown above, and the results of the densitometric analysis of LDL receptor mRNA levels normalized to actin mRNA (not shown) are shown below (fold induction over untreated cells (zero time point)).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Collectively, these results suggest that, although IL-1β potently activates and exerts most of its physiological effects through p38MAPK and p46/54JNK, it is the slight activation of the ERK-1/2 cascade which is mainly responsible for the LDL receptor induction by IL-1β in HepG2 cells. As many of the effects of IL-1β have been shown to be mediated through p38MAPKpathway (2Saklatvala J. Davis W. Guesdon F. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. 1996; 351: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of SB202190, a potent p38MAPK inhibitor (47Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar, 48Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar), on IL-1β-mediated LDL receptor induction. SB202190 is known to inhibit p38MAPKwith an IC50 of 0.6 μm and even at 100 μm had no effect on activities of 12 other protein kinases tested, including ERK-1/2 or p46/54JNK (48Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar). We also confirmed that 5 μm SB202190 did not inhibit the phosphorylation levels of p38MAPK and p46/54JNK(Fig. 4). Pretreatment of HepG2 cells for 30 min with or without 0.5 to 5 μm SB202190, followed by incubation with IL-1β for 4 h reproducibly enhanced LDL receptor expression (Fig. 5). Interestingly, this induction was accompanied by a concomitant increase in ERK-1/2 activity without affecting phosphorylation levels of the p38MAPK and P46/54JNK (Fig. 4). Furthermore, enhanced LDL receptor expression and increased ERK-1/2 activity was not observed with SB202190 in the presence of PD98059 (data not shown). These results strongly suggests that the p38MAPK negatively regulates IL-1β-induced ERK-1/2 activity and LDL receptor induction. Treatment of HepG2 cells with IL-1β in the presence of sterols (25-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol) resulted in loss of IL-1β-induced LDL receptor expression (Fig. 6 A), an observation consistent with an earlier study (18Stopeck A.T. Nicholson A.C. Mancini F.P. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17489-17494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reduced expression of squalene synthase in the presence of sterols (lane 3) is consistent with its well established negative regulation by sterols in HepG2 cells (49Guam G. Jiang G. Koch R.L. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21958-21965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To test whether the induction is lost due to lack of activation of ERK-1/2, we evaluated the effects of sterols on IL-1β-dependent activation of this kinase in HepG2 cells. IL-1β was added to the cells pretreated with sterols, and ERK-1/2 activation was measured. As shown in Fig. 6 B, irrespective of sterol concentrations used, IL-1β induced ERK-1/2 activity, suggesting that the loss of an IL-1β-dependent increase in LDL receptor induction is not due to lack of activation of ERK-1/2 in the presence of sterols in HepG2 cells. Earlier studies had proposed that IL-1β and TNF possibly enhance LDL receptor expression by different mechanisms in HepG2 cells (18Stopeck A.T. Nicholson A.C. Mancini F.P. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17489-17494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the involvement of ERK-1/2 in TNF-dependent activation of LDL receptor expression in this cell line. TNF (100 ng/ml) treatment for 4 h increased LDL receptor expression in HepG2 cells (Fig. 7 A). Like IL-1β, TNF strongly activated p46/54JNK and p38MAPK (data not shown) with a slight activation of the ERK-1/2 (Fig. 7 B). Pretreatment with 50 μm PD98059 for 30 min blocked TNF induced LDL receptor expression (Fig. 7 A), thus supporting the involvement of the ERK-1/2 signaling in the induction process. Furthermore, similar to IL-1β, treatment with 5 μm SB202190 enhanced TNF induced LDL receptor expression (Fig. 7 A), with a parallel increase in ERK-1/2 activation (Fig. 7 B). The results presented in this study establish a role for the ERK-1/2 activation in IL-1β-induced LDL receptor expression in HepG2 cells. First, IL-1β treatment leads to an activation of ERK-1/2 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2). The kinetics of ERK-1/2 activation and LDL receptor induction are closely related, thereby providing the first in vivo evidence linking them kinetically. Second, PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK activity, inhibits both ERK-1/2 activation and LDL receptor expression induced by IL-1β, without affecting phosphorylation levels of p46/54JNK and p38MAPK. Although IL-1β treatment resulted in activation of other MAPKs, the complete loss of IL-1β induced LDL receptor expression on treatment with PD98059 rules out involvement of other MAPKs in LDL receptor induction by IL-1β. Furthermore, IL-1β-induced phosphorylation of MEK-1/2 correlates with the ERKs activation, which is consistent with the notion that ERK-1/2 induction is mediated through MEK activation. These results show that IL-1β signal acts upstream of ERK-1/2 phosphorylation, at least at the level of MEK-1/2 activation. The ERK cascade is normally required for the essential function as a positive regulator of cell proliferation in response to growth signals, and strong correlations between ERKs activation and DNA synthesis have been shown in earlier studies (27Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar, 50Meloche S. Seuwen K. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 845-854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Kahan C. Seuwen K. Meloche S. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13369-13375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In view of an earlier demonstration that IL-1β-induced activation of LDL receptor expression in HepG2 cells is not a consequence of increased DNA synthesis, involvement of ERK-1/2 in IL-1β-dependent LDL receptor induction is surprising, and suggests that these isoforms can be coordinately activated in response to a wide range of mitogenic as well as nonmitogenic stimuli. Furthermore, although physiological concentrations of IL-1β strongly activated p46/54JNK and p38MAPK, the lessor induction of ERK-1/2 proved to be the crucial mediator of the cytokine's action in LDL receptor induction. These results emphasize a general point of significance, namely, that although a specific signaling pathway may appear to dominate a response, other mildly activated pathways can be critical, and thus should not be overlooked or ignored. The present study has focused on the role of MAPKs in IL-1β-induced LDL receptor expression. Results presented here along with an earlier report (18Stopeck A.T. Nicholson A.C. Mancini F.P. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17489-17494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are consistent with the notion that IL-1β induces LDL receptor expression at the transcriptional level. In most cell types, the mitogenic signal is relayed from the cytoplasm into the nucleus by the nuclear translocation of the phosphorylated ERK-1/2, resulting in phosphorylation and activation of a range of transcription factors (52Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). The precise role of phosphorylation in transcriptional activation of LDL receptor expression in response to IL-1β is unclear but may involve phosphorylation of transcription factors critical for LDL receptor expression (53Mehta K.D. Chang R. Underwood J. Wise J. Kumar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33616-33622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 54Wang X. Zelenski M.G. Yang J. Sakai J. Brown M.S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13489-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), or modification of co-activators such as the cAMP-response element binding (CREB) protein (56Oliner J.D. Andersen J.M. Hansen S.K. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Given that ERK-1/2 activation occurs rapidly and transiently (Fig. 2), and LDL receptor induction follows relatively slow kinetics (Fig. 1), the mechanism likely involves this protein kinase cascade in the initial step and does not require it for sustained activation of LDL receptor expression by IL-1β in HepG2 cells. Our demonstration that IL-1β can regulate gene expression through selective activation of ERK-1/2 may explain the lack of effect of p38MAPK inhibitor on IL-1β induction of E-selectin expression on vascular endothelial cells, or IL-1-induced IL-6 production in gingival fibroblasts (57Ridley S.H. Sarsfield S.J. Lee J.C. Bigg H.F. Cawston T.E. Taylor D.J. De Witt D.L. Saklatvala J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3165-3173PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the lack of activation of the squalene synthase gene by IL-1β suggests that the members of the MAPK family selectively regulate expression of specific genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Although p38MAPK has been found to be activated by several forms of environmental stress and cytokines, the physiological and pathophysiological function of this kinase in mammalian cells is still unclear. Recently, roles for p38MAPK in the regulation of cell quiescence and in the promotion of programmed cell death in differentiated cellular systems have been reported (58Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6586-6589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Our demonstration that treatment with SB202190 resulted in superinduction of the LDL receptor by IL-1β suggests that the p38MAPKsignaling cascade exerted a negative effect on LDL receptor expression through negative regulation of the ERK-1/2. Although the precise role for this level of regulation is not yet clear, such a mechanism may provide cells a means to counteract the actions of cytokines and growth factors on LDL receptor expression. It has been demonstrated earlier that, unlike IL-1β, TNF requires protein synthesis for induction of LDL receptor transcription in HepG2 cells (18Stopeck A.T. Nicholson A.C. Mancini F.P. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17489-17494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this observation, it was suggested that biologically redundant cytokines, TNF and IL-1β, may act via different mechanisms to increase LDL receptor expression in HepG2 cells. In the present study, we have shown that both cytokines require ERK-1/2 for induction of LDL receptor expression. PD98059 was found to block the IL-1β- and TNF-dependent induction of LDL receptor expression at a concentration shown to completely inhibit ERKs in HepG2 cells. It is safe to conclude from the above studies that whatever differences exist in their upstream signal transduction pathways, both cytokines activate ERK-1/2 and this step is critically required for LDL receptor induction in response to them. Furthermore, an observation that IL-1β-dependent induction of LDL receptor expression is sensitive to cellular cholesterol levels allowed us to test whether sterols exert their effect upstream or downstream of ERKs activation. The lack of effect of sterols on ERK-1/2 activation under conditions shown to inhibit IL-1β induced LDL receptor expression suggests that sterols acts at a step downstream of this protein kinase pathway. On the other hand, lack of activation of the sterol-sensitive squalene synthase gene by IL-1β (Fig. 1), which is known to contain a functional SRE-1 (44Kusari A.B. Byon J. Bandyopadhyay D. Kenner K.A. Kusari J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1532-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggests that SREBP alone may not be solely responsible for LDL receptor induction by these cytokines. In conclusion, we have provided evidence that MAPK signal transduction pathways play essential and differential roles in the induction of LDL receptor transcription by IL-1β, thus establishing a link between MAPK-mediated intracellular signaling and regulation of LDL receptor gene expression. LDL receptor induction by IL-1β occurs via a complex chain of events initiated after ligand binding that leads to the activation of certain kinases that promote MAPKs phosphorylation. Our results support the possibility that p38MAPK negatively regulates ERK-1/2 activation and some of the responses mediated by this kinase in the presence of IL-1β. The cross-talk between various signaling pathways involving protein phosphorylation is an emerging theme in intracellular communication. Based on the above results, we propose that interplay between these pathways probably has a central role in the processing circuits that direct the transcription of LDL receptor gene. Results presented here will help form a framework for further investigation of the signaling pathways responsible for LDL receptor transcriptional regulation by mitogenic and nonmitogenic stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2060992926,"Chick collapsin-1, the first identified vertebrate member of the semaphorin family of axon guidance proteins, repels specific growth cones. Like all family members, collapsin-1 contains within its sequence a semaphorin domain that is necessary for specifying activity. Two additional structural domains of collapsin-1, the immunoglobulin (Ig) domain and the basic tail, each potentiate collapsin-1 activity. We identify in this study another structural feature of collapsin-1 that is necessary for its function. Collapsin-1 covalently dimerizes, and dimerization is necessary for collapse activity. This dimerization is mediated through a cysteine at residue 723, between the Ig domain and basic tail. The semaphorin domain alone is not active since it cannot dimerize. The collapsing activity of the semaphorin domain can be reconstituted when made as a chimeric construct with an immunoglobin Fc domain, which promotes dimerization."

Rac1 and Rac2 are specifically required for superoxide formation by components of the NADPH oxidase. In binding assays, Rac1 interacts directly with p67phox, but not with the other oxidase components: cytochrome b, p40phox, or p47phox (Prigmore, E., Ahmed, S., Best, A., Kozma, R., Manser, E., Segal, A. W., and Lim, L. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 10717–10722). Here, the Rac1/2 interaction with p67phox has been characterized further. Rac1 and Rac2 can bind to p67phox amino acid residues 170–199, and the N terminus (amino acids 1–192) of p67phox can be used as a specific inhibitor of Rac signaling. Deletion of p67phox C-terminal sequences (amino acids 193–526), the C-terminal SH3 domain (amino acids 470–526), or the polyproline-rich motif (amino acids 226–236) stimulates Rac1 binding by ∼8-fold. p21Cdc42Hs/Rac -activated kinase (PAK) phosphorylates p67phox amino acid residues adjacent to the Rac1/2-binding site, and this phosphorylation is stimulated by deletion of the C-terminal SH3 domain or the polyproline-rich motif.

Reconstitution of the oxidase components in vitro does not accurately reflect complex formation in vivo.

PAK has been shown to be activated by fMet-Leu-Phe in neutrophils and to phosphorylate p47phox in vitro (31Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.-J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Hitherto, kinases that can phosphorylate p67phox have not been identified. We have been using the NADPH oxidase as a model protein complex to investigate the mechanism by which Rho family GTPases activate cellular pathways. In this study, the Rac1-p67phox interaction has been investigated in more detail. Using binding assays, we show that the Rac1-binding site of p67phox is cryptic, located between amino acids 170 and 199, and that the N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–192) can be used as an inhibitor of the Rac signaling pathway. The binding sites in p67phox for Rac1 and p40phox are distinct. Recombinant PAK purified from Escherichia coli can phosphorylate p67phox; the phosphorylation site(s) are cryptic and located adjacent to the Rac1-binding site. Deletion of either the polyproline-rich sequence (aa 1The abbreviations used are: aa, amino acid(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; CRIB, Cdc42Hs/Rac1 interacting domain; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; RBD, Rac1-binding domain; PAK, p21Cdc42Hs/Rac-activated kinase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. 226–236) or the C-terminal SH3 domain (aa 460–526) led to increases in Rac1 binding and PAK phosphorylation, suggesting that there is an intramolecular interaction between these two domains of p67phox that gives rise to the crypticity. Taken together, these data suggest that unfolding of p67phox, via disruption of a potential intramolecular “SH3 domain-polyproline” interaction, may play a role in control of the NADPH oxidase. Swiss 3T3 fibroblast cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotic/antimycotic (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Swiss 3T3 cells were serum-starved for 24–48 h before being microinjected with p67phox protein (0.1–1 mg/ml) and observed by phase-contrast microscopy as described previously (4Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar, 16Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5069-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells in IPL-41 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum were grown in suspension in an orbital shaker. 800 ml of cell culture were infected to saturation with p67phox cDNA containing baculovirus (or control, not infected) and were harvested after 72 h. The cells were washed with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/mlNα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone. The cells were disrupted by sonication (MSE Soniprep), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation (30,000 × g, 15 min). At this stage, cell extracts were used either for experiments or for purification of p67phox by column chromatography; a Hi-load Q-Sepharose column was used with a 50–500 mm NaCl gradient, followed by a phenyl-Sepharose column eluted with a 1 to 0 m NH4SO4gradient, resulting in a p67phox preparation of ∼95% purity as judged by SDS-PAGE. Cdc42Hs, Rac1, p40phox, p67phox, βPAK, and p67phox deletion mutants were expressed in pGEX plasmids or derivatives, and protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose as described previously (4Kozma R.

Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16767-16770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal truncated forms of p67phox (aa 1–58, 1–192, and 1–238) were made by digestion of full-length p67phox in pGEX-2T with two enzymes: EcoRI plus StuI,Bpu11021, or BglII. The DNA was then purified, blunt-ended with Klenow fragment, and religated with T4 DNA ligase. The resulting plasmids contained the first 174, 376, and 714 nucleotides, respectively, of the p67phox coding sequence. C-terminal p67phox was made by digestion of full-length cDNA in pGEX-2T with BamHI and EcoRI, followed by purification of the DNA fragment starting from the internalBamHI site to the EcoRI site (nucleotide 967 to the end) and ligation into BamHI/EcoRI-digested pGEX-3X. The other constructs were made by polymerase chain reaction amplification using full-length p67phox cDNA in pGEX as a template. In all cases, the sense primer contained a BamHI site, and the antisense primer contained an EcoRI site. DNA encoding aa 170–238 was digested with AvrII andEcoRI, blunt-ended with Klenow fragment, and religated. This new plasmid encoded aa 170–199. Mutations were made with the USE kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In all cases, the correct sequence was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing using an Applied Biosystems automated sequencer. p67phox fragment 1–199 was a kind gift from A. Hall (University College London, London). p67phoxdeletion mutant protein fragment 1–192 was unstable and had to be used immediately after purification. Protein was quantified by the method of Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). p67phox deletion proteins were used as GST fusions unless otherwise stated. PAK fragments were subcloned from βPAK cDNA into pGEX vectors (35Manser E. Chong C. Zhao Z.-s. Leung T. Michael G. Hall C. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25070-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The NcoI fragment of βPAK cDNA was cloned into the NcoI site of pGEX-3X derivative p261, encoding aa 37–149 (112 aa). This NcoI clone was digested withBamHI and BglII and religated, generating a plasmid that encoded aa 70–149 (79 aa). This clone starts at the first residue, isoleucine, of the CRIB motif. TheNcoIΔBamHI/BglII plasmid was then digested with EcoRI and religated, deleting aa 93–149. The plasmidNcoIΔBamHI/BglIIΔEcoRI encoded aa 70–93 (24 aa). p21 probes were prepared by incubating Cdc42Hs or Rac1 (5 μg) with 1 μl of [γ-32P]GTP (6000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, 1.6 μm; NEN Life Science Products) in 50 μl of exchange buffer (50 mm NaCl, 25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.25 mm EDTA, 1.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1.25 mm dithiothreitol) for 10 min at room temperature. Protein was directly applied to nitrocellulose filters (5–20 μg) and then incubated with p21 probes in Petri dishes containing 4 ml of binding buffer (50 mm NaCl, 25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.25 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm GTP). Filters were analyzed as described previously (18Prigmore E. Ahmed S. Best A. Kozma R. Manser E. Segal A.W. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10717-10722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Background binding was variable, and therefore, it was essential to make comparisons of p21-target interactions within the same experiment. p21 probes were used uncleaved and cleaved. βPAK was expressed as a GST fusion protein and purified as described previously (35Manser E. Chong C. Zhao Z.-s. Leung T. Michael G. Hall C. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25070-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). βPAK-GST (96 kDa) was not cleaved to allow visualization of potential p67phoxphosphorylation (67 kDa). In vitro kinase assays were carried out as follows. βPAK protein (0.125–0.25 μg) was incubated with 5 μg of either full-length p67phox or fragments in kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5% Triton X-100) with 20 μm ATP/2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5× sample buffer, followed by boiling for 5 min. The proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE. The dye front was removed, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize proteins. Gels were then destained, fixed, and dried before being exposed to Kodak film for between 10 min and 5 h. Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose by semidry blotting, and incubated with blocking buffer, followed by incubation with either anti-p40phox (20Wientjes F.B. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) or anti-Ste20 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) antibodies. The blots were developed using ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to visualize the antibodies as described previously (18Prigmore E. Ahmed S. Best A. Kozma R. Manser E. Segal A.W. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10717-10722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To localize the Rac1-binding site of p67phox, different fragments of this protein were expressed as GST fusions and purified on glutathione affinity columns (Fig. 1 A, arrowheads mark full-length protein). p67phox proteins (∼5 μg, based on the percentage of full-length protein present in the sample) were then dot-blotted onto nitrocellulose and probed with Rac1 Q61L-[γ-32P]GTP. Rac1 binding to full-length p67phox was weaker than to aa 1–238 (Δ239–526) (Fig. 1 B). Rac1 binding to N-terminal fragments of p67phox(aa 1–238, 1–199, and 1–192) was similar. However, Rac1 did not bind p67phox fragment 1–58 or 1–131 (Fig. 1 B,dots 9 and 10). This suggests that aa 131–192 of p67phox are essential for Rac1 binding. Next, deletions of p67phox fragment 1–238 were examined. Rac1 bound aa 170–238 and 170–199 of p67phox, although binding was significantly weaker then that obtained with aa 1–192 (see below). Rac1 did not bind to p67phox fragment 192–238 or the C-terminal part of the protein (aa 300–526) (Fig. 1 B). To confirm that the Rac1-binding site of p67phox was localized to aa 170–199, a deletion of 6 aa of full-length p67phox was made (Δ178–184). This protein did not bind Rac1 (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that the Rac1-binding site of p67phox is located between aa 170–192 and that sequence 1–170 may stabilize the Rac1-p67phox interaction, possibly through the presence of tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) (see “Discussion”), but is not essential for binding. Rac2 is the major Rac isoform present in human neutrophils. To localize the Rac2-binding site p67phox proteins, aa 1–192, 170–238, and 170–199 were immobilized on nitrocellulose and probed with Rac2-[γ-32P]GTP (with GST and fragment 300–526 as controls). Fig. 2 shows that Rac2 binds to the same site in p67phox as Rac1. To characterize further the relationship between p67phoxfragments 1–192, 170–238, and 170–199, we quantified the amount of Rac1 binding to these proteins. Fig. 3shows that Rac1 binding to fragment 1–192 was ∼18-fold higher than binding to fragment 170–199. Since the latter (minimal) domain of p67phox showed significantly reduced Rac1 binding compared with aa 1–192, we investigated whether this was also true for CRIB motif 2The CRIB motif, a sequence of 16 aa, first identified in proteins such as PAK, ACK, and WASP, has been suggested as a consensus sequence for Cdc42Hs/Rac1 binding. proteins (36Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). N-terminal fragments of PAK expressed as GST fusions were analyzed in dot-blot assays, and Cdc42Hs binding was quantified. Cdc42Hs binding to PAK fragment 37–149 (112 aa of βPAK) was ∼25-fold higher than binding obtained with a minimal fragment of 24 aa (Fig. 3). In addition, a clone (CBP5) isolated in a Cdc42Hs two-hybrid screen, which possesses similarity to the CRIB motif, also showed a reduction in Cdc42Hs binding as the polypeptide was reduced in size. 3S. Govind and S. Ahmed, unpublished data. Thus, it appears that additional as yet undefined primary sequences are required for strong Cdc42Hs/Rac1 binding to these targets. The Rac1-binding site (RBD) of p67phox has no obvious similarity to the CRIB motif. In addition, we were unable to align the RBD of p67phox with the Rac1-binding proteins POR1 (37Van Aeist L. Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), tubulin (38Best A. Ahmed S. Kozma R. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3756-3762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and p140Sra-1 (39Kobayashi K. Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakamura T. Nagase T. Nomura N. Matsuura Y. Yoshida-Kubomura N. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 291-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The RBD of p67phox is highly specific for Rac1 in binding assays; it did not interact at all with Cdc42Hs or RhoA (see below). Thus, the RBD could serve as a specific inhibitor of signaling by preventing Rac1 from interacting with targets. To examine this possibility, the effect of p67phox fragment 1–192 on Rac1-dependent phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced ruffling was investigated. Fig. 4 shows a time-lapse experiment of two cells, under phase-contrast microscopy, with the cell inpanel A injected with p67phox protein fragment 1–192, showing that p67phox fragment 1–192 does indeed inhibit PMA-induced membrane ruffling. Furthermore, p67phox fragment 1–192 is specific in its effect on ruffling, as it did not inhibit the formation of either filopodia/retraction fibers (Cdc42Hs-mediated) or stress fibers (RhoA-mediated) (data not shown). We also examined the effects of the smaller fragments of p67phox, 170–199 and 170–238, which bind to Rac1, but much more weakly than fragment 1–192 (Fig. 3). These proteins gave variable results, although a degree of inhibition of PMA-induced ruffling did occur. A quantitative assay may be required to determine the effect of these smaller peptides on Rac1 signaling. Deletion of the C terminus of p67phox (aa 193–526) resulted in an 8–9-fold increase in Rac1 binding (Fig. 5). One possible explanation for this enhancement is that the C-terminal SH3 domain may bind the polyproline-rich sequence (at aa 226–236) and hinder Rac1 binding to aa 170–199. To examine this possibility, p67phox proteins with either the polyproline-rich sequence or the C-terminal SH3 domain deleted were tested for their ability to bind Rac1. Fig. 5 shows that, in both cases, there was an ∼8-fold increase in Rac1 binding to the p67phox deletion mutants. These results are consistent with the idea of a cryptic binding site in p67phox for Rac1 due to the presence of an intramolecular SH3-polyproline interaction. p40phox has been proposed to interact with two parts of p67phox: in the N-terminal region, where Rac1 also binds (22Wientjes F.B. Panayotou G. Reeves E. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 40Sathyamoorthy M. De Mendez I. Adams A.G. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9141-9146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and in the C-terminal region between the two SH3 domains (21Fuchs A. Dagher M.-C. Vignais P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5695-5697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, the possibility exists that Rac1 binding may be affected by p40phox. To investigate this, Rac1 binding to full-length p67phox or aa 1–192 was measured in the presence of increasing amounts of p40phox. The presence of p40phox at up to 10 times the concentration of p67phoxdid not affect Rac1 binding (Fig. 6 A), thus making it unlikely that the binding sites of Rac1 and p40phox overlap. Next, we used a more direct protein-protein interaction assay to determine which portion of p67phox bound to p40phox. Different p67phox-GST fusion proteins (fragments 1–526, 1–526 with polyproline-rich deletion, Δ58K, 1–238, 300–526, and 300–460) were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with purified p40phox. The amount of p40phox retained after washing the beads was assessed by immunoblotting following SDS-PAGE. p67phox Δ58K is a mutation found in a chronic granulomatous disease patient that disrupts Rac1 binding (41Leusen J.H.W. De Klein A. Hilarius P.M. Ahlin A. Palmbad J. Smith C.I.E. Diekmann D. Hall A. Verhoeven A.J. Roos D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1243-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), whereas the other proteins are fragments that have been used to examine Rac binding. p40phox bound clearly to p67phox proteins containing aa 300–460, with little if any binding (above background) to aa 1–238 (Fig. 6 B). These results suggest that the major binding site for p40phox on the p67phox protein is in the C-terminal half of p67phox between the two SH3 domains and confirm data obtained with the yeast two-hybrid system (21Fuchs A. Dagher M.-C. Vignais P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5695-5697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that Cdc42Hs can apparently bind p67phox purified from insect cells (18Prigmore E. Ahmed S. Best A. Kozma R. Manser E. Segal A.W. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10717-10722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To localize the Cdc42Hs-binding site of p67phox, deletion mutants were used in dot-blot assays as described for Rac1. Cdc42Hs did not bind any of the deletion mutants or the full-length p67phoxprotein produced in E. coli (data not shown). Nevertheless, we observed good binding of Cdc42Hs to p67phox purified from insect cells. A possible reason for this difference between E. coli-expressed and insect cell-expressed p67phox could be that a Cdc42Hs-binding protein copurifies with the latter p67phox protein. To examine this, extracts from insect cells infected with control virus were compared with extracts infected with p67phox virus and with purified p67phox protein from insect cells. Interestingly, a 68-kDa Cdc42Hs-binding band was present in all three protein preparations (Fig. 7, lanes 1–3). This band was found to migrate slightly above p67phox when a Coomassie Blue-stained gel was overlaid with the x-ray film from the Cdc42Hs binding experiment. The level of this protein was reduced in the insect cell extracts expressing p67phox. The 68-kDa Cdc42Hs-binding protein did not bind wild-type Rac1 under the conditions of the assay (18Prigmore E. Ahmed S. Best A. Kozma R. Manser E. Segal A.W. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10717-10722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To determine whether this 68-kDa protein could be a Ste20/PAK-like serine/threonine protein kinase present in insects cells, an immunoblotting analysis was carried out using anti-Ste20 antibody. This antibody is raised against the kinase domain of Ste20 and does cross-react with mammalian neutrophil PAK proteins (α, β, and γ isoforms). 4K. Marler and S. Ahmed, unpublished data. The anti-Ste20 antibody did indeed react against the 68-kDa protein present in insect cell purified p67phox (Fig. 7, lane 9). Furthermore, the purified p67phox preparations from insect cells possessed a 68-kDa kinase activity (data not shown). Thus, the Cdc42Hs binding to p67phox that we initially observed (18Prigmore E. Ahmed S. Best A. Kozma R. Manser E. Segal A.W. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10717-10722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) is an artifact due to the presence of a 68-kDa Cdc42Hs-binding protein in insect cell p67phox preparations. Since a 68-kDa PAK-like protein copurified with p67phox in insect cells, we examined whether PAK could phosphorylate p67phox in vitro. Recombinant βPAK purified from E. coli was fully active and nonresponsive to the presence of Rac1 or Cdc42Hs in either autophosphorylation (Fig. 8 A) or myelin basic protein phosphorylation (data not shown) assays. However, in some experiments, we did observe the appearance of a novel phosphorylated band at around 68 kDa when Cdc42Hs or Rac1 was added (Fig. 8 A,lanes 2′-3′). This 68-kDa band is probably a breakdown product of PAK-GST. Interestingly, if the recombinant PAK protein was treated with alkaline phosphatase, its ability to phosphorylate substrate was reduced significantly (data not shown), suggesting that an E. coli kinase can activate PAK. The recombinant PAK protein was able to phosphorylate p67phox (Fig. 8 B). In attempts to localize the PAK phosphorylation sites of p67phox, we observed, as for the Rac1 binding, that deletion of the C-terminal part (aa 239–526) stimulated PAK phosphorylation (Fig. 8 C). p67phox fragments 1–58, 1–131, and 300–526 were not phosphorylated by PAK. The best p67phoxprotein fragment substrate for PAK was aa 170–238 (Fig. 8 C,lane 6), which has four potential phosphorylation sites located between aa 203 and 233 (Fig. 9). Since aa 192–238 were not phosphorylated by PAK, the peptide sequence between aa 170 and 191 must be essential for PAK interaction. PAK phosphorylation of p67phox was also stimulated by deletion of either the C-terminal SH3 domain ("

In this report, the role of the Bmi-1 RING finger in mediating protein-protein interactions is examined using the yeast two-hybrid system. Bmi-1 interacts directly with the RING finger protein dinG/RING1B. Heterodimerization of the two proteins requires the intact RING finger structures of both Bmi-1 and dinG. Although the RING finger domains are necessary for dimerization, they are not sufficient for this process as residues outside the C3HC4 motif are also required. Thus, binding specificity may be partly conferred by residues outside the RING motif. Both Bmi-1 and dinG interact with the Polyhomeotic protein MPh2 through binding domains apart from the RING finger. The data suggest a model whereby Bmi-1, dinG, and MPh2 form a stable heterotrimeric complex in which each protein contributes to the binding of the others."
https://openalex.org/W1991369070,"Molecular mechanisms of vesicle transport between the prevacuolar compartment and the vacuole in yeast or the lysosome in mammalian cells are poorly understood. To learn more about the specificity of this intercompartmental step, we have examined the subcellular localization of a SEC1 homologue, Vps33p, a protein implicated to function in transport between the prevacuolar compartment and the vacuole. Following short pulses, 80–90% of newly synthesized Vps33p cofractionated with a cytosolic enzyme marker after making permeabilized yeast cells. However, during a chase, 20–40% of Vps33p fractionated with permeabilized cell membranes in a time-dependent fashion with a half-time of ∼40 min. Depletion of cellular ATP increased the association rate to a half-time of ∼4 min and caused 80–90% of newly synthesized Vps33p to be associated with permeabilized cell membranes. The association of Vps33p with permeabilized cell membranes was reversible after restoring cells with glucose before permeabilization. TheN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein homologue, Sec18p, a protein with known ATP binding and hydrolysis activity, displayed the same reversible energy-dependent sedimentation characteristics as Vps33p. We determined that the photosensitive analog, 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP, could bind directly to Vps33p with low affinity. Interestingly, excess unlabeled ATP could enhance photoaffinity labeling of 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP to Vps33p, suggesting cooperative binding, which was not observed with excess GTP. Importantly, we did not detect significant photolabeling after deleting amino acid regions in Vps33p that show similarity to ATP interaction motifs. We visualized these events in living yeast cells after fusing the jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the C terminus of full-length Vps33p. In metabolically active cells, the fully functional Vps33p-GFP fusion protein appeared to stain throughout the cytoplasm with one or two very bright fluorescent spots near the vacuole. After depleting cellular ATP, Vps33p-GFP appeared to localize with a punctate morphology, which was also reversible upon restoring cells with glucose. Overall, these data support a model where Vps33p cycles between soluble and particulate forms in an ATP-dependent manner, which may facilitate the specificity of transport vesicle docking or targeting to the yeast lysosome/vacuole.

The compartmentalized nature of eukaryotic cells demands high fidelity mechanisms to ensure maintenance of each organelle's unique content. Organelles of the secretory and endocytic system rely on vesicle-mediated transport pathways not only to move protein cargo throughout the cell but also to preserve their specific protein and lipid compositions. The SNARE hypothesis describes fundamental molecular mechanisms that give rise to the specificity of vesicle-mediated protein transport in eukaryotic cells (1Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2627) Google Scholar). The basic tenet of this notion is that interactions between integral membrane proteins in transport vesicles (v-SNAREs) and in their cognate target organelles (t-SNAREs) direct the specificity of all intercompartmental events (2Sollner T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although substantial evidence exists to support the existence of many v- and t-SNARE proteins, precisely how they function in vesicle transport specificity is continually being revised as more details are uncovered for different systems (3Nichols B.J. Ungermann C. Pelham H.R. Wickner W.T. Haas A. Nature. 1997; 387: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 4von Mollard G.F. Nothwehr S.F. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1511-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, a fact remaining clear and central to the SNARE hypothesis is that multimeric interactions of v- and t-SNAREs with cytosolic proteins play an essential role in the precision of vesicle-mediated transport (5Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 6Sogaard M. Tani K. Ye R.R. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Kirchhausen T. Rothman J.E. Sollner T. Cell. 1994; 78: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The robust genetics of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has identified four genes whose cytosolic protein products are believed to help specify vesicle docking and/or fusion. Fittingly, one of these,SEC1, not only was the first secretory gene identified through mutant isolation (7Novick P. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) but was also the namesake of this family of proteins that are ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic organisms (for reviews see Refs. 8Pevsner J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 45: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9Pevsner J. Scheller R.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 10Halachmi N.

The VPS33 gene was identified in a selection for yeast mutants with defects in vacuolar protein sorting (17Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4936-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Loss ofVPS33 function results in three prominent phenotypes; 1) temperature-sensitive growth (restrictive temperature is 38 °C), 2) severe missorting of both soluble and membrane vacuolar proteins, and 3) abnormal vacuole morphology. Although the vacuole invps33Δ mutants is very fragmented, it is not as severe as the other class C vps mutants,end1/vps11, vps18, andvps16 (18Banta L.M. Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1369-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The VPS33 gene product, Vps33p, is 691 amino acids long, mostly hydrophilic, and cytoplasmically localized. The primary sequence of Vps33p contains two regions that are similar to the type A and B (also called Walker A and B) nucleotide consensus sequences (15Banta L.M. Vida T.A. Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4638-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may bind or hydrolyze ATP, which has never been established. In this study, we have examined ATP binding in the possible function of Vps33p. Our data indicate that Vps33p can indeed bind ATP and that deletion of a region that includes the type B consensus pattern results in both the loss of ATP binding and a nonfunctional protein. Further, Vps33p reversibly changed its localization from the cytosol to a particulate fraction when ATP was depleted in yeast cells, which was also observed for the NSF 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; G6PDH, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; CPY, carboxypeptidase Y; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. homologue, Sec18p.

A series of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion vectors were constructed by inserting a BamHI–BamHI fragment coding for a “super bright” GFP variant, M2 GFP (20Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S.

Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). This resulted in four vectors with two orientations of GFP having several multiple cloning sites. These vectors are named pBG416-GFP-SK, pBG416-GFP-KS (cen/ARS), pBG426-GFP-SK, and pBG426-GFP-KS (2μ origin). Two plasmids, both containing a 3.7-kilobase pair SalI–XbaI DNA fragment, were used for expression of the wild-type VPS33gene. The first plasmid uses pRS416 (cen/ARS) as vector, pJWY33–39; the second uses pRS426 (2μ origin) as vector, pBG33–126. The plasmid, pPRP33–100, is a pBluescript KS vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the 3.7-kilobase pair SalI–XbaIVPS33 DNA fragment. To translate the VPS33 genein vitro, 1600 base pairs were removed between theSalI site and the ATG codon in pPRP33–100, generating pPRP33–101. This placed the VPS33 gene under control of the T3 RNA polymerase promoter. For the remaining constructs, site-directed mutagenesis (24Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) was used to add restriction sites or delete nucleotides. An AatII site was put at −9 base pairs from the VPS33 ATG codon in pJWY33–39 using the oligonucleotide 5′-CTATTCATCGTGACGTCATTTGATAAAGTTGG-3′ to generate pBG33–116. To delete 57 nucleotides encoding amino acids 661–679 in VPS33(the type B-like nucleotide interaction region), an oligonucleotide (5′-TATAGAGTTCATGATCCTTGTGCCATTGATCAACAAATGCTTCATTATAGCTATTTCACCC-3′) was used to loop out the corresponding DNA segment in pJWY33–39. The subsequent VPS33 deletion mutant was subcloned (SalI–XbaI) into pRS426 to generate pCT33–202. Oligonucleotides were used to place BamHI sites inVPS33, in frame to GFP, at amino acids 423 (5′-CAACTCGAGTATAGGATCCTCAATGTCGTT-3′) and 691 (5′-CTATCATATAATGGATCCGATATAGAGTTC-3′) in pJWY33–39. The resulting plasmids, pPRP33–302 (BamHI at position 423), and pPRP33–303 (BamHI at position 691 were used to construct pPRP33–304, which has both BamHI sites by replacing a 1-kilobase pair XhoI–XbaI fragment in pPRP33–302 with the corresponding XhoI–XbaI fragment from pPRP33–303. To put the M2 GFP mutant under control of the VPS33 promoter, pBG33–116 was cut withAatII, blunted, and then cut with SalI and ligated into pBG426-GFP-KS cut with SalI and SmaI to generate pBG33pr-2GFP. To make a GFP fusion at the C terminus ofVPS33, a BamHI-BamHI M2 GFP fragment was ligated into pPRP33–303 at the engineered BamHI site (pBG33691-GFP). To express this from a 2μ plasmid, theSphI and SacI fragment in pBG33–126 was replaced with the SphI and SacI fragment from pBG33691-GFP, making pBG33691–2GFP. A truncated VPS33-GFP fusion was made by cutting pPRP33–304 with BamHI and ligating a BamHI-BamHI M2 GFP fragment, creating pBG33423-GFP. For expression of this truncated GFP fusion, pBG423-GFP was cut with SalI and SacI and inserted into pRS426 to make pBG423–2GFP. To make a Kex2-GFP fusion, a 4-kilobase pair BamHI-BamHI fragment from pYcP-KX2 (25Fuller R.S. Brake A. Thorner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1434-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) was ligated into the BamHI site of pRS416, creating pBG416-KX. The KEX2 gene was amplified from pBG416-KX via polymerase chain reaction with SpeI/SacI ends, cut withSpeI/SacI, and ligated into pBG426-GFP-SK, making pBGKex2–2GFP. This contains GFP at the full-length C-terminal tail of Kex2p. A plasmid encoding an alkaline phosphatase-GFP fusion (Pho8p-GFP) was kindly provided by Greg Odorizzi and Scott Emr (University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA). The preparation and radiolabeling of yeast spheroplasts with Tran35S-label (ICN Radiochemicals, Costa Mesa, CA) used standard methods previously described (26Vida T.A. Huyer G. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The preparation of permeabilized yeast spheroplasts was also via a standardized protocol previously described (27Vida T.A. Graham T.R. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2871-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations for Vps33p were all treated with IgGsorb (The Enzyme Center, Waltham, MA) for ≥ 20 min before the addition of antiserum (15Banta L.M. Vida T.A. Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4638-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Extracts were rocked overnight at 4 °C and then treated with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein A-Sepharose pellets were washed sequentially with two 1-ml portions of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Tween 20 (Tween 20 buffer), two 1-ml portions of Tween 20 buffer containing 2 m urea, and two 1-ml portions of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. After drying, the immunoprecipitates were boiled for 4 min in standard Laemmli sample buffer (2× concentration), and SDS-PAGE was performed as described (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar). Most gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography using Kodak BioMax film. In some cases, the gels were subjected to phosphor imaging analysis using a STORM PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Cells expressing various GFP fusion constructs were grown in minimal proline medium with 0.5% yeast extract to middle or late log phase. They were concentrated to ∼20 A 600units/ml and examined in the same medium. For energy depletion experiments, the cells were washed two or three times in minimal proline medium without glucose and then resuspended in the same medium containing 10 mm NaN3 and 10 mm NaF for periods up to 2 h. To reverse the effects of energy depletion, the cells were washed two or three times in minimal proline medium containing glucose and then incubated for 60–90 min at 30 °C. All micrographs were digitally captured on a Zeiss Axioskop epifluorescence microscope using an Optronics (Goleta, CA) DEI-750 CCD color camera with Adobe Premiere software (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA), a TARGA 2000 video board (Truevision, Inc., Santa Clara, CA), and a PowerPC Macintosh 9500 (Apple Computer, Cupertino, CA). All images were edited with Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems). Yeast strain TVY3350 containing pBG33–126 (wild-type VPS33), pRS426 (vector control), or pCT33–202 (VPS33 with a 19-amino acid deletion of the type B-like region) was grown in minimal proline medium to exponential phase. The cells (25–50 A 600 units) were harvested and converted to spheroplasts. The spheroplasts were regenerated in YPD plus 1.0 m sorbitol for 60 min at 30 °C, harvested again, and washed twice at 4 °C in 1.0m sorbitol, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 150 mm potassium acetate, and 5 mm magnesium acetate containing sodium azide and sodium fluoride (10 mmeach). The washed cells were resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmKPO4, 0.1 mm NaF, 0.1 mmNa2P2O7 (lysis buffer) by adding 15 μl/A 600 unit, and a protease inhibitor mixture was added, which included α2-macroglobulin (125 μg/ml), 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone (40 μg/ml),l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (80 μg/ml), leupeptin (1 μm), trypsin inhibitor (50 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mm), and pepstatin A (0.7 μg/ml). The spheroplasts were agitated twice with 0.5-mm glass beads in a bead beater (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK) at 1-min intervals. The lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet fraction was rinsed with lysis buffer, combined with the first supernatant, and desalted using Bio-Gel P-6DG (Bio-Rad). The desalted extract was subjected to centrifugation at 125,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet fraction was resuspended in lysis buffer at 10–25 mg/ml. All extracts were stored at −70 °C. Reactions were typically 12.5–25 μl in total volume and consisted of ∼125 μg of membrane extract, 20–40 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (ICN Radiochemicals, Costa Mesa, CA, or RPI Corp., Mt. Prospect, IL). All reactions were performed in a 96-well microtiter dish. In general, the reactions were set up and preincubated for 2–10 min prior to UV irradiation. The microtiter dish was placed ∼2 cm below a hand-held 254-nm UV lamp (UVP, Upland, CA, model UVGL-25), and the reactions were irradiated once for 1 min, followed with a 1-min interval of no irradiation and then a second irradiation for 1 min. In some experiments, the filter was removed from the UV light source to increase the radiation. The reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of 4% SDS and 4 mm dithiothreitol. The samples were transferred to a 1.5-ml tube, and the wells were rinsed with 2% SDS and 2 mm dithiothreitol and pooled with the first portion. The samples were heated (65–100 °C) for 2–5 min. The reactions were then immunoprecipitated for Vps33p, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and subjected to autoradiography or PhosphorImager analysis. Ten percent of every reaction was not immunoprecipitated and was analyzed for the total proteins that were photoaffinity-labeled. Important control reactions included using creatine phosphokinase as a positive control, irradiating the 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP before the addition of the yeast extract, and omitting the irradiation step. Photoaffinity labeling of creatine kinase with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP was consistently competed greater than 80% with 2 mm ATP. We never observed photoaffinity labeling of Vps33p when the 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP was photolyzed before the addition of extracts, indicating that secondary reactants were not produced. Similarly, we never observed labeling of Vps33p when we did not photoactivate the 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP, indicating that the azido group on carbon 8 of the adenine ring was the only reactive moiety. For competition experiments, unlabeled nucleotides were generally added 2–10 min before the addition of the 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. When augmenting the reactions with unlabeled 8-azido-ATP, a mixture of the cold and radioactive nucleotides was made, and the two were added together. When the VPS33 gene was first cloned, its protein product, Vps33p, was demonstrated to be a soluble cytoplasmic protein through subcellular fractionation (15Banta L.M. Vida T.A. Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4638-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). When examining the biochemical function of Vps33p, we used an in vitroreconstitution assay that measures intercompartmental transport of procarboxypeptidase Y to the yeast vacuole in permeabilized cells (27Vida T.A. Graham T.R. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2871-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The vps33–4 allele has a single L646P change and retains partial function for vacuolar protein sorting (15Banta L.M. Vida T.A. Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4638-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 29Darsow T. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 30Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2307-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Spheroplasts from a vps33–4 mutant strain were able to mature 35–40% of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) in vivo, while the majority was secreted as the Golgi-modified p2 precursor (data not shown). However, even with this capacity for CPY maturation,vps33–4-permeabilized cell membranes were unable to transport p2CPY in vitro when incubated with ATP and a cytosolic extract made from a VPS33 yeast strain (data not shown). In contrast, 40% maturation of p2CPY was achieved inVPS33-permeabilized cell membranes under these same conditions (data not shown). Significant maturation of p2CPY (32%) was still observed if VPS33-permeabilized cell membranes were incubated with a cytosolic extract made from a vps33Δstrain (data not shown). From these results, measuring protein transport to the yeast vacuole, we concluded that the functional fraction of Vps33p was associated with permeabilized cell membranes and not the cytosol. Thus, we examined the fractionation of Vps33p more carefully in wild-type permeabilized cells to determine if any of the protein was associated with a particulate fraction. After a 5-min pulse with Tran35S-label, ∼80% of Vps33p cofractionated with the cytosolic marker protein, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH, Fig. 1 A lanes 1 and 2). However, during a 60-min chase, Vps33p fractionated away from the cytosolic supernatant fraction and was progressively recovered more in the permeabilized cell membrane pellet fraction (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2–14). Although this separation into a supernatant and pellet was subjected to just 13,000 × g, the Vps33p found in the supernatant continued to remain soluble after sedimentation at >125,000 × g, suggesting that it was indeed soluble. Thus, at steady state, as much as 40% of Vps33p was associated with permeabilized cell membranes in excess of the cytosolic marker G6PDH in this experiment. Subsequent analyses indicated that a more consistent value for the particulate fraction of Vps33p at steady state was 15–20% (see Figs. 2 and 6). The apparent half-time for the association of Vps33p with permeabilized cell membranes was 25–30 min (Fig. 1 A).Figure 2The effects of energy depletion are reversible and extend to the NSF homologue, Sec18p, but not to theSEC1homologue, Vps45p. A, spheroplasts from a wild-type yeast strain (SEY6210) were pulse-labeled with Tran35S-label for 15 min and chased for 30 min. They were then chased with and without 10 mm NaN3 and 10 mm NaF for 30 min, as indicated. After 30 min of energy depletion, an aliquot of cells was washed several times to remove the energy poisons and incubated for 30 min in fresh glucose medium (lanes 7 and 8). At each time point, the cells were treated under conditions that permeabilize the plasma membrane (freeze/thaw and four hypotonic washes) to generate a cytosolic fraction (S) and permeabilized cell pellet (P). Each fraction was immunoprecipitated for Vps33p and the cytosolic marker G6PDH and then sequentially for Sec18p and Vps45p. Then fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.B, spheroplasts from a wild-type yeast strain (SEY6210) were radiolabeled and fractionated as in A but immunoprecipitated for CPY. After SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, each sample was quantitated for the amount of mature CPY (mCPY), which indicated the capability for energy-dependent transport through the early secretory pathway.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 6Deletion of a putative ATP hydrolysis sequence from Vps33p abolishes photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-ATP and vacuolar protein sorting. A, a yeast strain with avps33 null allele (BGY3300) was transformed with multicopy plasmids encoding the complete VPS33 gene (WT) or a 19-amino acid deletion amino acids 661–679 (pCT202, designated 202). The cells were lysed by vigorous agitation with glass beads, and a 125,000 × g pellet was obtained. Approximately 125 μg of protein was incubated on ice with ∼40 μm8-azido-[α-32P]ATP with and without 10 mmunlabeled ATP. The samples were irradiated (1 min) twice with UV light, immunoprecipitated for Vps33p, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis. Vps33p* designates mobility of the 19-amino acid deletion mutant (202), which migrated faster on SDS-PAGE, indicative of an ∼2-kDa loss in mass. B, before fractionating the spheroplasts from the 90-min time points inA (WT) and B (202), they were harvested via centrifugation for 5 min, and the extracellular medium (E) and cell pellet (I) fractions were immunoprecipitated for the vacuolar protein CPY.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We suspected that cellular energy played a role in the association/disassociation of Vps33p with membranes. To examine this possibility, cells were treated with agents that deplete cellular ATP. Sodium azide and sodium fluoride inhibit mitochondrial respiration (31Palmer G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and glycolysis (32Maurer P.J. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6894-6900Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), respectively, and thus act to completely stop the cell from maintaining homeostatic ATP concentrations. In yeast, NaN3 and NaF are the most potent compounds for total and rapid depletion of intracellular ATP (33Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Depletion of intracellular ATP with NaN3 and NaF had a pronounced affect on the fractionation behavior of Vps33p. After a 15-min pulse with Tran35S-label, ∼85% of the newly synthesized Vps33p cofractionated with the cytosol (Fig. 1 B,lanes 1 and 2) as observed previously (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 2). However, if NaN3 and NaF (10 mm each) were added during the chase, Vps33p rapidly and completely fractionated with permeabilized cell membranes (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3–12). The apparent half-time for this association was 3–4 min, which was 8–9-fold faster than the rate observed in the absence of energy poisons in vivo (Fig. 1 B). The effect of energy depletion was most likely specific to properties associated with Vps33p, because the cytosolic enzyme, G6PDH, remained soluble throughout the course of NaN3/NaF treatment. If energy poisons were withheld from the chase, nearly 90% of the newly synthesized Vps33p remained soluble and cofractionated with G6PDH (Fig. 1 B, lanes 13 and 14). We tested whether the action of NaN3 and NaF was reversible and extended this analysis to two other proteins, Sec18p and Vps45p. The NSF homolog, Sec18p, was examined because it exists in soluble and particulate forms (34Eakle K.A. Bernstein M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4098-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) with putative ATP binding activity like mammalian NSF (35Matveeva E.A. He P. Whiteheart S.W. J. Biol.

In the lung of human collagenase transgenic mice, an emphysematous animal model, PLTP mRNA was 3-fold higher than in control mice. However, the mRNA in other tissues was not changed. To further assess the expression and function of PLTP, we measured PLTP mRNA level in lung tissue of two emphysematous patients and found that the mRNA was 4-fold higher than in control subjects. In situ hybridization on mouse lung suggested positive staining in alveolar type II epithelial cells. In addition, immortalized rat alveolar pre-type II epithelial cells and freshly isolated mature rat alveolar type II epithelial cells both highly expressed PLTP mRNA, and the former cells actively secreted PLTP activity into the medium. To examine the possible mechanisms leading to high levels of PLTP expression in vivo, we exposed the pre-type II cells to hypoxia and demonstrated induction of PLTP mRNA and a coordinate increase in secreted PLTP activity. Thus, the PLTP gene is highly expressed in alveolar type II epithelial cells and is induced during hypoxia and in emphysema.

PLTP transgenic mouse with moderate overexpression showed increased preβ-high density lipoprotein (HDL), apolipoprotein AI, and phospholipid in the apolipoprotein AI transgenic background (6Jiang X.-C.

Overexpression of PLTP using adenovirus in mice leads to increased levels of newly generated preβ-HDL, but decreased plasma HDL and enhanced hepatic uptake of phospholipids and cholesteryl esters from HDL (7Foger B.

However, aside from these processes, the physiological role of PLTP is almost unknown. In humans and mice, the lung is the dominant site expressing PLTP mRNA (8Day J.R. Albers J.J. Lofton-Day C.E. Gibert T.L. Ching A.F.T. Grant F.J. O'Hara P.J. Marcovina S.M. Adolphson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9388-9391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Jiang X.-C. Bruce C. J. Biol.

These observations suggest that PLTP might serve as an important regulator of phospholipid and lipoprotein metabolism in the lung. The alveolar system of the lung exhibits an enormous surface area, which is in contact with the environment. To maintain the integrity of this air-surface interface, the alveolar lining is composed of two types of epithelial cells, pneumocytes I and II (type I and type II), with distinct functions. Alveolar type II epithelial cells are cuboidal cells that secrete surfactant, a complex heterogeneous material comprised predominantly of the phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine (PC), and several key hydrophobic proteins, which reduce alveolar surface tension. Alveolar type I epithelial cells are elongated cells that provide the majority of the alveolar surface area (10Schmitz G. Muller G. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1539-1570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is evidence that lipoproteins can influence surfactant phospholipid metabolism in type II cells. HDL and low density lipoprotein (LDL) can stimulate primary cultures of type II cells to secrete PC (11Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Dobbs L.G. Erickson S.K. Hamilton R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4256-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) stimulate surfactant lipid synthesis in immortalized or primary rat alveolar pre-type II epithelial cells (12Mallampalli R.K. Salome R.G. Bowen S.L. Chappell D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2020-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because PLTP is highly expressed in the lung, and regulates lipoprotein metabolism, it is conceivable that this protein might play a role in surfactant metabolism. Chronic bronchitis, asthma, and emphysema are chronic obstructive lung diseases associated with disturbance of the surfactant system (13Highenbottam T. Eur. J. Respir. Dis. 1987; 71: 222-228Google Scholar, 14Mason R.J. Eur. J. Respir. Dis. 1987; 71: 229-236Google Scholar). Cigarette smoking, the major contributor to chronic obstructive lung disease, reduces the amount of surfactant on the alveolar surface (15Finlay T.N. Ladman A.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1972; 286: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) but increases the numbers of alveolar type II epithelial cells (16Barlow Y. Lamb D. Thorax. 1985; 40 (abstr.): 214Google Scholar). Surfactant deficiency leads to atelectasis and thus may contribute to hypoxia and hypercapnia observed in chronic lung disease (17Avery E.M. Mead J. Am. J. Dis. Child. 1959; 97: 517-523PubMed Google Scholar, 18Strang L.R. Neonatal Respiration. Blackwell Publishers, Oxford, UK1977: 181Google Scholar). Further, gas-exchange abnormalities such as hypoxia have been observed to alter surfactant metabolism in human lung tissue (19Walmrath D. Gunther A. Ghofrani H.A. Schermuly R. Schneider T. Grimminger F. Seeger W. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 154: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the investigational use of surfactant replacement therapy in chronic obstructive lung disease. For example, high-dose bovine surfactant treatment in very premature infants greatly reduces mortality and incidence of pulmonary interstitial emphysema (20Fujiwara T. Maeta H. Chida S. Morita T. Watabe Y. Abe T. Lancet. 1980; I: 55-59Abstract Scopus (651) Google Scholar) and may be beneficial in asthma (21Kurashima K. Fujimura M. Tsujiura M. Matsuda T. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1997; 27: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Both emphysema and asthma are associated with elevated HDL levels (22Tisi G.M. Conrique A. Barrett-Connor E. Grundy S.M. Metabolism. 1981; 30: 340-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Shenoi A. Kumar L. Sarihyan S. Gangully N.K. Acta Paediatr. 1992; 81: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Human collagenase transgenic mice express the transgene in their lungs under the direction of the haptoglobin promoter. Histological analysis demonstrated disruption of the alveolar walls and coalescence of the alveolar spaces with no evidence of fibrosis or inflammation (24D'Armiento J. Dalal S. Okada Y. Berg R.A. Chada K. Cell. 1992; 71: 955-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). This pathology is strikingly similar to the morphological changes observed in human emphysema (24D'Armiento J. Dalal S. Okada Y. Berg R.A. Chada K. Cell. 1992; 71: 955-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) and therefore implicates interstitial collagenase as a possible etiological agent in the disease process. The close association between chronic obstructive lung disease and surfactant deficiency together with high levels of PLTP in the lung led us to investigate whether PLTP expression would be altered in emphysematous lung and if PLTP mRNA is regulated by hypoxia. Tissue culture media and reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum was obtained from HyClone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Cholesterol and phospholipid measurement kits were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). All other chemicals were from Sigma. Human lung samples were obtained from two patients undergoing lung transplantation (IRB# X042 1) at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center and from a normal nonsmoking human as a control. The major etiological factor for emphysema in the patients was cigarette smoking. Lung samples were also obtained from transgenic mice that were shown to develop emphysema secondary to increased collagenase expression within their lung (24D'Armiento J. Dalal S. Okada Y. Berg R.A.

Total RNA was prepared from fresh tissue using the guanidinium thiocyanate-cesium chloride method as described previously. The total RNA was finally resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, and the absorbance was read at A 260 andA 280. The quality of the RNA was checked on a 1.2% denaturing agarose gel to ensure the presence of the 28 S and 18 S ribosomal bands. For PLTP mRNA Northern blot, total RNA (20 μg) from emphysematous patients and control was analyzed for PLTP mRNA as described previously (9Jiang X.-C. Bruce C. J. Biol.

The assay was performed as described previously (9Jiang X.-C. Bruce C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17133-17138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For mouse lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) mRNA assay, a fragment of the mouse LBP cDNA (220 base pairs, 3′-untranslated region, 1581–1800) was cloned into Bluescript KS+ (Stratagene) and used to prepare radiolabeled cRNA probes for all of the RNase protection assays. The assay was performed as described previously (9Jiang X.-C. Bruce C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17133-17138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). 3 μl of plasma or 20 μl of the cell medium (10-fold concentrated from original) from immortalized rat fetal alveolar pre-type II epithelial cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with radiolabeled liposomes (25 μl) and isolated human HDL3 (250 μg of protein) in a final volume of 400 μl. Following incubation, phospholipid liposomes were selectively precipitated and radioactivity in the supernatant was measured. PLTP activity was expressed as the rate of total radiolabeled phospholipids transferred from radiolabeled liposomes to the HDL3. For small volumes of mouse plasma, HDL was separated from apoB-containing lipoproteins by using a HDL cholesterol reagent (Sigma). Using this method, an insignificant amount of mouse apoAI is precipitated (25Walsh A. Ito Y. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6488-6494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The total cholesterol and phospholipids in plasma and HDL were assayed by enzymatic methods (Wako). The cRNA probes were produced from a 666-base pair mouse PLTP cDNA subcloned into pBluescript. T7 and T3 promoters flanking the cDNA fragment were used to make the sense and antisense cRNA probe by in vitro transcription. Riboprobes were labeled with digoxigenin 11-UTP according to the protocol of Boehringer Mannheim. Nonisotopic in situhybridization was performed using a modification of the manufacturer's protocol as described previously (26Wang N. Tabas I. Winchester R. Ravalli S. Rabbani L.E. Tall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8837-8842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Immortalized rat fetal alveolar pre-type II epithelial cells were generated by infection with a retroviral construct expressing the adenoviral 12 S E1A gene product (27Mallampalli R.K. Flowechinger C.S. Hunninghake G.W. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1992; 28A: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the current studies, we used cells that have undergone about 110 passages. Cells were maintained in Waymouth's 752/1 medium with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in atmosphere containing 5% CO2. After reaching confluence, the cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin with 0.1% EDTA and plated onto 100-mm tissue culture dishes (2 × 106 cells/dish). After incubation overnight (95–100% confluence), the cells were divided into two groups, one group was incubated continuously for 6, 12, and 24 h, the other group was incubated under hypoxia for 6, 12, and 24 h. The cells were subjected to hypoxia by placing them in an environmental chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Ann Arbor, MI), which provided a controlled temperature (37 °C) and atmosphere with the indicated amount of O2 and CO2 (5%) and the balance made up of N2 (28Shreeniwas R. Koga S. Karakurum M. Pinsky D. Kaiser E. Brett J. Wolitzky B. Norton C. Plocinski J. Benjamin W. Burns D. Goldstein A. Stern D. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2333-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Use of this chamber for cell culture has been described previously (28Shreeniwas R. Koga S. Karakurum M. Pinsky D. Kaiser E.

The pH of the medium remained unchanged throughout the experiments; pO2 in the medium was ≈12–15 torr (oxygen was leached continuously from the tissue culture plasticware during the course of the experiments). At different time points, cell media were collected for PLTP activity assays, and the cells were collected for total RNA extraction. The mature rat alveolar type II cells were isolated as described previously (29Longo C.A. Tyler D. Mallampalli R.K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The yield of cells was approximately 40 × 106 cells and viability was >95% as determined by trypan blue exclusion. Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. The statistical significance of the differences between the groups was estimated by the Student's t test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. PLTP mRNA, as determined by the RNase protection assay, in the lung of human collagenase transgenic mice (an emphysematous animal model) (24D'Armiento J. Dalal S. Okada Y. Berg R.A. Chada K. Cell. 1992; 71: 955-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) was found to be significantly higher than that of control (303 ± 16% versus 100 ± 30%, p< 0.0001), whereas other tissues studied did not show any changes (Fig. 1). As a control we also measured the mRNA level of LBP, which belongs to the same gene family as PLTP, in the lung and liver of the transgenic mice, and we did not find changes in these two tissues (Fig. 2). Northern blot analysis demonstrated that PLTP mRNA level in the lung of two emphysematous patients was much higher than that of a nonsmoking control (Fig. 3). The results suggest an effect of emphysema on PLTP gene expression in the lung.Figure 2RNase protection analysis for LBP mRNA in lung and liver from human collagenase transgenic and control mice.30 μg of total RNA was used for the RNase protection assay.

Total RNA (20 μg) from emphysematous patient and control was used for Northern blots probed with PLTP cDNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We exposed the x-ray film for three days to obtain the PLTP mRNA signal, then the signal was scripted away from the membrane and reprobed with actin cDNA probe. The actin mRNA signal was obtained after 12 h of exposure. This result is a representative of two similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Despite significant differences in PLTP mRNA expression between normal and emphysematous lung, plasma PLTP activity and total plasma cholesterol, phospholipids, HDL cholesterol, and HDL phospholipids did not demonstrate significant differences between emphysematous and control mice (Table I), suggesting the possibility that the effects of elevated PLTP expression were restricted to the lung.Table IPlasma lipids in human collagenase transgenic and wild type miceMiceTotal cholesterolPhospholipidHDL cholesterolHDL phospholipidmg/dlTransgenic77 ± 12166 ± 2161 ± 6139 ± 19Control82 ± 16181 ± 3166 ± 9150 ± 22HDL was separated from VLDL + LDL by using HDL cholesterol reagent (Sigma).

To determine which cell types were expressing PLTP mRNA, mouse lung tissue was analyzed by in situ hybridization, using a mouse cRNA probe that was labeled with digoxigenin 11-UTP. The positive signal was visualized as dark blue. The sections were also counterstained with hematoxylin, and nuclei were stained as green. As shown in Fig. 4 A, scattered cuboidal cells lining alveoli (a) stained intensely with a dark blue color (long arrows), whereas in the sense cRNA control, dark blue staining of cells was not detected (Fig. 4 B). These data are highly suggestive that type II cells express PLTP and might regulate PLTP production. Without suitable markers, however, we cannot exclude the possibility that PLTP is also expressed in cells other than type II cells. In this regard, positive staining was also occasionally observed in cells with flat morphology surrounding the terminal airways (short arrows), suggestive of expression of the protein in reserve cells (Fig. 4 A). To investigate whether alveolar type II epithelial cells are a site for PLTP gene expression, we measured the PLTP mRNA in mature rat type II alveolar epithelial cells as well as lung, liver, heart, kidney, and small intestine (Fig. 5). Similar to findings in the human and mouse (8Day J.R. Albers J.J. Lofton-Day C.E. Gibert T.L. Ching A.F.T. Grant F.J. O'Hara P.J. Marcovina S.M. Adolphson J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17133-17138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), rat lung is also a major site for PLTP mRNA expression. In addition, PLTP mRNA was detected at high levels in rat liver. As shown in Fig. 5, PLTP was expressed in type II cells, and the amount of the mRNA in mature type II cells was comparable with that of liver. To further confirm that type II cells are responsible for PLTP gene expression, we measured PLTP mRNA in rat immortalized pre-type II alveolar epithelial cells and found that these cells also express the transcript (Fig. 5). Moreover, PLTP was secreted by the immortalized cells, because PLTP activity in the cell culture medium gradually increased with time during the incubation (Fig. 6). To examine the possible mechanisms leading to induction of PLTP in the emphysematous lungs, we exposed immortalized rat alveolar pre-type II cells to hypoxia. We hypothesized that a hypoxic stimulus existing in emphysematous lung might induce expression of PLTP similar to other genes (30Guillemin K. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1997; 81: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (422) Google Scholar). We observed that during the 24-h period of hypoxia, the type II cells secreted significantly more PLTP into the medium (Fig. 6) and expressed more PLTP mRNA (Fig. 7) than control cells. As a positive control, we measured the mRNA level of HIF-I in the type II cells and found the induction of HIF-I mRNA during the process of hypoxia (Fig. 8).Figure 8Effect of hypoxia on the HIF-I mRNA in immortalized rat alveolar pre-type II epithelial cells. The immortalized pre-type II cells (2 × 106 cells/dish) were exposed to hypoxia at various timepoints, see “Experimental Procedures” for details. The cells were collected at each time point for HIF-I mRNA Northern blot analysis using a monkey HIF-I cDNA as probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In this study, we demonstrate that the PLTP mRNA is up-regulated in emphysematous lungs but not in other tissues studied, and PLTP is highly expressed in primary and immortalized rat alveolar type II epithelial cells. The induction of mRNA level in emphysematous lung is specific for PLTP, because the mRNA level of LBP, another member of the gene family, did not show changes. Under conditions of hypoxia, immortalized rat alveolar type II epithelial cells exhibit induction of the PLTP mRNA with an increase in PLTP activity in the cell medium. Collectively, these observations suggest that hypoxia, resulting from alveolar-capillary destruction in emphysematous lungs, serves as an important stimulus for PLTP expression in the lung. The widespread distribution of PLTP mRNA in peripheral tissue suggests that PLTP may play a key role in regulating extracellular phospholipid and lipoprotein metabolism (8Day J.R. Albers J.J. Lofton-Day C.E. Gibert T.L. Ching A.F.T. Grant F.J. O'Hara P.J. Marcovina S.M. Adolphson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9388-9391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Jiang X.-C. Bruce C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17133-17138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this study, PLTP gene expression appears to be markedly increased in murine emphysematous lung without a change in plasma lipoprotein levels. In cultured alveolar type II cells, however, PLTP mRNA was induced by hypoxia, leading to an increase in the secretion of PLTP activity in medium. These results suggest that a hypoxic driving force increases PLTP in emphysema, but effects on lipid metabolism may be restricted to the lung. Although we did not directly test the hypothesis, it is tempting to speculate that this increase in local PLTP activity could play a role in regulating alveolar surfactant metabolism. Alternatively, induction of PLTP expression might simply be a consequence of surfactant deficiency which leads to microatelectasis and attendant hypoxia in chronic obstructive lung disease. The emphysematous patients used in this study were smoking-related. Cigarette smoking reduces the amount of surfactant on the alveolar surface (15Finlay T.N. Ladman A.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1972; 286: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) but has been shown to increase the number of alveolar type II epithelial cells (16Barlow Y. Lamb D. Thorax. 1985; 40 (abstr.): 214Google Scholar). We speculate that type II cell hyperplasia could also stimulate PLTP production to transport more surfactant to the alveolar membrane to rescue the pathological damage characteristic of emphysema. How might the PLTP work locally? On the one hand, it has been reported that injecting partially purified PLTP increases the turnover rate of [3H]phosphatidylcholine ether-labeled HDL by 50%, suggesting that the PLTP could facilitate transfer of radiolabeled phospholipids from HDL to tissues or facilitate the uptake of HDL particles by tissues (31Pownall H.J. Hickson-Bick D. Massey J.B. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 793-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, one of the main sites of uptake of [3H]phosphatidylcholine ether-labeled HDL is the lung (31Pownall H.J. Hickson-Bick D. Massey J.B. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 793-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, PLTP is able to transfer phospholipids from artificial vesicles to HDL (1Tall A.R. Abreu E. Shuman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2174-2180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PLTP could conceivably facilitate uptake of surfactant lipids that are secreted by type II cells or released by HDL into the lung interstitial fluid compartment and ultimately targeted for deposition into the alveolar membrane. Thus, PLTP might play an integral role in surfactant lipid trafficking and reutilization in type II alveolar epithelial cells. The induction of PLTP mRNA in murine and human emphysematous lung and in alveolar type II cells suggests that hypoxia may be an important stimulus for induction of PLTP gene expression. In human emphysematous lung, however, there may also be a strong inflammatory component, suggesting a possible role of local cytokines. In the mouse model the inflammatory component is minimal. Moreover, after endotoxin injection, PLTP mRNA was decreased in mice (9Jiang X.-C. Bruce C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17133-17138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, although we cannot rule out a role for other stimuli, our data suggests that hypoxia is likely to be a major stimulus for PLTP gene induction in the emphysematous lung. A number of genes are known to be induced by hypoxia (30Guillemin K. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1997; 81: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (422) Google Scholar), and the mechanism may be either increased transcription or mRNA stability. It is known that hypoxic effects are involved in a variety of cellular and global responses including anaerobic metabolism, erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, and breathing (32Galson D.L. Tsuchiya T. Tendler D.S. Huang L.E. Ren Y. Ogura T. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2135-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), which allow the cell to survive at low oxygen tension and help restore the cell to normal levels. We demonstrated in this study that gene(s), like PLTP, which are involved in lipid metabolism can also be regulated by hypoxia. Although there are no hypoxia consensus response elements, HIF-1 (30Guillemin K. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1997; 81: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (422) Google Scholar), existing either in the promoter or 3′-end flanking regions of the PLTP gene, 2X.-C. Jiang and A.

https://openalex.org/W2025182244,"In tomato plants, resistance to bacterial speck disease is mediated by a phosphorylation cascade, which is triggered by the specific recognition between the plant serine/threonine protein kinase Pto and the bacterial AvrPto protein. In the present study, we investigated in vitro biochemical properties of Pto, which appears to function as an intracellular receptor for the AvrPto signal molecule. Pto and its downstream effector Pti1, which is also a serine/threonine protein kinase, were expressed in Escherichia coli as maltose-binding protein and glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins, respectively. The two kinases each autophosphorylated at multiple sites as determined by phosphopeptide mapping. In addition, Pto and Pti1 autophosphorylation occurred via an intramolecular mechanism, as their specific activity was not affected by their molar concentration in the assay. Moreover, an active glutathioneS-transferase-Pto fusion failed to phosphorylate an inactive maltose-binding protein-Pto(K69Q) fusion excluding an intermolecular mechanism of phosphorylation for Pto. Pti1 phosphorylation by Pto was also characterized and found to occur with aK m of 4.1 μm at sites similar to those autophosphorylated by Pti1. Pto and the product of the recessive allele pto phosphorylated Pti1 at similar sites, as observed by phosphopeptide mapping. This suggests that the inability of the kinase pto to confer resistance to bacterial speck disease in tomato is not caused by altered recognition specificity for Pti1 phosphorylation sites. In tomato plants, resistance to bacterial speck disease is mediated by a phosphorylation cascade, which is triggered by the specific recognition between the plant serine/threonine protein kinase Pto and the bacterial AvrPto protein. In the present study, we investigated in vitro biochemical properties of Pto, which appears to function as an intracellular receptor for the AvrPto signal molecule.

This suggests that the inability of the kinase pto to confer resistance to bacterial speck disease in tomato is not caused by altered recognition specificity for Pti1 phosphorylation sites. Higher plants have evolved the ability to recognize and resist invading pathogens by the activation of defense mechanisms that inhibit pathogen growth and movement in the plant (1Hammond-Kosack K.E. Jones J.D.G. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1773-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar). In many plant-pathogen interactions, the rapid activation of the defense response is mediated by a specific recognition event involving the product of an avirulence (avr) 1The abbreviations used are: avr, avirulance gene; MBP, maltose-binding protein; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; R, resistance gene; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase. gene in the pathogen and the corresponding resistance (R) gene in the plant (2Flor H.H. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1971; 9: 275-296Crossref Google Scholar). Proteins encoded by R genes are postulated to function as receptors that bind the cognate avr gene product and activate defense mechanisms. Several R genes have been isolated to date, and structural characteristics of their encoded proteins support the proposed receptor function (3Baker B. Zambryski P. Staskawicz B. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Science. 1997; 276: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Most Rgenes encode cytoplasmic or transmembrane proteins containing a region of leucine-rich repeats of variable length and content, which might be involved in protein-protein interactions (4Jones D.A. Jones J.D.G. Adv. Bot. Res. Incorp. Adv. Plant Path. 1997; 24: 89-167Crossref Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Some leucine-rich repeat-containing R proteins, including those encoded by the tobaccoN, the flax L6, and the Arabidopsis RPP5 genes, also contain a region of homology with the cytoplasmic domains of the Drosophila Toll and the mammalian interleukin-1 receptor proteins (4Jones D.A. Jones J.D.G. Adv. Bot. Res. Incorp. Adv. Plant Path. 1997; 24: 89-167Crossref Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Another class of R genes is represented by Pto, which encodes a tomato serine/threonine protein kinase and confers resistance specifically to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato expressing the avirulence geneavrPto (5Martin G.B. Brommonschenkel S. Chunwongse J. Frary A. Ganal M.W. Spivey R. Wu T. Earle E.D. Tanksley S.D. Science. 1993; 262: 1432-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Pto does not share motifs with other resistance genes, except for the kinase domain, which is also present in the product of the rice gene Xa21, conferring resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (6Song W.-Y. Wang G.-L. Chen L.-L. Kim H.-S. Pi L.-Y. Holsten T. Gardner J. Wang B. Zhai W.-X. Zhu L.-H. Fauquet C. Ronald P. Science. 1995; 270: 1804-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown, using the yeast two-hybrid system, that a direct interaction occurs between the product of the tomatoPto resistance gene and the product of the P. syringae pv. tomato avrPto gene (7Tang X. Frederick R.D. Zhou J. Halterman D.A. Jia Y. Martin G.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2060-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 8Scofield S.R. Tobias C.M. Rathjen J. Chang J.H. Lavelle D.T. Michelmore R.W. Staskawicz B.J. Science. 1996; 274: 2063-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Mutations of Pto or AvrPto that interfere with this interaction in yeast also abolish disease resistance in plants. In addition, for resistance to take place, Pto and AvrPto must be present simultaneously inside the plant cell, strongly suggesting that the Pto-AvrPto recognition is an intracellular event. AvrPto and other bacterial avr gene products are thought to be delivered into the plant cell by a type III secretion system encoded by the bacterial pathogen (9Van den Ackerveken G. Bonas U. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 394-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In fact, a set of genes in P. syringae shows similarity to genes encoding components of the type III secretion system of mammalian pathogens, and is required both for resistance and pathogenicity (10Alfano J.R. Colmer A. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1683-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The recognition event between the tomato Pto kinase and the bacterial AvrPto protein initiates a signal transduction pathway that involves downstream effectors and ultimately leads to disease resistance. ThePrf gene is required for Pto-mediated resistance and encodes a protein with a leucine zipper, a nucleotide binding site, and leucine-rich repeats, common motifs in other resistance gene products (11Salmeron J.M. Oldroyd G.E.D. Rommens C.M.T. Scofield S.R. Kim H.-S. Lavelle D.T. Dahlbeck D. Staskawicz B.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). However, the role of Prf in the Pto pathway remains unclear. Other putative effectors were identified by their specific interaction with the Pto kinase in the yeast two-hybrid system (12Zhou J. Loh Y.-T. Bressan R.A. Martin G.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 925-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 13Zhou J. Tang X. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3207-3218Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Among them are Pti1, a serine/threonine protein kinase that is specifically phosphorylated in vitro by Pto and is involved in the hypersensitive response (12Zhou J. Loh Y.-T. Bressan R.A. Martin G.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 925-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), and Pti4, Pti5, and Pti6, putative transcription factors that are similar to the tobacco ethylene-responsive element-binding proteins (13Zhou J. Tang X. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3207-3218Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 14Ohme-Takagi M. Shinshi H. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). In mammals, autophosphorylation activity plays a central role in the regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (15Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). Hormones, or growth and differentiation factors, bind to receptors with tyrosine kinase activity and induce conformational alterations in the receptor extracellular domains causing oligomerization. Autophosphorylation by intermolecular phosphorylation in the receptor cytoplasmic domain then takes place and modulates the interaction between the activated receptor and cellular proteins (16Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar). Induction of autophosphorylation activity by extracellular signals has also been observed in cytoplasmic protein kinases associated with receptors. For instance, autophosphorylation of the Janus kinases is activated by cytokines through cytokine receptors (17Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar), and components of the extracellular matrix determine the integrin-mediated activation of autophosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase FAK (18Kornberg L. Earp H.S. Parsons J.T. Schaller M. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23439-23442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the tomato Pto serine/threonine protein kinase is thought to function as an intracellular receptor or as part of a receptor complex for the AvrPto signal molecule, we were interested in determining the role of Pto autophosphorylation activity in the elicitation of the defense response by the Pto-AvrPto interaction. As a step toward testing the possibility that AvrPto mediates Pto dimerization and activation by intermolecular autophosphorylation, we characterized the biochemical properties of Pto autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of its putative effector Pti1. Pto and Pti1 were expressed inEscherichia coli as fusion proteins and assayed for their kinase activities. Pto and Pti1 autophosphorylated at multiple sites, and their autophosphorylation proceeded via an intramolecular mechanism. We also determined the kinetics of Pti1 phosphorylation by Pto and compared the tryptic digests of Pti1 phosphorylated by Pto and by the product of the recessive pto allele. For expression in bacteria, the Pto protein kinase and its mutagenized kinase-deficient form Pto(K69Q) were fused in frame to the C terminus of the maltose-binding protein (MBP), as described previously (19Loh Y.-T. Martin G.B. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 1735-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The Pto protein was also expressed as a fusion to the C terminus of glutathioneS-transferase (GST). To develop the GST-Pto fusion, primers YTL8 (5′-ATGGGATCCAAGTATTCTAAGGCA-3′) and YTL5 (5′-CCCTGCAGTGAAAGAAGGATCCACAG-3′) were used to amplify a 1,057-base pair product encoding Pto from plasmid PTC3 (8Scofield S.R. Tobias C.M. Rathjen J. Chang J.H. Lavelle D.T. Michelmore R.W. Staskawicz B.J. Science. 1996; 274: 2063-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Primer YTL8 introduced a BamHI restriction site at the N terminus of thePto gene, and primer YTL5 amplified a BamHI restriction site 70 base pairs after the TAA stop codon. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested by BamHI and inserted into vector pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at the corresponding site. The constructs for expression of the kinase encoded by the recessive pto allele as a MBP fusion, and of the Pti1 protein kinase and its mutagenized form Pti1(K96N) as GST fusions, were prepared as described previously (12Zhou J. Loh Y.-T. Bressan R.A. Martin G.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 925-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 20Jia Y. Loh Y.-T. Zhou J. Martin G.B. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 61-73PubMed Google Scholar). MBP and GST fusions were expressed in the E. coli strain PR745 (New England Biolabs) and affinity-purified by using amylose resin (New England Biolabs) and glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma), respectively. Autophosphorylation activity of MBP-Pto and GST-Pti1 fusion proteins was assayed at different protein concentrations in 25 μl of reaction buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmMnCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20 μm ATP), containing 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Reactions were incubated for 15 min at room temperature and spotted on phosphocellulose P-81 filters (Whatman). The filters were extensively washed by three changes of 150 mm phosphoric acid, and by a final wash with ethanol. Phosphate incorporation was then measured using a scintillation counter (LS 6500, Beckman). The range of concentrations tested was from 0.72 to 17.9 μm and from 0.06 to 8.61 μm for MBP-Pto and GST-Pti1, respectively. Reactions containing the highest amount of enzyme were found to be linear over the entire reaction time (15 min). Assays to test Pto intermolecular autophosphorylation were performed with the GST-Pto fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and the other components dissolved in solution. GST-Pto fusion protein (2 μg) was mixed with MBP-Pto(K69Q) or GST-Pti1(K96N) fusion proteins (2 μg) in 30 μl of reaction buffer (described above), containing 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Reactions were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm. Proteins were then fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. The stained gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. To determine V max and K mvalues of the MBP-Pto fusion for its substrate GST-Pti1(K96N) fusion protein, 0.5 μg of MBP-Pto was incubated at room temperature with different amounts of GST-Pti1(K96N) in 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The range of GST-Pti1(K96N) concentrations tested was from 0.72 to 17.9 μm. Reactions were stopped after 10 min by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm. At this reaction time, phosphate incorporation was found to be linear for the highest substrate concentration used in the experiment. Proteins were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE, stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250, and analyzed by Instant Imager (Packard Corp.). Values for the V max andK m parameters were estimated by nonlinear least squares fitting using SigmaPlot 4.0 for Windows software (SPSS Inc.). The procedure used for phosphopeptide analysis was essentially as described by Van der Geeret al. (21Van Der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1993: 31-59Google Scholar) with some modifications. The phosphorylated protein to be analyzed was fractionated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the corresponding piece of membrane was excised. After blocking with 100 mm acetic acid containing 0.5% polyvinyl pyrrolidone for 30 min, the membrane was extensively washed with water and twice with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.2. The membrane-bound protein was then incubated in 200 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.2, with 10 μg ofN-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin for at least 4 h at 37 °C. The sample was lyophilized to dryness and oxidized by performic acid for 60 min at room temperature. After water dilution and evaporation of performic acid in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator, the sample was resuspended in electrophoresis buffer containing n-butanol, pyridine, acetic acid, and water at a ratio of 2:1:1:36, and separated for 40 min by thin layer electrophoresis at pH 4.7 and 1.0 kV on 20 × 20-cm cellulose TLC plates (EM Science). The first dimension fractionation was followed by ascending chromatography in phosphopeptide buffer containing n-butanol, pyridine, acetic acid, and water at a ratio of 15:10:3:12. After electrophoresis, the radioactive species were detected by autoradiography. Phosphopeptides were electrophoretically separated on alkaline 40% polyacrylamide gels as described by Dadd et al. (22Dadd C.A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 266-273PubMed Google Scholar). The Pto and Pti1 proteins are involved in resistance to bacterial speck disease in tomato plants and have been shown previously to be active serine/threonine kinases when tested in vitro(12Zhou J. Loh Y.-T. Bressan R.A. Martin G.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 925-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 19Loh Y.-T. Martin G.B. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 1735-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To further characterize their kinase activity, we tested whether Pto and Pti1 autophosphorylation mechanisms are intramolecular (first order with respect to enzyme concentration) or intermolecular (second order with respect to enzyme concentration). Pto and Pti1 were expressed in bacteria as MBP (MBP-Pto) and GST (GST-Pti1) fusion proteins, respectively, and the effect of various molar concentrations on the autophosphorylation reaction was studied. As shown in Figs. 1 A and 2 A, the rate of autophosphorylation was linear with respect to enzyme concentration for both MBP-Pto and GST-Pti1. In addition, the phosphate incorporation per molecule was constant when MBP-Pto concentration in the reaction varied by 60-fold (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, the phosphate incorporation per GST-Pti1 molecule varied by only 1.7 when the enzyme concentration in the reaction varied by 140-fold (Fig. 2 B). Finally, the van't Hoff plot of autophosphorylation (logarithm of phosphorylation rateversus logarithm of enzyme concentration), whose slope indicates the order of the reaction, had a slope of 1.11 ± 0.038 and 0.90 ± 0.010 for MBP-Pto and GST-Pti1, respectively (Figs. 1 C and 2 C). Taken together, these data indicate that both MBP-Pto and GST-Pti1 autophosphorylation occur predominantly via an intramolecular mechanism.Figure 2Effect of enzyme concentration on the autophosphorylation of GST-Pti1 fusion protein.Autophosphorylation activity of GST-Pti1 was tested at different enzyme concentrations in an in vitro kinase assay.

(n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To provide further evidence for intramolecular autophosphorylation by Pto, we tested if an active GST-Pto fusion protein can phosphorylate an inactive MBP-Pto molecule in which the invariant lysine residue in kinase subdomain II was substituted by a glutamine (19Loh Y.-T. Martin G.B. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 1735-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the GST-Pto fusion protein was able to autophosphorylate and to phosphorylate its substrate Pti1 as observed previously (12Zhou J. Loh Y.-T. Bressan R.A. Martin G.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 925-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). However, it failed to phosphorylate the inactive mutant protein MBP-Pto(K69Q), strongly supporting the notion that Pto autophosphorylation occurs through an intramolecular rather than intermolecular mechanism. The Pti1 protein kinase was shown previously to be specifically phosphorylatedin vitro by the Pto protein kinase (12Zhou J. Loh Y.-T. Bressan R.A. Martin G.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 925-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). To study the kinetics of this reaction, the initial velocity of the phosphorylation of a kinase-deficient mutant GST-Pti1(K96N) by Pto-MBP was analyzed at different substrate concentrations (Fig. 4). Nonlinear least squares fitting analysis of the data estimated K m andV max values for the GST-Pti1(K96N) substrate as 4.1 ± 0.6 μm and 0.55 ± 0.03 nmol/min/mg, respectively. To investigate Pto and Pti1 autophosphorylation sites in more detail, MBP-Pto and GST-Pti1 fusion proteins were autophosphorylated in vitroand digested with trypsin. The tryptic digests were resolved horizontally by thin layer electrophoresis at pH 4.7, and vertically by ascending chromatography. As shown in Fig. 5, both digestion of autophosphorylated MBP-Pto and GST-Pti1 generated one major and at least four minor phosphopeptides (Fig. 5, A and B). The ratio between the intensity of the major spot and minor spots was at least 5:1 for MBP-Pto digests, and 50:1 for GST-Pti1 digests. The variable intensity of the labeling might be a result of the degree of enzyme affinity for different sites and to the number of phosphorylation sites present in each peptide. Additional phosphopeptides were detectable after extensive exposures of the TLC plates to x-ray films and may indicate either the presence of sites in the proteins phosphorylated at a very low efficiency or, more likely, partial tryptic digestion products. It has been shown recently that Pti1 is a substrate not only for the Pto kinase, but also for the translation product of the recessive allele pto, which is a functional protein kinase but does not confer bacterial speck resistance to tomato plants (20Jia Y. Loh Y.-T. Zhou J. Martin G.B. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 61-73PubMed Google Scholar). To compare the Pti1 autophosphorylation sites to those phosphorylated by Pto or pto, the kinase-deficient mutant GST-Pti1(K96N) was phosphorylated by an MBP-Pto or MBP-pto fusion proteins and then digested by trypsin. Phosphopeptide maps of the Pti1 digestion products revealed the presence of one major phosphorylated peptide, similar to that observed in Pti1 autophosphorylation reactions (Fig. 5, B–D). To test whether this major spot was derived from the same peptide phosphorylated by Pti1 autophosphorylation and by Pto and recessive pto phosphorylation, tryptic digests from the three reactions were fractionated by alkaline electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 6, the main phosphorylated peptide in all the reactions showed the same molecular weight and charge characteristics, suggesting that the same phosphorylation site(s) may be utilized by the three enzymes. Similar minor spots were observed in the phosphotryptic maps of autophosphorylated Pti1 and of Pti1 phosphorylated by Pto or recessive pto (Fig. 5,B–D). Their intensity was variable in different experiments, and analysis of their sequence will be required to determine whether they represent phosphorylation sites, degradation products, or partial digests of the main phosphorylated peptide. In this report, we characterized biochemical properties of two tomato serine/threonine protein kinases, Pto and Pti1, which are involved in the signaling pathway leading to resistance to the bacterial pathogen P. syringae pv. tomato expressing theavrPto gene. A specific recognition between the Pto kinase and the bacterial AvrPto protein occurs within the plant cell and triggers the activation of the pathway, defining the Pto kinase as an intracellular receptor or as part of a receptor complex (7Tang X. Frederick R.D. Zhou J. Halterman D.A. Jia Y. Martin G.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2060-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 8Scofield S.R. Tobias C.M. Rathjen J. Chang J.H. Lavelle D.T. Michelmore R.W. Staskawicz B.J. Science. 1996; 274: 2063-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms taking place in this interaction and the role of autophosphorylation in Pto kinase activation, we first examined the molecular characteristics of Pto autophosphorylation in vitro. We found that Pto autophosphorylates at several sites in the protein via an intramolecular process that is not affected by protein concentration. Induction of autophosphorylation activity by extracellular signals is well documented in mammals for receptors with tyrosine kinase activity (23Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 459-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to the extracellular domain of receptor tyrosine kinases induces receptor dimerization. Dimerization in turn activates autophosphorylation of the receptor catalytic domain, which is mediated by an intermolecular mechanism of phosphorylation. Dimerization and intermolecular autophosphorylation of a nuclear serine/threonine kinase from Arabidopsis thaliana have been shown recently (24Roe J.L. Durfee T. Zupan J.R. Repetti P.P. McLean B.G. Zambryski P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5838-5845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of activation for this protein kinase, essential for leaf and flower morphogenesis, is still unknown. In order to determine whether Pto dimerization and activation is plausible in the interaction between the signal molecule AvrPto and the Pto kinase, we tested in vitro the mechanism of Pto autophosphorylation. We found that Pto autophosphorylation occurs via an intramolecular reaction, making it unlikely that oligomerization is required for Pto activation. Alternative modes of activation remain to be tested to elucidate the molecular mechanisms taking place during the Pto-AvrPto interaction. It is possible that AvrPto might activate Pto by causing conformational changes that possibly expose certain domains, which were not available previously, to autophosphorylation or to phosphorylation by an additional protein kinase. Such a mechanism occurs during activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) by cyclins (25Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar). The activity of CDK2, for example, which is involved in regulation of events in the eukaryotic cell cycle, is stimulated by a two-step mechanism of activation. First, the regulatory subunit cyclin A associates with CDK2, causing conformational changes in the kinase catalytic sites that make Thr-160 more accessible for phosphorylation by the CDK-activating kinase. Second, CDK-activating kinase phosphorylation of Thr-160 determines full activation of CDK2 (26Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Even in such a scenario, autophosphorylation activity of Pto still may represent a prerequisite for the interaction with AvrPto. In fact, it has been observed that forms of Pto mutated in residues essential for kinase activity do not interact with AvrPto in the two-hybrid system (7Tang X. Frederick R.D. Zhou J. Halterman D.A. Jia Y. Martin G.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2060-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 8Scofield S.R. Tobias C.M. Rathjen J. Chang J.H. Lavelle D.T. Michelmore R.W. Staskawicz B.J. Science. 1996; 274: 2063-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The requirement of a phosphorylated residue for the interaction between a protein kinase and a regulatory subunit has been observed for the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (27Levin L.R. Zoller M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1066-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase requires phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue for the interaction with an associated regulatory subunit which represses its activity. Similarly, theArabidopsis serine/threonine receptor kinase RLK5 interactsin vitro with the KAPP type 2C protein phosphatase only in its autophosphorylated form (28Stone J.M. Collinge M.A. Smith R.D. Horn M.A. Walker J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 793-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In order to define the role of Pto autophosphorylation in vivo, it will be necessary to identify the residues that are phosphorylated and examine the importance of these sites on the ability of Pto to confer disease resistance. In several instances, it has been shown that sites phosphorylated in vitro by autophosphorylation or cross-phosphorylation mechanisms are also phosphorylated in vivo (29Cheng M. Zhen E. Robinson M.J. Ebert D. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12057-12062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 30Colwill K. Pawson T. Andrews B. Prasad J. Manley J.L. Bell J.C. Duncan P.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Finally, examination of the quantitative and qualitative effect of AvrPto on Pto autophosphorylation may shed light on the mechanism of Pto activation. The recognition event between Pto and AvrPto is postulated to result in activation of Pto effectors including the serine/threonine kinase Pti1 (12Zhou J. Loh Y.-T. Bressan R.A. Martin G.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 925-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and putative transcription factors (13Zhou J. Tang X. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3207-3218Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Here, we have shown that Pti1, similar to Pto, autophosphorylates intramolecularly at one major and a few minor phosphorylation sites. The functional relevance of this mechanism of autophosphorylation in the Pto-signaling pathway has yet to be determined. Autophosphorylation of serine/threonine protein kinases in plants has been shown to occur intermolecularly or intramolecularly, but neither of the two mechanisms has been related to a specific form of regulation of activity (24Roe J.L. Durfee T. Zupan J.R. Repetti P.P. McLean B.G. Zambryski P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5838-5845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 31Horn M.A. Walker J.C. Biochim.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26684-26689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Pti1 has been shown previously to be phosphorylated in vitroby Pto and proposed as an in vivo substrate for Pto (12Zhou J. Loh Y.-T. Bressan R.A. Martin G.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 925-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Here, we further characterized this in vitro interaction and estimated the K m of Pto for Pti1 to be 4.1 μm. This K m is in the range of values observed in the interaction between kinases from different signaling pathways and their physiological or synthetic substrates. For example, the K m value of Raf-1 for MEK is 0.8 μm (33Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar), cAMP-dependent protein kinase fromDictyostelium discoideum phosphorylates a synthetic heptapeptide with a K m value of 12 μm, and the ERK-2 mitogen-activated protein kinase shows aK m value of 0.12 μm for Raf-1 (34Lee R., M. Cobb M.H. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1088-1092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recessive pto allele that does not confer speck disease resistance was isolated recently and shown to encode a functional protein kinase (20Jia Y. Loh Y.-T. Zhou J. Martin G.B. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 61-73PubMed Google Scholar). Although the pto kinase is able to use Pti1 as a substrate for phosphorylation, it shows very poor physical interaction with Pti1 and three additional Pto-interacting proteins in the yeast two-hybrid system (20Jia Y. Loh Y.-T. Zhou J. Martin G.B. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 61-73PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we found by phosphopeptide analysis that Pti1 phosphorylation by Pto or pto and Pti autophosphorylation occur at similar sites. This observation raises questions about how the activities of different components in the speck disease resistance signaling pathway are regulated. These results also suggest that the inability of the pto kinase to mediate a resistance response toP. syringae pv. tomato expressing the avrPto gene is not related to an altered recognition specificity for Pti1 phosphorylation sites.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 209-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in S. cerevisiae (18Lee F.-J.S. Huang C.-F. Yu W.-L. Buu L.-M. Lin C.-Y. Huang M.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol.

Unlike the combination of ARFs 1 and 2, the yARL1 gene knock out construct was not lethal. Moreover, yARL1 did not rescue the arf1− arf2− construct and thus may not have a role in constitutive secretion, but rather in regulated secretion.We report here that the hARL1 protein is abundant in most human tissues, except brain (adult and fetal). Human ARL1, which is more similar in amino acid sequence to hARF1 than to other human ARLs, can, under certain conditions, activate PLD and enhance CTA-catalyzed ADP-ribosyltransferase activity.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONUsing a hARL1-specific oligonucleotide probe for Northern blotting, hARL1 mRNA was detected in most human tissues (lung, heart, liver, placenta, kidney, pancreas, and skeletal muscle) with the largest amount in pancreas and kidney; less ARL1 mRNA was present in adult or fetal brain (Fig. 1). The hARL1-specific oligonucleotide probe hybridized with three distinct bands of 3.2, 1.7, and 1.2 kb in RNA from all tissues except brain, where only the 3.2-kb species was found. In additional blotting experiments, a different sequence-specific probe yielded identical results for hARL1 (data not shown). The level of rat ARL1 mRNA was reported to be reduced after differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells and only a single 2.2-kb mRNA was detected (14Schürmann A. Breiner M. Becker W. Huppertz C. Kainulainen H. Kentrup H. Joost H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15683-15688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Lowe et al. (17Lowe S.L. Wong S.H. Hong W. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 209-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the major rat ARL1 mRNA had a size of 1.8 kb and was present in all tissues tested, albeit at relatively low levels in lung and spleen. The discrepancy in size between human and rat message is probably due to species differences. In addition to those shown for rat ARL1 (17Lowe S.L. Wong S.H. Hong W. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 209-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), multiple mRNA species were also noted for human ARL3 (13Cavenagh M. Breiner M. Schurmann A. Rosenwald A.G. Terui T. Zhang C. Randazzo P.A.

Acta. 1996; 1308: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).To determine the tissue distribution of hARL protein, we prepared polyclonal antibodies against 6-His hARL1, which reacted on Western blots with preparations of hARL1 synthesized in E. coli(Fig. 2, A and B). (His-tagged proteins were purified by Ni2+/affinity chromatography and nonfusion proteins by size-exclusion chromatography.) The antibodies against hARL1 did not react detectably with other human ARLs or human ARFs 1, 5, or 6 (Fig. 2, Aand B). By Western blotting, amounts of hARL1 protein were highest in kidney, liver, heart, and lung (Fig. 2 C), as were mRNA levels. The nature of the lower molecular weight immunoreactive species in heart and skeletal muscle is unknown, but it was also seen when the same blot was stripped and incubated with antibodies against His-tagged hARL5. Differences in protein size may relate to tissue-specific, differential protein processing.Figure 2Reactivity of anti-hARL1 polyclonal antibodies with ARFs and ARLs detection of hARL1 protein in human tissues. A, recombinant nonfusion ARFs as well as nonfusion and 6-His ARLs (2 μg each) (B) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, reacted with anti-hARL1 polyclonal antibodies, developed, and exposed to Hyper-film-MP.

C, a multiple human tissue blot (MTN blot, 6.5–100-kDa proteins, purchased from CLONTECH) was incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against hARL1.

In the presence of PS or PC under PLD assay conditions, hARL1 activated CTA, albeit much less effectively than did hARF1 (TableI and Fig. 3). Activation of CTA by hARL1 was, for the most part, not GTP-dependent (TableII). Similar to preparations of rARF6 (25Welsh C.F. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol.

As shown in TableIII, GTPγS binding by hARL1 in vitro, like that by hARF1, was modified by phospholipids and detergent. In the presence of CL, binding by hARF1 was greater than by hARL1, but hARL1 bound more GTPγS than hARF1 in the presence of PS. In all cases, only a small fraction of the recombinant proteins exhibited high affinity binding.Table IEffect of lipids and detergent on hARL1 stimulation of CTA activityPhospholipidADP-ribosyltransferase activityNonehARF1hARL1nmol ADP-ribosylagmatine/hCL, 669 μm0.8211.11.06PS, 235 μm0.323.50.93PE, 240 μm0.351.30.65PC, 353 μm0.281.40.76PIP2, 240 μm0.452.80.99DMPC, 3 mm/cholate, 0.2%1.13.71.7Assays without or with hARF1 or hARL1 (5 μg), CTA (1 μg), 200 μm [adenosine-14C]NAD, 10 mm agmatine, 200 μm GTPγS, and phospholipid or detergent were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h.

Activation of a highly purified PLD by hARL1 was less than that by hARF1 (Fig. 4), but was GTPγS-dependent (Fig. 5). Activation of PLD by hARL, along with the prior observation of rat ARL1 localization to the Golgi, could be consistent with a role in vesicular trafficking similar to that of ARFs.Figure 4Effect of rARL1 on PLD activity.Duplicate assays containing 200 μm GTPγS, 10 mm DTT, and 2 μl of PLD (∼0.5 μg) were performed with the indicated concentration of rARF1 (•) and rARL1 (○).

Price S.R. Tsai S.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2772-2777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ARL proteins are structurally related to ARFs, but due to their relative ineffectiveness in the activation of cholera toxin and inability to rescue the lethal arf1−arf2− double deletion mutant in yeast (8Tsuchiya M. Price S.R. Tsai S.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2772-2777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), they were not classified as ARFs. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of hARL1 with those of hARFs and other hARLs reveals the greatest degree of identity exists between hARL1 and class II ARFs (TableIV). Sequences of hARF4 and hARF5 (180 amino acids) are 58% identical to hARL1. Deduced amino acid sequences of hARL1 and hARF1 are 57% identical, and the functional consequences of some of these differences have been demonstrated (21Zhang G.-F. Patton W.A. Lee F.-J.S. Liyanage M. Han J.-S. Rhee S.G. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). hARL1 is only 35–43% identical to the other four known ARLs. Based on this alignment, it appears that human ARLs may fall into classes in a manner analogous to human ARFs (Fig. 6). ARL1 differs on one hand from ARLs 2 and 3, which are 53% identical and on the other from ARLs 4 and 5, which are 60% identical. ARL2 is, however, only 27 and 29% identical to ARLs 4 and ARL5, respectively, and ARL3 is 37 and 35% identical to ARL4 and ARL5, respectively. We, therefore, propose that there are at least three distinct classes of ARL (I, II, and III); human ARL1 (Class I) appears to be different, from ARLs 2 and 3 (Class II) and ARLs 4 and 5 (Class III). Human ARLs 2 and 3 did not activate PLD, although, under the same assay conditions, they bound significantly more GTPγS than did hARL1. 2F.-J. S. Lee, J.-X. Hong, W. A. Patton, C. Y. Lin, J.

The ability to modulate T-cell signaling pathways suggests that Nef may physically interact with T-cell signaling proteins. In order to identify Nef binding proteins and map their site(s) of interaction, we targeted a highly conserved acidic sequence at the carboxyl-terminal region of Nef sharing striking similarity with an acidic sequence at the c-Raf1-binding site within the Ras effector region. Here, we used deletion and site-specific mutagenesis to generate mutant Nef proteins fused to bacterial glutathioneS-transferase in in vitro precipitation assays and immunoblot analysis to map the specific interaction between the HIV-1LAI Nef and c-Raf1 to a conserved acidic sequence motif containing the core sequence Asp-Asp-X-X-X-Glu (position 174–179). Significantly, we demonstrate that substitution of the nonpolar glycine residue for either or both of the conserved negatively charged aspartic acid residues at positions 174 and 175 in the full-length recombinant Nef protein background completely abrogated binding of c-Raf1 in vitro. In addition, lysates from a permanent CEM T-cell line constitutively expressing the native HIV-1 Nef protein was used to coimmunoprecipitate a stable Nef-c-Raf1 complex, suggesting that molecular interactions between Nef and c-Raf1, an important downstream transducer of cell signaling through the c-Raf1-MAP kinase pathway, occur in vivo.

This interaction may account for the Nef-induced perturbations of T-cell signaling and activation pathways in vitro and in vivo.

The ability of Nef to alter T-cell signaling and activation pathwaysin vitro and in vivo suggests a mechanism that may involve specific molecular interactions between Nef and a limited number of cellular signaling proteins. In order to define this mechanism, we set out to identify and map the T-cell signaling proteins and their specific protein-protein interaction domains that are targets of the HIV-1 Nef protein in vitro and in vivo. In the present report, we describe the identification of a relatively well conserved acidic sequence motif, consensus Asp/Glu-Asp-X-X-X-Glu (where X represents any other amino acid), at the carboxyl-terminal region of the primate lentiviral Nef proteins (35Samuel K.P. Hodge D.R. Chen Y.-M.A. Papas T.S. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1991; 7: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), that is structurally quite similar to the corresponding acidic sequence, Asp-Pro-Thr-Ile-Glu-Asp (amino acids 33–38), at the c-Raf1-binding site within the conserved core effector loop of the Ras oncoprotein (36Barnard D. Diaz B. Hettich L. Chuang E. Zhang X.-F. Avruch J. Marshall M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1283-1290PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we describe that the c-Raf1 kinase physically interacts with the HIV-1LAI Nef protein at the acidic sequence motif which can be effectively blocked by single point mutations that substituted a nonpolar glycine residue for either of the conserved aspartic acid residues at positions 174 (Asp-174 → Gly) or 175 (Asp-175 → Gly) and by combined Asp-174 → Gly and Asp-175 → Gly mutations at both positions. Our results define the direct binding of c-Raf1 kinase to a conserved acidic sequence in the carboxyl-terminal region of the HIV-1 Nef protein in vitro and suggest a possible molecular model for investigating the Nef-induced T-cell signaling defects involving the c-Raf1-MAP kinase signaling pathway. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (37Kunkel T.L. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar) was performed on plasmid pSG5-Δ9Nef which contains the full-length HIV-1Lai (HTLV-111B) nef gene (GenBankTMM15654, nucleotides 8152–8773) (38Ratner L.

The mutagenic oligonucleotide, 5′-CTGCATGGAATGGGTGACCCGGAGAGA-3′ (mutated nucleotides are in boldface and codon changes are underlined), which substituted a glycine for the aspartic acid at position 174 (D174G change), spans nucleotide positions 8659–8685 of the HIV-1Lai nef gene (38Ratner L.

The resulting wild-type and mutated full-length nef genes were cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pGEX-2T plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (39Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar), generating the pGEX-wtNef and pGEX-Nef174D−, pGEX-Nef175D−, pGEX-Nef174:175DD−, and pGEX-Nef174:175:179DDE− nef expression plasmids, respectively. The correct clones were verified by DNA sequence analysis. A 360-bpEcoRV-Ecl136II nef gene fragment spanning nucleotides 8555–8929 and encoding amino acid residues 136–206 at the carboxyl-terminal region of the HIV-1LAI(HTLV-111B) Nef protein was subcloned into theSmaI site of pBluescript plasmid (Stratagene, CA), then released with BamHI and EcoRI enzymes, and cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pGEX-2T plasmid (39Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar) to generate the pGEX-Nef1C expression plasmid. The 360-bpBamHI-EcoRI fragment was used to generate a panel of carboxyl-terminal nef deletion mutants by digestion with unique restriction enzymes, followed by repair of sticky ends with Klenow enzyme. The blunt-ended fragments were then cloned into the pGEX-2T or pGEX-3X plasmids (39Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar) to generate the following expression plasmids: pGEX-Δ12nef, which contains a 180-bpBamHI-HaeI11 nef gene fragment (codons 136–194); pGEX-Δ31nef containing codons 136–177 encoded by a 123-bp BamHI-Nci1 fragment; pGEX-Δ41nef containing an 88-bpBamHI-Mae111 fragment encoding codons 136–165; and pGEX-Δ29nef containing a 290-bpMaeIII-Ecl136II fragment encoding codons 165–206. The pGEX-Raf-(50–133) expression plasmid was created by polymerase chain reaction cloning in which the primer pairs, 5′-GTAGGATCCGATCCTTCTAAGACAAGC-3′ and 5′-CTAGAATTCATCCAGGAAATCTACTTG-3′ containing a 5′-BamHI and 3′-EcoRI restriction site, were used to release a 245-bpEcoRI-BamHI fragment from the pKS+cRaf-1 plasmid (a gift from Dr. Debra Morrison, FCRDC, Frederick, MD) which encodes amino acids 50–133 of the human c-Raf1 protein. The fragment was then cloned into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T vector. The correct clone was authenticated by DNA sequence analysis. The expression vectors were then used to transform competentEscherichia coli XL-1 or JM109 cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for expression of fusion proteins. The full-length human c-Raf1 protein (residues 1–648) was expressed as a GST-Raf-(1–648) fusion protein in the Sf9 insect (Spodeptera frugiperda) cell line with the pVL1393 baculovirus expression vector. Fresh overnight cultures of E. coli XL-1 or JM109 cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) harboring the various pGEX expression plasmids were diluted 1:10 in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and the cultures were grown and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (Sigma) as described previously (39Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation and washed in ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4, Mg2+/Ca2+-free) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/mll-1-chloro-3-[4-tosylamido]-4-phenyl-2-butanone, 100 μg/ml l-1-chloro-3-[4-tosylamido]-7-amino-2-heptanone, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and Triton X-100-soluble extracts containing the recombinant proteins were prepared essentially as described before (40Grieco F. Hay J.A. Hull R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 856-857PubMed Google Scholar). The detergent-soluble protein extracts were dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (Boehringer Mannheim), and the GST and recombinant GST fusion proteins were purified by coupling to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) by gentle mixing at 4 °C for 1 h as described (39Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar, 40Grieco F. Hay J.A. Hull R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 856-857PubMed Google Scholar). The coupled affinity beads were sequentially washed with excess PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Triton X-100, PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 300 mm NaCl, and finally with PBS. The protein-bound affinity beads were analyzed and quantitated by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining following SDS-PAGE analysis (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). The coupled affinity beads were then adjusted to approximately 1 μg of protein per 50-μl beads and stored as a 33% (v/v) slurry at 4 °C in PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors. Full-length wild-type and mutant recombinant GST-Nef fusion proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads were digested with thrombin protease enzyme according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim) to remove the 26-kDa GST fusion tag, and the thrombin activity was inactivated with the protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim). The resulting protease-cleaved soluble Nef proteins were recovered by centrifugation of the glutathione-agarose beads to which the GST tag was still bound, followed by buffer exchange through a small Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The recovered recombinant Nef proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and quantitated by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The samples were adjusted to contain the same amount of protein. The CEM T-lymphoblastoid cell line was maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 4 mm glutamine, 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 100 units each of streptomycin and penicillin (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA). Cells in exponential growth phase were collected at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed once with ice-cold PBS. Whole cell lysates were prepared in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) supplemented with 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/mll-1-chloro-3-[4-tosylamido]-7-amino-2-heptanone, 100 μg/ml l-1-chloro-3-[4-tosylamido]-4-phenyl-2-butanone, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin A (Boehringer Mannheim) at 4 °C, then cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. Cleared cell lysates containing 5 × 107 CEM cell eq/ml were used immediately or frozen at −70 °C until use. Soluble CEM whole cell lysates containing 5 × 107 CEM cell eq/ml were incubated with 50 μl (1 μg of protein) of GST beads or GST-Nef affinity beads with gentle mixing for 2 h at 4 °C, and the protein-bound beads were extensively washed with an excess of ice-cold cell lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors and processed for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described above. For the direct protein binding assay, aliquots containing 1 μg of thrombin-cleaved soluble recombinant Nef proteins were incubated with 50 μl (1 μg of protein) of glutathione-agarose affinity beads containing either the bound recombinant GST-Raf-(50–133) or GST-Raf-(1–648) fusion proteins for 2 h at 4 °C as before. The protein-bound beads were then extensively washed with cell lysis buffer and processed for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as before. Cellular proteins bound to the GST beads and GST fusion protein affinity beads were solubilized by boiling with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved by fractionation on reducing SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). The fractionated proteins were then electrophoretically transferred (42Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The membranes were then incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of mouse anti-human c-Raf1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that was raised against amino acids 162–378 of the human c-Raf1 kinase (Transduction Laboratories) or with a 1:500 dilution of the 55S mAb against the HIV-1LAI(HTLV-111B) Nef protein (43Zweig M. Samuel K.P. Showalter S.D. Bladen S.V. DuBois G.C. Lautenberger J.A. Hodge D.R. Papas T.S.

Following extensive washes for 10 min each in TBS-T, the membranes were incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of a sheep anti-mouse IgG:horseradish peroxidase conjugate in TBS-T with 1% BSA at 23 °C for 60 min. The membranes were then extensively washed as before, and the complexes were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Burkinghamshire, UK). Whole cell lysates containing 5 × 108 CEM cell eq/ml were prepared from permanent CEM T-cell lines transduced with the HIV-1LAI(HTLV-111B) wild-type nef allele in the forward (NEF) and reverse (FEN) directions with the pLXSN retroviral expression vector (CLONTECH, Inc., La Jolla, CA) and were incubated either with the 55S anti-Nef (43Zweig M.

The immunoprecipitates were washed extensively with cell lysis buffer, then solubilized by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and resolved by fractionation on SDS-PAGE as described before. The fractionated proteins were transferred to Hybond-polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as before; the membrane was then incubated either with the anti-Raf1 or anti-Nef mAbs, and specifically bound antigen-antibody complexes were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence system as before. Recombinant GST-ΔNef fusion proteins containing overlapping amino acid deletions between residues 136 and 206 at the carboxyl-terminal region of the HIV-1LAINef protein were expressed in an insoluble form in E. colibacteria and then solubilized by extraction with the Sarkosyl-Triton X-100 procedure (40Grieco F. Hay J.A. Hull R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 856-857PubMed Google Scholar). The detergent-soluble fusion proteins were finally purified by directly coupling to glutathione-agarose beads as described previously (39Smith D.B. Johnson K.S.

Aliquots of affinity beads containing 1–3 μg of the purified GST fusion proteins were resolved by fractionation on SDS-PAGE and quantitated by staining the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Fig. 1,lanes 1–6). Three of the resulting Nef fusion proteins carrying carboxyl- or amino-terminal deletions, GST-Δ12Nef (lane 3), GST-Δ31Nef (lane 5), and GST-Δ41Nef (lane 6), respectively, show anomalous mobilities on the SDS gel. In addition, samples of the glutathione-agarose beads containing 1 μg of the GST-bound wild-type full-length Nef (Fig. 3 B, lane 2) and mutant full-length Nef proteins containing individual or combined point mutations within the conserved acidic sequence motif (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3–6) were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE and quantitated by Coomassie Blue staining.Figure 3Site-specific mutagenesis of the putative c-Raf1-binding site in HIV-1 Nef.

However, other factors, such as somatic genetic alterations also play a decisive role in malignant conversion of cervical keratinocytes. Mutations and chromosomal aberrations are known to influence the pattern of gene expression. Therefore we used the recently developed RT-PCR based method of differential display of mRNAs to detect differences in gene expression which correlate with tumorigenicity. Non-tumorigenic HPV16-immortalized human foreskin keratinocytes (HPK IA) were compared with their tumorigenic counterparts and 49 different genes were identified which were either up- or downregulated. The identified genes encode proteins of the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, the nuclear splicing apparatus, transcription regulators and membrane-associated proteins. The expression pattern of all genes was also examined by RNA-RNA in situ hybridization in biopsies of normal cervical epithelium, precancerous lesions and cancers. Two genes, C4.8 and C21.7, are of particular interest because their expression is upregulated in a subset of high grade precancerous lesions and in over 58% of cancers. These two genes may therefore be considered as putative progression markers. C4.8 is a new member of the transmembrane 4 (TM-4) protein family which includes tumor-associated antigens such as CD63 and TAPA-1, whereas C21.7 shows no significant homologies to any known genes or proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2317381089,"Compared to normal melanocytes, melanoma cell lines exhibit overexpression of hyperphosphorylated retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb) or a marked decrease in, or lack of, expression of Rb. Hyperphosphorylation of Rb results in increased E2F-mediated transactivation of target genes and cell cycle progression. Using a combination of gene disruption and ectopic expression in growth factor-dependent mouse melanocytes, we studied the roles of E2F1 and the p16INK4A and p21WAF1/CIP1 CKIs (cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors) in the acquisition of TPA (12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate)-independent growth in culture, a hallmark of melanomas. Surprisingly, melanocytes from p16INK4A- or p21WAF1/CIP1-null mice remained TPA-dependent, and disruption of p21WAF1/CIP1 accelerated cell death in the absence of this mitogen. Disruption of E2F1 had the most profound effect on melanocyte growth, resulting in a fourfold decrease in growth rate in the presence of TPA. Furthermore, enforced overexpression of the DNA-binding-defective E2F1E132 mutant conferred TPA-independence upon melanocytes and was associated with sequestration of Rb and constitutive expression of E2F1 target genes, including p21WAF1/CIP1. We conclude that neutralization of Rb by E2F1E132, but not the disruption of p16INK4A or p21WAF1/CIP1, resulted in the accumulation of free E2F and cell cycle progression. Thus, mechanisms other than the loss of p16INK4A or p21WAF1/CIP1 that activate E2F may play an important role in melanomas."
https://openalex.org/W2090444742,"Murine C2C12 myoblasts induced to differentiate into multinucleated myotubes decrease their levels of c-myc mRNA 3–10-fold through posttranscriptional mechanisms that recognize regulatory elements contained in protein-coding sequences in exons 2 and 3 of the mRNA. To determine the mechanism by which these elements mediate c-mycmRNA down-regulation, we examined the regulation of mutantMYC and human β-globin-MYC fusion mRNAs. Regulation of mRNAs containing MYC exon 2 or 3 is abolished by insertion of an upstream termination codon indicating that regulatory function depends on their translation. Exploiting this translation dependence, we show that pharmacologic inhibition of translation with cycloheximide abolishes the down-regulation of regulated MYC and globin-MYC mRNAs and induces their levels in differentiating C2C12 cells. We exclude the possibility that this induction in mRNA levels results from cycloheximide effects on transcription or processing of parts of the RNA other than the regulatory elements, leading to the conclusion that cycloheximide induction results from mRNA stabilization. We show that the magnitude of cycloheximide induction can be used to estimate turnover rates of mRNAs whose decay is translation-dependent. By using cycloheximide inducibility to examine turnover rates of MYC and globin-MYCmRNAs, we show that the MYC exon 2 and exon 3 regulatory elements, but not MYC 3′-untranslated region or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase coding sequences, mediate accelerated mRNA decay in differentiating, but not undifferentiated, C2C12 cells. We show that these regulatory elements must be translated to confer accelerated mRNA decay and that increased turnover occurs in the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus. Finally, using cycloheximide induction to examine mRNA half-lives, we show that mRNA turnover is increased sufficiently by mechanisms targeting the exon 2 and 3 regulatory elements to account for the magnitude of c-myc mRNA down-regulation during differentiation. We conclude from these results that c-myc mRNA down-regulation during myogenic differentiation is due to translation-dependent mechanisms that target mRNAs containing myc exon 2 and 3 regulatory elements for accelerated decay.

For example, many labile cytokine and proto-oncogene mRNAs (e.g. c-fosand granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor) contain AU-rich/AUUUA sequence elements in their 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) 1The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region(s); DMEM, Dulbecco's minimum essential media; DM, differentiation media; MLV, murine leukemia virus; LTR, long terminal repeat; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region(s); DMEM, Dulbecco's minimum essential media; DM, differentiation media; MLV, murine leukemia virus; LTR, long terminal repeat; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. that target them for rapid turnover and limit gene expression (1Shaw G.

Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 60-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), whereas α-globin mRNA has a C-rich element in its 3′-UTR that allows formation of a protein-mRNA complex that is thought to stabilize the mRNA and allow prolonged gene expression (3Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A secondary structural element in the 3′-UTR of histone mRNA targets it for translation-dependent turnover that is coupled to the position of the cell in the cell cycle and DNA synthesis (4Graves R.A. Pandey N.B. Chodchoy N. Marzluff W.F. Cell. 1987; 48: 615-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Turnover of transferrin receptor mRNA is regulated by stem-loop structures in its 3′-UTR termed iron-responsive elements that are bound by iron regulatory proteins in an iron-poor environment resulting in mRNA stabilization. Conversely, in an iron-rich environment, the unprotected mRNA is rapidly degraded. Autoregulation of β-tubulin mRNA levels occurs through recognition of the first four amino acids of the nascent peptide by excess free β-tubulin subunits, and resulting dimerization targets the mRNA for accelerated turnover (5Yen T.J. Machlin P.S. Cleveland D.W. Nature. 1988; 334: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Regulated RNA stability plays a critical role in controlling expression of c-myc, a proto-oncogene encoding a transcription factor important in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation.

However, these sequences are dispensable for the posttranscriptional down-regulation of c-myc mRNA levels when C2C12 cells are induced to differentiate into multinucleated myotubes (17Wisdom R.

Instead, coding elements in myc exons 2 and 3 target c-myc mRNA for down-regulation during differentiation. In studies presented here, we characterize the mechanism by which c-myc expression is posttranscriptionally down-regulated during C2C12 myogenic differentiation. We demonstrate that translation of exon 2 and exon 3 coding elements is necessary for them to target mRNAs for down-regulation and that down-regulation occurs by translation-dependent accelerated mRNA decay in the cytoplasm. All experiments were performed using C2C12 myoblasts (22Blau H.M. Pavlath G.K. Hardeman E.C. Chiu C.-P. Silberstein L. Webster S.G. Miller S.C. Webster C.

Plasmids containing test genes were stably co-transfected into C2C12 cells with a plasmid containing a neor gene using the calcium phosphate method. After selection in 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), pools of 25–50 surviving colonies were expanded for study. C2C12 cells were induced to differentiate into multinucleated myotubes as described previously (17Wisdom R. Lee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19015-19021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts were seeded at subconfluent density in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Cells were cultured to confluence and then induced to differentiate by changing the media to differentiation media (DM), DMEM containing 2% horse serum. Salient features of the plasmids used in this article are diagrammed in Fig. 1. The normal human c-MYC gene contains three exons. CM19 was described previously (20Yeilding N.M. Rehman M.T. Lee W.M.

The construction of plasmidsMYC(Δ41–178) and MYC(Δ265–433) in whichMYC codons 41–178 or 265–433 were deleted, respectively, was described previously (23Stone J. de Lange T. Ramsay G. Jakobovits E. Bishop J.M. Varmus H. Lee W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1697-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). MYC(T/N) was described previously (21Yeilding N.M. Lee W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2698-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and contains MYC cDNA sequences from theThaI site 5 nucleotides upstream of the exon 2 translation initiation codon to the NsiI site and uses the SVpA.MYC(Ex2Term3) was created by inserting an oligonucleotide linker containing an in-frame termination codon into the ClaI site at codon 262 in MYC(T/N). To createMYC(Ex3/2), an XhoI site was inserted at codon 40 of MYC(T/N)(Δ265–433) (21Yeilding N.M. Lee W.M. Mol. Cell.

Construction of the β-globin-MYC plasmids, βGm434SVpA, βGm434MYCpA, βGm263SVpA, and βGm(40–262)SVpA, and their nomenclature was described previously (20Yeilding N.M. Rehman M.T. Lee W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3511-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These genes contain an MLV-β-globin backbone encoding the first 140 globin amino acids (out of 146) fused to variable MYC sequences. In βGm434SVpA, MLV-β-globin is fused in-frame to the last sixMYC codons and the first 75 nucleotides of theMYC 3′-UTR and uses the SVpA. The other genes were created from βGm434SVpA with the following modifications: in βGm434MYCpA, the entire MYC 3′-UTR and flanking sequences to the EcoRI site was substituted for the SVpA; in βGm263SVpA, almost all MYC exon 3 coding sequences (from codon 263 to the NsiI site in MYC exon 3) are fused in-frame to globin; and in βGm(40–262)SVpA, MYCcDNA sequences from codon 40–262 (most exon 2 coding sequences and the first 10 codons in exon 3) are fused in-frame to globin. To create βGm263TermSVpA and βGm(40–262)TermSVpA, a termination coding was inserted into the linker fusing globin and MYC domains allowing globin sequences, but not MYC sequences, to be translated. βGm263SVpARI− and βGm(40–262)SVpARI− were created by introducing a C to T mutation by site-directed mutagenesis into β-globin codon 122 which destroys an EcoRI site but preserves the encoded amino acid (phenylalanine). In βG-CAT (20Yeilding N.M. Rehman M.T. Lee W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3511-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the MLV-β-globin backbone is fused to the last 181 codons (out of a total of 219) of the bacterial gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and uses the SVpA. RNA isolation for differentiation assays was described previously (21Yeilding N.M. Lee W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2698-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To examine induction in mRNA levels after inhibition of translation, total cytoplasmic mRNA was isolated from duplicate tissue culture plates of both undifferentiated and differentiating C2C12 cells, one plate untreated and the other exposed to cycloheximide (Sigma) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml for 3 h, unless otherwise stated. Differentiating cells were used 36–48 h after exposure to DM, and differentiation-induced c-myc mRNA down-regulation was considered to have occurred when c-myc mRNA levels decreased more than 3-fold compared with levels in undifferentiated cells. mRNA levels were determined by Northern analysis using the glyoxal method (24McMaster G.K. Carmichael G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4835-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). RNA was electroblotted to Hybond N (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and UV cross-linked. Hybridizations were carried out by modifications of the method of Church and Gilbert (25Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Human MYC mRNAs were probed using a human c-MYC exon 1 probe (XhoI toPvuII fragment) or a human c-MYC exon 2+3 cDNA probe from pSP65MYCIIA (23Stone J. de Lange T. Ramsay G. Jakobovits E. Bishop J.M.

C2C12 c-myc mRNA was probed with a murine c-mycexon 1 probe (BamHI to SacI fragment) or a human c-MYC exon 2 + 3 cDNA probe from pSP65MYCIIA (23Stone J. de Lange T. Ramsay G. Jakobovits E.

Cell. 1984; 37: 457-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Northern blots were analyzed on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA) using ImageQuant software, and the relative levels ofMYC and globin-MYC fusion mRNAs during differentiation or after cycloheximide were determined by normalizing for RNA loading using the level of rpL32 mRNA. All experiments were performed at least twice, and representative results are displayed in the figures presented. Induction in mRNA levels 3 h after inhibition of translation was used to deduceMYC and globin-MYC mRNA half-lives. Assuming first order kinetics of mRNA decay, the steady-state level of a given mRNA species, [mRNA]ss, is a function of its rate of synthesis, k s, and its half-life,t½, and can be calculated as shown in Equation1. [mRNA]SS=(kS×t½)/ln2Equation 1 If mRNA decay is completely inhibited but the rate of transcription continues at the same rate, the mRNA level at timex, [mRNA]x, will be a function of the steady-state mRNA level prior to inhibition of decay, the rate of synthesis, and the time synthesis is allowed to continue,t x, as shown in Equation 2. [mRNA]X=[mRNA]SS+(kS×tX)Equation 2 Under these conditions, the fold induction of a given mRNA species, [mRNA]x ÷ [mRNA]ss, is a function of the length of time synthesis is allowed to continue and the mRNA half-life prior to stabilization as shown in Equation 3. fold induction=[mRNA]X÷[mRNA]SS=1+(tX×ln2)/t½Equation 3 Therefore, the mRNA half-life can be calculated under these conditions as shown in Equation 4. t½=(tX×ln2)÷(fold induction1)Equation 4 The RT-PCR+1 assay for comparing the abundance of two β-globin-containing mRNAs was performed as described previously (20Yeilding N.M. Rehman M.T. Lee W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3511-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Total cytoplasmic RNA was extracted from stably transfected C2C12 myoblasts by a reduced scale modification of the method of Laski et al. (27Laski F.A. Alzner-DeWeerd B. RajBhandary U.L. Sharp P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 4609-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To isolate nuclear RNA, nuclei were isolated from C2C12 cells after lysis in nuclear lysis buffer, NLB (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). After washing nuclei in NLB, nuclear RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequence-specific reverse transcription of cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA was performed by priming with oligonucleotide, βG3′Rev (see below), using MLV reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplification of cDNA was performed using Taq polymerase (Promega) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 20 mm(NH4)2SO4, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 200 mm dNTPs, and 1 mmoligonucleotide primers on a PTC-100 thermal cycler (MJ Research, Cambridge, MA). A 214-base pair sequence of β-globin cDNA was amplified using oligonucleotide primers βGF2 and βG3′Rev (see below) under the following conditions: 92 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 15 s for 30 cycles. A “+1” cycle was conducted with a 32P-end-labeled nested primer, βGF1, and the products were restricted with EcoRI and resolved by electrophoresis. A radiolabeled 329-base pair DNA fragment was added to each EcoRI digestion reaction mixture to indicate complete digestion of the RT-PCR+1 products. The relative abundance of the RT-PCR+1 products (and, hence, of the mRNAs) was quantitated on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA) using ImageQuant software. The primers and their sequences used in this study are listed as follows: 1) βGF2, 5′AAGTGCTCGGTGCCTTTAGTGA3′; 2) βG3′Rev, 5′ACACCAGCCACCACTTTCTGA3′; 3) βGF1, 5′CAAGGGCACCTTTGCCACACT3′. Murine C2C12 myoblasts are induced to differentiate into multinucleated myotubes by mitogen deprivation. c-mycexpression is down-regulated early during differentiation, prior to the up-regulation of muscle-specific genes (e.g. creatine kinase) (17Wisdom R. Lee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19015-19021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This occurs through posttranscriptional mechanisms demonstrated by nuclear run-on assays which showed that the rate of c-myc transcription does not change significantly during differentiation, whereas c-myc mRNA levels decrease 3–10-fold (17Wisdom R. Lee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19015-19021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that two protein coding elements, one in exon 2 and the other in exon 3, are necessary for targeting myc mRNA for down-regulation, whereas 5′- and 3′-UTR sequences and introns are dispensable. The presence of regulatory determinants within the protein coding region of c-mycmRNA raises the possibility that their recognition may be coupled to translation. To determine whether translation of the mycexon 3 regulatory element is required for down-regulation, C2C12 cells were stably transfected with MYC(T/N), a MYCcDNA construct from which most 5′- and 3′-UTR sequences were deleted, or with MYC(Ex2Term3), a construct identical toMYC(T/N) except for the insertion of an in-frame nonsense mutation at codon 262 that prevents translation of about 95% of exon 3 coding sequences, including the exon 3 regulatory element. Cytoplasmic RNA was isolated on serial days from subconfluent cells, confluent cells, and confluent cells induced to differentiate. Northern analysis demonstrated that MYC(T/N) mRNA was maximally down-regulated 3.7-fold during C2C12 differentiation, comparable to the 4.1-fold down-regulation in endogenous murine c-myc mRNA (both normalized to rpL32 mRNA; Fig. 2 A). (In figures showing Northern blots from cells transfected with mutant human MYCgenes, transgene mRNA is labeled as Hu-MYC to distinguish it from the endogenous murine c-mycmRNA, labeled Mo-myc.) In contrast,MYC(Ex2Term3) mRNA was not down-regulated and even increased over 3-fold, whereas levels of endogenous c-mycmRNA in the same cells were down-regulated 6.7-fold (Fig. 2 B). This showed that translation of the myc exon 3 regulatory element is required for myc mRNA down-regulation. The translation dependence of exon 3 regulatory function made it impossible to determine whether function of the myc exon 2 regulatory element is translation-dependent in its normal context because insertion of a stop codon upstream of exon 2 would prevent translation of both elements. However, if the relative positions of the exon 2 and exon 3 elements are unimportant for myc regulation, the translation dependence of exon 2 regulatory function could be tested in a mutant mRNA in which the positions of the exon 2 and exon 3 coding elements are reversed. To explore this possibility, C2C12 cells were stably transfected with MYC(Ex3/2) in which the exon 3 regulatory element was placed 5′ to the exon 2 regulatory element and maintains the proper reading frame of both. Northern analysis showed that MYC(Ex3/2) mRNA was not down-regulated during differentiation (Fig. 2 C) demonstrating that the position of the exon 2 and 3 regulatory elements affects their function, precluding testing of the translation dependence of exon 2 regulatory function in the myc mRNA context. To determine the importance of translation for exon 2 function, we examined regulation of chimeric mRNAs in which MYC sequences were fused in-frame to human β-globin mRNA. We previously showed that human β-globin mRNA was down-regulated during differentiation when fused to either the exon 2 or 3 regulatory element but not when fused to MYC3′-UTR sequences or to CAT or rpL32 coding sequences (Ref. 21Yeilding N.M. Lee W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2698-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar and see Fig. 4). These globin-MYC chimeric genes allowed us to test the translation dependence of function of each of the mycmRNA regulatory domains independent of the other element. To that end, C2C12 cells were stably transfected with βGm(40–262)TermSVpA and βGm263TermSVpA, constructs which contain a stop codon 5′ to theMYC exon 2 or 3 regulatory element, respectively (ribosomes translate globin codons but not MYC codons). When C2C12 transfectants were induced to differentiate, levels of βGm(40–262)TermSVpA mRNA decreased only 1.3-fold and levels of βGm263TermSVpA mRNA were essentially unchanged, whereas levels of endogenous c-myc mRNA decreased 4.8- and over 10-fold in these respective stable transfectants (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, the regulatory elements in myc exons 2 and 3 must be translated to confer down-regulation on globin mRNA.Figure 3Regulatory elements in MYC exons 2 and 3 must be translated to confer down-regulation on β-globin mRNA. Differentiation assays were conducted on C2C12 cells stably transfected with βGm(40–262)TermSVpA or βGm263TermSVpA. (Refer to legend in Fig. 2 for details of the assay.) Autoradiographs of Northern blots display mRNA levels in cells transfected with βGm(40–262)TermSVpA (A) and βGm263TermSVpA (B). mRNA from the transfected gene was detected using a full-length human β-globin cDNA probe (labeled Globin) pSPβκc; endogenous murine c-myc (labeled c-myc) and rpL32 mRNAs were detected usingmyc exons 2/3 and full-length rpL32 probes, respectively. RNA from untransfected C2C12 cells (U) was used to demonstrate specificity of the human β-globin cDNA probe. Thebar graphs depict the levels of endogenous murine c-myc mRNA (solid bars) and transgene mRNA (shaded bars) relative to their mRNA levels in preconfluent, undifferentiated cells after normalizing for RNA loading using the level of rpL32 mRNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Whereas coding sequences in myc exons 2 and 3 serve as translation-dependent, conditional mRNA regulatory elements, the mechanism by which they down-regulate mRNA is unclear. If the regulatory elements mediate down-regulation by accelerating mRNA decay in differentiating C2C12 cells, inhibiting their function should result in stabilization and increased levels of their mRNAs. Since their function is translation-dependent, we tested whether cycloheximide might produce these effects in differentiating C2C12 cells stably transfected with βGm(40–262)SVpA or βGm263SVpA, in which the regulatory element from MYC exon 2 or exon 3 was fused to globin, respectively. Following 3 h of cycloheximide treatment, levels of βGm(40–262)SVpA mRNA were 6-fold higher, and levels of βGm263SVpA mRNA were 8.7-fold higher than in untreated cells (Fig. 4, A andB). These results are consistent with the idea thatmyc exon 2 and exon 3 elements down-regulate their mRNAs by accelerating mRNA decay in a translation-d"

Conversely, C3 exoenzyme had no effect on the α2-adrenergic-dependent increase in tyrosyl phosphorylation and shift of ERK2 mitogen-activated protein kinase. α2-Adrenergic stimulation also led to an increase in GDP/GTP exchange on p21rhoA, as well as to an increase in the amount of p21rhoA in the particulate fraction of α2AF2 preadipocytes. Stable transfection of α2AF2 preadipocytes with the COOH-terminal domain of βARK1 (βARK-CT) (a blocker of Gβγ-action), strongly inhibited the α2-adrenergic-dependent increase in tyrosyl phos- phorylation and shift of ERK2, without modification of the tyrosyl phosphorylation of pp125FAK and spreading of preadipocytes. These results show that α2-adrenergic-dependent reorganization of actin cytoskeleton requires the activation of p21rhoA in preadipocytes.

In white adipose tissue, α2-ARs belong to the α2A-subtype and are expressed in both adipocytes and preadipocytes. In adipocytes α2-ARs mediate inhibition of lipolysis through a Gi-dependent coupling to adenylyl cyclase (2Lafontan M. Berlan M. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1057-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In preadipocytes, stimulation of α2-ARs generates a Gi/Go-dependent increase in cell proliferation. This effect was associated with rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of the p44 and p42 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) ERK1 and ERK2 (3Bouloumié A. Planat V. Devedjian J.-C.

It has particularly been demonstrated that the C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum (a toxin which specifically block the action of p21rhoA by catalyzing its ADP-ribosylation) is able to block the activation of cell motility, cell morphology, and cell growth, generated by several agonists acting through G protein-coupled receptors such as lysophosphatidic acid, sphingosine 1-phosphate, and thrombin (10Jalink K.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Considering the morphological changes generated by stimulation of the α2-ARs in preadipocytes, we analyzed (i) the involvement of p21rhoA in α2-adrenergic-dependent reorganization of actin cytoskeleton and tyrosyl phosphorylation of pp125FAK; (ii) the existence of a functional coupling between α2-ARs and p21rhoA; (iii) the putative involvement of βγ-subunits of G proteins in this coupling. In the present study we demonstrate that, in α2AF2 preadipocytes (a cell clone derived from the 3T3F442A preadipose cell line stably expressing the human α2C10-adrenergic receptor), α2-adrenergic-dependent reorganization of actin cytoskeleton involves the activation of p21rhoAindependently of a Gβγ-mediated transduction pathway. The cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% donor calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (7Bétuing S. Daviaud D. Valet P.

As determined by radioligand binding analysis, α2-adrenergic receptor density in α2AF2 preadipocytes was 2050 ± 90 fmol/mg protein. Stable expression of the carboxyl-terminal domain of βARK1 (βARK-CT) was obtained by transfection of α2AF2 preadipocytes with a pZeo/βARKCT vector, followed by the double selection G418/zeocin. pZeo/βARKCT vector was obtained by subcloning an EcoRI-SalI fragment from pRK-βARK1 vector (6Koch W.

The validity of the construct was verified by sequencing. Recombinant C3 exoenzyme were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli (generous gift from Dr. Alan Hall) and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads as described previously (12Dillon S. Larry A. Feig A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). C3 exoenzyme was released from the beads by thrombin (Calbiochem) cleavage and concentrated by centricon-3 (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). Cells were pretreated or not with C3 exoenzyme for various period of time, washed twice in PBS, and homogenized in extraction buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 20 mmTris-HCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm benzamidine, pH 7.5). ADP-ribosylation was carried out in a total volume of 100 μl containing 20 mmHepes, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mmthymidine, 0.1% deoxycholate, 10 mm NAD, 1 μCi of [32P]NAD, 100 μg of cell homogenate, and 0.5 μg of C3 exoenzyme. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 37 min and terminated by addition of 11 μl of 70% trichloroacetic acid for 15 min at 4 °C. The proteins in the pellet were dissolved in 50 μl of Laemmli buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol) and separated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, dried, and autoradiographed. The intensity of the spots was analyzed using an Image'quant software. Cell spreading activity was determined as described previously (7Bétuing S. Daviaud D. Valet P. Bouloumié A. Lafontan M. Saulnier-Blache J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5220-5229Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were previously retracted by serum starvation (which was characterized by an increased cell refringency) before addition of an α2-adrenergic agonist. The proportion of retracted cells was determined as the ratio between the number of refringent cells and the total number of cells present in a microscope field. Each value correspond to the mean of at least five separate fields. Actin filaments were visualized as described previously (13Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2033-2045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells grown on plastic culture plates were washed twice with PBS and fixed for 15 min in 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS. Fixed cells were washed twice with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min. Permeabilized cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 150 nm of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin PBS for 20 min. The cells were then extensively washed with PBS and examined using an epifluorescence microscope. Immunoprecipitation of tyrosyl-phosphorylated FAK, ERK2, and Western blot was carried out as described previously (7Bétuing S. Daviaud D. Valet P. Bouloumié A. Lafontan M. Saulnier-Blache J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5220-5229Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated with 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) conjugated with an antiphosphorylated antibody (PY20, Transduction Laboratories) and resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli buffer. Tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins were then separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated with an anti-focal adhesion kinase antibody (FAK C-20; 0.5 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary anti-rabbit (Immunotech). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After FAK detection, the blot was stripped for 30 min at 50 °C in 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.5, followed by extensive washes in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20). The blot was then incubated with anti-ERK2 (C-14, 1 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) to detect tyrosyl-phosphorylated ERK2. The intensity of the bands was measured using Image'quant software. Cells were lysed in extraction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.5, 15 mm NaCl, 1%n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 45 min to separate cytosolic and particulate fractions. Particulate fraction were resuspended in RIPA buffer (0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm Nacl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g to eliminate nonsolubilized material. Protein concentrations were determined according to the method of Lowryet al. (14Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and separated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for Western blot analysis using anti-RhoA antibody (26C4, 1 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and anti-αi2 antibody (gift from Dr. Rouot). The determination of the GTP/GDP ratio of p21rhoA was essentially as described (15Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cells were serum-starved for 18 h and subsequently labeled with 0.25 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h. Cells were stimulated with 1 mm UK14304 for various times and lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm GTP, 0.1 mm GDP, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The soluble cell extract was incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) conjugated with a mouse anti-RhoA antibody (119, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). 32P-Labeled GDP and GTP were eluted from the immunocomplexes with a buffer containing 5 mmEDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% SDS, 0.5 mmGDP, and 0.5 mm GTP for 20 min at 68 °C. After extensive washes GTP/GDP were separated by thin layer chromatography (Bakerflex PEI-F cellulose TLC plates, Bakerflex) in 1 mKH2PO4, pH 3.4, and autoradiographed. The intensity of the spots was analyzed using Image'quant software. In a previous study, we demonstrated that in preadipocytes, α2-adrenergic stimulation promotes rapid spreading, pp125FAK tyrosyl phosphorylation and actin stress fiber formation (7Bétuing S.

In total α2AF2 preadipocyte lysate C3 exoenzyme catalyzed the [32P]ADP-ribosylation of a unique band exhibiting a molecular mass of 21 kDa corresponding to p21rho proteins (Fig. 1 A) (12Dillon S.

Seventy-two hour pretreatment of intact α2AF2 preadipocytes with 10 μg/ml C3 exoenzyme led to about 80% reduction in the amount of the 21-kDa band (Fig. 1 B), demonstrating the ability of C3 exoenzyme to penetrate into intact α2AF2 preadipocytes and ADP-ribosylate p21rho proteins. After 15-h serum starvation, α2AF2 preadipocytes exhibited a retracted morphology (Fig. 2) characterized by the absence of actin stress fibers (visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin) (Fig. 3 A). Fifteen-minute treatment with a 1 μm amount of the specific α2-adrenergic agonist UK14304 led the spreading of almost 80% of retracted α2AF2 (Fig. 2) and by the formation of actin stress fibers (Fig. 3 B). UK14304-induced cell spreading and reorganization of actin cytoskeleton were abolished by 72-h pretreatment of α2AF2 preadipocytes with 10 μg/ml C3 exoenzyme (Figs. 2 and 3, C and D).Figure 3Influence of C3 exoenzyme on α2adrenergic-dependent stress fiber formation in α2AF2 preadipocytes. α2AF2 preadipocytes were treated (C, D) or not (A, B) with C3 exoenzyme (72 h, 10 μg/ml). After serum starvation control and C3 exoenzyme-treated α2AF2 preadipocytes were exposed (B,D) or not (A, C) to 1 μmUK14304 for 15 min. Actin filaments were visualized using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin as described under “Materials and Methods.” The pictures are representative of at least three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Five-min treatment of 24-h serum-starved α2AF2 preadipocytes with 1 μm UK14304 led to an increase in the tyrosyl phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase (pp125FAK) (Fig. 4 A, Control). The same stimulation also led to an increase in the tyrosyl phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK2 associated with a shift corresponding to the biphosphorylated (on tyrosine and threonine residues) and active form of ERK2 (Fig. 4 B,Control). Seventy-two-h pretreatment of α2AF2 preadipocytes with 10 μg/ml C3 exoenzyme led to a 75–80% reduction of UK14304-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of pp125FAK(Fig. 4 A, C3) without alteration of UK14304-induced shift and tyrosyl phosphorylation of ERK2 (Fig. 4 B, C3). These results revealed that, in α2AF2 preadipocytes, active p21rho proteins are required to mediate α2-adrenergic-dependent (i) spreading; (ii) actin stress fibers formation; and (iii) tyrosyl phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase. The above results suggested the existence of a functional coupling between α2-adrenergic receptors and p21rhoA. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the influence of the α2-adrenergic stimulation on the translocation of p21rhoA from cytosol to plasma membrane and the capacity of GDP/GTP exchange on p21rhoA. In control cells, the amount of p21rhoA in the particulate fraction was lower as compared with the cytosoluble fraction (Fig. 5 A). Stimulation of 24-h serum-starved α2AF2 preadipocytes with 1 μm UK14304 led to a increase in the amount of RhoA in the particulate fraction. This effect was not significant (1.6-fold increase over control) before 15-min treatment. (Fig. 5B). Conversely, the amount of Gαi2, which is exclusively localized in plasma membrane, was not modified by UK14304 treatment (Fig. 5 B). The influence of α2-adrenergic stimulation on GDP/GTP exchange on p21rhoA was tested by a GTP-loading assay. Stimulation of 24-h serum-starved α2AF2 preadipocytes with 1 μm UK14304 led to a rapid and transient increase in the proportion of p21rhoA-GTP versus p21rhoA-GDP with a maximum increase of 6-fold after 2 min (Fig. 6). These results revealed the existence of a functional coupling between α2-adrenoreceptors and p21rhoA proteins. We have shown previously that α2-adrenergic-dependent activation of actin cytoskeleton in preadipocytes was pertussis toxin-sensitive, a result demonstrating the involvement of heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gi/Go family (7Bétuing S. Daviaud D. Valet P. Bouloumié A. Lafontan M. Saulnier-Blache J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5220-5229Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To determine the putative influence of the Gβγ-subunits of activated G proteins in this regulation, α2AF2 preadipocytes were stably transfected with the COOH-terminal domain of βARK1 (βARK-CT), a truncated protein known to block the action of the Gβγ-subunits of G proteins when overexpressed in a cell (6Koch W. Hawes B. Inglese J. Luttrell L. Lefkowitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The selection of the cell clones exhibiting a blockade of Gβγ-subunits was based on the inhibition of the α2-adrenergic-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation and shift of ERK2. The activation of ERK proteins resulting from a Gβγ-dependent activation of p21ras (5Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12706-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) should be blocked by transfection of βARK-CT. Conversely Gβγ-independent activation of the p21ras/ERK pathway, such as that induced by growth factors contained in the serum, should not be altered. Based on these criteria, two cell clones (clone 5 and clone 50) exhibiting similar behavior were selected. Only results obtained with clone 50 are presented. As determined by radioligand binding assay α2-adrenergic receptor density was not significantly different between clone 50 and nontransfected α2AF2 preadipocytes (1750 ± 110 versus 2050 ± 90 fmol/mg protein). In clone 50 the tyrosyl phosphorylation of ERK2 induced by 1 μm UK14304 treatment was reduced about 80% as compared with nontransfected α2AF2 preadipocytes (Fig. 7). This was accompanied by an almost complete disappearance of the shifted form of ERK2 (Fig. 7). Conversely, the tyrosyl phosphorylation and shift of ERK2 promoted via treatment with 10% fetal calf serum was unaffected by βARK-CT transfection (Fig. 7). We then tested the influence of Gβγ blockade on the α2-adrenergic-dependent activation of p21rhoA-mediated pathways. For that, we studied, in clone 50, the α2-adrenergic-dependent regulation of spreading and tyrosyl phosphorylation of pp125FAK, cellular events demonstrated above to be dependent on p21rhoAactivation. In clone 50, the induction of preadipocyte spreading generated by 15-min exposure to 1 μm UK14304 was not significantly different as compared with nontransfected α2AF2 preadipocytes (Fig. 8). Similarly, in clone 50, the increase of pp125FAK tyrosyl phosphorylation induced by treatment with 1 μm UK14304 was not significantly altered as compared with α2AF2 preadipocytes (Fig. 9).Figure 9Influence of the stable transfection of the COOH-terminal domain of βARK1 (βARK-CT) on α2-adrenergic-stimulated tyrosyl phosphorylation of pp125FAK in α2AF2 preadipocytes. α2AF2 preadipocytes (A) and clone 50 (α2AF2 preadipocytes stably transfected with βARK-CT polypeptide) (B) were serum-starved and exposed to 1 μm UK14304 or 10% FCS treatment for time indicated. The level of tyrosyl phosphorylation of pp125FAK was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Values correspond to the mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments. Comparison with the control was performed using Student's t test: *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These results show that, in α2AF2 preadipocytes, βARK-CT-mediated blockade of Gβγ-subunits did not alter the α2-adrenergic-dependent regulation of cell spreading and focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation. The present study demonstrates that (i) the coupling between α2-adrenergic receptors and the small GTPase p21rhoA is involved in the α2-adrenergic-dependent regulation of preadipocyte actin cytoskeleton and pp125FAK and that (ii) conversely to the Ras/MAPK pathway, the Gi/Go-dependent activation of p21rhoA/cytoskeleton pathway does not involve the βγ-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. As described with other agents such as lysophosphatidic acid, sphingosine 1-phosphate, or thrombin (8Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar, 10Jalink K. Coven E.V. Hengeveld T. Morii T. Narumiya N. J.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), α2-adrenergic-dependent activation of actin cytoskeleton was blocked by C3 exoenzyme pretreatment, a toxin known to specifically suppress the activity p21rhoA (17Seckine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kikuchi A. Yamamoto K. Fujita T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16303-16308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under its active form (bound to GTP), p21rhoA plays a key role in the reorganization of the actin network, particularly in the formation of actin stress fibers, but also in the formation of focal adhesion plaques and the tyrosyl phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase (8Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar, 9Nobes C.D. Hall A.

Therefore, our results obtained with the C3 exoenzyme demonstrated the implication of p21rhoA in the α2-adrenergic-dependent regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and in the control of adhesion of the preadipocyte. This observation suggested the existence of a possible coupling between α2-adrenergic receptors and p21rhoA. This hypothesis was confirmed, since we demonstrated that α2-adrenergic receptor stimulation leads to the activation of GDP/GTP exchange on p21rhoA characterized by a rapid and transient increase in the p21rhoA-GTP form as previously demonstrated for p21ras (4Alblas J. van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Milligan G. Moolenaar W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22235-22238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation directly demonstrates the ability of the α2-adrenergic receptor to activate p21rhoA. α2-Adrenergic stimulation also leads to an increase in the amount of p21rhoAin the particulate fraction of α2AF2 preadipocytes. This observation can be interpreted as the result of the translocation of a fraction of RhoA from the cytosol to the plasma membrane as classically described for the GTPases of the Rho family (20Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33067-33073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 21Karnam P. Standaert M. Galloway L. Farese R. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is noticeable that whereas α2-adrenergic receptor-stimulated RhoA GTP loading was maximal within 2 min of stimulation, no significant translocation was observed until 15 min. This suggests that, in our model, RhoA translocation is not required for RhoA activation. Knowing the close relationship between cytoskeleton activity and protein translocation, it is possible that RhoA translocation is a consequence, rather than a cause, of RhoA-mediated reorganization of actin cytoskeleton. Another possibility is that RhoA translocation is independent of RhoA activation as proposed previously (33Kranenburg O. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2417-2427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further investigations will be necessary to test these hypotheses. In a previous study, we have demonstrated that the α2-adrenergic-dependent reorganization of actin cytoskeleton in preadipocytes was suppressed by pertussis toxin pretreatment of preadipocytes (7Bétuing S. Daviaud D. Valet P. Bouloumié A. Lafontan M. Saulnier-Blache J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5220-5229Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is reasonable to propose that the coupling between α2-adrenergic receptors and p21rhoA involves an heterotrimeric G protein of the Gi/Go family. Gi proteins have been demonstrated to be involved in the α2-adrenergic-dependent activation of p21ras, via the Gβγ-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (5Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12706-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 23Della Rocca G. van Biesen T. Daaka Y. Luttrell D. Luttrell L. Lefkowitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13132-19125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Since p21rhoA and p21ras belong to the same superfamily they potentially exhibit very similar mode of regulation. Therefore, the involvement of the Gβγ-subunits in the α2-adrenergic-dependent activation of p21rhoA could reasonably be suspected. Transient or permanent expression of βARK-CT, a Gβγ-binding protein, have been demonstrated as being a useful strategy to discriminate between α- and βγ-mediated pathways (6Koch W. Hawes B. Inglese J. Luttrell L. Lefkowitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that permanent transfection of βARK-CT in α2AF2 preadipocytes almost completely blocks the Gβγ-dependent activation of p21ras/MAPK pathway generated by α2-adrenergic receptor stimulation. This blockade appears to be specific of Gβγ, since the Gβγ-independent activation of p21ras/MAPK generated by growth factor-containing serum was not modified. Conversely to the Ras/MAPK pathway, the α2-adrenergic-dependent regulation of spreading and increase of tyrosyl phosphorylation of pp125FAK were not altered by Gβγ blockade. These data demonstrate that βγ-subunits are not involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton nor in the activation of the focal adhesion kinase, two p21rhoA-dependent controlled cellular events. Therefore, based on the action of pertussis toxin, it is likely that the Gβγ-independent coupling between α2-adrenergic receptors and p21rhoA in preadipocytes involves the αi/αo-subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins. We showed previously that α2AF2 preadipocytes express the three pertussis toxin-sensitive α-subunits, αi2, αi3 and αo, but not αi1 (24Bétuing S. Valet P. Lapalu S. Peyroulan D. Hickson G. Daviaud D. Lafontan M. Saulnier-Blache J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Further investigations will be necessary to determine which of these subunits are involved in α2-adrenergic-dependent activation of p21rhoA. The existence of a Gβγ-independent coupling between α2-adrenergic receptors and p21rhoA asks the question of its functional consequences in preadipocytes. Modifications of actin cytoskeleton are associated with numerous cellular events such as proliferation, differentiation, and motility (25Mabuchi I. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1853-1862PubMed Google Scholar, 26Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that α2-adrenergic receptor stimulation increases preadipocyte proliferation, an effect that is associated with the tyrosyl phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 MAPK (3Bouloumié A. Planat V. Devedjian J.-C. Valet P. Saulnier-Blache J.-S. Record M. Lafontan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30254-30259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), kinases which are dependent upon p21ras activation (27Howe L.R. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20717-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are implicated in cell cycle regulation (28Hill C. Treiman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). The results of the present study clearly demonstrate that p21rhoA is not involved in the α2-adrenergic-dependent activation of p21/MAPK pathway, since C3 exoenzyme was without effect on ERK2 activation. However, even though the precise mechanism has not been completely elucidated, it has clearly been demonstrated by several groups that Rho proteins are regulators of cell cycle regulation (29Yamamoto M. Marui N. Sakai T. Morii N. Kozaki S. Ikai K. Imamura S. Narumiya S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1449-1455PubMed Google Scholar,30Avraham H. Weinberg R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2058-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It has indeed been shown that C3 exoenzyme strongly inhibits the growth of several cell types (29Yamamoto M. Marui N. Sakai T. Morii N. Kozaki S. Ikai K. Imamura S. Narumiya S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1449-1455PubMed Google Scholar), including α2AF2 preadipocytes. 2S. Bétuing, personal communication. Therefore, it is reasonable to think that p21rhoA could be involved in the α2-adrenergic-dependent regulation of preadipocyte proliferation via an ERK-independent transduction pathway. Recently, Jinsi-Parimoo et al. (31Jinsi-Parimoo A. Deth R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14556-14561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) proposed that p21rhoA is involved in the α2-adrenergic stimulation of phospholipase D in PC12 cells. Phospholipase D is an enzyme involved in a broad spectrum of cellular events, including mitogenesis (32Exton J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Therefore, it could be proposed that α2-adrenergic-dependent regulation of preadipocyte proliferation could involve a p21rhoA-dependent activation of phospholipase D. In conclusion, this study emphasizes that in preadipocytes, in addition to their involvement in the activation of the Gβγ-dependent p21ras/MAPK pathway, α2-adrenergic receptors can also activate the p21rhoA/cytoskeleton pathway in a Gβγ-independent manner. Control of p21rhoA activity and actin cytoskeleton not only plays an important role in cell morphological changes but is also crucial for cell cycle regulation. Therefore, depending on each kind of subunit (βγ or αi/αo) the combined Gi/Go-mediated stimulation of p21rasand p21rhoA can cooperate in the mediation of the α2-adrenergic receptor-dependent regulation of preadipocyte proliferation and/or differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2316208978,"We have studied the involvement of murine c-Crk, an SH2/SH3 containing adaptor protein, in signaling pathways stimulated by different receptor tyrosine kinases. We show here that c-Crk is associated with components of insulin- and PDGF-dependent signaling pathways. Insulin treatment of murine myoblast cells induces the formation of stable complex of endogenous c-Crk with insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) mediated via the SH2 domain of Crk. The ligand dependent physical association of c-Crk with IRS-1 is direct. However IRS-1 is also co-precipitated with c-Crk from quiescent L6 cells. The association of IRS-1 with c-Crk in quiescent cells is probably not direct since Far Western blot analysis did not reveal the binding of neither SH2 domain nor amino-terminal SH3 domain of c-Crk to IRS-1 from unstimulated cells. We also show that PDGF treatment of murine myoblast cells induces association of c-Crk with the PDGF receptor and tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Crk. Overexpression of c-Crk enhanced insulin- but not PDGF-induced activation of MAP kinases when compared to parental cell lines. Thus, the formation of the direct IRS-1/Crk complex appears to be crucial for Crk-mediated insulin-induced activation of MAP kinase, whereas Crk is probably involved in other PDGF-induced responses. These data provide support to the hypothesis that insulin and PDGF employ different mechanisms for activation of MAP kinase cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1999516814,"Proteins of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family play diverse roles in embryonic development, angiogenesis, and wound healing. The most well studied targets of FGF activity typically are cells of mesodermal and neuroectodermal origin; in addition, expression of FGF-1 (acidic FGF) is increased at several sites of chronic immunologic injury, and recent studies show that FGF-1 also may interact with cells of the immune system. In some human T cells, FGF-1 can induce signals necessary for production of interleukin-2, a key cytokine required for T cell proliferation. To better characterize the interaction of FGF-1 with FGF receptors on T cells, a fusion protein was constructed containing a portion of the constant region of human IgG1 (Fc) at the amino terminus of FGF-1. The Fc-FGF-1 fusion protein retained FGF function as determined by stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA synthesis in NIH 3T3 cells. Binding of the intact fusion protein to FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) on T cells was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of the receptor bound to Fc-FGF-1 and by flow cytometry showing binding of fusion protein to T cells expressing FGFR1. This functional Fc-FGF-1 protein should prove useful in identifying FGFR-expressing cells."
