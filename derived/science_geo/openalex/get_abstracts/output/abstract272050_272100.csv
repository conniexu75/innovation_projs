https://openalex.org/W2009992333,"Situated adjacent to the largest Northern Hemispher ice sheets of the ice ages, the mid-latitude North Atlantic Ocean has an important role in the earth's climate history. It provides a significant local source of moisture for the atmosphere and adjacent continents, forms a corridor that guides moisture-bearing storms northward from low latitudes, and at times makes direct contact along its shorelines with continental ice masses. Evidence of major ice-ocean-air interactions involving the North Atlantic during the last 250,000 years is summarized. Outflow of icebergs and meltwater initially driven by summer insolation over the ice sheets affects midlatitude ocean temperatures, summer heat storage, winter sea-ice extent, and global sea level. These oceanic responses in turn influence the winter moisture flux back to the ice sheets, as well as ablation of land ice by calving. Spectral data indicate that the oceanic moisture and sea-level feedbacks, in part controlled by glacial melt products, amplify Milankovitch (insolation) forcing of the volumetrically dominant mid-latitude ice sheets at the 23,000-year precessional cycle."

The total column abundance of sodium was estimated to be 8.1 x 10(11) atoms per square centimeter, which corresponds to a surface density at the subsolar point of about 1.5 x 10(5) atoms per cubic centimeter. The most abundant atmospheric species found by the Mariner 10 mission to Mercury was helium, with a surface density of 4.5 x 10(3) atoms per cubic centimeter. It now appears that sodium vapor is a major constituent of Mercury's atmosphere."

Although similar behavior in primates has been attributed to a self-concept or other cognitive process, the present example suggests an account in terms of environmental events."
https://openalex.org/W2062552134,"Deep Sea Drilling Project site 289 in the western equatorial Pacific has yielded an extremely detailed record of the carbon and oxygen isotopic changes in the Miocene deep ocean. The isotopic record reflects major changes in paleoclimate and paleoceanography, probably dominated by a major phase of Antarctic ice-cap growth. The transition from a relatively unglaciated world to one similar to today occurred between 16.5 x 10(6) and 13 x 10(6) years before the present, with the greatest change occurring between approximately 14.8 x 10(6) and 14.0 x 10(6) years before the present."
https://openalex.org/W1989814950,"Sulfate inhibits molybdate assimilation by phytoplankton, making molybdate less available in seawater than it is in freshwater. As a result, nitrogen fixation and nitrate assimilation, both processes that require molybdenum, may require a greater expenditure of energy in seawater than in freshwater. This may explain in part why coastal marine ecosystems are usually nitrogen limited whereas lakes usually are not. Experimentally increasing the ratio of sulfate to molybdate (i) inhibits molybdate uptake, (ii) slows nitrogen fixation rates, and (iii) slows the growth of organisms that use nitrate as their nitrogen source."
https://openalex.org/W1977769811,"Morphometric analyses based on three-dimensional reconstruction of the nuclei of four different strains of the symbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium microadriaticum, the algae that inhabit corals, giant clams, and other marine invertebrates, revealed marked differences in chromosome numbers and chromosome volumes. The differences are not consistent with different ploidy states within the same species, but can most easily be interpreted as indicating different species."
https://openalex.org/W2010861042,"Experimental evidence is presented supporting a developmental model that explains the genetic basis for brain and body size associations. Evolutionary change in body size causes correlated change in brain size because some genes affect both traits. The commonly observed correlation between brain and body size results from genetic variation in growth determinants affecting both traits simultaneously during fetal and early postnatal growth. Later growth reduces brain-body correlation because of changes in the underlying causal components of growth in each trait. Brain-body size evolution shows a different pattern at higher taxonomic levels from that seen within and between closely related species because body-size evolution among higher taxa occurs primarily by change in early portions of growth, which share more genetic growth determinants with brain size."
https://openalex.org/W2093282560,"Salicin, a toxic phenol glycoside, is used by larvae of the beetle Chrysomela aenicollis as a substrate for producing defensive secretions. In the east-central Sierra Nevada mountains of California, salicin concentrations ranged from 0.05 percent to over 5 percent of dry weight in leaves of different plants of Salix orestera, the Sierra willow. Beetles produced more secretion and suffered less predation on willows containing more salicin. In addition, leaf damage due to herbivory among 16 willow clones ranged from 0 to 20 percent of leaf area and was linearly related to salicin content. These results illustrate how a plant secondary chemical can become a problem for the plant when herbivores are adapted to use the chemical for their own benefit. The results also show the effect of a plant chemical on three trophic levels—the producer, a herbivore, and the predators of the herbivore."

Other dolphin sounds, such as clicks and complex buzzes, are produced by vibrations of the tissue of the nasal plugs, apparently without the use of the larynx; in these instances, the air sacs act as reservoirs. This was determined from studies of Tursiops truncatus and Delphinus delphis with harmless ultrasonic beams projected noninvasively to determine movements of the air sacs."
https://openalex.org/W2020822623,"Laboratory exposure experiments demonstrate that carbonyl sulfide in wet air corrodes copper at 22 degrees C at a rate that is approximately linear with total exposure (the product of exposure time and carbonyl sulfide concentration). The corrosion rate is similar to that of hydrogen sulfide, a widely recognized corrodant. The much greater average atmospheric abundance of carbonyl sulfide compared with that of hydrogen sulfide or sulfur dioxide suggests that carbonyl sulfide may be a major agent of atmospheric sulfur corrosion."
https://openalex.org/W2054613957,"The results of an in situ study of calcite dissolution in the Panama Basin indicate that the rate of dissolution in the water column increases suddenly below a water depth of about 2800 meters. This coincides with the depth at which the calcium carbonate content of surface sediments begins to decrease rapidly or the sedimentary lysocline. Since this level of increased dissolution both in the water column and on the sea floor does not appear to be related to the transition from supersaturation to undersaturation with respect to carbonate, there may be a kinetic origin for the lysocline in this region."
https://openalex.org/W2000713518,"Lower crustal granulite xenoliths recovered from a kimberlite pipe in western Africa contain native iron (Fe0) as a decomposition product of garnet and ilmenite. Magnetic measurements show that less than 0.1 percent (by volume) of iron metal is present. Data from geothermometry and oxygen geobarometry indicate that the oxide and metal phases equilibrated between iron-wüstite and magnetite-wüstite buffers, which may represent the oxidation state of the continental lower crust, and the depleted lithospheric upper mantle. Ferromagnetic native iron could be stable to a depth of ≃ 95 kilometers and should be considered in the interpretation of long-wavelength static magnetic anomalies."

https://openalex.org/W1965485568,The theoretical yield of H(2)O(2) formed during the oxidation of a virucidal solution of ascorbic acid approximates the virucidal action of an equivalent amount of H(2)O(2). Both the action of ascorbic acid and H(2)O(2) are completely neutralized by catalase. The action of ascorbic acid against influence A virus may therefore be explained as being due to the H(2)O(2) formed during the Cu catalyzed oxidation of ascorbic acid. The observed in vitro virucidal activity of ascorbic acid obviously can not be utilized therapeutically because of the presence of catalase in body tissues.
https://openalex.org/W2013038553,"Barotropic instability waves on a shear interface propagate at the average speed of the water on the two sides. Assuming the instability to be excited by tidal oscillations, the phase speed is the wavelength divided by the tidal period. If the water is at rest on one side of the shear layer the current speed on the other side can be calculated. This method, applied to the Gulf Stream beyond Cape Hatteras as seen in satellite images, gives estimates of current speed in general agreement with in situ observations."

https://openalex.org/W2007389377,"Federal regulations and concerns about accountability for public funds have added greatly to the administrative burden associated with federal support of research at universities. Much of the added burden is viewed as unnecessary and counterproductive by the scientists and administrators who must bear the load. They feel that funds and effort intended for research are being diverted and wasted. The various types of costs are reviewed, including some thoughts as to their origin and estimates of their magnitude. Topics covered include project versus programmatic support, the indirect cost game, accountability, federal regulations, and the bureaucratic syndrome. There are no simple solutions, but several promising initiatives have been taken and more should be forthcoming."
