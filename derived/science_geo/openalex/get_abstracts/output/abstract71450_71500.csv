https://openalex.org/W1501912047,"Abstract Methyl Cellosolve (the monomethyl ether of ethylene glycol) has been widely used as the organic solvent in ninhydrin reagents for amino acid analysis; it has, however, properties that are disadvantageous in a reagent for everyday employment. The solvent is toxic and it is difficult to keep the ether peroxide-free. A continuing effort to arrive at a chemically preferable and relatively nontoxic substitute for methyl Cellosolve has led to experiments with dimethyl sulfoxide, which proves to be a better solvent for the reduced form of ninhydrin (hydrindantin) than is methyl Cellosolve. Dimethyl sulfoxide can replace the latter, volume for volume, in a ninhydrin reagent mixture that gives equal performance and has improved stability. The result is a ninhydrin-hydrindantin solution in 75% dimethyl sulfoxide-25% 4 m lithium acetate buffer at pH 5.2. This type of mixture, with appropriate hydrindantin concentrations, is recommended to replace methyl Cellosolve-containing reagents in the quantitative determination of amino acids by automatic analyzers and by the manual ninhydrin method."

https://openalex.org/W105515906,"The experiments described in this communication were carried out in order to investigate the usefulness of phenylglyoxal as a reagent for the chemical modification of arginine residues in proteins. Phenylglyoxal reacts with the guanido group of the arginine residue under mild conditions, pH 7 to 8 and 25°. The derivative, which contains two phenylglyoxal moieties per guanido group, is sufficiently stable, particularly under mildly acidic conditions (below pH 4) to permit the isolation of labeled peptides. At neutral or alkaline pH values, the derivative is decomposed slowly. About 80% of the original arginine can be regenerated by incubation of the derivative in the absence of excess reagent for 48 hours at 37° and about pH 7. Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (0.5% solution) is inactivated to the extent of 80 to 90% within 30 min by reaction with a 1.5% solution of phenylglyoxal at pH 8.0 and 25°. Of the 4 arginine residues in the molecule, 2 to 3 are modified. Analysis of tryptic-chymotryptic hydrolysates of the inactivated protein show that condensation occurs primarily at arginine residues 39 and 85 in the sequence. These are the 2 arginine residues which x-ray diffraction studies have shown to be closest to the active site of the enzyme. In this modified ribonuclease, the 2 histidine residues, 12 and 119, continue to be susceptible to specific alkylation by iodoacetate. In general, phenylglyoxal (14C-labeled, if desired) may be useful for modification of accessible arginine residues in proteins and may be potentially useful for reversible coverage of arginine residues so that tryptic hydrolysis can take place at lysine residues only. When proteins are treated with a large excess of the reagent for a long period, reaction may also occur with e-amino groups of lysine residues. In all cases, any available α-amino group is deaminated to give a residue of the corresponding α-keto acid. The reagent is very effective in deaminating small peptides to the corresponding α-keto acyl peptides, thus permitting the identification of the end groups by subtractive analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1546233377,"A deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase from Micrococcus luteus has been isolated by allowing it to bind to its substrate, DNA, attached to a solid matrix of cellulose and subsequent detachment from the DNA by high salt concentrations. This approach has permitted the isolation of a highly purified enzyme by easy and reproducible methods from a partially purified preparation in which the polymerase is only a minor constituent. The enzyme preparations are quite active with DNA primers, almost entirely free of endo- or exonucleases, and extremely stable in the presence of DNA and other nucleotide polymers, or in high salt solution. At low salt concentrations, however, activity is rapidly lost. The active polymerase in high salt has a sedimentation rate of about 7 S. Kinetic studies indicate that the interactions between the polymerase-DNA structure and the deoxynucleoside triphosphates and Mg++ or Mn++ are complex. It can be calculated from DNA saturation data that there are only one or two sites of initiation on helical linear DNA molecules, and that reinitiation on a synthetic complex does not occur. DNA synthesis stops when a doubling of the added primer is reached."
https://openalex.org/W1532309638,"Aryl hydroxylase, derived from hamster fetus cells grown in culture, is an inducible microsomal enzyme system which requires NADPH and molecular oxygen. The addition of benz[a]anthracene or other polycyclic hydrocarbons to the culture medium causes significant increases in the amount of hydroxylase activity: after a lag period of 35 min, the level of hydroxylase activity increases linearly for 16 to 32 hours, at which time the levels are 15- to 40-fold higher than that of control cells. Under similar conditions, neither corticosteroids nor phenobarbital has any effect on the aryl hydroxylase activity. The ability to induce the hydroxylase activity is greatest in cells entering logarithmic growth phase and in secondary and tertiary cultures. Aryl hydroxylase is also induced in fetal cells from mouse and rat; induction is much lower in chick and guinea pig. The aryl hydroxylase enzyme system is inducible in hamster fetus cells derived from lung, small intestine, liver, limb, and brain, and is greatest in cells from older fetuses. The carbon monoxide-binding microsomal cytochrome from cells exposed to benz[a]anthracene has an absorption peak at 446 mµ, compared to 450 mµ for the microsomal fraction from control cells. This alteration may be related to the increased aryl hydroxylase activity. The addition of actinomycin D, puromycin, or cycloheximide simultaneously with benz[a]anthracene completely prevents the induction of hydroxylase activity. In cells previously induced for 25 hours, either the removal of inducer or the addition of puromycin (with or without inducer) causes a fall in aryl hydroxylase activity after 3 hours. The half-life of the induced enzyme activity is 3.3 ± 1.2 hours. The addition of actinomycin D, alone or with inducer, to previously induced cells causes a greater increase in enzyme activity for 4 hours than does benz[a]anthracene alone. These studies suggest that the induction of aryl hydroxylase activity involves an activation of specific genes and changes in their transcription into messenger RNA."

https://openalex.org/W1519132974,"Acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase is activated strongly by incubation with magnesium ions in the absence of citrate and by incubation with citrate in the absence of magnesium ions. The activation by magnesium ions is concentration- and time-dependent. Under optimum conditions the effects of citrate and magnesium ions are not additive. Although the activation by magnesium ions occurs in the absence of citrate, the enzyme requires citrate for the complete reaction. Addition of adenosine triphosphate to the activation medium containing either magnesium ions or citrate or both strongly inhibits the activation of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase. The inhibition is not due to removal of magnesium ions by chelation with adenosine triphosphate. Enzyme which has been activated with magnesium ions sediments at about the same rate as the inactive enzyme. Palmitoyl carnitine and cetyl trimethylammonium ions also stimulate the activity of the enzyme. This type of activation occurs rapidly, unlike the activation of the rat liver enzyme by magnesium ions and citrate. The maximum degree of stimulation by palmitoyl carnitine is observed when acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase has not been fully activated with other activators, but a 2- to 3-fold stimulation is observed even with enzyme which has been activated optimally with magnesium ions and citrate."

https://openalex.org/W1616100324,"Abstract The complete amino acid sequence of Micrococcus aerogenes ferredoxin was determined with the use of the S-β-aminoethylcysteinyl (Cys(AE)) derivative of the protein. The protein molecule consists of a single polypeptide chain of 54 amino acid residues. The sequence was found to be Ala-Tyr-Val-Ile-Asn-Asp-Ser-Cys(AE)-Ile-Ala-Cys(AE)-Gly-Ala-Cys(AE)-Lys-Pro-Glu-Cys(AE)-Pro-Val-Asn-Ile -Gln-Gln-Gly-Ser-Ile-Tyr-Ala-Ile-Asp-Ala-Asp-Ser-Cys-(AE)-Ile-Asp-Cys(AE)-Gly-Ser-Cys(AE)-Ala-Ser-Val-Cys(AE)-Pro-Val-Gly-Ala-Pro-Asn-Pro-Glu-Asp. In comparing the sequence of M. aerogenes ferredoxin with those of the Clostridium pasteurianum and Clostridium butyricum ferredoxins, it is necessary to assume certain deletions or insertions in order to align the various ferredoxins. When the M. aerogenes sequence is thus compared with the sequences of the C. pasteurianum and C. butyricum ferredoxins, there are 39 and 38 matching residues, respectively. The positions of the 8 cysteine residues were found to be invariant in the three bacterial ferredoxins. Each of the three bacterial ferredoxins appears to consist of two nearly symmetrical half-molecules of 26 to 28 residues. The possible importance of these findings for the active site as well as for the evolutionary development of these nonheme iron-proteins is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2068926746,"Data on pulmonary gas exchange were collected in breathhold dives to 90 feet in a tank and in open-sea breathhold dives to depths of 217.5 and 225 feet. Thoracic blood volume displacements were measured at depths of 25, 50, 90, and 130 feet, by use of the impedance plethysmograph. The open-sea dives were carried out with an average speed of descent of 3.95 feet per second and an average rate of ascent of 3.50 feet per second. End-dive alveolar oxygen tensions did not fall below 36 millimeters of mercury, while alveolar carbon dioxide tension did not rise above 40 millimeters of mercury except in one case. These findings indicate that for diver Croft, who has unusual lung capacity, neither hypoxia nor hypercapnia determined the depth limits under those conditions. At depths of 90 and 130 feet blood was forced into the thorax, amounting to 1047 and 850 milliliters respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2026634090,"Freshwater lake marl and mollusks from Indiana show variations in ratios of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 of a few per mil during the Postglacial. For the last 9000 years these variations are about 1 per mil for properly selected lake sediments. Thus the oxygen isotope composition of atmospheric precipitation appears relatively stable over this interval, indicating stationary atmospheric circulation patterns over the Great Lakes region. A reduction in oxygen-18 content around 10,000 years ago corresponds with the climate change indicated by pollen profiles. Large systematic differences were found between carbon-13 and oxygen-18 content of marl and mollusks."

https://openalex.org/W1546733051,"Several different experimental approaches have shown the presence of tryptophan in malate dehydrogenase from pig heart mitochondria. The methods used were (a) fluorescence measurement of tryptophan content after acid hydrolysis and separation of amino acids by paper chromatography, (b) recovery of tryptophan labeled with tritium after incubation of the enzyme with tritiated substrates, (c) determination of tryptophan content of acid and alkaline hydrolysates with the amino acid analyzer and (after silylation) by gas chromatography, (d) the ultraviolet spectral method of Edelhoch (Biochemistry, 6, 1948 (1967)), and (e) determination of tryptophan by reaction with 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide. The estimation of tryptophan by fluorescence, tritium-labeling, the amino acid analyzer, or gas chromatography of acid or alkaline hydrolysates usually indicated 0.3 to 1.1 residues per molecule of enzyme, whereas the two nonhydrolytic methods (ultraviolet absorption and reaction with 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide) indicated about 2 tryptophanyl residues per molecule of enzyme. The protein acquires about 0.5 atom of tritium per molecule of enzyme from labeled substrate under conditions similar to the previously reported labeling of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase and rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase. The positive results in three different DPN-linked enzymes suggest that in some members, at least, of this class of enzymes dehydrogenation of an enzyme tryptophanyl residue takes place through the intermediacy of an indolenine or equivalent structure. The structure of the adduct of 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide with 3-methylindole was determined as a model for the primary adduct of the reagent with protein tryptophanyl residues."

https://openalex.org/W2169385136,"Abstract The effect of modification of amino and guanidinium groups of rabbit antibodies directed against the negatively charged p-azobenzenearsonate hapten (anti-Rp antibodies) was studied. Purified antibodies from either a single rabbit or from serum pooled from several rabbits lost at least 85 to 90% of their combining sites when 100% of their amino groups were selectively modified with maleic anhydride and 75 to 80% of their guanidinium groups were modified by subsequent treatment with glyoxal. However, they lost 50% or less of their combining sites when only the amino groups were modified. The loss of combining sites could be prevented by the presence of specific hapten (p-nitrobenzenearsonate) during the modification reactions. These results suggest that some anti-Rp antibodies have combining sites which contain guanidinium groups, while others have combining sites which contain amino groups. It was possible to separate these antibody molecules into two such populations. Maleylated anti-Rp antibody molecules were separated into two fractions with a specific solid immunoadsorbent. Approximately half of the maleylated antibodies remained in the solution because they had lost their combining sites as a result of maleylation of an amino group in the combining sites. It was possible to recover completely the antibody activity by removing most of the maleyl groups by acid hydrolysis. These antibodies did not contain glyoxal-reactive groups in their combining sites because treatment with glyoxal either before or after hydrolysis of the maleyl groups resulted in no loss of antibody combining sites. The second fraction of the maleylated antibodies, those which were adsorbed on the solid immunoadsorbent, was eluted and treated again with maleic anhydride, and their combining sites were found to be 100% effective. This showed that there were no amino groups in the combining sites of these antibodies. When these antibodies were treated subsequently with glyoxal, 75% of their combining sites were lost, showing the presence of glyoxal-reactive groups in these sites. Modification with both maleic anhydride and glyoxal of antibodies directed against a positively charged (p-azophenyltrimethylammonium) hapten and a neutral (3-azopyridine) hapten did not result in any losses of combining sites, showing that these antibodies did not contain amino- or glyoxalreactive groups in their combining sites. This investigation showed the presence and separation of at least two distinct populations of anti-Rp antibody molecules —those with combining sites containing guanidinium or other glyoxal-reactive groups and no amino groups, and those with combining sites containing amino groups and no other glyoxal-reactive groups. Amino acid analyses of the glyoxal-modified antibodies showed that arginyl residues had been irreversibly modified. No evidence was found that any other residues had been modified. However, the possibility still exists that other residues were modified, but that the modification was reversed during hydrolysis of the antibodies. Nevertheless, the immunochemical evidence is that the important group altered was a guanidinium group, since only antibodies directed against negatively charged haptens are affected while antibodies directed against neutral and positively charged haptens are not affected."

https://openalex.org/W2079010813,"CLASSICAL, imprinting of precocial birds has been studied in the laboratory for some 20 years. Suggestions have also been made over a similar period about the imprinting of precocial mammals, but no systematic experiments specifically concerned with imprinting have been reported so far. Although Shipley's study of guinea-pigs1 referred to imprinting, in reality it was concerned with the approaches and following responses of these animals to moving objects. Imprinting involves more than that, namely an attachment to a given figure, and this can be readily assessed in a discrimination test2. The experiment reported here describes imprinting in young guinea-pigs, judged in terms of the animals' preference for familiar, compared with strange, objects."

https://openalex.org/W1498958474,"The chemistry of the active site of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease has been further examined by study of the reaction of iodoacetic acid with histidine residues 12 and 119 in derivatives of the protein. In the native enzyme, the stereospecific alkylation of the two imidazole rings is a mutually exclusive, electrostatically oriented reaction leading to a 7:1 ratio of substitution at residues 119 and 12. When inactive des-(121–124)-ribonuclease, prepared by limited peptic hydrolysis according to the method of Anfinsen, is exposed to iodoacetate at pH 5.5, alkylation at histidine-119 is nearly abolished but the reaction at histidine-12 is accelerated. If, as has been assumed for the native enzyme, 1 protonated histidine residue orients the reagent for the alkylation of the unprotonated form of the other, this result with the derivative is interpretable in terms of an increase in the pK of the imidazole ring of histidine-119 accompanying the removal of -Asp-Ala-Ser-Val from the carboxyl end of the chain. In turn, this change in pK would alter the precise interaction between the two imidazole rings which are essential for catalytic action; such a shift could account for the inactivity of the des-(121–124)-derivative. To support this interpretation of the alkylation of des-(121–124)-ribonuclease, further information on the alkylation reaction itself was sought. The influence of neighboring groups on the course of the alkylation of ribonuclease has been studied with two derivatives in which lysine residues have been modified. When the positive charge on lysine-7 is neutralized by acetylation of the S-peptide, by the procedure of Richards and Vithayathil, the resulting active Nα, ϵ-diAcLys-1-, Nϵ-Lys(Ac)-7-ribonuclease S is alkylated by iodoacetate mainly on histidine-119, as in the unaltered enzyme. The alkylation also proceeds similarly with the inactive ϵ-Lys(DNP)-41-ribonuclease. These results eliminate the possibility that the positive charges on the ϵ-NH2 groups of lysine-7 and lysine-41 have a role in the orientation of ICH2COO−."
https://openalex.org/W1538810944,"Alkali metal ions activate adenylate deaminase from calf brain by increasing the apparent affinity of the enzyme for AMP. The enzyme is inhibited, but not inactivated, at high ionic strength. Inhibition of the enzyme by guanosine triphosphate is reversed by lithium ions, and less well by sodium ions. Potassium ions cause only a slight reversal of the GTP inhibition, and this only at relatively high concentrations. GTP decreases the apparent affinity of the enzyme for lithium ions. Alkali metal ions have little or no effect on the inhibition of the enzyme by iso-AMP. Magnesium ions are not required for the activation of the enzyme by ATP or for its inhibition by GTP. For a given concentration of ATP there is a range of magnesium ion concentrations over which the apparent affinity of the enzyme for AMP is increased."

This enzyme is an exonuclease that hydrolyzes polyribonucleotides to nucleoside 5'-monophosphates. Both a monovalent and a divalent cation are required for optimum activity. The enzyme has no marked specificity for particular nucleoside residues, but it prefers single stranded substrates.

https://openalex.org/W1536963498,"Abstract Comparative studies have been made with respect to tryptic activation and the substrate specificity after activation of chymotrypsinogen A and its derivative X. The X protein, in which as many as 15 amino groups are converted to their neutral carbamylated derivatives, was isolated from a heated solution of the A zymogen in 8 m urea and was twice crystallized as described previously. At pH 8 and low ionic strength the activation reactions of trypsin with the positively charged A and with the negatively charged X form of the zymogen are entirely different, but little or no difference is observed at high ionic strength. The rate of hydrolysis of denatured serum albumin by activated X at low ionic strength is considerably lower than that by the activated A zymogen. This difference is also abolished at high ionic strength. At low, but not at high, ionic strength the affinity of a negatively charged substrate, such as m-hexoyloxybenzoate, for activated X is considerably lower than for the activated A zymogen. The ionic strength has little effect on the maximal rate of hydrolysis (Vmax) by either the activated A or the activated X form of the zymogen. In general, the potential zymogenic capacity of chymotrypsinogen is not decreased by converting the A form to the X form and little or no effect on the substrate specificity is noted with respect to the relative maximal rates of hydrolysis of N-acetyltyrosine ethyl ester, methylhippurate, and a homologous series of n-fatty acid esters. The results indicate that the formation of the precise zymogenic structure from the unfolded protein is not affected by the present modification. The apparent absence of a charge effect emphasizes the involvement of hydrophobic groups in determining the three-dimensional structure of the zymogen and the substrate specificity of the enzyme."
