We have previously shown that the ERK1/2 pathway acts independently of PI3K to block expression of the BH3-only protein, BimEL, and prevent serum withdrawal-induced cell death, although the precise mechanism by which ERK reduced BimEL levels was unclear. By comparing Bim mRNA and Bim protein, expression we now show that the rapid expression of BimEL following serum withdrawal cannot be accounted for simply by increases in mRNA following inhibition of PI3K. In cells maintained in serum BimEL is a phosphoprotein. We show that activation of the ERK1/2 pathway is both necessary and sufficient to promote BimEL phosphorylation and that this leads to a substantial increase in turnover of the BimEL protein. ERK1/2-dependent degradation of BimEL proceeds via the proteasome pathway because it is blocked by proteasome inhibitors and is defective at the restrictive temperature in cells with a temperature-sensitive mutation in the E1 component of the ubiquitin-conjugating system. Finally, co-transfection of BimEL and FLAG-ubiquitin causes the accumulation of polyubiquitinated forms of Bim, and this requires the ERK1/2 pathway. Our findings provide new insights into the regulation of Bim and the role of the ERK pathway in cell survival.

Our findings provide new insights into the regulation of Bim and the role of the ERK pathway in cell survival. Higher eukaryotes possess two major pathways for initiating programmed cell death or apoptosis: the cell-extrinsic death pathway, involving death receptors, or the cell-intrinsic pathway (1Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3338) Google Scholar). Apoptosis following withdrawal of survival factors typically proceeds via the cell-intrinsic pathway because it is regulated by Bcl-2 proteins. Pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bak can disrupt the outer mitochondrial membrane and promote the release of apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c (1Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3338) Google Scholar), but in viable cells they are normally repressed by binding to pro-survival proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL.

Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3338) Google Scholar, 2Puthalakath H. Strasser A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Thus, BH3-only proteins act at the interface between stress signaling pathways and the core apoptotic machinery and are subject to many forms of regulation (2Puthalakath H. Strasser A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Some BH3-only genes are transcriptionally regulated; for example, Puma is up-regulated by p53 in response to DNA damage (3Nakano K. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar), whereas Hrk/DP5 is up-regulated by NGF withdrawal (4Imaizumi K. Tsuda M. Imai Y. Wanaka A. Takagi T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18842-18848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Other BH3-only proteins are regulated by post-translational modifications; for example, caspase-8 cleaves Bid to yield an “activated” version called tBid (5Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3790) Google Scholar). Withdrawal of serum or defined survival factors results in the inactivation of the Raf-MEK-ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K)/PKB survival signaling pathways. Two BH3-only proteins, Bad and Bim, have been implicated particularly in apoptosis following withdrawal of survival factors, and both are regulated by these signaling pathways. Bad is phosphorylated by PKB (6Datta S.R. Katsov A. Hu L. Petros A. Fesik S.W. Yaffe M.B. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) and RSK1 (7Shimamura A. Ballif B.A. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 127-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), which facilitates it's sequestration by 14-3-3 proteins thereby preventing it from binding to Bcl-2. Withdrawal of survival factors results in the dephosphorylation of Bad, allowing it to bind to Bcl-xL and release Bax. In contrast, Bim is expressed de novo following withdrawal of survival factors or inactivation of the PI3K pathway (8Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1201-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 9Putcha G.V. Moulder K.L. Golden J.P. Bouillet P. Adams J.A. Strasser A. Johnson Jr, E.M.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In neurons the withdrawal of NGF results in activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-c-Jun pathway; this is required for increases in Bim mRNA (10Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Paquet L. Bernard O. Ham J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 629-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In contrast, in lymphocytes withdrawal of cytokines causes the inactivation of PKB, dephosphorylation of the forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1/FOXO-3A, and transcription of Bim (8Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1201-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). In CCl39 cells, we have previously shown that, following serum withdrawal, the initiation of Bax activation and subsequent activation of caspases are both strongly inhibited by actinomycin D and cycloheximide (11Weston C. Balmanno K. Chalmers C. Hadfield K. Molton S. Ley R. Wagner E.F. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that de novo expression of Bim rather than dephosphorylation of pre-existing Bad is the most likely mechanism by which serum withdrawal-induced death is initiated. In these cells the (extracellular signal-related kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) pathway acts independently of PI3K to prevent Bim expression and serum withdrawal-induced cell death, although the precise mechanism by which ERK reduces Bim levels is unclear (11Weston C. Balmanno K. Chalmers C. Hadfield K. Molton S. Ley R. Wagner E.F. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). By comparing Bim mRNA and Bim protein expression, we now show that the rapid expression of BimEL following serum withdrawal cannot be accounted for simply by increases in mRNA following down-regulation of the PI3K/PKB pathway. We show that BimEL is phosphorylated in response to activation of the ERK1/2 pathway and that this targets BimEL for degradation by the proteasome pathway. Our findings provide new insights into the regulation of Bim and the role of the ERK pathway in cell survival. Materials—Cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen.

The ts20 CHO cells (14Kulka R.G. Raboy B. Schuster R. Parag H.A. Diamond G. Ciechanover A. Marcus M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15726-15731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in minimal Eagle's medium containing a HEPES buffer. For serum starvation, cells judged to be 50–60% confluent were washed once in serum-free medium and then placed in fresh serum-free medium with the indicated dose of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT), FBS, inhibitors, or the relevant vehicle control for the times indicated in the figure legends. For emetine chase experiments, cells were starved for 18 h and then treated with emetine (10 μm) to block protein synthesis prior to further treatments. Cells were harvested at the indicated times for further analysis. Real-time RT-PCR—Preparation of total RNA was performed as described previously (11Weston C. Balmanno K. Chalmers C. Hadfield K. Molton S. Ley R. Wagner E.F. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed according to the protocol supplied with the Taqman® Reverse Transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems) as described previously (11Weston C. Balmanno K. Chalmers C. Hadfield K. Molton S. Ley R. Wagner E.F. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). For hamster Bim we used 5′-TAAGGCAATCTCAGGAGGAACCT-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-AGATTCGTTGAACTCGTCTCCAA-3′ as the reverse primer. These primers are common to BimS, BimL, and BimEL. For hamster β-actin we used 5′-CCGGATGCAGAAGGAGATCA-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-GCCACCGATCCACACAGAGTA-3′ as the reverse primer. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed and analyzed by Western blot exactly as described previously (11Weston C. Balmanno K. Chalmers C. Hadfield K. Molton S. Ley R. Wagner E.F. Cook S.J.

For treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase, cells were lysed in lysis buffer without phosphatase inhibitors and then treated with 10 units of calf intestinal phosphatase in the presence of the appropriate buffer for 2 h at 37 °C. Plasmids and Transfections—HA-tagged BimEL was constructed by subcloning rat BimEL from the plasmid pcDNA-FLAG-BimEL (provided by Drs. Stephen Neame and Jonathan Ham) into the pcDNA3-HA plasmid. In-frame fusion to the HA sequence was confirmed by sequencing and by transient expression and immunoblotting. 2Details are available from authors upon request. pcDNA-FLAG-ubiquitin was kindly provided by Dr. Paul Evans (The Babraham Institute). HEK293 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.33-16.36Google Scholar). HA-tagged Bim was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using either mouse anti-HA antibodies conjugated to protein G-Sepharose beads or rabbit anti-HA antibodies conjugated to protein A-Sepharose. Expression of BimELCannot Be Accounted for by Increases in mRNA following Inhibition of PI3K—Bim is an important mediator of apoptosis in response to loss of survival signals (8Dijkers P.F.

There are three major splice variants of Bim, short, long, and extra long (BimS, BimL, and BimEL, respectively) (16Bouillet P. Zhang L.C. Huang D.C. Webb G.C. Bottema C.D. Shore P. Eyre H.J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar), although other forms have recently been reported (19U M. Miyashita T. Shikama Y. Tadokoro K. Yamada M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Marani M. Tenev T. Hancock D. Downward J. Lemoine N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3577-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In most cell types, including CCl39 cells (11Weston C. Balmanno K. Chalmers C. Hadfield K. Molton S. Ley R. Wagner E.F. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), BimEL is the major species expressed, with some cell types expressing little or none of the other forms (9Putcha G.V. Moulder K.L. Golden J.P. Bouillet P. Adams J.A. Strasser A. Johnson Jr, E.M. Neuron. 2001; 29: 615-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In hematopoietic cell lines, such as Ba/F3, removal of cytokines results in loss of PI3K activity and dephosphorylation of PKB, leading to activation of the forkhead transcription factor (FKHR-L1/FOXO-3A) and an increase in expression of Bim (8Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1201-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). In CCl39 fibroblasts, BimEL expression is substantially increased following serum withdrawal (11Weston C. Balmanno K. Chalmers C. Hadfield K. Molton S. Ley R. Wagner E.F. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar); therefore we compared this response with that seen following inhibition of PI3K. Using a real-time RT-PCR protocol we observed that the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 caused a striking 25-fold induction of Bim RNA levels, compared with a β-actin control, when added to cells in 10% FBS (Fig. 1A). This was accompanied by a substantial increase in expression of BimEL protein (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, although serum starvation caused a much smaller (5-fold) increase in Bim mRNA (Fig. 1A), it actually caused a greater increase in BimEL protein expression compared with that seen following addition of LY294002 (Fig. 1B). Analysis of PKB phosphorylation (Fig. 1B) confirmed that serum withdrawal and LY294002 were equally effective in reducing the activity of the PI3K/PKB pathway. This disparity indicated that the increase in BimEL expression following serum withdrawal could not be accounted for simply by increases in Bim mRNA following loss of PI3K activity and the resultant dephosphorylation of PKB. Because BimEL was by far the major form of Bim expressed under these conditions, with only low levels of BimL seen, further analysis focused on the regulation of BimEL. Activation of the ERK1/2 Pathway Is Necessary and Sufficient to Promote Phosphorylation of BimEL—We (11Weston C. Balmanno K. Chalmers C. Hadfield K. Molton S. Ley R. Wagner E.F. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and others (21Shinjyo T. Kuribara R. Inukai T. Hosoi H. Kinoshita T. Miyajima A. Houghton P.J. Look A.T. Ozawa K. Inaba T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 854-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 28Biswas S.C. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49511-49516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) have previously noted that in viable cells the BimEL protein resolves as a series of diffuse bands on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A), consistent with it being a phosphoprotein, although the role of this phosphorylation has not previously been resolved. Indeed, upon serum withdrawal, the expression of Bim increased, and the BimEL protein resolved as a monomeric form (Figs. 1B and 2B). This led us to postulate that phosphorylation might play a role in regulating BimEL expression, perhaps by altering its stability. The withdrawal of serum causes the dephosphorylation and inactivation of ERK1/2 as well as PKB (11Weston C. Balmanno K. Chalmers C. Hadfield K. Molton S. Ley R. Wagner E.F. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To investigate the possible involvement of MAPKs or SAPKs in BimEL phosphorylation, we used clonal CCl39 cell lines expressing different conditional kinases that activate these signaling pathways (11Weston C. Balmanno K. Chalmers C. Hadfield K. Molton S. Ley R. Wagner E.F. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 12Garner A.P. Weston C.R. Todd D.E. Balmanno K. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8089-8104Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). CM3 cells express ΔMEKK3:ER*, which, when activated by treatment with 4-HT, stimulates the ERK, JNK, and p38 pathways (12Garner A.P. Weston C.R. Todd D.E. Balmanno K. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8089-8104Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In CM3 cells maintained in 10% FBS, the retarded mobility of BimEL on SDS-PAGE was entirely due to phosphorylation, because it resolved as a monomeric form with enhanced mobility when the lysates were treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. Activation of ΔMEKK3:ER* by treatment of cells with 4-HT caused further phosphorylation of BimEL, but again this was reduced to a single form by calf intestinal phosphatase treatment (Fig. 2A, CIP). To define which MAPK or SAPK pathway was promoting BimEL phosphorylation, CM3 cells were serum-starved and then restimulated with 4-HT in the presence or absence of U0126 to prevent activation of ERK1/2 and ERK5 (22Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) as well as LY294002. Serum starvation caused an increase in BimEL protein expression, and under these conditions the hypophosphorylated form predominated. Activation of ΔMEKK3:ER* caused phosphorylation of BimEL, and this was completely inhibited by U0126 but not LY294002 (Fig. 2B). The efficacy of these drugs was confirmed by immunoblotting for phospho-ERK1/2 in the case of U0126 and phospho-PKB for LY294002. This suggested that although ΔMEKK3:ER* can activate ERK1/2, JNK and p38, the ERK1/2 or ERK5 pathways were required for phosphorylation of BimEL. To differentiate between the ERK1/2 and ERK5 pathways, we used CR1–11 cells (11Weston C. Balmanno K. Chalmers C. Hadfield K. Molton S. Ley R. Wagner E.F. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), a clone of CCl39 cells expressing the conditional kinase ΔRaf-1:ER* (23Woods D. Parry D. Cherwinski H. Bosch E. Lees E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5598-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), which selectively activates the ERK1/2 pathway. Serum withdrawal again promoted the expression and dephosphorylation of BimEL. Subsequent activation of ΔRaf-1:ER* stimulated the phosphorylation of BimEL, and this was abolished by U0126 (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that selective activation of the ERK1/2 pathway is sufficient to induce substantial phosphorylation of BimEL. Serum Stimulation Increases the Turnover of BimEL, and This Requires the ERK1/2 Pathway—Stimulus-dependent phosphorylation can serve to “flag” proteins for destruction (24Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (6907) Google Scholar), and so we examined the turnover of BimEL. CCl39 cells were serum-starved to induce the expression of the hypophosphorylated form of BimEL. These cells were then “chased” with emetine for 4 or 8 h, to prevent new protein synthesis, in the presence or absence of 10% FBS. When cell lysates were immunoblotted for Bim, it was apparent that BimEL protein levels decayed relatively slowly in serum-free medium with a half-life (t1/2) in excess of 8 h. Serum stimulation accelerated the decay of BimEL, with a t1/2 of ∼3 h, and this was associated with the phosphorylation of the protein. If cells were treated with PD184352, which inhibits the ERK1/2 pathway but not the ERK5 pathway (13Squires M.S. Nixon P.M. Cook S.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the FBS-stimulated phosphorylation of BimEL was abolished and FBS no longer increased the turnover of BimEL (t1/2 > 8 h). As a control, the turnover of the BH3-only protein, Bad, was unaffected by FBS or PD184352 (Fig. 3A). In common with the ERK1/2 pathway, the PI3K/PKB pathway is also inactivated upon withdrawal of serum and strongly reactivated when quiescent cells are stimulated with FBS. We therefore examined the effect of inhibiting the PI3K pathway on FBS-stimulated BimEL turnover. The PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, prevented PKB phosphorylation in response to serum stimulation but had no effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Under these conditions LY294002 had no effect on FBS-stimulated turnover of BimEL, indicating that the PI3K/PKB plays no role in the serum-stimulated degradation of BimEL. Selective Activation of the ERK1/2 Pathway Is Sufficient to Stimulate the Turnover of BimEL—To determine whether activation of the ERK1/2 pathway alone was sufficient to promote turnover of BimEL, we performed emetine chase experiments in CR1–11 cells expressing ΔRaf-1:ER*. In serum-starved CR1–11 cells, BimEL turnover was again slow (t1/2 > 8 h). Activation of ΔRaf-1:ER* resulted in activation of ERK1/2 (but not PKB (11Weston C. Balmanno K. Chalmers C. Hadfield K. Molton S. Ley R. Wagner E.F. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar)), causing a striking phosphorylation of BimEL (Fig. 4). This selective activation of the ERK1/2 pathway was sufficient to stimulate the turnover of BimEL and decrease the half-life of the protein to around 3 h, but again it had no effect on the levels of Bad (Fig. 4). Taken together the results shown in Figs. 3 and 4 indicate that activation of the ERK pathway is necessary and sufficient to stimulate the turnover of pre-existing BimEL protein. ERK1/2-dependent Degradation of BimELProceeds via the Proteasome Pathway—The regulated degradation of proteins proceeds, in most cases, via the proteasome pathway. Proteins marked for destruction by the covalent attachment of ubiquitin moieties to lysine residues are rapidly degraded by the 26 S proteasome (24Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (6907) Google Scholar). To determine whether serum-stimulated degradation of BimEL was proceeding via a proteasome-dependent pathway, we repeated the emetine chase experiments in the presence of the cell-permeant proteasome inhibitor, MG132. In these experiments we again observed that FBS stimulation caused the phosphorylation and degradation of BimEL (Fig. 5A). In contrast, MG132 completely blocked the FBS-stimulated degradation of BimEL without blocking phosphorylation, indicating that MG132 did not simply prevent activation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 5A). As a specificity control, CCl39 cells were serum-starved and restimulated with FBS and emetine in the absence or presence of various protease inhibitors. Neither the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine nor the caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk had any effect on the serum-stimulated degradation of BimEL. In contrast, both proteasome inhibitors, MG132 and lactacystin, blocked the turnover of BimEL without blocking its phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). We also observed that the proteasome inhibitor LLnL (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal) inhibited turnover of BimEL. 3R. Ley and S. Cook, unpublished observations. These results suggest that serum-stimulated, ERK-dependent BimEL degradation proceeds via the proteasome. As an independent confirmation of these results, we assessed the accumulation of BimEL protein in the ts20 CHO cell line, which harbors a temperature-sensitive mutation in the E1 component of the ubiquitin-conjugating system (14Kulka R.G. Raboy B. Schuster R. Parag H.A. Diamond G. Ciechanover A. Marcus M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15726-15731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus fails to support ubiquitination when switched from the permissive temperature (32 °C) to the restrictive temperature (39 °C). First we noted that when ts20 CHO cells were serum-starved overnight at 32 or 39 °C, the shift to the restrictive temperature was sufficient to cause an increase in the level of BimEL (Fig. 5C, lane 1 versus 4). In addition, when these cells were subjected to an emetine chase for 8 h, FBS promoted the phosphorylation and degradation of BimEL at 32 °C, but the phosphorylated BimEL protein was not degraded in response to FBS stimulation at 39 °C (Fig. 5C, lane 3 versus 6). As controls we noted that the expression of Bad was unaffected by FBS, emetine, or temperature shift and that temperature shift did not impair activation of ERK1/2 by FBS. To see whether we could detect ubiquitin-conjugated Bim, we expressed HA-tagged BimEL in HEK293 cells and treated these cells with PD184352 to inhibit the ERK1/2 pathway or MG132 to block the proteasome. When these samples were subject to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies followed by Western blotting with Bim antibodies, we observed the expression of HA-BimEL and the smaller HA-BimL and HA-BimS due to splicing (Fig. 6A, lane 4); HA-ERK5 served as a negative control (Fig. 6A, lane 3). In untreated cells a faint series of bands formed a smear or ladder above HA-Bim (Fig. 6A, lane 4). Treatment with PD184352 caused dephosphorylation of BimEL and caused a modest reduction in the appearance of this ladder (Fig. 6A, lane 5), whereas MG132 did not affect the phosphorylation but enhanced the accumulation of these high molecular weight forms of Bim (Fig. 6A, lane 6). This effect of MG132 was in turn partly reduced by PD184352 (Fig. 6A, lane 7 versus 6). Co-expression of FLAG-ubiquitin (FLAG-Ub) also caused a slight further enhancement of these high molecular weight forms of HA-Bim (Fig. 6A, lane 2 versus 6), and this was also substantially reduced by PD184352 (Fig. 6A, lane 1 versus 2). Finally, these same samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies and then blotted with anti-FLAG antibodies to see whether we could demonstrate the attachment of FLAG-Ub to HA-Bim. As a control, poly-Ub conjugates were not detected in cells that were not transfected with FLAG-Ub (Fig. 6B, lanes 3–7). When FLAG-Ub and HA-BimEL were co-expressed in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, we were able to clearly detect poly-Ub conjugates associated with Bim, resolving as a smear up the gel. These were not seen when HA-BimEL was expressed alone in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 6B, lane 2 versus 6). The appearance of this smear of poly-Ub-conjugated Bim was partially reduced by treatment of cells with PD184352 (Fig. 6B, lane 1 versus 2), which also caused the dephosphorylation of BimEL (Fig. 6A, lane 1 versus 2). These results confirm in a heterologous system that transiently over-expressed BimEL is ubiquitinated; this is enhanced by over-expression of FLAG-Ub (allowing detection of FLAG-Ub/Bim conjugates) and is dependent, in large part, on the ERK1/2 pathway. Taken together the results shown in Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6 indicate that BimEL is degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system in response to activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. It is of utmost importance for the survival of multicellular organisms that the execution of cell death is kept under stringent control. In the mitochondrial death pathway, the fine balance between pro-death and pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins is regulated by the BH3-only proteins (1Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3338) Google Scholar, 2Puthalakath H. Strasser A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Higher eukaryotes possess a variety of BH3-only proteins. Each responds to a discrete set of stress or survival signals, with the result that each is subject to different forms of regulation. Some BH3-only genes such as Puma (3Nakano K. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar, 25Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Kinzler K.W.

Other BH3-only proteins are regulated by post-translational modifications; for example, caspase-8 cleaves Bid to yield an activated version called tBid (5Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3790) Google Scholar), whereas Bad is phosphorylated by PKB (6Datta S.R. Katsov A. Hu L. Petros A. Fesik S.W. Yaffe M.B.

Biol. 2000; 10: 127-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), which facilitates its sequestration by 14-3-3 proteins. Bim has previously been shown to be regulated by two discrete mechanisms. First, BimL and BimEL interact with 8-kDa dynein light chain 1 (27Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar), providing a mechanism to sequester Bim at microtubules away from the mitochondria. This spatial segregation of Bim may be regulated in response to some stresses, although it's mechanism is unclear. Second, the de novo expression of Bim is a major mechanism of regulation. Bim mRNA and Bim protein are expressed at very low levels in most viable cells but are rapidly and substantially up-regulated following withdrawal of survival factors from lymphocytes (8Dijkers P.F.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition, previous studies have noted that BimEL is a phosphoprotein (11Weston C. Balmanno K. Chalmers C. Hadfield K. Molton S. Ley R. Wagner E.F. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 21Shinjyo T. Kuribara R. Inukai T. Hosoi H. Kinoshita T. Miyajima A. Houghton P.J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 49511-49516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), although the role of this phosphorylation and the signaling pathway responsible were not resolved. Here we have shown for the first time that the ERK1/2 pathway is the major pathway promoting BimEL phosphorylation and that activation of this pathway targets BimEL for degradation via the proteasome. Our analysis of Bim phosphorylation was facilitated by the use of conditional MAPK kinase kinases, which allow rapid and selective activation of defined signaling pathways (12Garner A.P. Weston C.R. Todd D.E. Balmanno K. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8089-8104Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23Woods D. Parry D. Cherwinski H. Bosch E. Lees E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5598-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). ΔMEKK3:ER*, which activates the ERK, JNK, and p38 pathways (12Garner A.P. Weston C.R. Todd D.E. Balmanno K. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8089-8104Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), promoted phosphorylation of BimEL implicating the MAPK and/or SAPK pathways. The ability of U0126 to block this ΔMEKK3:ER*-induced phosphorylation further focused our attention on the ERK1/2 or ERK5 pathways, whereas the ability of PD184352 to block BimEL phosphorylation strongly suggested that the ERK1/2 pathway was responsible, because 5 μm PD184352 completely inhibits the ERK1/2 pathway without impacting on ERK5 (13Squires M.S. Nixon P.M. Cook S.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Finally, the ability of ΔRaf-1:ER* to selectively activate the ERK1/2 pathway (23Woods D. Parry D. Cherwinski H. Bosch E. Lees E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5598-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) and induce BimEL phosphorylation confirmed that the ERK1/2 pathway was responsible. A recent study in PC12 cells showed that NGF could promote BimEL phosphorylation and cause a slow decrease in BimEL protein levels over a period of several days (28Biswas S.C. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49511-49516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, the authors did not examine whether this decline was due to changes in Bim mRNA or in protein stability, which is an important distinction because both the ERK and PI3K pathways can regulate Bim mRNA levels in some cells (11Weston C. Balmanno K. Chalmers C. Hadfield K. Molton S. Ley R. Wagner E.F. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the study relied solely on the use of 50 μm U0126, a dose that completely inhibits both the ERK1/2 and ERK5 pathways (22Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Because NGF activates both ERK1/2 and ERK5 (22Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 29Geetha T. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4730-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) it was unclear which pathway was responsible for the slow decline in BimEL. In contrast, our results, using PD184352 to selectively inhibit and ΔRaf-1:ER* to selectively activate the ERK1/2 pathway, clearly define the ERK1/2 pathway as being responsible for promoting BimEL phosphorylation. In addition, it is not clear that we are examining the same mechanism for down-regulation of BimEL as the study in PC12 cells (28Biswas S.C. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49511-49516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For example, the effects we observed on Bim turnover were rapid, with ΔRaf-1:ER* reducing Bim levels substantially within a few hours in the presence of emetine, whereas the down-regulation of BimEL described for NGF required several days (28Biswas S.C. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49511-49516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although activation of ERK1/2 is necessary and sufficient for phosphorylation and degradation of BimEL, it is not yet clear that ERK1/2 are the kinases responsible for phosphorylating BimEL. Certainly there are other kinases downstream of ERK1/2, such as RSK1 (7Shimamura A. Ballif B.A. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 127-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), that have been implicated in cell survival, and future studies should be directed toward defining the identity of the kinase and the sites of phosphorylation. Activation of the ERK1/2 pathway, either by FBS or ΔRaf-1: ER*, was sufficient to greatly accelerate the turnover of BimEL from >8 h to ∼3 h, indicating that activation of this pathway targets BimEL for degradation. Three independent lines of evidence lead us to conclude that this ERK1/2-dependent degradation proceeds via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. First, cell-permeant, small molecule inhibitors of the proteasome prevented ERK-dependent degradation of BimEL. Second, serum-stimulated degradation of BimEL in ts20 CHO cells was blocked at the restrictive temperature at which the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme is inactive (14Kulka R.G. Raboy B. Schuster R. Parag H.A. Diamond G. Ciechanover A. Marcus M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15726-15731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, in neither case did these interventions prevent BimEL phosphorylation, suggesting that inhibition of the ubiquitin-conjugating system or the proteasome was not simply blocking ERK activation. In these experiments we analyzed the expression of Bad as an internal control, as it is another BH3-only protein, it has also been implicated in death following withdrawal of survival factors and is regulated in part by the ERK1/2 pathway (7Shimamura A. Ballif B.A. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 127-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We found that the expression of Bad remained constant despite manipulation of the ERK, PI3K, or ubiquitin-proteasome pathways, which is consistent with other analysis indicating that Bad is a stably expressed protein that is relatively refractory to inhibition of de novo protein synthesis. 4C. J. Chalmers, K. Balmanno, K. Hadfield, R. Ley, and S. Cook, manuscript submitted. Third, and finally, when BimEL was over-expressed in HEK293 cells, MG132 or co-expression of FLAG-Ub allowed us to detect Bim-FLAG-poly-Ub conjugates; this ubiquitination was reduced by PD184352. Taken as a whole these results provide very strong evidence to support a model in which activation of the ERK1/2 pathway promotes the phosphorylation of BimEL, which serves to flag BimEL for ubiquitination and destruction by the proteasome. Our results suggest that the rapid expression of BimEL following withdrawal of serum or survival factors proceeds via at least two discrete mechanisms. The rapid inactivation of the ERK1/2 pathway will result in dephosphorylation and substantial stabilization of pre-existing and newly synthesized BimEL, which will be accompanied by increases in Bim mRNA because of activation of JNK (10Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Paquet L. Bernard O. Ham J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 629-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) or loss of PI3K (8Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Lammers J.W.

Molton S. Ley R. Wagner E.F. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), depending on the cell type. Thus, we provide a new insight into how the ERK1/2 survival pathway can “neutralize” BimEL and provide a novel mechanism by which the ERK1/2 pathway can contribute to cell survival following withdrawal of survival factors. This may be relevant to the survival of lymphocytes (8Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Curr.

In addition, because tumor cells are characterized, in part, by their ability to survive at reduced levels of growth factors (30Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22406) Google Scholar), this finding may be relevant to tumor cells that harbor activated mutants of Ras or Raf.

Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 2988-2995PubMed Google Scholar), its accumulation can also lead to the alkalinization of lysosomes (10Holz F.G. Schutt F. Kopitz J. Eldred G.E. Kruse F.E. Volcker H.E. Cantz M.

Nakanishi K. Parish C.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 2000; 41: 1981-1989PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence indicates that the generation of oxygen reactive species upon photoexcitation of A2E is integral to the death of the cells. For instance, an enhancer (D2O) and quenchers (histidine, DABCO, and azide) of singlet oxygen modulate the incidence of nonviable A2E-laden RPE following blue light illumination (14Sparrow J.R. Zhou J. Ben-Shabat S. Vollmer H. Itagaki Y. Nakanishi K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 2002; 43: 1222-1227PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, A2E itself undergoes photoxidation during irradiation with blue light to produce a series of epoxide rings along the retinoid side arms of the molecule (A2E-epoxides) (14Sparrow J.R. Zhou J. Ben-Shabat S. Vollmer H. Itagaki Y. Nakanishi K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 2002; 43: 1222-1227PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ben-Shabat S. Itagaki Y. Jockusch S. Sparrow J.R. Turro N.J.

The extent of epoxidation is dependent on the intensity and duration of illumination with irradiated A2E forming a mixture of compounds exhibiting epoxides of varying numbers, including an unprecedented nonaoxirane. The involvement of singlet oxygen in the photoxidation of A2E is indicated by the phosphorescence detection of singlet oxygen upon 430-nm irradiation of A2E by deuterium solvent potentiation, by inhibitory effects of singlet oxygen quenchers, and by experiments demonstrating that endoperoxide-derived singlet oxygen can substitute for blue light irradiation (14Sparrow J.R. Zhou J. Ben-Shabat S. Vollmer H. Itagaki Y. Nakanishi K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 2002; 43: 1222-1227PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ben-Shabat S. Itagaki Y. Jockusch S. Sparrow J.R. Turro N.J. Nakanishi K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar).We recently demonstrated that DNA is one of the subcellular targets of the photodynamic events initiated by the interaction of blue light and A2E (16Sparrow J.R. Zhou J. Cai B. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism by which the DNA damage occurs is not known, chemical reactions between DNA and the epoxides of photooxidized A2E may be a critical step. Because of the large ring strain and electrophilicity of these carbon- and oxygen- (2:1) containing three-membered epoxide rings, nucleophilic macromolecules such as proteins and DNA tend to react with them spontaneously (17Koskinen M. Plna K. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2000; 129: 209-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar,18Henderson R.F. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 135–136: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In fact, several classes of carcinogens that induce structural changes in DNA are known to react with guanosine and to a lesser extent adenosine and cytosine through epoxide moieties (19Weinstein I.B.

Toxicol. 2002; 15: 638-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In some cases, these reactions generate bulky adducts. Intrastrand and interstrand cross-links can also form when two or more epoxides are available for reaction (23Koivisto P. Kilpelainen I. Rasanen I. Adler I.D. Pacchierotti F. Peltonen K. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Carnelley T.J. Barker S. Wang H. Tan W.G. Weinfeld M. Le X.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Moreover, modifications associated with skeletal aromatic nitrogens of DNA bases can be destabilizing. Consequently, secondary transformations such as facile depurination or imidazole ring opening at N-7-alkyl-deoxyguanosines (17Koskinen M. Plna K. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2000; 129: 209-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) can occur.Here we report that A2E-epoxides can generate DNA lesions independent of direct damage by singlet oxygen. By mass spectrometry and quantitative HPLC, we have also screened some antioxidants for their ability to inhibit A2E-epoxide formation.DISCUSSIONWe previously observed that the double bond structure of A2E predisposes it to reaction with the singlet oxygen that is autogenerated by irradiation with blue light, the oxidation of the double bonds leading to epoxide formation (14Sparrow J.R. Zhou J. Ben-Shabat S. Vollmer H. Itagaki Y. Nakanishi K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 2002; 43: 1222-1227PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ben-Shabat S. Itagaki Y. Jockusch S. Sparrow J.R. Turro N.J. Nakanishi K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Thus, at the outset of this work, we reasoned that as alkylating agents, these epoxides would exhibit reactivity toward cellular macromolecules. Accordingly, we have shown that A2E-epoxides, both a mixture with varying numbers of epoxides on the A2E side arms and bisepoxide, can induce DNA lesions within cultured RPE cells. Moreover, by immunoperoxidase labeling with monoclonal antibodies that recognize 8-oxo-dG, we demonstrated in individual cells that at least one of these lesions is an oxidatively modified guanine base. Although cells, including ARPE-19 cells (16Sparrow J.R. Zhou J. Cai B. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), have developed mechanisms for repairing oxidative lesions to DNA bases, a decline in repair activity with age has been recognized (43Cabelof D.C. Raffoul J.J. Yanamadala S. Ganir C. Guo Z.M. Heydari A.R. Mutat. Res. 2002; 500: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 44Bohr V.A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Indeed, for cells that do not turnover as is the case for RPE, there is a greater accumulation of such lesions (45Sohal R.S. Agarwal S. Candas M. Forster M.J. Lal H. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1994; 76: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The persistence of DNA damage can result in altered gene expression with the transcription of some genes being arrested, while the transcription of other genes is induced (46Bohr V.A. Gilchrest B.A. Bohr V.A. Advances in Cell Aging and Gerontology. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2001: 191-205Google Scholar). DNA is not the only macromolecule in RPE cells toward which A2E-epoxides are likely to react because epoxides can react with a large range of nucleophiles, the latter attacking the electrophilic carbons of the epoxide, causing it to open. Examples of common cellular nucleophiles include the sulfhydryl (SH) groups of proteins, the electron-rich nitrogen atoms of the amino groups (NH2) of proteins and DNA, and the oxygen atom in a hydroxyl ion (OH).It is well established that RPE cells that have accumulated A2E are subject to blue light-mediated injury (12Sparrow J.R. Nakanishi K. Parish C.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 2000; 41: 1981-1989PubMed Google Scholar, 13Sparrow J.R. Cai B. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 2001; 42: 1356-1362PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sparrow J.R. Zhou J. Ben-Shabat S. Vollmer H. Itagaki Y. Nakanishi K. Invest. Ophthalmol.

Visual Sci. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), and we showed that at least one of the cellular macromolecules damaged is DNA. Although we report here that A2E-epoxides can damage DNA and probably other cellular constituents, the singlet oxygen generated by the photosensitization of A2E is an additional potentially important cytotoxic agent. Within polar solvents, A2E generates singlet oxygen with modest efficiency (0.03) (15Ben-Shabat S. Itagaki Y. Jockusch S. Sparrow J.R. Turro N.J. Nakanishi K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 47Lamb L.E. Ye T. Haralampus-Grynaviski N.M. Williams T.R. Pawlak A. Sarna T. Simon J.D. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2001; 105: 11507-11512Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 48Gaillard E.R. Atherton S.J. Eldred G. Dillon J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 61: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), although the photosensitizing ability of a hydrophobic compound such as A2E is probably greater in nonpolar surroundings such as that can be found in the membrane environment of a cell (49Aveline B.M. Hasan T. Redmond R.W. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1995; 30: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 50Krieg M. Srichai M.B. Redmond R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is clear that much of the singlet oxygen generated under these conditions is quenched by A2E (15Ben-Shabat S. Itagaki Y. Jockusch S. Sparrow J.R. Turro N.J. Nakanishi K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 51Roberts J.E. Kukielczak B.M. Hu D.N. Miller D.S. Bilski P. Sik R.H. Motten A.G. Chignell C.F. Photochem. Photobiol. 2002; 75: 184-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in the process, A2E-epoxides are generated (15Ben-Shabat S. Itagaki Y. Jockusch S. Sparrow J.R. Turro N.J. Nakanishi K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ability of singlet oxygen to diffuse only a short distance (∼10–20 nm) (52Moan J. Berg K. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 53: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar) within the cell may limit its ability to generate DNA damage. Thus, the potential for A2E-mediated photodamage in RPE cells in the eye may be very much dependent on the formation of A2E-epoxides. In keeping with this observation, it is important to note that some photosensitizers with low singlet oxygen quantum yields (0.005) exert a phototoxicity that is by orders of magnitude more potent than expected on the basis of their photophysical characteristics. The pronounced ability of these compounds to mediate light-induced cellular damage is explained by a conjugated double bond structure that serves to directly quench the singlet oxygen produced to form damaging oxidized intermediates (53Bunting J.R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 55: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 54Krieg M. Bilitz J.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 1461-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 55Delaey E. van Laar F. De Vos D. Kamuhabwa A. Jacobs P. de Witte P. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 2000; 55: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The proximity of the nucleus to the site of epoxide generation is likely to influence the ability of these compounds to interact with DNA. Thus, it is important to note that A2E accumulates intracellularly in lysosomal storage bodies that assume a perinuclear distribution (9Sparrow J.R. Parish C.A. Hashimoto M. Nakanishi K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 2988-2995PubMed Google Scholar). The access to the nucleus may be further facilitated if the A2E-epoxide fragment into readily diffusible compounds and/or if redistribution of the epoxides occurs because of lysosomal photodamage, the latter being the case for some other photosensitizers (56Selbo P.K. Sivam G. Fodstad O. Sandvig K. Berg K. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 92: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).Based on analogy with other DNA alkylation reactions and the secondary chemical transformations they undergo, it is possible to conceive mechanisms by which A2E-epoxide can generate a carbonyl product at the C8 position of guanine. For instance, the dietary carcinogen aflatoxin-B1 undergoes cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation to an aflatoxin-epoxide that can then form DNA adducts through covalent binding to the ring nitrogen at position 7 of guanine (57Egner P.A. Wang J.B. Zhu Y.R. Zhang B.C. Wu Y. Zhang Q.N. Qian G.S. Kuang S.Y. Gange S.J. Jacobson L.P. Helzlsouer K.J. Bailey G.S. Groopman J.D. Kensler T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14601-14606Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Aflatoxin-N(7)-guanine adducts, however, are very unstable and can spontaneously yield 8-oxo-dG (35Yarborough A. Zhang Y.-J. Hsu T.-M. Santella R.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 683-688PubMed Google Scholar, 36Shen H.-M. Ong C.-N. Lee B.L. Shi C.-Y. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 57Egner P.A. Wang J.B. Zhu Y.R. Zhang B.C. Wu Y. Zhang Q.N. Qian G.S. Kuang S.Y. Gange S.J. Jacobson L.P. Helzlsouer K.J. Bailey G.S. Groopman J.D. Kensler T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14601-14606Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Other alkyl epoxides have also been shown to prefer the N(7) position of guanine, principally because it has high nucleophilicity and is sterically accessible (17Koskinen M. Plna K. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2000; 129: 209-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and some of these other N(7)-substituted guanines can also undergo hydrolytic rearrangement to form 8-oxo-dG (58Kohda K. Tada M. Kasai H. Nishimura S. Kawazoe Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 139: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that an epoxy-A2E may react at the position 7 of guanine to form an iminium salt. Reaction of the iminium salt with H2O hydroxide ion would form a DNA adduct, which could subsequently eliminate its A2E moiety to give 8-oxo-dG. The foregoing mechanism is currently under investigation as is the potential for DNA cross-linking. The latter is feasible because A2E can undergo epoxidation at multiple double bonds and thus may be capable of reacting at two sites on DNA, leading to cross-link formation.In addition to transforming to 8-oxo-dG, N(7)-guanine adducts derived from epoxides can also proceed to depurination (59Smela M.E. Hamm M.L. Henderson P.T. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Essigmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6655-6660Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The resulting base loss can transpire under physiological conditions and occurs because alkylation at guanine N(7) introduces a positive charge on the nitrogen atom (quaternary nitrogen) that leads to cleavage of the glycosyl bond to regain ring stability (17Koskinen M. Plna K. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2000; 129: 209-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These abasic sites created by spontaneous fission of the base-sugar linkage can subsequently be transformed into DNA strand breaks by the alkaline unwinding solution of the comet assay (31Rojas E. Lopez M.C. Valverde M. J. Chromatogr. 1999; 722: 225-254Crossref Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 32Singh N.P. McCoy M.T. Tice R.R. Schneider E.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (8929) Google Scholar). Such alkali-labile abasic sites probably account, at least in part, for the single strand breaks we detected by comet assay. Some of the DNA strand breaks may have also resulted from excision of damaged bases by specific DNA glycosylases in the process of DNA repair (44Bohr V.A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar).We observed that vitamin E, vitamin C, and a combination of both vitamins reduced the number of A2E molecules undergoing epoxidation, diminished the number of epoxides formed on a given A2E-epoxide adduct, and decreased the incidence of associated DNA injury and cell death. However, a clear synergistic effect of these two vitamins was not observed. Vitamin E is considered to be a major lipophilic antioxidant, and in some (60Kontush A. Mann U. Arlt S. Ujeyl A. Luhrs C. Muller-Thomsen T. Beisiegel U. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) but not all (61Huang H.Y. Appel L.J. Croft K.D. Miller E.R. Mori T.A. Puddey I.B. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2002; 76: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) cases, its oxygen-scavenging efficiency can be increased by combined treatment with vitamin C. Our mass spectrometry and HPLC data indicate that vitamin E served to scavenge singlet oxygen after its generation by photosensitized A2E but before it was inserted into the hydrophobic side arms of A2E to form epoxides. The notion that the effect of vitamin E was to intercept singlet oxygen-induced A2E epoxidation rather than to block reactivity between A2E-epoxides and cellular targets is consistent with reports that treatment with vitamin E does not inhibit covalent binding of aflatoxin B1-epoxide to DNA (36Shen H.-M. Ong C.-N. Lee B.L. Shi C.-Y. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A spectroscopic study (9Sparrow J.R. Parish C.A. Hashimoto M. Nakanishi K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 2988-2995PubMed Google Scholar) of A2E supports the assertion that the hydrophobic domains of this amphiphilic molecule are associated with the nonpolar lipid portions of intracellular membranes. With A2E positioned as such, vitamin E may function by neutralizing singlet oxygen at the site of its formation within the lipid bilayer of the membrane. This scenario may also account for the far more pronounced effect observed with vitamin E as compared with aqueous-soluble vitamin C and for the absence of additional benefit from combined treatment. It has been reported (62Stocker R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 422-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) that in addition to direct scavenging of reactive oxygen species, vitamin C can exert an antioxidant effect by maintaining vitamin E in its reduced functional form. Because under our experimental conditions significant quenching of singlet oxygen by vitamin C was not observed, we suggest that the protection afforded by vitamin C was related to its ability to recycle tocopheroxyl radicals.The significance of our findings with respect to vitamins C and E and their suppression of A2E-epoxidation is underscored by studies suggesting that individuals with low plasma levels of the antioxidants vitamins C and E are at increased risk for AMD (63Beatty S. Koh H.-H. Henson D. Boulton M. Surv. Ophthalmol. 2000; 45: 115-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar, 64Snodderly D.M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1995; 62, (suppl.): 1448-1461Crossref Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Age-related Eye Disease Study, a 9-year multicenter clinical trial, recently reported that supplementation with zinc, vitamins E and C, and β-carotene can reduce the risk of progression to advanced AMD (65The Age-related Eye Disease Study Research Group Arch. Ophthalmol. 2001; 119 (R. E. D. S.): 1417-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). Although the Age-related Eye Disease Study did not attribute this finding to particular mechanisms, investigators have speculated for some time that antioxidant vitamins provide a shield against oxidative injury originating, at least partially, from light (64Snodderly D.M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1995; 62, (suppl.): 1448-1461Crossref Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Because the death of RPE is central to the etiology of atrophic AMD (66Curcio C.A. Madeiros N.E. Millican C.L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1996; 37: 1236-1249PubMed Google Scholar, 67Green W.R. McDonnell P.J. Yeo J.H.

Ophthalmol. 1988; 32: 252-269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), defense against the damaging effects of light-induced A2E-epoxidation may be one means by which these vitamins afford protection.Of the other presumed antioxidants we surveyed, bilberry and resveratrol are both plant-derived dietary constituents. Bilberry is widely used in the U. S. as a nutritional supplement to improve vision, although the mechanism by which this may occur is not clear (40Muth E.R. Laurent J.M. Jasper P. Altern. Med. Rev. 2000; 5: 164-173PubMed Google Scholar, 41Zadok D. Levy Y. Glovinsky Y. Eye. 1999; 13: 734-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and little work has been done in the U. S. to elucidate indications for its use. The ability of bilberry to inhibit A2E-epoxidation in our studies may be related to its content of anthocyanosides (70Casoli U. Cultrera R. Dall'Aglio G. Ind. Conserve (Parma). 1967; 42: 11-16Google Scholar, 71Nyman N.A. Kumpulainen J.T. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2001; 49: 4183-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the latter being reputed to have antioxidant activity (40Muth E.R. Laurent J.M. Jasper P. Altern. Med. Rev. 2000; 5: 164-173PubMed Google Scholar). Resveratrol is a natural compound found in grapes (38Bhat K.P.L. Pezzuto J.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 957: 210-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). It is reported to have antioxidant properties, and its presence in wine in a soluble form that results in improved bioavailability is thought to be responsible for the cardioprotective effects of red wine. Both resveratrol and bilberry extract can inhibit A2E-epoxidation by quenching singlet oxygen. This appears not to be the case for ginkgolide B.The oxidative damage to which all of the cells are subjected is considered to be a significant cause of an age-related decline in cell function (72Burkle A. Eye. 2001; 15: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (31"

To investigate this mechanism, we compared the global gene expression in five mutant strains, each bearing a mutation (i.e. fks1, kre6, mnn9, gas1, and knr4 mutants) that affects in a different manner the cell wall construction. Altogether, 300 responsive genes were kept based on high stringency criteria during data processing.

The relative importance of these regulatory systems in the cell wall compensatory mechanism is discussed. Yeast and fungi are surrounded by a cell wall that is a complex structure essential for maintenance of the cell shape, prevention of lysis, and protection against harmful environmental conditions. The yeast cell wall architecture has been determined in detail over the past decade (1Orlean P. The Molecular Biology and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY1997: 229-362Google Scholar). It is a layered structure that is composed of β-1,3- and β-1,6-glucan (50–60% of the cell wall dry mass), mannoproteins (40–50%), and chitin (2%). β-1,3-Glucan and chitin form a fibrillar network to which mannoproteins are anchored, mostly through β-1,6-glucan. Some cell wall proteins, like the PIR family, can be directly linked to β-1,3-glucan (reviewed in Ref. 2Klis F. Mol P. Hellingwerf K. Brul S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 239-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cell wall is not a rigid structure, since it endures all of the changes that the cell undergoes during division, morphogenesis, and differentiation.To ensure continuous integrity of the wall in accordance with its plasticity, complex mechanisms must be operating, which need to be strictly coordinated with those governing cell growth. One of these mechanisms, termed the “cell wall compensatory mechanism” (2Klis F. Mol P. Hellingwerf K. Brul S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 239-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Popolo L. Gualtieri T. Ragni E. Med. Mycol. 2001; 39: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), can be triggered by several means, including cell wall-weakening mutations (4Dallies N. Francois J.

Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2121-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and temperature and osmotic shock (7Verna J. Lodder A. Lee K. Vagts A. Ballester R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13804-13809Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 8Garcia-Rodriguez L.J. Duran A. Roncero C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2428-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As reviewed by Klis and collaborators (9Smits G.J. van den Ende H. Klis F.M. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 781-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), three main responses to cell wall damage have been identified. First, the balance between cell wall polysaccharides is modified, as indicated by hyperaccumulation of chitin. Second, the type of association between β-glucan, mannoproteins, and chitin is changed. For instance, lowering the amount of β-1,6-glucan leads to a larger fraction of the cell wall proteins becoming linked directly to β-1,3-glucan and chitin, concomitant with an increased level of Pir proteins (10Kapteyn J.C. Van Egmond P. Sievi E. van den Ende H. Makarow M. Klis F.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1835-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A third response that ensures strengthening of the cell wall is a transient redistribution of cell wall synthesis and the repairing machinery that is normally focused to active growth regions all over the cell.A major transduction pathway that is essential in the maintenance of the cell wall integrity pathway is the PKC1-SLT2 MAPK-signaling module (11Heinisch J.J. Lorberg A. Schmitz H.-P. Jacoby J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). This pathway consists of a MAPK 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; DMF, dimethylformamide; ESR, environmental stress response; MIPS, Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences.1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; DMF, dimethylformamide; ESR, environmental stress response; MIPS, Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences. kinase kinase, Bck1p/Slk1p, a pair of redundant MAPK kinases, Mkk1/2p, and a MAPK, Slt2p/Mpk1p (11Heinisch J.J. Lorberg A. Schmitz H.-P. Jacoby J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Activation of this pathway is mediated through a family of plasma membrane-localized sensors, Wsc1–4p and Mid2p (3Popolo L. Gualtieri T. Ragni E. Med. Mycol. 2001; 39: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 7Verna J. Lodder A. Lee K. Vagts A. Ballester R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1999; 19: 3969-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and this results in the activation of the Slt2p by dual phosphorylation of its two conserved threonine and tyrosine residues (13Martin H. Rodriguez-Pachon J.M. Ruiz C. Nombela C. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1511-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The activated Slt2p MAPK activates in turn downstream transcription factors and consequently promotes gene expression. Among the well characterized Slt2p targets are SBF and Rlm1p transcription factors, which control the expression of cell cycle-regulated genes at the G1/S phase (14Andrews B.J. Herskowitz I. Nature. 1989; 342: 830-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 15Madden K. Sheu Y.J. Baetz K. Andrews B. Snyder M. Science. 1997; 275: 1781-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and cell wall-related genes (16Dodou E. Treisman R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1848-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 17Jung U.S. Levin D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1049-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), respectively. This illustrates that the maintenance of cell integrity is dependent on coordination between cell wall biogenesis and cell proliferation (9Smits G.J. van den Ende H. Klis F.M. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 781-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 15Madden K. Sheu Y.J. Baetz K. Andrews B. Snyder M. Science. 1997; 275: 1781-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Cell wall perturbations including treatment of yeast cells with Calcofluor White, β-1,3-glucanase, or Congo red or mutations in cell wall-related genes cause an activation of the PKC1-SLT2-dependent pathway, suggesting an important role of this pathway in the mechanism to compensate for cell wall weakening (6De Nobel H. Ruiz C. Martin H. Morris W. Brul S. Molina M. Klis F.M. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2121-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 12Rajavel M. Philip B. Buehrer B.M. Errede B. Levin D.E. Mol.

Green R. Bussey H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3330-3340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the cell wall compensatory mechanism does not seem to rely exclusively on Pkc1p function, since a number of genes involved in cell wall biogenesis are also up-or down-regulated in response to a wide variety of environmental conditions (20Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3698) Google Scholar, 21Causton H.C. Ren B. Koh S.S.

Interestingly, this latter response is dependent to a large extent on the activity of Msn2p/Msn4p transcription factors. The calcium/calcineurin and the HOG1-MAPK signaling pathways are another two possible contributors to the regulation of cell wall construction; high calcium concentration activates expression of several genes implicated in cell wall synthesis and maintenance (22Yoshimoto H. Saltsman K. Gasch A.P. Li H.X. Ogawa N. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Cyert M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31079-31088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), and mutations in components of the HOG pathway (hog1Δ and pbs2Δ) lead to defective cell wall phenotypes (2Klis F. Mol P. Hellingwerf K. Brul S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 239-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hohmann S. Microbiol Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 300-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar).To obtain a comprehensive view of the cellular responses to cell wall damage, we used DNA arrays to examine the transcription profiles of yeast strains that are defective in different functions required for cell wall biogenesis. Our rationale was that the comparison of gene expression profiles from different cell wall mutants would allow identification of a discrete cluster of co-regulated genes that is a hallmark of the cell wall compensatory mechanism. Moreover, unraveling this cluster might be fruitful from a drug discovery viewpoint toward identifying potential antifungal targets (24Jiang B. Bussey H. Roemer T. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 446-448Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Following this strategy, we isolated a group of 79 co-regulated genes that probably represent the stereotypical transcription response to cell wall damage and showed that the cell wall compensatory mechanism integrates the Slt2p-mediated cell integrity pathway together with the general stress response system and the calcium/calcineurin-dependent signaling pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrain Construction, Growth Conditions, and Phenotypic Analysis— The strains used in this work are listed in Table I. For yeast transformation, the method described in Ref. 25Woods R.A. Gietz R.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 177: 85-97PubMed Google Scholar was used. Strains bearing single gene deletion by the KanMX4 cassette were purchased from the EUROSCARF collection (available on the World Wide Web at www.uni-frankfurt.de/fb15/mikro/euroscarf/2000). Crossing, sporulation, and tetrad analysis were carried out as described by Rose et al. (27Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY1990Google Scholar). For microarray analysis, yeast cells were cultured at 30 °C in a 1-liter shake flask on a rotary shaker set at 200 rpm and containing 0.2 liters of YEPD medium (10 g of yeast extract, 20 g of bactopeptone, and 20 g of glucose/liter). Cell samples for RNA extraction were taken early in the exponential phase of growth (i.e. in conditions where cellular growth is perfectly balanced). Cultures in the presence of Calcofluor White (50 μg/ml) and CaCl2 (0.2 m) were carried out as previously described in Refs. 6De Nobel H. Ruiz C. Martin H. Morris W. Brul S. Molina M. Klis F.M.

Jung U.S. Garrett-Engele P. Roe T. Cyert M.S. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To replace the AGCCTC by AGATCT (corresponding to a XbaI site), a recombinant PCR strategy was followed as described by Innis et al. (30Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sinsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar), using 5′-ACGGCAAATCGCCAAAAGAGATGAT-3′ and 5′-GCGGGCCTCTTCGCTATTACGCCAG-3′ as external primers as well as 5′-GAGATAATCTAGAGTTCGTTCTCTCCATTTCTTCCCTG-3′ and 5′-AACGAATCTAGATTATCTCATTTTATTCTACTCTTTG-3′ as internal primers (the XbaI restriction site is underlined) to yield the pFKS2Δcdre-LacZ gene fusion.

PCR was performed with high fidelity Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (Genome Express S.A., Grenoble, France), prior to yeast transformations and β-galactosidase assays (31Rose M. Botstein D.

Hoheisel J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1970-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar with some modifications. Briefly, in the first step (acylation), polypropylene membranes (Pall, Dreieich, Germany) were incubated for 2 h in a mixture of 1.3 ml (16 mmol) acryloylchloride in 40 ml of anhydrous dichloroethane and 2.74 ml (16 mmol) of diisopropylethylamine. The membranes were washed thoroughly with dichloroethane (2 × 40 ml) and then dimethylformamide (DMF) (1 × 40 ml) and subsequently dried. In the second step, the acylated membranes were incubated over two nights in a solution of 3.6 ml (16 mmol) tetraethylene-pentamine in 40 ml of anhydrous, amine-free DMF. After two washes each with DMF and dichloroethane, the membranes were dried. Steps one and two were repeated, but instead of tetraethylene-pentamine in step two, 3.4 ml (16 mmol) of 1,4-bis-(3-aminopropoxy)butane were used. For control of reaction efficiency, aminated polypropylene strips were added to the reaction. After every reaction step, part of a control strip was removed, washed with DMF, and stained in a 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue solution in 2 ml of DMF for 2 min. After subsequent washes in pure DMF and ethanol, the color intensity was used to calculate the number of amino groups blocked during acylation or newly introduced with the amines.Manufacturing DNA Arrays on Polypropylene Filters—The 6116 yeast genes were amplified as described in Ref. 33Hauser N.C. Vingron M. Scheideler M. Krems B. Hellmuth K. Entian K.D. Hoheisel J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, using a commercially available set of primers (GenePair; Invitrogen). The amplification yielded 95% recovery of the initial amplicons. Prior to spotting, the polypropylene membranes were soaked in activation solution (28 mmN-ethylcarbodiimidehydrochloride in H2O, to which 44 μl of N-methylimidazole per 100 ml of solution were added immediately prior to use) and left therein during the spotting process. After spotting, membranes were incubated for 2 h at 65 °C and dried overnight. The DNA arrays on polypropylene filters were reused at least 10 times without significant reduction of the signal intensity. The regeneration of arrays between experiments was carried out as described previously (33Hauser N.C. Vingron M. Scheideler M. Krems B. Hellmuth K. Entian K.D. Hoheisel J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Single Strand cDNA Synthesis and Hybridization on DNA Arrays— Total RNA was extracted from exponentially growing cells as described by Hauser et al. (33Hauser N.C. Vingron M. Scheideler M. Krems B. Hellmuth K. Entian K.D. Hoheisel J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and verified for purity and concentration using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies). The complex sample was generated by first strand cDNA synthesis (34Nguyen C. Rocha D. Granjeaud S. Baldit M. Bernard K. Naquet P. Jordan B.R. Genomics. 1995; 29: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Some 25 μg of total RNA were mixed with 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)15 (Invitrogen) in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. The sample was heated to 70 °C for 10 min and subsequently cooled to 43 °C. Reverse transcription was performed in a total volume of 30 μl using SuperScript™II (Invitrogen) in the presence of a 0.25 mm concentration each of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP, 1.66 μm dCTP, and 30 μCi of [α-33P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). After 30 min at 42 °C, another 1 μl of SuperScript™II was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 30 min. This step was followed by an alkaline hydrolysis of the RNA in the presence of 1 μl of 1% SDS, 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, and 3 μl of 3 m NaOH for 30 min at 60 °C and subsequently incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The solution was then neutralized with 10 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 3 μl of 2 m HCl. After the addition of 5 μl of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.3, 5 μl of tRNA (10 μg/μl), and 60 μl of isopropyl alcohol, the cDNA was precipitated at -20 °C for 30 min, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in 100 μl of water. The incorporation of 33P into the cDNA was checked by scintillation counting. For consistent results, incorporation must be above 70% of the initial radioactivity. The arrays were prehybridized for at least 2 h in 20 ml of 7% SDS, 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA at 65 °C. cDNA samples were denaturated for 5 min at 100 °C and added directly to the solution. The hybridization was carried out for 20 h at 65 °C. Subsequently, the DNA arrays were briefly rinsed in a solution containing 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and 0.1% SDS, followed by two 20-min washes in the same buffer at 65 °C. The arrays were exposed to phosphor screens for 2–3 days. Signal detection was performed by a Storm 860 phosphofluoroimager (Amersham Biosciences). Experiments with each mutant strain and its isogenic wild type were repeated four times.Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was separated in formaldehyde-agarose gels (25 μg/lane) as described by Siderius et al. (35Siderius M. Rots E. Mager W.H. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 3241-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and transferred to Nylon-N+ filters (Amersham Biosciences). Probes were obtained by a PCR amplification of complete open reading frames on genomic DNA with the corresponding commercial oligonucleotide primers (purchased from Eurogentec, Belgium). Hybridization was carried out in 7% SDS, 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA at 65 °C overnight. The filters were first washed once in 0.1% SDS, 0.01× SSC at room temperature and then washed twice for 10 min in 0.1% SDS, 0.01× SSC at room temperature. Signal quantification was performed with the phosphofluoroimager, using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences), and values were reported relative to PDA1 transcription levels used as an internal standard.Detection of Dually Phosphorylated Slt2p—Yeast cells were grown overnight in YEPD medium at 24 °C to midexponential phase. The cultures were then diluted in the same medium to A595 of 0.3, grown for 3 h at 24 °C, and then processed identically as described in Ref. 13Martin H. Rodriguez-Pachon J.M. Ruiz C. Nombela C. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1511-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar. Detection of the dually phosphorylated Slt2p was made with anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (New England Biolabs) at a 1:2000 dilution. The amount of Slt2 protein on the same membrane was measured with anti-Gst-Slt2p antibody (36Martin H. Arroyo J. Sanchez M. olina M. Nombela C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) at a 1:1000 dilution.Data Acquisition and Evaluation—Image analysis and quantification of the array hybridizations were done using A.I.S. 5.0 software (Imaging Research Inc.), which applies a predefined grid on the array of signals and performs spot quantification in a 16-bit gray scale format. Data from the quantification are then exported and uploaded in M-CHiPS, a microarray data warehouse and analysis tool package (Ref. 37Fellenberg K. Hauser N. Brors B. Hoheisel J. Vingron M. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar; available on the World Wide Web at www.dkfz-heidelberg.de/tbi/services/mchips/). Signal intensities of repeated hybridizations were normalized, and significance levels were assessed by two stringency criteria (38Beissbarth T. Fellenberg K. Brors B. Arribas-Prat R. Boer J. Hauser N.C. Scheideler M. Hoheisel J.D. Schutz G. Poustka A. Vingron M. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 1014-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The highly stringent “min-max separation” is calculated by measuring the minimum distance between all data points of two strains. The less stringent criteria, called “standard deviation separation,” is defined as the difference of the means of the two data sets diminished by one S.D. value. A color code was applied to each value, indicating whether the variation was significant by either of these two different criteria. The whole set of data is available on the World Wide Web at www.dkfz.de/funct_genome/yeast-data.html.Computational Treatment of Gene Expression Profiling—Transcript profiles of genes whose expressions were changed significantly by a factor of ≥2 were grouped by a two-dimensional hierarchical clustering. Gene similarity metric and the hierarchical clustering algorithm based on average linkage were used according to Eisen et al. (39Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13134) Google Scholar). A modified version of Sherlock software was used for cluster visualization and distance calculation (40Sherlock G. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). To identify regulatory motifs in DNA noncoding sequence of a gene, a 700-bp promoter sequence upstream of the start codon of any gene of interest was retrieved from the SGD data base (41Cherry J.M. Adler C. Ball C. Chervitz S.A. Dwight S.S. Hester E.T. Jia Y. Juvik G. Roe T. Schroeder M. Weng S. Botstein D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Promoter analysis was carried out using MatInspector (42Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar), DNA-Pattern, and Oligo-analysis software (43Van Helden J. Andre B. Collado-Vides J. Yeast. 2000; 16: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The MatInspector software interrogates the TRANSFAC data base containing a large library of predefined matrix descriptions for protein-binding sites (44Wingender E. Chen X. Hehl R. Karas H.

https://openalex.org/W2094007091,"Activation of dopamine D1 receptors is critical for the generation of glutamate-induced long-term potentiation at corticostriatal synapses. In this study, we report that, in striatal neurons, D1 receptors are co-localized with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the postsynaptic density and that they co-immunoprecipitate with NMDA receptor subunits from postsynaptic density preparations. Using modified bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, we demonstrate that D1 and NMDA receptor clustering reflects the existence of direct interactions. The tagged D1 receptor and NR1 subunit cotransfected in COS-7 cells generated a significant bioluminescence resonance energy transfer signal that was insensitive to agonist stimulation and that did not change in the presence of the NR2B subunit, suggesting that the D1 receptor constitutively and selectively interacts with the NR1 subunit of the NMDA channel. Oligomerization with the NR1 subunit substantially modified D1 receptor trafficking. In individually transfected HEK293 cells, NR1 was localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas the D1 receptor was targeted to the plasma membrane. In cotransfected cells, both the D1 receptor and NR1 subunit were retained in cytoplasmic compartments. In the presence of the NR2B subunit, the NR1-D1 receptor complex was translocated to the plasma membrane. These data suggest that D1 and NMDA receptors are assembled within intracellular compartments as constitutive heteromeric complexes that are delivered to functional sites. Coexpression with NR1 and NR2B subunits also abolished agonist-induced D1 receptor cytoplasmic sequestration, indicating that oligomerization with the NMDA receptor could represent a novel regulatory mechanism modulating D1 receptor desensitization and cellular trafficking.

Dopaminergic fibers originating in the substantia nigra and cortical glutamatergic neurons extensively interact in the striatum to drive the physiological functions of this structure from motor planning to reward seeking and procedural learning (1Berke J.D.

The critical importance of dopamine in this system is such that the degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons leads to the motor and cognitive deficits of Parkinson's disease (3Olanow C.W. Obeso A.J. Nutt J.G. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: S1-S126PubMed Google Scholar).At the cellular level, nigral and cortical fibers converge on the medium spiny projection neurons (4Smith A.D. Bolam J.P.

From a functional point of view, it is well established that dopamine modulates the firing pattern of these neurons. In particular, there is evidence that dopamine, while attenuating the responses mediated by non-NMDA receptors, potentiates those associated with activation of NMDA receptors (2Nicola S.M. Surmeier J. Malenka R.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 185-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The D1 receptor appears to be involved in these interactions. In fact, activation of D1 receptors in medium spiny neurons enhances NMDA-induced whole cell currents (2Nicola S.M. Surmeier J. Malenka R.C. Annu. Rev.

Moreover, activation of NMDA receptors in striatal neurons triggers the translocation of cytoplasmic D1 receptors to the plasma membrane and spines (13Scott L. Kruse M.S. Forssberg H. Brismar H. Greengard P. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1661-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Within neuronal spines, D1 receptors are mainly localized in the spine shaft and, to a lesser extent, also in the spine head and in the postsynaptic density (PSD) (14Hersch S.M. Ciliax B.J. Gutekunst C.A. Rees H.D. Heilman C.J. Yung K.K. Bolam J.P. Ince E. Yi H. Levey A.I. J. Neurosci. 1995; 13: 2237-2248Google Scholar, 15Yung K.K. Bolam J.P. Smith A.D. Hersch S.M. Ciliax B.J.

Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7821-7836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This cell structure is typical of the glutamatergic synapse and consists of a complex network of critical proteins involved in synaptic plasticity, many of which bind directly or indirectly to the NMDA receptor, which is an abundant component of the fraction (17Kennedy M.B. Science. 2000; 290: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 18Sheng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7058-7061Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that specifically drive D1 receptor delivery to different spine domains are still unknown. The partial overlap in the subcellular distribution of NMDA and D1 receptors and the observation that both D1 and NMDA receptor delivery to synapses is dependent on glutamate transmission (13Scott L. Kruse M.S. Forssberg H. Brismar H. Greengard P. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1661-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 19Barria A. Malinow R. Neuron. 2002; 35: 345-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) suggest that direct protein-protein interactions might direct the trafficking of these receptors to the same subcellular domain.In this study, we report that the dopamine D1 receptor forms a heteromeric complex with the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor in both purified striatal PSDs and cotransfected cells. This interaction is constitutive, occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), influences D1 receptor targeting to the cell membrane, and prevents agonist-induced D1 receptor internalization.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were provided by Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellculturen GmbH (Braunschweg, Germany). Tissue culture media and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Euroclone Celbio (Milano, Italy). Dopamine, glutamate, d-butaclamol, SKF-81297, and the rat monoclonal anti-D1 receptor antibody (clone 1-1-F11-S.E6) were purchased from Sigma. Glycine was obtained from Tocris (Avonmouth, UK).

Dr. Hannah Monyer (Heidelberg University) kindly provided the NR2B cDNA, and the NR1 cDNA was a gift of Dr. Shigetada Nakanishi (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan).PSD and Triton-insoluble Fraction Preparation—Striatal PSD were isolated according to Carlin et al. (20Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) with minor modifications as described previously (21Gardoni F. Caputi A. Cimino M. Pastorino L. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1733-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, the tissue was homogenized in ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose containing 1 mm Hepes, 1 mm MgCl2,1 mm NaHCO3, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Diagnostic, Milano) at pH 7.4 (buffer A) and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 15 min. The resulting pellet (containing mitochondria and synaptosomes) was resuspended in ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose containing 1 mm Hepes, 1 mm NaHCO3, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer B); overlaid on a sucrose gradient (0.85 to 1.0 to 1.2 m); and centrifuged at 82,500 × g for 2 h. The fraction between 1.0 and 1.2 m was diluted with buffer B containing 1% Triton X-100, stirred at 4 °C for 15 min, and centrifuged at 82,500 × g for 30 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended, layered on a sucrose gradient (1.0 to 1.5 to 2.1 m), and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. The fraction between 1.5 and 2.1 m was removed and diluted with 150 mm KCl containing 1% Triton X-100. PSD were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C.To isolate the Triton-insoluble fraction (TIF), tissue was homogenized in ice-cold buffer A and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 15 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 mm Hepes and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in 75 mm KCl containing 1% Triton X-100, and TIF was collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. TIF was characterized by enrichment in PSD proteins as previously described (22Caputi A. Gardoni F. Cimino M. Pastorino L. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Ten micrograms of PSD were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies against either the NR1 subunit (1 μg/ml) or the D1 receptor (1:250 dilution; mouse monoclonal) in 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS (buffer C). Protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added, and incubation was continued for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were collected and extensively washed with buffer C. The resulting proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and blotted for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% low fat dry milk. Membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the anti-NR1 (1 μg/ml) or anti-D1 receptor (1:250 dilution) antibodies. Detection was performed by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Milano) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1500 dilution).Cloning, Expression, and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—The C-terminal regions of the D1 receptor (D1-CT-(321–446)) and of the D5 receptor (D5-CT-(373–477)) and two fragments of the NR1 subunit C terminus (NR1-CT-(834–930) and NR1-CT-(834–892)) were generated by PCR amplification, cloned into the pGEX-KG plasmid, and expressed in BL21 competent cells. Synthesis of recombinant proteins was induced by 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) for 2–4h. The bacteria were lysed, and the proteins were purified by incubation with glutathione-agarose beads (50% (v/v) in PBS) for 12 h at 4 °C as previously described (23Gardoni F. Schrama L.H. van Dalen J.J. Gispen W.H. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Affinity Purification (“Pull-out”)—TIF proteins (35 μg) were diluted with PBS containing 0.1% SDS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with glutathione-agarose beads saturated with GST fusion proteins. Beads were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-NR1 and anti-NR2A/B antibodies.Generation of Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET2) Fusion Constructs—The D1 receptor and NR1a subunit coding sequences were amplified out of their original vectors using sense and antisense primers containing unique XhoI and BamHI sites and Hin- dIII and BamHI sites, respectively, and the native Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Milano) to generate stop codon-free fragments. The D1 receptor fragment was cloned in-frame into the Renilla luciferase-containing vector pRluc-N2(h) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Milano) to generate the plasmid D1-Rluc. The NR1a fragment was cloned in-frame into the pGFP2-N2(h) vector containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP2) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to generate the plasmid NR1-GFP2. The D1-Rluc receptor was tested for its efficiency in activating adenylyl cyclase in transfected COS-7 cells as previously described (24Missale C. Boroni F. Castelletti L. Dal Toso R. Gabellini N. Sigala S. Spano P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23392-23398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The influence of GFP2 on glutamate-mediated 45Ca2+ influx in COS-7 cells cotransfected with NR1-GFP2 and NR2B was assessed by standard methods.Cell Culture, Transfection, and BRET2 Assay—COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Semiconfluent cells were cotransfected for 3 h with D1-Rluc and NR1-GFP2 at a 1:4 DNA ratio, which was shown to give the best BRET2 signal, in the absence or presence of NR2B using the LipofectAMINE technique (Invitrogen, Milano). The total amount of DNA was kept at 10 μg. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were harvested, centrifuged, and resuspended in PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml d-glucose. Approximately 50,000 cells/well were distributed in a 96-well microplate (white Optiplate, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated in the absence or presence of 50 μm dopamine, 100 μm glutamate, and 10 μm glycine for 10 min at 37 °C. DeepBlueC™ coelenterazine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added at a final concentration of 5 μm, and BRET2 signals were determined using a Fusion™ universal microplate analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), which allows sequential integration of signals detected at 390/400 and 505/510 nm. Untransfected cells and cells transfected with D1-Rluc alone were used to define the nonspecific signals, and cells transfected with the pRluc-GFP2 control vector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were used as positive controls. The BRET signal was calculated as the difference in the ratio between emission at 510 and 395 nm of cotransfected Rluc and GFP2 fusion proteins and the ratio between emission at 510 and 395 nm of the Rluc fusion protein alone.Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—HEK293 cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Semiconfluent cells were transfected with different combinations of D1 receptor, NR1-GFP2, and NR2B cDNAs using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 5% normal goat serum for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with either the rat monoclonal anti-D1 receptor antibody (1:600 dilution in PBS containing 1% normal goat serum) or the anti-PDI antibody (1:400 dilution in PBS containing 1% normal goat serum) and then for 45 min at room temperature with the Cy3-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution). The immunolabeled cells were recorded with a Bio-Rad laser scanning confocal microscope. Untransfected cells and omission of the primary antibodies were used as negative controls.Sequestration Assay—HEK293 cells, which spontaneously express different G protein-coupled receptor kinases and arrestin (25Menard L. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Lin F.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), were transfected with the D1 receptor in the absence or presence of NR1 and NR2B subunits using the LipofectAMINE 2000 method, plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips, and allowed to recover for 1 day. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 10 μm SKF-81297 and processed as described above for confocal microscopy detection of the D1 receptor.Membrane Preparation and [3H]SCH23390 Binding—Cells were rinsed, harvested, and centrifuged at 100 × g for 10 min. Cells were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer in 5 mm Tris-HCl containing 2 mm EDTA and a mixture of protease inhibitors (pH 7.8) and centrifuged at 80 × g for 10 min to pellet unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl containing 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and the protease inhibitors (pH 7.8), layered on a 35% sucrose cushion, and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 90 min to separate the light vesicular and heavy membrane fractions as described by Lamey et al. (26Lamey M. Thompson M. Varghese G. Chi H. Sawzdargo M. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9415-9421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The heavy fraction, at the bottom of the sucrose cushion, was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl containing 5 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, and 120 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) and used for binding assay. Protein concentration was determined according to Lowry et al. (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using DC protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad, Milano). Aliquots of membrane suspension (50 μg of protein/sample) were incubated at room temperature for 90 min with a saturating concentration (4 nm) of [3H]SCH-23390 (86 Ci/mmol; Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences). Nonspecific binding was defined with 1 μm d-butaclamol. The reaction was stopped by rapid filtration under reduced pressure through Whatman GF/C filters.RESULTSDopamine D1and Glutamate NMDA Receptors Are Co-clustered in Striatal PSD—Striatal PSD were isolated and analyzed for the presence of D1 receptors and other PSD-associated proteins. Fig. 1A shows the results from Western blot analysis performed with different tissue fractions with antibodies recognizing the D1 receptor, the NR1 subunit, α-Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and protein kinase Cϵ. As previously reported (28Gines S. Hillion J. Torvinen M. Le Crom S. Casado V. Canela E.I. Rondin S. Lew J.Y. Watson S. Zoli M. Agnati L.F. Vernier P. Lluis C. Ferré S. Fuxe K. Franco R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8606-8611Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), immunoreaction with the anti-D1 receptor antibody revealed a major specific band of ∼50 kDa. This species was detectable in all tissue fractions, but was enriched in the PSD fraction. This pattern of D1 receptor distribution paralleled that of α-Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor, two known PSD constituents. The purification yield and the purity of our PSD fraction were confirmed by the absence of immunoreactivity for protein kinase Cϵ, a protein present exclusively in the presynaptic compartment. Co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed to evaluate whether D1 and NMDA receptors might interact in striatal PSD. As shown in Fig. 1B, a 50-kDa band, which was detected by the anti-D1 receptor antibody, was present in PSD proteins immunoprecipitated with the antibody raised against the NR1 subunit (lane 2). Similarly, the anti-D1 receptor antibody immunoprecipitated a 116-kDa band corresponding to NR1 (lane 3), indicating relevant complex formation between these two holoreceptor moieties in vivo. These bands did not appear when either an irrelevant antibody, such as that directed against protein kinase Cϵ (lane 4), was used or the precipitating antibody was omitted (lane 5).Pull-out experiments were then performed with GST fusion proteins containing the C-terminal domains of both the D1 receptor and NR1 subunit. Striatal TIF proteins were incubated with GST fusion proteins containing the D1 receptor C-terminal tail or, as a control, the D5 receptor C terminus. D1 and D5 receptors display, in fact, particular sequence divergence within the C-terminal domain, a region that might confer subtype-selective properties (29Missale C. Nash R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2700) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, a 116-kDa species, detected by the anti-NR1 antibody, was pulled out from striatal TIF by GST-D1-CT-(321–446) (lane 3), but not by GST-D5-CT-(373–477) (lane 4) or GST alone (lane 2). By contrast, the NR2A/B subunits that were present in our TIF preparation (lane 1) did not interact with GST-D1-CT-(321–446), indicating that, in striatal PSD, the D1 receptor selectively complexes with the NR1 subunit of the NMDA channel through its C-terminal tail. To identify the NR1 region responsible for this interaction, GST fusion proteins containing two different domains of the NR1 C-terminal tail were constructed. As shown in Fig. 2B, GST-NR1-CT-(834–930), encoding the entire C-terminal region of the NR1a/b isoforms, was able to pull-out luciferase-tagged D1 receptors from solubilized membrane preparations obtained from transfected HEK293 cells. This activity was still present when the region downstream of the alternatively spliced C1 domain in the NR1 subunit C terminus was deleted, suggesting that both NR1a/b and NR1e/f isoforms may potentially interact with the D1 receptor.Fig. 2The D1 receptor and NR1 subunit interact through their C-terminal domains.A, fusion proteins of GST with the C-terminal domains of the D1 (GST-D1-CT-(321–446)) and the D5 (GST-D5-CT-(373–477)) receptors bound to glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with 35 μg of striatal TIF, and proteins that were pulled out were immunoreacted with the anti-NR1 and anti-NR2A/B antibodies. The D1 receptor C-terminal tail (lane 3), but not the D5 receptor C-terminal tail (lane 4), was able to bind the NR1 subunit, but not the NR2A/B subunits. B, fusion proteins of GST with two different fragments of the NR1 subunit C terminus (GST-NR1-CT-(834–930) and GST-NR1-CT-(834–930)) were incubated with membranes obtained from HEK293 cells expressing the D1 receptor fused to luciferase (D1-Rluc). After extensive washing, the glutathione-agarose beads containing the pulled out proteins were assayed for luciferase activity using DeepBlueC coelenterazine as a substrate. Both NR1 C-terminal fragments were able to bind the D1 receptor. Bars represent the means ± S.E. of three experiments. *, p < 0.001 versus GST (Student' t test).

To evaluate whether D1 and NMDA receptors could exist as oligomers in living cells, we used an improved BRET technology (BRET2, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) that takes advantage of the properties of a particular luciferase substrate, DeepBlueC coelenterazine, which allows a spectral resolution between the Rluc and GFP2 emissions at ∼105 nm, a characteristic that confers high sensitivity to the assay. For this purpose, the D1 receptor was fused to Renilla luciferase, and the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor was fused to GFP2. The kinetic and transduction properties of these fusion receptors were superimposable with those of their wild-type counterparts (data not shown). BRET2 signals were determined in COS-7 cells simultaneously or individually expressing the D1-Rluc and NR1-GFP2 constructs. As shown in Fig. 3A, no BRET2 was observed in cells expressing only NR1-GFP2, and a negligible nonspecific signal was detected in cells expressing only the D1-Rluc construct. A significant BRET2 signal was observed in cells expressing a fusion construct covalently linking Rluc to GFP2 (pRluc-GFP2), confirming the importance of molecular proximity between the BRET partners for signal detection. Coexpression of the tagged D1 receptor and NR1 subunit yielded a BRET2 ratio that was significantly higher than that observed with cells expressing D1-Rluc alone or with cells individually expressing D1-Rluc and NR1-GFP2 and mixed before analysis. The specificity of this interaction is illustrated by the absence of significant energy transfer between the D1-Rluc construct and the pGFP2-N2(h) vector (Fig. 3A). This BRET2 ratio was unchanged when the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor was also expressed, suggesting that there is no competition between NR1 and NR2B for interaction with the D1 receptor. Moreover as shown in Fig. 3B, the BRET2 signal recorded in cells cotransfected with D1-Rluc, NR1-GFP2, and NR2B was insensitive to stimulation by 50 μm dopamine with or without 100 μm glutamate and 10 μm glycine. These data demonstrate a physical proximity between D1-Rluc and NR1-GFP2 that can be explained best by the formation of constitutive protein dimers.Fig. 3Detection D1 receptor and NR1 subunit interaction by BRET2. The D1 receptor fused to luciferase (D1-Rluc) and the NR1 subunit fused to GFP2 (NR1-GFP2) were transfected either individually or simultaneously in COS-7 cells. The DeepBlueC coelenterazine substrate was added at a final concentration of 5 μm, and BRET2 signals were determined using the Fusion™ universal microplate analyzer.

Nuclear ICN binds to a highly conserved DNA-binding transcription factor called CSL (also known as RBP-Jκ, CBF1, Suppressor of Hairless, and Lag-1) and recruits Mastermind-like transcriptional co-activators to form a transcriptional activation complex. Using bioinformatics tools, we identified a Rel homology region (RHR) within CSL that was used as a guide to determine the minimal protein requirements for ternary complex formation. The RHR of CSL contains both the N- and C-terminal β-sheet domains (RHR-n and RHR-c) of typical Rel transcription factors, as judged by circular dichroism spectra. Binding of monomeric CSL to DNA requires the entire RHR of CSL and an additional 125-residue N-terminal sequence, whereas binding to ICN requires only the RHR-n domain. Although the RAM (RBP-Jκ (recombination-signal-sequence-binding protein for Jκ genes)-associated molecule) domain of ICN is flexible and relatively unstructured as an isolated polypeptide in solution, it associates stably with CSL on DNA. Recruitment of Mastermind-like 1 (MAML1) to CSL·ICN complexes on DNA requires inclusion of the ankyrin repeat domain of ICN, and N- and C-terminal sequences of CSL extending beyond the DNA-binding region. The requirement for cooperative assembly of the MAML1·ICN·CSL·DNA complex suggests that a primary function of ICN is to render CSL competent for MAML loading. On the basis of our results, we present a working structural model for the organization of the MAML1·ICN·CSL·DNA complex.

Notch proteins act as receptors in an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway that controls differentiation and proliferation in response to ligands expressed on neighboring cells (reviewed in Refs. 1Artavanis-Tsakonas S.

ICN then migrates to the nucleus where it activates the transcription of target genes. ICNs are modular polypeptides comprised of an N-terminal RAM domain of ∼110 amino acids, a set of seven iterated ankyrin repeats (3Zweifel M.E. Barrick D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14344-14356Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 4Zweifel M.E. Barrick D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14357-14367Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and less conserved C-terminal regions that include a transcriptional activation domain and a far C-terminal PEST sequence. The ankyrin repeat (ANK) domain is the most highly conserved region of ICN and is essential for all known Notch functions (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4875) Google Scholar). The primary target of ICN in the nucleus is the highly conserved DNA-binding transcription factor, CSL (also known as RBP-Jκ, CBF1, Suppressor of Hairless (Su)H), and Lag-1) (5Fortini M.E. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1994; 79: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 6Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A.

Previous analysis of CSL proteins using primary sequence alignment tools has failed to detect similarity to other known transcription factors. In the absence of ICN, CSL represses transcription by virtue of interactions with a number of co-repressors, including SMRT/N-CoR (silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors/nuclear repressor co-repressor), CIR (CBF1-interacting co-repressor), and KyoT2 (8Hsieh J.J.

Binding of ICNs not only displaces co-repressors from CSL proteins but also recruits transcriptional co-activators to CSL·ICN complexes on DNA. Several studies indicate that Mastermind-like polypeptides such as Lag-3 in worms (11Petcherski A.G. Kimble J. Nature. 2000; 405: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and mammalian Mastermind-like-1 (MAML1) are core components of a higher order transcriptional activation complex on DNA (12Wu L. Aster J.C. Blacklow S.C. Lake R. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Griffin J.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The existence of a CSL·ICN·Mastermind signaling complex was foreshadowed by genetic screens in the fly revealing that mutations in each of these genes cause similar “neurogenic” loss-of-function phenotypes (13Schweisguth F.

Although the level of ICN in the nucleus of most cells undergoing physiologic Notch signaling is too low to be detected readily, certain T cell leukemias associated with chromosomal translocations involving the human NOTCH1 gene express nuclear ICN1-like polypeptides at high levels (16Aster J. Pear W. Hasserjian R. Erba H. Davi F. Luo B. Scott M. Baltimore D. Sklar J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Capobianco's group (17Jeffries S. Robbins D.J. Capobianco A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3927-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) exploited a cell line derived from a NOTCH1 leukemia, SUPT-1, to demonstrate the presence of endogenous high molecular mass (>1 MDa) nuclear complexes containing ICN1, MAML1, and CSL. We have also shown that the effect of disruption of MAML1 recruitment on Notch-dependent cells resembles that of inhibition of γ-secretase cleavage of membrane-tethered Notch (18Weng A.P. Nam Y. Wolfe M.S. Pear W.S. Griffin J.D. Blacklow S.C. Aster J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). These studies and previous genetic and functional data suggest that CSL·ICN·MAML1 is an essential subcomplex within a larger protein assembly required for the transcription of Notch target genes. MAML1 and other members of the MAML family are polypeptides of ∼1000 amino acid residues predicted to be of low structural complexity, suggesting that they function as scaffolds for further recruitment of additional co-activators and/or the transcription machinery. The N-terminal region of MAML1 and related polypeptides contains a sequence that associates with ICN and CSL (12Wu L. Aster J.C. Blacklow S.C. Lake R. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Griffin J.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 19Petcherski A.G. Kimble J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R471-R473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). When expressed as a truncated moiety, the N-terminal ICN-interaction region of MAML1 is a potent dominant negative inhibitor of Notch signals, indicating that C-terminal sequences are also needed for proper function (12Wu L. Aster J.C. Blacklow S.C. Lake R. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Griffin J.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate these C-terminal sequences bind the transcriptional co-activator p300 as well as other unknown factors that are needed for activation of transcription from chromatinized templates in vitro (20Fryer C.J. Lamar E. Turbachova I. Kintner C. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1397-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 21Wallberg A.E. Pedersen K. Lendahl U. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7812-7819Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). At present there is limited information about the structure of CSL and its higher order complexes with ICN and MAML1. Here, using bioinformatics tools, we have located the two canonical domains of a previously unidentified Rel homology region (RHR) within CSL, suggesting that CSL is a distant relative of the Rel homology family of transcription factors. With these domains as a guide, we define the regions of CSL required for the formation of subcomplexes and for assembly of ternary complexes on DNA, showing that both ICN and CSL must be present to recruit MAMLl. These mapping studies support the classification of CSL as a member of the Rel homology family of transcription factors. The requirement for cooperative assembly of the ternary complex on DNA, combined with the CSL mapping studies, suggests that a primary function of ICN1 is to render CSL competent for MAML1 loading. DNA Constructs—All CSL constructs are derived from isoform 3 of human CSL. CSL cDNAs used to produce polypeptides using in vitro transcription/translation (IVT) reactions were amplified by PCR and purified by gel extraction. IVT reactions were performed using TNT® T7 Quick for PCR-DNA (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For bacterial expression, cDNAs encoding GST-CSL RHR (residues Lys-156–Gly-435), GST-CSL RHR-n (residues Lys-156–Pro-332), and GST-CSL RHR-c (residues Ala-335–Gly-435) were assembled in the vector pGEX-4T-1. Each construct contained a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition site (ENLYFQG) at the junction between GST and the CSL sequence. cDNAs encoding the polypeptides Arg-1761—Gly-2127 (RAMANK) and Met-1873—Gly-2127 (ANK) of human Notch1 were inserted in frame downstream of GST and TEV cleavage site coding sequences in a modified version of the vector pDEST15 using GATEWAY technology (Invitrogen). A cDNA encoding the polypeptide Arg-1761—Ser-1890 (RAM) was inserted in-frame between a similar 5′-GST-TEV site coding sequence and a 3′-GTHHHHHH tag in a modified pET vector. A cDNA encoding residues Leu-13–His-74 of human MAML1 (MAML1-(13–74)) was inserted in-frame downstream of a hexahistidine tag and TEV cleavage site. Expression constructs for full-sized MAML1 (12Wu L. Aster J.C. Blacklow S.C. Lake R. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Griffin J.D. Nat.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11336-11343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) have been described previously. Protein Purification—GST-CSL fusion protein expression was induced for 3 h in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm) during log phase. Cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, sucrose (20% w/v), 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin. Solubilized proteins were adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose beads, which were washed with buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated with 500 units of recombinant His-tagged TEV protease (Invitrogen) at 25 °C for 36–48 h. Released RHR-c was further purified by anion exchange chromatography on Mono-Q resin (Amersham Biosciences) using a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1 m)in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm DTT and 1 mm EDTA. In a final step, RHR and RHR-c were purified to >95% homogeneity by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA. Notch1 polypeptides were expressed and purified similarly. After cleavage, His-tagged TEV was cleared from soluble RAMANK and ANK by adsorption to Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen). Soluble RAM-H6 was bound to Ni-NTA-agarose beads and eluted in buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole. All three proteins were then further purified by anion exchange chromatography on Mono-Q resin (Amersham Biosciences) using a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1 m)in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm DTT and 1 mm EDTA. Finally, ANK and RAMANK were further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA. Expression of H6-tagged MAML1-(13–74) was induced as described above for CSL and ICN polypeptides. H6-MAML-(13–74) was purified from inclusion bodies by solubilization in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 6 m guanidinium HCl and 150 mm NaCl, followed by affinity chromatography on a Ni-NTA-Sepharose column. After extensive dialysis against 5% acetic acid, the protein was lyophilized, dissolved in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.9, containing 5 mm DTT and 0.5 mm EDTA, and cleaved with TEV protease. Free MAML1-(13–74) polypeptide was purified further by cation exchange chromatography (MonoS 5/5 HR, Amersham Biosciences) using a gradient of NaCl (0–1 m) in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 5 mm DTT and 1 mm EDTA. Purified MAML1-(13–74) was dialyzed against 5% acetic acid and lyophilized. Before use, MAML1-(13–74) was dissolved in 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, buffer with 150 mm NaCl and 5 mm DTT. Bioinformatics—Multiple sequence alignments were performed using CLUSTAL-W. 2www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw. Secondary structure prediction for all protein sequences was carried out using the PHD program (23Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol.

The structural homology of CSL proteins (human CSL and Drosophila Suppressor of Hairless) to Rel proteins of known three-dimensional structure was detected using the 3D-PSSM fold-recognition program 3www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~3dpssm/.

Biophysical Studies—Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were acquired on an Aviv 62DS spectropolarimeter equipped with a thermoelectric temperature controller. Protein concentrations were determined according to Edelhoch (27Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3000) Google Scholar). Samples of CSL RHR-c (36 μm), RAM (10 μm), ANK (10 μm), and RAMANK (10 μm) were prepared in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.2 mm DTT and 150 mm NaCl. CSL RHR (24 μm) was prepared in the same buffer with 300 mm NaCl. CD spectra of CSL RHR, RAM, ANK, and RAMANK were recorded at 4 °C in a 1-mm path length cuvette as the average of five scans using a 3-s acquisition time. The CSL RHR-c sample was scanned 10 times with an acquisition time of 30 s. Thermal melts of each Notch1 polypeptide (5 μm) were performed in a 1-cm path length cuvette in the same buffer. The CD signal was monitored at 222 nm using a 2-min equilibration period, a 30-s signal acquisition time, and a step size of 1 °C from 4 to 75 °C. The thermal denaturation curves of RAMANK and ANK were ∼95% reversible. The Tm for unfolding was calculated by finding the minimum of the first derivative of the CD signal with respect to 1/T. Equilibrium sedimentation measurements were performed on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical Ultracentrifuge using an An-Ti rotor and six-sector equilibrium centerpieces. To determine the masses of ANK and RAMANK, rotor speeds of 10,000, 15,000, and 20,000 rpm were used. Samples of ANK and RAMANK, prepared in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.2 mm DTT, were dialyzed exhaustively against the same buffer. Protein samples (ANK: 1.8 and 6 μm; RAMANK: 1 and 3.3 μm) were prepared by dilution with dialysate, which was also used to fill the reference channels. Absorbance data were acquired at three wavelengths (229, 236, and 280 nm) by averaging 10 scans with a 0.001-cm radial step size. Molecular weights were calculated by fitting data sets to a single ideal species model using Microsoft Excel software and partial specific volumes of 0.726 for ANK and 0.724 for RAMANK (28Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science.

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed using a 32P-labeled CSL-specific oligonucleotide probe as described previously (12Wu L. Aster J.C. Blacklow S.C. Lake R. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Griffin J.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). GST Bead Binding Assays—Glutathione-Sepharose beads were mixed at 4 °C for 1 h with cleared bacterial lysates containing GST fusion polypeptides. After five washes with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), beads with GST fusion proteins (20–30 μl/experiment) were incubated with potential binding partners for 1 h at 4 °C followed by five washes in the same buffer. Bound proteins were released by heating (100 °C) for 10 min in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. After electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Detection of the Rel Homology Regions of CSL—The major isoform of human CSL encodes a protein of 486 amino acids (Fig. 1A). Known biochemical activities of CSL include sequence-specific DNA binding (29Tun T. Hamaguchi Y. Matsunami N. Furukawa T. Honjo T. Kawaichi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), association with ICN polypeptides (5Fortini M.E. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1994; 79: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), and formation of higher order complexes with MAML polypeptides (11Petcherski A.G. Kimble J. Nature. 2000; 405: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 12Wu L. Aster J.C. Blacklow S.C. Lake R. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Griffin J.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). To investigate the structural basis for these activities, we used a bioinformatics approach to guide the design of CSL constructs. Because significant primary sequence homology between CSL proteins and other proteins in the data base was not detectable, we searched for evidence of homology to protein domains of known structure using the 3D-PSSM fold-recognition program, which compares input sequences with the existing protein fold library using structure-based sequence profiles and secondary structure prediction (25Fischer D. Barret C. Bryson K. Elofsson A. Godzik A. Jones D. Karplus K.J. Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Pawowski K. Rost B. Rychlewski L. Sternberg M. Proteins. 1999; 3: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 26Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). 3D-PSSM returned the RHR of c-rel as the top hit for human CSL (residues 171–433; E value, 0.121 (where E is theoretical expectation value)). Moreover, the Drosophila orthologue of CSL, SU(H), also retrieved an RHR protein, the p65 subunit of NF-κB, with a confidence level of more than 90%. Both query sequences retrieved other RHR-containing proteins as well, such as TonEBP (residues 159–433 of CSL; E value, 0.193) and NFAT1. These results suggest that CSL proteins are distantly related to the Rel homology family of transcription factors (Fig. 1, A and B). The RHR, a conserved region among proteins of the Rel family (30Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4585) Google Scholar), consists of two immunoglobulin-like folds of β-sheets (31Muller C.W. Rey F.A. Sodeoka M. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 32Ghosh G. van Duyne G. Ghosh S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 373: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) termed RHR-n and RHR-c (also known as a transcription factor Ig-like (TIG) domain), predicted by 3D-PSSM to correspond to residues 159–328 and 341–433, respectively, of CSL. The RHR-c folds are also identified in both CSL proteins by PFAM (protein families data base of alignments and hidden Markov models), but the RHR-n folds are not. Because the structures of previously characterized RHR-n domains are more highly divergent than the RHR-c domains, a poorer alignment of the CSL RHR-n domain is not surprising or unexpected. Moreover, the convincing prediction of the RHR-c domain itself argues strongly for the coexistence of an accompanying RHR-n domain. To test directly whether the predicted RHR region of CSL contains two separate domains in which the predominant structural elements are β-sheets, we estimated the secondary structure content of the predicted RHR and RHR-c domains by CD. These measurements show that the predicted RHR region of CSL, as well as the isolated RHR-c domain, contains a predominance of β-stranded secondary structure and little α-helix (Fig. 1C). With the 3D-PSSM predictions, the CD findings are consistent with the presence of a complete RHR domain within CSL proteins. The predicted RHR domain boundaries were combined with additional information to guide subsequent structure-function studies. Truncation points outside of the RHR domain boundaries were chosen on the basis of primary sequence homology and secondary structure prediction. Homology between CSL and RBP-L, a related protein that binds the same DNA sequence but not ICNs (33Minoguchi S. Taniguchi Y. Kato H. Okazaki T. Strobl L.J. Zimber-Strobl U. Bornkamm G.W. Honjo T.

C-terminal to the RHR of CSL, residue 452 marks the end of a stretch of 20 residues (433–452) predicted by PHD (23Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2640) Google Scholar, 24Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar) to contain helical structure. The C-terminal 34 residues 453–486 consist of a low complexity sequence with little predicted secondary structure. Finally, sites chosen for intradomain truncations (e.g. residues 79 and 400) lie within regions predicted by PHD to lack secondary structure. Guided by the informatics results, we therefore made CSL expression constructs with N termini starting at positions 31, 79, and 156 and C-terminal truncations at positions 332, 400, 435, and 452. CSL Requires Residues 31–435 to Bind DNA as a Monomer— Using these constructs, we first investigated the requirements for binding of CSL to DNA using an EMSA (Fig. 2A). Removal of the first 31 residues of CSL does not interfere with DNA binding, but constructs with N termini beginning at residue 79 or 156 fail to bind DNA (Fig. 3A), indicating that the RHR region alone is insufficient. C-terminal truncation of CSL to residue 452 or 435 does not interfere with DNA binding, but further truncations to residue 400 or 332, which interrupt or delete the RHR-c domain, abrogate DNA binding. Thus, CSL residues 31–435, which encompass the complete RHR and an additional N-terminal extension of 125 amino acids, are both necessary and sufficient to bind DNA.Fig. 3Purification and characterization of RAMANK, RAM, ANK, and MAML1-(13–74).A, Coomassie staining of purified RAM, ANK, RAMANK, and MAML-13–74 after SDS-PAGE.

Each form of CSL alone binds DNA, and the two CSL·DNA complexes migrate differently in the EMSA (Fig. 2B). When both CSL species are bound to DNA, heterodimers (which would give an electrophoretic mobility shift between CSL and CSL-TRX) are not observed, confirming that CSL binds DNA as a monomer, as reported previously for mouse CSL using nuclear extracts (35Chung C.N.

We identify glyceroneogenesis as a target of thiazolidinediones in cultured adipocytes and fat tissues of Wistar rats.

Type 2 diabetes, a major complication of obesity, is a growing problem in many developed countries. Thus, it is important to determine the causes of this affliction and develop more effective treatments. An etiologic factor in type 2 diabetes is an elevated fatty acid level in the blood (1Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37731-37734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar, 2McGarry J.D. Science. 1992; 258: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 3Randle P.

A. 1994; 91: 10878-10882Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Plasma fatty acids originate from the diet, or, during fasting, they derive from the lipolysis of triacylglycerol, the major form of stored energy in adipose tissue. High circulating levels of fatty acids are known to interfere with glucose utilization in muscle (3Randle P. Garland P. Hales C. Newsholme E. Lancet. 1963; 1: 785-789Abstract PubMed Scopus (3794) Google Scholar) and promote insulin resistance that develops into type 2 diabetes (4Boden G. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes (5Unger R.H. Orci L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The increased adipose tissue mass in obese people leads to a proportionally larger fatty acid release into the blood as compared with lean people. In one rodent model of obesity (Zucker rats), during development of insulin resistance, fasting plasma fatty acids increase before hyperglycemia arises, which is consistent with a cause and effect relationship (6Lee Y. Hirose H. Ohneda M. Johnson J.H. McGarry J.D. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10878-10882Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). It is likely that one reason that a low-fat, low-calorie diet is often an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes is that it reduces circulating fatty acids. Oral insulin-sensitizing drugs are an important adjunct to diet in the treatment of diabetes. Thiazolidinediones are a class of antidiabetic drugs that increase systemic insulin sensitivity in diabetic animal models and humans (1Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37731-37734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Two such drugs, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, are used in humans to treat type 2 diabetes. They are agonists for peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor γ (PPARγ), 1The abbreviations used are: PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; PEPCK-C, cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; GyK, glycerol kinase; SCAT, subcutaneous adipose tissue; PRAT, perirenal adipose tissue; OAT, omental adipose tissue. a member of the nuclear hormone receptor family of transcription factors, which is expressed in fat cells (7Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar). Although much is known about the molecular mechanisms of thiazolidinedione action, many questions remain about the physiological targets mediating better insulin sensitivity. Several lines of evidence have led to the idea that the increased insulin sensitivity of liver and skeletal muscle is secondary to the direct effect of these drugs on adipocytes (1Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37731-37734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). A potential thiazolidinedione target in adipocytes concerns fatty acid release. Indeed, thiazolidinedione treatment in vivo is associated with an increase of fatty acid uptake into fat depots, as observed by metabolic studies (8Oakes N.D. Thalén P.G. Jacinto S.M. Ljung B. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and a decrease in circulating fatty acid levels (8Oakes N.D. Thalén P.G. Jacinto S.M. Ljung B. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 9Saltiel A.R. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1661-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in Zucker rats, this PPARγ agonist-induced decrease precedes the reduction in glucose levels. This suggests that decreases in fatty acid levels may be important for the insulin-sensitizing action of thiazolidinediones (10Way J.M. Harrington W.W. Brown K.K. Gottschalk W.K. Sundseth S.S. Mansfield T.A. Ramachandran R.K. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Plasma fatty acid levels represent a balance between their release from triacylglycerol stores in adipose tissue and their clearance into tissues that need energy. In humans, it is estimated that 30% or more of the fatty acids liberated by lipolysis are re-esterified into newly synthesized triacylglycerol. This apparent “futile cycle” of simultaneous lipolysis and re-esterification creates an important mechanism for energy homeostasis (11Van Harmelen V. Reynisdottir S. Cianflone K. Degerman E. Hoffstedt J. Nilsell K. Sniderman A. Arner P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18243-18251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Regulation of fatty acid re-esterification rate allows fat cells to adapt rapidly to changes in peripheral requirements for fatty acids. The re-esterification process requires the production of glycerol-3-phosphate as a substrate for fatty acid reesterification into triacylglycerol (12Beale E.G. Hammer R.E. Antoine B. Forest C. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1695-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because glucose supply to the tissue is limited during lipolysis and because adipocytes have no significant glycerol kinase activity, under physiological conditions (13Hubbard R.W. Voorheis H.P. Therriault D.G. Lipids. 1969; 5: 114-120Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), glycerol-3-phosphate must be synthesized from non-carbohydrate precursors such as lactate, pyruvate, and amino acids. This pathway, glyceroneogenesis, was discovered more than 30 years ago (14Reshef L. Hanson R.W. Ballard F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1994-2001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Reshef L. Hanson R.W. Ballard F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5979-5984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that expression of the gene encoding the key glyceroneogenic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-C, EC 4.1.1.32; Refs. 12Beale E.G. Hammer R.E. Antoine B. Forest C.

Chem. 1970; 245: 5979-5984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is strongly induced by thiazolidinediones via a mechanism involving PPARγ binding and activation in adipose tissue (16Glorian M. Duplus E. Beale E.G. Scott D.K. Granner D.K. Forest C. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 933-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the present work, we show that PEPCK-C is involved in the action of thiazolidinediones in lowering fatty acid release from adipose tissue. Glycerol kinase was recently demonstrated as another thiazolidinedione-induced enzyme involved in the same process (17Guan H.P. Li Y. Jensen M.V. Newgard C.B. Steppan C.M. Lazar M.A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). However, our analysis of the respective contributions of glycerol kinase and PEPCK-C suggests that in cultured adipocytes, glyceroneogenesis accounts for at least 75% of the thiazolidinedione effect. In Vivo and ex Vivo Experiments—Animal studies were conducted according to the French Guidelines for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals. Female Wistar rats (13 weeks old) were obtained from Iffa Credo (l'Arbresle, France). The animals were maintained under a constant light/dark cycle (light from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.) and given free access to food and water. The rats were treated by oral gavage with 5 mg/kg/ day rosiglitazone (GlaxoSmithKline) each morning at 10 a.m. for 4 days. Rats were deprived of food for 3 h after the last dose of rosiglitazone, and they were killed by decapitation at 1 p.m. Omental, subcutaneous, and perirenal fat pads were removed. One portion was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen for later determination of PEPCK-C enzymatic activity. The remaining tissue was cut into pieces of about 50 mg and incubated in 60-mm dishes in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2 at 37 °C in 3 ml of glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 3% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma no. A6003) and 25 mm pyruvate in the presence or absence of 1 μm isoproterenol or 150 μm 3-mercaptopicolinic acid where indicated. When [14C1]pyruvate was used (0.2 μCi/ml), the isotopic dilution was 1000-fold. After a 2-h incubation, non-esterified fatty acid and glycerol were measured in the incubation medium, and the corresponding tissue fragments were frozen in liquid nitrogen before lipid extraction. Lipids were extracted from the different adipose tissue fragments according to the simplified method of Bligh and Dyer (18Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 31: 911Crossref Scopus (43084) Google Scholar), and their subsequent [14C1]pyruvate incorporation was estimated by counting the radioactivity associated with this fraction. Cell Culture—The 3T3-F442A adipocyte cell line was differentiated as described previously (16Glorian M. Duplus E. Beale E.G. Scott D.K. Granner D.K. Forest C. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 933-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and then treated for 76 h with 1 μm rosiglitazone or 5 μm pioglitazone in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The medium was changed daily. The day of the experiment, the last thiazolidinedione treatment was performed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without glucose and serum but supplemented with 0.3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for 3 h. In the experiments carried out under lipolytic conditions, 1 μm isoproterenol was added in the same medium described above, supplemented with 25 mm unlabeled pyruvate and [14C1]pyruvate (0.5 μCi/ 60-mm plate), and 3-mercaptopicolinic acid where indicated. Fatty acid release and glyceroneogenesis (incorporation of pyruvate) were measured 30 min later by the same procedures used with fat explants. In the case of the experiments described in Fig. 5, radiolabeled substrates (1–2 μCi) were added in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer with 0.3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for 1 h before lipid extraction. Various glycerol and pyruvate concentrations and 80 μm oleic acid were used as indicated in the figure. Biochemical Analyses and Statistics—Glycerol and non-esterified fatty acids were measured in the incubation medium using colorimetric assays: the GPO Trinder, a glucose oxidase kit from Sigma-Aldrich, was used for glycerol, and the acyl-CoA oxidase kit from Roche Diagnostics was used for fatty acids. PEPCK-C was measured in adipose tissues that were homogenized in 50 mm triethanolamine buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.25 m sucrose and submitted to a 100,000 × g centrifugation for 1 h to obtain the cytosol fraction. PEPCK-C enzymatic activity was determined spectrophotometrically in cytosol aliquots by the method of Chang and Lane (19Chang H.C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2413-2420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), based on CO2 exchange between labeled KHCO3 and oxaloacetate in the presence of inosine triphosphate and Mn2+. Glycerol kinase (GyK) enzymatic activity assay was performed as described in Guan et al. (17Guan H.P. Li Y. Jensen M.V. Newgard C.B. Steppan C.M. Lazar M.A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), except that 0.5 mm unlabeled glycerol and 50 μm [3H]glycerol were used, and reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Protein content was determined using the BCA protein assay kit from Sigma-Aldrich. Student's t test was used for statistical comparisons between paired groups. In Vivo Rosiglitazone Treatment Decreases Fatty Acid Release from Adipose Tissues in a Pyruvate-dependent Manner—We have shown previously (16Glorian M. Duplus E. Beale E.G. Scott D.K. Granner D.K. Forest C. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 933-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that thiazolidinediones increase the amount of PEPCK-C mRNA in adipocytes through a PPARγ-mediated increase in gene transcription. Because PEPCK-C is rate-limiting for glyceroneogenesis, we asked whether the effect of thiazolidinediones on fatty acid release from adipose tissue might involve glyceroneogenesis. We thus determined the effect of a 4-day treatment of rats with rosiglitazone on the subsequent in vitro release of glycerol and fatty acids from three sources of adipose tissue. Fatty acid release was measured with explants maintained in vitro for 2 h, with or without the glyceroneogenic precursor, pyruvate. Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) and two abdominal adipose tissues were chosen because of their known physiological differences (20Tchkonia T. Karagiannides I. Armour Forse R. Kirkland J.L. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 2001; 8: 227-234Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The two abdominal adipose tissue samples were from the fat pads adjacent to the kidneys (perirenal adipose tissue (PRAT)) and from the greater omentum (omental adipose tissue (OAT)). Pyruvate had no effect on glycerol release (Fig. 1A), although it reduced fatty acid release about 2-fold in PRAT and 3-fold in OAT (Fig. 1B), a result consistent with an increased capacity for the adipocytes from abdominal adipose tissues to re-esterify fatty acids under these conditions. The complete lipolysis of 1 mol of triacylglycerol yields 1 mol of glycerol and 3 mol of fatty acid. Thus, if 100% of the fatty acids were released, then the fatty acid/glycerol ratio would be 3.0. However, fatty acid recycling causes this ratio to be less than 3.0 (Fig. 1C). The fatty acid/glycerol ratio in the absence of added pyruvate indicates that fatty acid re-esterification ranges from 25% in SCAT of control animals (because released fatty acids = 2.25/3.0, or 75%, and the remaining 25% are re-esterified) up to 40% in PRAT and OAT (Fig. 1C). Because pyruvate significantly decreased the fatty acid/glycerol ratio in PRAT, a stimulation of fatty acid recycling is probably occurring (Fig. 1C) in this tissue. These data are easily explained by a pyruvate-dependent fatty acid recycling via glyceroneogenesis that contributes to a specific decrease in fatty acid release. Results also indicate that glyceroneogenesis is more active in adipose tissue samples taken from the abdomen than in those taken from the subcutaneous region. Rosiglitazone caused a significant, 41–64% decrease in fatty acid release from all three depots, in both the absence and presence of pyruvate (Fig. 1B). However, rosiglitazone caused only moderate, 7–28% decreases in glycerol release (Fig. 1A). Thus, rosiglitazone treatment reduced fatty acid output to a much greater extent than glycerol release from abdominal adipose tissues. Indeed, the fatty acid/glycerol ratio was decreased by 2–3-fold by rosiglitazone treatment of the rats, depending on the presence of pyruvate in PRAT and OAT (Fig. 1C). Such an observation suggests that the stimulation of fatty acid re-esterification is quantitatively more important than the inhibition of glycerol release for rosiglitazone to decrease fatty acid output from adipose tissue. This raises the possibility that thiazolidinediones block fatty acid release by stimulating glyceroneogenesis in a pyruvate-dependent manner. Rosiglitazone Increases Fatty Acid Re-esterification via Glyceroneogenesis and PEPCK-C—To confirm that rosiglitazone actually increases glyceroneogenesis in adipose tissue, we carried out the same experiment as that shown in Fig. 1, but in the presence of [14C1]pyruvate. [14C1]Pyruvate was chosen because, in contrast to C2- or C3-labeled molecules, the C1 carbon of pyruvate is conserved in glycerol-3-phosphate synthesis and is thus a specific marker for glyceroneogenesis. Under this condition, the proportion of the released fatty acid molecules that are re-esterified in adipocytes can be detected because they are incorporated as [14C1]glycerol-3-phosphate in triacylglycerol. As shown in Fig. 2A, the incorporation of [14C1]pyruvate into triacylglycerol occurred in all three adipose tissue depots, although it was higher in visceral fat than in subcutaneous fat. Rosiglitazone increased [14C1]pyruvate incorporation 1.5–2-fold in visceral adipose tissues, whereas that in the subcutaneous depot was only slightly affected. Thus, rosiglitazone activates glyceroneogenesis in visceral adipose tissues with an inverse correlation to fatty acid output. The involvement of glyceroneogenesis in re-esterification implies that PEPCK-C specific activity is augmented. This was confirmed by direct measurement of PEPCK-C activity in Fig. 2B. Rosiglitazone treatment increased PEPCK-C specific activity 1.5–2-fold, and the magnitudes of the responses correlated with the depot-specific increase in [14C1]pyruvate incorporation (Fig. 2A) as well as with the decrease in fatty acid release (Fig. 1B). Hence, the rosiglitazone-induced increase in PEPCK-C mRNA that has been reported previously (16Glorian M. Duplus E. Beale E.G. Scott D.K. Granner D.K. Forest C. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 933-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) results in the predicted increase of the enzyme itself. Furthermore, we confirmed the functional involvement of PEPCK-C for fatty acid re-esterification by measuring the incorporation of [14C1]pyruvate into lipids in the presence of a specific inhibitor of PEPCK-C, 3-mercaptopicolinic acid (21McDonald M.J. Grewe B.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 663: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The addition of 150 μm 3-mercaptopicolinic acid in experiments carried out as described in Fig. 2A reduced the amount of labeled lipids in OAT (9.1 ± 1.3 versus 18.5 ± 2.6 dpm/mg in control rats and 13.8 ± 1.7 versus 32.2 ± 6.0 dpm/mg in rosiglitazone-treated rats) and in SCAT (5.0 ± 0.8 versus 10.0 ± 2.4 dpm/mg in control rats and 8.1 ± 0.6 versus 12.5 ± 0.8 dpm/mg in rosiglitazone-treated rats). Rosiglitazone Specifically Decreases Fatty Acid Release in the Presence of a Lipolytic Stimulus—It was originally demonstrated that glyceroneogenesis was stimulated by fasting, a physiological condition during which cAMP production and lipolysis are induced in adipose tissue (14Reshef L. Hanson R.W. Ballard F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1994-2001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We thus asked whether rosiglitazone affected this pathway in the presence of a lipolytic stimulus. We used the β-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, to induce cAMP in adipose tissues from rats that had been treated with rosiglitazone or vehicle, and we analyzed glycerol and fatty acid release. Results obtained with tissues cultured in the presence or absence of pyruvate are shown in Fig. 3 (compare A–C with D–F). As expected, isoproterenol stimulated glycerol and fatty acid release in all three adipose tissue depots whether cultured with pyruvate or not, although the magnitude of response was much higher in PRAT and OAT than in SCAT (Fig. 3, A, B, D, and E). Moreover, pyruvate did not modify glycerol release but strongly reduced fatty acid output with all treatment conditions. This is in agreement with a model whereby stimulation of fatty acid reesterification does not involve glycerol phosphorylation but requires glyceroneogenesis from pyruvate (Fig. 3, compare A and B with D and E). More importantly, rosiglitazone had either a weak effect or no effect on isoproterenol induction of glycerol release (Fig. 3, A and D), although it significantly reduced isoproterenol induction of fatty acid output in all three fat depots (Fig. 3, B and E). Hence, rosiglitazone action occurs whether or not cells are in a basal or lipolytic situation. Pioglitazone and Rosiglitazone Activate PEPCK-C and Glyceroneogenesis and Decrease Fatty Acid Release from 3T3-F442A Adipocytes—We tested glyceroneogenesis-dependent fatty acid release in 3T3-F442A adipocytes because these cells have been established as a good model for adipose tissue metabolism. We analyzed the responses to rosiglitazone and a second thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone. We also used 3-mercaptopicolinic acid as the specific inhibitor of PEPCK-C (21McDonald M.J. Grewe B.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 663: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) to determine the involvement of this enzyme in thiazolidinedione induction of glyceroneogenesis. Lipolysis was induced by isoproterenol for 30 min as described above, and then fatty acid release, glycerol release, and [14C1]pyruvate incorporation into lipids were measured in 3T3-F442A adipocytes that had been pretreated with 1 μm rosiglitazone or 5 μm pioglitazone for 3 days. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone had similar effects (Fig. 4). Both glitazones significantly decreased fatty acid release (Fig. 4B) without affecting glycerol release (Fig. 4A). Moreover, both drugs increased glyceroneogenesis (Fig. 4D) and PEPCK specific activity 1.7-fold (Fig. 4C). In control cells, 3-mercaptopicolinate significantly enhanced fatty acid release (Fig. 4B) while inhibiting glyceroneogenesis as determined by the incorporation of [14C1]pyruvate into lipids (Fig. 4D). 3-Mercaptopicolinate not only abrogated the rosiglitazone and pioglitazone effects (Fig. 4D) but also increased fatty acid release, regardless of whether cells were thiazolidinedione-treated or not (Fig. 4B), without affecting glycerol release (Fig. 4A). These results indicate that PEPCK-C is involved in basal glyceroneogenesis and that an increase in its enzymatic activity is required for thiazolidinediones to stimulate glyceroneogenesis leading to an inhibition of fatty acid release. Relative Contributions of PEPCK-C and GyK to Fatty Acid Re-esterification in Control and Rosiglitazone-treated Adipocytes—The results presented above suggest that thiazolidinediones increase fatty acid re-esterification by stimulating glyceroneogenesis. However, the thiazolidinedione induction of GyK, which was recently reported (17Guan H.P. Li Y. Jensen M.V. Newgard C.B. Steppan C.M. Lazar M.A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), suggested an alternative pathway that could provide glycerol-3-phosphate for fatty acid re-esterification. It was thus important to directly compare these two pathways in order to determine their relative contributions. The results shown in Fig. 5A confirm that rosiglitazone induces GyK ∼2.5-fold after a 72-h treatment in adipocytes. As an assessment of the relative contributions of the GyK and PEPCK-C pathways, the extent of lipid labeling was measured by adding either [3H]glycerol or [14C1]pyruvate to the culture media of 3T3-F442A adipocytes (Fig. 5, B and C). We reasoned that if rosiglitazone stimulated glyceroneogenesis and glycerol phosphorylation in proportion to the relative inductions of PEPCK-C and GyK, respectively, proportionate increases in triglyceride labeling should occur whether substrates are in limiting amounts or not. We thus used two different concentrations of glycerol (0.1 and 1 mm) and pyruvate (0.2 and 5 mm), the lowest of which was physiological, and the highest of which was saturating. We also reasoned that fatty acids originating from basal lipolysis could be rate-limiting at high glycerol-3-phosphate concentrations. We thus provided oleate (80 μm bound to 40 μm bovine serum albumin) when high substrate concentrations were used. Fig. 5, B and C, shows that rosiglitazone caused ∼1.4–2-fold increases in lipid labeling with both substrates. These increases were in agreement with the increases in the enzymatic activities described above (Figs. 4C and 5A). However, a maximum of 5.4 nmol of [3H]glycerol was incorporated into lipids per hour per mg of protein, whereas ∼3-fold more [14C1]pyruvate was incorporated after rosiglitazone treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that rosiglitazone stimulates fatty acid re-esterification by inducing two pathways: direct glycerol phosphorylation by GyK, and glyceroneogenesis via PEPCK-C. However, glyceroneogenesis accounts for at least 75% of the whole thiazolidinedione effect. The present results support the hypothesis that glyceroneogenesis (via its key enzyme, PEPCK-C) is a major target of the anti-diabetic drug thiazolidinediones by decreasing fatty acid release from adipocytes to control the systemic supply of fatty acids. We also conclude that thiazolidinediones exert a minimal effect on adipocyte lipolytic rate because (i) basal glycerol release is, at best, weakly affected by the drug and (ii) rosiglitazone has no effect on the induction of glycerol release by the β-agonist isoproterenol. In contrast, thiazolidinediones significantly restrained isoproterenol stimulation of fatty acid release because they increase their re-esterification at the same time they are produced from triacylglycerol breakdown. This futile cycle of fatty acid re-esterification during lipolysis is permitted because glycerol-3 phosphate is synthesized from non-carbohydrate sources, such as pyruvate, via glyceroneogenesis and PEPCK-C that are induced by thiazolidinediones. The importance of glyceroneogenesis via adipocyte PEPCK in the regulation of lipid metabolism has very recently been documented in two transgenic mouse models (12Beale E.G. Hammer R.E. Antoine B. Forest C. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1695-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). First, overexpression of PEPCK-C in adipose tissue resulted in obesity caused by activation of glyceroneogenesis and fatty acid reesterification (22Frankhauser S. Munoz S. Pujol A. Casellas A. Riu E. Otaegui P. Su B. Bosch F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 624-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Unlike other animal models of obesity, these obese transgenic mice never develop insulin resistance, perhaps because their circulating fatty acid levels remain lower than those in non-obese control mice. Second, mice with a tissue-specific ablation of PEPCK-C gene expression in their adipose tissues showed phenotypes consistent with the loss of glyceroneogenesis (23Olswang Y. Cohen H. Papo O. Cassuto H. Croniger C.M. Hakimi P. Tilghman S.M. Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These adipose specific null mice were mildly lipodystrophic and appeared to be slightly insulin resistant, although not diabetic. Their fat tissue mass was reduced, whereas the release of fatty acids was increased and was not affected by pyruvate. Beyond our own data, such models emphasize the important physiological role of glyceroneogenesis in adipose tissue for controlling circulating fatty acid levels and perhaps preventing diabetes. Because elevated serum fatty acids can promote insulin resistance (4Boden G. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), taken together, these results suggest that glyceroneogenesis activation in adipose tissue, via its key enzyme (PEPCK-C), could help to abrogate diabetes by decreasing the systemic fatty acid supply. Guan et al. (17Guan H.P. Li Y. Jensen M.V. Newgard C.B. Steppan C.M. Lazar M.A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) recently reported that thiazolidinediones induce GyK in adipocytes. They proposed this as the mechanism that activates the futile cycle in allowing fatty acid reesterification. They were apparently unaware of glyceroneogenesis and its contribution to the futile cycle. Guan et al. (17Guan H.P. Li Y. Jensen M.V. Newgard C.B. Steppan C.M. Lazar M.A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) showed that overexpression of GyK was less than half as efficient as rosiglitazone treatment in decreasing fatty acid release in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Such a result is in accordance with our data linking glyceroneogenesis to the effect of thiazolidinediones on fatty acid release. Furthermore, glyceroneogenesis appears to be an important and immediate physiological pathway for regulation of fatty acid release, whereas GyK intervenes only as a response to thiazolidinediones because it has been detected in adipose tissue only at low levels in the absence of drug treatment. We recognize that glyceroneogenesis from pyruvate and direct phosphorylation of glycerol are not mutually exclusive pathways. Indeed, the present study suggests that their respective contributions to glycerol-3-phosphate synthesis for fatty acid re-esterification are in a ratio of 3:1 or more. According to this revised model, thiazolidinediones would increase insulin sensitivity in tissues such as liver and skeletal muscle by decreasing the release of fatty acids from adipose tissue via the induction of glyceroneogenesis and GyK. In adipose tissue, the resulting increase of fatty acid re-esterification would be facilitated by the concomitant increase of proteins that allow their uptake and acyl-CoA activation, as expected from the reported increase in the corresponding mRNAs by PPARγ agonists (10Way J.M. Harrington W.W. Brown K.K. Gottschalk W.K. Sundseth S.S. Mansfield T.A. Ramachandran R.K. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28210-28217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was observed that a 6-month rosiglitazone monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes enhances the body weight, although moderately (25Lebovitz H.E. Dole J.F. Patwardhan R. Rappaport E.B. Freed M.I. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). A number of lines of investigation have implicated PEPCK-C as one etiological factor in type 2 diabetes (12Beale E.G. Hammer R.E. Antoine B. Forest C. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1695-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The present study reinforces that notion by implicating PEPCK-C in an anti-diabetic action of thiazolidinediones. This is perhaps the reason why “fatless” mice (A-ZiP/F-1 mice, a lipodistrophic model) that develop type 2 diabetes are not responsive to thiazolidinedione treatment (26Chao L. Marcus-Samuels B. Mason M.M. Moitra J. Vinson C. Arioglu E. Gavrilova O. Reitman M.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In addition, PEPCK-C is known to lose its adaptive response to fasting with age in rats, whereas its expression is tightly regulated by insulin and counter-regulatory hormones in young animals (14Reshef L. Hanson R.W. Ballard F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1994-2001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This could contribute to increased circulating fatty acid levels if such an age-related change occurs in humans. Finally, we found the regulation of glyceroneogenesis to occur mainly in visceral fat, the same fat depot that is specifically implicated in the progression of obesity to type 2 diabetes (27Boyko E.J. Fujimoto W.Y. Leonetti D.L. Newell-Morris L. Diabetes Care. 2000; 23: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). This is important because the risk of insulin resistance can be predicted according to body fat distribution rather than generalized obesity in humans (27Boyko E.J. Fujimoto W.Y. Leonetti D.L. Newell-Morris L. Diabetes Care. 2000; 23: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In summary, the major finding of this study is that stimulation of PEPCK-C by thiazolidinediones decreases fatty acid release from adipose tissues by increasing glyceroneogenesis. The recently developed adipose tissue PEPCK-C knockout model (23Olswang Y. Cohen H. Papo O. Cassuto H. Croniger C.M. Hakimi P. Tilghman S.M. Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) should prove invaluable in testing the hypothesis that PEPCK-C is an important target for the anti-diabetic actions of thiazolidinediones. These mice will also be useful in testing whether PEPCK-C is involved in the etiology of type 2 diabetes.

https://openalex.org/W1997688114,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) binds to its receptor PTH1R (parathyroid hormone 1 receptor) in osteoblastic cells to regulate bone remodeling and calcium homeostasis. While prolonged exposure to PTH causes increased bone resorption, intermittent injections of PTH have an anabolic effect on bone. The molecular mechanisms regulating these processes are still largely unknown. Here, we present our results on gene expression profile changes in the PTH-treated osteoblastic cell line, UMR 106-01, using DNA microarray analysis. A total of 125 known genes and 30 unknown expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were found to have at least 2-fold expression changes after PTH treatment at 4, 12, and 24 h. 14 genes were previously known to be PTH-regulated but many were unknown to be regulated by PTH prior to our experiments. Real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR confirmed that 90 and 50% of the genes are regulated more than 2-fold by PTH in UMR 106-01 and rat primary osteoblastic cells, respectively. Most genes belong to the following protein families: hormones, growth factors, and receptors; signal transduction pathway proteins; transcription factors; proteases; metabolic enzymes; structural and matrix proteins; transporters; etc. These results provide a comprehensive and deeper knowledge about PTH regulation of osteoblastic gene expression. Next, we designed a computational method to extract information about transcription factors likely involved in regulating these genes. These factors include those previously known to be involved in PTH signaling (AP-1 and the cAMP response element-binding protein), those that were identified by microarray data (C/EBP), and some novel transcription factors (AP-2, AP-4, SP1, FoxD3, etc.). Our results suggest that a reliable bioinformatics approach can be easily applied for other systems."

Here, we report the solution structure and ubiquitin binding properties of one such motif, the Npl4 zinc finger or RanBP2/Nup358 zinc finger (NZF) domain. Npl4 NZF forms a compact module composed of four antiparallel β-strands linked by three ordered loops. A single zinc ion is coordinated by four conserved cysteines from the first and third loops, which form two rubredoxin knuckles.

Our studies reveal the structure of this versatile class of protein binding domains and provide a means for identifying the subset of NZF domains likely to bind ubiquitin. Protein ubiquitylation plays an important role in a large number of biological processes, including intracellular proteolysis, DNA repair, transcription, translation, signal transduction, cell cycle progression, organelle assembly, protein trafficking, and virus budding (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6906) Google Scholar, 2Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2922) Google Scholar, 3Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). Cells therefore dedicate an extensive array of machinery to the enzymology of ubiquitin transfer. Upon ubiquitylation, proteins must be directed to the correct intracellular locale, and pathways that utilize ubiquitin as a targeting signal therefore have effector proteins that specifically recognize ubiquitylated proteins. A number of such ubiquitin binding proteins are now known, and their study has led to the identification and characterization of several conserved ubiquitin binding motifs, including the ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM), 1The abbreviations used are: UIM, ubiquitin-interacting motif; Ub, ubiquitin; NZF, Npl4 zinc finger; BME, β-mercaptoethanol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EXAFS, extended x-ray absorption fine structure; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single-quantum coherence; E2, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. the ubiquitin-associated domain, and the ubiquitin E2 variant/UBC-like domain (2Pickart C.M.

Sci. 1996; 21: 172-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Each of these motifs forms an independent folding domain that can bind ubiquitin in vitro, although the molecular details of ubiquitin recognition are not yet understood in any case. Given the generality of ubiquitin (Ub) as a targeting signal, it is likely that additional ubiquitin recognition motifs remain to be identified and characterized. One example is the recently discovered Npl4 zinc finger/RanBP2 zinc finger domain (NZF) (see Fig. 1A), which was first identified in Npl4, a protein that binds ubiquitin in vitro and mediates several different ubiquitin-dependent functions of the AAA-ATPase p97/Cdc48p. A hallmark of NZF domains is the presence of four regularly spaced cysteine residues, which suggests that the motif may be a metal binding module (8Delaney S.J. Hayward D.C. Barleben F.

Snyder W. Wendland B. Emr S. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 283-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). NZF motifs appear to be quite prevalent, and our protein data base searches revealed 243 unique peptide sequences with four cysteines and an asparagine with the same spacing as those of Npl4 NZF (Fig. 1A). This ensemble of sequences also exhibited significant conservation at 12 of 24 of the remaining residues, which presumably reflects the conserved structure and function(s) of this common domain. In addition to Npl4 itself, several other NZF-containing proteins are known to be involved in ubiquitin-dependent processes. One example is Vps36p, a protein required for vacuolar protein sorting of ubiquitylated proteins in yeast (11Babst M. Katzmann D. Snyder W. Wendland B. Emr S. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 283-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Isolated NZF domains from both Npl4 and Vps36p bind mono- and poly-Ub chains in vitro, consistent with the idea that these NZF domains serve to recognize ubiquitylated protein substrates in vivo (10Meyer H.H. Wang Y. Warren G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5645-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). However, not all NZF-like domains bind ubiquitin, suggesting that those that do may represent a specialized subset of a much larger domain superfamily that shares a common three-dimensional fold (10Meyer H.H. Wang Y. Warren G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5645-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The prevalence of the NZF domain and its apparent role in ubiquitin recognition in several important biological pathways led us to study the molecular basis for NZF/Ub interactions. Toward this end, we have analyzed the sequence conservation across putative NZF domains, characterized the metal and ubiquitin binding properties of the Npl4 and Vps36p NZF domains, determined the solution structure of the NZF domain from Npl4, mapped the interaction surfaces in the Npl4 NZF/Ub complex, and tested the importance of a conserved, dipeptide motif (TF) at NZF positions 13 and 14 for ubiquitin binding. The SwissProt, PIR, PRF, and KEGG GENE data bases were searched with the pattern X6CX2CX3NX6CX2CX5, which yielded 243 unique matches in 166 different proteins (duplicates were removed manually). The apparent correlation between Asn-16 and Trp-7 (72%; see Fig. 1A) was tested by a search with the pattern X4WXCX2CX10CX2CX (5Madura K. Cell Cycle. 2002; 1: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which produced 161 matches (in 114 proteins), 84% of which had asparagine at the variable position corresponding to Asn-16 in Npl4 NZF. Searches with the more stringent RanBP2-like pattern (12Falquet L. Pagni M. Bucher P. Hulo N. Sigrist C.J. Hofmann K. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar) (and see, on the World Wide Web, www.expasy.ch/cgi-bin/nicedoc.pl?PDOC50199) X4WXCX2CX3NX6CX2CX5, with both the Trp and Asn positions fixed, revealed greater conservation at the variable positions but was judged overly stringent, since it excluded the known NZF domain of Vps36p (10Meyer H.H. Wang Y. Warren G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5645-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Searches of the PDBSTR data base yielded no matches, indicating that the motif has not previously been characterized structurally. DNA encoding NZF domains from rat Npl4 (amino acids 580–608) and yeast Vps36p (amino acids 177–205) were cloned into pGEX-4T expression vectors. These constructs encoded GST-NZF fusion proteins with thrombin cleavage sites between the GST and NZF domains (13Haj F.G. Verveer P.J. Squire A. Neel B.G. Bastiaens P.I. Science. 2002; 295: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into the Npl4 expression construct by QuikChange™ mutagenesis (Stratagene). Protein expression in DH5α Escherichia coli carrying the expression plasmids was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (A600 = 0.4). After 4 h at 23 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at -70 °C prior to protein purification. All steps in Npl4 NZF protein purification were performed at 4 °C, except where noted. Pellets from 6 liters of cells were resuspended in 40 ml of buffer A (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (BME), 10 μm ZnCl2), sonicated to lyse the cells, and centrifuged for 1 h at 39,000 × g to clear insoluble debris. The soluble GST-Npl4 NZF fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography on an FF 16/10 glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The bound protein was loaded and washed with ∼10 column volumes of buffer A and then eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm BME, 10 μm ZnCl2. Purified fractions (∼24 ml) were pooled and dialyzed for 16 h against 2 liters of thrombin cleavage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm BME, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 10 μm ZnCl2), quantified by optical absorption (ϵ280 = 47,330 m-1 cm-1), incubated at 23 °C for 16 h with 1 unit of thrombin protease (Novagen)/mg of GST-Npl4 NZF, and then concentrated to ∼3 ml by ultrafiltration (Amicon 3). Cleaved Npl4 NZF was separated from GST and uncleaved fusion protein by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex-75, APBiotech) in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 5 mm BME, 10 μm ZnCl2. This procedure typically yielded ∼4 mg of pure Npl4 NZF. 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled NZF peptides were expressed and purified as described above except that E. coli was grown in M9 minimal medium with 15NH4Cl or 15NH4Cl/13C6-glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon source, respectively. Prior to atomic absorption and extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopic analyses, unbound zinc was removed by gel filtration of pure Npl4 NZF (Superdex-75) in a degassed buffer lacking zinc (20 mm sodium phosphate pH 5.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm BME). Thrombin cleavage left two nonnative residues at the N terminus of Npl4 NZF (NH2-Gly-Ser2). These residues are included in our numbering scheme but are not shown in any of the figures. Purified Npl4 NZF was characterized by SDS-PAGE, N-terminal sequencing (NH2-Gly-Ser-Thr-Ser-Ala), and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (calculated mass = 3374.7 Da; observed mass = 3374.7 Da). The stoichiometry of bound zinc was analyzed by determining the protein concentration using optical spectroscopy (ϵ280 = 5840 m-1 cm-1), and the zinc concentration was analyzed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Unlabeled and 15N-labeled ubiquitin were expressed and purified as described (14Beal R. Deveraux Q. Xia G. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Pure Npl4 NZF was dialyzed against 2 liters of XAS buffer (either 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm BME or 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm BME), concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon 3), adjusted to a final concentration of 30% (w/v) glycerol, and snap-frozen in a Lucite cell covered in Kapton tape at a final protein concentration of 1 mm. Data were collected at beamline 7-3 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory using an Si(220) double crystal monochromator detuned 50% for harmonic rejection. Fluorescence excitation spectra were recorded using a 30-element germanium solid-state array detector. Samples were maintained at 10 K using a continuous flow liquid helium cryostat (Oxford). XAS spectra were measured at 5-eV steps in the pre-edge, 0.35-eV steps in the edge (9640–9690 eV), and 0.05-Å-1 increments in the EXAFS region, integrating from 1–30 s in a k3 weighted manner over 45 min. EXAFS data represent the average of nine scans. X-ray energies were calibrated with simultaneous measurement of a zinc foil absorption spectrum, assigning the first inflection point to 9659 eV. Similar spectra were obtained at both pH 5.5 and 8.0. XAS data were analyzed using the Macintosh OS X version of the EXAFSPAK program, which integrates Feff version 7.0 to generate theoretical models (see, on the World Wide Web, www-ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/exafspak.html). Data reduction employed second-order polynomial base-line flattening in the pre-edge and three-region cubic spline flattening throughout the EXAFS region. Data were converted to k-space using E0 = 9680 eV. Meaningful EXAFS data were limited to 10,325 eV due to monochrometer imperfections. EXAFS data of crystallographically characterized model complexes were fit using amplitude and phase functions calculated in Feff version 7.0 for a zinc-sulfur interaction. This resulted in a scale factor of 1 and an E0 of -15.25, which were used for data fitting of the NZF protein. Coordination numbers were fixed at half-integer values, whereas R and σ2 were allowed to float during the final fits. Sample Preparation—Samples for structure determinations were ∼1.0 mm Npl4 NZF in NMR buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm BME, 10 μm ZnCl2, in 90% H2O, 10% D2O). Samples were degassed and flame-sealed under argon in NMR sample tubes to reduce cysteine oxidation. Data Collection and Assignments—NMR spectra were recorded at 18 °C on a Varian Inova 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance 1H/13C/15N probe and z axis pulsed field gradients. Backbone and side chain assignments were made using a standard suite of triple resonance experiments (15Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M.

Side chain assignments were completed using H(CCO)NH-TOCSY, (H)C(CCO)NH-TOCSY, 15N-edited TOCSY, and 13C-edited NOESY experiments, with aromatic resonances assigned using a combination of 1H/13C HSQC and 13C-edited NOESY experiments centered on the aromatic carbon resonances (125 ppm). Stereospecific assignments for 28 of 36 β-methylene protons were obtained using a combination of HNHB, HN(CO)HB (17Bax A. Vuister G.W. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Wang A.C. Tschudin R. Zhu G.

Hydrogen-bonded amides were identified using a long range HNCO experiment with the N-CO coupling period tuned to 133.3 ms (∼1/4 1JNCO for the one bond coupling (23Meissner A. Sorensen O.W. J. Magn.

Surface-exposed amides for the free and ubiquitin-bound forms of NZF were characterized in SEAhsqc spectra (27Pellecchia M. Meininger D. Shen A.L. Jack R. Kasper C.B. Sem D.S. J. Am. Chem.

Initial rounds of refinement used only NOE data, which defined the general fold of the domain and revealed the stereo-chemistry about the coordinated zinc. Final refinements added EXAFS-derived restraints for zinc–Sγ (2.33–2.37 Å), (zinc–Cβ 3.25–3.61 Å), and Sγ–Sγ distances (3.78–4.15 Å) to ensure approximate tetrahedral zinc coordination as well as hydrogen-bonding restraints and 3JHNHA coupling constants. NOE assignments and structure calculations were independently validated using the automated assignment/structure calculation package (CANDID within CYANA) (31Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J.

Amide chemical shift assignments for human ubiquitin were obtained from the VLI Research, Inc. Web site at www.vli-research.com/ubshifts.htm. Ubiquitin binding affinities for wild type and mutant GST-Npl4 NZF proteins and wild type GST-Vps36p NZF captured on anti-GST anti-body biosensor surfaces were quantified as described previously (36Garrus J.E. von Schwedler U.K. Pornillos O.W. Morham S.G. Zavitz K.H. Wang H.E. Wettstein D.A. Stray K.M. Cote M. Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Sundquist W.I. Cell. 2001; 107: 55-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). All measurements were performed at 20 °C in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 5 mm BME, 2 μm ZnCl2. The NZF Is a Zinc Binding Module—The Npl4 and Vps36p NZF constructs used in our studies span the conserved NZF regions and the sequence and numbering scheme for the rat Npl4 NZF polypeptide (Npl4 NZF) are given in Fig. 1A. Npl4 NZF was expressed in E. coli, and the soluble protein was purified to homogeneity under nondenaturing conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”). The presence of a single, covalently bound zinc ion was demonstrated using atomic absorption spectroscopy (0.93 mol of zinc/mol of Npl4 NZF) and EXAFS spectroscopy (Fig. 1, B and C). The best fit model to the transformed EXAFS spectrum revealed that the zinc coordination sphere contained four sulfur ligands (n = 4.56) and an average Zn–S bond length of 2.33 Å. The Debye-Waller factor (0.00454 Å) was consistent with a slightly distorted tetrahedral geometry about the zinc center. We therefore conclude that Npl4 NZF coordinates a single, tetrahedral Zn2+ ion using the four conserved cysteines. NMR Studies of Npl4 NZF—Nearly complete resonance and stereospecific assignments for Npl4 NZF were obtained using standard 1H/13C/15N heteronuclear NMR experiments (see Fig. 2 and “Experimental Procedures”). As expected for a Zn(Cys)4 metal center, the four cysteine Cβ resonances exhibited chemical shifts (31.5–32.5 ppm) that were intermediate between free cysteine (28.3 ppm) and oxidized cysteine (41.2 ppm). The structure of Npl4 NZF was initially calculated using 362 NOE restraints, which were sufficient to define both the protein structure and the zinc coordination geometry. Subsequent refinements included restraints for observed hydrogen bonds (eight restraints), JHNHA scalar-coupling (13 restraints), and tetrahedral zinc coordination (4 experimental, 10 idealized restraints). The final ensemble of 20 low energy structures was of high quality (Fig. 3 and Table I), with root mean square deviations from the mean structure of 0.11 ± 0.05 (backbone) and 0.72 ± 0.15 Å (all heavy atoms). Structure of Npl4 NZF—Npl4 NZF contains four short β-strands (S1–S4) that form two orthogonal hairpins (S1/S2 and S3/S4). The S1/S2 hairpin exhibits a canonical β-hairpin hydrogen bonding pattern, and the three expected hydrogen bonds were observed directly in HNCO-LR spectra (23Meissner A. Sorensen O.W. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 143: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast, the S3/S4 “hairpin” consists of two twisted, antiparallel strands that lack canonical cross-strand hydrogen bonding. The four strands are connected by a compact central loop (L2) that contains overlapping type-1 (Gln-17–Thr-20) and reverse-γ (Gly-19–Gly-21) turns and two short metal binding loops (L1 and L3) that form “rubredoxin knuckles” (Figs. 3 and 4) (37Adman E.

The rubredoxin knuckle was initially recognized in the iron-binding centers of rubredoxins and has subsequently been observed at the zinc coordination sites in a number of proteins (39Blake P.R. Summers M.F. Adv. Biophys. Chem. 1994; 4: 1-30Google Scholar, 40Hammarstrom A. Berndt K.D. Sillard R. Adermann K. Otting G.

Rubredoxin knuckles are six-residue loops that connect two β-strands and display two metal binding Cys ligands (from loop positions 1 and 4). The canonical knuckle configuration orients the backbone amide nitrogens at positions 3 and 4 to hydrogen-bond with the first cysteine Sγ atom and orients the backbone amide at position 6 to hydrogen-bond with the second cysteine Sγ. This unusually tight metal binding loop is favored by a glycine residue at position 5, which adopts a positive backbone ϕ torsion angle. Variations in the details of this hydrogen bonding scheme are seen in proteins within the rubredoxin family, for example in rubrerythrin (Protein Data Bank entry 1DVB) (43Sieker L.C. Holmes M.

https://openalex.org/W1967756628,"mRNAs are capped at their 5′-end by a unique cap structure containing N7-methyl guanine. Recognition of the cap structure is of paramount importance in some of the most central processes of gene expression as well as in some viral processes, such as priming of influenza virus transcription. The recent resolution of the structure of three evolutionary unrelated cap binding proteins, the vaccinia viral protein VP39, the eukaryotic translation factor eIF4E, and the nuclear cap-binding protein CBP20 showed that the recognition of the cap structure is achieved by the same general mechanism, i.e. by “sandwiching” of the N7-methyl guanine of the cap structure between two aromatic amino acid residues. The purpose of the present study was to test whether a similar cap recognition mechanism had independently evolved for the RNA polymerase of influenza virus. Combining in vivo and in vitro methods, we characterized two crucial aromatic amino acids, Phe363 and Phe404, in the PB2 subunit of the viral RNA polymerase that are essential for cap binding. The aromaticity of these two residues is conserved in influenza A, B, and C and even in the divergent Thogoto virus PB2 subunits. Thus, our results favor a similar mechanism of cap binding by the influenza RNA polymerase as in the evolutionary unrelated VP39, eIF4E, and CBP20. mRNAs are capped at their 5′-end by a unique cap structure containing N7-methyl guanine.

Eukaryotic RNA polymerase II transcripts (mRNAs and small nuclear RNAs) are modified at their 5′ extremity by the addition of an N7-methyl guanine cap (m7G) 1The abbreviations used are: m7G, N7-methyl guanine cap; vRNA, viral RNA; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; nt, nucleotide(s); MDBK, Madin-Darby bovine kidney. in a 5′-5′ triphosphate linkage. The function of such structures is to protect mRNAs from degradation by 5′-exonucleases (1Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cap structures are recognized by specific proteins that are able to distinguish N7-methyl from nonmethylated guanines (2Quiocho F.A. Hu G. Gershon P.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This is of paramount importance in some of the most central processes for the regulation of gene expression in all eukaryotic organisms including pre-mRNA splicing (3Konarska M.M. Padgett R.A. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1984; 38: 731-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), nucleocytoplasmic transport (4Hamm J. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1990; 63: 109-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), mRNA 3′-end formation (5Flaherty S.M. Fortes P. Izaurralde E. Mattaj I.W. Gilmartin G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Cap binding is also crucial for some viral functions. Thus, ribose 2′-O-methylation of vaccinia viral mRNAs depends on cap recognition (7Barbosa E. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7698-7702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A remarkable example of host dependence is the requirement of a host cap structure for influenza virus transcription (8Bouloy M. Plotch S.J. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3952-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Considerable insight into the mechanism of cap recognition has arisen from a broad set of biochemical and crystallographic studies of three proteins of evolutionary unrelated origin: eIF4E (a eukaryotic cellular factor involved in the initiation of translation), VP39 (a vaccinia virus protein involved in 2′-O-methylation of viral mRNAs), and CBP20 (a eukaryotic nuclear factor involved in mRNA transport in the nucleus) (9Matsuo H.

Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In all three cases, the recognition of the cap structure is achieved by the same general mechanism, i.e. by “sandwiching” the N7-methyl guanine between two aromatic amino acid residues (phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan). This suggests that only one mechanism has evolved to specifically recognize N7-methyl guanine in cap structures. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that a similar cap recognition mechanism had independently evolved for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of influenza virus. Influenza virus RNA polymerase cap recognition is performed by the PB2 subunit of the RNA polymerase (14Ulmanen I. Broni B.A. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7355-7359Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 15Blaas D. Patzelt E. Kuechler E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 4803-4812Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), yet has specific features distinguishing it from cap recognition by eIF4E, VP39, or CBP20. First, influenza RNA polymerase cap recognition depends on the addition of the viral RNA (vRNA) promoter (16Cianci C. Tiley L. Krystal M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3995-3999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Li M.L. Ramirez B.C. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5844-5852Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Without vRNA, no cap recognition occurs. This suggests that a conformational change is required prior to cap binding. Second, the affinity of the binding of the influenza polymerase for cap structures is significantly weaker (at least 100-fold) than that of eIF4E (18Hooker L. Sully R. Ono N. Handa B. Klumpp K. XIIth congress of Virology, Paris, France, July 27–August 1, 2002. International Union of Microbiological Societies, Paris, France2002Google Scholar, 19Niedzwiecka A. Marcotrigiano J. Stepinski J.

Biol. 2002; 319: 615-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), which is similar to that of CBC (the cap binding complex involving CBP20 and CBP80) (20Wilson K.F. Fortes P. Singh U.S. Ohno M. Mattaj I.W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4166-4173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains possible that alternative cap recognition strategies might have evolved for this unique example of cap recognition by the influenza RNA polymerase. Whether a related “sandwich” recognition or an unrelated mechanism has evolved in the case of the influenza viral RNA polymerase, the cap recognition machinery is of great interest, since if molecular details were known, this would provide a good target for novel specific antivirals to potentially control influenza in the future. Influenza A virus is a negative strand RNA virus containing eight segments of single-stranded RNA as its genome. The RNA genome is transcribed and replicated in the cell nucleus by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (for reviews, see Refs. 21Portela A. Zurcher T. Nieto A. Ortín J. Adv.

The viral polymerase is a heterotrimer composed of the three subunits PB1, PB2, and PA. The PB1 subunit plays a central role in both RNA polymerase assembly and RNA polymerization (24Digard P. Blok V.C. Inglis S.C. Virology. 1989; 171: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Poch O. Sauvaget I. Delarue M. Tordo N.

The function of the PA subunit remains largely unknown, but mutations in PA have been shown to affect replication (27Mahy B.W. Barrett T. Nichols J.E. Penn C.R. Wolstenholme A.J. Bishop D.H.L. Compans R.W. The Replication of Negative Stranded Viruses. Elsevier Science, New York1981: 379-387Google Scholar) and more recently endonuclease activities (28Fodor E. Crow M. Mingay L.J. Deng T. Sharps J. Fechter P. Brownlee G.G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8989-9001Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and elongation (47Fodor E. Mingay L.J. Crow M. Deng T. Brownlee G.G. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5017-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The PB2 subunit plays a crucial role in mRNA transcription. PB2 is responsible for recognition and binding of the cap structure of host mRNAs (14Ulmanen I. Broni B.A. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7355-7359Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 15Blaas D. Patzelt E. Kuechler E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 4803-4812Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), which, following endonuclease cleavage 9–17 nucleotides downstream of the cap (29Plotch S.J. Bouloy M. Ulmanen I. Krug R.M. Cell. 1981; 23: 847-858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), serve as primers for mRNA synthesis (30Plotch S.J. Bouloy M. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1618-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 31Bouloy M. Morgan M.A. Shatkin A.J. Krug R.M. J. Virol. 1979; 32: 895-904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous attempts to localize regions of PB2 responsible for cap binding have produced contradictory results. Cap binding was localized to amino acids 533–564 in one cross-linking study (26Li M.L. Rao P. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2078-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), but an earlier study also proposed that, in addition, the region 242–252 of PB2 was involved (32Honda A. Mizumoto K. Ishihama A. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, PB2 shows no significant sequence similarity with the previously crystallized cap-binding proteins (eIF4E, VP39, and CBP20); therefore, amino acid homology searches give no clue as to the regions of PB2 involved in cap recognition. To identify residues of PB2 involved in cap binding, we based our work on the hypothesis that PB2 has evolved a similar cap binding mechanism to eIF4E, VP39, and CBP20. Our approach consisted of a large scale mutagenesis of all aromatic amino acid residues of PB2, that were evolutionary conserved between influenza type A, B, and C and Thogoto virus. This approach was made possible because of an easy method of preparing partially purified recombinant influenza RNA polymerase from human 293T cells (28Fodor E. Crow M. Mingay L.J. Deng T. Sharps J. Fechter P. Brownlee G.G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8989-9001Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 33Brownlee G.G. Sharps J.L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7103-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We showed that the mutation of just 2 (Phe363 and Phe404) of the 27 evolutionary conserved aromatic residues drastically and specifically inhibit the cap binding activity of PB2. These two residues are present at different positions of PB2 from the positions previously implicated in cap binding using the cross-linking approach (26Li M.L. Rao P. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2078-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 32Honda A. Mizumoto K. Ishihama A. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, our data suggest that influenza RNA polymerase has evolved a similar general cap binding mechanism to eIF4E, VP39, and CBP20. Plasmids—The plasmids used in this study (pcDNA plasmids encoding the PB1, PB2, PA, PA-His6, or NP proteins; pPOLI plasmids encoding the eight influenza vRNAs; and pPOLI-CAT-RT plasmid) have been described previously (28Fodor E.

Virol. 1996; 70: 4188-4192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Modifications of the PB2 plasmids were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis. PB2 mutant genes have been fully sequenced by standard methods. Details of the mutagenesis strategy and the sequence of mutagenic primers are available on request. Preparation of Capped RNA for Binding Studies and Endonuclease Assay—A 2′-O-methylated oligoribonucleotide (5′-AmAAUACUCAAG-3′) was chemically synthesized and 5′-diphosphorylated as described (36Brownlee G.G. Fodor E. Pritlove D.C. Gould K.G. Dalluge J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2641-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For binding studies, the 5′-diphosphorylated oligoribonucleotide was enzymatically capped using [α-32P]GTP (>3000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences), as described before (28Fodor E. Crow M. Mingay L.J. Deng T. Sharps J. Fechter P. Brownlee G.G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8989-9001Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). For endonuclease assays, the 32P-labeled capped RNA oligonucleotide was polyadenylated and oligonucleotides with adenines added at their 3′-end were isolated by oligo(dT)30-cellulose chromatography (28Fodor E. Crow M. Mingay L.J. Deng T. Sharps J. Fechter P. Brownlee G.G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8989-9001Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The 5-nucleotide capped RNA [α-32P]m7GpppAmAAU was derived from [α-32P]m7GpppAmAAUACUCAAG by RNase A digestion (75 ng/10 μl). RNase A was added immediately after capping, for 30 min at 37 °C, but before purification by 18% PAGE in 7 m urea. Transfections and Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase (CAT) Assays—DNA transfections were performed in 293T cells as described previously (28Fodor E. Crow M. Mingay L.J. Deng T. Sharps J. Fechter P. Brownlee G.G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8989-9001Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection, and cell lysates were used in the CAT assays (28Fodor E. Crow M. Mingay L.J. Deng T. Sharps J. Fechter P. Brownlee G.G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8989-9001Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Quantification was performed visually by comparing activities of serially diluted samples. Isolation of Partially Purified His-tagged Recombinant Influenza RNA Polymerase (modified from Refs. 28Fodor E. Crow M. Mingay L.J. Deng T. Sharps J. Fechter P. Brownlee G.G. J.

Virol. 2002; 76: 7103-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)—Human kidney 293T cells in suspension in 15-cm dishes (about 1 × 107 cells) were transfected with 20 μg of each of pcDNA-PB1, pcDNA-PB2, and pcDNA-PA-His6 using 90 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) in 36 ml of minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. About 48 h post-transfection, cells from one or two dishes were pooled and processed as described previously (28Fodor E. Crow M. Mingay L.J. Deng T. Sharps J. Fechter P. Brownlee G.G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8989-9001Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) but with modifications to the lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm pepstatin (Sigma), 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), and one complete mini-EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science) per 10 ml). Proteins were eluted from Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) in 50 μl of elution buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 50 mm imidazole), and 40 μl of glycerol was then added before freezing to -20 °C. Western Blot Analysis of Recombinant PB2 Proteins—5 μl of cell lysates (from CAT experiments) or 5 μl of purified His-tagged polymerase preparations were analyzed on 8% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred to Hybond-C nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and probed with a polyclonal anti-PB2 antibody (24Digard P. Blok V.C. Inglis S.C. Virology. 1989; 171: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The Western blots performed on His-tagged polymerase preparations allowed us to correct results in subsequent assays for differences in the yield of polymerase antigen obtained with the different PB2 mutants. Transcription Assays in Vitro—Transcription reactions were performed, essentially as previously described (33Brownlee G.G. Sharps J.L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7103-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), in a total reaction volume of 3 μl containing 1.5 μl of polymerase preparation, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 4 units of RNasin (Promega), 1 μg of E. coli tRNA, 1 mm ATP, 0.5 mm UTP, 0.5 mm CTP, 0.1 μm GTP, 0.15 μm [α-32P]GTP (>3000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences), 4 pmol of 3′-end vRNA promoter (5′-GGCCUGCUUUUGCU-3′) (Dharmacon), 4 pmol of 5′-end vRNA promoter (5′-AGUAGAAACAAGGCC-3′) (Dharmacon), and 1 mm ApG (Sigma). In the globin mRNA-primed transcription assays, the ApG was replaced with 0.03 μg of globin mRNA (Invitrogen). In the capped RNA-primed transcription assays, the ApG was replaced with a 32P-labeled 12-nt capped RNA (about 5000 cpm of [α-32P]m7GpppAmAAUACUCAAG; see above), and 0.5 mm GTP was used instead of [α-32P]GTP. Transcription reactions were performed at 30 °C for 1 h and analyzed by 18% PAGE in 7 m urea. Endonuclease Assays—Endonuclease assays were performed essentially as described (28Fodor E. Crow M. Mingay L.J. Deng T. Sharps J. Fechter P. Brownlee G.G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8989-9001Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), in a total reaction volume of 3 μl containing 2 μl of His-tagged polymerase, 32P-capped and poly(A)-tailed RNA substrate [α-32P]m7GpppAmAAUACUCAAGAn (about 5000 cpm; see above), 2 pmol of 5′-end vRNA promoter and 3′-end vRNA promoter (as above), 1 μg of E. coli tRNA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 40 units of RNasin (Promega). Endonuclease reactions were performed at 30 °C for 30 min and analyzed by 18% PAGE in 7 m urea. Cap-binding Assay—A UV-cross-linking assay, modified from Ref. 37Fodor E. Seong B.L. Brownlee G.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, was used to test the cap-binding activity of recombinant His-tagged RNA polymerases. The cross-linking mixture (30 μl) contained 20 μl of partially purified His-tagged polymerase, 1 pmol of 5′-end vRNA promoter, 1 pmol of 3′-end vRNA promoter, 4 mm MgCl2,1mm dithiothreitol, 8 units RNasin (Promega), 10 μg of E. coli tRNA, a 2 nm concentration (about 200,000 cpm) of the 12-nt [α-32P]m7GpppAmAAUACUCAAG or 2 nm concentration (about 200,000 cpm) of the 5-nt capped RNA [α-32P]m7GpppAmAAU (see above), and, for competition, a 0.05 or 0.5 mm concentration of a cap dinucleotide analogue (m7GpppG; Stratagene). The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and then transferred into a U-bottom 96-well plate and UV-irradiated on ice for 30 min in a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene) equipped with G8T5 bulbs (254 nm). The cross-linked products were analyzed on an 8% SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. To determine which polymerase subunits were cross-linked to the capped RNA, cross-linked complexes were disrupted by 0.1% SDS treatment, and immunoprecipitations were performed with polyclonal anti-PB1, anti-PB2, and anti-PA antibodies, as described previously (37Fodor E. Seong B.L. Brownlee G.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Analysis of vRNA, mRNA, and cRNA by Primer Extension Assay and Viral Rescue—Human kidney 293T cells in 35-mm dishes were transfected as for the CAT assays (see above) and harvested 48 h post-transfection, and total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Primer extension assays were performed as described (38Fodor E. Palese P. Brownlee G.G. Garcia-Sastre A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6283-6290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Influenza viruses were rescued using the method described in Refs. 34Fodor E. Devenish L. Engelhardt O.G. Palese P. Brownlee G.G. Garcia-Sastre A. J.

Virol. 2002; 76: 8989-9001Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Selection of Influenza PB2 Mutants—The conservation of the cap binding structural motif (2 aromatic residues) in the structures available (VP39, eIF4E, and CBP20) suggested that this motif might have evolved in the PB2 subunit of the viral polymerase from different types of influenza virus. An alignment of PB2 subunits of influenza A, B, and C viral types and also of the less related PB2 of Thogoto virus was performed (Fig. 1). All amino acids whose aromatic property was conserved between the four strains were selected for mutational analysis (11 mutants at positions 34, 49, 55, 98, 99, 130, 135, 217, 240, 404, and 572). This selection was further extended to aromatic residues that were not strictly aligned (five mutants at positions 115, 168, 363, 446, and 694) and also to aromatic residues whose aromatic property was not conserved in the divergent Thogoto virus (8 mutants at positions 119, 325, 531, 550, 592, 621, 656, and 658). Three aromatic residues conserved only between influenza A and B and not in influenza C or in Thogoto virus were selected to serve as control amino acids unlikely to be involved in cap binding (three mutants at positions 537, 552, and 633). Altogether, 27 aromatic residues in pcDNA-PB2 were mutated either to a nonconservative alanine residue or to a conservative aromatic residue. It was predicted that, if the mutation affected either of the two positions involved in the aromatic sandwich, a nonconservative mutation would severely diminish cap binding capacity because of interference in the function of the aromatic sandwich. A conservative mutation, however, would normally be predicted to retain a functional sandwich and therefore would allow cap binding. However, it emerged in the course of our study that the introduction of a tryptophan residue can interfere with a functional cap sandwich (40Hu G. Oguro A. Li C. Gershon P.D. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7677-7687Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, we could not exclude candidate positions where both an alanine and tryptophan mutation led to a loss of function. Function of the Mutant PB2 Subunits—To test the function of the PB2 mutants, we initially used an in vivo transcription/replication assay that is based on in vivo reconstitution of PB2 into viral ribonucleoprotein complexes and the expression of a CAT reporter gene. Mutant PB2 proteins were co-expressed in 293T cells with influenza PB1, PA, and NP proteins (the minimal set of influenza viral proteins required for transcription and replication of vRNA) and a vRNA-like CAT RNA, encoding a negative-sense CAT reporter gene (see “Experimental Procedures”). Cell extracts were tested for CAT activity 24 h post-transfection (Table I).Table ICAT reporter analysis of mutant PB2 subunitsAmino acidCAT activitya+++, 10-100%; ++, 1-10%; +, <1%Ala mutationLeu mutationConservative mutationTyr34++++TrpTrp49++++PheTyr55++++++PheTrp98+++++PheTrp99+++++PheTyr115+++++TrpPhe119+++TrpPhe130++TrpPhe135++TrpPhe168++++TrpPhe217+++TrpTrp240+++PhePhe325++++TrpPhe363+++++TyrPhe404+++++TyrPhe446++++TyrTyr531++++PheTrp537++PheTyr550++++TrpTrp552++++++PheTyr572+++TrpTyr592++TrpPhe621++TrpPhe633++TrpPhe656+++TrpTyr658++++TrpPhe694++++++Trpa +++, 10-100%; ++, 1-10%; +, <1% Open table in a new tab Eight positions (Tyr34, Phe168, Phe325, Phe363, Phe404, Phe446, Tyr531, and Tyr550) were initially selected for further studies, since nonconservative mutants at these positions lead to <1% of CAT activity, whereas conservative mutants retained full CAT activity. At 11 other positions, alanine mutants had <1% CAT activity, whereas conservative mutants showed either partial activity (<10%) (F119W, F217W, W240F, Y572W, and F656W), or minimal activity (<1%) (F130W, F135W, W537F, Y592W, F621W, and F633W). These positions, nine of which involved the introduction of a tryptophan residue, remained potential candidates and were also selected for further analysis (see below and Fig. 2C). Additionally, all alanine mutants were tested in a primer extension analysis as a further check that positions involved in cap binding had not been excluded (see below and Fig. 5B).Fig. 5In vivo RNA synthesis mediated by polymerases containing wild type and PB2 mutants at positions Phe363 and Phe404 (A) and wild type and the 25 other PB2 alanine mutants (B).

ApG-primed Transcriptional Activity in Vitro—The eight initially selected pairs of mutants (at positions Tyr34, Phe168, Phe325, Phe363, Phe404, Phe446, Tyr531, and Tyr550) were tested in ApG-primed transcription using the His-tagged polymerase preparations, partially purified by nickel affinity chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). Previous work showed that transcription by influenza RNA polymerase could be primed in vitro by the addition of ApG, thus bypassing the requirement for cap binding (for reviews, see Refs. 21Portela A. Zurcher T. Nieto A. Ortín J. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 54: 319-348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lamb R.A. Krug R.M. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. 4th Ed. Field's Virology. 1. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 1487-1579Google Scholar, 23Fodor E. Brownlee G.G. Potter C.W. Influenza. Elsevier Science, New York2002: 1-30Google Scholar). Therefore, mutants active in ApG-primed transcription would remain candidates for cap binding, whereas mutants defective in ApG-primed transcription could be discarded, because they must have affected functions other than cap-dependent transcription. Four mutant pairs, corresponding to amino acids Phe363, Phe404, Phe446, and Tyr531 (Fig. 2, A and B), remained candidates, since they retained a high level of ApG-primed transcription activity, whether the mutation was conservative or not. On the other hand, four alanine mutants, corresponding to positions Tyr34, Phe168, Phe325, and Tyr550, were discarded under this criterion, since the alanine mutations led to weak ApG-primed transcription (Fig. 2, A and B). At the additional 11 positions (Phe119, Phe130, Phe135, Phe217, Trp240, Trp537, Tyr572, Tyr592, Phe621, Phe633, and Phe656), we selected only alanine mutants to check whether these mutants were negative in ApG-primed transcription, because this would exclude these positions as candidates. None of them remained candidates, since they all showed weak (<20%) ApG-primed transcription activity (Fig. 2C). It was unnecessary to test the conservative mutants at these 11 positions, because the results, whether positive or negative, would not be diagnostic. However, a further analysis was performed later using primer extension as a final check (se"

TNF-α- or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced ICAM-1 promoter activity was inhibited by a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor (staurosporine), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (genistein and herbimycin A), or an Src-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor (PP2). TNF-α- or TPA-induced IκB kinase (IKK) activation was also blocked by these inhibitors, which slightly reversed TNF-α-induced but completely reversed TPA-induced IκBα degradation. c-Src and Lyn, two members of the Src kinase family, were abundantly expressed in A549 cells, and their activation by TNF-α or TPA was inhibited by the same inhibitors. Furthermore, the dominant-negative c-Src (KM) mutant inhibited induction of ICAM-1 promoter activity by TNF-α or TPA. Overexpression of the constitutively active PKCα or wild-type c-Src plasmids induced ICAM-1 promoter activity, this effect being inhibited by the dominant-negative c-Src (KM) or IKKβ (KM) mutant but not by the nuclear factor-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) (KA) mutant. The c-Src (KM) mutant failed to block induction of ICAM-1 promoter activity caused by overexpression of wild-type NIK. In co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblot experiments, IKKβ was found to be associated with c-Src and to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after TNF-α or TPA treatment. Two tyrosine residues, Tyr188 and Tyr199, near the activation loop of IKKβ, were identified as being important for NF-κB activation. Substitution of these residues with phenylalanines abolished ICAM-1 promoter activity and c-Src-dependent phosphorylation of IKKβ induced by TNF-α or TPA. These data suggest that, in addition to activating NIK, TNF-α also activates PKC-dependent c-Src. These two pathways converge at IKKβ and go on to activate NF-κB, via serine phosphorylation and degradation of IκB-α, and, finally, to initiate ICAM-1 expression.

Science. 1992; 255: 1125-1127Google Scholar). The process of leukocyte migration includes several steps (4Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Google Scholar, 5Carlos T. Kovach N. Rosa M. Newman B. Wayner E. Benjamin C. Osborn L. Lobb R. Harlan J. Blood. 1991; 77: 2266-2271Google Scholar). The first of these is adhesion of the leukocyte to the endothelial cell. The initial interaction between the leukocyte and the endothelium is transient, resulting in the leukocyte rolling along the vessel wall. The rolling leukocyte then becomes activated by local factors generated by the endothelium, resulting in its arrest and firm adhesion to the vessel wall. Finally, the leukocyte squeezes between the endothelial cells and migrates to the inflammation site. These complex processes are regulated, in part, by specific adhesion molecules and their counter ligands on both circulating leukocytes and vascular endothelial cells; these include E-selectin (endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1, CD62E) and immunoglobulin superfamily members, such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, CD54) 1The abbreviations used are: ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; IKK, IκB kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; NIK, nuclear factor-κB-inducing kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IL, interleukin; PKC, protein kinase C; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; wt, wild-type; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; DTT, dithiothreitol; TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor; MEKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase; PP2, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine and vascular cell adhesion molecular-1 (6Osborn L.

In a number of inflammation and immune responses, ICAM-1 binds to two integrins belonging to the β2 subfamily, LFA-1 and Mac-1, both expressed by leukocytes and both promoting the adhesion and transendothelial migration of leukocytes (7Dustin M.L.

Similar processes govern the adhesion of leukocytes to lung airway epithelial cells and contribute to the damage to these cells seen in asthma (10Bloemen P.G. Van Den Tweel M.C. Henricks P.A.J.

Basal levels of ICAM-1 are low, but high expression can be induced in a number of cell types by a wide range of ligands, including bacterial lipopolysaccharide, phorbol esters, or inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and interferon-γ (11Tosi M.F.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12030-12035Google Scholar), indicating regulation at the transcriptional level. The promoter region of the human ICAM-1 gene has been cloned and sequenced and shown to contain putative recognition sequences for a variety of transcriptional factors, including nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), AP-2, and the interferon-stimulated response element (15Voraberger G. Shafer R. Stratowa C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2777-2786Crossref Google Scholar). Of these, NF-κB family proteins are essential for the enhanced ICAM-1 gene expression seen in human alveolar epithelial cells on exposure to cytokines (16Chen C.C. Chen J.J. Chou C.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1479-1489Google Scholar, 17Chen C.C. Chou C.Y. Sun Y.T. Huang W.C. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 543-553Google Scholar). The intracellular signaling pathways by which TNF-α and IL-1β cause ICAM-1 expression in A549 human alveolar epithelial cells have been explored and found to involve the sequential activation of protein kinase Cα (PKCα), protein-tyrosine kinase, nuclear factor-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), and IκB kinase β (IKKβ) (16Chen C.C. Chen J.J. Chou C.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1479-1489Google Scholar, 17Chen C.C. Chou C.Y. Sun Y.T. Huang W.C. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 543-553Google Scholar). The role of protein-tyrosine kinase has been further investigated in the present study. Using an immunocomplex kinase assay and site-directed mutagenesis, we have demonstrated that c-Src is involved in TNF-α-inducing NF-κB transcriptional activation and that, in addition to serine phosphorylation of IKKβ by NIK, Tyr188 and Tyr199 phosphorylations by PKC-dependent c-Src activation also contribute to TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 expression in human alveolar epithelial cells.

The PKC-α constitutively active (PKC-α/AE) or dominant-negative mutant (PKCα/KR) were provided by Dr. A. Altman (La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, San Diego, CA). The wild-type (wt) and dominant-negative mutants of NIK and IKKβ (NIK wt and mutant KA; IKKβ wt and mutant KM) were gifts from Signal Pharmaceuticals (San Diego, CA).

Following treatment with TNF-α or TPA, with or without 30-min pretreatment with PKC, tyrosine kinase, or Src kinase inhibitors, the cells were rapidly washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4), then IKK, c-Src, or Lyn was immunoprecipitated. For the in vitro kinase assay, 100 μg of total cell extract was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 0.5 μg of rabbit anti-IKKβ, anti-c-Src, or anti-Lyn antibody, then protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Sigma) were added to the mixture and incubation was continued for 4 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with lysis buffer without Triton X-100, then incubated for 30 m 30 °C in 20 μl of kinase reaction mixture (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmMnCl2, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm DTT) containing 10 μm[γ-32P]ATP and either 1 μg of bacterially expressed GST-IκBα-(1–100) as IKK substrate, 1 μg of acidic denatured enolase as c-Src or Lyn substrate, or 6 μg of bacterially expressed GST-IKKβ-(132–206), GST-IKKβ-(132–206) (Y188F), GST-IKKβ-(132–206) (Y199F), or GST-IKKβ-(132–206) (Y188F; Y199F) as c-Src substrate. The reaction was stopped by addition of an equal volume of Laemmli buffer, the proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and phosphorylated GST-IκBα-(1–100), phosphorylated GST-IΚΚβ-(132–206), or phosphorylated enolase was visualized by autoradiography. Quantitative data were obtained using a computing densitometer and ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Following treatment with TNF-α or TPA, total or immunoprecipitated cell lysates were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE using 7.5% running gels, as described previously (17Chen C.C. Chou C.Y. Sun Y.T. Huang W.C. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 543-553Google Scholar). The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was then incubated successively at room temperature for 1 h with 0.1% milk in TTBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15m NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20), for 1 h with rabbit antibody specific for IKKβ, IκBα, c-Src, Lyn, Lck, or Fyn, and for 30 min with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit antibody. After each incubation, the membrane was washed extensively with TTBS. The immunoreactive bands were detected using ECL detection reagent and Hyperfilm-ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Control cells or cells pretreated with various inhibitors for 30 min were treated with TNF-α for 10 min or with TPA for 30 min, then nuclear extracts were isolated as described previously (17Chen C.C. Chou C.Y. Sun Y.T. Huang W.C. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 543-553Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted, then the cell pellet was resuspended in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mmKCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmDTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4) and incubated for 15 min on ice, then lysed by the addition of 0.5% Nonidet P-40 followed by vigorous vortexing for 10 s. The nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4), and the tube was vigorously shaken at 4 °C for 15 min on a shaking platform. The nuclear extracts were then centrifuged, and the supernatants were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the downstream NF-κB consensus sequence (5′-AGCTTGGAAATTCCGGA-3′) in the human ICAM-1 promoter were synthesized, annealed, and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The nuclear extract (6–10 μg) was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min with 1 ng of32P-labeled NF-κB probe (40,000–60,000 cpm) in 10 μl of binding buffer containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 15 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol as described previously (17Chen C.C. Chou C.Y. Sun Y.T. Huang W.C. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 543-553Google Scholar). DNA·nuclear protein complexes were separated from the DNA probe by electrophoresis on a native 6% polyacrylamide gel, then the gel was vacuum-dried and subjected to autoradiography using an intensifying screen at −80 °C. Using a QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's manual, lysine 295 in the mouse c-Src cloned in the pBluescript vector was substituted with methionine by changing the triplets from AAG to ATG. Tyrosine 199, tyrosine 188, or both sites in the human IKKβ cloned in the pcDNA3.1 vector or in the human GST-IKKβ (132–206) cloned in the pGEX vector were substituted with phenylalanine by changing the triplet from TAC to TTC. The mutated primers used were as follows: primer 1 (5′-CGAGGGTTGCCATCATGACTCTGAAGCCAGGCA-3′) and primer 2 (3′-GCTCCCAACGGTAGTACTGAGACTTCGGTCCGT-5′) for c-Src (K295M) mutation, primer 3 (5′-GGGGACCCTGCAGTTCCTGGCCCCAGAGC-3′) and primer 4 (3′-CCCCTGGGACGTCAAGGACCGGGGTCTCG-5′) for IKKβ (Y188F) mutation, and primer 5 (5′-GGAGCAGCAGAAGTTCACAGTGACCGTCG-3′) and primer 6 (3′-CCTCGTCGTCTTCAAGTGTCACTGGCAGC-5′) for IKKβ (Y199F) mutation. DNA prepared from overnight cultures of picked colonies using Miniprep (Qiagen) was subjected to restriction digest analysis, and the nucleotide changes were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutated c-Src plasmid containing the point mutation was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and inserted into the pcDNA3(+) vector. A549 cells, grown to 50% confluency in six-well plates, were transfected with the human ICAM-1(pIC-339/0)/firefly luciferase (Luc) or κB-luc plasmid using Tfx-50 (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, reporter DNA (0.4 μg) and β-galactosidase DNA (0.2 μg) were mixed with 0.6 μl of Tfx-50 in 1 ml of serum-free DMEM. After 10- to 15-min incubation at room temperature, the mixture was applied to the cells, then, 1 h later, 1 ml of complete growth medium was added. On the following day, the medium was replaced with fresh medium. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were treated with inhibitors (as indicated) for 30 min, then TNF-α or TPA was added for 6 h. Cell extracts were then prepared and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured, the luciferase activity being normalized to the β-galactosidase activity. In experiments using dominant-negative mutants, cells were co-transfected with reporter (0.2 μg) and β-galactosidase (0.1 μg) and either the dominant-negative NIK, IKKβ, or c-Src mutant or the respective empty vector (0.4 μg). In experiments using wt plasmids, cells were co-transfected with the following mixture: 0.2 μg of reporter plasmid; 0.1 μg of β-galactosidase plasmid; 0.4 μg of the constitutively active PKCα (A/E) plasmid, wt c-Src or NIK plasmid (or the respective empty vector); and 0.4 μg of the dominant-negative NIK, IKKβ, or c-Src mutant (or the respective empty vector). Cell lysates containing 1 mg of protein were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of anti-IKKβ or anti-c-Src antibody or with 4 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, then 50 μl of 50% protein A-agarose beads were added and mixed for 16 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were collected and washed three times with lysis buffer without Triton X-100, then Laemmli buffer was added and the samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Western blot analysis was performed as described above using antibodies against phosphotyrosine, IKKβ, or c-Src. In our previous study (17Chen C.C. Chou C.Y. Sun Y.T. Huang W.C. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 543-553Google Scholar), we found that PKC and tyrosine kinase were involved in TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 expression. Transient transfection using the ICAM-1 promoter-luciferase construct, pIC-339 (−339/0) was performed to elucidate the signaling pathway mediated by these kinases. The pIC-339 construct contains the downstream NF-κB site (−189/−174) responsible for mediating the induction of ICAM-1 promoter activity by TNF-α or TPA (17Chen C.C. Chou C.Y. Sun Y.T. Huang W.C. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 543-553Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1, TNF-α led to a 2.9-fold increase in ICAM-1 promoter activity. When cells were pretreated with inhibitors of PKC (staurosporine), tyrosine kinases (genistein or herbimycin A), or Src kinases (PP2), the TNF-α-induced increase was inhibited by 69%, 84%, 65%, or 66%, respectively. TPA treatment, a direct PKC activator, resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in ICAM-1 promoter activity, and this effect was inhibited by genistein, herbimycin A, or PP2 by 74%, 60%, or 87%, respectively. None of these inhibitors alone affected the basal luciferase activity (data not shown). Because TNF-α- and TPA-induced ICAM-1 promoter activity in A549 cells is inhibited by the dominant-negative IKKβ mutant (17Chen C.C. Chou C.Y. Sun Y.T. Huang W.C. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 543-553Google Scholar), endogenous IKK activity was measured by immunoprecipitation with anti-IKKβ antibody. When cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 5, 10, 30, or 60 min, maximal IKK activity was seen after 5 min (Fig.2 A), whereas maximal degradation of IκB-α was seen after 10 min, IκB-α levels being restored to the resting level after 1 h of treatment (Fig.2 B). In TPA-treated cells, maximal IKK activity was seen after 30 min of treatment (Fig. 2 A), whereas maximal IκB-α degradation was seen after 60 min (Fig. 2 B). The TNF-α-induced IKK activation was inhibited by a PKC, tyrosine kinase, or Src kinase inhibitor by 56%, 49%, or 50%, respectively, whereas these same inhibitors suppressed TPA-induced IKK activation by 71%, 91%, or 90%, respectively (Fig.3 A). The IκBα degradation induced by TPA was reversed by PKC, tyrosine kinase, and Src kinase inhibitors, but that induced by TNF-α was only slightly affected by these inhibitors (Fig. 3 B). The effect of these inhibitors on TNF-α- or TPA-induced NF-κB-specific DNA·protein binding was examined. As shown in Fig. 3 C, when cells were treated with TNF-α for 10 min, increased NF-κB-specific DNA·protein binding was seen, and this effect was inhibited by PKC, tyrosine kinase, and Src kinase inhibitors by 20%, 51%, and 48%, respectively. TPA treatment for 30 min also increased NF-κB-specific DNA·protein binding, and this was more effectively suppressed by these inhibitors (75%, 74%, and 87%, respectively; Fig.3 C).Figure 3Effect of various inhibitors on TNF -α- or TPA-induced IKK activity, IκBα degradation, and NF-κB-specific DNA· protein complex formation in epithelial cells. A549 cells were pretreated for 30 min with 300 nm staurosporine, 1 μmherbimycin A, or 10 μm PP2 before incubation with 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 10 min or 1 μm TPA for 30 min, then whole cell lysates or nuclear extracts were prepared. In A, whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IKKβ antibody, and the kinase assay (KA) and autoradiography for phosphorylated GST-IκBα-(1–100) were performed on the precipitates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Levels of immunoprecipitated IKKβ were estimated by Western blotting (WB) using anti-IKKβ antibody. In B, cytosolic levels of IκB-α were measured by Western blotting using anti-IκB-α antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In C, the NF-κB-specific DNA·protein activity in nuclear extracts was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) TNF-α- or TPA-induced IKK activation was inhibited by PKC, tyrosine kinase, and Src kinase inhibitors, indicating the involvement of tyrosine kinase, or at least the Src family, downstream of PKC in the induction of IKK activation. To further characterize the tyrosine kinase involved, Western blot analysis using antibodies against the Src family members, c-Src, Lck, Lyn, and Fyn, was performed. Because c-Src is reported to be expressed in platelets and neuronal tissues, Lck in T lymphocytes, Lyn at high levels in platelets, and Fyn in the brain and T lymphocytes, we used the Jurkat T cell line, the HL-60 promyelocytic cell line, and brain as positive controls. As shown in Fig. 4 A, c-Src was abundantly expressed in brain, in Jurkat and HL-60 cells, and in the human alveolar epithelial cell lines NCI-H292 and A549. Lck was abundantly expressed in brain and Jurkat cells, but only weakly expressed in NCI-H292 and A549 cells. Lyn was abundantly expressed in brain and in Jurkat, HL-60, NCI-H292, and A549 cells, whereas Fyn was only expressed in brain and in Jurkat and HL-60 cells. c-Src and Lyn in A549 cells were therefore isolated by immunoprecipitation using anti-c-Src or anti-Lyn antibody, and their in vitro kinase activity was measured using enolase as substrate. As shown in Fig.4 B, when A549 cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 10, 30, or 60 min, maximal c-Src and Lyn activity (enolase phosphorylation) was seen after 10 min and was maintained to 60 min. In addition, marked autophosphorylation of c-Src and Lyn was seen over the same time period. TPA (1 μm) also induced c-Src and Lyn activation after 30-min treatment of A549 cells (Fig.5). The TNF-α- and TPA-induced activation of c-Src and Lyn was inhibited by staurosporine, herbimycin A, and PP2 (Fig. 5).Figure 5Effect of various inhibitors on TNF -α- or TPA-induced c-Src or Lyn activation in epithelial cells. A549 cells were pretreated with 300 nm staurosporine, 1 μm herbimycin A, or 10 μm PP2 for 30 min before incubation with 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 10 min or 1 μm TPA for 30 min. Whole cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Src or anti-Lyn antibody, and the kinase assay (KA) and autoradiography for phosphorylated enolase were performed on the precipitate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Levels of immunoprecipitated c-Src or Lyn were estimated by Western blotting (WB) using anti-c-Src or anti-Lyn antibody, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The TNF-α- or TPA-induced activation of c-Src and Lyn was inhibited by PKC, tyrosine kinase, or Src kinase inhibitors. This indicated that PKC-dependent c-Src and Lyn activation was required to induce IKK and NF-κB activation in A549 cells. To further examine the involvement of c-Src, a dominant-negative mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of mouse c-Src lysine 295 to methionine. Overexpression of c-Src (KM) attenuated the TNF-α- or TPA-induced ICAM-1 promoter activity (Fig.6). The TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 promoter activity was also inhibited by the dominant-negative NIK (KA) and IKKβ (KM) mutants, as previously reported (17Chen C.C. Chou C.Y. Sun Y.T. Huang W.C. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 543-553Google Scholar). To characterize the relationship between PKC, c-Src, NIK, and IKKβ, overexpression of the constitutively active form of PKCα (A/E) or of wt c-Src, NIK, or IKKβ was performed. Overexpression of PKCα (A/E) or wt c-Src, NIK, or IKKβ significantly increased ICAM-1 promoter activity by 2-, 2.7-, 3.4-, or 2.5-fold, respectively (Fig.7 A). The ICAM-1 promoter activity induced by overexpression of PKCα (A/E) or c-Src wt was inhibited by the dominant-negative c-Src (KM) or IKKβ (KM) mutant, but not by the NIK (KA) mutant. In contrast, the dominant-negative IKKβ (KM) mutant, but not the c-Src (KM) mutant, attenuated the promoter activity induced by overexpression of NIK wt (Fig.7 B). These results indicate the involvement of both the PKC/c-Src/IKKβ and NIK/IKKβ pathways in TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 expression in A549 cells.Figure 7Effect of various dominant-negative mutants on wild-type plasmid-induced ICAM-1 promoter activity. InA, A549 cells were co-transfected with pIC339 and the constitutively active form of PKCα (A/E), wild-type c-Src, IKKβ, or NIK, or the respective empty vector. In B, A549 cells were co-transfected for 24 h with PKCα (A/E), wild-type c-Src, or NIK and c-Src (K295M), IKKβ (KM), or NIK (KA). Luciferase activity was then assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the results were normalized to the β-galactosidase activity and expressed as the mean ± S.E. for three independent experiments performed in triplicate. *, p < 0.05; **,p < 0.01 compared with the control vector.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because c-Src-dependent IKK activation was shown to be involved, co-immunoprecipitation of c-Src and IKKβ was performed to examine whether c-Src directly regulates IKK activity through phosphorylation of tyrosine residues. When cells were treated with TNF-α for 5, 10, or 15 min, IKKβ was tyrosine-phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner, the maximal effect being seen at 10 min; a similar effect was seen after 30-min treatment with TPA (Fig. 8 A). Both effects were inhibited by PP2 (Fig. 8 A). To demonstrate that c-Src associated with IKKβ and phosphorylated its tyrosine residues, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IKKβ antibodies, then the immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes, and blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 8 B, tyrosine phosphorylation of IKKβ was seen after TNF-α or TPA treatment, the effect being maximal at 10 or 30 min, respectively, and inhibited by PP2.

https://openalex.org/W2006803834,"In humans, inactivation of the DNA polymerase η gene (pol η) results in sunlight sensitivity and causes the cancer-prone xeroderma pigmentosum variant syndrome (XP-V). Cells from XP-V individuals have a reduced capacity to replicate UV-damaged DNA and show hypermutability after UV exposure. Biochemical assays have demonstrated the ability of pol η to bypass cis-syn-cyclobutane thymine dimers, the most common lesion generated in DNA by UV. In most cases, this bypass is error-free. To determine the actual requirement of pol η in vivo, XP-V cells (XP30RO) were complemented by the wild type pol η gene. We have used two pol η-corrected clones to study the in vivo characteristics of mutations produced by DNA polymerases during DNA synthesis of UV-irradiated shuttle vectors transfected into human host cells, which had or had not been exposed previously to UV radiation. The functional complementation of XP-V cells by pol η reduced the mutation frequencies both at CG and TA base pairs and restored UV mutagenesis to a normal level. UV irradiation of host cells prior to transfection strongly increased the mutation frequency in undamaged vectors and, in addition, especially in the pol η-deficient XP30RO cells at 5′-TT sites in UV-irradiated plasmids. These results clearly show the protective role of pol η against UV-induced lesions and the activation by UV of pol η-independent mutagenic processes. In humans, inactivation of the DNA polymerase η gene (pol η) results in sunlight sensitivity and causes the cancer-prone xeroderma pigmentosum variant syndrome (XP-V). Cells from XP-V individuals have a reduced capacity to replicate UV-damaged DNA and show hypermutability after UV exposure. Biochemical assays have demonstrated the ability of pol η to bypass cis-syn-cyclobutane thymine dimers, the most common lesion generated in DNA by UV. In most cases, this bypass is error-free. To determine the actual requirement of pol η in vivo, XP-V cells (XP30RO) were complemented by the wild type pol η gene. We have used two pol η-corrected clones to study the in vivo characteristics of mutations produced by DNA polymerases during DNA synthesis of UV-irradiated shuttle vectors transfected into human host cells, which had or had not been exposed previously to UV radiation. The functional complementation of XP-V cells by pol η reduced the mutation frequencies both at CG and TA base pairs and restored UV mutagenesis to a normal level. UV irradiation of host cells prior to transfection strongly increased the mutation frequency in undamaged vectors and, in addition, especially in the pol η-deficient XP30RO cells at 5′-TT sites in UV-irradiated plasmids. These results clearly show the protective role of pol η against UV-induced lesions and the activation by UV of pol η-independent mutagenic processes. Solar UV induces lesions in genomic DNA. If not repaired by one of the error-free pathways, these lesions can give rise to mutations. In a large percentage of skin tumors, mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are characterized by the “UV mutagenesis signature” namely C → T transitions at pyrimidine-pyrimidine sites and CC → TT tandem mutations (1Brash D.E. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 410-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 2Sarasin A. Mutat. Res. 1999; 428: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which UV-induced damage results in mutations remains unclear. The frequency and the nature of mutation depends on the types of initial DNA damage, their potential to miscode during DNA replication, and the probability that specific enzymes act on a given type of damage. The mutational specificity of UV light correlates with the formation in DNA of the two predominant UV-induced lesions, the cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) 1The abbreviations used are: CPD, cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; MER, mutation error rate; XP-V, xeroderma pigmentosum variant; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; pol η, polymerase η; 6-4PP, pyrimidine-6/4-pyrimidone; TLS, translesion synthesis.1The abbreviations used are: CPD, cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; MER, mutation error rate; XP-V, xeroderma pigmentosum variant; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; pol η, polymerase η; 6-4PP, pyrimidine-6/4-pyrimidone; TLS, translesion synthesis. and the pyrimidine-6/4-pyrimidone (6-4PP) photoproducts (3Sage E. Photochem. Photobiol. 1993; 57: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 4Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In naked DNA, a similar distribution of the main UV-induced photoproducts was obtained with either UVC (254 nm) or UVB (280–320 nm). In both cases, the T = T CPD is the most abundant photoproduct. The T = C CPD and the T(6-4)C damage are produced in similar yields, whereas the level of the T(6-4)T lesion and photoproducts at CT and CC sites remains much lower (5Douki T. Cadet J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2495-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). These DNA lesions are normally repaired by the nucleotide excision repair system (6de Laat W.L. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 768-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). The 6-4PPs are rapidly and efficiently removed by nucleotide excision repair within a few hours after cell irradiation, whereas the CPDs are repaired rather slowly and incompletely (7Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Although individual unrepaired 6-4PPs are more mutagenic than CPDs (8Gentil A. Le Page F. Margot A. Lawrence C.W. Borden A. Sarasin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1837-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 9Lawrence C.W. Gibbs P.E. Borden A. Horsfall M.J. Kilbey B.J. Mutat. Res. 1993; 299: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), CPDs are thought to be responsible for the majority of the premutagenic lesions in mammalian cells (10Kamiya H. Iwai S. Kasai H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11Marionnet C. Armier J. Sarasin A. Stary A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 102-108PubMed Google Scholar, 12You Y.H. Lee D.H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44688-44694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), probably because the CPDs are more frequent and repaired much less efficiently than the 6-4PP lesions. Although T = T CPDs are relatively more frequent than CPD containing cytosine, UV-induced mutations occur predominantly at 5′-TC-3′ and 5′-CC-3′ dipyrimidine sites, particularly in vivo in key genes found mutated in skin cancers. In most cases they are C → T transitions, arising from the misincorporation of an adenine opposite the 3′-C of 5′-TC-3′ and 5′-CC-3′ sites. The weak contribution of T = T dimers to the UV mutation spectrum in vivo could be explained by a specific and accurate DNA damage tolerance mechanism. UV-induced DNA damage presents a strong block for the replication machinery, probably because of the inability of replicative DNA polymerases to deal with DNA distortions. Specialized DNA polymerases are temporarily required to perform translesion synthesis (TLS) (13Friedberg E.C. Wagner R. Radman M. Science. 2002; 296: 1627-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 14Lehmann A.R. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 253: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Wang Z. Mutat.

In bacteria, when DNA damage blocks the normal replication process, an “SOS” response is activated, and more than 20 genes are induced (17Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 17-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 18Sutton M.D. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8342-8349Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Among these genes, two DNA polymerases (DNA polymerases IV and V) are able to continue to synthesize DNA for a few bases across the damaged site and put an incorrect base opposite the lesion, producing a mutation. In yeast, three genes (REV1, REV3, and REV7) are required for most DNA damage-induced mutagenesis. Rev3 and Rev7 code for a specific mutagenic DNA polymerase activity (pol ζ) required for translesion synthesis and the Rev1 gene product is a dCMP transferase (19Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1646-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). In parallel to this error-prone activity, yeast cells have another specialized DNA polymerase, DNA polymerase η encoded by the RAD30 gene (pol η), that can perform translesion synthesis in a relatively error-free way (20Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 283: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Most DNA polymerases associated with TLS belong to the Y family of DNA polymerases that have in common a highly distributive mode of DNA synthesis and copy undamaged DNA templates with low fidelity (21Friedberg E.C. Fischhaber P.L. Kisker C. Cell. 2001; 107: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22Matsuda T. Bebenek K. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A.

Prakash L. Prakash S. Todo T. Walker G.C. Wang Z. Woodgate R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 7-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Among TLS polymerases, human DNA polymerase η (pol η) is noteworthy for its ability to bypass T = T dimers and undamaged T-T residues in vitro with a similar efficiency and to insert predominantly two As opposite a T = T (24Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7447-7450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 25Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Hanaoka F.

Nature. 1999; 399: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar), suggesting that it is able to carry out error-free TLS past T = T CPDs in vivo. The relevance of human pol η to mutagenesis in vivo is demonstrated by the existence of patients mutated in the human pol η gene (27Johnson R.E. Kondratick C.M. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 285: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 28Masutani C. Araki M. Yamada A. Kusumoto R. Nogimori T. Maekawa T. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3491-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). These patients are affected by the variant form of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP-V), a rare, autosomal, recessive human genetic syndrome with sun hypersensitivity associated with numerous skin abnormalities and a high level of early and multiple skin cancers on sun-exposed sites in the body (29Berneburg M. Lehmann A.R. Adv. Genet. 2001; 43: 71-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kraemer K.H. Lee M.M. Scotto J. Arch. Dermatol. 1987; 123: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). The phenotype of XP-V cells includes UV hypersensitivity, especially in the presence of caffeine (31Arlett C.F. Harcourt S.A. Broughton B.C. Mutat. Res. 1975; 33: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and UV-hypermutability that is consistent with the high cancer proneness in XP-V patients (32Maher V.M. Ouellette L.M. Curren R.D. McCormick J.J. Nature. 1976; 261: 593-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 33McGregor W.G. Wei D. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Mol. Cell.

Dermatol. 1993; 101: 744-748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). XP-V cells are proficient in nucleotide excision repair but are impaired in lesion bypass associated with DNA replication on damaged templates (37Lehmann A.R. Kirk-Bell S. Arlett C.F. Paterson M.C. Lohman P.H. de Weerd-Kastelein E.A. Bootsma D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Cell-free extracts of XP-V patients are unable to perform bypass through a T = T dimer (38Cordeiro-Stone M. Zaritskaya L.S. Price L.K. Kaufmann W.K. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2206-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Restoration of efficient DNA synthesis past a T = T dimer by the addition of pol η protein in cell-free extracts demonstrated the essential role of pol η in replication of this photoproduct in vitro (26Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Yamada A. Dohmae N. Yokoi M. Yuasa M. Araki M. Iwai S. Takio K. Hanaoka F. Nature. 1999; 399: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). Complementation of UV + caffeine hypersensitivity after transfection of the human pol η cDNA into XP-V cells definitively assigned pol η as the gene responsible for the genetic defect in XP-V patients (43Kannouche P. Broughton B.C. Volker M. Hanaoka F. Mullenders L.H. Lehmann A.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 44Thakur M. Wernick M. Collins C. Limoli C.L. Crowley E. Cleaver J.E. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2001; 32: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 45Yamada A. Masutani C. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2473-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Most mutations in the pol η gene in XP-V patients are heavily biased toward the N-terminal region and encode a pol η protein with either mis-sense mutations or severe truncations that abolish both DNA polymerase and bypass activities (46Broughton B.C. Cordonnier A. Kleijer W.J. Jaspers N.G. Fawcett H. Raams A. Garritsen V.H. Stary A. Avril M.F. Boudsocq F. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Fuchs R.P. Sarasin A. Lehmann A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Complementation of the defect in XP-V cells required not only the N-terminal catalytic domain of pol η but also the C-terminal 120 amino acids containing a bipartite nuclear localization signal and a sequence needed for the relocalization into replication foci. Indeed, in normal cells, pol η is distributed most uniformly in the nucleoplasm in most cells, but following UV irradiation, it accumulates with proliferating cell nuclear antigen in intranuclear foci, which represent forks stalled at sites of unrepaired DNA damage (43Kannouche P. Broughton B.C. Volker M. Hanaoka F. Mullenders L.H. Lehmann A.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). To evaluate the contribution of pol η to UV mutagenesis in vivo, we compared the UV-induced mutation spectra produced in the pol η-deficient XP-V cell line (XP30RO) and in stable pol η-complemented clones derived from these cells. We assessed by DNA sequencing the error rates and the types of mutations generated by replication of UVC-irradiated SV40-based shuttle vectors in unirradiated or UVC-irradiated human host cells. Because replication of UV-damaged plasmids requires the human cellular replication machinery, the level and the kind of mutagenic TLS are dependent on the presence of pol η in host human cells and can be modulated by the localization of pol η in replication foci after UV radiation. Our data demonstrate that the expression of pol η in XP variant cells gives rise to a strong decrease in the number of errors generated during DNA synthesis past UV photoproducts, especially at T = T lesions in UV-irradiated host cells but also at C sites. UV irradiation of host cells prior to replicating plasmids induces an error-prone mode of replication that is pol η-independent on undamaged plasmids, but pol η-dependent on damaged plasmids. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—All experiments were performed using SV40-transformed MRC5V1 (normal) and XP30RO human fibroblasts (47Volpe J.P. Cleaver J.E. Mutat. Res. 1995; 337: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The XP30RO cell line has a homozygous deletion near the 5′-extremity of the pol η gene leading to a severe truncation of the pol η protein (26Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Yamada A. Dohmae N. Yokoi M. Yuasa M. Araki M. Iwai S. Takio K. Hanaoka F. Nature. 1999; 399: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar, 46Broughton B.C. Cordonnier A. Kleijer W.J. Jaspers N.G. Fawcett H. Raams A. Garritsen V.H. Stary A. Avril M.F. Boudsocq F. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Fuchs R.P. Sarasin A. Lehmann A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Isolation of complemented cells by the wild type pol η gene has been described previously (43Kannouche P. Broughton B.C. Volker M. Hanaoka F. Mullenders L.H. Lehmann A.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants isolated from transfection of pCDNA.3zeo-pol η plasmid or vector with no insert were grown in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, fungizone (2.5 μg/ml), antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin), and 100 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). MRC5V1 cl1 and XP30RO cl4 harboring the pCDNA.3zeo (Invitrogen) plasmid without the pol η insert were utilized as control cell lines and are referred to MRC5 and XP30RO cells. UV Survival Assay—Cells were plated at 100–1000 cells per 100-mm dishes and incubated for 24 h. They were then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and irradiated with 254 nm UV light using a germicidal lamp at a fluence rate of 0.24 J/m2/s. After 15 days of incubation in culture medium containing 75 μg/ml caffeine (Sigma), the colonies were fixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa, and colonies with >50 cells were counted. Three dishes were utilized for each dose. Cell Cycle Analysis—Twenty four hours after exposure to 0 or 7 J/m2 of UVC and caffeine (75 μg/ml) added to the medium, cells were pulsed with BrdUrd for 1 h, harvested, and stained for replicative DNA synthesis with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody and for DNA content with propidium iodide. Mutagenesis Assay—The shuttle vector SV40-based pR2 carries the 300-bp bacterial lacZ′ gene and bacterial promoter as mutagenesis target, the kanamycin resistance gene, and the SV40 and bacterial replication origins (48Marionnet C. Benoit A. Benhamou S. Sarasin A. Stary A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 550-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The p205-KMT11 plasmid carries the SV40 T-antigen gene required for replication of the pR2 plasmid (49Stary A. Menck C.F. Sarasin A. Mutat. Res. 1992; 272: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Both vectors were transfected together into the host cells. The RecA-deficient Escherichia coli DH5αMCR (Invitrogen) was used for screening of lacZ′ mutants among plasmid progeny. Irradiation of plasmid DNA was performed with 254 nm UV light using a germicidal lamp at a fluence rate of 30 J/m2/s. Cells were irradiated at 7 J/m2 with 254 nm UV light using a germicidal lamp at a fluence rate of 0.24 J/m2/s. Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 per 100-mm dish and incubated for 24 h. Undamaged DNA (10 μg of plasmid DNA) or UV-exposed pR2 vectors (10 μg of plasmid DNA) were then cotransfected with the 5 μg of unirradiated p205-KMT11 plasmid into unirradiated or irradiated cells at 7 J/m2 just before DNA transfection by the polyethyleneimine precipitation method (50Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5526) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 4 days and then collected by trypsinization for extrachromosomal DNA extraction. At least three independent cell transfections were performed for each dose and for each cell line. Plasmid DNA isolated from cells was purified by a small scale alkaline lysis method (51Stary A. Sarasin A. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1679-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and treated with DpnI restriction endonuclease to remove any unreplicated pR2. Rescued plasmid DNA was shuttled to competent E. coli DH5αMCR for selection of mutant vectors, and transformed colonies were plated on selective medium (48Marionnet C. Benoit A. Benhamou S. Sarasin A. Stary A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 550-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The α-complementation between the lacZ′ gene carried by the pR2 vector and the truncated lacZ gene of DH5α bacteria gives rise to blue (wild type) or white/light blue (mutant) colonies. Selected colonies were then isolated and restreaked on the same medium to confirm the mutant phenotype. Plasmid DNA was prepared by small scale alkaline lysis, and sequence analysis at the lacZ′ locus was performed with Big Dye terminator on an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer. Mutant frequency corresponds to the number of colonies containing mutated plasmid at the lacZ′ locus determined after DNA sequencing divided by the total number of bacterial colonies. Mutation error rate (MER) corresponds to the average of the frequency of each independent mutation calculated as the ratio of each independent mutation divided by the total number of bacterial colonies rescued from the cell transfection experiment in which the mutation was isolated. Identical mutations that occurred more than once among sequences analyzed from the same cell transfection were excluded, thus ensuring that each mutation is the result of one event of bypass process and not of several rounds of replication of one mutated plasmid during the 4-day postincubation after DNA transfection. Although this will lead to a slight underestimation of the mutation frequency at hotspot sites, the number of individual transfections is sufficient enough to ensure that no major hot spots are missed. Statistical Analysis—The significance of differences of percentages was assessed using χ2 or Fisher's exact test when appropriate, and the significance of differences of mutant and mutation error rates was assessed with the Student's t test. Mutation hotspot analysis was carried out according to the Poisson law at a probability of less than 1%. The hypergeometric test was used to check the significant differences in the distribution of mutations between spectra (52Adams W.T. Skopek T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 53Cariello N.F. Cui L. Beroud C. Soussi T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4454-4460PubMed Google Scholar). Complementation of UV Sensitivity of XP-V Cells by the Human pol η cDNA—Stable clones expressing the pol η protein were isolated after transfection of pCDNA-pol η plasmid into pol η-deficient XP30RO cells as described previously (43Kannouche P. Broughton B.C. Volker M. Hanaoka F. Mullenders L.H. Lehmann A.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Among the stable XP30RO transfectants, we characterized two clones, XP30RO/pol η cl5 and XP30RO/pol η cl6 cells, for their resistance to UV irradiation in the presence of caffeine, which specifically enhances UV sensitivity of XP-V cells, thereby allowing a clear discrimination between XP-V and normal cells (31Arlett C.F. Harcourt S.A. Broughton B.C. Mutat. Res. 1975; 33: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The expression of wild type pol η protein, determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1) in the two complemented clones, is similar in XP30RO/pol η cl5 and normal MRC5 cells and slightly higher in XP30RO/pol η cl6 cells. As expected no pol η was detected in the parental XP30RO cells. The UV sensitivity of XP30RO/pol η cl5 and XP30RO/pol η cl6 clones was monitored by cell cycle analysis and cell survival after UVC irradiation and was compared with that of XP30RO and normal MRC5 fibroblasts, both transfected by vector without insert. The distribution of cells in the G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle 24 h after UV + caffeine treatment are shown in Fig. 2A, and a quantitative assessment of cell cycle distribution is illustrated in Fig. 2B. In the absence of UV, the number of BrdUrd-labeled cells in S phase was similar in all cell lines (18–25%). UV irradiation and the addition of caffeine did not substantially change the proportion of BrdUrd-labeled XP30RO/pol η cl5 (28%), XP30RO/pol η cl6 (24%), or MRC5 cells (34%) in S phase 24 h after irradiation. In contrast, only a very small number of XP30RO cells (3%) incorporated BrdUrd. Examination of the distribution of DNA content in these cells (Fig. 2A, lower row, 2nd panel) shows that many of them were blocked in S phase by the UV + caffeine treatment. Thus, pol η is able to prevent the prolonged delay in S phase after UV irradiation typical of XP-V cells. The differential effect of UVC on XP30RO/pol η cl5, XP30RO/pol η cl6, and XP30RO cells was also demonstrated by examining cell survival after UVC exposure and caffeine post-treatment with a colony forming ability assay (Fig. 2C). The survival curves of XP30RO/pol η cl5 and XP30RO/pol η cl6 cells were indistinguishable from that of normal MRC5 cells, whereas XP30RO cells were extremely sensitive to UV irradiation in the presence of caffeine (3% at 4 J/m2), as expected for XP-V cells. A similar result was obtained when viability was assessed by the ability of the cells to incorporate [3H]thymidine 2–4 days after exposure to different doses of UV in the presence of caffeine (46Broughton B.C. Cordonnier A. Kleijer W.J. Jaspers N.G. Fawcett H. Raams A. Garritsen V.H. Stary A. Avril M.F. Boudsocq F. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Fuchs R.P. Sarasin A. Lehmann A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The expression of pol η in XP30RO/pol η cl5 and XP30RO/pol η cl6 cells therefore results in the correction of UV sensitivity to normal levels. The functional complementation of XP30RO/pol η cl5 and XP30RO/pol η cl6 cells compared with their parental counterpart XP30RO cells deficient in the expression of pol η gave us the opportunity to examine the outcome of the expression of pol η on UV mutagenesis in vivo. Plasmid Mutagenesis—The SV40-based shuttle vector pR2 (48Marionnet C. Benoit A. Benhamou S. Sarasin A. Stary A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 550-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was irradiated with different UV doses (500, 1000, or 2000 J/m2) and immediately transfected into XP30RO/pol η cl5, XP30RO/pol η cl6, XP30RO, and MRC5 cells. In some experiments the recipient cells were pre-irradiated with a UV dose of 7 J/m2. Cells were further incubated for 4 days to allow DNA replication and mutation fixation to take place. The plasmid DNAs were recovered from human cells and shuttled into E. coli for mutant plasmid screening at the nonessential lacZ′ locus. Phenotypic selection of lacZ′ mutants followed by DNA sequencing enabled us to determine the mutant error rates and the sequence alterations. Unirradiated plasmid DNA replication in unirradiated host cells (Fig. 3A) led to similar background mutant frequencies in the parental XP30RO cells (39 × 10–5) and in the corrected XP30RO/pol η cl5 and XP30RO/pol η cl6 cells (24 × 10–5 and 17 × 10–5 respectively). Mutant frequencies after replication of UV-irradiated shuttle vectors were increased significantly in all cells relative to the background levels. However, when UV-damaged plasmids replicated in XP30RO cells, there was a 5.1-fold increase in mutant frequencies from 39 × 10–5 to 200 × 10–5 (Student's t test; p < 0.001), reflecting the cellular hypermutability of XP variant cells. The mutant error rates in XP30RO cells at all doses of plasmid irradiation were much higher than those in the XP30RO/pol η cl5, XP30RO/pol η cl6, and MRC5 cells (p < 0.001). The transfected wild type pol η gene thus complements the high UV-induced mutant frequency characteristic of XP-V cells. After introduction of plasmid DNA into UV-exposed cells (7 J/m2) (Fig. 3B), there was an increase of the background frequencies in all cells, changing from 39 × 10–5 to 213 × 10–5 for XP30RO cells (5.5 times), from 24 × 10–5 to 165 × 10–5 for XP30RO/pol η cl5 cells (6.9 times), and from 17 × 10–5 to 87 × 10–5 for XP30RO/pol η cl6 cells (5.1 times). Since the global enhancement of the mutant error rate affected both pol η-deficient and -proficient cells, the cellular process involved in this increase is independent of the cellular status of pol η. The UV-induced mutant frequency in XP30RO cells (787 × 10–5 and 565 × 10–5 at 1000 and 2000 J/m2 doses of plasmid irradiation), however, remained substantially higher than the background mutant error rate (p < 0.02). In contrast, the mutant frequencies in XP30RO/pol η cl5 and XP30RO/pol η cl6 cells were not significantly different from the background frequencies. These data show that the expression of pol η in XP variant cells gives rise to a strong decrease in errors generated during replication of UV lesions.

Although bcl-2 was first cloned as the t(14:18) translocation breakpoint from human follicular B cell lymphoma, the mechanism of overexpression of bcl-2 is largely undefined for advanced prostate cancer because there are no gross alterations in the gene structure. We investigated the role of the product of the prostate apoptosis response gene-4 (Par-4) and the product of the Wilms' tumor 1 gene (WT1) in the regulation of Bcl-2 expression in prostate cancer cell lines. We observed growth arrest and apoptosis, upon decreasing Bcl-2 protein and transcript in the high Bcl-2-expressing, androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line, by all-trans-retinoic acid treatment (ATRA), but this did not occur in the androgen-dependent cell line expressing low levels of Bcl-2. The decrease in the Bcl-2 protein and transcript following all-trans-retinoic acid treatment was accompanied by changes in localization of Par-4 and an induction in the expression of WT1 protein. In stable clones expressing ectopic Par-4 and in ATRA-treated cells, we observed decreased Bcl-2 protein and transcript. This was accompanied by an induction in WT1 expression. The involvement of WT1 in the Par-4-mediated down-modulation of Bcl-2 was further defined by blocking endogenous WT1 expression, which resulted in an increase in Bcl-2 expression. Finally, we detected Par-4 and WT1 proteins binding to a previously identified WT1-binding site on the bcl-2 promoter both in vitro and in vivo leading to a decrease in transcription from the bcl-2 promoter. We conclude that Par-4 regulates Bcl-2 through a WT1-binding site on the bcl-2 promoter. These data also identify Par-4 nuclear localization as a novel mechanism for ATRA-mediated bcl-2 regulation. Elevated expression levels of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene have been extensively correlated with the appearance of androgen independence in prostate cancer.

Overexpression of Bcl-2 in prostate cancer is a hallmark of advanced hormone-refractory disease and may account for the resistance to apoptosis that is characteristic of the late stages (1Oh W.K. Kantoff P.W. J. Clin. Oncol. 1999; 17: 3664-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 2Lara Jr., P.N. Meyers F.J. Cancer Invest. 1999; 17: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This correlation is strengthened by in vitro studies that demonstrate an increased Bcl-2 expression upon androgen withdrawal in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells (3Raffo A.J. Perlman H. Chen M.W. Day M.L. Streitman J.S. Buttyan R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4438-4445PubMed Google Scholar, 4McDonnell T.J. Troncoso P. Brisbay S.M. Logothetis C. Chung L.W. Hsieh J.T. Tu S.M. Campbell M.L.

Pathol. 1993; 143: 390-400PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that high Bcl-2 expression in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells is associated with cytoplasmic sequestration of the p53 protein, thereby impairing the nuclear transport of p53 in response to an apoptotic signal (6Beham A. Marin M.C. Fernandez A. Herrmann J. Brisbay S. Tari A.M. Lopez-Berestein G. Lozano G. Sarkiss M. McDonnell T.J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2767-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Bcl-2 also correlates with poor prognosis for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy or hormonal ablation. In addition, high levels of Bcl-2 confer resistance to chemotherapy in prostate cancer cell lines, and current clinical efforts are aimed at modulating the expression of Bcl-2 (3Raffo A.J. Perlman H. Chen M.W. Day M.L. Streitman J.S. Buttyan R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4438-4445PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vivo studies have demonstrated that increased expression of Bcl-2 accelerates the appearance of the androgen-independent phenotype in prostate cancer and that decreasing Bcl-2 expression delays progression to androgen independence along with enhancing chemosensitivity of these tumors (7Miyake H. Tolcher A. Gleave M.E. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4030-4034PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gleave M.E. Miayake H. Goldie J. Nelson C. Tolcher A. Gleave M. Urology. 1999; 54: 36-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 9Bruckheimer E.M. Guo Y. Histol. Histopathol. 2000; 15: 1211-1223PubMed Google Scholar). The bcl-2 gene is a key determinant of neoplastic cell expansion whose oncogenic activity has been ascribed primarily to its ability to promote cell survival (10Strasser A. Huang D.C. Vaux D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 151-178PubMed Google Scholar). It was first cloned as the t(14:18) translocation breakpoint from follicular lymphoma (11Tsujimoto Y. Finger L.R. Yunis J. Nowell P.C. Croce C.M. Science. 1984; 226: 1097-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar, 12Tsujimoto Y. Cossman J. Jaffe E. Croce C.M. Science. 1985; 228: 1440-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). This translocation results in the juxtaposition of the bcl-2 gene in front of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer that leads to aberrant expression. In addition to lymphomas with t(14:18) translocations, high levels of Bcl-2 protein, aberrant patterns of Bcl-2 protein production, or both have been observed in a variety of solid tumors (13Reed J.C. Meister L. Tanaka S. Cuddy M. Yum S. Geyer C. Pleasure D. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6529-6538PubMed Google Scholar, 14Pezzella F. Turley H. Kuzu I. Tungekar M.F. Dunnill M.S. Pierce C.B. Harris A. Gatter K.C. Mason D.Y. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to lymphomas, no evidence for gross alterations in the bcl-2 gene structure has been obtained for these other types of cancer, suggesting that expression is controlled through transcription initiation at the bcl-2 promoter (15Kallakury B.V. Figge J. Leibovich B. Hwang J. Rifkin M. Kaufman R. Figge H.L. Nazeer T. Ross J.S. Mod. Pathol. 1996; 9: 41-47PubMed Google Scholar). Two promoter regions have been identified in the 5′-regulatory region of the bcl-2 gene. P1, the predominant promoter in B cells, is a TATA-less, GC-rich region containing multiple initiation sites (16Young R.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. & Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 3686-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 17Wilson B.E. Mochon E. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5546-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 18Chen H.M. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3840-3847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second promoter, P2, is located 1.3 kb downstream of P1, contains a CCAAT box, an octamer motif, and a TATA element. This promoter is active in neuronal cells and some pre-B cells (18Chen H.M. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3840-3847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Smith M.D. Ensor E.A. Coffin R.S. Boxer L.M. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16715-16722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). bcl-2 promoter usage in prostate cancer cells and the identity of transcription factors that regulate its expression in these cells remain uncharacterized. Recently, nuclear factor-κB has been identified to bind to the bcl-2 P2 promoter via κB sites and activate its transcription in prostate cancer cells in response to tumor necrosis factor-α treatment (20Catz S.D. Johnson J.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7342-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of Bcl-2 overexpression in androgen-independent prostate cancer are undefined. The product of the prostate apoptosis response gene-4 (Par-4), although not a classical transcription factor, is co-expressed along with Bcl-2 in the normal prostate basal epithelia (23Boghaert E.R. Sells S.F. Walid A.J. Malone P. Williams N.M. Weinstein M.H. Strange R. Rangnekar V.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 881-890PubMed Google Scholar). Following differentiation of these cells to luminal/secretory epithelia, Par-4 expression is decreased and mainly restricted to the nucleus, and Bcl-2 expression is lost (23Boghaert E.R. Sells S.F. Walid A.J. Malone P. Williams N.M. Weinstein M.H. Strange R. Rangnekar V.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 881-890PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, ectopic expression of Par-4 led to the down-modulation of Bcl-2 protein expression in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts and in PC3 prostate cancer cell lines (24Qiu G. Ahmed M. Sells S.F. Mohiuddin M. Weinstein M.H. Rangnekar V.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). An inverse correlation in the expression of Bcl-2 and Par-4 also has been reported in the xenografts of human androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer developed in mice as well as in acute lymphocytic leukemia (21Boehrer S. Chow K.U. Puccetti E. Ruthardt M. Godzisard S. Krapohl A. Schneider B. Hoelzer D. Mitrou P.S. Rangnekar V.M. Weidmann E. Hematol.

Par-4 is approximately a 39-kDa protein, first identified by differential screening for early response genes up-regulated during induction of apoptosis in prostate cells (25Sells S.F. Wood Jr., D.P. Joshi-Barve S.S. Muthukumar S. Jacob R.J. Crist S.A. Humphreys S. Rangnekar V.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 457-466PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of Par-4 predicts a leucine zipper protein with a nuclear localization signal, although no DNA binding has been demonstrated for this molecule (26Sells S.F. Han S.S. Muthukkumar S. Maddiwar N. Johnstone R. Boghaert E. Gillis D. Liu G. Nair P. Monnig S. Collini P. Mattson M.P. Sukhatme V.P. Zimmer S.G. Wood Jr., D.P. McRoberts J.W. Shi Y. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell.

Rangnekar V.M. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6945-6956Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). A stretch of 70 amino acids at the COOH terminus of Par-4 shows homology to a region referred to as the death domain, which is also found in other pro-apoptotic proteins such as Fas, FADD, and TNFR-1 (26Sells S.F. Han S.S. Muthukkumar S. Maddiwar N. Johnstone R. Boghaert E. Gillis D. Liu G. Nair P. Monnig S. Collini P. Mattson M.P. Sukhatme V.P. Zimmer S.G. Wood Jr., D.P. McRoberts J.W. Shi Y. Rangnekar V.M.

Par-4 seems to be functionally required but not sufficient for apoptosis (26Sells S.F. Han S.S. Muthukkumar S. Maddiwar N. Johnstone R. Boghaert E. Gillis D. Liu G. Nair P. Monnig S. Collini P.

Expression of this protein was found to be ubiquitous and not restricted to any specific organ (23Boghaert E.R. Sells S.F. Walid A.J. Malone P. Williams N.M. Weinstein M.H. Strange R. Rangnekar V.M.

WT1 is a 52–54-kDa protein that possesses many characteristics of a transcription factor including a glutamine/proline-rich NH2 terminus, a nuclear localization domain, and four Cys2–His2 zinc finger motifs (31Reddy J.C. Licht J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar). Three COOH-terminal zinc fingers share 64% homology to the zinc fingers of the early growth response gene 1 (32Rauscher F.J.D. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 896-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). WT1 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the bcl-2 gene (33Hewitt S.M. Hamada S. McDonnell T.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Saunders G.F.

Par-4 binds to two different domains of WT1 and regulates the transcriptional activation and repression potential of WT1 (27Johnstone R.W. See R.H. Sells S.F. Wang J. Muthukkumar S. Englert C.

In view of the correlation of Bcl-2 overexpression and progression of prostate cancer from androgen dependence to independence, the observation that ectopic expression of Par-4 can decrease Bcl-2 expression and that Par-4 binds to WT1, we set out to examine whether Par-4 utilizes WT1 to bind to the bcl-2 promoter to transcriptionally regulate Bcl-2 expression in an androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line. We report here evidence that Par-4 can transcriptionally modulate Bcl-2 expression by associating with a previously defined WT1-binding site on the bcl-2 P1 promoter. All-trans-Retinoic Acid—All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) has been used previously (37Sundaresan A. Claypool K. Mehta K. Lopez-Berestein G. Cabanillas F. Ford Jr., R.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1071-1082PubMed Google Scholar, 38Hall A.K. Anti-Cancer Drugs. 1996; 7: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) to down-modulate the expression of Bcl-2. Because ATRA is a hydrophobic drug and to prevent its rapid clearance due to enhanced metabolism, we used liposomes to deliver the drug (39Trump D.L. Smith D.C. Stiff D. Adedoyin A. Day R. Bahnson R.R. Hofacker J. Branch R.A. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1997; 39: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). l-ATRA, the liposomal form of ATRA, was prepared in bottles from lyophilized powder in bottles containing ATRA (100 mg) in a 1:15 drug:lipid formulation that consisted of soy oil and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (kindly supplied by Aronex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., The Woodlands, TX, as AtragenR). l-atra was stored in the dark at 4 °C, reconstituted by adding 50 ml of normal saline to each bottle, and vortexed for 2 min immediately before use. Cell Lines, Antibodies, and Reagent—The androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell line LNCaP was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) (40Horoszewicz J.S. Leong S.S. Chu T.M. Wajsman Z.L. Friedman M. Papsidero L. Kim U. Chai L.S. Kakati S. Arya S.K. Sandberg A.A. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1980; 37: 115-132PubMed Google Scholar). The androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cell line LNln3, which is an isogenic derivative of LNCaP, was obtained from Dr. Curtis Pettaway, the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (41Pettaway C.A. Pathak S. Greene G. Ramirez E. Wilson M.R. Killion J.J. Fidler I.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1627-1636PubMed Google Scholar). Dr. Pettaway also provided the LNPro5 cell line, an isogenic derivative of LNCaP derived from the fraction of the cells that have the propensity to stay in the mouse prostate upon orthotopic implantation of LNCaP in nude mice (41Pettaway C.A. Pathak S. Greene G. Ramirez E. Wilson M.R. Killion J.J. Fidler I.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1627-1636PubMed Google Scholar). All cell lines were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics. The following antibodies were used in the immunoblotting experiments: (a) anti-Bcl-2, a mouse monoclonal antibody; (b) anti-Par-4, a rabbit polyclonal antibody; and (c) anti-WT1, a mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The secondary antibody was either anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were purchased from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). Cell Growth Assay—Cell survival was determined using the cell titer MTS/phenazine methosulfate cell proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, log phase growing prostate cancer cells were cultured in flat-bottomed 96-well plates in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum medium overnight. Cells were plated at a density of 2 × 103 per well for LNCaP and LNln3 and incubated with L-atra at concentrations ranging from 1 nm to 10 μm. The effects of L-atra on growth were compared with untreated cells, which were taken to represent 100% growth. The well contents were gently washed, and treatment was added in 100 μl of medium. The number of live cells 96 h thereafter was determined by the uptake of the MTS/phenazine methosulfate dye and measured on a νmax Kinetics microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at A490 nm. For each treatment, triplicates were run, and each experiment was performed three times. Western Blot Analysis—LNCaP and LNln3 cells were plated in T75 flasks and were either treated with L-atra (10 μm) for 96 h or left untreated. Following this, the cells were collected by trypsinization and washed in PBS. Then cell pellets were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) to which 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3.3 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin were added fresh before use. Lysis was carried out at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were collected. Fifty micrograms of protein from each cell line was loaded on precast SDS/Tris/glycine gels (Bio-Rad), and after electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk and blotted with the appropriate primary antibody. Membranes were then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase and developed using the ECL kit according to the manufacturers' protocols. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis—LNCaP and LNln3 cells were cultured in T75 flasks and either treated with 10 μm L-ATRA or left untreated. Cells were collected by trypsinization 96 h after treatment and washed in PBS. Subsequently, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at -20 °C. After removal of the ethanol by centrifugation, cells were incubated with propidium iodide containing RNase A (1 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 15 min. DNA fluorescence of propidium iodide-stained cells was measured by flow cytometric analysis (Coulter Epics Profile, Coulter Corp., Miami, FL). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—LNCaP and LNln3 cells were cultured in 2-chambered Falcon culture slides in the presence or absence of 10 μm all-trans-retinoic acid for 96 h. The cells were fixed for 10 min in methanol:acetone (50:50) at -20 °C. Following permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, the cells were incubated with rabbit anti-Par-4 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) in PBS containing 2% fetal calf serum, overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with anti-rabbit rhodamine antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mounted in anti-bleaching solution, and analyzed by laser confocal microscopy Olympus Fluoview FV500. Real Time Quantitative PCR—Duplicate samples of 1 μl of each cDNA were used as a template. Real time quantitative PCR was performed using the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (PE Applied Biosystems, Wellesley, MA). We used primers and a probe generated by the program Primer Express (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; kindly provided by Dr. Michael Andreeff, the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center). Bcl-2 primers were F (forward) 5′-GAGGAGCTCTTCAGGGACGG-3′ and Bcl-2 R (reverse) 5′-GGTGCCGGTGCAGGTACTCA-3′. TaqMan probe (FAM-labeled 5′-AGGATTGTGGCCTTCTTTGAGTTCGGTG-3′) was added to the PCR mixture to a final concentration of 200 nm. GAPDH primers were F (forward) 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′ and GAPDH R (reverse) 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTC-3′ and GAPDH TaqMan probe fluorescence labeled 5′F 5′-CAAGCTTCCCGTTCTCAGCC-3′ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were used as internal controls. Amplification conditions were as follows: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and then 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. GAPDH was co-amplified with Bcl-2. Northern Blot Analysis—Isolation of total RNA was accomplished using the TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen). The probe for Bcl-2 was generated with the 8.0-kb cDNA fragment from the Bcl-2 expression plasmid p442 (gift from Dr. T. J. McDonnell, the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center) by cutting it with EcoRI. The probe thus generated was random primer-labeled with 32P using the MegaprimeTM DNA-labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). The GAPDH probe has been described previously (11Tsujimoto Y. Finger L.R. Yunis J. Nowell P.C. Croce C.M. Science. 1984; 226: 1097-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar) and was used as a loading control. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed at 62 °C for 30 min overnight. The blot was subjected to low and high stringency washes using the buffers provided in the NorthernMaxTM kit for Northern blots (Ambion Inc.; Austin, TX). Transfection and Generation of Stable Clones Expressing Par-4 — LNln3 prostate cancer cell line was stably transfected with cytomegalovirus Par-4 expression construct expressing the full-length Par-4 using the calcium phosphate method (26Sells S.F.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3823-3832Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Stable clones expressing Par-4 were selected using the G418 antibiotic. The clones were analyzed for Bcl-2 and Par-4 expression by immunoblotting and were analyzed for the transcript of Bcl-2 by Northern blot and quantitative real time PCR. WT1 Antisense—For inhibition of WT1 expression, we used antisense (AS) deoxyoligonucleotides (5′-GTCGGAGCCCATTTGCTG-3′) that were complementary to the region spanning the initiation codon of the human WT1 (42Yamagami T. Sugiyama H. Inoue K. Ogawa H. Tatekawa T. Hirata M. Kudoh T. Akiyama T. Murakami A. Maekawa T. Blood. 1996; 87: 2878-2884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The P-ethoxy-modified oligonucleotide was incorporated into a dioleoylphosphatidylcholine liposome formulation as described previously (43Tari A.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 313: 372-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, LNln3 cells were plated in 6-well plates (1 × 105 per well), and 10 μm antisense was added. Cells treated were harvested after 3 days of WT1 antisense incubation. Expression of Bcl-2 and WT1 proteins was determined by Western blotting. Isolation of Nuclear Proteins Binding to Biotinylated Probes—Oligonucleotides representing the WT1-binding site on the bcl-2 promoter sequence were synthesized, and 5 μg of the sense strand was 3′-labeled using the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Promega) and biotin-14-dATP (Invitrogen) (34Heckman C.

The biotin-labeled sense strand was annealed to its complementary antisense strand and purified over a Sephadex column. The concentration of purified oligonucleotide was measured by absorbance at 260 nm, and equal amounts of annealed oligonucleotide were incubated with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Promega) for 30 min at room temperature. Coupling of the oligonucleotides to the beads was measured by absorbance. For the binding reaction, 50 μg of nuclear extract alone or preincubated with anti-Par-4 antibody (R334) was used. The beads were captured by a magnet, washed three times with a high salt buffer, and resuspended in Laemmli buffer. The samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min to elute all the proteins, loaded onto a 12% SDS-PAGE, electrophoresed, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Par-4 was detected using the Par-4 antibody (R334) by immunoblotting as described earlier. Nuclear Extract Preparation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—The double-stranded oligonucleotides used for EMSA of the WT1 region are shown with the WT1 site underlined and the mutated bases in boldface. The B1 WT1 site in the insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) P3 promoter was used as the positive control (45Werner H. Rauscher III, F.J. Sukhatme V.P. Drummond I.A. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J.

The oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. EMSA reactions (20 μl) contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 3 × 106 cpm of end-labeled oligonucleotide probe, and 10 μg of nuclear extracts. Leupeptin (0.3 mg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (5 mm), and aprotinin (2 μg/ml) were included in all nuclear extract buffers. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Electrophoresis was performed at 30 mA in a 0.5× Tr"

Phospholamban, an endogenous inhibitor of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, plays an important role in Ca2+ cycling in heart. Recently, sarcolipin has been identified as having a similar function as phospholamban in skeletal muscle. Because phospholamban is differentially expressed in atrial and ventricular myocardia and its expression is often altered in diseased hearts, we investigated the cardiac chamber specificity of sarcolipin expression and its regulation during development and hypertrophic remodeling. Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of mouse sarcolipin mRNA was most abundant in the atria and was undetectable in the ventricles, indicating an atrial chamber-specific expression pattern. Atrial chamber-specific expression of sarcolipin mRNA was increased during development. These findings were confirmed by in situhybridization studies. In addition, sarcolipin expression was down-regulated in the atria of hypertrophic heart when induced by ventricular specific overexpression of the activated H-ras gene. In humans, sarcolipin mRNA was also expressed in the atria but not detected in the ventricles, although sarcolipin expression was most abundant in skeletal muscle.

Sarcolipin (SLN) 1The abbreviations used are: SLN, sarcolipin; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; SERCA, SR Ca2 ATPase; PLN, phospholamban; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; ANF, atrial natriuretic factor; BNP, brain natriuretic peptide 1The abbreviations used are: SLN, sarcolipin; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; SERCA, SR Ca2 ATPase; PLN, phospholamban; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; ANF, atrial natriuretic factor; BNP, brain natriuretic peptide is a 31-amino acid proteolipid in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) (1Wawrzynow A. Theibert J.L. Murphy C. Jona I. Martonosi A. Collins J.H. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 620-623Google Scholar) and is shown to be expressed most abundantly in fast twitch skeletal muscle, less abundantly in slow twitch skeletal muscle, and even less in human and rabbit cardiac muscle (2Odermatt A. Taschner P.E. Scherer S.W. Beatty B. Khanna V.K. Cornblath D.R. Chaudhry V. Yee W.C. Schrank B. Karpati G. Breuning M.H. Knoers N. MacLennan D.H. Genomics. 1997; 45: 541-553Google Scholar). This tissue distribution corresponds to that of the fast twitch skeletal muscle SR Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA1), and SLN interacts with SERCA1 to modulate its activity (3Odermatt A. Becker S. Khanna V.K. Kurzydlowski K. Leisner E. Pette D. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12360-12369Google Scholar,4Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26725-26728Google Scholar). By contrast, phospholamban (PLN), an integral membrane protein in the SR, is expressed abundantly in cardiac and slow twitch skeletal muscle wherein SERCA2a is the predominant SERCA isoform (5Tada M. Toyofuku T. J. Card. Fail. 1996; 2 Suppl. 4: S77-S85Google Scholar). Thus, SLN expression is complementary to PLN expression. The structure and protein sequence of SLN are similar to those of PLN (2Odermatt A. Taschner P.E. Scherer S.W. Beatty B. Khanna V.K. Cornblath D.R. Chaudhry V. Yee W.C. Schrank B. Karpati G. Breuning M.H. Knoers N. MacLennan D.H. Genomics. 1997; 45: 541-553Google Scholar). Therefore, SLN and PLN may belong to the same family, and SLN is likely to be an analog of PLN in skeletal muscle. PLN is an endogenous inhibitor of SERCA2 and plays a central role in regulating cardiac contractility and relaxation (6Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Google Scholar, 7Koss K.L. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1059-1063Google Scholar). Studies using gene-targeted mice have revealed that disruption of the PLN gene can prevent the progression of cardiomyopathy (8Minamisawa S. Hoshijima M. Chu G. Ward C.A. Frank K. Gu Y. Martone M.E. Wang Y. Ross Jr., J. Kranias E.G. Giles W.R. Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 313-322Google Scholar, 9Sato Y. Kiriazis H. Yatani A. Schmidt A.G. Hahn H. Ferguson D.G. Sako H. Mitarai S. Honda R. Mesnard-Rouiller L. Frank K.F. Beyermann B. Wu G. Fujimori K. Dorn II, G.W. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9392-9399Google Scholar), suggesting that PLN plays a critical role in the development of heart failure. The expression of PLN is regulated by developmental, hormonal, and hemodynamic changes (7Koss K.L. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1059-1063Google Scholar). In the heart, PLN is expressed predominantly in the ventricles and, to a lesser extent, in the atria (10Koss K.L. Ponniah S. Jones W.K. Grupp I.L. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 342-353Google Scholar). The different levels of PLN expression in the heart are, in part, responsible for the differences in the contractile properties between the atria and the ventricles. In contrast to PLN, the role of SLN in the heart remains unknown, even though SLN may play an important role in skeletal muscle contraction (11Tupling A.R. Asahi M. MacLennan D.H. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44740-44746Google Scholar). Because SLN expression is complementary to PLN expression, we hypothesize that SLN expression in the heart is higher in the atria and is regulated in a developmental stage-specific manner and/or by cardiac stress. In addition, Asahi et al. (4Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26725-26728Google Scholar) demonstrated recently that SLN inhibited polymerization of PLN, resulting in the superinhibition of SERCA1 and SERCA2a. Therefore, characterizing the expression pattern of SLN is important for establishing the potential modulatory role in cardiac function. In the present study, we examined the effects of development and cardiac hypertrophy on the expression of SLN mRNA in heart. We found that the expression of SLN mRNA was detected selectively in the atria. Furthermore, SLN was up-regulated during development and down-regulated by cardiac hypertrophy. SLN mRNA remained undetectable in the ventricles during development or in the hypertrophic state, indicating that the atrial chamber-specificity of SLN was conserved. Taken together, we propose that SLN may serve an important regulator of Ca2+ cycling in the atrium and may be an important factor in differentiating the contractile properties of the atria from those of the ventricles. ICR mice obtained from Clea Japan Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) were inbred at Tokyo Women's Medical University. Embryos from ICR mice were obtained from timed pregnant animals. The transgenic model of cardiac hypertrophy was established by ventricular specific expression of activated H-rastransgene. In this study, we applied the same “gene-switch” transgenic strategy as reported previously (12Liao P. Georgakopoulos D. Kovacs A. Zheng M. Lerner D. Pu H. Saffitz J. Chien K. Xiao R.P. Kass D.A. Wang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12283-12288Google Scholar). Briefly, a green fluorescence protein (GFP) coding sequence and poly(A) regions were cloned from pEGFP-N1 (Invitrogen) and inserted between the two loxP sequences of the pUC1015loxlox vector (a gift from Dr. Jamy Marth, University of California, San Diego, CA) to generate the pfloxGFP vector. The XbaI/SmaI fragment from pfloxGFP, containing the GFP-poly(A) sequences flanked by two copies of loxP, was then inserted at the HindIII site of the pMHC vector behind the 5.5 kilobase mouse α-MHC promoter (a gift from Dr. Jeffery Robbins, University of Cincinnati) to generate the pMHC-floxGFP vector. The cDNA fragment coding for the activated H-ras (V15) mutant was then inserted at the EcoRV site behind the loxP-GFP-loxP fragment to generate the final pMHC-floxRas vector. Transgenic mice (floxRas) were generated by established intra-nuclear injection methods using aKpnI/SstI fragment digested from the pMHC-floxRas vector. The GFP marker gene was expressed in both the atria and ventricles. The floxRas mice were crossed with MLC-2v/Cre mice in which the Cre enzyme was only expressed in the ventricular muscle cells. The GFP expression cassette was floxed out, and the activated H-ras mutant was led to be expressed in the ventricles of double transgenic mice. The effect of the H-ras mutant on cardiac hypertrophy has been validated (13Hunter J.J. Tanaka N. Rockman H.A. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23173-23178Google Scholar). Human tissues were obtained from specimens at autopsy. Informed consent was obtained from the patients and/or their families. Total RNA was isolated from various tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. For the developmental study, atrial and left ventricular tissues from embryos and neonates were pooled. The isolated RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry. To obtain the mouse and human full-length SLN cDNAs and mouse partial-length SERCA1 cDNA, a set of primers was designed based on the reported sequence (Table I). The mouse SERCA1 cDNA included the end of the coding sequence and 3′-untranslated region. Reverse transcription PCR was performed using the Superscript preamplification system (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. The reaction of PCR was set to denature at 94 °C for 30 s, anneal at 55 °C for 30 s, and extend at 72 °C for 45 s for 30 cycles. The obtained PCR fragments were subcloned in pCR II vector (Invitrogen). The antisense mouse SLN digoxygenin-labeled RNA probe was created from 1 μg of HindIII-linearized mouse SLN pCRII vector using T3 RNA polymerase.Table IPrimersGeneEMBL/GenBank™ accession numberForwardReverseSize of PCR productMouse SLNNM_0255405′-CTGAGGTCCTTGGTAGCCTG-3′5′-GGTGTGTCAGGCATTGTGAG-3′331-bpHuman SLNU960945′-GAGGTGAGGACAAGCCAGAG-3′5′-GTCTCAGGGCATAGAGCAGG-3′237-bpMouse SERCA1NM_0075045′-TGCTCGGAACTATCTGGAGG-3′5′-GAGTTCGGGAAGGGGATTTA-3′258-bp Open table in a new tab Mouse SERCA2a and PLN cDNA probes were kindly provided by Dr. Wolfgang H. Dillmann (University of California, San Diego, CA) and Dr. Evangelia G. Kranias (University of Cincinnati College of Medicine), respectively. We confirmed the nucleotide sequences of these probes compared with the reported sequences by direct DNA sequencing. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously with modification (14Minamisawa S. Gu Y. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10066-10070Google Scholar). Total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred onto Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Blots were hybridized at 68 °C with radiolabeled probes in Quickhyb solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as recommended by the manufacturer. Membranes were washed under high stringency conditions (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 60 °C. In situhybridization was performed as described previously (15Machida S. Matsuoka R. Noda S. Hiratsuka E. Takagaki Y. Oana S. Furutani Y. Nakajima H. Takao A. Momma K. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 217: 37-49Google Scholar). Paraffin sections were prepared using a standard protocol. Microsomes enriched in SR membranes were obtained as described previously (16Edes I. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 394-400Google Scholar). SR Ca2+ ATPase activity was measured as described previously with modification (17Nakanishi T. Jarmakani J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: H61-H625Google Scholar). Using 5 μg of SR protein, the reaction was carried out at 37 °C in the reaction medium containing 30 mm TES, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm NaN3, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 4 mm ATP with or without 0.5 CaCl2. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was analyzed using Student's unpairedt test. The distribution of SLN mRNA in various mouse tissues was analyzed by Northern blot using a PCR-amplified cDNA probe as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A single 0.9-kb transcript was detected. Specifically, SLN mRNA expression was most abundant in the atria of the heart, less abundant in esophageal muscle, and least abundant in skeletal muscle and bladder (Fig.1 A). In murine myocardium, the expression of SLN mRNA was restricted to the atria and was not present in the ventricles. In skeletal muscle, the similar level of SLN mRNA expression was detected in fast twitch skeletal muscle (extensor digitorum longus muscle) and slow twitch skeletal muscle (soleus muscle). In smooth muscle, SLN mRNA expression was much greater in esophagus than in bladder. SLN mRNA was not detected in brain, kidney, liver, spleen, thymus, and lung (liver, spleen, thymus, and lung, data not shown) by Northern blot analysis. In situ hybridization analysis using an antisense SLN RNA probe also demonstrated that SLN mRNA was expressed only in the atria and not in the ventricles of the heart (Fig. 1 B). The localization of SLN transcript was distributed uniformly in both right and left atria. We also examined the expression of SERCA1 mRNA in the mouse heart, because SLN is believed to interact with SERCA1. As shown in Fig.1 A, a very small amount of the SERCA1 transcript was detected in the atria. The level of SERCA2 mRNA in the atria was comparable with that in the ventricles. At the protein level, only SERCA2a but not SERCA1 was detected in the atria, using SERCA isoform-specific antibodies (data not shown; SERCA1 antibody (MA3–912) and SERCA2 antibody (MA3–919) were from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.). There was abundant SERCA1 expression in mouse smooth muscle. SERCA1 mRNA levels were similar in esophagus and bladder. The tissue distribution of PLN and SERCA2a was consistent with previous reports (18Grover A.K. Khan I. Cell Calcium. 1992; 13: 9-17Google Scholar, 19Tada M. Yabuki M. Toyofuku T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 116-129Google Scholar). SR Ca2+ ATPase activity in the atria (n = 5) was significantly higher than that in the ventricles (n = 7) (1573 ± 85 nmol/mg of protein/min and 348 ± 35 nmol/mg of protein/min, respectively) in adult murine hearts. The developmental changes of SLN and SERCA1 mRNA in the atria were also determined by Northern blot analysis. Fig.2 A demonstrates that the expression of SLN and SERCA1 mRNA was increased over time in the atria and not detected in the ventricles at any of the developmental stages. Interestingly, the expression of SERCA1 mRNA became very low in the atria in older mice (2 years old), suggesting that SERCA1 expression is down-regulated in the atria with aging. The expression of ANF transcript was also increased over time in the atria. In contrast to SLN, ANF transcripts were detected in the ventricles of embryos at embryonic day 17.5 and at 2 years old of age. We further examined the developmental changes of SLN and SERCA1 mRNA expression in detail. No SLN transcript was found in embryos at embryonic day 10.5 but became detectable in the atria at embryonic day 12.5 (Fig. 2 B). After embryonic day 16.5, the expression of SLN mRNA was abruptly increased in the atria. These changes were confirmed by in situ hybridization studies using embryos at specific developmental stages. At embryonic day 9.5 no SLN transcript was detected (data not shown), whereas at embryonic day 12.5 SLN mRNA was present at a low level in the atria and expressed abundantly in the progenitors of skeletal muscle (Fig. 3).Figure 3In situ hybridization analysis of sarcolipin mRNA in an embryo at embryonic day 12.5.

The SERCA1 transcript was detected again at 21 days after birth. Thus, the developmental changes in SLN and SERCA1 transcripts were not exactly coordinated. The transgenic mice overexpressing activated H-ras developed severe concentric ventricular hypertrophy with concomitant obstruction of forward blood flow from the atria to the ventricles, resulting in marked enlargement of atrial chambers (Fig. 4). The levels of SLN, PLN, SERCA1 and SERCA2a mRNA were all decreased in the atria of the transgenic mice at 3 months old (Fig. 5). Although ANF and BNP transcripts were increased in both the atria and ventricles of the transgenic mice, SLN mRNA remained undetectable in the hypertrophic ventricles.Figure 5Down-regulation of sarcolipin and SERCA1 mRNA in H-ras transgenic mice.

We found that SLN mRNA was expressed abundantly in human atria and was undetectable in ventricles (Fig.6). In contrast to mouse, the expression of SLN in the atria was lower than in skeletal muscle in human. Using the mouse SERCA1 cDNA probe that has 75% homology with human SERCA1, no hybridization signal was detected in the human atria, even under low stringent conditions. The present study revealed that SLN mRNA was expressed abundantly in the murine and human atria but was not detected in the murine and human ventricles by Northern blot analysis. In mice, the expression of SLN mRNA was most abundant in the atria, and it was lower in skeletal muscle than in the atria and smooth muscle. By contrast, in humans the expression of SLN mRNA was weaker in the atria than that in skeletal muscle. Previous studies have demonstrated the predominant expression of SLN mRNA in human and rabbit fast skeletal muscle (2Odermatt A. Taschner P.E. Scherer S.W. Beatty B. Khanna V.K. Cornblath D.R. Chaudhry V. Yee W.C. Schrank B. Karpati G. Breuning M.H. Knoers N. MacLennan D.H. Genomics. 1997; 45: 541-553Google Scholar) and the very weak expression of SLN mRNA in rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle (20Gayan-Ramirez G. Vanzeir L. Wuytack F. Decramer M. J. Physiol. 2000; 524: 387-397Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the findings in the present study, suggesting that the tissue distribution of sarcolipin mRNA is regulated differently between humans and rodents. The fact that the nucleotide sequence of SLN cDNA is not well conserved between mice and humans and that their polyadenylation signal sequences are different (2Odermatt A. Taschner P.E. Scherer S.W. Beatty B. Khanna V.K. Cornblath D.R. Chaudhry V. Yee W.C. Schrank B. Karpati G. Breuning M.H. Knoers N. MacLennan D.H. Genomics. 1997; 45: 541-553Google Scholar) may account for the different tissue distribution between rodents and humans. Importantly, the atrial chamber-specific expression of SLN was developmentally up-regulated, and it was down-regulated in hypertrophic remodeling at the transcriptional level. These changes are similar to those of PLN in the ventricles (21Ganim J.R. Luo W. Ponniah S. Grupp I. Kim H.W. Ferguson D.G. Kadambi V. Neumann J.C. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 1021-1030Google Scholar) (22Moorman A.F. Vermeulen J.L. Koban M.U. Schwartz K. Lamers W.H. Boheler K.R. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 616-625Google Scholar). No ventricular SLN expression was detected at any stage of development or cardiac hypertrophy. We did not investigate the protein levels of SLN, because a SLN antibody was not readily available. However, a previous study (2Odermatt A. Taschner P.E. Scherer S.W. Beatty B. Khanna V.K. Cornblath D.R. Chaudhry V. Yee W.C. Schrank B. Karpati G. Breuning M.H. Knoers N. MacLennan D.H. Genomics. 1997; 45: 541-553Google Scholar) demonstrated that changes in the SLN levels of mRNA and protein are proportional, although the magnitude of the changes in SLN protein was greater than that in SLN mRNA in the skeletal muscle. Therefore, it is likely that the SLN protein is also expressed abundantly in the murine atria. PLN decreases the apparent affinity of SERCA2a for Ca2+ and inhibits Ca2+ uptake into the SR. The expression level of PLN directly affects cardiac contractility and relaxation in the heart (23Luo W. Wolska B.M. Grupp I.L. Harrer J.M. Haghighi K. Ferguson D.G. Slack J.P. Grupp G. Doetschman T. Solaro R.J. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 839-847Google Scholar, 24Dash R. Kadambi V. Schmidt A.G. Tepe N.M. Biniakiewicz D. Gerst M.J. Canning A.M. Abraham W.T. Hoit B.D. Liggett S.B. Lorenz J.N. Dorn II, G.W. Kranias E.G. Circulation. 2001; 103: 889-896Google Scholar). SLN also inhibits Ca2+ uptake at low Ca2+ concentrations like PLN but enhances Ca2+uptake at high Ca2+ concentrations (3Odermatt A. Becker S. Khanna V.K. Kurzydlowski K. Leisner E. Pette D. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12360-12369Google Scholar, 25Mascioni A. Karim C. Barany G. Thomas D.D. Veglia G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 475-482Google Scholar). Therefore, the atrial chamber-specific expression of SLN may be related to functional differences between the atria and ventricles, and the abundant expression of SLN may play an important role in the regulation of Ca2+ cycling in the atrial myocardium. The coordinated contraction of the atria with the ventricles is essential for normal cardiac output. However, the physiological characteristics are quite different between atrial and ventricular myocardium. For examples, muscle contraction time, measured as a time to peak tension, and the duration of the myocyte Ca2+transients are shorter in atrial muscle compared with ventricular muscle. In the present study, we also found that SR Ca2+ATPase activity is significantly higher in the atria than in the ventricles. This may be due to different levels of PLN expression between atria and ventricles (10Koss K.L. Ponniah S. Jones W.K. Grupp I.L. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 342-353Google Scholar). In addition to the lower expression of PLN, SLN may also contribute to the chamber-specific physiological properties of the atria. Furthermore, we found that SERCA1 mRNA was expressed weakly in the mouse atria and that its expression was also regulated during development and hypertrophic remodeling. However, it is unlikely that SERCA1 contributes to the higher ATPase activity in the atria, because SERCA2a is the predominant isoform, and the SERCA1 protein was not detected in the atria. In skeletal muscle, SLN expression is regulated by chronic low frequency stimulation (3Odermatt A. Becker S. Khanna V.K. Kurzydlowski K. Leisner E. Pette D. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12360-12369Google Scholar) or corticosteroids (20Gayan-Ramirez G. Vanzeir L. Wuytack F. Decramer M. J. Physiol. 2000; 524: 387-397Google Scholar). Odermatt et al. (3Odermatt A. Becker S. Khanna V.K. Kurzydlowski K. Leisner E. Pette D. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12360-12369Google Scholar) suggested that reduced SLN expression associated with the decrease in SERCA1 activity represented an early functional adaptation to chronic low frequency stimulation. They proposed that SLN provides a constant stimulation of SERCA V max to increase the activity of SERCA. Thus, the abundant expression of SLN with an increase in the activity of SERCA and faster contraction in the atria is consistent with this model. However, these investigators demonstrated recently that SLN inhibited both SERCA1 and SERCA2a activities in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (4Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26725-26728Google Scholar) and in in vivo slow skeletal muscle (11Tupling A.R. Asahi M. MacLennan D.H. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44740-44746Google Scholar). Moreover, they suggested that SLN binds directly to PLN and increases the formation of PLN monomers that inhibits SERCA activity (4Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26725-26728Google Scholar). If these data are true in the in vivo heart, overexpression of SLN should result in the depression of SERCA activity and slow muscle contraction. Further studies using transgenic mice overexpressing SLN in heart are needed to address these issues. Using a Ras transgenic mouse model for hypertrophy, we demonstrated that SLN mRNA was down-regulated in cardiac hypertrophy. Isolated cardiomyocytes from Ras transgenic mice displayed reduced contraction and prolonged Ca2+ transients compared with wild-type myocytes 2S. Miamisawa, Y. Wang, and K. R. Chen, unpublished observations. despite the reduction of PLN expression. Other studies also demonstrated that Ca2+ cycling in the atria is impaired in cardiac hypertrophy or chronic atrial stimulation such as atrial fibrillation. Therefore, decreases in the expression of SLN, SERCA1, and SERCA2 may result in the reduction of Ca2+ uptake in the atria and may play a more important role in maintaining the atrial function than the level of PLN expression. Another important finding in the present study is that SLN mRNA was not expressed in the ventricular myocardium during any stage of development or in a cardiac hypertrophic state, indicating that SLN is an atrial chamber-specific molecular marker. In contrast to SLN, other atrial chamber-specific molecular markers such as ANF and atrial type of myosin light chain 1 are induced in ventricles by cardiac stresses. Therefore, a putative promoter/enhancer gene fragment of SLN may be useful for atrial chamber-specific gene targeting or gene delivery. In conclusion, we found that SLN, a counterpart of PLN, was expressed specifically in the atrial myocardium. The atrial chamber-specific expression of SLN was up-regulated during development and down-regulated in hypertrophic remodeling. The present study suggests that SLN is an important regulator of Ca2+ cycling in the atrium.

Aऔ is produced via औ- and γ-secretases, proteases that have become important therapeutic targets for AD (1Wolfe M.S. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 2039-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase plays a crucial role in determining the proportion of two forms of Aऔ, Aऔ40 and Aऔ42. The 42-residue Aऔ42 is more prone to fibril formation and is disproportionately present in the plaques characteristic of the AD brain. Accumulating evidence (2Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L.

Three other multipass membrane proteins, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, are genetically linked to γ-secretase activity (5Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L. Tandon A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E.

Despite the remarkable progress in uncovering the identity of γ-secretase, its mechanism of action remains unclear. A body of work (11Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 296: 2156-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) suggests that γ-secretase cleaves amide bonds within the transmembrane regions of its substrates, a poorly understood process of hydrolysis within a hydrophobic environment. Elucidating the molecular interaction between an inhibitor and its enzyme target can help identify the enzyme and provide insight into the catalytic mechanism. The study of peptidomimetic inhibitors of γ-secretase that contain classic aspartyl protease transition state-mimicking moieties led to the suggestion that γ-secretase is an aspartyl protease and that two conserved aspartates in presenilins are catalytic residues (12Wolfe M.S. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5413-5416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). PS is processed into N-terminal (NTF) and C-terminal (CTF) fragments. These fragments are metabolically stable, remain associated, and their formation is tightly regulated, suggesting that together they are the bioactive form of PS (12Wolfe M.S. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5413-5416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The direct binding of transition state analog γ-secretase inhibitors to these fragments strongly suggests that the active site is at the NTF/CTF heterodimeric interface (3Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Moore C.L. Tsai J.-Y. Rahmati T. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 4Li Y.M. Xu M. Lai M.T. Huang Q. Castro J.L. DiMuzio-Mower J. Harrison T. et al.Nature. 2000; 405: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), consistent with the fact that each subunit contributes one of the two critical aspartates (2Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). The recent discovery of structurally diverse inhibitors suggests that these new compounds may also be important molecular probes for the protease complex. Several non-transition state analog inhibitors are very potent; however, unlike transition state analogs, their site(s) of interaction within the γ-secretase complex is unclear. To probe the mechanism of γ-secretase inhibitor action, we studied the ability of structurally diverse compounds to displace a transition state-based photoactive molecule from its target, the γ-secretase active site at the PS1 NTF/CTF interface. Differential effects of these compounds suggest that they inhibit γ-secretase by distinct mechanisms and are thus important new probes to elucidate the workings of this complex protease. Moreover, the ability of a transition state analog inhibitor of signal peptide peptidase (SPP), a multipass membrane aspartyl protease with presenilin-like motifs (13Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K.

Photoprobe III-63 and analog III-31-C were prepared using methods described previously (8Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Diehl T.S. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

BocLys(Cbz)Ile-Leu-epoxide was synthesized using a procedure similar to the one reported before (18McLendon C. Xin T. Ziani-Cherif C. Murphy M.P. Findlay K. Lewis P. Pinnix I. Sambamurti K. Wang R.

Alld-peptide Boc-d-Val-Gly-α-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib)-d-Val-d-Val-d-Ile-Aib-d-Thr(O-benzyl)-d-Val-Aib-OMe (d-294) was prepared by solution-phase peptide synthesis using d-amino acids and the achiral Aib. SPP inhibitor (Z-ll)2-ketone was purchased fromCalbiochem. All compounds were dissolved in Me2SO to make stock solutions. Inhibition of Aऔ production in cells and measurement by sandwich ELISA were performed as described previously (19Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Moore C.L. Leatherwood D.D. Ostaszewski B. Donkor I.O. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4720-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The cell-free assay was performed as reported previously (8Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Diehl T.S.

IC50 values were estimated by plotting the ELISA data on SigmaPlot and fitting it to a sigmoidal function. HeLa cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 17 CHAPSO, and protease inhibitors. The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g, and the supernatant was spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The final supernatant was diluted with PIPES buffer (50 mmPIPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2) to a final 0.257 CHAPSO solution. The photolabeling was performed essentially as described previously (4Li Y.M. Xu M. Lai M.T. Huang Q. Castro J.L. DiMuzio-Mower J. Harrison T. et al.Nature. 2000; 405: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), only the labeled proteins were released from streptavidin beads with 8 m guanidinium hydrochloride, pH 2.3. The solvent was then exchanged to phosphate-buffered saline by using Microcone centrifugation tubes. The labeled proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using antibody AB14 to the PS1 N terminus and antibody 4627 to the PS1 C terminus and with anti-biotin antibody to the biotinylated species. The concentration of the competitor was 25 times the cell-free IC50 for active compounds or at a maximum of 200 ॖm for compounds inactive in the cell-free assay. To fully characterize the inhibitors used in this study and to provide consistency in the data analysis, we evaluated the inhibitory potency of each compound in our cell-based and cell-free assays. The ability of inhibitors to decrease Aऔ production in cell culture was tested in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with human APP. The IC50 values are reported below for each compound, and all values are summarized in Table I. In cell-free assays CHAPSO-solubilized HeLa cell membrane preparations were used to evaluate the ability of inhibitors to reduce γ-secretase proteolysis of recombinant APP-based substrate (Fig.1).Table IChemical structures, inhibition properties, and the displacement ability of the γ-secretase inhibitors used in the studyIn cells IC50 values for inhibition of Aऔ production were determined using Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing human APP751.

Displacement indicates the ability of the inhibitor to prevent the transition state-based photolabel from binding to PS1 heterodimer (see Fig. 3). We have developed and optimized the labeling of PS1 with a derivative of a highly potent aspartyl protease transition state analog inhibitor of γ-secretase, called III-31-C, a (hydroxyethyl)urea peptidomimetic (8Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Diehl T.S. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). III-31-C inhibits Aऔ production with an IC50 of 10 nm in the cell-free γ-secretase assay and 200 nm in APP-transfected cells. We modified this compound with a photoactivatable benzophenone and with biotin at the C terminus of the molecule (20Micchelli C.A. Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Jack C. Berezovska O. Kornilova A. Hyman B.T. Perrimon N. Wolfe M.S. FASEB J. 2002; 17: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The derivatized molecule, called III-63, exhibited an in vitroIC50 value similar to the parent compound, indicating that the modifications did not affect the ability of the compound to bind the γ-secretase active site. Compound III-63 was used for photolabeling of PS1 under in vitro conditions that preserve γ-secretase activity. We used lysates as well as microsomes isolated from HeLa cells by lysing and/or solubilizing with the detergent CHAPSO (21Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The labeled species were precipitated with streptavidin beads and analyzed by Western blot, detecting with anti-PS1 antibodies. The observed biotinylated proteins, a major band at about 21 kDa and a minor band at about 31 kDa, were identified as PS1 CTF and PS1 NTF, respectively (Fig.2, lane 1). These results strongly suggest that the III-63 photolabel directly binds to the interface of PS1 heterodimers. This observation is essentially the same as seen by Li et al. (4Li Y.M. Xu M. Lai M.T. Huang Q. Castro J.L. DiMuzio-Mower J. Harrison T. et al.Nature. 2000; 405: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), who used a nearly identical photoprobe and labeled the CTF of PS1 exclusively. Apparently, our closely related compound can also label small amounts of NTF. When the unbiotinylated parent compound III-31-C (250 nm) was used as a competitor, no labeled PS1 NTF and PS1 CTF species were detected (Fig. 2, lane 2). No labeled proteins were detected when irradiation was not applied (data not shown). These observations demonstrated specific labeling of PS1 heterodimers by III-63. This direct photoprobe binding provided a means of assessing the mechanism of structurally diverse γ-secretase inhibitors by testing the ability of these inhibitors to displace the photoprobe from its molecular target. All subsequent competition experiments were performed in cell lysates, because this method requires smaller amounts of initial cellular material, but yields similar results. We used competitor concentrations equal to 25 times their IC50 value in vitro. The latter was chosen to compare the degree of displacement with the positive control of displacement by III-31-C at such a concentration (250 nm, 25 times above the 10 nmIC50 value). Several reported inhibitors were identified from small molecule library screening and subsequent optimization, but the means by which they inhibit the protease are unclear. For example, the dipeptide DAPT (Table I) is a non-transition state analog, but nevertheless a very potent inhibitor, that substantially decreased Aऔ levels in the brains of APP transgenic mice (16Dovey H.F. John V. Anderson J.P. Chen L.Z. de Saint Andrieu P. Fang L.Y. et al.J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In our hands, this compound inhibited Aऔ production with an IC50 of 10 nm in the cell-free γ-secretase assay and with an IC50 of 20 nm in APP-transfected cells. After addition of DAPT as a competitor to photoprobe III-63, somewhat less biotinylated species were observed at a competitor concentration of 250 nm (25 times the cell-free IC50), and much less labeled species were detected when 2 ॖm DAPT (200 times the IC50) was used (Fig. 3A). This observation that DAPT prevents labeling with a transition state analog affinity reagent suggests that DAPT either directly binds to the active site between PS1 heterodimers or alters it through an allosteric interaction (20Micchelli C.A. Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Jack C. Berezovska O. Kornilova A. Hyman B.T. Perrimon N. Wolfe M.S. FASEB J. 2002; 17: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Interestingly, DAPT does not displace the photoprobe as well as III-31-C does at the same relative concentration (25 times the IC50), despite being essentially equivalent inhibitors in the solubilized γ-secretase assay. This intriguing observation suggests that transition state analog III-31-C and non-transition state analog DAPT act at partially, but not completely, overlapping sites. Similar results were obtained with Compound E, a non-transition state analog inhibitor containing a benzodiazepine moiety. In our assays, this compound inhibited Aऔ production with an IC50 of 3 nm in microsomes and with an IC50 of 0.3 nm in APP-transfected cells. After addition of Compound E as a competitor to photoprobe, the level of labeled species was reduced somewhat (Fig. 3A) at a competitor concentration of 75 nm (25 times the IC50), and almost no labeled species were detected when 600 nm (200 times the IC50) Compound E was used. Isocoumarin “JLK” compounds (Table I) reported by Petit et al. (15Petit A. Bihel F. Alves da Costa C. Pourquie O. Checler F. Kraus J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) were also examined in the displacement assay. These compounds were reported to inhibit Aऔ production in cells without affecting proteolysis of the Notch receptor. The Notch signaling pathway is involved in cell fate decisions, and presenilins are linked to proteolysis of the transmembrane region of the Notch receptor as a key step in the signaling mechanism (22Esler W.P. Wolfe M.S. Science. 2001; 293: 1449-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). As we reported previously (23Esler W.P. Das C. Campbell W.A. Kimberly W.T. Kornilova A.Y. Diehl T.S. Ye W. Ostaszewski B.L. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E110-E111Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we confirmed that JLK compounds lower Aऔ production in cell culture with an IC50 of 80 ॖm; however, the isocoumarins failed to block γ-secretase activity in our cell-free assays. Moreover, we observed no change in the degree of PS1 heterodimers labeling by the photoprobe (Fig. 3B) when the most active analogs, JLK2 and JLK6, were used as the competitors at concentrations as high as 0.5 mm. This observation indicates that JLKs fail to block the interaction of III-63 with its molecular target, suggesting that these compounds are not likely interacting with or otherwise affecting the active site of γ-secretase. Taken together, our evidence implies that the isocoumarins probably work upstream of γ-secretase. We also examined APP-based peptides designed to assume a helical conformation and mimic the APP transmembrane domain upon initial interaction with γ-secretase. Thus, these compounds were designed to inhibit the protease by a different mechanism than transition-state analogs do. Specifically, these peptides are based on the sequence of the APP transmembrane domain, modified with the helix promoting residue Aib. One of the most potent helical peptides, d-294 (Table I), displays IC50 values of 3 ॖm in cells and 100 nm in the in vitro assay (Fig. 1). When this peptide was run as a competitor to the photoprobe at concentrations as high as 6 ॖm (60 times IC50), it did not affect the photoprobe binding to PS1 heterodimers (Fig.3B). When d-294 was used at 100 ॖm(1000 times IC50), little or no change in the degree of labeling was observed (data not shown). Therefore, despite the fact that this helical peptide directly inhibits γ-secretase activity, it does not interact with or otherwise affect the active site. These observations are consistent with the helical peptide inhibitor competing with the substrate for a separate initial docking site (8Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Diehl T.S. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Another class of γ-secretase inhibitor with a distinct structure are epoxide-containing molecules. A number of small epoxide molecules have been identified as irreversible inhibitors of aspartyl proteases that act by alkylating the catalytic aspartates (24Yu Z. Caldera P. McPhee F. De Voss J.J. Jones P.R. Burlingame A. Kuntz I.D. Craik C.S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5846-5856Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). One such molecule (18McLendon C. Xin T. Ziani-Cherif C. Murphy M.P. Findlay K. Lewis P. Pinnix I. Sambamurti K. Wang R. Fauq A. Golde T.E. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2383-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was reported by Golde et al. to be an inhibitor of γ-secretase, an unconventional aspartyl protease. We synthesized a similar epoxide (Table I) and analyzed its inhibitory properties toward γ-secretase. This epoxide inhibited γ-secretase activity in the cell-based assay (IC50 of 20 ॖΜ) and in the cell-free assay (IC50 of 20 ॖm) (Fig. 1). When tested in the displacement assay under standard conditions, it did not prevent the photoprobe from binding to the active site (Fig. 3C). However, when the epoxide was pre-incubated with lysate for 2 h before the addition of photoprobe and irradiation, much less photolabeling was observed. Such time-dependent displacement was not observed with compound III-31-C. This result suggests that the epoxide is a mechanism-based inhibitor, inactivating γ-secretase by irreversible binding to the active site. Finally, we tested (Z-ll)2-ketone (Table I), an aspartyl protease transition state analog inhibitor of SPP, which is a recently discovered presenilin-like aspartyl protease (13Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). We found this compound to be only moderately active in the γ-secretase cell-free assay, with an IC50 value of 30 ॖm(Fig. 1). The (Z-ll)2-ketone similarly inhibited the formation of the other (FLAG-tagged) proteolytic product generated in this assay (data not shown). When tested in the displacement assay, 200 ॖm(Z-ll)2-ketone (only seven times IC50) completely prevented the photoprobe from binding (Fig. 3D), suggesting that it successfully competes for the active site. Thus, this SPP inhibitor directly affects γ-secretase activity by binding to or allosterically altering the catalytic site. This finding indicates that the topographies of the SPP and presenilin active sites share similarities. The use of a photoactivatable probe directed to the active site of γ-secretase provides a convenient means to probe the inhibitory mechanism of action of structurally diverse molecules. Such studies are particularly important in this case, because γ-secretase is a multicomponent membrane protease that has eluded purification and is unlikely to be crystallized in the near future. Certain small organic inhibitors (e.g. transition state analogs) of this enzyme have served as important mechanistic probes, and the more recently identified agents will likely do so as well. By analyzing the ability of structurally different γ-secretase inhibitors to displace the active site-directed photoprobe from its target, we show here that not all inhibitors act by means of binding or altering the protease active site. Indeed, different γ-secretase inhibitors fell into different mechanistic classes, summarized in Table I. Most γ-secretase inhibitors interfered with the ability of the photoprobe to bind PS1, indicating that these compounds either bind directly to the active site or alter the active site through an allosteric interaction. Importantly, some non-transition state analogs, namely DAPT and Compound E, are very potent in vitro and successfully compete for the active site in the displacement assay. However, these non-transition state analogs do not displace the photoprobe as well as the transition state analog III-31-C does at a comparable concentration. Such behavior suggests that these non-transition state analogs bind at a site overlapping with that of transition state mimics. Some reported γ-secretase inhibitors, the isocoumarins and the Aib-containing helical peptides, failed to displace the photoprobe from the active site, demonstrating that these compounds do not block Aऔ production by affecting the active site of the protease. However, these two types of compounds apparently do not share the same mechanism. Unlike the Aib-containing helical peptide d-294, the isocoumarins are not active in the solubilized enzyme assay, indicating that these inhibitors probably do not target γ-secretase directly. In contrast, helical peptide d-294 does inhibit Aऔ production in the cell-free assay but does not compete with the photoaffinity probe, suggesting that d-294 acts directly on γ-secretase, but not at the active site. Overall, these findings show that there are apparently several distinct mechanisms for inhibiting γ-secretase. These studies do not distinguish between compounds that bind to the active site and those that allosterically alter it. To gain insight into interaction specifics, each inhibitor class should be modified with a photoactive or chemically reactive moiety to identify its direct target(s). Such studies should also provide additional characterization of the initial substrate binding site of γ-secretase. Recently, Greenberg and co-workers (25Tian G. Sobotka-Briner C.D. Zysk J. Liu X. Birr C. Sylvester M.A. Edwards P.D. Scott C.D. Greenberg B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31499-31505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) reported that a number of γ-secretase inhibitors of diverse structures show non-competitive inhibitory kinetics. This finding suggested the existence of another substrate binding site (i.e. for initial docking) besides the active site, which is consistent with other evidence from our laboratory (8Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Diehl T.S. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). It is possible that the initial binding site may be a target of the helical peptide inhibitors (e.g.d-294), which do not affect the active site. Inhibitors that target the initial substrate docking site may be selective for different γ-secretase substrates, if different substrates do not share the same initial binding site. These future mechanistic studies may uncover the possibility of finding γ-secretase inhibitors selective for APP over other substrates such as Notch. We also found that an SPP inhibitor displays pharmacological crossover, blocking γ-secretase activity as well. Sequence homology between PS and an entire family of so-called “PS homologs,” which includes SPP, is found primarily at the transmembrane motifs YD and LGLGD that contain the critical and conserved aspartates (14Ponting C.P. Hutton M. Nyborg A. Baker M. Jansen K. Golde T.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). (Z-ll)2-ketone is a transition state analog that directly interacts with SPP (13Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). By showing that this compound can inhibit γ-secretase and compete for the active site on PS, we provide evidence that γ-secretase and SPP have similar active sites and likely share the same proteolytic mechanism. Other than the short, conserved aspartate-containing motifs, SPP and PS share very little homology, suggesting that the two proteins arrived at their aspartyl protease mechanisms via independent evolutionary paths. Finally, analyzing an epoxide inhibitor in our displacement assay revealed that this molecule affects the active site of γ-secretase in a time-dependent manner. The epoxide may inactivate γ-secretase by irreversible binding to the active site aspartates due to its chemical properties. Further work will focus on studying this interaction in detail, as epoxides might be good chemical probes for the active site of γ-secretase or other unknown intramembrane aspartate proteases awaiting a discovery.

The mechanism of glomerular hypertrophy, however, remains incompletely understood. We have reported that Gas6 (growth arrest-specific gene 6) and its receptor, Axl, play a key role in the development of glomerulonephritis. Here we show the important role of Gas6/Axl in the pathogenesis of diabetic glomerular hypertrophy. In streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats, mesangial and glomerular hypertrophy and an increase in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria were observed after 12 weeks of STZ injection. The glomerular expression of Gas6 and Axl was increased in those rats. Administration of warfarin inhibited mesangial and glomerular hypertrophy and the increase in GFR and albuminuria in STZ rats. Moreover, we found less mesangial hypertrophy in STZ-treated Gas6 knockout mice than control mice. In vitro we found that stimulation of mesangial cells with Gas6 resulted in mesangial cell hypertrophy. Thus we have found a novel mechanism of glomerular hypertrophy through the Gas6/Axl-mediated pathway in the development of diabetic nephropathy. Inhibition of the Gas6/Axl pathway in diabetic patients might be beneficial to slow down the progression of diabetic nephropathy.

Inhibition of the Gas6/Axl pathway in diabetic patients might be beneficial to slow down the progression of diabetic nephropathy. transforming growth factor-β1 streptozotocin glomerular filtration rate mitogen-activated protein Diabetes is the most common cause of end stage renal disease in many countries. Approximately 30% of type 1 diabetic patients suffer from diabetic nephropathy (1Bojestig M. Arnqvist H.J. Hermansson G. Karlberg B.E. Ludvigsson J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 2Krolewski M. Eggers P.W. Warram J.H. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 2041-2046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Therefore, tremendous efforts have been made to elucidate the molecular mechanism of diabetic nephropathy to develop an effective treatment. The feature characteristic of diabetic nephropathy is persistent albuminuria and mesangial expansion followed by glomerulosclerosis and a decline in renal function. The development of glomerulosclerosis in diabetes mellitus is always preceded by the early hypertrophic processes in the glomerular compartment (3Ziyadeh F.N. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1993; 22: 736-744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Because it is important to regulate the early stage of the disease process, extensive efforts have been made to elucidate growth factors and cytokines involved in mesangial expansion or hypertrophy (4Wolf G. Kidney Int. Suppl. 2000; 77: S59-S66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)1 and angiotensin II are found to be implicated in the development of diabetic nephropathy among them (5Lehmann R. Schleicher E.D. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2000; 297: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or type I angiotensin receptor blockers are effective to some extent, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can decrease the risk of developing diabetic nephropathy by only 12.5% in type 2 diabetic patients (6Ravid M. Brosh D. Levi Z. Bar-Dayan Y. Ravid D. Rachmani R. Ann. Intern. Med. 1998; 128: 982-988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, additional pathogenetic mechanisms are being urgently investigated to help design novel therapies for patients with diabetic nephropathy. Among other potential growth factors for glomerular cells, we have investigated the role of Gas6 (growth arrest-specific gene 6) in the pathogenesis of kidney disease. Gas6, cloned from serum-starved fibroblasts (7Manfioletti G. Brancolini C. Avanzi G. Schneider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4976-4985Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), is posttranslationally activated by γ-carboxylation of glutamate residues at its N terminus in the presence of vitamin K and inhibited by the anticoagulant warfarin (8Nakano T.

Kishino J. Nomura K. Higashino K. Arita H. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Recently we showed that Gas6 is an autocrine growth factor for mesangial cells and that Gas6 and its receptor Axl play a critical role in the development of glomerulonephritis by showing that warfarin and the extracellular domain of Axl inhibit mesangial cell proliferation by specific blockade of the Gas6-mediated pathway in a mesangial proliferative model of glomerulonephritis (10Yanagita M.

However, the role of Gas6 and Axl in diabetic nephropathy is not determined. The present study is designed to examine whether Gas6 and Axl can contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetic glomerular hypertrophyin vivo and in vitro. In this study, we specifically asked whether Gas6 and Axl can play an important role in mesangial cell hypertrophy, which is a feature seen in the early phase of diabetic nephropathy and whether inhibition of the Gas6/Axl pathway can affect the progression of diabetic nephropathy in streptozotocin (STZ) rats and mice. STZ was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Inc. Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Recombinant human TGF-β1 was purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 170–200 g were purchased from Shimizu Laboratory Animal center (Hamamatsu, Japan). Gas6 knockout mice were generated with a targeted disruption of the Gas6 gene as previously described (11Yanagita M. Ishimoto Y. Arai H. Nagai K. Ito T. Nakano T. Salant D.J. Fukatsu A. Doi T. Kita T. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Control inbred C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Clea Japan, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). The animals were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions at the Animal Facilities of Kyoto University, Faculty of Medicine. All of the animal experiments were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines, and the Review Board of Kyoto University granted ethical permission to this study. The glomerular mesangial primary culture was established from glomeruli isolated from normal 4-week-old mice (C57BL/6JxSJL/J) and was identified according to the method previously described (12Doi T. Vlassara H. Kirstein M. Yamada Y. Striker G.E. Striker L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2873-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 13MacKay K. Striker L.J. Elliot S.

Phenotypically stable mesangial cells, 12th to 16th passages, were plated on 100-mm plastic dishes (Nalge Nunc International, Roskilde, Denmark) and maintained in growth medium (3:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium modified trace elements) (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 1 mm glutamine, penicillin at 100 units/ml, streptomycin at 100 μg/ml (Invitrogen) and 20% fetal bovine serum (Cansera International Inc., Rexdale, Canada). Male rats weighing 170–200 g were made diabetic by a single intravenous injection of STZ (55 mg/kg body weight) in 0.05 mol/liter citrate buffer (pH 4.5). Weight-matched 8-week-old mice (17–20 g) were made diabetic by two consecutive daily intraperitoneal injections of STZ (150 mg/kg) dissolved in 0.01 mol/liter citrate buffer. Rats and mice receiving an injection of citrate buffer were used as controls. The levels of blood glucose were determined 2 days after injection of STZ or vehicle, and rats and mice with blood glucose levels more than >16.7 mmol/liter were used as diabetic (14Koya D. Jirousek M.R. Lin Y.W. Ishii H. Kuboki K. King G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 15Flyvbjerg A. Bennett W.F. Rasch R. Kopchick J.J. Scarlett J.A. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Twelve weeks after STZ injection, the rats and mice were weighed and sacrificed. The rats were divided into four groups: control rats without treatment, control rats with warfarin treatment, diabetic rats without treatment, and diabetic rats with warfarin treatment. The rats with warfarin treatment were administered with 0.25 mg/liter warfarin potassium (provided by Eisai Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in drinking water from the day of STZ injection. The dosage of warfarin was determined based on the previous report (10Yanagita M. Arai H. Ishii K. Nakano T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Varnum B. Fukatsu A. Doi T. Kita T. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 1423-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because diabetic rats drink much more water, the dosage of warfarin was reduced to 0.06 mg/liter from 2 days after injection of STZ. Twelve weeks after injection, the rats were weighed and sacrificed. Blood was collected at sacrifice. Prothrombin times, hematocrits, serum creatinine, and plasma concentrations of warfarin were measured as described (10Yanagita M. Arai H. Ishii K. Nakano T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Varnum B. Fukatsu A. Doi T. Kita T. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 1423-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). HbA1c was measured using DCA2000 analyzer (Bayer Medical, Tokyo, Japan). Before sacrifice, creatinine and albumin were measured from 24-h urine collection. Kidney tissues from each animal were snap frozen in cold acetone in optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetechnical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and cryostat sections (4 μm) were stained by indirect immunofluorescence procedure with the following primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal antibodies against rat Gas6 (16Yanagita M. Ishii K. Ozaki H. Arai H. Nakano T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Kita T. Doi T. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2503-2509PubMed Google Scholar) and human Axl (generous gift from Dr. Brian Varnum, Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA). Glomeruli were isolated from renal cortices of rats using the differential sieving method (17Ziswiler R. Steinmann-Niggli K. Kappeler A. Daniel C. Marti H.P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 2055-2066PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pippin J.W. Qu Q. Meijer L. Shankland S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2512-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The purity of the glomeruli was >90%. Isolated glomeruli were suspended in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% SDS, 1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml of aprotinine), and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatants were used as total cell lysates. 60 μg of each sample was applied to SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell). The blots were subsequently incubated with rabbit anti-rat Gas6, anti-human Axl, rabbit anti-phospho-p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), or rabbit anti-MAP kinase polyclonal antibody (Oncogene, San Diego, CA), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences). The immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the enhanced chemiluminescent system (Amersham Biosciences). The mesangial cell area was measured in a hematoxylin eosin staining section by Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). For each animal, 50 mesangial cell areas were analyzed. The glomerular surface area and the periodic acid-methenamine-silver-positive area were determined using an image analyzer (Image Processor for Analytical Pathology; Sumitomo Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan) (19Yamamoto Y. Kato I. Doi T. Yonekura H. Ohashi S. Takeuchi M. Watanabe T. Yamagishi S. Sakurai S. Takasawa S. Okamoto H. Yamamoto H. J. Clin.

Transplant. 2002; 17: 2132-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For each animal, 50 glomeruli were analyzed. Urine volume (Vu) was measured at 12 weeks by 24-h urine collection from rats housed in individual metabolic cages. During the urine collection, the rats were allowed free access to food and water. Serum and urine creatinine concentrations (Cp andCu) were measured, and GFR was calculated by the following equation: GFR = (Cu/Cp) ×Vu/body weight (21Stockelman M.G. Lorenz J.N. Smith F.N. Boivin G.P. Sahota A. Tischfield J.A. Stambrook P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F154-F163PubMed Google Scholar). The albumin concentration in the urine was measured by Nephrat (Exocell Inc., Philadelphia, PA). Mesangial cells were plated at 1.5 × 104cells/well in 24-well dishes. After 48 h, the cells were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 48 h. The medium was then replaced with the fresh starving medium including various concentrations of agonist or left untreated. After 18 h, the cells were labeled with [3H]leucine (2 μCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences) for 6 h, and the incorporation of [3H]leucine into acid-precipitable materials was then determined. For determination of cell number, the cells were trypsinized, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and counted with a Coulter counter Z1 (Coulter Electronics Ltd., Hialeah, FL). The data were normalized by dividing incorporation counts by the cell number and showed as fold increases over control. Mesangial cells were plated at 4.5 × 105 cells/well in 100-mm plates. The cells were treated as the [3H]leucine incorporation procedure. After treatment, mesangial cells were harvested by tripsinization, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 10 min, and then resuspended in ice-cold 70% ethanol added dropwise while vortexing. Ethanol-fixed mesangial cells were then analyzed by forward light scattering on a Becton Dickinson flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The data are expressed as the means ± S.D. Comparison among each group was performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Neuman-Keuls test to evaluate the statistical significance between two groups. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be significant. Our preliminary data showed that glomerular hypertrophy and an increase in GFR and albuminuria were observed after 12 weeks of STZ injection in rats. Therefore, to examine the role of Gas6/Axl in the early phase of diabetic nephropathy in vivo, we used STZ-induced diabetic rat kidney. We analyzed the glomerulus after 12 weeks of STZ injection and found that expression of both Gas6 and Axl was significantly increased in the STZ-treated group and that they were mostly localized at endothelial and mesangial cells (Fig.1). Because expression of Gas6 and Axl was induced in diabetic rats, the Gas6/Axl pathway seems to play a role in the development of diabetic nephropathy in the early phase of the disease process. Therefore, we next examined whether inhibiting this pathway can be effective in treating this experimental diabetic nephropathy. We treated rats with warfarin in drinking water as shown in Fig.2. Plasma concentrations of warfarin in these rats were 0.71 ± 0.05 and 0.67 ± 0.05 μm, which were significantly lower than the ordinary therapeutic concentrations as an anticoagulant. The body weight and kidney weight/body weight values were not changed by warfarin treatment. Significant prolongation of prothrombin times, anemia, or bleeding tendency was not observed in all the rats during the whole period of warfarin treatment as we already found in our previous study (data not shown). After 12 weeks of STZ injection, we isolated glomeruli from the rats and found increased glomerular expression of Gas6 and Axl by Western blotting (Fig. 3) as shown in Fig. 1. When we treated STZ rats with warfarin, we found that the expression of Axl was markedly inhibited in warfarin-treated STZ rats than untreated STZ rats. Although warfarin treatment did not affect Gas6 expression, it might be due to the fact that the antibody used for Western blotting cannot discriminate active or inactive Gas6. Because we have shown that Gas6 can activate p44/42 MAP kinase in vitro (16Yanagita M. Ishii K. Ozaki H. Arai H. Nakano T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Kita T. Doi T. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2503-2509PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether p44/42 MAP kinase can be phosphorylated in diabetic glomerular lysates and whether warfarin treatment can affect the phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 3, p44/42 MAP kinase was phosphorylated in the glomerular lysates in STZ rats, and warfarin treatment abolished their phosphorylation. Because glomerular hypertrophy is one of the earliest structural alterations in diabetic nephropathy, we measured mesangial cell and glomerular surface areas in diabetic rat kidney and examined the effect of warfarin on glomerular hypertrophy. After 12 weeks of STZ injection, both areas were significantly enlarged compared with control rats, and administration of warfarin prevented the increase of mesangial and glomerular areas (Fig. 4). Because accumulation of mesangial extracellular matrix components is also an early structural change in diabetic nephropathy, we also measured the periodic acid-methenamine-silver-positive area in both groups. However, there was no change in the periodic acid-methenamine-silver-positive area between control and diabetic groups, indicating that there is no glomerular sclerotic change after 12 weeks of STZ injection (data not shown). In the early phase of diabetic nephropathy, GFR is increased in most of diabetic patients. Therefore, we examined whether GFR is increased in STZ rats and whether warfarin treatment can affect GFR. After 12 weeks of STZ injection, GFR and urinary albumin excretion were significantly increased, and the increased GFR and albuminuria were suppressed by warfarin treatment (Fig.5). To confirm the specificity of warfarin on the Gas6/Axl pathway, we used STZ-treated Gas6 knockout mice. Our preliminary data showed that glomerular hypertrophy was observed after 12 weeks of STZ injection in mice. Therefore, we analyzed mesangial and glomerular hypertrophy in Gas6 knockout and wild type mice after 12 weeks of STZ injection. As shown in Fig.6A, Gas6 knockout mice were smaller than wild type mice, and HbA1c was higher in Gas6 knockout mice than in wild type mice. However, the blood glucose levels were almost the same throughout the study period (data not shown). Although the kidney weight/body weight was smaller in diabetic Gas6 knockout mice compared with diabetic wild type mice, there was no statistically significant difference. As shown in Fig. 6 (B andC), mesangial cell and glomerular surface areas in diabetic wild type mice were significantly larger than those in wild type untreated mice. However, in diabetic Gas6 knockout mice, the increase of both areas was significantly suppressed. These data also indicate that Gas6 is involved in the development of the initial phase of diabetic nephropathy and suggest that warfarin inhibits diabetic nephropathy specifically through the Gas6-mediated pathway. To investigate the mechanism by which Gas6 is involved in glomerular hypertrophy in diabetic rats, we examined whether Gas6 can cause mesangial cell hypertrophy in vitro. We measured [3H]leucine incorporation in mouse mesangial cells as a marker of cellular hypertrophy after incubation with various concentrations of Gas6. Recombinant Gas6 increased incorporation of [3H]leucine incorporation dose-dependently, with a 1.5-fold increase at maximum (Fig.7). The same dose of Gla-defective Gas6, which is an inactive form of Gas6 without γ-carboxylation, did not affect [3H]leucine incorporation in mouse mesangial cells. The Gas6-mediated increase in [3H]leucine incorporation was almost the same as that of TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml). To clarify whether mesangial cell hypertrophy is mediated specifically through the Gas6-Axl pathway, we used the recombinant extracellular domain of Axl (Axl-Fc), which is a recombinant fusion protein of the extracellular domain of Axl and human Fc portion, as an inhibitor of the Gas6-Axl pathway. After preincubation with 10 nm Axl-Fc in starving medium for 1 h, Gas6 (100 ng/ml) was added to the serum-starved mesangial cells, and [3H]leucine incorporation was then measured. The addition of Axl-Fc inhibited the increased [3H]leucine incorporation by Gas6, suggesting that the effect of Gas6 on hypertrophy is specific for the Gas6-Axl interaction. Further, we checked the cellular size of mesangial cells by flow cytometry under the same protocol as [3H]leucine incorporation (Fig. 8). We found that treatment of the cells with Gas6 100 ng/ml or TGF-β1 increased the cellular size by 1.1-fold but not Gla-defective Gas6.Figure 8Flow cytometric analysis of mesangial cell size. The cells were treated as described in Fig. 7. After treatment, the mesangial cells were harvested by tripsinization, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 10 min, and then resuspend in ice-cold 70% ethanol. Ethanol-fixed mesangial cells were then analyzed by forward light scattering on a Becton Dickinson flow cytometer. The data are representative of six independent experiments with qualitatively similar changes.

This is the first demonstration that Gas6 can induce mesangial cell hypertrophy characteristic of the early stage of diabetic nephropathy and that warfarin is effective to prevent the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Our study implies that Gas6 can be a novel growth factor that plays a crucial role in the development of the initial phase of diabetic nephropathy. Here we have found a novel aspect of warfarin as an anti-hypertrophic agent. Our data also show that warfarin treatment ameliorated hyperfiltration and urinary albumin excretion in STZ rats. Thus hypertrophy and hyperfiltration might be an interactive mechanism and presumed to be causally linked (22Hostetter T.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 161-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is conceivable, therefore, that blocking the Gas6/Axl pathway can improve the vicious cycle in diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, treating diabetic patients with warfarin to prevent the nephropathy would be one of the options for treatment. However, the side effect of warfarin should be noted if we treat diabetic patients with warfarin. Warfarin has long been used as an anticoagulant to prevent thrombosis and embolism (23Gallus A.S. Baker R.I. Chong B.H. Ockelford P.A. Street A.M. Med. J. Aust. 2000; 172: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 24Booth S.L. Mayer J. Nutr. Rev. 2000; 58: 20-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and patients prescribed with this agent are monitored by measuring prolongation of prothrombin times to achieve its anticoagulant effect. These patients have to be treated for the risk of bleeding (25Schulman S. Lindmarker P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1953-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). However, the anti-hypertrophic effect of warfarin was achieved at serum concentrations of 0.7 μm, which is significantly lower than the ordinary therapeutic concentrations as an anticoagulant (4–5 μm) (26Holford N.H. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 1986; 11: 483-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The prothrombin times of rats treated with warfarin in our experiments were not significantly prolonged, and no bleeding tendency or anemia was observed (data not shown), whereas mesangial cell hypertrophy was significantly inhibited. Although we have shown the clear effect of warfarin on the development of diabetic nephropathy, the question remains about the specificity of the effect of warfarin. We have already shown that in mesangial cells warfarin specifically inhibits the Gas6/Axl pathway in vitro (16Yanagita M. Ishii K. Ozaki H. Arai H. Nakano T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Kita T. Doi T. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2503-2509PubMed Google Scholar). To further confirm the specificity, we have treated Gas6-deficient mice (11Yanagita M. Ishimoto Y. Arai H. Nagai K. Ito T. Nakano T. Salant D.J. Fukatsu A. Doi T. Kita T. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) with STZ (15Flyvbjerg A. Bennett W.F. Rasch R. Kopchick J.J. Scarlett J.A. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and found that both mesangial and glomerular areas were significantly decreased in Gas6-deficient mice compared with wild type mice. Therefore, we can conclude that this effect of warfarin would be mediated specifically through the inhibition of Gas6. Hypercoagulability in glomeruli has also been reported in diabetic nephropathy (27Kaizu K. Uriu K. Hashimoto O. Eto S. J. Diabet. Complications. 1991; 5: 92-94Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), which might worsen the renal function. Recently, Angelillo-Scherrer et al. (28Angelillo-Scherrer A. de Frutos P. Aparicio C. Melis E. Savi P. Lupu F. Arnout J. Dewerchin M. Hoylaerts M. Herbert J. Collen D. Dahlback B. Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) reported that a deficiency of Gas6 protects mice from thrombosis. In this study, we used a low dose of warfarin, and at these concentrations we found no prolongation of prothrombin time (data not shown). However, we already reported that even under these concentrations, warfarin can inhibit the activation of Gas6 in vitro and in vivo (10Yanagita M. Arai H. Ishii K. Nakano T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 42364-42369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is still possible that warfarin could affect the coagulation cascades and prevent thrombotic events even at low concentrations. Therefore, Gas6 might affect the development of diabetic renal disease by improving the coagulation state. The increase of extracellular matrix followed by mesangial cell hypertrophy is one of the major characteristics in diabetic nephropathy (30Wolf G. Ziyadeh F.N. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 393-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Mauer et al. (31Mauer S.M. Steffes M.W. Ellis E.N. Sutherland D.E. Brown D.M. Goetz F.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1143-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar) investigated the structural-functional relationship in a cross-section of patients with type 1 diabetes. They found a close correlation between mesangial expansion and clinical manifestations of diabetic nephropathy. Ziyadeh (3Ziyadeh F.N. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1993; 22: 736-744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) also showed that the development of irreversible renal changes in diabetes mellitus, such as glomerulosclerosis, is always preceded by the early hypertrophic processes in the glomerular compartment. In our experiment, however, we could not find an excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix in STZ rats at 12 weeks, although other investigators have reported increased deposition of extracellular matrix in a later phase of nephropathy in STZ rats (32Makino H. Yamasaki Y. Hironaka K. Ota Z. Virchows Arch. B Cell Pathol. Incl. Mol. Pathol. 1992; 62: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because our purpose in this study is to determine the role of Gas6 in the initial phase of diabetic nephropathy, we analyzed up to 12 weeks after STZ injection. The correlation between Gas6 and diabetic glomerulosclerosis should be evaluated by treating the rats with warfarin for a longer time or using another animal model. Treating STZ rats with a high protein diet would be another way to accelerate the glomerulosclerosis (33Zatz R. Meyer T.W. Rennke H.G. Brenner B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5963-5967Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) and should be tested in the future experiments. We have already shown that Gas6 is a growth factor for mesangial cellsin vitro and that Gas6 plays a key role in acute and chronic forms of glomerulonephritis in vivo (10Yanagita M. Arai H. Ishii K.

Kita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42364-42369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In those studies, we have shown that Gas6 can induce mesangial proliferation through a tyrosine kinase, Axl (11Yanagita M. Ishimoto Y. Arai H. Nagai K. Ito T. Nakano T. Salant D.J. Fukatsu A. Doi T. Kita T. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Yanagita M. Ishii K. Ozaki H. Arai H. Nakano T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Kita T. Doi T. J. Am. Soc.

Kita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42364-42369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, in this study we have clearly shown that Gas6 can induce mesangial hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, the obvious question is why Gas6 only induces mesangial hypertrophy without affecting the mesangial proliferation in this diabetic rat model. Although we determined the mesangial cell area in the kidney of diabetic rats, we did not notice that the glomerular cell number was increased in diabetic rats (data not shown). Although Young et al. (34Young B.A. Johnson R.J. Alpers C.E. Eng E. Gordon K. Floege J. Couser W.G. Seidel K. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 935-944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) reported that diabetic nephropathy may be associated with some glomerular cell proliferation, hypertrophy is the major finding of diabetic nephropathy. It remains uncertain why Gas6 can be induced in both glomerulonephritis and diabetic nephropathy and why Gas6 does not induce cell proliferation in diabetic nephropathy. It is conceivable that some other growth factor or cytokine is playing an additional role in determining the fate of mesangial cell in the disease process. We have clearly shown that p42/44 MAP kinase was phosphorylated in the glomeruli after 12 weeks of STZ injection and that warfarin treatment abolished the phosphorylation. In the case of insulin-like growth factor 1, Akt seems to be responsible for its hypertrophic effect in skeletal myotube (35Rommel C. Bodine S.C. Clarke B.A. Rossman R. Nunez L. Stitt T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Glass D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1009-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar), and endothelin-induced hypertrophy requires activation of p42/44 MAP kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways (36Goruppi S. Bonventre J.V. Kyriakis J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5427-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although we have no definite evidence to indicate the role of p42/44 MAP kinase in mesangial cell hypertrophy so far, phosphorylation of p42/44 MAP kinase might be used as a marker for the hypertrophy in diabetic nephropathy. The molecular mechanism of mesangial cell hypertrophy in diabetic nephropathy should be further clarified in future studies. In summary, this is the first demonstration that Gas6 and Axl are involved in the development of the initial phase of diabetic nephropathy by inducing mesangial cell hypertrophy. This is a completely novel mechanism explaining the development of diabetic nephropathy. Blocking this pathway would be beneficial to prevent the progression of nephropathy in diabetic patients.

Differential display of mRNA expression in prostate carcinoma sublines with varying metastatic potential revealed overexpression of this transcript in the metastatic AT6.1 subline. cDNA cloning identified a 2733-bp transcript from AT6.1 RNA, encoding a protein of 532 amino acids, together with a 3067-bp human homologue, resulting in a 540-amino acid protein. Collagen XXIII is predicted to be a type II membrane protein consisting of an amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane region, and three collagenous domains flanked by short noncollagenous domains. Collagen XXIII is a new member of the transmembrane collagen family, showing structural homology with the transmembrane collagens XIII and XXV. We present evidence that collagen XXIII is expressed as a ∼75-kDa protein at the cell surface and that it can be cleaved by furin protease activity.

Cleavage results in a ∼60-kDa soluble protein that forms a multimeric complex and exhibits a low affinity interaction with heparin. The extracellular environment consists of a complex mix of matrix macromolecules together with sequestered growth factors. Each of these components can interact with cells to influence their function and behavior. Proteolytic cleavage of these molecules can release soluble growth factors and matrix fragments that also possess biological activity. The collagen superfamily represents the most abundant group of extracellular matrix macromolecules, and it is becoming clear that this family encompasses a structurally and functionally diverse group of proteins (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Collagens can be divided into two major groups: fibrillar and nonfibrillar, with a key characteristic of both being the presence of a repeating Gly-Xaa-Yaa, where Xaa and Yaa are frequently proline and hydroxyproline, respectively. A subfamily of the nonfibrillar collagens is the transmembrane collagens. This group currently consists of three members, collagens XIII and XVII and the recently identified collagen XXV, each containing a single-pass hydrophobic transmembrane domain. Both collagens XIII and XVII show widespread distribution in epithelia (2Peltonen S. Hentula M. Hagg P. Yla-Outinen H. Tuukkanen J. Lakkakorpi J. Rehn M. Pihlajaniemi T. Peltonen J. J. Invest.

We report here the cloning of a new transmembrane collagen overexpressed in rat prostate adenocarcinoma cells and characterize its cellular localization, its cleavage, and the properties of its soluble ectodomain. Cell Culture—The Dunning rat R-3327 prostate carcinoma sublines, AT2.1, AT3.1, and AT6.1, provided by J. Isaacs (Johns Hopkins University) were maintained as previously described (9Isaacs J.T. Isaacs W.B. Feitz W.F. Scheres J. Prostate. 1986; 9: 261-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). K562 and LoVo cells were purchased from ATCC and grown in recommended culture media. Transfection was performed in AT2.1 cells, unless otherwise stated, using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). The furin inhibitor decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone (CMK), 1The abbreviations used are: CMK, chloromethylketone; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; COL, collagenous; NC, noncollagenous; RT, reverse transcription; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. was purchased from Bachem. Differential Display—mRNA differential display PCR was performed on AT2.1, AT3.1, and AT6.1 cells as described previously (10Bao L. Loda M. Janmey P.A. Stewart R. Anand-Apte B. Zetter B.R. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). cDNA Cloning and Construct Preparation—An oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library was constructed in the λgt10 vector (Amersham Biosciences), using poly(A)+ RNA obtained from AT6.1 cells. The library was screened using a 32P-labeled cDNA fragment, identified from differential display, as a probe. Inserts from positive clones were subcloned into pBluescript II SK+/- and subjected to DNA sequencing. Partial rat and human collagen XXIII cDNAs were extended using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) with AT6.1 mRNA and Marathon-ready human brain (cerebellum) cDNA (Clontech), respectively. Further extension of the 5′ sequence was performed using a SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech), according to the manufacturer's instructions, using human heart poly(A)+ RNA and brain (cerebellum) poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech). Inverse RACE on AT6.1 RNA was performed as described (11Eyal Y. Neumann H. Or E. Frydman A. BioTechniques. 1999; 27: 656-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), using ThermoScript (Invitrogen), 10% GC-Melt (Clontech), and 5% Me2SO, reverse transcribing with primer R1 (5′-GCCCCGCACGCCGCAACAGTTCG-3′). Circularized DNA was amplified by PCR using nested reverse primer R2 (5′-CAGCGCCGCCACTCGGCCATGCAAG-3′) and forward primer F1 (5′-GCGAACTGTTGCGGCGTGCG-3′). The genomic sequence was amplified from adapter-ligated, restriction enzyme-digested rat genomic DNA from the Rat Genome Walker kit (Clontech) with Advantage-GC Genomic PCR reaction mix (Clontech) with adapter and gene-specific PCR primers. Amplified PCR products were inserted into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and plasmid DNA-sequenced. Amino-terminal truncated rat collagen XXIII(del 1–48)Myc corresponding to amino acids Ala49–Lys532, was obtained by PCR using LA Taq (Panvera, WI) with forward primer 5′-GCCTTGCATGGCCGAGTGGCGGCG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CGCTCTAGACTACAGATCTTCTTCAGAAATAAGTTTTTGTTCCTTATGCCAGCAACCAGGCACAGGCA-3′ and inserted into pcDNA4/HisMaxC (Invitrogen) in frame with an amino-terminal His tag. Full-length (wild type) rat collagen XXIII-Myc was constructed by overlap extension PCR. Exon 1 sequence was amplified by PCR from rat genomic DNA, as determined by genome walking, to overlap cloned cDNA sequence by a primer length. Fragments were annealed, extended using Advantage-GC Genomic polymerase, and amplified by PCR. The soluble cleaved form of human collagen XXIII, corresponding to Glu111–Lys540, was obtained using forward (5′-GGGGTACCGAAGCTCCATCCGAATGTGTCTGC-3′) and reverse (5′-CCGCTCGAGGCTTATGCCAGCAGCCAGGCACAG-3′) primers and inserted into pSecTag2HygroB (Invitrogen) with an amino-terminal Igκ secretion signal and carboxyl-terminal His and Myc tags. DNA was sequenced using the Sequenase 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) or submitted to the Dana Farber Molecular Biology Core Facility (Boston, MA) for DNA sequencing. Sequence data were compiled using GeneToolLite Multi-Align (BioTools, Inc., Alberta, Canada) and peptides aligned using GCG PileUp, PEP comparison matrix. Amino acid and nucleotide distances were compared using the Jotun Hein method. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from tissue culture cells using a RNeasy miniprep kit (Qiagen), treated with 25 units of RQ1 DNase (Promega), phenol-chloroform extracted, and ethanol-precipitated. 2 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using 200 units of Superscript II (Invitrogen) and 500 ng of oligo(dT)12–18 at 45 °C. Serial dilutions of cDNA were amplified by PCR using 18 cycles with the rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers (forward primer, 5′-TGAAGGTCGGTGTCAACGGATTTGGC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CATGTAGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′). PCR bands were analyzed by National Institutes of Health Scion Image (Scion Corporation), and cDNA concentration was equalized accordingly such that housekeeping gene amplification was equivalent (data not shown). Equalized cDNA was amplified by PCR using LA Taq using primers designed to span multiple exons (rat collagen XXIII forward primer, 5′-GACTCGACGGTTTCCCTGGACCCA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GATACAAGTTCTGAACAGGAGGCC-3′). PCR was performed using a PTC-200 Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ Research) as follows: 94 °C for 3 min; 38 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; followed by a 72 °C 5-min elongation step. Housekeeping genes were amplified using the same PCR conditions for 21 cycles. RNA analysis of collagen XXIII expression in normal tissues was performed on a rat multiple tissue cDNA panel (Clontech) using the PCR conditions listed above and primers (forward primer, 5′-GGCCCTCACGGTCTGCCTGGACC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TTGGGGGCTATGCCCGAGGATCACT-3′). Preparation of Collagen XXIII Antisera—Rat AT6.1 cDNA encoding the carboxyl-terminal 108 amino acids of collagen XXIII was cloned into pGEX3X vector (Amersham Biosciences). Protein was expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α (Invitrogen) and purified over a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with 100 μg of collagen XXIII glutathione S-transferase fusion protein emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant. The bleeds were screened by dot blot against the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Positive antiserum from rabbit 22225B, hereafter known as 6.1B, was used for subsequent analysis. Protein Preparation—The cells were collected in RIPA or M-PER extraction reagent (Pierce) supplemented with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). For serum-free conditioned medium analysis, the cells and debris were removed by centrifugation at 220 × g for 5 min, followed by 0.2-μm filtration. For conditioned medium analysis following transfection of wild type collagen XXIII-Myc, protein was concentrated using PAGEprep slurry (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions and eluted in 100 mm sodium citrate, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 1% SDS. For heparin and ion exchange binding studies, conditioned medium from collagen XXIII(Glu111–Lys540) transfected cells was analyzed without concentration. Heparin-agarose bead slurry (Pierce) was washed with heparin equilibration buffer (10 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.0), incubated with filtered conditioned medium, aliquoted into spin columns, washed in heparin equilibration buffer, and eluted with increasing concentration of NaCl in heparin equilibration buffer. For ion exchange, conditioned medium was diluted in binding buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, <25 mm salt), added to buffer-equilibrated columns, washed, and eluted in 1 m NaCl. Immunoblot Analysis—Protein sample concentrations were equalized by BCA Assay (Pierce) and separated by SDS-PAGE in the presence (reducing conditions) or absence (nonreducing conditions) of 5% β-mercaptoethanol. The proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) using Towbin buffer. Immunoblotting was performed using rabbit polyclonal anti-XXIII antibody 6.1B or 9E10 anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunofluorescence—Transfected cells on 10 μg/ml fibronectin-coated cover slips were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in PBS, and either washed in PBS or PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for membrane permeabilization. Nonspecific staining was blocked by incubation in 10% horse serum in PBS. The cells were incubated in 6.1B rabbit antibody followed by donkey anti-rabbit Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). The coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and examined under fluorescence illumination. Identification and Cloning of a Novel Collagen Expressed in Metastatic Prostate Adenocarcinoma Cells—Sublines of the Dunning rat R-3327 rat prostate adenocarcinoma (9Isaacs J.T. Isaacs W.B. Feitz W.F. Scheres J. Prostate. 1986; 9: 261-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) were analyzed for differences in mRNA expression by differential display analysis. An mRNA transcript was identified that was highly overexpressed in the metastatic subline AT6.1 (Fig. 1A). The cloned cDNA fragment was used to screen an AT6.1 cDNA library, isolating a 1412-bp partial cDNA. Sequence analysis revealed a novel mRNA containing an 108-amino acid open reading frame containing the repeating amino acid motif [Gly-Xaa-Yaa]n, where Xaa and Yaa were frequently proline and hydroxyproline, characteristic of the collagen superfamily of proteins (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The partial mRNA sequence was extended by both the 5′ and 3′ RACE methods (12Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar). Sequence obtained via multiple 5′ RACE reactions suggested an incomplete transcript, because of an additional collagenous coding sequence upstream of potential start sites. Consequently PCR genomic walking (13Siebert P.D. Chenchik A. Kellogg D.E. Lukyanov K.A. Lukyanov S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1087-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar) was used to amplify additional 5′ sequence, revealing a potential translation start site upstream of the known exon sequence. Inverse RACE (11Eyal Y. Neumann H. Or E. Frydman A. BioTechniques. 1999; 27: 656-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) confirmed this sequence in rat AT6.1 mRNA and further determined a potential transcriptional start site 128 bp upstream of the translation start site (Fig. 1B). Thus we identified a 2733-bp transcript from AT6.1 RNA. BLAST (14Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) comparison of the new collagen nucleotide sequence against available data base information revealed an expressed sequence tag fragment from human retina with homology. Northern blot and RT-PCR was used to identify human tissues and cell lines expressing this new collagen, revealing expression in human heart and brain and in the human leukemia cell line, K562 (data not shown). RNA from these sources was used to amplify the human homologue using RACE and PCR, identifying a 3067-bp transcript. BLAST searching revealed identity with the carboxyl-terminal end of an incomplete human cDNA from testis, DKFZp434K0621 (accession number AL137461), and most recently to the complete Mus musculus collagen α1 type XXIII (accession number AF410792). Thus we have identified and cloned both the human and rat type XXIII collagen α1-chains. At the nucleotide level, human and rat collagen α1(XXIII) show 76% identity. Rat and mouse collagen α1(XXIII) predictably show even greater cDNA identity, at 91%. Considering the high identity between human, rat, and mouse cDNAs, and the longer 5′ sequences identified in human and mouse, we note the possibility of additional transcriptional start sites in the rat collagen XXIII gene, in addition to the site we have identified by Inverse RACE. Certainly multiple transcriptional start sites have been identified in the structurally similar collagen XIII (15Kvist A.P. Latvanlehto A. Sund M. Horelli-Kuitunen N. Rehn M. Palotie A. Beier D. Pihlajaniemi T. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). BLAST searching the National Institutes of Health genome data base located the α1(XXIII) gene on Homo sapiens chromosome 5q35 (NT_023132.9) and M. musculus chromosome 11B1 + 2 (NW_000039.1), hereafter referred to simply as collagen XXIII, in the absence of known alternate α-chains. Across the open reading frames human and rat collagen XXIII show 65% nucleotide identity, translated into 532- and 540-amino acid proteins, respectively, with 91% identity (Fig. 2). Structurally, collagen XXIII consists of a long amino-terminal noncollagenous (NC) domain, NC-1, containing a short cytoplasmic region and a putative membrane spanning domain, followed by three collagenous (COL1–COL3) domains in the extracellular region of the protein that are interrupted by short noncollagenous domains (NC2–NC4), as shown in the schematic (Fig. 3). The structural organization of human and rat collagen XXIII is similar to the published transmembrane collagens XIII (16Hagg P. Rehn M. Huhtala P. Vaisanen T. Tamminen M. Pihlajaniemi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15590-15597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and collagen XXV (4Hashimoto T. Wakabayashi T. Watanabe A. Kowa H. Hosoda R. Nakamura A. Kanazawa I. Arai T. Takio K. Mann D.M. Iwatsubo T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). At the amino acid level collagens XIII and XXV show 54 and 56% identity with collagen XXIII, respectively, although this homology exists primarily across the collagenous domains. However, in all three structurally similar transmembrane collagens, types XXIII, XIII, and XXV, there is high identity across the 20-amino acid carboxyl-terminal noncollagenous domain (Fig. 4). In addition, the COL-1 domain of collagen XXIII contains a conserved consensus binding motif for the α5β1 integrin, RGD, and multiple copies of a KGD motif reportedly used for integrin-mediated cell adhesion by collagen type XVII (8Nykvist P. Tasanen K. Viitasalo T. Kapyla J. Jokinen J. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Heino J. J. Biol.

Multiple sequence analysis algorithms, including TMHMM2.0 (17Sonnhammer E.L. von Heijne G. Krogh A. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1998; 6: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar) and TMPred (18Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar), predict this region to be a transmembrane helix, in accord with the structural homology with transmembrane collagens XIII and XVII. To investigate the cellular localization of collagen XXIII, a truncation mutant, rat collagen XXIII(del 1–48)Myc, was constructed by deletion of the putative cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains. The length of the putative transmembrane helix is variable between prediction programs. Because the ectodomain sequence is important for collagen XIII chain association (19Snellman A. Tu H. Vaisanen T. Kvist A.P. Huhtala P. Pihlajaniemi T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5051-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), a minimal deletion was made. AT2.1 prostate carcinoma cells were transfected with either wild type rat collagen XXIII-Myc or the amino-terminal truncation mutant, rat collagen XXIII(del1–48). Cellular localization was determined by immunofluorescence staining using antibody 6.1B, which recognizes the carboxyl terminus of rat collagen XXIII. Fig. 5 demonstrates that wild type collagen XXIII could be detected either with or without cell permeabilization. In contrast, collagen XXIII(del1–48) was detected only following permeabilization of the cells, indicating an intracellular localization for the amino-terminal truncation mutant. This demonstrates that the carboxyl terminus of wild type collagen XXIII is present on the cell surface and that the amino-terminal cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains are required for cell surface targeting. Collagen XXIII Expression Is Up-regulated in Metastatic Tumor Cells—We first identified collagen XXIII in the highly metastatic AT6.1 subline from the Dunning Rat R-3327 prostate adenocarcinoma model. To investigate its expression pattern, RT-PCR analysis was performed on additional sublines in this rat prostate cancer series. Fig. 6A shows that nonmetastatic NbE cells and poorly metastatic AT2.1 cells did not express collagen XXIII, whereas highly metastatic AT6.1 cells show high levels of expression, and further revealed that an additional metastatic subline, MatLyLu, expressed low levels of collagen XXIII. We have examined collagen XXIII expression in normal rat tissues by RT-PCR analysis and found expression in brain and lung (data not shown). To investigate expression of collagen XXIII at the protein level, a rabbit polyclonal antibody, antibody 6.1B, was raised to a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein encoding the carboxyl-terminal 108 amino acids of rat collagen XXIII. Fig. 7A demonstrates antigenic recognition of transfected rat collagen XXIII(del 1–48)Myc by 6.1B antibody. Specificity was compared with immunoblot using anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody, as shown in Fig. 7B. Endogenous collagen XXIII was detected in rat AT6.1 and MatLyLu metastatic prostate carcinoma cells by immunoblot using 6.1B antibody, as a protein with a molecular mass of ∼70,000–75,000 Da. No collagen XXIII protein was detectable in the nonmetastatic NbE cells or in the poorly metastatic AT2.1 subline (Fig. 7C), confirming the expression pattern at the RNA level. These results suggest that collagen XXIII expression is up-regulated in certain metastatic prostate cancer cells relative to nonmetastatic or poorly metastatic prostate cancer cells. Collagen XXIII Is Cleaved from the Cell Surface by Furin Protease Activity—Because most collagens are secreted proteins, we explored whether collagen XXIII was retained on the cell surface by analyzing cell lysates and cell-conditioned media of cells transfected with Myc-tagged wild type rat collagen XXIII. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of a 70,000–75,000-Da form on the cell surface along with a smaller, ∼60-kDa soluble form of the protein in the cell media (Fig. 8, A and B). Amino acid analysis of the extracellular domain of collagen XXIII revealed potential sites for cleavage by furin, a protease that requires the minimal basic amino acid motif Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Arg (20Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Collagen XXIII contains a suitable basic motif, 94KLRTVR99 in rat collagen XXIII and 105KIRTAR110 in human collagen XXIII. Interestingly, these motifs show homology with the furin cleavage sites reported in the transmembrane collagens XIII (19Snellman A. Tu H. Vaisanen T. Kvist A.P. Huhtala P. Pihlajaniemi T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5051-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), XVII (3Schacke H. Schumann H. Hammami-Hauasli N. Raghunath M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25937-25943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and XXV (4Hashimoto T. Wakabayashi T. Watanabe A. Kowa H. Hosoda R. Nakamura A. Kanazawa I. Arai T. Takio K. Mann D.M. Iwatsubo T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of furin proteases in collagen XXIII cleavage, wild type rat collagen XXIII-Myc overexpressing cells were treated with a synthetic furin inhibitor, decanoyl-RVKR-CMK. Fig. 8 (A and B) demonstrates that cleavage of collagen XXIII was reduced by CMK treatment. Equal loading of lysate protein is indicated by β-actin immunoblot (Fig. 8C). In addition, when wild type collagen XXIII-Myc was overexpressed in LoVo cells, a human colon carcinoma cell line that lacks endogenous furin activity (21Takahashi S. Kasai K. Hatsuzawa K. Kitamura N. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Murakami K. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), full-length protein was seen in the cell lysate, but no soluble cleavage product was detectable in the medium fraction (Fig. 8D). Taken together, these data indicate a role for furin protease cleavage in the processing of collagen XXIII. Multimer Formation and Heparin Binding of Soluble Collagen XXIII—Collagen XXIII is a new member of an increasingly structurally diverse collagen superfamily, many members of which associate with homotypic or heterotypic collagen polypeptide chains to form multimers. To investigate the association of collagen XXIII α-chains, the truncation mutant collagen XXIII(del1–48)Myc was used, such that protein would be retained in the cell lysate and not cleaved into the cell conditioned medium. The cells were transfected with rat collagen XXIII(del1–48)Myc, and cell lysate was analyzed by immunoblot under nonreducing and reducing conditions. Fig. 9A shows the formation of multimeric complexes, indicative of a dimer and trimer, which were reduced to a monomer upon addition of the reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol. Because we have shown that the wild type protein can be cleaved from the cell surface, we next determined whether the cleaved collagen remains in this multimeric form. Conditioned medium from cells overexpressing wild type collagen XXIII-Myc was collected and analyzed by immunoblot under nonreducing and reducing conditions (Fig. 9B). These data indicate that furin-cleaved soluble collagen XXIII can exist as an α3(XXIII) homotrimer and also suggest that the amino acids required for α-chain association are beyond the site of furin cleavage. To further investigate the function of soluble collagen XXIII, an expression plasmid was constructed encoding the cleaved form of human collagen XXIII, amplified from K562 human leukemia cell cDNA, in frame with a secretion signal sequence. Serum-free conditioned medium from collagen XXIII(Glu111–Lys540)-transfected cells was immunoblotted under nonreducing conditions, resulting in equivalent multimer formation, validating α-chain association of this secreted protein (data not shown). Because a soluble collagen may be available for cell surface and/or extracellular matrix binding, we next investigated the heparin binding affinity of collagen XXIII. Conditioned medium from cells transfected with secreted collagen XXIII(Glu111–Lys540) was incubated with heparin-agarose at pH 7.0 (Fig. 10A) and pH 8.6 (data not shown), and the fractions were eluted with increasing salt concentration. Secreted collagen XXIII(Glu111–Lys540) bound heparin with weak affinity, with elution beginning at 200 mm NaCl. We also determined that collagen XXIII(Glu111–Lys540) bound to anion exchange columns of weak and strong affinity at pH 8.0 (Fig. 10B), indicating a net negative charge. We have identified a new transmembrane collagen, collagen XXIII, from rat and human RNA. This collagen is the fourth in the subgroup of nonfibrillar type II transmembrane collagens and displays similarities in domain structure with collagens XIII and XXV. It is expressed in normal human heart and retina as well as in metastatic prostate cancer cells. Although sequence identity is low across collagens XXIII, XIII, and XXV, their 20-amino acid NC-4 carboxyl-terminal noncollagenous domains show significant identity. We hypothesize that this motif may be involved in functional interaction with cell surface or extracellular matrix proteins. Such an interaction might occur either between the integral membrane “precursors” of these transmembrane collagens or following cleavage to their soluble forms. It is thus possible to envisage a bifunctional signaling process, in a similar manner as has been shown for soluble and membrane bound forms of neuropilin interacting with the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor (22Gagnon M.L. Bielenberg D.R. Gechtman Z. Miao H.Q. Takashima S. Soker S. Klagsbrun M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2573-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the cytoplasmic domains of the structurally similar collagens XXIII, XIII, and XXV display minimal sequence identity. That the NC-4 noncollagenous domain is not critical for α-chain association is suggested by trimer formation of truncated collagen XIII, where both the COL-3 and NC-4 domains were deleted (19Snellman A. Tu H. Vaisanen T. Kvist A.P. Huhtala P. Pihlajaniemi T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5051-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Independent of this conserved noncollagenous domain, there are several amino acid motifs present in collagen XXIII that may contribute toward cell interaction. We report that collagen XXIII contains a species conserved RGD motif, the binding site for α5β1 integrin, and three copies of a KGD motif, which contributes to cell adhesion and migration on collagen XVII via weak α5β1 and αvβ1 integrin subunit interaction (8Nykvist P. Tasanen K. Viitasalo T. Kapyla J. Jokinen J. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38673-38679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, of the traditional collagen receptors, α1β1 but not α2β1 mediated interaction with native collagen XIII (7Nykvist P. Tu H. Ivaska J. Kapyla J. Pihlajaniemi T. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8255-8261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These reports suggest the possibility of similar integrin receptor-mediated interactions with collagen XXIII. These interactions may be dependent on collagen chain association and folding, because the peptide motifs RGD and KGD lie within collagenous domains and could be hidden within a collagen triple helix. Such cryptic motifs are exposed upon proteolytic cleavage or unfolding via denaturation, as shown for collagen types I, V, VI, and XVII (8Nykvist P. Tasanen K. Viitasalo T. Kapyla J. Jokinen J. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38673-38679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Davis G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 24Ruggiero F. Champliaud M.F. Garrone R. Aumailley M. Exp.

Cell Res. 1993; 206: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Conversely, other peptide motifs may depend on triple helix conformation for ligand presentation to integrin receptors, as observed for the collagen recognition motif GFOGER (26Knight C.G. Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Tuckwell D.S. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Clearly the state of collagen folding could influence cellular interaction and function. We have shown that recombinantly expressed forms of collagen XXIII formed multimers suggestive of a dimer and trimer under nonreducing conditions. Although the trimeric complex might be predicted to contain nucleated triple helical domains characteristic of collagens, it has been observed that expression of other recombinant transmembrane collagens also results in dimeric structures. Expression of recombinant collagen types XIII (19Snellman A. Tu H. Vaisanen T. Kvist A.P. Huhtala P. Pihlajaniemi T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5051-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 27Tu H.

Wakabayashi T. Watanabe A. Kowa H. Hosoda R. Nakamura A. Kanazawa I. Arai T. Takio K. Mann D.M. Iwatsubo T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) generates both dimers and trimers. However, rotary shadowing electron microscopy of the structurally similar collagen XIII has revealed the formation of rodlike structures (27Tu H. Sasaki T. Snellman A. Gohring W. Pirila P. Timpl R. Pihlajaniemi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23092-23099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), consistent with triple helix folding. This might imply that these collagen dimers represent a processing intermediate, although dimeric collagen XXV/CLAC100 is a major form detected in brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer's disease (4Hashimoto T. Wakabayashi T. Watanabe A. Kowa H. Hosoda R. Nakamura A. Kanazawa I. Arai T. Takio K. Mann D.M. Iwatsubo T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We have not yet been able to determine whether endogenous collagen XXIII shows the same distribution of monomer and multimers because of expression levels and/or detection sensitivity. However, collagen XXIII chain association will be an important consideration in the functional analysis of this protein. Collagens can also interact with other components of the extracellular matrix, as demonstrated by collagen XXV binding to fibrillized β-amyloid peptide, a key component of the characteristic senile plaques deposited in Alzheimer's disease (4Hashimoto T. Wakabayashi T. Watanabe A. Kowa H. Hosoda R. Nakamura A. Kanazawa I. Arai T. Takio K. Mann D.M. Iwatsubo T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and collagen XIII interaction with fibronectin, nidogen-2, and heparin (27Tu H. Sasaki T. Snellman A. Gohring W. Pirila P. Timpl R. Pihlajaniemi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23092-23099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We report here low affinity heparin binding of collagen XXIII. Indeed, collagen XXIII contains clusters of basic amino acid residues that might mediate heparin interaction. Heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans exist both at the cell surface and as a matrix component; thus any interaction may be relevant in the context of either cell-matrix or cell-cell contact (28Park P.W. Reizes O. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29923-29926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and we are currently further defining this binding activity. Our results demonstrate that cleavage of type XXIII collagen is a furin convertase/paired basic amino acid-cleaving enzyme-mediated event. Many transmembrane proteins are cleaved by this group of proteases, including growth factors such as transforming growth factor-β1 and other proteases, such as stromelysin 3 (matrix metalloprotease-11) and membrane type matrix metalloprotease-1 (reviewed in Ref. 20Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Furin cleavage of many proteins is a required activation event, resulting in the release of a soluble mature molecule from an inactive precursor. This raises the possibility that soluble collagen XXIII represents the mature form of collagen XXIII. Alternatively, membrane proteins can possess activities independent of the cleaved protein, as demonstrated with soluble sHB-EGF and proHB-EGF (29Miyoshi E. Higashiyama S. Nakagawa T. Hayashi N. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14349-14355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because furin protease cleavage may control the rate of release of soluble collagen XXIII, it is interesting to note that increased furin expression has been reported in lung (30Mbikay M. Sirois F. Yao J. Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 75: 1509-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and head and neck tumors (31Bassi D.E. Mahloogi H. Al-Saleem L. Lopez De Cicco R. Ridge J.A. Klein-Szanto A.J. Mol. Carcinog. 2001; 31: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Moreover, reduced tumorigenicity resulted from inhibition of furin activity (32Bassi D.E. Lopez De Cicco R. Mahloogi H. Zucker S. Thomas G. Klein-Szanto A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10326-10331Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Because collagen XXIII expression was up-regulated in more aggressive cell lines of the Dunning rat prostate carcinoma model, concurrent furin activity level may be an important factor regulating transmembrane collagen cleavage in the tumor environment. A useful consequence of increased cleavage of a membrane protein up-regulated in tumor cells is its potential use as a diagnostic or prognostic marker. We have preliminary evidence correlating increased collagen XXIII immunohistochemical staining with increasing tumor stages in human prostate cancer (data not shown) and are further characterizing expression to explore this possibility. The Dunning rat prostate carcinoma variants were generously provided by J. T. Isaacs (Johns Hopkins University). The NbE rat prostate cell line was provided by M. R. Freeman (Children's Hospital, Boston, MA)."
https://openalex.org/W2068733899,"γ-Secretase is a high molecular weight multicomponent protein complex with an unusual intramembrane-cleaving aspartyl protease activity. γ-Secretase is intimately associated with Alzheimer disease because it catalyzes the proteolytic cleavage, which leads to the liberation of amyloid औ-peptide. At least presenilin (PS), Nicastrin (Nct), APH-1, and PEN-2 are constituents of the γ-secretase complex, with PS apparently providing the active site of γ-secretase. Expression of γ-secretase complex components is tightly regulated, however little is known about the assembly of the complex. Here we demonstrate that Nct undergoes a major conformational change during the assembly of the γ-secretase complex. The conformational change is directly associated with γ-secretase function and involves the entire Nct ectodomain. Loss of function mutations generated by deletions failed to undergo the conformational change. Furthermore, the conformational alteration did not occur in the absence of PS. Our data thus suggest that γ-secretase function critically depends on the structural “activation” of Nct. γ-Secretase is a high molecular weight multicomponent protein complex with an unusual intramembrane-cleaving aspartyl protease activity. γ-Secretase is intimately associated with Alzheimer disease because it catalyzes the proteolytic cleavage, which leads to the liberation of amyloid औ-peptide. At least presenilin (PS), Nicastrin (Nct), APH-1, and PEN-2 are constituents of the γ-secretase complex, with PS apparently providing the active site of γ-secretase. Expression of γ-secretase complex components is tightly regulated, however little is known about the assembly of the complex. Here we demonstrate that Nct undergoes a major conformational change during the assembly of the γ-secretase complex.

Here we demonstrate that a major conformational change, which requires that the entire ectodomain of Nct is directly associated with γ-secretase complex formation and function. The structural alteration fails to occur in Nct loss of function mutations as well as in the absence of presenilins. To down-regulate endogenous Nct by RNA interference (RNAi), oligonucleotides corresponding to Nct-1045 (6Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8666-8671Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) were cloned into the pSUPER vector (14Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). Nct deletions (Del 1–5, Fig. 1a) were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using PCR. Silencer mutations (aaagggaaattcccggtccaatt; the mutations are underlined) were introduced (which do not affect the amino acid sequence) in the constructs to escape RNAi. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblast cells were cultured as described (6Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8666-8671Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A stable Nct knock-down cell line was generated by stably co-transfecting HEK 293 cells overexpressing Swedish mutant APP (15Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Hung A.Y. Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lieberburg I. Selkoe D.J.

This cell line was stably transfected with the indicated wt and mutant Nct constructs or the empty vector (pcDNA6) by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer using selection for blasticidin (10 ॖg/ml) resistance. To inhibit mannosidase I, cells were cultured in the presence of the indicated amounts of kifunensine (Calbiochem) or vehicle for 48 h at 37 °C. The polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against the large cytoplasmic loop domain of PS1 (3027 and BI.3D7), the PS1 N terminus (PS1N), PEN-2 (1638), the APP C terminus (6687), and Aऔ (1–42) (3926) were described previously (see Refs. 6Edbauer D.

The polyclonal antibody N1660 against the C terminus of Nct and monoclonal antibody 6E10 against Aऔ (1–17) were obtained from Sigma and Senetek, respectively, the anti-APH-1aL (O2C2) antibody was described previously (9Gu Y.

Cell lysates were prepared using STEN-lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 17 Nonidet P-40). After a clarifying spin, cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Where indicated Nonidet P-40 was substituted with DDM (0.77), CHAPS (27), or SDS (17). For analysis of γ-secretase complexes DDM-solubilized membrane fractions were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation as described (7Steiner H. Winkler E. Edbauer D. Prokop S. Basset G. Yamasaki A. Kostka M. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39062-39065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Cell surface biotinylation was carried out as described (16Kaether C. Lammich S. Edbauer D. Ertl M. Rietdorf J. Capell A. Steiner H. Haass C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). For deglycosylation, cell lysates were incubated with 50 milliunits/ml endoglycosidase H (endo H) for 16 h at 37 °C in 200 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.8), 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.17 SDS) followed by immunoblot analysis. For detection of secreted Aऔ following kifunensine treatment, media were replaced, conditioned for 3 h, and analyzed for Aऔ by combined immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting using antibodies 3926/6E10. Cells were lysed as detailed above in the presence of 0.77 DDM or 17 SDS. Following a clarifying spin, cell lysates were incubated with the indicated amounts of trypsin in 150 mm sodium citrate (pH 6.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 ॖg/ml pepstatin for 30 min at 30 °C. Proteolysis was stopped by the addition of 10-fold excess amounts of soybean trypsin inhibitor, and samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis. In an attempt to identify the functionally important domains of Nct, we generated a set of deletions within the ectodomain (Fig. 1a). These cDNA constructs were investigated in a HEK 293 cell line stably expressing Swedish mutant APP (15Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Hung A.Y. Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lieberburg I. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar) and a pSUPER-based Nct-1045 (6Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8666-8671Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) small interfering RNA-encoding vector, which stably knocks down endogenous Nct expression by RNAi (Fig. 1b; lane 2). RNAi-mediated inhibition of Nct expression results in reduced PS1 CTF formation, reduced PEN-2 and APH-1aL (8Lee S.F. Shah S. Li H., Yu, C. Han W. Yu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45013-45019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) expression, the accumulation of the APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), and reduced Aऔ generation (Fig. 1b). These observations are due to the inhibition of the γ-secretase activity upon down-regulation of Nct (6Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8666-8671Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Expression of a wt Nct cDNA with a cluster of silent mutations conferring RNAi resistance led to the formation of mature Nct (Fig. 1b), which has previously been shown to be associated with the functional γ-secretase complex (6Edbauer D.

In contrast, all deletion constructs apparently formed only one Nct polypeptide (Fig. 1b), indicating a failure of maturation. To investigate if the Nct deletion variants undergo complex glycosylation like wt Nct, cell lysates were treated with endo H. As shown in Fig. 1c, only mature Nct (endogenous and exogenous) was endo H-resistant, whereas immature Nct and all deleted variants failed to become endo H-resistant. Exogenous expression of wt Nct restored PS1 CTF formation and PEN-2 and APH-1aL expression and allowed full γ-secretase function as monitored by the significantly reduced levels of APP-CTFs accompanied by robust Aऔ generation (Fig. 1b). In contrast to wt Nct, none of the deletion constructs restored PS1 CTF formation and PEN-2 or APH-1aL expression (Fig. 1b). Moreover, the deletion constructs did not allow the formation of a γ-secretase activity, because none of them reduced APP-CTF formation or increased Aऔ production (Fig.1b). Thus, all deletions within the ectodomain failed to restore γ-secretase function. This suggests an important role of not only the conserved DYIGS motif but the entire ectodomain in γ-secretase complex assembly and activity. The lack of a specific functional subdomain of Nct thus indicates that correct folding of the entire ectodomain is required for Nct function. The primary structure of Nct suggests a rather large luminal domain, which according to our findings plays a pivotal role in Nct function. To investigate if the luminal domain of functional Nct adopts a conformation, which is different from non-functional Nct, cell lysates were treated with increasing amounts of trypsin to monitor unmasking or masking of cleavage sites (18Brown A.J. Sun L. Feramisco J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the mature form of Nct, which is predominantly found in the mature γ-secretase complex (6Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8666-8671Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 12Kimberly W.T. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 28135-28142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), was selectively trypsin-resistant whereas immature Nct remained trypsin-sensitive even at the lowest concentration (Fig.2a). Mature Nct showed resistance up to concentrations of as much as 500 ॖg/ml trypsin (Fig.2a and data not shown). In contrast to mature Nct, APP, which is also a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, was sensitive to trypsin (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, the γ-secretase complex components PS1 NTF, PS1 CTF, and APH-1aL were all fully sensitive to trypsin digestion (Fig. 2a), whereas PEN-2 was found to be less sensitive (data not shown). Because APH-1aL and the PS fragments are trypsin-sensitive, Nct is not simply protected by these γ-secretase complex components. In addition, the very small PEN-2 is unlikely to protect the large Nct ectodomain. Thus, Nct appears to undergo a conformational change independent of APH-1aL, PS, and also PEN-2. After demonstrating the selective trypsin resistance of mature Nct, the deletion variants (Fig. 1a), which all fail to restore γ-secretase activity (Fig. 1b), were investigated. Interestingly, none of them displayed trypsin resistance (Fig.2b). This suggests that assembly of a biologically active γ-secretase complex is associated with the formation of a trypsin-resistant Nct variant. To further support this hypothesis, we analyzed Nct in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells derived from a PS1/2 gene knock-out. Because of the absence of PS in these cells no γ-secretase complex can be formed. As we and others have previously shown these cells are also deficient in Nct maturation (7Steiner H. Winkler E.

Bentahir M. Nyabi O. Craessaerts K. Mueller U. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus, fibroblasts derived from a PS1/2 gene knock-out are ideally suited to investigate the association of trypsin-resistant Nct with γ-secretase complex formation. Interestingly, immature Nct in PS1/2−/− cells was degraded by trypsin, whereas mature Nct in the corresponding PS1/2+/+ control cells was fully trypsin-resistant (Fig. 2c). Thus, the conversion of trypsin-sensitive to a trypsin-resistant Nct is indeed tightly associated with γ-secretase complex formation. Furthermore, the selectivity of trypsin resistance of mature Nct versusimmature/non-functional Nct suggests a major conformational change of Nct during γ-secretase complex assembly and maturation. However, the selective resistance of mature Nct does not exclude the possibility that proteases could not interact with mature Nct due to the rather large and abundant sugar side chains added during maturation. Indeed, 16 putative glycosylation sites are present in the ectodomain (3Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L. Tandon A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Chen F. Kawarai T. Supala A. Levesque L., Yu, H. Yang D.S. Holmes E. Milman P. Liang Y. Zhang D.M. Xu D.H. Sato C. Rogaev E. Smith M. Janus C. Zhang Y. Aebersold R. Farrer L.S. Sorbi S. Bruni A. Fraser P. St George-Hyslop P. Nature. 2000; 407: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). To denature and unfold mature Nct, cells were lysed in the presence of 17 SDS, and lysates were then digested with increasing amounts of trypsin. Under these conditions mature Nct became sensitive to trypsin digestion, whereas non-denatured mature Nct extracted under conditions which preserve the γ-secretase complex remained protease-resistant (Fig. 3a). However, glycosylation could protect even partially denatured mature Nct and thus indirectly prevent trypsin-mediated degradation. To exclude this possibility we blocked complex glycosylation by incubating untransfected HEK 293 cells (expressing endogenous Nct) in the presence of kifunensine, which potently inhibits mannosidase I (19Elbein A.D. Tropea J.E. Mitchell M. Kaushal G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15599-15605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3b, treatment with kifunensine strongly blocked maturation of Nct as manifested by the appearance of a novel Nct species (termed immature-like Nct, see below) migrating at lower molecular weight. However, in contrast to the immature form of Nct, the immature-like species observed upon kifunensine treatment was still trypsin-resistant like the mature fully glycosylated Nct variant (Fig.3c). These data suggest that a conformational change of Nct associated with trypsin resistance must take place upon assembly and/or maturation of the γ-secretase complex. To investigate if the γ-secretase complex is still active upon inhibition of mannosidase I, Aऔ was isolated before and after kifunensine treatment. Consistent with Herreman et al. (13Herreman A. Van Gassen G. Bentahir M. Nyabi O. Craessaerts K. Mueller U. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), Aऔ production was not inhibited by kifunensine (Fig. 3d). Moreover, expression levels of PS1 CTFs and PEN-2 were not significantly reduced by kifunensine treatment (Fig. 3e, left panel) demonstrating that kifunensine does not interfere with the assembly of the γ-secretase complex. Furthermore, immature-like Nct and PEN-2 co-immunoprecipitated with PS1 upon kifunensine treatment for 2 days (Fig. 3e,right panel). Finally, cell surface biotinylation revealed that immature-like Nct reaches the plasma membrane in cells treated with kifunensine (Fig. 3f) like endogenous Nct in untreated cells (13Herreman A.

HEK 293 cells stably transfected with wt Nct (as detailed in Fig. 1b) were extracted with DDM (which leaves the γ-secretase complex intact (6Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl.

HEK 293 cells were incubated in the presence of the indicated amounts of kifunensine, and lysates were analyzed as ina. Note that treatment with kifunensine results in the formation of a Nct species, which co-migrates with immature Nct (immature-like (iml) Nct). c, immature-like Nct generated by kifunensine treatment is trypsin-resistant. Lysates from kifunensine-treated HEK 293 cells were incubated with 20 ॖg/ml trypsin and analyzed as in a. d, generation of secreted Aऔ upon kifunensine treatment. Conditioned media of HEK 293 cells pretreated with kifunensine were collected, and Aऔ production was analyzed as in Fig. 1b. e, immature-like Nct generated by kifunensine treatment forms a complex with PS1 and PEN-2. DDM-extracted membrane fractions of HEK 293 cells were immunoprecipitated with antibody 3027 (PS1-C) and analyzed by immunoblotting as in Fig. 1b, except that PS1 CTF was analyzed using antibody BI.3D7. Direct immunoblotting (left panel) confirmed that the expression of PS1 and PEN-2 is not affected by kifunensine treatment. Moreover, kifunensine treatment does not result in accumulation of APP CTFs as observed upon inhibition of Nct expression. f, immature-like Nct generated by kifunensine treatment is transported to the plasma membrane. Kifunensine-treated HEK 293 cells were surface-biotinylated. After streptavidin precipitation, biotinylated Nct was identified by immunoblotting as in Fig. 1b. Note that without kifunensine exclusively mature Nct is biotinylated, whereas after kifunensine the immature-like Nct is preferentially surface-biotinylated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our findings demonstrate that trypsin resistance of the Nct ectodomain is associated with γ-secretase complex assembly, maturation, and activity. Thus, we conclude that γ-secretase activity requires a conformational alteration of Nct. Immature and all functionally inactive deletion mutations fail to undergo the conformational switch required for γ-secretase activity and remain trypsin-sensitive. Complex glycosylation does not protect by itself against proteolytic degradation, because its inhibition by kifunensine does not affect the protease resistance and function of Nct. In addition, binding of Nct to other γ-secretase complex components does not protect from trypsin degradation, because APH-1aL and the PS1 NTF and CTF are all sensitive to trypsin as well, whereas mature Nct is selectively resistant. Thus, non-functional Nct is structurally “activated” by a conformational alteration. The conformational alteration may be similar to that of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-activating protein (SCAP) (18Brown A.J. Sun L. Feramisco J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In the latter case cholesterol addition leads to a conformational change of SCAP, which unmasks additional cleavage sites of trypsin. Moreover, similar to the loss of function mutations of Nct (Fig. 1), mutations in SCAP also affect its conformational alteration as monitored by trypsin sensitivity (18Brown A.J. Sun L. Feramisco J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). A successful conformational change of Nct requires the presence of the complete luminal domain. All ectodomain deletions analyzed not only lead to a loss of function but also fail to undergo the conformational alteration of Nct upon γ-secretase complex assembly and maturation. Previously, a deletion of the DYIGS motif was shown to affect Aऔ production (3Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L. Tandon A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Chen F. Kawarai T. Supala A. Levesque L., Yu, H. Yang D.S. Holmes E. Milman P. Liang Y. Zhang D.M. Xu D.H. Sato C. Rogaev E. Smith M. Janus C. Zhang Y. Aebersold R. Farrer L.S. Sorbi S. Bruni A. Fraser P. St George-Hyslop P. Nature. 2000; 407: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). This is fully confirmed by our findings, which demonstrate that the same deletion (deletion construct 3 in Fig. 1a) does not restore γ-secretase activity in a Nct knock-down background. However, not only the deletion of the DYIGS motif but all other deletions investigated within the ectodomain inhibit the formation of biologically active Nct and consequently a functional γ-secretase complex. Certainly, this does not exclude the possibility that smaller deletions and point mutations may be tolerated. Taken together our findings provide the first insights into the assembly and maturation of the γ-secretase complex. Not only PS may exist as a “premature” variant (the PS holoprotein) but also Nct. In the case of Nct, “activation” is associated with a rather substantial conformational alteration that is required for γ-secretase assembly and activity. We thank Dr. C. Kaether for helpful discussions, Dr. R. Agami for the pSUPER vector, Dr. R. Nixon for the monoclonal antibody PS1N, Dr. B. De Strooper for PS1/2 deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, and Drs.

The mechanism of activation remains unresolved, and it is uncertain whether autophosphorylation contributes to activation. We describe an in vitro immunoprecipitation system demonstrating activation of ATM kinase from unirradiated extracts by preincubation with ATP. Activation is both time- and ATP concentration-dependent, other nucleotides fail to activate ATM, and DNA is not required. ATP activation is specific for ATM since it is not observed with kinase-dead ATM, it requires Mn2+, and it is inhibited by wortmannin. Exposure of activated ATM to phosphatase abrogates activity, and repeat cycles of ATP and phosphatase treatment reveal a requirement for autophosphorylation in the activation process. Phosphopeptide mapping revealed similarities between the patterns of autophosphorylation for irradiated and ATP-treated ATM. Caffeine inhibited ATM kinase activity for substrates but did not interfere with ATM autophosphorylation. ATP failed to activate either A-T and rad3-related protein (ATR) or DNA-dependent protein kinase under these conditions, supporting the specificity for ATM. These data demonstrate that ATP can specifically induce activation of ATM by a mechanism involving autophosphorylation. The relationship of this activation to DNA damage activation remains unclear but represents a useful model for understanding in vivo activation.

Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 177-202Google Scholar). Extreme sensitivity to radiation in patients undergoing radiotherapy for cancer and in cells in culture are also characteristic of this disease (3Gotoff S.P. Amirmokri E. Liebner E.J. Am. J. Dis.

Kidson C. Moss D. Nature. 1978; 274: 484-486Google Scholar). The exact basis of the radiosensitivity in A-T cells remains unknown but appears to be related to the failure to repair residual chromosomal breaks (6Cornforth M.N. Bedford J.S. Science. 1985; 227: 1589-1591Google Scholar, 7Foray N. Priestley A. Alsbeih G. Badie C. Capulas E.P. Arlett C.F. Malaise E.P. Int. J. Radiat.

In A-T cells, faulty DNA damage recognition is also accompanied by defective cell cycle checkpoint activation, which is likely to contribute to the genetic instability and cancer susceptibility in this syndrome (10Beamish H. Lavin M.F. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 65: 175-184Google Scholar, 11Morgan S.E. Kastan M.B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 1-25Google Scholar). The gene defective in A-T, ATM (A-T mutated), encodes a protein that is a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) family (12Savitsky K. Bar-Shira A. Gilad S. Rotman G. Ziv Y. Vanagaite L. Tagle D.A. Smith S. Uziel T. Sfez S. et al.Science. 1995; 268: 1749-1753Google Scholar). This group includes the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), A-T and rad3-related protein (ATR), and proteins in different organisms responsible for DNA damage recognition and cell cycle control (13Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Google Scholar). Although there is some evidence for regulation of ATM at the transcriptional and translational levels (14Keating K.E. Gueven N. Watters D. Rodemann H.P. Lavin M.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4281-4290Google Scholar), it is primarily activated as a pre-existing protein by ionizing radiation and other agents that give rise to double strand breaks in DNA, suggesting that post-translational modification may be important in its activation (15Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Google Scholar, 16Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y.

Lees-Miller S.P. Lavin M.F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 398-400Google Scholar). Changes in abundance of ATM protein in response to radiation have not been observed (18Brown K.D. Ziv Y. Sadanandan S.N. Chessa L. Collins F.S. Shiloh Y. Tagle D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1840-1845Google Scholar). Once activated, ATM phosphorylates a host of substrates, primarily involved in recognizing DNA damage or signaling this damage to cell cycle checkpoints (19Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 83: 209-254Google Scholar), but there is also evidence for non-DNA damage activation (20Yang D.O. Kastan M.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 893-898Google Scholar). Among the ATM substrates involved in DNA damage recognition are Nbs1, defective in the Nijmegen breakage syndrome (21Gatei M. Young D. Cerosaletti K.M. Desai-Mehta A. Spring K. Kozlov S. Lavin M.F.

Kondo N. Lavin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30515-30523Google Scholar). ATM also plays a central role in the activation of cell checkpoints in response to radiation damage (10Beamish H. Lavin M.F. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 65: 175-184Google Scholar,11Morgan S.E. Kastan M.B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 1-25Google Scholar). It is of some interest that this regulation occurs at multiple levels for a single checkpoint. In the case of the G1/S checkpoint, activated ATM phosphorylates p53 on serine 15 (15–17), it also phosphorylates and activates Chk2 to in turn phosphorylate p53 on serine 20 (28), which may contribute to its stabilization at least in some cell types, and by phosphorylating mdm2 on serine 395 (29Maya R. Balass M. Kim S.T. Shkedy D. Leal J.F. Shifman O. Moas M. Buschmann T. Ronai Z. Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Katzir E. Oren M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1067-1077Google Scholar), it further ensures stabilization and activation of p53 to induce p21/WAF1 and the G1/S checkpoint (30Kastan M.B. Zhan O. el-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Google Scholar, 31Khanna K.K. Beamish H. Yan J. Hobson K. Williams R. Dunn I. Lavin M.F. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 609-618Google Scholar). ATM phosphorylates Chk2, Nbs1, SMC1, and BRCA1 to achieve activation of the S phase checkpoint in parallel pathways (8Kim S. Xu B. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 560-570Google Scholar, 9Yazdi P.T. Wang Y. Zhao S. Patel N. Lee E.Y.-H.P. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 571-582Google Scholar, 32Falck J. Petrini J.H. Williams B.R. Lucas J. Bartek J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 290-294Google Scholar). Finally, Chk2 and BRCA1 are also substrates for ATM in the G2/M checkpoint (33Xu B. Kim S.T. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3445-3450Google Scholar). Although multiple substrates and pathways controlled by ATM have been identified, it remains unclear as to how double strand breaks in DNA activate its kinase activity. In the case of the related PI3-kinase, DNA-PKcs, it is recruited to DNA strand breaks and activated by the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer (34Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 503-512Google Scholar). Intriguingly, inositol hexakisphosphate stimulates DNA-PK-dependent non-homologous DNA end joining in vitro, and this appears to be achieved by specific interaction with Ku70/Ku80 (35Hanakahi L.A. Bartlet-Jones M. Chappell C. Pappin D. West S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 721-729Google Scholar). Another member of the PI3-kinase family mTOR is altered in its activity by small molecules, acting as a sensor of ATP concentration (36Dennis P.B. Jaeschke A. Saitoh M. Fowler B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 2001; 294: 1102-1105Google Scholar). Protein kinase activity can also be regulated by autophosphorylation, which has been observed with DNA damage signaling PI3-kinases (37Keegan K.S. Holtzman D.A. Plug A.W. Christenson E.R. Brainerd E.E. Flaggs G. Bentley N.J. Taylor E.M. Meyn M.S. Moss S.B. Carr A.M. Ashley T. Hoekstra M.F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2423-2437Google Scholar). However, only DNA-PK autophosphorylation was demonstrated to have an effect on the functional activity of the enzyme in a DNA-dependent manner (38Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation causes inactivation of DNA-PK kinase activity and disruption of the DNA-PKcs-Ku complex. Subsequently, it was shown that phosphatase treatment activated DNA-PK (39Douglas P. Moorhead G.B. Ye R. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18992-18998Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation has also been observed with ATM immunoprecipitated from irradiated control cells and with ATM expressed in baculovirus (25Gatei M. Scott S.P. Filippovitch I. Soronika N. Lavin M.F. Weber B. Khanna K.K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3299-3304Google Scholar, 40Scott S.P. Zhang N. Khanna K.K. Khromykh A. Hobson K. Watters D. Lavin M.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 144-148Google Scholar), and there is evidence using 32P-labeling in vivo to support this (23Lim D.S. Kim S.T. Xu B. Maser R.S. Lin J. Petrini J.H. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2000; 404: 613-617Google Scholar, 41Chen G. Lee E.Y.H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33693-33697Google Scholar), but its importance to ATM function has not been addressed. The putative autophosphorylation sites on ATM were suggested based on consensus motifs expected to be recognized by ATM in oriented peptide libraries (42O'Neill T. Dwyer A.J. Ziv Y. Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. Abraham R.H. Lai J.H. Hill D. Shiloh Y. Cantley L.C. Rathbun G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22719-22727Google Scholar). These include Ser-2941, Ser-1635, and Ser-440, but phosphorylation of these sites in vivo has not been reported. To investigate the activation of ATM and the possible involvement of autophosphorylation in this process, we have established an in vitro system involving immunoprecipitation of ATM and activation by ATP. Cell culture medium RPMI 1640 was from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum was from JRH Biosciences. Microcystin LR was from Biomol Research Laboaratories, Inc. (Sapphire Bioscience). λ-Protein phosphatase (λ-PPase) was from New England Biolabs. ATP, ADP, AMP, NADP, 5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), GTP, and okadaic acid were from Sigma. Wortmannin and caffeine were from Fluka Chemie AG. Protein G-Sepharose 4 fast flow, protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, and Redivue [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity ∼3000 Ci/Mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences. Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagent was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with peroxidase were from Silenus/Chemicon Australia. For ATM Western blotting, ATM 2C1 monoclonal antibody (GeneTex) was used. For ATR Western blotting and immunoprecipitations, ATR PA1–450 antibody (Affinity Bioreagents) was employed. Western blotting and immunoprecipitations for DNA-PK were performed with Ab-2 monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products). All other reagents were from standard suppliers or as indicated in the text. Lymphoblastoid cell lines established from normal (C3ABR) and A-T patients (L3 and AT1ABR) were used. We acknowledge Yosef Shiloh, Tel Aviv, Israel for the L3 cell line that fails to produce ATM protein due to a homozygous truncation mutation (C103T). AT1ABR is an A-T cell line homozygous for the 7636del9 mutation that produces near full-length ATM protein that is kinase-dead (25Gatei M. Scott S.P. Filippovitch I. Soronika N. Lavin M.F. Weber B. Khanna K.K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3299-3304Google Scholar). The Lymphoblastoid cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), and 100 units/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). All irradiations were performed at room temperature using an IBL437C irradiator (2.4 Gy/min, Compagnie ORIS Industrie). Construction of GST fusion proteins containing fragments of ATM protein was described previously (17Khanna K.K. Keating K.E. Kozlov S. Scott S. Gatei M. Hobson K. Taya Y. Gabrielli B. Chan D. Lees-Miller S.P. Lavin M.F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 398-400Google Scholar). GST-ATM2 fusion protein (ATM amino acids 250–522) was expressed according to standard protocol (43Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Google Scholar). Full-length GST-ATM2 was isolated by preparative SDS-PAGE, eluted from gel slices, and used for sheep immunization according to standard protocols. Antibodies were purified from collected sheep sera by two consecutive affinity chromatography steps. GST-Affi-Gel 15 and GST-ATM2-Affi-Gel 15 affinity columns were synthesized according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Firstly, serum diluted 1/10 in phosphate-buffered saline was applied to a GST-Affi-Gel 15 column to deplete it from anti-GST antibodies. Secondly, serum was passed through a GST-ATM2-Affi-Gel 15 column, and ATM-specific antibodies were eluted, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% sodium azide, and concentrated by ultrafiltration on Ultrafree-4 BioMax 30K centrifugal filter (Millipore). Affinity-purified antibodies were used in all subsequent immunoprecipitations and kinase assays. Cells were collected by diluting with an equal volume of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and 1 mm NaF followed by centrifugation. After a brief wash with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed immediately for use in immune complex kinase assays. ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK kinase assays were performed as described (16Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D.

Cells were lysed by rotating for 45 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 13,000 × gfor 10 min. Cell lysates were precleared by constant mixing for 1 h with protein A/G-Sepharose. 1 mg of precleared lysate was used for immunoprecipitation with ATM, ATR, or DNA-PK antibodies (see above) overnight with constant mixing. Immune complexes were absorbed onto protein G-Sepharose and washed. After two washes with ice-cold lysis buffer, one wash with high salt buffer (lysis buffer with 0.5m NaCl), and two washes with basic kinase buffer, immunocomplexes were subjected to procedures outlined below or used directly in kinase reactions. All washing buffers contained 1 mm Na3VaO4, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer as described (44Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382Google Scholar), and kinase reaction was carried out for 30 min at 30 °C either for autophosphorylation or for substrate phosphorylation of 1 μg of GST-p53 1–44. Linear reaction conditions were established for ATM kinase assays. The reaction was stopped by addition of 5 μl of 6× SDS gel loading buffer. The reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE. A biphasic gel system similar to one described by Ziv et al. (46Ziv Y. Banin S. Lim D.S. Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. Shiloh S. Methods in Molecular Biology: Stress Response: Methods and Protocols.

The top part of the separating gel (5%) was used for immunoblot analysis of ATM, ATR, or DNA-PK to give an accurate estimation of the amount of kinase present in the reaction. The bottom part of the gel (12%) was stained with colloidal Coomassie G-250 to visualize the amount of p53 substrate present in the kinase reaction. Gels were dried onto a Whatmann 3 MM filter paper and exposed to an x-ray film (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.) with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. Radioactivity was quantitated by excising ATM and p53 bands from the gel and counting the incorporated 32P by liquid scintillation counting. To prephosphorylate ATM prior to kinase reaction, washed protein G-bound ATM immunocomplexes were incubated with 1 mm ATP (or concentrations as indicated in the figure legends) in the following phosphorylation buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 20 μm microcystin. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, washed three times in ice cold basic kinase buffer to remove the ATP, and then directly used in kinase assays as described above. Treatment of ATM immunocomplexes with ADP, AMP, NADP, AMP-PNP, GTP, dNTPs, and polyADP ribose was performed as outlined for ATP. Wortmannin was dissolved in Me2SO to make a 20 mm solution, which was stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Wortmannin was used at 1 μm concentration in the reaction conditions described above. Caffeine was prepared fresh as a 100 mm solution in water. ATM immunocomplexes were incubated on ice with a range of concentrations of caffeine as indicated in phosphorylation buffer for 15 min and then subjected to the reaction conditions described above. Protein G-bound ATM immunocomplexes were additionally washed twice with basic phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MnCl2) and then incubated with 100 units of λ-protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of ice-cold basic kinase buffer containing 10 mmNa3VoO4 and 10 mm NaF. Phosphatase-treated immune complexes were washed twice with basic kinase buffer and used in kinase assays as described above. Protein G-bound ATM-immunocomplexes from unirradiated, irradiated, and ATP-treated samples were subjected to the autophosphorylation reaction conditions described above. 32P-labeled ATM was separated by 5% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. The ATM band was excised and subjected to in-gel digestion using trypsin (sequencing grade,Promega). Peptides were extracted, and two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping on thin-layer cellulose plates was performed as described (47Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Wu R. Methods in Enzymology. 201. Academic Press Inc., San Diego1991: 110-149Google Scholar) using electrophoresis at pH 1.9 in the first dimension followed by chromatography in buffer containingn-butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/water (15:10:3:12). Plates were exposed to x-ray film with an intensifying screen at −70 °C to detect phosphopeptides. We initially determined whether ATM undergoes autophosphorylation in response to ionizing radiation using immunoprecipitation with anti-ATM antibody. Autophosphorylation of ATM was observed by 5 min after irradiation, and this did not appear to increase further up to 15 min after irradiation (Fig.1 A). Indeed, no increase in autophosphorylation was observed up to 1 h after irradiation (results not shown). On average, the extent of this increase was 2-fold as determined by scintillation counting of the ATM bands. As expected, ATM kinase activity toward p531–44 substrate increased in parallel, with time (Fig. 1 B). No change in the amount of ATM protein occurred under these conditions. These data, together with previous results showing that ATM is a phosphoprotein (41Chen G. Lee E.Y.H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33693-33697Google Scholar), would predict that phosphatase treatment would abolish ATM kinase activity. The results in Fig. 1 C demonstrate that when ATM is immunoprecipitated from irradiated cell extracts and subsequently treated with phosphatase, most of its kinase activity is lost (lanes 3 and 4). This is not an artifact due to residual phosphatase since addition of 32P-labeled p53 to this incubation did not result in any release of free 32P (results not shown). We also observed a decrease in the capacity of ATM to autophosphorylate after pretreatment with phosphatase (Fig.1 D). Thus it appears that phosphorylation status of ATM is critical to its kinase activity. Previous data have revealed that when inactive forms of various protein kinases are incubated with unlabelled ATP, they became activated by mechanisms involving autophosphorylation (48Katoh T. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3039-3044Google Scholar, 49Szczepanowska J. Zhang X. Herring C.J. Qin J. Korn E.D. Brezeska H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Since we have shown in Fig. 1that autophosphorylation appears to be important for ATM activation, we rationalized that ATM protein, immunoprecipitated from unirradiated cell extracts, had the potential to be activated by significantly higher concentrations of ATP than those utilized to measure ATM kinase under standard conditions. Immunoprecipitated ATM protein from unirradiated extracts was incubated with unlabelled ATP (1 mm) for 30 min at 30 °C followed by washing out excess ATP and carrying out ATM kinase activity by standard assay. Under these conditions, we observed a dramatic increase in ATM kinase activity after preincubation with unlabelled ATP (Fig.2). The amount of ATM kinase activity exceeded that observed with ATM from irradiated extracts, 10-fold as compared with ∼2-fold (Fig. 2,lanes 2 and 3). A further increase in kinase activity was also observed where ATM from irradiated extracts was preincubated with unlabelled ATP, and the overall extent of activation was approximately the same in both cases (Fig. 2, lanes 2and 4). These results suggest that after irradiation, only a proportion of ATM protein is activated, but in the presence of excess ATP in vitro, all of the molecules are activated. It is well established thatin vitro ATM kinase activity has a requirement for Mn2+ (15Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y.

Douglas P. Goodarzi A.A. Pelley J. Taya Y. Lavin M.F. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7803-7810Google Scholar). The results in Fig.3 A show that preincubation with ATP activates ATM kinase from unirradiated cell extracts in the presence of MnCl2, but in its absence, no activation is observed. Additional activation of ATM from irradiated extracts was seen with ATP, and again, this was Mn2+-dependent (Fig.3 B). Wortmannin, when included in the preincubation step with ATP, completely abolished activity (Fig. 3 C). No activation was obtained when ATP was incubated with immunoprecipitates from an A-T cell line expressing mutant protein (Fig. 3 D,lanes 3 and 4). This A-T cell line has an in-frame 9-nucleotide deletion (7636del9) upstream from the kinase domain of ATM and expresses a less stable mutant form of ATM (middle panel). A second A-T cell line, L3, homozygous for a truncating mutation at nucleotide 103 and not producing ATM protein, also failed to show a response to ATP (Fig. 3 D, lanes 7 and 8), supporting specificity for ATM in this activation. To define in more detail the dependence for ATP in ATM activation, we carried out ATP concentration and time course experiments. The results in Fig.4 A demonstrate that ATP concentrations of 50 μm and above activate ATM kinase after a 30-min preincubation. Activation was evident after a 5-min preincubation with 1 mm ATP, reaching a maximum by 30 min (Fig. 4 B). Comparison is made with the effect of radiation (lanes 1 and 2) Preincubation with ATP for 30 min followed by an increasing time of incubation in [γ32P[ATP led to a gradual increase in p53 substrate phosphorylation (Fig. 4 C). To determine whether ATM activation required ATP hydrolysis, immunoprecipitated ATM was preincubated with a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue, AMP-PNP. In contrast to preincubation with ATP, AMP-PNP failed to activate ATM kinase toward p53 substrate (Fig.5, lane 4). Substitution of ATP with GTP in the preincubation reaction did not cause any significant change in the level of ATM kinase activity (data not shown). Only ADP, dATP, and TTP had any appreciable effect on activity, and these were considerably less effective than ATP (Fig. 5). Addition of sonicated DNA to the preincubation step or to the incubation mix did not alter the kinase activity (results not shown). In addition, DNase treatment of the ATM immunoprecipitates did not prevent ATP activation of ATM (results not shown). To further confirm that autophosphorylation is an inherent part of ATM activation, we carried out successive treatments with ATP and phosphatase with immunoprecipitated ATM from irradiated and unirradiated extracts. As observed above, ATP activated ATM kinase from unirradiated extracts, and subsequent phosphatase treatment abolished this capacity for activation (Fig. 6 A,lanes 3 and 4). However, it was possible to restore activity after phosphatase treatment and washing away excess phosphatase by incubating again with ATP prior to carrying out the kinase assay (Fig. 6 A, lane 5). This was also the case for immunoprecipitates from irradiated extracts (Fig.6 A, right panel). Increasing ATP concentrations over the range 0–2 mm failed to show a change in ATM autophosphorylation either for irradiated or for unirradiated immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6 B). This can be explained by having different levels of activation of ATM at different ATP concentrations. In the less activated case, at lower ATP preincubation concentrations, more sites would be available for 32P incorporation in the subsequent autophosphorylation, whereas at higher ATP concentrations, fewer sites would be unphosphorylated, but the enzyme would have more activity. The end result would represent little change in inc"

Because hyperglycemia contributes to endothelial dysfunction and decreased NO availability in types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus, we have studied the effects of high glucose (25 mm, 48 h) on insulin signaling pathways that regulate NO production in human aortic endothelial cells. High glucose inhibited insulin-stimulated NO synthesis but was without effect on NO synthesis stimulated by increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentration. This was accompanied by reduced expression of IRS-2 and attenuated insulin-stimulated recruitment of PI3K to IRS-1 and IRS-2, yet insulin-stimulated PKB activity and phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177 were unaffected. Inhibition of insulin-stimulated NO synthesis by high glucose was unaffected by an inhibitor of PKC. Furthermore, high glucose down-regulated the expression of CAP and Cbl, and insulin-stimulated Cbl phosphorylation, components of an insulin signaling cascade previously characterized in adipocytes. These data suggest that high glucose specifically inhibits insulin-stimulated NO synthesis and down-regulates some aspects of insulin signaling, including the CAP-Cbl signaling pathway, yet this is not a result of reduced PKB-mediated eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1177. Therefore, we propose that phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177 is not sufficient to stimulate NO production in cells cultured at 25 mm glucose.

However, other studies have demonstrated the opposite effects of experimental hyperglycemia on NO production in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) (19Cosentino F. Hishikawa K. Katusic Z.S. Lüscher T.F. Circulation. 1997; 96: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Additionally, a recent report has suggested that acute (15–30 min) stimulation with high glucose inhibits insulin-stimulated NO production as a result of reduced eNOS serine phosphorylation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (20Schnyder B. Pittet M. Durand J. Schnyder-Candrian S. Am. J.

PI3K stimulation is necessary but not sufficient for insulin-stimulated glucose transport in adipocytes (21Wiese R.J. Mastick C.C. Lazar D.F. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Recent studies in adipocytes have demonstrated a novel insulin signaling pathway required in parallel with PI3K activation to stimulate glucose transport (22Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M.

In this pathway, Cbl is recruited to the insulin receptor by interaction with the adapter protein CAP. Upon insulin stimulation Cbl becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated, and the CAP-Cbl complex dissociates from the insulin receptor and moves to a caveolin- and flotillin-rich lipid raft subdomain of the plasma membrane (22Baumann C.A.

Our results suggest that insulin-stimulated NO production is specifically abolished by culture in high glucose. Importantly, we found that there was no reduction in PKB activity, total phosphorylation of eNOS, or specific phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177 in response to insulin that could account for this inhibition. Therefore, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177 is not sufficient to stimulate NO production in endothelial cells cultured in 25 mm glucose. We also demonstrate that HAECs express CAP, Cbl, C3G, and flotillin. Culture of HAECs in high glucose concentrations resulted in reduced expression of CAP and Cbl and inhibited insulin-stimulated Cbl phosphorylation. We propose that the CAP-Cbl pathway may represent a candidate parallel pathway required in addition to PKB activation for insulin-stimulated NO synthesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Cryopreserved HAECs and cell culture media were obtained from TCS Cellworks (Botolph Claydon, UK).

Prior to use the cells were maintained in medium containing 5 or 25 mm glucose for 48 h. During this period, culture medium containing 5 mm glucose was supplemented with 20 mm mannitol to maintain osmolarity. The cells were used for experiments between passages 3 and 6.Nitric Oxide Release—The cells cultured in 6-well plates in medium containing either glucose concentration were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 2 ml/well Krebs-Ringer-HEPES (KRH) buffer (119 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm KH2PO4, 100 μm l-arginine, 5 or 25 mm glucose) at 37 °C. The medium was removed and replaced with 1 ml of fresh KRH buffer in the presence or absence of insulin or A23187. Aliquots (100 μl) of the medium were removed after various incubation times and refluxed in glacial acetic acid containing NaI. Under these conditions, NO2−, a stable breakdown product of NO, is quantitatively reduced to NO. NO-specific chemiluminescence was then analyzed using a Sievers 280A NO meter. The appropriate control experiments were performed in the presence of the eNOS inhibitor, l-NMMA. NO production (adjusted for l-NMMA-insensitive production) is expressed per mg of protein.Preparation of HAEC Lysates—The cells cultured in 10-cm-diameter dishes in medium containing either glucose concentration were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 5 ml of KRH buffer containing 5 or 25 mm glucose.

The medium was removed, and 0.5 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 at 4 °C, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (v/v) glycerol) was added. The cell extract was scraped off and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. The extracts were vortex-mixed and centrifuged (14,000 × g, 3 min, 4 °C). The supernatants were snap frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C prior to use.32P Labeling of HAECs—The cells cultured in 10-cm-diameter dishes in medium containing either glucose concentration were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 5 ml of phosphate-free KRH buffer containing 0.2 mCi/ml 32PO43− and 5 or 25mm glucose. After incubation in the presence or absence of insulin (100 nm) for 5 min, the medium was removed, and the cell lysates were prepared.Immunoprecipitation of IRS-1 and IRS-2—HAEC lysate (50 μg) was added to 20 μl of 25% (v/v) protein A-Sepharose prebound to 2.5 μg of rabbit anti-IRS-1 or anti-IRS-2 antibodies, and the volume was made up to 300 μl with buffer A and mixed for2hat4 °C on a rotating mixer. The mixture was then centrifuged (14,000 × g,30s,4 °C), and the pellet was washed three times with 1 ml of buffer A at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose.Immunoprecipitation and Assay of PKB—HAEC lysate (50 μg) was added to 20 μl of 25% (v/v) protein G-Sepharose prebound to 5 μg of sheep anti-PKB antibody, and the volume was made up to 300 μl with buffer A and mixed for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating mixer.

As shown, insulin (100 nm) rapidly stimulated NO synthesis in HAECs cultured in 5 mm glucose. Insulin-stimulated NO production could be demonstrated at concentrations as low as 5 nm and was maximal at 100 nm (not shown), a concentration at which all further experiments were performed. In contrast, insulin had no significant effect on NO synthesis in HAECs cultured in 25 mm glucose. There was no significant difference in basal NO synthesis at either glucose concentration. To investigate whether this inhibitory effect of hyperglycemia was restricted to insulin-stimulated NO synthesis, we next examined the effect of culture glucose concentration on NO synthesis stimulated by the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187 (Fig. 1B). As shown, A23187 rapidly stimulated NO synthesis in HAECs cultured in either 5 or 25 mm glucose. There was no significant difference between A23187-stimulated NO production at either glucose culture concentration.In an attempt to identify differences between HAECs cultured in either glucose concentration that could account for the observed inhibition of insulin-stimulated NO production, we characterized the expression of proteins involved in insulin signaling in HAECs cultured in either glucose concentration. Quantitative analysis of Western blots illustrated that there was no significant difference in the expression of IRS-1 (Fig. 2), PI3K (p85 and p110β subunits), PTEN, PDK-1, PKBα, or eNOS in HAECs cultured in either 5 or 25 mm glucose (data not shown). However, expression of IRS-2 in cells cultured in 25 mm glucose was reduced to 29 ± 19% (n = 6, p < 0.01) of that in HAECs cultured in 5 mm glucose (Fig. 2). No expression of the p110α/γ subunit isoforms of PI3K or PKBβ protein could be demonstrated in HAECs.Fig. 2Effects of culture glucose concentration on expression of IRS isoforms. HAEC lysates were prepared from cells cultured for 48 h in medium containing 5 or 25 mm glucose. A, lysate proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the antibodies indicated. A Western blot is shown of three independent samples. B, densitometric analysis of Western blots reveals no significant difference of IRS-1 expression, but IRS-2 expression (* in A) was reduced to 29 ± 19% (n = 6, p < 0.01) of that in HAEC lysates cultured in 5 mm glucose.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether there were any differences in the activity of the previously characterized insulin signaling pathway in HAECs cultured in 5 or 25 mm glucose, we characterized the recruitment of PI3K to IRSs in HAECs cultured in either glucose concentration under basal and insulin-stimulated conditions. Insulin-stimulated recruitment of PI3K to IRS-1 is reduced by 24 ± 7% (n = 6, p < 0.01) in HAECs cultured in 25 mm glucose, compared with those cultured in 5 mm glucose (Fig. 3). Insulin also stimulated the recruitment of PI3K to IRS-2 in cells cultured in 5 mm glucose but could not be demonstrated in cells cultured in 25 mm glucose (Fig. 3A). We next characterized the effects of insulin on PKB activity in HAECs cultured in either glucose concentration. Stimulation of HAECs with insulin resulted in the time-dependent activation of PKBα, maximal by 10 min (not shown). Insulin-stimulated PKB activity was maximal at 100 nm and could be demonstrated at concentrations as low as 1 nm (data not shown). PKBβ activity could not be detected in HAECs by immunoprecipitation kinase assays with a PKBβ-specific antibody. Culture of HAECs at 25 mm glucose had no significant effect on total insulin-stimulated PKBα activity, compared with HAECs cultured in 5 mm glucose, although basal PKB activity was significantly increased (2.4-fold, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4).Fig. 3Effects of culture glucose concentration on insulin-stimulated recruitment of PI3K to IRSs. HAEC lysates were prepared from cells cultured for 48 h in medium containing 5 or 25 mm glucose. A, IRS-1 or IRS-2 were immunoprecipitated (IP) from HAEC lysates prepared after incubation with 100 nm insulin for 5 min. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with rabbit anti-PI3K (p85 subunit) antibodies. A representative Western blot is shown of three independent samples. B, quantification of PI3K recruitment to IRS-1 revealed that insulin stimulated PI3K recruitment to IRS-1 in cells cultured in 5 or 25 mm glucose (2.4-fold, n = 6, p < 0.01 and 1.4-fold, n = 6, p < 0.01, respectively). Insulin-stimulated PI3K recruitment to IRS-1 was reduced in cells cultured in 25 mm glucose to 71 ± 19% (n = 6, p < 0.01 compared with 5 mm glucose + insulin).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Effects of culture glucose concentration on insulin-stimulated PKBα activity. HAEC lysates were prepared from cells cultured for 48 h in medium containing 5 or 25 mm glucose. PKBα was immunoprecipitated from HAEC lysates prepared from cells incubated in the presence (hatched bars) or absence (filled bars) of 100 nm insulin for 5 min. PKBα activity was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results shown are the means ± S.D. from three independent experiments. Insulin-stimulated PKB activity was not significantly different after culture in either glucose concentration. Basal PKB activity was increased in cells cultured in 25 mm glucose by 2.4-fold (p < 0.05 compared with 5 mm glucose).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether phosphorylation of eNOS was altered by culture glucose concentration, we determined the total phosphorylation of immunoprecipitates from 32P-labeled HAECs. Insulin stimulated eNOS phosphorylation in cells cultured in either 5 or 25 mm glucose (1.6-fold, p < 0.05 and 1.4-fold, p < 0.05, respectively, n = 3) (Fig. 5). There was no significant difference in basal or insulin-stimulated eNOS phosphorylation at either glucose concentration. To determine whether insulin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of eNOS, we used a phosphotyrosine antibody on Western blots of eNOS immunoprecipitates from HAEC lysates. No anti-phosphotyrosinereactive species of the correct molecular mass was detected in lysates prepared from cells cultured in either glucose concentration in the presence or absence of insulin (not shown). To determine whether phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177 was altered by culture glucose concentration we used a phospho-Ser1177-specific antibody. Insulin stimulated phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177 in HAECs cultured in either 5 or 25 mM glucose (1.6-fold, p < 0.05 and 2.4-fold, p < 0.01, respectively, n = 6) (Fig. 6). There was no significant difference in basal or insulin-stimulated Ser1177 phosphorylation at either glucose concentration.Fig. 5Effects of culture glucose concentration on insulin-stimulated eNOS phosphorylation. HAEC lysates were prepared from cells cultured for 48 h in medium containing 5 or 25 mm glucose prior to incubation in media containing 0.2 mCi/ml 32PO43− and subsequent incubation with insulin (100 nm) for 5 min. eNOS was immunoprecipitated from HAEC lysates, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting with anti-eNOS antibodies or PhosphorImager analysis.

Katai N. King G.L. Diabetes Med. 2001; 18: 945-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been proposed that activation of PKBβ1 inhibits insulin-stimulated eNOS expression in BAECs (26Kuboki K. Jiang Z.Y. Takahara N. Ha S.W. Igarashi M. Yamauchi T. Feener E.P.

We therefore characterized the expression of PKC isoforms and phosphorylation of eNOS at Thr495 in HAECs cultured in either glucose concentration.

The majority of TNFR1 molecules are localized to the Golgi apparatus. Soluble forms of TNFR1 (as well as of TNFR2) can be shed from the EC surface and inhibit TNF actions. The relationships among cell surface, Golgi-associated, and shed forms of TNFR1 are unclear. Here we report that histamine causes transient loss of surface TNFR1, TNFR1 shedding, and mobilization of TNFR1 molecules from the Golgi in cultured human EC. The Golgi pool of TNFR1 serves both to replenish cell surface receptors and as a source of shed receptor. Histamine-induced shedding is blocked by TNF-α protease inhibitor, an inhibitor of TNF-α-converting enzyme, and through the H1 receptor via a MEK-1/p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Cultured EC with histamine-induced surface receptor loss become transiently refractory to TNF. Histamine injection into human skin engrafted on immunodeficient mice similarly caused shedding of TNFR1 and diminished TNF-mediated induction of endothelial adhesion molecules. These results both clarify relationships among TNFR1 populations and reveal a novel anti-inflammatory activity of histamine.

Pober J.S. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 70: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). TNFR1 is the predominant receptor involved in new EC gene expression, although TNFR2 may increase the sensitivity of EC to TNF (2Slowik M.R. De Luca L.G. Fiers W. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1724-1730PubMed Google Scholar). New gene transcription results from activation of parallel signaling pathways involving several protein kinases, notably IκB kinase (IKK), various MAP kinases (including c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p42/44 MAP kinase and p38 MAP kinase), and protein kinase B (also known as Akt) (1Madge L.A. Pober J.S. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 70: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). IKK is central to the TNF activation response because this kinase uniquely phosphorylates IκB proteins, such as IκBα, triggering their degradation and thereby releasing sequestered transcription factor, NFκB (3Ledgerwood E.C. Pober J.S. Bradley J.R. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 1041-1050PubMed Google Scholar). NFκB is essential for the transcription of almost all of the pro-inflammatory gene products induced by TNF. IKK activation through TNFR1 is initiated by recruitment of the adaptor protein TNF receptor-associated death domain-containing protein to the cytoplasmic death domain of the ligand-occupied receptor molecule. Although the majority of TNFR1 molecules are located within the Golgi apparatus, TNF receptor-associated death domain associates with surface-expressed but not Golgi-associated receptors (4Bradley J.R. Thiru S. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 27-32PubMed Google Scholar, 5Jones S.J. Ledgerwood E.C. Prins J.B. Galbraith J. Johnson D.R. Pober J.S. Bradley J.R. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1042-1048PubMed Google Scholar). The significance of the Golgi pool of TNFR1 molecules is unclear. One hypothesis is that it may act as a reservoir to increase surface receptor expression density, thereby sensitizing EC to the actions of TNF. There is precedence for this idea in smooth muscle cells, in which the TNF receptor family member Fas localizes predominantly to the Golgi, from where it can be translocated to the cell surface, thereby sensitizing cells to Fas ligand-induced killing (6Bennett M. Macdonald K. Chan S.W. Luzio J.P. Simari R. Weissberg P. Science. 1998; 282: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Both types of TNF receptors can be released from the cell surface by the actions of a metalloproteinase called TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE) (7Reddy P. Slack J.L. Davis R. Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Blanton R.A. Shows D. Peschon J.J. Black R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14608-14614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The shed extracellular domains of the receptors are soluble in water and are referred to as sTNFR1 or sTNFR2 (8Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Receptor shedding, which can reduce the surface expression of TNFR1 and TNFR2, may desensitize cells to TNF actions. Additionally, because TNFRs maintain their ability to bind ligand, they may serve as physiological neutralizing agents for TNF (9Van Zee K.J. Kohno T. Fischer E. Rock C.S. Moldawer L.L. Lowry S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4845-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 10Hale K.K. Smith C.G. Baker S.L. Vanderslice R.W. Squires C.H. Gleason T.M. Tucker K.K. Kohno T. Russell D.A. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 26-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), further dampening inflammatory responses. This idea is supported by the observation that patients with structural mutations in TNFR1 that prevent shedding by TACE are hypersensitive to TNF (11Galon J. Aksentijevich I. McDermott M.F. O'Shea J.J. Kastner D.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Thus a second potential function of the Golgi pool of TNFR1 molecules is to serve as a reservoir for sTNFR1, reducing EC responses. TACE, which was initially identified as pro-inflammatory because of its role in TNF secretion (12Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L.

Nature. 1997; 385: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar), may be either pro- or anti-inflammatory depending on whether it acts on an effector (e.g. macrophage) or target (e.g. endothelial) cell, releasing ligand or receptors, respectively. Pharmacological studies have suggested that TACE activity in cells may be regulated by several mechanisms. For example, TNFR shedding in many cell types can be initiated by phorbol esters, implicating a role for PKC, the target of phorbol ester action (7Reddy P. Slack J.L. Davis R. Cerretti D.P.

Shedding of amyloid precursor protein from HEK293 cells, which is also mediated by TACE, is blocked by inhibitors of MEK-1, the activator of p42 and p44 MAP kinases (16Mills J. Laurent C.D. Lam F. Beyreuther K. Ida N. Pelech S.L. Reiner P.B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9415-9422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, PKC may lie upstream of MEK-1. Salicylates, at concentrations that induce apoptosis, trigger TNFR shedding from EC via a pathway blocked by an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase (17Madge L.A. Sierra-Honigmann M.R. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13643-13649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether these differences are agonist-specific, cell-specific, or both. Physiological activators of TACE in EC are unknown. Histamine is a vasoactive autacoid, released by activated human mast cells or basophils, that produces a rapid but transient EC response. Two well described effects of histamine are EC contraction, resulting in loss of permselectivity and subsequent development of edema, and EC synthesis of vasodilators, such as prostaglandin I2 and NO (18Bolz S.S. Pohl U. Cardiovasc. Res. 1997; 36: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Histamine-mediated vascular leak and vasodilation underlie the classic “wheal and flare” response of allergy. Histamine also stimulates regulated secretion of stored EC proteins, such as von Willebrand factor and surface translocation of others such as P-selectin (19Asako H. Kurose I. Wolf R. DeFrees S. Zheng Z.L. Phillips M.L. Paulson J.C. Granger D.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1508-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Previous studies (20Zavoico G.B. Ewenstein B.M. Schafer A.I. Pober J.S. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 3993-3999PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that TNF pretreatment potentiates some histamine responses, such as vasodilator synthesis, but not others such as von Willebrand factor secretion. Histamine acts through trimeric G protein-coupled receptors (H1, H2, H3, or H4) and may elicit calcium transients, protein kinase C activation, and MAP kinase activation (21Robinson A.J. Dickenson J.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 1378-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Histamine does not activate IKK in EC and may actually inhibit activation of NFκB via calcium-dependent production of NO (22Spiecker M. Darius H. Kaboth K. Hubner F. Liao J.K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 732-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the effect of histamine on TNFR1 expression in human EC. We find that this agent causes both mobilization of receptor from the Golgi pool and shedding of receptor into the medium. This action appears to utilize H1 type receptors and is mediated by a MEK-1/p42 and p44 MAP kinase pathway. These responses correlate with transiently diminished TNF-mediated endothelial activation, identifying a new function for histamine and supporting the hypotheses that the Golgi receptor pool is a reservoir for both cell surface and shed receptors.

Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) were isolated from human umbilical cords and serially cultured in modified M199 culture medium, containing 20% v/v heat-inactivated bovine fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 μg/ml heparin sodium salt, 30 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement, 2 mm l-glutamine, 60 units/ml penicillin, and 0.5 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C, in 5% CO2 on gelatin-coated tissue culture plastic (Appleton Woods, UK) as described previously (23Bradley J.R. Thiru S. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 627-641PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were used at passages 2–4. Such cultures are free of detectable leukocytes by immunostaining for CD45. Measurement of Cell Surface TNF Receptor Expression by Flow Cytometry—HUVEC were seeded into 6-well tissue culture plates (1.5 × 105 cells per well), and 24 h later the confluent cells were treated with histamine 100 μm for 0.5–16 h. For experiments using brefeldin A (10 μg/ml) or TAPI (25 μm), EC were pretreated with either agent for half an hour before treatment with histamine. After each treatment, cells were harvested using a nonenzymatic cell suspension solution (EDTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution), washed twice with 1% FCS in PBS, and then incubated with primary antibody on ice for 40 min. Cells were then washed twice and incubated with secondary antibody for another 40 min on ice. EC were then washed three times and resuspended in 500 μl of 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Fixed cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using FACSCalibur machine (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using WinMDI 2.8 software. Detection of Soluble Receptors by ELISA—HUVEC were seeded into 6-well tissue culture plate as described above 24 h before each experiment. Cells were then washed in media containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS and then treated with histamine or PMA for 1 h. In experiments using brefeldin A or TAPI, the agents were added half an hour before addition of histamine or PMA; other agents were added 15 min before treatment with histamine or PMA. After treatment the media from each well were collected and centrifuged at 1500 rpm (380 × g) for 5 min, and the clarified supernatants were collected and stored at –20 °C for 1–2 weeks until analyzed. ELISAs for sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 were performed following the manufacturer's instructions. Developed assay plates were read at wavelength 450 and 540 nm with Titertek Multiscan plate reader, and the results were calculated using a stand- ard curve generated each time an assay was performed.

The membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent, NHS-SS-Biotin was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in PBS, and the cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated with complete media at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were then treated with 100 μm histamine or 0.1 μm PMA for 30 min. After treatment, the supernatants were removed, and the cells were then lysed using 25 mm Tris base, 135 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, protein inhibitor mixture, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25 μm TAPI for 30 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min, and the clarified supernatant was transferred to tubes containing Neutravidin beads. After incubation for 1 h the beads were centrifuged down and washed. The supernatant (cytosolic fraction) or beads (containing the biotinylated membrane proteins) were boiled in sample buffer (125 mm Tris/HCl, 15% sucrose, 4% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 4% mercaptoethanol) for 3 min and analyzed by immunoblotting as described below. IκB-α Degradation Assay—HUVEC were grown to confluence in 6-well plates and then treated with or without 100 μm histamine for various time points. The medium containing shed receptors was then removed, and complete medium with or without 50 units/ml TNF or 1 ng/ml IL-1 was added for 15 min. (For the experiment of effect of TAPI, 25 μm TAPI was added half an hour before histamine treatment.) Cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS twice and lysed in 25 mm Tris base, 135 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, protein inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged, and the supernatants were collected and boiled in sample buffer (75 mm Tris/HCl, 10% sucrose, 0.2 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 2% SDS) for 3 min prior to analysis by immunoblotting as described below. Protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay kits (Pierce). Immunoblotting—Proteins (25 μg) in sample buffer were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotted (5Jones S.J. Ledgerwood E.C. Prins J.B. Galbraith J. Johnson D.R. Pober J.S. Bradley J.R. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1042-1048PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-TACE and anti-IκB-α antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:500 and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions. Serial dilution of samples for immunoblotting confirmed that the density of bands was within the linear range of detection. Confocal Immunofluorescence or Fluorescence Microscopy—HUVEC grown to confluence on coverslips were treated with 0.75 μl/ml of Golgi Probe (Cambridge Bioscience, Cambridge, UK) for 30 min, and then treated with or without 100 μm histamine or 0.1 μm PMA for 1 h at 37 °C before fixation and staining. EC were fixed by adding 1 ml of 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS to the 1 ml of complete growth media in which the treatments were performed. This step and all subsequent steps were performed at room temperature. After fixing for 2 min cells were washed three times with PBS, 1% BSA. Where indicated, fixed EC were permeabilized by incubating in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min and then washed twice with PBS, 1% BSA. Cells were then incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-hTNFR1 in PBS, 1% BSA for 1 h. After washing three times with PBS, 1% BSA, EC were incubated with secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody for 45 min. EC were washed twice with PBS, 1% BSA and once in PBS, and coverslips were mounted in Citifluor (Agar Scientific Ltd., Essex, UK) before viewing in a Leica TCS-NT Confocal Microscope (Leica Microsystems Ltd., Milton Keynes, UK). TNFR1 fusion constructs containing enhanced green fluorescent protein (gfp-TNFR1) were introduced into HUVEC by transient transfection. In brief, HUVEC grown to 70% confluence on 100-mm diameter plastic culture plates were transfected ∼18 h after passage with gfp-TNFR1 (24Gaeta M.L. Johnson D.R. Kluger M.S. Pober J.S. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 1185-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using a modified DEAE-dextran protocol as described previously (25Karmann K. Min W. Fanslow W.C. Pober J.S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiencies typically were between 15 and 25%. 24 h after transfection cells were plated onto fibronectin-coated glass-bottom culture plates (MatTek, Ashland, MA). After 24 h replicate wells were either pretreated with or without 25 μm TAPI (Peptides International), and then mock-treated or exposed to 100 μm histamine for the indicated times and imaged live using a Zeiss confocal microscope running LSM 510 software. Effects of Histamine on Human Skin—The in vivo effects of histamine on human skin were examined using immunodeficient (SCID/beige) C.B-17 mice stably engrafted with two 1-cm2 split thickness grafts as described previously (49Murray A.G. Petzelbauer P. Hughes C.C. Costa J. Askenase P. Pober J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9146-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Cadaveric human skin was obtained from discarded specimens harvested by the skin bank at Yale University School of Medicine, and skin was engrafted under a protocol approved by the Yale Animal Care and Use Committee and by the Yale Human Investigation Committee. To examine the effects of histamine on TNFR1 expression, grafts were injected with 10 μl of histamine (Histatrol, composed of 0.1 mg/ml histamine base and 0.275 mg/ml histamine phosphate, Center Laboratories, Port Washington, NY) or 10 μl of saline or untreated and harvested 30 min later. The tissue was then prepared for immunoelectron microscopy (see below). To examine the effects of TNF responses, one skin graft on each mouse was injected with 10 μl of histamine, and the other graft was injected with physiological saline, 30 min prior to TNF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) administration. Two mice at each dose (0, 3, 30, 100, 300, and 1000 ng) of TNF were injected subcutaneously in the scapular region, well separated from the graft site. Animals were euthanized, and skin grafts were harvested 6 h after TNF injection. Harvested grafts were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until assay for mRNA content (see below). Electron Microscopy of Skin Grafts—Human skin graft tissue was dissected in pieces of less than 1 mm in thickness and fixed by immersion in 2% formaldehyde (J. T. Baker Inc.) in 0.1 m PIPES buffer, pH 7.6, for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The tissue was processed for freeze substitution and low temperature embedding for immunogold electron microscopy as described previously (26Al Lamki R.S. Wang J. Skepper J.N. Thiru S. Pober J.S. Bradley J.R. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 1503-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In brief tissue was cryo-protected in 30% propylene glycol for 1 h at 4 °C, frozen in melting propane cooled in liquid nitrogen, and substituted against methanol containing 0.1% uranyl acetate at –90 °C for 24 h, at –70 °C for 24 h, and at –50 °C for 24 h. The tissue was then impregnated with Lowicryl HM 20 over a period of 3 days, and the resin was polymerized by ultraviolet irradiation at a temperature of –50 °C. Ultrathin sections 70 nm in thickness were cut on a Leica Ultracut-S (Leica Vienna) ultramicrotome and mounted on Formvar-coated grids. Immunogold Labeling for Electron Microscopy—The grids were incubated, section down, for 0.5 h at room temperature in blocking buffer containing 10% FCS in TBS to suppress nonspecific antibody binding. Excess blocking buffer was removed, and they were incubated overnight, at room temperature, with either mouse anti-hTNFR-1 or mouse anti-hCytokeratin (MNF116, Dako, UK) at 1:5 dilution in blocking buffer. Omission of primary antibody and use of isotype-specific primary antibody or nonimmune serum were used as negative controls. After rinsing extensively with TBS, the grids were incubated with goat anti-mouse conjugated with either 1- or 20-nm colloidal gold particles (British Biocell International Ltd., Cardiff, UK) diluted 1:100 in the blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. Following a thorough rinse in TBS, grids labeled with 1-nm colloidal gold were incubated with silver enhancement solution (British Biocell International Ltd., Cardiff, UK) for 4 min and washed in deionized water. All grids were then contrast-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for 15 s each. They were then viewed in a Philips TEM 410 electron microscope (Cambridge, UK) at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. To quantify the labeling of membrane/extracellular versus intracellular TNFR1, gold particles were counted in 10 fields containing on average 8 keratinocytes at a magnification of ×3000 using a small screen attached to the microscope. Counting was repeated using 3 different grids for each experiment. Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from skin grafts as follows. Frozen skin was placed into 1 ml of Trizol (Invitrogen) and homogenized using a Polytron tissue grinder until smooth. Samples were further processed according to the manufacturer's instructions and modified by centrifugation of the homogenate at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to remove insoluble materials. Following Trizol extraction, RNA was further purified using a Qiagen RNeasy (Valencia, CA) clean-up protocol with a DNase digestion step. First strand synthesis was performed using TaqMan Gold RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems of PerkinElmer Life Sciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. Random hexamers were used as primers to transcribe 700 ng of total RNA per 35-μl reaction, and RT reactions were performed in a PTC-150 Minicycler (MJ Research; Watertown, MA). Real time quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the TaqMan assay and PCR amplifications in Bio-Rad iCycler IQ Multicolor Real Time Detection System (Bio-Rad) as described previously (50Heide C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (5040) Google Scholar). Briefly, a solution of 2× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) containing primers and probes were prepared and aliquoted into individual wells of iCycler iQ PCR Plates (Bio-Rad) and cDNA as added to give a final volume of 25 μl. Conditions for PCRs included 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, and 50 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, and annealing/extension at 60 °C for 1 min. Threshold cycle (CT) during the exponential phase of amplification was determined by real time monitoring of fluorescent emission after cleavage of sequence-specific probes by nuclease activity of Taq polymerase. An increase in fluorescence is proportional to the amount of PCR product, and the amplification cycle at which the reporter dye fluorescence passes a selected base line is the CT. Low CT values reflect a high copy number and vice versa. CT values were exported to Excel for calculations. ICAM-1, ICAM-2, E-selectin, and GAPDH RNA levels were quantified. ICAM-2 is not regulated by TNF and was used as an internal control gene to normalize values for ICAM-1. E-selectin was normalized to GAPDH. Primers for ICAM-1 were purchased from Applied Biosystems of PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Primers for E-selectin, ICAM-2, and GAPDH were designed using Primer 3 software and synthesized by the Keck Foundation Bioresource Laboratory at Yale University. Sequences are as follows: E-selectin forward, CATGGAGACCATGCAGTGTA; E-selectin reverse, GGATTTGTCACAGCATCACA; ICAM-2 forward, CTGACTGTGGCCCTCTTCAC; ICAM-2 reverse, CACGTGTACCTCGAATACCTTCTC; GAPDH forward, GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC; and GAPDH reverse, GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC. Probes were purchased from Applied Biosystems of PerkinElmer Life Sciences with 6-carboxyfluorescein as the emitter at the 5′ end and 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine as the quencher at the 3′ end. Statistics—The significance of differences between experimental values was assessed by means of the paired Student's t test. Effects of Histamine on Endothelial Cell Surface TNF Receptor Expression and Shedding—As reported previously, cultured HUVEC express TNFR2 and to a lesser extent TNFR1 on their cell surface (2Slowik M.R. De Luca L.G. Fiers W. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1724-1730PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of confluent EC monolayers with histamine (100 μm) for 30 min reduced cell surface expression levels of both receptors as detected by FACS analysis. The level of TNFR1 on the cell surface had recovered to basal level by 1 h, whereas the recovery of TNFR2 was slower (Table I).Table IHistamine transiently reduces endothelial cell surface TNF receptor expressionHistamine treatmentCorrected values of mean fluorescence intensityTNFR1TNFR2h01.79 ± 0.42.82 ± 0.20.51.16 ± 0.5aValues are p < 0.01 compared to zero time.1.75 ± 0.1bValues are p < 0.05.11.58 ± 0.12.11 ± 0.3bValues are p < 0.05.21.48 ± 0.62.08 ± 0.2bValues are p < 0.05.41.56 ± 0.52.15 ± 0.4bValues are p < 0.05.161.63 ± 0.62.72 ± 0.3a Values are p < 0.01 compared to zero time.b Values are p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Concomitant with its effects of surface receptor expression, histamine treatment induced an increase in soluble TNFR1 and TNFR2 shed into the culture media. Receptor shedding was maximal during the 1st h of histamine treatment (Fig. 1). Over this time period histamine-induced shedding of TNFR1 was agonist concentration-dependent and inhibited by the histamine H1 receptor antagonist diphenhydramine but not by the H2 antagonist cimetidine (Table II). Similar results were found for shedding of TNFR2, although the total amount shed was less. Cumulatively, these data suggest that histaminestimulated TNFR reduction on the surface was caused by histamine-stimulated receptor shedding.Table IIHistamine induces shedding in a dose-dependent manner through its H1 receptorTreatmentsTNFR1 concentrationpg / mlNo treatment7.04"
https://openalex.org/W2058856502,"The β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) present in the senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease derives from the cleavage of a membrane protein, named APP, driven by two enzymes, known as β- and γ-secretases. The mechanisms regulating this cleavage are not understood. We have developed an experimental system to identify possible extracellular signals able to trigger the cleavage of an APP-Gal4 fusion protein, which is detected by measuring the expression of the CAT gene transcribed under the control of the Gal4 transcription factor, which is released from the membrane upon the cleavage of APP-Gal4. By using this assay, we purified a protein contained in the C6 cell-conditioned medium, which activates the cleavage of APP-Gal4 and which we demonstrated to be PDGF-BB. The APP-Gal4 processing induced by PDGF is dependent on the γ-secretase activity, being abolished by an inhibitor of this enzyme, and is the consequence of the activation of a pathway downstream of the PDGF-receptor, which includes the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src and the small G-protein Rac1. These findings are confirmed by the observation that a constitutively active form of Src increases Aβ generation and that, in cells stably expressing APP, the generation of Aβ is strongly decreased by the Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2.

This amyloidogenic processing is driven by two enzyme activities, β-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE) and γ-secretase. BACE cleaves APP at 28 residues from the boundary between the extracellular/intraluminal domain of APP and the transmembrane domain of the protein (for a review see Ref. 1Vassar R. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 157-170Google Scholar), releasing a large soluble protein, including nearly all the extracellular/intraluminal part of APP, and a short transmembrane peptide, including the 99 C-terminal residues of APP. This transmembrane C99 stub is a substrate for the γ-secretase activity, which cleaves it, in a presenilin-dependent fashion, within the membrane α-helix, giving rise to the Aβ peptide 40–42 amino acids long and to a peptide named APP intracellular domain (AID), which includes the small C-terminal cytosolic domain of APP (for a review see Refs. 2Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399 (suppl.): A23-A31Google Scholar and 3Annaert W. De Strooper B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 25-51Google Scholar). The functions of APP and its proteolytic processing are still unknown. However, although the functions of the APP ectodomain remain elusive, there is increasing evidence that its cytodomain is the center of a complex network of interactions with several proteins, involved in vesicle transport and in signal transduction. In fact, it was demonstrated that APP cytoplasmic domain interacts with kinesin light chain and contributes to vesicles transport (4Kamal A. Almenar-Queralt A. LeBlanc J.F. Roberts E.A. Goldstein L.S. Nature. 2001; 414: 643-648Google Scholar), thus suggesting that APP cleavage could regulate the transport of vesicles in the axons. On the other hand, the APP cytodomain binds several PTB domain-containing proteins, some of which are involved as adaptor proteins in signal transduction. Fe65 is the first protein that was found to form a stable complex with the cytosolic domain of APP, through one of the two PTB domains it possesses (5Fiore F. Zambrano N. Minopoli G. Donini V. Duilio A. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30853-30856Google Scholar, 6Zambrano N. Buxbaum J.D. Minopoli G. Fiore F. De Candia P. De Renzis S. Faraonio R. Sabo S. Cheetham J. Sudol M. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6399-6405Google Scholar). Fe65 is an adaptor protein that interacts with APP, Mena (7Ermekova K.S. Zambrano N. Linn H. Minopoli G. Gertler F. Russo T. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32869-32877Google Scholar) (the mammalian orthologue of the product of the enabled gene of Drosophila), tyrosine kinase Abl (8Zambrano N. Bruni P. Minopoli G. Mosca R. Molino D. Russo C. Schettini G. Sudol M. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19787-19792Google Scholar) (through its WW domain), transcription factor LSF (9Zambrano N. Minopoli G. de Candia P. Russo T. J. Biol.

Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Google Scholar), and low density lipoprotein-receptor-related protein LRP (11Trommsdorff M. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33556-33560Google Scholar) (through its second PTB domain). The involvement of Mena and Abl in the complexes, including APP and Fe65, is in agreement with the finding that APP cytodomain also interacts with mDab1 (12Howell B.W. Lanier L.M. Frank R. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5179-5188Google Scholar), the orthologue of the Drosophiladisabled gene, and with the Abl TK, through its SH2 domain (8Zambrano N. Bruni P. Minopoli G. Mosca R. Molino D. Russo C. Schettini G. Sudol M. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19787-19792Google Scholar), given that genetic manipulation of the fly indicated thatenabled, disabled, and DAbl are associated in the same pathway (13Gertler F.B. Comer A.R. Juang J.L. Ahern S.M. Clark M.J. Liebl E.C. Hoffmann F.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 521-533Google Scholar). Another interactor of APP is X11 (14Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Google Scholar), an adaptor protein that forms complexes with various proteins, including Munc18 and CASK (15Borg J.P. Lopez-Figueroa M.O. de Taddeo-Borg M. Kroon D.E. Turner R.S. Watson S.J. Margolis B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1307-1316Google Scholar). More recently, two adaptors involved in signal transduction, Shc and Jip1, have been demonstrated to bind to APP and AID through their PTB domains (16Russo C. Dolcini V. Salis S. Venezia V.

The evident complexity of this protein-protein interaction network suggests that APP could be a multifunctional molecule that anchors several different oligomeric complexes close to the membrane, possibly in specific subdomains such as caveolae (20Lee S.J. Liyanage U. Bickel P.E. Xia W. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Kosik K.S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 730-734Google Scholar), and/or that APP regulates the availability of these complexes in their final destination, upon APP cleavage and detachment of the APP cytodomain from the membrane. A crucial point that should be addressed to further study the possible interplay of APP and transduction pathways involving the above mentioned proteins concerns the molecular mechanisms that induce APP processing. In this report we show that PDGF-BB is a potent activator of APP β-γ cleavage, giving rise to an increased generation of Aβ through a pathway involving the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src and the small G-protein Rac1. A vector driving the expression of a fusion protein, consisting of the human APP695followed by a flexible hinge of ten glycines and by the entire yeast transcription factor Gal4, has been generated by cloning into RcCMV vector (Invitrogen) cDNA fragments amplified using as template the human APP695 cDNA and the yeast Gal4 cDNA. The following specific oligonucleotide primers (CEINGE) were used for PCR amplifications (94 °C, 1 min; 64 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 7 min; for 40 cycles): forward hAPP695 HindIII (5′-CCCAAGCTTACTAAGGCCATGCTGCCCGGTTTGGCACTGC-3′) and reverse hAPP695 Apa/NotI (5′-CATCGGGCCCCTACGCGGCCGCGTTCTGCATCTGCTCAAAGAACTTG-3′); forward yGAL4 Not/10Gly (5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTAAGCTACTGTCTTCTATCGAACAAGC-3′) and reverse yGAL4 ApaI (5′-CATCGGGCCCTTACTCTTTTTTTGGGTTTGGTGGGG-3′). Restriction sites are underlined, and the ten glycine codons are in italic. This APP-Gal4 expressing vector, containing the neomycin resistance gene, has been transfected into HeLa cells by calcium-phosphate method, and after a 14-day G418 selection (900 μg/ml final concentration), several G418-resistant clones have been isolated. Two pools of these clones have been used (HeLaAG). The cleavage of APP-Gal4 fusion protein has been assayed by transiently transfecting HeLaAG cells (5 × 105 cells/60-mm dishes) by calcium-phosphate method with G5BCAT vector (3 μg), in which the transcription of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene is under the control of a Gal4-dependent promoter (21Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Google Scholar). CAT expression was measured by using colorimetric CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Other transfections of HeLaAG cells were carried out by using the calcium-phosphate method; all the plasmids were used at 3 μg each, and the total amount of DNA in co-transfections was always brought to 10 μg with RcCMV vector. Wild type HeLa and HeLa AG cells were grown at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from HyClone). C6 and NIH3T3 cells and co-cultures were at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Wild type HeLa or HeLa AG cells, 24 h after transfection with G5BCAT vector, were treated for the indicated times with 40 ng/ml recombinant human PDGF-BB (Sigma), 5 or 10 μg/ml protein fraction precipitated with 40% AS or 200-μl fractions eluted from Sephadex G-75, diluted in DMEM without serum to a final volume of 2 ml. Inhibitors were added at the indicated times at the following concentrations: 10 μm PP2 (Calbiochem), 2 μm AG1296 (Calbiochem), 30 μm genistein (Calbiochem), 10 μm γ-secretase inhibitor compound X (Calbiochem), 100 μm PD098059 (Sigma), and 100 nm Wortmannin (Sigma). HEK293 and CHO cells were grown in the same conditions as HeLaAG. HEK293 were transfected with 0.5 μg of human APP695expression vector and 0.5 μg of SrcYF vector by LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in 35-mm plates. Total Aβ peptide was measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with 6E10 and 4G8 antibodies. C6 cells were grown as described above in 100 dishes of 150-mm diameter (Falcon) to confluence; cell sheets in each dish have been washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then cells were cultured in RPMI medium without serum. After 3 days of incubation, 3 liters of conditioned medium was harvested, centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 20 min to remove debris, and concentrated to 480 ml by using a Centriplus YM-3000 (Amicon). Then, 104 g of ammonium sulfate was added to the concentrated conditioned medium to obtain a 40% ammonium sulfate solution, which was stirred overnight at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 2 h. 70% AS saturation was reached by adding 87.4 g of ammonium sulfate to the 40% saturated solution, and 100% AS saturation was reached by adding 100.3 g of ammonium sulfate to the 70% saturated solution. The precipitates were dissolved in 15 ml of PBS and dialyzed against 5 × 2-liter changes of PBS. 1 mg of this sample was separated by FPLC onto a Sephadex G-75 column (30 g of swollen resin, pre-equilibrated in PBS) and run in this solvent at 0.25 ml/min while collecting 400-μl fractions every 1.6 min. Bands from SDS-PAGE were excised from the gel, triturated, and washed with water. Proteins were reduced in-gel, S-alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin as previously reported (22Allegrini S. Scaloni A. Ferrara L. Pesi R. Pinna P. Sgarrella F. Camici M. Eriksson S. Tozzi M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33526-33532Google Scholar). Digested aliquots were subjected to a desalting/concentration step on μZipTipC18 (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) before MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis. Peptide mixtures were loaded on the instrument target, using the dried droplet technique and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic as matrix, and analyzed by using a Voyager-DE PRO mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The PROWL software package was used to identify proteins unambiguously from an independent non-redundant sequence data base (23Zhang W. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 2482-2489Google Scholar). Immunodepletion of 40% AS fraction was obtained by incubating 20 μg of the fraction diluted in 500 μl of PBS with 60 μg of anti-PDGF antibody (Sigma) or with 60 μg of mouse IgG (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. Then the mixtures were chromatographed on 20 μl of Protein AG-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at 4 °C, and, after centrifugation, the supernatants were diluted in DMEM without serum to a final volume of 2 ml. For CAT assay, transiently transfected HeLa AG cells were harvested in cold TEN (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl), frozen at −80 °C for 30 min, and resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 400 mm NaCl). Total extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C, and protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad assay; for CAT concentration measurement, 150 μg of each protein extract was used. For Western blotting analyses, HeLa AG cells were harvested in cold PBS, resuspended in lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin) and kept in ice for 15 min. Then total extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. 20 μg of each extract or 20 μl of pooled fractions eluted from the G-75 column was electrophoresed on 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel under reducing conditions and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Filters were then blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in T-PBS solution (PBS and 0.05% Tween) and incubated with appropriate dilutions of primary antibody, overnight at 4 °C. The excess antibody was removed by sequential washing of the membranes in T-PBS, and then a 1:5000 dilution of the appropriate secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated) was added to filters for 30 min, at room temperature. The excess was removed by sequential washing of the membranes in T-PBS, and the signals were detected by chemiluminescence, using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). The antibodies used and their dilutions were: anti-PDGF (Sigma), 1:750; anti-Gal4DBD (Calbiochem), 1:1000; anti-APP 6E10 (Sigma), 1:1000; anti-APP CT695 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), 1:250; anti-phosphoERK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:1000; and anti-phosphoAkt (Santa Cruz), 1:1000. We examined the possibility that extracellular signals could induce the β-γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP. To address this point we developed an experimental system based on a recombinant protein in which the yeast Gal4 transcription factor is fused to the cytosolic C-terminal end of APP695. This system is based on the prediction that, in cells expressing APP-Gal4, upon the cleavage of this molecule by β-γ-secretase activities, AID-Gal4 is released from the membrane and should become available to activate the transcription of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene cloned under the control of five Gal4 cis-elements in the G5BCAT vector (21Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 A). Based on this experimental design, HeLa cells were transfected with a vector driving the expression of APP-Gal4 fusion protein and G418 resistance gene, and several clones stably expressing APP-Gal4 have been isolated. Fig. 1 B shows a Western blot of the extracts from several HeLa clones challenged with either APP or Gal4 antibodies and demonstrates the expression of a protein recognized by both antibodies. The experiments reported below were conducted by using two pools of these clones, HeLaAG1–8 and HeLaAG9–14, thereafter indicated as HeLaAG. To evaluate both cell-anchored and secreted factors that could activate APP-Gal4 proteolytic processing, the first experimental approach we used consisted of 1) a co-culture of HeLaAG cells, transiently transfected with G5BCAT plasmid, with various cell lines of different origin and 2) an assay of CAT accumulation in HeLaAG cultures pure or co-cultured with these cells. Fig. 1 C shows that co-culturing of HeLaAG with C6 cells resulted in a significant increase of the CAT expressed by HeLaAG, whereas no change was observed in the co-cultures with other cell lines, such as NIH3T3 fibroblasts. C6 cells are derived from a rat glioma and are known to secrete several growth factors (24Westermann R. Hardung M. Meyer D.K. Ehrhard P. Otten U. Unsicker K. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 1747-1758Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the conditioned medium from C6 cells mimics the effect of CAT accumulation observed in the co-cultures. As shown in Fig. 1 C, HeLaAG cells, grown in the presence of C6-conditioned medium, express higher levels of CAT compared with the cells grown in the conditioned medium from HeLa cells or from NIH3T3 cultures. A large-scale preparation of C6-conditioned medium was used as a source for the purification of the one or more molecules that induce the CAT accumulation in HeLaAG cells transfected with G5BCAT vector. Fig.2 shows the steps of this purification based on ammonium sulfate (AS) precipitation, size-exclusion chromatography, and SDS-PAGE. The activity is restricted to the 40% AS fraction (Fig. 2 A), which was applied on FPLC equipped with a Sephadex G-75. Eluted fractions from the chromatography were assayed for their ability to induce CAT accumulation in HeLaAG cells, and the results allowed us to identify two peaks of activity of about 70 and 30 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2 B). SDS-PAGE of the proteins present in the relevant fractions, compared with fractions devoid of activity, suggested that one band of about 15 kDa could be a good candidate (see Fig. 2 C). This band, separately excised from the lanes of the corresponding active fractions, was digested with trypsin and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Peptide mass fingerprint analysis and non-redundant sequence data base matching in both cases allowed its unambiguous identification as PDGF-B. To confirm the identification, the relevant fractions were electrophoresed and blotted with a PDGF antibody. This blot demonstrated that PDGF is present only in the fractions that activate the accumulation of CAT in HeLaAG cells (Fig. 2 D). HeLaAG were exposed to 40 ng/ml of purified human PDGF-BB for 12 h, and this resulted in a dramatic induction of CAT expression (Fig. 3). This phenomenon depends on the activation of the PDGF receptor (PDGF-R), considering that the treatment of HeLaAG cells with a TK-nonspecific inhibitor such as genistein or with PDGF-R inhibitor AG1296 resulted in a significant decrease of CAT accumulation, following the treatment with PDGF. Although, unexpectedly, PDGF is present also in the ∼70-kDa fraction of the size exclusion chromatography (see Fig. 2,C and D), it cannot be excluded that other molecules with an activity similar to that of PDGF could be also present in the C6-conditioned medium. To address this point, HeLaAG cells were treated with the 40% ammonium sulfate fraction and with the PDGF-R inhibitor. Also in this case, the accumulation of CAT was prevented by the PDGF-R inhibitor (see Fig. 3), thus strongly supporting that PDGF is the only factor, present in C6-conditioned medium, that activates APP-Gal4 cleavage. Furthermore, immunodepletion of the 40% AS fraction with anti-PDGF antibody resulted in the abolishment of the CAT accumulation observed upon exposure of HeLaAG cells to pure 40% AS fraction, whereas the depletion with mouse IgG was completely ineffective (see Fig. 3). Therefore, the activity present in the 70-kDa fraction could be a multimer of the PDGF-B subunit. To rule out the possibility that PDGF treatment induces CAT accumulation through a mechanism independent from the cleavage of APP-Gal4, we exposed wild type HeLa cells mock transfected or transfected with Gal4 to 40 ng/ml PDGF-BB. As shown in Fig.4 A, PDGF-BB treatment did not modify the accumulation of CAT in these experimental conditions. Therefore, the increase of CAT concentration observed in HeLaAG cells exposed to PDGF could be due to an activation of the CAT gene transcription by GAL4 released upon the cleavage of APP-Gal4. To address this point, extracts from HeLaAG cells exposed to PDGF or AS 40% fraction were analyzed by Western blot with anti-APP or anti-Gal4 antibodies. These experiments showed the presence, in extracts from HeLaAG cells exposed to PDGF or 40% AS fraction, of a band of a size very similar to that of Gal4, with both the Gal4 antibody and the CT695 antibody, recognizing the APP C-terminal domain (see Fig.4 B). A similar blot was challenged with the 6E10 antibody, which was directed against the N-terminal sequence of the β-amyloid peptide. This antibody recognizes the uncleaved APP-Gal4 but not the cleaved molecule. This indicates that the cleaved molecule contains the C-terminal domain of APP (AID-Gal4) and not the N-terminal sequence of Aβ. To evaluate whether the observed cleavage of APP-Gal4 requires the γ-secretase activity, we treated HeLaAG cells exposed to PDGF or to the 40% AS fraction with the γ-secretase inhibitor compound X (25Beher D. Wrigley J.D. Nadin A. Evin G. Masters C.L. Harrison T. Castro J.L. Shearman M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45394-45402Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 C, the treatment of HeLaAG cells exposed to either PDGF or partially purified fraction with 10 μmof the γ-secretase inhibitor resulted in an almost complete abolishment of the effects on CAT accumulation. These results indicate that PDGF, through the activation of its receptor, induces a proteolytic cleavage of APP-Gal4, which requires the γ-secretase activity. There are many pathways activated following PDGF-R interaction with its cognate growth factor. Tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGF-R activates the Ras-MAPK pathway through Grb2/SOS and Shc/Grb2/SOS. The possible involvement of this pathway in the APP-Gal4 processing was explored by treating HeLaAG cells exposed to PDGF with the inhibitor of ERKs, PD098059; this inhibitor does not modify the effects of both PDGF and 40% AS fraction (Fig.5). Another pathway that mediates the effects of PDGF-R activation is that of PI3K-Akt. Also, Fig. 5shows that the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin does not affect the CAT accumulation induced by both PDGF and 40% AS fraction. Src and other members of the Src non-receptor TK family interact with and are activated by PDGF-R (26Kypta R.M. Goldberg Y. Ulug E.T. Courtneidge S.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 481-492Google Scholar). To explore this pathway, HeLaAG cells have been treated with a specific inhibitor of Src TK, PP2, and with a related compound unable to inhibit Src (PP3). The treatment with PP2 of HeLaAG cells almost completely abolished the accumulation of CAT observed upon the exposure to either PDGF or 40% ammonium sulfate fraction, whereas the treatment with PP3 was completely ineffective (see Fig. 5). To further explore this finding, HeLaAG cells were transiently transfected with SrcYF vector expressing a constitutively active Src mutant (27Hirai H. Varmus H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8592-8596Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6 A, the expression of active Src resulted in the accumulation of CAT in the absence of stimulation by either PDGF or purified fractions. Accordingly, HeLaAG cells transfected with a dominant negative mutant of Src (SrcYFKM) (28Snyder M.A. Bishop J.M. McGrath J.P. Levinson A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1772-1779Google Scholar) and exposed to PDGF or to 40% AS fraction showed a significantly decreased accumulation of CAT, compared with mock transfected cells exposed to PDGF. The possible effectors downstream of Src are not completely understood. One of these downstream factors is the non-receptor TK Abl (29Furtoss O. Dorey K. Simon V. Barilà D. Superti-Furga G. Roche S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 514-524Google Scholar). The possible role of Abl TK in APP-Gal4 cleavage was explored by transfecting HeLaAG cells with a constitutively active mutant of Abl (Abl-PP) (30Barilà D. Superti-Furga G. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 280-282Google Scholar). Under these conditions no induction of APP-Gal4 cleavage was observed, thus indicating that this kinase is not involved in this phenomenon. On the contrary, another molecule that has been recently observed to be activated by PDGF and Src is Rac1, which belongs to the family of Rho G-proteins. The transfection of HeLaAG cells with a vector driving the expression of a constitutively active form of Rac (RacQL) (31Chiariello M. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 580-586Google Scholar) resulted in an increase of CAT comparable to that observed upon the transfection with SrcYF, and the co-transfection of SrcYF with a dominant negative mutant of Rac (RacN17) strongly decreased the amount of CAT compared with that accumulated in the cells transfected only with SrcYF (see Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, a similar inhibition of CAT accumulation, following the exposure to either PDGF or 40% ammonium sulfate fraction, was observed in the cells transfected with RacN17. To ascertain whether Src and Rac1, like PDGF, also activate APP-Gal4 processing through a γ-secretase-dependent pathway, HeLaAG cells were transfected with SrcYF or with RacQL, the constitutively active mutants of these two proteins, and treated with the γ-secretase inhibitor compound X. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the γ-secretase inhibitor almost completely abolished the effects of SrcYF and RacQL transfections. The above reported results indicate a clear dependence of the PDGF-Src-induced cleavage of APP upon the γ-secretase activity, but they don't allow us to distinguish between α-secretase and BACE activities, whose actions are known to precede the γ-secretase-induced cleavage. To address this point, we examined the effects of the PDGF-Src pathway on the processing of APP, by measuring the accumulation of Aβ in cultured cells, in which this pathway is activated or blocked. To do this, HEK293 cells were transfected with APP695 alone or with APP695 plus SrcYF. As shown in Fig.7 A, there is a significantly increased accumulation of Aβ in the medium of cells expressing the constitutively active form of Src. Furthermore, CHO cells stably expressing APP695, which generate high levels of Aβ, were treated with two concentrations of the inhibitor of Src TK, PP2. In these conditions, Aβ generation is significantly decreased, whereas the analogous molecule PP3, not affecting Src TK activity, was completely ineffective (see Fig. 7 B). The proteolytic processing of APP leading to the generation of Aβ peptide is an extensively studied phenomenon, due to its implication in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The great effort to understand the machineries involved in the various types of cleavages of APP resulted in the identification and in the molecular characterization of two out three of the secretases, i.e.α- and β-secretases, and many preliminary results indicate that, despite its complexity, also γ-secretase"

Cell surface HA receptors identified to date include CD44, RHAMM (CD168), ICAM-1 (CD54), LYVE-1 (5$$Google Scholar), and an endocytic receptor that is specific for HA and chondroitin sulfate. This latter HA receptor is expressed in LECs, which remove HA and chondroitin sulfate from the blood (2Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Google Scholar, 17Weigel P.H.

Weigel P.H. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 1465-1476Google Scholar). Because this endocytic receptor is also in other tissues and is not a liver-specific HA receptor, it was renamed HARE, the HAreceptor for endocytosis (21Zhou B. Weigel J.A. Fauss L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37733-37741Google Scholar). Unlike the other cell surface receptors for HA, HARE mediates the rapid endocytosis of HA and chondroitin sulfate via the clathrin-coated pit pathway (19McGary C.T. Raja R.H. Weigel P.H. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 875-884Google Scholar, 22Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R. Pertoft H. Smedsrod B. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 653-658Google Scholar). HARE is, therefore, similar in its mode of action to the transferrin, asialoglycoprotein, mannose, and low density lipoprotein receptors (23Weigel P.H. Yik J.H.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 341-363Google Scholar). After the discovery that liver is responsible for HA clearance from the blood (reviewed in Ref. 2Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Google Scholar), Deaciuc et al. (24Deaciuc I.V. Bagby G.J. Spitzer J.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 671-675Google Scholar, 25Deaciuc I.V. Bagby G.J. Lang C.H. Spitzer J.J. Hepatology. 1993; 17: 266-272Google Scholar) demonstrated the ability of isolated perfused rat liver to take up HA. This uptake process was saturable at an HA concentration of ∼0.15 μg/ml with a steady-state uptake rate of ∼10 μg HA/h/g wet weight of liver. Deaciuc et al. (24Deaciuc I.V. Bagby G.J. Spitzer J.J.

Hepatology. 1993; 17: 266-272Google Scholar) also showed that galactosamine-induced hepatitis in rats was associated with elevated plasma HA levels and decreased HA clearance ability by perfused liver. These and similar observations by other investigators led to the realization that the HA clearance ability of liver can indicate the functional status of LECs and, thus, the general health of the liver. For example, Itasaka et al. (26Itasaka H. Suehiro T. Wakiyama S. Yanaga K. Shimada M. Sugimachi K. J. Surg. Res. 1995; 59: 589-595Google Scholar) and Rao et al.(27Rao P.N. Bronsther O.L. Pinna A.D. Snyder J.T. Cowan S. Sankey S. Kramer D. Takaya S. Starzl T. Liver. 1996; 16: 48-54Google Scholar) found that the HA clearance function was a useful parameter for predicting the likely success of human liver transplantation. We previously identified two large membrane proteins of ∼175 kDa and ∼300 kDa in rat LECs that were specifically labeled with a photoaffinity derivative of HA (28Yannariello-Brown J. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 576-584Google Scholar) and retained specific HA binding activity in a novel ligand blot assay following SDS-PAGE and renaturation (29Yannariello-Brown J. Zhou B. Ritchie D. Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 314-319Google Scholar). The development of specific mAbs raised against the 175-kDa protein enabled these two HARE proteins to be purified from isolated rat LECs (30Zhou B. Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33831-33834Google Scholar) and more recently from human spleen (31Zhou B. McGary C.T. Weigel J.A. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). After cloning the cDNA for the rat 175HARE, we stably expressed the recombinant protein in SK-Hep-1 cells and found that this smaller HARE species can function as an endocytic recycling receptor with specificity for HA and chondroitin sulfate. The native rat 175HARE is derived by proteolysis from a larger precursor protein (32Zhou B. Weigel J.A. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2853-2868Google Scholar), probably the largest subunit of the 300HARE. The evidence so far indicates that the 175- and 300-kDa proteins are closely related but functionally independent HARE species. We noted previously that one of the mAbs generated to the rat HARE, designated mAb-174, inhibits 125I-HA endocytosis by isolated rat LECs and inhibits 125I-HA binding to both HARE species in a ligand blot assay (21Zhou B. Weigel J.A. Fauss L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37733-37741Google Scholar). This Ab was also able to immunoprecipitate HARE from isolated LECs. Here we report that mAb-174 also recognizes both HARE species from whole spleen, lymph node, and liver in Western analysis and performs well in immunolocalization and confocal microscopy procedures. More notably, mAb-174 also specifically blocked the uptake and degradation of 125I-HA by isolated perfused liver. This antibody should, therefore, be a valuable reagent in future studies of HARE function. 125I-HA was prepared as described (33Raja R.H. LeBoeuf R.D. Stone G.W. Weigel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 139: 168-177Google Scholar) using a hexylamine derivative of HA (oligosaccharides of M r ∼70,000). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200 g) were from Charles River Labs. BSA fraction V was from Intergen. Hanks' balanced salt solution and PBS were formulated according to the Invitrogen catalog formulations. Medium 1 was Eagle's basal medium (Invitrogen no. 41500-018) supplemented with 100 mg/liter succinic acid sodium salt, 75 mg/liter succinic acid, 2.4 g/liter HEPES, and 0.22g/liter NaHCO3. Medium 1/BSA was Medium 1 supplemented with 0.1% BSA (w/v). Collagenase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The preparation of mouse mAbs against the rat HARE was described (21Zhou B. Weigel J.A. Fauss L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37733-37741Google Scholar). Tris, SDS, ammonium persulfate, N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide, and SDS-PAGE standards were from Bio-Rad. Rat lymph nodes were a special purchase from Pel-Freez Biologicals. Unless noted otherwise, other chemicals and reagents were from Sigma. Rat livers were perfused with collagenase using a modification of the procedure developed by Seglen (34Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Google Scholar) as described previously (35Clarke B.L. Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17384-17392Google Scholar). LECs were isolated using differential centrifugation and discontinuous Percoll gradients (36Smedsrod B. Pertoft H. Eggersten G. Sundstrom C. Cell Tissue Res. 1985; 241: 639-649Google Scholar). LECs banding at the 25/50% interface were removed, washed twice with RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) containing penicillin/streptomycin (100 units each) and 2 mm glutamine and suspended at 1.5–2 × 106 cells/ml. The cells were incubated first on a glass Petri dish for 10 min at room temperature to remove Kupffer cells and then plated on human fibronectin-coated (50 μg/ml) 24-well tissue culture plates for endocytosis experiments or on glass coverslips for microscopy. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, the cells were washed three times with PBS, once with RPMI 1640, and then incubated in RPMI 1640 without serum at 37 °C for 1 h if they were to be used immediately or with 2% heat-inactivated bovine serum if they were to be cultured overnight before use. The 37 °C pretreatment was performed in all experiments to allow any endogenous cell surface-bound HA, e.g. from the serum, to be removed either by internalization or dissociation and washing. Rat livers were excised following a standard perfusion protocol (35Clarke B.L. Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17384-17392Google Scholar). During excision and mounting in a recirculation apparatus, they were perfused without recirculation with Buffer 1 (142 mm NaCl, 6.7 mm KCl, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for 8–10 min at 35 °C. Washed livers were then pre-perfused for 15 min with recirculation with a recirculation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Invitrogen catalog no. 41100, without serum but with 60 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, and 50 μg/ml goat IgG, Sigma catalog no. I-5256). Then the perfusate was switched to 60 ml of fresh recirculation medium containing 125I-HA (0.25 μg/ml in all experiments) and other additions as noted, and the liver was allowed to take up HA for up to 60 min at 35 °C. Samples (300 μl) of the recirculating perfusate were removed and divided into 50-μl portions for determination of total radioactivity (in duplicate) or HA degradation products (in triplicate). Competitor HA (50 μg/ml) or mouse IgG or mAb-174 IgG (5 μg/ml) was added to the recirculation medium containing the 125I-HA and mixed well before the recirculating perfusion was begun. The first sample taken immediately after starting the perfusion was used to determine the starting values, because there was a substantial (∼15%) and reproducible dilution of the recirculating medium by the residual buffer in the liver. In experiments with purified IgGs, these were also included during the 35 °C pre-perfusion treatment at the same concentration used in the experiment. Degradation of 125I-HA was measured by a cetylpyridinium chloride precipitation assay as described previously (20McGary C.T. Yannariello-Brown J. Kim D.W. Stinson T.C. Weigel P.H. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 1465-1476Google Scholar). Samples (50 μl in triplicate) of recirculation medium containing 125I-HA were added to 250 μl of 1 mg/ml HA in 1.5-ml microfuge tubes. After mixing, 300 μl of 6% (w/v) cetylpyridinium chloride in distilled water was added, and the tubes were mixed by vortexing. After 10 min at room temperature, the samples were centrifuged at 9000 rpm in an Eppendorf model 5417 microcentrifuge at room temperature for 5 min. A sample (300 μl) of the supernatant was taken for determination of radioactivity, and the remainder was removed by aspiration. The tip of the tube containing the precipitate pellet was cut off, put in a γ counter tube, and radioactivity was determined. Degradation was measured as the time-dependent increase of non-precipitable radioactivity. >80% of the total radioactivity was precipitable at the beginning of the experiment. Lymph node, liver, and spleen tissues from Sprague-Dawley rats were removed, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, processed, and paraffin embedded overnight on a Tissue Tek V.I.P. processor. Tissue sections (5 μm) were collected on charged slides and dried at 60 °C overnight. The slides were dewaxed three times for 3 min each with xylene followed by four washes for 3 min each with alcohol (100%, 95%, 90%, then 70%) and a single 2-min wash in water at room temperature. The endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by treatment with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 6 min followed by two 2-min water washes. The tissue sections on the slides were digested for 15 min at 37 °C in pre-warmed 0.1 n HCl containing 0.32 mg/ml pepsin followed by a 2-min water wash and a 2-min PBS wash. The slides were washed with PBS and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody (∼1:500) at room temperature for 60 min. After a 1 min PBS wash, the slides were treated with biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (1:200) for 30 min at room temperature. After another PBS rinse, the slides were incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (1:1000, Jackson Labs) for 30 min, washed once with PBS, and once with distilled water. Color development was for 5 min with 2.0% (v/v) aminoethylcarbazine and hydrogen peroxide (ScyTek Laboratories, Logan Utah) followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. Slides were viewed with an Olympus BX-40 light microscope equipped with an Olympus DP10 digital camera. Protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using BSA as standard. Radioiodine was determined using a Packard 5002 γ counting system. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Western blotting procedures were performed essentially as described by Burnette (39Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Google Scholar) with minor modifications (21Zhou B. Weigel J.A. Fauss L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37733-37741Google Scholar). To purify and characterize the rat HARE proteins, we developed a panel of eight mAbs raised against the partially purified 175HARE (21Zhou B. Weigel J.A. Fauss L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37733-37741Google Scholar,30Zhou B. Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33831-33834Google Scholar). Surprisingly, all of these mAbs also recognized the 300HARE in either Western or immuno-purification assays. We now know that this is because the single 175HARE species and probably the 230-kDa and 250-kDa subunits of the 300HARE are derived by proteolysis from a larger precursor (32Zhou B. Weigel J.A. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2853-2868Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the concentration-dependent blocking of specific uptake of125I-HA by LECs at 37 °C. Specific internalization was completely inhibited by 5 μg/ml mAb-174, whereas up to 10 μg/ml of three other anti-HARE mAbs inhibited only ∼15%. Interestingly, mAb-235 reproducibly inhibited 125I-HA endocytosis by LECs by about 50%. No further inhibition by the other six mAbs (only numbers 28, 30, and 467 are shown) or mouse IgG (not shown) occurred regardless of IgG concentration or duration of treatment. Previously, we reported that mAb-174 blocks 125I-HA binding to both HARE species (21Zhou B. Weigel J.A. Fauss L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37733-37741Google Scholar) in a ligand blot assay that detects the activity of these proteins after SDS-PAGE, electrotransfer, and renaturation (29Yannariello-Brown J. Zhou B. Ritchie D. Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 314-319Google Scholar). In dose-response experiments, <1 μg/ml, mAb-174 blocked 125I-HA binding to both the affinity-purified 175HARE and 300HARE proteins, but control IgG up to 10 μg/ml had no effect (not shown). Inhibition of binding to the 175HARE was almost complete; ∼88% of the specific binding was blocked at 2–10 μg/ml mAb-174. Although the effect of mAb-174 on 125I-HA binding to the 300HARE was identical to that of the 175HARE below 1 μg/ml, inhibition leveled off at ∼50% between 1–10 μg/ml. Despite the ability of mAb-174 to inhibit HA uptake by LECs at 37 °C or HA binding in the ligand blot assay at room temperature, we unexpectedly found that mAb-174 did not block 125I-HA binding to LECs at 4 °C (Fig. 2). To test the possibility that this inability to inhibit HA binding was due to an inherent difference in HARE between 37 °C and 4 °C (e.g. a conformation change), we fixed LECs so that endocytosis could not occur when the cells were subsequently put at 37 °C. This enabled us to determine whether mAb-174 could block125I-HA binding per se at 37 °C; this cannot be assessed if endocytosis occurs simultaneously. The results confirmed that mAb-174, but none of the other HARE-specific mAbs tested, could block 125I-HA binding to fixed LECs at 37 °C. We conclude that HARE likely undergoes a conformation change between 37 °C and 4 °C that does not prevent 125I-HA binding to LECs but that alters the epitope recognized by mAb-174 so that it does not block HA binding. We found previously that mAb-174 recognizes the 175HARE and 300HARE proteins in Western analysis of crude LEC membranes (21Zhou B. Weigel J.A. Fauss L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37733-37741Google Scholar). Because we had not tested any of our mAbs individually using other tissues, we compared the Western blot reactivity of mAb-174 with the two HARE species from rat lymph node, spleen, and liver. In all three tissues, the HARE proteins were visualized by mAb-174 (Fig.3). Expression of the 175HARE in lymph node was lower than in the other tissues, although it was detectable (not shown). In addition to its utility as a ligand-blocking antibody and for Western analysis, mAb-174 also worked well in a variety of localization procedures, including indirect fluorescence microscopy (e.g. the same localization pattern was observed previously with a mixture of mAbs; Ref. 21Zhou B. Weigel J.A. Fauss L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37733-37741Google Scholar) and immunohistochemistry (Fig.4). Immunohistochemical localization of HARE using mAb-174 revealed heavy staining of the sinusoidal endothelial cells in liver, spleen, and lymph node (Fig. 4). The medullary sinuses of lymph node and the venous sinusoids of spleen contain large amounts of HARE protein.Figure 4Immuno-localization of HARE in rat liver, spleen and lymph node. Sections of rat spleen, liver, or lymph node were processed and incubated with mAb-174 ascites fluid (left column) or normal mouse serum (right column) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Thebars represent 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The fact that mAb-174 effectively inhibits HA binding and uptake by isolated LECs at 37 °C does not necessarily mean that the antibody would be equally able to inhibit HA clearance by these cells in intact liver. To answer this question, we tested the ability of mAb-174 to block 125I-HA uptake and degradation by excised rat livers that were continuously perfused ex vivo. In these experiments we used a concentration of mAb-174 (5 μg/ml) that gave essentially complete inhibition of uptake by LECs. 125I-HA introduced into the perfusion recirculating medium was readily removed; ∼50% was cleared within ∼20 min (Fig.5). In the presence of excess unlabeled HA, the removal of 125I-HA was completely blocked. Although control mouse IgG appeared to retard slightly the clearance of125I-HA, there was no statistically significant difference between most of the data pairs. In contrast, when mAb-174 was present there were very significant differences in 125I-HA removal at all times during the perfusion, and the level of residual uptake was just slightly greater than that in the presence of excess unlabeled HA. The results confirm that mAb-174 effectively blocks 125I-HA uptake by LECs in intact perfused liver. This conclusion was further confirmed by demonstrating the effect of mAb-174 on the appearance of 125I-HA degradation products in the perfusion medium (Fig. 6).125I-HA removal and processing by perfused liver was so efficient that degradation products were detected within minutes. By 30 min, about 25% of the total 125I-HA in the perfusate had been internalized, degraded, and released back into the medium. Again, no significant differences were seen in the appearance of degradation products when mouse IgG was present, although all of the values were slightly lower. In contrast, mAb-174 substantially reduced the steady-state rate at which 125I-HA degradation products were released. The inhibition by unlabeled HA was essentially complete, indicating that >95% of the observed degradation was mediated by a specific mechanism. HA is used in many cosmetic and clinical applications, and new HA-containing materials are currently being developed for medical use. For example, HA is used in ophthalmological surgery (40Goa K.L. Benfield P. Drugs. 1994; 47: 536-566Google Scholar), to treat patients with osteoarthritis in knee and hip joints (41Manek N.J. Lane N.E. Am. Fam. Physician. 2000; 61: 1795-1804Google Scholar), to prevent adhesions after surgery (42Panay N. Lower A.M. Curr. Opin. Obstet. Gynecol. 1999; 11: 379-385Google Scholar), and as an aerosol to prevent elastase-mediated injury in pulmonary emphysema (43Cantor J.O. Cerreta J.M. Armand G. Turino G.M. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 471-475Google Scholar). Because of the wide range of medical uses for HA, it is very important to understand how HA turnover and clearance are regulated. The present study was undertaken as an initial effort to define the role of HARE in this process. After LECs were found to contain an endocytic HA receptor (23Weigel P.H. Yik J.H.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 341-363Google Scholar, 44Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Google Scholar), others demonstrated that isolated perfused rat liver can remove circulating HA (24Deaciuc I.V. Bagby G.J. Spitzer J.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 671-675Google Scholar, 25Deaciuc I.V. Bagby G.J. Lang C.H. Spitzer J.J. Hepatology. 1993; 17: 266-272Google Scholar, 45Fraser J.R. Appelgren L.E. Laurent T.C. Cell Tissue Res. 1983; 233: 285-293Google Scholar), presumably mediated by this HA receptor. The present results verify that this assumption was correct. The quantitative inhibition of 125I-HA uptake and degradation by mAb-174 demonstrates that HARE mediates at least 90% of the liver's clearance ability. In this study, we did not perform an extensive dose response analysis because of the larger number of animals and amount of purified IgG required. Accordingly, we did not necessarily use an optimum dose of mAb-174 for blocking HARE in perfused liver, although the mAb-174 concentration used, 5 μg/ml, gave maximum inhibition of 125I-HA internalization by LECs (Fig. 1). Using a mixture of anti-HARE mAbs, we found that the small and large rat HARE proteins are highly expressed in the sinusoids of liver, the venous sinuses of the red pulp in spleen, and the medullary sinuses in lymph nodes (21Zhou B. Weigel J.A. Fauss L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37733-37741Google Scholar). This distribution was also seen using only mAb-174 (Fig. 4). HARE was not detectable by Western or immuno-cytochemical analysis in brain, lung, heart, muscle, kidney, or intestine. Abundant expression of HARE in the sinusoids of liver and lymphatic tissues is ideal for keeping the systemic HA levels low. Banerji et al.(46Banerji S. Day A.J. Kahmann J.D. Jackson D.G. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 371-381Google Scholar) discovered a lymph-specific homologue of CD44, designated LYVE-1, which binds HA and is localized to the luminal face of vessel walls in the lymphatic system. It is not present on blood vessels. Preliminary studies indicate that LYVE-1 and HARE have different and non-overlapping distributions in lymph node and spleen and are not co-localized even within isolated rat LECs. The rat 175HARE is a 1431-amino acid (156,393 Da) type I membrane protein with a large NH2-terminal extracellular domain (∼1323 amino acids), one transmembrane domain (∼20 amino acids), and a small COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain (∼88 amino acids). The native protein contains ∼25 kDa of N-linked oligosaccharides (30Zhou B. Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33831-33834Google Scholar). The recombinant rat 175HARE protein, expressed in SK-Hep-1 cells, is a functional HA receptor able to mediate the specific and continuous endocytosis of 125I-HA through the clathrin coated pit pathway (32Zhou B. Weigel J.A. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2853-2868Google Scholar). Because the 175HARE is functional in the absence of the 300HARE complex, it is not necessary for these two HARE species to be present in the same cell in order to create a specific, endocytically competent HA receptor. Therefore, the 175HARE and 300HARE are independent isoreceptors for HA. Our present results show that mAb-174 blocks HA binding and endocytosis by both HARE species in intact liver. A 70-kg person contains about 15 g of HA and turns over about 5 g, or one-third of their total HA, per day (47Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. Henriksen J.H. Degradation of Bioactive Substances: Physiology and Pathophysiology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 249-265Google Scholar). About 50% of the total HA is in skin and has a metabolic half-life of <1.5 days (48Tammi R. Saamanen A.M. Maibach H.I. Tammi M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 126-130Google Scholar). Lymph nodes and liver are the major clearance sites for the systemic removal and degradation of HA (2Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Google Scholar). HA injected intravenously in mammals is rapidly removed from the blood by liver (2Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Google Scholar,45Fraser J.R. Appelgren L.E. Laurent T.C. Cell Tissue Res. 1983; 233: 285-293Google Scholar, 47Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. Henriksen J.H. Degradation of Bioactive Substances: Physiology and Pathophysiology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 249-265Google Scholar), whereas HA introduced into lymph is degraded first by lymph nodes, and the remainder is then removed by the liver. The present model of mammalian HA turnover is that large native HA (∼107 Da) in ECMs throughout the body is partially degraded to fragments of ∼106 Da that are released into lymphatic vessels and then flow to lymph nodes where ∼85% of the total HA is removed and degraded. The remaining HA (∼15%) that exits the lymph nodes is ∼105 Da and, after entering the blood, is removed by the LECs of liver. Despite the generation of up to 5 g of HA degradation products per day, the HA clearance systems utilizing HARE in lymph nodes and liver keep the normal steady-state HA concentration in blood very low (i.e. 10–100 ng/ml). Clearance of circulating HA from blood is important for normal health, because blood viscosity could increase to levels that might impair the microcirculation if the concentration of large HA (i.e. >106 Da) increased. Blood HA levels could rise due either to greater HA production or turnover in the body, exceeding the capacity of LECs to remove it, or to a compromised function of HARE in lymph nodes or liver. Elevated blood HA levels are found in several diseases, although in most cases the cause of this elevation is not known. Elevated serum HA is now used as a diagnostic indicator of liver failure. For example, elevated serum HA is a marker for liver fibrosis in hepatitis C virus-associated chronic liver disease (49Fraser J.R. Laurent T.C. Pertoft H. Baxter E. Biochem. J. 1981; 200: 415-424Google Scholar). Increased ascitic levels of HA occur in liver cirrhosis due to increased HA synthesis by peritoneal cells and decreased uptake by LECs (50Yamada M. Fukuda Y. Nakano I. Katano Y. Takamatsu J. Hayakawa T. Acta Haematol. 1998; 99: 212-216Google Scholar). Elevated blood HA levels have also been reported in a variety of other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (51Manicourt D.H. Poilvache P. Nzeusseu A. van Egeren A. Devogelaer J.P. Lenz M.E. Thonar E.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 1861-1869Google Scholar), psoriasis (52Lundin A. Engstrom-Laurent A. Hallgren R. Michaelsson G. Br. J. Dermatol. 1985; 112: 663-671Google Scholar), and in some cancers (53Thylen A. Wallin J. Martensson G. Cancer. 1999; 86: 2000-2005Google Scholar). Blood HA levels can also predict the functionality of LECs and the likely success of liver transplants (26Itasaka H. Suehiro T. Wakiyama S. Yanaga K. Shimada M. Sugimachi K. J. Surg. Res. 1995; 59: 589-595Google Scholar, 27Rao P.N. Bronsther O.L. Pinna A.D. Snyder J.T. Cowan S. Sankey S. Kramer D. Takaya S. Starzl T. Liver. 1996; 16: 48-54Google Scholar). In summary, mAb-174 specifically inhibits the HA-binding and HA-clearance activities of both the small and large HARE proteins in isolated rat LECs and in whole perfused liver. This effective activity-blocking antibody is particularly versatile, because it is also functional in Western analysis and a variety of other immuno-procedures and should be useful in future studies to understand the physiological functions of HARE."

Soluble and cell-associated KCP acted as a cofactor for factor I (FI)-mediated cleavage of both C4b and C3b and induced the cleavage products C4d and iC3b, respectively. In the presence of KCP, FI further cleaved iC3b to C3d, which has never been described before as complement receptor 1 only mediates the production of C3dg by FI. KCP would enhance virus pathogenesis through evading complement attack, opsonization, and anaphylaxis but may also aid in targeting KSHV to one of its host reservoirs since C3d is a ligand for complement receptor 2 on B-cells.

Knowles D.M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 165-174Google Scholar and 4Schulz T.F. Eur. J. Cancer. 2001; 37: 1217-1226Google Scholar). KSHV belongs to the rhadinovirus genus of the Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily, the prototype of which is Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS). The long unique region of the KSHV genome comprises 140.5 kb and contains over 80 open reading frames (ORFs) (5Russo J.J. Bohenzky R.A. Chien M.C. Chen J. Yan M. Maddalena D. Parry J.P. Peruzzi D. Edelman I.S. Chang Y. Moore P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14862-14867Google Scholar). Several of the ORFs encode host cell homologues (e.g. viral cyclin D, viral interleukin-8 G protein-coupled receptor, and a bcl-2 homologue) with the potential to regulate the cell cycle and the immune response thereby contributing to the virulence and the pathogenesis of KSHV (5Russo J.J. Bohenzky R.A. Chien M.C. Chen J. Yan M. Maddalena D. Parry J.P. Peruzzi D. Edelman I.S. Chang Y. Moore P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14862-14867Google Scholar, 6Jenner R.G. Boshoff C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 1-22Google Scholar). The fourth open reading frame, ORF4, was initially speculated to have complement regulatory abilities based on its homology to human complement regulators decay-accelerating factor (DAF) and membrane cofactor and to previously described virus-encoded complement inhibitors (5Russo J.J. Bohenzky R.A. Chien M.C. Chen J. Yan M. Maddalena D. Parry J.P. Peruzzi D. Edelman I.S. Chang Y. Moore P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14862-14867Google Scholar). The KSHV ORF4 gene is predicted to encode a KCP protein of 550 amino acids (data base reference SPTREMBL:O40912), and the first 280 amino acids are predicted to encode four complement control protein (CCP) domains. CCP domains are defined by a consensus sequence of ∼60 amino acids containing four invariant cysteine residues that form disulfide links, which results in the CCP forming a globular domain with a hydrophobic core enclosed by β-strands (7Norman D.G. Barlow P.N. Baron M. Day A.J. Sim R.B. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 717-725Google Scholar, 8Kirkitadze M.D. Barlow P.N. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 146-161Google Scholar). While the CCP domain is not exclusive to complement control proteins, all but one of the C3-convertase-regulating proteins identified to date, either mammalian or viral, are composed of CCPs. Analyses of KCP mRNA expressed in B-cells isolated from primary effusion lymphoma patients revealed three major transcript variants (one unspliced full-length form and two alternatively spliced variants), all containing the N-terminal four CCP domains but with different amounts of internal coding sequence removed by alternative splicing (9Spiller B.O. Robinson M. O′Donnell E. Milligan S. Morgan P.B. Davison A.J. Blackbourn D.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 592-599Google Scholar). All three transcripts also encode the transmembrane region indicating that all forms are membrane-associated. The HVS-encoded complement regulator is also alternatively spliced, but the transmembrane region is lost in the single alternatively spliced form due to a frameshift (10Albrecht J.C. Fleckenstein B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3937-3940Google Scholar). The complement regulator homologue encoded by murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MγHV68) has also been reported to be expressed as cell-bound and soluble forms (11H. W.Kapadia S.B. Molina H. van Berkel V. Speck S.H. Virgin IV, H.W. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7658-7670Google Scholar); however, no alternate splicing of the MγHV68 mRNA that could yield the latter form was observed by the authors, and how the soluble protein arises has yet to be resolved. During our initial characterization of the KCP mRNA isolated from primary effusion lymphoma cell lines, we found that expression of the KCP cDNA in CHO cells significantly reduced C3b deposition on antibody-sensitized CHO cells following incubation with whole human serum; however, the mechanism of complement regulation was not elucidated (9Spiller B.O. Robinson M. O′Donnell E. Milligan S. Morgan P.B. Davison A.J. Blackbourn D.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 592-599Google Scholar). Here we describe the mechanism of KCP complement regulation. We examined the ability of KCP to enhance the decay of C3-convertases of both the alternative and classical pathways of complement. These activities were compared with those of the host complement regulators, factor H (FH), C4-binding protein (C4BP), and DAF. The ability of KCP to act as a factor I (FI) cofactor for the cleavage and inactivation of both C3b and C4b was also examined in the soluble phase and on the surface of cells. Importantly, we show that KCP has FI cofactor activity previously undescribed as it promotes FI production of the C3d fragment. Human C4BP (12Dahlbäck B. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 847-856Google Scholar), C1 (13Gigli I. Porter R.R. Sim R.B. Biochem. J. 1976; 157: 541-548Google Scholar), C2 (14Dahlbäck B. Hildebrand B. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 857-863Google Scholar), C4 (15Andersson M. Hanson A. Englund G. Dahlbäck B. Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 261-265Google Scholar), FH (16Blom A.M. Kask L. Dahlbäck B. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 547-556Google Scholar), and FI (17Crossley L. Porter R. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 173-182Google Scholar) were purified from plasma as described previously. C3, C3b, C4b, factors B, D, and properdin were purchased from Advanced Research Technologies. C1 and C2 were functionally pure (i.e. they were devoid of other complement factors), while C4BP, FH, FI, C4, C3, C4b, and C3b were at least 95% pure as determined by Coomassie staining of proteins separated by SDS-PAGE. All proteins were stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. C3b and C4b were labeled with 125I using the chloramine T method (18Greenwood F.C. Hunter W.M. Glover J.S. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 114-123Google Scholar), and the specific activity was determined to be 0.4–0.5 MBq/μg of protein. Human erythrocyte ghosts were used as a source of CR1 and were made through repeated washing (until all red color was removed) in ice-cold phosphate buffer (7.5 mm phosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by resuspension and centrifugation at maximum speed in a benchtop microfuge (4 °C) followed by discarding the supernatant. Soluble recombinant Fc fusion proteins were constructed based on the naturally occurring isoforms of KCP (described in Ref. 9Spiller B.O. Robinson M. O′Donnell E. Milligan S. Morgan P.B. Davison A.J. Blackbourn D.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 592-599Google Scholar) using the same strategy and vectors as previously described to construct DAF-Fc (19Harris C.L. Spiller O.B. Morgan B.P. Immunology. 2000; 100: 462-470Google Scholar). Cloning and characterization of full-length KCP cDNA are described elsewhere (9Spiller B.O. Robinson M. O′Donnell E. Milligan S. Morgan P.B. Davison A.J. Blackbourn D.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 592-599Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR primers were designed to truncate the recombinant KCP isoforms immediately following the CCP domains (short: 5′-AGCTGCTGTATGGGTGTCTTCA-3′), prior to the Ser/Thr-rich region (medium; 5′-TGGCTGGGATGTAGTTTTCTCAT-3′), or prior to the transmembrane region (long: 5′-AATGGGAGGGAGTGTTGGTTCT-3′). All of these primers were designed with a NotI restriction site to allow the in-frame addition of the human IgG1-Fc C terminus when used for PCR in combination with the common forward primer (F: 5′-GCGCTCTAGAGCTAGCATGGCCTTTTTAAGACAAAC-3′), followed by cloning into the previously described expression vector pDR2ΔEF1α (19Harris C.L. Spiller O.B. Morgan B.P. Immunology. 2000; 100: 462-470Google Scholar). The resultant plasmids were transfected into CHO cells (European culture collection) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Cells were propagated in RPMI 1640 cell medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, and stable transfectants were created by propagating cells in medium containing 400 μg/ml of Hygromycin B (Invitrogen) for 2 weeks. Cell supernatants were collected, and the Fc fusion proteins isolated and purified as previously described using protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) (19Harris C.L. Spiller O.B. Morgan B.P. Immunology. 2000; 100: 462-470Google Scholar). The resulting three KCP-Fc fusion proteins of different sizes resemble IgG molecules with the Fab portion replaced with KCP proteins. These proteins were released by incubation with papain-coupled agarose (Sigma) at 37 °C for 1 h (the optimal ratio between amount of the protein and papain was determined by titration). Papain-agarose was then removed by centrifugation, and the free Fc and uncleaved Fc fusion protein removed from the supernatant by binding to a protein A-Sepharose column. The purity of all proteins was confirmed by silver staining following separation by SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. Cell surface expression of all three KCP fusion proteins was accomplished by exchanging in-frame the human Fc portion of the recombinant proteins with the cDNA encoding the signal for GPI anchoring of human DAF (see Ref. 9Spiller B.O. Robinson M. O′Donnell E. Milligan S. Morgan P.B. Davison A.J. Blackbourn D.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 592-599Google Scholar). Uniform expression was confirmed by flow cytometry using monoclonal anti-KCP antibodies raised in-house. Various concentrations of putative or control cofactor proteins were mixed with 750 nm C3b (or 250 nm C4b), 60 nm FI, and trace amounts of 125I-labeled C3b (or125I-labeled C4b) in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, supplemented with 150 mm NaCl. For examination of cell-associated KCP cofactor activity the unlabelled C3b/C4b were not included in the incubation. The samples were incubated for 1.5–4 h for soluble proteins or overnight for cells at 37 °C, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS/PAGE sample buffer with reducing agent. The samples were then incubated at 95 °C for 3 min before protein separation on 10–15% gradient polyacrylamide gels and visualization by autoradiography using Phosphorimaging analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Sheep erythrocytes were washed twice with DGVB2+ (2.5 mm veronal buffer, pH 7.3, 72 mm NaCl, 140 mm glucose, 0.1% gelatin, 1 mmMgCl2, and 0.15 mm CaCl2), suspended at a concentration of 109 cells/ml, and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with an equal volume of amboceptor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; diluted 1:3000 in DGVB2+) to make EA cells. EAC1 cells were made by washing the EA cells twice with ice-cold DGVB2+ and resuspending at 109cells/ml; then C1 was added to 1010 cells drop-wise to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml, and the mixture incubated with agitation for 20 min at 30 °C. EAC1 cells were washed twice with ice-cold buffer and incubated with agitation for 20 min at 30 °C with 1 μg/ml C4. The resultant EAC14 cells were incubated in DGVB2+ containing C2 (∼5 μg/ml) for 5 min to allow formation of C3-convertase. The cells were then placed on ice for 1 min, centrifuged, and resuspended in prewarmed DGVB2+. An equal volume of these EAC142 cells was added to a range of prediluted inhibitors and allowed to incubate at 30 °C with constant shaking for 5 min. 100-ml aliquots of each sample were removed and added to 100 μl of guinea-pig serum-diluted 1:50 in 40 mm EDTA-GVB, and the resultant lysis was determined following incubation at 37 °C for 60 min. The amount of released hemoglobin was directly proportional to the residual C3-convertase activity remaining on the EA142 cells and was measured at 405 nm in the supernatant after pelleting the unlysed cells by centrifugation. Soluble recombinant DAF-Fc or purified C4BP were used as positive controls in these experiments, and all inhibitors were compared with the amount of lysis observed in the absence of added inhibitors. Ten ml of EAC14 (1.5 × 109/ml), prepared as described above, were incubated with 0.25 μg/ml C2 and 50 μg/ml C3 for 30 min at 30 °C with agitation. The cells were washed once in 10 mm EDTA-GVB, resuspended in the same buffer, and incubated for 2h at 37 °C to allow dissociation of C1 and C2 from the cells. The resultant EAC43 were washed twice in EDTA-GVB, then twice in Mg2+-EGTA buffer (2.5 mm veronal buffer, pH 7.3, 70 mm NaCl, 140 mm glucose, 0.1% gelatin, 7 mm MgCl2, and 10 mmEGTA), and then resuspended at 2 × 109 cell/ml. EAC43 were then incubated with properdin (0.21 μg/ml), FD (21 ng/ml), FB (10 ng/ml), and tested inhibitor or Mg2+-EGTA (final volume 150 μl). The mixtures were kept shaking at 30 °C and 100-μl aliquots removed after 30 min and added to 100 μl of guinea pig serum diluted 1:30 in GVB-EDTA. After 1 h at 37 °C, the samples were centrifuged, and the amount of erythrocyte lysis was determined spectrophotometrically as above. Soluble recombinant DAF-Fc and FH served as positive controls in these experiments, and all inhibitors were compared with the amount of lysis observed in the absence of added inhibitors. C3b was treated with FI in the presence of the short form of KCP as described in the degradation assay section. The proteins containing in total 7.5 μg of C3 were separated by SDS/PAGE on 10–15% gradient gel and transferred by semi-dry electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was stained with Coomassie and the appropriate bands were excised and subjected to N-terminal sequencing in an automated sequenator (494 Protein Sequencer ProCise; Applied Biosystems). The interaction between C3b/C4b and KCPs was analyzed using surface plasmon resonance (Biacore 2000; Biacore). Each of four flow cells on a CM5 sensor chip were activated with 20 μl of 0.2 m 1-ethyl-3-(3 dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide with 0.05 m N-hydroxy-sulfosuccinimide at a flow rate of 5 μl/min, and then the short form of recombinant KCP (0.01 mg/ml in 10 mmsodium-acetate buffer, pH 4.5) was injected over flow cell 2 to reach 2000 resonance units. Medium and long forms of KCP were injected over flow cells 3 and 4, respectively, to also reach 2000 resonance units. In all cases unreacted groups were blocked with 20 μl of 1m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. A negative control was prepared by activating and subsequently blocking the surface of flow cell 1. The association kinetics were studied for a range of C3b and C4b concentrations (methylamine inactivation of C3 and C4 was used to convert native C3 and C4 to C3b and C4b conformation, respectively (20Zabern I. Bloom E. Chu V. Gigli I. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 1433-1438Google Scholar)) using the standard flow buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4 supplemented with 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20). In some experiments, 75 mm NaCl was used, and occasionally standard flow buffer was supplemented with physiological concentrations of calcium and zinc (2.5 mm CaCl2, 20 μm ZnCl2). Protein solutions were injected for 300 s to achieve saturation during the association phase at a constant flow rate of 30 μl/min. The sample was injected first over the negative control surface and then over immobilized KCP flow cells and analyzed for a dissociation phase of 200 s at the same flow rate. Signals were normalized by subtracting the nonspecific signal measured by control flow cell 1. Between each different concentration of C4b or C3b tested the flow cell surfaces were regenerated with a 30-μl injection of 2 m NaCl to remove bound ligands. All sensograms were analyzed using the BiaEvaluation 3.0 software (Biacore) to calculate equilibrium affinity constants. Deposition of C3b and various fragments thereof was measured by flow cytometry using polyclonal antibodies. C3b was deposited in the absence of sensitizing antibody, on the surface of sheep erythrocytes (EC3) after three rounds of incubation with C3, FB, FD, and nickel ions as previously described (16Blom A.M. Kask L. Dahlbäck B. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 547-556Google Scholar). The cells were then incubated overnight at 37 °C with FI alone or in combination with FH, the short form of KCP, or a source of CR1 (human erythrocyte ghosts) in DGVB2+. Aliquots of each of these treated EC3 cells were then incubated with a panel of rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against C3d (Dakopatts), C3c (two different antibodies from Dakopatts), or whole C3 molecule (generated in house against whole purified C3). EC3 cells were washed once in flow cytometry medium (FCM; phosphate-buffered saline, 15 mm EDTA, 30 mmNaN3, 1% bovine serum albumin) and resuspended to a concentration of 106 cells/ml. Primary antibodies (purified IgG fractions) were diluted 1/100 in FCM and allowed to bind for 30 min at 4 °C. Unbound antibody was removed by three washes in FCM prior to incubation with secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody (Dakopatts). After three final washes in FCM the cells were analyzed on a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). All treated EC3 cells were compared with EC3 cells that were incubated overnight in DGVB2+ only as a negative control. All analyses were performed in triplicate, and the experiment was performed twice. Three soluble recombinant Fc fusion forms of KCP were constructed based on the naturally occurring transcript variants observed in KSHV-infected cells (9Spiller B.O. Robinson M. O′Donnell E. Milligan S. Morgan P.B. Davison A.J. Blackbourn D.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 592-599Google Scholar). The shortest construct is composed of only the N-terminal CCP domains fused with the hinge and C terminus of human IgG1 Fc region. The medium and longest recombinant fusion proteins were truncated prior to the Ser/Thr-rich region or prior to the transmembrane regions, respectively. Fig.1 shows the molecular mass of all three purified KCP-Fc forms compared with human DAF-Fc separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. However, it should be noted that Fc fusion proteins appear as IgG molecules with the Fab portion replaced by KCP, and purified KCP-Fc proteins are therefore dimeric. Additionally, because the longest KCP form retained both of the mRNA splice donor sites and the single splice acceptor site, the resultant fusion protein existed as a mixture of full-length, medium, and short Fc fusion proteins. The decay of classical pathway C3-convertase was measured in the presence of soluble KCP (Fig.2). Putative or known inhibitory proteins were added after the formation of the classical C3-convertase on the surface of sheep erythrocytes, and decay acceleration was measured after 5 min. All three forms of KCP-Fc accelerated the decay of C3-convertase equivalently and were ∼10-fold less active than the positive control DAF-Fc (Fig. 2 A). Monomeric KCP forms were released from KCP-Fc with papain and found to be about 5-fold less active than C4BP at enhancing the decay (Fig. 2 B). Dimeric KCP-Fc was found to be equally as effective as monomeric KCP, indicating that the Fc fusion proteins did not cause steric hindrance of the active site, nor did the close proximity of two active sites increase the decay-accelerating activity. No decay of classical pathway C3-convertase was observed when dimeric CAR-Fc (Coxackie adenovirus receptor) or monomeric CAR were tested, confirming that the decay-accelerating activity measured was specific to KCP (Fig. 2). The decay of the alternative pathway C3-convertase was also assessed by hemolytic assay. The alternative C3-convertase was assembled on the surface of sheep erythrocytes coincident with the addition of putative and known inhibitors, and decay acceleration was measured after 30 min. All three forms of KCP-Fc accelerated the decay equivalently, but they were 1000-fold less efficient compared with positive control DAF-Fc (Fig.3 A). Monomeric KCP proteins were also tested after being released by papain cleavage, but the decay-accelerating activity was not increased compared with dimeric Fc fusion proteins, and activity was found to be 1000-fold lower than the positive control FH (Fig. 3 B). While KCP had poor alternative pathway decay-accelerating activity, it was still much greater than the negative control CAR-Fc and monomeric CAR, which had no significant decay-accelerating activity (Fig. 3). Cofactor activity of KCP was assessed in a C4b-degradation assay in the presence of FI (Fig. 4, left panel). FI degradation of radiolabeled C4b was assessed in the presence or absence of putative or control cofactors under physiological saline conditions. All three forms of KCP-Fc were found to catalyze FI cleavage of the C4b α-chain from 85 kDa to the major fragment of 46 kDa, consistent with the cleavage of C4b to C4d (Fig. 5). Cleavage of C4b was not seen if C4b was incubated with KCP alone or FI alone, confirming co-operative activity. Further, no C4b cleavage was observed following incubation with DAF-Fc and FI (not shown), indicating the specificity for the KCP portion of the KCP-Fc molecule. All three forms were roughly equivalent in their ability to act as FI-cofactors, and 50% of the total C4b was converted to C4d by FI when KCP was present at 1.85 μm, 2.7 μm, and 1.55 μm, respectively, for short, medium, and long KCP-Fc forms compared with C4BP, which had a 50% total cofactor activity at 0.2 μm (not shown). However, this quantitative difference does not take into account that C4BP has seven active sites compared with the two active sites of KCP-Fc. Stably transfected CHO cells expressing GPI-anchored KCP short, medium, or long forms or unmodified full-length KCP, were also able to act as FI cofactors for the cleavage of C4b to C4d, while control CHO cells were unable to support FI activity (Fig. 5 A). Hence, KCP was capable of FI cofactor activity in both cell-bound and soluble forms.Figure 5C4b-degradation assay for CHO cells expressing GPI-anchored monomeric forms of short (S), medium (M), or long (L) and CHO cells expressing naturally occurring transmembrane form (TM) (A) or forms of KCP-Fc (S,M, L) were examined (B). Positive control source of CR1 were human erythrocyte ghosts (A) or C4BP (B). Samples containing 125I-labeled C4b, FI, and indicated cofactors were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. They were then mixed with a sample buffer containing reducing agent and heated, and the proteins were separated by 10–15% gradient SDS/PAGE. Radioactive C4b fragments were then visualized by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) All three forms of KCP-Fc were also tested for FI cofactor cleavage of C3b (C3b degradation products depicted in Fig. 4,right panel) as detailed above for C4b studies. FH and all three forms of KCP-Fc, but not DAF-Fc, were capable of inducing FI cleavage of the 104-kDa C3b α-chain releasing a product of 64 kDa as well as a 40–38-kDa doublet consistent with the formation of iC3b (Fig. 6). Moreover, all three KCP-Fc forms, but not FH, induced further cleavage of iC3b to a 30-kDa degradation product that was smaller than the 35-kDa C3dg degradation product produced by FI in the presence of CR1 (Fig. 6 A). N-terminal sequencing of the 30-kDa species yielded the sequence HLIVTPSGCGEQNMIGMTPT. This sequence confirmed that the first 47 amino acid residues of C3dg were missing, which is consistent with the molecular mass and sequence of C3d. Fifty percent of the C3b was degraded by FI to smaller fragments when KCP-Fc was present at concentrations of 1.9 μm, 2.15 μm, and 1.25 μm, respectively, for short, medium, and long isoforms. This level of activity was calculated relative to FH, which catalyzed 50% FI cleavage of total C3b to the 64- and 40–38-kDa cleavage products (as FH did not induce production of C3dg) when present at a concentration of 50 nm. No cleavage was observed in the absence of FI (Fig. 6 B), and incubation of C3b with KCP alone did not result in any cleavage (not shown). All the cell-associated forms of KCP, including the naturally occurring form, were also found to be as effective as soluble KCP for the cleavage of C3b to iC3b and C3dg, while control CHO cells did not act as FI cofactors (Fig. 6 C). The ability of KCP to degrade cell-bound C3b was also measured by flow cytometry analysis. Sheep erythrocytes were coated with C3b in the absence of sensitizing antibody (EC3 cells) through three consecutive rounds of incubation with C3, FB, FD, and properdin under alternative pathway activating conditions. EC3 cells were then incubated overnight with FI alone or in the presence of various cofactor proteins, and the degree of C3b cleavage attained was measured by flow cytometry using a panel of C3d- and C3c-specific antibodies (Table I). The same amount of cell-surface C3d was detected irrespective of enzyme or cofactor added. However, C3c epitopes were almost entirely removed from cells incubated with FI in the presence of CR1 and KCP but not FH. The amount of C3c remained the same after overnight treatment with either FI alone or with buffer alone, indicating that no significant nonspecific cleavage of C3b occurred (Table I). The same trend in specific decreased fluorescence for cells incubated with KCP or CR1 was observed with two separate polyclonal antibodies against C3c as well as a polyclonal antibody against intact C3.Table IFlow cytometry analysis of sheep erythrocyte-bound C3b degradation productsAnti-C3dAnti-C3c (1)1-aTwo separate anti-C3c polyclonal antibodies, designated 1 and 2, were used.Anti-C3c (2)Anti-C3EC371.2 ± 4.9209 ± 2.7274.8 ± 788.8 ± 2.3EC3 + FI107.9 ± 4.5264.6 ± 12.9395.4 ± 14.4131.3 ± 11.58EC3 + FH + FI82.4 ± 0.7166.6 ± 3.9176.3 ± 17.171.04 ± 0.5EC3 + CR1 + FI67.4 ± 3.821.3 ± 4.725.16 ± 3.834.64 ± 1.1EC3 + KCP + FI80.8 ± 2.822.7 ± 0.321.7 ± 2.245.0 ± 7.21-a Two separate anti-C3c polyclonal antibodies, designated 1 and 2, were used.

The three different constructs occupied different flow cells of the chip. C3b and C4b were then injected for sufficient time to reach saturation (Fig. 7 A), and thenK D was calculated from a binding curve showing response at equilibrium ("
https://openalex.org/W2032086808,"Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified the μ2 subunit of the clathrin adaptor complex 2 as a protein interacting with the C-tail of the α1b-adrenergic receptor (AR). Direct association between the α1b-AR and μ2 was demonstrated using a solid phase overlay assay. The α1b-AR/μ2 interaction occurred inside the cells, as shown by the finding that the transfected α1b-AR and the endogenous μ2 could be coimmunoprecipitated from HEK-293 cell extracts. Mutational analysis of the α1b-AR revealed that the binding site for μ2 does not involve canonical YXXΦ or dileucine motifs but a stretch of eight arginines on the receptor C-tail. The binding domain of μ2 for the receptor C-tail involves both its N terminus and the subdomain B of its C-terminal portion. The α1b-AR specifically interacted with μ2, but not with the μ1, μ3, or μ4 subunits belonging to other AP complexes. The deletion of the μ2 binding site in the C-tail markedly decreased agonist-induced receptor internalization as demonstrated by confocal microscopy as well as by the results of a surface receptor biotinylation assay. The direct association of the adaptor complex 2 with a G protein-coupled receptor has not been reported so far and might represent a common mechanism underlying clathrin-mediated receptor endocytosis. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified the μ2 subunit of the clathrin adaptor complex 2 as a protein interacting with the C-tail of the α1b-adrenergic receptor (AR). Direct association between the α1b-AR and μ2 was demonstrated using a solid phase overlay assay. The α1b-AR/μ2 interaction occurred inside the cells, as shown by the finding that the transfected α1b-AR and the endogenous μ2 could be coimmunoprecipitated from HEK-293 cell extracts. Mutational analysis of the α1b-AR revealed that the binding site for μ2 does not involve canonical YXXΦ or dileucine motifs but a stretch of eight arginines on the receptor C-tail. The binding domain of μ2 for the receptor C-tail involves both its N terminus and the subdomain B of its C-terminal portion. The α1b-AR specifically interacted with μ2, but not with the μ1, μ3, or μ4 subunits belonging to other AP complexes. The deletion of the μ2 binding site in the C-tail markedly decreased agonist-induced receptor internalization as demonstrated by confocal microscopy as well as by the results of a surface receptor biotinylation assay. The direct association of the adaptor complex 2 with a G protein-coupled receptor has not been reported so far and might represent a common mechanism underlying clathrin-mediated receptor endocytosis. Desensitization to the effects of hormones and neurotransmitters is a fundamental regulatory mechanism of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; AR, α1b-adrenergic receptor; AP1, -2, -3, and -4, adaptor complex 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively; EST, expressed sequence tag; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; NHS, N-hydroxysuccinimide. function defined by a specific loss of responsiveness for those receptors that have been repeatedly stimulated by the agonist. Receptor desensitization results from the combination of multiple biochemical events occurring at different time frames: receptor-G protein uncoupling in response to receptor phosphorylation (seconds to minutes), internalization or endocytosis of cell surface receptors to intracellular compartments (minutes), and down-regulation of the total pool of receptors due to their decreased synthesis and/or increased degradation (hours) (1Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). A prominent role in homologous desensitization of GPCRs is played by G protein-coupled receptor kinases. Once the receptor is occupied by the agonist, it is recognized by the G protein-coupled receptor kinases and becomes phosphorylated (2Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The subsequent uncoupling of the receptor from the G protein is then mediated by arrestin proteins, which preferentially bind to the agonist-occupied phosphorylated receptor (3Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 130-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, during the last decade, β-arrestins have emerged as key regulatory molecules controlling various steps of receptor desensitization. Beyond their role in physical uncoupling of GPCRs from the G proteins (3Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 130-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), it has been demonstrated that β-arrestins target GPCRs to the endocytic machinery (4Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). In fact, it is believed that for those GPCRs that internalize in a clathrin-dependent manner, like the β2-adrenergic receptor (AR), targeting of the receptor-β-arrestin complexes to clathrin-coated vesicles is mediated by a dual interaction of β-arrestin with both clathrin heavy chain and the β2 subunit of the heterotetrameric clathrin adaptor complex 2 (AP2) (5Laporte S.A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 30760-30768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The AP2 complex directly links the clathrin coat with cargo transmembrane proteins that are sorted into coated pits and vesicles (8Pearse B.M. Smith C.J. Owen D.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and is composed of two large subunits, α and β2, of about 100 kDa and two smaller subunits, μ2 and σ2, of 50 and 17 kDa, respectively (9Robinson M.S. Bonifacino J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The AP2 adaptor can initiate endocytosis of membrane receptors by either associating directly with their cytoplasmic tail or by interacting with additional molecules, such as β-arrestins, as described for the β2-AR (5Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 7Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Direct interactions between AP2 and transmembrane proteins have been demonstrated, for example, for the transferrin receptor (10Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S.Q. Trowbridge I.S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 46251-46259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) but not for GPCRs. They are principally mediated by the μ2 subunit, which specifically associates with endocytosis signals including YXXΦ (where Φ represents a bulky hydrophobic residue) (14Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) and dileucine motifs (15Rodionov D.G. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6005-6008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) on the cytoplasmic portion of the transmembrane proteins (8Pearse B.M. Smith C.J. Owen D.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that the β2 subunit also participates in the recognition of dileucine motifs on the proteins (16Rapoport I. Chen Y.C. Cupers P. Shoelson S.E. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2148-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Previous reports have shown that the α1b-AR undergoes rapid endocytosis upon exposure to the agonist. This was shown both in DDT1-FM2 smooth muscle cells expressing endogenous receptors as well as in cells expressing the recombinant receptor (17Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Cotecchia S. DeBlasi A. Caron M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3098-3105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Fonseca M.I. Button D.C. Brown R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8902-8909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The molecular determinants involved in agonist-induced endocytosis of the α1b-AR reside within the C-tail of the receptor as demonstrated by the fact that truncation of this region almost completely abolished receptor desensitization and internalization (19Lattion A.L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22887-22893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A previous report suggested that the α1b-AR can internalize in clathrin-coated vesicles as shown by that fact that α1b-AR endocytosis can be blocked by hypertonic sucrose and that internalized receptors colocalize with transferrin receptors (18Fonseca M.I. Button D.C. Brown R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8902-8909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Moreover, we previously reported that agonist-induced internalization of the α1b-AR is, at least in part, mediated by β-arrestins (20Mhaouty-Kodja S. Barak L.S. Scheer A. Abuin L. Diviani D. Caron M.G. Cotecchia S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Despite this experimental evidence, our knowledge on the biochemical mechanisms and the molecular mediators controlling the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the α1b-AR is still at an early stage. To identify new proteins interacting with the α1b-AR that could potentially be involved in regulating receptor function, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system and identified the μ2 subunit of the AP2 complex. In this study, we demonstrate that the α1b-AR and μ2 subunit can directly interact through a polyarginine motif located on the C-tail of the receptor and that this interaction plays a role in agonist-induced internalization of the receptor. Our findings highlight a previously unappreciated mechanism that might also be involved in the endocytosis of other GPCRs. Expression Constructs—A cDNA fragment encoding the last 165 amino acids of the hamster α1b-AR (amino acids 351–515) (Fig. 2) was PCR-amplified and subcloned at EcoRI/SalI in pGEX4T1, pET30a, and pLexA plasmids to construct fusion proteins with GST, His6, and LexA at the N terminus of the C-tail of the receptor, respectively. For constructing GST fusion proteins with different fragments of the C-tail, cDNA fragments encoding amino acids 351–380, 351–395, 351–425, 351–449, and 351–477 of the α1b-AR were PCR-amplified and subcloned at EcoRI/SalI in pGEX4T1. The Y386A, Y447A, L450A/L451A, and L473A/L474A mutations were introduced into the C-tail-pGEX4T1 and C-tail-pLexA plasmids by standard PCR-directed mutagenesis using the Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). The full-length cDNA encoding the human μ2 subunit was PCR-amplified from EST 3538047 (accession number BE264960) and subcloned at HindIII-SalI in pEGFPN3 and pGEX4T1 to generate fusion proteins with GFP at the C terminus and GST at the N terminus of μ2, respectively. The full-length cDNAs encoding human μ1, μ3, and μ4 subunits identified in other AP complexes were PCR-amplified from EST 4954703 (accession number BG920410), EST 720361 (accession number AA2611409), and EST 748897 (accession number AI644755), respectively, and subcloned at EcoRI/SalI in pEGFPN3 to construct fusion proteins with GFP at the C terminus. For generating fusion proteins with GFP at the C terminus, DNA fragments encoding amino acids 1–163, 164–282, and 283–435 of μ2 were PCR-amplified and subcloned at HindIII/SalI into pEGFPN3. The full-length cDNA encoding the hamster α1b-AR (21Cotecchia S. Schwinn D.A. Randall R.R. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7159-7163Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified and inserted into the pEGFPN1 using EcoRI/AgeI to fuse GFP at the C terminus of the receptor (α1b-GFP). The T368-GFP and ▵371–378-GFP receptor mutants were constructed by PCR-directed mutagenesis of the α1b-GFP using the Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). To construct HA-tagged receptor forms, the N-terminal fragment of the wild type α1b-AR was amplified using primers encoding the HA (YPYDVPDYA) epitope at the 5′ end and subcloned into the pRK5 vector encoding the wild type receptor or its mutants. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The yeast strain L40 was transformed with the C-tail-pLexA plasmid encoding the α1b-AR C-tail fused to LexA, and clones were selected and subsequently transformed with 250 μg of a human brain Matchmaker cDNA library in the pACT2 vector (Clontech). Of 13 million double transformants, 40 exhibited moderate to strong growth on histidine-deficient plates. The library plasmids isolated from positive clones were used to cotransform the L40 strain with either the C tail-pLexA or the empty pLexA plasmid, and the specificity of the interactions was confirmed by growth on histidine-deficient plates as well as by β-galactosidase activity (Yeast Protocols Handbook; Clontech). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins in Bacteria— GST-tagged fusion proteins of μ2 and α1b-AR C-tail were expressed using the bacterial expression vector pGEX4T1 in the BL21DE3 strain of Escherichia coli and purified. Bacterial extracts containing GST fusion proteins were prepared by centrifugation of bacterial cultures, followed by lysis of the pelleted bacteria in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin), sonication, and centrifugation at 38,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. After incubating the supernatants with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C, the resin was washed with 10 bed volumes of buffer A and stored at 4 °C. GST fusion proteins were eluted from the resin with 5 mm reduced glutathione for 15 min at room temperature, dialyzed, and stored at -20 °C. His6-tagged fusion protein of the α1b-AR C-tail was expressed using the bacterial expression vector pET30 in BL21DE3 bacteria and purified. Extracts containing His6-tagged fusion proteins were prepared by centrifugation of bacterial cultures and lysis of pelleted bacteria in buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin). After a 1-min sonication, the lysates were centrifuged at 38,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The His6-tagged fusion proteins were purified by incubating the supernatant with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chelating resin (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was then washed five times with 10 bed volumes of buffer B and stored at 4 °C. His6-tagged fusion proteins were eluted from the resin with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin for 1 h at room temperature, dialyzed, and stored at -20 °C. The protein content of the eluates was assessed by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE gels. Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and gentamycin (100 μg/ml) and transfected at 50–80% confluence in 35- or 100-mm dishes using the calcium-phosphate method. After transfection, cells were grown for 48 h in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum before harvesting. The total amount of transfected DNA was of about 0.5–1 μg/35-mm dish and 10 μg/100-mm dish. GST Pull-down and Immunoprecipitation Experiments—For GST pull-down, HEK-293 cells expressing the various constructs grown in 100-mm dishes were lysed in 1 ml of buffer C (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Glutathione-Sepharose beads coupled to the different GST fusion proteins were incubated with 1.5 mg of proteins derived from the cell lysates in a total volume of 1 ml overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed five times with buffer C and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For immunoprecipitation experiments, HEK-293 cells expressing the various HA-tagged constructs grown in 100-mm dishes were lysed in 1 ml of buffer D (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% digitonin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. The solubilized material was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 5 μg of a rabbit anti-HA polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) or with control nonimmune IgG. After the addition of 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose, the incubation was continued for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by a brief centrifugation on a bench top centrifuge. The pellet was washed five times with buffer D and twice with PBS and then dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Imunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Samples were denatured in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (65 mm Tris, 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8) for 1 h at room temperature, separated on 10% acrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were incubated in TBS-Tween (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk overnight at room temperature, washed three times with TBS-Tween, and then incubated with the specific primary antibody diluted in TBS-Tween for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes with TBS-Tween, the membranes were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h, washed three times with TBS-Tween, and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The following affinity-purified primary antibodies were used for immunoblotting: mouse monoclonal anti-HA (200 μg/ml, 1:250 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), mouse monoclonal anti-GFP (400 μg/ml, 1:500 dilution; Roche Applied Science), mouse monoclonal anti-μ2 (1:250 dilution; Transduction Laboratories), mouse monoclonal anti-α-adaptin (1:250 dilution; Transduction Laboratories), and mouse monoclonal anti-β-adaptin (1:250 dilution; Transduction Laboratories). Solid Phase Overlay Assay—After SDS-PAGE and electroblotting of the samples, the nitrocellulose filters were incubated with TBS-Tween containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk and 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature and with 100,000 cpm/μl of32P-labeled His6-tagged α1b-AR C-tail in TBS-Tween containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 16 h at room temperature. After extensive washes in TBS-Tween, the blots were visualized by autoradiography. Purified His6-tagged C-tail (4 μg) was radiolabeled following its incubation with the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (0.1 μg) and [γ-32P]ATP (50 μCi) in 50 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 30 °C. The radiolabeled protein was separated from free [γ-32P]ATP on an Excellulose GF-5 desalting column (Pierce) equilibrated in TBS-Tween. Confocal Microscopy—HEK-293 cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected with the cDNAs encoding different GFP-tagged receptors. 48 h after transfection, cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 1 h and treated for various times with 10-4m epinephrine (Sigma) at 37 °C. After the treatment, cells were placed on ice, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, fixed for 10 min in PBS plus 3.7% formaldehyde, and mounted using Prolong (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). In the experiments measuring the effect of K44A dynamin mutant on receptor endocytosis, HEK-293 cells were cotransfected with the cDNAs encoding the GFP-tagged α1b-AR and the HA-tagged dynamin K44A mutant. 48 h after transfection, cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 1 h and treated for 1 h with 10-4m epinephrine at 37 °C. After two washes with ice-cold PBS, cells were fixed for 10 min in PBS plus 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized for 5 min with 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were incubated in PBS plus 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h and with 1:250 dilution of anti-HA polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h, followed by another incubation with Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h. The cells were then mounted using Prolong (Molecular Probes). GFP fluorescence or immunofluorescent staining were visualized on a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss). Cell Surface Biotinylation Experiments—HEK-293 cells grown in 100-mm dishes were transfected with the cDNAs encoding the HA-tagged α1b-AR or its T368 and ▵371–378 mutants. 48 h after transfection, cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 1 h and treated for various times with 10-4m epinephrine (Sigma) at 37 °C. After the incubation, cells were placed on ice and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Surface proteins were biotinylated by incubating cells with 500 μg/ml of the membrane-impermeable biotin analogue sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin (Pierce) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. Unreacted biotin was quenched and removed by three washes with ice-cold TBS at 4 °C. Biotinylated cells were then lysed with hypo-osmotic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the cellular homogenate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in buffer D (20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% digitonin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated for 30 s, and stirred for 6 h at 4 °C. The solubilized material was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated overnight with 40 μl of streptavidin-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted by brief centrifugation and washed five times with buffer D and twice with PBS. Biotinylated proteins were eluted by incubating the beads with 200 mm dithiothreitol for 2 h at 37 °C and separated on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. The biotinylated receptors were revealed by immunoblotting using anti-HA monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described above. The intensity of the band was quantified by densitometry of films exposed in the linear range, imaged using the Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad), and analyzed using NIH Image software (National Institutes of Health). In control experiments, we determined that the biotinylation reagent did not cross the plasma membrane, as shown by the fact that the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, which is cytoplasmic, could not be detected in streptavidin-Sepharose precipitates (results not shown). Identification of the μ2Subunit of the AP2 Complex as a Protein Interacting with the α1b-AR—It was previously reported that the C-tail of the α1b-AR plays an important role in the regulation of receptor desensitization and internalization (19Lattion A.L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22887-22893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Diviani D. Lattion A.L. Larbi N. Kunapuli P. Pronin A. Benovic J.L. Cotecchia S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28712-28719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the molecular players involved in these processes are not fully characterized. To identify novel regulatory proteins interacting with the C-tail of the α1b-AR, the last 165 amino acids of the receptor were used as bait to screen a human brain cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system. Three independent positive clones encoding the μ2 subunit of the AP2 complex were identified from 13 × 106 cotransformants, as assessed by their ability to grow in the absence of histidine and to produce β-galactosidase. To confirm the interaction between the C-tail of the receptor and μ2, the L40 yeast strain was transformed with the bait plasmid expressing the C-tail of the α1b-AR (α1b-AR C-tail-pLexA) in combination with either a pACT2 vector containing the μ2 cDNA (μ2-pACT2) or with empty pACT2 vector. As shown in Fig. 1A, yeast transformed with μ2-pACT2 were able to grow in the absence of histidine (upper panel) and to produce β-galactosidase (lower panel), whereas those transformed with the empty pACT2 vector did not. To provide biochemical evidence that the α1b-AR can associate with the μ2 subunit of the AP2 complex, pull-down experiments were performed by incubating the GST-tagged C-tail of the receptor with cell extracts of HEK-293 cells. We found that the μ2 endogenously expressed in HEK-293 cells specifically bound to GST-C-tail but not to GST alone (Fig. 1B). To assess whether the association between the α1b-AR and the μ2 subunit of the AP2 complex occurs through a direct interaction or is mediated through another protein, we monitored the ability of purified GST-μ2 to associate with the purified His6-tagged C-tail using a solid phase overlay assay. The autoradiography shown in Fig. 1C (left panel) indicates that the C-tail of the32P-labeled His6-tagged C-tail of the α1b-AR could specifically interact with GST-μ2, but not with GST alone. Control experiments showed that the GST-μ2 did not interact with 100 nm of an unrelated radiolabeled protein (regulatory subunit of protein kinase A) (results not shown). Altogether, these results strongly suggest that the μ2 subunit of the AP2 complex can directly interact with the C-tail of the α1b-AR. Identification of the Binding Site for μ2on the α1b-AR—The μ2 subunit of the AP2 complex has been shown to recognize endocytosis signals including tyrosine-based motifs (YXXΦ) and dileucine motifs on the cytoplasmic portion of membrane receptors (9Robinson M.S. Bonifacino J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Analysis of the primary sequence of the C-tail of the α1b-AR revealed the presence of two potential tyrosine-based motifs at positions 386 and 442 and of two potential dileucine motifs at positions 450 and 473 (Fig. 2). Moreover, two additional YXXΦ sequences can be found at positions 144 and 153 in the second intracellular loop of the receptor (Fig. 2). To assess whether these motifs can mediate the interaction between the α1b-AR and μ2, we generated GST-C-tail fusion proteins in which tyrosines 386 and 442 as well as the leucine doublets 450–451 and 473–474 were individually substituted by alanines and assessed their ability to interact with μ2 endogenously expressed in HEK-293 cells. Surprisingly, none of these mutations was able to disrupt the interaction between the C-tail of the receptor and μ2 (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained using the yeast two-hybrid system as an interaction assay (Fig. 3B). To investigate whether the two YXXΦ sequences located at positions 144 and 153 of the α1b-AR were involved in the interaction with μ2, we also constructed a GST fusion protein, including the second intracellular loop of the receptor. This fusion protein was not able to interact with the μ2 from HEK-293 cell extracts (results not shown). Altogether, these results suggest that the structural determinants of the α1b-AR mediating its interaction with μ2 are different from the canonical tyrosine-based or dileucine motifs. To further investigate the binding site for μ2 on the C-tail of the α1b-AR, we fused to GST a series of fragments of the C-tail carrying progressive truncations (Fig. 2) and assessed their ability to interact with μ2 endogenously expressed in HEK-293 cells. As shown in Fig. 3C, whereas different fusion constructs truncated up to residue 380 could interact with μ2, the GST-T368 fusion construct did not, thus suggesting that the region included between residues 380 and 368 is crucial for this interaction. Interestingly, the deletion of eight arginines at positions 371–378 completely abolished the binding of the C-tail to μ2, suggesting that the α1b-AR interacts with the μ2 subunit of the AP2 complex through a novel arginine-based binding domain (Fig. 2). Identification of the Binding Site for the α1b-AR on μ2— Recently, the crystal structure of the μ2 subunit of the AP2 complex has been solved (12Owen D.J. Evans P.R.

In addition, it has ill-defined roles in the transcription-coupled repair of oxidative DNA damage and likely also in transcription that are independent of its nuclease activity. We have used DNA binding and footprinting assays with various substrates to gain insight into how XPG interacts with DNA. Ethylation interference footprinting revealed that XPG binds to its substrates through interaction with the phosphate backbone on one face of the helix, mainly to the double-stranded DNA. By comparing DNA binding and cleavage activity using single-/double-stranded DNA junction substrates differing in the length of the single-stranded regions, we have found that the 3′ but not the 5′ single-stranded arm was necessary for DNA binding and incision activity. Furthermore, we show that although a 5′ overhang is not required for XPG activity, an overhang containing double-stranded DNA near the junction inhibits the nuclease but not substrate binding activity. Apparently, junction accessibility or flexibility is important for catalysis but not binding of XPG. These results show that XPG has distinct requirements for binding and cleaving DNA substrates.

Nucleases with specificity for DNA structural features rather than sequence are important for many aspects of DNA metabolism, including replication, recombination, and repair (1Suck D.

One such structure-specific endonuclease, human XPG, is involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) 1The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; CS, Cockayne syndrome; ss/dsDNA, single-/double-stranded DNA; XP, xeroderma pigmentosum; WT, wild type; nt, nucleotide(s); PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ExoIII, exonuclease III; TBE, Tris borate/EDTA electrophoresis buffer. in a poorly defined pathway of transcription-coupled base excision repair of oxidative lesions and likely also in efficient RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription (3O'Donovan A.

Two inherited human syndromes are associated with deficiencies in XPG: xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne syndrome (CS). Although the XP phenotype arises from a defect in NER and is characterized by acute sensitivity to UV light and an extremely high incidence of skin cancer (8Stary A. Sarasin A. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), defects in transcription-coupled base excision repair and transcription are likely responsible for certain manifestations of CS such as skeletal, neurological, and developmental abnormalities (9van Gool A.J. van der Horst G.T. Citterio E. Hoeijmakers J.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4155-4162Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Whether a defect in XPG causes XP or combined XP/CS is dependent on the position and type of mutation in the XPG gene. Point mutations resulting in a defect in the nuclease activity generally lead to an XP phenotype, whereas mutations resulting in truncation of the protein cause an XP/CS phenotype (10Nouspikel T. Lalle P. Leadon S.A. Cooper P.K. Clarkson S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3116-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the model that the nuclease activity of XPG is important for NER, whereas the involvement of XPG in transcription-coupled base excision repair and transcription requires binding of XPG to specific DNA structures but not its nuclease activity. At the biochemical level, only the involvement of XPG in NER is understood in any detail. In mammals, NER is the major DNA repair pathway responsible for the removal of adducts formed by UV light and environmental mutagens from DNA (11Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D.C.1995Google Scholar). Two partially overlapping NER subpathways have been discerned: one process called global genome repair, which is able to eliminate NER lesions from all locations in the genome, and transcription-coupled repair, which is responsible for the accelerated removal of lesions from actively transcribed DNA strands (12Svejstrup J.Q. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Global genome repair has been elucidated in some detail and can be divided in three major stages: (i) damage recognition and DNA opening to form a bubble-shaped structure around the lesion by the XPC-HR23B, TFIIH, XPA, RPA, and XPG factors, (ii) endonucleolytic incision 5′ and 3′ of the lesion by ERCC1-XPF and XPG, respectively, and release of an oligonucleotide of 24–32 residues, and (iii) gap-filling repair synthesis and ligation to restore the original DNA sequence (13de Laat W.L.

Within NER, XPG also fulfills roles that are independent of its nuclease activity in the opening of the DNA helix around the lesion and the formation of a stable damage recognition complex (16Evans E. Moggs J.G. Hwang J.R. Egly J.M. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6559-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 17Mu D. Wakasugi M. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28971-28979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The physical presence but not the catalytic activity of XPG is also required for the subsequent 5′ incision by ERCC1-XPF (18Wakasugi M. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16030-16034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Conversely, the nuclease function of XPG may be regulated through interaction with other NER factors, notably TFIIH, RPA, and XPA (19de Laat W.L. Appeldoorn E. Sugasawa K. Weterings E. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2598-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 20Araujo S.J. Nigg E.A. Wood R.D. Mol. Cell.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2157-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In transcription-coupled repair, the damage is thought to be recognized by the damage-stalled RNA polymerase. Although the detailed mechanism of transcription-coupled repair has not yet been clarified, it is thought to proceed similarly to global genome repair in steps subsequent to damage recognition. The enzymatic activities of XPG have been studied in vitro, where it shows remarkable structure-specific properties, cleaving artificial DNA structures that contain ss/dsDNA junctions including bubbles, splayed arms, stem-loops, and flap substrates with the same polarity as in the NER reaction (22O'Donovan A. Scherly D. Clarkson S.G. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15965-15968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Cloud K.G. Shen B. Strniste G.F. Park M.S. Mutat.

The XPG protein (1186 amino acids) is a member of the Fen1 (flap endonuclease 1) family of structure-specific nucleases (2Lieber M.R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Members of this family have a conserved nuclease core composed of the “N region” (N-terminal) and the “I region” (internal), which contain a number of highly conserved acidic residues that are essential for nuclease activity (25Shen B. Nolan J.P. Sklar L.A. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9173-9176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 26Constantinou A. Gunz D. Evans E. Lalle P. Bates P.A.

Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Furthermore, they share some conserved motifs that are implicated in DNA binding (28Park M.S. Valdez J. Gurley L. Kim C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27823-27829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 29Stucki M. Jonsson Z.O. Hübscher U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7843-7849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The distance between the N and I regions varies among the family members and is about 700 amino acids in XPG. This “spacer region” has been shown to be dispensable for nuclease activity in the yeast XPG homolog Rad2 but is required for protein-protein interactions (30Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Although the Fen1 family members Fen1, XPG, and Exo1 (exonuclease 1) share a conserved nuclease domain and bind to ss/dsDNA junctions, there are differences in the exact substrate specificity of these three proteins. Although XPG efficiently processes bubble or stem-loop substrates, Fen1 and Exo1 only act on substrates that have free 5′ ssDNA ends (31Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 32Lee B.I. Wilson 3rd., D.M. J. Biol.

In the absence of high resolution structures of Fen1 family members bound to DNA, indications of how these proteins might interact with their DNA substrates are based on DNA footprinting experiments of Fen1, Exo1, and the 5′ exonuclease domain of DNA polymerase I and on modeling studies based on the structures of the free proteins (27Hosfield D.J.

Furthermore, we have studied the structural elements required for DNA binding and cleavage activities of XPG by using various substrates. Unexpectedly, XPG displays distinct requirements for binding and cleaving its DNA substrates. These observations might help to elucidate the catalytic and structural roles of XPG in various repair processes. All of the enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs unless indicated otherwise. [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]ddATP were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. All of the other chemicals and reagent were from Sigma or Fluka. Routine molecular biological procedures were performed using standard protocols (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides Used in This Study—Oligonucleotides used were either synthesized on an Expedite 8909 nucleic acid synthesis system or purchased from Metabion (Germany) and purified by denaturing PAGE. 5′ end labeling was carried out using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. For 3′ labeling, the oligonucleotides were incubated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and [α-32P]ddATP using the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Promega). The labeled oligonucleotide was annealed with the complementary strand in annealing buffer (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) by heating for 5 min at 95 °C and cooling to room temperature. Substrates consisting of two oligonucleotides (substrates 1, 2, and 9) were annealed with a 3-fold excess of the unlabeled cold complementary strand, whereas for substrates with more than two oligonucleotides (substrates 3–8), a 2-fold excess of the two unlabeled oligonucleotides was used. Annealing efficiencies were tested for every substrate by native PAGE and were found to be higher than 95%. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used were as follows (the nucleotide located at the junction in the substrates is highlighted in bold): A20,5′-TCAAAGTCACGACCTAGACACTGCGAGCTCGAATTCACTGGAGTGACCTC; A2, 5′-CACTGCGAGCTCGAATTCACTGGAGTGACCTC; A1, 5′-ACTGCGAGCTCGAATTCACTGGAGTGACCTC; A0, 5′-CTGCGAGCTCGAATTCACTGGAGTGACCTC; B19, 5′-GAGGTCACTCCAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGCAGCAATGAGCACATA CCTAGT; B3, 5′-GAGGTCACTCCAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGCAGCAA; B2, 5′-GAGGTCACTCCAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGCAGCA; B1, 5′-GAGGTCACTCCAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGCAGC; B0, 5′-GAGGTCACTCCAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGCAG; C19, 5′-ACTAGGTATGTGCTCATTG; D20, 5′-TGTCTAGGTCGTGACTTTGA; D17, 5′-CTAGGTCGTGACTTTGA; E39a, 5′-ACTAGGTATGTGCTCATTGTGTCTAGGTCGTGACTTTGA; E39b, 5′-ACTAGGTATGTGCTCATTTAGTCTAGGTCGTGACTTTGA; and F30, 5′-GAGGTCACTCCAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGCAG. The substrates were annealed as shown in Table I. For the 90-mer bubble substrate with a bubble size of 30 nt, strand 1 (5′-CCAGTGATCACATACGCTTTGCTATTCCGGT30CCGTGCCA CGTTGTATGCCCACGTTGACCG) was annealed with strand 2 (5′-CGGTCAACGTGGGCATACAACGTGGCACGGT30CCGGAATAGCAAAGCGTATGTGATCACTGG). For the stem-loop structure, a self-complementary oligonucleotide with the sequence (5′-GCCAGCGCTCGGT22CCGAGCGCTGGC) was used, and the stem-loop structure was formed by annealing. Construction of Recombinant Baculoviruses for XPG Expression in Sf9 Insect Cells—A 246-bp BglII-Asp718 fragment containing the 3′ terminus of XPG cDNA was excised from the pBS-XPG plasmid (39Scherly D. Nouspikel T. Corlet J. Ucla C. Bairoch A. Clarkson S.G. Nature. 1993; 363: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides sc-404 (5′-GATCTGTGTTTGGGAAGAAAGAAGGAAACTAAGACGTGCGAGGGGAAGAAAAAGGAAAACTCACCATCACCACCATCATTAAG-3′) and sc-405 (5′-GTACCTTAATGATGGTGGTGATGGTGAGTTTTCCTTTTTCTTCCCCTCGCACGTCTTAGTTTCCTTCTTTTCTTCCCAAACACA-3′) were annealed to generate a BglII-Asp718 fragment encoding the 3′ end of XPG followed by 6 histidine residues. This fragment was then cloned between the BglII and Asp718 sites of pBS-XPG to form pBS-XPG-His6. pBS-XPGE791A-His6 was generated by replacing the 1843-bp NdeI-BglII fragment from pBS-XPG-His6 with the corresponding fragment from pGEM-XPGE791A encoding the E791A substitution (26Constantinou A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5637-5648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). pFastBac1-XPG-His6 and pFastBac1-XPGE791A-His6 were generated by cloning the 3646-bp NotI-Asp718 fragment from pBS-XPG-His6 and pBS-XPGE791A-His6, respectively, between the NotI and Asp718 sites of the vector pFastBac1 (Invitrogen). Recombinant XPG baculoviruses were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Expression and Purification of WT and Mutant XPG Proteins—Serum-free conditioned Sf9 insect cells were grown in suspension at 27 °C under extensive stirring (according to instructions from Invitrogen). For protein expression, 300 ml of Sf9 cells (1.5 × 106 cells/ml) were infected with the appropriate baculovirus at an multiplicity of infection of 5 and were grown in an Erlenmayer flask with air-permeable filter caps at 27 °C and 200 rpm. The cells were harvested 48–54 h after infection by low speed centrifugation and resuspended in 40 ml of buffer A (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF, containing one EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet from Roche Applied Science). After incubation on ice for 20 min, NaCl was added to a final concentration of 800 mm, and the lysate was sonicated on ice (Bandelin Sonicator, 60% power at 30% interval) by three 1-min intervals, with at least 2 min of cooling on ice between each interval. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was supplemented with 1 mm PMSF and incubated overnight with 4 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) in presence of 1 mm imidazole. The beads were collected by low speed centrifugation and resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A containing 800 mm NaCl and 1 mm imidazole and packed in column (1 × 5 cm). The column was washed stepwise with 20 ml of buffer A containing 1 mm imidazole with 500 ml of NaCl, 20 ml of 10 mm imidazole with 300 mm NaCl, or 10 ml of 50 mm imidazole with 300 mm NaCl. XPG was eluted with 6 ml of buffer A containing 100 mm imidazole with 300 mm NaCl. The eluate was then applied on a 1-ml HiTrapS column (Amersham Biosciences) after a 1:2 dilution in buffer B (25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The protein was eluted with a 25-ml gradient from 100 mm to 1 m NaCl. XPG eluted between 450 and 700 mm NaCl. Fractions containing XPG were pooled and diluted to 150 mm NaCl with buffer C (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF) and loaded on a 1-ml HiTrapQ column (Amersham Biosciences). XPG eluted in 2.5 ml between 400 and 500 mm NaCl with a 30-ml gradient from 150 mm to 1 m NaCl. The protein concentration was estimated from absorption at 280 nm. Purified protein was flash frozen in aliquots and stored at -80 °C. Typically, 0.3–1.2 mg of pure XPG protein at a concentration of 0.2–0.5 mg/ml was obtained. Endonuclease Assay—2.5 nm of 5′32P end-labeled DNA substrate was incubated with 1.25–5 nm XPG in nuclease buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 30 mm KCl) in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2 or 0.5 mm MnCl2 in a reaction volume of 20 μl for 1–2 h. The reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of formamide loading buffer (90% (w/v) formamide, 0.5× TBE, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and xylene cyanol FF) and heating for 5 min at 95 °C. The samples were loaded onto a 15 or 20% (cross-linking ratio 19:1) denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 1× TBE and 7 m urea and run for 1–2 h at 2000 V. The bands were visualized by autoradiography, and quantification was carried out using a Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA) Storm860 PhosphorImager and Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant version 1.2 software. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—5′32P end-labeled substrate (1 nm) with or without a 10–500-fold excess of unlabeled competitor DNA was incubated with various amounts of XPG in EMSA buffer (50 mm Tris pH 6.8, 20 mm KCl, 15% glycerol, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) in a reaction volume of 20 μl. Unless indicated otherwise, no metal cofactor was used. After equilibration at room temperature for 10–30 min, the samples were loaded on a 5% (37.5:1) native polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× TBE and run in precooled buffer at 90 V for 2 h at room temperature. The gels were dried, and the bands were visualized by autoradiography. Exonuclease III Footprinting—The XPG mutant E791A (12–30 nm) and 5′32P end-labeled substrate (1)20 (2.5 nm) were incubated at room temperature under EMSA conditions (see above) in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2 and 100-fold excess of cold dsDNA competitor (substrate 9) for 20 min. ExoIII digestion was initiated at 15 °C by the addition of 2 units (1 μl) of ExoIII, allowed to proceed for 10–20 min, and stopped by the addition of EDTA to 50 mm and formamide loading buffer and heating for 10 min at 75 °C. The reactions were analyzed on a 15% sequencing gel, and the bands were visualized by autoradiography. Ethylation Interference DNA Footprinting—5 pmol of 5′32P end-labeled oligonucleotides A20 or B19 was suspended in 50 μl of 100 mm calcium cacodylate (Sigma) and added to a volume of 150 μl of freshly prepared ethylnitrosourea (170 mg/ml in ethanol). Ethylation was performed in Parafilm-sealed safe lock Eppendorf tubes for 75 min at 50 °C under gentle agitation. Excess ethylnitrosourea was then extracted 6 times with a 1-ml portion of water-saturated diethyl ether. The remaining traces of ether were evaporated for 5 min using vacuum centrifugation. The dried ethylated oligonucleotides were redissolved in TE buffer (25 μl) and annealed in annealing buffer (see above) with a 5-fold excess of the complementary strand by heating for 5 min at 90 °C and cooling to room temperature. For the DNA binding reaction, 25 nm of substrate 1 (A20:B19) were incubated under EMSA conditions described above in presence of a 100-fold excess of cold dsDNA competitor (substrate 9) with 150 nm of WT XPG in a volume of 20 μl for 5–10 min at room temperature, resulting in about 40–50% complex formation. The mixture was run on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel for 90 min at 90 V. The bands of bound and unbound fractions were visualized by autoradiography, excised, and electroeluted (1× TBE buffer) into 10 m NH4OAc buffer for 4 h at 90 V. The volume of the electroeluted fractions was reduced on Microcon YM-10 filters (Millipore) and washed twice with TE buffer before precipitation with 100% ethanol in presence of 10 mg/ml tRNA followed by washing twice with 80% ethanol. DNA strand cleavage at ethylated phosphate sites was achieved by incubation in 100 μl of 140 mm NaOH at 90 °C for 30 min. After neutralization with 15 μl of 1 m AcOH, the samples were ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in gel loading buffer. Following quantification of the samples in a scintillation counter, the samples were loaded onto a 15% 7 m urea denaturing gel along with T, C, and G/A sequencing ladders prepared from the same target DNA (40Maxam A.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 4613-4619Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Briefly, the T-specific modification was prepared by incubation of 0.5 pmol of denatured labeled oligonucleotide in 1.27 mm potassium permanganate for 20 min, for C in 3 m hydroxylamine hydrochloride, pH 6.0, and for G/A in 80% formic acid in a volume of 20 μl. Modified oligonucleotides were ethanol-precipitated and cleaved at modified sites by incubation for 15 min at 90 °Cin1.1 m pyrrolidine and evaporated to dryness. The gels were visualized and quantified by PhosphorImager. Activity of Purified XPG Protein on ss/dsDNA Junctions—Wild type and E791A mutant human histidine-tagged XPG endonuclease was purified from Sf9 insect cells as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1A). We compared the structure-specific nuclease activity of XPG on splayed arm, bubble, and stem-loop DNA substrates (Fig. 1B). Incubation of XPG in the presence of either MgCl2 (lanes 2, 5, and 8) or MnCl2 (lanes 3, 6, and 9) resulted in efficient DNA cleavage of the splayed arm (22 and 91%, respectively) and bubble substrates (70 and 96%), whereas only weak activity was found on the stem-loop substrate (3 and 4%). The cleavage positions were mapped 1 nt into the duplex region of the junction for the splayed arm substrate, whereas the bubble and stem-loop structures were cleaved 1 nt into the ssDNA just 5′ of the ss/dsDNA junction (data not shown). Although a bubble-shaped structure might formally resemble a reaction intermediate of NER more closely than a splayed arm structure, we decided to perform our further analysis of substrate binding and cleavage by XPG with the splayed arm substrate, because binding of the protein at two equivalent positions of a bubble would complicate such an analysis. We designate a 5′ ssDNA overhang of a splayed arm substrate as an unpaired overhang with a 5′ end, whereas a 3′ ssDNA overhang refers to the unpaired overhang with a 3′ ssDNA end. Structure-specific Binding of XPG to ss/dsDNA Junctions—We used EMSA to define conditions that allow specific binding of the XPG endonuclease to ss/dsDNA junctions. Incubation of XPG with a splayed arm substrate (substrate 1 in Table I) in the absence of metal cofactor resulted in the formation of a band indicative of a protein-DNA complex (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Optimal binding was observed over a broad range of pH (6–8.5) in the presence of bovine serum albumin and glycerol and at a KCl concentration of <25 mm. Stable DNA binding was observed if the concentration of substrate was ≥1 nm and that of XPG was ≥6 nm. At high XPG concentrations (≥10 nm), we observed the appearance of a second band, which may be due to the formation of a dimeric XPG-DNA complex. Incubation of the substrate 1 with XPG in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ resulted in cleavage (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4), indicating that the XPG-DNA complex observed in EMSA is in an active conformation. The XPG mutant E791A, which was shown to have severely reduced endonuclease activity (26Constantinou A. Gunz D. Evans E. Lalle P. Bates P.A. Wood R.D. Clarkson S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5637-5648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), formed a more stable complex with substrate 1 in the presence of Mg2+ and Mn2+, although the substrate was partially cleaved under the conditions used (Fig. 2A, lanes 8 and 9). Through small variations in pH or enzyme concentration, cleavage could be prevented entirely without compromising DNA binding (data not shown). The presence of Ca2+, which does not support nuclease activity in most enzymes, resulted in the formation of stable protein-DNA complex with both WT and the E791A mutant (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 10). Apparently, the presence of divalent metal ions is not required for DNA binding, and the identity of the metal has no significant influence on the binding affinity. To determine whether the interaction of XPG with the substrate was specific for a ss/dsDNA junction, we tested the effect of various DNA competitors on the binding reaction. Oligonucleotides containing only the ssDNA (Fig. 2B, lanes 3–5) or dsDNA (lanes 6–8) part of the splayed arm substrate had no effect on the binding reaction (a >500-fold excess was needed to detect weak competition), whereas the addition of a 40-fold excess of specific competitors, either flap substrate 3 (lanes 9–11) or splayed arm substrate 1 (lanes 12–14), abolished the binding reactions under the same conditions. These observations demonstrate that XPG shows a strong binding preference for DNA molecules containing ss/dsDNA junctions. Exonuclease III Footprinting of XPG-DNA Complex—To gain more insight into the way XPG is bound to the ss/dsDNA junctions, we used various footprinting assays. We first used ExoIII footprinting. ExoIII is a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease that digests ssDNA or dsDNA in a progressive fashion. If an additional protein is bound to the DNA, ExoIII stalls on the 3′ side of the protein-binding site, leading to preferential incision at that position. Because the exonuclease requires the presence of Mg2+ for activity, footprinting was performed with the XPG active site mutant E791A under conditions allowing only ≤5% of incision to occur (data not shown).

HEK293 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding inactive DNA polymerase-γ harboring a D1135A substitution (POLGdn). The cells rapidly lost mtDNA (t 12 = 2–3 days) when expression of the transgene was induced. Concurrent reduction of mitochondrial encoded mRNA and protein, decreased cellular growth rate, and compromised respiration and mitochondrial membrane potential were observed. mtDNA depletion was reversible, as demonstrated by restoration of mtDNA copy number to normal within 10 days when the expression of POLGdn was suppressed following a 3-day induction period. Long term (20 days) expression of POLGdn completely eliminated mtDNA from the cells, resulting in ρ0 cells that were respiration-deficient, lacked electron transport complex activities, and were auxotrophic for pyruvate and uridine. Fusion of the ρ0 cells with human platelets yielded clonal cybrid cell lines that were populated exclusively with donor-derived mtDNA. Respiratory function, mitochondrial membrane potential, and electron transport activities were restored to normal in the cybrid cells. Inducible expression of a dominant negative DNA polymerase-γ can yield mtDNA-deficient cell lines, which can be used to study the impact of specific mtDNA mutations on cellular physiology, and to investigate mitochondrial genome function and regulation.

Inducible expression of a dominant negative DNA polymerase-γ can yield mtDNA-deficient cell lines, which can be used to study the impact of specific mtDNA mutations on cellular physiology, and to investigate mitochondrial genome function and regulation. Mitochondria are unique among cellular organelles, in that their constituent proteins are encoded by two separate genomes. The nuclear and mitochondrial genomes are structurally and functionally distinct and use different genetic codes and separate systems for replication and expression (1Lopez M.F. Kristal B.S.

Most of the estimated 1500 mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear DNA, translated on cytoplasmic ribosomes, and imported into the organelle. The remaining 13 mitochondrial proteins, all subunits of protein complexes involved in electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation, are encoded by the mtDNA. 1The abbreviations used are: mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; POLG, DNA polymerase-γ; POLGdn, dominant negative D1135A DNA polymerase-γ; COII, cytochrome oxidase subunit 2; ND1, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1; TMRM, tetramethylrhodamine methylester; RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism; TPP+, tetraphenyl phosphonium; DNP, dinitrophenol; ATP8, ATP synthase subunit 8; COIV, cytochrome oxidase subunit IV; ATP6, ATP synthase subunit 6; Δψm, mitochondrial membrane potential; qPCR, quantitative PCR; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid 1The abbreviations used are: mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; POLG, DNA polymerase-γ; POLGdn, dominant negative D1135A DNA polymerase-γ; COII, cytochrome oxidase subunit 2; ND1, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1; TMRM, tetramethylrhodamine methylester; RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism; TPP+, tetraphenyl phosphonium; DNP, dinitrophenol; ATP8, ATP synthase subunit 8; COIV, cytochrome oxidase subunit IV; ATP6, ATP synthase subunit 6; Δψm, mitochondrial membrane potential; qPCR, quantitative PCR; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Because electron transport complexes are composed of both nuclear and mitochondrial encoded subunits, normal oxidative metabolism is dependent upon the integrity and coordinated expression of both genomes. Indeed, disease states are associated with mutations of the mtDNA (4Wallace D.C. Science. 1999; 283: 1482-1488Google Scholar, 5Schapira A.H.V. Curr. Opin.

Clark K.M. Morris A.A.M. Taylor R. Macphail S. Lightowlers R.M. Turnbull D.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 145-146Google Scholar), as well as with nuclear genes that encode respiratory complex subunits (9Suomalainen A. Kaukonen J. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 106: 53-61Google Scholar,10Yao J. Shoubridge E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2541-2549Google Scholar). Determining whether a disease state is associated with respiratory chain dysfunction or is caused by a nuclear or mitochondrial mutation(s) can be challenging. Cybrid cell technology addresses this challenge by evaluating foreign mitochondrial genomes against a common nuclear background (11Chomyn A. Lai S.T. Shakeley R. Bresolin N. Scarlato G. Attardi G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 54: 966-974Google Scholar, 12King M.P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264B: 304-313Google Scholar), allowing one to determine whether specific mtDNA alterations have functional consequences. The construction of cybrid cell lines typically entails fusing donor platelets, which contain mitochondria but no nuclei, with cultured cells from which all resident mtDNA has been eliminated: so-called ρ0 cells. The cells are repopulated by the donor mtDNA and ultimately express a phenotype that is determined in part by the mitochondrial genome of the donor. ρ0 cells are most often produced by exposing cells in culture to ethidium bromide, a dye that intercalates into DNA and prevents replication (12King M.P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264B: 304-313Google Scholar, 13Bogenhagen D.F. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1276-1281Google Scholar, 14King M.P. Attardi G.

Rimoldi M. DiDonato S. Bisson R. Zeviani M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2017-2023Google Scholar). Alternate agents such as rhodamine 6G (17Trounce I. Wallace D.C. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1995; 22: 81-85Google Scholar), ditercalinium (18Inoue K. Ito S. Takai D. Soejima A. Shisa H. LePecq J. Segal- Bendirdjiam E. Kagawa Y. Hayashi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15510-15515Google Scholar), and dideoxycytidine (19Anderson C. Drug Dev. Res. 1999; 46: 67-79Google Scholar) have also been used to deplete cells of mitochondrial DNA. Two significant problems have been observed when such toxins are used to produce ρ0cells. First, some cell types have proven to be resistant to the agents. Second, ethidium bromide and other intercalating agents can damage nuclear DNA, complicating the interpretation of phenotypic changes that occur in the mtDNA-depleted cell lines or in cybrids constructed with these ρ0 cells. These limitations prompted us to explore a more specific method to deplete mtDNA from cultured cells. Mitochondrial DNA replication is catalyzed by DNA polymerase-γ (POLG), a mitochondria-specific enzyme that is part of a larger mitochondrial replication complex (20Ropp P.A. Copeland W.C. Genomics. 1996; 36: 449-458Google Scholar, 21Clayton D.A. Hum. Reprod. 2000; 15 Suppl. 2: 11-17Google Scholar). Because POLG is spatially and functionally restricted to the mitochondria, inhibition of the POLG activity should result in loss of mtDNA without affecting nuclear DNA. Moreover, because all cell types that have mitochondria are dependent upon POLG for mtDNA replication, inhibition of POLG should deplete mtDNA from any cell type that can adapt to the need for anaerobic metabolism. Spelbrink and colleagues (22Spelbrink J.N. Toivonen J.M. Hakkaart G.A.J. Kurkela J.M. Cooper H.M. Lehtinin S.K. Lecrenier N. Back J.W. Speijer D. Foury F. Jacobs H.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24818-24828Google Scholar) identified specific residues that are required for the catalytic activity of mammalian POLG, and demonstrated significant reduction of mtDNA copy number in HEK293 cells that transiently expressed inactive POLG, in which one of two key aspartate residues (position 890 or 1135) was replaced by asparagine or alanine, respectively (22Spelbrink J.N. Toivonen J.M. Hakkaart G.A.J. Kurkela J.M. Cooper H.M. Lehtinin S.K. Lecrenier N. Back J.W. Speijer D. Foury F. Jacobs H.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24818-24828Google Scholar). They did not produce stable clones of the mtDNA-deficient cells, perhaps because constitutive expression of dominant negative POLG throughout the transfection and selection processes prevented the cells from adapting to the need for anaerobic metabolism. We employed an alternate expression and selection strategy to stably incorporate into cultured human HEK293 cells a dominant negative POLG sequence in which aspartate 1135 was replaced with alanine. By using an inducible expression system, we incorporated the construct and selected clones before subjecting the transfected cells to the additional stress imposed by expression of the dominant negative POLG. Induced expression of the dominant negative POLG gene caused rapid depletion of mtDNA with concomitant reduction of gene products and mitochondrial bioenergetic function. Cell populations devoid of mtDNA were produced by this method and used to create cybrid cell lines harboring a foreign mitochondrial genome. cDNA encoding human POLG was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR (SuperScript first-strand synthesis system; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using human heart total RNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as template, and oligonucleotide primers complementary to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the published coding sequence (20Ropp P.A. Copeland W.C. Genomics. 1996; 36: 449-458Google Scholar). The 3′ primer included a FLAG sequence. The resulting PCR product was subcloned into the vector pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequence verified by standard techniques using an ABI 3700 sequencer. A dominant negative form of POLG (22Spelbrink J.N. Toivonen J.M. Hakkaart G.A.J. Kurkela J.M. Cooper H.M. Lehtinin S.K. Lecrenier N. Back J.W. Speijer D. Foury F. Jacobs H.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24818-24828Google Scholar), which we term POLGdn, was produced by altering codon 1135 from GAC (Asp) to GCG (Ala) using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system). The finished POLGdn sequence was subcloned into pCDNA4/TO (Invitrogen), which contains a tet operator and a zeocin resistance gene, and verified by sequencing. T-REx293 cells (Invitrogen) were grown in ρ0 media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 4 mml-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μg/ml uridine, 1000 units/ml penicillin, and 1000 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For transfections, cells were plated at ∼50% confluence in six-well culture dishes (∼106 cells/well) 24 h prior to the addition of 1 μg of plasmid DNA/well with Effectene reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Transfected cultures were grown an additional 3 days and then replated in 100-cm dishes and put under selection by addition of 200 μg/ml zeocin to the culture medium. Clones were tested for expression of POLG by addition of 1 μg/ml tetracycline followed by Western blotting with FLAG antibody. Cells expressing POLGdn were grown on polylysine-coated coverslips and stained with MitoTracker Red dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 37 °C. Fixed cells were permeabilized for 15 min at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, 0.3% Triton X-100, 3% bovine serum albumin prior to incubation with primary and secondary antibodies. Hoechst stain (Molecular Probes) was applied after the secondary antibody incubation. Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with ProLong Antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes), dried overnight, and sealed with clear nail polish. Total DNA was isolated from cell samples using a DNAeasy kit (Invitrogen) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), followed by RQ1 DNase treatment (Promega, Madison, WI) at 1 unit/μg of RNA for 30 min at 37 °C. The RNA was then purified by phenol chloroform extraction and ammonium acetate/ethanol precipitation. First strand cDNA was then generated by reverse transcription (Invitrogen SuperScript first-strand synthesis system). Quantitative PCR was carried out using a Prism 7700 sequence detection system with primers and fluorescence-labeled probes specific for various genes. Standard curves were constructed for each primer/probe set to verify performance. Each sample was run in triplicate for each measurement. A relative quantification method was employed for analysis, comparing the signal of mitochondrial gene probes to a nuclear gene probe signal as standard. Protein (30 μg) from whole cell lysates was subjected to SDS-PAGE on NuPAGE 4–12% gels. After transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, blots were blocked with Tris-buffered saline (plus 0.2% Tween 20) containing 2.5% nonfat milk solids and 2.5% bovine serum albumin, and probed with primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer. Primary antibodies used were: mouse anti-human COII, mouse anti-human COIV, and mouse anti-human ATPβ (Molecular Probes); rabbit-anti-human ATP8 (raised against amino acids 39–58; MITOP sequence data base, mips.gsf.de/proj/medgen/mitop/); and anti-actin. Blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit antibody and chemiluminescent substrate (Amersham Biosciences); proteins of interest were detected by autoradiography. T-REx293/POLGdn cells grown with or without tetracycline for 10 days were incubated in buffer (120 mm NaCl, 3.1 mm KCl, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mmNa2SO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm HEPES) containing 100 nmtetramethylrhodamine methylester (TMRM) for 30 min before being mounted in a perfusion chamber and placed on a 37 °C temperature-controlled stage. TMRM (100 nm) was maintained in the medium throughout the experiment. Imaging was performed using a 75-watt xenon lamp-based monochromator (T.I.L.L. Photonics GmbH, Martinsried, Germany). The emission light was detected using a CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Japan), and data acquisition was controlled using Simple PCI software (Compix, Cranberry, PA). Cells were excited at 540 nm, and the emission was collected through a 610/75-nm filter. Images were collected every 20 s for a period of 10 min. ρ0 cells were fused with donor platelets to create cybrid cells as previously reported (15Miller S.W. Trimmer P.A. Parker Jr., W.D. Davis R.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1897-1907Google Scholar). Briefly, a venous blood sample was collected from a volunteer after obtaining informed consent. Platelets were separated by differential centrifugation and fused with ρ0 cells as previously described (15Miller S.W. Trimmer P.A. Parker Jr., W.D. Davis R.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1897-1907Google Scholar). Unfused ρ0 cells were eliminated from cultures by omission of pyruvate and uridine from the culture medium. Surviving colonies were retrieved by trypsinization in glass cloning rings after 3 weeks of selection. In “mock fusion” samples, in which ρ0 cells were taken through the fusion protocol in the absence of platelets, cells did not survive in selection medium. Total DNA from platelets and cell lines was isolated with a DNAeasy kit (Qiagen) and used as template to PCR-amplify the mitochondrial ATPase 6 gene. PCR fragments were purified with a PCR Clean-up kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) and digested with the restriction endonuclease Fnu4HI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and the resulting fragments were separated on a 4% TBE agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light. Basal medium for mitochondrial functional assays contained 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mm potassium phosphate, 100 μm EGTA, and was supplemented as indicated either by 5 mm glutamate plus 5 mm malate, 10 mm succinate plus 2 μm rotenone, or 2 mm ascorbate plus 2 mm N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine. Membrane potential, respiration, and optical density of the cell suspension were recorded simultaneously in a 1-ml custom-made multiparameter chamber (Boris F. Krasnikov, Burke Medical Research Institute, White Plains, NY). Membrane potential was followed in the presence of 2 μm tetraphenyl phosphonium (TPP+) using a TPP+-sensitive electrode connected to an amplifier (Vernier Software, Beaverton, OR). Oxygen consumption was measured using a Clark-type electrode (Diamond General, Ann Arbor, MI) connected to an oxygen meter (Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH). Optical density of the cell suspension was measured at 660 nm and served as an independent confirmation of the consistency of cell counts. For these experiments, cells were harvested, resuspended in the growth medium, and maintained during the experimental day in suspension under vigorous shaking at room temperature. For the experimental run, an aliquot containing 2.7 × 107 cells was withdrawn, quickly pelleted (1 min at 200 × g), resuspended in 1 ml of basal assay medium to remove traces of the growth medium, pelleted again, transferred into the chamber, permeabilized with 0.015% digitonin, and measurements were begun. Citrate synthase activity was measured according to standard procedures (15Miller S.W. Trimmer P.A. Parker Jr., W.D. Davis R.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1897-1907Google Scholar). Briefly, 500,000 cells were pre-incubated for 3 min in Tris buffer (125 mm, pH 8.0) containing 10% Triton X-100, 2 mm5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and 6 mm acetyl CoA. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 mmoxalacetic acid, and the linear rate was recorded for 3 min. Samples were analyzed in triplicate in each experiment. Complex I activity was measured by following the oxidation of NADH fluorimetrically. Cells were suspended at 200,000 cells/ml in sodium phosphate (10 mm, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) and subjected to three freeze/thaw cycles. A suspension of 400,000 cells was added to a cuvette together with 2 μg/ml antimycin A, 1 mm KCN, and 13 mm NADH. Samples were pre-incubated for 5 min until a flat base line was observed. Decyloubiquinone (600 mm) was added to the sample, and the rate was recorded for 6 min. Rotenone (2 μg/ml) was added and the rate recorded for an additional 6 min. The rotenone sensitivity was routinely >80%. The rotenone-inhibited rate was subtracted from the non-rotenone inhibited rate, and values were presented as relative fluorescence units/min × 106 cells. Samples were analyzed in duplicate in each experiment. Complex II activity was measured according to Birch-Machin et al. (23Birch-Machin M. Jackson S. Kler R.S. Turnbull D.M. Lash L.L. Jones D.P. Methods in Toxicology (Mitochondrial Dysfunction). Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1993: 51-69Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were suspended at 200,000 cells/ml in sodium phosphate (10 mm, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) and subjected to three freeze/thaw cycles. Cells were then pre-incubated with 20 mm succinate for 10 min at 30 °C. Antimycin A (2 μg/ml), rotenone (2 μg/ml), KCN (1 mm), and dichlorophenolindophenol (50 μm) were added. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C and a base line recorded at 600 nm for 3 min. The reaction was then started with 65 μm ubiquinol and monitored for 5 min. To obtain the complex II specific activity, samples were analyzed in parallel with the addition of 20 mm malonate. Samples were analyzed in triplicate in each experiment. Complex IV activity was measured by following the oxidation of reduced cytochrome c at 550 nm with 580 nm as a reference wavelength, using a modification of previously reported methods (23Birch-Machin M. Jackson S. Kler R.S. Turnbull D.M. Lash L.L. Jones D.P. Methods in Toxicology (Mitochondrial Dysfunction). Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1993: 51-69Google Scholar,24Errede B. Kamen M.D. Hatefi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 40-47Google Scholar). Reduced cytochrome c (15 μm) was added to a MES buffer (100 mm MES, pH 6.0, 10 μm EDTA, 30 °C) containing 30 mm n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. The non-enzymatic rate was recorded for 1 min, and then 50,000 cells were added to the assay. Control experiments with the addition of 1 mm KCN were performed in parallel. Samples were analyzed in triplicate in each experiment. Protein was measured using the BCA Protein Assay reagent kit from Pierce. We produced a dominant negative form of DNA polymerase-γ in which aspartate 1135 was replaced by alanine (POLGdn), and spliced it into pCDNA4/TO, a mammalian expression vector regulated by the tet operator. This plasmid was used to transfect the cell line T-REx293, which is a derivative of the HEK293 cell line that expresses the tet repressor in a constitutive manner. In the absence of tetracycline, expression of POLGdn was repressed in these cells. Addition of tetracycline de-repressed transcription, and production of the mutant polymerase ensued under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Cells stably propagating a copy of this construct were selected with zeocin in the absence of tetracycline, which maintained repression of the POLGdn gene. Using this strategy, the transfected cells were taken through the selection process without the added metabolic stress caused by mtDNA loss resulting from POLGdn expression. Surviving clones were isolated, amplified, and then induced for POLGdn expression with tetracycline (Fig.1). Positive clones exhibited tight regulation of the transgene, with no detectable POLGdn in uninduced cultures. To determine the location of recombinant POLGdn in the stable clones, immunofluorescent staining was performed. T-REx293/POLGdn cells were induced by tetracycline addition for 2 days, followed by staining with anti-FLAG antibody linked to Alexa Fluor 488 to visualize POLGdn. Mitotracker Red was also applied to visualize mitochondria, and Hoechst dye was added to stain the nucleus as a reference (Fig.2). The POLGdn pattern precisely overlapped the Mitotracker Red pattern, confirming localization of the overexpressed recombinant protein to the mitochondria. In uninduced cells, no POLGdn signal was observed (data not shown). The average doubling time of uninduced T-REx293/POLGdn cells was ∼26 h. After the addition of tetracycline, the growth rate remained normal for the first 5 days, but then slowed abruptly (Fig. 3). A marked increase in the acidification rate of the growth media also occurred after 5 days, necessitating daily media replacement for the duration of the experiment. The doubling time of cells during days 6 through 14 of tetracycline treatment was approximately one fifth of the normal rate. Treatment of non-transfected parental T-REx293 cells with tetracycline for up to 21 days had no effect on growth rate (data not shown). qPCR was used to monitor the copy number of mtDNA in T-REx293/POLGdn cells. We used a relative quantitation method in this analysis, comparing the signal produced by mitochondrial gene probes to the signal from nuclear gene probes. In uninduced cells, the mtDNA copy number was typically 400–500 times higher than the nuclear gene value, consistent with the presence of multiple mitochondrial genomes per cell. Addition of tetracycline caused a time-dependent reduction of the mtDNA copy number, as indicated by the decreases in the copy numbers relative to the nuclear actin gene of three selected mitochondrial encoded genes, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1), cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COII), and ATP synthase subunit 8 (ATPase 8; Fig. 4 A). The marked decrease in the growth rate of induced cells at day 6 (Fig. 3) coincided with the reduction of mtDNA content to ∼10% of the starting level (Fig. 4 A). By day 10 of induction, the cellular content of mtDNA was reduced by ∼99%. The persistence of a normal doubling time until mtDNA copy number was reduced by 90% is consistent with previous reports that most of the mtDNA population of a cell must be compromised before a measurable phenotypic change occurs (5Schapira A.H.V. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2000; 13: 527-532Google Scholar, 26Boulet L. Karpati G. Shoubridge E.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 51: 1187-1200Google Scholar). To assess the impact of POLGdn on mitochondrial encoded mRNA levels, total RNA was extracted from T-REx293/ POLGdn cells at various time points after induction, reverse transcribed into cDNA, and measured by qPCR. The decline in the mRNA levels of ND1, COII, and ATPase 8 in induced cells closely paralleled the reduction in DNA copy number (Fig. 4 B). The content of a mitochondrially encoded protein, COII, was also measured in these cells. Equal amounts of cell lysates collected at various time points of induction were analyzed by Western blots probed for COII and actin (Fig.5 A). The cellular content of COII was reduced in a time-dependent manner, whereas the amount of actin did not change significantly when POLGdn expression was induced. These results confirm that POLGdn-dependent reduction of mtDNA was accompanied by depletion of the corresponding gene products (Fig. 5 B). We tested T-REx293/POLGdn cells to determine whether mtDNA depletion could be reversed when tetracycline was withdrawn. The ability of the cells to repopulate mtDNA after repression of POLGdn expression was critical for the production of cybrids, which require functional endogenous POLG to amplify the foreign mtDNA introduced during the cybrid fusion. If POLGdn expression could not be fully repressed after eliminating mtDNA, cybrid production would not be possible. T-REx293/POLGdn cells were exposed to tetracycline for 3 days and subsequently maintained in culture without tetracycline. Samples were taken each day for a total of 12 days, and DNA and protein extracts were prepared and analyzed. qPCR measurements revealed a sharp decline in mtDNA content through day 4 of the experiment, followed by recovery to a normal level by day 12 (Fig.6). The rate of mtDNA restoration during the final 4 days of the experiment was similar to the rate of mtDNA depletion during the initial 4 days (t 12 ∼ 2–3 days). Western blot analysis of POLGdn expression in parallel samples revealed significant accumulation of POLGdn protein within 24 h, with maximal content observed at day 3 (Fig. 6). POLGdn protein disappeared rapidly after removal of tetracycline, and remained undetectable from day 4 to 10 (Fig. 6, inset). The results of this experiment demonstrated that mtDNA depletion was reversible in this system and predicted that production of cybrids that are dependent upon endogenous POLG was feasible. To produce cells devoid of mtDNA, we exposed T-REx293/POLGdn cultures to tetracycline continuously for 20 days. The cultures were then replated in fresh medium without tetracycline. After 15 days of culture in the absence of tetracycline, a condition that represses POLGdn expression, two distinct cellular morphologies were evident. In most of the wells, the total cell number remained low and individual cells grew separately or in small clusters. However, a few wells developed large colonies containing hundreds of tightly packed cells in addition to the background of scattered cells present in all the wells. mtDNA content of wells containing only scattered cells was very low as measured by qPCR, whereas mtDNA copy numbers in wells containing a large colony were normal or near normal (Table I). The large colony phenotype probably represented cells with one or more residual copies of mtDNA, which was replicated following repression of POLGdn expression. The sharp contrast in growth characteristics of cells with or without mtDNA provided an easy means of identifying candidate ρ0 populations, which were confirmed by qPCR analysis (Table I). “Clone 7A-1” was deemed to be ρ0and was used for subsequent analyses.Table ImtDNA levels of ρ0 candidate cell linesCell lineMitochondrial/nuclear DNA ratioSlow-growing cells7A-10.00187A-20.002912C-10.004812C-20.0036Fast-growing cells7A-375497A-7221712C-1926312C-58415Parental linesT-REx293506T-REx293/POLGdn552 Open table in a new tab ρ0 cells produced by prolonged POLGdn expression (clone 7A-1) were used to construct cybrid cells.

https://openalex.org/W2037446339,"Introduction of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into a wide variety of cells and organisms results in post-transcriptional depletion of the homologue endogenous mRNA. This well-preserved phenomenon known as RNA interference (RNAi) is present in evolutionarily diverse organisms such as plants, fungi, insects, metazoans, and mammals. Because the identification of the targeted mRNA by the RNAi machinery depends upon Watson-Crick base-pairing interactions, RNAi can be exquisitely specific. We took advantage of this powerful and flexible technique to demonstrate that selective silencing of genes essential for viral propagation prevents in vitro and in vivo viral infection. Using the baculovirus Autographa californica, a rapidly replicating and highly cytolytic double-stranded DNA virus that infects many different insect species, we show for the first time that introduction of dsRNA from gp64 and ie1, two genes essential for baculovirus propagation, results in prevention of viral infection in vitro and in vivo. This is the first report demonstrating the use of RNAi to inhibit a viral infection in animals. This inhibition was specific, because dsRNA from the polyhedrin promoter (used as control) or unrelated dsRNAs did not affect the time course of viral infection. The most relevant consequences from the present study are: 1) RNAi offers a rapid and efficient way to interfere with viral genes to assess the role of specific proteins in viral function and 2) using RNAi to interfere with viral genes essential for cell infection may provide a powerful therapeutic tool for the treatment of viral infections.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). This well-preserved phenomenon known as RNA interference (RNAi) is present in evolutionarily diverse organisms such as plants, fungi, insects, metazoans, and mammals (fore review see Ref. 2Hammond S.M. Caudy A.A. Hannon G.J. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that in plants RNAi may serve as a mechanisms of defense against viral infections (3Waterhouse P.M. Wang M.B. Lough T. Nature. 2001; 411: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). The physiological role of RNAi in animals remains to be established, although possible roles in organism development, germ line fate, and host defenses against transposable elements and viruses have been suggested (4Finnegan E.J. Wang M. Waterhouse P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R99-R102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this regard, recent experimental evidence shows modulation of HIV-1 replication in human cell lines by exogenous dsRNA from several portions of the viral genome (5Jacque J.M. Triques K. Stevenson M. Nature. 2002; 418: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). In a different study, dsRNA conferred viral immunity in human cells against poliovirus (6Gitlin L. Karelsky S. Andino R. Nature. 2002; 418: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Although the effect of dsRNA to prevent viral infections has been tested in cell lines, it remains to be established whether RNAi also works in organisms. To test this hypothesis we used a well-studied insect virus, the Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcNPV). This virus is a member of a group (family Baculoviridae) of large double-stranded DNA viruses that infect many different insect species (7Jackson J.A. Bioprocess. Technol. 1991; 13: 402-413PubMed Google Scholar). The AcNPV GP64 glycoprotein is a major component of the nucleocapsid of budded viruses (BV) and is required for BV entry into host cells by endocytosis (8Monsma S.A. Oomens A.G. Blissard G.W. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4607-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, GP64 is a key element for cell-to-cell infection and virus propagation (8Monsma S.A. Oomens A.G. Blissard G.W. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4607-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another gene essential for baculovirus proliferation produces the immediate early protein (IE1). This phosphoprotein regulates the transcription of early viral genes (9Kovacs G.R. Guarino L.A. Summers M.D. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5281-5288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of the N-terminal domain of IE1 results in the loss of transcriptional activation, and the resulting viruses cannot be replicated (9Kovacs G.R. Guarino L.A. Summers M.D. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5281-5288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these two proteins are excellent candidates to test if RNAi can prevent viral infection in vitro and in vivo. Recombinant AcNPV in conjunction with Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf 9 and Sf 21) insect cell lines have been extensively used for the heterologous expression of a wide variety of genes (7Jackson J.A. Bioprocess. Technol. 1991; 13: 402-413PubMed Google Scholar). We have produced a recombinant baculovirus containing the genes for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and β-galactosidase (AcNPV-GFP), which we have used as reporters of cell infection in Sf21 insect cells and larvae. Because introduction of dsRNA results in powerful and selective gene silencing in different cells (including insect cells), one would expect that transfecting insect cells with dsRNA from gp64 prior to virus exposure could prevent virus propagation, because the BV produced by dsRNA-treated cells would lack GP64 protein. In agreement with this prediction, cells infected with AcNPV-GFP and previously transfected with dsRNA from a portion of gp64 (dsRNA-gp64) do not show GFP fluorescence, and the GP64 protein could not be detected in the membrane of these cells. Because the very late polyhedrin promoter drives GFP production, the lack of GFP expression indicates that dsRNA treatment prevents viral infection in culture. Similar results were obtained with cells transfected with dsRNA from ie1 (dsRNA-ie1). In this case the inhibition was even stronger as expected when interfering with the synthesis of a transcriptional activator essential for viral replication. To test if silencing gp64 and ie1 genes may interfere also with viral infection in vivo, we used the larvae from the insect Tenebrio mollitor (mealworm beetle). Injection of AcNPV-GFP into the hemolymph of the larvae from this insect results in death of 100% of the larva within the following 7 days. Dead insects show high levels of GFP fluorescence and β-galactosidase activity, the two reporter genes present in the recombinant AcNPV-GFP baculovirus. Injection of dsRNA-gp64 or dsRNA-ie1 1 day prior to the injection with AcNPV-GFP prevents larva death by over 90%, whereas the surviving insects do not show GFP fluorescence or β-galactosidase activity. All these results show for the first time that the introduction of dsRNA into culture cells and living animals, to interfere with the synthesis of viral proteins essential for baculovirus infection, results in potent inhibition of viral infection in vitro and in vivo. The most relevant consequences from the present study are: 1) RNAi offers a rapid and efficient way to interfere with viral genes to assess the role of specific proteins in viral function (reverse genetics in baculovirus) and 2) using RNAi to interfere with viral genes essential for cell infection may provide a powerful therapeutic tool for the treatment of viral infections. Reagents—All salts were analytical grade purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside (X-gal, obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). o-Nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside (ONPG) was purchased from Research Organics Inc. (Cleveland, OH). The enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) vector (pEGFP-N1) was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Cell Culture—Insect Sf21 cells were obtained from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA) and cultured in Grace's medium (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with lactalbumin hydrolysate, yeastolate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). Production of Recombinant AcNPV-GFP Baculovirus—The cDNA from GFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was cloned in the pBB4 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) next to the polyhedrin promoter. The pBB4-GFP vector was recombined with linear AcNPV DNA following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). After two plaque assays, the recombinant baculovirus containing the GFP (AcNPV-GFP) was amplified twice and the titer was determined by plaque assay. This recombinant baculovirus was used in the studies described in this work. dsRNA Synthesis—Double-stranded RNA was synthesized in vitro using the Megascript kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, nucleotides 109330–109949 were amplified by PCR from the entire virus genome. This sequence corresponds to the first 619 nucleotides from gp64 as verified by sequence analysis. The sequence was cloned in the pPD129.36 vector multiple cloning site, which is flanked by two T7 opposing promoters (10Timmons L. Fire A. Nature. 1998; 395: 854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). The T7 promoter sequence, including the fragment of gp64 was amplified by PCR using universal T7 primers, and this sequence was used for the in vitro transcription to obtain the dsRNA with the T7 polymerase. For the synthesis of dsRNA from GFP, the entire gene sequence was used and for polyhedrin the entire promoter sequence (GenBank™ X06637). The ie1 gene is formed from a promoter sequence and the sequence resulting in the transcriptional activator protein. The dsRNA from ie1 was synthesized from nucleotides 19-470 (ATG is in position 1) corresponding to the N-terminal domain from the IE1 protein. For single-stranded RNA production, the vector was linearized with HindIII, and in vitro transcription was performed (positive strand). The antisense strand was synthesized after linearizing the vector with NotI. In all cases, 5 μg of each dsRNA using Cellfectin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was introduced into Sf21 cells (1 × 106 cells) 48 h prior to infection with recombinant baculovirus. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting—The percentage of infected cells (GFP-expressing cells) and fluorescence intensity was assessed by FACS (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) analysis 48 h postinfection using the multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) reported in the figure legends. Control uninfected cells were used to adjust the number of GFP-positive cells and mean fluorescence (20,000 events/sample). Acquisition and analysis of the FACS data were performed using Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA). Confocal Microscopy—Infected Sf21 cells were fixed 48 h postinfection with a buffer containing 3% paraformaldehyde Sigma (St. Louis, MO) as previously described (11Reyes-Cruz G. Vazquez-Prado J. Muller-Esterl W. Vaca L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 76: 658-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and incubated with the specific GP64 antibody (AcV5) eBioscience (San Diego, CA). A second anti-mouse antibody conjugated with rhodamine (Zymed, San Francisco, CA) was used to detect gp64-specific fluorescence. Cells were analyzed using a Bio-Rad confocal system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) attached to a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope equipped with a 60× oil-immersed objective. GFP fluorescence was obtained after exciting the cells with 395 nm and reading fluorescence at 540 nm (green channel). For gp64 detection, the excitation wavelength was 570 and emission was collected at 590 nm (red channel). Double labeling was observed in yellow, the combination of green (GFP) and red (GP64) channels. β-Galactosidase Activity Assay—dsRNA-treated cells were pelleted and resuspended in 0.05 ml of Reporter lysis buffer 1× (Promega, Madison, WI). β-Galactosidase activity was quantified using the enzymatic hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside (ONPG, Research Organics Inc., Cleveland, OH). The reaction was produced in triplicates on 96-well plates. Reactions were begun with the addition of 0.2 ml of 4 mg/ml ONPG at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 0.05 ml of 1 m Na2CO3. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Dynex MRX II), and β-galactosidase activity was determined using the equation, β-galactosidase activity = (Abs420 × 1.7)/(0.0045 × time × mg/ml protein in the lysate × ml of lysate used). The blank (uninfected cells exposed to ONPG) was subtracted in all cases. Plaque Assay—Plaque assays were performed in six-well plates according to the manufacturer's instruction manual Bac-N-Blue™ (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). In short, Sf21 cells were plated at 2.0 × 106 cells/well, allowed to attach for 30 min, and infected 1 h at 27 °C with serial dilutions (in 1 ml of Grace media, 10% FBS) of the supernatant obtained from transfected in infected cells, as indicated in the figure legend (see Fig. 2). After the incubation period the media was aspirated and 2 ml of Grace media, 10% FBS, 1.5% low melting point agarose (Invitrogen) was added. Finally, 1 ml of Grace media with 10% FBS was added over the agarose. Cells were monitored for GFP-positive plaque formation after 72 h. The GFP-positive plaques were quantified, and the plaque-forming units/ml (pfu/ml) was calculated by multiplying the number of GFP-positive plaques by dilution reciprocal. All dilutions were repeated at least twice. RNA Purification and RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from dsRNA-transfected or untreated cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. All RNA samples were quantified by spectrophotometry and run on agarose gel to check the quality and integrity of total RNA. To avoid DNA contamination, 5 μg of total RNA was treated with 15 units of DNase I RNase-free (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 20 min at 37 °C. After a phenol-chloroform extraction, reverse transcriptions reactions were done with the SuperScript™ One Step RT-PCR system from Invitrogen using gene-specific primers (0.2 μm). β-Actin: 5′-GATATGGAGAAGATCTGGCACCAC-3′ and 5′-TGGGGCAGGGCGTAGCC-3′; gp64: 5′-GAAAACAGTCGTCGCTGTCA-3′ and 5′-TATAGTCGACGAGCACTGCAACGCGCAAATG-3′; ie1: 5′-GCGCCGTATTTAATGCGTTT-3′ and 5′-GAGGAATTTCTATGCCGGTTTC-3′; gfp: 5′-ATATCCCGGGATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG-3′ and 5′-GCTCGTCGACCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGC-3′. For each RT-PCR reaction, 200 ng of RNA were used in a 50-μl reaction. A retrotranscription step (50 °C for 30 min and 94 °C for 2 min) was followed by 21 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 50 s. To ensure that there was no DNA contamination in the RT-PCR experiments, controls without reverse transcriptase were performed in all cases. In all presented data, RT-PCR products were resolved by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and analyzed after ethidium bromide staining in a Typhoon 8600 variable mode imager (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Electron Microscopy—Sf21 control (uninfected) or infected cells were fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde in saline buffer for 2 h at room temperature as previously described (12Molinari J.L. Tato P. Rodriguez D. Solano S. Rubio M. Sepulveda J. Parasitol. Res. 1998; 84: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For negative stain, viruses were purified from the supernatant of infected cells using the polyethylene glycol method (13Porfiri E. Evans T. Bollag G. Clark R. Hancock J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, the supernatant of infected cells was centrifuged to eliminate cell debris, and 20% polyethylene glycol in 1 m NaCl was added. The supernatant was centrifuged again, and the pellet was rinsed twice with distilled water. The pellet was resuspended and used for negative stain studies using a scanning electron microscope (Jeol, JSM-5410LV) at low vacuum (12Molinari J.L. Tato P. Rodriguez D. Solano S. Rubio M. Sepulveda J. Parasitol. Res. 1998; 84: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Insect Infection—T. mollitor (mealworm beetle) larvae were obtained at a local pet store and maintained in the laboratory in a plastic container. Larvae were injected in the hemolymph with 0.1 μg of the different dsRNAs nude or with distilled water (control). 24 h later larvae were injected again in the hemolymph with 2 μl of AcNPV-GFP viral stock with a titer of 1 × 10-7. Dead insects were assayed for GFP fluorescence and β-galactosidase activity. To assess the GFP fluorescence, injected insects were explored with the confocal microscope using a low magnification objective (10×, Nikon). For β-galactosidase activity, the insects were injected in the hemolymph with 2 μl of 0.05% X-gal in Me2SO. Selective Inhibition of Baculovirus Infection of Sf21 Cells by dsRNA from gp64 and ie1—We explored the effect of transfecting Sf21 cells with different dsRNAs prior to AcNPV-GFP infection. For these experiments we used four different multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.), 0.05, 0.5, 1, and 5. Fig. 1 illustrates a representative example of the effect of different dsRNAs on the fluorescence of GFP at am m.o.i. of 0.05 obtained 72 h postinfection. As illustrated in this example, the fluorescence of GFP was greatly reduced by transfecting the cells (48 h prior to AcNPV-GFP infection) with dsRNA from gfp or gp64 but not with dsRNA from the polyhedrin promoter used as control. At this time of postinfection, 90.2 ± 2.1% (n = 5) of AcNPV-GFP-treated cells show high GFP fluorescence when compared with control (uninfected) cells. Transfecting the cells with dsRNA-gfp 48 h prior to AcNPV-GFP infection resulted in significant reduction of GFP fluorescent cells to 9.1 ± 0.7% (n = 5). Exposing the cells to dsRNA from gp64 (dsRNA-gp64) prior to AcNPV-GFP infection resulted also in an important reduction in the number of GFP fluorescent cells to 8.3 ± 0.5% (n = 5). Transfecting the cells with dsRNA from the polyhedrin promoter (dsRNA-PhP) did not affect significantly the GFP fluorescence, showing values of 89.1 ± 1.2% (n = 5). These results show that introduction of dsRNA from the gp64 gene prevents GFP fluorescence induced by recombinant baculovirus. Because the very late polyhedrin promoter (PhP) drives GFP production, the lack of GFP expression indicates that dsRNA-gp64 treatment prevents viral infection in culture. Cells transfected with dsRNA-gp64 did not show the β-galactosidase activity of the second reporter gene introduced in the recombinant AcNPV-GFP (Fig. 2B). The early-to-late (PETL) promoter drives β-galactosidase production. Thus, using these two reporter genes one can monitor early and very late viral gene expression. Transfecting insect cells with dsRNA-gfp prevents GFP fluorescence by favoring GFP mRNA degradation, but as expected, this does not appear to affect viral infection. Cells that interfered with dsRNA-gfp showed β-galactosidase activity, indicating the succession of typical viral infection (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, recombinant AcNPV-GFP is a lytic baculovirus, therefore, cells infected with AcNPV-GFP will lyse eventually. Even at a low m.o.i. of 0.05, all insect cells infected with AcNPV-GFP and treated with dsRNA-gfp were lysed 7 days after infection. Fig. 2 shows all the RNAi experiments performed at m.o.i. values of 0.05, 0.5, 1, and 5. In this figure the percentage of GFP-fluorescent cells is presented in panel A, and the β-galactosidase activity from the same cells is shown in panel B. As illustrated in this figure, cells treated with dsRNA from gp64 showed low levels of GFP fluorescence and β-galactosidase activity at 0.05 and 0.5 m.o.i. At m.o.i. 1 and 5 dsRNA-gp64 did not prevent GFP fluorescence or β-galactosidase activity from AcNPV-GFP-infected cells. This result is somewhat expected, because all cells would be infected by the initial virus application and do not depend on the production of viral progeny. When using m.o.i. of 0.05 (one viral particle for every 20 cells), the infection of the rest of the cells not infected by the initial viral application would depend upon production of new viruses by the cells initially infected. Because cells are transfected with dsRNA-gp64, one would expect that the GP64 protein could not be produced and the new viruses would lack this protein. At m.o.i. 0.05, dsRNA-gp64 strongly inhibits GFP fluorescence (Fig. 2A) and β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 2B). These results are consistent with previous studies found in the literature indicating the gp64 gene deletion result in noninfective baculoviruses (8Monsma S.A. Oomens A.G. Blissard G.W. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4607-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these results, transfecting the cells with dsRNA-ie1 inhibited GFP fluorescence and β-galactosidase activity even at m.o.i. values of 1 and 5 (Fig. 2). The IE1 transcriptional factor is essential for initiating the transcription of several early baculovirus genes. In fact, deletion of the ie1 gene results in viruses that cannot be replicated (9Kovacs G.R. Guarino L.A. Summers M.D. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5281-5288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the results presented here are consistent with the idea that interfering with the production of the initial transcriptional activator for viral genes (ie1) would prevent the production of viral proteins and interfere with viral replication. In agreement with all these results, the baculoviruses isolated from the supernatant of dsRNA-gp64- and dsRNA-ie1-treated cells were less infective when compared with untreated cells or cells transfected with dsRNA-gfp prior to baculovirus infection (Fig. 2C). As expected from cells exposed to dsRNA-gp64, only baculoviruses collected from cells infected with low m.o.i. values (0.05 and 0.5) showed reduced plaque-forming units (pfu). At m.o.i. 1 and 5 the baculoviruses produced by dsRNA-gp64-treated cells showed pfu indistinguishable from cells not exposed to dsRNA or cells treated with dsRNA-gfp (Fig. 2C). Notice that the effect of dsRNA is specific for the gene explored, because cells exposed to dsRNA-gfp showed a significant reduction of GFP fluorescence but not β-galactosidase activity. As expected from these experiments, baculoviruses isolated from dsRNA-gfp-treated cells showed pfu similar to cells not exposed to any dsRNA. The RNAi effects observed are specific for the double-stranded RNA, because transfecting the cells with single-stranded RNA prior to baculovirus infection did not alter the time course of viral infection and did not prevent GFP fluorescence or β-galactosidase activity (data not shown). A small reduction in GFP fluorescence was obtained with the negative single RNA strand of gp64 of 20 ± 5% compared with the large reduction of 92 ± 7% obtained with dsRNA-gp64 (n = 6). This result demonstrates that the inhibition induced is specific for the double RNA strand, as expected from an RNAi phenomenon. dsRNA-gp64-treated Cells Do Not Express GP64 Glycoprotein—Confocal microscopy studies using a specific GP64 antibody showed protein localization at the cell plasma membrane. The pattern of localization of GP64 contrasted with the generalized fluorescence of GFP, as expected for a soluble protein. Fig. 3 shows representative images obtained with a rhodamine-labeled antibody for GP64 (red channel) and GFP fluorescence (green channel). As illustrated in the figure, the transfection with dsRNA-gfp prevented GFP fluorescence but did not affect GP64 expression of insect cells infected with AcNPV-GFP at m.o.i. 0.05. Transfecting the cells with dsRNA-gp64 eliminated the fluorescence of both GFP and GP64, leaving only a few cells showing both signals. These cells may reflect cells infected by the initial application of recombinant AcNPV-GFP. Interestingly, when AcNPV-GFP was used at an m.o.i. of 1, dsRNA-gp64 could not prevent GFP fluorescence, however, the transfection prevented GP64 protein production, as illustrated by the lack of red fluorescence in Fig. 3. This result is consistent with the data presented in Fig. 2, suggesting that the initial viral application can infect most of the cells (therefore the GFP production is intact), yet the cells do not produce GP64 protein. The transfection of cells with dsRNA-ie1 prevented GFP and GP64 production even at an m.o.i. of 1 (Fig. 3). Only a few cells per field showed both green and red fluorescence, because not all the cells were efficiently transfected (Fig. 3, bottom panel to the left). This result is also consistent with the findings using FACS. Transfecting the cells with dsRNA-PhP did not alter the GP64 and GFP fluorescence, showing values similar to those obtained from cells exposed to recombinant AcNPV-GFP alone (Fig. 3). Western blotting analysis illustrated in Fig. 4A confirmed the selective RNAi effect observed with dsRNAs. The upper panel shows the amount of GP64 and GFP proteins obtained at three different m.o.i. values (1, 5, and 10) in the absence of dsRNA. For GP64, two bands were observed reproducibly in all assays. These bands may represent different glycosylation forms of the protein previously described (14Oomens A.G. Monsma S.A. Blissard G.W. Virology. 1995; 209: 592-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The second panel in Fig. 4A shows the GP64 and GFP protein contents from cells transfected with dsRNA-gfp 48 h prior to infection. Notice the reduction of GFP protein content at m.o.i. 1 and 5, whereas the GP64 protein content was unaltered. The third panel in Fig. 4A shows the effect of transfecting the cells with dsRNA-gp64 prior to viral infection. In this case, GP64 protein content was significantly reduced at an m.o.i. of 1. At m.o.i. 5 and 10 substantial GP64 protein was detected. These results are consistent with the data previously shown using FACS and confocal microscopy. Finally, the lower panel of Fig. 4A illustrates the effect of transfecting cells with dsRNA-ie1. Under these conditions, both GFP and GP64 proteins were dramatically reduced at all m.o.i. values explored. Consistent with these findings, cells transfected with dsRNA-ie1 and later infected with AcNPV-GFP could be maintained in culture for several months, even at m.o.i. 10. Insect cells divided normally like uninfected cells. On the contrary, cells transfected with dsRNA-gp64 or dsRNA-gfp and infected with an m.o.i. of 5 or higher could not be maintained in culture more than a week. After 7 days in culture only cellular debris was observed in the culture, indicative of cell lysis as a result of the baculovirus infection. To determine if the reduction in protein content in cells transfected with dsRNAs was the result of depletion of the specific mRNA, we performed RT-PCR experiments using primers specific for gp64, ie1, gfp, and β-actin from sf21 cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 4B illustrates a representative experiment obtained at an m.o.i. of 1. Uninfected cells (NI) showed the presence of β-actin mRNA, and this was confirmed by sequence analysis of the fragment amplified by the RT-PCR experiment. As expected, in uninfected cells gfp, gp64, and ie1 were not detected. Interestingly, infection with recombinant baculovirus resulted in reduction of mRNA for β-actin. This result can be explained by the fact that, at the late phase of baculovirus infection, the majority of mRNAs are produced by the baculovirus α-amanitin-resistant RNA polymerase (15Huh N.E. Weaver R.F. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The β-actin mRNA is observed again in cells that were interfered with dsRNA from gp64 and ie1. In these experiments we observed again the specificity of the RNAi effect; notice that interfering with gp64 (dsRNA-gp64 panel) significantly reduced the mRNA from gp64 but did not affect the ie1 mRNA. As expected, interfering with ie1 (dsRNA-ie1) significantly reduced the amount of gfp, gp64, and ie1 mRNAs, and β-actin levels were restored to normal due to the inhibition of viral infection. These results demonstrate that the reduction in protein content originates from the depletion of the respective mRNA. Depleting the ie1 mRNA turned out to be a very efficient way to interfere with baculovirus infection. In fact, cells transfected with dsRNA-ie1 and later infected with AcNPV-GFP showed morphological characteristics of uninfected cells, as illustrated in Fig. 5. Panel A shows the typical morphology of Sf21 insect cell infected with recombinant AcNPV-GFP. Notice the large amount of viral particles inside the cell nucleus. In contrast, no viral particles could be detected in dsRNA-ie1-tretaed cells as illustrated in Fig. 5B. Purification of virions from supernatants of infected cells (see “Experimental Procedures”) allowed the observation of multiple viral particles (Fig. 5C). In contrast, viral particles were extremely difficult to find in supernatants obtained from dsRNA-ie1-treated cells (Fig. 5D). These viral particles did not show any reproducible characteristic that could separate them from particles isolated from dsRNA-ie1-untreated cells. These viral particles may come from the initial viral infection or could be produced by cells that were not efficiently transfected with dsRNA-ie1. These results are consistent with the low pfu obtained with the supernatant of dsRNA-ie1-treated cells (Fig. 2C). The very low titer found in the supernatant of dsRNA-ie1- and dsRNA-gp64-treated cells confirms the poor viral content observed with the electron microscope (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, it has been previously shown that GP64 glycoprotein is required for virus budding from the cell (16Oomens A.G. Blissard G.W. Virology. 1999; 254: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In fact, this glycoprotein is acquired by virions during budding through the plasma membrane of the infected insect cell, representing the final step in virus assembly (14Oomens A.G. Monsma S.A. Blissard G.W. Virology. 1995; 209: 592-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Injecting Insects with dsRNA from gp64 or ie1 Prevents Baculovirus Infection in Vivo—To test if dsRNA from gp64 or ie1 could protect against AcNPV-GFP infection in vivo, we used the larvae from the insect T. mollitor as a bioassay. Injection in the hemolymph with 2 μl of AcNPV-GFP resulted in death of over 97% of the larvae within the following 7 days (68 dead of 70 injected). Dead insects showed high GFP fluorescence assessed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 6, inset box in the upper left corner of each panel) and high β-galactosidase activity, as illustrated in Fig. 6 (AcNPV-GFP, upper panel to the left). Uninjected larvae or larvae injected with distilled water did not show GFP fluorescence or β-galactosidase activity (H2O, upper panel to the right), and over 95% of the insects survived the injection (4 dead of 60 injected). Larvae injected with 0.1 μg of nude dsRNA-ie1 24 h prior to the injection with AcNPV-GFP survived the baculovirus infection (6 dead of 80 injected). These insects did not show GFP fluorescence or β-galactosidase activity. Similar results were obtained with larvae pretreated with 0.1 μg of nude dsRNA-gp64, where 10 insects died of the 61 injected with AcNPV-GFP (data not shown). In contrast, injection with 0.1 μg of nude dsRNA-PhP did not protect against the subsequent injection with AcNPV-GFP. As expected, over 97% of the larvae died within the subsequent 7 days (34 dead of 40 injected, data not shown). Similarly, insects pretreated with dsRNA-gfp and later challenged with AcNPV-GFP died within the next 7 days (58 dead of 62 injected). Interestingly, these insects did not show GFP fluorescence (inset in the lower panel to the left) but did show high levels of β-galactosidase activity (lower panel to the left). RNAi is a recently discovered phenomenon, which is rapidly becoming a powerful tool for selectively depleting mRNA, thus resulting in reduction of the specific protein. This phenomenon has been found in worms, flies, several insects, plants, and mammals (1Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The RNAi molecular mechanism involves several protein complexes, including the RNA-induced silencing complex responsible for the degradation of the homologue mRNA and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that synthesize new dsRNAs and amplify the RNAi signal (1Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Proteins essential for the RNAi phenomenon such as Dicer and Argonaute are highly conserved in fungi, plants, and animals. Although the exact physiological role of RNAi in animals is not known to the present day, recent evidence suggests that RNAi may be involved in organism development, germ line fate, and host defenses against transposable elements and viruses (17Dernburg A.F. Karpen G.H. Cell. 2002; 111: 159-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although it is not clear that RNAi may function as a defense mechanism in mammals, recent experimental evidence shows that modulation of HIV-1 replication in human cell lines by dsRNA is possible (5Jacque J.M. Triques K. Stevenson M. Nature. 2002; 418: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). In a different study, dsRNA conferred viral immunity in human cells against poliovirus (6Gitlin L. Karelsky S. Andino R. Nature. 2002; 418: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Whether this is a physiological function for RNAi or not, this recent discoveries open the possibility of using dsRNA to treat or prevent viral infections. One important point that needs to be explored is whether the introduction of dsRNAs in mammals provides effective defense against systemic infections. The adequate distribution of the dsRNAs in the organism and the possible secondary effects of introducing dsRNAs in humans are two of several issues that would have to be solved before this technique is employed efficiently to prevent or treat viral infections. Interestingly, it has been recently shown that intravenous introduction of small interfering dsRNA in adult mice silences luciferase activity and endogenous Fas expression in vivo (18McCaffrey A.P. Meuse L. Pham T.T. Conklin D.S. Hannon G.J. Kay M.A. Nature. 2002; 418: 38-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar), which demonstrates that systemic application of dsRNA is feasible and effective for gene silencing in organisms. In the present study we have used the rapidly replicating and highly cytolytic DNA virus A. californica in combination with the insect cell line Sf21 from S. frugiperda to assess the protective role of dsRNA from genes essential for baculovirus propagation. We show here for the first time that dsRNAs from segments of two genes essential for baculovirus propagation prevent virus infection in vitro and in vivo. We have demonstrated that this effect is specific for the dsRNA sequence used, because we can eliminate GFP fluorescence (one of the reporter genes present in the recombinant baculovirus) without affecting the time course of viral infection or the activity of β-galactosidase (the second reporter gene). Transfecting the insect cells with dsRNA from gp64 prevents viral infection when using low m.o.i. values. On the other hand, dsRNA from the ie1 gene prevented viral infection even when high m.o.i. values were utilized. Using the larva from the insect T. mollitor, we have shown that injecting dsRNAs from gp64 or ie1 confers resistance to recombinant baculoviruses. This protective effect was not obtained with dsRNA from gfp or the polyhedrin promoter, which were two dsRNA sequences used as controls. Even though injecting dsRNA from gfp prevented GFP fluorescence in insects, it did not stop viral infection by recombinant baculovirus. As far as we know, this is the first report showing the protective effects of RNAi in vivo against a viral infection in animals. The protective effects of dsRNA against viral infections have been previously observed in plants (3Waterhouse P.M. Wang M.B. Lough T. Nature. 2001; 411: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). An interesting result from our studies is the high efficacy to silence genes obtained with long dsRNAs. It has been previously recognized that in nematodes and Drosophila, long dsRNA sequences are as effective as short dsRNA sequences contrary to mammals, where dsRNAs only 21 nucleotides long are functional. The highly efficient RNAi observed in the present study was obtained with a single transfection. This was possible after optimizing the type of lipids used for transfection and the amount of dsRNA used in the mixture (see “Experimental Procedures”). Previous studies using null mutants of gp64 gene have shown that the mutant baculovirus cannot be replicated, providing evidence of the important role-played by GP64 protein in cell-to-cell infection (8Monsma S.A. Oomens A.G. Blissard G.W. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4607-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results are in agreement with these original reports, because interfering with GP64 protein synthesis results in baculoviruses that cannot infect insect cells. Only when high m.o.i. values are used, where virus infection does not depend on generation of new progeny, did we observe normal GFP production and β-galactosidase activity from infected cells. However, even when these cells produced GFP and β-galactosidase, no GP64 protein was detected by confocal microscopy or Western blotting analysis. These results suggest that the new viral particles produced by the cells interfered with dsRNA-gp64 would lack GP64 protein. In agreement with this prediction, viruses collected from the supernatant of dsRNA-gp64-treated cells and infected with low m.o.i. values showed significantly reduced pfu as compared with control. The possibility of producing viral particles missing specific proteins provides a powerful tool for reverse genetics with viruses. Using this technique one could rapidly explore the role of single or multiple genes in virus morphogenesis, assembly, and transport. A rapid method for screening the role of specific proteins in virulence may be possible also. Several groups have shown genome-wide RNAi to deplete proteins from entire chromosomes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (19Maeda I. Kohara Y. Yamamoto M. Sugimoto A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 171-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Such genome-wide RNAi could easily be implemented for entire virus genomes, especially with large complex genomes such as the A. californica 134-kb genome. Finally, in the genomic era where scientists are gathering large amounts of information about the sequence of many genomes (20Ueda R. J. Neurogenet. 2001; 15: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we are learning that the next big challenge will be finding rapid and efficient tools to determine the role played by thousands of genes with unknown function. RNAi might be one of such tool (21Kuwabara P.E. Coulson A. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 347-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The excellent services from the Molecular Biology and Microscopy units and the library at the Instituto de Fisiologia Celular are greatly appreciated. We thank Agustin Luz for kindly providing the full-length cDNA from ie1."
https://openalex.org/W2067719552,"T20, a synthetic peptide corresponding to a C-terminal segment of the envelope glycoprotein (gp41) of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses, is a potent inhibitor of viral infection. We report here that C-terminal octylation of simian immunodeficiency virus gp41-derived T20 induces a significant increase in its inhibitory potency. Furthermore, when C-terminally octylated, an otherwise inactive mutant in which the C-terminal residues GNWF were replaced by ANAA has potency similar to that of the wild type T20. This effect cannot be explained by a trivial inhibitory effect of the octyl group added to the peptides, because the N-terminally octylated peptides have the same activity as the non-octylated parent peptides. The effects caused by octylation on the oligomerization, secondary structure, and membrane-interaction properties of the peptides were investigated. Our results shed light on the mechanism of inhibition by T20 and provide experimental support for the existence of a pre-hairpin intermediate.

Gp120/gp41 are the viral envelope glycoproteins responsible for this process. Gp120, which is non-covalently attached to the integral membrane subunit gp41, mediates the binding to the target cell receptor CD4 (1Dalgleish A.G. Beverley P.C. Clapham P.R. Crawford D.H. Greaves M.F. Weiss R.A. Nature. 1984; 312: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (2556) Google Scholar) and other co-receptors (2Alkhatib G. Combadiere C. Broder C.C. Feng Y. Kennedy P.E. Murphy P.M.

These interactions induce a conformational change in gp41, the first step in a process that will lead to membrane merging (4Veronese F.D. DeVico A.L. Copeland T.D. Oroszlan S. Gallo R.C.

The N terminus of gp41 contains a stretch of approximately 15 hydrophobic residues named the fusion peptide (6Gallaher W.R. Cell. 1987; 50: 327-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) that are believed to insert into and destabilize the membrane, thus facilitating fusion (7Harter C. James P. Bachi T. Semenza G. Brunner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6459-6464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gp41 ectodomain contains an N-terminal heptad repeat region consecutive to the fusion peptide and a C-terminal heptad repeat region that precedes the transmembrane domain (8Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of a protease-resistant core of HIV-1 gp41 (9Chan D.C. Fass D.

Nature. 1997; 387: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar) as well as a segment of SIV gp41 ectodomain that lacks the fusion peptide (11Caffrey M. Cai M. Kaufman J. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Covell D.G. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4572-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) show that three N-terminal heptad repeats fold into a trimeric coiled coil, against which three antiparallel helices formed by C-terminal heptad repeats are packed. This structure is thought to form at a late stage during the membrane fusion process (12Furuta R.A. Wild C.T. Weng Y. Weiss C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides that partially overlap the C-terminal heptad repeat segment and a consecutive Trp-rich region have been shown to be potent inhibitors of gp41-mediated membrane fusion. These peptides can be grouped in two distinctive classes: (i) C34 and its different analogs contain in their N termini the sequence WMEW, which is believed to fit into a deep cavity located at the opposite end of the N-terminal coiled coil (13Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar, 14Chan D.C. Chutkowski C.T. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11567-15613Google Scholar), and (ii) T20 (formerly DP178) and its analogs, which are shifted toward the C terminus and therefore do not include these cavity-filling residues (15Wild C.T. Shugars D.C. Greenwell T.K. McDanal C.B. Matthews T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9770-9774Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). The analogy between the structural organizations of gp41 and hemagglutinin, the fusion protein of influenza virus (16Carr C.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 823-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar), and the inhibitory activity of gp41 C-peptides lead to postulate a “pre-hairpin intermediate” in gp41-induced membrane fusion in which the N-terminal coiled coil is formed but the C-terminal helices are not packed (10Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar, 13Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). At this stage, the C-peptide inhibitors can bind to the exposed coiled coil, thus preventing the subsequent refolding and blocking fusion (12Furuta R.A. Wild C.T. Weng Y. Weiss C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In addition, extensive biophysical studies done with constructs corresponding to part of SIV gp41 ectodomain suggested that gp41 monomers, which might be present in equilibrium with the trimers, could be also a possible target for C-peptides binding and subsequent inhibition (40Caffrey M. Kaufman J. Stahl S. Wingfield P. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1904-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The inhibitory potency of HIV gp41-derived C34 and its analogs has been clearly correlated with their ability to interact with the cavity present in the coiled coil (14Chan D.C. Chutkowski C.T. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11567-15613Google Scholar). Furthermore, increasing their helical content resulted also in more potent peptide inhibitors (17Jin B.S. Ryu J.R. Ahn K. Yu Y.G. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2000; 16: 1797-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Otaka A. Nakamura M. Nameki D. Kodama E. Uchiyama S. Nakamura S. Nakano H. Tamamura H.

S. A. 2002; 99: 14664-14669Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). HIV gp41-derived T20 is a promising anti-HIV candidate in clinical trials (20Kilby J.M. Hopkins S. Venetta T.M. DiMassimo B. Cloud G.A. Lee J.Y. Alldredge L. Hunter E. Lambert D. Bolognesi D. Matthews T. Johnson M.R. Nowak M.A. Shaw G.M. Saag M.S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1302-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). However, the understanding of its detailed mechanism of inhibition has been hampered by the following. (i) T20 lacks the residues that bind to the coiled coil C-terminal cavity; (ii) the known crystal and solution structures of fragments of HIV or SIV gp41 ectodomains do not fully include the regions corresponding either to T20 or to its putative binding site at the N terminus of the coiled coil; and (iii) in addition to a primary target site within the N-terminal heptad repeat (21Lawless M.K. Barney S. Guthrie K.I. Bucy T.B. Petteway S.R. Merutka G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13697-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), T20 has been postulated to bind to a second site in gp41, presumably a non-specified region at the C terminus of the ectodomain close to the viral membrane (22Ryu J.R. Jin B.S. Suh M.J. Yoo Y.S. Yoon S.H. Woo E.R. Yu Y.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 23Kliger Y. Gallo S.A. Peisajovich S.G. Munoz-Barroso I. Avkin S. Blumenthal R. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1391-1397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Indeed, that T20 acts in close proximity to the membrane is supported by the studies of von Laer and co-workers (24Hildinger M. Dittmar M.T. Schult-Dietrich P. Fehse B. Schnierle B.S. Thaler S. Stiegler G. Welker R. von Laer D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3038-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). They have shown that when T20 is anchored to the target cell membrane by fusion to a transmembrane domain, the wild type and the ANAA mutant T20 have similar inhibitory activities. These observations suggest that either the original residues are important for binding of T20 to its target site in gp41 or that their replacement affects T20 in an indirect way, perhaps by altering its structure or membrane partitioning. In either case, membrane partitioning by fusion to a transmembrane domain might have resulted in higher local concentrations, and perhaps the membrane proximity might have restored the secondary structure required for inhibition. To further study the role of membrane proximity in T20 inhibitory potency and to possibly discriminate between the different hypothesis, we synthesized and analyzed eight variants of SIV gp41-derived T20 (Fig. 1) in which different acyl groups were added either to the N or to the C terminus and compared the inhibitory activities, membrane partitioning, and secondary structural content of the different peptides. The rationale behind the design was that if T20-membrane interaction was dependent on the aromatic C-terminal residues, C-terminal acylation could compensate the detrimental effects of the ANAA mutation. Furthermore, if a particular interaction between the C terminus of T20 and the membrane was necessary for inhibition, then C-terminal acylation of the wild type peptide could result in a better inhibitor. Furthermore, it is known that a minimum length of the acyl chain is necessary to significantly influence the way in which the peptide interacts with the membrane bilayer (36Avrahami D. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2254-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). On the other hand, long acyl chains are prone to form micelles, leading to peptide aggregation. Thus, although they are likely to affect peptide-membrane interaction (our purpose), they might alter also the “real” concentration of the peptides in the cell-cell fusion inhibition experiments, seriously compromising their interpretation. Thus, we chose to modify the N or C terminus of T20 and its ANAA mutant with an octyl group. In addition, we further explored the minimum length necessary to affect peptide-membrane interaction by specifically modifying the C terminus of the mutant T20 also with propyl and hexyl groups. The results are discussed in relation to the mechanism of T20 inhibition and gp41-mediated membrane fusion. Materials—Butyloxycarbonyl amino acids, butyloxycarbonyl-methylbenzhydrylamine resin, and PyBOP (benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate) were purchased from Nova-Biochem AG (Laufelfingen, Switzerland). S-Trityl-β-mercaptopropionic acid was purchased from Peptides International (Louisville, KY). Reagents for peptide synthesis were obtained from Sigma. SPM and PE were purchased from Sigma. PC and cholesterol were purchased from Lipid Products (South Nutfield, United Kingdom). CMTMR and calcein were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). N-Octyl β-d-glucopyranoside was purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Buffers were prepared using double glass-distilled water. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) is composed of NaCl (8 g/liter), KCl (0.2 g/liter), KH2PO4 (0.2 g/liter), and Na2HPO4 (1.09 g/liter), pH 7.3. Peptide Synthesis and Modifications—The peptides were synthesized by a standard solid phase method on butyloxycarbonyl-methylbenzhydrylamine resin as described previously (25Merrifield R.B. Vizioli L.D. Boman H.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5020-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 26Shai Y. Bach D. Yanovsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20202-20209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications outlined by Hackeng et al. (41Hackeng T.M. Griffin J.M. Dawson P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10068-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) required for inclusion of the linker moiety (S-trityl-β-mercaptopropionic acid). The fully protected resin-bound WT T20 and mut-T20 peptides were N-acetylated with 1 equivalent of acetic anhydride (in two equivalents of N,N-diisopropylethylamine) for 15 min and then cleaved from the resin by HF treatment and purified by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography. C-terminal amidation of WT T20 and mut-T20 was achieved by incubating the pure peptides with a molar excess of NH3 in acetonitrile/water (1:1). Reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography was used to follow the reaction and to purify the product to >98% homogeneity. Replacement of the linker and leucine groups at the C termini of the peptides as well as the removal of the formyl-protecting groups from tryptophans were evidenced by the disappearance of the shoulder at ∼240 nm (characteristic of the thiol esther bond) and by the shift of the peak at ∼300 nm (characteristic of the formyl-Trp) to 280 nm (as expected for Trp). The WT octyl-T20 and mut-octyl-T20 peptides were obtained by N-terminal coupling of octanoic acid to the fully protected resin-bound peptides by incubation with 7 equivalents of octanoic acid, 1 equivalent of PyBOP, and 1.1 equivalent of N,N-diisopropylethylamine for 2 h. Cleavage, purification, replacement of the C-terminal linker and Leu groups by amides, and Trp deprotection were done as described above. The WT T20-octyl, mut-T20-propyl, mut-T20-hexyl, and mut-T20-octyl were obtained by N-acetylation, cleavage, and purification as described above followed by the replacement of the C-terminal linker and Leu groups with a propyl, hexyl, or octyl group (as required) by incubation with a molar excess of propyl, hexyl, or octyl amine (as required) in acetonitrile/water (1:1). Reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography was used to follow the reaction and to purify the product to >98% homogeneity as described before. Note that incubation under these basic conditions successfully removed the formyl groups from protected Trp. The peptide compositions were determined by mass spectrometry. Preparation of Lipid Vesicles—Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared from PC, SPM, PE, and Cho (4.5:4.5:1:1) as follows. Dry mixed lipid films were suspended in PBS buffer by vortexing to produce large multilamellar vesicles. Small unilamellar vesicles were then obtained by sonication of the lipid suspension for ∼1 h until it cleared. Dye Transfer Fusion Assay—Peptide inhibition of cell-cell fusion was assayed by monitoring the redistribution of water-soluble fluorescent probes between target and effector cells upon their co-incubation with each other (27Munoz-Barroso I. Durell S. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Blumenthal R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The expression of SIVmac251 gp41/gp120 on the effector cells was achieved by overnight infection of HeLa cells with a Vaccinia recombinant virus V194 at 31 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. Effector cells were labeled with the fluorescent dye CMTMR (20 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by two washes with PBS and one with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. The target cells, +CD4 +CXCR5 3T3 fibroblasts, were labeled with the fluorescent dye calcein AM (1 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by two washes with PBS and one with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 3 μg/ml puromycin and combined with the effector cells at room temperature. Different concentrations of the peptides dissolved in PBS were then added (or equivalent amounts of PBS were added to the controls). The cells were then co-cultured at 31 °C for 30 min in 24-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA). Phase and fluorescence images were collected using a Nikon 200TE inverted microscope coupled to a CCD camera (SPOT Camera, Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.) with a ×20 objective lens (Plan-Fluor 20x, ELWD, NA = 0.45). Single beam-splitter cubes were used for the excitation of calcein (494/517, Nikon B-2E/C) and CMTMR (541/565, Nikon G-2E/C). Three images per well were collected and then analyzed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA) for dye transfer from the donor to the acceptor cell. The scoring of fusion events was based on the cells positive for both dyes in ratio with the total potential fusion events (target cells with bound or fused effector cells) as described previously (27Munoz-Barroso I. Durell S. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Blumenthal R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). An average of fusion efficiency from 3 to 4 images is plotted against peptide concentration ([peptide]) with error bars for each point representing the mean ± S.D. The data were fit to a hyperbolic decay function: Fusion = (Fusionmax) × (IC50)/((IC50) + [peptide]), which yielded a correlation coefficient (0.94–0.99) and an estimation of the concentration at which 50% of inhibition (IC50) is reached for each peptide. An estimation of error for IC50 was also derived from this fit. Mut-T20, mut-octyl-T20, mut-T20-propyl, and mut-T20-hexyl yielded poor fitting coefficients, and therefore, no estimation of their IC50s was made. Membrane Partition of the Peptides—Surface Plasmon Resonance (SRP) experiments to determine membrane partition were carried out with a BIAcore 3000 analytical system (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden) using an L1 sensor chip (Biacore). The L1 chip has a long chain alkanethiol that contains polar head groups, so when in contact with liposomes, a lipid bilayer is formed. The running buffer used for all of the experiments was PBS, pH 7.3. The washing solution was 40 mmN-Octyl β-d-glucopyranoside. The regenerating solution was 10 mm NaOH. All of the solutions were freshly prepared, degassed, and filtered through 0.22-μm pores. The operating temperature was 25 °C. After cleaning as indicated by the manufacturers, the BIAcore instrument was left running overnight using Milli-Q water as eluent to thoroughly wash all of the liquid handling parts of the instrument. The L1 chip was then installed, and the alkanethiol surface was cleaned by an injection of the non ionic detergent (40 mmN-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (25 μl)) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. PC/SPM/PE/Cho (4.5:4.5:1:1) small unilamellar vesicles (80 μl, 0.5 mm) were then applied to the chip surface at a low flow rate (2 μl/min). To remove any multilamellar structures from the lipid surface, NaOH (50 μl, 10 mm) was injected at a flow rate of 50 μl/min, which resulted in a stable base line corresponding to the lipid bilayer linked to the chip surface. The bilayer linked to the chip surface was then used as a model membrane surface to study peptide-membrane binding. Peptide solutions (35 μl of PBS solution of 0.4–40 μm peptide) were injected on the lipid surface at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. PBS alone then replaced the peptide solution for 15 min to allow peptide dissociation. Surface plasmon resonance detects changes in the reflective index of the surface layer of lipids in contact with the sensor chip. A sensogram is obtained by plotting the surface plasmon resonance angle against time. An analysis of the peptide-lipid binding event was performed from a series of sensograms collected at several different peptide concentrations. Our system reached binding equilibrium during sample injection, and therefore, the affinity constant could be calculated from the relationship between the equilibrium binding response and the peptide concentration using a steady state affinity model. The affinity constants were derived from the following equation (by nonlinear least squares fitting) as shown in Equation 1, R.U.i=(KA×[peptide]i×R.U.MAX)/(KA×[peptide]i+1)(Eq. 1) where R.U. (resonance unit) i is the signal measured, [peptide]i is the concentration of a generic peptide “i”, R.U.MAX is the maximal response unit (or equilibrium binding response), and KA is the affinity constant. Determination of the Secondary Structure of the Peptides by CD—The CD spectra of the different peptides (10 μm) in PBS were determined in an Aviv 202 spectropolarimeter in a capped quartz optical cell with a 1-mm path length at 25 °C in the range of 193–260 nm (1 nm steps, 10 s averaging). The spectrum of PBS was subtracted from the spectra of the peptides. Determination of Changes in the Oligomeric State of the Peptides by Trp Fluorescence—The fluorescence of Trp is sensitive to the polarity of its environment. Changes in the oligomerization state of short peptides alter the Trp surroundings with a concomitant change in their fluorescence signals. The spectra of the peptides at increasing concentrations (∼0.5–10 μm) were determined in PBS at 25 °C with excitation at 280 nm (4 nm slits) and emission in the range of 300–400 nm (1-nm steps, 4-nm slits). To ensure equilibrium between possible different oligomeric states, the peptides were preincubated at the desired concentrations for 24 h at 4 °C. The spectrum of PBS was subtracted from the spectra of the peptides. C-terminal Octylation of SIV Gp41-derived T20 Enhances Its Inhibitory Activity—First, we determined the ability of the different peptides to inhibit gp41-mediated cell-cell fusion. Specifically, we used effector HeLa cells expressing SIVmac251 gp41/gp120 (by infection with the Vaccinia recombinant virus V194) labeled with the fluorescent dye CMTMR and target cells, +CD4 +CXCR5 3T3 fibroblasts, labeled with the fluorescent dye calcein AM. The two cell types were co-incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of the different peptides (or equivalent amounts of PBS in the controls) for 30 min, and then the percentage of gp41-mediated cell-cell fusion was calculated. As shown in Fig. 2, the non-acylated wild type peptide (Wt-T20, filled squares) efficiently prevents cell-cell fusion in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 400 ± 25 nm. On the contrary, the replacement of the four C-terminal residues GNWF in the SIV strain studied here by ANAA resulted in an inactive peptide (Mut-T20, empty squares). Strikingly, the addition of an octyl group to the C termini of the wild type and the mutant peptides caused significant improvements of their inhibitory potencies with IC50 of 123 ± 30 nm and 534 ± 129 nm, respectively (Wt-T20-octyl, filled diamonds; Mut-T20-octyl, empty diamonds). Interestingly, the addition of the octyl group to the N termini of the wild type and mutant peptides (Wt-octyl-T20, filled triangles; Mut-octyl-T20, empty triangles) did not alter their inhibitory potencies. The IC50 of WT octyl-T20 was 360 ± 57 nm, whereas the mut-octyl-T20 showed no inhibition, indicating that the increase observed for WT T20-octyl and mut-T20-octyl is not caused by an intrinsic inhibitory ability of the octyl groups. Furthermore, mut-T20-propyl (crosses) and mut-T20-hexyl (empty circles) are also inactive, indicating that a minimum acyl chain length is necessary to bring about inhibitory activity to the mutant peptide. Interestingly, excluding the inactive peptides, Student's t test analysis showed that only WT T20-octyl had a statistically significant difference in IC50 value as compared with that of wild type (data not shown). The Increased Inhibitory Potency of the C-terminally Octylated Peptides Is Not the Result of Higher Peptide Concentrations in the Proximity of the Membrane—To determine whether the observed increase in the inhibitory activity of the C-terminally octylated peptides was simply the result of higher local concentrations caused by enhanced membrane binding, we calculated the membrane affinity constants of the different peptides by surface plasmon resonance using a model PC:SPM:PE: Cho (4.5:4.5:1:1) bilayer on a L1 sensor chip. An analysis of the peptide-lipid binding event was performed from a series of sensograms collected at several different peptide concentrations. The sensograms reached equilibrium during sample injection; therefore, the affinity constant was calculated from the relationship between the equilibrium binding response and the peptide concentration (see Fig. 3) using a steady state affinity model. The derived affinity constants (KA) and the r2 of the fittings are listed in Table I. A comparison of the KA demonstrates that the non-acylated wild type and mutant peptides as well as the C-terminally octylated wild type and mutant peptides have similar membrane affinities. This suggests that the differences observed in their inhibitory potencies are not attributed to significantly different local concentrations. On the other hand, N-terminal octylation seems to have more complex effects on membrane partition.Table IMembrane binding affinity constants calculated by surface plasmon resonancePeptideKAr2m-1WT T20(1.7 ± 0.2) × 1040.99959Octyl-WT T20(1.2 ± 0.3) × 1050.98550WT T20-octyl(3.2 ± 0.7) × 1040.99592Mut T20(1.9 ± 0.3) × 1040.95773Octyl-mut T20(0.5 ± 0.1) × 1040.99934Mut T20-octyl(1.9 ± 0.6) × 1040.98592 Open table in a new tab Octylation Influences the Secondary Structure of T20—Secondary structure has been shown to affect the inhibitory potency of both C34 and T20 analogs (17Jin B.S.

https://openalex.org/W1984565472,"Thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) has recently been identified as a positive acute phase protein in mice, an observation that may have important implications for the interaction of the coagulation, fibrinolytic, and inflammatory systems. Activated TAFI (TAFIa) inhibits fibrinolysis by removing the carboxyl-terminal lysines from partially degraded fibrin that are important for maximally efficient plasminogen activation. In addition, TAFIa has been shown to be capable of removing the carboxyl-terminal arginine residues from the anaphylatoxins and bradykinin, thus implying a role for the TAFI pathway in the vascular responses to inflammation. In the current study, we investigated the ability of acute phase mediators to modulate human TAFI gene expression in cultured human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. Surprisingly, we found that treatment of HepG2 cells with a combination of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 suppressed endogenous TAFI mRNA abundance in HepG2 cells (∼60% decrease), while treatment with IL-1β or IL-6 alone had no effect. Treatment with IL-1β and/or IL-6 had no effect on TAFI promoter activity as measured using a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the human TAFI 5′-flanking region, whereas treatment with IL-1β and IL-6 in combination, but not alone, decreased the stability of the endogenous TAFI mRNA. Treatment with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone resulted in a 2-fold increase of both TAFI mRNA levels and promoter activity. We identified a functional glucocorticoid response element (GRE) in the human TAFI promoter between nucleotides −92 and −78. The GRE was capable of binding the glucocorticoid receptor, as assessed by gel mobility shift assays, and mutation of this element markedly decreased the ability of the TAFI promoter to be activated by dexamethasone.

By virtue of the intrinsic instability of this enzyme, whose activity disappeared within 2 h upon incubation at 37 °C, Hendriks et al. (1Hendriks D. Scharpé S. van Sande M. Lommaert M.P. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1989; 27: 277-285Google Scholar) designated the novel activity “unstable” carboxypeptidase or carboxypeptidase U (1Hendriks D. Scharpé S. van Sande M. Lommaert M.P. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1989; 27: 277-285Google Scholar). Campbell and Okada (2Campbell W. Okada H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 933-939Google Scholar) determined that the enzyme removed arginine residues from substrates more efficiently than lysines and therefore designated it carboxypeptidase R (2Campbell W. Okada H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 933-939Google Scholar). In 1991, Eaton et al.(3Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Google Scholar) isolated a cDNA encoding the zymogen form of the enzyme and found that it was highly homologous to pancreatic procarboxypeptidase B. Bajzar et al. (4Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Google Scholar) independently isolated a protein on the basis of its ability to inhibit fibrinolysis in the setting of sustained activation of the coagulation cascade; on the basis of this property, they named the protein TAFI. Amino acid sequence analysis of TAFI revealed it to be identical to plasma procarboxypeptidase B and procarboxypeptidases U and R. TAFI can be activated by thrombin (4Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Google Scholar), plasmin (5Mari S.-S. Cooper C.M. Wood T. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35046-35052Google Scholar), and thrombin in complex with thrombomodulin (6Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Google Scholar), with the last being by far the most efficient activator. Activated TAFI (TAFIa) inhibits fibrin clot lysis by removing the carboxyl-terminal lysine residues from partially degraded fibrin that mediate positive feedback in the fibrinolytic cascade (7Wang W. Boffa M.B. Bajzar L. Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 42: 27176-27181Google Scholar). As such, it has been hypothesized that TAFI plays a role in vivo in mediating the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis. Additional substrates for TAFIa have been identified that imply a role for the TAFI pathway beyond inhibition of fibrinolysis. TAFIa has been shown to remove the carboxyl-terminal arginines from the anaphylatoxin peptides C3a and C5a (8Campbell W. Okada N. Okada H. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 162-167Google Scholar) as well as from bradykinin (9Hendriks D. Wang W. van Sande M. Scharpé S. Agents Actions. 1992; 38: 407-413Google Scholar, 10Shinohara T. Sakurada C. Suzuki T. Takeuchi O. Campbell W. Ikeda S. Okada N. Okada H. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1994; 103: 400-404Google Scholar, 11Tan A.K. Eaton D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5811-5816Google Scholar). As such, TAFIa may modulate inflammatory processes in the vasculature in the setting of activation of the coagulation cascade. Additional evidence for a role for the TAFI pathway in inflammation comes from the recent observation that TAFI is an acute phase protein in mice; injection of the animals with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) elicited increases in both plasma TAFI concentrations and hepatic TAFI mRNA abundance (12Sato T. Miwa T. Akatsu H. Matsukawa N. Obata K. Okada N. Campbell W. Okada H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1053-1058Google Scholar). In order to begin to assess if human TAFI is also an acute phase protein and to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying this potential phenomenon, we have studied the ability of acute phase mediators to alter TAFI gene expression in a cultured human hepatoma cell model. Restriction and modification enzymes were from New England Biolabs, Invitrogen, Promega, and Stratagene. [γ-32P]ATP, [α-32P]dATP, and poly(dIdC)·(dIdC) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. TRIzol reagent, minimum essential medium (MEM), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (DMEM/F-12), and penicillin-streptomycin-Fungizone (PSF) were obtained from Invitrogen. Fetal calf serum was purchased from ICN. NucleoTrap mRNA purification kits were from Clontech. Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Cortec DNA Service Laboratories, Inc. (Kingston, Ontario, Canada). IL-1β, IL-6, dexamethasone, and actinomycin C1 were purchased from Sigma and were reconstituted as recommended by the manufacturer. Recombinant human glucocorticoid receptor expressed in insect cells and a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the human tyrosine aminotransferase glucocorticoid response element (TAT-GRE) was obtained from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. A cDNA clone corresponding to the full-length mRNA encoding the human γ-chain of fibrinogen was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. HepG2 cells (human hepatocellular carcinoma) (13Knowles B.B. Howe C.C. Aden D.P. Science. 1982; 209: 497-499Google Scholar) were grown in MEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% PSF. Cells were maintained in a humidified 37 °C incubator under a 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cytokine(s) and/or dexamethasone were added to the growth medium, and the cells were incubated for 24 h prior to harvesting the RNA from the cells. In some experiments, after a 24-h treatment with cytokine(s), actinomycin C1 was added to the cultures (to 5 μg/ml) and incubation continued (in the presence of cytokine(s), where appropriate) for different times up to 8 h prior to harvesting the RNA. RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent as recommended by the manufacturer. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared using the NucleoTrap mRNA purification kit. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA (20 μg/lane) or poly(A)+ RNA (∼2 μg/lane) (in 50% (v/v) formamide, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 2.2 mformaldehyde) was incubated at 65 °C for 15 min, quenched on ice, and then fractionated on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel containing 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 2.2 m formaldehyde. The RNA was blotted onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-XL, Amersham Biosciences) by capillary transfer in 20× SSC (1× SSC is 15 mm trisodium citrate, pH 7, 150 mm NaCl). After ultraviolet cross-linking of the RNA to the membrane, blots were hybridized with radiolabeled probes corresponding to the TAFI cDNA (full open reading frame) (3Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Google Scholar) or the γ-chain of human fibrinogen (14Bolyard M.G. Lord S.T. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 183-192Google Scholar). In order to correct for differences in RNA loading and transfer, blots were stripped and hybridized with radiolabeled probes corresponding to either the 36B4 cDNA (human acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein PO) (15Laborda J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3998Google Scholar) or, in the case of RNA from cells treated with actinomycin C1, the glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA; in the latter experiments, the amount of TAFI RNA present at each time point was calculated as described by Wilson and Deeley (16Wilson G.M. Deeley R.G. Plasmid. 1995; 33: 198-207Google Scholar), assuming a half-life for the glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA of 8 h (17Dani C. Piechaczyk M. Audigier Y. El Sabouty S. Cathala G. Marty L. Fort P. Blanchard J.-M. Jeanteur P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 145: 299-304Google Scholar). Probes were prepared using [α-32P]dATP and the Prime-It II random primer labeling kit (Stratagene). Hybridization was carried out at 68 °C for 1 h in ExpressHyb solution (Clontech). The blots were washed at room temperature in 1× SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and then at 50 °C in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS. Blots were exposed to a storage phosphor screen (Kodak), and band intensities were quantitated using a Molecular Imager FX phosphorimager (BioRad). The luciferase reporter plasmids TAFI[-2699]-luc, TAFI[-1128]-luc, TAFI[-236]-luc, and TAFI[-73]-luc have been described previously (18Boffa M.B. Reid T.S. Joo E. Nesheim M.E. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6547-6558Google Scholar). The plasmids contain fragments of the 5′-flanking region of the human TAFI gene inserted into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3 Basic (Promega). The numbering refers to the 5′-most nucleotide of genomic DNA included in the construct. The 3′-boundary of all the reporter plasmids is aHindIII restriction site immediately downstream of the initiator methionine codon such that all possible sites for transcription initiation are present in the construct; the initiator methionine codon was mutated to TTG in all cases. Additional luciferase reporter plasmids representing progressive 5′ deletions between −236 and −73 (TAFI[-120]-luc, TAFI[-100]-luc, TAFI[-90]-luc, and TAFI[-80]-luc) were constructed using PCR in which the 5′-most nucleotide of the upstream primer corresponds to the indicated nucleotide in the name of the reporter plasmid. A mutant variant of TAFI[-1128]-luc (designated TAFI[-1128/ΔGRE]-luc) was constructed using PCR according to the method of Nelson and Long (19Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Google Scholar). The sequence of the mutagenic oligonucleotide was as follows: 5′-CACAGGAACAAGAGGGACAGTGCCGTTATATTTTAACC-3′; the underlined nucleotides (positions −89 to −87 of the TAFI promoter) are mismatches relative to the wild-type sequence. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression plasmids were the generous gift of Dr. Robert Haché (University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada). pTL2-GR consists of a 2.9-kbBamHI restriction fragment encompassing the full-length open reading frame of the rat GR (20Miesfeld R. Rusconi S. Godowski P.J. Maler B.A. Okret S. Wikstroem A.-C. Gustafsson J.-A. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 389-399Google Scholar) inserted into pTL2 (a derivative of pSG5, Ref. 21Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Google Scholar, containing an expanded multiple cloning site) digested with BglII and BamHI. GAL0–540C encodes a fusion protein containing the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to a carboxyl-terminal fragment of the rat GR (amino acids 540–795; encompasses the ligand binding domain). rGR-L501P is a mutant variant of the full-length rat GR in which amino acid 501 has been changed from a leucine to a proline. rGR(N525)-pTL2 (encoding the amino-terminal 525 amino acids of the rat GR) was constructed as follows: pEGFP-GRwtN525 (pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) containing a rat GR fragment encompassing amino acids 22–525) was digested with MluI (downstream of the simian virus 40 (SV40) polyadenylation site), the ends were made blunt with T4 DNA polymerase, and the plasmid was then digested with BglII (within the rat GR coding sequence). The resultant fragment was inserted into rGR-pTL2 in which the corresponding sequences of the wild-type receptor cDNA were removed by digestion with BamHI (at which point the ends were made blunt) and BglII. Expression of all rat GR variants in mammalian cells was driven by the SV40 early promoter with the exception of rGR-L501P, whose expression was driven by the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) long terminal repeat. For luciferase reporter gene assays, HepG2 cells were grown in 6-well plates (Corning) and transfected by the method of calcium phosphate co-precipitation (22Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). Typically, cells received ∼1.3 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.6 μg of β-galactosidase internal control plasmid (RSV-βgal) (23Pöpperl H. Featherstone M.S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3673-3680Google Scholar) (to control for transfection and harvesting efficiency). In some experiments, cells also received 0.6 μg of GR expression plasmids. After a 6-h exposure to the precipitate, the cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and given fresh medium, and incubation was continued for an additional 42 h. In some experiments, hormones or cytokines were added to the culture medium at various times during the 42-h incubation period. The cells were harvested for preparation of cytoplasmic extracts for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays as previously described (18Boffa M.B. Reid T.S. Joo E. Nesheim M.E. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6547-6558Google Scholar). For each sample, the relative luciferase activity was calculated to be the luciferase activity per unit of β-galactosidase activity per unit volume of cell extract. Complementary sets of oligonucleotides encompassing the putative GRE in the TAFI promoter were synthesized: sense 5′-CAC AGG AAC AAG AGG GAA CAT GCC GTT ATA TTT TAA CC-3′; antisense 5′-GGT TAA AAT ATA ACG GCA TGT TCC CTC TTG TTC CTG TG-3′. Mutant oligonucleotides encompassing the same range, corresponding to the mutation in the GRE (see above), were also synthesized. For radiolabeled TAFI binding site probes for gel mobility shift assays, 5 pmol of sense strand oligonucleotide was end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Unincorporated label was removed using a NAP-5 column (AmershamBiosciences). The labeled oligonucleotide was combined with a 5-fold molar excess of cold antisense oligonucleotide, and the two annealed by placing in boiling water and allowing to cool slowly at room temperature. Unlabeled TAFI competitor binding site probes were made by annealing equimolar amounts of sense and antisense oligonucleotides. For the TAT-GRE (sense: 5′-CTA GGC TGT ACA GGA TGT TCT GCC TAG-3′; antisense: 5′-CTA GGC AGA ACA TCC TGT ACA GCC TAG-3′), 5 pmol of the double-stranded oligonucleotide was labeled as described above, and then unincorporated label was removed using a NAP-5 column. Unlabeled competitor binding site probes were diluted from the stock TAT-GRE provided by the manufacturer. Binding reactions were performed in binding buffer (20 mmHEPES pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol) and contained 1 μl of partially purified recombinant human GR expressed in insect cells as well as 2.0 μg of poly(dIdC)·(dIdC) and 10 fmol of radiolabeled probe (∼20,000 cpm). Binding reactions were incubated for 30 min on ice. Some binding reactions contained a 10-, 50-, 100-, or 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled binding site competitor (corresponding either to the wild-type TAFI sequence, the sequence containing the mutant GRE, or the TAT-GRE). Reactions were loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol that had been pre-electrophoresed at 300 V for 1 h at 4 °C. Electrophoresis was continued for a further 2.5 h at this temperature, at which time the gel was fixed, dried, and exposed to film (Kodak BIOMAX MR). It has been demonstrated that injection of mice with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) results in an increase in both plasma TAFI concentrations as well as hepatic TAFI mRNA abundance (12Sato T. Miwa T. Akatsu H. Matsukawa N. Obata K. Okada N. Campbell W. Okada H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1053-1058Google Scholar). To determine which mediators of the acute phase response regulate TAFI gene expression, we treated human hepatoma (HepG2) cells for 24 h with the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and/or -6, as well as dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid hormone analog). We measured the abundance of the endogenous TAFI mRNA by Northern blot analysis, using the acid ribosomal phosphoprotein PO (36B4) mRNA as an internal standard (Fig. 1). While we found that TAFI mRNA abundance was actually decreased by treatment of the cells with a combination of IL-1β and IL-6, IL-1β alone or IL-6 either alone or in combination with dexamethasone had little or no effect. Treatment with dexamethasone resulted in dose-dependent changes in TAFI mRNA abundance: an increase of up to 2-fold was observed that peaked at doses between 0.5 and 2 μm hormone. To verify that our cell culture model was a valid model for the analysis of the effect of acute phase mediators on TAFI gene expression, we measured the abundance of the mRNA for the γ-chain of fibrinogen (γ-Fgn) under similar conditions. As has been previously reported (24Otto J.M. Grenett H.E. Fuller G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1067-1072Google Scholar), both IL-6 and dexamethasone induce expression of γ-Fgn, with the greatest effect occurring when the two mediators are administered in combination. The magnitude of the induction by IL-6 plus dexamethasone was, however, less than has been reported for the mRNA levels of rat γ-Fgn in primary rat hepatocytes (15–20-fold) (24Otto J.M. Grenett H.E. Fuller G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1067-1072Google Scholar) or the activity of the rat γ-Fgn promoter in H35 rat hepatoma cells (10-fold) (25Zhang Z. Fuentes N.L. Fuller G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24287-24291Google Scholar). This finding may result from the fact that HepG2 cells are relatively deficient in glucocorticoid receptor (26Baumann H. Jahreis G.P. Morella K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22275-22281Google Scholar). In keeping with published reports (27Zhang Z. Fuller G.M. Blood. 2000; 96: 3466-3472Google Scholar), IL-1β had the effect of blunting the induction of γ-Fgn mRNA stimulated by IL-6 and IL-6 plus dexamethasone. To examine whether the acute phase mediators were capable of specifically altering the activity of the TAFI promoter, HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the 5′-flanking region of the human TAFI gene. The transfected cells were treated for 24 h with the acute phase mediators described above, and luciferase activity was quantitated in extracts isolated from the cells as a measure of TAFI promoter activity (Fig. 2). Dexamethasone (1.0 μm) stimulated TAFI promoter activity more than 2-fold, either alone or in combination with IL-6. None of the other treatments had an appreciable effect on TAFI promoter activity. Since the ability of IL-1β and IL-6 in combination to decrease TAFI mRNA abundance did not seem to result from a decrease in TAFI promoter activity, we investigated whether these cytokines could influence the stability of the TAFI mRNA transcript. HepG2 cells were treated for 24 h with IL-1β and/or IL-6 at which time transcription was arrested by the addition of actinomycin C1. RNA was harvested at different times after the addition of actinomycin C1 and the remaining TAFI mRNA quantified by Northern blot analysis (Fig.3). The results show that the TAFI mRNA has an intrinsic half-life of about 3 h, identifying the TAFI transcript as a relatively short-lived mRNA species (28Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Google Scholar); addition of IL-1β and IL-6 in combination results in a destabilization of the TAFI mRNA whereas either cytokine administered alone had no effect. From regression of the Northern blot data, the effect of the combined cytokines results in a 22% decrease in the half-life of the TAFI transcript. In order to identify sequences in the TAFI promoter that mediate the increase in promoter activity elicited by dexamethasone, we utilized a series of luciferase reporter plasmids containing progressive 5′ deletions of 5′-flanking sequence (Fig.4 A). The plasmids were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells, and the cells were incubated either in the absence or presence of 1.0 μm dexamethasone for 42 h prior to harvest and luciferase assay. Full responsiveness to dexamethasone was preserved upon deletion of 5′-flanking sequence up to nucleotide −100 (the numbering refers to the number of nucleotides upstream of one of the transcription start sites in the TAFI promoter) (Fig. 4 B). However, deletion of sequences between −100 and −90 resulted in almost complete elimination of the increase in promoter activity in response to dexamethasone. Deletion of sequences up to −80 does not result in a further decrease in dexamethasone responsiveness, while deletion of sequences up to −73 results in a complete loss of TAFI promoter activity, as we have previously reported (18Boffa M.B. Reid T.S. Joo E. Nesheim M.E. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6547-6558Google Scholar). Glucocorticoid hormones exert their effects on transcription through binding to and activating the GR, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily (29Wright A.P.H. Zilliacus J. McEwan I.J. Dahlman-Wright K. Almlöf T. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustaffson J.-A. J. Steriod Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 47: 11-19Google Scholar). Ligand-bound GR binds as a homodimer to specific sequences, known as GREs, in the promoters of target genes thereby stimulating their transcription. Inspection of the sequence downstream of −100 of the TAFI promoter revealed the presence of a sequence, between −92 and −78, that resembles a consensus GRE (30Beato M. Chalepakis G. Schauer M. Slater E.P. J. Steroid. Biochem. 1989; 32: 737-748Google Scholar) in that it is an imperfect inverted repeat with a 3-nucleotide spacing of the 6-nucleotide half-sites (Fig.5 A). Mutations were introduced into this candidate GRE that would be expected to abolish its ability to bind GR (Fig. 5 A). HepG2 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid encompassing the mutations and including the TAFI 5′-flanking sequence up to −1128 (TAFI[-1128/ΔGRE]-luc), or the corresponding wild-type reporter plasmid (TAFI[-1128]-luc), and the cells were treated with dexamethasone (Fig. 5 B). The mutations greatly decreased the response of the TAFI promoter; interestingly, the decrease in the extent of the response was similar to that observed upon deletion of sequences between −100 and −90. In order to examine the requirement for DNA binding of the GR for dexamethasone-dependent activation of the TAFI promoter, we performed co-transfection experiments with the wild-type or ΔGRE mutant TAFI promoter reporter plasmid and expression plasmids for rat GR (rGR) variants. The variants used (see Fig.6 A) included the full-length wild-type receptor (rGR-wt), a variant including only the amino-terminal 525 amino acids (i.e. lacking the DNA- and ligand-binding domains; rGR-N525), a variant including only the carboxyl-terminal 540 amino acids fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (i.e. lacking the amino-terminal transactivation domain and the DNA binding domain of the GR; rGR-540C), and a mutant of the full-length GR with a single point mutation that abolishes DNA binding (rGR-L501P). While ectopic expression of the intact, full-length rGR substantially increased the magnitude of dexamethasone induction of the wild-type TAFI promoter (Fig. 6 B), ectopic expression of the rGR variants lacking the ability to bind DNA had little or no influence on the magnitude of induction. Expression of the N525 variant resulted in a large, dexamethasone-independent induction of the TAFI promoter. This result was not unexpected given that removal of the ligand-binding domain results in a constitutively active GR. Interestingly, while ectopic expression of the intact, full-length rGR did not mediate any dexamethasone-dependent induction of the TAFI[-1128/ΔGRE]-luc reporter plasmid, the two rGR variants lacking DNA-binding ability were able to confer an ∼2-fold induction by this hormone. The constitutively active N525 rGR variant induced this mutant reporter plasmid in a hormone-independent fashion, albeit to a substantially reduced extent compared with the wild-type TAFI[-1128]-luc plasmid. To demonstrate explicitly that the GR can bind to the TAFI promoter GRE, gel mobility shift assays were performed using radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the wild-type TAFI GRE and recombinant human GR expressed in insect cells (Fig.7 A). As a positive control, gel mobility shift assays were also performed using the GRE from theTAT gene (Fig. 7 B). The autoradiograms show a complex of low mobility is formed using the probe containing the wild-type TAFI-GRE as well as the TAT-GRE. These complexes represent specific binding of the GR because they are competed effectively by an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides containing the TAT-GRE and the wild-type TAFI-GRE but not effectively by the mutant TAFI-GRE (TAFI-ΔGRE). No specific complexes were observed when radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing the mutant TAFI GRE were utilized (data not shown). The acute phase reaction is a complex host defense mechanism that, in response to triggers such as trauma, surgery, tissue infarction, or severe infection, aims to counteract the underlying challenge while restoring homeostasis (reviewed in Refs. 31Gabay C. Kushnar I. New Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 448-454Google Scholar and 32Jensen L.E. Whitehead A.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 489-503Google Scholar). Among the features of the acute phase response are systemic changes such as fever, increases in neutrophil production, changes in lipid and amino acid metabolism and activation of the coagulation and complement cascades as well as changes in the expression of a panel of liver-expressed plasma proteins. These acute-phase proteins are classified as either positive or negative acute phase proteins depending on whether their expression is induced or repressed, respectively, in the acute phase. Among the acute phase proteins are C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, α1-acid glycoprotein, components of the complement cascade, proteins of the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades, protease inhibitors, and proteins involved in transport and inflammatory functions. The magnitude of the changes in expression can be small (such as a 50% increase in the expression of ceruloplasmin) to vast (such as a greater than 1000-fold in"

Repair of some of these lesions has been well characterized but little is known about the repair of many DNA lesions. The oxidized adenine base, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoadenine (8-oxoA), is a relatively common DNA lesion, which is believed to be mutagenic in mammalian cells. This study investigates repair of 8-oxoA in nuclear and mitochondrial mammalian extracts. In nuclei, 8-oxoA:C and 8-oxoA:G base pairs are recognized and cleaved; in contrast, only 8-oxoA:C base pairs are cleaved in mitochondria. High stability of the DNA helix increased the efficiency of incision of 8-oxoA, and the efficiency decreased at DNA bends and condensed regions of the helix. Using liver extracts from mice knocked out for 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1), we demonstrated that OGG1 is the only glycosylase that incises 8-oxoA, when base-paired with cytosine in mitochondria and nuclei, but a different enzyme incises 8-oxoA when base-paired with guanine in the nucleus. Consistent with this result, a covalent DNA-protein complex was trapped using purified human OGG1 or human nuclear or mitochondrial extracts with a DNA substrate containing an 8-oxoA:C base pair.

Unrepaired oxidative DNA damage can be mutagenic and lead to impaired cellular functions. The implication of oxidative DNA damage in a broad range of pathophysiological processes including carcinogenesis, neurological disorders, and aging has been suggested (reviewed in Refs. 1Wiseman H. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar and 2Feig D.I. Reid T.M. Loeb L.A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1890s-1894sPubMed Google Scholar). A significant source of oxidative DNA damage is oxidative phosphorylation, an essential part of cellular energy metabolism, which takes place in mitochondria. Reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide are byproducts of oxidative phosphorylation, which can oxidize lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Several oxidative DNA lesions are mutagenic and contribute to genetic instability (reviewed in Refs. 1Wiseman H. Halliwell B. Biochem.

Many other DNA lesions including 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoadenine (8-oxoA) have not been studied in great detail. Previous studies show that 8-oxoA and 8-oxoG occur at similar frequencies in mammalian DNA (5Wang Y.J. Ho Y.S. Lo M.J. Lin J.K. Chem.-Biol. Interact. 1995; 94: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 6Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1389-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and that 8-oxoA is as mutagenic as 8-oxoG (7Kamiya H. Murata-Kamiya N. Koizume S. Inoue H. Nishimura S. Ohtsuka E. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). 8-OxoA leads to A → G transitions and A → C transversions (8Kamiya H. Miura H. Murata-Kamiya N. Ishikawa H. Sakaguchi T.

Increased levels of 8-oxoA have been detected in human tumor tissue (9Olinski R. Zastawny T. Budzbon J. Skokowski J. Zegarski W. Dizdaroglu M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may be involved in carcinogenesis. Finally, the level of 8-oxoA seems to increase with age. The level of 8-oxoA was 2-fold higher in liver from 12-month-old rats than in 1-month-old rats (5Wang Y.J. Ho Y.S. Lo M.J. Lin J.K. Chem.-Biol.

However, it was shown that purified human 8-oxoG glycosylase 1 (OGG1) cleaves 8-oxoA:C base pairs in vitro (12Girard P.M. D'Ham C. Cadet J. Boiteux S.

Oxidized and alkylated base lesions are predominantly repaired by the base excision repair pathway (reviewed in Ref. 4Dianov G.L. Souza-Pinto N. Nyaga S.G. Thybo T. Stevnsner T. Bohr V.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol Biol. 2001; 68: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Base excision repair is initiated by a DNA glycosylase, which recognizes and removes the modified nucleotide by cleavage of the glycosylic bond between the damaged base and deoxyribose. Many glycosylases incise the damaged base by flipping the modified nucleotide out of the helix and into the active site pocket for glycosylic bond cleavage and base release (14Bernards A.S.

The glycosylase leaves an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site in the DNA, which is processed by AP endonuclease or by the AP lyase activity of the glycosylase. OGG1, endonuclease III homologue 1 (NTH1), and the Nei-like proteins (NEIL1 and NEIL2) are all bifunctional glycosylases that possess AP lyase activity (17Rosenquist T.A. Zharkov D.O. Grollman A.P.

DNA strand cleavage by OGG1 is rate-limiting in base excision repair, and AP endonuclease 1 (APE1) is therefore believed to hydrolyze the AP site after OGG1 removes the damaged base (21Hill J.W.

The reaction was stopped by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 30 mm and the DNA was purified on a MicroSpin™ G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences). The DNA backbone was cleaved at the resulting AP site by the addition of 100 units of APE1 (Trevigen) for 1 h at 37 °C (buffer conditions as described by the manufacturer), and the reaction was stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 30 mm. The reaction buffer was exchanged on a Micro-Spin™ G-25 column. Incorporation reactions (10 μl) were performed with prepared oligonucleotide (100 pmol), 0.5 units of human polymerase β (Trevigen), 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1.0 mm DTT, 1% glycerol, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 pmol each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP where one deoxynucleotide was substituted with the corresponding [α-32P]dNTP for each reaction. The samples were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and the reactions were stopped by adding 2 μl of FA-loading dye (80% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mg/ml xylene cyanol FF, 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue). The samples were heated for 2 min at 95 °C and analyzed on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. The radioactively labeled DNA was visualized using a Personal Molecular Imager™ (Bio-Rad). Cells and Culture Conditions—The SV40-transformed wild type human fibroblasts, GM00637D (Coriell Institute for Medical Research) were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 1× amino acids, 1× vitamins, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Isolation of Mitochondria from Cells in Culture—Isolation of mitochondria was accomplished using a combination of differential centrifugation and Percoll gradient centrifugation employing a protocol modified from Croteau et al. (24Croteau D.L. ap Rhys C.M. Hudson E.K. Dianov G.L. Hansford R.G. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27338-27344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Briefly, actively growing cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and resuspended in M-SHE buffer (0.21 m mannitol, 0.07 m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.75 mm spermidine, 5 mm DTT, 2 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml protease inhibitor mixture set III (Calbiochem)). The cell suspension was homogenized using a Teflon to glass homogenizer and the mitochondrial fraction was separated from the nuclear pellet. The supernatant containing the mitochondria was subjected to differential and Percoll gradient centrifugation, and protein concentration was determined by the Lowry et al. (50Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) method. Preparation of Nuclear Extract from Cells in Culture—Nuclear extracts were prepared in parallel with the mitochondrial isolation, according to modified versions of two protocols (25Abou-Khalil S.

Free Radical Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, the nuclear pellet (obtained during preparation of mitochondria) was treated with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 400 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 2 μg/ml protease inhibitor mixture set III and subsequently subjected to centrifugation. The supernatant was dialyzed against 50 volumes of a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry et al. (50Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) method. Mice—Male C57/BL6J mice with or without a targeted mutation of the OGG1 gene (27Klungland A. Rosewell I. Hollenbach S. Larsen E. Daly G. Epe B. Seeberg E. Lindahl T. Barnes D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13300-13305Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) were housed under standard conditions. For isolation of nuclear and mitochondria fractions from the liver, the organ was removed from the animal and washed free of blood with M-SHE buffer. Mouse liver mitochondria were then isolated as previously described by Souza-Pinto et al. (23Souza-Pinto N.C. Croteau D.L. Hudson E.K. Hansford R.G. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1935-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Mouse liver nuclear extracts were prepared using the nuclear fraction obtained during the isolation of mitochondria, according to Kawakami et al. (28Kawakami K. Yanagisawa K. Watanabe Y. Tominaga S. Nagano K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with modifications described by Souza-Pinto et al. (26de Souza-Pinto N.C. Hogue B.A. Bohr V.A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Western Analysis—The purity of mitochondria and nuclear extracts were analyzed by Western blotting. Fifty μg of protein from the respective extracts were separated on a 4-12% bis-Tris NuPage gel (Novex) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Novex) by electroblotting in transfer buffer (Novex). The membrane was blocked at 5 °C in M-TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 137 mm NaCl, 0,1% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dry milk). Blots were probed with antibodies diluted in M-TBST. Primary antibodies were mouse monoclonal anti-CDC47 (Neomarkers) or mouse monoclonal anti-cytochrome oxidase IV (Molecular Probes). The secondary antibody was peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Detection was performed with ECL+Plus™ (Amersham Biosciences). Measurement of 8-OxoA Incision Activity—8-OxoA glycosylase and AP lyase activities were measured using an oligonucleotide incision assay as previously described (23Souza-Pinto N.C. Croteau D.L. Hudson E.K. Hansford R.G. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1935-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, to disrupt intact mitochondria, these were resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 300 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.05% Triton X-100. The mitochondrial suspension was subsequently diluted to a final concentration of 5 μg/μl protein and 100 mm KCl. Incision reactions (20 μl) contained 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 75 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.6 mm MgCl2, and 50 fmol of 32P-labeled duplex oligonucleotide (Table I). To increase incision efficiency for 8-oxoA, reactions with nuclear extract or mitochondria from human cells in culture were supplemented with 25-50 fmol of unlabeled duplex oligonucleotide without any lesion. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 32 °C (mouse liver extract) or 37 °C (human cell extract) for 4 h. The reaction conditions for purified proteins were as described for human cell extracts without adding the duplex undamaged oligonucleotide. The hOGG1 protein was a generous gift from the laboratory of Dr. E. Seeberg. Incision reactions were terminated by adding proteinase K to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml and SDS to a final concentration of 0.4% and incubated for 30 min at 55 °C. FA-loading dye was added to the samples, heated for 2 min at 95 °C, and analyzed on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. The radioactively labeled DNA was visualized using a Personal Molecular Imager™ and quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Incision activity was calculated as the ratio of damage-specific cleavage product to the total product and substrate in the reaction. Measurement of Uracil DNA Glycosylase Activity—Uracil DNA glycosylase activity was measured as a control for activity of the ogg1-/- mouse extract. For this purpose a 30-nucleotide oligomer containing a single deoxyuracil at position 12 was used (oligonucleotide 4, Table I). The reaction conditions were as previously described for measurement of 8-oxoA incision with mouse liver extract, except that incubation was with 100 fmol of substrate and incubation time was 2 h. Trapping Assay—DNA trapping reactions were performed according to Hazra et al. (29Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Maidt L. Floyd R.A. Mitra S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5116-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3-4 fmol of 32P-labeled 8-oxoA-containing oligonucleotide were incubated with 100 ng of purified hOGG1 or 30 μg of mitochondria or 30 μg of nuclear extract, as indicated, for 16 h at 37 °C in a reaction mixture (10 μl) containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 2 mm DTT, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 50 mm NaCNBH3. The samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and separated by SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide). The radioactively labeled DNA was visualized using a Personal Molecular Imager™. Statistical Analysis—The results are reported as mean ± S.D. of the result from three different extract preparations for each genotype and repeated three times for each preparation. The differences between groups were analyzed by the Student's t test, and p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Melting temperatures (Tm) for oligonucleotides 5, 6, and 7 were calculated according to Meinkoth and Wahl (30Meinkoth J. Wahl G. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Incorporation of Nucleotides Opposite 8-OxoA—Fig. 1 shows the structures of 8-oxoA and 8-oxoG. These nucleotides are quite similar in structure, as there are only minor differences in the 6-ring of the heterocyclic base. This suggests that they may be repaired by a similar mechanism in vivo. The 8-oxoG repair is strongly dependent on base pairing (17Rosenquist T.A. Zharkov D.O. Grollman A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7429-7434Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), which may also be the case for 8-oxoA. Thus, we set out to test this hypothesis. First, we examined which nucleotides may occur opposite 8-oxoA. For this purpose the low fidelity human pol β was employed in order not to exclude any infrequent base pairs. As seen in Fig. 2, pol β incorporated dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP at a reduced AP-site opposite 8-oxoA with similar efficiencies (Fig. 2, lanes 2-4), whereas dATP was incorporated with lower efficiency (Fig. 2, lane 1). Therefore, incision of 8-oxoA opposite all 4 bases was tested in the following experiments.Fig. 2Incorporation of nucleotides opposite 8-oxoA by human pol β An oligonucleotide containing 8-oxoA opposite a reduced AP site (oligonucleotide 1, Table I) was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 0.5 units of human pol β in the presence of 10 pmol of each dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP. In each lane the analogous nucleotide was substituted with [α-32P]dATP (lane 1), [α-32P]dGTP (lane 2), [α-32P]dCTP (lane 3), or [α-32P]dTTP (lane 4), respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Base Pairing-dependent Removal of 8-OxoA—Nuclei and mitochondria were isolated from wild type human cells (GM00637D) in culture. To ensure that mitochondrial extracts were rich in mitochondrial proteins and free of nuclear contamination, the extracts were analyzed for the presence of an abundant nuclear matrix protein, CDC47, and a mitochondrial protein, cytochrome oxidase IV, by Western blotting. Fig. 3 shows a typical Western blot assessing the quality of the mitochondrial extracts; nuclear extract was included as a control. Only minimum amounts of CDC47 were detected in the mitochondrial extract (Fig. 3), demonstrating that only traces of nuclear contamination were detected in the mitochondrial extracts. Purified yeast and murine OGG1 incise 8-oxoA when the lesion is base-paired with cytosine (12Girard P.M. D'Ham C. Cadet J. Boiteux S. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 1299-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 13Zharkov D.O. Rosenquist T.A. Gerchman S.E. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28607-28617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In this study, the incision activity of human OGG1 (hOGG1) was examined using 8-oxoA:C, 8-oxoA:G, 8-oxoA:A, and 8-oxoA:T containing substrates (oligonucleotide 1, Table I) (Fig. 4A). The results show that 8-oxoA:C was incised by purified hOGG1 (Fig. 4A, lane 6), but no incision was observed when 8-oxoA was base-paired with G, A, or T (Fig. 4A, lanes 2, 4, and 8). The hOGG1 activity was specific for the oxidized adenine as no incision was observed for an A:C mismatch (oligonucleotide 2, Table I; Fig. 4A, lane 5). Nuclear and mitochondrial extracts from human cells were also challenged with 8-oxoA-containing DNA substrates. Assay conditions were optimized by varying the amount of protein, Mg2+, and incubation time (data not shown). The results of assays using the optimized conditions are shown in Fig. 4, B and C. The nuclear extract produced a 10-nucleotide incision product when 8-oxoA was paired with cytosine or guanine (Fig. 4B, lanes 9 and 12). No incision was observed with a lesion-free oligonucleotide (oligonucleotide 2, Table I) (Fig. 4B, lanes 7 and 10) or with substrates containing 8-oxoA paired with adenine or thymine (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 6). The mitochondrial extract only cleaved substrates containing 8-oxoA paired with cytosine (Fig. 4C, lane 9), but did not cleave an undamaged oligonucleotide (Fig. 4C, lane 7) or substrates containing 8-oxoA paired with adenine, thymine, or guanine (Fig. 4C, lanes 3, 6, and 12). Influence of DNA Helix Structure on 8-OxoA Repair—Repair of 8-oxoA most likely involves a nucleotide flipping mechanism. Local secondary DNA structure may influence the efficiency of flipping and therefore affect glycosylase activity. This idea was tested by measuring 8-oxoA incision in different sequence contexts. To avoid partial or complete strand dissociation, these experiments were carried out with 60-nucleotide oligomers (oligonucleotides 5, 6, and 7) whose sequences are shown in Table I. The 10 bases surrounding the 8-oxoA in oligonucleotide 5 are guanine or cytosine, which creates high thermal stability (Tm = 80.5 °C). In oligonucleotide 6, the sequence surrounding the 8-oxoA lesion includes all 4 nucleotides and the substrate has lower thermal stability (Tm = 77.0 °C) than oligonucleotide 5. Oligonucleotide 7 has 5 adenines 5′ to the lesion and 5 thymines 3′ to the lesion. The adenine-thymine tract creates a stable molecular structure similar to B-DNA with a 4% contraction in the axial rise per residue and a bend at the junction between A:T and T:A base pairs (31Arnott S. Selsing E. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) thus, the 8-oxoA base is located at the DNA bend (32Koo H.S. Wu H.M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1986; 320: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). The melting temperature of alternating AT is lower than that of homopolymeric AT (31Arnott S. Selsing E. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). This means that the actual Tm of oligonucleotide 7 is higher than the calculated melting temperature (Tm = 73.6 °C). Fig. 5 shows that nuclear and mitochondrial extracts incised oligonucleotide 5 with the highest efficiency (Fig. 5A, lanes 1 and 5), oligonucleotide 6 with lower efficiency (Fig. 5A, lanes 2 and 6), and oligonucleotide 7 with the lowest efficiency (Fig. 5A, lanes 3 and 7) of the three DNA substrates. For the nuclear extract, 49 ± 7, 37 ± 2, or 22 ± 2% of oligonucleotides 5, 6, or 7, was cleaved, respectively (Fig. 5B). The percent cleavage values for the mitochondrial extract were similar (Fig. 5B), although a smaller difference in efficiency was seen between oligonucleotides 5 and 6 (31 ± 6 and 26 ± 3%, respectively). The mitochondrial extract incised a 61% lower fraction of oligonucleotide 7 (12 ± 2% incision) than oligonucleotide 5 (31 ± 6%). 8-OxoA Repair Defect in ogg1-/- Mice—The OGG1 gene encodes mitochondrial and nuclear isoforms of OGG1, which remove 8-oxoG from DNA in their respective organelles (33Grollman A.P. Moriya M. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 246-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 34de Souza-Pinto N.C. Eide L. Hogue B.A. Thybo T. Stevnsner T. Seeberg E. Klungland A. Bohr V.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5378-5381PubMed Google Scholar). It was considered possible that OGG1 incised 8-oxoA from the substrates in the assays described above. This possibility was tested using ogg1-/- mice. Nuclear and mitochondrial extracts were prepared using liver from wild type and ogg1-/- mice and the extracts were tested for incision activity using 8-oxoA:C and 8-oxoA:G oligonucleotides (oligonucleotide 1, Table I). Wild type mouse liver nuclear extract incised 8-oxoA:C and 8-oxoA:G base pairs (Fig. 6A, lanes 3 and 5). In contrast, the ogg1-/- nuclear extract did not incise 8-oxoA:C, but did incise 8-oxoA:G (Fig. 6A, lanes 7 and 8) to approximately the same extent as the wild type nuclear extract. The activity was DNA damage-specific (Fig. 6A, lanes 1 and 6). These results suggest that OGG1 is the only nuclear repair enzyme, which incises 8-oxoA when base paired with cytosine in mouse liver nuclei. In addition, a different repair enzyme in mouse nuclei incises 8-oxoA when it is base-paired with G. In human wild type mitochondria, 8-oxoA was only incised when base-paired with cytosine (Fig. 4C). Therefore, extracts from wild type and ogg1-/- mouse liver mitochondria were assayed with an 8-oxoA:C containing DNA substrate (oligonucleotide 1, Table I). The wild type mouse liver mitochondrial extract incised the 8-oxoA:C-containing substrate efficiently (Fig. 6B, lane 6), but no incision activity was observed with ogg1-/- mouse liver mitochondrial extract (Fig. 6B, lane 4). However, the ogg1-/- mitochondrial extract was active toward a 30-nucleotide oligomer containing uracil at position 12 (oligonucleotide 4, Table I). The amount of incision activity for this uracil-containing DNA was similar in wild type and ogg1-/- mitochondrial extracts (Fig. 6B, lanes 7 and 8). Thus, the ogg1-/- extracts are competent for repair of some DNA lesions including uracil. These data suggest that OGG1 is the only repair enzyme that cleaves 8-o"
https://openalex.org/W1972772092,"Polydnaviruses are essential for the survival of many Ichneumonoid endoparasitoids, providing active immune suppression of the host in which parasitoid larvae develop. The Cotesia rubecula bracovirus is unique among polydnaviruses in that only four major genes are detected in parasitized host (Pieris rapae) tissues, and gene expression is transient. Here we describe a novel C. rubecula bracovirus gene (CrV3) encoding a lectin monomer composed of 159 amino acids, which has conserved residues consistent with invertebrate and mammalian C-type lectins. Bacterially expressed CrV3 agglutinated sheep red blood cells in a divalent ion-dependent but Ca2+-independent manner. Agglutination was inhibited by EDTA but not by biological concentrations of any saccharides tested. Two monomers of ∼14 and ∼17 kDa in size were identified on SDS-PAGE in parasitized P. rapae larvae. The 17-kDa monomer was found to be an N-glyscosylated form of the 14-kDa monomer. CrV3 is produced in infected hemocytes and fat body cells and subsequently secreted into hemolymph. We propose that CrV3 is a novel lectin, the first characterized from an invertebrate virus. CrV3 shows over 60% homology with hypothetical proteins isolated from polydnaviruses in two other Cotesia wasps, indicating that these proteins may also be C-type lectins and that a novel polydnavirus lectin family exists in Cotesia-associated bracoviruses. CrV3 is probably interacting with components in host hemolymph, resulting in suppression of the Pieris immune response. The high similarity of CrV3 with invertebrate lectins, as opposed to those from viruses, may indicate that some bracovirus functions were acquired from their hosts.

Polydnaviruses are particles specifically associated with the ovaries of certain Braconid and Ichneumonid endoparasitoids (1Stoltz D.B. Vinson S.B. Adv. Virus Res. 1979; 24: 125-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). They are divided into genera, Ichnovirus and Bracovirus, based on differing host range and morphology (2Stoltz D.B. Whitfield J.B. J. Hym. Res. 1992; 1: 125-139Google Scholar). Polydnavirus genomes exist as a series of different circular DNA segments (3Krell P.J. Summers M.D. Vinson S.B. J. Virol. 1982; 43: 859-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are packaged singly or in groups into individual polydnavirus particles (1Stoltz D.B. Vinson S.B. Adv. Virus Res. 1979; 24: 125-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Particle-associated DNA segments are known to originate from wasp chromosomal DNA and are transferred in their integrated form to subsequent generations of wasps (4Stoltz D.B. Guzo D. Cook D. Virology. 1986; 155: 120-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, polydnaviruses from different wasps are genetically isolated from each other and considered as separate “species” (5Webb B.A. Miller L.K. Ball L.A. The Insect Viruses.

Virol. 1986; 57: 552-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Production of particles is restricted to specialized ovarian calyx cells (1Stoltz D.B. Vinson S.B. Adv. Virus Res. 1979; 24: 125-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and is initiated in the pupal phase, soon after the onset of cuticular melanization, and continues in female adult wasps (8Norton W.N.

Although the replication mechanism is not completely understood, recent evidence suggests that controlled localized chromosomal amplification occurs before excision of the particle segments (10Pasquier-Barre F. Dupuy C. Huguet E. Monteiro F. Moreau A. Poirié M. Drezen J.-M. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 2035-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Larger chromosomal segments may have smaller segments nested within (12Cui L. Webb B.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8504-8513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Particles accumulate in the oviduct and are injected into the host hemocoel, together with the parasitoid egg and various maternal secretions, at oviposition. The presence of polydnavirus particles is essential for survival of the egg and/or developing parasitoid larva (13Edson K.M. Vinson S.B. Stoltz D.B. Summers M.D. Science. 1981; 211: 582-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 14Stoltz D.B. Guzo D. J. Insect Physiol. 1986; 32: 377-388Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15Guzo D. Stoltz D.B. J. Insect Physiol. 1987; 33: 19-31Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Polydnavirus DNA segments do not contain genes for particle replication, so no particles are produced in the lepidopteran host (1Stoltz D.B. Vinson S.B. Adv. Virus Res. 1979; 24: 125-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 16Webb B.A. Cui L.W. J. Insect Physiol. 1998; 44: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Particles enter most host cell types (17Strand M.R. Mckenzie V. Grassl B.A. Aiken J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18Harwood S.H. Beckage N.E. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 685-698Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and viral transcripts are produced in the first few hours after parasitization. Transcripts are generated either transiently (19Asgari S. Hellers M. Schmidt O. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2653-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) or persistently (17Strand M.R. Mckenzie V. Grassl B.A. Aiken J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) during parasitism. Relative levels of Campoletis sonorensis ichnovirus gene expression in Helicoverpa virescens larvae depend largely on gene copy number (16Webb B.A. Cui L.W. J. Insect Physiol. 1998; 44: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); therefore, segment nesting could conceivably function to increase the copy number of genes essential for parasitoid survival. Such genes presumably would encode abundantly expressed, secreted proteins rather than intracellular proteins (16Webb B.A. Cui L.W. J. Insect Physiol. 1998; 44: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cotesia rubecula bracovirus (CrBV) 1The abbreviations used are: CrBV, Cotesia rubecula bracovirus; CTL, C-type lectin; CRD, carbohydrate recognition domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; ORBC, ovine red blood cell. genes are expressed in the host larvae, Pieris rapae, over a relatively short time period, from 4 to 12 h after parasitization (19Asgari S. Hellers M. Schmidt O. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2653-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). CrBV appears to express only 4 major genes, which differs from other systems, such as C. sonorensis ichnovirus, which is suspected of expressing over 35 genes comprising several gene families (20Turnbull M. Webb B. Adv. Virus Res. 2002; 58: 203-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The products of particle-associated genes act to suppress the host immune response (19Asgari S. Hellers M. Schmidt O. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2653-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21Strand M.R. Noda T. J. Insect Physiol. 1991; 37: 839-850Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22Li X. Webb B.A. J.

Physiol. 1997; 36: 251-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), most often by targeting hemocytes. Gene products may also lead to physiological disorders (e.g. arrested development) by interfering with the host endocrine system (26Vinson S.B. Iwantsch G.F. Q. Rev. Biol. 1980; 55: 143-165Crossref Google Scholar, 27Webb B.A. Dahlman D.L. J. Insect Physiol. 1986; 32: 339-345Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 28Lawrence P.O. Lanzrein B. Beckage N.E.

Insect Physiol. 1996; 42: 337-345Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Suppression of the host immune response appears to be the primary function of most polydnavirus genes expressed in lepidopteran larvae and is considered an important evolutionary adaptation for an organism directly exposed to the immune system of its host. One of the four major CrBV genes, CrV1, encodes a glycoprotein that is abundantly expressed in host tissues and inactivates hemocytes by destabilizing the cytoskeleton (19Asgari S. Hellers M. Schmidt O. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2653-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 30Asgari S. Schmidt O. Theopold U. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 3061-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As a result, infected hemocytes are unable to encapsulate the parasitoid egg. A 32-kDa wasp-specific protein (Crp32) produced in calyx cells is associated with particles and also covers the parasitoid's eggs, providing passive immune protection for the developing embryo (31Asgari S. Theopold U. Wellby C. Schmidt O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3690-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Whereas Crp32 appears to provide passive protection for the parasitoid, polydnavirus genes provide protection by actively suppressing host immune function. Both elements are required for survival and development of the C. rubecula parasitoid (31Asgari S. Theopold U. Wellby C. Schmidt O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3690-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). C-type lectins (CTLs) are proteins that bind to specific glycodeterminants and require the presence of divalent metal ions, most commonly Ca2+, to exhibit binding (32Kilpatrick D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). CTLs are defined by a series of conserved residues in their carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) (33Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence differences in various CRDs produce a range of carbohydrate binding specificities. CTLs are extremely diverse and have been subdivided into seven groups based on gene structure and nature of non-lectin domains (32Kilpatrick D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). One class, simple CTLs, has been isolated from invertebrates and appears to function as part of induced humoral immune responses (32Kilpatrick D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), presumably binding to carbohydrates on the surface of foreign bodies or damaged tissue. These lectins are generally multimeric, with each monomer containing one CRD, and most often bind galactose as the primary ligand (33Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Here we report on a novel CrBV gene, CrV3, the product of which shows divalent ion-dependent lectin activity and has a conserved CTL domain similar to those isolated from invertebrates and mammals. Although CTLs have been isolated from a range of invertebrates, this is the first report of a CTL associated with invertebrate viruses. Insect Cultures—C. rubecula (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) endoparasitoid wasps were reared on cabbage-fed P. rapae (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) as described previously (34Asgari S. Schmidt O. J. Insect Physiol. 1994; 40: 789-795Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Virus and Genomic DNA Isolation—Calyx fluid from 50 female wasps was collected in PBS (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, and 7.3 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.6) by homogenization of ovaries. The suspension was passed through a 0.45 μm syringe filter (Minisart®) and centrifuged at 15,800 × g in a desktop centrifuge for 15 min (35Beckage N.E. Tan F.F. Schleifer K.W. Lane R.D. Cherubin L.L. Arch. Insect Physiol. Biochem. 1994; 26: 165-195Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Pelleted virus particles were resuspended in 180 μl of PBS, and DNA was isolated from this suspension as described previously (4Stoltz D.B. Guzo D. Cook D. Virology. 1986; 155: 120-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). DNA was isolated from ovaries and female and male wasps by homogenizing them in a buffer made up of 10 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS, pH 8.0. Proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 0.25 μg/μl, and the samples were incubated at 40 °C overnight. Samples were treated with RNase A (125 μg/μl) at 37 °C for 30 min and then extracted with phenol/chloroform. DNA was precipitated by adding 2 volumes of ethanol and 0.2 volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.3, and centrifugation at 15,800 × g for 20 min. Pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried at 37 °C, and resuspended in water. Southern and Northern Hybridization—DNA samples were run on a 1% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from 6 h parasitized P. rapae caterpillars according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (37Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar). RNA samples were run on 1% agarose gels under denaturing conditions, using formaldehyde, and transferred to nylon membranes as described previously (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Construction and Screening of a 6 h Parasitized Larval P. rapae Library—Total RNA was extracted from P. rapae larvae at 6 h after parasitization by mated C. rubecula wasps (QuickPrep™ total RNA extraction kit; Amersham Biosciences). mRNA was then isolated from total RNA (PolyATtract™ mRNA isolation system; Promega). The isolated mRNA was used for construction of the cDNA library containing clones packaged in pBlueskript® SK(±) phagemids (cDNA synthesis kit, ZAP-cDNA® synthesis kit, and ZAP-cDNA® Gigapak® III Gold cloning kit; Stratagene). The library was amplified and titered according to the manufacturer's instructions before being probed with total CrBV DNA previously digested with BamHI and HindIII and labeled with 32P. Probes were prepared as described (Ready-To-Go™ DNA labeling beads; Amersham Biosciences). Positive clones were re-screened, resulting in isolation of the complete CrV3 coding region. CrV3 was sequenced using M13 forward and reverse primers directly from the phagemid vectors produced by the aforementioned protocols and subsequent automated sequencing (Applied Biosystems). PCR Amplifications—Specific primers to the CrV3 open reading frame (5′ primer CrV3-F and 3′ primer CrV3-R; see Fig. 1A) were designed containing SphI and PstI restriction sites to allow for direct ligation of the amplified fragment into the pQE30 expression vector (Qiagen). Primer sequences were as follows (restriction sites are underlined): CrV3-F, CGCGGCATGCAAAAACATAAGCATTCAG; and CrV3-R, GCGCCTGCAGTCACTCCTTTGTGCAGAAG. Approximately 30 ng of genomic DNA from female C. rubecula wasps or 100–350 ng of plasmid DNA was used as template in PCR reactions. A 50-μl reaction was prepared by mixing 5 μl of 10× reaction buffer, 3 μl of MgCl2 (Promega), 1 μl of CrV3-F primer (0.1 μg/μl), 1 μl of CrV3-R (0.1 μg/μl), 0.5 μl of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (15 mm), and 0.5 μl of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) and template DNA. After 5 min at 94 °C, 30 amplification cycles were run including denaturing at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 56 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. Final extension was carried out for 5 min at 72 °C. Reaction products were electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gels at 110 mA and visualized using ethidium bromide. Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)—CrV3-F and CrV3-R primers were used in RT-PCR of RNA isolated from 6 h parasitized P. rapae larvae, utilizing avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). 1.5 μg of RNA and 0.1 μg of CrV3-R primer, in a final volume of 10.7 μl, were heated to 95 °C for 5 min to denature RNA, before being cooled on ice. Reverse transcription was performed by adding 3 μl of 5× RT buffer (Promega), 0.3 μl of RNasin (Promega), 0.5 μl of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, and 0.5 μl of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (15 mm) before heating at 42 °C for 1 h and then heating at 95 °C for 5 min. The total contents were then used in a PCR by adding 3.5 μl of 10× reaction buffer, 1 μl of CrV3-F primer (0.1 μg/μl), 1 μl of CrV3-R (0.1 μg/μl), 0.5 μl of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (15 mm), 0.5 μl of Taq DNA polymerase, and 29 μl of H2O. Cycling, electrophores s, and visualization protocols were as performed for standard PCR of CrV3. Collection of Protein Samples and Western Blotting—P. rapae larvae were bled into PBS saturated with phenylthiourea via removal of a proleg, and the hemolymph was centrifuged at 2300 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Supernatant (cell-free hemolymph) was removed, and the cellular pellet was resuspended in PBS. Gut tissue and head capsule were removed, and the fat body was washed and then homogenized in PBS before centrifugation (9300 × g for 10 min) and removal of supernatant (fat body proteins). Protein samples were stored at –20 °C and electrophoresed on denaturing 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described by Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar). Proteins were generally not heated before electrophoresis unless testing the effect of heating. Samples were run in conjunction with SeeBlue™ pre-stained standard protein markers (Novex) to allow subsequent estimation of sample protein sizes. Proteins were either stained within the gels using Coomassie Blue (Sigma) or, alternatively, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Before obtaining anti-CrV3, blots were probed with a 1:10,000 dilution of an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated monoclonal anti-polyHistidine antibody (clone His-1; Sigma). Anti-CrV3 was used at a dilution of 1:5000 (see below). Expression of CrV3 in Bacteria—Gene-specific primers were designed (CrV3-F and CrV3-R) to amplify the open reading frame of the CrV3 gene, excluding a putative signal sequence corresponding to the first 14 amino acids of the protein (see Fig. 1). These primers were used in PCR of phagemid vector produced during library screening to obtain the required fragment for ligation into the pQE30 bacterial expression vector (Qiagen). The desired PCR product was purified (Perfectprep® Gel Cleanup Kit; Eppendorf), precipitated, and digested with SphI and PstI, as was pQE30, before ligation of the digested DNAs using T4 DNA ligase (Promega). M15 strain of Escherichia coli was transformed with the ligation reaction contents, using heat shock. Colonies containing desired recombinant vectors were identified by PCR of bacterial cells using vector-specific primers. Production of bacterial CrV3 (containing 6 additional vector-derived histidine residues) was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to bacterial cultures before incubation for 2 h at 37 °C. The resultant fusion protein was identified by Western blotting and contained mainly in the insoluble fraction of total bacterial proteins, with only a small amount being soluble. Purification of Insoluble Bacterial CrV3 Protein—50 ml of induced bacterial culture was centrifuged at ∼7700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were then resuspended in a lysis buffer (6 m GuHCl, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, and 0.01 m Tris, pH 8 .0) and gently rocked for 1 h. The sample was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C before incubation (1 h, RT) of the supernatant with 300 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin beads (Qiagen) previously equilibrated in 8 m urea (with 0.1 m NaH2PO4 and 0.01 m Tris, pH 8.0). Non-bound proteins were removed with buffers containing 8 m urea with pH > 6.3, and bound proteins were eluted with buffers containing 8 m urea with pH < 6.0. Samples were diluted with 2 volumes of water before being dialyzed overnight in Tris-buffered saline (0.15 m NaCl and 0.01 m Tris, pH 8.0) at 4 °C to remove excess urea to renature the protein. Protein was concentrated by vacuum drying. Anti-CrV3 Antibody Production—Purified bacterial CrV3 was visualized on 15% SDS-acrylamide gels by staining with water-dissolved Coomassie Blue. CrV3 protein bands were excised from the gel with sterile blades and crushed. One rabbit was used to produce anti-CrV3 by an initial injection of the purified CrV3 (∼5 μg) mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma), followed by two booster injections with purified CrV3 with Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma) at 2 and 4 weeks, respectively, after the initial injection. Antiserum was obtained 2 weeks after the final injection and used to probe Western blot membranes at a dilution of 1:5000. Bound anti-CrV3 was then visualized by alkaline phosphatase-labeled secondary anti-rabbit antibody (1:10,000). N-Glycosidase Digestion of CrV3—Total proteins from cell-free hemolymph of 6 h parasitized P. rapae larvae were mixed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. Igepal CA-630 nonionic detergent (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.8% before addition of 2 units of recombinant N-glycosidase F (Roche Diagnostics) and incubation for 18 h at 37 °C. Characterization of CrV3-mediated Hemagglutination—Lectin activity was measured by mixing 25 μl of serially diluted bacterial CrV3 extract with 25 μl of 2% trypsinized and gluteraldehyde-stabilized ovine red blood cells (ORBCs; Sigma) in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin. Samples were mixed well in U-bottomed microtiter wells before incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Complete agglutination caused ORBCs to form a diffuse layer over the bottom of the wells, whereas unagglutinated cells formed a small dot at the center of the wells. Lectin titer was determined as the reciprocal of the maximum sample dilution causing complete ORBC agglutination. To test for inhibitory ligands, 5 μl of sugar solution (various concentrations) in PBS was added before incubation in place of the 5 μl of PBS used to dilute ORBCs in the standard assay. Lipopolysaccaride (E. coli, serotype 055:B5A; Sigma) and Laminari tetrose were added as described for the other sugars, up to a maximum concentration of 1 mg/ml. Comparison of concentrations causing 50% inhibition of lectin activity was made for all sugars tested. To test for dependence of lectin activity on divalent cations, 25 μl of serial CrV3 sample dilutions was prepared in 1 mm divalent cations (Mg, Mn, and Ca) or 1 mm EDTA and mixed with 25 μl of 2% ORBCs as described above. Increasing concentrations of divalent cations were also added to EDTA-inhibited CrV3 to restore lectin activity. Molecular Characterization and Expression of CrV3—C. rubecula parasitoid wasps inject polydnavirus particles into the hemocoel of P. rapae larvae at oviposition, leading to infection of host tissues by the particles and transient expression of particle-associated genes (19Asgari S. Hellers M. Schmidt O. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2653-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). CrV1 was previously isolated by screening a cDNA library constructed from 6 h parasitized caterpillars using total CrBV DNA as a probe (19Asgari S. Hellers M. Schmidt O. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2653-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The same method was used here to isolate a ∼700-bp cDNA encompassing the coding region of a putative CrBV gene and including a poly(A) tail (Fig. 1A). To confirm the cDNA as particle-derived, the fragment was cloned and used as a probe in both a Southern blot of digested CrBV DNA (Fig. 2A) and a Northern blot of RNA from unparasitized and 6 h parasitized larvae (Fig. 2B). Hybridization occurred to a CrBV restriction fragment of ∼4 kb and to a parasitism-specific transcript of ∼1.1 kb. These data and the fact that the same probe bound to genomic DNA from female wasps but not to that from P. rapae (data not shown) indicate that the cDNA originated from particles introduced to the larvae at oviposition. Binding of the cDNA to only one site in the Northern blot reveals that CrV3 shows no significant nucleotide sequence homology with other CrBV-related genes. The cDNA was subsequently sequenced with data showing an open reading frame of 480 bp (Fig. 1A). A methionine codon (ATG) at the beginning of the open reading frame was identified as the only possible codon with a nucleotide sequence environment predicted for functional initiation codons (39Cavener R.C. Ray S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The predicted molecular mass of CrV3 is 17.6 kDa, with a pI of 9.13. Computer analyses (PSORT II; psort.nibb.ac.jp/form2.html) of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed a putative signal peptide encompassing the first 14 amino acids of the protein, with a cleavage point predicted at the end of the signal peptide (Fig. 1A), indicating that CrV3 protein is probably secreted from cells of origin. A hydrophobicity plot (Fig. 1B) was produced using ProtScale software (40Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17215) Google Scholar). Highly hydrophobic residues near the N terminus support predictions of signal sequence composed of N-terminal amino acids. Three putative N-glycosylation sites were found in the open reading frame, as well as a polyadenylation signal ∼150 bp downstream of the stop codon (Fig. 1A). Sequence data were used to generate specific primers to the CrV3 open reading frame (CrV3-F and CrV3-R; see Fig. 1A). Comparison of RT-PCR and genomic DNA PCR products, utilizing these primers, revealed the presence of a 186-bp intron in the genomic CrV3 DNA. The intron was located within the conserved lectin domain. The CrV3 open reading frame (excluding the putative signal peptide) was cloned into pQE30 vector and used to transform Escherichia coli cells in which the CrV3 protein was subsequently induced. Analysis of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing proteins from non-induced and induced cells showed the presence of a ∼16-kDa protein that was heavily up-regulated in induced cells and present mainly in the insoluble portion of the total bacterial proteins (data not shown). Nickel resin beads were used to purify the protein. Confirmation of purification of the up-regulated protein was achieved by using Western blot analysis with anti-polyHistidine as a probe (Fig. 2C). Purified protein from the insoluble fraction was used for injection into rabbits and production of putative anti-CrV3 antibodies. Serum from injected rabbits was used to probe cell-free hemolymph from non-parasitized and 6 h parasitized P. rapae larvae. The serum hybridized to a parasitism-specific protein that was not recognized by rabbit pre-serum (data not shown), confirming successful production of anti-CrV3 antibodies. Western blots utilizing anti-CrV3"
https://openalex.org/W1965717292,"Pierisin-1, a cytotoxic protein found naturally in the cabbage butterfly, induces apoptosis of mammalian cells. Our recent studies suggest that pierisin-1 consists of an N-terminal ADP-ribosyltransferase domain, and a C-terminal region that binds to receptors on the surfaces of target cells and incorporates the protein into cells. The present study was undertaken to identify receptors for pierisin-1. The cross-linking and cloning experiments suggested that the proteins on cell membrane had no binding ability to pierisin-1. Inhibitory assays of fractionated lipids from human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, which are highly sensitive to pierisin-1, indicated neutral glycosphingolipids on the cell surface to show receptor activity. Inhibitory assays and TLC immunostaining using anti-pierisin-1 antibodies demonstrated two neutral glycosphingolipids as active components. Analysis of their structures with glycosphingolipid-specific antibodies and negative secondary ion mass spectrometry identified them as globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotetraosylceramide (Gb4). The receptor activities of Gb3 and Gb4 for pierisin-1 were also confirmed with these authentic compounds. Pierisin-1-insensitive mouse melanoma MEB4 cells were found to lack pierisin-1 receptors, including Gb3 and Gb4, but pretreatment of the cells with glycosphingolipid Gb3 or Gb4 enhanced their sensitivity to pierisin-1. Thus, Gb3 and Gb4 were proven to serve as pierisin-1 receptors. The C-terminal region of pierisin-1 consists of possible lectin domains of a ricin B-chain, containing QXW sequences, which are essential for its structural organization. Alteration of QXW by site-directed mutagenesis caused marked reduction of pierisin-1 cytotoxicity. Thus, our results suggest that pierisin-1 binds to Gb3 and Gb4 receptors at the C-terminal region, in a manner similar to ricin, and then exhibits cytotoxicity after incorporation into the cell. Pierisin-1, a cytotoxic protein found naturally in the cabbage butterfly, induces apoptosis of mammalian cells. Our recent studies suggest that pierisin-1 consists of an N-terminal ADP-ribosyltransferase domain, and a C-terminal region that binds to receptors on the surfaces of target cells and incorporates the protein into cells. The present study was undertaken to identify receptors for pierisin-1. The cross-linking and cloning experiments suggested that the proteins on cell membrane had no binding ability to pierisin-1. Inhibitory assays of fractionated lipids from human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, which are highly sensitive to pierisin-1, indicated neutral glycosphingolipids on the cell surface to show receptor activity. Inhibitory assays and TLC immunostaining using anti-pierisin-1 antibodies demonstrated two neutral glycosphingolipids as active components. Analysis of their structures with glycosphingolipid-specific antibodies and negative secondary ion mass spectrometry identified them as globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotetraosylceramide (Gb4). The receptor activities of Gb3 and Gb4 for pierisin-1 were also confirmed with these authentic compounds. Pierisin-1-insensitive mouse melanoma MEB4 cells were found to lack pierisin-1 receptors, including Gb3 and Gb4, but pretreatment of the cells with glycosphingolipid Gb3 or Gb4 enhanced their sensitivity to pierisin-1. Thus, Gb3 and Gb4 were proven to serve as pierisin-1 receptors. The C-terminal region of pierisin-1 consists of possible lectin domains of a ricin B-chain, containing QXW sequences, which are essential for its structural organization. Alteration of QXW by site-directed mutagenesis caused marked reduction of pierisin-1 cytotoxicity. Thus, our results suggest that pierisin-1 binds to Gb3 and Gb4 receptors at the C-terminal region, in a manner similar to ricin, and then exhibits cytotoxicity after incorporation into the cell. Pierisin-1 is a 98-kDa protein present in the cabbage butterfly that has potent cytotoxic activity (1Koyama K. Wakabayashi K. Masutani M. Koiwai K. Watanabe M. Yamazaki S. Kono T. Miki K. Sugimura T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1996; 87: 1259-1262Google Scholar, 2Watanabe M. Kono T. Koyama K. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1998; 89: 556-561Google Scholar). Among 13 mammalian cell lines so far tested, human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells are the most sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of pierisin-1, whereas mouse melanoma MEB4 cells are the least sensitive, with an IC50 value ∼5000 times higher (3Kono T. Watanabe M. Koyama K. Kishimoto T. Fukushima S. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Cancer Lett. 1999; 137: 75-81Google Scholar, 4Kanazawa T. Watanabe M. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Kono T. Tanaka N. Koyama K. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2226-2231Google Scholar, 5Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Watanabe M. Kono T. Kanazawa T. Koyama K. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5742-5750Google Scholar). Pierisin-1 is a potent inducer of apoptosis of mammalian cells, which is accompanied by cleavage of DNA to nucleosome units and of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (2Watanabe M. Kono T. Koyama K. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1998; 89: 556-561Google Scholar, 3Kono T. Watanabe M. Koyama K. Kishimoto T. Fukushima S. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Cancer Lett. 1999; 137: 75-81Google Scholar). Cloning of a complementary DNA (cDNA) of piersin-1 fromPieris rapae revealed that pierisin-1 shares sequence homology with the enzyme units of ADP-ribosylating toxins, including the A-subunit of cholera toxin in its 27-kDa N-terminal region (6Watanabe M. Kono T. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Kanazawa T. Nishisaka N. Kishimoto T. Koyama K. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10608-10613Google Scholar). Furthermore, substitution of a glutamic acid residue at a presumed NAD-binding site caused loss of cytotoxic activity, suggesting an essential role for ADP-ribosylating activity in exerting the cytotoxicity of piersin-1 (6Watanabe M. Kono T. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Kanazawa T. Nishisaka N. Kishimoto T. Koyama K. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10608-10613Google Scholar). Similarly, pierisin-2 from Pieris brassicae has been suggested to exert its action through ADP-ribosyltransferase (5Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Watanabe M. Kono T. Kanazawa T. Koyama K. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5742-5750Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that the target molecule for mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation catalyzed by pierisin-1 is a DNA, but not a protein, providing a contrast to bacteria-derived ADP-ribosylating toxins such as cholera toxin and pertussis toxin (7Takamura-Enya T. Watanabe M. Totsuka Y. Kanazawa T. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Koyama K. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12414-12419Google Scholar). Pierisin-1 efficiently catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of double-stranded DNA. The ADP-ribose moiety of NAD is transferred by pierisin-1 to the amino group at N2 of the deoxyguanosine base (7Takamura-Enya T. Watanabe M. Totsuka Y. Kanazawa T. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Koyama K. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12414-12419Google Scholar). An in vitro expressed peptide consisting of only the N-terminal region exhibited cytotoxicity and apoptosis-inducing activity when it was incorporated by electroporation (4Kanazawa T. Watanabe M. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Kono T. Tanaka N. Koyama K. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2226-2231Google Scholar). However, the N-terminal peptide alone could not be incorporated into the cells. The remaining 71-kDa C-terminal region plays a role in binding and internalization of the whole protein into the target mammalian cells (4Kanazawa T. Watanabe M. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Kono T. Tanaka N. Koyama K. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2226-2231Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of pierisin-1 shares sequence similarity with HA-33 (or HA1), a subcomponent of hemagglutinin of botulinum toxin (8Tsuzuki K. Kimura K. Fujii N. Yokosawa N. Indoh T. Murakami T. Oguma K. Infect Immun. 1990; 58: 3173-3177Google Scholar, 9Inoue K. Fujinaga Y. Watanabe T. Ohyama T. Takeshi K. Moriishi K. Nakajima H. Oguma K. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1589-1594Google Scholar). Recent reports of a requirement for sialic acid or galactose moieties for binding of HA-33 suggest that glycolipids or glycoproteins might similarly play a role in binding of pierisin-1 to cells (10Inoue K. Fujinaga Y. Honke K. Yokota K. Ikeda T. Ohyama T. Takeshi K. Watanabe T. Inoue K. Oguma K. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 2533-2542Google Scholar, 11Fujinaga Y. Inoue K. Nomura T. Sasaki J. Marvaud J.C. Popoff M.R. Kozaki S. Oguma K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 179-183Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that addition of the lipid fraction prepared from HeLa cells, being highly sensitive to pierisin-1, to the medium inhibited the cytotoxic activity of pierisin-1 as did the membrane fraction (4Kanazawa T. Watanabe M. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Kono T. Tanaka N. Koyama K. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2226-2231Google Scholar). Therefore, components of the glycolipids on the membrane in HeLa cells might act as receptors for pierisin-1. The present study was designed to explore this possibility. Two glycosphingolipids were thereby identified as receptor molecules. Immunostaining with antibodies against glycosphingolipids and their structural analysis by mass spectrometry indicated them to be the neutral glycosphingolipids Gb3 1The abbreviations used are: Gb3, globotriaosylceramide; Gb4, globotetraosylceramide; Gb5, globopentaosylceramide; GalCer, galactosylceramide; GlcCer, glucosylceramide; LacCer, lactosylceramide; Cer, ceramide; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SIMS, secondary ion mass spectrometry; GM1, Galβ1-3GalNacβ1-4(Neu5Aca2-3)Galβ1-4Glcβ1-1′Cer; GM2, GalNacβ1-4(Neu5Aca2-3)Galβ1-4Glcβ1-1′Cer; GM3, Neu5Aca2-3Galβ1-4Glcβ1-1′Cer. 1The abbreviations used are: Gb3, globotriaosylceramide; Gb4, globotetraosylceramide; Gb5, globopentaosylceramide; GalCer, galactosylceramide; GlcCer, glucosylceramide; LacCer, lactosylceramide; Cer, ceramide; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SIMS, secondary ion mass spectrometry; GM1, Galβ1-3GalNacβ1-4(Neu5Aca2-3)Galβ1-4Glcβ1-1′Cer; GM2, GalNacβ1-4(Neu5Aca2-3)Galβ1-4Glcβ1-1′Cer; GM3, Neu5Aca2-3Galβ1-4Glcβ1-1′Cer. and Gb4. 2The assignment of gangliosides is based on Svennerholm's designation. 2The assignment of gangliosides is based on Svennerholm's designation. The possible structure and function of the C-terminal region of pierisin-1 were also investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. Human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells and mouse melanoma MEB4 cells were obtained from the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) cell bank (Tsukuba, Japan). The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 50 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate (Invitrogen) unless otherwise described. Cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. The cross-linking studies of pierisin-1 to binding protein were carried out as described previously (12Hirai R. Kaji K. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 201: 119-125Google Scholar). HeLa cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in binding buffer (128 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A), and then appropriate amounts of pierisin-1 (0–1.6 μg/ml) in the same buffer were added followed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing four times with binding buffer, the cells were treated for an additional 15 min with 0.3 mm disuccinimidyl suberate. Cells were washed once with sucrose buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mmEDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A) and solubilized in solubilization buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) for 40 min at 4 °C. The solubilized material was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 10 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with the anti-pierisin-1 polyclonal antibody. For the panning procedure, a modification of the procedure of Almenoff et al. (13Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Google Scholar, 14Almenoff J.S. Williams S.I. Scheving L.A. Judd A.K. Schoolnik G.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 865-873Google Scholar) was employed. In the first round of screening, COS cells were transfected with a human liver cDNA library (Takara 9505). After 72 h, the cells were pooled and resuspended in panning buffer (PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and 0.02% NaN3 5% fetal calf serum), and the panning plates were coated with pierisin-1 (44 μg per plate in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.5) for 3 h and blocked with PBS containing 0.1% BSA at 4 °C for overnight. The transfected COS cells were then distributed into the coated plates, allowed to attach for 10 min at room temperature, then washed three times gently with panning buffer. Then cells remaining on the dishes were lysed, and plasmid DNA was recovered by the alkaline Miniprep method and amplified in Escherichia coli to obtain material for the next cycle of panning. Receptor activity was monitored by inhibitory effects on cytotoxicity of pierisin-1 to HeLa cells using a method described previously (4Kanazawa T. Watanabe M. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Kono T. Tanaka N. Koyama K. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2226-2231Google Scholar). Total lipids were extracted from 5 × 108 harvested cells according to the method of Murayama et al. (15Murayama K. Levery B.S. Schirrmacher V. Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1395-1402Google Scholar). Briefly, packed cells were extracted twice with 2-propanol/hexane/water (55:25:20, v/v) by sonication for 5 min followed by centrifuging. The pellet was re-extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and subsequently with chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). The combined extract was then evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in 1 ml of solvent A (chloroform/methanol/water, 30:60:8, v/v). To remove phospholipids, mild alkaline degradation was performed in 0.5n sodium hydroxide in methanol at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by dialysis against water overnight and lyophilization. The lyophilized sample was dissolved in solvent A and applied to DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column (bed volume 16 ml, acetate form) (AmershamBiosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). Neutral glycosphingolipids were recovered in the flowthrough fractions, while acidic glycosphingolipids were eluted with solvent A containing 0.8 m sodium acetate. For further purification of individual glycosphingolipids, the flowthrough fractions were developed on TLC plates of Silica Gel 60 (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) with solvent B (chloroform/methanol/water, 65:25:4, v/v). Spots on TLC plates corresponding to each glycosphingolipid were scraped off, and the lipids were extracted with solvent B. The extracts were then evaporated, and the residue was suspended with water, dialyzed overnight against 10 mmEDTA, and then lyophilized. EDTA was removed by passage through a Sephadex LH-20 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with solvent A. The eluates were used for further experiments. TLC immunostaining for detection of molecules bound with pierisin-1 was performed as follows. Glycosphingolipids were developed on a plastic TLC plate (Polygram SIL G, Macherey-Nagel, Germany) using solvent B. Two chromatograms were developed in parallel on the same sheet. One was visualized with orcinol reagent for chemical detection of glycosphingolipids. The other was soaked overnight in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin (PBS/BSA) at 4 °C to block nonspecific antibody binding. The plate was incubated for 1 h with pierisin-1 (2 μg/ml) in PBS/BSA. After rinsing with PBS, the plate was soaked for 10 min at room temperature in PBS containing 4% formaldehyde. After washing four times with PBS, the plate was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 1:1000 diluted rabbit anti-pierisin-1 antisera (4Kanazawa T. Watanabe M. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Kono T. Tanaka N. Koyama K. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2226-2231Google Scholar) in PBS/BSA containing 5% goat serum. The plate was then washed five times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and washed once with PBS/BSA. Pierisin-1, bound with anti-pierisin-1 antibody, was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 1:2000 diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (#NA9340, AmershamBiosciences) in PBS/BSA. After washing five times with PBS, the bound antibody was visualized with an ECL chemiluminescence kit (AmershamBiosciences). TLC immunostaining with anti-Gb3 and anti-Gb4 antibodies was performed using the procedure of Miyamoto et al. (16Miyamoto D. Ueno T. Takashima S. Ohta K. Miyawaki T. Suzuki T. Suzuki Y. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 379-388Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Mouse anti-Gb3 IgM monoclonal antibody (TU-1) (16Miyamoto D. Ueno T. Takashima S. Ohta K. Miyawaki T. Suzuki T. Suzuki Y. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 379-388Google Scholar) and mouse anti-Gb4 IgM monoclonal antibody, which was kindly provided by Dr. Sen-itiroh Hakomori, Pacific Northwest Research Institute, Seattle, WA (9G7) (17von dem Borne A.E. Bos M.J. Joustra-Maas N. Tromp J.F. van't Veer M.B. van Wijngaarden-du Bois R. Tetteroo P.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1986; 63: 35-46Google Scholar), were used for Gb3 and Gb4 detection, respectively. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG/M antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) was used as the secondary antibody. The plate for Gb3 detection was stained in substrate solution (2 mm of 4-chloro-1-naphthol, 1.2 mm N,N′-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine, 0.04% hydrogen peroxide in 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 6.0). The bound anti-Gb4 antibody was visualized by using an ECL chemiluminescence kit. For conversion of Gb4 to Gb3, the isolated glycosphingolipids were incubated with β-N-acetylhexosaminidase from jack beans (Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan). The resulting products were also assayed by TLC immunostaining. Glycosphingolipids that were separated on the TLC plate were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by the TLC blotting method (18Kasama T. Hisano Y. Nakajima M. Handa S. Taki T. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 461-469Google Scholar). The appropriate position, sized at about 2 mm in diameter, was cut out and placed on the SIMS target tip with 0.5 μl of triethanolamine as the SIMS matrix. The SIMS spectra of the glycosphingolipids in negative ion mode were obtained using a TSQ70 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) equipped with a 20-KeV cesium ion gun. MEB4 cells, maintained in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen)-reduced serum (0.5% FBS (HyClone)) medium for at least 1 week, were trypsinized and suspended in a reduced serum medium at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml. In the next step, a 100-μl aliquot of the cell suspension was dispensed in each well of the 96-well plate and cultured for 18 h. The cells in each well were then incubated for 6 h with 100 μl of the reduced serum medium containing 100 μg/ml (Gb4, Gb5, or GM3) or 10 μg/ml (Gb3) of glycosphingolipid (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). After removal of the glycosphingolipid-containing medium, the cells in each well were washed with the medium and incubated for 1 h with 100 μl of the medium containing pierisin-1. After washing they were further cultured in the same medium for 48 h, and the effects of the incorporated glycosphingolipid on the cytotoxicity of pierisin-1 were examined by phase-contrast microscopy and WST-1 cell proliferation assay described previously (2Watanabe M. Kono T. Koyama K. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1998; 89: 556-561Google Scholar). A DNA fragment containing the altered sequence at desired position was amplified from an intact pierisin-1 cDNA subclone (6Watanabe M. Kono T. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Kanazawa T. Nishisaka N. Kishimoto T. Koyama K. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10608-10613Google Scholar) by overlap extension PCR technique (19Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Google Scholar, 20Tao B.Y. Lee K.C.P. Griffin H.G. Griffin A.M. PCR Technology. Current Innovation. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1994: 69-83Google Scholar). To obtain overlapped 5′- and 3′-fragments, two separate PCR reactions were carried out, using a 5′ primer (5′-TTCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTA-3′) and a 3′ primer (primer A, shown in TableI) for the 5′-fragment and a 5′ primer (primer B, shown in Table I) and a 3′ primer (5′-ATAACAATAACAACAACCTCGG-3′) for the 3′-fragment. Primers A and B are complementary to each other and contain mutations of interest. Following the amplifications, these PCR products were subjected to a second round of PCR to obtain full-length mutated DNA fragment. The 25-μl reaction mixture contained 5 μl each of PCR solution of 5′- and 3′-fragments. The thermocycle conditions were 5 cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 15 s, re-annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. Using this protocol, more than half the 5′- and 3′-fragments could be converted to full-length DNA fragments. The resultant DNA was used as the template for the in vitro expression system described previously (6Watanabe M. Kono T. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Kanazawa T. Nishisaka N. Kishimoto T. Koyama K. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10608-10613Google Scholar) using MEGAscript and rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Ambion, Austin, TX). The PCR primer for attachment of T7 promoter sequence was 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGAATTGCCACCATGGCTGACCGTCAACCTTA-3′. The cytotoxicity of each translated protein in HeLa cells was assessed by the WST-1 cell proliferation assay (2Watanabe M. Kono T. Koyama K. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Jpn. J.

Pierisin-1 exhibits cytotoxicity against mammalian cells after being incorporated into the cells by interaction of its C-terminal region with the receptor on the cell membrane. To identify the possible receptor protein, we performed cross-linking experiments. HeLa cells were incubated with pierisin-1, cross-linked at each amino group by disuccinimidyl suberate, and then subjected to Western blotting. However, no cross-reacting bands were observed. Specific binding of pierisin-1 to a membrane protein was further examined by expression cloning of a cDNA encoding a possible receptor from a human liver cDNA library through the affinity panning system. The selectivity for pierisin-1 receptor expression was analyzed using COS cells transiently transfected with the human liver cDNA library. To select COS clones expressing receptor cDNA, the transfected cells were placed on panning plates coated with pierisin-1. However, positive cells were not detected. These results suggested that the protein fraction has no ability bind to pierisin-1. It is plausible that receptor molecules competitively inhibit the binding of pierisin-1 to the cells, thereby inhibiting cytotoxicity. We have reported that membrane fractions from HeLa cells and total lipid fraction of HeLa cells inhibited cytotoxic activity of pierisin-1 (4Kanazawa T. Watanabe M. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Kono T. Tanaka N. Koyama K. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2226-2231Google Scholar). Treatment of HeLa cells with 2 ng/ml pierisin-1 at a pulse duration of 15 min induced cell death in about 50% of the cells. Contrary to this, preincubation of 2 ng/ml pierisin-1 with about 50 μg of total lipid fraction from HeLa cells before the treatment caused cell death in only 20%. Furthermore, an inhibitory assay of fractionated lipid from HeLa cells suggested that a polar lipid fraction, which contains glycolipids and phospholipids, has a binding ability to pierisin-1 (data not shown). To determine which of the polar lipids on HeLa cells is the receptor candidate, we first obtained glycosphingolipids from the total lipids of HeLa cells by mild alkaline degradation and dialysis and then analyzed the inhibitory effects on cytotoxicity. The inhibitory effects of the glycosphingolipids on cytotoxicity were stronger than for the parent material, the total lipid fraction, suggesting that the glycosphingolipids are the major source of pierisin-1 receptor. When the glycosphingolipids were further separated into neutral and acidic glycosphingolipids by DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column chromatography, about 75% of the inhibitory activity was recovered in flowthrough fractions, whereas no such activity was observed in any of the eluted fractions, which contain acidic glycosphingolipids. These findings indicate that neutral glycosphingolipids are pierisin-1 receptor candidates. None of the samples isolated from pierisin-1-insensitive MEB4 cells with the same methods exhibited any inhibitory effects. The neutral glycosphingolipids from HeLa cells were developed on a TLC plate using solvent B (Fig. 1). Of the various glycosphingolipids in the fraction stained with orcinol reagent, two major doublet bands, each doublet probably representing different sugar residues with two different classes of ceramide, were clearly detected by TLC immunostaining with anti-pierisin-1 antibodies (Fig. 1). The mobility of these two sets of bands was similar to those of authentic Gb3 and Gb4, which also exhibited binding ability with pierisin-1. In the next step, we purified both positive doublet bands, designated as fractions I and II (Fig. 1), by preparative TLC and analyzed their effects on pierisin-1 cytotoxicity. As expected, a decrease was noted following addition of either of the two fractions (data not shown), suggesting Gb3 and Gb4 to be receptor glycolipids, present in HeLa cells. Fractions I and II showed positive bands on TLC immunostaining with anti-Gb3 and anti-Gb4 antibodies, respectively (Fig.2). Moreover, degradation products of both fraction II and authentic Gb4 with β-N-acetylhexosaminidase were confirmed to be Gb3 by TLC immunostaining using anti-Gb3 antibody (data not shown). These data strongly suggested that sugar residues of the glycosphingolipids isolated from HeLa cells, exhibiting receptor activity, are identical to those of Gb3 and Gb4, respectively. For further confirmation of the structures of the isolated glycosphingolipids, each glycosphingolipid from fractions I and II was analyzed by negative ion SIMS (Fig. 3). Deprotonated molecules ([M-H]−) were observed atm/z 1106.9 and 1132.9 in the spectrum for that from fraction I, as shown in Fig. 3 A. The ion ofm/z 1106.9 corresponded to Gb3, consisting of sphingenine (d18:1) and docosanoic acid (C22:0) as ceramide. The ion of m/z 1132.9 corresponded to Gb3 consisting of d18:1 and tetracosenoic acid (C24:1) as ceramide. The fragment ions were weakly observed at m/z 808.7 and 970.7, corresponding to GlcCer and LacCer (d18:1/C24:1), respectively. Thus, the structure for both compounds was determined to be Gb3 (Gal-Gal-Glc-Cer). A deprotonated molecule was observed atm/z 1336.1 in the spectrum of the glycosphingolipid from fraction II, as shown in Fig. 3 B, thus corresponding to Gb4, consisting of d18:1 and C24:1 as ceramide. Fragment ions observed at m/z 646.6, 808.8, 970.8, and 1133.0 corresponded to ceramide, GlcCer, LacCer, and Gb3 (d18:1/C24:1), respectively. Accordingly, the structure of the compound was concluded to be Gb4 (GalNac-Gal-Gal-Glc-Cer). We then examined the inhibitory effects of a series of glycolipids on the cytotoxicity of pierisin-1 to HeLa cells. As shown in Table II, authentic Gb3 and Gb4 exhibited clear inhibition. Furthermore, authentic Gb5 exhibited similar activity as well as binding to pierisin-1 on TLC immunostaining with anti-pierisin-1 antibody (data not shown). However, GalCer, GlcCer, and LacCer had no inhibitory activity. An oligonucleotide sugar, Galα1–4Galβ1–4Glc, corresponding to the terminal sugar sequence of Gb3, also showed no such inhibitory effect. Other glycolipids such as gangliosides GM1, GM2, and GM3, as well as asialo-GM1 and asialo-GM2 did not affect the cytotoxicity of pierisin-1. Thus, Gb3 might be the minimal requirement structure for the pierisin-1 receptor.Table IIInhibitory effects of various glycolipids on cytotoxicity of pierisin-1Inhibition activityNeutral glycosphingolipidsGalCerGalβ1-1′Cer−GlcCe"
https://openalex.org/W2054271691,"By using the yeast two-hybrid system, the zinc finger protein ZPR9 was identified as one of the B-MYB interacting proteins that associates with the carboxyl-terminal conserved region of B-MYB. ZPR9 was found to form in vivo complexes with B-MYB, as demonstrated by in vivobinding assay and coimmunoprecipitation experiments of the endogenously and exogenously expressed proteins. Deletion analysis revealed that this binding was mediated by all three functional domains, an amino-terminal DNA-binding domain, a transactivation domain, and a carboxyl-terminal conserved region of B-MYB. We show that the interaction of ZPR9 with B-MYB is functional because cotransfection of ZPR9 significantly up-regulates B-MYBtranscriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, coexpression of ZPR9 with B-MYBcaused the accumulation of B-MYB, as well as ZPR9, in the nucleus. Furthermore, constitutive expression of ZPR9 in human neuroblastoma cells induces apoptosis in the presence of retinoic acid. These results strongly suggest that ZPR9 plays an important role in modulation of the transactivation by B-MYB and cellular growth of neuroblastoma cells.

B-MYB is a member of the MYB family of transcription factors, which is ubiquitously expressed and is involved in controlling cell proliferation and differentiation (1Nomura N. Takahashi M. Matsui M.

B-MYB is phylogenetically the most divergent among the three MYB proteins, A-MYB, B-MYB, and c-MYB (6Lipsick J.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 223-235Google Scholar). Recent reports showed that the CDK2-cyclin A complex could induce phosphorylation of B-MYB and potentiate the B-MYB transactivating function and that this activation was also induced by truncation of the carboxyl terminus of B-MYB, suggesting that post-translational modifications are required for relieving the constitutive repression of B-MYB(7Saville M.K.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1699-1707Google Scholar) indicated that the B-MYB transactivation correlates with the binding of some cofactors to the carboxyl-terminal conserved region, suggested as a protein binding domain and a putative phosphorylation site. The MYB proteins are composed of three functional domains for transactivation, an amino-terminal DNA-binding domain, a central acidic region (transactivation domain), and a carboxyl-terminal negative regulatory domain containing the leucine zipper motif (12Nakagoshi H. Takemoto Y. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14161-14167Google Scholar). Recently, all these domains have been reported to be involved in interactions with several cellular proteins. The DNA-binding domain of c-MYB was found to bind with several proteins such as p100 coactivator (13Dash A.B. Orrico F.C. Ness S.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1858-1869Google Scholar, 14Tavner F.J.

In addition, recent reports have shown that the DNA-binding domain of A-MYB and B-MYB interacts with several nuclear proteins (18Ying G.-G. Proost P. Damme J.V. Bruschi M. Introna M. Golay J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4152-4158Google Scholar, 20Ying G.-G. Arsura M. Introna M. Golay J. J. Biol.

Sala A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10692-10696Google Scholar), respectively. On the other hand, the cAMP-response element-binding protein has been demonstrated to interact directly with the transactivation domain of both c-MYB and A-MYB and potentiate their transcriptional activity (22Oelgeschlager M. Janknecht R. Krieg J. Schreek S. Luscher B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2771-2780Google Scholar, 23Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Hou D.X. Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Takahashi T. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 528-540Google Scholar). The leucine zipper motif of the carboxyl-terminal domain was also found to associate with several proteins, including p26/28 (24Bartunek P. Karafiat V. Dvorakova M. Zahorova V. Mandikova S. Zenke M. Dvorak M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2939-2949Google Scholar), p67, and p160 (25Favier D. Gonda T.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 305-311Google Scholar, 26Gonda T.J. Favier D. Ferrao P. Macmillan E.M. Simpson R. Tavner F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 211: 99-109Google Scholar), and ATBF1 transcription factor (27Kaspar P. Dvorakova M. Kralova J. Pajer P. Kozmik Z. Dvorak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14422-14428Google Scholar), but these interactions except for ATBF1 have not been implicated in the regulation of MYB function so far. From these results, it is tempting to speculate that additional proteins may be involved in the regulation of transactivation by B-MYB, probably by association with the carboxyl-terminal conserved region that shows significant homology with other members of the MYB gene family such as A-MYB and c-MYB. ZPR9, a zinc finger protein, was originally identified as a novel cellular partner for the MPK38 serine/threonine kinase that may be involved in early T cell activation by concanavalin A (28Gil M. Yang Y. Ha H. Immunol. Lett. 1998; 64: 79-83Google Scholar) and embryonic development (29Heyer B.S. Warsowe J. Solter D. Knowles B.B. Ackerman S.L. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 47: 148-156Google Scholar, 30Heyer B.S. Kochanowski H. Solter D. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 215: 344-351Google Scholar). ZPR9 is a 52-kDa protein containing three zinc finger motifs and a physiological substrate of MPK38 kinasein vivo (31Seong H.-A. Gil M. Kim K.-T. Kim S.-J. Ha H. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 597-604Google Scholar). Here we show that ZPR9 binds to B-MYB in vivo and that the overexpression of ZPR9 induces apoptosis, instead of neural differentiation, in the neuroblastoma cells treated with retinoic acid. Binding of ZPR9 to B-MYB can stimulate the B-MYBtranscriptional activity. In addition, we provide evidence that all three functional domains of B-MYB physically interact with ZPR9 in vivo. We also demonstrate that the coexpression ofZPR9 with B-MYB causes the accumulation of both ZPR9 and B-MYB in the nucleus. The eukaryotic glutathioneS-transferase (GST) expression vector (pEBG) and pFLAG-CMV-2 vector with a FLAG epitope were obtained as described previously (32Kim T. Jung H. Min S. Kim K.-T. Ha H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 363-368Google Scholar). The anti-GST antibody was as described (32Kim T. Jung H. Min S. Kim K.-T. Ha H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 363-368Google Scholar). The pT81luc 3xA reporter plasmid (33Ness S.A. Marknell A. Graf T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1115-1125Google Scholar), containing three copies of the “A box” Myb-binding sites from the nim promoter, was a kind gift from Dr. Scott A. Ness (the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM). The expression vector pCEV27 was kindly provided by Dr. d-Y. Shin (Danguk University, Chonan, Korea). The anti-FLAG (M2) antibody, all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), BisBenzimide (H 33258), isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, dithiothreitol, aprotinin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were purchased from Sigma. Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was obtained from Millipore Corp. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The human B-MYB antibody (C-20) raised against the carboxyl terminus was used for immunoprecipitation and Western analysis (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Oligonucleotides were synthesized from Bioneer Corp. (Cheongwon, Chungbuk, Korea). The human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-BE (2Golay J. Capucci A. Arsura M. Castellano M. Rizzo V. Introna M. Blood. 1991; 77: 149-158Google Scholar)C and 293T cells, a derivative of human kidney embryonal fibroblast containing SV40 T antigen, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 1 mm glutamine as described (34Jung H. Kim T. Chae H.Z. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15504-15510Google Scholar). For cell differentiation experiments, SK-N-BE (2Golay J. Capucci A. Arsura M. Castellano M. Rizzo V. Introna M. Blood. 1991; 77: 149-158Google Scholar)C cells grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS were plated in 6-well flat-bottomed microplates at a concentration of 4 × 105 cells per well the day before retinoic acid (RA) treatment, and the medium was replaced with fresh medium without FBS, containing 5 μmall-trans-retinoic acid, every 3 days. The 293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (34Jung H. Kim T. Chae H.Z. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15504-15510Google Scholar). The pEBG-B-MYB, an amino-terminally truncated version containing part of the acidic region and a complete conserved region, and pEBG-WT B-MYB,containing a full-length B-MYB cDNA, have been described previously (32Kim T. Jung H. Min S. Kim K.-T. Ha H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 363-368Google Scholar). The deletion constructs, pEBG-B-MYB R1 and pEBG-B-MYB R2, were generated by PCR as described (32Kim T. Jung H. Min S. Kim K.-T. Ha H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 363-368Google Scholar). To generate two deletion constructs, pFLAG-DBD and pEBG-TA, we performed a PCR using the full-length B-MYB cDNA as the template. The forward primers for DBD (5′-GCGAATTCATGTCTCGGCGG-3′) and TA (5′-GCAAGCTTGAGGACAAGGAC-3′) contain anEcoRI and a HindIII site (underlined). The reverse primers for DBD (5′-GCGGATCCCTCGAGCTCCAG-3′) and TA (5′-GCGGATCCCAGGCGGTACTC-3′) contain a BamHI site (underlined). The amplified PCR products for deletion mutants were cut with EcoRI plus BamHI and HindIII plus BamHI and cloned into pBluescript KS (Stratagene) to generate the KS-DBD and KS-TA constructs, respectively. The pFLAG-DBD was generated after subcloning of an EcoRI/BamHI fragment of KS-DBD into the EcoRI/BamHI site of pFLAG-CMV-2. The pEBG-TA was generated by subcloning of aClaI/NotI fragment from KS-TA into pEBG vector. The identity of all PCR products was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing analysis on both strands with the T7 SequencingTM kit (Amersham Biosciences). The pEBG-CR, a carboxyl-terminally truncated version containing a DNA-binding domain, a transactivation domain, and a complete conserved region, was made by PCR amplification. The amplified PCR product was cut with HindIII plusBamHI and cloned into pBluescript KS to generate the KS-CR construct. The pEBG-CR was created by subcloning of aClaI/NotI fragment from KS-CR into pEBG vector. The pEBG-TA1, a carboxyl-terminally truncated version containing part of the transactivation domain and a complete DNA-binding domain, was constructed in several steps. We first cloned theHindIII/EcoRI fragment of full-length B-MYB into pBluescript KS and digested with ClaI plus NotI and subcloned into pEBG, yielding pEBG-TA1. A full-length ZPR9 cDNA obtained from a human normal keratinocyte cDNA library was cloned into pEBG and pFLAG-CMV-2 to generate the pEBG-ZPR9 and pFLAG-ZPR9, respectively (31Seong H.-A. Gil M. Kim K.-T. Kim S.-J. Ha H. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 597-604Google Scholar). The pCEV27-ZPR9 for expression of humanZPR9 was prepared by subcloning of aBamHI/XhoI fragment from pBacPAK9-ZPR9into pCEV27 vector. The pBacPAK9-ZPR9 was generated by subcloning of an EcoRI/XbaI fragment from pFLAG-ZPR9 into pBacPAK9 (Clontech). For a confocal microscopy, the GFP-B-MYB was created by subcloning of a KpnI/BamHI fragment from KS-B-MYB into pRSGFP-C1 vector (Clontech). A fish plasmid, pJG4-5 harboring a carboxyl-terminal conserved region of B-MYB, was transformed back into EGY48 cells along with either the bait plasmid, pEG202 harboring ZPR9, or other several bait plasmids available in our laboratory (32Kim T. Jung H. Min S. Kim K.-T. Ha H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 363-368Google Scholar). For selection of proteins interacting with the B-MYB, the plate assays of β-galactosidase expression were carried out. 293T cells grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS were plated in 6-well flat-bottomed microplates at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells per well the day before transfection. 1–5 μg of each plasmid DNA was transfected into 293T cells with a calcium phosphate precipitation method. Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and solubilized with 100 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mm EDTA, 0.1m KCl, and 0.3 m NaCl) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mmsodium fluoride, 2 μg/ml α1-antitrypsin, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Detergent-insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Approximately 80 μl of the cleared lysates were mixed with 15 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were probed with an anti-FLAG (M2) antibody and then developed using an ECL detection system (AmershamBiosciences). 293T cells were transfected according to the calcium phosphate precipitation method. After 48 h, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was monitored with a luciferase assay kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Light emission was determined with a Berthold luminometer (Microlumat LB96P). The cell extracts containing equal amounts of B-MYB and ZPR9, determined by Western blot analysis, were used for luciferase assay. The values were adjusted with respect to expression levels of a cotransfected β-galactosidase reporter control, and experiments were repeated at least three times. Total cytoplasmic RNAs were prepared from cells using RNAzolTM B (Biotex Laboratories) as described (28Gil M. Yang Y. Ha H. Immunol. Lett. 1998; 64: 79-83Google Scholar). Approximately 30 μg/ml total RNA was electrophoresed through 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to GeneScreen PlusTM nylon membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membranes were hybridized with a 32P-labeledZPR9 cDNA probe at 42 °C overnight in 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 7% SDS, 0.25 m NaHPO4, 0.25 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The membranes were washed to a final stringency of 0.25× SSC and 0.2% SDS at 55–60 °C for 20–30 min. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was used as an internal control. Cells undergoing apoptosis were quantitated by staining with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V and the fluorescent dye propidium iodide according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The RA-treated cells of 6-cm dishes were harvested and incubated for 10 min at room temperature in annexin V- and propidium iodide-containing buffer and then washed with PBS. 10,000 events were analyzed per sample using a FACSCalibur-S system (BD Biosciences). 293T and SK-N-BE (2Golay J. Capucci A. Arsura M. Castellano M. Rizzo V. Introna M. Blood. 1991; 77: 149-158Google Scholar)C cells grown in sterile coverslips were transfected with pEGFP, an expression vector encoding GFP, together with expression vectors encoding the indicated proteins. In 293T cells, after 24 h of transfection, the cells were treated with TNF-α (20 ng/ml) and cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) for 14 h. In SK-N-BE (2Golay J. Capucci A. Arsura M. Castellano M. Rizzo V. Introna M. Blood. 1991; 77: 149-158Google Scholar)C cells, after 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium without FBS, containing 5 μm RA, and the cells were further incubated for 2–3 days. Stimulations were terminated by aspirating the culture medium and fixing cells with ice-cold 100% methanol for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with PBS and then stained with a BisBenzimide (H 33258) in PBS. The coverslips were washed two times with PBS, then mounted on glass slides, using Gelvatol, and visualized under a fluorescence microscope. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated as the number of GFP-positive cells with apoptotic nuclei divided by the total number of GFP-positive cells. 293T cells were grown on sterile coverslips and transfected with GFP-B-MYB and/or FLAG-tagged ZPR9 constructs by the calcium phosphate precipitation method, placed on ice, and washed three times with ice-cold PBS prior to fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. The mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2) antibody was applied for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were then incubated with Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (AmershamBiosciences) at 37 °C for 1 h as described (31Seong H.-A. Gil M. Kim K.-T. Kim S.-J. Ha H. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 597-604Google Scholar). The coverslips were washed three times with PBS and then mounted on glass slides, using Gelvatol. Confocal laser scanning microscopy observations were done on a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 (15-milliwatt argon-krypton laser; mounted on a Zeiss Axioskop (Jena, Germany) equipped with a ×63 (NA 140) oil-immersion objective, using a 488- (GFP) and 568-nm (Texas Red) bandpass filter). We have identified recently that B-MYB proteins associate in vivo with each other (32Kim T. Jung H. Min S. Kim K.-T. Ha H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 363-368Google Scholar). In an effort to identify further proteins that interact with B-MYB, we used a two-hybrid specificity test technique that was usually employed to verify the interaction specificity between bait and the cDNA-encoded proteins and to eliminate quickly the majority of false positives detected in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Specific interacting proteins confer the galactose-dependent Leu+/LacZ+phenotype to yeast containing the related baits but not to yeast containing unrelated baits. To test this, the B-MYB library plasmid was rescued from the galactose-dependent Leu+/LacZ+ yeast and re-introduced into theZPR9 bait strain as well as the other strains containing approximately 20 different baits available in our laboratory. From this random screening, B-MYB cDNA was found to interact with the total seven baits tested (results not shown), includingZPR9 and B-MYB baits, suggesting that ZPR9, like B-MYB (32Kim T. Jung H. Min S. Kim K.-T. Ha H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 363-368Google Scholar), can interact with B-MYB physically in mammalian cells. To determine whether B-MYB and ZPR9 interact in vivo, we performed cotransfection experiments using GST- and FLAG-tagged eukaryotic expression vectors. In these experiments, theZPR9 and wild-type B-MYB were coexpressed as a GST fusion protein and a FLAG-tagged protein in 293T cells, respectively. The interactions of FLAG-tagged B-MYB proteins to the GST-ZPR9 fusion proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig.1 A, the B-MYB was detected in the coprecipitate only when coexpressed with the GST-ZPR9but not with the control GST alone, demonstrating that B-MYB physically interacts with ZPR9 in vivo. In order to verify further the interaction of B-MYB with ZPR9 in vivo, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments using 293T cells transiently transfected with the vector alone or FLAG-tagged ZPR9 (Fig.1 B). Endogenous B-MYB was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and Western blot analysis shows that B-MYB was precipitated (Fig. 1 B, lower panel). The binding of ZPR9 was subsequently analyzed using Western blotting with an anti-FLAG antibody, and as shown in Fig. 1 B (upper left panel), ZPR9 was present in the B-MYB immunoprecipitate. In conclusion, our results clearly demonstrate that B-MYB associates with ZPR9 in vivo. Recently, together with other data (22Oelgeschlager M. Janknecht R. Krieg J. Schreek S. Luscher B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2771-2780Google Scholar, 23Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Hou D.X. Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Takahashi T. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 528-540Google Scholar), it was reported that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase binds to the B-MYBDNA-binding domain and enhances the transcriptional activity of B-MYB (21Cervellera M.N. Sala A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10692-10696Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that ZPR9 might interact with the DNA-binding or transactivation domain of B-MYB, in addition to the carboxyl-terminal conserved region, and cause the modulation of B-MYB transactivation. To determine which regions of B-MYB were required for binding of ZPR9 in vivo, we generated nine deletion constructs fused to GST (Fig. 2,A and B). The GST-WT B-MYB, GST-CR, GST-B-MYB, GST-TA1, GST-B-MYB R1, GST-TA, and GST-B-MYB R2 constructs were expressed in 293T cells (Fig.2, C and D, middle left panels) and used for the in vivo binding assay with ZPR9 andTwo9, a partial clone of ZPR9 comprising amino acids 206–452 (31Seong H.-A. Gil M. Kim K.-T. Kim S.-J. Ha H. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 597-604Google Scholar). The binding of the FLAG-tagged ZPR9 andTwo9 with all six constructs tested, except for GST-B-MYB R2, was readily detectable (Fig. 2, Cand D, top left panels). These results suggest that all three functional domains of B-MYB, a DNA-binding domain, a transactivation domain, and the carboxyl-terminal conserved region, are responsible for ZPR9 binding in vivo. To narrow down further the binding motif, we generated a DBD deletion construct (amino acids 1–206) and carried out a similar experiment. As a result, the FLAG-tagged DBD was coprecipitated with GST-tagged ZPR9(or Two9) but not with GST alone (Fig. 2, C andD, top right panels). These findings, together with the binding of ZPR9 to GST-TA, clearly indicate that both DNA-binding and transactivation domains are required for ZPR9 binding. However, the GST-B-MYB R2 was not coprecipitated with FLAG-tagged ZPR9 or Two9, indicating that the conserved region is only required for ZPR9 binding within the carboxyl-terminal domain of B-MYB. Taken together, these results suggest that each functional domain of B-MYB is sufficient for its association with ZPR9. Because ZPR9 is binding to the DNA-binding and transactivation domain of B-MYB (Fig. 2), it is likely that the interaction may affect the transactivation by B-MYB. To investigate the functional significance of binding of ZPR9 to B-MYB, we cotransfected the pT81luc 3xA reporter plasmid, containing three Myb-binding sites from the chicken mim-1 gene (33Ness S.A. Marknell A. Graf T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1115-1125Google Scholar), with mammalian expression vectors encoding for ZPR9 and B-MYB. As shown in Fig.3 A, the addition of ZPR9 to B-MYB led to a significant enhancement of B-MYBtranscriptional activity. To investigate further whether the expression of ZPR9 protein levels could influence the B-MYBtransactivation, a dose dependence experiment by increasing theZPR9 expression plasmid was performed. As shown in Fig.3 B, the stimulatory effect of ZPR9 in the B-MYBtransactivation increased in a dose-dependent manner. However, the transfection of ZPR9 alone, as a control, did not influence a significant change in the basal transcription. These findings strongly suggest that ZPR9 is a potential coactivator of B-MYB. Because, in addition to the ZPR9 binding to the DNA-binding and transactivation domain of B-MYB, as shown in Fig. 3, coexpression ofZPR9 and B-MYB resulted in synergistic activation of the B-MYB-responsive promoter, pT81luc 3xA reporter, it is likely that ZPR9 could modify B-MYB movement. To address this point, 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged ZPR9 alone or together with GFP-B-MYB. Cells expressing B-MYBand ZPR9 exhibit both cytosolic and nuclear staining, but the coexpression of ZPR9 with B-MYB resulted in nuclear localization of the B-MYB protein, as well as the ZPR9, with an average increase of 2.8- and 3.8-fold in the four experiments, respectively, when the percentage of the nuclear localization of B-MYB and ZPR9 was calculated as the number of GFP- (for B-MYB) and Texas Red-positive (for ZPR9) cells with nuclear staining divided by the total number of GFP- and Texas Red-positive cells (Fig.4). These data show that ZPR9 is able to cooperate with B-MYB for the transactivation by B-MYB. To analyze the effect ofZPR9 gene expression on the differentiable or apoptotic potential of SK-N-BE (2Golay J. Capucci A. Arsura M. Castellano M. Rizzo V. Introna M. Blood. 1991; 77: 149-158Google Scholar)C, a human neuroblastoma cell line, we constructed an expression vector pCEV27-ZPR9, where a full-length human ZPR9 cDNA was placed under the control of Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat promoter.ZPR9-transfected SK-N-BE (2Golay J. Capucci A. Arsura M. Castellano M. Rizzo V. Introna M. Blood. 1991; 77: 149-158Google Scholar)C cells were selected in medium containing G418 (800 μg/ml). Overexpression of the ZPR9transcript in the selected transfectants was analyzed by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5 A, compared with parental SK-N-BE (2Golay J. Capucci A. Arsura M. Castellano M. Rizzo V. Introna M. Blood. 1991; 77: 149-158Google Scholar)C cells and pCEV27 vector transfectants, as negative controls, the ZPR9 transcripts were identified at a high level in the selected ZPR9transfected clones. In addition, similar results were obtained with all selected ZPR9 transfectant clones (results not shown). The growth rates under normal serum conditions were comparable inZPR9 transfectants, pCEV27 vector transfectants, and parental SK-N-BE (2Golay J. Capucci A. Arsura M. Castellano M. Rizzo V. Introna M. Blood. 1991; 77: 149-158Google Scholar)C cells, suggesting that the ectopic expression ofZPR9 did not affect the proliferative activity on neuroblastoma cells (results not shown). RA treatment resulted in a more rapid loss of viability in all ZPR9-expressing clones compared with the parental SK-N-BE (2Golay J. Capucci A. Arsura M. Castellano M. Rizzo V. Introna M. Blood. 1991; 77: 149-158Google Scholar)C cells and the cell lines transfected with the pCEV27 vector (Fig. 5 B). To confirm if the marked decrease in cellular viability of the RA-treatedZPR9 transfectants is due to apoptosis, we performed dual annexin V/propidium iodide staining as described under “Experimental Procedures” and obtained an experimental result similar to those in Fig. 5 B. A significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells was observed in the ZPR9 transfectants after RA treatment, suggesting that the overexpression of ZPR9 may induce apoptosis, instead of the neural differentiation, in the presence of RA (Fig. 5 C). To investigate further the physiological roles of ZPR9 during apoptosis, 293T cells were transiently transfected with GFP alone, GFP and ZPR9, and GFP and B-MYB. In addition, cells were cotransfected withZPR9 and B-MYB, together with GFP. After inducing apoptosis by TNF-α treatment, apoptotic cells were scored by a change in nuclear morphology among GFP-positive cells. As shown in Fig.5 D, ∼59% of 293T cells expressing ZPR9 were apoptotic following TNF-α treatment. In contrast, ∼16% of cells transfected with B-MYB underwent TNF-α-induced apoptosis, similar to the percentage (about 15%) of control apoptotic cells expressing GFP alone. On the other hand, B-MYB coexpression markedly inhibited the apoptotic stimulation induced by ZPR9 (about 35% inhibition). To confirm further the involvement of ZPR9 in the enhancement of RA-induced apoptosis, we carried out a similar transient transfection experiment using SK-N-BE (2Golay J. Capucci A. Arsura M. Castellano M. Rizzo V. Introna M. Blood. 1991; 77: 149-158Google Scholar)C cells. As shown in Fig. 5 E, the results obtained in this experiment were very similar to those in Fig. 5 D. These findings suggest that the overexpression ofZPR9 is sufficient to stimulate apoptosis induced by various stimuli and raise the possibility that ZPR9 may be a potential pro-apoptotic protein. In this report, we demonstrate that ZPR9 interacts with B-MYBin vivo and that each functional domain of B-MYBis necessary and sufficient to mediate direct protein-protein interactions with ZPR9. We found that ZPR9 enhanced the transactivating activity of B-MYB by direct interaction. Furthermore, we show that B-MYB moves to the nucleus following the coexpression of ZPR9, implying that ZPR9 may behave as an activator of the bound transcription factor, B-MYB. The novel zinc finger protein, termed ZPR9 (zinc finger-like protein 9), was originally discovered as a protein partner for the MPK38 serine/threonine kinase (31Seong H.-A. Gil M. Kim K.-T. Kim S.-J. Ha H. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 597-604Google Scholar). Recently, evidence has emerged that several zinc finger proteins such as ZPR1, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor, CD40 receptor-associated factor, enigma, and LMP-associated protein act as modulators for receptor signaling, and that the formation of multiprotein complexes in many transcription factors results in an increased diversity and specificity in the regulation of gene expression (35Galcheva-Gargova Z. Konstantinov K.N. Wu I.H. Klier F.G. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Science. 1996; 272: 1797-1802Google Scholar, 36Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Google Scholar, 37Hu H.M.

Zinc finger motifs of the Cys2-His2 type have been found in numerous transcription factors, including ZPR9. In this respect, the self-association of ZPR9 containing zinc finger motifs and the interaction of ZPR9 with the kinase catalytic domain of MPK38 provide an interesting aspect to the regulation of this factor (31Seong H.-A. Gil M. Kim K.-T. Kim S.-J. Ha H. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 597-604Google Scholar). In addition, our recent study strongly suggests a possible role for phosphorylation of ZPR9 proteins in their translocation to the nucleus (31Seong H.-A. Gil M. Kim K.-T. Kim S.-J. Ha H. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 597-604Google Scholar). Thus, these data open a new area of investigation on the potential interaction of ZPR9 with other cellular proteins. Several lines of evidence indicate that the DNA-binding domain of MYB proteins has the potential of mediating contact with both DNA and proteins. It has been shown that PARP binds to the DNA-binding domain of B-MYB and enhances its transactivating activity and that the physical interaction between PARP and B-MYB is critical for the coactivating function (21Cervellera M.N. Sala A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10692-10696Google Scholar), suggesting an important role for the direct interaction in the regulation of the B-MYBtranscriptional activity. Recently, we have shown that B-MYB interactsin vivo with each other via the carboxyl-terminal conserved region (32Kim T. Jung H. Min S. Kim K.-T. Ha H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 363-368Google Scholar). In addition, we have observed that the conserved region of B-MYB binds to several cellular proteins as well as ZPR9 in the yeast two-hybrid tests and in vivo binding assays (results not shown). This evidence led us to investigate whether ZPR9, a potential transcription factor containing zinc finger motifs, participates in the B-MYB-mediated transactivation. As shown in Fig. 3, a significant increase was observed in the transactivating activity of B-MYB by direct binding of ZPR9, suggesting that the in vivo association of B-MYB and ZPR9 plays a pivotal role in the modulation of B-MYB transcriptional activity. Based on this result, we imagine that rather than direct interaction with the carboxyl-terminal conserved region, the conformational change mediated through the DNA-binding or transactivation domain of B-MYB by direct binding of ZPR9 likely plays a role that is important in the regulation of B-MYB transcriptional activity. For activation of B-MYB transcriptional activity, our results, together with existing data (21Cervellera M.N. Sala A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10692-10696Google Scholar, 22Oelgeschlager M. Janknecht R. Krieg J. Schreek S. Luscher B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2771-2780Google Scholar, 23Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Hou D.X. Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Takahashi T. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 528-540Google Scholar), suggest a distinct mechanism in which, in addition to the truncation of the carboxyl terminus of B-MYB and the phosphorylation by cyclin A-CDK2 complex (7Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2679-2689Google Scholar, 8Sala A. Kundu M. Casella I. Engelhard A. Calabretta B. Grasso L. Paggi M.G. Giordano A. Watson R.J. Khalili K. Peschle C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Biol. 1997; 7: 253-260Google Scholar), cellular cofactors are bound to the B-MYB, for example through the binding of PARP and ZPR9, resulting in the enhancement of the B-MYB transcriptional activity (21Cervellera M.N. Sala A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10692-10696Google Scholar, 31Seong H.-A. Gil M. Kim K.-T. Kim S.-J. Ha H. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 597-604Google Scholar). Recent studies (41Melino G. Draoui M. Bellincampi L. Bernassola F. Bernardini S. Piacentini M. Reichert U. Cohen P. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 55-61Google Scholar) showed that all-trans-retinoic acid reduces human neuroblastoma growth by inducing either differentiation or apoptosis. To determine whether RA-treated ZPR9 stable transfectants can influence the differentiation or apoptosis in human neuroblastoma cells, the morphological and apoptotic analysis ofZPR9 transfectants was performed in addition to the examination of the number of viable cells (Fig. 5 and results not shown). The ZPR9 transfectants undergo apoptosis rather than differentiation after RA treatment, suggesting that ZPR9 may be one of the regulators controlling cellular growth arrest induced by RA in neuroblastoma cells. To test whether the observed apoptotic cell death after RA treatment in the ZPR9 stable transfectants is a consequence of direct interaction of B-MYB with ZPR9, we performed two separate transient transfection experiments using 293T and SK-N-BE (2Golay J. Capucci A. Arsura M. Castellano M. Rizzo V. Introna M. Blood. 1991; 77: 149-158Google Scholar)C cells in the presence of TNF-α and RA, respectively (Fig. 5,D and E). In these experiments, coexpression of B-MYB significantly inhibited rather than stimulated TNF-α and RA-induced apoptosis enhanced by ZPR9. In contrast, the percentage of apoptosis in cells transfected with B-MYB alone was similar to the percentage of control apoptotic cells expressing GFP alone in both 293T and SK-N-BE (2Golay J. Capucci A. Arsura M. Castellano M. Rizzo V. Introna M. Blood. 1991; 77: 149-158Google Scholar)C cells. Thus, it is tempting to suggest that the apoptotic cell death in RA-treated ZPR9stable transfectants may be derived from the overexpression ofZPR9 itself, not through binding with B-MYB. On the other hand, one may raise the argument that ZPR9, like other zinc finger proteins, could be nuclear for its effect on target genes. Based on this, one possible explanation for ZPR9-induced apoptosis is that a subcellular location of ZPR9 may contribute to its apoptotic function in the presence of retinoic acid because a markedly increased nuclear accumulation of ZPR9, compared with the untreated control cells, was observed when the cells transfected with ZPR9 were treated with RA (results not shown). Additionally, it is not clear that the repression of ZPR9-induced apoptosis by B-MYB is dependent on the direct interaction of B-MYB with ZPR9 because B-MYB thought to mediate the anti-apoptotic functions is also involved in interactions with other cellular proteins that may compete with ZPR9 for binding (see Refs. 21Cervellera M.N. Sala A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10692-10696Google Scholar and 32Kim T. Jung H. Min S. Kim K.-T. Ha H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 363-368Google Scholar and results not shown). The biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying the pro-apoptotic properties of ZPR9 are unknown at present. However, it seems that the most likely mechanism by which ZPR9 may accelerate apoptosis would be through the modulation of the potential cellular targets for ZPR9. In this context, future studies aimed at identifying cellular physiological targets for ZPR9 will be necessary to elucidate the exact mechanism through which ZPR9 can induce apoptotic cell death. In addition, ZPR9 proteins, like PARP (21Cervellera M.N. Sala A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10692-10696Google Scholar), are nuclear and enhance B-MYB transactivation. In this regard, it will be of further interest to determine the mechanistic interaction between B-MYB and ZPR9 to gain more insight into the role of ZPR9 in the B-MYBtransactivation. Moreover, because B-MYB is thought to have a general role in cell growth control, differentiation, and cancer, the ZPR9-dependent modulation of this transcription factor may contribute to elucidate the mechanism by which B-MYB affects these processes as well as the mechanism of transcription activation by B-MYB.

Linezolid, an oxazolidinone, is approved for treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics. Emerging resistance to all known drugs, including the “last resort” vancomycin family, poses a serious threat to the public health worldwide. Understanding the mechanism of action of oxazolidinones at the molecular level, therefore, has a great importance for the development of the next generation of these novel antibiotics and, ultimately, for the outcome of the ongoing battle against drug-resistant pathogens. Oxazolidinones impose their action at the initiation stage of translation (4Slee A.M. Wuonola M.A. McRipley R.J. Zajac I. Zavada M.J. Bartholomew P.T. Gregory W.A. Forbes M. Antimicrob.

To address this and other mechanistic questions, we have studied catalytic properties of oxazolidinone-resistant ribosomes and compared the mechanism of oxazolidinone inhibition with the action of known peptidyltransferase inhibitors, such as chloramphenicol and sparsomycin. To further define the oxazolidinone binding site, we have mapped resistant mutations onto the three-dimensional structure of the ribosomal 50 S subunit to reveal an inhibitor binding pocket and docked an oxazolidinone inhibitor therein to show its fitness.

Reactions were incubated at room temperature for various time periods. 10 μl of 5 n KOH was added to stop the reaction, and the quenched reactions were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C followed by the addition of 600 μl of 1 mNaHPO4 (pH 7.0) and 250 ml of ethyl acetate. The product [35S]formyl-methionyl-puromycin was extracted into the ethyl acetate phase by shaking for 15 min and centrifugation for 5 min. 80 μl of the ethyl acetate phase was mixed with 125 μl of Microscint-40 to the organic phase and counted in a Packard Topcount-NTXTM (Packard Instrument Co.). Reactions were performed at room temperature and contained the following components in a 60-μl volume: 36.7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4 at 23 °C), 10 mm MgCl2, 266.7 mm KCl, 0.15 μm of E. coli MRE600 70 S ribosomes, various concentrations of CCA-Phe-X-Biotin, 50 μm[3H]puromycin (0.5 Ci/mmol), 33.3% MeOH, and 0.0083% Me2SO. The reaction mixtures were stopped by addition of 0.5 volume of 7 m guanidine-HCl with 20 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) at different incubation time points. The quenched reactions were then transferred to a SAM96Biotin capture plate prewetted with 2 m NaCl. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, free [3H]puromycin was removed by filtration and subsequent washes with 2 m NaCl. The bound Biotin-phe-[3H]puromycin was measured using a Packard Topcount-NTXTM by adding 15 μl of Microscint-20. Assuming that the ribosomal peptidyltransferase has an ordered mechanism of action (12Green R. Switzer C. Noller H.F. Science. 1998; 280: 286-289Google Scholar), in which the P-site substrate, A, and the A-site substrate, B, associate with the ribosome, E, in an obligate order: the A-site substrate can only bind to the preformed P-substrate-ribosome complex, as shown in Reaction 1, REACTION1the corresponding velocity equation would be given by Equation1. VoVmax=[A][B]KAKB1+[A]KA+[A][B]KAKBEquation 1 Determination of apparent V max andK m parameters for fMet-tRNA iMet was performed under the pseudo first-order reaction conditions, in which a fixed saturating concentration of puromycin (200 μm) with 70 S ribosomes at 0.005 μm has been used, and fMet-tRNA iMet concentration was varied from 0.04 to 0.8 μm, depending on the mutant studied. To obtain corresponding puromycin K m values (K B), a fixed saturating concentration of 0.8 μm fMet-tRNA iMet was used for the wild type and all three mutants, whereas the puromycin concentration was varied from 5 to 400 μm. Time courses at each set of conditions were performed, and initial rates were determined by linear regression analysis of steady-state kinetics. To determine K i values in the puromycin and fragment reactions, initial rates of the reaction in the presence of different concentrations of inhibitors were evaluated by quantifying product at a single time point (1Patel U. Yan Y.P. Kaczmarczyk J. Hobbs Jr., F.W. Slee A.M. Pompliano D.L. Kurilla M.G. Bobkova E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37199-37205Google Scholar). Incubation times for wild type and different mutants have been selected based on linearity of time courses for different peptidyltransferases. The puromycin reaction was performed using 50 μm puromycin, 0.2 μmfMet-tRNA iMet, and 0.012 μm 70 S ribosomes. The fragment reaction contained 0.24 μm 70 S ribosomes, 6 μm CCA-Phe-X-Biotin fragment, and 50 μm puromycin (0.5 Ci/mmol). Incubation times for fragment reaction experiments were selected based on linearity of the corresponding time courses. KaleidaGraph software was used both for IC50 curves plotting, linear regression and non-linear regression analysis of the data. K i values were derived by fitting the [S] − V data into the corresponding rate equations. For sparsomycin, a competitive inhibitor of A-site (13Pestka S. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Based on these results, it was assumed that chloramphenicol is a competitive inhibitor with respect to both sites, and the data were fitted to the same equation (3Bobkova E.V. Yan Y.P. Patel U.

Mutated nucleotides as well as A- and P-loop regions have been mapped onto the 50 S crystal structure using WebLab ViewerLite 3.5 software. Oxazolidinone cross-linking positions reported by Matassova et al. (22Matassova N.B. Rodnina M.V. Endermann R. Kroll H.-P. Pleiss U. Wild H. Wintermeyer W. RNA (N.

Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Google Scholar); thus, the docking procedure was predominantly based on steric considerations as well as on mutant inhibition data. The oxazolidinone inhibitor XA043 was modeled into a potential binding pocket on the ribosome using the x-ray coordinates with Protein Data Bank entry code1FFK and Sybyl molecular modeling software. The inhibitor was built and minimized in the gas phase before manually docking it into the pocket near residues where oxazolidinone-resistant mutations occur and the active site K+ resides. K m and V maxvalues for both A- and P-site substrates in the puromycin reaction for the drug-resistant 23 S RNA mutants were determined and compared with the wild type ribosomes. For mutant G2447A (position 2482 in H. marismortui), significant changes in both K mand V max values are observed for both substrates (Fig. 1, A and B). The values of K m for initiator tRNA and puromycin were increased by 5- and 2-fold, respectively, andV max decreased 100-fold (TableI). Erythromycin-resistant mutant A2058G (2099 in H. marismortui), which is weakly resistant to oxazolidinones in vivo (2Mills J.A. Kaczmarczyk J. Liu V.G. Kurilla M.G. Slee A.M. The Ribosome, Structure, Function, Antibiotics, and Cellular Interactions. Helsingor Conference, Denmark1999: 20Google Scholar, 33Thompson J. O'Connor M. Mills J.A. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 273-279Google Scholar), exhibited a 3-fold increase in K m value for initiator tRNA with no change for that of puromycin. Oxazolidinone- and chloramphenicol-resistant and erythromycin-hypersensitive mutant G2032A (2973) has K m and V max values that are similar to the wild type. Thus, two of the three studied oxazolidinone-resistant mutants (G2447A and A2058G) had decreased affinity for the initiator tRNA (P-site) substrate with none of the mutations affecting the interaction with the A-site substrate puromycin.Table ICatalytic properties of mutant peptidyltransferases in puromycin reaction23 S mutantInitiator tRNA (P-site)Puromycin (A-site)K mK m ratio mutant/WT1-aWT, wild type.V max ratio Mutant/WT1-aWT, wild type.V max/K mratio mutant/WT1-aWT, wild type.K mμmμmWild type0.054 ± 0.0051.001.001.0016.9G2032A0.062 ± 0.0031.16 ± 0.060.62 ± 0.050.54 ± 0.0120.9A2058G0.180 ± 0.0593.41 ± 1.460.19 ± 0.040.06 ± 0.0112.7G2447A0.247 ± 0.1094.57 ± 1.650.01 ± 0.020.0235.11-a WT, wild type. Open table in a new tab To define the oxazolidinone binding site, we studied inhibition of oxazolidinone-resistant mutants in two different substrate systems: in the puromycin reaction that employs initiator fMet-tRNA iMet as a P-site substrate and puromycin as an A-site substrate and in the fragment reaction where the truncated version of the P-site substrate, CCA-Phe-Biotin, is utilized, whereas the A-site substrate, puromycin, is the same as in the first system. To compare inhibitory properties of oxazolidinones with those of known peptidyltransferase inhibitors, chloramphenicol and sparsomycin, we determined corresponding IC50 values in both puromycin and fragment reactions performed by mutant ribosomes. Inhibition profiles of mutant peptidyltransferases in the puromycin reaction with the oxazolidinones, XA043 and linezolid, are shown in Fig. 2, A and B, respectively. As expected based on their high levels of resistancein vivo (2Mills J.A. Kaczmarczyk J. Liu V.G. Kurilla M.G. Slee A.M. The Ribosome, Structure, Function, Antibiotics, and Cellular Interactions. Helsingor Conference, Denmark1999: 20Google Scholar, 33Thompson J. O'Connor M. Mills J.A. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 273-279Google Scholar), oxazolidinone-resistant mutants G2447A and G2032A are not inhibited by oxazolidinones in vitro. The effect of chloramphenicol on peptidyltransferase mutants is shown in Fig. 2 C. Oxazolidinone-resistant mutant G2447A is not inhibited by chloramphenicol either, although it is highly sensitive to the A-site inhibitor sparsomycin. In contrast, oxazolidinone-resistant mutant G2032A shows rather a moderate in vitro resistance against chloramphenicol, indicated by less than 4-fold decrease in affinity for this inhibitor. Inhibition of mutant peptidyltransferases with the A-site inhibitor sparsomycin is shown in Fig. 2 D. An inhibition constant of ∼0.4 μm determined in this work for sparsomycin was in good agreement with theK i value of ∼1 μm reported previously for this antibiotic with a pentamer fragment substrate by Harris and Pestka (34Harris R. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1168-1174Google Scholar). Oxazolidinone-resistant mutants are either more sensitive to inhibition by sparsomycin than the wild type (A2058G and G2447A) or 2-fold less sensitive (G2032A), indicating little cross-resistance. When the fragment P-site substrate was used in place of initiator fMet-tRNA, the cross-resistance to oxazolidinones (Fig.3, A and B) and chloramphenicol (Fig. 3 C) for mutant G2447A remains with a somewhat lower level of resistance to oxazolidinone XA043. It is noteworthy that an opposite effect, a stimulation of the fragment reaction, was observed for this mutant in the presence of linezolid. The effects of inhibitors on the reactions catalyzed by mutant G2032A were affected by which P-site substrate was used: initiator tRNA leads to less inhibition than the truncated P-site substrate. At the same time, mutations had insignificant, less than 2-fold, effect on the magnitude of inhibition with sparsomycin (Fig. 3 D). To compare inhibitors with different mechanisms of action,K i values were calculated (summarized in TableII). Mutants A2058G and G2032A are ∼3–4-fold less sensitive toward linezolid in comparison with XA043. Both of these mutants are less affected by chloramphenicol than wild type. Mutant G2447A was not inhibited by chloramphenicol at all, but its sensitivity to oxazolidinones decreased by more than 100-fold. A weakly resistant to oxazolidinones mutant (A2058G) (2Mills J.A. Kaczmarczyk J. Liu V.G. Kurilla M.G. Slee A.M. The Ribosome, Structure, Function, Antibiotics, and Cellular Interactions. Helsingor Conference, Denmark1999: 20Google Scholar, 33Thompson J. O'Connor M. Mills J.A. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 273-279Google Scholar) is sensitive toward oxazolidinones in a fragment reaction, while displaying a moderate in vitro resistance when whole initiator tRNA was used as a substrate (Figs. 2 and 3, compare A andB, respectively). None of the mutations studied displayed a significant level of resistance to an A-site inhibitor sparsomycin.Table IIKi values for peptidyltransferase inhibitors in puromycin reactionInhibitorK iWild typeA2058GG2032AG2447AμmXA0433.25 ± 0.1911.79 ± 0.9327.1 ± 5.7385.8 ± 94.7Linezolid5.04 ± 1.1743.7 ± 4.2141.8 ± 28.5794.2 ± 184.6Chloramphenicol0.25 ± 0.030.74 ± 0.040.90 ± 0.10No InhibitionSparsomycin0.44 ± 0.050.12 ± 0.010.87 ± 0.080.12 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab Mutational studies of the ribosome by genetic means have been a fruitful approach to investigation of the functional role of the different regions of this remarkable ribozyme (24Hill W.H.

However, the biochemical effects of ribosomal mutations were hindered by an inability to isolate mutant ribosomes free of wild type counterparts because of the presence of multiple copies of both 16 and 23 S RNA in most eubacteria. Development of the single plasmid-encoded rRNA operon system in E. coli (11Asai T. Zaporojets D. Squires C. Squires C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1971-1976Google Scholar) made possible engineering, isolation, and enzymatic characterization of mutant ribosomes in vitro. Steady state experiments using purified drug-resistant ribosomal mutants have yielded meaningful catalytic parameters. These, in turn, have allowed initial structure-function relationships at the peptidyltransferase center to be determined, as well as possible mechanisms of action and resistance to antibiotics at the level of the catalyst itself. We find that 23 S RNA G2032A and G2447A mutations result in decreased affinity for the P-site substrate initiator fMet-tRNA and insensitivity toward oxazolidinones and chloramphenicol. Nucleotide 2447 belongs to the peptidyltransferase region that has been shown to be involved in interactions with the acyl moiety of initiator tRNA (P-site) (27Steiner G. Kuehler E. Barta A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3949-3955Google Scholar, 28Moazed D. Noller H.F. Cell. 1989; 57: 585-597Google Scholar, 29Baranov P.V. Sergiev P.V. Dontsova O.A. Bogdanov A.A. Brimacombe R.

We also demonstrate that the affinity for the A-site substrate is not affected by the mutations that confer resistance to oxazolidinones. According to our inhibition results (Figs. 2 and 3), chloramphenicol, an inhibitor of both P- and A-sites (16Monro R.E. Vazquez D. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 28: 161-165Google Scholar, 17Monro R.E. Celma M.L. Vazquez D. Nature. 1969; 222: 356-358Google Scholar), displays partial cross-resistance with oxazolidinones, whereas a specific inhibitor of the A-site, sparsomycin, does not. Thus, this suggests that oxazolidinones inhibit the methanolic peptidyltransferase reaction primarily via interference with the P-site substrate binding. In addition, we have shown previously that oxazolidinones are competitive with initiator tRNA (P-site substrate) inhibitors (1Patel U. Yan Y.P. Kaczmarczyk J. Hobbs Jr., F.W. Slee A.M. Pompliano D.L. Kurilla M.G. Bobkova E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37199-37205Google Scholar). The accumulated evidence leads us to conclude that oxazolidinones are inhibitors of the peptidyltransferase P-site. Truncation of the P-site substrate did not eliminate in vitro resistance toward oxazolidinones and chloramphenicol. This can be interpreted in terms of the binding site for these drugs being located on the 50 S part of the P-site in a close proximity to the CCA-fMet binding site. We suggest that mutations at positions G2447 and G2032 interfere with the binding of the isoacceptor part of the initiator tRNA and at the same time contribute to formation of the oxazolidinone binding site. Mutant A2058G showed no resistance toward oxazolidinones in the fragment reaction, whereas a moderate decrease in affinity for oxazolidinone linezolid was observed in the pulomycin reaction. This can be interpreted in terms of the possible structural changes in the P-site induced by this mutation, in particular in binding of the non-isoacceptor portion of the initiator tRNA. A remarkable observation that a catalysis of the fragment reaction by mutant G2447A is stimulated in the presence of linezolid, but inhibited by XA043, suggests that inhibition with oxazolidinones might occur via conformational change in the mutant active center that distorts the substrate(s) binding site, leading to a dichotomous outcome depending on the structure of the inhibitory molecule bound. To further define the oxazolidinone binding site, mutations that lead to oxazolidinone resistance (2Mills J.A. Kaczmarczyk J. Liu V.G. Kurilla M.G. Slee A.M.

O'Connor M. Mills J.A. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 273-279Google Scholar) were mapped onto the crystal structure (23Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Google Scholar) of the peptidyltransferase 50 S subunit (Fig.4). Although the mutated nucleotides are relatively dispersed in the primary structure of 23 S rRNA, these mutations map into a confined space between the P- and A-loops in the three-dimensional structure, which partially overlaps with the P-site. As seen in Fig. 4 A, the mutations are clustered near the central channel of the ribosome that permits substrate entry to the P-site. There is a cavity of sufficient size to accept the inhibitor XA043 as shown in Fig. 4 C, which contains a potassium ion that might be required for catalytic activity (30Nissen P. Hansen J. Ban N. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 920-930Google Scholar). Little reorganization of the nucleotide residues is necessary for inhibitor access to the binding site. Although the binding site model is preliminary and cannot predict the exact conformations of the binding pocket and the inhibitor, especially in light of potential structural differences between archaeal and eubacterial ribosomes, the model offers an explanation of the inhibitory action against P-site activity by oxazolidinones. The functional role of the nucleotide G2447 is of a particular interest due to the ongoing controversy about the mechanism of catalysis by ribosomal peptidyltransferase. The low catalytic efficiency and markedly decreased affinity for the P-site substrate of mutant G2447A suggests an important contribution to the catalysis by this nucleotide. At the same time, it raises questions about the proposed general acid-base mechanism hypothesis (30Nissen P. Hansen J. Ban N. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 920-930Google Scholar, 31Muth G.W. Ortoleva-Donnelly L. Strobel S.A. Science. 2000; 289: 947-950Google Scholar). If nucleotide G2447 plays an important role in the pK a shift of the catalytic residue A2051, one would expect this nucleotide to be essential bothin vivo and in vitro, which has not been observed (3Bobkova E.V. Yan Y.P. Patel U. Mills J.A. Slee A.M. Kurilla A.M. The Ribosome, Structure, Function, Antibiotics, and Cellular Interactions. Helsingor Conference, Denmark1999: 30Google Scholar, 10Thompson J.

Mankin A.S. Nature. 2001; 411: 498-501Google Scholar). Thus, there is a clear need for further mechanistic studies of this essential ribozyme. We conclude that oxazolidinones inhibit binding of the initiator tRNA to the peptidyltransferase P-site on 50 S, preventing the formation of the first peptide bond. One would also predict that clinical resistance to this class of drugs would evolve by introducing mutations that would alter the fine structure of the P-site, as was observed in the case of two oxazolidinone-resistant mutants, selected in the laboratory. One would also predict that frequency of resistance acquired through this target-based mechanism should be quite low due to redundancy of rRNA operons in bacteria. Thus, this key ribozyme, encoded by multiple rDNA genes, presents an excellent drug discovery target for the development of novel antibiotics, the clinical usefulness of which would not be eroded by single point mutations. We are grateful to Dr. Al E. Dahlberg and Dr. Jill Thompson for insightful discussions. We thank Dr. Steve T. Gregory for providing site-directed 23 S RNA mutants and Dr. Jonathan A. Mills for sharing oxazolidinone-resistant mutant strains. We appreciate the help of Utpal Patel with the computer analysis of theK i values."

A model is proposed in which SrnQ of the protein complex senses nickel and subsequently enhances the DNA binding activity of SrnR through the protein-protein interaction. reactive oxygen species superoxide dismutase streptomycin spectinomycin kanamycin apramycin glutathioneS-transferase open reading frame cathechol dioxygenase isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine Aerobic organisms have acquired a specific mechanism to protect themselves from reactive oxygen species (ROS)1 such as superoxide radical (O2⨪) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which can be generated from incomplete reduction of dioxygen during respiration. The ROS may cause oxidative damage to DNA, protein, and lipid (1Storz G. Tartaglia L.A. Farr S.B. Ames B.N. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 363-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The Fenton reaction generating hydroxy radicals by reduction and oxidation of Fe ions in the presence of ROS has been proposed as a mechanism for cell damage (2Cannio R. Fiorentino G. Morana A. Rossi M. Bartolucci S. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: 768-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Major defense system against ROS comprises superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and peroxidase, which concertedly convert the ROS into O2 and H2O (3Ahmad S. Ahmad S. Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant Defenses in Biology. Chapman & Hall, New York, NY1995: 238-272Crossref Google Scholar). The SOD is distinguished into several types according to their active metals (2Cannio R. Fiorentino G. Morana A. Rossi M. Bartolucci S. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: 768-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The SOD containing either manganese (Mn-SOD) or iron (Fe-SOD) has been found in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells. The copper- and zinc-containing SOD (CuZn-SOD) has been described in the periplasm of several bacteria (4Imlay K.R.C. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2564-2571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Steinman H.M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1255-1260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Steinman H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1882-1887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, two novel SODs containing nickel (Ni-SOD) or both iron and zinc (FeZnSOD) have been characterized as cytoplasmic enzymes of Streptomyces griseus and Streptomyces coelicolor (7Youn H.-D. Youn H. Lee J.-W. Yim Y.-I. Lee J.K. Hah Y.C. Kang S.-O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 8Kim E.-J. Kim H.-P. Hah Y.C. Roe J.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The Ni-SOD and FeZn-SOD are found as homotetramers of approximately 13- and 22-kDa subunits, respectively, in S. griseus (7Youn H.-D. Youn H. Lee J.-W. Yim Y.-I. Lee J.K. Hah Y.C. Kang S.-O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) andS. coelicolor (8Kim E.-J. Kim H.-P. Hah Y.C. Roe J.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The expression of sodN coding for Ni-SOD of S. coelicolor (9Kim E.-J. Chung H.-J. Suh B. Hah Y.C. Roe J.-H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and S. griseus 2J.-S. Kim and J. K. Lee, unpublished results. increased in the presence of nickel, whereas their FeZn-SOD (sodF) expressions were regulated through the repression of sodFtranscription in the presence of nickel (10Kim E.-J. Chung H.-J. Suh B. Hah Y.C. Roe J.-H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2014-2020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kim J.-S. Jang J.-H. Lee J.-W. Kang S.-O. Kim K.-S. Lee J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Previously, we found that the nickel-responsive transcriptional repression ofsodF of S. griseus was exerted through an inverted-repeat sequence (TTGCAN7TGCAA) overlapping the 5′ end (+1, G) of sodF transcript (11Kim J.-S. Jang J.-H. Lee J.-W. Kang S.-O. Kim K.-S. Lee J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, nickel-dependent interaction between cell extracts and the sodF operator DNA was confirmed by gel-mobility shift assay (11Kim J.-S. Jang J.-H. Lee J.-W. Kang S.-O. Kim K.-S. Lee J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of trans-acting regulatory protein(s) responsible for the repression. To the best of our knowledge, a nickel-responsive transcriptional regulator has not been described in Gram-positive bacteria, whereas a transcriptional regulator, NikR, has been found for the repression of nikoperon coding for ATP-dependent nickel transport system ofEscherichia coli when nickel is provided in excess (12Navarro C. Wu L.-F. Mandrand-Berthelot M.-A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 1181-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). An inverted-repeat sequence in the promoter of nik operon was proposed as a potential NikR-binding site (13de Pina K. Desjardin V. Mandrand-Berthelot M.-A. Giordano G. We L.-F. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 670-674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Chivers P.T. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19735-19741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). No sequence homology was found between the inverted-repeat sequence of E. coli nik operon and the operator of S. griseus sodF gene. In this study, we identified srnRQ coding for two small proteins mediating nickel-responsive transcriptional repression ofS. griseus sodF (srn stands for sodFrepression by nickel). They are located immediately downstream from sodF. SrnR and SrnQ appear to form an octameric complex composed of four subunits of each protein and then bind to the sodF operator in a nickel-responsive manner. We propose that DNA binding motif-bearing SrnR is a repressor, whereas nickel-binding SrnQ is a co-repressor. A hypothetical model for the repression of sodF transcription by the SrnR·SrnQ complex is presented. S. griseus ATCC 23345 was grown at 28 °C in YEME or YMPD medium as described previously (15Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M.

Microbiol. 1999; 34: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). S. griseusprotoplast was prepared as described previously (15Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces: A Laboratory Manual. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, CT1985: 69-247Google Scholar, 17Oh S.-H. Chater K.F. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 122-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used for transformation with plasmid DNA, which was isolated from E. coli SURE strain (Stratagene) (18Greener A. Strategies. 1990; 5: 81-83Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on R2YE agar plate (15Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces: A Laboratory Manual. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, CT1985: 69-247Google Scholar). Ampicillin, streptomycin (Sm), spectinomycin (Sp), kanamycin (Km), and apramycin (Apr) (final concentrations of 50, 25, 25, 25, and 50 μg/ml, respectively) were used when E. coli carried the antibiotic-resistant genes. Km, Apr, and thiostrepton were used at 5, 5, and 20 μg/ml, respectively, when appropriate forS. griseus culture. Nucleotide sequence of 0.86-kb SmaI/SalI DNA (Fig. 1), which includessrnRQ of S. griseus, has been assigned to GenBankTM under the accession number AF1418663. The initiation codon of SrnR and SrnQ were mutated by PCR including overlap extension as described previously (19McPherson M.J. Directed Mutagenesis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, NY1991Google Scholar). The 1.0-kbPstI/SalI DNA fragment containingsrnRQ (Fig. 1) was cloned into pBS (Stratagene) to generate pBSRQ and used as a DNA template. The primer 5′-TGCACCCTTGGAATCAC-3′ (A of SrnR ATG codon was replaced by T) was used for the disruption of initiation codon of SrnR, whereas the SrnQ initiation codon was mutated using the primer 5′-CCTCATAGTCAGGCCT-3′ (AG was substituted for GA corresponding to the third (G) and first base (A) of the first and second codons of SrnQ, respectively, leaving the SrnR stop codon, originally TGA, as TAG). The PCR products were confirmed for the mutations through the DNA sequence analyses followed by digestion with PstI and SalI and cloning intoPstI/SalI sites of pFD666 (20Denis F. Brzezinski R. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 111: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) to generate pFDR−Q and pFDRQ− carrying the mutations insrnR and srnQ, respectively. Plasmid pFDRQ, also a derivative of pFD666, contained the same 1.0-kbPstI/SalI DNA including the wild-typesrnRQ (Fig. 1). Plasmid pIJK365 derived from a low copy number plasmid pXE4 (21Ingram C. Brawner M. Youngman P. Westpheling J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has the sodF regulatory DNA from −365 to +59 (+1, 5′ end ofsodF transcript), which was transcriptionally fused to promoterless xylE DNA (11Kim J.-S. Jang J.-H. Lee J.-W. Kang S.-O. Kim K.-S. Lee J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). pIM5in(+8+9) carries the samesodF DNA as in pIJK365 with the exception that a 5-bp nonspecific DNA was inserted between the left and right halves of the dyad symmetry (11Kim J.-S. Jang J.-H. Lee J.-W. Kang S.-O. Kim K.-S. Lee J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). All plasmids contain transcription-translation stop Ω DNA (Smr/Spr) (22Prentki P. Krisch H.M. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 29: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar) upstream from thesodF DNA to block any fortuitous transcriptional read-through originated from the vector DNA. S. griseus containing xylE fusion plasmids were cultured for 48 h on an YEME agar plate. Cells were broken by sonication, and catechol dioxygenase activity was measured with cell extracts as described previously (21Ingram C. Brawner M. Youngman P. Westpheling J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activity staining of SOD in a native polyacrylamide (10%) gel was performed as described previously (23Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (9901) Google Scholar). The FeZn-SOD of S. griseus was purified and used as an immunogen to raise an antiserum from mouse as described previously (7Youn H.-D. Youn H. Lee J.-W. Yim Y.-I. Lee J.K. Hah Y.C. Kang S.-O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The preparation of cell extracts, electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, 15% polyacrylamide), and electroblotting of proteins were also performed according to the methods as described previously (7Youn H.-D. Youn H. Lee J.-W. Yim Y.-I. Lee J.K. Hah Y.C. Kang S.-O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 24Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). A blot treated with FeZn-SOD-specific antibody was reacted with a 1/5000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, which was visualized using an ECL detection system supplied by Amersham Biosciences (11Kim J.-S. Jang J.-H. Lee J.-W. Kang S.-O. Kim K.-S. Lee J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by a modified Lowry method using bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as a standard (25Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5332) Google Scholar). The relative SOD activities and FeZnSOD protein levels between samples were quantified by scanning the gel and blot with Tina 2.0 program of a BIO-Imaging analyzer (Fuji). pBSRQ has an insert of the 1.0-kb PstI/SalI DNA containingsrnRQ (Fig. 1) in the same orientation as lacpromoter of pBS. pBSR−Q and pBSRQ− harbored the same insert DNA as in pBSRQ with the exception of mutations in initiation codon of SrnR and SrnQ, respectively. Plasmids pBSRQ, pBSR−Q, and pBSRQ− were transformed intoE. coli DH5α. Expression of SrnR and SrnQ was induced by IPTG at 0.1 mm for 2 h afterA600 of E. coli culture reached 0.6–0.7. SrnR and SrnQ were separated using Tricine-SDS-PAGE (26Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). The separating gel of 16.5% T, 6% C was overlaid with a 4% T, 3% C stacking gel (T denotes the total percentage concentration of both acrylamide and bisacrylamide, and C is the percentage concentration of bisacrylamide relative to the total concentration). A partially digested BamHI fragment of 4.2 kb containing sodF and srnRQ(Fig. 7) was cloned into pKC1139 (Aprr) (27Bierman M. Logan R. O'Brien K. Seno E.T. Nagaraja Rao R. Schoner B.E. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 116: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar), which has a temperature-sensitive replication origin to generate pKCR. TheEcoN1 site within srnR of the plasmid was interrupted through ligation with 2.2-kb transcription-translation stop Ω DNA (Kmr) (28Eraso J.M. Kaplan S. Microbiology. 1994; 141: 1805-1819Google Scholar) following end flushing with Klenow fragment. The resulting plasmid pKCRKm was introduced into S. griseus, and transformants were selected on YMPD agar plate containing Km and Apr at 28 °C. Single cross-over recombinants (Kmr and Aprr) were obtained after incubation of the transformant at 37 °C. The spores of single cross-over then were grown in YMPD broth without Apr for 72 h and plated on to the same medium containing Km. Kanamycin-resistant colonies thus obtained were examined for their sensitivity to Apr, and finally, three colonies showing Kmr and Aprs, which were regarded assrnR-interrupted mutants, were selected among approximately 50 colonies. All of the mutants were confirmed for their chromosomal arrangements of disruptions by Southern hybridization with probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using DNA-labeling beads (Amersham Biosciences), and one srnR disruptant, R45, was chosen for further analyses. Total RNA was extracted from S. griseus as described previously (29Horinouchi S. Suzuki H. Beppu T. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 257-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA quantification, electrophoretic separation of denatured RNA, blot transfer, labeling of strand-specific RNA probe using [α-32P]CTP, and hybridization with the probe were performed as described previously (11Kim J.-S. Jang J.-H. Lee J.-W. Kang S.-O. Kim K.-S. Lee J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 30DeHoff B.S. Lee J.K. Donohue T.J. Gumport R.I. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4681-4692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcript levels were quantified by densitometer scan of the resulting autoradiograms with the BIO-Imaging analyzer. To clone srnR andsrnQ into GST fusion plasmid pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Biosciences), initiation and stop codons of the genes were modified to have BamHI and XhoI sites, respectively. An N-terminal primer, 5′-AACATGCACGGATCCAATCACGCGCC-3′ (mutated sequence underlined unless otherwise noted), with the SrnR start codon changed into BamHI site (inboldface) was used in PCR with a C-terminal primer, 5′-GAGGCCTGATCTCGAGGCGTCGCC-3′, containingXhoI site (in boldface) mutated from the SrnR stop codon. For srnQ, an N-terminal primer, 5′-GGCGACGCCGGATCCTCAGGCCTCG-3′ (BamHI site in boldface), and a C-terminal primer, 5′-CGCGCGGCCGTCTCGAGCCGGGTAGATC-3′ (XhoI site in boldface), were used. pBSRQ was used as a template. The PCR products were digested withBamHI and XhoI and cloned into the expression vector pGEX-5X-3 to generate pGEXR and pGEXQ for the expression of SrnR and SrnQ, respectively. Sequence analyses confirmed the in-frame insertion into the plasmid as well as no other mutation in the amplified DNA. When E. coli DH5α containing either pGEXR or pGEXQ grew up to A600 between 0.6 and 0.7, IPTG was added at 0.1 mm for overexpression of GST-SrnR and GST-SrnQ proteins. The cells were harvested at 2 h after IPTG induction, disrupted by sonication, and centrifuged at 4 °C to obtain cell-free extracts. The GST fusion proteins of ∼39 kDa were identified by SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide). The fusion proteins were purified from the cell lysate using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) followed by elution and concentration of native SrnR and SrnQ after the removal of GST by Factor Xa (New England Biolabs) digestion. The purified proteins were assessed for the purity and size by SDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide) (data not shown). The purified SrnR and SrnQ were used as immunogens to raise antisera as described previously (7Youn H.-D. Youn H. Lee J.-W. Yim Y.-I. Lee J.K. Hah Y.C. Kang S.-O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The DNA fragments to be run for the assay were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The DNA probes (∼104cpm) were incubated at 25 °C with the varying amounts of the purified proteins of SrnR and/or SrnQ in the binding reaction buffer as described previously (11Kim J.-S. Jang J.-H. Lee J.-W. Kang S.-O. Kim K.-S. Lee J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 31Retzlaff L. Distler J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). After a 10-min incubation with or without nickel, the reaction mixture was examined using 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel as described previously (11Kim J.-S. Jang J.-H. Lee J.-W. Kang S.-O. Kim K.-S. Lee J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The results provided in this work are typical ones of at least three to four independent experiments showing virtually the same patterns. Interaction between SrnR and SrnQ was analyzed as described previously (32Luo Z.-Q. Qin Y. Farrand S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7713-7722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Native or SDS-heat-denatured (95 °C for 5 min in 0.2% SDS) SrnR (2 and 5 pmol) was prepared in TDGT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.15 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 0.05% Tween 20) with or without nickel followed by spotting onto nitrocellulose membrane. The nickel was used twice as much as the protein concentration. The blots were dried at room temperature for 1 h. After soaking in phosphate-buffered saline (24Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) containing 5% nonfat milk at room temperature for 30 min, blots were incubated in the same buffer containing native SrnQ (15 nm) for 1 h. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline three times, the membranes were treated with SrnQ-specific mouse antibodies in the same buffer, reacted with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, and detected with an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The complex of SrnR·SrnQ was identified through analytical Sephadex G-100 (Sigma) column (1.2 × 20.0, inner diameter × height (in cm)). The column buffer was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm KCl (33Dempsey B.R. Economou A. Dunn S.D. Shilton B.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). SrnR and SrnQ (60 μg each) were incubated at 25 °C for the protein interaction in the binding reaction buffer, which is the same as that used in the gel-mobility shift assay. The incubation continued with or without nickel (20 μm) for 10 min, and the samples were subjected to the column chromatography, which was run at room temperature. TheA280 of the eluted fractions was measured, and SrnR and SrnQ in elutes were quantified using Tricine-SDS-PAGE (26Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). Either SrnR or SrnQ (15 μm) was incubated at 25 °C in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, containing 100 mm NaCl (14Chivers P.T. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19735-19741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) with or without nickel (20 μm). The CD spectra of the proteins were obtained in wavelength range between 200 and 250 nm at 0.1-nm intervals with J-720 CD spectropolarimeter (Jasco). Five spectra with a resolution of 1 nm, a scan speed of 50 nm/min, and a response time of 1 s were averaged. The mean residue ellipticity was calculated using the molecular mass of each protein. Nickel binding of SrnQ and SrnR was assayed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry following equilibrium dialysis. 2-ml solution of SrnQ or SrnR (6.4 μm) was dialyzed against 0.5-liter buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl) (14Chivers P.T. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19735-19741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) containing different amounts of NiCl2 at 4 °C for 48 h. Unbound nickel was then removed by dialysis in ∼500-fold volume of the 10 mmHepes, pH 7.6, at 4 °C for 6 h. Metal content was determined with an AA-880 mark II atomic absorption (flame) spectrophotometer from Thermo Jarrel Ash. Each reading reported by the instrument was an average of three determinations. Bovine serum albumin was used as a control. The activity and protein level of FeZn-SOD were found much more repressed by nickel when the 1.0-kbPstI/SalI DNA (Fig.1) downstream from sodF was maintained in multiple copies in cells (Fig. 2,pFDRQ). S. griseusharboring pFDRQ containing thesodF downstream DNA was grown on YEME agar plates supplemented with nickel up to 5 μm, and the FeZn-SOD activity and the protein level were measured at 48 h after inoculation. Although the FeZn-SOD expression of S. griseus having vector DNA, pFD666, decreased in proportion to nickel concentration (Fig. 2, pFD666), the presence of pFDRQ in repeated analyses always lowered the enzyme expression to a greater extent to display the activity (Fig. 2A) and the protein level (Fig. 2B) that are barely detectable at 5 μm nickel. A sequence analysis of the sodF downstream DNA revealed two ORFs, which are oriented in the same direction as sodF, and started at 160 and 501 bp downstream from the SodF stop codon, respectively (Fig. 1). The first ORF (SrnR) consisted of 114 deduced amino acids with molecular mass of 12,343 Da, whereas the second ORF (SrnQ) revealed 110 amino acids of 12,486 Da. The initiation codon of SrnQ overlaps the stop codon of SrnR. A comparison of amino acid sequence between residues 12 and 82 of SrnR with data base revealed its homology to the transcriptional regulators of ArsR family (Fig.3): ∼61% similarity (33% identity) to HlyU, which up-regulates the transcription of hemolysin gene ofVibrio cholerae (34Williams S.G. Attridge S.R. Manning P.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); 60% similarity (36% identity) to ArsR as a transcriptional repressor of the arsenical resistance genes of Staphylococcus xylosus (35Rosenstein R. Peschel A. Wieland B. Götz F. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3676-3683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); 59% similarity (36% identity) to the NolR involved in negative control of the expression of nodulation genes of Rhizobium meliloti (36Kondorosi E. Pierre M. Cren M. Haumann U. Buiré M. Hoffmann B. Schell J. Kondorosi A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); 57% similarity (40% identity) to MerR acting as an activator-repressor protein involved in mercury resistance of Streptomyces lividans(37Sedlmeier R. Altenbuchner J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 236: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); and 52% similarity (42% identity) to a putative ArsR found in genome data base of S. coelicolor M145 at Sanger center (www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/S_coelicolor/). Around the middle of SrnR was found a putative helix-turn-helix motif as depicted in Fig. 3. No protein displaying homology to SrnQ was found. SrnQ has remarkably high content (26%) of arginine. To determine which ORF(s) of the sodF downstream DNA mediates the enhanced repression of FeZn-SOD in the presence of nickel, SrnR and SrnQ were mutagenized through PCR. As illustrated in pFDR−Q (Fig. 1), the initiation codon of SrnR was changed into TTG resulting in SrnR−. The SrnR mutation might have polar effect on the expression of downstream SrnQ, so the 213-bpXmaIII-EcoNI DNA corresponding to the peptide from residues 9–78 of SrnR was in-frame deleted to generate pFD(ΔR)Q (data not shown). In addition, plasmid pFDRQ− was constructed to have a substitution of ATA for the initiation codon of SrnQ, but the SrnR stop codon, originally TGA, was still kept as TAG (Fig. 1). The FeZn-SOD expression of S. griseus harboring either pFDR−Q or pFDRQ−in trans was compared with that of the control cells containing pFD666 in the presence of nickel (Fig. 2). No significant difference in FeZn-SOD expression was observed. S. griseus having pFD(ΔR)Q showed the same results as those of the cells harboring pFDR−Q (data not shown), suggesting no polar mutation for the expression of SrnQ by the SrnR− mutation of pFDR−Q. Thus, the results clearly indicate that SrnR and SrnQ are required together for the in transeffect of the downstream DNA in multicopies. It was examined whether srnR and srnQ code for the proteins of deduced sizes. The proteins were expressed through IPTG induction fromE. coli harboring pBSRQ, pBSR−Q, and pBSRQ−. The orientation of srnRQ in these plasmids was the same as that of lac promoter, but their reading frames were shifted from that of the LacZ α-polypeptide of the plasmid. The Tricine-SDS-PAGE of the cell extracts of E. coli containing pBSRQ revealed two discrete polypeptides of ∼12 kDa only after IPTG induction (Fig. 4,lane 4). The slow-moving band was regarded as SrnQ, because it was still detected with pBSR−Q (Fig. 4, lane 6). The other fast-moving one was concluded to be SrnR because it was observed with pBSRQ− (Fig. 4, lane 8). The sizes of the expressed polypeptides were also similar to the deduced values of SrnR (12,343 Da) and SrnQ (12,486 Da). We did not believe that E. coli RNA polymerase(s) recognized the promoter forsrnR and srnQ, because the polypeptides were not expressed when srnRQ were oriented in opposite direction to the plasmid lac promoter (data not shown).

The RSS consists of a conserved nonamer and heptamer sequence, in which the latter borders the site of DNA cleavage. A region within RAG1, referred to as the central domain (residues 528–760 of 1040 in the full-length protein), has been shown previously to bind specifically to the double-stranded (ds) RSS heptamer, but with both weak specificity and affinity. However, additional investigations into the RAG1-RSS heptamer interaction are required because the DNA substrate forms intermediate conformations during the V(D)J recombination reaction. These include the nicked and hairpin products, as well as likely base unpairing to produce single-stranded (ss) DNA near the cleavage site.

Through DNA rearrangement of the immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genetic loci, the genes are assembled by combining selected gene segments termed variable (V), joining (J), and at some loci, diversity (D). The variability of the assembly process in each developing lymphocyte yields an immune system that contains a repertoire of antigen receptors with an array of binding specificities (1Fugmann S.D. Lee A.I. Shockett P.E. Villey I.J. Schatz D.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 2Gellert M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The first phase of V(D)J recombination consists of site-specific DNA cleavage steps adjacent to selected gene segments and requires the lymphoid-specific recombination activating proteins, RAG1 and RAG2 (1Fugmann S.D. Lee A.I. Shockett P.E. Villey I.J. Schatz D.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar,2Gellert M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Together the RAG proteins are directed to potential DNA cleavage sites by recognition of the recombination signal sequence (RSS),1 which flanks each gene segment. The RSS contains a conserved heptamer and nonamer sequence separated by either 12 (12-RSS) or 23 (23-RSS) base pairs of poorly conserved DNA. Successful assembly of two gene segments requires that the segments are adjoined to dissimilar RSSs, a requirement referred to as the 12/23 rule. The RAG proteins cleave at each selected RSS to first nick the double-stranded DNA between the RSS heptamer and the bordering antigen receptor gene segment. The result is a 3′-OH group that executes a nucleophilic attack on the opposite strand, generating a covalently closed hairpin at the coding end and a signal end that is blunt-ended at the 5′-end of the RSS heptamer. The second phase of the V(D)J recombination reaction consists of joining the respective coding and signal ends and requires both RAG proteins along with the non-homologous end-joining proteins DNA-PKcs, Ku70/80, Artemis, XRCC4, and DNA ligase IV. This phase joins the 12 and 23 signal ends in a precise junction (1Fugmann S.D. Lee A.I. Shockett P.E. Villey I.J. Schatz D.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The coding end joint formation, in contrast to the signal end junction, is variable because of the addition or deletion of bases. During this phase, studies have shown that the RAG proteins remain bound to both the coding ends and signal ends, perhaps to stabilize the joining procedure (3Agrawal A. Schatz D.G. Cell. 1997; 89: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 4Hiom K. Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1011-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The majority of biochemical studies with the RAG proteins have been accomplished using truncated murine proteins consisting of the core regions, which are the minimal catalytically active regions required for in vivo recombination activity. The core regions of RAG1 and RAG2 includes residues 384–1008 of 1040 and residues 1–387 of 527, respectively (2Gellert M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Although both RAG proteins are required for DNA cleavage, biochemical characterizations have revealed that RAG1 contains the sequence-specific DNA binding domains to the RSS. The DNA binding domain with specificity for the RSS nonamer lies within the N-terminal region of core RAG1 (residues 384–454) and was found to contain sequences similar to the homeodomain DNA binding domains (5Spanopoulou E.

The RSS heptamer binding site has been found to lie within the central domain of core RAG1, which includes residues 528–760 (7Arbuckle J.L. Fauss L.J. Simpson R. Ptaszek L.M. Rodgers K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37093-37101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Along with its ability to bind to the RSS heptamer, the central domain also contains the predominant RAG2 binding site (7Arbuckle J.L. Fauss L.J. Simpson R. Ptaszek L.M. Rodgers K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37093-37101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 8Aidinis V. Dias D.C. Gomez C.A. Bhattacharyya D. Spanopoulou E. Santagata S. J.

The RAG protein-RSS heptamer interaction is a critical interaction for successful DNA cleavage. A survey of the antigen receptor loci has demonstrated that the heptamer sequence in each RSS is highly conserved, particularly the three bases at the 5′-end (5′-CAC-3′), whereas the nonamer sequence is more poorly retained (16Hesse J.E. Lieber M.R. Mizuuchi K. Gellert M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1053-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 17Ramsden D.A. Baetz K. Wu G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1785-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Previous evidence from DNA footprinting studies suggested the structure of the RSS becomes distorted at the cleavage site upon binding of the RAG proteins (9Swanson P.C. Desiderio S. Immunity. 1998; 9: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Furthermore, substrates that included single-stranded (ss) RSS (either entirely ss RSS flanked by a double-stranded (ds) coding region or RSS with mispaired bases at the coding/heptamer border) were much more efficiently cleaved compared with an entirely ds substrate (18Ramsden D.A. McBlane J.F. van Gent D.C. Gellert M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 19Cuomo C.A. Mundy C.L. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5683-5690Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Together these results suggest that a likely loss of base pairing at the coding/heptamer border occurs upon RAG binding, which then facilitates subsequent catalytic events. Although the central domain of RAG1 appeared to recognize the ds RSS heptamer, the binding affinity was exceptionally weak and the specificity was low relative to nonsequence-specific DNA (7Arbuckle J.L. Fauss L.J. Simpson R. Ptaszek L.M. Rodgers K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37093-37101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because the structure of the RSS heptamer may be altered from ds to ss form upon RAG protein binding and because nicking may lead to altered RAG interactions, we have characterized the interaction of the central domain to these variant configurations of the RSS heptamer. Here we describe the substantial enhancement in binding affinity and sequence specificity of the RAG1 central domain for certain conformations of the RSS heptamer versus the ds form. Thus, the RSS heptamer binding site is located in the RAG1 central domain, but strong complex formation depends on disruption of the ds DNA helix. The implications of these results to the V(D)J recombination reaction are discussed. Plasmid pAEC5 encodes a gene for maltose binding protein (MBP) fused to RAG1 residues 528–721, where the fusion protein is referred to as MBP·R1cd(ΔZFB). TheRAG1 gene fragment was created by amplification of the appropriate region from the full-length murine RAG1 gene. The primers introduced a BamHI site at the 5′-end of the product and two stop codons and a SalI site at the 3′-end of the product. The fragment was inserted into the BamHI andSalI sites of the multiple cloning site of pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs). The plasmids pCJM233 (encoding MBP fused to core RAG1, referred to as MBP·core RAG1), pRS3 (encoding MBP fused to RAG1 residues 528–760, referred to as MBP·R1cd), and pAEC5 (encoding MBP fused to RAG1 residues 528–721, referred to as MBP·R1cd(ΔZFB)) were transformed intoEscherichia coli BL21 cells. The fusion proteins were expressed and purified as previously described (7Arbuckle J.L. Fauss L.J. Simpson R. Ptaszek L.M. Rodgers K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37093-37101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), with the following modification for MBP·R1cd preparations. Size-exclusion chromatography with a Superdex 200 column of MBP·R1cd yielded ∼80 and 20% monomeric and dimeric protein, respectively. The monomeric and dimeric fractions of MBP·R1cd were collected and stored separately. GST·core RAG2, expressed by transient transfection in 293T cells, was purified as previously reported (5Spanopoulou E. Zaitseva F. Wang F.-H. Santagata S. Baltimore D. Panayotou G. Cell. 1996; 87: 263-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The 59-base sequence of the top strand of the wild type (WT) 12-RSS is d(GATATGGCTCGTCCTACACAGTGATATAGACCTTAACAAAAACCTCCAATCGAGCGGAG). The mutant heptamer (MH) 12-RSS oligonucleotide sequence is identical to the WT 12-RSS except the sequence GAGAAGC replaced the WT heptamer sequence (CACAGTG). The mutant heptamer and mutant nonamer 12-RSS sequence is identical to the WT 12-RSS, except the MH is changed as described above and the nonamer sequence (ACAAAAACC) has been replaced by AGGCTCTGA. Oligonucleotides were commercially synthesized and PAGE-purified (Integrated DNA Technologies). The ss 12-RSS substrates used corresponded to the top (sense) strand, unless otherwise stated. The ds 12-RSS substrate used was prepared by annealing complementary oligonucleotides. The nicked 12-RSS substrates were prepared by annealing a 16-base oligonucleotide (corresponding to the first 16 bases of the top strand) and a 43-base oligonucleotide (corresponding to bases 17–59 of the top strand and 5′-labeled with cold ATP) to a 59-base complementary oligonucleotide. Substrates were labeled at the 5′-end of the top (sense) strand with [γ-32P]ATP where indicated, using T4 polynucleotide kinase. MBP·R1cd and MBP·R1cd(ΔZFB) were incubated with 1 nm32P-labeled substrates and the complexes resolved on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels as previously described (20Rodgers K.K. Villey I.J. Ptaszek L. Corbett E. Schatz D.G. Coleman J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2938-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The dimeric fraction of MBP·R1cd was used in the experiments, except where stated otherwise. MBP·core RAG1 was incubated with 1 nm32P-labeled substrates and resolved on a discontinuous 3.5/8% nondenaturing gel. The binding buffer contained 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 6% glycerol, and 100 mmNaCl. The bands were visualized using an Amersham Biosciences SI PhosphorImager and densitometer and analyzed using ImageQuaNT software. Protein concentrations in titrations to all ss substrates and WT nicked RSS ranged up to 1.5 μm. Kd values were determined as previously reported (20Rodgers K.K. Villey I.J. Ptaszek L. Corbett E. Schatz D.G. Coleman J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2938-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and are the result ofn = 3 experiments per protein-DNA interaction. To analyze the effect of RAG2 on the interaction of RSS with the RAG1 proteins, GST·core RAG2 was incubated with either MBP·core RAG1, MBP·R1cd, or MBP·R1cd(ΔZFB) for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 1 nm32P-labeled substrates and incubation for 30 min at 25 °C, with subsequent resolution on 5% nondenaturing gels. The binding buffer was the same as listed above, except for experiments containing both GST·core RAG2 and MBP·core RAG1, in which 5 mm CaCl2 was substituted for MgCl2. The central domain of core RAG1 spans residues 528–760 of the full-length murine protein (Fig. 1) and contains two active-site residues (Asp-600 and Asp-708) of the three that were found by mutagenesis studies to reside in RAG1 (21Kim D.R. Dai Y. Mundy C.L. Yang W. Oettinger M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3070-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 22Landree M.A. Wibbenmeyer J.A. Roth D.B.

Further evidence of the importance of this region to catalytic activity is that point mutations in the central domain lead to immunodeficiency diseases, which are the result of either completely defective recombinase activity (i.e.T−B− severe combined immunodeficiency) or significantly reduced activity (i.e. Omenn syndrome) (24Santagata S.

Blood. 2001; 97: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In addition, mutagenesis studies of conserved residues in the central domain region of intact core RAG1 showed several positions that severely affected cleavage activity (28Huye L.E. Purugganan M.M. Jiang M.M. Roth D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3460-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29Tsai C.-L. Drejer A.H. Schatz D.G. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1934-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have found previously that the central domain demonstrated specific binding to the ds RSS heptamer. However, the binding affinity was very weak (with little protein-DNA complex formed even at micromolar concentrations of protein) and with only 3-fold specificity to the heptamer over nonsequence-specific DNA (7Arbuckle J.L. Fauss L.J. Simpson R. Ptaszek L.M. Rodgers K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37093-37101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because the conformation of the RSS heptamer is predicted to gain ss character during the cleavage reaction and cleavage intermediates occur during the course of the reaction, we have tested the interaction of the central domain with the corresponding RSS substrates, including ds, ss, and nicked RSS (Fig.2A). In these experiments, increasing concentrations of the RAG1 central domain fused to maltose-binding protein (referred to as MBP·R1cd) were titrated into oligonucleotides containing a 12-RSS, with subsequent resolution of the bound complexes by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). In the binding assays, 12-RSS was used rather than 23-RSS, because the RAG proteins bind and cleave more efficiently at a 12-RSS (2Gellert M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). It is evident from Fig. 2A that the binding affinity of MBP·R1cd is significantly greater for ss and nicked RSS versus the ds substrate. Quantitation of the binding curves (Fig. 2B) shows that MBP·R1cd binds with >30-fold preference for ss DNA over the ds substrate and a >7-fold increase in affinity for nicked RSS over ds substrate (Table I). The binding affinity to the ss RSS heptamer corresponding to the bottom strand sequence (5′-CACTGTG) was within error of that to the top strand (data not shown), which is not unexpected given the near dyad symmetry of the ds heptamer sequence. These results clearly demonstrate that the central domain in core RAG1 has a significantly enhanced capacity to bind to a ss versus a ds DNA helix. However, it is not clear what would result in the increased affinity for nickedversus ds RSS. Perhaps the central domain is capable of unwinding the DNA helix near the nicked site. Previously, the RAG proteins were found to form a complex with nicked RSS that had an apparently slower off rate than with unnicked RSS (30Grawunder U. Lieber M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1375-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). An increased affinity of the RAG1 heptamer binding site with newly nicked DNA after the first cleavage step may account for this behavior.Table IBinding constants for RAG1 proteins to RSS substratesSampleProteinDNA substrateKd1-aResults are from n = 3 experiments per protein-DNA interaction.,1-bThe dimeric protein fraction from the size-exclusion chromatography was used in experiments with MBP·R1cd.μm1MBP·R1cdss 12-RSS0.15 ± 0.052MBP·R1cdds 12-RSS>53MBP·R1cdNicked 12-RSS0.65 ± 0.134MBP·R1cdss MH 12-RSS or ss MHMN 12-RSS∼1.55MBP·R1cdNicked MHMN 12-RSS>56MBP·R1cd(ΔZFB)ss 12-RSS0.50 ± 0.057MBP·core RAG1ss 12-RSS0.47 ± 0.178MBP·core RAG1ds 12-RSS0.20 ± 0.021-a Results are from n = 3 experiments per protein-DNA interaction.1-b The dimeric protein fraction from the size-exclusion chromatography was used in experiments with MBP·R1cd. Open table in a new tab Two distinct protein-DNA complexes are formed in the titration of MBP·R1cd to the different RSS substrates (Fig. 2A). These complexes may represent monomeric and dimeric forms of the central domain bound to the RSS. Whereas MBP·R1cd eluted from size-exclusion chromatography predominantly in the monomeric form, initial loading concentrations of ∼10–20 μm yielded ∼20% of the protein in the dimeric form. To determine whether the two shifted MBP·R1cd·12-RSS complexes in Fig. 2A were because of a difference in stoichiometry of MBP·R1cd in the protein-DNA complexes, we utilized the separate monomeric and dimeric protein fractions from size-exclusion chromatography. The separate fractions were first incubated with ss 12-RSS and the resulting protein-DNA complexes subjected to EMSA (Fig. 2C). At the protein concentrations used, only a fraction of the DNA was complexed, likely producing the formation of only sequence-specific protein-DNA complexes. Significantly, the dimeric fraction yielded two shifted bands, whereas the monomeric fraction resulted in one shifted band even though the protein concentration in the latter fraction was slightly higher. The dimeric fraction of MBP·R1cd was used in the DNA-binding experiments described here (see “Experimental Procedures” and Table I). However, the monomeric fraction of protein yielded similar binding affinities to ss 12-RSS (within error) as the dimeric fraction (data not shown). In Fig. 2C, the appearance of two complexes with the dimeric fraction is most likely because of the partial dissociation of dimer to monomer after completion of size-exclusion chromatography. This weak self-association of MBP·R1cd also explains why the relative proportions of dimeric to monomeric MBP·R1cd complexed with 12-RSS did not change significantly during the course of the titration (Fig.2A). It is possible though that in the intact RAG1 protein, the central domain may dimerize more readily, because it is bordered on each side by domains that have been shown to oligomerize in the absence of DNA (7Arbuckle J.L. Fauss L.J. Simpson R. Ptaszek L.M. Rodgers K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37093-37101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 31Rodgers K.K. Bu Z. Fleming K.G. Schatz D.G. Engelman D.M. Coleman J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 70-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the isolated central domain and intact core RAG1 bind preferentially to the ds RSS heptamer (7Arbuckle J.L. Fauss L.J. Simpson R. Ptaszek L.M. Rodgers K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37093-37101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the binding specificity was only ∼3-fold greater than to ds nonsequence-specific DNA. This difference is likely not sufficient to warrant the high conservation of the heptamer in the endogenous RSSs located in the antigen receptor loci. Because the central domain demonstrates vastly enhanced binding affinity to ss over ds DNA, we asked whether the central domain showed greater specificity if the RSS heptamer were in ss form. To determine the extent of preferential recognition of the central domain to the RSS heptamer sequence, we compared the binding affinity to an oligonucleotide in which the heptamer sequence has been replaced. Comparison of the results between WT ss 12-RSS (in Fig. 2A) and MH ss 12-RSS (Fig. 3A) demonstrates that equivalent protein concentrations yield less complex with the latter substrate. Mutation of both the heptamer and nonamer sequences did not significantly further reduce the binding, as expected, because the nonamer binding site is not located in the central domain. From analysis of the binding curves, the central domain demonstrates ∼10-fold specificity for ss RSS heptamer over nonsequence-specific ss DNA (Table I). These results demonstrate that the central domain has a significantly increased specificity for the RSS heptamer in ssversus ds form and provides further support for the model that ss DNA is an important structural intermediate in the DNA cleavage phase of V(D)J recombination. In addition, by a similar method, we found that the central domain demonstrates >7-fold decreased affinity for nicked 12-RSS in substrates containing mutated heptamer and nonamer sequences (Table I). Thus, as the RSS is nicked the central domain gains greater affinity and specificity for the RSS heptamer, likely because of local unwinding of the ds DNA near the nicked site. Besides two active site residues, the central domain also contains a near classic C2H2 zinc finger motif between residues 722–760, which is referred to as the ZFB (zinc finger B) (31Rodgers K.K. Bu Z. Fleming K.G. Schatz D.G. Engelman D.M. Coleman J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 70-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It has been previously shown that the ZFB is the predominant binding site to core RAG2 (8Aidinis V. Dias D.C. Gomez C.A. Bhattacharyya D. Spanopoulou E. Santagata S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5826-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and also that the isolated central domain is capable of binding core RAG2 (7Arbuckle J.L. Fauss L.J. Simpson R. Ptaszek L.M. Rodgers K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37093-37101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because zinc fingers are often sequence-specific DNA binding motifs, we asked whether the ZFB contributes in the interaction with the RSS heptamer. An MBP fusion protein with the ZFB deleted from the central domain of RAG1 was constructed and is referred to as MBP·R1cd(ΔZFB). Comparison of the titration of MBP·R1cd(ΔZFB) (Fig. 3B) versus MBP·R1cd (Fig. 2A) to ss 12-RSS shows that the truncated central domain did not form a complex with WT ss 12-RSS as efficiently as the central domain containing the ZFB. From analysis of the respective binding curves the difference in affinity is 3- to 4-fold (Table I). These results demonstrate that in the context of the isolated central domain, the ZFB makes a significant contribution to ss RSS heptamer binding. However, residues 528–721 within the central domain clearly make the major sequence-specific contacts with the heptamer, because the truncated domain still demonstrated an ∼3-fold increase in binding affinity to WT ss 12-RSS over nonsequence-specific ss DNA. Despite a small fraction (<20%) of MBP·R1cd(ΔZFB) eluting from size-exclusion chromatography as a dimer, both the monomeric (Fig.3B) and dimeric (data not shown) fractions yielded only one protein-DNA complex, not two as occurred with MBP·R1cd bound to ss 12-RSS. This may indicate that deletion of the ZFB significantly decreases stability of the central domain dimer. Given the ability of the isolated central domain to preferentially bind ss over ds RSS, we asked whether intact core RAG1 showed similar DNA binding properties. Quantitation of binding curves demonstrated that intact core RAG1 bound with slightly lower affinity to ssversus ds RSS (Table I). It is not surprising that the differential effects of the central domain are not observed in the intact core RAG1 protein because of the presence of additional DNA binding domains (Fig. 1). Specifically, the N-terminal region of core RAG1 contains the nonamer binding site, which efficiently recognizes the ds nonamer sequence (5Spanopoulou E. Zaitseva F. Wang F.-H. Santagata S. Baltimore D. Panayotou G. Cell. 1996; 87: 263-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 6Difilippantonio M.J. McMahan C.J. Eastman Q.M. Spanopoulou E. Schatz D.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a C-terminal domain in core RAG1 (residues 761–979) was found to bind ds DNA in nonsequence-specific manner cooperatively and with relatively high affinity (7Arbuckle J.L. Fauss L.J. Simpson R. Ptaszek L.M. Rodgers K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37093-37101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is possible that the heptamer binding site in the central domain is not as accessible to DNA in the intact core RAG1 protein, particularly in the absence of RAG2. Because the central domain of RAG1 demonstrated high affinity for WT ss 12-RSS, we asked whether this interaction would be affected upon the addition of RAG2. In these experiments, samples containing increasing concentrations of GST·core RAG2 were incubated with MBP·R1cd, followed by the addition of WT ss 12-RSS. After an additional incubation of the protein complexes with ss 12-RSS, the resulting protein-DNA complexes were resolved by EMSA. Surprisingly, the results demonstrate that as the concentration of RAG2 increased, the amount of ss 12-RSS complexed with MBP·R1cd decreased (Fig.4A). The order in which components were combined had no effect on the results, because experiments in which RAG2 was added last yielded similar results (data not shown). However, in the same assay performed with MBP·R1cd(ΔZFB), no decrease in DNA binding activity was observed, indicating that RAG2 does not have substantial interaction with residues 528–721 of RAG1 (Fig. 4B). Therefore, RAG2 inhibited the association of central domain of RAG1 with the ss 12-RSS, possibly by binding to the ZFB and blocking access of DNA to the remaining portion of the central domain. We also tested the effect of RAG2 on the interaction of intact core RAG1 with ss 12-RSS, using buffer conditions that prevent DNA cleavage activity. After utilizing EMSA to resolve the protein-DNA complexes, supershifted bands due to RAG1·RAG2·12-RSS complexes were detected (Fig. 4C). As the concentration of GST·core RAG2 increased, the amount of bound DNA increased, indicating that RAG2 enhanced the association of MBP·core RAG1 to the ss 12-RSS. It is possible that RAG2 alters the conformation of RAG1 to increase the DNA binding ability of the latter. Core RAG2 has also been found to induce a similar increase in binding affinity of core RAG1 for ds 12-RSS (32Godderz L.J. Rahman N.S. Risinger G.M. Arbuckle J.L. Rodgers K.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2014-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We suggest two possible interpretations for the contrasting influence of RAG2 on the association to the ss 12-RSS of the isolated central domain versus intact core RAG1. First, upon binding the ZFB, RAG2 blocks the DNA binding site in the isolated central domain, but in intact core RAG1 other regions of the protein (i.e. the N- or C-terminal core RAG1 domains) prevent this inappropriate orientation of RAG2. Second, it is possible that prior to V(D)J recombination, RAG2 specifically inhibits the central domain of RAG1 from binding to DNA until a correct initial complex is formed with an RSS. This latter possibility would be a means for RAG2 to regulate the binding of the central domain and, hence, the active site of RAG1 from contacting DNA until an appropriate protein-DNA complex was formed. In this study, we have found that the central domain of core RAG1 demonstrated substantially enhanced affinity to putative and known RSS intermediates, namely ss and nicked substrates as compared with ds RSS. Binding to the ss RSS substrate was particularly favorable. Furthermore, the central domain showed a significant increase in specificity for the RSS heptamer in the ss and nicked formsversus the ds form. Given these results, we propose the following series of events upon binding of the RAG proteins to a single RSS. First, the RAG proteins bind to the ds RSS substrate with strong interactions between the nonamer binding site of RAG1 and the RSS nonamer but only weakly specific interactions with the RSS heptamer. DNA helical distortions, which likely include base unpairing, is induced at the RSS heptamer-coding flank border. In the 12-RSS, the spacing between the nonamer and heptamer of two helical turns is most likely optimal for binding of both conserved elements by the RAG proteins. In the 23-RSS, additional bending of the DNA helix, which may be facilitated by the high mobility group proteins, HMG1 or HMG2, is likely required for optimal interaction (33Aidinis V. Bonaldi T. Beltrame M. Santagata S. Bianchi M.E. Spanopoulou E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6532-6542Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 34Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1340-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In either case, the introduction of ss conformation in the RSS heptamer results in robust and specific association of the RAG1 central domain with the heptamer and appropriate proximity of the aspartate active site residues to the DNA cleavage site for subsequent nicking activity. After nicking occurs, the RAG1 central domain remains tightly associated with the RSS heptamer with the active site primed for hairpin formation."

In contrast, the use of genetics in Drosophila has aided in the identification of proteins that regulate alternative splicing. In particular, the genes involved in Drosophila sex determination have become prototypes for the study of positive and negative control of alternative splicing (18Baker B.S.

Female-specific splicing of dsx requires the production of two proteins, Transformer (TRA) and Transformer2 (TRA2), and an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) element located within the untranslated region of the fourth exon (19McKeown M. Belote J.M. Boggs R.T. Cell. 1988; 53: 887-895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 20Nagoshi R.N. McKeown M. Burtis K.C. Belote J.M. Baker B.S.

Both TRA and TRA2 contain Arg/Ser-rich (RS) domains, protein interaction domains characteristic of the Ser/Arg-rich (SR) family of essential splicing factors. SR proteins are thought to function by binding to ESEs and by recruiting the splicing machinery to adjacent introns via protein interactions involving the RS domain (22Blencowe B.J. Trends Biochem.

Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2089-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Most ESEs studied in mechanistic detail activate 3′-splice sites that contain suboptimal polypyrimidine tracts, the site of U2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U2AF) binding. A picture has therefore emerged suggesting that enhancer complexes assembled on ESEs recruit U2AF to a weak 3′-splice site (32Wang Z. Hoffmann H.M. Grabowski P.J. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 21-35PubMed Google Scholar, 33Zuo P. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1356-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 34Graveley B.R. Hertel K.J. Maniatis T. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 806-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). An alternative and equally attractive model proposes that ESEs interact with a master assembly factor, such as the splicing coactivator SRm160 (22Blencowe B.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 106-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), that assists in the assembly of the spliceosome. Thus, ESEs may recruit spliceosomal factors to the regulated 3′-splice site through direct or indirect interactions. Although much has been learned about the mechanisms of ESE-dependent 3′-splice site activation, the mechanisms of enhancer-dependent 5′-splice site recognition are currently not well understood. It has been documented that the SR protein ASF/SF2 promotes the association of U1 snRNP to the 5′-splice site of several test RNAs (35Kohtz J.D. Jamison S.F. Will C.L. Zuo P. Lührmann R.

Although many of the current efforts are focused on the identification of the trans-acting factors that regulate each alternative 5′-splice site choice, genetic approaches have already provided this information for alternative 5′-splice site choice in the Drosophila melanogaster fruitless (fru) gene. The detailed study of fru alternative splicing therefore provides an excellent opportunity to expand our limited knowledge on the mechanisms that govern ESE-dependent 5′-splice site regulation. fru is expressed in ∼0.5% of the neurons in the central nervous system (44Hall J.C.

Cloning of fru demonstrated that sex-specific alternative splicing of the fru pre-mRNA determines the majority of male courtship behavior (38Ryner L.C. Goodwin S.F. Castrillon D.H. Anand A.

Like dsx, fru is alternatively spliced in a sex-specific manner that requires TRA and TRA2 to switch from the male-specific pattern to the female-specific pattern (38Ryner L.C. Goodwin S.F.

However, in contrast to dsx, fru alternative splicing involves the activation of a female-specific 5′-splice site (38Ryner L.C. Goodwin S.F. Castrillon D.H. Anand A. Villella A. Baker B.S. Hall J.C.

Baker B.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 450-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the fru enhancer, designated fruRE, contains three copies of similar 13-nucleotide repeat elements that regulate the female-specific alternative 3′-splice site in dsx (see Table I). Thus, TRA and TRA2 regulate both dsx and fru alternative splicing, presumably through the formation of similar, if not identical, enhancer complexes. In support of this suggestion, it was previously shown that the fruRE is capable of functionally replacing the dsxRE using heterologous pre-mRNAs in transfection assays (40Heinrichs V. Ryner L.C. Baker B.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 450-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, whereas the dsx enhancer complex activates an alternative 3′-splice site, the fru enhancer complex activates an alternative 5′-splice site.Table IComparison of 13-nucleotide repeat elements in dsx and fruRepeat no.dsxfru1UCUUCAAUCAACAACUUCAAUCAACA2UCUUCAAUCAACAUCUUCAAUCAACA3UCUACAAUCAACAUCAUCAAUCAACA4UCUUCAAUCAACANA5UCAACAAUCAACANA6UCAACGAUCAACANA Open table in a new tab Initial recognition of exon/intron junctions is achieved by several spliceosomal factors (48Reed R. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1996; 6: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). U1 snRNP binds to the 5′-splice site by a combination of RNA/RNA and protein/RNA interactions (49Du H. Rosbash M. Nature. 2002; 419: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 50Lund M. Kjems J. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The 3′-splice site is initially recognized by U2AF. The activation of 5′- or 3′-splice sites thus requires the recruitment of a different set of splicing factors to their respective exon/intron junction. Previous studies have demonstrated that each dsxRE interacts with only one spliceosomal target (51Hertel K.J. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 449-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the manner in which the alternative splicing of the fru pre-mRNA is regulated suggests that the TRA/TRA2-dependent dsx and fru ESEs may recruit distinct spliceosomal components to the adjacent intron. This hypothesis was tested using an in vitro splicing system that allowed an in-depth investigation of the splicing enhancer that controls the recognition of the fru female-specific 5′-splice site. Mutational analysis demonstrated that one of the 13-nucleotide repeat elements present in the fruRE is sufficient to activate the regulated female-specific splice site. As was demonstrated for dsx, the fruRE can be replaced efficiently by a short element encompassing tandem 13-nucleotide repeat elements, by previously characterized heterologous ESEs, and by artificially tethering a splicing activation domain to the pre-mRNA. Finally, complementation experiments demonstrated that SR proteins facilitate ESE-dependent 5′-splice site activation. These experiments show that the fruRE and dsxRE function similarly in activating regulated 5′- and 3′-splice sites, respectively, and suggest that the fru and dsx ESE complexes are capable of recruiting targets that contain multiple spliceosomal components required for the initial recognition of 5′- and 3′-splice sites.

Biol. 1998; 18: 450-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were inserted into the same restriction sites of SP73 (Promega): a PstI fragment that contains the common 3′-exon and an EcoRI fragment containing the female-specific 5′-splice site and the upstream splicing enhancer. Substrate fruF was derived from fruF-long by deleting ∼560 nucleotides of intronic sequences (XbaI and NcoI digest, followed by blunt ligation). Mutant substrates fruFmut1, fruFmut2, fruFmut3, fruFmut23, and fruFmut123 are derivatives of construct fruF. In all these constructs, the 13-nucleotide repeat sequences have been changed from NNNTCAATCAACA to NNNGGCAGCTTAC. To generate these mutations, a three-step PCR method was used. Primers spanning each repeat in forward (fwd) and reverse (rev) directions were used in combination with a reverse primer at the downstream EcoRI site (fruFrev) and an SP6 primer, respectively. The PCR fragments so generated were then annealed together and amplified. After digestion with EcoRI, mutated fragments were inserted into EcoRI-digested fruF backbone, replacing the wild-type fruF EcoRI fragment. The fru primers used were 5′-ACTGGCAGCGTACTACCCACAAA-3′ (fruFmut1fwd), 5′-GTACGCTGCCAGTATTGGTTCTT-3′ (fruFmut1rev), 5′-TCTGGCAGCTTACCTCAACCCGAACTGGGCC-3′ (fruFmut2fwd), 5′-GTAAGCTGCCAGAGCAGCTCCTCCGGGCAC-3′ (fruFmut2rev), 5′-TCAGGCAGCTTACTTCCCGTGCCCGGAGGAG-3′ (fruFmut3fwd), 5′-GTAAGCTGCCTGATATTCTCTTTCGATCTGG-3′ (fruFmut3rev), and 5′-CGAATTCGGTTGCATGTTCC-3′ (fruFrev). The cryptic splice site, aaa/gttagt (the slash indicates the exon/intron junction), was removed by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis, resulting in the deletion of nucleotides a/gt. The primers used for site-directed mutagenesis were as followed: 5′-ATTTAGGTGACACTATA-3′ (primer 1fwd), 5′-GCCCGGCAACCTAATAGTCCTTTCATTAG-3′ (primer 2rev), 5′-CTAATGAAAGGACTATTAGGTTGCCGGGC-3′ (primer 3fwd), and 5′-GCTCGAATTCGGTTGCATGTTCC-3′ (primer 4rev). The construct fruM+F1mut contains both male- and female-specific 5′-splice sites, but lacks the cryptic 5′-splice site. To generate fruM+F1mut, an insert containing the fru male-specific exonic and 5′-splice site sequences was generated by PCR amplification using fruM+Fwt (40Heinrichs V. Ryner L.C. Baker B.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 450-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as the template. The primer sequences used for amplification were 5′-GCCGCTCGAGTGCATTACGCGGCCTTGGACTT-3′ and 5′-GTAAGCTGCCTGATATTCTCTTTCGATCTGG-3′. The insert was XhoI/BbsI-digested and subcloned into fruM+F1R. A BglII/ClaI fragment containing the fru male-specific exonic and 5′-splice site sequences from fruM+F1R was then inserted 92 nucleotides upstream of a mutated 13-nucleotide repeat element to yield fruM+F1mut. The only 13-nucleotide repeat element present in this construct has been mutated as described for the fruFmut plasmids. In substrate fruF2Rs, two closely linked synthetic 13-nucleotide repeat elements replace the three dispersed 13-nucleotide repeat elements contained within the fruRE. To generate fruM+F2Rs, a BglII/ClaI fragment as described for fruM+F1mut was inserted into the EcoRV site of plasmid fruF2Rs that contains two tandem 13-nucleotide repeat elements ∼10 base pairs upstream of the female-specific 5′-splice site. The fru(70)M1 pre-mRNA was generated by PCR using the fruF construct as a template and the T7 primer and the 5′-BglII fru primer (5′-CCTAAAGATCTTACCCACAAAAAAAAACAA-3′). The PCR product from this reaction was digested with BglII and XhoI and cloned into pSP72-MS2 (23Graveley B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar) digested with XhoI and BamHI. The identities of all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. With the exception of fru(70)M1, all constructs were digested with XhoI to yield the SP6 RNA polymerase transcription templates. Capped, 32P-labeled RNAs were transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega). The fru(70)M1 construct was digested with XhoI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase. Transcripts were gel-purified on a 7 m urea and 4% polyacrylamide gel before use. In Vitro Splicing Assays—Conditions for in vitro splicing reactions were 30% HeLa nuclear extract (52Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar), 1 mm ATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 3.2 mm MgCl2, 5 units of RNasin (Promega), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 72.5 mm KCl, 3% polyvinyl alcohol (30–70 kDa), and 12 mm HEPES (pH 7.9). Reactions for TRA/TRA2-dependent substrates were performed in the absence or presence of 500 nm TRA/TRA2, unless otherwise stated. Splicing reactions were performed for 2 h at 30 °C. Following incubation, reactions were proteinase K-digested, phenol/chloroform-extracted, and ethanol-precipitated prior to PAGE separation. Bands were visualized and quantitated using PhosphorImager analysis (Bio-Rad). Percent spliced is defined as follows: spliced products/(unspliced product + spliced products). The background was determined individually for each lane because the total number of substrate and product counts varied throughout a time course. The -fold activation of the female-specific spliced product was calculated by dividing the percent female-specific spliced product in the presence of TRA/TRA2 by the percent female-specific spliced product in the absence of TRA/TRA2. Comparison of female- and male-specific (or cryptic) splice site strength was performed by taking the ratio of percent female-specific spliced product to percent cryptic spliced product in fruF. S100 complementation experiments were performed essentially as described above, except that 40% HeLa cell cytoplasmic extract (S100) was used instead of 30% nuclear extract. Reactions were complemented with varying amounts (0 – 800 nm) of the baculovirus-produced SR protein 9G8. In vitro splicing reactions using the MS2-RS fusion proteins were carried out using 15% HeLa cell nuclear extract as described (53Graveley B.R. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 765-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), except that the reactions were conducted for 4 h. Experiments were performed at least three times. Variations between experiments were within 2-fold. Proteins—The MS2, MS2-RSSF2/ASF, MS2-RSp55, and MS2-RS9G8 proteins were described previously (53Graveley B.R. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 765-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The isolation of recombinant TRA and TRA2 was performed according to previously described methods (28Tian M. Maniatis T. Science. 1992; 256: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In Vitro Splicing of fru Minigenes—As observed for dsx, the products of the sex determination genes tra and tra2 switch fru splicing from the male-specific pattern to the female-specific pattern through the activities of an ESE that contains multiple, near-identical 13-nucleotide repeat elements (38Ryner L.C. Goodwin S.F. Castrillon D.H. Anand A. Villella A. Baker B.S. Hall J.C. Taylor B.J. Wasserman S.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). However, whereas the dsx enhancer complex activates an alternative 3′-splice site, the fru enhancer complex activates an alternative 5′-splice site. To investigate the mechanisms of this process, an in vitro splicing system was established in which recombinant TRA/TRA2 could activate the female-specific 5′-splice site of fru. Similar to the successful approach taken to unravel the mechanisms of enhancer-dependent 3′-splice site activation in dsx, this assay relies on spliceosomal activities supplied from HeLa cell nuclear extract supplemented with the Drosophila-specific recombinant splicing factors TRA and TRA2 (28Tian M. Maniatis T. Science. 1992; 256: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Initially, two pre-mRNA substrates, fruF-long and fruF, were generated. Both substrates harbor the female-specific 5′-splice junction, an upstream region that contains all three 13-nucleotide repeat elements presumed to constitute the fruRE, and the common 3′-exon. The length of the intron was reduced from its natural span of 70,000 nucleotides to either 1200 or 640 nucleotides (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, in the absence of TRA and TRA2, the female-specific 5′-splice site of substrates fruF-long and fruF was not utilized (lanes 4, 5, 10, and 11). However, the addition of 500 nm TRA and TRA2 to the splicing reactions activated the female-specific 5′-splice site in each pre-mRNA (lanes 2, 3, 8, and 9). In addition to the TRA/TRA2-dependent female-specific splicing pathway, we routinely observed splicing to an upstream cryptic 5′-splice site located within the fruRE (Fig. 1, B and C). However, cryptic splicing was independent of the presence of TRA and TRA2. The identities of the female-specific and cryptic product bands as diagramed in Fig. 1 were established by band excision, reverse transcription-PCR, and sequencing of the amplification product (data not shown). Variation between independent experiments was observed to be within 2-fold. To evaluate the efficiency of TRA/TRA2-dependent splice site activation, a series of titration experiments were performed. As demonstrated in Fig. 1C (upper panel), high concentrations of TRA/TRA2 resulted in significant activation of the female-specific 5′-splice site. At lower concentrations of TRA/TRA2, the female-specific 5′-splice site was only marginally activated. These observations suggested that TRA and TRA2 cooperatively influence 5′-splice site choice. Indeed, quantitation of the data in Fig. 1C (lower panel) clearly illustrates the sigmoidal nature of the binding curve, characteristic of synergistic assembly of multicomponent complexes. These observations mirror the TRA/TRA2-dependent activation profile determined for dsx (51Hertel K.J. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 449-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), thus providing support for the notion that the dsxRE and fruRE assemble into highly related splicing complexes. Supplementation of splicing reactions with TRA alone did not lead to any measurable activation of the female-specific splice site (data not shown). The dsx pre-mRNA was used as a control to evaluate the activity of the recombinant proteins as well as to compare the efficiencies of TRA/TRA2-dependent splice site activation in the dsx and fru systems (data not shown). PhosphorImager analysis indicated similar splicing efficiencies between the fruF and dsx pre-mRNAs (∼50% spliced/unspliced at 2 h). However, the efficiency of fruF-long pre-mRNA splicing was observed to be ∼25%. Together, these results demonstrate that fru female-specific 5′-splice site activation can be faithfully recapitulated in vitro using HeLa cell nuclear extracts that are complemented with the Drosophila recombinant splicing activators TRA and TRA2. Relative Contribution of Each 13-Nucleotide Repeat Element to Female-specific 5′-Splice Site Activation—To study the relative contribution of each repeat element, a series of mutant fruF substrates were tested in the presence or absence of saturating concentrations of TRA/TRA2 (300 nm). The fruFmut1, fruFmut2, fruFmut3, fruFmut23, and fruFmut123 pre-mRNAs were derived from fruF by mutating the sequence of each 13-nucleotide repeat element (Fig. 2A) (see “Note Added in Proof ”). In the absence of TRA/TRA2, the female-specific 5′-splice site was not utilized in any of these constructs (Fig. 2B, lanes 1– 6). However, in the presence of TRA/TRA2, the female-specific 5′-splice site was activated for each pre-mRNA containing at least one 13-nucleotide repeat element (lanes 7–11). Moreover, there was no significant difference in the levels of TRA/TRA2-dependent femal"
https://openalex.org/W2077476712,"ICP8, the herpes simplex virus type-1 single-strand DNA-binding protein, was recently shown to promote strand exchange in conjunction with the viral replicative helicase (Nimonkar, A. V., and Boehmer, P. E. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 15182–15189). Here we show that ICP8 also catalyzes strand invasion in an ATP-independent manner. Thus, ICP8 promotes the assimilation of a single-stranded donor molecule into a homologous plasmid, resulting in the formation of a displacement loop. Invasion of a homologous duplex by single-stranded DNA requires homology at either 3′ or 5′ end of the invading strand. The reaction is dependent on the free energy of supercoiling and alters the topology of the acceptor plasmid. Hence, strand invasion products formed by ICP8 are resistant to the action of restriction endonucleases that cleave outside of the area of pairing. The ability to catalyze strand invasion is a novel activity of ICP8 and the first demonstration of a eukaryotic viral single-strand DNA-binding protein to promote this reaction. In this regard ICP8 is functionally similar to the prototypical prokaryotic recombinase RecA and its eukaryotic homologs. This strand invasion activity of ICP8 coupled with DNA synthesis may explain the high prevalence of branched DNA structures during viral replication."

Although the importance of Rrn3 function in rDNA transcription is well established, its mechanism of action has not been determined. It has been suggested that the phosphorylation of either yeast RNA polymerase I or mammalian Rrn3 regulates the formation of RNA polymerase I·Rrn3 complexes that can interact with the committed template. These and other reported differences would have implications with respect to the mechanism by which Rrn3 functions in transcription. For example, in the yeast rDNA transcription system, Rrn3 might function catalytically, but in the mammalian system it might function stoichiometrically. Thus, we examined the question as to whether Rrn3 functions catalytically or stoichiometrically. We report that mammalian Rrn3 becomes the limiting factor as transcription reactions proceed. Moreover, we demonstrate that Rrn3 is inactivated during the transcription reactions. For example, Rrn3 isolated from a reaction that had undergone transcription cannot activate transcription in a subsequent reaction. We also show that this inactivated Rrn3 not only dissociates from RNA polymerase I, but is not capable of forming a stable complex with RNA polymerase I. Our results indicate that Rrn3 functions stoichiometrically in rDNA transcription and that its ability to associate with RNA polymerase I is lost upon transcription.

Both the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) promoter and RNA polymerase I have to be “transcription ready,” and they must join together to form a functional initiation complex. The assembly of the intermediate and final complexes involved in this process requires a complex series of protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. For example, the stable binding of the transcription factors to the rDNA promoter requires the coordinate binding of factors to the core and upstream promoter elements (1Paule M.R.

Despite this body of knowledge, there are still significant controversies concerning the role that Rrn3 plays in transcription.Fath et al. (30Fath S. Milkereit P. Peyroche G. Riva M. Carles C. Tschochner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14334-14339Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) proposed that the phosphorylation of yeast RNA pol I regulates the formation of a functional initiation complex between RNA pol I and Rrn3. In contrast, our recently published data (28Cavanaugh A.H. Hirschler-Laszkiewicz I. Hu Q. Dundr M. Smink T. Misteli T. Rothblum L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27423-27432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) indicate that the phosphorylation state of mammalian Rrn3 regulates this process. Aprikian et al. (31Aprikian P. Moorefield B. Reeder R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4847-4855Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) reported that yeast RNA pol I could be recruited to the rDNA promoter in the absence of Rrn3. However, they noted that these complexes could not be converted to transcriptionally active complexes when Rrn3 was added to the reactions. In contrast Schnapp et al., (32Schnapp A. Schnapp G. Erny B. Grummt I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6723-6732Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) reported that mammalian “TIF-IA (Rrn3) is liberated from the initiation complex and facilitates transcription from templates bearing preinitiation complexes which lack TIF-IA.” This observation is significantly different from the Aprikian model. In addition, it suggests that Rrn3 functions catalytically. This is in contrast to earlier observations that factor C*, a factor that shares many properties with Rrn3, functioned stoichiometrically (33Brun R.P. Ryan K. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5010-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As these differences would have significant implications with respect to the mechanism by which Rrn3 functions in transcription, we examined the question as to whether Rrn3 functions catalytically or stoichiometrically.A catalyst is defined as an element that modifies the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed in the process, and without being changed by the consequences of the process. Rrn3 was shown (28Cavanaugh A.H. Hirschler-Laszkiewicz I. Hu Q. Dundr M. Smink T. Misteli T. Rothblum L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27423-27432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) to undergo modifications that are possibly the consequence of transcription. In this study we present evidence that Rrn3 is consumed during transcription and cannot be directly “reused” in a second round of transcription. We also demonstrate that Rrn3 dissociates from pol I as a consequence of transcription. These observations provide evidence that Rrn3 serves a stoichiometric rather then catalytic function in RNA pol I transcription. This in turn supports our hypothesis that the post-translational modification of Rrn3 plays an active role in the formation of the functional Rrn3·pol I complex in mammalian cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Treatment with Cycloheximide—N1S1 cells were grown in RPMI1640 + 5% fetal bovine serum (34Hannan R.D.

Where indicated, cells were treated with cycloheximide, 2 μg/ml (Sigma) for one hour.Production of Recombinant rpa43 and Rrn3 in Sf9 Cells and Protein Purification—S, FLAG-tagged Rrn3 and S, His rpa43 were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified using anti-FLAG agarose beads (Sigma) or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) as previously described (28Cavanaugh A.H.

To recover recombinant FLAG-tagged Rrn3 from the in vitro transcription reactions, the 200-μl reactions were diluted 2.5-fold by adding 300 μl of transcription buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 6% glycerol. The NaCl concentration was then adjusted to a final concentration of 150 mm. Both changes were necessary for the optimal binding of Rrn3 to anti-FLAG beads. 10 μl of packed anti-FLAG agarose beads were added to each reaction, and the reaction tubes were tumbled for two hours at 4 °C. After the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100), Rrn3 was eluted with 30 μl of 0.5 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). The protein was used immediately for the second round of transcription, Western blot analysis, or co-immunoprecipitation with rpa43.Purification of UBF and SL—UBF and SL1 were purified by DEAE Sephadex and heparin agarose chromatography as described previously (35Smith S.

UBF was eluted from the heparin agarose column with 600 mm KCl, whereas SL-1 was eluted with 1000 mm KCl. At these stages of purification there is no detectable Rrn3 or pol I in either the UBF or SL-1 preparations (data not shown).Co-immunoprecipitation of Rrn3/RNA Pol I—Rrn3 that had been incubated in a transcription reaction was then incubated with anti-FLAG beads and eluted with FLAG peptide. 30 μl of eluted Rrn3 (∼7 μg) was mixed with 100 μl(∼100 μg) of recombinant rpa43 and tumbled at 4 °C overnight in a final volume of 100 μl of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 6% glycerol. Anti-FLAG agarose beads were added and the mixture tumbled for two hours at 4 °C. The beads were then washed as described above and Rrn3 eluted with FLAG peptide. The protein was used immediately for Western blot analysis.rDNA Transcription Templates—pU5.1E/X contains the rat 45 S rDNA (-286 to + 630) promoter and pUE/B is a PCR product of the rat 45 S rDNA (-279 to + 480) promoter. When truncated with EcoRI the transcript from pU5.1E/X is 632, and that from pUE/B is 480 nts (35Smith S. Oriahi E. Lowe D. Yang-Yen H.F. O'Mahony D. Rose K. Chen C. Rothblum L.I. Mol. Cell.

Polyclonal rabbit antisera to the 194-kDa (β′) and 127-kDa (β) subunits of pol I have been described previously (34Hannan R.D. Hempel W.M. Cavanaugh A. Arino T. Dimitrov S. Moss T. Rothblum L. J.

Polyclonal, rabbit antisera to Rrn3 and rpa43 were raised to purified, recombinant Rrn3 or rpa43, respectively. S peptide conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (S-HRP conjugate, Novagen) was used as recommended by the suppliers. Monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies were used as recommended by the supplier (Sigma).RESULTSCycloheximide Inactivates Rrn3—We have previously reported that whole cell extracts prepared from CHX-treated cells cannot support transcription in vitro and that transcription activity can be restored by addition of Rrn3 (28Cavanaugh A.H. Hirschler-Laszkiewicz I. Hu Q. Dundr M. Smink T. Misteli T. Rothblum L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27423-27432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, our evidence is consistent with the model that treatment with cycloheximide results in the inactivation of mammalian Rrn3. However, it is possible that cycloheximide inactivates rDNA transcription through another pathway, and the rescue of rDNA transcription by exogenous Rrn3 is due to a redundancy in the mechanism of rDNA transcription, i.e. Rrn3 can replace another component. To test this model we isolated Rrn3 from cells treated with cycloheximide and from control cells (Fig. 1A). 3T3 cells were transfected with pCDNA3.1FLAG-Rrn3 as described previously (28Cavanaugh A.H. Hirschler-Laszkiewicz I. Hu Q. Dundr M. Smink T. Misteli T. Rothblum L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27423-27432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours later, one half of the cells were treated with cycloheximide for one hour. Rrn3 was purified from whole cell extracts of both groups of cells by immuno-affinity purification using immobilized anti-FLAG antibodies (28Cavanaugh A.H. Hirschler-Laszkiewicz I. Hu Q. Dundr M. Smink T. Misteli T. Rothblum L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27423-27432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of the two forms of Rrn3 were added to extracts from cycloheximide-treated cells to determine whether they were equally active in transcription (Fig. 1B). The observation that Rrn3 purified from cells treated with cycloheximide (lane 3) was <5% as active as the Rrn3 purified from untreated cells (lane 4) provided additional evidence that treatment with cycloheximide resulted in the inhibition of Rrn3 activity. Moreover, when this result is considered with other observations, it is consistent with the model that the only component of the rDNA transcription apparatus that is inactivated in extracts from cycloheximide-treated cells is Rrn3.Rrn3 Is the Limiting Factor in in Vitro Transcription Assays—The question as to whether Rrn3 functions catalytically or stoichiometrically has been examined indirectly (32Schnapp A. Schnapp G. Erny B. Grummt I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6723-6732Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and those authors reported data consistent with a model in which Rrn3 functions catalytically. As this question has a significant effect on our understanding of the mechanisms involved in transcription initiation we examined this question using three different approaches.Our first series of experiments were based on the premise that if Rrn3 undergoes some inactivation as the result of transcription, it should become limiting in the transcription reaction as time proceeds and transcription should plateau. In turn, transcription should resume when the reaction was supplemented with Rrn3 (Fig. 2A). In a typical transcription reaction, the accumulation of transcription products reached a plateau by 30 min (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–5). If Rrn3 was inactivated during transcription, then the addition of Rrn3 should cause transcription to begin again. As shown, the addition of Rrn3 to a transcription reaction, which had been incubated for 60 min, stimulated transcription (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 6, 7, and 8 with lane 3). In a second set of experiments (Fig. 2C), we compared the levels of transcript accumulated in reactions that were supplemented with Rrn3 after 60 min of transcription to the amount that might accumulate if Rrn3 was not added. The levels of transcript that accumulated under those conditions were compared with the levels that accumulated in standard reactions that had run for 30 or 60 min (lanes 1 and 2) in the presence of [α32-P]UTP. The second group of reactions was allowed to proceed for 60 min in the absence of radioactive probe (lanes 3 and 4). After 60 min of transcription, [α32-P]UTP was added to both reactions, and transcription was allowed to proceed for an additional 30 min. Rrn3 was added to only one reaction (lane 4). When the transcription reactions were complete, the in vitro synthesized RNA was isolated, fractionated by urea-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. The absence of transcript in lane 3 suggests that an essential component(s) was consumed during the first 60 min of reaction. The observation that transcripts accumulated when the reaction was supplemented with Rrn3 at the same time as isotope was added (lane 4), suggests that Rrrn3 was the “consumed” component. Taken together the results shown in Fig. 2 demonstrate that Rrn3 is inactivated or consumed as a result of transcription.Fig. 2Rrn3 becomes a limiting factor during transcription in vitro.A, schematic depicting the theoretical result of adding recombinant Rrn3 to a transcription reaction after 60 min, assuming that Rrn3 has become rate-limiting. B, transcription reactions, prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” using 5 μl of control N1S1 S-100 extract, to which recombinant Rrn3 was added as indicated. Lanes 1–5 show a time course without addition of Rrn3. Reaction time was 5, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. Lanes 6–8 show the reactions that were run for additional 15, 30, or 60 min after adding 100 ng of Rrn3 at 60 min. C, transcription reactions were performed using 5 μl of cycloheximide-treated S-100 N1S1 protein extract, 1.5 ng of recombinant Rrn3 and 0.1 μg template pU5.1E/X. Lanes 1 and 2 show reactions run for 30 and 60 min. Lanes 3 and 4 show reactions that were run for 60 min without isotope. Isotope was added at 60 min along with 0.5 ng Rrn3 (lane 4) or without Rrn3 (lane 3), and transcription was allowed to proceed for another 15 min. Transcription reactions, purification of the in vitro synthesized RNA, and PAGE analysis of the transcription reactions were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Trans., the 632-nt transcript that results from correct initiation.

Two templates, distinguished by the sizes of the transcripts they support, were used in these assays (template 1, p5.1E/X, 632 nt transcript; and template 2, pUE/B, 480 nt transcript). The first experiments used extracts from cycloheximide-treated cells as the use of unfractionated extracts avoids artifacts associated with purification and fractionation. As shown in Fig. 3, if both templates are added at the same time, both are transcribed (lane 1). However, if the reaction is incubated with only one template followed by the addition of the second template after 60 min (followed in turn by an additional 30 min of transcription), transcription is only observed from the template that was incubated with Rrn3 first (template 1, lanes 2 and 3). When the second template 2 was added together with Rrn3, again both templates are transcribed (lane 4). These data suggest that, under these conditions, Rrn3 mediates an essential transcription step and is the limiting component in the transcription reaction.Fig. 3Rrn3 commits to the template.Upper panel, a schematic depicting the experimental protocol. Lower panel, once Rrn3 is preincubated with one template it does not support transcription from a second template (lanes 2 and 3). Template 2 was added to the reaction either at the same time as template 1 (lane 1) or 60 min after reaction was started (lanes 2–4). Template 2 was added in the mixture containing additional 7 ng Rrn3 (lane 4) or without Rrn3 (lanes 1, 2, and 3). All assays contained 7 ng of FLAG-tagged Rrn3 and 5 μl of S-100 extract from CHX-treated cells. Trans. 1, the 632-nt transcript that results from the correct initiation on template 1.

When purified, Rrn3, SL1, and UBF were added to an in vitro reaction mixture containing S-100 from CHX-treated N1S1 (as a source of RNA pol I) and either template 1 or 2, each template was transcribed (lanes 2 and 3 and 5 and 6). If both templates (Temp 1 and 2) were added at time 0, both templates are transcribed (lane 7). However, if the second template mixture containing SL1 and UBF is added after 20, 40, or 60 min, only the first (Temp 1) template is transcribed (lanes 8–10). As SL1 and UBF were added along with the second template, they are not limiting factors in these reactions. This suggests that once Rrn3 commits to the initiation complex, it cannot contribute to transcription from a second template.Fig. 4Rrn3, and not SL1 and UBF, determines the formation of the preinitiation complex.Upper panel, a schematic depicting the experimental protocol. Lower panel, in vitro transcription assays were performed using FLAG-tagged Rrn3, 5 μl CHX S-100 extract, and 10 μl of each chromatography fraction HS 600 (purified UBF), and HS 1000 (purified SL1). Template 1 (100 ng) was added to the reaction either at the same time as template 2 (30 ng) (lane 7) or at varying times after transcription was started (20, 40, or 60 min, lanes 8–10, respectively), and transcription was allowed to proceed for an additional 30 min for a total of 50, 70, and 90 min, respectively. Template 1 was added in the mixture containing an additional 10 μl each of UBF and SL1 fraction. Lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6 show each template transcribed separately.

We report here NMR identification of the hierarchy of early conformational transitions (folding propensities) in HIV-1 protease by systematic monitoring of the changes in the state of the protein as it is subjected to different degrees of denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride. Secondary chemical shifts, HN-Hα coupling constants, 1H-15N nuclear Overhauser effects, and 15N transverse relaxation parameters have been used to report on the residual structural propensities, motional restrictions, conformational transitions, etc., and the data suggest that even under the strongest denaturing conditions (6 m guanidine) hydrophobic clusters as well as different native and non-native secondary structural elements are transiently formed. These constitute the folding nuclei, which include residues spanning the active site, the hinge region, and the dimerization domain. Interestingly, the proline residues influence the structural propensities, and the small amino acids, Gly and Ala, enhance the flexibility of the protein. On reducing the denaturing conditions, partially folded forms appear. The residues showing high folding propensities are contiguous along the sequence at many locations or are in close proximity on the native protein structure, suggesting a certain degree of local cooperativity in the conformational transitions. The dimerization domain, the flaps, and their hinges seem to exhibit the highest folding propensities. The data suggest that even the early folding events may involve many states near the surface of the folding funnel.

The data suggest that even the early folding events may involve many states near the surface of the folding funnel. The folding of a protein is conceptually described in terms of a folding funnel (1Dill K.A. Chan H.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar, 2Plotkin S.S.

Sci. 2000; 25: 331-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The narrow end of the funnel represents the folded native state, and the broad end represents the unfolded state consisting of millions of rapidly inter-converting conformers. As a protein folds from an unfolded state, it goes through one or more partially folded intermediates, which need to be characterized for elucidation of its folding pathways. Experimentally, this is a very challenging task. The most common and direct approach relies on kinetic pulse labeling experiments of amide protons coupled with hydrogen exchange at different time points along the folding reaction of the protein (reviewed in Ref. 7Englander S.W. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 213-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). However, as has been pointed out (8Raschke T.M. Kho J. Marqusee S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), this also has limitations. First, it is limited by the necessity of detectable protection against exchange. Second, any lack of protection does not necessarily imply absence of structure. Third, it biases the interpretation of the structure in intermediates toward the native state. Even so, useful information has been obtained in many protein systems (7Englander S.W. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 213-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). However, this approach is complicated in the case of proteases with autolytic property, because the autolytic reaction interferes with interpretation of the hydrogen exchange data. Therefore, in these systems it becomes necessary to look for alternative experimental avenues. Several equilibrium, real-time NMR, and kinetic pulse labeling studies (8Raschke T.M. Kho J. Marqusee S.

That means characterization of the partially unfolded states created by denaturants can provide useful insights into the structural features of the kinetic intermediates. Further, the progressive folding of a protein will be associated with significant changes in its internal dynamics at all time scales (pico- to milleseconds). The fully unfolded state is highly dynamic with motions occurring mostly on picosecond time scales. Any restriction in the motions implies transient ordering of the polypeptide chain. As the protein starts to fold, more and more structure-forming breaking events (milli- to microsecond time scale) occur, and these lead to an increase in the slow motions. Thus a systematic monitoring of these graded changes in the motional characteristics as well as in the residual structures along the polypeptide chain under different conditions of denaturation provides very valuable information on the hierarchy of folding propensities in a protein. Following these ideas, we describe below NMR identification of the hierarchy of folding propensities in HIV-1 1The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NOE, nuclear Overhauser enhancement. protease, using a tethered dimer construct of the protein in which the two monomers are joined head-to-tail by a flexible linker GGSSG; this protein, hereafter referred to as HIVTD, folds similarly to the native homodimer in vitro (23Pillai B.

NMR Experiments—Isotopically 15N-labeled HIV-1 protease-tethered dimer for the NMR experiments was prepared as described earlier (25Bhavesh N.S. Panchal S.C. Mittal R. Hosur R.V. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded with 1.0–1.2 mm protein samples in NMR buffer (50 mm acetate, 150 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, pH 5.2) containing different concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride at 32 °C. For the high resolution data required for coupling constant measurements, 16,384 and 512 complex points were acquired along t2 and t1 dimensions, respectively. For the relaxation measurements 2,048 and 512 complex points were collected along the two dimensions. For R2 measurements, the following Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) delays were used: 8.352, 25.056, 41.760, 66.816, 83.357, 116.928, 141.984, and 192.096 ms and spectra duplicated at 25.056 and 83.357 ms. R2 values were extracted by fitting the peak intensities to the equation I(t) = B exp (–R2t). 1H-15N heteronuclear NOE data were collected with a 3-s relaxation delay and 2-s presaturation of the protons. The equilibrium experiment was performed with a 5-s relaxation delay. The NOEs were calculated as peak intensity ratios, Isat/Ieq, where Isat is the peak intensity in the spectrum with proton saturation and Ieq is the peak intensity in the equilibrium experiment. The experiments were carried out using the pulse sequences described by Farrow et al. (26Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). All the experiments were performed on a 600 MHz Varian Unity plus spectrometer, and the data were processed using FELIX on a Silicon Graphic, Inc. work station. Analysis of the primary structure of HIVTD to locate hydrophobic clusters was carried using the program HCA_Draw (27Gaboriaud C. Bissery V. Benchetrit T. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). NMR Spectral Features of the Denatured States of HIVTD—We first monitored the changes in the state of the protease when guanidine denaturant concentration was systematically decreased from 6 to 1 m (Fig. 1A). At 6 m, the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum was characteristic of an unfolded state. As the guanidine concentration was reduced to 5 m, the 6 m peaks were still present, but additional peaks appeared (see below). The protein was, however, still intact (Fig. 1A). At 3 m guanidine, a coexistence of folded (or partially folded) and unfolded species was seen; as the concentration was further reduced, the protein started showing protease activity. Characteristic tryptophan side chain peaks of auto-cleavage products were seen in the HSQC spectrum and, also, auto-cleavage products were seen by gel electrophoresis. The autolytic activity increased progressively as the guanidine concentration was further reduced. Therefore, to gain mechanistic insight into the early hierarchical folding events in the protein we investigated the structural and dynamic characteristics of the protein at 6 and 5 m guanidine concentrations, under which conditions the protein still remains intact. Fig. 1B shows comparison of a section of the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the protein at 6 and 5 m guanidine concentrations. The number of peaks in the 6 m spectrum is as must be expected from the equivalence of residues in the two halves of the tethered dimer. All the peaks present in the 6 m spectrum are also present in the 5 m spectrum at almost identical positions, barring a few which show small shifts. This allowed an easy transfer of assignments (6 m assignments have already been reported (25Bhavesh N.S. Panchal S.C. Mittal R. Hosur R.V. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Besides, there are several weaker peaks, which suggest the presence of some partially folded forms. Keeping in mind that the denatured and partially folded states are highly dynamic and heterogeneous, one can envisage that the partially folded states could be in slow exchange with the “6 m denatured state.” Though intuitively one may assign these additional peaks to their nearest neighbors, there could be more than one partially folded species existing simultaneously in solution and the peaks could correspond to different ones. The presence of these peaks indicates that the state identified by the conserved peaks in the two spectra would have differences in the dynamic characteristics under 6 and 5 m guanidine conditions. This is also evident from the fact that the peak resolution in the 5 m spectrum is much less, which must be attributed to reduced coupling constants or increased line width because of conformational exchange or both. We have monitored these differences using a variety of NMR parameters, which provide valuable insight into the folding conformational transitions in the protein. Local Structural Preferences in 6 m Guanidine: Folding Nuclei—A large body of evidence in the literature indicates that the denatured state is not a random coil but contains some residual structure or at least some local structural preferences in an otherwise heterogeneous dynamic model (28Richards F.M. Eisenberg D.S. Kuriyan J. Adv. Prot. Chemistry: Unfolded Proteins. 42. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002Google Scholar). Certain regions of (φ,ψ) dihedral angle space may exhibit higher probabilities than others in the Ramachandran plot (29Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2770) Google Scholar). These are believed to be the folding nuclei or the regions where the initial folding events occur in the polypeptide chain. Detailed characterization of the residual structures in the denatured states of proteins is generally obtained from residue-wise (Cα, Hα, Cβ, CO) chemical shift deviations from random coil values (secondary shifts), HN-Hα coupling constants, amide proton temperature coefficients, and in favorable cases the amide proton protections against deuterium exchange (30Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Although both the secondary chemical shifts and HN-Hα coupling constants reflect the secondary structural propensities, the former are much more sensitive and reflect even very small population differences in the (φ,ψ) space. On the other hand, the amide temperature coefficients (less than ∼7 ppb/K) indicate hydrogen bonding and thus report on the presence of persistent structures (30Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In the present case we monitored the carbon secondary chemical shifts, the HN-Hα coupling constants, and the amide proton temperature coefficients in HIVTD, and a part of their analysis has been described earlier (25Bhavesh N.S. Panchal S.C. Mittal R. Hosur R.V. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As mentioned in that study, the sequence-corrected (31Schwarzinger S. Kroon G.J.A. Foss T.R. Chung J. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2970-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) Cα chemical shifts were the most diagnostic of secondary structures because of their insensitivity to the choice of the reference set of values for the random coil chemical shifts. These results (taken from Ref. 25Bhavesh N.S. Panchal S.C. Mittal R. Hosur R.V. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) along with the complete results for coupling constants and amide proton temperature coefficients are shown in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2A, the Cα secondary shifts are seen to be large for many residues and show substantial sequence dependence. Positive deviations indicate preferences in (φ,ψ) values belonging to the α-helical structures; the negative values indicate preferences for the (φ,ψ) values belonging to the β structures. Thus, we see β propensities for the residues, Pro-1, Val-3, Leu-5, Gln-7, Glu-21, Asp-25, Glu-34, Ser-37, Lys-43-Pro-44, Phe-53, Lys-55, Val-56, Ile-66, His-69, and Pro-79-Ile-84, and α propensities for the residues, Arg-8, Leu-10, Leu-24, Gly-40, Gln-61, Leu-63, Glu-65, Cys-67, Gly-68, Asn-88, Leu-90, and Gln-92. The secondary structure elements in the native protein are shown on the top of the figure for ready comparison. Clearly, all the β propensities and the α propensity in the region Asn-88-Gln-92 are native-like, and the remaining preferences, which are α type, are non-native. At this stage we may ask whether tethering of the two monomers by the flexible linker GGSSG in HIVTD has any influence on the structural propensities. One may expect to observe these influences at the C-terminal of the first monomer and the N-terminal of the second monomer. In the NMR spectra we do observe separate peaks for the residues Pro-1, Gln-2, Val-3, Thr-96, Leu-97, and Asn-98 from the two monomers; the secondary shifts for these residues are also slightly different, as indicated by filled bars in Fig. 2A. However, the shifts for the C-terminal residues are very small for both the monomers, but the shifts for the N-terminal residues Pro-1 and Val-3 are large for both. This indicates that the observed propensities are primarily dictated by the intrinsic sequence and the tethering has only a small influence, if at all. However, as we shall discuss below, the tethering may have some influence on the motional characteristics, because of local interactions of the residues around the linker. The residue-wise HN-Hα coupling constants in HIVTD in 6 m guanidine measured from the fine structures of the peaks in the HSQC spectra are shown in Fig. 2B. The values range from 5.5 to 9.0 Hz with an average close to 7 Hz. This is typical of random coils, and the small variations observed are within the ranges expected from sequence dependence of these coupling constants (32Penkett C.J. Redfield C. Dodd I. Hubbard J. McBay D.L. Mossakowska D.E. Smith R.A.G. Dobson C.M. Smith L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus the observed coupling constants here do not show any specific secondary structural preferences, which is in contrast to the results from secondary chemical shifts. However, such differences have been seen in many proteins, leading to the belief that the coupling constants are less sensitive to small variations in the (φ,ψ) populations and hence are less diagnostic (30Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Fig. 2C shows the residue-wise amide proton temperature coefficients in the HIVTD protein in 6 m guanidine. For most residues the values are in the range 7–9 ppb/K, with an average at 8 ppb/K. This is typical of amide protons exposed to the solvent and not involved in any kind of H-bonds. Thus it appears that there are no persistent structures in the protein in 6 m guanidine. Examination of the local structural preferences derived from the secondary chemical shifts in the protein in the light of its primary structure reveals an interesting correlation: many of the preferences are seen to be associated with prolines. In the primary sequence, prolines are located at positions 1, 9, 39, 44, 79, and 81. Of these, Pro-9 and -39 seem to induce α-helical propensity in the neighboring residues. On the other hand, all the other prolines are associated with β propensities. Thus, it appears that in HIVTD, the prolines may play a major role in dictating the initial folding events when the folding starts from an unfolded state. The different native and non-native folding nuclei described above, along with the locations of the prolines, are depicted on the native protein structure in Fig. 3. Interestingly, these cover the residues at the dimer interface and in the hinge region of the native protein structure. This suggests that native-like folding of active site residues and perhaps active site formation may be an early event in the folding of HIVTD. Motional Characteristics in 6 m Guanidine—1H-15N heteronuclear NOEs and 15N transverse relaxation rates (R2) provide most valuable information on the backbone motions of the individual NH vectors at different time scales. Although the heteronuclear NOEs are most sensitive to motions on the pico- to nanosecond time scales, the transverse relaxation rates are sensitive also to slow motions and conformational transitions occurring on milli- to-microsecond time scale. In many instances these have provided valuable insights into sequence-dependent motional restrictions and flexibilities in denatured proteins, which in turn provide clues to the folding mechanisms (33Kazmirski S.L.

A close correlation was observed between the regions of nanosecond-restricted motions and the locations of hydrophobic clusters (35Eliezer D. Chung J. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2894-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 36Yao J. Chung J. Eliezer D. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12681-12686Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), which led to the suggestion that transient hydrophobic clustering caused by local side chain interactions may drive the early folding events. In denatured apomyoglobin, a correlation was also observed between the regions of greater flexibilities and locations of the small amino acid residues glycine and alanine, which led to the suggestion that these residues serve as molecular hinges in the folding process of the protein (38Schwarzinger S. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12681-12686Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The 1H-15N heteronuclear NOEs for the different residues in HIVTD in 6 m guanidine are shown in Fig. 4A. As against a typical flat bell-shaped profile expected of fully denatured proteins, we observe a definite pattern of positive and negative NOEs, which seems to suggest the presence of motionally restricted (positive NOE) as well as highly flexible (negative NOE) regions along the polypeptide chain. Assuming that a group of at least three residues of similar motional properties in close vicinity may be taken to define a local domain, we identified domains of restricted motions (N1-N5), and domains of flexibilities (f1 and f2)(Fig. 4A); note that N5 has only two residues, but this has been included because of the large magnitude of the NOE. These regions of restricted motions are indicative of side chain interactions, which cause local transient ordering and thus would play important roles in directing the folding process of the protein. Interestingly, both the N- and C-terminal residues exhibit motional restrictions. One may think that because these groups of residues are engaged in a β-sheet in the dimerization domain of the native protein structure there may be a propensity for native-like dimer formation even in 6 m guanidine. Alternatively, it is possible that because of the tethering of the two monomers in HIVTD, which brings the C-terminal of the first monomer close to the N-terminal of the second monomer, there may be local interactions, resulting in restriction of motions. In fact, both mechanisms may be operative, the latter driving the former, because the polypeptide chain has an intrinsic tendency to form a specific dimer. The 15N transverse relaxation rates (R2) for the different residues in HIVTD in 6 m guanidine are shown in Fig. 4B. Here again we observe substantial sequence-dependent variation, indicating variations in motional flexibilities. The values range from 1.0 to 7.8 s–1, with an average around 3.8 s–1. Low R2 values indicate high flexibilities, whereas large R2 values indicate restricted motions on nanosecond time scales and also possible contributions from conformational transitions on milli- to microsecond time scale. As in the case of 1H-15N NOEs, we identified domains of restricted motions, M1–10, on the basis of the R2 values. Of these, M1, -2, -4, -8, and 10 overlap with N1, -2, -4, and -5 domains observed from NOE, but M5, -6, and -7 overlap with f1, -2 domains of high flexibility observed from NOE. This suggests that conformational transitions occurring on the milli- to microsecond time scale, which are not sensed by the 1H-15N NOEs, make significant contributions to the R2 values. The average R2 value in all the domains M1–10 is roughly the same, implying that all of them have contributions from slow motions. Incidentally, in denatured apomyoglobin (8 m urea, pH 2.3) where there was no evidence for milli- to microsecond time scale motions, the domains of restricted motion derived from both 1H-15N NOE and 15N R2 were identical (38Schwarzinger S. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12681-12686Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the light of earlier reports (35Eliezer D. Chung J. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12681-12686Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) that hydrophobic interactions restrict the motions, we calculated the hydrophobic clusters along the sequence of the protein using the program HCA_Draw (27Gaboriaud C. Bissery V. Benchetrit T. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). These are shown by black bars (C1–7) at the bottom in Fig. 4A. The domains N1, -3, -4, and -5 in Fig. 4A and domains M1–3, M7–10 in Fig. 4B overlap with many of the hydrophobic clusters, though partially in a few cases. This positive correlation between restricted motion and hydrophobic clustering is in accordance with earlier observations on other proteins and suggests that side chain interactions do play a major role in local transient ordering of the protein chain. At the same time, N2 in Fig. 4A and M4–6 in Fig. 4B do not overlap with any cluster. These observations seem to lend partial support to the model of protein folding in which an initial hydrophobic collapse occurs following removal of denaturant; in the present case C1, -2, -3, -7, and parts of C4, -5 along the polypeptide chain are involved. The motional restriction in N2 and in M4–6 seems to occur through some other kind of local transient structure formation. Many residues in HIVTD exhibit extremely low R2 values, less than 2 s–1, (Fig. 4B). These are indicative of very high flexibility; interestingly, this coincides with the positions of glycines and alanines (shown by filled and open circles respectively) along the chain. This lends support to the model proposed by Schwarzinger et al. (38Schwarzinger S. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12681-12686Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) that Gly and Ala residues act as molecular hinges in the folding mechanism of a protein. Conformational Transitions along the Folding Funnel— When the denaturing conditions are made slightly milder, the protein treks along the folding funnel. As mentioned before, at 5 m guanidine, the 6 m peaks in the HSQC spectrum are nearly conserved, and additional peaks corresponding to other partially folded conformers appear. This indicates that the secondary structural propensities of the conserved species, between 6 and 5 m guanidine, could only be marginally different. However, there could be dynamics differences, which would reflect on the conformational transitions on the folding funnel. We have monitored these effects from the changes in the residue-wise HN-Hα coupling constants and 15N transverse relaxation rates as described below. The differences in these parameters are also qualitatively evident in Fig. 1B itself. Fig. 5A shows the changes in the coupling constants along the sequence of the protein as we go from 6 to 5 m guanidine. The changes are clearly not random, and there seems to be a decrease in the coupling constant for all the residues (barring a few). This would indicate a slight increase in the helical propensity for most residues in 5 m guanidine. Comparing with Fig. 2A, we observe that the stretch Thr-12–Asp-60, which has very little structural propensity in 6 m guanidine, barring a few residues (Glu-21, Leu-24, Asp-25) near the active site and a few near the hinge region (Glu-34, Ser-37, Gln-40, Lys-43, Pro-44), acquires some preferences in 5 m guanidine. This is a reflection on the hierarchy of the folding events. The 15N transverse relaxation rates showed a substantial increase in 5 m guanidine conditions for 75% of the residues, and the average R2 value was higher by about 30%. A large portion of this increase may possibly come from assembly of the two monomeric halves into the dimer, which may be facilitated because of the head-to-tail covalent linkage through the linker in HIVTD. This transient assembly results in increased line widths. Such a conclusion is based on the observation that as the guanidine concentration is further reduced the protein starts acquiring autolytic activity (Fig. 1), implying that a proper specific dimer is being formed even in the presence of certain concentrations of the denaturant. However, as can be seen in Fig. 5B the changes in the R2 values in going from 6 to 5 m guanidine are sequence-specific, and this reflects on the hierarchy of conformational transitions or folding propensities in the protein. In the completely unfolded state, which represents an ensemble of rapidly inter-converting conformers, there are very few exchange contributions to the transverse relaxation rate. As the protein starts folding searching for the stable configurations, conformational transitions start getting slower and then they contribute to the line widths reflected in the R2 values. This can happen in a sequence-specific manner. As more and more contacts get established, the contributions of slow exchanges would tend to increase and spread along the sequence. Thus, under conditions which are still near the unfolded state where the protein is still dynamic and heterogeneous (note, the fully folded state also has minimal conformational exchange contributions to the R2 values), the relative magnitudes of the changes in R2 values (ΔR2) in going from 6 to 5 m guanidine, along the sequence of the polypeptide chain, would reflect on the susceptibilities to local transient order formation or susceptibilities to folding conformational transitions. This will continue until persistent stable structures are formed, and then again there would be minimal exchange contributions. Referring to Fig. 5B, we can group the residues on the basis of increase in R2 values (s–1) to three ranges, 3.0–4.5, 1.5–3.0, and 0.0–1.5. This can be taken to identify the residue-level hierarchy of folding propensities. However, the third range (0.0–1.5) is roughly similar to the errors in R2 measurements and hence may not be considered significant. Thus, it follows that residues Gln-2, Val-3, Gln-7, Gly-16, Gln-18, Met-36, Gly-40, Arg-41, Gly-48, Ile-50, Val-56, Gln-92, Ile-93 (ΔR2 = 3.0–4.5 s–1) have the highest propensities for conformational transitions, followed by residues Trp-6, Ala-22, Thr-26, Val-32, Trp-42, Lys-43, Gly-51, Arg-57, Asp-60, Gly-78, Leu-97, Asn-98, Phe-99 (ΔR2 = 1.5–3.0 s–1) at the second level. Many of these residues overlap with the hydrophobic clusters in Fig. 4A, indicating that conformational transitions may be driven by changes in the side chain interactions among hydrophobic residues when the denaturant concentrations are changed. Fig. 5C shows these hierarchical folding regions in a color-coded manner on the structure of the native protein. It is noteworthy that the residues involved in these hierarchical conformational transitions are either contiguous or are in close spatial proximity on the structure, suggesting a kind of cooperativity in the folding process. These conformational transitions could involve both formation of native contacts as well as destruction of the non-native contacts. Interestingly, the dimerization domain, the flaps, and their hinges show the highest propensity to conformational transitions in the HIVTD protein. It is, of course, possible that the effects observed for the dimerization domain may be a consequence of the tethering of the two monomers, which facilitates bringing the C-terminal of the first monomer near the N-terminal of the second monomer to engage in the formation of a transient order, as in the native protein structure. All the above conformational transitions may lead to the formation of partially folded species as seen in Fig. 1B. One might wonder whether the present data would throw any light on whether the folding of the protease is a simple two-state or a complex multistate process; this is of significance for understanding the mechanism of folding of the protein. Conventionally, this is discerned by monitoring the folding using a variety of probes such as circular dichroism, fluorescence, calorimetry, IR spectroscopy, etc. In the event that it is a two-state process, the folding profiles from all the techniques would be completely superimposable (39Fersht A.R. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Folding. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1999: 517-518Google Scholar). In the present case, generation of a complete folding profile by any of the conventional techniques, either in the kinetic or in the equilibrium experiments, is severely hampered because of the autocleavage property of the protein. Nevertheless, we observe that in 5 m guanidine, the HSQC spectra show many extra peaks compared with the 6 m spectrum and most of these peaks do not correspond to the native state of the protein. This means that there is at least one other non-native state that exchanges slowly with the 6 m denatured state. It is more likely that there are several non-native states that are slightly different from the 6 m denatured state, and these arise from different protein molecules at the surface of the folding funnel, following different paths along the folding funnel. This is consistent with the different extents of residue-level folding propensities along the sequence of the polypeptide chain. Thus we believe that the protein has a complex folding mechanism and even the early events involve many states near the surface of the folding funnel. Different molecules may follow different paths, and there may be local cooperativity of folding transitions along each path. We have attempted here to obtain useful insights into the early events in the folding pathway of HIV-1 protease, using a tethered dimer construct as its representative. From a number of NMR parameters determined under conditions of guanidine denaturation, the early folding nuclei have been identified. These include native as well as non-native secondary structures, and the native structures span the residues at the active site, the hinge, and the dimerization domain. Interestingly, proline residues seem to have significant influence on the local structural preferences in the denatured state of the protein. Hydrophobic interactions between the side chains seem to cause substantial restrictions on the motional properties along the chain, and these may be important in driving the folding process. It is also observed that glycines and alanines cause enhanced conformational flexibilities and thus may act as molecular hinges in the folding as suggested earlier (38Schwarzinger S. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12681-12686Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As the denaturant concentration is progressively reduced, partially folded species start appearing and the protein begins to acquire autolytic activity. The investigations at 6 and 5 m guanidine denaturing conditions show that the dimerization domain, the flaps, and the hinges or the elbow of the protein have the highest propensity to conformational transitions. The residue-wise graded propensities also suggest a certain degree of local cooperativity in these conformational transitions. Finally, from the observation of more than one non-native species even in 5 m guanidine and the sequence-wise hierarchy of the conformational transitions, it appears that the protein folds following a complex mechanism with different molecules following different pathways. To our knowledge this is the first experimental description of the early events in the folding mechanism of HIV-1 protease."
https://openalex.org/W2031436292,"The role of elongation factor (EF)-2 phosphorylation in the regulation of pancreatic β-cell protein synthesis by glucose was investigated in the INS-1-derived cell line 832/13. Incubation of cells in media containing 1 mmglucose resulted in a progressive increase in EF-2 phosphorylation that was maximal by 1–2 h. Readdition of 10 mm glucose promoted a rapid dephosphorylation of EF-2 that was complete in 10 min and maintained over the ensuing 2 h. Similar results were obtained using primary rat islets or Min-6 insulinoma cells. The glucose effect in 832/13 cells was replicated by addition of pyruvate or α-ketocaproate, but not 2-deoxyglucose, suggesting that mitochondrial metabolism was required. Accordingly, glucose-mediated dephosphorylation of EF-2 was completely blocked by the mitochondrial respiratory antagonists antimycin A and oligomycin. The hyperglycemic effect was not mimicked by incubation of cells in 100 nminsulin, 30 mm potassium chloride, or 0.25 mmdiazoxide, indicating that insulin secretion and/or depolarization of β cells was not required. The locus of the high glucose effect appeared to be protein phosphatase-2A, the principal phosphatase acting on EF-2. Protein phosphatase-2A activity was stimulated by glucose addition to 832/13 cells, but neither protein phosphatase-1 nor calmodulin kinase III (EF-2 kinase) activity was affected under these conditions. The slower rephosphorylation of EF-2 during the transition from high to low glucose may involve effects on EF-2 kinase activity. Addition of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-d-ribofuranoside in high glucose led to a marked stimulation of EF-2 phosphorylation, consistent with the possibility that increased AMP kinase activity in low glucose stimulates EF-2 kinase. In parallel with the effects on EF-2 dephosphorylation, addition of high glucose to 832/13 cells markedly increased the incorporation of [35S]methionine into total protein. Taken together, these results suggest that modulation of extracellular glucose impacts protein translation rate in β cells at least in part through regulation of the elongation step, via phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of EF-2. The role of elongation factor (EF)-2 phosphorylation in the regulation of pancreatic β-cell protein synthesis by glucose was investigated in the INS-1-derived cell line 832/13.

The hyperglycemic effect was not mimicked by incubation of cells in 100 nminsulin, 30 mm potassium chloride, or 0.25 mmdiazoxide, indicating that insulin secretion and/or depolarization of β cells was not required. The locus of the high glucose effect appeared to be protein phosphatase-2A, the principal phosphatase acting on EF-2. Protein phosphatase-2A activity was stimulated by glucose addition to 832/13 cells, but neither protein phosphatase-1 nor calmodulin kinase III (EF-2 kinase) activity was affected under these conditions. The slower rephosphorylation of EF-2 during the transition from high to low glucose may involve effects on EF-2 kinase activity. Addition of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-d-ribofuranoside in high glucose led to a marked stimulation of EF-2 phosphorylation, consistent with the possibility that increased AMP kinase activity in low glucose stimulates EF-2 kinase. In parallel with the effects on EF-2 dephosphorylation, addition of high glucose to 832/13 cells markedly increased the incorporation of [35S]methionine into total protein. Taken together, these results suggest that modulation of extracellular glucose impacts protein translation rate in β cells at least in part through regulation of the elongation step, via phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of EF-2. mammalian target of rapamycin calmodulin elongation factor phospho-elongation factor 2 protein phosphatase-2A Krebs-Ringer buffer supplemented with 25 mm Hepes and 0.5% bovine serum albumin 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-d-ribofuranoside Glucose exerts many effects on pancreatic islets in addition to the familiar enhancement of insulin secretion. Several studies have shown that hyperglycemia results in both transcriptional and translational activation in β cells or their derivative cell lines (e.g. Refs. 1Permutt M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2738-2742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Welsh M. Scherberg N. Gilmore R. Steiner D.F. Biochem.

A. 2001; 97: 5773-5778Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). For example, proinsulin production is controlled by glucose at both levels, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene transcription is activated. Measures of total protein synthesis using [35S]methionine labeling and two-dimensional SDS-PAGE reveal substantial increases in many proteins after glucose stimulation of isolated islets, particularly the components of secretory granules (6Grimaldi K.A. Siddle K. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 7Guest P.C. Bailyes E.M. Rutherford N.G. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mechanistic studies of the glucose effect on protein synthesis have been ambiguous. Early studies in isolated islets suggested that the initiation step was primarily affected (1Permutt M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2738-2742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but subsequent studies proposed that both initiation and elongation were involved (2Welsh M. Scherberg N. Gilmore R. Steiner D.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, attempts to identify the specific initiation and/or elongation factors that might contribute to changes in translational control have been inconclusive. The situation is complicated by the fact that glucose causes insulin secretion, and insulin itself can exert profound effects on protein synthesis in responsive cells, including β cells themselves. Thus, some of the effects of glucose on translation in β cells may well be mediated in an autocrine manner (8Xu G. Marshall C.A. Lin T.A. Kwon G. Munivenkatappa R.B. Hill J.R. Lawrence Jr., J.C. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4485-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Regulation at the level of initiation is often dependent on the phosphorylation of the limiting accessory factors eIF-2B and eIF4E-BP (4E-BP, Phas-1) (for review, see Ref. 9Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30337-30340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Whereas insulin is known to alter the activity of 4E-BP via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt-mTOR1 pathway in many target cells, glucose appears not to directly affect this system in β cells (10Gilligan M. Welsh G.I. Flynn A. Bujalska I. Diggle T.A. Denton R.M. Proud C.G. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2121-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) but can induce 4E-BP phosphorylation via the autocrine pathway, provided that amino acids are present (8Xu G. Marshall C.A. Lin T.A. Kwon G. Munivenkatappa R.B. Hill J.R. Lawrence Jr., J.C. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4485-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Glucose does appear to increase the activity of eIF-2B, but not by altering the phosphorylation state of the eIF-2α factor commonly found to be involved in translational initiation control (10Gilligan M. Welsh G.I. Flynn A. Bujalska I. Diggle T.A. Denton R.M. Proud C.G. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2121-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Protein translation can also be regulated at the level of elongation, principally by secondary modification of both elongation factors 1 and 2. EF-1 is a substrate for several protein kinases, and its activity can be modulated by insulin in target cells (11Traugh J.A. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2001; 26: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of EF-2 by the enzyme Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase III (EF-2 kinase), primarily at Thr-56, blocks the ability of this factor to participate in protein synthesis (12Nairn A.C. Palfrey H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17299-17303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ryazanov A.G. Davydova E.K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). EF-2 phosphorylation state has subsequently been shown to vary in a wide variety of cell types in response to diverse stimuli (for review, see Ref. 14Nairn A.C. Matsushita M. Nastiuk K. Horiuchi A. Mitsui K. Shimizu Y. Palfrey H.C. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2001; 27: 91-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Frequently, these stimuli elevate intracellular Ca2+, thereby activating the kinase and increasing phospho-EF-2 (EF-2P) levels. However, other mechanisms of altering EF-2P levels may be even more important, including phosphorylation and activation or inactivation of EF-2 kinase by calcium-independent kinases, as well as effects on the dephosphorylating arm of the cycle. In this study we examined the effects of glucose on the EF-2 phosphorylation system in β cells or cell lines derived from β cells. For the most part, we used the INS-1-derived 832/13 cell line that shows robust insulin secretory responses to glucose and appears to mimic β-cell behavior in several ways (15Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). We found that glucose addition to cells maintained in low glucose medium induced a marked and rapid dephosphorylation of EF-2 that was accompanied by a significant increase in overall protein synthesis. The effect on EF-2 phosphorylation seemed to be principally mediated by stimulation of protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A) activity rather than by inhibition of the kinase reaction. Together, our data suggest that promotion of protein synthesis by glucose involves modification of the elongation step of protein translation. Cell culture reagents were supplied by Mediatech, Inc., except for cysteine/methionine-free media, which was from Invitrogen. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma, with the exception of AICAR (Toronto Research Chemicals) and rapamycin, PD98059, and wortmannin (Calbiochem). Tran35S-label (1000 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol) were obtained from ICN. Anti-EF-2 and anti-phospho-EF-2 antibodies were generated as described previously (16Marin P. Nastiuk K.L. Daniel N. Girault J.A. Czernik A.J. Glowinski J. Nairn A.C. Premont J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3445-3454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the phospho-acetyl-CoA carboxylase antibody was from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse IgG was from Bio-Rad, whereas ECL reagent was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The INS-1-derived cell lines 832/1 and 832/13 were generously provided by Dr. C. Newgard (Duke University) and cultured as described previously (15Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Multiwell cultures (75–90% confluent) were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 2 h in Krebs-Ringer buffer supplemented with 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (KRBH) and either 1 or 10 mm glucose. Sample wells were then switched to KRBH containing the same or different glucose concentrations for various periods as indicated in the figures. Cells were then rapidly washed three times on ice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors), and centrifuged at 14, 000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were removed, and equal amounts of lysate protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Rat islets were prepared as described previously (17McDaniel M.L. Colca J.R. Kotagal N. Lacy P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 182-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and treated samples were kindly provided by Drs. J. Corbett and P. Hansen (St. Louis University). Ca2+/CaM-dependent EF-2 kinase activity was measured as described previously (18Mitsui K. Brady M. Palfrey H.C. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13422-13433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using purified rat liver EF-2 as substrate. Reactions contained 5 μg of lysate protein, 3 μg of EF-2, and 25 μm[γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer and boiling; 32P-EF-2 was resolved by SDS-PAGE, identified by autoradiography, and counted by liquid scintillation. Protein phosphatase assays were performed as described previously (19Brady M.J. Nairn A.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29698-29703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After treatment, cells were collected in phosphatase homogenization buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 2 mg/ml glycogen, 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors). Samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and ∼5 μg of supernatant protein was used for assays. [32P]Phosphorylase was used as substrate and prepared as described previously (19Brady M.J. Nairn A.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29698-29703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), with the modification that recombinant phosphorylase kinase catalytic subunit was used. Phosphatase activity inhibited by addition of 3 nm okadaic acid is defined as PP2A, whereas phosphatase activity lost between 3 and 500 nm okadaic acid is defined as protein phosphatase-1. Addition of 500 nm okadaic acid completely inhibited all cellular phosphatase activity measured under these conditions. 832/13 cells were plated in 12-well dishes and serum-starved as described above. Cells were pretreated in triplicate for 10 min as indicated, and then 10 μCi of Tran35S-label was added to all wells. After a 10-min incubation at room temperature, the dishes were washed thrice with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid; precipitated proteins were then dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.1n NaOH and transferred to scintillation vials. The samples were neutralized by addition 10 μl of 10% acetic acid, and35S incorporation into proteins was measured by scintillation counting. In parallel, a replicate well for each condition was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and protein lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Shifts in extracellular glucose markedly affect insulin secretion and protein biosynthesis in β-cell lines and primary islets (1Permutt M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2738-2742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Welsh M. Scherberg N. Gilmore R. Steiner D.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 3Skelly R.H. Schuppin G.T. Ishihara H. Oka Y. Rhodes C.J. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 37-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Goodge K.A.

A. 2001; 97: 5773-5778Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To confirm that glucose levels also regulate protein synthesis in the INS-1-derived 832/13 cells, we preincubated cells for 2 h in 1 mm glucose and then added back either glucose (3 or 10 mm), pyruvate (5 mm), or insulin (100 nm) for 10 min and measured incorporation of [35S]methionine into total cellular protein. Addition of glucose caused a ∼4-fold increase in total incorporation (Fig.1A), and analysis of labeled proteins by SDS-PAGE showed that this effect involved numerous species (Fig. 1B). The effect was reproduced by pyruvate, but insulin in the presence of 1 mm glucose had little effect on labeling. These results are comparable with those found previously with isolated islets (7Guest P.C. Bailyes E.M. Rutherford N.G. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and demonstrate that the 832/13 cell line exhibits typical glucose responsiveness with respect to protein translation. Because EF-2 phosphorylation state has been correlated with protein synthetic capacity in several studies (for review, see Ref. 14Nairn A.C. Matsushita M. Nastiuk K. Horiuchi A. Mitsui K. Shimizu Y. Palfrey H.C. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2001; 27: 91-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we investigated whether ambient glucose affected EF-2P levels in the 832/13 cell line, as well as in Min-6 insulinoma cells and isolated pancreatic islets. Cells were preincubated for 2 h in buffer containing either 1 or 10 mm glucose, and lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblot using a phospho-specific EF-2 antibody (raised against a peptide containing phospho-Thr-56; Ref. 16Marin P. Nastiuk K.L. Daniel N. Girault J.A. Czernik A.J. Glowinski J. Nairn A.C. Premont J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3445-3454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures maintained in low glucose exhibited relatively high levels of EF-2P, whereas those maintained in high glucose had low levels of EF-2P (Fig.2A). When samples were shifted from low to high glucose, EF-2P declined within 10 min to the level found in cells maintained in high glucose throughout (Fig. 2,A and B). In contrast, there was no change in total EF-2 protein with any treatment (Fig. 2, A andB). Importantly, the glucose-dependent phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of EF-2 was also manifest in Min-6 cells and primary rat islets (Fig. 2A), indicating that this effect may be physiologically relevant in β cells from a variety of sources. However, in high glucose, EF-2P levels were elevated in the islets as compared with the cell lines, perhaps reflecting the presence of non-regulated EF-2P in α and δ cells in the islet preparations. To investigate the reversibility of the phenomenon, we verified that after a 2-h incubation in high glucose, samples returned to low glucose exhibited a rephosphorylation of EF-2, albeit with slower kinetics as described below. To determine whether the hyperglycemic effect on EF-2 phosphorylation was mediated by breakdown and mitochondrial utilization of the sugar, we tested the effects of non-metabolizable glucose analogs, as well as permeant compounds that can bypass glucose catabolism. Addition of 2-deoxyglucose to cells maintained in low glucose had no effect on EF-2P level, indicating that metabolism beyond the glucokinase step is required (Fig.3A). By contrast, addition of 5 mm of either pyruvate or α-ketocaproic acid, both of which can enter mitochondria and be directly metabolized to produce ATP, could substitute for glucose in mediating EF-2 dephosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Further evidence for mitochondrial involvement came from the use of respiratory chain inhibitors such as antimycin A or oligomycin, either of which blocked the effect of glucose on EF-2 dephosphorylation (Fig. 3C). These data indicate that production of ATP or some catabolite derived from glucose may be an important intermediary in promoting EF-2 dephosphorylation. INS-1 cells and islet β cells themselves have insulin receptors, and it is likely that some effects of glucose are mediated by released insulin, acting in an autocrine or paracrine manner (20Kulkarni R.N. Bruning J.C. Winnay J.N. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 329-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Moreover, insulin treatment of some other cell types has been reported to reduce EF-2P levels via inactivation of EF-2 kinase (e.g.see Ref. 21Redpath N.T. Foulstone E.J. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2291-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To investigate the potential role of insulin release/signaling on EF-2P levels, 832/13 cells were preincubated for 2 h in buffer containing 1 mm glucose. Insulin-dependent effects on EF-2P were estimated by direct addition of 100 nm insulin or by depolarizing the cells with either 30 mm KCl or the ATP-sensitive potassium channel blocker tolbutamide. Exogenous insulin did lead to a small decrease in EF-2P levels at 10 min (Fig.4A) but was unable to mimic the glucose effect, even after 2 h (data not shown). Additionally, stimulation of endogenous insulin release from 832/13 cells by addition of 100 μm tolbutamide or 30 mm KCl had no effect on EF-2P levels (Fig. 4B; data not shown). EF-2 dephosphorylation resulting from glucose addition was also unaffected by inclusion of 0.25 mm diazoxide, an inhibitor of insulin exocytosis (data not shown). Finally, the glucose effect was evinced in 832/1 cells (Fig. 4B), INS-1-derived cells that exhibit meager glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (15Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). To investigate potential signaling pathways mediating the regulation of EF-2P levels by glucose, a variety of well-characterized kinase inhibitors were used. 832/13 cells were glucose-restricted for 2 h in KRBH containing 1 mm glucose and preincubated for 15 min with the indicated compounds, and then 10 mm glucose was added for a final 10-min period. Pretreatment of 832/13 cells with 100 nm of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin had no effect on the glucose-dependent dephosphorylation of EF-2, whereas the modest insulin effect on EF-2P levels was completely blocked by the drug (Fig. 4A). Neither the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 (20 μm) nor the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (100 nm), alone, in combination, or together with wortmannin, had any effect on the glucose-mediated reduction in EF-2P levels (Fig. 4C; data not shown). The efficacy of these compounds on their respective signaling pathways was confirmed in parallel experiments using insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (data not shown). Cumulatively, these results indicate that the regulation of EF-2P levels by extracellular glucose occurs independently of insulin secretion/signaling and activation of several well-characterized kinase signaling cascades. The regulation of EF-2P levels by extracellular glucose must involve alteration of kinase and/or phosphatase activities. EF-2 kinase is the major and perhaps only kinase that phosphorylates EF-2, whereas PP2A is the most active cellular phosphatase acting on EF-2P (12Nairn A.C. Palfrey H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17299-17303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Nairn A.C. Matsushita M. Nastiuk K. Horiuchi A. Mitsui K. Shimizu Y. Palfrey H.C. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2001; 27: 91-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Mitsui K. Brady M. Palfrey H.C. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13422-13433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Redpath N.T. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Direct assays of kinase activity in lysates derived from cells shifted from low to high glucose revealed no significant difference in either basal or Ca2+/CaM-stimulated activity (using activity in 1 mm glucose as 100%, cells maintained in 10 mmglucose had 113% of this activity, whereas cells shifted for 10 min from 1 to 10 mm glucose had 97% of this activity), suggesting that this enzyme is not the primary target of the hyperglycemic effect. In parallel, both protein phosphatase-1 and PP2A activities were measured in cellular lysates using [32P]phosphorylase as substrate. Extracts from cells incubated with 10 mm glucose contained a high level of PP2A activity (Fig. 5A). Reducing extracellular glucose to 1 mm for 2 h reduced PP2A activity by ∼2-fold. Conversely, raising extracellular glucose from 1 to 10 mm caused a substantial activation of PP2A activity within 10 min; by contrast, protein phosphatase-1 activity measured in the same lysate remained constant during these transitions (Fig.5A). If stimulation of PP2A is involved in the effect of high glucose, then the response should be sensitive to permeant inhibitors of this enzyme. Accordingly, preincubation of 832/13 cells with calyculin A (50 nm), an inhibitor of both protein phosphatase-1 and PP2A but not of protein phosphatase-2B or protein phosphatase-2C, markedly impaired EF-2 dephosphorylation in response to glucose addition (Fig. 5, B and C). Taken together, these data suggest that the hyperglycemic reduction in EF-2 phosphorylation state appears to be mediated primarily by an increase in PP2A rather than a decrease in EF-2 kinase activity. When cells were shifted from high to low glucose media, there was a relatively slow reappearance of EF-2P (Fig.6A). The marked kinetic difference between dephosphorylation in high glucose and rephosphorylation in low glucose suggested that the two processes might be mediated by distinct mechanisms. Indeed, whereas calyculin A attenuated the dephosphorylation of EF-2 on glucose addition, the phosphatase inhibitor did not substantially raise the already low EF-2P levels of 832/13 cells maintained in high glucose (e.g. see Fig. 5B; data not shown). Thus, a simple reversal of PP2A stimulation cannot account for the effect of glucose restriction. This result implies that stimulation of EF-2 kinase, rather than a decrease in PP2A activity with no change in EF-2 kinase, is somehow involved in the phosphorylation phenomenon. It seemed highly unlikely that such a stimulation could occur via changes in intracellular Ca2+because low glucose hyperpolarizes β cells, resulting in the closure of plasma membrane Ca2+ channels and a consequent lowering of cytoplasmic [Ca]. Additionally, a 15-min treatment with 10 μm forskolin caused only a slight increase in EF-2 phosphorylation, suggesting that changes in cAMP levels were not involved in the phosphorylation response to low glucose (Fig.6B). Shifts in extracellular glucose have been reported to alter the ATP/AMP ratio in β cells, and it has been proposed that AMP kinase might act as a sensor to transmit signals from metabolism to various effector pathways (23Salt I.P. Johnson G. Ashcroft S.J. Hardie D.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we tested whether AICAR, a nucleotide analog activator of AMP kinase (24Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar), would affect EF-2 phosphorylation in 832/13 cells. AICAR treatment of cells maintained in high glucose led to an increase in EF-2P that peaked at 30 min (Fig. 6B). The effects of the nucleotide were not additive with glucose restriction (data not shown), suggesting that AMP kinase may play a role in the calcium-independent activation of EF-2 kinase in glucose-restricted cells. This conclusion was bolstered by the observations that glucose restriction increased the phosphorylation of the AMP kinase substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase (25Dyck J.R. Kudo N. Barr A.J. Davies S.P. Hardie D.G. Lopaschuk G.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), with a time course similar to that of EF-2 (Fig. 6, compare C withA), and that AICAR stimulation of EF-2 and acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation was also temporally correlated (Fig. 6, compare C with B). The acceleration of protein synthesis by glucose in pancreatic β cells was established many years ago, yet the mechanisms underlying the increase in translational capacity are still obscure. Initiation is the rate-limiting step in translation under many circumstances, thus it had been anticipated that glucose stimulation would primarily impact this step. One report does claim an effect of glucose stimulation on eIF-2B activity, but the mechanism is unknown (10Gilligan M. Welsh G.I. Flynn A. Bujalska I. Diggle T.A. Denton R.M. Proud C.G. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2121-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We show here that, as in islets themselves, the 832/13 β-cell line exhibits a robust increase in overall protein synthetic rates in response to glucose. Our data strongly suggest that glucose-induced EF-2 dephosphorylation plays a major role in this response. A potential route by which this might take place is by an autocrine/paracrine mechanism whereby secreted insulin activates β-cell insulin receptors. Insulin is known to affect β-cell function, as strikingly shown in the differential effects of glucose or insulin on insulin gene transcription in controlversus β-cell-specific, insulin receptor-deficient (βIRKO) mice (20Kulkarni R.N. Bruning J.C. Winnay J.N. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 329-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of glucose action on EF-2 dephosphorylation in the present study is definitively not via secreted insulin and is not mediated by either the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mTOR pathway or Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase, both of which are downstream of the activated insulin receptor. Neither insulin itself nor stimuli that evoke a glucose-independent secretion of insulin had a profound effect on EF-2 phosphorylation state. Conversely, glucose-stimulated dephosphorylation of EF-2 was unaffected by inhibition of cellular depolarization and insulin secretion. Nevertheless, as with the insulin secretory response, catabolism of glucose was required, and it appears likely that a mitochondrial metabolite might be pivotal to the signaling pathway required for the effect on EF-2 phosphorylation state. The failure to find an obvious effect of glucose addition on EF-2 kinase activity raised the possibility that the high glucose control of EF-2P resided primarily on the phosphatase arm of the cycle. Hyperglycemic conditions evoked an activation of protein phosphatase activity in 831/13 cells, confirming a previous preliminary report in islets (26Murphy L.I. Jones P.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 117: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Differential measurement of protein phosphatase activities revealed that PP2A was the likely locus of the effect in 832/13 cells. With respect to EF-2 dephosphorylation, this makes sense because PP2A is the most potent phosphatase acting on EF-2P (12Nairn A.C. Palfrey H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17299-17303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Redpath N.T. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of EF-2P upon glucose addition was attenuated by calyculin A, supporting the notion that control is exercised at the phosphatase level in the glucose signaling pathway. PP2A is a key member of the serine/threonine-protein phosphatase family and is responsible for a substantial fraction of the dephosphorylating activity present in all mammalian cells. In this group of enzymes, a conserved catalytic subunit (C) is linked to variable anchoring (A) and regulatory subunits (B) to form a variety of heterotrimeric enzymes, although AC dimers may also exist in cells (27Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). A novel regulatory mechanism involving the TAP42/α4 protein may also play an important role in PP2A specificity. TAP42 is a yeast protein implicated in the TOR pathway, and its mammalian equivalent (α4) has been found in association with the PP2A catalytic subunit in vivo. Indeed, overexpression of α4 has been reported to affect EF-2P levels in COS-7 cells without influencing other phosphoproteins relevant to protein synthesis (28Chung H. Nairn A.C. Murata K. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10371-10376Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It is possible that the effects of glucose in β cells will be mediated by some factor that modulates the association of PP2Ac with a specific regulatory subunit. Molecular identification of PP2A subspecies in β cells is clearly warranted and will be required before the details of the glucose signaling pathway can be elucidated. Our data are not consistent with a recent report claiming that glucose might exert some of its effects in β cells through the inhibition of protein phosphatase activity (29Sjoholm A. Lehtihet M. Efanov A.M. Zaitsev S.V. Berggren P.O. Honkanen R.E. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4592-4598Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In that study, several metabolites of glucose such as phosphoenolpyruvate were found to inhibit total protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity in β-cell extracts. However, very high concentrations of these intermediates were used, and no attempt was made either to discriminate between different phosphatases or to show that enzyme activity was modulated in intact cells. Glucose has also been reported to increase protein phosphatase-2B (calcineurin) activity in islets through a calcium-dependent mechanism, and this may be involved in transcriptional and secretory control in β cells (30Donelan M.J. Morfini G. Julyan R. Sommers S. Hays L. Kajio H. Briaud I. Easom R.A. Molkentin J.D. Brady S.T. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24232-24242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Protein phosphatase-2B is unlikely to be involved in EF-2P dephosphorylation because depolarization had no effect on EF-2P state, and protein phosphatase-2B has minimal activity against EF-2Pin vitro. EF-2 kinase is a member of an atypical family of protein kinases that differ in the primary structure of the catalytic domain from the “conventional” protein kinases, such as protein kinase A or CaM kinase I (31Ryazanov A.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 26-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 32Yamaguchi H. Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1047-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The enzyme is conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to man and presumably plays a critical role in cell behavior because it is expressed in most tissues of the body. The purified enzyme is activated by Ca2+/CaM, but other calcium-independent mechanisms of activation as well as inhibition of activity have been demonstrated. For example, as pointed out above, insulin appears to inhibit the enzyme in some cells, leading to a decrease in EF-2P (21Redpath N.T. Foulstone E.J. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2291-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this effect is still poorly defined but may involve mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of EF-2 kinase because it is reportedly blocked by rapamycin (33Wang X. Li W. Williams M. Terada N Alessi D.R. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4370-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). In the present study, we did find a small effect of exogenous insulin on EF-2P levels, consistent with an inhibition of EF-2 kinase, and this was blocked by wortmannin and rapamycin. In addition, the stress-activated pathway initiated by treatments such as protein synthesis inhibitors or ligands such as tumor necrosis factor α can also significantly inhibit EF-2 kinase in epithelial cells (34Knebel A. Haydon C.E. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This effect is mediated by direct phosphorylation of the enzyme on serine residues by stress-activated protein kinase/p38δ (35Knebel A. Morrice N. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4360-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that glucose addition does not lead to an acute inhibition of EF-2 kinase activity that would contribute significantly to the dephosphorylation of EF-2. Nevertheless, it seems likely that the increase in phosphorylation of EF-2 during glucose restriction involves stimulatory effects on kinase activity, rather than just a reversal of PP2A stimulation, because inhibition of PP2A activity by calyculin A in high glucose did not substantially raise EF-2P levels. An attractive possibility is that AMP kinase is responsible for the indirect stimulation of EF-2 kinase under hypoglycemic conditions. Although further work is needed on this question, the fact that AICAR treatment resulted in elevated EF-2P levels in cells maintained in high glucose suggests that a connection between AMP kinase and EF-2 phosphorylation exists. Indeed, low glucose levels do increase AMP kinase in islets (23Salt I.P. Johnson G. Ashcroft S.J. Hardie D.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), and EF-2 phosphorylation levels are sensitive to AMP kinase activation in other cell types (36Horman S. Browne G. Krause U. Patel J. Vertommen D. Bertrand L. Lavoinne A. Hue L. Proud C. Rider M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1419-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Although it is too early to rule out an effect of AMP kinase on EF-2 phosphorylation by a more circuitous route in β cells (e.g. via inhibition of PP2A), an AMP kinase stimulation of EF-2 kinase and a consequent increase in EF-2P have been proposed to account for the rapid, reversible shut-off in protein synthesis found in hepatocytes under hypoxic conditions (36Horman S. Browne G. Krause U. Patel J. Vertommen D. Bertrand L. Lavoinne A. Hue L. Proud C. Rider M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1419-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Evidently, the complex regulation of EF-2 phosphorylation at both the kinase and phosphatase levels expands the options available in β cells for modulating protein synthetic capacity in response to a variety of inputs (see Fig. 7 for summary).

https://openalex.org/W2023973334,"To investigate the exact biochemical functions by which Bcl-2 regulates apoptosis, we established a stable human small cell lung carcinoma cell line, Ms-1, overexpressing wild-type human Bcl-2 or various deletion and point mutants thereof, and examined the effect of these Bcl-2 mutants on apoptosis induced by antitumor drugs such as camptothecin. Cytochrome c release, caspase-3-(-like) protease activation, and apoptosis induced by antitumor drugs were accelerated by overexpression of Bcl-2 lacking a Bcl-2 homology (BH) 1 domain (Bcl-2/ ΔBH1), but not by that of BH2, BH3, or BH4 domain-deleted Bcl-2. A similar result was obtained upon the substitution of glycine 145 with alanine in the BH1 domain (Bcl-2/G145A), which failed to interact with either Bax or Bak. Pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak have been known to be activated in response to antitumor drugs, and Bcl-2/G145A as well as Bcl-2/ΔBH1 also accelerated Bax- or Bak-induced apoptosis in HEK293T cells. These two mutants still retained the ability to interact with wild-type Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, and abrogated the inhibitory effect of wild-type Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL on Bax- or Bak-induced apoptosis. In addition, immunoprecipitation studies revealed that Bcl-2/ΔBH1 and Bcl-2/G145A interrupted the association between wild-type Bcl-2 and Bax/Bak. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Bcl-2/ΔBH1 or Bcl-2/G145A acts as a dominant negative of endogenous anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, thereby enhancing antitumor drug-induced apoptosis, and that this dominant negative activity requires both a failure of interaction with Bax and Bak through the BH1 domain of Bcl-2 and retention of the ability to interact with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL.

Apoptosis, a morphologically distinguished form of pro-grammed cell death, is critical not only during development and tissue homeostasis but also in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases including cancer, autoimmune disease, and neuro-degenerative disorders (1Martin S.J. Green D.R. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995; 18: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 2Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6205) Google Scholar, 3White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Mitochondria is the crucial regulatory organelle for the signaling pathway of apoptosis (4Desagher S. Martinou J.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 369-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar, 5Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Many death signals cause irreversible dysfunction of mitochondria, leading to the release of several mitochondrial intermembrane proteins. Cytochrome c was the first characterized mitochondrial factor shown to be released from the mitochondrial intermembrane space and to be involved in the activation of caspase by forming apoptosomes (6Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar, 7Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X.

Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). Like cytochrome c, other mitochondrial intermembrane proteins such as AIF, Smac/DIABLO, Endo G, and Omi/HtrA2 were found to undergo release during apoptosis and have been implicated in various aspects of the cell death process (9Van Loo G. Saelens X. Van Gurp M. MacFarlane M. Martin S.J. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1031-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 family of proteins plays a pivotal role in the regulation of mitochondrial integrity and response to apoptotic signals (10Wang H-G. Reed J.C. Histol. Histopathol. 1998; 13: 521-530PubMed Google Scholar). Bcl-2 family proteins can be subdivided into three distinct groups: (i) anti-apoptotic members such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL with sequence homology at Bcl-2 homology 1 (BH1), 1The abbreviations used are: BH1, Bcl-2 homology 1; SCLC, small cell lung carcinoma; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; wt, wild-type; PI, propidium iodide; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. BH2, BH3, and BH4 domains; (ii) pro-apoptotic molecules, such as Bax and Bak, with sequence homology at BH1, BH2, and BH3; and (iii) pro-apoptotic proteins that share homology only at the BH3 domain, such as Bid, Bik, Noxa, and Bim (11Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3268) Google Scholar). These Bcl-2 family members are characterized by their ability to interact and form homo- and heterodimers (10Wang H-G. Reed J.C. Histol. Histopathol. 1998; 13: 521-530PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Structural and mutational analyses have been used to assess the function of each BH domain in anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. The BH4 domain, which is conserved only among anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, has been reported to bind with other proteins regulating apoptosis, including calcineurin (13Shibasaki F. Kondo E. Akagi T. McKeon F. Nature. 1997; 386: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), Raf-1 (14Wang H.G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), and voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) (15Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar), and deletion of BH4 from Bcl-2/Bcl-xL has been shown to abrogate their anti-apoptotic ability (16Huang D.C.S. Adams J.M. Cory S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1029-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 17Hunter J.J. Bond B.L. Parslow T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 877-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Borner C.

The BH3 domain plays the role of ligand during dimerization of Bcl-2 family proteins, whereas a combination of the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains appears to be required for forming an elongated hydrophobic cleft, which can bind the BH3-containing peptides of the death promoters (21Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.L. Ng S.L. Fesik S.W.

Earlier studies have indicated that the BH1 and BH2 domains of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL are crucial for dimerization with pro-apoptotic family members (12Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 24Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Through BH1 and BH2, anti-apoptotic proteins can heterodimerize with the pro-apoptotic protein, and the ratio between anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins determines survival or death following various apoptotic stimuli. Mutation of the highly conserved glycine 145 to alanine of the BH1 domain in Bcl-2 (Bcl-2/G145A) (12Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar), the homologous G138A mutation in Bcl-xL (Bcl-xL/G138A) (24Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar), or tryptophan 188 to alanine of the BH2 domain in Bcl-2 abrogates the ability of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL to dimerize with Bax. These mutations also fail to inhibit cell death induced by deprivation of interleukin-3 (IL-3) or dexamethasone in the murine prolymphocytic IL-3-dependent cell line, F5.12 (12Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 24Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). In addition, deletion of BH1 or BH2 has been shown to abrogate the death repressor activity of Bcl-2 in staurosporine-induced cell death in human GM701 fibroblasts (17Hunter J.J. Bond B.L. Parslow T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 877-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Contrary to these indications, others have suggested that heterodimerization of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL with Bax through the BH1 and BH2 domains is not required for anti-apoptotic function (25Cheng E.H. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 26Kelekar A. Chang B.S. Harlan J.E. Fesik S.W. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7040-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Moreover, Oh et al. (27Oh Y.J. Uhland-Smith A. Kim J.E. O'Malley K.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 51: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) has reported that overexpression of the BH1 or BH2 point mutant Bcl-2 protein suppressed staurosporine-induced apoptosis in a dopaminergic neuronal cell line, MN9D. Therefore, these contradictory findings suggest that the requirement of these dimerization domains of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL may be cell- and/or stress type-specific, and the mechanism of regulating apoptosis by Bcl-2 family member is not fully elucidated. In the course of examining the role of homo- and heterodimerization of Bcl-2 family members in antitumor drug-induced apoptosis using various Bcl-2 mutant-overexpressing human small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) Ms-1 cells, we found that overexpression of Bcl-2 lacking a BH1 domain accelerated antitumor drug-induced apoptosis. Here, we show that a deletion mutant of the BH1 domain of Bcl-2 acts as a dominant negative of anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family. Materials—Camptothecin, colchicine, anti-α-tubulin (clone DM 1A) monoclonal antibody, and anti-Bak (B5929) antibody were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Vinblastine sulfate and paclitaxel were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). C2-ceramide was obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (H-250), anti-Bcl-2 (ΔC21), and anti-Bax (N-20) polyclonal antibodies and anti-Myc (9E10) monoclonal antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-cytochrome c (clone 7H8.2C12) monoclonal antibody was obtained from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Anti-Bcl-2 (clone 124) monoclonal antibody was from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark). Plasmids—pGEM-T Easy-human bcl-2, -human bcl-xL, and -human bax plasmids and pCI-neo plasmid were kindly provided by Dr. S. Simizu (RIKEN). pCAGGS-human bak plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Tsujimoto (Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan). To generate the pCI-myc-neo plasmid, the fragment of 6× Myc epitope in pCS-MT was excised by digestion with BamHI/XbaI, blunted using 1 unit of T4 DNA polymerase (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) and then subcloned into an EcoRI-digested and T4 DNA polymerase-blunted pCI-neo plasmid. Bcl-2 deletion mutants were previously described (28Kawatani M. Uchi M. Simizu S. Osada H. Imoto M. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Bcl-2 point mutants, Bcl-2/G145A and Bcl-2/D140A, were constructed as follows. First, 100 ng of pGEM-T Easy-human bcl-2 plasmid was used for amplification under the following PCR conditions: 35 cycles of denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing for 1 min at 50 °C, and extension for 2 min at 72 °C. The following specific primers were used: Bcl-2/G145A mutant, 5′-GGGACGCTTTGCCACGGTGGTGGAGGAGCTCTTCAGGGACGGGGTGAACTGGGCAAGGATTGTGGCCTTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TATTTAGGTGACACTATAG-3′ (SP-6, reverse); Bcl-2/D140A mutant, 5′-GGGACGCTTTGCCACGGTGGTGGAGGAGCTCTTCAGGGCAGG GGTGAACTGGGGGAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TATTTAGGTGACACTATAG-3′ (SP-6, reverse). These PCR products were digested by BstXI, and then subcloned into a BstXI-digested pGEM-T Easy-human bcl-2 plasmid. These constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis and digested by EcoRI, and then cloned into the mammalian expression plasmid, pCI-neo or pCI-myc-neo. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human SCLC Ms-1 and human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin G (100 units/ml), and kanamycin (0.1 mg/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air. For establishing stable cell lines, Ms-1 cells (2 × 106) were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid pCI-neo alone or pCI-neo containing various constructs using LipofectAMINETM reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. These transfectants were selected by supplementing the medium with 700 μg/ml G418 (Sigma Chemical Co.). Single cell clones were isolated from the bulk transfectants by limited dilution cloning in 96-well plates and characterized by Western blot analysis as described below. 293T cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA per 105 cells using the LipofectAMINETM reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western Blot Analysis—The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, 1.5% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.8) at 4 °C with sonication. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the concentration of the protein in each lysate was determined with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. Loading buffer (42 mm Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 2.3% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue) was then added to each lysate, which was subsequently boiled for 3 min and then electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and immunoblotted with anti-Bcl-2 (clone 124 or ΔC21), anti-Bax (N-20), anti-PARP (H-250), anti-Bak (B5929) or anti-Myc (9E10) antibody. Detection was performed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cell Viability Assay—Drug-treated or untreated Ms-1 cells or transiently transfected 293T cells were stained with trypan blue (Sigma Chemical Co.), and the percentage of viable cells was determined using a hemocytometer. Cell viability (%) means the ratio of the number of trypan blue-impermeable cells in total cell counts (trypan blue-impermeable cell number/total cell number). Apoptosis Assay—Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips. Detection of apoptotic cells were performed by annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining using the annexin V-EGFP apoptosis detection kit (MBL, Nagoya, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Apoptotic cells (annexin V-positive and PI-negative cells) were scored under a fluorescence microscope. Evaluation of Cytosolic Cytochrome c—Drug-treated or untreated cells (1 × 107) were harvested and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were resuspended in 600 μl of buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 250 mm sucrose and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, 1 mm leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml chymostatin). The cells were homogenized with 20 strokes of a glass Pyrex homogenizer. Unbroken cells, large plasma membrane pieces, and nuclei were removed by centrifuging the homogenates at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to prepare cytosol. The resulting supernatant was used as the soluble cytosolic fraction. Western blot analysis for cytochrome c (anti-cytochrome c (clone 7H8.2C12) monoclonal antibody) or α-tubulin (anti-α-tubulin (clone DM 1A) monoclonal antibody) was performed. Immunoprecipitation—Transiently transfected 293T cells were resuspended in Extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 10 mm sodium-β-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.5), sonicated on ice and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were precleared by using protein G-agarose resin suspension (Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA), and then immunoprecipitated using 10 μl of anti-Bax (N-20), anti-Bak (B5929), or anti-Myc (9E10) antibody overnight at 4 °C. Next, 10 μl of protein G-agarose resin suspension was added to each of the immunocomplexes, and the mixtures were rotated for 5 h at 4 °C. After 4 washes with Extraction buffer, the immunocomplexes were eluted with SDS sample buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with the antibodies. Overexpression of Bcl-2/ΔBH1 Accelerates Camptothecin-induced Apoptosis in Ms-1 Cells—Stable clones of human SCLC Ms-1 cells, overexpressing wild-type (wt) Bcl-2, lacking the BH1 domain of Bcl-2 (Bcl-2/ΔBH1) or vector only (neo), were exposed to camptothecin, and their cell viabilities were assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion assay. As shown in Fig. 1A, camptothecin decreased the viability of vector control clone (Ms-1/neo 13) in a time-dependent manner and failed to induce cell death in the wt Bcl-2-overexpressing Ms-1 clone (Ms-1/wt Bcl-2 7). On the other hand, camptothecin-induced cell death was markedly accelerated in the Bcl-2/ΔBH1-overexpressing Ms-1 clone (Ms-1/Bcl-2/ΔBH1 72) when compared with the Ms-1/neo 13 clone (Fig. 1A). When Ms-1/Bcl-2/ΔBH1 72 was treated with 0.1 or 0.3 μg/ml camptothecin for 18 h, cell viability decreased about 60 or 40%, respectively, under the conditions where significant cell death was not observed in Ms-1/neo 13 (Fig. 1B), indicating that expression of Bcl-2/ΔBH1 reduced the dosage of camptothecin required to induce cell death. Similar results were obtained from independently derived clones (Fig. 1C). Moreover, overexpression of Bcl-2/ΔBH1 also accelerated cell death induced by vinblastine, paclitaxel, or colchicine, as shown in Fig. 1D, suggesting that the acceleration of cell death by Bcl-2/ΔBH1 is not specific to camptothecin-induced cell death. On the other hand, Bcl-2/ΔBH1 and wt Bcl-2 inhibited C2-ceramide-induced cell death (Fig. 1D) as well as cytochrome c release and caspase-3(-like) protease activation (data not shown). Bcl-2/ΔBH1, but Not Bcl-2/ΔBH2, Bcl-2/ΔBH3, and Bcl-2/ΔBH4, Accelerates the Step of Cytochrome c Release from Mitochondria Induced by Camptothecin—Next, we examined whether other BH domain deletion mutants of Bcl-2/ΔBH2, Bcl-2/ΔBH3, and Bcl-2/ΔBH4 also accelerated the cell death induced by camptothecin. As shown in Fig. 2, although all deletion mutant clones tested expressed similar amounts of mutant Bcl-2 protein (Fig. 2A), significant cell death was observed in the Ms-1/Bcl-2/ΔBH1 no. 72 clone but not the Ms-1/Bcl-2/ΔBH2 no. 109, Ms-1/Bcl-2/ΔBH3 no. 55, or Ms-1/Bcl-2/ΔBH4 no. 35 clone 10 h following camptothecin treatment (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2C shows that 18 h after treatment with 1 μg/ml camptothecin, the cell viability of the Ms-1/Bcl-2/ΔBH3 no. 55 and Ms-1/Bcl-2/ΔBH4 no. 35 clones was reduced, and the rate of cell death in these clones was quite similar to that in Ms-1/neo no. 13; however, the Ms-1/Bcl-2/ΔBH2 no. 109 clone was resistant to camptothecin. Similar results were obtained from at least two independently derived clones from each transfectant (data not shown). We next examined the effect of Bcl-2/ΔBH1 on camptothecin-induced cytochrome c release. As shown in Fig. 3A, cytosolic cytochrome c was detected in Ms-1/Bcl-2/ΔBH1 no. 72 at 1 h after camptothecin treatment, under the conditions where cytochrome c release was not yet detected in camptothecin-treated Ms-1/neo no. 13 or the other transfectants. Moreover, at 2 h after the treatment with camptothecin, activation of caspase-3(-like) proteases, as estimated by the cleavage of PARP, was also markedly induced only in the Ms-1/Bcl-2/ΔBH1 no. 72 clone (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that Bcl-2/ΔBH1 accelerates the release of cytochrome c leading to caspase-3-(-like) protease activation induced by camptothecin, thereby enhancing the cell death. On longer exposure to camptothecin, the release of cytochrome c (4 h) and cleavage of PARP (6 h) occurred in Ms-1/Bcl-2/ΔBH3 no. 55 and Ms-1/Bcl-2/ΔBH4 no. 35 as well as in Ms-1/neo no. 13 (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, the Ms-1/Bcl-2/ΔBH2 no. 109 clone showed significant resistance to camptothecin, when compared with the Ms-1/neo no. 13 clone (Fig. 3, A and B). Mutant Bcl-2/G145A but Not Bcl-2/D140A Accelerates Camptothecin-induced Cell Death—Mutational and structural analyses have indicated that the BH1 domain of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL is crucial for dimerization with pro-apoptotic family members (12Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 25Cheng E.H. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate whether the promotional effect on apoptosis of Bcl-2/ΔBH1 was due to a failure of interaction with pro-apoptotic members, Bax and Bak, we generated two point mutations in the BH1 domain of Bcl-2: Bcl-2/G145A, which had been unable to bind Bax or Bak (12Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar); Bcl-2/D140A, which corresponds with Bcl-xL/D133A that had been able to bind Bak, but not Bax (25Cheng E.H. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Each of these mutant Bcl-2 products was first tested for the ability to heterodimerize with Bax or Bak. 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with pCI-neo plasmids encoding Bax or Myc-tagged Bak and wt Bcl-2 or these mutants, and co-immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-Bax or anti-Myc antibody. In agreement with a previous report (12Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar), Bcl-2/G145A bound neither Bax nor Myc-tagged Bak (Fig. 4, A and B). We found that Bcl-2/D140A failed to interact with Bax, but still interacted with Myc-tagged Bak (Fig. 4, A and B). Then, we established stable Ms-1 cells overexpressing Bcl-2/G145A or Bcl-2/D140A (Fig. 5A) and analyzed them for the ability to enhance camptothecin-induced cell death. Two clones overexpressing Bcl-2/G145A (Ms-1/Bcl-2/G145A nos. 1 and 4) displayed increased camptothecin-induced cell death compared with Ms-1/neo no. 13 with similar kinetics observed in Ms-1/Bcl-2/ΔBH1 no. 72, as shown in Fig. 5B. In contrast, camptothecin-induced cell death was completely inhibited in two clones overexpressing Bcl-2/D140A (Ms-1/Bcl-2/D140A nos. 25 and 17) (Fig. 5C). Similarly, Ms-1/Bcl-2/G145A no. 4 displayed increased cytosolic cytochrome c and apoptosis induced by camptothecin compared with Ms-1/neo no. 13, however, Ms-1/Bcl-2/D140A no. 25 as well as Ms-1/wt Bcl-2 no. 7 was resistant to camptothecin (Fig. 5, D and E). Thus, Bcl-2/G145A but not Bcl-2/D140A showed similar activity to Bcl-2/ΔBH1, suggesting that the promotional effect on apoptosis of Bcl-2/ΔBH1 might require Bcl-2 to lose the interaction with both Bax and Bak. On the other hand, cytochrome c release and apoptosis induced by C2-ceramide were not observed in Ms-1/Bcl-2/G145A no. 4 and Ms-1/Bcl-2/D140A no. 25 (Fig. 5, D and E).Fig. 5Overexpression of Bcl-2/G145A but not Bcl-2/D140A accelerates camptothecin-induced apoptosis in Ms-1 cells.A, Western blot analysis of wt Bcl-2 and BH1 domain point mutanto-verexpressing Ms-1 cell lines. Equal aliquots of protein extracted from stable transfectants of the indicated Ms-1 cells were immunoblotted with anti-Bcl-2 (clone 124) or anti-Bax antibody. B, stable transfectants of the indicated Ms-1 cells were treated with 1 μg/ml camptothecin for the periods indicated. C, stable transfectants of the indicated Ms-1 cells were treated with 1 μg/ml camptothecin for 18 h. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion assay. Values are means ± S.D. of quadruplicate determinations. D, stable transfectants of the indicated Ms-1 cells were treated with 1 μg/ml camptothecin for 8 h or 30 μm C2-ceramide for 8 h. Apoptotic cells (annexin V-positive and PI-negative cells) were scored under a fluorescence microscope. Values are means ± S.D. of quadruplicate determinations. E, stable transfectants of the indicated Ms-1 cells were treated with 1 μg/ml camptothecin for 4 h or 30 μm C2-ceramide for 6 h. Cytosolic proteins were isolated and immunoblotted with anti-cytochrome c or anti-α-tubulin antibody, as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The BH2 domain as well as BH1 domain of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL has been reported to be crucial for dimerization with pro-apoptotic family members (12Yin X.M.

Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of Bcl-2/ΔBH2 did not accelerate camptothecin-induced apoptosis, but rather, significantly inhibited it (Figs. 2 and 3). In order to verify this difference, we confirmed the interaction between Bcl-2/ΔBH2 and Bax or Bak. The pCI-neo plasmid encoding wt Bcl-2, Bcl-2/ΔBH1, Bcl-2/G145A, or Bcl-2/ΔBH2 was transiently co-transfected with the pCI-neo plasmid encoding Bax or Myc-tagged Bak into 293T cells and co-immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-Bax or anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 6A and B, although the binding activity was reduced, Bcl-2/ΔBH2 still retained the ability to bind to Bax or Myc-tagged Bak, under the conditions where Bcl-2/ΔBH1 or Bcl-2/G145A failed to interact with Bax or Myc-tagged Bak, respectively. Therefore, these results suggest that the different activity between Bcl-2/ΔBH1 and Bcl-2/ΔBH2 for regulating apoptosis induced by camptothecin is caused by the difference between Bcl-2/ΔBH1 and Bcl-2/ΔBH2 in interacting with pro-apoptotic members, Bax and Bak. Bcl-2/G145A as Well as Bcl-2/ΔBH1 Accelerates Bax- or Bak-induced Apoptosis—Because Bcl-2/G145A and Bcl-2/ΔBH1 failed to bind to Bax and Bak, we next examined whether Bax- or Bak-induced apoptosis is also accelerated by these two mutants. The pCI-neo plasmid encoding wt Bcl-2 or Bcl-2/G145A, or control vector was transfected into 293T cells with or without the pCI-neo plasmid encoding Bax. As shown in Fig. 7A, expression of Bax induced cell death in a time-dependent manner, and wt Bcl-2 completely blocked the Bax-induced cell death. In contrast, Bcl-2/G145A significantly accelerated Bax-induced cell death (Fig. 7A). A similar result was obtained when cells were transfected with Bak instead of Bax (Fig. 7B). Acceleration of Bax- or Bak-induced cell death was also observed by Bcl-2/ΔBH1 expression (Fig. 7, C and D). Moreover, Bcl-2/G145A accelerated Bax-induced caspase-3(-like) protease activation under the conditions where wt Bcl"
https://openalex.org/W2041678886,"Biochemical and genetic studies implicate synaptotagmin (Syt 1) as a Ca2+ sensor for neuronal and neuroendocrine neurosecretion. Calcium binding to Syt 1 occurs through two cytoplasmic repeats termed the C2A and C2B domains. In addition, the C2A domain of Syt 1 has calcium-independent properties required for neurotransmitter release. For example, mutation of a polylysine motif (residues 189–192) reverses the inhibitory effect of injected recombinant Syt 1 C2A fragment on neurotransmitter release from PC12 cells. Here we examined the requirement of the C2A polylysine motif for Syt 1 interaction with the cardiac Cav1.2 (L-type) and the neuronal Cav2.3 (R-type) voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, two channels required for neurotransmission. We find that the C2A polylysine motif presents a critical interaction surface with Cav1.2 and Cav2.3 since truncated Syt 1 containing a mutated motif (Syt 1*1–264) was ineffective at modifying the channel kinetics. Mutating the polylysine motif also abolished C2A binding to Lc753–893, the cytosolic interacting domain of Syt 1 at Cav1.2 α1 subunit. Syt 1 and Syt 1* harboring the mutation at the KKKK motif modified channel activation, while Syt 1* only partially reversed the syntaxin 1A effects on channel activity. This mutation would interfere with the assembly of Syt 1/channel/syntaxin into an exocytotic unit. The functional interaction of the C2A polylysine domain with Cav1.2 and Cav2.3 is consistent with tethering of the secretory vesicle to the Ca2+ channel. It indicates that calcium-independent properties of Syt 1 regulate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and contribute to the molecular events underlying transmitter release."
https://openalex.org/W2126244633,"Pancreatic AR42J cells have the feature of pluripotency of the precursor cells of the gut endoderm. Dexamethasone converts them to exocrine cells or liver cells. Using mRNA differential display techniques, we have identified a novel Ca2+-dependent member of the mitochondrial solute carrier superfamily, which is expressed during the course of differentiation, and have designated it MCSC. The corresponding cDNA comprises an open reading frame of 1407 base pairs encoding a polypeptide of 469 amino acids. The carboxyl-terminal-half of MCSC has high similarity with other mitochondrial carriers, and the amino-terminal-half has three canonical elongation factor-hand motifs and has calcium binding capacity. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed 79.1% homology to the rabbit peroxisomal Ca2+-dependent member of the mitochondrial superfamily, but the subcellular localization of the protein was exclusively mitochondrial, not peroxisomal. Northern blot and Western blot analyses revealed its predominant expression in the liver and the skeletal muscle. In the liver, the expression level of MCSC was higher in the adult stage than in the fetal stage, and MCSC was highly up-regulated in dexamethasone-treated AR42J cells before the expression of albumin. Taken together, MCSC may play an important role in regulating the function of hepatocytes rather than in differentiation in vivo. Pancreatic AR42J cells have the feature of pluripotency of the precursor cells of the gut endoderm. Dexamethasone converts them to exocrine cells or liver cells.

Taken together, MCSC may play an important role in regulating the function of hepatocytes rather than in differentiation in vivo. Both endocrine and exocrine cells of the pancreas arise from epithelial cells in the pancreatic duct (1Teitelman G. Lee J.K. Dev. Biol. 1987; 121: 454-466Google Scholar, 2Pictet R.L. Clark W.R. Williams R.H. Rutter W.J. Dev. Biol. 1972; 29: 436-467Google Scholar). Recently embryonic stem cells have been shown to differentiate into insulin-secreting structures similar to the pancreatic islet (3Lumelsky N. Blondel O. Laeng P. Velasco I. Ravin R. Mckay R. Science. 2001; 292: 1389-1394Google Scholar), and embryonic endodermal cells included a bipotential precursor population for pancreas and liver (4Deutsch G. Jung J. Zheng M. Lora J. Zaret K.S. Development. 2001; 128: 871-881Google Scholar). Pancreas originates from the dorsal and ventral regions of the foregut endoderm (5Slack J.M. Development. 1995; 121: 1569-1580Google Scholar), and liver develops from the ventral foregut endoderm adjacent to where the ventral pancreas emerges (6Zaret K.S. Mech. Dev. 2000; 92: 83-88Google Scholar). This proximity of budding sites for the liver and the ventral pancreas has led us to understand which molecular mechanisms control the differentiation of these organs. Recent genetic studies indicate that pancreatic development depends on an integrated network of distinct transcription factors operating at various levels. A mouse homeobox protein, insulin promoter factor-1 (IPF-1/PDX-1), is required for the development of the pancreas (7Jonsson J. Carlsson L. Edlund T. Edlund H. Nature. 1994; 371: 606-609Google Scholar). Islet-1, BETA2/NeuroD, Pax4, and Pax6 are necessary for the development and generation of mature islet cells (8Ahlgren U. Pfaff S.L. Jessell T.M. Edlund T. Edlund H. Nature. 1997; 385: 257-260Google Scholar, 9Naya F.J. Huang H.P. Qiu Y. Mutoh H. DeMayo F.J. Leiter A.B. Tsai M.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2323-2334Google Scholar, 10Sosa-Pineda B. Chowdhury K.

The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein PTF1-p48 is essential for the formation of exocrine and the correct spatial organization of endocrine pancreas (12Krapp A. Knofler M. Ledermann B. Burki K. Berney C. Zoerkler N. Hagenbuchle O. Wellauer P.K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3752-3763Google Scholar). In an endoderm explant assay, redundant fibroblast growth factor signaling from the cardiac mesoderm is necessary and sufficient to induce hepatogenesis within the ventral foregut endoderm (13Jung J. Zheng M. Goldfarb M. Zaret K.S. Science. 1999; 284: 1998-2003Google Scholar). Pancreatic AR42J cells are derived from a chemically induced pancreatic acinar cell tumor and have the feature of pluripotency of the common precursor cells of the pancreas (14Rosewicz S. Vogt D.

We have shown that, when these cells were treated with activin A (Act) 1The abbreviations used are: Act, activin A; BTC, betacellulin; MCSC, mitochondrial Ca2+-dependent solute carrier; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; UTR, untranslated region; dpc, day postcoitum; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; Dx, dexamethasone and betacellulin (BTC) or hepatocyte growth factor, they differentiate into insulin-producing cells (16Mashima H.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3969-3976Google Scholar). When exposed to dexamethasone (Dx), they become more acinar-like cells (18Logsdon C.D. Mossner J. Williams J.A. Goldfine I.D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1200-1208Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that when exposed to Dx for a long period, these cells synthesize albumin and have the character of liver cells (19Shen C.N. Slack J.M.W. Tosh D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 879-887Google Scholar). In this way, AR42J cells resemble the precursor cells in the gut, which differentiate into the pancreas and the liver and provide an excellent in vitro model system to study the differentiation of these organs. To clarify the molecular mechanisms of differentiation, we used the method of mRNA differential display and identified several genes that were up- or down-regulated during differentiation (20Mashima H. Yamada S. Tajima T. Seno M. Yamada H. Takeda J. Kojima I. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 304-309Google Scholar). Among them, we have focused on one gene that was highly up-regulated by Dx and characterized it. This gene was predominantly expressed in the liver and the skeletal muscle and was expressed at a higher level in the adult stage compared with the fetal stage. It is a novel member of the Ca2+-dependent mitochondrial carrier superfamily. Recombinant human Act was provided by Dr. Y. Eto of Central Research Laboratory, Ajinomoto Inc. (Kawasaki, Japan). Recombinant human BTC (21Seno M. Tada H. Kosaka M. Sasada R. Igarashi K. Shing Y. Folkman J. Ueda M. Yamada H. Growth Factors. 1996; 13: 181-191Google Scholar) was generously provided by Dr. M. Seno of Okayama University (Okayama, Japan). Hep3B cells were provided by the Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Institute of Development, Aging, and Cancer, Tohoku University (Sendai, Japan). Hep3B cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mmol/liter HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4), 5 mmol/liter NaHCO3, and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37° under a humidified condition of 95% air and 5% CO2. For staining, cells were grown on non-coated coverslips. 20 μg of total RNA extracted from AR42J cells were denatured and blotted onto a Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Human MTN Blot and Human Digestive System 12-Lane MTN Blot were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probe and washed for 30 min under high stringency conditions (0.1× standard saline citrate (SSC), 0.1% SDS) or low stringency conditions (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 65° before exposure to x-ray film. From mRNA differential display, we obtained a 131-bp DNA fragment containing a putative poly(A) tail and a polyadenylation signal (20Mashima H. Yamada S. Tajima T. Seno M. Yamada H. Takeda J. Kojima I. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 304-309Google Scholar). cDNA was amplified using a gene-specific primer and a 5′-end-specific vector primer. Rat lung oligo(dT)-primed λZAPII cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used as a template. We first obtained a 956-bp cDNA fragment. A BLAST search using this fragment led to the identification of an expressed sequence tag from rat ovary mRNA (GenBankTM accession no. D86666), and we could extend the cDNA to 1128 bp. We went on gene walking by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a rat lung and brain cDNA library as a template. Finally we recovered the 3136-bp cDNA, which contained the 1407-bp open reading frame. The entire sequence of both strands was determined using an ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready reaction kit and an Applied Biosystems DNA sequencer 310 (Applied Biosystems, Cambridge, MA). To construct the MCSC expression vector, we amplified a fragment of MCSC (nucleotides 91–1507) by PCR using the sense primer (5′-ataagaatgcggccgctctcaccagcatgctctgcc-3′) and the antisense primer (5′-ccgctcgagtcatcaccgagactgcacgcccag-3′), followed by XhoI and NotI digestion. The fragment was subcloned into theXhoI/NotI sites of the vector pcDNA3.1/His (Invitrogen) and was verified by sequencing. pEGFP-Peroxi vector was purchased from Clontech. For transfection, FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used according to the manufacturer's instruction. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were fixed and stained. Protein extracts from rat liver, pancreas, stomach, colon, and skeletal muscle were prepared for immunoblotting as described previously (22Kanzaki M. Mashima H. Zhang Y.Q. Lu L. Shibata H. Kojima I. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 165-170Google Scholar). All rat experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the University of Tokyo Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. A polyclonal antibody against MCSC was raised by immunizing rabbits with peptide (C)KISEQQAEKILKSM (residues 113–126) conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanine. The antiserum was purified with a PD10 gel column (Amersham Biosciences). For Western blotting, membranes were blocked by incubation for 1 h with 10% blocking ace (Snow Brand, Japan) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After blocking, the membranes were incubated with anti-MCSC antibody (1:100 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 10 min, and incubated for 30 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit whole immunoglobulin (Nordic, 1:500 in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20). After washing, the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences) was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Exposure to x-ray film was applied 1–3 min at room temperature. To remove the probe, membranes were incubated with the stripping buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7) and 2% SDS for 30 min at 50°. Anti-actin-(1–19) antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For immunostaining, cells were grown on non-coated glass coverslips. Cells were fixed for 30 min in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, treated with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and incubated sequentially with Blocking Ace (Snow Brand, Tokyo, Japan), first antibody, and second antibody. Anti-Xpress Antibody (Invitrogen) was used to stain the exogenous MCSC. Second antibodies used in this study are indocarbocyanine (Cy3)-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, West Grove, PA). MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylinodole,dihydrochloride (DAPI) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used to stain mitochondria and nucleus respectively. The cells were examined under a light microscope (Axiophoto; Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). Total RNA was extracted from rat liver by using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). One-step RT-PCR was performed using SuperscriptTM One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. For semiquantitative RT-PCR, first-stranded cDNA was synthesized using SuperscriptTMfirst-stranded synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Oligonucleotide primers used were 5′-tgtgctagtttcccaggaacc-3′ (nucleotides 10–30) and 5′-tcagcaggaccagcccagcg-3′ (nucleotides 1671–1652) for the whole coding region of MCSC (1662-bp PCR product); 5′-tgtgagcatcagctacgtgg-3′ (nucleotides 1447–1466) and 5′-ggttccaggttctagcactag-3′ (nucleotides 2167–2147) for the semiquantitative RT-PCR of MCSC (721 bp PCR product); and 5′-tgagagggaaatcgtgcgtg-3′ (nucleotides 612–631) and 5′-gatccacatctgctggaaggtg-3′ (nucleotides 1071–1051) for β-actin (GenBankTM accession no. V01217, 460-bp PCR product). PCR cycles for semiquantitative RT-PCR were 25 for MCSC and 20 for β-actin. To construct the amino-terminal fragment of MCSC, we amplified a fragment of MCSC (residues 1–178) by PCR using the sense primer (5′-ccgctcgagcatgctctgcctgtgcctgtatg-3′) and the antisense primer (5′-ccgctcgagcactgtgaactcatctgggac-3′), followed byXhoI digestion. The fragment was subcloned into theXhoI site of the vector, pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences) and was verified by sequencing. Escherichia coli strain BL21 was transfected with the final construct or pGEX-4T-3. The purification of the GST fusion protein was essentially done according to the recommendation of the manufacturer of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were resolved in SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. 45Ca2+ overlay was then performed essentially as described (23Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 511-519Google Scholar). The membrane was washed in a solution containing 60 mmol/liter KCl, 5 mmol/liter MgCl2, and 10 mmol/liter imidazole-HCl (pH 6.8) for 1 h with three changes of the buffer. Then the membrane was incubated in the same buffer containing 10 μCi of 45Ca2+/ml for 10 min. After incubation, the membrane was rinsed twice with 40% ethanol for 5 min. Excess water was absorbed between two sheets of Whatman no. 1 filter paper, and the membrane was dried at room temperature and exposed to x-ray film at −80°. In mRNA differential display, we identified several novel genes up-regulated by more than 10-fold when AR42J cells were exposed to Dx (20Mashima H. Yamada S. Tajima T. Seno M. Yamada H. Takeda J. Kojima I. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 304-309Google Scholar). We only had small fragments of the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) with which to obtain the full-length cDNA of these genes. During the cloning experiments, some genes were recorded in the GenBankTM data base as glutaredoxin, adenine nucleotide translocator, and so on. We picked up one gene, which was highly up-regulated when exposed to Dx, and the size of mRNA was estimated to be about 3.5 kbp according to Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1). First we obtained the 131-bp 3′-fragment containing a putative poly(A) tail and a polyadenylation signal. Using the technique of gene walking by PCR and a BLAST search, we obtained the 3136-bp cDNA, which comprises an open reading frame of 1407 bp, a 100-bp 5′-UTR, and a 1638-bp 3′-UTR (Fig. 2 A).— There may be additional regions of the 5′-UTR to be cloned; however, there is an in-frame stop codon in the 5′-UTR of our sequence. The sequence just before the initiation codon is in good agreement with the Kozak sequence (24Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8132Google Scholar). A consensus polyadenylation signal (AATAAA), nucleotides 3115–3120, was located 15 bases before the poly(A) tail. The open reading frame encodes a predicted polypeptide of 469 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 52.7 kDa.Figure 2cDNA and protein sequences of MCSC.A, cDNA and protein sequences of MCSC are shown.

T50686): 61.6% identity and 79.1% similarity (Fig. 2 B), and Homo sapienscalcium-binding transporter (GenBankTM accession no.AF123303): 58.2% identity and 73.0% similarity. However, the first 51 amino acids have no homology with other proteins in the data base. The amino-terminal-half contains three well-conserved Ca2+-elongation factor (EF)-hand binding loops (residues 60–72, 91–103, and 127–139). These EF-hand domains are also conserved in Efinal (24Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8132Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal-half has substantial similarity with proteins of the mitochondrial solute carrier family (16.4–21.9% identity) (Fig. 2 C). The hydropathic profile of this region revealed six transmembrane domains, similar to other mitochondrial carriers (data not shown). We designated this protein as MCSC. Fig. 2 D depicts the phylogenetic tree of MCSC, Efinal, and other rat mitochondrial carriers. Recently human KIAA1896 protein (GenBankTM accession no. AB067483) has been reported in the data base (26Kikuno R. Nagase T. Waki M. Ohara O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 166-168Google Scholar). Residues 137–568 of this protein have 93.7% identity and 95.8% similarity with residues 50–469 of MCSC. With its strong homology, the KIAA1896 protein may be a human ortholog of MCSC, but the first 136 amino acids has no relationships with the first 49 amino acids of MCSC (Fig. 3). There may be an alternative splicing of MCSC but only one transcript could be seen on the Northern blot (Figs. 4 and 5). KIAA1896 may be an isoform encoded by different genes. We have to exclude the possibility of the merger of two cDNAs in MCSC cDNA. Using a rat liver total RNA as a template, we can amplify the whole coding region by RT-PCR (Fig.6). Recently mouse clone IMAGE: 4239441 (GenBankTM accession no. BC019978) and IMAGE: 5098924 (GenBankTM accession no. BC022114) have been recorded in the data base. At the nucleotide level these have 93.7% identity through nucleotides 61–2401 of MCSC and 99.5% identity at the protein level. These genes were predicted to be the mouse gene of MCSC but are 103 amino acids shorter than MCSC. This may result from the misidentification of the initiation codon. These are translated from the second ATG codon of their sequences. When translated from the first ATG codon, 103 amino acids are added, and there is a 99.1% identity over the whole region at the protein level (Fig. 3). During the preparation of this article, another version of the KIAA1896 protein was reported by NCBI Annotation Project (GenBankTMaccession no. XP 027668). This predicted KIAA1896 protein sequence was almost identical to that of MCSC over the whole coding region: 97.0% identity and 98.7% similarity. This gene might be the real human ortholog of MCSC. Some other proteins with high similarity to MCSC were reported in the data base: GenBankTM accession no.AAH05163, 95.2% similarity (H. sapiens, 311 amino acids);AAH37109, 88.1% similarity (mouse, 514 amino acids); BAB70825, 71.4% similarity (H. sapiens, 384 amino acids); XP 131097, 59.4% similarity (mouse, 475 amino acids, may be a mouse ortholog of Efinal). These proteins have high similarities at the carboxyl terminus of MCSC but have low similarities at the amino terminus. In particular, there are no similarities between the first 51 amino acids of MCSC and these proteins.Figure 4Northern blot analysis of MCSC expression in various tissues. mRNA (2 μg) isolated from various tissues was blotted onto a nylon membrane, and Northern blotting was performed using 32P-labeled MCSC cDNA.

The right lane is a size marker of HindIII-digested λ DNA. The band was confirmed by sequencing.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Northern blot analysis was carried out to examine the tissue distribution of MCSC. Samples of poly(A) mRNA isolated from human tissues were analyzed with labeled probe specific for MCSC. MCSC was expressed predominantly in the liver and the skeletal muscle as a single transcript (Fig. 4). With a long exposure time, weak levels of MCSC expression were detected in all the tissues examined (data not shown). Efinal was highly expressed in the colon, followed by small intestine and kidney. In the small intestine, the expression of Efinal was the lowest in duodenum and increased toward the distal part of the intestine (25Weber F.E. Minestrini G. Dyer J.H. Werder M. Boffelli D. Compassi S. Wehrli E. Thomas R.M. Schulthess G. Hauser H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8509-8514Google Scholar). We then examined the expression level of MCSC in digestive tract using the Human Digestive System 12-Lane MTN BLOT. Very weak levels of expression, compared with the liver, were detected through the esophagus to the rectum (Fig.5). Western blot analysis was then carried out to clarify endogenous MCSC protein expression in various rat tissues. The expression with a molecular mass of 53 kDa was detected in skeletal muscle and liver, consistent with Northern blot analysis (Fig. 7). To investigate the subcellular localization of MCSC protein, we performed immunofluorescence study using a specific antibody to MCSC. In the cytoplasm of Hep3B cells, both punctate and filamentous patterns were observed, consistent with MCSC protein being present in intracellular organelles (Fig. 8 A). We could not eliminate nuclear staining, but when we expressed the MCSC protein ectopically using the expression vector MCSC-pcDNA3.1/His, we could see immunostaining only in the cytoplasm (Fig. 8 B). So we believe nuclear staining is nonspecific. Omission of the primary antibody resulted in the complete absence of immunostaining (data not shown). To confirm that MCSC-positive cytoplasmic organelles were mitochondrial, we treated Hep3B cells with mitochondrial-specific fluorescent dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos to label mitochondria in the first antibody incubation step. As shown in Fig. 8 C, the MCSC staining pattern overlapped with that of mitochondria, demonstrating that MCSC is targeted to mitochondria. Efinal is mainly localized to peroxisomes, and some are expressed in mitochondria (25Weber F.E. Minestrini G. Dyer J.H. Werder M. Boffelli D. Compassi S. Wehrli E. Thomas R.M. Schulthess G. Hauser H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8509-8514Google Scholar). We then examined whether MCSC is targeted to peroxisomes. When the pEGFP-Peroxi vector is transfected to cells, it specifically targets to peroxisomal membranes. As shown in Fig.8 D, the staining pattern of MCSC and peroxisomes are not superimposable, indicating that MCSC is not expressed in peroxisomes. In rat liver strong immunoreactivity against MCSC was observed in the cytoplasm as punctate and round patterns compatible with its expression in mitochondria of hepatocytes (Fig.8 E). Since the amino terminus of MCSC contains three canonical EF-hands (residues 60–72, 91–103, and 127–139) that are predicted to bind calcium, we expressed a GST-tagged truncated version of MCSC (residues 1–178) in E. coli and purified it to homogeneity (Fig.9 A). The calcium binding ability of the polypeptide was demonstrated with a Ca2+-overlay method. As shown in Fig. 9 B, a truncated version of MCSC exhibits an affinity to calcium even in the SDS-denatured state. MCSC was up-regulated when AR42J cells were incubated with Dx and predominantly expressed in liver and skeletal muscle. Because MCSC might be involved in the differentiation of hepatocytes, we compared the expression level in the fetal stage (18.5-day postcoitum (dpc)), the neonatal stage (2-day-old), and the adult stage (9-week-old). As shown in Fig.10 A, the expression level of MCSC was the greatest in the adult stage. When we compared the mRNA level, the expression level of MCSC was higher in the adult stage (9-week-old) than in the fetal stage (18.5 dpc) (Fig. 10, Band C). In the present study, we have identified a novel cDNA, MCSC, encoding a protein with 469 amino acids belonging to a Ca2+-dependent member of the mitochondrial transporter superfamily. Mitochondrial carriers have a tripartite structure, made up of related sequences about 100 amino acids in length (27Palmieri F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 48-54Google Scholar). Each repetitive element contains two hydrophobic stretches separated by an extensive hydrophilic regions (I-II, III-IV, and V-VI) (27Palmieri F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 48-54Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal-half of MCSC is compatible with these criteria and has a homology with other mitochondrial carrier proteins (Fig. 2 C). An intriguing feature of MCSC is the presence of three EF-hand-like domains in the amino terminus (Fig. 2 B). The structural similarity by itself does not prove that EF-hand like domains of MCSC bind calcium, but the strong homology to Efinal, and the Ca2+ binding capacity of Efinal strongly suggest that EF-hand like domains of MCSC bind calcium. Another Ca2+binding member of mitochondrial carrier superfamily, Aralar (GenBankTM accession no. Y14494) was reported and was present in human muscle and brain (28Arco A. Satrustegui J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23327-23334Google Scholar). There are four EF-hand-like domains in the amino-terminal-half and a tripartite structure in the carboxyl-terminal-half of Aralar. There is a 16.8% identity between MCSC and Aralar, and the amino-terminal-half of Aralar also has calcium binding activity (28Arco A. Satrustegui J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23327-23334Google Scholar). We examined the Ca2+ binding properties of MCSC with a truncated protein, and the amino terminus of MCSC clearly showed Ca2+ binding activity (Fig. 9). Mitochondrial carriers are encoded by nuclear genes and have to be imported into the mitochondrial membranes. Like most mitochondrial carriers except phosphate and citrate carriers in mammals (29Runswick M.J. Powell S.J. Nyren P. Walker J.E. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1367-1373Google Scholar, 30Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11033-11040Google Scholar), MCSC has no obvious amino-terminal mitochondrial import sequence. The carboxyl-terminal Ser-Lys-Leu (SKL) sequence was the first recognized peroxisomal-targeting sequence (31Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Google Scholar). It is not present in MCSC. But without it, Efinal is mainly targeted to the peroxisomal membrane (28Arco A. Satrustegui J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23327-23334Google Scholar). Localization studies presented here show clearly that MCSC is expressed in mitochondria, not in peroxisome (Fig. 8, C andD). When expressed ectopically, MCSC was also located in mitochondria (Fig. 8 B). MCSC has three EF-hand-like domains in the amino terminus, and intracellular Ca2+ concentration may be related to the localization of MCSC. In rat hepatocytes, vasopressin, endothelin, and angiotensin II elevate intracellular Ca2+ concentration. When we add these secretagogues to the culture medium in Hep3B cells, there are no significant changes in the MCSC staining pattern (data not shown). AR42J cells were originally derived from a rat pancreatic acinar cell tumor. They possess both exocrine and neuroendocrine properties (14Rosewicz S. Vogt D. Harth N. Grund C. Franke W.W. Ruppert S. Schweitzer E. Riecken E.O. Wiedenmann B. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 80-91Google Scholar). Synthetic glucocorticoid, Dx, can increase the expression of amylase in AR42J cells and enhance the differentiation of AR42J cells toward the exocrine phenotype (18Logsdon C.D. Mossner J. Williams J.A. Goldfine I.D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1200-1208Google Scholar). When a subclone of AR42J cells, AR42J-B13, was incubated for more than 9 days with dexamethasone, the expression of amylase was almost gone, and the expression of albumin was observed, indicating that the cells converted into hepatocytes (19Shen C.N. Slack J.M.W. Tosh D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 879-887Google Scholar). Dx also induced the transdifferentiation of organ cultures of pancreatic buds from mouse embryo into hepatocytes (19Shen C.N. Slack J.M.W. Tosh D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 879-887Google Scholar). The liver and the pancreas originate from neighboring regions of the foregut endoderm (5Slack J.M. Development. 1995; 121: 1569-1580Google Scholar, 6Zaret K.S. Mech. Dev. 2000; 92: 83-88Google Scholar), and some molecular and cellular mechanisms are regulating the development of these two organs. MCSC was highly up-regulated when AR42J cells were incubated with Dx for 3 days (Fig. 1), and MCSC was predominantly expressed in the liver and skeletal muscle (Fig. 4). We therefore suggest that MCSC was up-regulated during the differentiation of AR42J cells toward hepatocytes rather than exocrine pancreas. Glucose-6-phosphatase is normally found in the liver as well as in the β-cells of pancreas and is one of the earliest differentiation markers. Glucose-6-phosphatase-positive cells could be seen after 3 days of addition of Dx in AR42J-B13 cells (19Shen C.N. Slack J.M.W. Tosh D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 879-887Google Scholar) when MCSC was up-regulated. In contrast, albumin, a liver-specific protein, started to appear after 9 days (19Shen C.N. Slack J.M.W. Tosh D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 879-887Google Scholar). Taken together, MCSC may play a role during the differentiation toward hepatocytes. Fibroblast growth factors have been implicated in the primary induction of the liver (6Zaret K.S. Mech. Dev. 2000; 92: 83-88Google Scholar). It remains to be seen whether fibroblast growth factors regulate the expression of MCSC. Western blotting and RT-PCR study showed that the expression level of MCSC was higher in the adult stage compared with the fetal stage and the neonatal stage (Fig. 10) indicating that MCSC may play an important role in regulating the function of hepatocytes rather than the differentiation in vivo. In the study of mRNA differential display, we have identified other mitochondrial carriers up- or down-regulated over the course of differentiation. Adenine nucleotide translocator was up-regulated when incubated with Dx, and citrate transporter-like protein was up-regulated when incubated with Act + BTC. 2H. Mashima, unpublished data. Similar to the importance of the ATP/ADP ratio in insulin secretion of pancreatic β-cells, the cellular environment resulting from the functions of these mitochondrial proteins including MCSC may be important in regulating the function and the differentiation of pancreas and liver. MCSC may act as a calcium binding/transducing protein by the transport of a solute. Further studies are needed to confirm our speculations.

https://openalex.org/W2014081461,"The effect of interferon (IFN)-γ on p11 expression was studied in two human epithelial cell lines (BEAS-2B and HeLa). Treatment with IFN-γ resulted in increased steady-state levels of p11 mRNA and protein expression, with a time-dependent and dose-dependent effect. Transient transfection experiments of a reporter gene construct containing −1498 bp of the 5′-flanking region of the p11promoter demonstrated that IFN-γ induced p11 gene expression at the transcriptional level. These effects were inhibited at the promoter and protein levels by a specific JAK-2 kinase inhibitor, AG-490. Functional analysis of the p11promoter indicates that two γ-activated sequence elements (GAS) located at positions −1219 and −1090 are important for the induction of the p11 promoter by IFN-γ. Transfection of mutated reporter constructs demonstrated that the mutation at the GAS-2 site (−1090) inhibited the p11 promoter activity, with a reduction of about ∼73% and mutation at the GAS-3 site (−1219) eliminated about 26% of the p11 promoter activity. A STAT1 dominant negative mutant vector at Tyr-701 (JAK kinase phosphorylation site) blocked the effect of IFN-γ on the p11 promoter activity. IFN-γ induced a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1 protein, which is involved in the binding to the GAS-2 site in the p11 promoter by EMSA analysis. These data suggest that IFN-γ-induced p11 expression is mediated through the binding of STAT1 to GAS sites in the p11 promoter. Inhibition of p11 expression by inhibitory antisense RNAs (iRNA) treatment resulted in enhanced IFN-γ and calcium ionophor-stimulated arachidonic acid release suggesting that at least in part IFN-γ-stimulated p11 expression may serve a counterregulatory role.

The S-100 protein family is a multigenic family of low molecular weight (9–11 kDa) calcium-binding proteins (1Moore B.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1965; 19: 739-744Google Scholar). S-100A10, known as p11 or calpactin I light chain, is a distinct member of S100 family because its two EF-hands carry mutations that limit its ability to bind calcium (2Gerke V. Weber K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2917-2920Google Scholar). p11 is a natural ligand of annexin II, forming an annexin II2-p112 heterotetramer (AIIt) 1The abbreviations used are: AIIt, annexin II·p11 heterotetramer; cPLA2, cytosolic phospholipase A2; IFN, interferon; GAS, IFN-γ activated sequence; γ-IRE, IFN-γ response element; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; JAKs, Janus family tyrosine kinases; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; GAPDH, glyceradehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; AA, arachidonic acid; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; CMV, cytomegalovirus; ANOVA, analysis of variance; RPA, ribonuclease protection assay; iRNA, inhibitory antisense RNAs (3Gerke V.

Angus C.W. Yao X.L. Logun C. Shelhamer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17145-17153Google Scholar). Antisense inhibition of p11 results in enhanced cPLA2 activity and increased AA release, whereas p11 overexpression reduces cPLA2 activity and AA release (12Yao X.L. Cowan M.J. Gladwin M.T. Lawrence M.M. Angus C.W. Shelhamer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17202-17208Google Scholar). Dexamethasone is known to reduce cPLA2activity, and recent studies suggest that this effect may be mediated by up-regulation of p11 (12Yao X.L. Cowan M.J. Gladwin M.T. Lawrence M.M. Angus C.W. Shelhamer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17202-17208Google Scholar). Recent data also suggest that retinoic acid-increased arachidonic acid release may be in part mediated by the reduction of p11 protein expression (13Gladwin M.T. Yao X.L. Cowan M. Huang X.L. Schneider R. Grant L.R. Logun C. Shelhamer J.H. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1103-L1109Google Scholar). Seung-Wook Kim et al. (14Kim S. Ko J. Kim J.H. Choi E.C. Na D.S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 243-248Google Scholar) have reported that annexin I and annexin II2-p112 but not annexin II inhibited cPLA2 activity. Taken together, these data suggest that p11 acts as a regulatory protein of cPLA2 and may play a role in the regulation of cPLA2 activity and AA release. IFN-γ is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is secreted by activated T-lymphocytes and natural killer cells and regulates cellular antiviral, antitumor, and immunological responses (15Kalvakolanu D.V. Borden E.C. Cancer Invest. 1996; 14: 25-53Google Scholar). IFN-γ has been reported to regulate cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and induce prostaglandin formation, which may play a major role in the induction of inflammatory processes (16Matsuura H. Sakaue M. Subbaramaiah K. Kamitani H. Eling T.E. Dannenberg A.J. Tanabe T. Inoue H. Arata J. Jetten A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29138-29148Google Scholar). IFN-γ also induces intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which plays an important role in the adherence and migration of leukocytes at sites of inflammation in several cell types (17Hou J. Baichwal V. Cao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11641-11645Google Scholar, 18Bennion S.D. Middleton M.H. David-Bajar K.M. Brice S. Norris D.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 71S-79SGoogle Scholar). The binding of IFN-γ to its surface receptor activates the receptor-associated tyrosine kinases, JAK1 and JAK2. JAKs tyrosine phosphorylate and activate the latent cytosolic transcription factor STAT1, which then dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, and binds to the γ-activated sequence (GAS) elements of IFN-γ response genes, resulting in gene activation (19Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Google Scholar, 20Heim M.H. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1995; 267: 1347-1349Google Scholar). IFN-γ stimulates an increase in PLA2 activity in a variety of cell lines (21Ponzoni M. Cornaglia-Ferraris P. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 893-898Google Scholar, 22Ponzoni M. Montaldo P.G. Cornaglia-Ferraris P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 17-21Google Scholar). IFN-γ also induces AA release, as well as cPLA2 gene transcription (23Wu T. Levine S.J. Lawrence M.G. Logun C. Angus C.W. Shelhamer J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 571-577Google Scholar). It was of interest to study the effect of IFN-γ on p11 expression. In this study we investigate the effect of IFN-γ on p11 transcription, steady-state levels of p11 mRNA and protein expression and the signal transduction pathway involved in human epithelial cells. HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. A human bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cell line (American Type Culture Collection) was grown in LHC-8 medium (Biofluids, Rockville, MD) without serum. All experiments were performed when cells were 80–90% confluent. For the time course experiments, after replacing culture medium at the same time, the cells were treated with or without 300 units/ml of IFN-γ at 4, 12, 24, or 48 h prior to harvest at the 48-h time point. For the dose response experiments, cells were treated with or without IFN-γ at the indicated dose for 24 h. For the inhibition experiment, cells were preincubated with AG-490 for 2 h before treatment with or without IFN-γ. Inhibitors were maintained for the incubation period. BEAS-2B and HeLa cells were grown on 175-cm2 collagen-coated tissue culture flasks (BD PharMingen Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and treated with IFN-γ (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Cells were harvested with trypsin (E-PET, Biofluids). After washing three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were resuspended in 50 mmHEPES buffer including Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and then sonicated three times for 15 s and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. Total protein was assayed by BCA reagent (Pierce). Ten micrograms of crude cell lysates were separated on 16% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen). p11 protein expression was detected by using 1:2000 dilution of mouse anti-p11 monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) and 1:5000 dilution horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, Inc, West Grove, PA). The blot was developed using the ECL Western blotting detection system (AmershamBiosciences) and exposed to radiographic film. BEAS-2B and HeLa cells were treated with and without IFN-γ. Total cellular RNA was extracted using Tri-reagent (Molecular Research Inc. Cincinnati, OH) and redissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) water. To construct the probe for p11 mRNA, a 319-bp product of p11 cDNA was amplified by PCR using the following set of sense and antisense primers: 5′ primer: 5′-ACCACACCAAAATGCCATCT-3′(corresponding to bases 61–80 of the human p11 cDNA sequence, GenBankTM accession numberM81457); 3′ primer: 5′-CTGCTCATTTCTGCCTACTT-3′ (corresponding to bases 361–379 of the p11 cDNA sequence). The PCR product was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Orientation of the insert was determined by DNA sequencing. The p11 cRNA probe and glyceradehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Ambion, Austin, TX) were radiolabeled using an in vitro transcription kit (Ambion) with SP6 polymerase and [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci (29.6TBq)/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). An RPA assay kit (RPAII, Ambion, Austin, TX) was used to quantitate target mRNA. Ten micrograms of total RNA (for GAPDH) or 50 μg (for p11) were mixed with 10,000 cpm (for GAPDH) or 20,000 cpm (for p11) of α-32P-labeled riboprobe, the mixture was hybridized at 45 °C overnight, and the unprotected RNA was digested by the addition of 1:100 dilution RNase A/T1 at 37 °C for 60 min. Digestion was terminated by the addition of RNase inactivation and precipitation mixture. The protected fragments were separated on 6% polyacrylamide 8m urea gels (Invitrogen) and visualized by autoradiography. The p11 coding region was released from p11-pET30a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). Two micrograms of purified p11 insert were sent to Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO), for screening of a human genomic P1 library. Two positive clones were obtained and amplified by company protocol. These clones were confirmed by Northern blot using 32P-endlabeled oligonucleotide 5′-GGCAGGACGGCCGGGTTCTT-3′, corresponding to bases 36–55 within the first exon of M77483, the reported sequence of human p11 (24Harder T. Kube E. Gerke V. Gene (Amst .). 1992; 113: 269-274Google Scholar). A positive band at a size of ∼1500 base pairs was obtained from one of the clones. The insert from the P1 plasmid was cloned into pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Plasmid DNA was fully sequenced bi-directionally in triplicate to obtain the sequence of the p11 5′-flanking promoter region from −1498 relative to the transcription start site to +89 (GenBankTM accession number AL450992). To create a p11-SEAP construct, p11promoter region was cloned into pSEAP2-Basic vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) by blunt ligation, and sequences were confirmed by bi-directional DNA sequencing. The designated name for this construct is SEAP-1498+89. To create a p11-pCAT construct, the p11 promoter region was cloned into pCAT basic vector (Promega). The designated name of this construct is pCAT-1498+89. 5′ deletion and mutation constructs were generated by PCR using a FailSafe PCR System (Epicentre Technology, Madison, WI) and ligated into the pCAT basic vector. The following sense and antisense primers were used: 5′-GGGGGTACCTACTGCCTTGGAAACTTAGT-3′ and 5′-TAAGAGCTCACCTTGGCCGA-3′ (to obtain the p11 promoter region from −1048 to +89) and 5′-GGGGGTACCGCGAGGCCTCTGCGA-3′ and 5′-TAAGAGCTCACCTTGGCCGA-3′ (to obtain the p11 promoter region from −188 to +89) to generate deletion plasmids pCAT-1048+89 and pCAT-188+89. pCAT-1498+89 plasmid was cut with BglII and religated into pCAT basic vector, which also cut with BglII to create the deletion construct pCAT-1434+89. The site-directed mutagenesis constructs were generated by ligation of two pieces of PCR product produced from backbone pCAT-1498+89. The reporter construct mutated at the GAS-2 site (TTCCAGAAA mutated to CTCGAGAGA) was created using the following two primer sets: 5′-GGGGGTACCGAGATTTCCT-3′ and 5′-AAGAATTCTCTCGAGTAAATTTAGA-3′ to produce the first PCR product from −1498 to −1073; and 5′-CTCTAAATTTACTCGAGAGAATTCTTCT-3′ and 5′-TAAGAGCTCACCTTGGCCGA-3′ to produce the second PCR product from −1093 to +89. Both PCR products were cut with EcoRI and ligated with T4 ligase. The ligation reaction was used as a template to create the GAS-2 mutation construct from −1498 to +89 with the primers 5′-GGGGGTACCGAGATTTCCT-3′ and 5′-TAAGAGCTCACCTTGGCCGA-3′. The mutation construct, GAS-3, (TTCCACCAA mutated toCTCGAGCAA) was created using the following two primer sets: 5′-GGGGGTACCGAGATTTCCT-3′ and 5′-CAGCTGTTGCTCGAGAAGAGCCCAAT-3′ to create a PCR product from −1498 to −1204 and 5′-ATTGGGCTCTTCTCGAGCAACAGCT-3′ and 5′-TAAGAGCTCACCTTGGCCGA-3′ to create a PCR product from −1231 to +89. Both PCR products were cut with XhoI and religated. The ligation mixture was used as a template to create the GAS-3 mutation construct from −1498 to +89 using the primers 5′-GGGGGTACCGAGATTTCCT-3′ and 5′-TAAGAGCTCACCTTGGCCGA-3′. The designated names for the mutation constructs are mGAS-2 and mGAS-3. The sequences of the deletion and mutation constructs were confirmed by bi-directional DNA sequencing. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The day before transfection, 5 × 105 cells were seeded into 6-well plates. 1.8 μg of p11 promoter constructs were cotransfected with 0.2 μg of the pCMV/β-gal construct (Clontech) into serum-free cells using 6 μl of the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) in each well. After 5 h of transfection, the cells were allowed to recover overnight in fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. For time course experiments, the SEAP-1498+89 construct was used. At the indicated time point, SEAP activity was measured in 25-μl aliquots of culture medium with a SEAP reporter assay kit according to the manufacturer (Tropix, Bedford, MA) in a luminometer (Packard Bioscience, Meriden, CN). At the final time point, the transfected cells were lysed and were centrifuged for 10 min. β-galactosidase activity was measured with a β-galactosidase ELISA kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Data are expressed as a ratio of SEAP activity to β-galactosidase activity. For dose response experiments, SEAP-1498+89-transfected cells were treated with different concentrations of IFN-γ for 24 h. SEAP and β-galactosidase activity were measured as described above. For deletion and mutation experiments, pCAT p11 promoter constructs were used. Cells were treated with 300 units/ml of IFN-γ for 24 h and then harvested. pCAT and β-galactosidase activity were assayed separately using pCAT and β-galactosidase ELISA kits according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The pCAT activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity to represent relative pCAT activity. For comparison between different constructs, the activities of the deletion and mutation constructs were expressed as a percentage of the full-length pCAT-1498+89 promoter construct that was set at 100%. Wild-type STAT1 and mutant STAT1 dominant negative expression plasmids were utilized. The wild-type STAT1 plasmid contains the human STAT1 cDNA (encoding the 750 amino acid STAT1 protein), the STAT1 dominant negative plasmid is mutated at amino acid 701 (the JAK1/2 phosphorylation site), pcDNA3.1 with no insert was used as a control vector. All three plasmids have a potent CMV promoter. HeLa cells were transfected with 1 μg of the p11 promoter construct pCAT-1498+89 alone or cotransfected with 1 μg of wild-type STAT1, mutant STAT1, or control vector pcDNA3.1 individually. Controls for transfection efficiency were performed using cotransfection with 0.2 μg of pCMV/β-gal. Transient transfection was performed as described above. After transfection, some cells were exposed into IFN-γ (300 units/ml) for 12 h. Cells were harvested, lysed, and pCAT and β-galactosidase activity were assayed by ELISA. HeLa cells were seeded into 6-well plates and cotransfected with the SEAP-1498+89 plasmid and pCMV/β-gal control plasmid as described above. Cells were pretreated with the JAK-2 kinase inhibitor AG-490 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) (50 μm or 100 μm) for 2 h, and then treated with or without IFN-γ (300 units/ml) for 24 h. SEAP and β-galactosidase activities were detected as described above. For p11 Western blot studies, HeLa cells were grown on T-75-cm2 flasks until 80% confluent. Cells were pretreated with AG-490 (100 μm) for 2 h and then incubated with IFN-γ (300 units/ml) for 12 h and lysed. Western blotting for p11 protein was performed as described above. HeLa cells were incubated with and without IFN-γ (300 units/ml) at 10 min, 30 min, 2, 4, 6, or 24 h prior to harvest at the 24-h time point, and nuclear extracts were prepared using a nuclear extraction kit according to the manufacturer's directions (Sigma). DNA binding was performed by incubating 2 μg of nuclear protein in a total volume of 10 μl of binding buffer (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05 μg/μl, poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 15% glycerol) and 10,000 cpm of32P-labeled double-stranded GAS-2 oligonucleotide 5′-TTATTCCAGAAAATTCTT-3′ for 20 min at room temperature. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 6% DNA retardation gel (Invitrogen) in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer at 250 V for 30 min. The dried gel was exposed to x-ray film (Kodak, Rochester, NY) with an intensifying screen at −70 °C overnight or until adequate signal was developed. For competition analysis, 50, 100, or 200× molar excess of the cold double-stranded oligonucleotide GAS-2 or nonspecific double-stranded oligonucleotide SP-1 consensus sequence was preincubated with nuclear extracts for 20 min at room temperature followed by an additional incubation for 15 min at room temperature with the labeled probe. To identify bands containing specific STAT1 protein, the sample was incubated with anti-STAT1α (provided by Dr. Jahar Haque) antibody for 1 h on ice before the DNA binding reaction was performed. For the immunoblot of STAT1 protein, 10 μg of crude cell lysate or nuclear extracts from HeLa cells were separated using 8% Tris-glycine gel, and Western blotting was performed as above with 1:1000 dilution of anti-phospho-STAT1 or anti-STAT1 polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) and 1:5000 dilution horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as second antibody. A Molecular Dynamics 301 computing densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) was used to digitalize images. The optical density of bands was analyzed with background subtraction using Image Quant software (Molecular Dynamics). iRNAs were prepared by IDT (Coralville, IA) and targeted bases 4–24 of the p11 coding sequence. Untemplated TT were added to the 3′-end of each strand. The iRNA sequences were 5′-CCACACCAAAAUGCCAUCTT-3′ and 5′-GAUGGCAUUUUGGUGUGGTT-3′. The single-stranded iRNAs were annealed by incubating a 100 μm concentration of each single strand in annealing buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm magnesium acetate) for 2 min at 90 °C. Cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected with 100 nmiRNA duplexes using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) (5 μl in 1 ml of culture media) for 5 h. After transfection, media was changed, and cells were labeled with [3H]AA (1 μCi/ml of culture media, Amersham Biosciences) for 16 h. Cells were then treated with or without IFN (300 units/ml) for 24 h. The effect of treatment of cells with iRNA duplexes on p11 protein levels was determined by immunoblotting of cell lysates. The effect of iRNA treatment on arachidonate release was determined by scintillation counting of media from labeled cells after treatment with the calcium ionophor A23187 or vehicle (Me2SO) for 30 min. Media was harvested and after centrifugation at 750 × g for 10 min, [3H]AA release was measured in a scintillation counter (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). The dose-related effects were analyzed with one-way ANOVA. For other experiments, comparisons with control were performed using a two-tailed unpaired Student's ttest. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Western blot studies demonstrated that p11 is constitutively expressed in BEAS-2B cells. IFN-γ (300 units/ml) increased p11 protein expression in BEAS-2B cells over a 4–48-h period, with a maximum effect observed at 12–24 h (Fig.1, A and B). Treatment of cells with 10, 100, 300, 1000 units/ml of IFN-γ for 24 h resulted in a dose-dependent increase in p11 protein levels (Fig. 1, C and D). As IFN-γ increased p11 protein levels in a human airway epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B cells, we further investigated the effect of IFN-γ on p11 expression in another epithelial cell line, HeLa cells. HeLa cells were treated with or without 300 units/ml of IFN-γ for 4–48 h or with IFN-γ (10, 100, 300, 1000 units/ml) for 24 h and p11 protein expression was determined by Western blot analysis. Fig. 2, A–D show that IFN-γ also induced a time and dose-dependent increase in p11 protein in HeLa cells. To determine if the observed increases in p11 protein levels correlate with changes in p11 mRNA expression, BEAS-2B cells were incubated with or without IFN-γ (300 units/ml) for 4–48 h or IFN-γ (10, 300, 1000 units/ml) for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated and steady-state p11 mRNA levels were studied by RPA. As shown in Fig. 3, A andB, IFN-γ treatment stimulated increased p11 mRNA levels over 4–48 h, compared with the untreated control cells. BEAS-2B cells treated with 10, 300, 1000 units/ml of IFN-γ for 24 h demonstrated a significant dose-related increase in steady-state p11 mRNA levels as shown in Fig. 3, C and D. GAPDH mRNA levels are presented as controls for equivalent RNA loading and to normalize for p11 mRNA expression. To further investigate if IFN-γ induced p11 mRNA expression was increased in HeLa cells, cells were incubated with or without IFN-γ (10, 300, 1000 units/ml) for 24 h, and the steady-state levels of p11 mRNA were measured by RPA. Untreated HeLa cells constitutively produced p11 mRNA, and IFN-γ treatment induced the steady-state p11 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4, A and B). To further investigate if the observed increase in steady-state p11 mRNA levels reflects an IFN-γ induced increase in p11 gene transcription, a reporter gene construct containing a 1498-bp sequence of the 5′-flanking region of thep11 promoter in the SEAP vector was created (SEAP-1498+89) and transient transfection of this p11 promoter construct into HeLa cells was accomplished as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are shown in Fig.5 A. IFN-γ (300 units/ml) treatment of HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase inp11 promoter activity (3–4-fold) over a 3–24 h time course. HeLa cells treated with IFN-γ (0, 30, 300 units/ml) for 24 h demonstrated a significant dose-related effect in relativep11 promoter activity as shown in Fig. 5 B. β-galactosidase activity was used to evaluate the transfection efficiency. These results demonstrate that IFN-γ induces p11 expression at the transcriptional level. To further understand the mechanism of IFN-γ induction of p11 expression, HeLa cells transfected with pSEAP-1498+89 promoter construct were pretreated with the JAK-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG-490 (50 or 100 μm) for 2 h and then treated with or without IFN-γ (300 units/ml) for 24 h. The results are presented in Fig. 6 and demonstrate that AG-490 significantly inhibited IFN-γ induced p11 promoter activity in a dose-related manner (p < 0.001,n = 6). AG-490 alone had no effect on p11promoter activity, indicating that it is not cytotoxic at the concentration used in this experiment. To confirm the pathway of IFN-γ induced p11 expression, HeLa cells were preincubated with AG-490 (100 μm) for 2 h and then treated with or without IFN-γ for 12 h. IFN-γ significantly increased p11 expression whereas in the cells pretreated with AG-490, this effect was substantially diminished as shown in Fig. 7,. Therefore, IFN-γ induced the expression of p11 was blocked by JAK-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor. In order to further study the transcriptional regulation of p11 promoter by IFN-γ, we characterized putative IFN-γ response elements in the p11 promoter. The sequence analysis of 1498 bp of the p11 5′-flanking promoter region for putative IFN-γ response elements is shown in Fig.8 A. There are three interferon GAS and one IFN-γ response elements (γ-IRE) located separately at positions −215 (GAS-1), −1090 (GAS-2), −1219 (GAS-3), and −1448 (γ-IRE) in the p11 promoter region. To determine the region responsible for the IFN-γ induced effect on p11 expression in the p11 promoter, p11 promoter deletion constructs were generated including pCAT-1498+89, pCAT-1434+89, pCAT-1048+89, pCAT-188+89. The deletion constructs (1.8 μg) were cotransfected with the pCMV/β-gal plasmid into HeLa cells. Cells were then treated with and without 300 units/ml of IFN-γ and harvested at 24 h. pCAT and β-galactosidase activities were assayed. The activity of the deletion constructs was evaluated as a percentage of −1498+89 (100%) construct activity. Compared with the p11promoter activity in the SEAP vector, IFN-γ also induced a similar activation (3–4-fold) of the full-length p11 promoter in the pCAT vector (Fig. 8 B). The removal of a 64-bp fragment (pCAT-1434+89), which includes a γ-IRE element did not have any effect on IFN-γ-induced p11 promoter activity. Further deletion to −1048 resulted in a reduced IFN-γ-induced p11promoter activity, suggesting that the fragment between −1434 and −1048 containing GAS-2 and GAS-3 sites is important for IFN-γ-induced p11 promoter activity. The deletion construct pCAT-1048+89, which contains the GAS-1 element did not exhibit a significant increase p11 promoter activity in response to IFN-γ activity. These data suggest that the region between −1434 and −1048 of the p11 promoter, containing two potential GAS elements, plays a critical role in the IFN-γ induction of p11 expression. To ascertain the role of the GAS-2 and GAS-3 elements in IFN-γ-induced p11 promoter activity in the context of the full-length reporter construct, two full-length mutation constructs (mGAS-2, mGAS-3) were created (Fig.9 A). HeLa cells were transfected with the wild-type pCAT-1498+89, mGAS-2 or mGAS-3 promoter construct. As shown in Fig. 9 B, mutation of the GAS-2 site significantly diminished IFN-γ-induced p11 promoter activity, with a reduction about ∼73% of p11 promoter activity compared with that of the full-length wild-type pCAT-1498+89 promoter construct. Mutation of the GAS-3 site inhibited to a lesser degree (about 26% reduction) the IFN-γ-induced p11promoter activity of the wild-type pCAT-1498+89 promoter construct. These data"
https://openalex.org/W2055196354,"Cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) are the most frequently formed lesions in UV-irradiated DNA. CPDs are repaired by the nucleotide excision repair pathway. Additionally, they are subject to transcription-coupled DNA repair. In the general model for transcription-coupled DNA repair, an RNA polymerase arrested at a lesion on the transcribed DNA strand facilitates repair by recruiting the repair machinery to the site of the lesion. Consistent with this model, transcription experiments in vitro have shown that CPDs in the transcribed DNA strand interfere with the translocation of prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNA polymerases. Here, we study the behavior of RNA polymerase when transcribing a template that contains two closely spaced lesions, one on each DNA strand. Similar DNA templates containing no CPD, or a single CPD on either the transcribed or the nontranscribed strand were used as controls. Using an in vitro transcription system with purified T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) or rat liver RNAP II, we characterized transcript length and efficiency of transcription in vitro. We also tested the sensitivity of the arrested RNAP II-DNA-RNA ternary complex, at a CPD in the transcribed strand, to transcription factor TFIIS. The presence of a nearby CPD in the nontranscribed strand did not affect the behavior of either RNA polymerase nor did it affect the reverse translocation ability of the RNAP II-arrested complex. Our results additionally indicate that the sequence context of a CPD affects the efficiency of T7 RNAP arrest more significantly than that of RNAP II.

It has been nearly two decades since the discovery that in UV-irradiated cells of eukaryotes and prokaryotes the transcribed strand of an active gene is repaired more rapidly than the nontranscribed strand (1Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 2Mellon I. Hanawalt P.C. Nature. 1989; 342: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). However, the mechanistic details of this phenomenon, termed transcription-coupled repair (TCR), 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, transcription-coupled repair; CPD, cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; T7 RNAP, T7 RNA polymerase; RNAP II, RNA polymerase II; TFIIS, transcription factor SII; AdMLP, adenovirus major late promoter.1The abbreviations used are: TCR, transcription-coupled repair; CPD, cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; T7 RNAP, T7 RNA polymerase; RNAP II, RNA polymerase II; TFIIS, transcription factor SII; AdMLP, adenovirus major late promoter. are still not fully understood. The general model for the mechanism of TCR postulates that an RNA polymerase stalled at a lesion is the signal for recruitment of the repair proteins and initiation of excision repair (3Hanawalt P.C. Science. 1994; 266: 1957-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In the case of UV-induced DNA lesions, such as the most frequently formed cis-syn CPDs, the specific repair process requires that an oli-gonucleotide containing the damaged site is excised from the DNA, the gap created is closed by repair replication, and finally the repair patch is ligated to the contiguous DNA (reviewed in Refs. 4Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington D. C.1995Google Scholar and 5Svejstrup J Q. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). An active RNA polymerase is a prerequisite for TCR (6Christians F.C. Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 1992; 74: 93-101Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 7Leadon S.A. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23175-23182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10696-10700Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, the arrested polymerase must then be displaced so that the lesion becomes accessible to the repair machinery (3Hanawalt P.C. Science. 1994; 266: 1957-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, a transcription-repair coupling factor (Mfd) has been shown to displace the stalled polymerase and facilitate TCR (9Selby C.P. Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, however, it is still not clear how the arrested polymerase signals the assembly of the repair machinery at the site of damage, nor is it clear how the polymerase is displaced to allow access of the repair proteins to the damaged site. Despite the evidence that incomplete transcripts, because of RNA polymerase arrest at the site of damage, are released in E. coli (9Selby C.P. Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), such a mechanism has not been confirmed for eukaryotes. Especially in the case of very large transcription units such as the 2.5-megabase dystrophin gene, it would seem energetically wasteful for the cell to abort transcription and release the incomplete nascent transcript. One of the models for the mechanism of TCR in higher organisms proposes that the polymerase might back up, allowing accessibility of repair enzymes to the damaged site, and then transcription could resume once the lesion is repaired (3Hanawalt P.C. Science. 1994; 266: 1957-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 10Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.-S. Reines D. Hanawalt P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 11Tornaletti S. Hanawalt P.C. Biochimie. 1999; 81 (Paris): 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The transcription factor TFIIS, which facilitates transcription through natural pause sites, may participate in this mechanism. TFIIS is widely distributed in eukaryotes and enables RNAP II to resume transcription after arrest at pause sites and to complete long RNA transcripts (12Wind M. Reines D. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Evidence from experiments in vitro suggests that TFIIS binds to an arrested polymerase and activates its cryptic 3′ > 5′ endonuclease activity, resulting in the hydrolysis of the nascent transcript at internal phosphodiester bonds. It is believed that the 3′-hydroxyl group of the resulting shorter transcript is then correctly placed in the catalytic site of the enzyme such that nucleotide polymerization can resume (13Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1342-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar).In vitro transcription systems with DNA templates containing different types of lesions have proved very useful for demonstrating that several types of lesions in the transcribed DNA strand can block transcription by different RNA polymerases (reviewed in Ref. 11Tornaletti S. Hanawalt P.C. Biochimie. 1999; 81 (Paris): 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). These findings are in agreement with the proposed model for TCR that requires an arrested RNA polymerase to signal the recruitment of the repair enzymes to the damaged site (14Mellon I. Bohr V.A. Smith C.A. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8878-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). CPDs in the transcribed strand block transcription elongation by mammalian RNAP II (10Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.-S. Reines D. Hanawalt P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 11Tornaletti S. Hanawalt P.C. Biochimie. 1999; 81 (Paris): 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). They also block transcription elongation by T7 RNAP although less efficiently (15Smith C.A. Baeten J. Taylor J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21933-21940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When present on the nontranscribed strand, CPDs do not impede transcription elongation by RNAP II (reviewed in Ref. 11Tornaletti S. Hanawalt P.C. Biochimie. 1999; 81 (Paris): 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Depending upon the sequence context, however, they can affect the rate of elongation or stalling of the polymerase (16Tornaletti S. Donahue B.A. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31719-31724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study we examined the behavior of T7 RNAP and mammalian RNAP II when transcribing a template that contains two closely spaced lesions, one on each strand, to investigate their possible combinatorial effect upon transcription elongation. For this purpose, we have employed an in vitro transcription system with T7 RNAP or RNAP II from rat liver, and a set of DNA templates that contain no CPDs, a CPD either on the transcribed or on the nontranscribed strand, or two CPDs, one on each strand. All lesions were positioned downstream of the prokaryotic T7 promoter or the eukaryotic adenovirus major later promoter (AdMLP). We found that when two lesions were present in the DNA template, transcription arrest of both T7 RNAP and RNAP II occurred at the same location as in the template with a single CPD in the transcribed strand, indicating that the CPD in the nontranscribed strand had no effect on the response of either polymerase.It was demonstrated previously that when RNAP II from rat liver is stalled at a CPD in vitro, addition of TFIIS caused cleavage of the nascent transcript and reverse translocation of the polymerase, up to 35 nucleotides upstream of the lesion without disruption of the ternary complex (17Tornaletti S. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24124-24130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This facilitated repair of the CPD when a small repair enzyme, photolyase, was added into the reaction; subsequent resumption of transcription past the repaired site was documented. We tested the effect of TFIIS on the behavior of RNAP II by transcribing the template with the two closely opposed lesions and observed the same cleavage pattern with the template carrying a single CPD on the transcribed strand.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, and T7 RNAP were purchased from New England Biolabs. T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from Invitrogen. Radiolabeled nucleotides were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. RNAP II, transcription initiation factors, and TFIIS purified from rat liver or recombinant sources, as described previously, were obtained from Dr. Daniel Reines (18Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10510-10517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Highly purified NTPs were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. D44 IgG anti-RNA antibodies (19Eilat D. Hochberg M. Fischel R. Laskov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3818-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were purified from rodent ascites fluid as described (18Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10510-10517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and formalin-fixed Staphylococcus aureus was obtained from Calbiochem. Custom made DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Qiagen. Oligonucleotides containing site-specific CPDs, constructed as described previously (20Ordoukhanian P. Taylor J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3783-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 21Taylor J.S. Brockie I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5123-5136Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), were obtained from Dr. John-Stephen Taylor (Washington University, St. Louis, MO).Preparation of Templates for in Vitro Transcription with T7 RNA Polymerase—Four DNA templates, 139 bp long, containing the T7 promoter and (a) no CPDs, (b) a CPD on the transcribed strand, (c) a CPD on the nontranscribed stand, or (d) two CPDs, one on each DNA strand and 29 nucleotides apart, were constructed (Fig. 1A). The templates were constructed by annealing and ligating together nine oligonucleotides. A 54-mer (5′-TACGTCGAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGATCTAGACAT CATGGCGACCA-3′), a 15-mer (5′-CACCCGTCCTGTGGA-3′), a 12-mer (5′-TCGAGAAGCTTG-3′), and a 58-mer (5′-GTACCCTGCAGTACACGGTACCAGGCTTAAGGGATCACGC ATCGTCCACACA TTATAC-3′) were used for the nontranscribed strand and a 57-mer (5′-GGTGTGGTCGCCATGATGTC TAGATCTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAATTTCGACGT-3′), a 34-mer (5′-CTGCAGGGTACCAA GCTT CTCGATCCACAGGACG-3′), a 12-mer (5′-TGGTACCGTGTA-3′), a 13-mer (5′-GATCCCTTAAGCC-3′), and a 23-mer (5′-CGTATAATGTGTGGACGATGCGT-3′) for the transcribed strand. Depending upon which of the four templates was required (Fig. 1A), the 12-mer of the nontranscribed DNA strand (5′-TCGAGAAGCTTG-3′) and the 13-mer of the transcribed strand (5′-GATCCCTTAAGCC-3′) did or did not contain a thymine dimer. 50 pmol of each oligonucleotide, apart from the 54-mer and the 23-mer, which constituted the 5′ end of each strand in the final construct, were phosphorylated with 20 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase in a mixture containing the “forward buffer,” (70 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), supplied by the manufacturer (Invitrogen), supplemented with ATP to a final concentration of 1 mm. The mixture was then incubated for 10 min at 70 °C to inactivate the T4 kinase followed by the addition of 50 pmol of the 54- and the 23-mer. Samples were heated for 3 min at 95 °C and then slowly cooled down to room temperature. The annealed oligonucleotides were ligated overnight with T4 DNA ligase at 16 °C. Ligation was carried out in 100 μl final volume, using the supplied T4 DNA ligase buffer and 10 units of T4 DNA ligase and following the instructions of the manufacturer, with the exception that additional ATP to a final concentration of 1 mm was added into the reaction. Ligation products were precipitated with ethanol, and samples were resuspended in formamide dye (94% formamide, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and loaded on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel in Tris borate-EDTA (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 8.3 m urea. The singlestranded 139-bp DNA fragments were purified from the gel, heated for 2 min at 95 °C, and allowed to reanneal by slowly cooling down to room temperature.Preparation of Templates for in Vitro Transcription with RNAP II—Four DNA templates, 391 bp long and containing the AdMLP, upstream from a short region with no cytosine residues on the transcribed strand, which results in a region in the RNA without guanine residues (G-less cassette) and (a) no CPDs, (b) a CPD on the transcribed strand, (c) a CPD on the nontranscribed stand, or (d) two CPDs, one on each DNA strand, were constructed. The undamaged control template was isolated as a 391-bp BstNI fragment from plasmid pVIK14Z containing the promoter and the G-less cassette. pVIK14Z (this study) is a derivative of pUCH2 (17Tornaletti S. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24124-24130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It was created by digesting pUCH2 with the restriction endonucleases BamHI and SphI and cloning a 72-bp sequence into those sites. This sequence was derived by annealing together two oligonucleotides, a 72-mer (5′-CCAGGATGTGTGGACGATGCGATCCCTTAAGCCCCCACAACCAGCGTCGACCCAAACGTCCCTCTTTCGACG3′) and an 80-mer (5′-GATCCGTCGAAAGAGGGACGTTTGGGTCGACGCTGGTTGTGGGGGCTTAAGGGATCGCATCGTCCACACATCCTGGCATG-3′). To construct the other three damaged templates, a 327-bp BstNI-Hpy99I fragment was isolated from the previous template and purified from a 2% agarose gel. The remaining sequence of the 391-mer was reconstructed using five oligonucleotides, a 14-mer (5′-AAAGA GGGACGTTT-3′) and a 50-mer (5′-GGGTCGACGCTGGTTGTGGGGGCTTAAGGGATCGCATCGTCCACACATCC-3′) for the coding strand and a 39-mer (5′-CGGCGCTCGGGCGTCTGCAGAAACGTCCCTCTTTCGACG-3′), a 13-mer (5′-GATCCCTTAAGCC-3′), and an 18-mer (5′-AGGATGTGTGGACGATGC-3′) for the template strand. Depending on the template to be constructed, the 14-mer (5′-AAAGAGGGACGTTT-3′) and the 13-mer (5′-GATCCCTTAAGCC-3′) did or did not contain a thymine dimer. 200 pmol of each of the five oligonucleotides were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, heated for 2 min at 95 °C, and allowed to anneal by slowly cooling down to room temperature. The oligonucleotides were then allowed to ligate overnight at 16 °C with T4 DNA ligase in the reaction buffer supplemented with 1 mm ATP. The ligated fragments (a 60-mer and a 70-mer) were precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in formamide dye, and electrophoresed on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was then stained with ethidium bromide, and the bands containing the 64- and 70-base fragments were cut out and eluted from the gel. Each fragment either contained or did not contain a thymine dimer. To obtain the final full-length products for the three templates carrying lesions (Fig. 1B), three more ligation reactions were set up using the conditions described above. Each contained 500 ng of the 327-bp BstNI-Hpy99I fragment purified earlier and (a) the 64-mer with the CPD and the 70-mer (to create the template with the lesion in the nontranscribed strand), (b) the 64-mer and the 70-mer with the CPD (to create the template with the lesion in the transcribed strand), or (c) both fragments with the CPD (to create the template with the two lesions). The two lesions were engineered to be 26 bp apart. Ligation products were again precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in formamide dye, and purified from a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel as single-stranded 391-bp fragments. To obtain the double-stranded DNA templates for transcription, these fragments were heated for 2 min at 95 °C and reannealed by slowly cooling to room temperature.Transcription Reactions with T7 RNA Polymerase—Transcription by T7 RNAP was initiated in a reaction containing 5 ng of DNA, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (3000 μCi/mmol), 100 μm ATP, 212 units of RNasin, and 50 units of T7 RNAP in a total volume of 10 μl. The first six nucleotides of the transcribed DNA strand contained only C and T followed by an A (Fig. 1A). Incubation at 37 °C for 5 min allowed T7 RNAP to transcribe up to position 6, after which a UTP was required for further transcription. Up to this position, four radiolabeled GTP ribonucleotides were incorporated into RNA. This uniform labeling of the transcripts enables their quantification regardless of their length and consequently number of GTPs in the sequence. The addition of 600 ng of heparin at this point prevented further reinitiation of transcription from the promoter and allowed the study of transcripts that were produced by a single round of transcription. Elongation resumed following addition of 100 μm CTP, UTP, and GTP. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped with 2% SDS in 0.2 m Tris-HCl-EDTA and 10 μg of proteinase K. Nucleic acids were precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in formamide loading dye, heated to 95 °C, and electrophoresed through an 8% polyacrylamide gel in Tris borate-EDTA (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 8.3 m urea. Gels were dried, autoradiographed, and analyzed using a Bio-Rad GS-363 phosphorimaging device.Transcription Reactions with RNAP II—100 ng of each DNA template were used in the transcription reaction. Transcription reactions were performed as described previously (18Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10510-10517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, preinitiation complexes were formed by incubating rat liver protein fractions D (2 μg, containing TFIID and TFIIH), B (1 μg, TFIIF/TFIIE), recombinant rat TFIIB (3 ng), and rat liver RNAP II (0.5 μg) at 28 °C for 30 min. 20 μm ATP and UTP and 40 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (800 μCi/mmol) were added to the reaction for the labeling of nascent transcripts. Transcription was synchronized as all transcribing polymerases paused at position 15, at which the first GTP was required for further elongation. Nascent transcripts up to this position have incorporated up to six radiolabeled CTP ribonucleotides. This allows quantitation of the relative amounts of RNA transcripts independently of their length. The addition of heparin at this step (600 ng), before the addition of all four NTPs, prevented new initiations and resulted in a single round of transcription elongation for each DNA template that was active for transcription (18Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10510-10517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of 800 μm of each NTP allowed elongation to proceed. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 28 °C. RNA transcripts were precipitated with D44 anti-RNA antibodies and formalin-fixed S. aureus as described (18Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10510-10517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For transcript analysis, RNA was ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in formamide dye, heated to 95 °C, and electrophoresed through an 8% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. For TFIIS-mediated transcript cleavage, the immunopurified, arrested complexes were incubated with 2 ng of TFIIS in 60 μl of reaction buffer containing 7 mm MgCl2 for 1 h at 28 °C (17Tornaletti S. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24124-24130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).RESULTSEffect of Closely Spaced CPDs, One on Each DNA Strand, on Transcription Elongation by T7 RNAP—Four DNA templates (Fig. 1A), 139 bp long, were prepared to be used in an in vitro transcription system with RNA polymerase from bacteriophage T7. They were assembled by annealing and ligating together nine oligonucleotides, two of which, one on each strand, did or did not contain a thymine dimer. The final ligation products resulted in four templates with the T7 promoter and (i) no CPDs, (ii) a CPD in the nontranscribed strand, 52 nucleotides downstream of the +1 transcription initiation site, (iii) a CPD in the transcribed strand, 82 nucleotides downstream of the +1 transcription initiation site, or finally (iv) one CPD present on each strand. The presence of the lesions at the predicted site was confirmed by digestion with T4 endonuclease V (22Gordon L.K. Haseltine W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 12047-12050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23van Zeeland A.A. Smith C.A. Hanawalt P.C. Mutat Res. 1981; 82: 173-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which nicks at the site of a CPD (data not shown).Full-length run-off transcription from the control template with no CPDs resulted in an RNA transcript of 112 ribonucleotides (Fig. 2, lane 2). The presence of a CPD in the nontranscribed strand had no effect on transcription by T7 RNAP and resulted in transcripts that were also 112 nucleotides long (Fig. 2, lane 3). When the two templates with the lesion in the transcribed strand were used for transcription, a shorter transcript, 82 ribonucleotides long, predominated (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 5). This transcript corresponded to the sequence length between the transcription start site and the lesion. However, in contrast with the results with mammalian RNAP II, where the lesion on the transcribed strand is a complete block for the eukaryotic polymerase (Refs. 10Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.-S. Reines D. Hanawalt P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar and 11Tornaletti S. Hanawalt P.C. Biochimie. 1999; 81 (Paris): 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar and this study), about 45% of the T7 RNA polymerase molecules were able to bypass the lesion and produce full-length run-off transcripts (Fig. 2, lane 4, Fig. 3, and Fig. 4A). Similar results were observed when the second CPD was present in the nontranscribed strand (Fig. 2, lane 5, and Fig. 3, Fig. 4B). To determine whether there were any differences in the rate of accumulation of the truncated and full-length transcripts we measured the time course of transcription after 15 s, 30 s, 45 s, 1 min, 2.5 min, and 5 min after all RNA molecules were synchronized at position 6 (see “Experimental Procedures”) and heparin and ribonucleotides were added into the reaction mixture (Figs. 3 and 4). We observed that at earlier time points, there is a higher rate of accumulation of the truncated transcripts compared with full-length transcripts. However, at later time points, some of the initially paused polymerases were able to bypass the lesion and give rise to full-length transcripts (Figs. 3 and 4). The presence of the second CPD on the nontranscribed strand did not affect the relative rate of accumulation of the two transcripts.Fig. 2Transcription elongation by T7 RNAP using damaged templates.

All four templates have the identical nucleotide sequence and contain the adenovirus major late promoter and a G-less cassette that allows synchronization of the transcribing polymerases and radioactive labeling of the transcript before the addition of GTP into the transcription reaction. The first template contained no CPDs. The second template, contained a CPD positioned in the nontranscribed strand, 178 bases downstream of the transcription initiation site. The third template contained a CPD in the transcribed strand, 206 bases downstream of the transcription initiation site, and the forth one contained both lesions of the two previous templates (Fig. 1B).The same full-length run-off transcript was observed when either the undamaged control template or the template containing a CPD in the nontranscribed strand was used as a template in the transcription reaction (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 3). When the CPD was present in the transcribed strand, a transcript shorter than the full-length run-off transcript was produced (Fig. 5, lane 4). The length of this shorter transcript corresponded to that synthesized by an RNA polymerase molecule that had translocated up to the site of the lesion. The same result was obtained when the DNA contained a second CPD in the nontranscribed strand, located 26 bases upstream of that in the transcribed st"
https://openalex.org/W2149742198,"DNA polymerase η (Polη) is a member of a new class of DNA polymerases that is able to copy DNA containing damaged nucleotides. These polymerases are highly error-prone during copying of unaltered DNA templates. We analyzed the relationship between bypass efficiency and fidelity of DNA synthesis by introducing substitutions for Tyr-52, a highly conserved amino acid, within the human DNA polymerase η (hPolη) finger domain. Most substitutions for Tyr-52 caused reduction in bypass of UV-associated damage, measured by the ability to rescue the viability of UV-sensitive yeast cells at a high UV dose. For most mutants, the reduction in bypass ability paralleled the reduction in polymerization activity. Interestingly, the hPolη Y52E mutant exhibited a greater reduction in bypass efficiency than polymerization activity. The reduction in bypass efficiency was accompanied by an up to 11-fold increase in the incorporation of complementary nucleotides relative to non-complementary nucleotides. The fidelity of DNA synthesis, measured by copying a gapped M13 DNA template in vitro, was also enhanced as much as 15-fold; the enhancement resulted from a decrease in transitions, which were relatively frequent, and a large decrease in transversions. Our demonstration that an amino acid substitution within the active site enhances the fidelity of DNA synthesis by hPolη, one of the most inaccurate of DNA polymerases, supports the hypothesis that even error-prone DNA polymerases function in base selection."
https://openalex.org/W2067341830,"d-3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli is a tetramer of identical subunits that is inhibited when l-serine binds at allosteric sites between subunits. Co-expression of two genes, the native gene containing a charge difference mutation and a gene containing a mutation that eliminates serine binding, produces hybrid tetramers that can be separated by ion exchange chromatography. Activity in the hybrid tetramer with only a single intact serine binding site is inhibited by ∼58% with a Hill coefficient of 1. Thus, interaction at a single regulatory domain interface does not, in itself, lead to the positive cooperativity of inhibition manifest in the native enzyme. Tetramers with only two intact serine binding sites purify as a mixture that displays a maximum inhibition level that is less than that of native enzyme, suggesting the presence of a population of tetramers that are unable to be fully inhibited. Differential analysis of this mixture supports the conclusion that it contains two forms of the tetramer. One form contains two intact serine binding sites at the same interface and is not fully inhibitable. The second form is a fully inhibitable population that has one serine binding site at each interface. Overall, the hybrid tetramers show that the positive cooperativity observed for serine binding is mediated across the nucleotide binding domain interface, and the negative cooperativity is mediated across the regulatory domain interface. That is, they reveal a pattern in which the binding of serine at one interface leads to negative cooperativity of binding of a subsequent serine at the same interface and positive cooperativity of binding of a subsequent serine to the opposite interface. This trend is propagated to subsequent binding sites in the tetramer such that the negative cooperativity that is originally manifest at one interface is decreased by subsequent binding of ligand at the opposite interface. d-3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli is a tetramer of identical subunits that is inhibited when l-serine binds at allosteric sites between subunits. Co-expression of two genes, the native gene containing a charge difference mutation and a gene containing a mutation that eliminates serine binding, produces hybrid tetramers that can be separated by ion exchange chromatography. Activity in the hybrid tetramer with only a single intact serine binding site is inhibited by ∼58% with a Hill coefficient of 1. Thus, interaction at a single regulatory domain interface does not, in itself, lead to the positive cooperativity of inhibition manifest in the native enzyme.

Pizer L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2090-2098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sugimoto E. Pizer L.I. J. Biol.

PGDH is a tetramer of identical subunits and contains four catalytic sites as well as four effector sites (4Schuller D. Grant G.A. Banaszak L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Each subunit is composed of three distinct domains, the substrate binding domain, the cofactor binding domain, and the serine binding or regulatory domain. Subunits make contact between adjacent regulatory domains at the regulatory domain interface (rdi) and between adjacent nucleotide binding domains at the nucleotide binding domain interface (ndi). The four catalytic sites are formed at the junction between the substrate and cofactor binding domains, and the four effector sites are formed at the two regulatory domain interfaces (Fig.1). Hydrogen bonds to serine are contributed by both subunits at the regulatory domain interface, and serine appears to tether the two domains together through this hydrogen bond network (4Schuller D. Grant G.A. Banaszak L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 5Al-Rabiee R. Zhang Y. Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23235-23238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Two distinctive cooperative processes appear to function in the inhibition of the enzyme by l-serine. First, the inhibition of activity in response to serine binding displays a sigmoidal behavior with a Hill coefficient of ∼2. Secondly, serine binding itself displays characteristics of both positive and negative cooperativity (6Grant G.A. Xu X.L. Hu Z. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2501-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated (7Grant G.A. Hu Z. Xu X.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17844-17850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8Grant G.A. Hu Z. Xu X.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1078-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that these two processes can be uncoupled by specific amino acid residue mutations, producing mutant enzymes that have lost their cooperativity of inhibition while maintaining their cooperativity of serine binding. In addition, the degree of cooperativity in serine binding is affected by the binding of NADH (9Grant G.A. Hu Z. Xu X.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39548-39553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and the presence of phosphate ion (10Grant, G. A., Xu, X. L., Hu, Z., and Purvis, A. R.Biochemistry 38, 16548–16552.Google Scholar) without an appreciable concomitant effect on the cooperativity of inhibition. These observations have led to the suggestion that the enzyme functions through distinct structural pathways that can be uncoupled by mutations or interactions with solvent constituents. Whereas these pathways may share structural elements, their uncoupling by mutation also demonstrates that they diverge structurally at some point. Thus, the interaction of these pathways and the interplay of specific catalytic and effector sites are of critical importance to understanding the regulatory mechanism. Because PGDH is composed of four identical subunits, a mutation made in one subunit will occur symmetrically in all subunits. This property makes it difficult to separate intra-subunit effects from inter-subunit effects and to elucidate the precise relationship of one individual site to another. In order to address this, it is necessary to produce hetero-tetramers where the sites are modified asymmetrically. Similar studies utilizing hybrid oligomers have been reported forl-lactate dehydrogenase from Bifidobacterium longum (11Fushinobu S. Kamata K. Iwata S. Sakai H. Ohta T. Matsuzawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25611-25616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 12Fushinobu S. Ohta T. Matsuzawa H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 15539-15545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although these enzymes are homo-tetramers like PGDH, they differ significantly in the arrangement of their substrate and effector binding sites. B. longuml-lactate dehydrogenase contains only two effector sites but has four active sites (14Iwata S. Kamata K. Yoshida S. Minowa T. Ohta T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The effector sites in l-lactate dehydrogenase are formed by residues from adjacent subunits, whereas the active sites are basically contained within each subunit. Fructose 1,6-biphosphatase contains four effector sites and four active sites (15Choe J-Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8565-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The substrate binding sites in fructose 1,6-biphosphatase are at subunit interfaces, and the effector sites are contained within individual subunits. In PGDH, it is the effector sites that are found at subunit interfaces, and the substrate sites for PGDH interact with residues from adjacent subunits. In addition, the active site of PGDH is found in a distinct cleft between two subunit domains that is predicted to open and close during catalysis and remain closed in the inhibited state (4Schuller D. Grant G.A. Banaszak L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thus, there are distinct differences among these enzymes that could uniquely contribute to significant differences in their mode of action. This study describes a method for producing and isolating specific hybrid tetramers of PGDH and analyzes the properties of PGDH tetramers containing zero, one, two, three, and four high-affinity serine binding sites. Protein was isolated and initially purified from bacteria utilizing 5′ AMP-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described previously (16Al-Rabiee R. Lee E.J. Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13013-13017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17Schuller D.J. Fetter C.J. Banaszak L.J. Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2645-2648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was determined by the change in absorbance at 340 nm due to the conversion of NADH to NAD+at pH 7.5 (18Tobey K.L. Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12179-12183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using α-ketoglutarate as the substrate (19Zhao G. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). All PGDH constructs used in this study are based on PGDH 4CA, which is a form of PGDH in which the 4 cysteine residues in the PGDH subunit have been mutated to alanine residues. This construct behaves similarly to native PGDH and has been widely used in previous studies (5Al-Rabiee R. Zhang Y. Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23235-23238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 6Grant G.A. Xu X.L. Hu Z.

The kcat and I0.5 for serine are identical to those of the native enzyme, and the Kmfor α-ketoglutarate is 5-fold higher than that of the native enzyme (16Al-Rabiee R. Lee E.J. Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13013-13017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is chosen so that it can be used later for introduction of reporter groups at specific places on the subunit through new cysteine residues. For the sake of simplicity, this construct will be assumed as the background in all subsequent descriptions and will not be referred to specifically. Hybrid or mixed tetramers were produced by expressing two individual PGDH genes on the same plasmid under control of a single promoter. The plasmid pTrc PGDH (16Al-Rabiee R. Lee E.J. Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13013-13017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was used to construct two intermediate plasmids, pTrc PGDH 1a andpTrc PGDH 1b (Fig. 2).pTrc PGDH 1a was made by introducing an XhoI site just after the stop codon and before the HindIII site inpTrc PGDH. This gene contained a charge difference mutation and a sequence tag as well as the native serine binding site residues. Charge variation was introduced into PGDH by the mutation of four surface glutamate residues (Glu-45, Glu-49, Glu-386, and Glu-387) to arginine residues. A sequence tag was introduced by mutating a valine residue at position 4 to an alanine residue. In this way, when hybrid tetramers are formed from this subunit (pTrc PGDH 1a) and a subunit containing the native valine residue (pTrc PGDH 1b), the exact ratio of subunits in the tetramer can be determined quantitatively by automated Edman sequencing. PTH-alanine and PTH-valine yield similarly (Val/Ala = 0.939 ± 0.002) in Edman sequencing so that integration of their peaks provides an accurate estimate of the subunit ratios. This construct is called 4ER/V4A, and the Km, kcat, and IC50 for l-serine for this construct are essentially indistinguishable from those of the unmutated enzyme. pTrc PGDH 1b was made by introducing an XhoI site just before the NcoI site in pTrc PGDH. This gene contained the mutation of the serine binding site, N364A. Asn-364 is one of the three serine binding residues found in the regulatory domains of PGDH. This mutation decreases the IC50 for serine from 10 μm in the native enzyme to 48 mm in the mutant (5Al-Rabiee R. Zhang Y. Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23235-23238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This effectively renders the site incapable of binding serine over the range of serine concentrations used in this study. Mutations were produced in either pTrc PGDH 1a or pTrcPGDH 1b by PCR as described previously (16Al-Rabiee R. Lee E.J. Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13013-13017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in preparation for production of pTrc PGDH duo/serine. pTrcPGDH duo/serine was produced by placing theXhoI/HindIII fragment from pTrc PGDH1b into the XhoI/HindIII sites in pTrcPGDH 1a. Simultaneous expression of both genes in pTrc PGDHduo/serine was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and isolated with a 5′ AMP-Sepharose affinity column as described previously (17Schuller D.J. Fetter C.J. Banaszak L.J. Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2645-2648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hybrid tetramers containing zero to four high-affinityl-serine binding sites were produced by expression ofpTrc PGDH duo/serine. Mutant hybrid tetramers were purified by chromatography on QAE-Sepharose in 1 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 60 mm KSCN and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.5 m. Fractions were pooled and dialyzed against appropriate buffers before further purification or analysis. Pools that were not well resolved into homogeneous tetramers were re-chromatographed on QAE-Sepharose using the same conditions with a gradient from 0 to 0.3 m NaCl. The distribution of subunits within a pool was determined by automated Edman sequencing of the sequence tag region as described above. Serine inhibition plots were fit to the Hill equation (20Neet K.E. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 139-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21Bell J.E. Bell E.T. Proteins and Enzymes. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey1988: 465-470Google Scholar), I=Imax[L]n/[I0.5]n+[L]nEquation 1 where Imax is the maximum inhibition, I is the fractional inhibition, L is the concentration of ligand, nis the Hill coefficient, and I0.5 is the inhibitor concentration at half-maximal inhibition. Protein concentration was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. Serine binding was measured by equilibrium dialysis in 200-μl dialysis chambers (Sialomed, Inc., Columbia, MD) purchased from the Nest Group (Southborough, MA). Dialysis was performed for 16 h withl-3[H]serine in appropriate concentrations of unlabeled l-serine. Cells were sampled in triplicate, and the average of 10-min counts was used to calculate concentrations of free and bound l-serine. The nominal PGDH concentration was 5–10 μm tetramer in all binding experiments, and all binding was performed in the presence of 100 μm NADH. Serine binding data were fit to the Adair equation (21Bell J.E. Bell E.T. Proteins and Enzymes. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey1988: 465-470Google Scholar) for one (Eq. 2), two (Eq. 3), three (Eq. 4), or four (Eq.5) sites using Kaleidograph (Synergy Software) as described previously (6Grant G.A.

The Adair equations in the form of dissociation constants are shown below.Y=(L/K1)/(1+(L/K1))Equation 2 Y=(L/K1)+(2L2/K1K2)/(2(1+(L/K1)+(L2/K1K2)))Equation 3 Y=(L/K1)+(2L2/K1K2)+(3L3/K1K2K3)/Equation 4 (3(1+(L/K1)+(L2/K1K2)+(L3/K1K2K3)))Y=(L/K1)+(2L2/K1K2)Equation 5 +(3L3/K1K2K3)+(4L4/K1K2K3K4)/(4(1+(L/K1)+(L2/K1K2)+(L3/K1K2K3)+(L4/K1K2K3K4)))where Y is the fractional occupancy, L is the free ligand concentration, and Ki values are the stepwise Adair constants. Plots of Y versus free serine concentration were constructed with Y =r, Y = r/2, Y =r/3, and Y = r/4 for tetramers containing one, two, three, and four functional serine binding sites, respectively. For the tetramer pool with two mutant sites, where three species are present (see Fig. 3), the Adair equation was modified as shown below to account for each species.Y=(1/3((L/K1a)+(2L2/K1aK2a)/(2(1+(L/K1a)+(L2/K1aK2a))))+(1/3((L/K1b)+(2L2/K1bK2b)/(2(1+(L/K1b)+(L2/K1bK2b))))Equation 6 +(1/3((L/K1c)+(2L2/K1cK2c)/(2(1+(L/K1c)+(L2/K1cK2c)))) Intrinsic site dissociation constants were calculated from the Adair constants by using the following statistical relationships for a molecule where n sites are available and whereKi′ values are the intrinsic dissociation constants (20Neet K.E. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 139-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).n=2sites;K1′=2K1,K2′=K2/2Equation 7 n=3sites;K1′=3K1,K2′=K2,K3′=K3/3Equation 8 n=4sites;K1′=4K1,K2′=3K2/2,K3′=2K3/3,K4′=K4/4Equation 9 The expression ofpTrc PDGH duo/serine is expected to produce a mixture of mutated hybrid tetramers as depicted in Fig.3. Single species should be produced for hybrid tetramers containing zero, one, three, and four mutated serine binding sites. On the other hand, three species would be expected for the hybrid tetramer containing two mutated serine binding sites. However, because of the binding site symmetry and the fact that serine binds between subunits, two of these (the bottom two in themiddle column in Fig. 3) are expected to be functionally equivalent because they contain one binding site at each interface. Unless otherwise noted, these two forms were treated equivalently. Each group of tetramers will have different charge properties corresponding to the number of 4ER/V4A subunits they contain. The initial separation of the hybrid tetramers produced by the expression of pTrc PGDH duo/serine is shown in Fig.4. Peaks were pooled and analyzed by Edman degradation. Pools that were heterogeneous with respect to tetramer content as judged by the Val/Ala ratio were re-chromatographed as described under “Materials and Methods” (data not shown). The homogeneity of the final tetramer pools based on subunit distribution is shown in Table I. The kinetic parameters presented in Table II are similar for all hybrid tetramers, suggesting that the active sites are not compromised by the various mutations used.Table IStoichiometry of hybrid tetramers of PGDHPoolAla1-aEach sample is taken from the pools shown in Fig. 3.

The tetramer with four intact serine binding sites produced the expected inhibition pattern, which is similar to unmutated PGDH, where the Hill coefficient is ∼2, and inhibition of activity is >95%. The tetramer with only three intact serine binding sites also displayed inhibition of activity of >95% but displayed a diminished sensitivity to serine at intermediate concentrations. The Hill coefficient was also reduced to a value of ∼1.6. The tetramer pool with only two intact serine binding sites produced a Hill coefficient of ∼1.2 but showed even more reduction in sensitivity to serine and a reduced total inhibition of activity of ∼85–90%. The tetramer with only a single serine binding site displayed a Hill coefficient of 1, but its activity is inhibited only ∼58%. As expected, the tetramer with no intact serine binding sites was not inhibited by serine.Table IIISerine inhibition parametersMutant subunits/ tetramerFunctional effector sites/tetramernS0.5ImaxX2R042.16 ± 0.111.5 ± 0.10.98 ± 0.010.0206490.99735131.60 ± 0.174.3 ± 0.30.96 ± 0.020.0247990.99546221.20 ± 0.117.6 ± 0.80.89 ± 0.030.0157070.99535311.03 ± 0.067.7 ± 0.50.58 ± 0.010.0014920.9981440No inhibition observedParameters were derived from fitting the data to the Hill equation.n is the Hill coefficient, S0.5 is the serine concentration at one-half the maximum inhibition level, Imax is the maximum inhibition level, X2represents the cumulative deviation between the data and the fit, andR is the correlation coefficient.

The serine binding curves fitted to the appropriate Adair equations are presented in Fig.6, and the derived dissociation constants are presented in Table IV. Note that all serine binding experiments were performed in the presence of saturating NADH, which moderates the degree of cooperativity (9Grant G.A. Hu Z. Xu X.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39548-39553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of serine binding measured for these mutants correlates well with the expected number of intact serine binding sites. The data for tetramers with one, three, and four intact serine binding sites can be fit satisfactorily with Adair equations derived for the respective number of sites. A special case exists for the tetramer with only two intact serine binding sites. As shown in Fig. 3, three species are predicted statistically, and based on symmetry, at least two of these are expected to be functionally equivalent. Attempts to fit the data to a single Adair equation for two sites failed to produce a satisfactory fit. However, when the fit was attempted for an Adair equation composed of three successive two-site equations with equal weight, the fit shown in Fig. 6 was achieved. This fit produced binding parameters (shown in Table IV as three separate entries) that indicated that two of the three predicted species were equivalent. This corresponds to the predicted functional equivalency of two of the three species based on symmetry considerations.Table IVSerine binding parametersMutated sites4-aMutant sites per hybrid tetramer.0124-bDerived from an Adair equation summing three components with two constants each.34K13.0 ± 1.46.2 ± 2.520.0 ± 0.00038.3 ± 0.00078.3 ± 0.000712.7 ± 0.9No bindingK23.5 ± 2.03.8 ± 1.4VL4-cVL, very large i.e. >104.6.8 ± 0.00096.8 ± 0.0009K313.6 ± 6.6112 ± 23K418.7 ± 5.5K1′124-dValues for intrinsic constants are determined from the Adair constants by the statistical relationships presented under “Materials and Methods” and rounded to the nearest integer.1940171713K2′54VL33K3′937K4′5X24-eFitting statistics: R is the correlation coefficient, and X2 is the sum of the residuals.0.007880.023530.022040.06257R4-eFitting statistics: R is the correlation coefficient, and X2 is the sum of the residuals.0.997480.989570.994980.97159Binding data are expressed as dissociation constants (μm).

A complete set of hetero-tetramers of PGDH have been produced and isolated that differ sequentially in the number of functional serine binding sites that they contain. This has been accomplished by co-expression of two genes for PGDH in E. coli. One gene contained the single serine binding site mutation, and the other gene contained the native serine binding site as well as charge mutants on the surface of the subunit and a sequence tag at the amino terminus of the polypeptide chain. Upon expression and folding, the subunits combined to give the expected mixture of tetramers, which were then separated on an ion exchange column by virtue of the number of charge-mutated subunits each tetramer contained. The stoichiometry of the hetero-tetramers was verified by automated Edman sequencing of the sequence tag region. The serine inhibition profiles of the hybrid tetramers display distinctly different patterns. The activity of the tetramer containing only a single intact serine binding site (three mutated sites) is inhibited to only ∼58%. The simplest explanation for this observation is that the binding of a single effector molecule at one rdi can effectively inhibit both active sites in the subunits that contribute to that interface. The observation that the extent of inhibition is slightly greater than 50% also suggests that there may be a small influence on the activity of the catalytic sites in the other two subunits as well. This presumably results from a conformational change induced by the binding of the first serine ligand. The Hill coefficient of this tetramer is 1, which also suggests that interaction across this regulatory domain interface does not, in itself, produce the cooperativity of inhibition of catalytic activity seen in the native enzyme. However, this same interaction undoubtedly contributes to cooperativity of binding of subsequent ligands in the native enzyme. This interpretation is also consistent with the observation that all of the other hybrid tetramer pools, all of which contain tetramers that bind serine at both regulatory domain interfaces, display positive cooperativity for serine inhibition. Because this tetramer contains only a single serine binding site, no cooperativity of serine binding is possible, and the data produce a hyperbolic binding curve yielding a single dissociation constant. The results for the tetramer species containing two and three intact binding sites are particularly revealing. The pool containing tetramers with only two intact serine binding sites (two mutant sites) displays a maximum level of inhibition of activity that is less than that of native enzyme. This suggests the presence of a population of tetramers whose activity is unable to be fully inhibited. Indeed, the distribution of mutant tetramers shown in Fig. 3 predicts that one-third of the tetramers will bind serine at only one regulatory domain interface. This species would be expected to behave similarly to the tetramer with only a single serine binding site discussed above because serine interaction occurs only at one interface. That is, its activity should be ∼58% inhibited at maximum. Thus, if the activity of one-third of the species is inhibited to ∼58% of total, and that of two-thirds of the species is inhibited ∼98%, the catalytic activity of the whole population would be inhibited by ∼85%, which is what is seen experimentally. Fitting the binding data to three successive Adair equations for two binding sites each produces a fit that partitions the species in a one-third and two-thirds distribution of total as predicted. The species predicted to bind serine at both regulatory domain interfaces shows positive cooperativity for the second ligand. The species predicted to have both intact serine binding sites at the same regulatory domain interface solves with extreme negative cooperativity for the second ligand. This is consistent with the hypothesis (6Grant G.A. Xu X.L. Hu Z. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2501-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that the potential binding of two effector molecules at a single interface could explain the negative cooperativity of ligand binding if a single effector molecule was capable of stabilizing the association of the two domains to the extent that it could exclude or partially exclude the binding of the second ligand. Fitting the serine inhibition profile of the pool with two intact serine binding sites to two successive Hill equations weighted for the predicted distribution of these species produces a fit (Fig.7) in which the smaller population (one-third) displays a Hill coefficient of <1 (0.67 ± 0.42) and an I0.5 of 45 μm, and the larger population (two-thirds) displays a Hill coefficient of >1 (1.4 ± 0.18) and an I0.5 of 6 μm. The I0.5 for this smaller population is quite close to the Kd (40 μm) determined for serine binding of the tetramer with one intact serine binding site (see Table IV). The larger population has a Hill coefficient indicating positive cooperativity and an S0.5 within the range for the Kd values determined for this population from serine binding. Thus, both the multicomponent Adair equation and the multicomponent Hill equation produce fits that indicate that the population at one-third of the total species basically mimics the characteristics of the tetramer with only a single intact serine binding site. The tetramer with three intact serine binding sites (one mutated site) has a Hill coefficient of 1.6 and displays nearly complete inhibition at higher serine concentrations. The serine binding parameters show the expected positive cooperativity for the second ligand and negative cooperativity for the third ligand. However, note that the negative cooperativity for the third ligand, which binds at the same interface as the first ligand, is not as extreme as that seen for the tetramer with two intact serine sites at the same interface discussed above. This suggests that the binding of the second ligand at the interface opposite to that where the first ligand binds is exerting its own positively cooperative effect on the opposite interface. Although the dissociation constant for the third ligand is higher than that for the first two, indicating negative cooperativity, it is significantly lower than if it were not being influenced by an interaction at the opposite regulatory domain interface. This apparent lessening of negative cooperativity is seen to an even greater degree for the unmutated tetramer in which all four sites interact with serine. Taken together, these results reveal a pattern in which binding of serine to a second site at the same interface is negatively cooperative, and binding of serine to a second site on the opposite interface is positively cooperative. Fig.8 depicts this concept in diagrammatic form. The positive cooperativity observed for serine binding is mediated across the ndi and is a result of a conformational change induced at the second interface that increases the binding affinity for ligand at that interface. At the same time, binding at a particular interface is negatively cooperative for additional ligand binding at that interface but can be modified by interaction at the opposite interface. In terms of the nomenclature used in Fig. 8, binding at site 1 enhances affinity at site 2 but reduces affinity at site 3. However, subsequent binding at site 2 moderates the negative cooperativity at site 3 to the extent that measurable ligand binding takes place. Similarly, binding to site 3 ameliorates the negative effect that occupancy at site 2 exerts on site 4 so that measurable binding also occurs at site 4. Overall, the binding of a single serine at each interface produces substantial inhibition of all four active sites in a positively cooperative manner. This appears to be the major factor in the regulation of the enzyme. Binding of additional serines has a lesser effect but does incrementally increase the degree of inhibition obtained and incrementally decreases the subsequent dissociation constants (higher affinity). However, because two regulatory domain interfaces regulate four active sites, the binding of a second serine at each interface may not play a significant role in the regulation of the enzyme. The picture of PGDH that is emerging from these and previous studies suggests that there is a significant entropic element to the regulation of this enzyme. PGDH has anecdotally been inferred to be a very flexible tetramer because of the large amount of “open space” in its crystal structure and the great difficulty that has been encountered in obtaining stable crystals of the uninhibited enzyme. This mobility has been shown to be most likely due to the movement of rigid domains about flexible hinges between each of the three domains in each subunit (7Grant G.A. Hu Z. Xu X.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17844-17850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8Grant G.A. Hu Z. Xu X.L. J. Biol.

Binding of serine at the rdi is predicted to draw the domains together to produce a tetramer with diminished freedom of inter-domain motion. The diminished freedom of motion experienced at one regulatory domain interface translates to the opposite regulatory domain interface as a result of producing a more rigid tetramer overall. The increasing rigidity results in an inability of the enzyme to turn over rather than a decrease in the ability of substrates to bind, consistent with the observation that it is largely a “V”-type enzyme (2Sugimoto E. Pizer L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2081-2089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This investigation has allowed the determination of the order of binding of effector molecules to PGDH and provided evidence to discern the characteristics of individual effector binding sites and how they directly effect the characteristics of the other binding sites and the active sites. Additional investigations with hybrid tetramers containing other mutations will continue to define the site to site relationship in this enzyme as well as the structural elements that mediate the process."
