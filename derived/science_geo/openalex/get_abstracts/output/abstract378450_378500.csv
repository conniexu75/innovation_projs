https://openalex.org/W2091270241,"Recent studies of the routes of worldwide introductions of alien organisms suggest that many widespread invasions could have stemmed not from the native range, but from a particularly successful invasive population, which serves as the source of colonists for remote new territories. We call here this phenomenon the invasive bridgehead effect. Evaluating the likelihood of such a scenario is heuristically challenging. We solved this problem by using approximate Bayesian computation methods to quantitatively compare complex invasion scenarios based on the analysis of population genetics (microsatellite variation) and historical (first observation dates) data. We applied this approach to the Harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis (HA), a coccinellid native to Asia that was repeatedly introduced as a biocontrol agent without becoming established for decades. We show that the recent burst of worldwide invasions of HA followed a bridgehead scenario, in which an invasive population in eastern North America acted as the source of the colonists that invaded the European, South American and African continents, with some admixture with a biocontrol strain in Europe. This demonstration of a mechanism of invasion via a bridgehead has important implications both for invasion theory (i.e., a single evolutionary shift in the bridgehead population versus multiple changes in case of introduced populations becoming invasive independently) and for ongoing efforts to manage invasions by alien organisms (i.e., heightened vigilance against invasive bridgeheads)."
https://openalex.org/W1985529376,"Caspase-8 is a cysteine protease activated by membrane-bound receptors at the cytosolic face of the cell membrane, initiating the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Caspase-8 activation relies on recruitment of inactive monomeric zymogens to activated receptor complexes, where they produce a fully active enzyme composed of two catalytic domains. Although in vitro studies using drug-mediated affinity systems or kosmotropic salts to drive dimerization have indicated that uncleaved caspase-8 can be readily activated by dimerization alone, in vivo results using mouse models have reached the opposite conclusion. Furthermore, in addition to interdomain autoprocessing, caspase-8 can be cleaved by activated executioner caspases, and reports of whether this cleavage event can lead to activation of caspase-8 have been conflicting. Here, we address these questions by carrying out studies of the activation characteristics of caspase-8 mutants bearing prohibitive mutations at the interdomain cleavage sites both in vitro and in cell lines lacking endogenous caspase-8, and we find that elimination of these cleavage sites precludes caspase-8 activation by prodomain-driven dimerization. We then further explore the consequences of interdomain cleavage of caspase-8 by adapting the tobacco etch virus protease to create a system in which both the cleavage and the dimerization of caspase-8 can be independently controlled in living cells. We find that unlike the executioner caspases, which are readily activated by interdomain cleavage alone, neither dimerization nor cleavage of caspase-8 alone is sufficient to activate caspase-8 or induce apoptosis and that only the coordinated dimerization and cleavage of the zymogen produce efficient activation in vitro and apoptosis in cellular systems.

IntroductionCaspases are a family of cysteine proteases that can be broadly divided by function into the inflammatory caspases and the apoptotic caspases (reviewed in Refs. 1Fuentes-Prior P. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 201-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 2Pop C. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21777-21781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Although the former group, which includes caspase-1, -4, and -5, is involved in the innate immune response through the cleavage-induced maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the majority of the mammalian caspases are involved in the initiation and execution of apoptosis.The apoptotic caspases, caspase-2, -3, and -6–10, can be further divided based on protein architecture and mode of activation. Caspase-2 and -8–10 are termed the “initiator” or “apical” caspases and are composed of a long N-terminal prodomain containing protein-protein interaction motifs and a C-terminal catalytic domain, often composed of an ∼20-kDa large subunit containing the active site cysteine and an ∼10-kDa small subunit (3Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). The initiator caspases are present in the cytosol of nonapoptotic cells as inactive monomers and are activated by recruitment to large protein complexes where they are induced to dimerize by protein-protein interactions with their prodomains. Once dimerized, initiator caspases undergo a series of autocleavage events at aspartic acid residues in their interdomain linker regions (4Pop C. Timmer J. Sperandio S. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 269-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 5Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A.

Cell. 2003; 11: 543-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Caspase-8 is first cleaved at one of two aspartic acid residues (Asp-374 or -384) between its large and small subunits and subsequently at one of three such residues (Asp-210, -216, or -223) between the large subunit and prodomain (Fig. 1A) (7Chang D.W. Xing Z. Capacio V.L. Peter M.E. Yang X. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4132-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The resulting fully active enzyme is made up of a dimer of catalytic domains, each composed of a large and a small subunit.The executioner caspases, caspase-3, -6, and -7, share the large and small subunit architecture of the initiator caspases but lack long prodomains. Their mechanism of activation is also distinct from that of the initiators. The executioner caspases are present in the cytosol of nonapoptotic cells as inactive dimers and are activated by cleavage of the linker region between the large and small subunits by activated initiator caspases. This cleavage event causes intramolecular rearrangements and produces a fully active caspase enzyme (8Riedl S.J. Shi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar).Caspase-8 is the initiator caspase responsible for initiation of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis in mammals. Caspase-8 is activated when the monomeric zymogen is recruited to the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) 4The abbreviations used are: DISCdeath-inducing signaling complexTNFtumor necrosis factorFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidPipes1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidTEVtobacco etch virusb-biotin-fmkfluoromethyl ketoneGFPgreen fluorescent proteinWTwild typeFKBPFK506-binding proteinafc7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin. formed at the cytoplasmic tail of activated receptors of the TNF family through homotypic interactions with the death effector domains in the prodomain of the zymogen (9Scaffidi C.

The outcome of receptor-mediated caspase-8 activation depends upon the cellular context; in some cell types (termed type I cells), caspase-8 can initiate apoptosis by directly cleaving and activating executioner caspases, although in other cell types (type II) it must engage the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by cleaving the Bcl-2 family member Bid to efficiently drive cell death (10Samraj A.K. Keil E. Ueffing N. Schulze-Osthoff K. Schmitz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29652-29659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This difference is due to variations in the effects of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, which block executioner caspase function unless derepressed by proteins released from the mitochondria (11Jost P.J. Grabow S. Gray D. McKenzie M.D. Nachbur U. Huang D.C. Bouillet P. Thomas H.E. Borner C. Silke J. Strasser A. Kaufmann T.

Nature. 2009; 459: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar).The role of cleavage in caspase-8 activation is complex. Early studies using drug-inducible dimerization indicated that although mutation of interdomain cleavage sites reduced enzymatic activity upon dimerization, it did not eliminate it, and that uncleavable mutants of caspase-8 could be productively activated in vitro (7Chang D.W. Xing Z. Capacio V.L. Peter M.E. Yang X. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4132-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Later work by ourselves and others relied upon kosmotropic salts to induce dimerization of caspase-8 in vitro. Insolubility of the prodomain confounds the production of full-length recombinant caspase-8, but recombinant proteins containing the large and small subunits can be induced to dimerize by the addition of 1 m sodium citrate. Production of such proteins with either prohibitive mutations at the interdomain cleavage sites or with thrombin cleavage sites at these positions revealed that noncleavable caspase-8 could be readily activated by kosmotropic salts (13Pop C. Fitzgerald P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4398-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Under these in vitro conditions, it was determined that interdomain cleavage served to stabilize the dimer but was not required for activation.However, these data are at odds with in vivo studies. Creation of a mouse expressing a caspase-8 mutant with a prohibitive mutation at the autocleavage site between the large and small subunits revealed that cells or tissues from this mouse were highly resistant to apoptosis induced by Fas ligation. These results indicate that noncleavable caspase-8 cannot support extrinsic apoptosis (14Kang T.B. Oh G.S. Scandella E. Bolinger B. Ludewig B. Kovalenko A. Wallach D. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 2522-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Recent studies in which the DISC was reconstituted in vitro using purified recombinant proteins also support this idea; in these studies noncleavable caspase-8 could not be productively activated by DISC formation (15Hughes M.A. Harper N. Butterworth M. Cain K. Cohen G.M. MacFarlane M. Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 265-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).The effect of caspase-8 cleavage alone has also been the subject of some controversy. Although the in vitro work carried out by ourselves and others has supported the idea that cleavage alone is not sufficient to activate caspase-8 (13Pop C. Fitzgerald P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4398-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), studies in cell lines have come to the opposite conclusion (16Sohn D. Schulze-Osthoff K. Jänicke R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5267-5273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 17Murphy B.M. Creagh E.M. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36916-36922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).To accurately define the effects of both dimerization and cleavage of caspase-8 in living cells, we sought a system in which each event could be independently controlled. The regulated homodimerization system presents an ideal and well characterized system to regulate dimerization (18Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 418-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 19Spencer D.M. Belshaw P.J. Chen L. Ho S.N. Randazzo F. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Curr.

Briefly, this system includes modified FKBP-12 protein domains, and a modified version of the cell-permeable drug FK1012, which binds tightly to these domains and induces their dimerization. This system has been used to study the activation of initiator caspases in the past (7Chang D.W. Xing Z. Capacio V.L. Peter M.E. Yang X.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). To study the effects of caspase cleavage, we adapted the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease for use in mammalian cells. The TEV protease has been used extensively in vitro for removal of affinity tags and works under pH and temperature ranges that would indicate compatibility with in vivo applications (23Kapust R.B.

Purif. 2000; 19: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). TEV protease also has the advantage of a large consensus cleavage site, so its expression would not be expected to cause off-target effects (25Phan J. Zdanov A. Evdokimov A.G. Tropea J.E. Peters 3rd, H.K. Kapust R.B. Li M. Wlodawer A. Waugh D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50564-50572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 26Kapust R.B. Tözsér J. Copeland T.D. Waugh D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Using these tools, we discovered that neither dimerization nor cleavage of caspase-8 zymogens, in the absence of the other process, is sufficient to activate the proteolytic activity of the enzyme under cellular conditions.DISCUSSIONThe findings presented in this study indicate that both dimerization and interdomain cleavage of caspase-8 are necessary for apoptosis induction under physiological conditions. Although autocleavage has previously been shown to stabilize dimeric caspase-8, it was thought that dimerization of caspase-8 zymogens was synonymous with activation, with cleavage optimizing proteolytic activity and stabilizing the enzyme (5Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A. Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol.

Here, we show that cleavage, although not sufficient to activate caspase-8, is nonetheless necessary. Additionally, previous reports have found that cleavage of caspase-8 alone can lead to its activation (16Sohn D. Schulze-Osthoff K. Jänicke R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5267-5273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 17Murphy B.M. Creagh E.M. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36916-36922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We find that cleavage in the absence of dimerization does not produce an active enzyme nor does it drive apoptosis.Many studies have shown that dimerization of caspase-8 zymogens can activate caspase-8 proteolytic activity and induce apoptosis. Apoptotic caspase-8 activation in cells leads to its interdomain autoproteolytic processing; however, the role and requirement of this cleavage event have been the subject of some debate. In vitro work using purified FKBP-caspase-8 driven to dimerize with the FKBP-binding drug AP20187 indicated that mutation of the interdomain autoprocessing sites of caspase-8 reduced but did not abrogate its activation following dimerizer addition; these same studies found that transfection of these constructs into HeLa cells followed a similar pattern, with elimination of the interdomain cleavage sites reducing, but not eliminating, apoptosis upon dimerizer addition (7Chang D.W. Xing Z. Capacio V.L. Peter M.E. Yang X. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4132-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Additional in vitro work has supported the idea that caspase-8 dimerization, in the absence of interdomain processing, can lead to its activation. Previously published work from ourselves and others used purified recombinant caspase-8 lacking a prodomain and induced this construct to dimerize by addition of kosmotropic salts (5Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A. Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 13Pop C. Fitzgerald P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4398-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These studies also found that dimerization in the absence of interdomain processing yielded reduced but still significant proteolytic activity, with interdomain processing serving to stabilize the active dimer.The mechanism proposed by these biochemical studies is not entirely supported by work performed in vivo. Most significantly, when caspase-8-deficient mice were reconstituted with a caspase-8 construct that cannot undergo interdomain processing, cells and tissues from the resulting mice were resistant to stimuli that induce apoptosis via caspase-8 (14Kang T.B. Oh G.S. Scandella E. Bolinger B. Ludewig B. Kovalenko A. Wallach D. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 2522-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In addition, very recent work has confirmed the apparent requirement for intact interdomain processing sites for induction of apoptosis by caspase-8, by reconstituting caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells with various noncleavable mutants of caspase-8 (15Hughes M.A. Harper N. Butterworth M. Cain K. Cohen G.M. MacFarlane M. Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 265-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).The findings presented here support the idea that interdomain cleavage of caspase-8 is required for efficient activation and induction of apoptosis under physiological conditions. We found that purified FKBP-Caspase-8 that could not undergo interdomain cleavage was indeed able to be activated by addition of kosmotropic salts, as reported previously. However, upon dimerization via the FKBP domain, which is predicted to more faithfully mimic physiological dimerization by activated receptors, elimination of interdomain processing sites rendered caspase-8 nonactivatable, most likely due to the inability of noncleavable caspase-8 to form a stable dimeric enzyme. We suggest that dimerization induced by buffer conditions, such as high kosmotropic salt levels, drives caspase zymogens into sustained dimeric conformations by acting on the entire dimer interface, although prodomain-driven dimerization merely brings the zymogens into proximity and requires cleavage and molecular rearrangement to “lock in” the dimeric conformation.Our findings conflict with those presented by others who used similar FKBP-caspase-8 constructs but found that noncleavable FKBP-caspase-8 activity could be induced by addition of dimerizer drug in vitro and that the same construct could drive apoptosis in cells, albeit to a lesser extent than the cleavable version. Because differences in protein purification conditions or concentrations of purified protein used in activity assays can differ, we sought to determine whether noncleavable caspase-8 could be productively activated by prodomain-driven dimerization in a more physiological context. We found that reconstitution of either caspase-8-deficient Jurkat or NB7 cell lines with noncleavable caspase-8 yielded cells insensitive to TRAIL or TNF treatment, respectively. These findings precisely mirror our in vitro activity results obtained using purified protein, confirming the requirement for interdomain processing to drive apoptosis in vivo. Given the manifestly nonphysiological nature of high kosmotropic salt conditions, and the finding that caspase-8-deficient cells reconstituted with noncleavable caspase-8 fail to undergo apoptosis in response to death ligand binding, we can also conclude that kosmotropic salt-mediated dimerization does not faithfully mimic physiological caspase-8 activation, which absolutely requires interdomain processing.Another persistent question concerns the effect of caspase-8 cleavage at its interdomain autoprocessing sites by other enzymes. Both caspase-6 and granzyme-B have been found to effectively cleave caspase-8 at these sites, and reports have held that this cleavage is sufficient to induce caspase-8 activity (16Sohn D. Schulze-Osthoff K. Jänicke R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5267-5273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 17Murphy B.M. Creagh E.M. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36916-36922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This question is not one of mere idle interest, because active caspase-8 is able to activate executioner caspases; if the converse were also true, significant feedback amplification of the apoptotic signal would be expected to result. However, this seemingly simple premise has been difficult to test in practice, because of the limited utility of inhibitors purportedly specific to single caspases (32McStay G.P. Salvesen G.S. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and the self-amplifying nature of the executioner caspases. Our earlier work in vitro demonstrated that interdomain processing of caspase-8 zymogen was not sufficient to induce its proteolytic activity (13Pop C. Fitzgerald P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4398-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar); however, the effect of such cleavage events in the cellular context warranted further study. We therefore adapted a viral protease, TEV protease, for use in mammalian cells. We found that codon optimization was required to achieve useful expression and activity levels in cells. As a proof of concept, we produced the executioner caspases, caspase-3 and caspase-7, with TEV protease cleavage sites, and as expected, we found that cleavage of these caspases with TEV protease was sufficient to activate their proteolytic activity in vitro and to drive apoptosis in cellulo. However, this was not the case with caspase-8; interdomain cleavage of this caspase by TEV protease induced neither activation in vitro nor apoptosis in cells. This finding differs from those of Sohn et al. (16Sohn D. Schulze-Osthoff K. Jänicke R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5267-5273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and Murphy et al. (17Murphy B.M. Creagh E.M. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36916-36922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the study by Murphy et al. (17Murphy B.M. Creagh E.M. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36916-36922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), caspase-8 was cleaved in lysates by addition of recombinant caspase-6 or granzyme-B, then purified by immunoprecipitation, and tested for activity; and it is possible that in this protocol immunoprecipitation itself induces proximity, and therefore activity, of cleaved caspase-8 zymogens. Sohn et al. (16Sohn D. Schulze-Osthoff K. Jänicke R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5267-5273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) found activation of caspase-8 following etoposide-induced DNA damage as measured by affinity tag binding and concluded that this activation was the result of cleavage in the absence of a dimerization signal. However, work from our laboratory found that etoposide treatment induces Fas expression and subsequent caspase-8 activation via the well defined death receptor pathway (30Tu S. McStay G.P. Boucher L.M. Mak T. Beere H.M. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).A major advantage of the TEV protease system is its stringent specificity. The ideal TEV protease cleavage site is 7 amino acids in length and does not occur naturally in the human proteome; off-target effects are therefore expected to be minimal, and indeed cells tolerate TEV protease expression with no perceivable ill effects. Co-expression of TEV-cleavable proteins with the TEV protease therefore allows analysis of the effects of specific proteolytic cleavage events and will be an exceptionally useful tool in dissecting proteolysis-mediated pathways in vivo. The caspase activation cascade provides an excellent example of this utility. Over 700 putative caspase substrates have been described previously (33Lüthi A.U. Martin S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), but discerning which of these cleavage events actually influences cell fate is challenging. Because executioner caspase activation leads to a terminal cell fate, apoptosis, there is not expected to be evolutionary pressure against the presence of caspase cleavage sites. This has led to numerous reports correlating the cleavage of a given substrate to a specific feature of apoptosis, but due to the massive morphological changes associated with apoptosis, mutation of a putative caspase cleavage site to show its relevance can be difficult within the context of the dying cell. Using optimized TEV protease, it will be possible to introduce TEV consensus sites into such substrates and induce their cleavage in otherwise healthy cells. Although this work serves as a proof of concept, the potential utility of this system goes well beyond the results presented here.The results discussed above indicate that neither dimerization nor cleavage alone, in the absence of the other, is sufficient to activate caspase-8 to drive apoptosis. We sought to prove this formally through the combination of FKBP-driven inducible dimerization and TEV-mediated inducible cleavage. We first purified TEV-cleavable FKBP-caspase-8 constructs, and as expected we found that neither dimerization nor cleavage alone induced proteolytic activity in these proteins. However, TEV cleavage followed by drug-induced dimerization did induce robust catalytic activity. We next moved this system into HeLa cells, using co-expression of our human-optimized TEV construct to induce cleavage, with results similar to those obtained in vitro; only when both cleavage and dimerization were induced did robust apoptosis result.As a final test of this model, we transfected caspase-8-deficient NB7 cells with constructs encoding wild-type or TEV-cleavable caspase-8, and we found that TEV cleavage in the absence of dimerization, or TNF treatment of cells expressing noncleavable caspase-8, failed to induce caspase-8 activity measured by b-VAD-fmk labeling. Only dimerization of cleavage-competent caspase-8 led to activation. Close examination of this result reveals a puzzling wrinkle, whereas only cleavable caspase-8 labels with b-VAD-fmk, both full-length and cleaved caspase-8 appear in the streptavidin capture (Fig. 6C). Although this indicates that noncleaved caspase-8 can acquire activity, cells in which the TEV-cleavable construct (which is resistant to autoprocessing) was present showed no such labeling. This finding could indicate that cleavage of one member of a dimer is sufficient to induce b-VAD labeling of both members; indeed, this idea agrees with recently published results (15Hughes M.A. Harper N. Butterworth M. Cain K. Cohen G.M. MacFarlane M. Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 265-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although other models are possible, the parsimonious explanation of the dual requirement for dimerization and cleavage is that dimerization activates caspase-8 but that the dimer formed at the DISC is transient and unstable. Only auto-proteolysis (which would be favored due to juxtaposition of caspase-8 in the DISC) and possibly cleavage of other DISC-associated proteins occur. This autoproteolysis stabilizes the caspase-8 dimer to allow sustained activity with cleavage and activation of downstream executioner caspases. This activation/stabilization model is essentially compatible with most published reports on caspase activation mechanisms.The requirement for interdomain processing for activation of the initiator caspase-9 differs markedly from that of caspase-8. A number of publications indicate that caspase-9 bearing prohibitive mutations at the interdomain processing sites between the large and small subunits can be robustly activated in vitro by addition of purified Apaf-1 and cytochrome c (34Malladi S. Challa-Malladi M. Fearnhead H.O. Bratton S.B. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1916-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 35Stennicke H.R. Deveraux Q.L. Humke E.W. Reed J.C. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J.

J. 2007; 405: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of noncleavable caspase-9 in cell lines is able to support robust activation of caspases following cytochrome c release, again indicating that interdomain processing of caspase-9 is dispensable for its activation (35Stennicke H.R. Deveraux Q.L. Humke E.W. Reed J.C. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8359-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The best evidence that requirement for interdomain cleavage during activation is fundamentally different between caspase-8 and caspase-9 comes from studies using “caspase-9/8,” a fusion protein composed of a caspase-9 prodomain fused to caspase-8 catalytic domains. Both caspase-9 and caspase-9/8 can be readily activated by in vitro apoptosome formation, confirming that both caspase-8 and caspase-9 share a requirement for dimerization of inactive zymogens during activation (4Pop C. Timmer J. Sperandio S. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 269-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, although noncleavable caspase-9 is still able to be robustly activated, caspase-9/8 containing prohibitive mutations at the interdomain cleavage sites of the caspase-8 catalytic domains is not activated by apoptosome formation in vitro. In light of the results presented here, this finding further confirms that unlike caspase-9, caspase-8 absolutely requires interdomain processing during activation.The data presented here show that cleavage of caspase-8 is required for induction of apoptosis and that noncleavable caspase-8 cannot be activated by physiological homodimerization, nor can it drive apoptosis induced by the extrinsic pathway. These findings are in agreement with those generated by introducing noncleavable caspase-8 into a caspase-8-deficient mouse; tissues and cells from that animal are resistant to extrinsic apoptosis (14Kang T.B. Oh G.S. Scandella E. Bolinger B. Ludewig B. Kovalenko A. Wallach D. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 2522-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, an additional and extremely provocative finding of that study was that introduction of noncleavable caspase-8 nonetheless rescued the severe developmental defects and embryonic lethality caused by caspase-8 deficiency. These results indicate that uncleaved caspase-8 plays a fundamental role in nonapoptotic pathways required for development. A requirement for caspase-8 during T-cell proliferation has also been described, and recent work has indicated that caspase-8-deficient T-cells proliferate normally but die at high rates via the recently described “programmed necrosis” pathway (37Ch'en I.L. Beisner D.R. Degterev A. Lynch C. Yuan J. Hoffmann A. Hedrick S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 17463-17468Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 38Su H. Bidère N. Zheng L. Cubre A. Sakai K. Dale J. Salmena L. Hakem R. Straus S. Lenardo M. Science. 2005; 307: 1465-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). This pathway is dependent on the receptor-interacting protein kinases RIPK1 and RIPK3. Intriguingly, both of these proteins contain caspase-8 cleavage sites (39Feng S. Yang Y. Mei Y. Ma L. Zhu D.E. Hoti N. Castanares M. Wu M. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 2056-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 40Rébé C. Cathelin S. Launay S. Filomenko R. Prévotat L. L'Ollivier C. Gyan E. Micheau O. Grant S. Dubart-Kupperschmitt A. Fontenay M. Solary E. Blood. 2007; 109: 1442-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and this has led to the hypothesis that limited autocleavage-independent activation of caspase-8 could be required to inactivate the receptor-interacting protein kinases following T-cell activation. This pathway could also play a role in development, explaining the developmental rescue observed upon re-introduction of noncleavable caspase-8. However, the biochemical mechanisms by which the cleavage-independent, nonapoptotic activity of caspase-8 is brought to bear remain elusive. Knockouts of the adaptor protein FADD or the caspase-like protein FLIP share the developmental phenotype of the caspase-8 knock-out, leading to the hypothesis that formation of caspase-8/FLIP heterodimers could be important for the nonapoptotic activity of caspase-8. However, biochemical analyses of these heterodimeric species indicate that they form more readily, are more active, and can drive apoptosis with higher efficiency than caspase-8 homodimers. IntroductionCaspases are a family of cysteine proteases that can be broadly divided by function into the inflammatory caspases and the apoptotic caspases (reviewed in Refs. 1Fuentes-Prior P. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 201-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 2Pop C. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21777-21781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Although the former group, which includes caspase-1, -4, and -5, is involved in the innate immune response through the cleavage-induced maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the majority of the mammalian caspases are involved in the initiation and execution of apoptosis.The apoptotic caspases, caspase-2, -3, and -6–10, can be further divided based on protein architecture and mode of activation. Caspase-2 and -8–10 are termed the “initiator” or “apical” caspases and are composed of a long N-terminal prodomain containing protein-protein interaction motifs and a C-terminal catalytic domain, often composed of an ∼20-kDa large subunit containing the active site cysteine and an ∼10-kDa small subunit (3Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). The initiator caspases are present in the cytosol of nonapoptotic cells as inactive monomers and are activated by recruitment to large protein complexes where they are induced to dimerize by protein-protein interactions with their prodomains. Once dimerized, initiator caspases undergo a series of autocleavage events at aspartic acid residues in their interdomain linker regions (4Pop C. Timmer J. Sperandio S. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 269-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 5Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A.

Cell. 2003; 11: 543-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Caspase-8 is first cleaved at one of two aspartic acid residues (Asp-374 or -384) between its large and small subunits and subsequently at one of three such residues (Asp-210, -216, or -223) between the large subunit and prodomain (Fig. 1A) (7Chang D.W. Xing Z. Capacio V.L. Peter M.E. Yang X. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4132-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The resulting fully active enzyme is made up of a dimer of catalytic domains, each composed of a large and a small subunit.The executioner caspases, caspase-3, -6, and -7, share the large and small subunit architecture of the initiator caspases but lack long prodomains. Their mechanism of activation is also distinct from that of the initiators. The executioner caspases are present in the cytosol of nonapoptotic cells as inactive dimers and are activated by cleavage of the linker region between the large and small subunits by activated initiator caspases. This cleavage event causes intramolecular rearrangements and produces a fully active caspase enzyme (8Riedl S.J. Shi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar).Caspase-8 is the initiator caspase responsible for initiation of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis in mammals. Caspase-8 is activated when the monomeric zymogen is recruited to the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) 4The abbreviations used are: DISCdeath-inducing signaling complexTNFtumor necrosis factorFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidPipes1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidTEVtobacco etch virusb-biotin-fmkfluoromethyl ketoneGFPgreen fluorescent proteinWTwild typeFKBPFK506-binding proteinafc7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin. formed at the cytoplasmic tail of activated receptors of the TNF family through homotypic interactions with the death effector domains in the prodomain of the zymogen (9Scaffidi C.

The outcome of receptor-mediated caspase-8 activation depends upon the cellular context; in some cell types (termed type I cells), caspase-8 can initiate apoptosis by directly cleaving and activating executioner caspases, although in other cell types (type II) it must engage the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by cleaving the Bcl-2 family member Bid to efficiently drive cell death (10Samraj A.K. Keil E. Ueffing N. Schulze-Osthoff K. Schmitz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29652-29659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This difference is due to variations in the effects of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, which block executioner caspase function unless derepressed by proteins released from the mitochondria (11Jost P.J. Grabow S. Gray D. McKenzie M.D. Nachbur U. Huang D.C. Bouillet P. Thomas H.E. Borner C. Silke J. Strasser A. Kaufmann T.

Nature. 2009; 459: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar).The role of cleavage in caspase-8 activation is complex. Early studies using drug-inducible dimerization indicated that although mutation of interdomain cleavage sites reduced enzymatic activity upon dimerization, it did not eliminate it, and that uncleavable mutants of caspase-8 could be productively activated in vitro (7Chang D.W. Xing Z. Capacio V.L. Peter M.E. Yang X. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4132-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Later work by ourselves and others relied upon kosmotropic salts to induce dimerization of caspase-8 in vitro. Insolubility of the prodomain confounds the production of full-length recombinant caspase-8, but recombinant proteins containing the large and small subunits can be induced to dimerize by the addition of 1 m sodium citrate. Production of such proteins with either prohibitive mutations at the interdomain cleavage sites or with thrombin cleavage sites at these positions revealed that noncleavable caspase-8 could be readily activated by kosmotropic salts (13Pop C. Fitzgerald P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4398-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Under these in vitro conditions, it was determined that interdomain cleavage served to stabilize the dimer but was not required for activation.However, these data are at odds with in vivo studies. Creation of a mouse expressing a caspase-8 mutant with a prohibitive mutation at the autocleavage site between the large and small subunits revealed that cells or tissues from this mouse were highly resistant to apoptosis induced by Fas ligation. These results indicate that noncleavable caspase-8 cannot support extrinsic apoptosis (14Kang T.B. Oh G.S. Scandella E. Bolinger B. Ludewig B. Kovalenko A. Wallach D. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 2522-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Recent studies in which the DISC was reconstituted in vitro using purified recombinant proteins also support this idea; in these studies noncleavable caspase-8 could not be productively activated by DISC formation (15Hughes M.A. Harper N. Butterworth M. Cain K. Cohen G.M. MacFarlane M. Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 265-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).The effect of caspase-8 cleavage alone has also been the subject of some controversy. Although the in vitro work carried out by ourselves and others has supported the idea that cleavage alone is not sufficient to activate caspase-8 (13Pop C. Fitzgerald P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4398-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), studies in cell lines have come to the opposite conclusion (16Sohn D. Schulze-Osthoff K. Jänicke R.U. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 36916-36922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).To accurately define the effects of both dimerization and cleavage of caspase-8 in living cells, we sought a system in which each event could be independently controlled. The regulated homodimerization system presents an ideal and well characterized system to regulate dimerization (18Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Trends Biochem.

Briefly, this system includes modified FKBP-12 protein domains, and a modified version of the cell-permeable drug FK1012, which binds tightly to these domains and induces their dimerization. This system has been used to study the activation of initiator caspases in the past (7Chang D.W. Xing Z. Capacio V.L. Peter M.E. Yang X.

To study the effects of caspase cleavage, we adapted the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease for use in mammalian cells. The TEV protease has been used extensively in vitro for removal of affinity tags and works under pH and temperature ranges that would indicate compatibility with in vivo applications (23Kapust R.B.

Purif. 2000; 19: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). TEV protease also has the advantage of a large consensus cleavage site, so its expression would not be expected to cause off-target effects (25Phan J. Zdanov A. Evdokimov A.G. Tropea J.E.

Using these tools, we discovered that neither dimerization nor cleavage of caspase-8 zymogens, in the absence of the other process, is sufficient to activate the proteolytic activity of the enzyme under cellular conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2014793428,"Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by late detection and fast progression, and it is believed that epigenetic disruption may be the cause of its molecular and clinicopathological heterogeneity. A better understanding of the global deregulation of methylation states and how they correlate with disease progression will aid in the design of strategies for earlier detection and better therapeutic decisions. Methods and Findings We characterized the changes in promoter methylation in a series of 30 HCC tumors and their respective surrounding tissue and identified methylation signatures associated with major risk factors and clinical correlates. A wide panel of cancer-related gene promoters was analyzed using Illumina bead array technology, and CpG sites were then selected according to their ability to classify clinicopathological parameters. An independent series of HCC tumors and matched surrounding tissue was used for validation of the signatures. We were able to develop and validate a signature of methylation in HCC. This signature distinguished HCC from surrounding tissue and from other tumor types, and was independent of risk factors. However, aberrant methylation of an independent subset of promoters was associated with tumor progression and etiological risk factors (HBV or HCV infection and alcohol consumption). Interestingly, distinct methylation of an independent panel of gene promoters was strongly correlated with survival after cancer therapy. Conclusion Our study shows that HCC tumors exhibit specific DNA methylation signatures associated with major risk factors and tumor progression stage, with potential clinical applications in diagnosis and prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2103968122,"Background Eye movement strategies employed by humans to identify conspecifics are not universal. Westerners predominantly fixate the eyes during face recognition, whereas Easterners more the nose region, yet recognition accuracy is comparable. However, natural fixations do not unequivocally represent information extraction. So the question of whether humans universally use identical facial information to recognize faces remains unresolved. Methodology/Principal Findings We monitored eye movements during face recognition of Western Caucasian (WC) and East Asian (EA) observers with a novel technique in face recognition that parametrically restricts information outside central vision. We used ‘Spotlights’ with Gaussian apertures of 2°, 5° or 8° dynamically centered on observers' fixations. Strikingly, in constrained Spotlight conditions (2° and 5°) observers of both cultures actively fixated the same facial information: the eyes and mouth. When information from both eyes and mouth was simultaneously available when fixating the nose (8°), as expected EA observers shifted their fixations towards this region. Conclusions/Significance Social experience and cultural factors shape the strategies used to extract information from faces, but these results suggest that external forces do not modulate information use. Human beings rely on identical facial information to recognize conspecifics, a universal law that might be dictated by the evolutionary constraints of nature and not nurture."
https://openalex.org/W2029615274,"Targeting bacterial virulence factors is now gaining interest as an alternative strategy to develop new types of anti-infective agents. It has been shown that thymol, when used at low concentrations, can inhibit the TSST-1 secretion in Staphylococcus aureus. However, there are no data on the effect of thymol on the production of other exotoxins (e.g., alpha-hemolysin and enterotoxins) by S. aureus.Secretion of alpha-hemolysin, SEA and SEB in both methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates cultured with graded subinhibitory concentrations of thymol was detected by immunoblot analysis. Hemolysin and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) release assays were performed to elucidate the biological relevance of changes in alpha-hemolysin, SEA and SEB secretion induced by thymol. In addition, the influence of thymol on the transcription of hla, sea, and seb (the genes encoding alpha-hemolysin, SEA and SEB, respectively) was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. Thymol inhibited transcription of hla, sea and seb in S. aureus, resulting in a reduction of alpha-hemolysin, SEA and SEB secretion and, thus, a reduction in hemolytic and TNF-inducing activities.Subinhibitory concentrations of thymol decreased the production of alpha-hemolysin, SEA and SEB in both MSSA and MRSA in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that thymol may be useful for the treatment of S. aureus infections when used in combination with beta-lactams and glycopeptide antibiotics, which induce expression of alpha-hemolysin and enterotoxins at subinhibitory concentrations. Furthermore, the structure of thymol may potentially be used as a basic structure for development of drugs aimed against these bacterial virulence factors."
https://openalex.org/W2079907988,"The persistence of tropical coral reefs is threatened by rapidly increasing climate warming, causing a functional breakdown of the obligate symbiosis between corals and their algal photosymbionts (Symbiodinium) through a process known as coral bleaching. Yet the potential of the coral-algal symbiosis to genetically adapt in an evolutionary sense to warming oceans is unknown. Using a quantitative genetics approach, we estimated the proportion of the variance in thermal tolerance traits that has a genetic basis (i.e. heritability) as a proxy for their adaptive potential in the widespread Indo-Pacific reef-building coral Acropora millepora. We chose two physiologically different populations that associate respectively with one thermo-tolerant (Symbiodinium clade D) and one less tolerant symbiont type (Symbiodinium C2). In both symbiont types, pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed significant heritabilities for traits related to both photosynthesis and photoprotective pigment profile. However, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays showed a lack of heritability in both coral host populations for their own expression of fundamental stress genes. Coral colony growth, contributed to by both symbiotic partners, displayed heritability. High heritabilities for functional key traits of algal symbionts, along with their short clonal generation time and high population sizes allow for their rapid thermal adaptation. However, the low overall heritability of coral host traits, along with the corals' long generation time, raise concern about the timely adaptation of the coral-algal symbiosis in the face of continued rapid climate warming."
https://openalex.org/W2027566272,"Approximately 50% of smokers die prematurely from tobacco-related diseases. In July 2006, the Massachusetts health care reform law mandated tobacco cessation coverage for the Massachusetts Medicaid population. The new benefit included behavioral counseling and all medications approved for tobacco cessation treatment by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Between July 1, 2006 and December 31, 2008, a total of 70,140 unique Massachusetts Medicaid subscribers used the newly available benefit, which is approximately 37% of all Massachusetts Medicaid smokers. Given the high utilization rate, the objective of this study is to determine if smoking prevalence decreased significantly after the initiation of tobacco cessation coverage.Smoking prevalence was evaluated pre- to post-benefit using 1999 through 2008 data from the Massachusetts Behavioral Risk Factor Survey (BRFSS). The crude smoking rate decreased from 38.3% (95% C.I. 33.6%-42.9%) in the pre-benefit period compared to 28.3% (95% C.I.: 24.0%-32.7%) in the post-benefit period, representing a decline of 26 percent. A demographically adjusted smoking rate showed a similar decrease in the post-benefit period. Trend analyses reflected prevalence decreases that accrued over time. Specifically, a joinpoint analysis of smoking prevalence among Massachusetts Medicaid benefit-eligible members (age 18-64) from 1999 through 2008 found a decreasing trend that was coincident with the implementation of the benefit. Finally, a logistic regression that controlled for demographic factors also showed that the trend in smoking decreased significantly from July 1, 2006 to December 31, 2008.These findings suggest that a tobacco cessation benefit that includes coverage for medications and behavioral treatments, has few barriers to access, and involves broad promotion can significantly reduce smoking prevalence."
https://openalex.org/W1995962617,"Bone metastases are highly frequent complications of breast cancers. Current bone metastasis treatments using powerful anti-resorptive agents are only palliative indicating that factors independent of bone resorption control bone metastasis progression. Autotaxin (ATX/NPP2) is a secreted protein with both oncogenic and pro-metastatic properties. Through its lysosphospholipase D (lysoPLD) activity, ATX controls the level of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in the blood. Platelet-derived LPA promotes the progression of osteolytic bone metastases of breast cancer cells. We asked whether ATX was involved in the bone metastasis process. We characterized the role of ATX in osteolytic bone metastasis formation by using genetically modified breast cancer cells exploited on different osteolytic bone metastasis mouse models.Intravenous injection of human breast cancer MDA-B02 cells with forced expression of ATX (MDA-B02/ATX) to immunodeficiency BALB/C nude mice enhanced osteolytic bone metastasis formation, as judged by increased bone loss, tumor burden, and a higher number of active osteoclasts at the metastatic site. Mouse breast cancer 4T1 cells induced the formation of osteolytic bone metastases after intracardiac injection in immunocompetent BALB/C mice. These cells expressed active ATX and silencing ATX expression inhibited the extent of osteolytic bone lesions and decreased the number of active osteoclasts at the bone metastatic site. In vitro, osteoclast differentiation was enhanced in presence of MDA-B02/ATX cell conditioned media or recombinant autotaxin that was blocked by the autotaxin inhibitor vpc8a202. In vitro, addition of LPA to active charcoal-treated serum restored the capacity of the serum to support RANK-L/MCSF-induced osteoclastogenesis.Expression of autotaxin by cancer cells controls osteolytic bone metastasis formation. This work demonstrates a new role for LPA as a factor that stimulates directly cancer growth and metastasis, and osteoclast differentiation. Therefore, targeting the autotaxin/LPA track emerges as a potential new therapeutic approach to improve the outcome of patients with bone metastases."

https://openalex.org/W2046374433,"beta- and gamma-nonmuscle actins differ by 4 amino acids at or near the N terminus and distant from polymerization interfaces. beta-Actin contains an Asp(1)-Asp(2)-Asp(3) and Val(10) whereas gamma-actin has a Glu(1)-Glu(2)-Glu(3) and Ile(10). Despite these small changes, conserved across mammals, fish, and birds, their differential localization in the same cell suggests they may play different roles reflecting differences in their biochemical properties. To test this hypothesis, we established a baculovirus-driven expression system for producing these actins in isoform-pure populations although contaminated with 20-25% insect actin. Surprisingly, Ca-gamma-actin exhibits a slower monomeric nucleotide exchange rate, a much longer nucleation phase, and a somewhat slower elongation rate than beta-actin. In the Mg-form, this difference between the two is much smaller. Ca-gamma-actin depolymerizes half as fast as does beta-actin. Mixing experiments with Ca-actins reveal the two will readily co-polymerize. In the Ca-form, phosphate release from polymerizing beta-actin occurs much more rapidly and extensively than polymerization, whereas phosphate release lags behind polymerization with gamma-actin. Phosphate release during treadmilling is twice as fast with beta- as with gamma-actin. With Mg-actin in the initial stages, phosphate release for both actins correlates much more closely with polymerization. Calcium bound in the high affinity binding site of gamma-actin may cause a selective energy barrier relative to beta-actin that retards the equilibration between G- and F-monomer conformations resulting in a slower polymerizing actin with greater filament stability. This difference may be particularly important in sites such as the gamma-actin-rich cochlear hair cell stereocilium where local mm calcium concentrations may exist."
https://openalex.org/W2049467922,"Actively granting food to a companion is called pro-social behavior and is considered to be part of altruism. Recent findings show that some non-human primates behave pro-socially. However, pro-social behavior is not expected in despotic species, since the steep dominance hierarchy will hamper pro-sociality. We show that some despotic long-tailed macaques do grant others access to food. Moreover, their dominance hierarchy determines pro-social behavior in an unexpected way: high-ranking individuals grant, while low-ranking individuals withhold their partner access to food. Surprisingly, pro-social behavior is not used by subordinates to obtain benefits from dominants, but by dominants to emphasize their dominance position. Hence, Machiavellian macaques rule not through ""fear above love"", but through ""be feared when needed and loved when possible""."

Here we demonstrated that the expression of TPPP/p25 in HeLa cells, in doxycycline-inducible CHO10 cells, and in the oligodendrocyte CG-4 cells promoted the acetylation of alpha-tubulin at residue Lys-40, whereas its down-regulation by specific small interfering RNA in CG-4 cells or by the withdrawal of doxycycline from CHO10 cells decreased the acetylation level of alpha-tubulin. Our results indicate that TPPP/p25 binds to HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6), an enzyme responsible for tubulin deacetylation. Moreover, we demonstrated that the direct interaction of these two proteins resulted in the inhibition of the deacetylase activity of HDAC6. The measurement of HDAC6 activity showed that TPPP/p25 is able to induce almost complete (90%) inhibition at 3 microM concentration. In addition, treatment of the cells with nocodazole, vinblastine, or cold exposure revealed that microtubule acetylation induced by trichostatin A, a well known HDAC6 inhibitor, does not cause microtubule stabilization. In contrast, the microtubule bundling activity of TPPP/p25 was able to protect the microtubules from depolymerization. Finally, we demonstrated that, similarly to other HDAC6 inhibitors, TPPP/p25 influences the microtubule dynamics by decreasing the growth velocity of the microtubule plus ends and also affects cell motility as demonstrated by time lapse video experiments. Thus, we suggest that TPPP/p25 is a multiple effector of the microtubule organization."
https://openalex.org/W2172009373,"The flat-headed cat (Prionailurus planiceps) is one of the world's least known, highly threatened felids with a distribution restricted to tropical lowland rainforests in Peninsular Thailand/Malaysia, Borneo and Sumatra. Throughout its geographic range large-scale anthropogenic transformation processes, including the pollution of fresh-water river systems and landscape fragmentation, raise concerns regarding its conservation status. Despite an increasing number of camera-trapping field surveys for carnivores in South-East Asia during the past two decades, few of these studies recorded the flat-headed cat.In this study, we designed a predictive species distribution model using the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm to reassess the potential current distribution and conservation status of the flat-headed cat. Eighty-eight independent species occurrence records were gathered from field surveys, literature records, and museum collections. These current and historical records were analysed in relation to bioclimatic variables (WorldClim), altitude (SRTM) and minimum distance to larger water resources (Digital Chart of the World). Distance to water was identified as the key predictor for the occurrence of flat-headed cats (>50% explanation). In addition, we used different land cover maps (GLC2000, GlobCover and SarVision LLC for Borneo), information on protected areas and regional human population density data to extract suitable habitats from the potential distribution predicted by the MaxEnt model. Between 54% and 68% of suitable habitat has already been converted to unsuitable land cover types (e.g. croplands, plantations), and only between 10% and 20% of suitable land cover is categorised as fully protected according to the IUCN criteria. The remaining habitats are highly fragmented and only a few larger forest patches remain.Based on our findings, we recommend that future conservation efforts for the flat-headed cat should focus on the identified remaining key localities and be implemented through a continuous dialogue between local stakeholders, conservationists and scientists to ensure its long-term survival. The flat-headed cat can serve as a flagship species for the protection of several other endangered species associated with the threatened tropical lowland forests and surface fresh-water sources in this region."
https://openalex.org/W2020976619,"A large number of evidences suggest that group-I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1a, 1b, 1c, 5a, 5b) can modulate NMDA receptor activity. Interestingly, a physical link exists between these receptors through a Homer-Shank multi-protein scaffold that can be disrupted by the immediate early gene, Homer1a. Whether such a versatile link supports functional crosstalk between the receptors is unknown.Here we used biochemical, electrophysiological and molecular biological approaches in cultured mouse cerebellar neurons to investigate this issue. We found that Homer1a or dominant negative Shank3 mutants that disrupt the physical link between the receptors allow inhibition of NMDA current by group-I mGluR agonist. This effect is antagonized by pertussis toxin, but not thapsigargin, suggesting the involvement of a G protein, but not intracellular calcium stores. Also, this effect is voltage-sensitive, being present at negative, but not positive membrane potentials. In the presence of DHPG, an apparent NMDA ""tail current"" was evoked by large pulse depolarization, only in neurons transfected with Homer1a. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed interaction between G-protein betagamma subunits and NMDA receptor in the presence of Homer1a and group-I mGluR agonist.Altogether these results suggest a direct inhibition of NMDA receptor-channel by Gbetagamma subunits, following disruption of the Homer-Shank3 complex by the immediate early gene Homer1a. This study provides a new molecular mechanism by which group-I mGluRs could dynamically regulate NMDA receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W2010466342,"Previous studies have shown that small interfering RNA knockdown and pharmacological inhibition of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) stimulate autophagy. We have investigated autophagy in chicken DT40 cell lines containing targeted deletions of all three IP3R isoforms (triple knock-out (TKO) cells). Using gel shifts of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 as a marker of autophagy, we find that TKO cells have enhanced basal autophagic flux even under nutrient-replete conditions. Stable DT40 cell lines derived from TKO cells containing the functionally inactive D2550A IP3R mutant did not suppress autophagy in the same manner as wild-type receptors. This suggests that the channel function of the receptor is important in its regulatory role in autophagy. There were no marked differences in the phosphorylation state of AMP-activated protein kinase, Akt, or mammalian target of rapamycin between wild-type and TKO cells. The amount of immunoprecipitated complexes of Bcl-2-Beclin-1 and Beclin-1-Vps34 were also not different between the two cell lines. The major difference noted was a substantially decreased mTORC1 kinase activity in TKO cells based on decreased phosphorylation of S6 kinase and 4E-BP1. The discharge of intracellular stores with thapsigargin stimulated mTORC1 activity (measured as S6 kinase phosphorylation) to a greater extent in wild-type than in TKO cells. We suggest that basal autophagic flux may be negatively regulated by IP3R-dependent Ca2+ signals acting to maintain an elevated mTORC1 activity in wild-type cells and that Ca2+ regulation of this enzyme is defective in TKO cells. The protective effect of a higher autophagic flux in cells lacking IP3Rs may play a role in the delayed apoptotic response observed in these cells.

Finally, with certain apoptotic stimuli (e.g. staurosporine), IP3Rs support apoptosis independently of the channel function of the receptor via a mechanism that may be linked to a direct role of IP3Rs in activating Ca2+ entry mechanisms across the plasma membrane (12Khan M.T.

Macroautophagy is a proteolytic process in which cytoplasmic constituents (including organelles) are sequestered within double-membraned vesicles (autophagosomes) that ultimately fuse with lysosomes leading to the degradation of their contents (13Eskelinen E.L. Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2008; 266: 207-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A major physiological regulator of this process is nutrient supply, although the process is also regulated by various hormones and can be dysregulated under pathological conditions (14Mizushima N. Klionsky D.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2007; 27: 19-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The complicated steps involved in autophagosome formation and lysosome fusion involve multiple proteins and regulation by many different inputs, including the activities of the mTOR pathway and class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. There have been several reports suggesting that Ca2+ regulates this pathway. Hoyer-Hansen et al. (15Høyer-Hansen M. Bastholm L. Szyniarowski P. Campanella M. Szabadkai G. Farkas T. Bianchi K.

Manipulations designed to change the levels of IP3 in cells (e.g. addition of myo-inositol or Li+) alter the rate of starvation-induced autophagy (17Criollo A. Maiuri M.C. Tasdemir E. Vitale I.

A specific role for IP3Rs in the autophagic process was suggested by the finding that small interfering RNA knockdown or pharmacological blockade of the IP3R with xestospongin B led to an enhancement of autophagy (17Criollo A.

Kosta A. Luciani M.F. Golstein P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 691-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The specific autophagic signaling pathway(s) modulated by IP3Rs remains to be identified. DT40 chicken B-cell lines containing targeted deletion of all three IP3R isoforms (TKO) show a markedly delayed cell death response to various apoptotic stimuli (6Li C. Wang X. Vais H. Thompson C.B.

We considered the possibility that adaptive changes in autophagy may have occurred in these cells thereby providing a useful experimental system to investigate the role of IP3Rs in autophagy. In this study, we show that TKO cells have a markedly enhanced rate of autophagy compared with wild-type cells, even under nutrient-replete conditions. The suppression of autophagy required the Ca2+ channel function of the IP3R and was not observed in cell lines transfected with the pore-inactivating D2550A mutant. Several key factors that regulate autophagy were compared in wild-type and TKO cell lines and were not found to be significantly different. These included the activity of AMP and Akt kinase. The differences in basal autophagy could also not be accounted for by altered levels of Beclin-1-Vps34 complexes. Instead, our experiments suggest that altered activity of the mTORC1 complex may be one potential mechanism by which IP3R-mediated Ca2+ fluxes could regulate the autophagic pathway.

Kurosaki (Kansai Medical University, Moriguchi, Japan). Stable DT40 cells expressing the rat type I IP3R were a gift from Dr. Kevin Foskett (University of Pennsylvania). DT40 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% chicken serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. The stable cell line containing the inactivating D2550A pore mutation was prepared as described previously (12Khan M.T. Bhanumathy C.D. Schug Z.T. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32983-32990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). DT40 cells were seeded at a density of 104 cells/ml and were used for experiments after 24 h. There were no significant differences in the growth rate of the individual cell lines (data not shown). The DT40 cells were treated with staurosporine or rapamycin and then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The cells were washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in a medium containing 1% Triton X-100 and 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm NaF, 5 nm okadaic acid, and a 1× dilution of a complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. Protein samples (25 μg) were run on 15% polyacrylamide gels and transferred on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunoblotting was done using the LC3B antibody. Only the lower band of the LC3 doublet (LC3-II) was quantitated because variable immunodetection and efficiency of transfer of the upper band (LC3-I) has been observed (23Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy of DT40 cells was carried out as described by Csordas et al. (24Csordás G. Renken C. Várnai P. Walter L. Weaver D. Buttle K.F. Balla T. Mannella C.A. Hajnóczky G. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Autophagy was measured by immunoblotting for the microtubule-associated light chain 3 (LC3) protein. The covalent modification of the cytosolic LC3-I form with phosphatidylethanolamine generates the LC3-II form, which migrates more rapidly on SDS-PAGE (25Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Oshitani-Okamoto S. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2805-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). The specific association of LC3-II with autophagosomes has led to this protein being widely used as a marker of autophagy (23Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows a comparison of LC3-II levels detected by immunoblotting in lysates from wild-type and TKO DT40 cells grown under nutrient-replete conditions. The data show that basal steady-state levels of LC3-II are low in wild-type cells but are ∼4-fold elevated in the TKO cells (Fig. 1B). The induction of apoptosis with staurosporine (STS) over a 6-h period enhanced the levels of LC3-II in wild-type cells and decreased the elevated levels of LC3-II in TKO cells. To determine whether the Ca2+ channel function of IP3Rs was important in mediating its inhibitory effects on autophagy, we utilized a stable DT40 cell line expressing the “pore-dead” D2550A mutant of the rat type I IP3R (26Boehning D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The expression level of type I IP3R in the mutant has previously been shown to be comparable with wild-type cells (12Khan M.T. Bhanumathy C.D. Schug Z.T. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32983-32990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The pore-dead cell line also showed elevated levels of LC3-II that were decreased by STS treatment as observed with the TKO cells (Fig. 1, A and B). The wild-type DT40 cells used as a control contain all three chicken IP3R isoforms. Levels of LC3-II in pore-dead cells were also elevated when compared with a stable DT40 cell line expressing the wild-type rat type I IP3R (Fig. 1C). We conclude that the channel function of the IP3R is required for suppressing autophagy. It has been pointed out that measurements of the steady-state levels of LC3-II may not reflect autophagic flux because the levels are also determined by the degradation of LC3-II upon fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes (27Tanida I.

Autophagosome/lysosome fusion can be prevented by bafilomycin (29Yamamoto A. Tagawa Y. Yoshimori T. Moriyama Y. Masaki R. Tashiro Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1998; 23: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). A 6-h incubation with 10 nm bafilomycin caused a large enhancement in LC3-II levels such that no differences between WT and TKO cells could be distinguished, although the inhibitory effect of STS on LC3-II levels in the TKO cells was still observed (Fig. 1B). Shorter periods of treatment with bafilomycin, which produced submaximal elevations of LC3-II (e.g. after 1 h), still revealed differences between wild-type and TKO cells (Fig. 1D). The basic findings using LC3 immunoblotting were confirmed by analysis of electron microscope images of DT40 cells that showed an enhanced number of debris-containing vacuoles in TKO cells when compared with either wild-type or TKO cells stably expressing the rat type I IP3R (supplemental Fig. S1). These data in DT40 cells are in agreement with previous findings in other cell types that knockdown or inhibition of IP3Rs enhances autophagic flux (17Criollo A. Maiuri M.C. Tasdemir E. Vitale I. Fiebig A.A. Andrews D. Molgó J. Díaz J. Lavandero S. Harper F. Pierron G. di Stefano D. Rizzuto R. Szabadkai G. Kroemer G. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1029-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 depicts the canonical pathway of autophagy together with known sites that could potentially be regulated by Ca2+ based on information in the literature. Because IP3Rs have an established role in supplying Ca2+ to the mitochondria, which is known to stimulate mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, it is possible that IP3R-deficient DT40 cells might have an increased AMP/ATP ratio. This, in turn, could enhance the activity of AMPK that would stimulate autophagy through the intermediary steps shown in Fig. 2. Calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase-β is an upstream activator of AMPK and has also been proposed to be a site where cytosolic Ca2+ elevations could stimulate autophagy (15Høyer-Hansen M. Bastholm L. Szyniarowski P. Campanella M. Szabadkai G. Farkas T. Bianchi K. Fehrenbacher N. Elling F. Rizzuto R. Mathiasen I.S. Jäättelä M. Mol.

We therefore compared the activation state of AMPK in wild-type, TKO, and pore-dead DT40 cell lines by measuring phosphorylation of the protein at Thr-172 using a phospho-specific Ab. This rabbit polyclonal Ab recognized a doublet of bands in the chicken cells (Fig. 3) of which only the lower band was recognized by the pan-α-subunit AMPK Ab at the appropriate molecular mass of ∼63 kDa. This AMPK band was not significantly different between wild-type, TKO, and pore-dead cells. STS did not affect the phosphorylation state of the AMPK band but substantially decreased the phosphorylation of the upper unknown band in all three cell lines.FIGURE 3Autophagy is independent of the phosphorylation state of AMPK, Akt, or mTOR. WT, IP3R TKO, and the D2550A pore-inactive (pore-dead) DT40 cells lines were incubated in nutrient-replete medium with serum in the presence or absence of staurosporine (1 μm) for 6 h. After treatment, the cells were lysed in a buffer containing protein phosphatase inhibitors and processed for immunoblotting with the indicated phospho-specific Abs as described under “Materials and Methods.” The data shown is representative of three experiments. * indicates an unknown band.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Activated Akt kinase inhibits autophagy (Fig. 2) (30Degtyarev M.

Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 101-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Analysis of the phosphorylation state of Akt kinase using phospho-specific Ser-473 Ab indicates a modest increase in activation of Akt in TKO and pore-dead cells. However, these changes are in the opposite direction to account for the stimulated autophagy in these cell lines. STS decreased Ser-437 phosphorylation in TKO and pore-dead cell lines but not in wild-type cells. These changes also do not correlate with the different effects of STS on autophagy in these cell lines. The effects of Akt and AMPK on autophagy are mediated through a pathway that involves TSC and Rheb proteins that regulate the activity of the mTORC1 complex (Fig. 2). High levels of mTOR kinase suppress autophagy by mechanisms that have not been fully characterized but include the phosphorylation of Atg1/Ulk kinases that are involved in the induction of autophagosomes (31Pattingre S. Espert L. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Codogno P. Biochimie. 2008; 90: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). We examined the following two phosphorylation sites on mTOR: Ser-2448 (a site for phosphorylation by several kinases, including Akt (32Sekuliæ A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3504-3513PubMed Google Scholar)) and Ser-2481 (an autophosphorylation site (33Peterson R.T. Beal P.A. Comb M.J. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7416-7423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar)). The basal phosphorylation state of neither site was different in the three different DT40 cell lines (Fig. 3). However, mutation of serines 2448 or 2481 does not alter mTOR kinase activity (32Sekuliæ A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3504-3513PubMed Google Scholar), which is conventionally measured by monitoring the phosphorylation of its substrates. One such substrate is p70 S6 kinase, which is specifically phosphorylated by mTOR on Thr-389 (34Kim D.H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2354) Google Scholar). Fig. 4, A and B, shows that there are substantially lower levels of phosphorylated S6 kinase in the TKO and pore-dead cells. We confirmed this finding by examining another mTOR substrate 4E-BP1 using an Ab directed at Ser-65 (35Gingras A.C. Gygi S.P. Raught B. Polakiewicz R.D. Abraham R.T. Hoekstra M.F. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1422-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). As with S6 kinase, a lower phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was observed in TKO and pore-dead cells (Fig. 4A). The phosphorylation state of S6 kinase could be restored by stable transfection of the rat type I IP3R into TKO cells and remained elevated in a DT40 cell line containing only the endogenous chicken type I isoform (DKO-1) (Fig. 4C). We suggest that a lower mTOR kinase activity in the IP3R-deficient cell lines could account for their higher basal autophagy. We examined the effects of rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR (36Corradetti M.N. Guan K.L. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6347-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), on the levels of LC3-II in wild-type and TKO cells (Fig. 5). In both cell lines, 100 nm rapamycin completely inhibited mTOR activity within 2 h as judged by inhibition of phosphorylation of Thr-389 of S6 kinase (Fig. 5A). Rapamycin produced a smaller and slower decrease in Ser-2448 phosphorylation of mTOR itself, consistent with this site being a relatively insensitive indicator of mTOR kinase activity. Rapamycin elevated the levels of LC3-II in wild-type cells with a peak increase at 4 h, which averaged almost 80% of the elevated levels observed in untreated TKO cells (Fig. 5B). Rapamycin addition to TKO cells caused only a small further increase in LC3-II levels. The results with rapamycin are consistent with the hypothesis that differences in the activity of the mTOR kinase pathway are an important determinant in setting the different levels of basal autopha"

Like other family members, TGF-β1 is synthesized as a large precursor molecule consisting of an N-terminal prodomain (latency-associated peptide (LAP)) and a C-terminal mature domain. Within this precursor, LAP acts as a multifunctional peptide capable of regulating the crucial roles TGF-β1 plays throughout development and in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis in adult life (3Gordon K.J.

During the secretory process, LAP also interacts covalently with latent TGF-β-binding proteins (LTBPs) to form the large latent complex (LLC), and it is in this form that TGF-β1 is secreted from the cell (7Miyazono K.

In the absence of LTBPs, the reactive cysteine (Cys33) within LAP forms an incorrectly paired disulfide bond with a free cysteine in mature TGF-β1, ensuring the SLC is secreted in an inactive form (10Brunner A.M.

TGF-β1 signaling is dependant upon liberation of the mature ligand from the LLC, a process mediated by activators, such as thrombospondin-1 and integrins, that bind to specific residues in LAP (54LSKL and 244RGD, respectively) (4Young G.D.

These mutations lead to up-regulation of TGF-β1 signaling via increased ligand activation or secretion of the mutant protein (35Janssens K. ten Dijke P. Ralston S.H. Bergmann C. Van Hul W. J. Biol.

Interestingly, most of the identified CED mutations are in the vicinity of the cysteine residues (Cys223 and Cys225) required for covalent dimerization of LAP (10Brunner A.M. Marquardt H. Malacko A.R. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13660-13664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The numerous studies that have elucidated the mechanism of latent TGF-β1 assembly, secretion, matrix deposition, and activation have highlighted three functionally important regions in LAP: (i) a TGF-β1 binding site at the N terminus; (ii) an LTBP-1 binding epitope in the vicinity of Cys33; and (iii) a LAP dimerization interface at the C terminus (Fig. 1). Together, these sites coordinate the assembly and stability of the large latent TGF-β1 complex. In this study, using in vitro mutagenesis and functional analyses, we have identified the residues in LAP that mediate these functions. Importantly, despite low sequence homology (∼15%) between propeptides of TGF-β ligands, these structurally significant regions are broadly conserved. Mutations were introduced in full-length TGF-β1 using the QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) vector containing full-length human TGF-β1 served as the template in these reactions. For each construct, the mutated region was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Wild type and mutant TGF-β1 were produced by transient transfection in HEK-293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Briefly, HEK-293T cells were plated at 8.0 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate. Wild type or mutant TGF-β1 DNA (5 μg) was combined with Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions. After a 20-min incubation, DNA· Lipofectamine complexes were added directly to the plated cells and incubated in serum-free Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) for a further 48 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The transfected HEK-293T culture medium and cell lysates for the TGF-β1 mutants were assessed by Western blotting. At 48 h post-transfection, the culture medium was removed and concentrated 50-fold using Nanosep microconcentration devices with a 10 kDa molecular mass cut-off (Pall Life Sciences). The cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Non-reduced samples were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting. After electrophoresis, samples were transferred onto ECL Hybond membranes (GE Healthcare). TGF-β1 was detected using an R&D Systems TGF-β1 monoclonal antibody (MAB240, R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MI)). A TGF-β1 ELISA (R&D Systems) was employed to measure the amount of TGF-β1 in HEK-293T conditioned medium. Conditioned medium was diluted in 1.4% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) prior to the assay. The sensitivity of the assay was 2 pg/ml. To assess TGF-β1 latent complex stability, a time course activation assay was developed. In order to release the mature growth factor from the latent complex, conditioned medium containing TGF-β1 variants was incubated with 1 m HCl for 10 min at room temperature and then neutralized with 1.2 m NaOH in 0.5 m HEPES. Neutralized samples were incubated at room temperature for 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h prior to assay. Active and total levels were measured for each time point in the TGF-β1 ELISA, as described above. The ability of wild type LAP to reassociate with mature TGF-β1 relative to CED variants was analyzed using one-phase decay parameters in the Prism Program (version 5; GraphPad Software (San Diego, CA)). Wild type and mutant LAP were generated by PCR (antisense primer 5′-CTAGGAATTCCTATTTGTCGTCGTCGTCTTTGTAGTCGGAGCTTTGCAGATGCTGGGCCCTCTC-3′) and cloned into the HindIII and EcoRI sites of a pCDNA3.1+ vector (Invitrogen). The primers incorporated a 3′ FLAG tag. LAP variants were produced by transient transfection in HEK-293T cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) as described above. LAP expression was analyzed by Western blotting using the FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). The membranes were then probed with a sheep anti-mouse serum conjugated to the fluorescent dye IR800 (Rockland Immunochemicals (Gilbertsville, PA)). The membranes were scanned on an infrared imaging system (Odyssey IR imaging scanner; Li-Cor Biosciences (Lincoln, NE)), and relative LAP concentrations were determined. LAP variants were assessed for their ability to suppress TGF-β1 bioactivity in a luciferase assay. Briefly, HEK-293T cells were plated in poly-d-lysine-coated 48-well plates at 75,000 cells/well. After a 24-h incubation, cells were transfected with the TGF-β1-responsive A3-Lux reporter construct (37Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) and FAST2 transcription factor (37Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) as described previously (38Yan Y.T. Liu J.J. Luo Y.E.C. Haltiwanger R.S. Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 4439-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Each well was transfected with A3-Lux (25 ng), FAST-2 (50 ng), and empty vector (425 ng of pcDNA3.1+) using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). At 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 100 pm TGF-β1 (Peprotech) and increasing doses of conditioned medium containing either wild type or mutant LAP. After a 16-h incubation, cells were harvested in solubilization buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and the TGF-β1-induced luciferase activity was determined. A vector expressing the cDNA for the long isoform of LTBP-1 was kindly provided by Dr. Mark Gibson (University of Adelaide, Australia). PCR was used to isolate the 8-Cys domain of LTBP-1 and its two flanking epidermal growth factor domains (EGF-12 and EGF-13) (39Chen Y. Ali T. Todorovic V. O'leary J.M. Kristina Downing A. Rifkin D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The generated PCR product (LTBP-1 trunc) served as a template in subsequent rounds of PCR, to enable the incorporation of a rat serum albumin leader sequence at the N terminus of LTBP-1 trunc, and three hemagglutinin epitope tags (YPYDVPDYA) at the C terminus. To assess LTBP-1 interactions with TGF-β1 variants, the LTBP-1 trunc construct was co-expressed with equivalent amounts of either wild type or mutant TGF-β1 variants in HEK-293T cells by transient transfection (as described above). Binding of the TGF-β1 variants to LTBP-1 trunc was determined by Western blot analysis. Conditioned medium was concentrated 50-fold using Nanosep microconcentration devices with a 10 kDa molecular mass cut-off (Pall Life Sciences). Non-reduced samples were loaded onto 5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. The LTBP-1 fragment was detected using an anti-hemagglutinin high affinity monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science). TGF-β1 LAP was detected using LAP monoclonal antibody MAB246 (R&D Systems). Expression of TGF-β1 was determined using a TGF-β1 monoclonal antibody (MAB240, R&D systems), specific for the mature domain of TGF-β1. Significance (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) was determined using one-way Student's t tests for independent groups. All error bars shown represent S.D. Previously, we identified a hydrophobic motif within the prodomain of inhibin A that governs the biosynthesis and secretion of the mature ligand (6Walton K.L. Makanji Y. Wilce M.C. Chan K.L. Robertson D.M. Harrison C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9311-9320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Conservation of the hydrophobic residues in the prodomains of other TGF-β ligands suggested that a similar assembly mechanism may exist across the family. For TGF-β1, the identified motif lies within a stretch of 24 amino acids (Lys42–Gln65) that is highly conserved between the TGF-β isoforms and has previously been implicated in binding the mature growth factor (4Young G.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38032-38039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 14Sha X. Yang L. Gentry L.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All residues throughout this region were substituted with alanine using in vitro mutagenesis (Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis on a panel of these TGF-β1 variants indicated that conditioned medium from cells transfected with wild type TGF-β1 contained both mature (25 kDa) and precursor (95 kDa) TGF-β1 forms (Fig. 2B). As anticipated, mutation of residues within the hydrophobic motif (Ile53, Leu54, Leu57, and Leu59) as well as Ile46 resulted in a significant reduction (>70%) in the amount of total TGF-β1 produced and secreted (Fig. 2B and Table 1). An analysis of lysates from the transfected cells indicated that the decrease in TGF-β1 production was not due to a loss of TGF-β1 precursor expression because it was present at similar levels for all variants tested (Fig. 2B, bottom).TABLE 1Effect of LAP mutations on TGF-β1 biosynthesisTGF-β1 variantActive TGF-β1Total TGF-β1Percentage activeng/mlng/ml%Wild type2.42 ± 0.29218.5 ± 12.81.11 ± 0.13K42A1.14 ± 0.16121.7 ± 3.9ap < 0.01.0.94 ± 0.13K43A2.60 ± 0.14264.8 ± 2.70.98 ± 0.05K44A2.14 ± 0.07141.9 ± 5.0bp < 0.05.1.51 ± 0.05bp < 0.05.R45A1.64 ± 0.1465.6 ± 2.2ap < 0.01.2.50 ± 0.21ap < 0.01.I46A0.63 ± 0.1558.4 ± 0.8ap < 0.01.1.09 ± 0.26E47A1.55 ± 0.16194.4 ± 6.8bp < 0.05.0.80 ± 0.08A48G1.14 ± 0.21109.9 ± 7.5ap < 0.01.1.04 ± 0.19I49A0.64 ± 0.16102.8 ± 4.1ap < 0.01.0.62 ± 0.15R50Acn = 2.1.2370.21.75G51A1.55 ± 0.16180.5 ± 1.7bp < 0.05.0.86 ± 0.09Q52A1.46 ± 0.29125.4 ± 7.2bp < 0.05.1.16 ± 0.23I53A<0.6<0.6NDL54A<0.6<0.6NDS55A2.10 ± 0.08108.8 ± 6.6ap < 0.01.1.93 ± 0.07ap < 0.01.K56A3.54 ± 0.0910.4 ± 0.30ap < 0.01.33.8 ± 0.82ap < 0.01.L57A<0.61.75 ± 0.09ap < 0.01.NDR58A4.42 ± 0.30279.8 ± 9.8bp < 0.05.1.58 ± 0.11L59A1.35 ± 0.0964.6 ± 6.7ap < 0.01.2.08 ± 0.14bp < 0.05.A60G1.65 ± 0.18236.4 ± 21.70.70 ± 0.08S61A1.70 ± 0.00259.7 ± 9.3bp < 0.05.0.65 ± 0.00bp < 0.05.P62A1.80 ± 0.23210.7 ± 6.40.85 ± 0.11P63A1.85 ± 0.2683.5 ± 2.4bp < 0.05.2.21 ± 0.31bp < 0.05.S64A2.15 ± 0.65261.8 ± 7.0bp < 0.05.0.82 ± 0.25Q65A2.45 ± 0.40221.0 ± 6.61.11 ± 0.18a p < 0.01.b p < 0.05.c n = 2. Open table in a new tab TGF-β1 is secreted as a latent complex, consisting of the mature growth factor non-covalently associated with LAP. We next sought to establish whether the hydrophobic LAP residues (Ile46, Ile53, Leu54, Leu57, and Leu59) important for assembly also confer latency. HEK-293T cells were transfected with a TGF-β1-responsive luciferase reporter and treated with recombinant TGF-β1 and increasing doses of conditioned medium containing either wild-type or mutant LAP (Fig. 3, A and B). Wild-type LAP was able to suppress the TGF-β1-induced luciferase response in a dose-dependant manner (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the LAP variants carrying mutations in the hydrophobic motif had a reduced ability to suppress TGF-β1 signaling (Fig. 3C). Indeed, the I53A and L54A mutants displayed an 80-fold reduction in affinity for mature TGF-β1 compared with wild type LAP. These results extend previous findings (4Young G.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38032-38039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 6Walton K.L. Makanji Y. Wilce M.C. Chan K.L. Robertson D.M. Harrison C.A. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that demonstrated that the N terminus of LAP interacted with the TGF-β1 dimer to mediate growth factor assembly, secretion, and latency. Our site-directed mutagenesis strategy also identified ionic LAP residues (Arg45, Arg50, Lys56, and Arg58) in the vicinity of the hydrophobic motif that affected TGF-β1 production (Fig. 2B and Table 1). Cells transfected with the R58A variant secreted higher levels (∼22%) of total TGF-β1, suggesting that this mutation improved LAP-mature interactions and subsequent growth factor processing. In contrast, cells transfected with the R45A, R50A, and K56A variants produced significantly lower levels (<65%) of total TGF-β1 (Fig. 2B and Table 1). The K56A variant was particularly interesting in that cells secreted wild type levels of precursor in the virtual absence of mature growth factor. Previous studies have indicated that, within the SLC, LAP covalently associates with LTBP-1, and, in the absence of LTBPs, secreted SLC contains incorrectly paired disulfide bonds (10Brunner A.M. Marquardt H. Malacko A.R. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13660-13664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, we looked more closely at the composition of the precursor forms secreted by cells following transfection with the TGF-β1 variants (Fig. 4B). As a positive control, cells were transfected with mutant TGF-β1(C33S), which is unable to covalently link with LTBP, ensuring correct folding of the SLC (40Yoshinaga K. Obata H. Jurukovski V. Mazzieri R. Chen Y. Zilberberg L. Huso D. Melamed J. Prijatelj P. Todorovic V. Dabovic B. Rifkin D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18758-18763Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For the C33S variant, the SLC dissociated into its constituent components upon SDS-PAGE (as evidenced by the high levels of LAP dimer and the absence of TGF-β1 precursor) (Fig. 4B, lane 7). Strikingly, nearly all of the SLC secreted by cells transfected with the R45A, R50A, and K56A variants was misfolded (Fig. 4B, lanes 2, 3, and 5). This was partly attributable to the low levels of endogenous LTBPs in HEK-293T cells because >50% of the SLC produced by cells transfected with wild type TGF-β1 was also misfolded (Fig. 4B, lane 1). However, a significant proportion of wild type TGF-β1 was able to fold correctly, given the levels of LAP dimer evident following SDS-PAGE. Chen et al. (39Chen Y. Ali T. Todorovic V. O'leary J.M. Kristina Downing A. Rifkin D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) recently showed that LAP binds to ionic residues (Glu1022, Asp1029, Asp1034, Asp1056, and Glu1059) in the third 8-Cys domain of LTBP-1, resulting in a disulfide exchange between a pair of cysteines in LTBP-1 and Cys33 in LAP. We therefore postulated that the identified cationic LAP residues (Arg45, Arg50, Lys56, and Arg58) may mediate non-covalent interactions with LTBPs. To verify this, wild type and mutant TGF-β1 variants were co-transfected with a truncated fragment of LTBP-1 (LTBP-1 trunc). The conditioned medium from transfected cells was analyzed by Western blot using antibodies specific for LTBP-1 trunc (anti-HA) (Fig. 4C). When expressed alone, LTBP-1 trunc was secreted as a 50-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 4C, lane 1); however, in the presence of latent TGF-β1, LTBP-1 trunc formed a covalent complex with LAP, which was evident at 100 kDa (Fig. 4C, lane 3). In line with its positive effect on TGF-β1 production, the R58A variant consistently bound LTBP-1 with high affinity (Fig. 4C, lane 8). In contrast, alanine substitution of Arg45, Arg50, and Lys56 in LAP disrupted covalent complex formation with LTBP-1 (Fig. 4C, lanes 4, 5, and 7). Western blot using antibodies specific for TGF-β1 (Fig. 4D) revealed that the absence of LAP·LTBP complex formation was not due to a loss of TGF-β1 expression. The binding epitopes for mature TGF-β1 and LTBP-1 overlap near the N terminus of LAP (Arg45–Leu59). Protein structure prediction (QuickPhyre, Imperial College, London) indicated that this region of LAP encompasses an α-helix, and modeling (PyMOL Molecular Graphics System) predicted that the helical domain was amphipathic (Fig. 5). Hydrophobic LAP residues (Ile46 Ile53, Leu54, Leu57, and Leu59), which bind to TGF-β1, formed a contiguous epitope on one surface of the α-helix, whereas ionic residues (Arg45, Arg50, Lys56, and Arg58) that interact with LTBP-1 are mostly clustered on the opposite surface (Fig. 5, A and B). Interestingly, sequence alignment indicated that the α-helical region is almost completely conserved in the prodomains of other latent human TGF-β superfamily members (TGF-β2, TGF-β3, myostatin, and GDF-11) (Fig. 5C). Missense mutations in LAP increase activation of TGF-β1 and cause the rare bone disorder, CED (35Janssens K. ten Dijke P. Ralston S.H. Bergmann C. Van Hul W. J. Biol.

Cells transfected with the CED mutants R156C and E169K expressed substantially lower levels of total TGF-β1 (29 and 7 ng/ml, respectively) compared with wild type (118 ng/ml), whereas the R218C, R218H, H222D, and C225R variants produced slightly lower levels of total TGF-β1 (Fig. 6A and Table 2). Each of the missense mutations, however, resulted in higher levels of active TGF-β1 in the conditioned medium compared with controls (Table 2). We sought to understand the mechanism for the decreased latency of these TGF-β1 variants. Conditioned"

In a group of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies, conformational changes in Tau are associated with the initial stages of disease pathology. Folding of Tau into the MC1 conformation, where the amino acids at residues 7–9 interact with residues 312–342, is one of the earliest pathological alterations of Tau in Alzheimer disease. The mechanism of this conformational change in Tau and the subsequent effect on function and association to microtubules is largely unknown. Recent work by our group and others suggests that members of the Hsp70 family play a significant role in Tau regulation. Our new findings suggest that heat shock cognate (Hsc) 70 facilitates Tau-mediated microtubule polymerization. The association of Hsc70 with Tau was rapidly enhanced following treatment with microtubule-destabilizing agents. The fate of Tau released from the microtubule was found to be dependent on ATPase activity of Hsc70. Microtubule destabilization also rapidly increased the MC1 folded conformation of Tau. An in vitro assay suggests that Hsc70 facilitates formation of MC1 Tau. However, in a hyperphosphorylating environment, the formation of MC1 was abrogated, but Hsc70 binding to Tau was enhanced. Thus, under normal circumstances, MC1 formation may be a protective conformation facilitated by Hsc70. However, in a diseased environment, Hsc70 may preserve Tau in a more unstructured state, perhaps facilitating its pathogenicity.

The Tau protein is normally expressed in the cytoplasm of neurons and performs the critical function of stabilizing and maintaining the microtubule networks that are essential for axonal transport. During the development of Tau pathology, Tau dissociates from microtubules, and unknown factors converge to cause abnormal polymerization of Tau into highly insoluble paired helical filaments (PHF) and forms neurofibillary tangles. The number of neurofibillary tangles directly correlates with the degree of dementia seen in the progressing stages of AD (5Braak H. Braak E.

This idea of Tau adopting a conformation, or “fold,” is somewhat paradoxical because Tau is almost entirely an unstructured protein. However, evidence for a folded Tau species emerged from studies that used paired helical filaments from AD brain as haptens for monoclonal antibody production (10Weaver C.L. Espinoza M. Kress Y.

One of these antibodies, MC1, recognizes Tau when its N terminus is positioned near residues of the ninth exon. Pathological studies with this antibody revealed that formation of this species was an early event in Tau pathology in AD (10Weaver C.L. Espinoza M. Kress Y. Davies P. Neurobiol.

In a cellular environment, post-translational processing of Tau is likely essential for facilitating its aggregation, and certainly this could be regulated by the chaperone network. One of the first described chaperone regulators of Tau is the Hsp70 chaperone family. This family is comprised of 13 members; however, the cytoplasm is predominated by two members, the constitutive heat shock cognate (Hsc) 70 protein and the inducible Hsp70. Hsc70 and Hsp70 share 92% primary sequence homology. Both have highly conserved N-terminal ATPase domains as well as substrate-binding domains located just upstream of a more variable/regulatory domain (20Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (2091) Google Scholar). The cyto-protective role of Hsc70 may be particularly relevant in neurons where an attenuated Hsp70 response has been correlated with aging. Hsc70 and Hsp70 can each bind Tau in the nervous system, but endogenous Hsc70 is typically in much higher abundance than Hsp70 in the cytosol (21Manzerra P. Rush S.J. Brown I.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 22Sarkar M. Kuret J. Lee G. J. Neurosci. Res. 2008; 86: 2763-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Based on previous work, we hypothesized that the highly abundant Hsc70 protein would be the most likely member of the Hsp70 family to regulate Tau processing. We also speculated that the time when Hsc70 would be most engaged with Tau would be following its release from microtubules (17Dou F. Netzer W.J. Tanemura K. Li F. Hartl F.U. Takashima A. Gouras G.K. Greengard P. Xu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Lastly, we investigated what affect Hsc70 might have on Tau in distinct cellular environments. For the first time, we have connected microtubule dysfunction with chaperone-mediated regulation of Tau, as well as conformational changes to and hyperphosphorylation of Tau in a comprehensive way. These findings could be useful for implementing therapeutic strategies based on Hsc70, given its apparent early involvement in Tau pathogenicity. These studies may also point to a mechanism of how Tau dysfunction begins in AD and other tauopathies. MC1 and PHF1 (anti-S396/S404 p-Tau) were provided by P. Davies (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, New York, NY). Anti-Hsc70 was obtained from Stressgen Biotechnologies (Ann Arbor, MI). Anti-actin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-Tau (total Tau) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Secondary antibodies were obtained from Southern Biotech (Birmingham, AL). All of the antibodies were used at a 1:1,000 dilution with the exception of PHF1, which was used at a dilution of 1:200. Secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorophore were purchased from AlexaFluor (Molecular Probes). Albendazole, colchicine, paclitaxel, okadaic acid, and phenothiazine (methylene blue) were purchased from Sigma. Nocodazole was purchased from Tocris Bioscience. Wild type 4R Tau and Hsc70 gene sequences cloned into pET28 vector with His tag and were transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) codon Plus. Bacterial culture condition and protein purification protocol were followed as described earlier (23Jinwal U.K. Koren 3rd, J. Borysov S.I. Schmid A.B. Abisambra J.F. Blair L.J. Johnson A.G. Jones J.R. Shults C.L. O'Leary 3rd, J.C. Jin Y. Buchner J. Cox M.B. Dickey C.A. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The purity of all proteins was verified on a Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel. S phase Xenopus egg extracts were prepared according to a standard protocol (24Desai A. Verma S. Mitchison T.J. Walczak C.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 69-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) and supplemented with 5% Me2SO to stimulate microtubule polymerization as described (23Jinwal U.K. Koren 3rd, J. Borysov S.I. Schmid A.B. Abisambra J.F. Blair L.J. Johnson A.G. Jones J.R. Shults C.L. O'Leary 3rd, J.C. Jin Y. Buchner J. Cox M.B. Dickey C.A. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant wild type Tau and Hsc70 proteins were added at a final concentration of 80 ng/μl. The extracts were treated with nocodazole and incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and newly formed microtubule structures were visualized by fluorescence of incorporated rhodamine-tubuline. Image quantification was performed as previously described (25Abisambra J.F. Fiorelli T. Padmanabhan J. Neame P. Wefes I. Potter H. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, tubulin-positive signal was detected using the same threshold for each image in ImageJ (26Bolte S. Cordelières F.P. J. Microsc. 2006; 224: 213-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (3321) Google Scholar, 27Rasband M.N. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000340Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and the fraction of the total area of the field covered by the tubulin signal was collected for statistical analysis. HeLa cells stably transfected with V5-tagged 4R0N Tau were generated using G418 selection. HeLa cells were grown in Opti-Mem plus 10% fetal bovine serum (complete media; Invitrogen) and passaged every 3–5 days based on 90% confluence. IMR32 cells were maintained in Opti-Mem plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 2% of 200 mml-glutamine (Cellgro, Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA). The cells were harvested in M-PER buffer (Pierce) containing 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× phosphatase inhibitor I and II cocktails (Sigma). The measurements of Tau levels in cell culture were performed by Western blot analysis. Plasmid transfections were done utilizing Lipofectamine 2000 reagent from Invitrogen. HeLa cells stably transfected with V5-tagged 4R human Tau were transfected with 3 μg of DNA. The cells were incubated for 4 h with the Lipofectamine/plasmid mixture in Opti-MEM medium, and this was replaced with fresh complete medium for an additional 44–48 h. For the immunoprecipitation (IP) studies, cell culture lysates were incubated with 2 μg of antibody for 2–3 h at 4 °C with rocking. Then 50 μl of protein G were added and rocked at 4 °C for overnight. The protein G beads were pelleted and washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline. All of the drugs for the cell culture experiments were solubilized in Me2SO to get a 20 mm stock. For the in vivo study in mice, albendazole used in the hippocampal injections in Fig. 3C was prepared by dissolving 3 g of albendazole in 40% hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin in water. IMR32 cells were plated onto a chamber slide (Fisher) and maintained in the medium described above. The cells were treated with nocodazole for 30 min and were fixed in high pressure liquid chromatography grade methanol for 15 min. Blocking and permeabilization were done by incubating samples with Tris-buffered saline containing 5% normal goat serum, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.03 NaN3 for 60 min at 25 °C. Primary antibodies rabbit anti-Tau and rat anti-Hsc70 (1:100) were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The slide was washed five times for 5 min in 1× Tris-buffered saline. Secondary antibodies AlexaFluor 488 (anti-rabbit; 1:1000) and 594 (anti-rat; 1:1000) were added to the slides and incubated for 60 min at 25 °C. The slides were washed and coverslipped. A Leica confocal microscope was used to take images. Significance was assessed by Pearson's correlation coefficient. All of the procedures using mice were done in accord with the guidelines set forth by the University of South Florida's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The wild type FVB/N background mice brain hippocampus were injected with 2 μl of vehicle and 3 mg/ml albendazole. The surgical procedure was performed as previously described by Carty et al. (28Carty N.C. Nash K. Lee D. Mercer M. Gottschall P.E. Meyers C. Muzyczka N. Gordon M.N. Morgan D. Mol. Ther. 2008; 16: 1580-1586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The mice were anesthetized using isofluorane, and the cranium was exposed with a small incision along the skin covering the medial sagittal plane. Holes were drilled through the cranium over the desired injection sites as measured with a stereotaxic apparatus. Burr holes were drilled using a dental drill bit (SSW HP-3; SSWhiteBurs) or a 21-gauge needle (BD). A 2-μl total volume of vehicle or albendazole were dispensed into the each injection site. The animals were recovered within 10 min of post-surgery and were singly housed. 24 h after the injections, the brains were harvested as described earlier (29Dickey C. Kraft C. Jinwal U. Koren J.

Pathol. 2009; 174: 228-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and processed for immunoprecipitation as described above. Tau and HSP complex containing Hsc70, DNAJB2, and ATP were preincubated for 30 min. Paraformaldehyde was added into the samples and coated on to 96-well plate for 1 h at 37 °C followed by washing five times with wash buffer containing 0.45% NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20. Blocking of plate was done for 1 h at 37 °C by using starting blocking solution (Pierce and Thermo Fisher Scientific), followed by a wash. MC1 antibody was added at 1:50 dilutions and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and the plate was washed again. Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody was added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The plate was washed. 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride (Sigma) solution was added, and the reaction was stopped by adding 2 m H2SO4. The plate was read at 450 nm in spectrophotometer. Previous work from our lab and others suggested that the Hsp70 chaperone network plays a critical role in Tau biology and could be used as a therapeutic target for tauopathies (13Dickey C.A. Kamal A.

Of the Hsp70 family members, the Hsc70 protein expression level was found to be highest in the neurons from adult brain (21Manzerra P. Rush S.J. Brown I.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 32D'Souza S.M. Brown I.R. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 188-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 33Chen S.

Lett. 1995; 196: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Based on this evidence, we investigated the role of Hsc70 on Tau-mediated microtubule polymerization. We used our recently optimized assay for the analysis of microtubule polymerization in oocyte extract (23Jinwal U.K. Koren 3rd, J. Borysov S.I. Schmid A.B. Abisambra J.F. Blair L.J. Johnson A.G. Jones J.R. Shults C.L. O'Leary 3rd, J.C. Jin Y. Buchner J. Cox M.B. Dickey C.A. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Using purified recombinant Hsc70 and Tau, we incubated Xenopus oocyte extracts with Tau, Hsc70, or a combination of both Tau and Hsc70 for 30 min. These extracts were then treated with 20 μm nocodazole or vehicle for an additional 30 min. Microtubule formation was analyzed using fluorescent microscopy (Fig. 1A). Tubulin-positive signal was detected using the same threshold for each image as determined by ImageJ software (26Bolte S. Cordelières F.P. J. Microsc. 2006; 224: 213-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (3321) Google Scholar, 27Rasband M.N. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000340Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and the fraction of the total area of the field covered by the tubulin signal was collected for statistical analysis (Fig. 1B). The extracts incubated with Tau alone and Hsc70 alone showed similar levels of microtubule formation (Fig. 1). However, we observed a significant increase in microtubule formation when Tau was supplemented with Hsc70. Nocodazole was able to abrogate microtubule formation under all the previously mentioned conditions as seen in the representative image (Fig. 1A). These findings suggest that Hsc70 could be a potent enhancer of Tau-mediated microtubule polymerization, suggesting that microtubule dynamics could be critical for facilitating the Tau/Hsc70 interface. Although Hsc70 facilitated Tau-mediated microtubule assembly in normal cellular oocyte extracts, we found that microtubule destabilization with nocodazole overrode this activity (Fig. 1). Based on this result, we wanted to determine how microtubule destabilization may impact the association of Hsc70 with endogenous Tau in an intact cellular environment. First, we performed fluorescent immunostaining on neuroblastoma cells (IMR32) following microtubule destabilization to determine whether colocalization of these two proteins was increased. The cells were grown on chamber slides and treated with nocodazole for 30 min and then fixed, and the levels of Tau and Hsc70 were assessed by immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. Image analysis showed no significant colocalization between Tau and Hsc70 in the vehicle-treated cells as determined by Pearson's correlation coefficient; however, Hsc70 and Tau were found to be colocalized by Pearson's correlation coefficient after nocodazole treatment (Fig. 2). These data suggested that Hsc70 and Tau do have a greater propensity to interact following microtubule destabilization. However, we wanted to further confirm these data using coimmunoprecipitation studies. We tested whether the interaction of Tau with Hsc70 could be enhanced with microtubule destabilization in cells overexpressing Tau, as well as cells with endogenous Tau levels. We treated IMR32 cells that have endogenous levels of Tau with three microtubule-destabilizing drugs: albendazole, nocodazole, and colchicine. These compounds did not increase Hsc70 levels; however, consistent with our colocalization data, they did increase the binding of Tau with HSc70 (Fig. 3, A and B). A similar result was found with HeLa cell overexpressing wild type human Tau (Fig. 3C). As a control in this overexpressing cell model, we also treated with the microtubule stabilizer, paclitaxel, and saw no increase in Tau association to Hsc70 (Fig. 3C). We then tested whether the association of Hsc70 with Tau could be increased by microtubule destabilization in the brain. We injected albendazole and vehicle control into the hippocampal region of mice. Brain tissue was harvested 24 h after injection, and homogenates were analyzed by an IP with Tau antibody followed by Western blot probing with Hsc70 antibody. Again, we found that microtubule destabilization increased the association of Tau with Hsc70 (Fig. 3D). Based on these findings and our previous work with Hsp/Hsc70 chemical inhibitors (14Jinwal U.K. Miyata Y. Koren 3rd, J. Jones J.R. Trotter J.H. Chang L. O'Leary J. Morgan D. Lee D.C. Shults C.L. Rousaki A. Weeber E.J. Zuiderweg E.R. Gestwicki J.E. Dickey C.A. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 12079-12088Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), we speculated that chemically inhibiting Hsc70 activity when the number of Hsc70·Tau complexes is highest (after microtubule destabilization) would lead to enhanced efficacy for reducing Tau levels. To determine this, we performed dose-response studies with an Hsp70 ATPase inhibitor (methylene blue) in the presence or absence of a 30-min pretreatment with albendazole. Indeed we found that reductions in both endogenous and overexpressed Tau by Hsc70 inhibition were enhanced following microtubule destabilization in IMR32 cells and HeLa cells, respectively (Fig. 4). These findings provide further evidence that the association of Hsc70 with Tau is rapidly enhanced following microtubule destabilization, which forms more Hsc70·Tau complexes that can be targeted by inhibitors. Based on our results, we hypothesized that Hsc70 could be contributing to some of the early pathological modifications to Tau depending on the cellular environment. Because Hsc70 largely functions as a protein “foldase” (35Koren 3rd, J. Jinwal U.K. Jin Y. O'Leary J. Jones J.R. Johnson A.G. Blair L.J. Abisambra J.F. Chang L. Miyata Y. Cheng A.M. Guo J. Cheng J.Q.

Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 10526-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we investigated what impact Hsc70 could be having on Tau folding. We first tested whether the folding of Tau into the MC1 conformation coincided with Hsc70 binding to Tau. Again we treated two cell models, one with endogenous Tau and the other with overexpressed Tau, with microtubule destabilizers for 30 min and performed IPs with the MC1 antibody, which recognizes folded Tau, and a total Tau antibody. We found that MC1-reactive Tau was increased within 30 min in both cell models, similar to the time frame of Hsc70 binding to Tau (Fig. 5, A and B); however, this effect was more pronounced in cells overexpressing Tau (Fig. 5B). Although this suggested that Hsc70 and Tau folding were occurring in a similar time frame, we still were not certain that Hsc70 was facilitating the MC1 conformation for Tau. To test this more directly, we performed an in vitro enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiment using purified recombinant proteins to look for the amount of MC1 reactive Tau in the presence and absence of Hsc70. Impressively, we found more MC1-reactive Tau species when Tau was incubated with Hsc70 versus bovine serum albumin (Fig. 5C). Based on our findings that the MC1 Tau conformation could be rapidly facilitated by Hsc70, we speculated that Tau hyperphosphorylation might be impacted as well when microtubules are destabilized. We first investigated the phosphorylation of Tau within the first 24 h following microtubule destabilization. Again we investigated this for both endogenous Tau and overexpressed Tau. Interestingly, we observed an initial decrease in Tau phosphorylation at 30 min, the same time that MC1 Tau formation and Hsc70 binding to Tau were increased. Tau phos"
https://openalex.org/W2062109199,"The ability to silence the electrical activity of defined neuronal populations in vivo is dramatically advancing our understanding of brain function. This technology may eventually be useful clinically for treating a variety of neuropathological disorders caused by excessive neuronal activity. Several neuronal silencing methods have been developed, with the bacterial light-activated halorhodopsin and the invertebrate allatostatin-activated G protein-coupled receptor proving the most successful to date. However, both techniques may be difficult to implement clinically due to their requirement for surgically implanted stimulus delivery methods and their use of nonhuman receptors. A third silencing method, an invertebrate glutamate-gated chloride channel receptor (GluClR) activated by ivermectin, solves the stimulus delivery problem as ivermectin is a safe, well tolerated drug that reaches the brain following systemic administration. However, the limitations of this method include poor functional expression, possibly due to the requirement to coexpress two different subunits in individual neurons, and the nonhuman origin of GluClR. Here, we describe the development of a modified human alpha1 glycine receptor as an improved ivermectin-gated silencing receptor. The crucial development was the identification of a mutation, A288G, which increased ivermectin sensitivity almost 100-fold, rendering it similar to that of GluClR. Glycine sensitivity was eliminated via the F207A mutation. Its large unitary conductance, homomeric expression, and human origin may render the F207A/A288G alpha1 glycine receptor an improved silencing receptor for neuroscientific and clinical purposes. As all known highly ivermectin-sensitive GluClRs contain an endogenous glycine residue at the corresponding location, this residue appears essential for exquisite ivermectin sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1989288058,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating chronic multijoint disease of global proportions. OA presence and severity is usually documented by x-ray imaging but whole body imaging is impractical due to radiation exposure, time and cost. Systemic (serum or urine) biomarkers offer a potential alternative method of quantifying total body burden of disease but no OA-related biomarker has ever been stringently qualified to determine the feasibility of this approach. The goal of this study was to evaluate the ability of three OA-related biomarkers to predict various forms or subspecies of OA and total body burden of disease.Female participants (461) with clinical hand OA underwent radiography of hands, hips, knees and lumbar spine; x-rays were comprehensively scored for OA features of osteophyte and joint space narrowing. Three OA-related biomarkers, serum hyaluronan (sHA), cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (sCOMP), and urinary C-telopeptide of type II collagen (uCTX2), were measured by ELISA. sHA, sCOMP and uCTX2 correlated positively with total osteophyte burden in models accounting for demographics (age, weight, height): R(2) = 0.60, R(2) = 0.47, R(2) = 0.51 (all p<10(-6)); sCOMP correlated negatively with total joint space narrowing burden: R(2) = 0.69 (p<10(-6)). Biomarkers and demographics predicted 35-38% of variance in total burden of OA (total joint space narrowing or osteophyte). Joint size did not determine the contribution to the systemic biomarker concentration. Biomarker correlation with disease in the lumbar spine resembled that in the rest of the skeleton.We have suspected that the correlation of systemic biomarkers with disease has been hampered by the inability to fully phenotype the burden of OA in a patient. These results confirm the hypothesis, revealed upon adequate patient phenotyping, that systemic joint tissue concentrations of several biomarkers can be quantitative indicators of specific subspecies of OA and of total body burden of disease."
https://openalex.org/W2053861586,"Glioblastoma multiforme is the most lethal brain tumor with limited therapeutic options. Antigens expressed on the surface of malignant cells are potential targets for antibody-mediated gene/drug delivery.In this study, we investigated the ability of genetically modified human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) expressing a single-chain antibody (scFv) on their surface against a tumor specific antigen, EGFRvIII, to enhance the therapy of EGFRvIII expressing glioma cells in vivo. The growth of U87-EGFRvIII was specifically delayed in co-culture with hMSC-scFvEGFRvIII. A significant down-regulation was observed in the expression of pAkt in EGFRvIII expressing glioma cells upon culture with hMSC-scFvEGFRvIII vs. controls as well as in EGFRvIII expressing glioma cells from brain tumors co-injected with hMSC-scFvEGFRvIII in vivo. hMSC expressing scFvEGFRvIII also demonstrated several fold enhanced retention in EGFRvIII expressing flank and intracranial glioma xenografts vs. control hMSCs. The growth of U87-EGFRvIII flank xenografts was inhibited by 50% in the presence of hMSC-scFvEGFRvIII (p<0.05). Moreover, animals co-injected with U87-EGFRvIII and hMSC-scFvEGFRvIII intracranially showed significantly improved survival compared to animals injected with U87-EGFRvIII glioma cells alone or with control hMSCs. This survival was further improved when the same animals received an additional dosage of hMSC-scFvEGFRvIII two weeks after initial tumor implantation. Of note, EGFRvIII expressing brain tumors co-injected with hMSCs had a lower density of CD31 expressing blood vessels in comparison with control tumors, suggesting a possible role in tumor angiogenesis.The results presented in this study illustrate that genetically modified MSCs may function as a novel therapeutic vehicle for malignant brain tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2099022064,"Chromatin modifying enzymes play a critical role in cardiac differentiation. Previously, it has been shown that the targeted deletion of the histone methyltransferase, Smyd1, the founding member of the SET and MYND domain containing (Smyd) family, interferes with cardiomyocyte maturation and proper formation of the right heart ventricle. The highly related paralogue, Smyd2 is a histone 3 lysine 4- and lysine 36-specific methyltransferase expressed in heart and brain. Here, we report that Smyd2 is differentially expressed during cardiac development with highest expression in the neonatal heart. To elucidate the functional role of Smyd2 in the heart, we generated conditional knockout (cKO) mice harboring a cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Smyd2 and performed histological, functional and molecular analyses. Unexpectedly, cardiac deletion of Smyd2 was dispensable for proper morphological and functional development of the murine heart and had no effect on global histone 3 lysine 4 or 36 methylation. However, we provide evidence for a potential role of Smyd2 in the transcriptional regulation of genes associated with translation and reveal that Smyd2, similar to Smyd3, interacts with RNA Polymerase II as well as to the RNA helicase, HELZ."
https://openalex.org/W1993661280,"Defensins are antimicrobial peptides expressed by plants and animals. In mammals there are three subfamilies of defensins, distinguished by structural features: α, β and θ. Alpha and β-defensins are linear peptides with broad anti-microbial activity that are expressed by many mammals including humans. In contrast, θ-defensins are cyclic anti-microbial peptides made by several non-human primates but not humans. All three defensin types have anti-HIV-1 activity, but their mechanisms of action differ. We studied the anti-HIV-1 activity of one defensin from each group, HNP-1 (α), HBD-2 (β) and RTD-1 (θ). We examined how each defensin affected HIV-1 infection and demonstrated that the cyclic defensin RTD-1 inhibited HIV-1 entry, while acyclic HNP-1 and HBD-2 inhibited HIV-1 replication even when added 12 hours post-infection and blocked viral replication after HIV-1 cDNA formation. We further found that all three defensins downmodulated CXCR4. Moreover, RTD-1 inactivated X4 HIV-1, while HNP-1 and HBD-2 inactivated both X4 and R5 HIV-1. The data presented here show that acyclic and cyclic defensins block HIV-1 replication by shared and diverse mechanisms. Moreover, we found that HNP-1 and RTD-1 directly inhibited firefly luciferase enzymatic activity, which may affect the interpretation of previously published data."
https://openalex.org/W2096039524,"Background Linear regression of efficiency or LRE introduced a new paradigm for conducting absolute quantification, which does not require standard curves, can generate absolute accuracies of ±25% and has single molecule sensitivity. Derived from adapting the classic Boltzmann sigmoidal function to PCR, target quantity is calculated directly from the fluorescence readings within the central region of an amplification profile, generating 4–8 determinations from each amplification reaction. Findings Based on generating a linear representation of PCR amplification, the highly visual nature of LRE analysis is illustrated by varying reaction volume and amplification efficiency, which also demonstrates how LRE can be used to model PCR. Examining the dynamic range of LRE further demonstrates that quantitative accuracy can be maintained down to a single target molecule, and that target quantification below ten molecules conforms to that predicted by Poisson distribution. Essential to the universality of optical calibration, the fluorescence intensity generated by SYBR Green I (FU/bp) is shown to be independent of GC content and amplicon size, further verifying that absolute scale can be established using a single quantitative standard. Two high-performance lambda amplicons are also introduced that in addition to producing highly precise optical calibrations, can be used as benchmarks for performance testing. The utility of limiting dilution assay for conducting platform-independent absolute quantification is also discussed, along with the utility of defining assay performance in terms of absolute accuracy. Conclusions Founded on the ability to exploit lambda gDNA as a universal quantitative standard, LRE provides the ability to conduct absolute quantification using few resources beyond those needed for sample preparation and amplification. Combined with the quantitative and quality control capabilities of LRE, this kinetic-based approach has the potential to fundamentally transform how real-time qPCR is conducted."
https://openalex.org/W2052239980,"Intracellular membrane trafficking depends on the ordered formation and consumption of transport intermediates and requires that membranes fuse with each other in a tightly regulated and highly specific manner. Membrane anchored SNAREs assemble into SNARE complexes that bring membranes together to promote fusion. SNAP29 is a ubiquitous synaptosomal-associated SNARE protein. It interacts with several syntaxins and with the EH domain containing protein EHD1. Loss of functional SNAP29 results in CEDNIK syndrome (Cerebral Dysgenesis, Neuropathy, Ichthyosis and Keratoderma). Using fibroblast cell lines derived from CEDNIK patients, we show that SNAP29 mediates endocytic recycling of transferrin and β1-integrin. Impaired β1-integrin recycling affected cell motility, as reflected by changes in cell spreading and wound healing. No major changes were detected in exocytosis of VSVG protein from the Golgi apparatus, although the Golgi system acquired a dispersed morphology in SNAP29 deficient cells. Our results emphasize the importance of SNAP29 mediated membrane fusion in endocytic recycling and consequently, in cell motility."
https://openalex.org/W2029296469,"Inverted repeats in ion-coupled transporters have evolved independently in many unrelated families. It has been suggested that this inverted symmetry is an essential element of the mechanism that allows for the conformational transitions in transporters. We show here that small multidrug transporters offer a model for the evolution of such repeats. This family includes both homodimers and closely related heterodimers. In the former, the topology determinants, evidently identical in each protomer, are weak, and we show that for EmrE, an homodimer from Escherichia coli, the insertion into the membrane is random, and dimers are functional whether they insert into the cytoplasmic membrane with the N- and C-terminal domains facing the inside or the outside of the cell. Also, mutants designed to insert with biased topology are functional regardless of the topology. In the case of EbrAB, a heterodimer homologue supposed to interact antiparallel, we show that one of the subunits, EbrB, can also function as a homodimer, most likely in a parallel mode. In addition, the EmrE homodimer can be forced to an antiparallel topology by fusion of an additional transmembrane segment. The simplicity of the mechanism of coupling ion and substrate transport and the few requirements for substrate recognition provide the robustness necessary to tolerate such a unique and unprecedented ambiguity in the interaction of the subunits and in the dimer topology relative to the membrane. The results suggest that the small multidrug transporters are at an evolutionary junction and provide a model for the evolution of structure of transport proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2100061606,"Fibrocytes are bone-marrow derived cells, expressing both haematopoietic and stromal cell markers, which contribute to tissue repair as well as pathological fibrosis. The differentiation of fibrocytes remains poorly characterised and this has limited understanding of their biology and function. In particular two methods are used to generate fibrocytes in vitro that differ fundamentally by the presence or absence of serum.We show here that fibrocytes grown in the absence of serum (SF) differentiate more efficiently from peripheral blood mononuclear cells than CD14(+) monocytes, and respond to serum by losing their spindle-shaped fibrocyte morphology. Although fibrocytes generated in the presence of serum (SC) express the same range of markers, they differentiate more efficiently from CD14(+) monocytes and do not change their morphology in response to serum. Transcriptional analysis revealed that both types of fibrocyte are distinct from each other, fibroblasts and additional monocyte-derived progeny. The gene pathways that differ significantly between SF and SC fibrocytes include those involved in cell migration, immune responses and response to wounding.These data show that SF and SC fibrocytes are distinct but related cell types, and suggest that they will play different roles during tissue repair and fibrosis where changes in serum proteins may occur."
https://openalex.org/W1970433723,"The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) are considered to be among the most pristine coral reef ecosystems remaining on the planet. These reefs naturally contain a high percent cover of algal functional groups with relatively low coral abundance and exhibit thriving fish communities dominated by top predators. Despite their highly protected status, these reefs are at risk from both direct and indirect anthropogenic sources. This study provides the first comprehensive data on percent coverage of algae, coral, and non-coral invertebrates at the species level, and investigates spatial diversity patterns across the archipelago to document benthic communities before further environmental changes occur in response to global warming and ocean acidification. Monitoring studies show that non-calcified macroalgae cover a greater percentage of substrate than corals on many high latitude reef sites. Forereef habitats in atoll systems often contain high abundances of the green macroalga Microdictyon setchellianum and the brown macroalga Lobophora variegata, yet these organisms were uncommon in forereefs of non-atoll systems. Species of the brown macroalgal genera Padina, Sargassum, and Stypopodium and the red macroalgal genus Laurencia became increasingly common in the two northernmost atolls of the island chain but were uncommon components of more southerly islands. Conversely, the scleractinian coral Porites lobata was common on forereefs at southern islands but less common at northern islands. Currently accepted paradigms of what constitutes a ""healthy"" reef may not apply to the subtropical NWHI, and metrics used to gauge reef health (e.g., high coral cover) need to be reevaluated."
https://openalex.org/W2060511594,"mRNA localization provides polarized cells with a locally renewable source of proteins. In neurons, mRNA translation can occur at millimeters to centimeters from the cell body, giving the dendritic and axonal processes a means to autonomously respond to their environment. Despite that hundreds of mRNAs have been detected in neuronal processes, there are no reliable means to predict mRNA localization elements. Here, we have asked what RNA elements are needed for localization of transcripts encoding endoplasmic reticulum chaperone proteins in neurons. The 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of calreticulin and Grp78/BiP mRNAs show no homology to one another, but each shows extensive regions of high sequence identity to their 3'UTRs in mammalian orthologs. These conserved regions are sufficient for subcellular localization of reporter mRNAs in neurons. The 3'UTR of calreticulin has two conserved regions, and either of these is sufficient for axonal and dendritic targeting. However, only nucleotides 1315-1412 show ligand responsiveness to neurotrophin 3 (NT3) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). This NT3- and MAG-dependent axonal mRNA transport requires activation of JNK, both for calreticulin mRNA and for other mRNAs whose axonal levels are commonly regulated by NT3 and MAG."
https://openalex.org/W2106443206,"The S6 kinases (S6Ks) have been linked to a number of cellular processes, including translation, insulin metabolism, cell survival, and RNA splicing. Signaling via the phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways is critical in regulating the activity and subcellular localization of S6Ks. To date, nuclear functions of both S6K isoforms, S6K1 and S6K2, are not well understood. To better understand S6K nuclear roles, we employed affinity purification of S6Ks from nuclear preparations followed by mass spectrometry analysis for the identification of novel binding partners. In this study, we report that in contrast to S6K1, the S6K2 isoform specifically associates with a number of RNA-binding proteins, including heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). We focused on studying the mechanism and physiological relevance of the S6K2 interaction with hnRNP F/H. Interestingly, the S6K2-hnRNP F/H interaction was not affected by mitogenic stimulation, whereas mTOR binding to hnRNP F/H was induced by serum stimulation. In addition, we define a new role of hnRNP F in driving cell proliferation, which could be partially attenuated by rapamycin treatment. S6K2-driven cell proliferation, on the other hand, could be blocked by small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of hnRNP F. These results demonstrate that the specific interaction between mTOR and S6K2 with hnRNPs is implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2129081177,"In this study we wanted to gain insights into selectivity mechanisms between G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and different subtypes of G-proteins. The thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) binds G-proteins promiscuously and activates both Gs (cAMP) and Gq (IP). Our goal was to dissect selectivity patterns for both pathways in the intracellular region of this receptor. We were particularly interested in the participation of poorly investigated receptor parts. We systematically investigated the amino acids of intracellular loop (ICL) 1 and helix 8 using site-directed mutagenesis alongside characterization of cAMP and IP accumulation. This approach was guided by a homology model of activated TSHR in complex with heterotrimeric Gq, using the X-ray structure of opsin with a bound G-protein peptide as a structural template. We provide evidence that ICL1 is significantly involved in G-protein activation and our model suggests potential interactions with subunits Gα as well as Gβγ. Several amino acid substitutions impaired both IP and cAMP accumulation. Moreover, we found a few residues in ICL1 (L440, T441, H443) and helix 8 (R687) that are sensitive for Gq but not for Gs activation. Conversely, not even one residue was found that selectively affects cAMP accumulation only. Together with our previous mutagenesis data on ICL2 and ICL3 we provide here the first systematically completed map of potential interfaces between TSHR and heterotrimeric G-protein. The TSHR/Gq-heterotrimer complex is characterized by more selective interactions than the TSHR/Gs complex. In fact the receptor interface for binding Gs is a subset of that for Gq and we postulate that this may be true for other GPCRs coupling these G-proteins. Our findings support that G-protein coupling and preference is dominated by specific structural features at the intracellular region of the activated GPCR but is completed by additional complementary recognition patterns between receptor and G-protein subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W1982017841,"Early mathematical representations of infectious disease dynamics assumed a single, large, homogeneously mixing population. Over the past decade there has been growing interest in models consisting of multiple smaller subpopulations (households, workplaces, schools, communities), with the natural assumption of strong homogeneous mixing within each subpopulation, and weaker transmission between subpopulations. Here we consider a model of SIRS (susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible) infection dynamics in a very large (assumed infinite) population of households, with the simplifying assumption that each household is of the same size (although all methods may be extended to a population with a heterogeneous distribution of household sizes). For this households model we present efficient methods for studying several quantities of epidemiological interest: (i) the threshold for invasion; (ii) the early growth rate; (iii) the household offspring distribution; (iv) the endemic prevalence of infection; and (v) the transient dynamics of the process. We utilize these methods to explore a wide region of parameter space appropriate for human infectious diseases. We then extend these results to consider the effects of more realistic gamma-distributed infectious periods. We discuss how all these results differ from standard homogeneous-mixing models and assess the implications for the invasion, transmission and persistence of infection. The computational efficiency of the methodology presented here will hopefully aid in the parameterisation of structured models and in the evaluation of appropriate responses for future disease outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2088639556,"To identify novel transmembrane and secretory molecules expressed in cardiac myocytes, signal sequence trap screening was performed in rat neonatal cardiac myocytes. One of the molecules identified was a transmembrane protein, prostatic androgen repressed message-1 (PARM-1). While PARM-1 has been identified as a gene induced in prostate in response to castration, its function is largely unknown. Our expression analysis revealed that PARM-1 was specifically expressed in hearts and skeletal muscles, and in the heart, cardiac myocytes, but not non-myocytes expressed PARM-1. Immunofluorescent staining showed that PARM-1 was predominantly localized in endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In Dahl salt-sensitive rats, high-salt diet resulted in hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy and subsequent heart failure, and significantly stimulated PARM-1 expression in the hearts, with a concomitant increase in ER stress markers such as GRP78 and CHOP. In cultured cardiac myocytes, PARM-1 expression was stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines, but not by hypertrophic stimuli. A marked increase in PARM-1 expression was observed in response to ER stress inducers such as thapsigargin and tunicamycin, which also induced apoptotic cell death. Silencing PARM-1 expression by siRNAs enhanced apoptotic response in cardiac myocytes to ER stresses. PARM-1 silencing also repressed expression of PERK and ATF6, and augmented expression of CHOP without affecting IRE-1 expression and JNK and Caspase-12 activation. Thus, PARM-1 expression is induced by ER stress, which plays a protective role in cardiac myocytes through regulating PERK, ATF6 and CHOP expression. These results suggested that PARM-1 is a novel ER transmembrane molecule involved in cardiac remodeling in hypertensive heart disease."

In addition, MK shows constitutive and inflammation-dependent expression in some non-transformed tissues of the adult. In the present study, we show that both MK and PTN display strong antibacterial activity, present at physiological salt concentrations.

Analysis of the highly conserved MK and PTN orthologues from the amphibian Xenopus laevis and the fish Danio rerio suggests that they also harbor antibacterial activity in the corresponding domains.

Some AMPs are constitutively produced, while the expression of others is induced during the inflammatory response to infection. Despite considerable diversity among AMPs and increasing evidence that they affect bacteria in a multitude of ways, rupture of bacterial integrity plays a key role in the antibacterial activity of most AMPs (2Brogden K.A.

They can act as growth factors to promote tissue repair (e.g. promoting angiogenesis) and they can recruit and activate inflammatory cells (3Elsbach P. J. Clin.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2933-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). PTN was originally described as a factor promoting the outgrowth of neurites and as a mitogenic factor for murine fibroblasts (14Rauvala H.

Both MK and PTN show restricted expression during embryogenesis, being mainly expressed in the central nervous system, the respiratory system and the gastrointestinal tract. They are up-regulated in several neoplastic diseases (16Muramatsu H. Zou P. Suzuki H. Oda Y. Chen G.Y. Sakaguchi N. Sakuma S. Maeda N. Noda M. Takada Y. Muramatsu T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5405-5415Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In humans, MK is up-regulated during inflammation in some tissues of the adult and can be detected in plasma of healthy individuals (17Lucas S. Henze G. Schnabel D. Barthlen W. Sakuma S. Kurtz A.

In addition, MK recruits and activates neutrophils, suggesting important roles for this growth factor during inflammation (20Takada T. Toriyama K. Muramatsu H. Song X.J. Torii S. Muramatsu T. J.

MK and PTN bind and activate several receptors, for example the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor, the receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase β/ζ (RPTPβ/ζ), N-syndecan, whereas MK can also bind LDL-related protein (LRP) and the α4β1- and α6β1-integrins. Ligand binding results in diverse cellular effects including mitogenic responses and differentiation (22Palmer R.H. Vernersson E. Grabbe C. Hallberg B. Biochem. J. 2009; 420: 345-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Both MK and PTN are found in many species, from Drosophila to humans. They have not, however, been found in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome, suggesting their origin among insects. The existence of two genes would appear to be the result of an early gene duplication (23Englund C. Birve A. Falileeva L. Grabbe C. Palmer R.H. Dev. Genes Evol. 2006; 216: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). MK and PTN have a structure with β-sheets, held together by disulfide bridges, a structure also found in one class of AMP, namely the defensins (24Lai Y. Gallo R.L. Trends Immunol. 2009; 30: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). In addition, MK and PTN are highly cationic and contain heparin-binding sites, a common feature of AMPs (25Andersson E. Rydengård V. Sonesson A. Mörgelin M. Björck L. Schmidtchen A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1219-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Taken together, MK and PTN share many functional and structural features with AMPs. The results presented here clearly show that human MK and PTN have antibacterial properties and that antibacterial domains are conserved in MK and PTN orthologues. Recombinant human PTN and MK were from PeproTech (London, UK). According to the manufacturer, the purity of MK and PTN was greater than 98% as determined by SDS-PAGE and HPLC analyses. Determination of disulfide bonds in human recombinant MK and PTN was performed essentially as described (26Fabri L. Maruta H. Muramatsu H. Muramatsu T. Simpson R.J. Burgess A.W. Nice E.C. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 646: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Yan W.K. Goette M. Hofmann G. Zaror I. Sim J. Protein Expr. Purif. 2010; 70: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In short, the proteins were digested using trypsin (1:20 (w/w) enzyme:substrate ratio) at 37 °C for 16 h. Digestions were performed both with and without a preceding reduction/alkylation procedure (dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide). Analysis was performed using HPLC-MS/MS on a QTOF Ultima API (ESI-MS/MS) (Waters, Manchester, UK) coupled to a CapLC (Waters). In addition, non-reduced samples were subject to MALDI-TOF MS on a MALDI micro MX (Waters). Injected samples were trapped on a C18 pre-column (300 μm × 5 mm, 5 μm, 100 Å; LC-packings/Dionex, Stockholm, Sweden) and separated on an Atlantis C18 reversed phase analytical column (75 μm × 150 mm, 3 μm, 100 Å) (Waters). All experimentally obtained peptide and peptide conglomerate masses were compared with the expected masses obtained after trypsin cleavage, using the FindPept, PeptideMass, and the PeptideCutter tools (59Gasteiger E. Hoogland C. Gattiker A. Duvaud S. Wilkins M.R. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. The Proteomics Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Totawa, NJ2005: 571-607Crossref Google Scholar). When MK and PTN were digested with trypsin, without prior reduction and alkylation, masses corresponding to peptide complexes with retained sulfide bridges were identified using ESI-MS/MS and MALDI-TOF MS (26Fabri L.

Protein Expr. Purif. 2010; 70: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Sequence coverage spanning the positions of all cysteines, thus directly representing the primary amino acid sequence of both chemokines, was obtained from MS/MS of samples only when trypsin digestion was performed after dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide treatment. These experiments therefore confirm that both MK and PTN had proper tertiary conformations, i.e. contained the correct set of disulfide bonds. On a quantitative basis, no thiol groups were detected in MK and PTN, respectively, using 5, 5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB), further demonstrating that all cysteines are engaged in disulfide bonds (28Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). 20-mer peptides corresponding to various regions of human MK, PTN, and corresponding orthologues were from Sigma (PEP screen®). To analyze antibacterial activity of Miple2 protein, residues 21–279 of Miple2 were subcloned into the pGEX-T2 GST fusion protein expression vector (details available upon request). The resulting construct, pGEX-T2:Miple2, was confirmed by sequence analysis. GST-Miple2 fusion protein was induced and purified from Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) bacterial lysates by standard protocols using glutathione Sepharose beads. GST-Miple2 recombinant protein was proteolytically cleaved with thrombin (4 units/ml). After cleavage, the thrombin was removed with p-aminobenzamidine agarose. The sample was dialyzed overnight with a molecular mass cut-off of 15 kDa, followed by concentration. On an SDS-PAGE gel stained with Coomassie Blue, Miple2 was the only visible protein. To rule out that contaminating GST or thrombin contributed to the antibacterial activity of Miple2, these proteins were used in the viable count assay with Staphylococcus aureus. Neither GST (10 μm) nor thrombin (4 units/ml) showed any antibacterial activity. The Streptococcus pyogenes strain AP1 (40/58) of M1 serotype was from the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Streptococci, Prague, Czech Republic. Staphylococcus aureus (strain 5120), E. coli (strain 37.4), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (strain 27-1) were obtained from the Division of Infection Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University, Sweden. All bacteria were routinely grown in Todd-Hewitt (TH; Difco/Becton & Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) liquid medium at 37 °C and 5% CO2. All bacteria were cultivated to mid-logarithmic phase (optical density at 620 nm was 0.4) in TH medium, washed, and diluted (1:1,000) in incubation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, containing 5 mm glucose; pH 7.4). P. aeruginosa were grown for 18 h at 37 °C. 50 μl of bacteria (106 colony forming units (cfu)/ml) were incubated in the absence or presence of peptides at various concentrations, (0.003–1 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C. To quantify antibacterial activity, serial dilutions of the incubation mixtures were plated on TH agar plates, incubated overnight at 37 °C, and the number of cfu determined. To investigate the activity of MK and PTN in the presence of salt, the viable counts assay was also performed after addition of different concentrations of sodium chloride to the incubation buffer (5–150 mm). The assay was also performed in the presence of human plasma (pooled citrated plasma from at least 12 donors; Department of Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden) and sodium chloride (150 mm) at plasma concentrations ranging from 1 to 30%. To investigate the importance of heparin-binding regions of MK and PTN in antibacterial activity, the proteins were incubated with low molecular mass heparin (5 kDa; FragminTM; Pfizer, Stockholm, Sweden) at a MK/PTN: heparin ratio of 1:1 for 20 min before exposure to bacteria in the viable counts assay. The liposomes investigated were anionic (DOPE/DOPG 75/25 mol/mol). DOPG (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol, monosodium salt) and DOPE (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phoshoetanol-amine) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and of >99% purity. The lipid mixtures were dissolved in chloroform, after which the solvent was removed by evaporation under vacuum overnight. Subsequently, 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, with or without additional 150 mm NaCl, was added together with 0.1 m carboxyfluorescein (CF) (Sigma). After hydration, the lipid mixture was subjected to eight freeze-thaw cycles consisting of freezing in liquid nitrogen and heating to 60 °C. Unilamellar liposomes of about Ø 140 nm were generated by multiple extrusions through polycarbonate filters (pore size, 100 nm) mounted in a LipoFast mini-extruder (Avestin, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) at 22 °C. Untrapped CF was removed by two subsequent gel filtrations (Sephadex G-50, GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) at 22 °C, with Tris buffer (or Tris plus 150 mm NaCl) as eluent. CF release from the liposomes was determined by monitoring the emitted fluorescence at 520 nm from liposome dispersions (10 mm lipid in 10 mm Tris with 5 mm glucose, pH 7.5, with or without 150 mm additional NaCl). An absolute leakage scale was obtained by disrupting the liposomes at the end of each experiment by addition of 0.8 mm Triton X-100 (Sigma), causing 100% release and dequenching of CF. A SPEX-fluorolog 1650 0.22-m double spectrometer (SPEX Industries, Edison, NJ) was used for the liposome leakage assay. Measurements were performed in, at least, duplicates at 37 °C. Bacteria were cultured to mid-logarithmic phase as described above. S. pyogenes and E. coli were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.15 μm PTN or MK and 0.4 μm PTN or MK, respectively. To verify that the bacteria were killed, part of the sample was plated on TH agar plates, incubated at 37 °C overnight, and the cfu counted the following day. The remaining parts of the samples were processed for electron microscopy as described (29Bengtson S.H. Sandén C. Morgelin M. Marx P.F. Olin A.I. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Meijers J.C.M. Herwald H. J. Innate Immun. 2009; 1: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In short, samples (5 μl) were absorbed for 45 s onto the grids followed by two washes with distilled water. The samples were stained for 3 s with 0.75% uranyl formate droplets, followed by staining for an additional 15–20 s with 0.75% uranyl formate. The samples were investigated using a Jeol JEM 1230 EX electron microscope operated at 60 kV accelerating voltage. MK and PTN amino acid sequences were retrieved from GenBank at the NCBI site (supplemental Table S1). Each sequence was analyzed with the Psi-Blast (NCBI) (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59759) Google Scholar) to find orthologue and paralogue sequences. Sequences showing structural homologies of more than 70% were selected. These sequences were aligned using ClustalW (31Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P. Chenna R. McGettigan P.A. McWilliam H. Valentin F. Wallace I.M. Wilm A. Lopez R. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G.

U.S.A. 1992; 89: 10915-10919Crossref PubMed Scopus (4311) Google Scholar). Internal adjustments were made, taking the structural alignment into account, utilizing the ClustalW interface. The level of consistency of each position within the alignment was estimated by alignment evaluating software Tcoffee (33Poirot O. Suhre K. Abergel C. O'Toole E. Notredame C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W37-W40Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). MK and PTN amino acid sequences were used to construct a phylogenetic tree applying the neighbor-joining method (34Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar). The generated tree was rooted with human PTN, and the reliability of each branch was assessed using 1,000 bootstrap replications. A model structure of full-length human PTN (GenBankTM accession number P21246) was created by coupling generated comparative homology models of PTN N- and C-terminal domains, respectively. The theoretical model of PTN containing amino acid residues 33–96 (N-terminal domain) and residues 97–168 (C-terminal domain) was built using the NMR solution structures of human MK with Protein Data Bank codes 1MKN and 1MKC, respectively, as templates (35Iwasaki W. Nagata K. Hatanaka H. Inui T. Kimura T. Muramatsu T. Yoshida K. Tasumi M. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6936-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The sequence of PTN was aligned against the sequence of MK using the alignment displayed in Fig. 4A. The modeling was performed using the program MODELLER version 9v7 (36Eswar N. Webb B. Marti-Renom M.A. Madhusudhan M.S. Eramian D. Shen M.Y. Pieper U. Sali A. Current Protocols in Bioinformatics. John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, NJ2006Google Scholar). When modeling the N-terminal domain of PTN, a restraint defining the disulfide bond between cysteines 47 and 76 was added. Ten models for each domain were generated using the automodel class, and the model with the lowest DOPE assessment score was selected. The final model of full-length PTN was built in MODELLER using the selected models for the N- and C-terminal domains as templates. A model structure of full-length human MK (GenBankTM accession number P21741) was created in a similar manner as PTN (described above). The model of MK contains amino acid residues 21–143. Putative signal peptides of Miple1 and Miple2 were determined using neural networks and hidden Markov models as described (37Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5634) Google Scholar). Radial diffusion assay (RDA) was performed essentially as described earlier (38Lehrer R.I. Rosenman M. Harwig S.S. Jackson R. Eisenhauer P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 137: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). E. coli was grown to mid-logarithmic phase (optical density at 620 nm was 0.4) in 10 ml of full strength (3%, w/v) trypticase soy broth (TSB) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The bacteria were washed once with 10 mm Tris-HCl (containing 5 mm glucose; pH 7.4). 4 × 106 cfu were added to 5 ml of the underlay gel (0.03% TSB, 1% low electro endosmosis-type agarose (Low-EEO; Sigma), 0.02% Tween-20 (Sigma) in 10 mm Tris-HCl), and poured onto a Ø 90 mm Petri dish. After agarose solidification, Ø 4 mm wells were punched, and 6 μl of buffer alone or peptide (100 μm) were added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h to allow the peptides to diffuse. 5 ml of the overlay gel (6% TSB, 1% low-EEO agarose in 10 mm Tris-HCl) was used to cover the underlay gel. Antimicrobial activity was seen as a clearing zone around each well after incubating 18–24 h at 37 °C. The assay was performed in triplicates with either the recombinant human MK and PTN holoprotein or, overlapping peptides, (comprised of 20 amino acids) derived from the mature holoprotein sequences of MK and PTN (GenBankTM accession numbers NP_001012333 and CAA37121). Similar overlapping peptides from the MK and PTN orthologues from X. laevis (GenBankTM accession number P48530; P48533) D. rerio (GenBankTM accession numbers Midkine-related growth factor A NP_571145; Midkine-related growth factor B NP_571791; PTN NP_001003981) and D. melanogaster (GenBankTM accession number miple1 NP_612022; miple2 NP_651996) were also used. All peptides used were water-soluble. The peptides were dissolved in water and no other solvents were used. Theoretical pI were computed using the EXPASy primary structure analysis tool. Statistical significance was determined based on the Student's t test for paired observations. MK and PTN were investigated for possible antibacterial activity against a panel of pathogenic bacteria, i.e. the Gram-positive bacteria S. pyogenes and S. aureus as well as the Gram-negative bacteria, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli. The bacteria were incubated in buffer alone or with recombinant MK or PTN at concentrations ranging from 0.003 μm to 1 μm followed by a viable count assay. Both MK and PTN showed high antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Fig. 1, A & B) and slightly lower activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Fig. 1, C & D). Physiological concentrations of sodium chloride impair the antimicrobial activity of many AMPs, such as defensins (39Ganz T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (2341) Google Scholar). Saliva, during fasting conditions, contains 5 mm sodium chloride; plasma has a concentration slightly below 150 mm, whereas epithelial surfaces have concentrations in between (40Aps J.K. Martens L.C. Forensic Sci. Int. 2005; 150: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose to study the antibacterial activity of MK and PTN in the presence of sodium chloride at concentrations ranging from 5–150 mm. Because S. pyogenes itself is sensitive to salt, S. aureus and E. coli were investigated. The antibacterial activity was largely unaffected (Fig. 2A), except in the case of S. aureus incubated with PTN, where a dose-dependent decrease of the antibacterial activity by 23% was seen at 150 mm sodium chloride (Fig. 2B). The presence of plasma is also known to inhibit the activity of AMPs. The influence of human citrated plasma on the killing capacity of MK and PTN was therefore investigated using S. aureus and E. coli in the viable count assay. Already at low concentrations of plasma, a strong inhibition of both MK- and PTN-induced killing was seen, although less pronounced in the case of E. coli (Fig. 2, C & D). Many AMPs have a mode of action that includes disruption of the bacterial plasma membrane. To explore if this is the case for MK and PTN, model lipid bilayers were investigated in liposome leakage experiments. Addition of human recombinant MK and PTN caused leakage of fluorescent dye from micelles even at low concentrations of the proteins. Addition of sodium chloride at 150 mm did not affect the interaction among MK, PTN, and the lipid bilayers (Fig. 3, A & B). Electron microscopy was used to investigate effects on the bacterial morphology and integrity during the killing process. S. pyogenes and E. coli were incubated in either buffer alone, with MK or PTN (Fig. 3C). In analogy to the liposome results, bacteria incubated with MK and PTN, showed membrane protrusions and leakage of intracellular content, indicating damage to the bacterial membranes. A comparison of full-length human MK and PTN proteins displayed an identity of 45% and a similarity of 61% (Fig. 4A). Considering that the cysteines are engaged in disulfide bonds, pI values of 10.4 and 10.2 were calculated for MK and PTN, respectively. The structures of MK and PTN have been characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and consist of two domains, each made up of three antiparallel β-sheets. However, final structure calculations were only made for MK (35Iwasaki W. Nagata K. Hatanaka H. Inui T. Kimura T. Muramatsu T. Yoshida K. Tasumi M. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6936-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 41Kilpelainen I. Kaksonen M. Kinnunen T. Avikainen H. Fath M. Linhardt R.J. Raulo E. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13564-13570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A comparative homology model of PTN was made using MK as a template (Fig. 4B). The tail portions outside of the domains do not seem to form stable structures and thus move freely. The domains are stabilized by five disulfide bonds that, in the case of MK, probably provide the resistance to high temperature and acidic conditions (9Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 42Kojima S. Inui T. Kimura T. Sakakibara S. Muramatsu H. Amanuma H. Maruta H. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The secondary structures of MK and PTN are very similar, and it is apparent that the β-sheets of the N-terminal regions are very coherent (Fig. 4B). The structure of the C-terminal parts is more flexible than the N terminus, but still similar. Many AMPs have heparin binding properties, and heparin-binding sites of both MK and PTN have been determined (Fig. 4C) (43Raulo E. Tumova S. Pavlov I. Pekkanen M. Hienola A. Klankki E. Kalkkinen N.

With a view to elucidate the function of nonstructural protein, NSs encoded by the small RNA genome (S RNA), the NSs protein of GBNV- tomato (Karnataka) [1] was over-expressed in E. coli and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography. The purified rNSs protein exhibited an RNA stimulated NTPase activity. Further, this activity was metal ion dependent and was inhibited by adenosine 5′ (β, γ imido) triphosphate, an ATP analog. The rNSs could also hydrolyze dATP. Interestingly, in addition to the NTPase and dATPase activities, the rNSs exhibited ATP independent 5′ RNA/DNA phosphatase activity that was completely inhibited by AMP. The 5′ α phosphate could be removed from ssDNA, ssRNA, dsDNA and dsRNA thus confirming that rNSs has a novel 5′ α phosphatase activity. K189A mutation in the Walker motif A (GxxxxGKT) resulted in complete loss of ATPase activity, but the 5′ phosphatase activity was unaffected. On the other hand, D159A mutation in the Walker motif B (DExx) resulted in partial loss of both the activities. These results demonstrate for the first time that NSs is a bifunctional enzyme, which could participate in viral movement, replication or in suppression of the host defense mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2042884520,"The Arp2/3 complex is essential for actin filament nucleation in a variety of cellular processes. The activation of the Arp2/3 complex is mediated by nucleation-promoting factors, such as the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family proteins, which share a WCA (WH2 domain, central region, acidic region) catalytic module at the C-terminal region, required for Arp2/3 activation, but diverge at the N-terminal region, required for binding to specific activators. Here, we report the characterization of WASH, a new member of the WAS family that has nucleation-promoting factor activity and recently has been demonstrated to play a role in endosomal sorting. We found that overexpression of the WASH-WCA domain induced disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, whereas overexpression of full-length WASH in mammalian cells did not affect stress fiber organization. Furthermore, our analysis has revealed that nerve growth factor treatment of PC12 cells overexpressing full-length WASH leads to disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. We have also found that WASH interacts through its N-terminal region with BLOS2, a centrosomal protein belonging to the BLOC-1 complex that functions as a scaffolding factor in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles. In addition to BLOS2, WASH also interacts with centrosomal gamma-tubulin and with pallidin, an additional component of the BLOC-1 complex. Collectively, our data propose that WASH is a bimodular protein in which the C terminus is involved in Arp2/3-mediated actin nucleation, whereas the N-terminal portion is required for its regulation and localization in the cells. Moreover, our data suggest that WASH is also a component of the BLOC-1 complex that is associated with the centrosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2067238264,"In 2008 after a massive earthquake jolted Wenchuan, China, we reported an effect that we termed a ""Psychological Typhoon Eye"": the closer to the center of the devastated area, the lower the level of concern felt by residents about safety and health. We now report on the progression of this effect and the development of new variations after the quake as well as investigating potential explanations.We conducted two sequential surveys of 5,216 residents in non-devastated and devastated areas in September-October 2008 and April-May 2009. Respondents were asked five questions to assess their concerns about safety and health. A MANCOVA showed a significant inverse effect of residential devastation level on the estimated number of medical and psychological workers needed, the estimated probability of an epidemic outbreak, and the estimated number of self-protective behaviors needed (Ps<0.001), in spite of the passage of one year. The level of post-earthquake concern decreased significantly with an increase in the residential devastation level. Additionally, we observed two variations in the ""Psychological Typhoon Eye"" effect, in that the respondents' concern decreased with increasing relational distance between a respondent and victims who had suffered either physical or economic damage.The previously reported effect of a ""Psychological Typhoon Eye"" remains robust over a 1-year period. We found that the ""psychological immunization"" theory did not provide a satisfactory explanation for these intriguing results. Our findings may be useful in understanding how people become resilient to threats."
https://openalex.org/W2065541320,"Background Neurotrophic factors, such as glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), have shown great promise for protection and restoration of damaged or dying dopamine neurons in animal models and in some Parkinson's disease (PD) clinical trials. However, the delivery of neurotrophic factors to the brain is difficult due to their large size and poor bio-distribution. In addition, developing more efficacious trophic factors is hampered by the difficulty of synthesis and structural modification. Small molecules with neurotrophic actions that are easy to synthesize and modify to improve bioavailability are needed. Methods and Findings Here we present the neurobiological actions of dopamine neuron stimulating peptide-11 (DNSP-11), an 11-mer peptide from the proGDNF domain. In vitro, DNSP-11 supports the survival of fetal mesencephalic neurons, increasing both the number of surviving cells and neuritic outgrowth. In MN9D cells, DNSP-11 protects against dopaminergic neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced cell death, significantly decreasing TUNEL-positive cells and levels of caspase-3 activity. In vivo, a single injection of DNSP-11 into the normal adult rat substantia nigra is taken up rapidly into neurons and increases resting levels of dopamine and its metabolites for up to 28 days. Of particular note, DNSP-11 significantly improves apomorphine-induced rotational behavior, and increases dopamine and dopamine metabolite tissue levels in the substantia nigra in a rat model of PD. Unlike GDNF, DNSP-11 was found to block staurosporine- and gramicidin-induced cytotoxicity in nutrient-deprived dopaminergic B65 cells, and its neuroprotective effects included preventing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Conclusions Collectively, these data support that DNSP-11 exhibits potent neurotrophic actions analogous to GDNF, making it a viable candidate for a PD therapeutic. However, it likely signals through pathways that do not directly involve the GFRα1 receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1969562389,"BORIS (CTCFL) is the only known paralog of the versatile regulatory protein CTCF, a multifunctional DNA binding protein that mediates distinct gene regulatory functions involved in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Unlike CTCF, the expression of BORIS is normally restricted to specific cells in testes (the only cells where CTCF is not expressed), where it may play a role in reprogramming the methylation pattern of male germ line DNA. Frequent amplification of the 20q13.2 region, which contains the BORIS gene, and expression of BORIS transcripts in diverse human tumors and cell lines have led to the hypothesis that aberrant expression of BORIS may play a role in tumorigenesis by interfering with CTCF functions. However, recent studies using more quantitative methods indicate low frequency of BORIS expression in melanoma, ovarian, prostate, and bladder carcinomas. To investigate the relationship between chromosome 20q13 amplification and BORIS mRNA levels within breast cancer cell lines and tissues, we developed a quantitative RT-PCR assay to measure the levels of BORIS mRNA. Endpoint RT-PCR assays were also used to investigate the possible expression of alternatively spliced variants. Using multiple primer sets and controls, we found that neither mature BORIS transcripts nor spliced variants are commonly expressed at detectable levels in malignant breast cells or tissues, although endogenous BORIS transcripts can be induced in MCF-7 cells following 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment. In conclusion, in most breast cancer cells, endogenous BORIS is unlikely to be expressed at sufficient levels to interfere with CTCF functions. Thus it is improbable that aberrant BORIS expression plays a role in most human breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1992826629,"Background An outbreak characterized by vomiting and rapid progression to unconsciousness and death was reported in Sylhet Distrct in northeastern Bangladesh following destructive monsoon floods in November 2007. Methods and Findings We identified cases presenting to local hospitals and described their clinical signs and symptoms. We interviewed patients and their families to collect illness histories and generate hypotheses about exposures associated with disease. An epidemiological study was conducted in two outbreak villages to investigate risk factors for developing illness. 76 patients were identified from 9 villages; 25% (19/76) died. Common presenting symptoms included vomiting, elevated liver enzymes, and altered mental status. In-depth interviews with 33 cases revealed that 31 (94%) had consumed ghagra shak, an uncultivated plant, in the hours before illness onset. Ghagra shak was consumed as a main meal by villagers due to inaccessibility of other foods following destructive monsoon flooding and rises in global food prices. Persons who ate this plant were 34.2 times more likely (95% CI 10.2 to 115.8, p-value<0.000) than others to develop vomiting and unconsciousness during the outbreak in our multivariate model. Ghagra shak is the local name for Xanthium strumarium, or common cocklebur. Conclusions The consumption of Xanthium strumarium seedlings in large quantities, due to inaccessibility of other foods, caused this outbreak. The toxic chemical in the plant, carboxyatratyloside, has been previously described and eating X. strumarium seeds and seedlings has been associated with fatalities in humans and livestock. Unless people are able to meet their nutritional requirements with safe foods, they will continue to be at risk for poor health outcomes beyond undernutrition."
https://openalex.org/W2034992941,"The search for protein ligands is a crucial step in the inhibitor design process. Fragment screening represents an interesting method to rapidly find lead molecules, as it enables the exploration of a larger portion of the chemical space with a smaller number of compounds as compared to screening based on drug-sized molecules. Moreover, fragment screening usually leads to hit molecules that form few but optimal interactions with the target, thus displaying high ligand efficiencies. Here we report the screening of a homemade library composed of 200 highly diverse fragments against the human Peroxiredoxin 5 protein. Peroxiredoxins compose a family of peroxidases that share the ability to reduce peroxides through a conserved cysteine. The three-dimensional structures of these enzymes ubiquitously found throughout evolution have been extensively studied, however, their biological functions are still not well understood and to date few inhibitors have been discovered against these enzymes. Six fragments from the library were shown to bind to the Peroxiredoxin 5 active site and ligand-induced chemical shift changes were used to drive the docking of these small molecules into the protein structure. The orientation of the fragments in the binding pocket was confirmed by the study of fragment homologues, highlighting the role of hydroxyl functions that hang the ligands to the Peroxiredoxin 5 protein. Among the hit fragments, the small catechol molecule was shown to significantly inhibit Peroxiredoxin 5 activity in a thioredoxin peroxidase assay. This study reports novel data about the ligand-Peroxiredoxin interactions that will help considerably the development of potential Peroxiredoxin inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1988998765,"Background The chemokine CXCL12/SDF-1α interacts with its G-protein coupled receptor CXCR4 to induce migration of lymphoid and endothelial cells. T cell specific adapter protein (TSAd) has been found to promote migration of Jurkat T cells through interaction with the G protein β subunit. However, the molecular mechanisms for how TSAd influences cellular migration have not been characterized in detail. Principal Findings We show that TSAd is required for tyrosine phosphorylation of the Lck substrate IL2-inducible T cell kinase (Itk). Presence of Itk Y511 was necessary to boost TSAd's effect on CXCL12 induced migration of Jurkat T cells. In addition, TSAd's ability to promote CXCL12-induced actin polymerization and migration of Jurkat T lymphocytes was dependent on the Itk-interaction site in the proline-rich region of TSAd. Furthermore, TSAd-deficient murine thymocytes failed to respond to CXCL12 with increased Itk phosphorylation, and displayed reduced actin polymerization and cell migration responses. Conclusion We propose that TSAd, through its interaction with both Itk and Lck, primes Itk for Lck mediated phosphorylation and thereby regulates CXCL12 induced T cell migration and actin cytoskeleton rearrangements."
https://openalex.org/W2021163216,"In this study we aimed to identify small molecules with high affinity involved in the allosteric regulation of LVIS553, a MarR member from Lactobacillus brevis ATCC367. Using high throughput screening, novobiocin was found to specifically bind LVIS553 with a KD = 33.8 ± 2.9 μm consistent with a biologically relevant ligand. Structure guided site-directed mutagenesis identified Lys9 as a key residue in novobiocin recognition. The results found in vitro were correlated in vivo. An increased tolerance to the antibiotic was observed when LVIS553 and the downstream putative transport protein LVIS552 were either expressed in a low copy plasmid in L. brevis or as a single copy chromosomal insertion in Bacillus subtilis. We provide evidence that LVIS553 is involved in the specific regulation of a new mechanism of tolerance to novobiocin.

https://openalex.org/W2066185399,"Social-environmental influences can affect animal cognition and health. Also, human socio-economic status is a covariate factor connecting psychometric test-performance (a measure of cognitive ability), educational achievement, lifetime health, and survival. The complimentary hypothesis, that mechanisms in physiology can explain some covariance between the same traits, is disputed. Possible mechanisms involve metabolic biology affecting integrity and stability of physiological systems during development and ageing. Knowledge of these relationships is incomplete, and underlying processes are challenging to reveal in people. Model animals, however, can provide insights into connections between metabolic biology and physiological stability that may aid efforts to reduce human health and longevity disparities.We document a positive correlation between a measure of associative learning performance and the metabolic stress resilience of honeybees. This relationship is independent of social factors, and may provide basic insights into how central nervous system (CNS) function and metabolic biology can be associated. Controlling for social environment, age, and learning motivation in each bee, we establish that learning in Pavlovian conditioning to an odour is positively correlated with individual survival time in hyperoxia. Hyperoxia induces oxidative metabolic damage, and provides a measure of metabolic stress resistance that is often related to overall lifespan in laboratory animals. The positive relationship between Pavlovian learning ability and stress resilience in the bee is not equally established in other model organisms so far, and contrasts with a genetic cost of improved associative learning found in Drosophila melanogaster.Similarities in the performances of different animals need not reflect common functional principles. A correlation of honeybee Pavlovian learning and metabolic stress resilience, thereby, is not evidence of a shared biology that will give insight about systems integrity in people. Yet, the means to resolve difficult research questions often come from findings in distant areas of science while the model systems that turn out to be valuable are sometimes the least predictable. Our results add to recent findings indicating that honeybees can become instrumental to understanding how metabolic biology influences life outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2064101630,"Understanding how hepatic precursor cells can generate differentiated bile ducts is crucial for studies on epithelial morphogenesis and for development of cell therapies for hepatobiliary diseases. Epimorphin (EPM) is a key morphogen for duct morphogenesis in various epithelial organs. The role of EPM in bile duct formation (DF) from hepatic precursor cells, however, is not known. To address this issue, we used WB-F344 rat epithelial stem-like cells as model for bile duct formation. A micropattern and a uniaxial static stretch device was used to investigate the effects of EPM and stress fiber bundles on the mitosis orientation (MO) of WB cells. Immunohistochemistry of liver tissue sections demonstrated high EPM expression around bile ducts in vivo. In vitro, recombinant EPM selectively induced DF through upregulation of CK19 expression and suppression of HNF3alpha and HNF6, with no effects on other hepatocytic genes investigated. Our data provide evidence that EPM guides MO of WB-F344 cells via effects on stress fiber bundles and focal adhesion assembly, as supported by blockade EPM, beta1 integrin, and F-actin assembly. These blockers can also inhibit EPM-induced DF. These results demonstrate a new biophysical action of EPM in bile duct formation, during which determination of MO plays a crucial role."
https://openalex.org/W1967308267,"Activator of G protein Signaling 3 (AGS3) is a receptor-independent G protein activator that has been implicated in multiple biological events such as brain development, neuroplasticity and addiction, cardiac function, Golgi structure/function, macroautophagy and metabolism. However, how AGS3 is regulated is little known. We demonstrate here that AGS3 interacts with a ubiquitin specific protease USP9x, and this interaction is at least partially mediated through the C-terminal G protein regulatory domain of AGS3. Knockdown of USP9x causes a moderate reduction in the level of AGS3. In contrast, overexpression of either USP9x or its deubiquitinating domain UCH increases the amount of AGS3, whereas expression of the mutant UCH domain that lacks deubiquitinating activity does not have the same effect. As previously observed in AGS3 knockdown cells, the localization of several marker proteins of the late Golgi compartments is disturbed in cells depleted of USP9x. Taken together, our study suggests that USP9x can modulate the level of a subpopulation of AGS3, and this modulation plays a role in regulating the structure of the late Golgi compartments. Finally, we have found that levels of AGS3 and USP9x are co-regulated in the prefrontal cortex of rats withdrawn from repeated cocaine treatment. In conjunction with the above data, this observation indicates a potential role of USP9X in the regulation of the AGS3 level during cocaine-induced neuroplasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2027329429,"RasGRP1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras that binds with high affinity to diacylglycerol analogs like the phorbol esters. Recently, we demonstrated a role for RasGRP1 in skin carcinogenesis and suggested its participation in the action of tumor-promoting phorbol esters like 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) on Ras pathways in epidermal cells. Given the importance of Ras in carcinogenesis, we sought to discern whether RasGRP1 was a critical pathway in Ras activation, using a RasGRP1 knockout (KO) mouse model to examine the response of keratinocytes to TPA. In contrast to the effect seen in wild type keratinocytes, Ras(GTP) levels were barely detected in RasGRP1 KO cells even after 60 min of exposure to phorbol esters. The lack of response was rescued by enforced expression of RasGRP1. Furthermore, small hairpin RNA-induced silencing of RasGRP1 abrogated the effect of TPA on Ras. Analysis of Ras isoforms showed that both H-Ras and N-Ras depended on RasGRP1 for activation by TPA, whereas activation of K-Ras could not be detected. Although RasGRP1 was dispensable for ERK activation in response to TPA, JNK activation was reduced in the KO keratinocytes. Notably, TPA-induced phosphorylation of JNK2, but not JNK1, was reduced by RasGRP1 depletion. These data identify RasGRP1 as a critical molecule in the activation of Ras by TPA in primary mouse keratinocytes and suggest JNK2 as one of the relevant downstream targets. Given the role of TPA as a skin tumor promoter, our findings provide additional support for a role for RasGRP1 in skin carcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2098385069,"A crucial question for understanding sentence comprehension is the openness of syntactic and semantic processes for other sources of information. Using event-related potentials in a dual task paradigm, we had previously found that sentence processing takes into consideration task relevant sentence-external semantic but not syntactic information. In that study, internal and external information both varied within the same linguistic domain-either semantic or syntactic. Here we investigated whether across-domain sentence-external information would impact within-sentence processing.In one condition, adjectives within visually presented sentences of the structure [Det]-[Noun]-[Adjective]-[Verb] were semantically correct or incorrect. Simultaneously with the noun, auditory adjectives were presented that morphosyntactically matched or mismatched the visual adjectives with respect to gender.As expected, semantic violations within the sentence elicited N400 and P600 components in the ERP. However, these components were not modulated by syntactic matching of the sentence-external auditory adjective. In a second condition, syntactic within-sentence correctness-variations were combined with semantic matching variations between the auditory and the visual adjective. Here, syntactic within-sentence violations elicited a LAN and a P600 that did not interact with semantic matching of the auditory adjective. However, semantic mismatching of the latter elicited a frontocentral positivity, presumably related to an increase in discourse level complexity.The current findings underscore the open versus algorithmic nature of semantic and syntactic processing, respectively, during sentence comprehension."
