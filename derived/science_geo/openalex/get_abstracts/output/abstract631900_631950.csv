https://openalex.org/W2940585064,"Technology that translates neural activity into speech would be transformative for people who are unable to communicate as a result of neurological impairments. Decoding speech from neural activity is challenging because speaking requires very precise and rapid multi-dimensional control of vocal tract articulators. Here we designed a neural decoder that explicitly leverages kinematic and sound representations encoded in human cortical activity to synthesize audible speech. Recurrent neural networks first decoded directly recorded cortical activity into representations of articulatory movement, and then transformed these representations into speech acoustics. In closed vocabulary tests, listeners could readily identify and transcribe speech synthesized from cortical activity. Intermediate articulatory dynamics enhanced performance even with limited data. Decoded articulatory representations were highly conserved across speakers, enabling a component of the decoder to be transferrable across participants. Furthermore, the decoder could synthesize speech when a participant silently mimed sentences. These findings advance the clinical viability of using speech neuroprosthetic technology to restore spoken communication."
https://openalex.org/W2941549157,"Intestinal organoids are complex three-dimensional structures that mimic the cell-type composition and tissue organization of the intestine by recapitulating the self-organizing ability of cell populations derived from a single intestinal stem cell. Crucial in this process is a first symmetry-breaking event, in which only a fraction of identical cells in a symmetrical sphere differentiate into Paneth cells, which generate the stem-cell niche and lead to asymmetric structures such as the crypts and villi. Here we combine single-cell quantitative genomic and imaging approaches to characterize the development of intestinal organoids from single cells. We show that their development follows a regeneration process that is driven by transient activation of the transcriptional regulator YAP1. Cell-to-cell variability in YAP1, emerging in symmetrical spheres, initiates Notch and DLL1 activation, and drives the symmetry-breaking event and formation of the first Paneth cell. Our findings reveal how single cells exposed to a uniform growth-promoting environment have the intrinsic ability to generate emergent, self-organized behaviour that results in the formation of complex multicellular asymmetric structures."

https://openalex.org/W2950306946,"Majorana zero modes are quasiparticle states localized at the boundaries of topological superconductors that are expected to be ideal building blocks for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Several observations of zero-bias conductance peaks measured in tunneling spectroscopy above a critical magnetic field have been reported as experimental indications of Majorana zero modes in superconductor/semiconductor nanowires. On the other hand, two dimensional systems offer the alternative approach to confine Ma jorana channels within planar Josephson junctions, in which the phase difference {\phi} between the superconducting leads represents an additional tuning knob predicted to drive the system into the topological phase at lower magnetic fields. Here, we report the observation of phase-dependent zero-bias conductance peaks measured by tunneling spectroscopy at the end of Josephson junctions realized on a InAs/Al heterostructure. Biasing the junction to {\phi} ~ {\pi} significantly reduces the critical field at which the zero-bias peak appears, with respect to {\phi} = 0. The phase and magnetic field dependence of the zero-energy states is consistent with a model of Majorana zero modes in finite-size Josephson junctions. Besides providing experimental evidence of phase-tuned topological superconductivity, our devices are compatible with superconducting quantum electrodynamics architectures and scalable to complex geometries needed for topological quantum computing."
https://openalex.org/W2942368772,"Atherosclerosis, which underlies life-threatening cardiovascular disorders such as myocardial infarction and stroke1, is initiated by passage of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol into the artery wall and its engulfment by macrophages, which leads to foam cell formation and lesion development2,3. It is unclear how circulating LDL enters the artery wall to instigate atherosclerosis. Here we show in mice that scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) in endothelial cells mediates the delivery of LDL into arteries and its accumulation by artery wall macrophages, thereby promoting atherosclerosis. LDL particles are colocalized with SR-B1 in endothelial cell intracellular vesicles in vivo, and transcytosis of LDL across endothelial monolayers requires its direct binding to SR-B1 and an eight-amino-acid cytoplasmic domain of the receptor that recruits the guanine nucleotide exchange factor dedicator of cytokinesis 4 (DOCK4)4. DOCK4 promotes internalization of SR-B1 and transport of LDL by coupling the binding of LDL to SR-B1 with activation of RAC1. The expression of SR-B1 and DOCK4 is increased in atherosclerosis-prone regions of the mouse aorta before lesion formation, and in human atherosclerotic arteries when compared with normal arteries. These findings challenge the long-held concept that atherogenesis involves passive movement of LDL across a compromised endothelial barrier. Interventions that inhibit the endothelial delivery of LDL into artery walls may represent a new therapeutic category in the battle against cardiovascular disease. The SR-B1 receptor partners with DOCK4 and RAC1 to drive the uptake and transcytosis of LDL in endothelial cells, thereby promoting atherosclerosis in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2940516695,"The serotonin transporter (SERT) regulates neurotransmitter homeostasis through the sodium- and chloride-dependent recycling of serotonin into presynaptic neurons1-3. Major depression and anxiety disorders are treated using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors-small molecules that competitively block substrate binding and thereby prolong neurotransmitter action2,4. The dopamine and noradrenaline transporters, together with SERT, are members of the neurotransmitter sodium symporter (NSS) family. The transport activities of NSSs can be inhibited or modulated by cocaine and amphetamines2,3, and genetic variants of NSSs are associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism and bipolar disorder2,5. Studies of bacterial NSS homologues-including LeuT-have shown how their transmembrane helices (TMs) undergo conformational changes during the transport cycle, exposing a central binding site to either side of the membrane1,6-12. However, the conformational changes associated with transport in NSSs remain unknown. To elucidate structure-based mechanisms for transport in SERT we investigated its complexes with ibogaine, a hallucinogenic natural product with psychoactive and anti-addictive properties13,14. Notably, ibogaine is a non-competitive inhibitor of transport but displays competitive binding towards selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors15,16. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of SERT-ibogaine complexes captured in outward-open, occluded and inward-open conformations. Ibogaine binds to the central binding site, and closure of the extracellular gate largely involves movements of TMs 1b and 6a. Opening of the intracellular gate involves a hinge-like movement of TM1a and the partial unwinding of TM5, which together create a permeation pathway that enables substrate and ion diffusion to the cytoplasm. These structures define the structural rearrangements that occur from the outward-open to inward-open conformations, and provide insight into the mechanism of neurotransmitter transport and ibogaine inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2941157636,"Precision oncology hinges on linking tumour genotype with molecularly targeted drugs1; however, targeting the frequently dysregulated metabolic landscape of cancer has proven to be a major challenge2. Here we show that tissue context is the major determinant of dependence on the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) metabolic pathway in cancer. By analysing more than 7,000 tumours and 2,600 matched normal samples of 19 tissue types, coupled with mathematical modelling and extensive in vitro and in vivo analyses, we identify a simple and actionable set of 'rules'. If the rate-limiting enzyme of de novo NAD synthesis, NAPRT, is highly expressed in a normal tissue type, cancers that arise from that tissue will have a high frequency of NAPRT amplification and be completely and irreversibly dependent on NAPRT for survival. By contrast, tumours that arise from normal tissues that do not express NAPRT highly are entirely dependent on the NAD salvage pathway for survival. We identify the previously unknown enhancer that underlies this dependence. Amplification of NAPRT is shown to generate a pharmacologically actionable tumour cell dependence for survival. Dependence on another rate-limiting enzyme of the NAD synthesis pathway, NAMPT, as a result of enhancer remodelling is subject to resistance by NMRK1-dependent synthesis of NAD. These results identify a central role for tissue context in determining the choice of NAD biosynthetic pathway, explain the failure of NAMPT inhibitors, and pave the way for more effective treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2940668662,"Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a neurohormone that maintains circadian rhythms1 by synchronization to environmental cues and is involved in diverse physiological processes2 such as the regulation of blood pressure and core body temperature, oncogenesis, and immune function3. Melatonin is formed in the pineal gland in a light-regulated manner4 by enzymatic conversion from 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT or serotonin), and modulates sleep and wakefulness5 by activating two high-affinity G-protein-coupled receptors, type 1A (MT1) and type 1B (MT2)3,6. Shift work, travel, and ubiquitous artificial lighting can disrupt natural circadian rhythms; as a result, sleep disorders affect a substantial population in modern society and pose a considerable economic burden7. Over-the-counter melatonin is widely used to alleviate jet lag and as a safer alternative to benzodiazepines and other sleeping aids8,9, and is one of the most popular supplements in the United States10. Here, we present high-resolution room-temperature X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) structures of MT1 in complex with four agonists: the insomnia drug ramelteon11, two melatonin analogues, and the mixed melatonin-serotonin antidepressant agomelatine12,13. The structure of MT2 is described in an accompanying paper14. Although the MT1 and 5-HT receptors have similar endogenous ligands, and agomelatine acts on both receptors, the receptors differ markedly in the structure and composition of their ligand pockets; in MT1, access to the ligand pocket is tightly sealed from solvent by extracellular loop 2, leaving only a narrow channel between transmembrane helices IV and V that connects it to the lipid bilayer. The binding site is extremely compact, and ligands interact with MT1 mainly by strong aromatic stacking with Phe179 and auxiliary hydrogen bonds with Asn162 and Gln181. Our structures provide an unexpected example of atypical ligand entry for a non-lipid receptor, lay the molecular foundation of ligand recognition by melatonin receptors, and will facilitate the design of future tool compounds and therapeutic agents, while their comparison to 5-HT receptors yields insights into the evolution and polypharmacology of G-protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2941699811,"The human MT1 and MT2 melatonin receptors1,2 are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that help to regulate circadian rhythm and sleep patterns3. Drug development efforts have targeted both receptors for the treatment of insomnia, circadian rhythm and mood disorders, and cancer3, and MT2 has also been implicated in type 2 diabetes4,5. Here we report X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) structures of the human MT2 receptor in complex with the agonists 2-phenylmelatonin (2-PMT) and ramelteon6 at resolutions of 2.8 A and 3.3 A, respectively, along with two structures of function-related mutants: H2085.46A (superscripts represent the Ballesteros–Weinstein residue numbering nomenclature7) and N862.50D, obtained in complex with 2-PMT. Comparison of the structures of MT2 with a published structure8 of MT1 reveals that, despite conservation of the orthosteric ligand-binding site residues, there are notable conformational variations as well as differences in [3H]melatonin dissociation kinetics that provide insights into the selectivity between melatonin receptor subtypes. A membrane-buried lateral ligand entry channel is observed in both MT1 and MT2, but in addition the MT2 structures reveal a narrow opening towards the solvent in the extracellular part of the receptor. We provide functional and kinetic data that support a prominent role for intramembrane ligand entry in both receptors, and suggest that there might also be an extracellular entry path in MT2. Our findings contribute to a molecular understanding of melatonin receptor subtype selectivity and ligand access modes, which are essential for the design of highly selective melatonin tool compounds and therapeutic agents. Structural and functional studies show that the MT2 melatonin receptor, unlike the MT1 receptor, contains an extracellular opening for ligand entry, shedding light on receptor subtype specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2942483658,"Carbon and other volatiles in the form of gases, fluids or mineral phases are transported from Earth’s surface into the mantle at convergent margins, where the oceanic crust subducts beneath the continental crust. The efficiency of this transfer has profound implications for the nature and scale of geochemical heterogeneities in Earth’s deep mantle and shallow crustal reservoirs, as well as Earth’s oxidation state. However, the proportions of volatiles released from the forearc and backarc are not well constrained compared to fluxes from the volcanic arc front. Here we use helium and carbon isotope data from deeply sourced springs along two cross-arc transects to show that about 91 per cent of carbon released from the slab and mantle beneath the Costa Rican forearc is sequestered within the crust by calcite deposition. Around an additional three per cent is incorporated into the biomass through microbial chemolithoautotrophy, whereby microbes assimilate inorganic carbon into biomass. We estimate that between 1.2 × 108 and 1.3 × 1010 moles of carbon dioxide per year are released from the slab beneath the forearc, and thus up to about 19 per cent less carbon is being transferred into Earth’s deep mantle than previously estimated. In the forearc regions of Costa Rica, helium and carbon isotope data reveal that about 20 per cent less carbon is being transported into the deep mantle than previously thought."

In this paper we have compiled and evaluated all currently available Pb isotope data for galena and K-feldspars in China, and provided geological interpretations for how their ore-forming substances evolved across relevant tectonic terrains. We pay particular attention to the geological settings of host ore deposits that were likely exploited in ancient and historic China, detailing the heterogeneity and homogeneity of their ore formation across different metallogenic provinces and belts. Using the isotope database, and supportive geological and archaeological background information, three case studies are presented that detail the provenancing of Chinese cultural materials. The isotope data themselves are presented in ternary diagrams that allow for their concise and accurate comparison."

We test and compare transcranial Doppler (TCD) features in WML patients with or without associated cognitive impairment.A sample of non-demented elderly patients with WMLs was consecutively recruited. Mean blood flow velocity (MBFV), pulsatility index (PI), peak systolic blood flow velocity (PSV), end-diastolic blood flow velocity (EDV), and resistivity index (RI) were recorded from the middle cerebral artery bilaterally. Global cognitive functioning, frontal lobe abilities, functional status, and WML severity were also assessed.161 patients satisfying the clinical criteria for vascular cognitive impairment-no dementia (VCI-ND) were age-matched with 97 presenting WMLs without any cognitive deficit. VCI-ND patients exhibited a decrease in MBFV and EDV, as well as an increase in PI, RI, and PSV. Moreover, a significant correlation between all TCD parameters and the severity of executive dysfunction was observed, whereas PI, RI, and EDV were significantly correlated with the WML load.VCI-ND showed a hemodynamic pattern indicative of cerebral hypoperfusion and enhanced vascular resistance. These changes may be considered as the TCD correlate of VCI-ND due to microcirculation pathology. TCD provides useful indices of the occurrence and severity of small vessel disease and executive dysfunction in elderly patients at risk of future dementia."

https://openalex.org/W2941715600,"Oleate hydratases (OhyAs) belong to a large family of bacterial proteins catalyzing the hydration or isomerization of double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids. A Staphylococcus aureus gene (Sa0102) is predicted to encode an OhyA. Here, we recombinantly expressed and purified SaOhyA and found that it forms a homodimer that requires FAD for activity. SaOhyA hydrates only unsaturated fatty acids containing cis-9 double bonds, but not fatty acids with trans-9 double bonds or cis double bonds at other positions. SaOhyA products were not detected in S. aureus phospholipids and were released into the growth medium. S. aureus does not synthesize unsaturated fatty acids, and the SaOhyA substrates are derived from infection sites. Palmitoleate (16:1(9Z)) is a major mammalian skin–produced antimicrobial fatty acid that protects against S. aureus infection, and we observed that it is an SaOhyA substrate and that its hydroxylated derivative is not antimicrobial. Treatment of S. aureus with 24 μm 16:1(9Z) immediately arrested growth, followed by growth resumption after a lag period of 2 h. The ΔohyA mutant strain did not recover from the 16:1(9Z) challenge, and increasing SaOhyA expression using a plasmid system prevented the initial growth arrest. Challenging S. aureus with sapienic acid (16:1(6Z)), an antimicrobial fatty acid produced only by human skin, arrested growth without recovery in WT, ΔohyA, and SaOhyA-overexpressing strains. We conclude that SaOhyA protects S. aureus from palmitoleic acid, the antimicrobial unsaturated fatty acid produced by most mammals, and that sapienic acid, uniquely produced by humans, counters the OhyA-dependent bacterial defense mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2942089746,"It is generally difficult to specify the sources of infection by which domestic animals may acquire pathogens. Through 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we compared the composition of microbiota in the saliva, vaginal mucus, and feces of pigs, and in swabs of feeder troughs and water dispensers collected from pig farms in Vietnam. The composition of the microbiota differed between samples in each sample group. Streptococcus, Actinobacillus, Moraxella, and Rothia were the most abundant genera and significantly discriminative in saliva samples, regardless of the plasticity and changeability of the composition of microbiota in saliva. Moreover, species assignment of the genus Streptococcus revealed that Streptococcus suis was exceptional in the salivary microbiota, due to being most abundant among the streptococcal species and sharing estimated proportions of 5.7%–9.4% of the total bacteria in saliva. Thus, pig oral microbiota showed unique characteristics in which the major species was the pig pathogen. On the other hand, β-diversity analysis showed that the microbiota in saliva was distinct from those in the others. From the above results, pig saliva was shown to be the major natural habitat of S. suis, and is suggested to be the most probable source of S. suis infection."

As we have recently shown, Stella sequesters nuclear ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING finger domains 1 (UHRF1), a RING finger–type E3 ubiquitin ligase essential for DNA methylation mediated by DNA methyltransferase 1 and triggers global demethylation. Here, we report an overexpressed mutant Stella protein without nuclear export activity surprisingly retained its ability to cause global demethylation. By combining biochemical interaction assays, isothermal titration calorimetry, immunostaining, and live-cell imaging with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we found that Stella disrupts UHRF1’s association with chromatin by directly binding to the plant homeodomain of UHRF1 and competing for the interaction between UHRF1 and the histone H3 tail. Consistently, overexpression of Stella mutants that do not directly interact with UHRF1 fails to cause genome-wide demethylation. In the presence of nuclear Stella, UHRF1 could not bind to chromatin and exhibited increased dynamics in the nucleus.

https://openalex.org/W2942142518,"An extensive body of theoretical work has advocated the use of multiple human wellbeing indicators to assess the outcomes of agricultural investments in Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA). However, few studies have actually achieved it. This study investigates the human wellbeing outcomes of involvement in industrial crop production in Ghana by comparing the levels of different objective and subjective wellbeing measures for groups involved in industrial crop production as plantation workers and smallholders, and groups not involved (i.e. control groups). We use household income, adult consumption and the multidimensional poverty index (MPI) as indicators of objective wellbeing. We measure subjective wellbeing through self-reported levels of satisfaction with life, worthwhileness, happiness and anxiousness. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) analysis is used to assess whether involvement in industrial crop production increases household income and consumption. Overall, for most indicators of objective wellbeing industrial crop outgrowers, smallholders and independent smallholders are better off compared to other groups in their respective sites (in terms of mean scores), but involvement does not necessarily brings human wellbeing benefits (PSM analysis). On the other hand plantation workers are either worse off or have similar level of objective human wellbeing with control groups in their respective sites (in terms of mean scores), but involvement sometimes brings human wellbeing benefits (PSM analysis). However, workers tend to benefit from access to plantation infrastructure, which has a positive effect to their multi-dimensional poverty. In most cases the objective wellbeing measures do not correlate well with self-reported levels of subjective wellbeing. It is important to combine such indicators when evaluating the human wellbeing outcomes of agricultural investments in order to obtain a more comprehensive outlook of whether industrial crop production can become a valuable rural development strategy in SSA."

The large representation of type II TAs in M. tuberculosis is intriguing, with actual roles unknown for most. Also, little is known about the evolutionary and functional relationships among them.

In this study, we performed a comprehensive sequence analysis of the 51 VapBC TA. Using the results of this analysis, we explored the structural and functional similarities among these TAs. Strikingly, we observed that although the VapB and VapC homologues are divergent in sequence, they can be grouped into distinct sub-clusters, suggesting paralogous relationships. We noticed that VapC sequences in each sub-cluster share better overall sequence similarity than across the clusters. Careful analysis of the paralogous sequences revealed amino acid residues that are conserved within each sub-cluster with potential functional roles. Indeed, we show that mutation of these residues abrogated the activity associated with the toxins. Next, to identify orthologues of the M. tuberculosis type II TA systems, we probed 101 mycobacterial genomes and nearly 4500 prokaryotic genomes. Strikingly, we find that although only members of the MTB complex conserve the majority of homologues, some TAs are conserved in other mycobacteria as well. Furthermore, our searches uncovered several TAs of soil-dwelling, free-living bacteria from the class Actinobacteria that are homologous to the M. tuberculosis TA systems. Finally, we report five novel TAs and show that the total number of TA systems in M. tuberculosis may be even greater than previously thought. In this study, Rv2514c–Rv2515c was experimentally validated as a TA system. Recently, we have reported that Rv0366c–Rv0367c encodes a noncanonical PezAT-like toxin–antitoxin pair (28Tandon H. Sharma A. Sandhya S. Srinivasan N. Singh R. Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv0366c–Rv0367c encodes a noncanonical PezAT-like toxin–antitoxin pair.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 (30718534)1163 10.1038/s41598-018-37473-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Our findings may stimulate more detailed experimental characterization of these novel systems and expand the understanding of this complex machinery. The large representation of TA systems in M. tuberculosis prompted us to examine their relationships. To understand their divergence at the sequence level, we probed for similarities within the known VapBC TA sequences (see under “Experimental procedures” for details). Here, we found that not all VapC toxins (Table S1) are closely related to one another (Fig. S1A and Tables S2 and S3). Indeed, VapC16, VapC45, and VapC50 do not find any homologues among the toxins, suggesting very-high-sequence divergence. We find that toxins such as VapC8, VapC9, VapC34, and VapC35 are closely related to only a few other VapCs. In contrast, 30 VapC toxins (e.g. VapC2 and VapC4) are homologous to over 40 other VapC toxins (Fig. S1A and Tables S2 and S3). Similarly, none of the VapB antitoxins were able to identify all the other antitoxins as homologues, exceptions being VapB31 and VapB29 that could identify 17 homologous antitoxins in individual searches (Table S3 and Fig. S1B). These results show that the VapC toxins are more closely related among themselves than their cognate antitoxins, which have diverged extensively. Analysis of 10 MazEF TAs also showed that MazF toxins are more closely related (sequence identities in the range of 16–60%) (Fig. S2 and Table S2) than MazE antitoxins (Table S3). The high-divergence of antitoxin sequences in the MazEF TA systems implies specific recognition of their cognate toxins. However, earlier findings have reported noncognate interactions between MazF6–VapB27 and MazF9–VapB40 antitoxins, through in vivo toxicity, rescue experiments, and in vitro interaction experiments (29Zhu L. Sharp J.D. Kobayashi H. Woychik N.A. Inouye M. Noncognate Mycobacterium tuberculosis toxin–antitoxins can physically and functionally interact.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285 (20876537): 39732-3973810.1074/jbc.M110.163105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, we report several close similarities between some VapB antitoxins (VapB19, -25, -29, -31, and -33 and others listed in Table S3) and MazE6 at a sequence identity of 23–29%. These newly identified relationships raise the possibility of previously unknown noncognate interactions as part of the complex TA network of M. tuberculosis. Gene amplification is an important mechanism of adaptive evolution in response to environmental stresses in prokaryotes (30Romero D. Palacios R. Gene amplification and genomic plasticity in prokaryotes.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31 (9442891): 91-11110.1146/annurev.genet.31.1.91Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The close relationships between some of the toxins and antitoxins identified here might correspond to TA systems that respond in unison to specific types of stress, as reported earlier for some TAs (31Gupta A. Venkataraman B. Vasudevan M. Gopinath Bankar K. Co-expression network analysis of toxin–antitoxin loci in Mycobacterium tuberculosis reveals key modulators of cellular stress.Sci.

This might suggest redundancy in the available complement of TA, which can prove advantageous for critical functions such as pathogenesis. Such systems may account for enhanced fidelity at times of variations in the external environment, necessitating the need for redundant virulent strategies (33Thomas J.H. Thinking about genetic redundancy.Trends Genet. 1993; 9 (8310537): 395-39910.1016/0168-9525(93)90140-DAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We grouped closely-related toxins using a clustering approach (Fig. S2, B and C; see under “Experimental procedures” for details) (34Miele V. Penel S. Daubin V. Picard F. Kahn D. Duret L. High-quality sequence clustering guided by network topology and multiple alignment likelihood.Bioinformatics. 2012; 28 (22368255): 1078-108510.1093/bioinformatics/bts098Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We obtained seven sub-clusters that group 44 of the 51 VapC toxins and two types of “orphan” VapC toxin clusters (Fig. 1A). These orphan toxins include VapC14, VapC16, VapC45, VapC50, VapC20, VapC22, and VapC26 that are only distantly related to the remaining toxins (Table S2).When antitoxins were clustered, they formed even more isolated sub-clusters (Fig. 1B) due to higher sequence divergence between their sequences (Fig. S2A). Indeed, 15 of the VapB antitoxins could not find any other hits in the searches (Table S3). In general, we observe that detection of paralogous relationships is more robust within the toxins than the antitoxins. To examine whether toxin sub-clusters that share distinct sequence similarity provide functional information, we analyzed the full-length sequence alignment of all the 51 VapC toxins (Fig. S3). A characteristic feature of all VapC toxins is the presence of a PIN domain (∼130 residues), which spans nearly the entire length of the toxin and is responsible for the RNase activity (21Arcus V.L. Rainey P.B. Turner S.J. The PIN-domain toxin–antitoxin array in mycobacteria.Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13 (15993073): 360-36510.1016/j.tim.2005.06.008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 22Arcus V.L.

Sel. 2011; 24 (21036780): 33-4010.1093/protein/gzq081Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Inspection of the alignment shows that although the 51 VapC toxin sequences of M. tuberculosis show high-sequence divergence overall, the quartet of acidic amino acids typical of the PIN domain is well-conserved in all the toxins (Fig. S3). These residues, known to cluster at the active site and bind Mg2+ ions, are implicated in nucleotide cleavage. In addition, we find that the polar residue (Ser, Thr, or Asn), sequentially adjacent to the first conserved aspartate residue (21Arcus V.L. Rainey P.B. Turner S.J. The PIN-domain toxin–antitoxin array in mycobacteria.Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13 (15993073): 360-36510.1016/j.tim.2005.06.008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), is also well-conserved in the sequences (Fig. S3) (22Arcus V.L. McKenzie J.L. Robson J. Cook G.M. The PIN-domain ribonucleases and the prokaryotic VapBC toxin–antitoxin array.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2011; 24 (21036780): 33-4010.1093/protein/gzq081Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We find that in orphan toxins (VapC14, VapC16, VapC45, and VapC50), these residues are not conserved raising doubts on their inclusion as TAs. Notably, M. tuberculosis transcriptome analysis has shown that these loci are expressed differentially in response to drugs, implying a poor relationship between them (31Gupta A. Venkataraman B. Vasudevan M. Gopinath Bankar K. Co-expression network analysis of toxin–antitoxin loci in Mycobacterium tuberculosis reveals key modulators of cellular stress.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28724903)5868 10.1038/s41598-017-06003-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). VapC14 and VapC45 in M. tuberculosis are also closely related to homologues in Mycobacterium marinum suggesting that they might have been acquired through lateral gene transfer (35Stinear T.P. Seemann T. Harrison P.F. Jenkin G.A. Davies J.K. Johnson P.D. Abdellah Z. Arrowsmith C. Chillingworth T. Churcher C. Clarke K. Cronin A. Davis P. Goodhead I. Holroyd N. et al.Insights from the complete genome sequence of Mycobacterium marinum on the evolution of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Genome Res. 2008; 18 (18403782): 729-74110.1101/gr.075069.107Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). A recent unpublished report suggests that the putative VapC50 toxin sequence of M. tuberculosis (UniProt: L0TGF0) is altogether incorrect because it did not cleave any of the 45 tRNAs of M. tuberculosis, 9J. N. Cortese, unpublished data. thus explaining its exclusion from the distinct sub-clusters. Next, we sought to identify sequence fingerprints of individual sub-clusters by analyzing each sub-cluster alignment (Fig. 2 and Figs. S3 and S4). Here, we observed better overall conservation of residues within each sub-cluster. Indeed, average sequence identities among the members of each sub-cluster vary from ∼24% (as in sub-clusters 1 and 2), ∼35% (sub-clusters 4 and 5) to ∼43% (sub-clusters 3 and 6). Careful analysis of the alignments shows that at some positions the residue preferences differ across the sub-clusters. We reckon that such positions are likely determinants of specificity that may be responsible for maintaining cognate toxin–antitoxin interactions or toxin–substrate specificity (Fig. S3). Therefore, we derived structure-guided alignments, for sub-clusters 2, 3, and 6, by employing the crystal structures of VapC2, VapC30, and VapC5 (36Min A.B. Miallau L. Sawaya M.R. Habel J. Cascio D.

Here, we observed that the putative antitoxin-binding residues, mapped to the alignments, show far less conservation across sub-clusters than within the sub-clusters (Fig. 2). This implies that toxins across sub-clusters may show different antitoxin-binding modes that could help TA systems achieve high specificity toward their cognate pairs. Strongly supporting this observation is the finding by Ramage et al. (20Ramage H.R. Connolly L.E. Cox J.S. Comprehensive functional analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis toxin–antitoxin systems: implications for pathogenesis, stress responses, and evolution.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5 (20011113)e1000767 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000767Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) that cross-talk between noncognate VapB and VapC TAs such as VapBC2, VapBC11, VapBC22, and VapBC47 is absent. Notably, these toxins occur in distinct sub-clusters in our analysis. This only goes to show that the proposed clusters of groups are meaningful. In contrast, the conservation of residues in the interaction interface of the toxin and antitoxin within a sub-cluster could highlight residues that might enable potential cross-talk between the systems. Therefore, we examined each sub-cluster alignment for conserved residues at the predicted toxin–antitoxin interface (Fig. S4, D–F). Sub-cluster 6 alignment shows that antitoxin-binding residues of VapC5 are conserved in VapC4 and VapC8 (Fig. 2C) (39Miallau L. Faller M. Chiang J. Arbing M. Guo F. Cascio D. Eisenberg D.

Physical rehabilitation is standard practice following a period of disuse, yet mobility may be severely compromised, and recovery is commonly delayed or incomplete in special populations. Thus, a novel approach toward recovery of muscle mass is highly desired. Pericytes [neuron-glial antigen 2 (NG2)+CD31-CD45- (Lineage- [Lin-]) and CD146+Lin-] demonstrate capacity to facilitate muscle repair, yet the ability to enhance myofiber growth following disuse is unknown. In the current study, 3-4-mo-old mice were unilaterally immobilized for 14 d (IM) or immobilized for 14 d followed by 14 d of remobilization (RE). Flow cytometry and targeted gene expression analyses were completed to assess pericyte quantity and function following IM and RE. In addition, a transplantation study was conducted to assess the impact of pericytes on recovery. Results from targeted analyses suggest minimal impact of disuse on pericyte gene expression, yet NG2+Lin- pericyte quantity is reduced following IM (P < 0.05). Remarkably, pericyte transplantation recovered losses in myofiber cross-sectional area and the capillary-to-fiber ratio following RE, whereas deficits remained with vehicle alone (P = 0.01). These findings provide the first evidence that pericytes effectively rehabilitate skeletal muscle mass following disuse atrophy.-Munroe, M., Dvoretskiy, S., Lopez, A., Leong, J., Dyle, M.

https://openalex.org/W2942494084,"Fish are rich in n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), such as eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids, thus they have a great nutritional value for human health. In this study, the adipogenic potential of fatty acids commonly found in fish oil (EPA and DHA) and vegetable oils (linoleic (LA) and alpha-linolenic (ALA) acids), was evaluated in bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from gilthead sea bream. At a morphological level, cells adopted a round shape upon all treatments, losing their fibroblastic form and increasing lipid accumulation, especially in the presence of the n-6 PUFA, LA. The mRNA levels of the key transcription factor of osteogenesis, runx2 significantly diminished and those of relevant osteogenic genes remained stable after incubation with all fatty acids, suggesting that the osteogenic process might be compromised. On the other hand, transcript levels of the main adipogenesis-inducer factor, pparg increased in response to EPA. Nevertheless, the specific PPARγ antagonist T0070907 appeared to suppress the effects being caused by EPA over adipogenesis. Moreover, LA, ALA and their combinations, significantly up-regulated the fatty acid transporter and binding protein, fatp1 and fabp11, supporting the elevated lipid content found in the cells treated with those fatty acids. Overall, this study has demonstrated that fatty acids favor lipid storage in gilthead sea bream bone-derived MSCs inducing their fate into the adipogenic versus the osteogenic lineage. This process seems to be promoted via different pathways depending on the fatty acid source, being vegetable oils-derived fatty acids more prone to induce unhealthier metabolic phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2941910861,"Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1 or MAP4K1) is a Ser/Thr kinase that operates via the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways to dampen the T-cell response and antitumor immunity. Accordingly, selective HPK1 inhibition is considered a means to enhance antitumor immunity. Sunitinib, a multi-receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor approved for the management of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and pancreatic cancer, has been reported to inhibit HPK1 in vitro. In this report, we describe the crystal structures of the native HPK1 kinase domain in both nonphosphorylated and doubly phosphorylated states, in addition to a double phosphomimetic mutant (T165E,S171E), each complexed with sunitinib at 2.17–3.00-Å resolutions. The native nonphosphorylated cocrystal structure revealed an inactive dimer in which the activation loop of each monomer partially occupies the ATP- and substrate-binding sites of the partner monomer. In contrast, the structure of the protein with a doubly phosphorylated activation loop exhibited an active kinase conformation with a greatly reduced monomer–monomer interface. Conversely, the phosphomimetic mutant cocrystal structure disclosed an alternative arrangement in which the activation loops are in an extended domain-swapped configuration. These structural results indicate that HPK1 is a highly dynamic kinase that undergoes trans-regulation via dimer formation and extensive intramolecular and intermolecular remodeling of the activation segment."
https://openalex.org/W2940731675,"The HIV-1 transactivation protein (Tat) binds the HIV mRNA transactivation responsive element (TAR), regulating transcription and reactivation from latency. Drugs against Tat are unfortunately not clinically available. We reported that didehydro-cortistatin A (dCA) inhibits HIV-1 Tat activity. In human CD4+ T cells isolated from aviremic individuals and in the humanized mouse model of latency, combining dCA with antiretroviral therapy accelerates HIV-1 suppression and delays viral rebound upon treatment interruption. This drug class is amenable to block-and-lock functional cure approaches, aimed at a durable state of latency. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of rhesus macaques (RhMs) is the best-characterized model for AIDS research. Here, we demonstrate, using in vitro and cell-based assays, that dCA directly binds to SIV Tat's basic domain. dCA specifically inhibits SIV Tat binding to TAR, but not a Tat-Rev fusion protein, which activates transcription when Rev binds to its cognate RNA binding site replacing the apical region of TAR. Tat-TAR inhibition results in loss of RNA polymerase II recruitment to the SIV promoter. Importantly, dCA potently inhibits SIV reactivation from latently infected Hut78 cells and from primary CD4+ T cells explanted from SIVmac239-infected RhMs. In sum, dCA's remarkable breadth of activity encourages SIV-infected RhM use for dCA preclinical evaluation.—Mediouni, S., Kessing, C.

https://openalex.org/W2942019273,"Background One of the most promising applications of liver normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) is the potential to directly assess graft viability and injury. In most NMP studies, perfusate transaminases are utilized as markers of graft injury. Our aim was to further elucidate the metabolism of transaminases by healthy porcine livers during NMP, specifically whether such livers could clear circuit perfusate transaminases. Methods A highly concentrated transaminase solution was prepared from homogenized liver, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 107,427 U/L. Three livers in the treatment group were compared to three controls, during 48 hours of NMP. In the treatment group, the circuit perfusate was injected with the transaminase solution to artificially raise the AST level to a target of 7,500 U/L. Perfusate samples were taken at two-hour intervals and analyzed for biochemistry until NMP end. Graft oxygen consumption and vascular parameters were monitored. Results Compared to controls, treated perfusions demonstrated abrupt elevations in transaminase levels (p>0.0001) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p>0.0001), which decreased over time, but never to control baseline. Liver function, as demonstrated by lactate clearance and oxygen consumption was not different between groups. The treatment group demonstrated a higher portal vein resistance (p = 0.0003), however hepatic artery resistance was similar. Treated livers had higher bile production overall (p<0.0001). Conclusions Addition of high levels of transaminases and LDH to a healthy porcine liver during ex situ perfusion results in progressive clearance of these enzymes, suggesting preserved liver metabolism. Such tolerance tests may provide valuable indicators of prospective graft function."
https://openalex.org/W2940470409,"Plasma pharmacokinetic profiles and the anti-inflammatory efficacy of meloxicam were determined when administered subcutaneously (SC) or intramuscularly (IM) to sheep. Merino ewes were initially injected with 0.1 mL of oil of turpentine into a forelimb to induce inflammation, followed by either 1.0 mg/kg or 2.0 mg/kg of meloxicam administered either SC or IM (n = 6 per treatment group) or followed by no meloxicam administration (control) (n = 4). Ewes were examined to determine skin temperature, limb circumference, limb sensitivity and signs of lameness at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 h following treatment, with blood collected at these time-points to quantify meloxicam plasma concentrations. Skin temperature of ewes dosed with meloxicam at 1.0 mg/kg SC and 2.0 mg/kg IM at 12 h and 1.0 mg/kg SC at 24 were significantly different to the controls (P < 0.05). Limb circumferences of ewes dosed with 1.0 mg/kg IM were significantly different to controls at 10 h and 12 h (P < 0.05). All meloxicam treatment groups resulted in reduced limb sensitivity compared to controls at 6 h, with the 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg IM treatments significantly different at 12 h (P < 0.05) and 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg SC groups, significantly different to controls at 48 h (P < 0.05). No significant difference in lameness scores were detected over 48 h. The 1.0 mg/kg IM treatment had a significantly greater plasma meloxicam concentration than the 1.0 mg/kg SC treatment over 0.5 to 4 h (P < 0.001). Both 1.0 mg/kg SC and IM treatments demonstrated elimination half-lives (mean ± SD) of 10.82 ± 2.46 and 12.63 ± 2.37 h, respectively. Meloxicam at all doses provided some anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects from 6 to 48 h; however no route could be distinguished as more efficacious than the others."
https://openalex.org/W2942265210,"Agglutinin like sequence (Als) cell-wall proteins play a key role in adhesion and virulence of Candida species. Compared to the well-characterized Candida albicans ALS genes, little is known about ALS genes in the Candida parapsilosis species complex. Three incomplete ALS genes were identified in the genome sequence for Candida orthopsilosis strain 90–125 (GenBank assembly ASM31587v1): CORT0C04210 (named CoALS4210), CORT0C04220 (CoALS4220) and CORT0B00800 (CoALS800). To complete the gene sequences, new data were derived from strain 90–125 using Illumina (short-read) and Oxford Nanopore (long-read) methods. Long-read sequencing analysis confirmed the presence of 3 ALS genes in C. orthopsilosis 90–125 and resolved the gaps located in repetitive regions of CoALS800 and CoALS4220. In the new genome assembly (GenBank PQBP00000000), the CoALS4210 sequence was slightly longer than in the original assembly. C. orthopsilosis Als proteins encoded features well-known in C. albicans Als proteins such as a secretory signal peptide, N-terminal domain with a peptide-binding cavity, amyloid-forming region, repeated sequences, and a C-terminal site for glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor addition that, in yeast, suggest localization of the proteins in the cell wall. CoAls4210 and CoAls800 lacked the classic C. albicans Als tandem repeats, instead featuring short, imperfect repeats with consensus motifs such as SSSEPP and GSGN. Quantitative RT-PCR showed differential regulation of CoALS genes by growth stage in six genetically diverse C. orthopsilosis clinical isolates, which also exhibited length variation in the ALS alleles, and strain-specific gene expression patterns. Overall, long-read DNA sequencing methodology was instrumental in generating an accurate assembly of CoALS genes, thus revealing their unconventional features and first insights into their allelic variability within C. orthopsilosis clinical isolates."
https://openalex.org/W2942160562,"The mechanisms supporting positive ecological interactions are important. Foundation species can structure desert biodiversity by facilitating seedbanks of annual plants, but the direct and indirect mechanisms of shrub effects on seedbank have not been experimentally decoupled. We conducted the first test of shrubs increasing seedbank densities through direct effects on the seedbank (i.e. shrub seed-trapping, animal-mediated dispersal) and indirect effects by facilitating the annual plant community (i.e. seed deposition, annual seed-trapping). Two distinct desert ecosystems were used to contrast transient seedbank densities in shrub and open microsites by manipulating annual plant density and the presence of the persistent seedbank. We measured transient seedbank densities at the end of the growing season by collecting soil samples and extracting seeds from each respective treatment. Transient seedbank densities were greatest in shrub canopies and with relatively higher annual plant densities. The persistent seedbank contributed to transient seedbank densities only in one desert and in the open microsite. Shrubs indirectly increased seedbank densities by facilitation the seed production of the annual plants. Therefore, shrubs are increasing seedbank independently of the annual plant community, likely through trapping effects, and dependently by facilitating seed production of the annuals. These findings provide evidence for a previously undescribed mechanism that supports annual seedbanks and thus desert biodiversity. We also identify shrubs as being significant drivers of desert plant communities and emphasize the need to consider multiple mechanisms to improve our ability to predict the response of ecosystems to change."

However, a limited number of investigations has been conducted in the Southwest Pacific Ocean, and many questions remain. In this study, we determined the population structure of the bythograeid crab Austinograea alayseae from three adjacent vent systems (Manus Basin, North Fiji Basin, and Tonga Arc) in the Southwest Pacific Ocean using the sequences of two mitochondrial genes (COI and 16S rDNA) and one nuclear gene (28S rDNA). Populations were divided into a Manus clade and a North Fiji–Tonga clade, with sequence divergence values in the middle of the barcoding gap for bythograeids. We inferred that hydrographic and/or physical barriers act on the gene flow of A. alayseae between the Manus and North Fiji basins. Austinograea alayseae individuals interact freely between the North Fiji Basin and the Lau Basin (Tonga Arc). Although further studies of genetic differentiation over a geological time scale, life-history attributes, and genome-based population genetics are needed to improve our understanding of the evolutionary history of A. alayseae, our results contribute to elucidating the phylogeny, evolution, and biogeography of bythograeids."
https://openalex.org/W2941987550,"Background Black men who have sex with men, who account for less than 1% of the U.S. population, account for approximately 25% of new HIV infections annually. Condomless anal sex contributes to HIV infection among black men who have sex with men. The capacity to recover quickly from difficulties (resilience) may be protective against condomless anal sex, but has been understudied among black men who have sex with men. Psychosocial factors related to resilience, i.e., condom use self-efficacy and internalized homophobia, may also affect condomless anal sex. We assessed the association between resilience, condom use self-efficacy, internalized homophobia and condomless anal sex among black men who have sex with men. Methods Data are from a 2010–2011 study examining condomless anal sex (past 60 days) among black men who have sex with men in New York City. Validated scales assessed resilience (theoretical range = 0–100), condom use self-efficacy (theoretical range = 27–135), and internalized homophobia (theoretical range = 9–36). We described continuous variables using median and interquartile range (IQR). Univariable and multivariable Poisson regression models assuming a robust variance estimator were used to compute unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios, respectively, and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) examined the association of resilience, condom use self-efficacy, and internalized homophobia with condomless anal sex, while controlling for potential confounders (e.g., having >1 sex partner). Results The median resilience score within our sample (N = 228) was 75 (IQR = 66–83). Many black men who have sex with men reported condomless anal sex (55.7%) and >1 sex partner (58.8%). Decreased condomless anal sex was associated with increased levels of condom use self-efficacy (aPR: 0.94 per 10-point increase in condom use self-efficacy score; CI: 0.90–0.97; p-value: 0.001). Condomless anal sex was not associated with resilience or internalized homophobia. Conclusions Within this sample of black men who have sex with men, condomless anal sex was prevalent. Greater resilience was not protective against condomless anal sex. Interventions that support condom use are warranted for black men who have sex with men."

This study aimed to assess the prevalence, attitudes, behaviours and policy evaluation of midwakh smoking among 13 to 15 year olds in the UAE.We conducted secondary analyses of the 2013 UAE Global Youth Tobacco Survey. The main three outcomes were ever use, current use (past-30 days), and the number of midwakhs smoked per day. We assessed cessation, attitude, and policy measures. Regression models identified the association between each outcome measure and sex, school grade, nationality, weekly spending money, cigarette use, and parent and peer tobacco use.The prevalence of ever and current midwakh use were 18.5% and 9.0%, respectively. Daily midwakh users smoked a median of 8.0 per day while non-daily users smoked 3.8 per month. Higher midwakh prevalence was reported among wealthier males, older age groups, concurrent cigarette users and among participants having peers or parents who use tobacco. There was also variation by nationality. Reduced harm perception was greater among midwakh users than non-users. About 39.6% reported being declined a midwakh purchase due to age, and 35.5% reported noticing health warnings on packages.Midwakh use is prevalent among 13 to 15 year olds in the UAE, and burden lies mainly with daily users. Further needed research should not delay implementation and evaluation of policies known to curb tobacco use among youth, including taxation, media campaigns, and provision of cessation services."
https://openalex.org/W2940883446,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) gradual-fill is commonly used to kill laboratory rats, but this use remains controversial due to a lack of agreement between studies. Inconsistencies may arise from differences in behaviors measured (e.g. active versus passive behaviors), in how rats cope with threats, or in rat sensitivity to CO2. The aims of the current study were to 1) describe active and passive responses during CO2 forced exposure, 2) determine if these responses are consistent within individuals and across aversive stimuli, 3) assess individual differences in aversion to CO2 in aversion-avoidance and approach-avoidance tests and 4) determine how responses in aversion tests relate to individual differences in behavior during forced exposure. Twelve Sprague Dawley female rats were exposed twice to three treatments: CO2, oxygen (O2), and fox scent, and were exposed to CO2 twice in each aversion test. The change in behavior from baseline was higher for rearing and locomotion when rats were exposed to CO2 than when exposed to O2 and fox scent. Responses varied among rats but were consistent across multiple tests within rats. For example, rearing was consistent within individuals between two exposures to CO2. Similarly, the strength of aversion was consistent within individuals across multiple exposures to CO2 in aversion-avoidance and approach-avoidance testing. Latency to avoid CO2 in aversion-avoidance tests was negatively correlated with rearing during CO2 forced exposure. Collectively, these results indicate that rat responses to CO2 vary between (but are consistent within) individuals, suggesting that rats vary in CO2 sensitivity. However, even the less responsive rats avoided CO2 concentrations far below those necessary to achieve unconsciousness, indicating that all rats likely experience negative states when euthanized with CO2."
https://openalex.org/W2941067880,"In peatland restoration we often lack an information whether re-established ecosystems are functionally similar to non-degraded ones. We re-analysed the long-term outcomes of restoration on vegetation and plant functional traits in 38 European fens restored by rewetting (18 sites) and topsoil removal (20 sites). We used traits related to nutrient acquisition strategies, competitiveness, seed traits, and used single- and multi-trait metrics. A separate set of vegetation records from near-natural fens with diverse plant communities was used to generate reference values to aid the comparisons. We found that both restoration methods enhanced the similarity of species composition to non-degraded systems but trait analysis revealed differences between the two approaches. Traits linked to nutrient acquisition strategies indicated that topsoil removal was more effective than rewetting. After topsoil removal competitive species in plant communities had decreased, while stress-tolerant species had increased. A substantial reduction in nutrient availability ruled out the effect of initial disturbance. An ability to survive and grow in anoxic conditions was enhanced after restoration, but the reference values were not achieved. Rewetting was more effective than topsoil removal in restricting variation in traits values permitted in re-developing vegetation. We found no indication of a shift towards reference in seed traits, which suggested that dispersal constraint and colonization deficit can be a widespread phenomena. Two functional diversity indices: functional richness and functional dispersion showed response to restoration and shifted values towards reference mires and away from the degraded systems. We concluded that targeting only one type of environmental stressor does not lead to a recovery of fens, as it provides insufficient level of stress to restore a functional ecosystem. In general, restoration efforts do not ensure the re-establishment and long-term persistence of fens. Restoration efforts result in recovery of fen ecosystems, confirmed with our functional trait analysis, although more rigid actions are needed for restoring fully functional mires, by achieving high and constant levels of anoxia and nutrient stresses."

This study assessed the overall and sector-wise socioeconomic inequality in postnatal home visits made by Public Health Midwives (PHMs) in Sri Lanka and decomposed the observed socioeconomic inequality into potential determinants.Data from the Sri Lanka Demographic and Health Survey (SLDHS) 2006-07 were used. Data were collected from ever-married women who gave birth to their last child in 2001 or later (up to 2007). Whether the PHM visited the home to provide postnatal care within one month of the delivery was the health outcome of interest. Sri Lanka is divided into three sectors (areas) as urban, rural, and estate (plantation) based on the geographical location and the availability of infrastructure facilities. Concentration indices were calculated and concentration curves were plotted to quantify the overall and sector-wise socioeconomic inequality. Decomposition analysis using probit regression was performed to estimate the contribution of potential determinants to the observed socioeconomic inequality.Overall, 83.0% of women were visited by a PHM within one month of the delivery. The highest number of home visits was reported in the rural sector (84.5%) and lowest was reported from the estate sector (72.4%). A pro-poor, pro-rich, and no inequality were observed across urban, rural, and estate sectors respectively. Wealth had a small contribution to the estimated inequality. Province of residence and the education level of women were the main determinants of the observed socioeconomic inequality.Addressing the socioeconomic inequality of postnatal home visits made by PHMs should not be seen as a health system issue alone. The associated social determinants of health should be addressed through a multi-sectoral approach encompassing the principles of primary health care."
https://openalex.org/W2950844644,"Sec61p is the channel-forming subunit of the heterotrimeric Sec61 complex that mediates co-translational protein import into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In yeast, proteins can also be post-translationally translocated by the hetero-heptameric Sec complex, composed of the Sec61 and the Sec63 complexes. The Sec61 channel is also a candidate for the dislocation channel for misfolded proteins from the ER to the cytosol during ER-associated degradation (ERAD). The structure of the Sec61 complex is highly conserved, but the roles of its N-terminal acetylation and its amphipathic N-terminal helix are unknown so far. To gain insight into the function of the Sec61p N-terminus, we mutated its N-acetylation site, deleted its amphipathic helix, or both the helix and the N-acetylation site. Mutation of the N-acetylation site on its own had no effect on protein import into the ER in intact cells, but resulted in an ERAD defect. Yeast expressing sec61 without the N-terminal amphipathic helix displayed severe growth defects and had profound defects in post-translational protein import into the ER. Nevertheless the formation of the hetero-heptameric Sec complex was not affected. Instead, the lack of the N-terminal amphipathic helix compromised the integrity of the heterotrimeric Sec61 complex. We conclude that the N-terminal helix of Sec61p is required for post-translational protein import into the ER and Sec61 complex stability, whereas N-terminal acetylation of Sec61p plays a role in ERAD."

We compared the correlates of hospitalizations in internal medicine divisions, of adults with NCDs, between the main population groups in Israel.A cross-sectional study was conducted among Jews (N = 17,952) and Arabs (N = 10,441) aged ≥40 years with diabetes, hypertension or cardiovascular diseases, utilizing the computerized database of the largest health maintenance organization in Israel. Information was retrieved on sociodemographics, background diseases, hospitalizations and utilizations of other health services. Multivariable log binomial regression models were performed.Overall, 3516 (12.4%) patients were hospitalized at least once during a one-year period (2008). Hospitalization in internal medicine divisions was more common among Arab than Jewish patients; prevalence ratio 1.24 (95% CI 1.14-1.35), and increased with age (P<0.001). An inverse association was found between residential socioeconomic status and hospitalization among Jewish patients, but not among Arab, who lived mostly in low socioeconomic status communities. In both population groups, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, heart surgery, cardiac catheterization, kidney disease, asthma, neurodegenerative diseases, mental illnesses, smoking (in men) and disability were positively related to hospitalization in internal medicine divisions, which was more common also in patients who consulted any specialist and a specialist in cardiology. Emergency room visits, consulting with an ophthalmologist and performing cancer screening tests were inversely related to hospitalizations among Jewish patients only (P = 0.009 and P = 0.067 for interaction, respectively).In a country with universal health insurance, the correlates of hospitalizations included sociodemographics, multi-morbidity, health behaviors and health services use patterns. Socioeconomic disparities might account for ethnic differences in hospitalizations. Individuals with several NCDs, rather than one specific disease, disability and smoking should be targeted to reduce healthcare costs related to hospitalizations."
https://openalex.org/W2942368163,"The precise role of prostaglandin D (PGD)2 in allergic lung inflammation remains controversial. Here, we aimed to clarify the role of PGD2 in chronic allergic lung inflammation using hematopoietic PGD synthase (H-PGDS)-deficient mice. Repeated intranasal administration of ovalbumin (OVA) resulted in eosinophilic infiltration and mucin production in the lungs of wild type (WT) mice, leading to respiratory dysfunction. H-PGDS deficiency exacerbated these effects, which were accompanied by increased mRNA expression of TNF-α and eosinophil chemoattractants. The bronchial epithelium expressed both H-PGDS and TNF-α in the inflamed WT lung, and H-PGDS deficiency increased TNF-α expression further. In cultured bronchial tissue of WT mice, treatment with LPS elevated mRNA expression of TNF-α and eosinophil chemoattractants. H-PGDS deficiency promoted the expression of these factors, which was inhibited by treatment with PGD2 receptor, D prostanoid (DP) receptor agonist, or PGD2 metabolite 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2). Treatment with TNF-α receptor antibody inhibited eosinophil chemoattractant expression. In vivo, administration of DP agonist or 15d-PGJ2 inhibited OVA-induced allergic lung inflammation. Bronchial epithelial cell-derived PGD2 attenuated lung eosinophilic infiltration with chronic allergic inflammation; these phenomena are at least partly attributed to the inhibition of TNF-α production via DP activation or 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 signaling.-Maehara, T., Nakamura, T., Maeda, S., Aritake, K., Nakamura, M., Murata, T.

https://openalex.org/W2940599208,"As major disturbance agents, natural catastrophes impact habitats, thereby maintaining the dynamics of ecological communities. Such discrete events are expected to positively affect biodiversity because they generate high habitat heterogeneity and thus numerous ecological niche opportunities. Species typical of open and semi-open habitats, which are often of high conservation concern in modern anthropized landscapes, may benefit most from recurrent natural catastrophes that regularly reset ecosystems. We investigated bird community changes and species-specific responses to wildfire at two recently burnt temperate, montane-subalpine forest stands in an inner-Alpine Swiss valley, with a special focus on red-listed and conservation priority species. We compared bird community changes in burnt forests (spanning 13 years) with bird assemblages occurring in adjacent non-burned forest stands that served as quasi-experimental controls. Strong species-specific responses to wildfire were evidenced, resulting in a dramatic post-fire decrease in overall bird abundance and species richness. Yet, red-listed bird species and conservation priority species in Switzerland were substantially more common in burnt than in control forest stands. Many red-listed species showed a bell-shaped numeric response to wildfire over time, suggesting low habitat suitability just after fire, high habitat suitability at pioneer and early stages of vegetation succession, followed by a long-term decrease in suitability while vegetation becomes denser, especially at ground level. As established for Mediterranean regions where wildfires are especially frequent, this study shows that forest fires can also boost the populations of red-listed and priority bird species typical of open and semi-open habitats in temperate biomes. Prescribed forest fire might represent a management option for preserving threatened elements of biodiversity despite the intense public debate it will trigger."

HERG channels are also expressed in a variety of cancer cells and control cell proliferation and apoptosis. Hypoxia, a common feature of tumors, alters gating properties of hERG currents in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. In the present study, we examined the molecular mechanisms and physiological significance underlying hypoxia-altered hERG currents in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Hypoxia reduced the surface expression of 150kDa form and increased 125kDa form of hERG protein expression in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The changes in protein expression were associated with ~50% decrease in hERG potassium conductance. ER retention of hERG 125kDa form by CH was due to defective trafficking and was rescued by exposing cells to hypoxia at low temperatures or treatment with E-4031, a hERG channel blocker. Prolonged association of hERG with molecular chaperone Hsp90 resulting in complex oligomeric insoluble aggregates contributed to ER accumulation and trafficking defect. Hypoxia increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and manganese (111) tetrakis (1methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin pentachloride, a membrane-permeable antioxidant prevented hypoxia-induced degradation of 150kDa and accumulation of 125kDa forms. Impaired trafficking of hERG by hypoxia was associated with reduced cell proliferation and this effect was prevented by antioxidant treatment. These results demonstrate that hypoxia through increased oxidative stress impairs hERG trafficking, leading to decreased K+ currents resulting in cell cycle arrest in SH-SY5Y cells."
https://openalex.org/W2940921323,"During periods in which glucose absorption from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is insufficient to meet body requirements, hepatic gluconeogenesis plays a key role to maintain normal blood glucose levels. The current studies investigated the role in this process played by vasodilatory-associated phosphoprotein (VASP), a protein that is phosphorylated in hepatocytes by cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA), a key mediator of the action of glucagon. We report that following stimulation of hepatocytes with 8Br-cAMP, phosphorylation of VASP preceded induction of genes encoding key gluconeogenic enzymes, glucose-6-phosphatase (G6p) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1), and that VASP overexpression enhanced this gene induction. Conversely, hepatocytes from mice lacking VASP (Vasp-/-) displayed blunted induction of gluconeogenic enzymes in response to cAMP, and Vasp-/- mice exhibited both greater fasting hypoglycemia and blunted hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme gene expression in response to fasting in vivo. These effects of VASP deficiency were associated with reduced phosphorylation of both CREB (a key transcription factor for gluconeogenesis that lies downstream of PKA) and histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4), a combination of effects that inhibit transcription of gluconeogenic genes.

Thus, we aimed at describing effectiveness and safety of RAL-based combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) in this setting.HIV-1-infected women receiving RAL during pregnancy between 2008 and 2014 in ten French centers were retrospectively analysed for: (1) proportion of women receiving RAL anytime during pregnancy who achieved a plasma HIV-RNA (pVL) < 50 copies/mL at delivery, and (2) description of demographics, immuno-virological parameters and safety in women and new-borns.We included 94 women (median age, 33 years) of which 85% originated from Sub-Saharan Africa and 16% did not have regular health insurance coverage. Sixteen women were cART-naïve (median HIV diagnosis at 30 weeks of gestation), whereas 78 were already on cART before pregnancy (40% with pVL < 50 copies/mL). RAL was initiated before pregnancy (n = 33), during the second trimester (n = 11) and the third trimester of pregnancy (n = 50). No RAL discontinuations due to adverse events were observed. Overall, at the time of delivery, pVL was < 50 copies/mL in 70% and < 400 copies/mL in 84% of women. Specifically, pVL at delivery was < 50 copies/mL in 82%, 55% and 56% of cases when RAL was started before pregnancy, during the second or third trimester of pregnancy, respectively. Median term was 38 weeks of gestation, no defect was reported and all new-borns were HIV non-infected at Month 6.RAL appears safe and effective in this ""real-life"" study. No defect and no HIV transmission was reported in new-borns."
https://openalex.org/W2941621228,"To investigate whether binge-eating in patients with eating disorders (EDs) is associated with attentional deficits.We studied ED patients with binge-eating (n = 51), no binge-eating (n = 59) and controls (n = 58). ED patients were assessed following the stabilization of weight and ED pathology. Attention assessment included evaluation of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis, the Adult ADHD Self-Report (ASRS) and ADHD Rating Scale-IV-Home Version (ADHD-RS) questionnaires, and attention functioning assessed with neuropsychological tools. The severity of eating-related pathology, depression, anxiety and obsessionality was also monitored.Patients with binge-eating showed more ADHD symptomatology on the ADHD-RS compared with non-binge-eating patients. No differences were found between binge-eating and non-binge-eating patients in ADHD diagnosis and neuropsychological functioning. Among the specific ED subtypes, patients with anorexia nervosa binge/purge type (AN-B/P) showed the highest rates of ADHD symptomatology on the ADHD-RS, and were characterized with sustained attention deficits.Binge-eating is not associated with attention deficits as measured by objective neuropsychological tools. Nonetheless, it is associated with attentional difficulties as measured with the self-reported ADHD-RS. AN-B/P patients are the only ED category showing objective sustained attention deficits."
https://openalex.org/W2942449090,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of exercise training (ET) on the aortic vascular reactivity of ovariectomized and infarcted rats. The animals were divided into 5 groups: Control, Ovariectomized + SHAM sedentary (OVX+SHAMSED), OVX+SHAM and ET (OVX+SHAMET), OVX + Myocardial Infarction sedentary (OVX+MISED), and OVX + MI and ET (OVX+MIET). ET protocol (60 minutes/day, 5x/week) in a motorized treadmill began 15 days after MI and lasted 8 weeks. The endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vascular reactivity were evaluated as well as the role of the reactive oxygen species (ROS). Superoxide and nitric oxide (NO) production were analyzed in situ using DHE and DAF-2 fluorescence, respectively. The expression of gp91phox and of the antioxidant enzymes were evaluated by western blotting in the thoracic aorta samples. MI promoted a significant increase in the contractile response and impaired endothelium-mediated relaxation. However, ET prevented the impairment in the vascular reactivity in MI animals. In addition, the protein expression of gp91phox and superoxide production increased and the NO production decreased in the OVX+MISED group but not in the OVX+MIET group. Therefore, ET improves vascular reactivity in MI ovariectomized rats by preventing the increase in the expression of gp91phox and the decrease in the antioxidant enzymes, resulting in a normal ROS and NO production. Thus, ET can be an effective therapeutic strategy for improving the MI-induced vascular alterations in estrogen deficiency condition."
https://openalex.org/W2941014919,"Chest pain (CP) is common, frightening, and often medically unexplained. Occupational psychological factors are associated with somatic pain. Personality may influence both perceived working conditions and somatic health, thereby confounding associations of work with health. Despite this, very few studies have investigated the interplay between work factors, personality and pain. The current study assessed relationships of a relatively novel work factor, human resource primacy (HRP), and a personality factor known to be relevant to health, dispositional optimism (Opt), with CP across two years (N = 6714). A series of structural equation models (SEMs) were fitted, modeling “substantive” and “confounded” relationships of psychological factors with CP. A “common latent factor” (CLF) was included to account for bias by unmeasured factors that may have influenced all variables (e.g. reporting bias) and the role of optimism as a possible confounder of the relationship between HRP and CP was investigated specifically. Independent effects of HRP and Opt on CP were observed. No effects of HRP/CP on Opt were observed. Opt appeared to confound the relationship between HRP and CP to some extent. However, best fit was observed for a “reciprocal” model with independent lagged effects from HRP/Opt to CP as well as from CP/Opt to HRP. Thus, results suggested a mutual causal dynamic between HRP and CP along with an influence of Opt on both HRP and CP—implying that working conditions influence the experience of chest pain while the chest pain also influences the experience of working conditions. Optimistic dispositions may influence the experience of both work and pain, but not to an extent that fully explains their relationship. Hence, the notion that associations of HRP with CP are mere artifacts of optimistic/pessimistic reporting was not supported. More likely, complex reciprocal relationships exist between these factors, in which mutual reinforcements occur and both vicious and virtuous cycles may result."
https://openalex.org/W2941352737,"One approach considered for reducing health care spending is to narrow the gap in spending between high- and low-spending areas. The goal would be to reduce spending in the high areas to similar levels achieved in areas that use health care more efficiently. This paper examined the degree to which high-spending areas remain high-spending and which types of service lead to convergence or divergence in spending in New York State.This analysis utilized publicly available data on county-level spending trends for the Medicare fee-for-service population from 2007 to 2016. The study applied methods previously used to evaluate changes in the regional variation of health care spending nationally to county-level data within New York.The spread of health care spending converged slightly over the ten-year period analyzed. There was also evidence for regression to the mean-effects and changes in the relative rankings of spending across counties during this time. While there was strong evidence for convergence, many high-spending counties in 2007 remained high-spending in 2016. There were also differences in which services drove spending variation at the national level compared to within New York.These findings point to counties with consistently high spending as a potential focus for health care cost-control efforts. Moreover, efforts to reduce unwarranted variation in spending may need to be tailored to the circumstances of particular regions as there are geographic differences in which services drive spending variation. Regression to the mean effects also have important implications for the specifications of alternative provider payment models, such as accountable care organizations, which promote convergence in spending by utilizing spending targets."
https://openalex.org/W2941429520,"Previous studies showed that individuals' traits could be used to explain the similarity of behavioral patterns across different occasions. Such studies have typically focused on personality traits, and have not been extended to psychological needs. Our study used a large dataset of 1,715,078 anonymous users' App usage records to examine whether the individual's needs-based profiles of App usage were consistent across different situations (as indexed by categories of App functions). Results showed a high level of consistency across situations in a user's choice of Apps based on the needs the Apps could satisfy. These results provide clear evidence in support of cross-category App recommendation systems."

https://openalex.org/W2941599122,"Prenatal hypoxia can induce cardiovascular diseases in the offspring. This study determined whether and how prenatal hypoxia may cause malignant hypertension and impaired vascular functions in spontaneous hypertension rat (SHR) offspring at adolescent stage. Pregnant SHR were placed in a hypoxic chamber (11% O2) or normal environment (21% O2) from gestational day 6 until birth. Body weight and blood pressure (BP) of SHR offspring were measured every week from 5 weeks old. Mesenteric arteries were tested. Gestational hypoxia resulted in growth restriction during 6-12 weeks and a significant elevation in systolic pressure in adolescent offspring at 12 weeks old. Notably, endothelial vasodilatation of mesenteric arteries was impaired in SHR adolescent offspring exposed to prenatal hypoxia, vascular responses to acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were reduced, as well as plasma nitric oxide levels and expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in vessels were decreased. Moreover, mesenteric arteries in SHR offspring following prenatal hypoxia showed enhanced constriction responses to phenylephrine (PE), associated with up-regulated activities of L-type calcium channel (Ca2+-dependent), RhoA/Rock pathway signaling (Ca2+-sensitization), and intracellular Ca2+ flow. Pressurized myograph demonstrated altered mechanical properties with aggravated stiffness in vessels, while histological analysis revealed vascular structural disorganization in prenatal hypoxia offspring. The results demonstrated that blood pressure and vascular function in young SHR offspring were affected by prenatal hypoxia, providing new information on development of hypertension in adolescent offspring with inherited hypertensive backgrounds."
