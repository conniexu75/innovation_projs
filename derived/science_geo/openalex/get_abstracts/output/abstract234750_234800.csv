Carman apparently envisaged the use of the Kozeny equation with a constant, k, of 5.0, which is the constant found applicable to the case of fluid flow through unconsolidated porous media. Carman has shown2 that k may be expressed as the product of two parameters, namely, a shape factor, k0, and a term (Le/L)2 which we shall call tortuosity, T. He has adduced experimental and theoretical evidence to show that the variation of k0 with pore geometry is likely to be within the approximate range 2.0–2.5 for most porous media, and this conclusion appears to have received general confirmation. For unconsolidated porous media in the porosity range 0.25–0.90, Carman has suggested that k0 is about 2.5, and it is thus implicit that within this range T has a rather constant value of 5.0/2.5 = 2.0."

Recently, it has found experimental support2. Experiments carried out in Oxford3 have shown that laevo-nor-adrenaline was formed when the amino-acid was decarboxylated by bacterial preparations; but no similar reaction was observed in mammalian tissue extracts."

https://openalex.org/W2082012151,"A CONSIDERABLE amount of work has been carried out in recent years on the problem of the ‘let-down’ of milk in the cow; but, so far as we are aware, nothing has been published on any such work on the sow. From the lactational point of view, the sow differs from the cow in several ways; she has, for example, an exceptionally strong control over the release of her milk. While the normal cow lets down her milk easily, it is normally impossible to obtain by hand any milk from the sow unless let-down is first artificially induced by the intravenous injection of an extract of the posterior pituitary lobe1. In addition, it is necessary to rope the sow during the process of obtaining the milk, and consequently the condition of co-operation which normally exists in the routine milking of the cow does not obtain."

Hæmoglobin concentration can be estimated by quite simple apparatus with results that have a coefficient of variation of less than 3 percent1, whereas the corresponding figure for red-cell counting is about 9 per cent2."

https://openalex.org/W2074318474,"ON the strength of the results obtained by Slifer1, which prove that it is possible to influence the development of grasshopper eggs by treatment with a wax-solvent agent, a similar experiment has been made to investigate the possibility of breaking the diapause in winter eggs of the European red spider (Metatetranychus ulmi Koch)."
https://openalex.org/W2428485956,"THE ability to account quantitatively for the observed masses is certainly one of the tests a successful meson theory must meet. Experimental difficulties, however, make precise mass determinations almost impossible; and while a few theoretical attempts have yielded discrete mass values1, the experimental results are so indefinite as to make most comparisons inconclusive. More than fifty different measured masses, ranging from a few times that of the electron to around 25,000, have been reported by various investigators. In fact, there is some doubt as to whether the masses have unique values."

https://openalex.org/W173567898,"IT is well known that encysted amœbae of various species can withstand complete desiccation and so be dispersed to a new environment; but not until recently has this possibility been tested out on Amœba proteus, a species largely used for educational purposes. Since 1916, cultures of Amœba proteus have been maintained in this laboratory. We have now been able to demonstrate that a culture of encysted young Amœba proteus will recover after it has been allowed to dry up completely."
https://openalex.org/W2009319267,"THE properties of ‘Alcomax II’ cooled with and without a magnetic field have been compared by Hoselitz and McCaig1. The improvement in useful properties, which is due to a preferred domain orientation, is explained according to Bozorth2 by the ‘freezing in’ of magnetostrictive stresses. However, magnetic hardening may increase the coercive force by up to 100 oersteds, while the increase due to magnetostrictive stresses should be of the order λσ/Js, where the magnetostriction λ = 2 × 10−5, and the saturation intensity Js = 1,100 C.G.S. units. The stresses σ due to magnetostriction should not exceed λE, and Young's modulus E = 2 × 1012 dynes cm.−2. This gives σ = 4 × 107 dynes cm.−2, and an increase of coercive force of less than 1 oersted."

https://openalex.org/W2047476399,"IN a recent communication, Dr. A. A. Aleem1 has directed attention to a seldom recorded species of phycomycete, Eurychasma Dicksoni (Wright) Magnus, which was found near Plymouth parasitizing Ectocarpus granulosus Agardh. During the spring and summer months of 1945, 1946 and 1947, I observed this fungus on a number of occasions infesting E. granulosus that had colonized test panels suspended in the sea from a raft at Millport, Isle of Cumbrae. These panels were immersed at a constant depth of two feet in a fairly sheltered and fully marine environment."

https://openalex.org/W2111345730,"IN a communication in Nature1, I suggested an explanation for the occurrence of low-level atmospheric ducts over the sea, which had been reported by McPetrie and Starkey2 in conditions of strong winds. It was suggested that the previous history of the air was the governing factor in deciding whether an atmospheric duct would occur. I am indebted to Dr. Starkey for additional information showing the dates of occurrence of various signal strengths in the Cardigan Bay area in strong wind conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2080780256,"NUMEROUS documents and articles have discussed the difficult problem of technological education in Great Britain, and it is remarkable that few contributions have appeared from the technical colleges. Indeed, some statements betray a complete ignorance of what is being done in major colleges of technology. At the conference held in the Royal Society's rooms on March 27 (see Nature, April 22, p. 627), the views of only one principal of a technical college are mentioned, whereas many associated with the universities are quoted. It is this omission that has prompted me to write this letter. In a leading article in Nature of May 13, p. 737, it is stated that “the question of higher technological education lies right outside the field of technical colleges in general, as at present constituted. Their function is essentially the provision of the vastly greater number of technicians which industry also requires; and to equip and staff them essentially for the training of technologists would impede the performance of their primary function.”"
