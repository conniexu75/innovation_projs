https://openalex.org/W1520965071,"The metabolism of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist and vasodilator nifedipine has been reported to exhibit polymorphism among individual humans (Kleinbloesem, C. H., van Brummelen, P., Faber, H., Danhof, M., Vermeulen, N. P. E., and Breimer, D.D. (1984) Biochem. Pharmacol. 33, 3721-3724). Nifedipine oxidation has been shown to be catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 (P-450) enzymes. Reconstitution, immunoinhibition, and induction studies with rat liver indicated that the forms designated P-450UT-A and P-450PCN-E are the major contributors to microsomal nifedipine oxidation. The P-450 which oxidizes nifedipine (P-450NF) was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from several human liver samples. Antibodies raised to P-450NF were highly specific as judged by immunoblotting analysis and inhibited greater than 90% of the nifedipine oxidase activity in human liver microsomes. A monoclonal antibody raised to the human P-450 preparation reacted with both human P-450NF and rat P-450PCN-E. Immunoblotting analysis of 39 human liver microsomal samples using anti-P-450NF antibodies revealed the same 52,000-dalton polypeptide, corresponding to P-450NF, with only one of the microsomal samples showing an additional immunoreactive protein. The level of nifedipine oxidase activity was highly correlated with the amount of P-450NF thus detected using either polyclonal (r = 0.78) or monoclonal (r = 0.65) antibodies, suggesting that the amount of the P-450NF polypeptide may be a major factor in influencing the level of catalytic activity in humans as well as rats. Cytochrome b5 enhanced the catalytic activity of reconstituted P-450NF, and anti-cytochrome b5 inhibited nifedipine oxidase activity in human liver microsomes. P-450NF also appears to be a major contributor to human liver microsomal aldrin epoxidation, d-benzphetamine N-demethylation, 17 beta-estradiol 2- and 4-hydroxylation, and testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylation, the major pathway for oxidation of this androgen in human liver microsomes."

https://openalex.org/W1535479800,"The complete amino acid sequence of the precursor and mature forms of human placental alkaline phosphatase have been inferred from analysis of a cDNA. A near full-length PLAP cDNA (2.8 kilobases) was identified upon screening a bacteriophage lambda gt11 placental cDNA library with antibodies against CNBr fragments of the enzyme. The precursor protein (535 amino acids) displays, after the start codon for translation, a hydrophobic signal peptide of 21 amino acids before the amino-terminal sequence of mature placental alkaline phosphatase. The mature protein is 513 amino acids long. The active site serine has been identified at position 92, as well as two putative glycosylation sites at Asn122 and Asn249 and a highly hydrophobic membrane anchoring domain at the carboxyl terminus of the protein. Significant homology exists between placental alkaline phosphatase and Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase. Placental alkaline phosphatase is the first eukaryotic alkaline phosphatase to be cloned and sequenced."
https://openalex.org/W1525692560,"The primary structure of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) isolated from whole brains of lamprey is pGlu-His-Tyr-Ser-Leu-Glu-Trp-Lys-Pro-Gly-NH2. This unique decapeptide was isolated and purified from brain extracts by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The structure of the peptide was established from chymotryptic fragments that were identified by protein sequence analysis and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The peptide reacts with an antiserum raised against mammalian GnRH and is structurally identified as a member of the GnRH family by the amino and carboxyl termini of pGlu1-His2 and Pro9-Gly10NH2, the conservation of Ser4 in the internal segment of the molecule and its length of 10 amino acids. For the first time, amino acid substitutions are found in positions 3 and 6, critical for biological potency and conformation, respectively. Additionally, a second form of GnRH (lamprey II GnRH), representing about 10% of the total GnRH immunoreactive material in the brain, was isolated; its amino acid composition differs by 3 residues from lamprey I GnRH. Synthetic lamprey I GnRH elevates plasma estradiol in adult female lampreys."

https://openalex.org/W1780093098,"The tRNA ligase protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is one of the components required for splicing of yeast tRNA precursors in vitro. We have purified this protein to near homogeneity using an affinity elution chromatographic step. Purified tRNA ligase is a 90-kDa protein that, in addition to catalyzing the ligation of tRNA half-molecules in the coupled splicing reaction, will also ligate an artificial substrate. Using this artificial substrate, we provide evidence for the existence of a previously predicted activated intermediate in the ligation reaction. The amino acid sequence of the amino-terminal end of the protein was determined, and we have used this information to isolate the structural gene from a library of yeast DNA. We prove that this DNA encodes the tRNA ligase protein by DNA sequencing and by demonstrating overproduction of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1507436219,"The yeast ascospore wall consists of four morphologically distinct layers. The hydrophobic surface layers are biogenically derived from the prospore wall and appear dark after OsO4 staining. They seem to be responsible for the stability of the spores against attack by lytic enzymes. By amino acid analysis of acid hydrolysates of ascospore walls, two new peaks were detected, which were shown to be the racemic and meso form, respectively, of dityrosine. The identity of this hitherto unknown component of the yeast ascospore wall with standard dityrosine was proven by 1H NMR and by mass spectrometry. A 13C NMR spectroscopic investigation of the structure of dityrosine confirmed that, in natural dityrosine, the biphenyl linkage is located ortho, ortho to the hydroxyl groups. Following digestion of the inner layers of isolated ascospore walls it was shown that dityrosine is very probably located only in the surface layers. The same conclusion was reached independently by an investigation of spores of a strain homozygous for the mutation gcn1, which lack the outermost layers of the spore wall and were practically devoid of dityrosine. In sporulating yeast, L-tyrosine was readily incorporated into the dityrosine of the ascospore wall. Control experiments involving vegetative a/alpha cells and nonsporulating alpha/alpha cells under sporulation conditions showed that dityrosine is indeed sporulation-specific."
https://openalex.org/W1968276418,Mutations were introduced at all positions of the internal conserved sequence (ICS) and at three positions in the 5' junction sequence of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae actin intron contained within an actin-thymidine kinase fusion gene. Stage I of splicing is reduced by changes at all these positions. C or A replacement at the fifth nucleotide of the 5' sequence reduces the fidelity of RNA cleavage at the 5' exon-intron junction and results in an accumulation of aberrant lariat intermediate. Stage II of splicing is affected by changes in the first and second residues of the 5' sequence and in the penultimate position of the ICS. An A to G transition at the branch point of the ICS causes a major accumulation of lariat intermediate.
https://openalex.org/W1590555359,"During enzymatic replication of plasmids containing the origin of the Escherichia coli chromosome, oriC, formation of an active initiation complex consisting of dnaA, dnaB, dnaC, and HU proteins, requires a supercoiled DNA template. Relaxed covalently closed plasmids are active only if supercoiled by gyrase prior to initiation; nicked and linear DNAs are inactive. Semi-conservative replication proceeds via delta structure as intermediates. Daughter molecules include nicked intermediates. Daughter molecules include nicked monomers and catenated pairs. Elongation is rapid, but late replicative intermediates accumulate because the final elongation and termination steps are slow. Production of covalently closed circular daughter DNA molecules requires removal of ribonucleotide residues (primers) by DNA polymerase I, assisted by ribonuclease H, gap filling, and ligation of nascent strands by ligase. Reconstitution of a complete cycle of oriC plasmid replication, beginning and ending with supercoiled molecules, has been achieved with purified proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1991811828,"Malaria can be diagnosed either by direct microscopic examination of blood smears, which is time consuming and requires expertise, or by immunological techniques, which are effective but do not distinguish between past and present infections. In this study, a simple procedure was developed for spotting lysed blood from infected patients directly onto nitrocellulose paper and identifying the malaria species on the basis of hybridization of parasite DNA with a species-specific probe. A genomic DNA library of Plasmodium falciparum was screened to detect clones containing DNA sequences that are highly repeated within the parasite genome. Several such clones were further analyzed to identify those that hybridize specifically with P. falciparum DNA but not with DNA from humans, P. vivax, or P. cynomolgi. This technique appears to be sensitive enough to detect 10 picograms of purified P. falciparum DNA (equivalent to 100 parasites) and in field studies is able to detect approximately 40 parasites per microliter of blood."
https://openalex.org/W1532633137,"A protein of Mr 43,000 (43-kDa protein) occurs on the postsynaptic membrane in close association with the acetylcholine receptor and comprises a major part of the postsynaptic cytoskeletal apparatus. We have devised an immunological assay for the 43-kDa protein to determine if it is confined to receptor-specific sites or if it, like general cytoskeletal proteins, has a more widespread tissue distribution. The assay utilizes monoclonal antibodies (Mab) to the 43-kDa protein that recognize two spatially separate epitopes. One Mab, attached to the well of a microtiter plate, binds the antigen which is then available to bind the biotin-derivatized second Mab. Bound second antibody is detected with either avidin-alkaline phosphatase or a more elaborate system using avidin, rabbit anti-avidin, and anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. A similar assay was developed for the receptor. The 43-kDa protein and the receptor are found in electric organ and, in 500-fold lower concentrations, in skeletal muscle but are not detectable in heart, liver, pancreas, or brain. In electric organ, the receptor and the 43-kDa protein are present in approximately equimolar concentrations. These results indicate that the 43-kDa protein is not a general membrane-associated cytoskeletal element and that its occurrence, and possibly also its function, is related to the acetylcholine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2103756455,"The amino acid sequence of Escherichia coli CTP synthetase was derived from the nucleotide sequence of pyrG. The derived amino acid sequence, confirmed at the N terminus by protein sequencing, predicts a subunit of 544 amino acids having a calculated Mr of 60,300 after removal of the initiator methionine. A glutamine amide transfer domain was identified which extends from approximately amino acid residue 300 to the C terminus of the molecule. The CTP synthetase glutamine amide transfer domain contains three conserved regions similar to those in GMP synthetase, anthranilate synthase, p-aminobenzoate synthase, and carbamoyl-P synthetase. The CTP synthetase structure supports a model for gene fusion of a trpG-related glutamine amide transfer domain to a primitive NH3-dependent CTP synthetase. The major 5' end of pyrG mRNA was localized to a position approximately 48 base pairs upstream of the translation initiation codon. Translation of the gene eno, encoding enolase, is initiated 89 base pairs downstream of pyrG. The pyrG-eno junction is characterized by multiple mRNA species which are ascribed to monocistronic pyrG and/or eno mRNAs and a pyrG eno polycistronic mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1593657874,"To better understand the relation between cell calcium and exocytotic secretion, a quantitative dependence of adrenal catecholamine secretion on cytosolic free calcium has been determined for isolated, intact, bovine chromaffin cells, using the fluorescent probe Quin-2. The cells required a threshold of 250-300 nM cytosolic calcium to be reached before detectable secretion occurred and half-maximal secretion occurred near 2 microM cytosolic calcium. Nicotinic receptors mediated an increase of cytosolic calcium from resting levels near 100 nM to levels in the 1-10 microM range within seconds followed by a decay back to resting levels over several minutes. Muscarinic receptors mediated a smaller rise in cytosolic free calcium from 100 to about 200 nM, within seconds. The nicotinic response required extracellular calcium, while the muscarinic response was largely independent of extracellular calcium, suggesting the latter mobilizes intracellular calcium. The acetylcholine-evoked rise in cytosolic calcium decayed by at least two kinetically distinct processes with half-time constants: t1 = 0.6 min and t2 = 3.2 min. Extracellular Na+ deprivation caused a more prolonged elevation of the acetylcholine-evoked calcium transient, suggesting a possible role of Na+/Ca2+ exchange and/or other Na+ -dependent processes in lowering cytosolic calcium following stimulation. The possible perturbing effects of Quin-2 on resting and stimulated cytosolic calcium levels and on secretion were examined and a novel use of Quin-2 to measure membrane calcium flux was demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1520424999,"The neural cell adhesion molecules (N-CAMs) are a group of structurally and immunologically related glycoproteins found in vertebrate neural tissues. Adult brain N-CAMs have apparent molecular weights of 180,000 and 140,000 with an additional form at 120,000 in murine brain. In embryonic brain, N-CAMs are represented by a highly sialylated form with an apparent molecular weight greater than 180,000. We have used monoclonal antibodies that cross-react with N-CAMs of various mammalian species to purify N-CAMs from adult murine and bovine brains and from embryonic murine brains. We determined the amino acid sequences of the amino-terminal domains of these molecules: Leu-Gln-Val-Asp-Ile-Val-Pro-Ser-Gln-Gly-Glu-Ile-Ser-Val-Gly-Glu-Ser. This sequence is highly conserved among all three forms of adult murine brain N-CAM as well as embryonic murine brain N-CAM and adult bovine brain N-CAM. Based on this sequence, we synthesized an undecapeptide and used it to raise a site-directed polyclonal antiserum. This antiserum reacted with the intact N-CAM in liquid phase radioimmunoassays, immunoblotting experiments, and immunofluorescent labeling of cells. The antiserum also reacted with N-CAMs in extracts of brain tissues from different species, confirming the highly conserved nature of the amino-terminal domain of mammalian N-CAMs. Immunofluorescence experiments indicated that this domain resides on the outer surfaces of cells that express N-CAMs, in both primary neuronal cell culture and in cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1577758425,"Escherichia coli is known to actively extrude sodium ions, but little is known concerning the concentration gradient it can develop. We report here simultaneous measurements, by 23Na NMR, of intracellular and extracellular Na+ concentrations of E. coli cells before and after energization. 23Na spectra in the presence of a paramagnetic shift reagent (dysprosium tripolyphosphate) consisted of two resonances, an unshifted one corresponding to intracellular Na+ and a shifted one corresponding to Na+ in the extracellular medium, including the periplasm. Extracellular Na+ was found to be completely visible despite the presence of a broad component in its resonance; intracellular Na+ was only 45% visible. Measurements of Na+ were made under aerobic and glycolytic conditions. Na+ extrusion and maintenance of a stable low intracellular Na+ concentration were found to correlate with the development and maintenance of proton motive force, a result that is consistent with proton-driven Na+/H+ exchange as a means of Na+ transport. In both respiring and glycolyzing cells, at an extracellular Na+ concentration of 100 mM, the intracellular Na+ concentration observed (4 mM) corresponded to an inwardly directed Na+ gradient with a concentration ratio of about 25. The kinetics of Na+ transport suggest that rapid extrusion of Na+ against its electrochemical gradient may be regulated by proton motive force or intracellular pH."
https://openalex.org/W1643297181,"Cross-linking of proteins to DNA in live, intact Novikoff ascites hepatoma cells exposed in vitro to different concentrations of CuSO4, Pb(NO3)2, HgCl2, and AlCl3 was studied. Protein-DNA complexes were separated by high-speed centrifugation of cells solubilized in buffered 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate and assayed by electrophoretic separation of proteins associated with the DNA-containing pellets. Concentration dependence experiments showed that the optimal cross-linking occurred at metal concentration of 0.5 mM for CuSO4, HgCl2, and AlCl3 while the optimal cross-linking for Pb(NO3)2 was at 5 mM. For some metals at concentrations higher than optimal, the amounts of cross-linked proteins decreased significantly. Immunochemical analysis of the cross-linked proteins using antibodies to matrix, chromatin, lamins, and cytokeratin fractions demonstrated that some, but not all, members of these protein families became cross-linked to the DNA. Each metal exhibited a cross-linking pattern of its own, different from those of the other metals. Radioactive labeling experiments showed that all the metals tested became associated with the DNA-protein pellets within 1 h after their addition to the incubation medium. However, hexavalent chromium required more than 2 h before appearing in the DNA-protein pellets in significant amounts."
https://openalex.org/W1644438181,"Structures of glycolipids present in the human embryonal carcinoma cell PA1, were elucidated by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, methylation analysis, and exo- and endoglycosidase digestion. PA1 cells contain globotriaosylceramide, sialosylgangliotriaosylceramide, sialylated and nonsialylated lacto-N-neotetraosylceramide, and the following glycolipids with a blood group type 1 sequence: (formula; see text) The two former glycolipids, lacto-N-tetraosylceramide and sialosyllacto-N-tetraosylceramide, reacted with monoclonal antibodies, K21 and K4, respectively. K21 and K4 antigens are present in many of the human embryonal carcinoma cells but not in a variety of other cell lines, suggesting that sialylated but not fucosylated blood group type 1 sequences are characteristic markers for human embryonal carcinoma cells and malignant teratocarcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W1517869084,"The notion of an insulin-dependent translocation of the glucose transporter in rat adipocytes was confirmed by immunoblotting and reconstitution of glucose transport activity of subcellular fractions. Quantitatively, however, significantly different results were obtained with these two techniques; when compared with reconstitution, immunoblotting detected translocation of a larger amount of the transporter from a low density microsome fraction to a plasma membrane fraction. The acidtropic agents chloroquine and dibucaine, which have been reported to inhibit the recycling of various receptors, were utilized to study the detailed translocation mechanism of the glucose transporter and the insulin receptor. These acidtropic agents caused accumulation of 125I-insulin in a subcellular fraction probably corresponding to lysosomes. They did not, however, significantly affect either the insulin-induced activation of glucose transport or the recycling of the transporter and the insulin receptor as detected by immunoblotting. About 50% of radioactivity released from adipocytes which were allowed to internalize insulin was due to intact insulin, and chloroquine did not change the release rate of intact insulin, raising the possibility of receptor-mediated exocytosis of insulin. The release of degraded insulin decreased with chloroquine treatment. The results are consistent with the idea that these acidtropic agents mainly act to inhibit degradation of insulin in lysosomes, and their effect on the recycling of the glucose transporter and the insulin receptor is minimal, indicating that the recycling of these membrane proteins proceeds irrespective of organelle acidification. Electron micrographs showed vesicles underneath the plasma membranes, with sizes similar to those of the low density microsome fraction where the internalized glucose transporter and the insulin receptor were located."
https://openalex.org/W1604594183,"Polysialoglycoproteins (PSGP) we first isolated from the unfertilized eggs of rainbow trout (Salmo gairderi) and now found to be a ubiquitous component of Salmonidae fish eggs are a novel type of glycoprotein. PSGP from rainbow trout has a molecular weight of 200 X 10(3), a low protein content (about 15% w/w), and a high sialic acid (N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc] content (about 60%, w/w). In any evaluation of the biological functions of PSGP, information about the complete structure of this unique macromolecular component is relevant. We have now completed the determination of the overall structural organization of the 200-kDa PSGP, and this is the first report of the complete structural analysis of this novel class of glycoprotein: (Asp)0-2-Ala-Thr*-Ser*-Glu-(Ala-Ala-Thr*-Gly-Pro-Ser-Gly-Asp-Asp-Ala-Thr *-Ser*- Glu)n-Ala-Ala-Thr*-Gly-Pro-Ser-Gly where * indicates the amino acid residues to which oligo- and/or polysialylglycan units are attached and n = 25. Thus the most outstanding structural features of PSGP isolated from the unfertilized eggs of rainbow trout are now the occurrence of (a) tandem repeats of a tridecapeptide and (b) an alpha-2----8-linked oligo(poly)sialyl group on each of the core oligosaccharide chains, i.e. GalNAc- beta 1----4(NeuGc alpha 2----3)GalNAc beta 1----3Gal beta 1----4Gal beta 1----3[----8NeuGc alpha 2)n----6)GalNAc alpha 1----Ser (or Thr), Fuc alpha 1----3GalNAc beta 1----3Gal beta 1----4Gal beta 1----3[----8NeuGc alpha 2)n ----6)GalNAc alpha 1----Ser (or Thr), GalNAc beta 1----3Gal beta 1----4Gal beta 1----3[----8NeuGc alpha 2)n----6)GalNAc alpha 1----Ser (or Thr), Gal beta 1----4Gal beta 1----3[----8NeuGc alpha 2)n----6)GalNAc alpha 1----Ser (or Thr), and Gal beta 1----3[----8NeuGc alpha 2)n----6) GalNAc alpha 1----Ser (or Thr)."
https://openalex.org/W1585098173,"Renin and angiotensins coexist in various tissues. The mode of control of the extrarenal renin-angiotensin system is not clear. Whether it is renin or angiotensin that is secreted has not been identified. We have investigated gonadotropin-dependent synthesis and subsequent release of the components of the intracellular renin-angiotensin system in a cloned and cultured mouse Leydig tumor cell line (MA-10). Treatment of cultured Leydig cells with bovine luteinizing hormone (bLH, 100 ng/ml) or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, 25 ng/ml) resulted in greater than 150- and 40- fold increased formation of angiotensin I and angiotensin II. In cells incubated with bLH or hCG, the majority of AII (up to 90%) was found in the culture medium while most of angiotensin I (greater than 85%) was in the cell lysate. Treatment with gonadotropic hormones (bLH/ hCG) increased renin 35- to 40-fold. Renin activity was confined mainly in the cell lysate even after the stimulation by gonadotropins, and only 1-2% of the total renin activity was detectable in culture medium. These results were interpreted that, in these transformed cells, hormonally-induced renin functions to generate angiotensin I within the Leydig cell and it is the angiotensins which are secreted."
https://openalex.org/W1516120890,"The fidelity of protein synthesis depends on the rate constants for the reaction of ribosomes with ternary complexes of elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), GTP, and aminoacyl (aa)-tRNA. By measuring the rate constants for the reaction of poly(U)-programmed ribosomes with a binary complex of elongation factor (EF-Tu) and GTP we have shown that two of the key rate constants in the former reaction are determined exclusively by ribosome-EF-Tu interactions and are not affected by the aa-tRNA. These are the rate constant for GTP hydrolysis, which plays an important role in the fidelity of ternary complex selection by the ribosome, and the rate constant for EF-Tu.GDP dissociation from the ribosome, which plays an equally important role in subsequent proofreading of the aa-tRNA. We conclude that the fidelities of ternary complex selection and proofreading are fundamentally dependent on ribosome-EF-Tu interactions. These interactions determine the absolute value of the rate constants for GTP hydrolysis and EF-Tu.GDP dissociation. The ribosome then uses these rate constants as internal standards to measure, respectively, the rate constants for ternary complex and aa-tRNA dissociation from the ribosome. These rates, in turn, are highly dependent on whether the ternary complex and aa-tRNA are cognate or near-cognate to the codon being translated."
https://openalex.org/W1524810984,"Fluid phase endocytosis by monolayers of 3T3-L1 adipocytes has been followed by measuring [14C]sucrose uptake, a well characterized pinocytic marker. Insulin, at a maximal stimulatory concentration, increased the pinocytic rate by 2-fold within 5 min of its addition; this activation persisted for at least 2 h. The dose-response curve for the enhancement of fluid-phase endocytosis by insulin was identical with that for the stimulation of hexose transport, as measured by the uptake of 2-deoxyglucose. The concentration of insulin eliciting half-maximal effects was 6 nM. These results suggest that activation of endocytosis and hexose uptake by insulin are triggered by the same signalling event. Insulin-activated pinocytosis was not dependent upon the increased metabolism of D-glucose that occurs in response to the hormone, since the stimulation of fluid-phase endocytosis occurred in the absence of 5 nM glucose. Fluid-phase exocytosis was examined by loading cells with [14C]sucrose for various times and then measuring tracer efflux. The rate of sucrose release was biphasic; a portion of the internalized sucrose was rapidly released from the cell (t1/2 approximately 5 min), whereas the remainder was released slowly (t1/2 approximately to 5 h). These results are consistent with a sequential two-compartment model in which the [14C] sucrose first enters a compartment from which about 70% of the sucrose is rapidly released back into the medium and the remaining 30% is transferred to a second compartment. Therefore, the true rate of endocytosis is much greater than the observed accumulation rates, except after short uptake times. Insulin increases the rate of sucrose efflux from both compartments as well as the rate of transfer from the first compartment to the second compartment by about 2-fold. Furthermore, insulin increased the apparent size of the first and second compartments by 1.6- and 3-fold, respectively. The lysosomotropic agent chloroquine (200 muM) had only a small effect on fluid movements in these cells. The rapid and prolonged stimulation of fluid-phase endocytosis and exocytosis by insulin are hitherto unrecognized effects of this hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1546303644,"Reduction of [3'-3H, U-14C]UTP with ribonucleotide reductase showed isotope effects of 1.6, 1.8, and 1.8 at pH 6.1, 7.3, and 8.3, respectively. Similar studies with [3'-3H, U-14C]ATP gave effects of 2.1, 2.1, 1.7, and 1.9 at pH 5.5, 6.1, 7.3, and 8.3, respectively. During the course of the isotope effect determinations the samples were analyzed for the production of 3H2O. Reduction of [3'-3H]UTP at pH 6.1, 7.3, and 8.3 resulted in 0.08, 0.15, and 0.24% of the total 3H being volatilized at 50% reaction. Reduction of [3'-3H]ATP gave no detectable 3H2O at pH 6.1 or 7.3 and a maximum of 0.02% at pH 8.3. The isotope effects in conjunction with 3H2O production indicate that ribonucleotide reductase catalyzes cleavage of the 3' carbon-hydrogen bond of NTPs during the reduction to dNTPs. The role of the cofactor, adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), was also investigated. Incubation of [3'-3H]NTP with prereduced ribonucleotide reductase in the absence of reductant (one-turnover conditions) followed by isolation and analysis of AdoCbl for radioactivity indicated no 3H transfer from substrate to cofactor and no 3H2O production. Similar results were obtained in the presence of DTT (multiple turnover conditions). The role of AdoCbl was further investigated by examination of its potential to mediate hydrogen transfer between two substrates. Incubation of [3'-3H]UTP and unlabeled ATP with ribonucleotide reductase and isolation of the products produced indicated no 3H in dATP. These results allow us to postulate a unique role for AdoCbl in the ribonucleotide reductase reaction, that of a radical chain initiator rather than an intermediary hydrogen transfer agent."
https://openalex.org/W1559462600,"A metalloprotease that digests cartilage proteoglycan optimally at pH 5.3 has been purified (4400-fold) to homogeneity from 20-g samples of human articular cartilage containing about 100 micrograms of enzyme. This enzyme was cleanly separated from a related neutral metalloprotease with an optimum pH of 7.2. The acid metalloprotease displays 40% of its maximum activity at pH 7.2 and so has significant activity at physiological pH. The protease is calcium-dependent and indirect evidence suggests that it may contain zinc at its active center. It occurs largely in a latent form that can be activated by aminophenylmercuric acetate. The apparent Mr of the latent form is 55,000 and of the active form, 35,000. The isoelectric point is at pH 4.9. The protease activity is inhibited by chelators, Z-phenylalanine, ovostatin, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase from human articular cartilage. It differs from metalloproteinases such as enkephalinase and kidney brush-border protease in its failure to be strongly inhibited by phosphoramidon and Zincov. It cleaves the proteoglycan monomer of bovine nasal cartilage to fragments of approximately 140,000 Da. It cleaves the B chain of insulin at Ala14-Leu15 and Tyr16-Leu17. A survey of 26 cartilage extracts indicates this enzyme is elevated to about 3 times the normal level in human osteoarthritic cartilage and that the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase is only slightly diminished. Preliminary evidence points to the presence of a similar acid metalloprotease activity in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1530075247,"Escherichia coli strains harboring malE signal sequence point mutations accumulate export-defective precursor maltose-binding protein (MBP) in the cytoplasm. Beginning with these mutants, a number of spontaneous intragenic revertants have been obtained in which export of the MBP to the periplasm is either partially or totally restored. With a single exception, each of the reversion mutations resulted in an increase in the overall hydrophobicity of the signal peptide hydrophobic core by one of five different mechanisms. In some revertants, MBP export was achieved at a rate comparable to the wild type MBP; in other cases, the rate of MBP export was significantly slower than wild type. The results indicate that the overall hydrophobicity of the signal peptide, rather than the absolute length of its uninterrupted hydrophobic core, is a major determinant of MBP export competency. An alteration at residue 19 of the mature MBP also has been identified that provides fairly efficient suppression of the export defect in the adjacent signal peptide, further suggesting that important export information may reside in this region of the precursor protein."
https://openalex.org/W1681039157,"Peroxisomes are massively induced when methylotrophic yeasts are cultured on methanol as the sole carbon and energy source. An analysis of the protein composition of the peroxisomal membrane and the generation of probes against two peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) have been undertaken. Peroxisomes from Candida boidinii were obtained from sucrose gradients as previously described or from a novel one-step purification of the organelle on a Percoll gradient. The protein composition of the membranes from these two preparations was virtually identical. About 10 proteins comprise nearly all of its protein mass. The most prominent proteins have molecular masses of 120, 100, 47, 31-32 (a triplet), and 20 kDa; significant amounts of alcohol oxidase and dihydroxyacetone synthase, the two abundant matrix proteins, also remain associated with the membrane. Glycosylation of the membrane proteins could not be detected. Exposure of the membrane to chaotropes shows that PMPs 100 and 20 are the most easily removable, whereas PMP 47 appears to be the most tightly associated. Mice were injected with peroxisomal membrane, and hybridoma lines were isolated that produced antibody against PMP 20, PMP 47, and dihydroxyacetone synthase. Indirect immunofluorescence with these monoclonal antibodies confirmed that all three proteins are localized to the peroxisomal cluster. Immunoblotting experiments demonstrated that peroxisomal membrane as well as matrix proteins are induced by methanol."
https://openalex.org/W1525290983,"The highly polymorphic HLA-D antigens are associated with a nonpolymorphic polypeptide chain, designated invariant chain. This invariant chain is shown to incorporate fatty acid. Invariant chain metabolically labeled with [3H]palmitic acid releases its label after treatment with hydroxylamine indicating an ester linkage of the palmitic acid. The binding of fatty acid to the invariant chain inhibits the formation of S-S-linked dimers. This suggests that the sole cysteine residue of the invariant chain is blocked by binding of fatty acid. A peptide shared by [3H]palmitic acid- or [35S]cysteine-labeled invariant chain digests supports the hypothesis that the palmitic acid binds to the cysteine which is located close to the membrane-spanning domain on the cytoplasmic site. Inhibition of N-glycosylation with tunicamycin demonstrates binding of the fatty acid to the nonglycosylated precursor of the invariant chain. Additionally, blocking of fatty acylation by cerulenin inhibits further maturation of the invariant chain, as sialylation."
https://openalex.org/W1487644812,"Abstract Ca2+-dependent proteases isolated from chicken gizzard and bovine aortic smooth muscle were compared with respect to subunit autolysis and the role of autolysis in modulating enzyme activity. The protease isolated from chicken gizzard was a heterodimer consisting of 80,000- and 30,000-dalton subunits. The protease isolated under identical conditions from bovine aorta consisted of 75,000- and 30,000-dalton subunits. In the presence of Ca2+, both enzymes underwent autolysis of their 30,000-dalton subunits with conversion to an 18,000-dalton species. In addition, the 80,000-dalton subunit of the gizzard protease was degraded to a 76,000-dalton form. The Ca2+ concentrations required for autolysis of the 30,000-dalton subunits were different for the two enzymes (i.e. gizzard: K0.5 Ca2+ = 335 microM; aortic: K0.5 Ca2+ = 1,250 microM) although in both cases, stimulation of autolysis by Ca2+ exhibited positive cooperativity. When compared with respect to kinetics of substrate degradation, the native forms of the smooth muscle Ca2+-dependent proteases (gizzard, GIIa = 80,000/30,000-dalton heterodimer; bovine aortic, IIa = 75,000/30,000-dalton heterodimer) exhibited a lag phase in product appearance. On the other hand, the autolyzed forms (gizzard, GIIb = 76,000/18,000-dalton heterodimer; bovine aortic, IIb = 75,000/18,000-dalton heterodimer) exhibited linear rates of substrate degradation. These results were analyzed in terms of autolysis of the 30,000-dalton subunits as determined by the conversion of this subunit to its 18,000 dalton form. For both enzymes, the time course for the autolytic transition, 30,000----18,000 daltons, and Ca2+-dependence of the apparent rate constants for this transition were found to correlate well with the lag phase in enzymatic activity. No such correlation could be established for the 80,000----76,000 dalton autolytic transition of the high molecular mass subunit of the gizzard protease. Our results suggest that catalytic activity of the Ca2+-dependent proteases isolated from gizzard and bovine aortic smooth muscle requires autolysis of the 30,000-dalton subunit. The native or unautolyzed forms of these enzymes appear to be proenzymes that can be activated by autolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2068335166,"In Escherichia coli, the small ribosomal subunit has a sedimentation coefficient of 30S, and consists of a 16S RNA molecule of 1541 nucleotides complexed with 21 proteins. Over the last few years, a controversy has emerged regarding the spatial distribution of RNA and protein in the 30S subunit. Contrast variation with neutron scattering was used to suggest that the RNA was located in a central core of the subunit and the proteins mainly in the periphery, with virtually no separation between the centers of mass of protein and RNA. However, these findings are incompatible with the results of efforts to locate individual ribosomal proteins by immune electron microscopy and triangulation with interprotein distance measurements. The conflict between these two views is resolved in this report of small-angle neutron scattering measurements on 30S subunits with and without protein S1, and on subunits reconstituted from deuterated 16S RNA and unlabeled proteins. The results show that (i) the proteins and RNA are intermingled, with neither component dominating at the core or the periphery, and (ii) the spatial distribution of protein and RNA is asymmetrical, with a separation between their centers of mass of about 25 angstroms."
https://openalex.org/W1508672822,"The in vitro transcriptional initiation sites of four yeast mitochondrial tRNA genes have been investigated in a run-off transcription assay. Precise initiation originating within the 9-nucleotide mitochondrial promoter sequence was detected for the phenylalanine, initiator formyl methionine, cysteine, and one of the two threonine tRNA genes. The relative promoter strength of each of these tRNA promoters as well as that for the previously described glutamate tRNA promoter was determined in a competition assay. This assay measured the utilization of a particular tRNA promoter relative to the amount of transcription arising from a control 14 S rRNA promoter present in the same reaction. The competition strength of the tRNAPhe, tRNAMetf, and tRNAGlu promoters is 20-fold greater than that for the tRNAThrACN and tRNACys promoters. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences at the +2 and +3 positions in the transcripts reveals a homology among the strong promoters not duplicated in the weak promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1993725073,"The crossover sites for site-specific C inversion consist of imperfect 12 bp inverted repeats with the dinucleotide TT at the center of symmetry. The phage P1 Cin recombinase acts not only at these cix sites but also less efficiently at cix-related sequences called quasi-cix sites, cixQ. When cixQ contains a central dinucleotide TT, crossover occurs in vivo at the 2 bp sequence TT in the normal and the quasi-cix sites. If cixQ carries only one T residue, inversion-associated localized conversion can occur at the mismatched position within the 2 bp sequence. The results indicate that Cin generates 2 bp staggered cuts in vivo and that reciprocal strand exchanges occur at these 2 bp crossover sequences."

The isozymes were found to be distinct according to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis: the first one to be eluted gave rise to one band, the second to two bands. The isozymes were virtually the same so far as specific activity, KM, inhibition kinetics and irreversible binding properties by the mechanism-based inhibitor (E)-4-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-oxo-3-butenoic acid are concerned. This finding resolves a longstanding controversy concerning the quaternary structure of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1480088420,"Histidine 228 at the active site of Escherichia coli serine hydroxymethyltransferase was replaced with an asparagine. The mutant enzyme was expressed in a strain of E. coli that lacks wild type enzyme. Absorption spectra, circular dichroism spectra, and differential scanning calorimetry thermograms suggest that the amino acid change at the active site causes no detectable change in the tertiary structure of the enzyme. Kinetic studies demonstrated that kcat for the mutant enzyme is about 25% of the value for the wild type enzyme with either L-serine or allothreonine as substrate. Km or Kd values for amino acid substrates and reduced folate compounds were 2-10-fold larger with the mutant enzyme. The rate of interconversion of several enzyme-glycine complexes showed that the conversion of the external aldimine to the quinoid complex is not the rate-determining step for either the mutant or wild type enzyme in the presence of tetrahydrofolate. The binding of L-serine to the wild type enzyme gives a more thermally stable enzyme and increases its affinity for tetrahydrofolate. These effects are not found when L-serine binds to the mutant enzyme. The studies demonstrate that histidine 228 is not a catalytically essential residue and suggest that it is involved in interacting with either the amino acid substrate or the enzyme-bound pyridoxal phosphate."

We have examined the reversal of these changes during the first 3 days of resumption of insulin therapy to rats that had been diabetic for 4 days. Rates of ribosome degradation, which had been elevated in both muscle and heart of the diabetic animals, were suppressed virtually to zero after 1 day of insulin treatment. Synthesis of ribosomes was stimulated, but this change occurred more gradually. Similar, but less dramatic, changes occurred in the rates of synthesis and degradation of total protein in these tissues."

The individual polypeptides of the complex were isolated from sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels and antibodies were raised in rabbits against these polypeptides. After washing of the isolation complex by 0.8 M Tris to release the extrinsic proteins, a distinct diffused protein band was revealed at the position of 33 kDa in SDS gels containing 4 M urea. When this band was electroeluted from the gel and subsequently electrophoresed on SDS gels, three distinct protein bands became apparent. Antibodies raised against each one of these polypeptides cross-reacted with the other two polypeptides to varying degrees but not with the other subunits of the complex. The three polypeptides were denoted as 34, 33, and 32 kDa and the 33 being the herbicide-binding protein. Using the antibodies, the relative amounts of the photosystem II polypeptides were followed during greening of etiolated spinach seedlings. While all three extrinsic polypeptides were present in etiolated leaves at relatively high amounts, the other polypeptides could not be detected prior to an approximate 6-h illumination period. Further illumination induced the appearance of all of the rest of the subunits in a relatively similar rate. The oxygen evolution activity was developed parallel to the increase in the amounts of these polypeptides. Therefore, the assembly of the active photosystem II during greening is a two-step process in contrast with the photosystem I reaction center, which is assembled step by step, and the rest of the chloroplast protein complexes, which are assembled by a concerted mechanism."

Chem. 259, 6659-6666), we prepared rabbit anti-TraJ protein antibodies to analyze for the first time the TraJ protein as it is synthesized in normal F' and Hfr conjugal donor strains. Using affinity-purified antibody, we identified the protein on immuno-overlay blots of whole cell proteins separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In contrast to the TraJ protein synthesized in large quantity by heat-induced lambda (traJ) lysogens, the TraJ protein synthesized in normal donor cells was soluble, even after sedimentation at 100,000 X g. The soluble protein was found with the cytoplasmic fraction after separation of cytoplasmic and periplasmic proteins. Velocity sedimentation analysis indicated an S20,w of 3.5 for the single molecular species composed of or including all the TraJ polypeptide in crude extracts. Quantitative analyses showed that conjugal donor strains normally contain 2000-4000 TraJ monomers/cell. However, that level depended on other plasmid and chromosomal genes."
https://openalex.org/W1601403450,"Cultured rat cells contain five isoforms of tropomyosin (Matsumura, F., Yamashiro-Matsumura, S., and Lin, J.J.-C. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6636-6644). To explore the roles of the multiple tropomyosin isoforms in the microfilament organization of cultured cells, we have examined effects of tropomyosins on the bundling activity of the 55-kDa protein recently purified from HeLa cells (Yamashiro-Matsumura, S., and Matsumura, F. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 5087-5097). Maximum bundling of F-actin was observed at a molar ratio of 55-kDa protein to actin higher than 1:8. None of the isoforms of cultured rat cell tropomyosin significantly altered the F-actin-bundling activity of 55-kDa protein at this ratio, whereas skeletal muscle tropomyosin inhibited the bundling activity to about 50%. Also, cultured cell tropomyosins did not inhibit binding of 55-kDa protein to actin, whereas skeletal muscle tropomyosin inhibited it by 50%. The effect of 55-kDa protein on the binding of tropomyosin to actin varied with the isoform type of tropomyosin. Most (80%) of the tropomyosins with low Mr values (Mr 32,400 or 32,000) were caused to dissociate from actin by 55-kDa protein, but only 20% of tropomyosins with high Mr values (Mr 40,000 or 36,500) was dissociated from actin in these conditions. Immunofluorescence has shown that, while tropomyosin was localized in stress fibers, 55-kDa protein was found in microspikes as well as stress fibers, both of which are known to contain bundles of microfilaments. Therefore, we suggest that 55-kDa protein together with the multiple tropomyosin isoforms may regulate the formation of two types of actin-filament bundles, bundles containing tropomyosin and those without tropomyosin."
https://openalex.org/W1513847907,"The molecular events of start, the regulatory step that commits yeast cells to DNA replication, have recently begun to be investigated. One of the gene products required for completion of start has been found to have a significant structural homology with oncogenes endowed with protein kinase activity. Our experiments provide data on the biosynthetic pathway of a previously identified labile protein (p100, molecular weight 100,000, isoelectric point of approximately 4.8-5) involved in cell cycle progression at start, which appears to be specifically made during the release from cell cycle arrest of a temperature-sensitive mutant (cdc25) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. On two-dimensional gel, p100 migrates very close to another 100-kDa labile protein (p100*) which behaves as a cell cycle modulated protein with reduced synthesis in G1. Pulse and chase labeling of protein with [35S]methionine suggests that both p100 and p100* are processed to a protein (p115) of slightly higher molecular weight (Mr = 115,000). Peptide mapping analysis indicates that p100 and p100 yield identical maps and that both p100 and p100* are very much similar to p115. p115 is a glycosylated protein as shown by a labeling experiment with [3H]glucosamine and by the fact that the synthesis of both p100 and p115 is inhibited if cells are cultured in the presence of tunicamycin. A protein having the same heterogeneous aspect of migration on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and the same apparent molecular weight and isoelectric point of p115 is abundantly present in a preparation of membranes from S. cerevisiae and the isolated radioactive p115 comigrates with it. Taken together these results favor the idea that terminal glycosylation of both p100 and p100* gives rise to the fully glycosylated p115 protein which appears to be a membrane-associated protein."
https://openalex.org/W1557352560,"Guanosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) is a good analog of GTP in the reactions leading to the formation of a peptide bond in protein biosynthesis. It forms binary and ternary complexes with elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), and with EF-Tu and aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA). In addition, it stimulates aa-tRNA binding to ribosomes. Although GTP gamma S hydrolysis is more than three orders of magnitude slower than GTP hydrolysis, both reactions are dependent on the formation of a noncovalent complex (RS X TC) between mRNA-programmed ribosomes and ternary complex, and the complexes resulting from that hydrolysis are intermediates in peptide formation. The rate of dissociation of the ribosome X EF-Tu X GTP gamma S X aa-tRNA complex was determined from the rate of labeled peptide formation in the presence of an unlabeled ternary complex chase. This rate (2.2 X 10(-3) s-1) is similar to that determined previously (Thompson, R.C., and Karim, A.M. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 4922-4926) from the progress of GTP gamma S hydrolysis. The effects of temperature and polycation concentration on this rate constant and that for GTP gamma S hydrolysis are reported. The rate constants measured are consistent with a kinetic rather than thermodynamic limit on the accuracy of the aa-tRNA selection in vivo."

Pretreatment of melanoma cells at 37 degrees C for 15 min with increasing doses of DEC followed by a 60-min pulse with [35S]sulfate in the presence of DEC resulted in a dose-related inhibition of incorporation of [35S]sulfate into macromolecules. In cells incubated for 75 min with both 1 mM beta-D-xyloside and 15 mM DEC, synthesis and secretion of beta-D-xyloside-bound 35S-glycosaminoglycans were inhibited by more than 80% as compared to cells treated with beta-D-xyloside alone; this inhibition was reversible. As assessed by [3H]serine incorporation into protein, overall protein synthesis was not substantially inhibited by DEC treatment. Detergent lysates from [35S]methionine-labeled melanoma cells were incubated with a monoclonal antibody (9.2.27) that specifically recognizes the peptide core of the melanoma proteoglycan. As assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitate, a 240,000 Mr endoglycosidase H (Endo-H)-sensitive intermediate was the only form of the proteoglycan present inside the cells when the cultures were treated for 60-120 min with 10-15 mM DEC. When the melanoma cells were incubated for 10 min with 15 mM DEC and 100 mu Ci/ml of [35S]methionine, washed, and then chased for 15 min to 4 h in radioactive-free medium, the 240,000 Mr Endo-H-sensitive intermediate was slowly converted to a 250,000 Endo-H-resistant intermediate but not to a mature proteoglycan molecule that possessed chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans. SDS-PAGE analysis of cell surface immunoprecipitates revealed that only a small amount of the 250,000 Mr intermediate was transported to the plasma membrane within 5 h of incubation in the presence of DEC. Proteoglycan synthesis was also inhibited when the melanoma cells were incubated for 60-120 min with ammonium chloride, but unlike DEC-treated cells the majority of the synthesized peptide core was converted to a 245,000 Mr Endo-H-resistant intermediate that was detected on the cell surface. Light and electron microscopic analysis of DEC-treated melanoma cells revealed large vacuoles and a distended Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum. Ammonium chloride-treated cells contained fewer vacuoles than DEC-treated cells but more vacuoles than normal cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W183872596,"Membrane transport of long chain fatty acids in the isolated rat adipocyte can be strongly stimulated by epinephrine (Abumrad, N. A., Perry, P. R., and Whitesell, R. R. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 9969-9971). We now report that insulin at physiological concentrations can completely block or reverse the epinephrine effect. Insulin was optimally effective at a concentration of about 0.1 nM in inhibiting transport activation by 0.3 and 3 microM epinephrine (0.1 and 1.0 microgram/ml). High concentrations of insulin (above 1 nM) were generally less effective and this was particularly true at the highest dose of epinephrine (1.0 microgram/ml). The insulin effect was shown to be on the transport process since insulin inhibited epinephrine activation of transport in both directions (influx and efflux). No effect of insulin on basal transport was observed over a wide range of concentrations (0.01-10 nM). Insulin's antagonism of transport activation by epinephrine appeared dependent on ATP metabolism since it was abolished by preincubating the cells with dinitrophenol (1 mM). Dinitrophenol, however, could not reverse the insulin effect when exposure to the hormone preceded that to dinitrophenol, consistent with an action of insulin at the transport step. The data indicate that regulation of the membrane transport of fatty acids is a potential site for insulin's action to suppress lipid mobilization."
https://openalex.org/W1583492886,"Progesterone receptor from the chicken oviduct has been shown to exist as two 8 S forms (I and II). Form I contains a protein of Mr = 75,000 and form II contains a protein of Mr = 110,000. In addition to these hormone-binding proteins, both receptor forms contain a protein with Mr = 90,000 that does not bind steroid. To investigate the possibility that these proteins are structurally related, they were isolated by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and subjected to peptide mapping analyses after digestion with Staphylococcus aureus V-8 protease, papain, or alpha-chymotrypsin. Receptor proteins labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in tissue minces were also subjected to peptide mapping analysis. The electrophoretic patterns of peptide fragments of the 90-kDa protein from receptor forms I and II were identical but were different from the peptide patterns obtained from the 75- and 110-kDa proteins which generated similar peptide patterns, indicating that these are structurally related. However, some differences were evident, indicating that these latter two proteins are not identical substrates for proteases. A one-dimensional comparison of the phosphopeptide patterns from the 75- and 110-kDa proteins also showed them to be similar, but not identical. Two-dimensional maps of phosphopeptides generated from the 75- and 110-kDa protein after complete tryptic digestion revealed multiple sites of phosphorylation which were identical except for one phosphopeptide that was unique to the 110-kDa protein. These results show the two progesterone-binding proteins to be very similar in structure, but to differ considerably from the 90-kDa protein."

https://openalex.org/W1549758737,"Abstract Structural and immunochemical studies of glycophorins isolated from erythrocytes of an individual homozygous for the M Sta blood group phenotype are described. Reactivities with specific monoclonal antibodies indicated that two major M and N glycophorins were present. The M and N Sta glycophorins were resolved by Lens culinaris lectin affinity chromatography. The N species was not held on the lectin but the M species, like control alpha glycophorins, was retained and could be eluted with alpha-methylmannoside. The two proteins were present in almost equimolar amounts. Studies of the CNBr fragments provided evidence that the structure of M Sta glycophorin is the same as that of the usual M alpha glycophorin but that the N Sta glycophorin is a variant. The amino-terminal octapeptides of the M and N species were similar in amino acid and carbohydrate composition to those isolated, respectively, from M and N alpha glycophorins. The studies focused on CNBr glycopeptide B that, in control alpha glycophorins, extends from amino acid residues 9 to 81. The fragment from the M species exhibited properties identical to those of the corresponding fragment of control alpha glycophorins in terms of size, chromatographic behavior, amino acid and carbohydrate contents and compositions, the presence of O-glycosidically linked saccharides and a single Asn-linked carbohydrate unit. The structures of the O-linked units were inferred experimentally to be NeuAc(alpha 2,3)Gal-(beta 1,3)GalNAc and NeuAc(alpha 2,3)Gal(beta 1,3) [NeuAc(alpha 2,6)]GalNAc, present in a ratio similar to that found in controls; and the Asn-linked unit also appeared to be as in the control. The tryptic glycopeptide pattern of the M Sta glycophorin CNBr fragment B was identical to the pattern of the corresponding control fragment, and the composition of the tryptic peptides suggested sequence identity with the control fragment. In contrast, the N Sta glycophorin yielded two CNBr glycopeptides B; both contained fewer amino acid residues and virtually lacked Man and GlcNAc, indicating the absence of the Asn-linked carbohydrate. The much decreased levels of these carbohydrates in the intact N protein, corroborated the latter finding. The O-glycosidic saccharides appeared similar to those found in control alpha glycophorins. However, the tryptic glycopeptide pattern of the variant differed from control M or N alpha glycophorins, suggesting a deletion of a large segment of the molecule near residues 40-61 and/or a substitution of methionine for a residue upstream from residue 40.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W102940565,"A largely inactive derivative of the catalytic subunit of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase containing trinitrophenyl groups on lysine 83 and 84 was used to study communication between polypeptide chains in the holoenzyme and the isolated catalytic trimers. Addition of native regulatory dimers to the derivative yielded a holoenzyme-like complex of low activity which exhibited sigmoidal kinetics and was inhibited by CTP and activated by ATP. The binding of CTP and ATP to the regulatory subunits caused significant and opposite changes in the absorption spectrum resulting from changes in the environment of the sensitive chromophores at the active sites. In allosteric hybrid molecules containing one native and one trinitrophenylated catalytic subunit, along with native regulatory subunits, the binding of a bisubstrate analog, N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate, to the native catalytic subunit resulted in a perturbation of the spectrum of the chromophore on the unliganded modified chains. Thus the conformational changes associated with the allosteric transition responsible for both heterotropic and homotropic effects are propagated from the sites of ligand binding to the active sites of unliganded distant chains. In addition to the communication from regulatory chains to catalytic chains and the cross-talk from one catalytic subunit to the other, communication between individual catalytic chains in isolated trimers was also demonstrated. By constructing hybrid trimers containing one trinitrophenylated chain and two native chains, we could detect a change in the environment of the chromophore upon the binding of the bisubstrate analog to the native chains."

The two polymerase enzymes displayed differential responses to the addition of SSB. T7 DNA polymerase, a enzyme required for the replication of the T7 chromosome, was stimulated by the addition of SSB whether native or modified templates were used. On the other hand, E. coli DNA polymerase I was slightly stimulated by the addition of SSB to the native template but substantially inhibited on modified templates. This result suggests that DNA polymerase I may be able to synthesize past an aminofluorene adduct but that the presence of SSB inhibited this trans-lesion synthesis. Polyacrylamide gels of the products of DNA synthesis by polymerase I supported this inference since SSB caused a substantial increase in the accumulation of shorter DNA chains induced by blockage at the aminofluorene adduct sites."

https://openalex.org/W1607701597,"A new method was developed to follow the rate of activation of adenylate cyclase in rat brain membranes by rapid freezing and N-ethylmaleimide treatment at 0 degrees C. This method was used to investigate the relationship between the rate of activation of adenylate cyclase by p(NH)ppG and GTP gamma S and their apparent affinities. These studies established the following. 1) The kinetics of activation by p(NH)ppG and GTP gamma S were indistinguishable although the apparent affinity of p(NH)ppG was 20-fold lower than the affinity of GTP gamma S. Activation was first order, kobs varying approximately 1.5-fold (average t 1/2 = 3.5 min, 30 degrees C) between 20-90% occupancy by either guanine nucleotide. 2) Final levels of activity were strictly dependent on the concentration of the nucleotides in a saturable manner. 3) Mg2+ increased the apparent affinity of either guanine nucleotide by 10-20-fold between 0.1 microM and 3 mM free Mg2+ in the presence of 2 mM EDTA but did not enhance the rate or maximal extent of activation. 4) The effects of Mg2+ were expressed through two independent classes of sites with affinities in the nanomolar and micromolar range. 5) A Mg2+ X guanine nucleotide complex was not the substrate for activation. The affinity of Mg2+ for nucleotides was determined as 6.25 mM GTP gamma S, 0.930 mM GTP, 0.156 mM p(NH)ppG. 6) Full activation by p(NH)ppG was completely reversible but activation by GTP gamma S was only partially reversible. These results suggest that: activation of adenylate cyclase in native membranes does not require Mg2+ or irreversible binding of the guanine nucleotide and there are two independent pathways for formation of active adenylate cyclase. A minimal mechanism for activation is discussed in light of current models."
