It has been observed by Longenecker and associates1 that this synthesis can be greatly stimulated, resulting in the high urinary excretion of the vitamin, when the rats are given daily a variety of compounds, particularly narcotics. In view of the great variation in the nature and constitution of the effective compounds, these authors are inclined to the view that these substances act as promoters rather than precursors for the synthesis of the vitamin. They were not able to suggest, however, any probable mechanism for this biosynthesis of vitamin C by narcotized rats."

The infection of the larvæ was obtained in a concrete trough after the resting sporangia had lain dormant for more than eight months. This note is supplementary to a paper by me published recently1, and the species of the fungus is that referred to as type a in the paper."

https://openalex.org/W2038052612,"IT is frequently found that in two-phase disperse insecticidal systems in which the toxic compound constitutes part or whole of the disperse phase, toxicity bears an inverse relation to the particle size of the disperse phase. Recent work here has shown, however, that in the case of aqueous suspensions of pure p,p'-D.D.T. [1-trichloro 2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane], this relationship is reversed."
https://openalex.org/W2090409148,"REPEATED plasma volume determinations on liberated Indian prisoners-of-war suffering from extreme protein insufficiency have shown that the constituents of the total circulating volume return to normal in a definite sequence. These patients had, at the time they were first studied, a normochromic macrocytic anaemia, a reduced body weight, a reduced serum total protein concentration, confined almost entirely to the albumin fraction, and hence a reduction in the albumin/globulin ratio, a slightly reduced plasma volume and, because of the low haematocrit, a significantly reduced blood volume. There was, therefore, a great reduction in the total circulating haemoglobin and total circulating plasma protein. When the patients were given a diet rich in calories, proteins and vitamins, the above factors returned to normal according to a definite pattern. For the sake of ease of description, the recovery process has been divided into three stages. These are purely arbitrary, and may show considerable variation in their time relations."

These confirmations cover thermal stability, pH at which optimum activity is apparent, stability in solutions on storage, and methods of inactivation; but we have obtained results which suggest that the effect of glucose, to which attention has been directed, may be more complex than has hitherto been thought."

https://openalex.org/W4256221863,"THE fact that substances which fluoresce show a âatigueâ or âfadingâ when exposed continuously to the radiation causing fluorescence has been noted sporadically. Beese and Marden1 investigated the âfatigueâ of several substances, mostly solids, and found that with intense radiation equilibrium was attained in about ten minutes, and that complete recovery was attained in the dark."

https://openalex.org/W2161761497,"ACCORDING to the measurements of v.d. Velden1, the efficiency of the human retina is sometimes nearly 1 ; every quantum of light that reaches the retina is absorbed. Then it elicits a response of the sense cells2,3. An efficiency of 1 would mean that the density of the visual purple is large enough to cause a difference between the sensitivity curve of the dark-adapted eye and the absorption curve of visual purple; so long as a small amount of visual purple is present, the amount of light absorbed at various wave-lengths is proportional to the absorption coefficient. As soon as the density of visual purple is large enough, the absorption at the maximum (505 mÂµ) becomes relatively smaller. In the extreme case of very high density, the absorption is 100 per cent in a broad region of the spectrum, irrespective of the wave-length, and the maximum at 505 mÂµ is flattened out."

The alleged enzyme has been named choline acetylase. The authors used the m. rectus abdominis of frogs to test the quantity of synthetized acetylcholine."

Willcox1, when referring to other tropical conditions, he says : “Hydrocœlcs“les are very common in the African though considering the amount of gonorrhœa it is not surprising”. According to him, lymphogranuloma venereum (inguinale) is also very common among these natives."

In Primula and in flax, homostylic flowers were said to be morphologically aberrant but functional with increased self-fertility."

https://openalex.org/W2028150065,"DR. T. K. WITH'S suggestion1 that carotenoids, such as cryptoxanthin and β-carotene, are vitamins in their own right commands considerable sympathy, but we do not think, that the data advanced in that communication settle the point. The efficiency of utilization and the storage of vitamin A in the liver of the rat and the chick are affected by many factors which control the growth response or quantity found. These include the amount and kind of vitamin A fed2, the amount of sparing agents, more particularly the tocopherols fed at the same time3, and the idiosyncrasies of the animal4, which is another way of saying that we do not yet know the complete physiology of vitamin utilization and liver storage."
https://openalex.org/W2038457907,"DEFICIENCY of vitamin B1 is associated with increase of the bisulphite-binding substances1,2, The increase is chiefly due to pyruvic acid and alpha-ketoglutaric acid. As the bisulphite-binding aldehydeand keto-compounds increase in many different diseases, it is rather difficult to decide whether this augmentation can be used as an indicator of aneurin deficiency. The various authors disagree on this point3. Wilson4 and others recommend the examination of the increase after administration of glucose. Chesler et al.5 are of the opinion that the ratio of lactic and pyruvic acid is the decisive factor, the ratio being normally 7.7 average and 5.8–6.6 with aneurin-deficiency."
