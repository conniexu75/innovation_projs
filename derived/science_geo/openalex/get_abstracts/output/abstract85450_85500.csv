https://openalex.org/W2004351423,"Arachidonic acid plays a central role in a biological control system where such oxygenated derivatives as prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes are mediators. The leukotrienes are formed by transformation of arachidonic acid into an unstable epoxide intermediate, leukotriene A4, which can be converted enzymatically by hydration to leukotriene B4, and by addition of glutathione to leukotriene C4. This last compound is metabolized to leukotrienes D4 and E4 by successive elimination of a γ-glutamyl residue and glycine. Slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis consists of leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4. The cysteinyl-containing leukotrienes are potent bronchoconstrictors, increase vascular permeability in postcapillary venules, and stimulate mucus secretion. Leukotriene B4 causes adhesion and chemotactic movement of leukocytes and stimulates aggregation, enzyme release, and generation of superoxide in neutrophils. Leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4, which are released from the lung tissue of asthmatic subjects exposed to specific allergens, seem to play a pathophysiological role in immediate hypersensitivity reactions. These leukotrienes, as well as leukotriene B4, have pro-inflammatory effects."

The syndrome was preventable with atropine. The physostigmine doses and concentrations of blood lithium that caused the syndrome are similar to those considered appropriate for psychiatric chemotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W2064037258,"The paramagnetism of cigarette tar is found to be associated with at least four different types of species. One of the types is responsible for over 80 percent of the total paramagnetism and has a signal intensity that is independent of temperature from 60 to 250 K. This non-Curie-Weiss temperature dependence indicates that the principal paramagnetic species in tar is not an organic monoradical (doublet) species but instead is a donor-acceptor excimer with a paramagnetic excited state and a diamagnetic ground state. Modeling experiments suggest that the excimer consists of quinone (Q) and hydroquinone (QH2) molecules held in a tar matrix. Since such Q-QH2 species are catalysts for the oxidation of hydrocarbons and are very active redox systems, this paramagnetic species may be implicated in the cocarcinogenic properties of tar. Alternatively, since semiquinone radicals are known to bind to DNA, the tar paramagnetic species may be directly involved in the carcinogenic properties of tar."
https://openalex.org/W1990219126,"The functional organization of the second cortical visual area was examined with three different anatomical markers: 2-[14C]deoxy-D-glucose, cytochrome oxidase, and various myelin stains. All three markers revealed strips running throughout the area, parallel to the cortical surface. The boundaries of these strips provide an anatomical criterion for defining the borders of this extrastriate region. Further, the demonstration of these strips allows a functional and anatomical analysis of modules in the area, just as the recent demonstration of spots in the primary visual cortex has allowed an analysis of modules there. The strips differ structurally and functionally from interstrip regions and these differences are similar to those seen between the spots and the interspot regions in the primary visual cortex. In the macaque the strips and spots differ with regard to binocular organization."
https://openalex.org/W2057821084,"Previous work has suggested that potential information in DNA secondary structure might be used by cells to define DNAase I- and S1-sensitive chromatin structures associated with promoter and terminator regions. To test this hypothesis, supercoiled pBR322 was cotransfected into L cells. For the majority of transfected clones supercoil-induced S1-sensitive sites in pure pBR322 DNA are also S1-sensitive in L-cell nuclei. These results suggest that the potential of certain DNA sequences to form specific secondary structures in chromatin can be a dominant characteristic. A recombinant chicken βA-lobin supercoiled plasmid was reconstituted in vitro with histones. The reconstituted chromatin also retained the ability to form S1-sensitive sites. Evidence suggests that DNA sequences capable of forming S1-sensitive sites in supercoiled plasmids may bind nucleosomes poorly after reconstitution with histones."
https://openalex.org/W2103043356,"Cloned DNA sequences encoding yeast alcohol dehydrogenase and a bacterial neomycin phosphotransferase have been inserted into the T-DNA of Agrobacterium tumefaciens plasmid pTiT37 at the ""rooty"" locus. Transformation of tobacco stem segments with the engineered bacterial strains produced attenuated crown gall tumors that were capable of regeneration into intact, normal tobacco plants. The yeast gene and entire transferred DNA (T-DNA) were present in the regenerated plants in multiple copies, and nopaline was found in all tissues. The plants were fertile, and seedlings resulting from self-pollination also contained intact and multiple copies of the engineered T-DNA. Expression of nopaline in the germinated seedlings derived from one regenerated plant was variable and did not correlate with the levels of T-DNA present in the seedlings. Preliminary evidence indicates that nopaline in progeny of other similarly engineered plants is more uniform. The disarming of pTiT37 by insertions at the ""rooty"" locus thus appears to produce a useful gene vector for higher plants."
https://openalex.org/W2079738554,"Prespore and prestalk cells in Dictyostelium discoideum aggregates can be separated by density gradient centrifugation. Using poly(A+) RNA from the fractionated cells to probe a cDNA library of mRNAs from postaggregation cells, we were able to identify six cDNA clones representing RNAs enriched in prespore or prestalk cells. Remarkably, transcripts of six of seven cDNA clones, previously selected to encode mRNAs present in postaggregating cells but low or absent in growing cells, also are enriched in RNA from either prestalk or prespore cells. By hybridization of cDNA probes to nitrocellulose blots of formaldehyde RNA gels, these 13 mRNA species have been examined with respect to cell type specificity, temporal pattern of accumulation, and affect of disaggregation and cAMP on accumulation. Aggregation-stage mRNAs tend to fit into three different classes. All prespore mRNAs are similar in all aspects of their regulation, while prestalk mRNAs fall into two co-regulated classes. All mRNAs that are present at significant levels during growth and differentiation are found in both cell types at comparable levels. Our results indicate that there is coordinate control of expression of genes specific for the two principal cell types."

https://openalex.org/W1547009252,"The HIS1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes ATP phosphoribosyltransferase, the first enzyme in the pathway of histidine biosynthesis. We have cloned this gene by complementation of a his1 auxotroph. The HIS1 coding region was localized within the cloned segment by assay of subcloned fragments for their ability to complement a his1 auxotroph. We determined the DNA sequence of the HIS1 region defined by this complementation test. S1 nuclease and exonuclease VII mapping of the 5' and 3' termini of HIS1 mRNA reveal considerable heterogeneity at both ends of the transcript, especially the 5' end which displays 13 different termini that span a 110-base pair region. Northern analysis shows that derepression of HIS1 enzyme activity under conditions of amino acid deprivation can be accounted for by an increase in the steady state level of HIS1 mRNA. There are no large differences between the relative levels of HIS1 mRNA molecules with different 5' termini in repressed and derepressed cells. In the DNA sequence upstream from the 5' termini of HIS1 mRNA we have found four closely related copies of a 9-base pair sequence. This sequence is also repeated in the 5' noncoding regions of HIS4, HIS3, and TRP5. Closely related sequences are not found flanking a number of other yeast genes, suggesting that the repeated sequence plays a role in the regulation of amino acid biosynthetic genes subject to the general amino acid control."

https://openalex.org/W1575543696,"A recombinant clone, which covers the pepsinogen gene in a single insert, has been isolated by screening a library of human genomic DNA, using a swine pepsinogen cDNA as a probe. Sequence analysis of coding DNA segments of the clone revealed that the pepsinogen gene occupies approximately 9.4-kilobase pairs of the genomic DNA and is separated into nine exons by eight introns of various lengths. The predicted amino acid sequence of human pepsinogen consists of 373 residues and is 82% homologous with that of swine pepsinogen. In addition, the predicted sequence contained a single sequence of 15 amino acid residues at the NH2 terminus, showing that the protein is synthesized as prepepsinogen. The structure of the gene, in which two homologous sequences including the two active site aspartyl residues of pepsin are present in different coding segments, is in support of the view that the pepsinogen gene evolved by duplication of a shorter ancestral gene."
https://openalex.org/W1965866966,"Up to thirteen T-DNA-encoded, polyadenylated transcripts of different relative abundance were detected by Northern blot hybridization in the tobacco nopaline BT37 crown gall teratoma tissue. Their sizes range from 900 to 2,700 bases. The polarity of eight of the thirteen transcripts was assigned by hybridization of labeled RNA to single-stranded DNA fragments of the T-region obtained by cloning in an M13 vector. Both strands of the T-DNA are transcribed. Our data indicate that most, if not all, transcripts are generated via independent promoter and poly(A)-addition sites on the T-DNA. Comparison of T-DNA-encoded transcripts present in crown gall tumors showing teratoma-like growth (BT37) with those from an unorganized tumor line (W38C58) reveals that this difference in phenotype is accompanied by a difference in the expression of the T-DNA. T-DNA sequences common to both octopine and nopaline tumors encode at least five, and probably six, cross-hybridizing transcripts of the same size, location, polarity and function. These transcripts are involved in the process of plant tumor formation and maintenance."

https://openalex.org/W2055704051,"Deletion and substitution mutations in the control region of simian virus 40 (SV40) were used to study regulation of early transcription by T antigen. A mutant, pIN4, containing substitutions within T antigen binding site II, is transcribed in a cell-free extract at wild-type efficiency but is unable to be repressed in vitro by purified T antigen under conditions that fully repress wild-type transcription. These results suggest a functional role for T antigen binding site II in the repression of early SV40 transcription. To investigate autoregulation in vivo, transcription from the SV40 early promoter was quantitated in COS7 monkey cells transfected with plasmid vectors carrying the mouse dihydrofolate reductase gene (SV-dhfr vectors). Mutant SV-dhfr vectors lacking T antigen site I or site II sequences overproduce dhfr RNA from the SV40 early promoter three to four fold, whereas deletion of both sites I and II or the presence of a temperature-sensitive T antigen (tsA209) results in an eight to ten fold increase in dhfr RNA. Our results indicate that binding of T antigen to both sites I and II plays a role in autoregulation."
https://openalex.org/W2056229244,DNA-mediated gene transfer (transfection) is used to introduce specific genes into vertebrate cells. Events soon after transfection were quantitatively analyzed by determining the infectivity of the DNA from an avian retrovirus and of mixtures of subgenomic fragments of this DNA. The limiting step of transfection with two DNA molecules is the uptake by a single cell of both DNA's in a biologically active state. Transfected cells mediate ligation and recombination of physically unlinked DNA's at nearly 100 percent efficiency.
https://openalex.org/W1674312737,"The mechanism of isoproterenol and N6,O2-dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (dibutyryl cAMP) induction of lactate dehydrogenase A subunit mRNA (mRNALDH) was investigated in the rat C6 glioma cell line. During the induction phase the concentration of nuclear mRNALDH sequences increased about 2.5-fold 4 h after the addition of isoproterenol or dibutyryl cAMP. Analysis of nuclear 32P-labeled mRNALDH sequences showed that isoproterenol or dibutyryl cAMP increased the basal rate of in vitro mRNALDH transcription about 3.6-fold within 4 h. The relative rates of in vivo mRNALDH synthesis were additionally measured by pulse-labeling of glioma cells for 15 min with [3H]uridine. The induction of mRNALDH in intact glioma cells by isoproterenol and dibutyryl cAMP was quantitatively comparable to that observed in isolated nuclei and the relative rate of [3H]uridine incorporation into mRNALDH was maximal 4 to 5 h after the initial induction stimulus. Increased synthesis of mRNALDH in vivo as well as in isolated nuclei occurred only at isoproterenol concentrations that caused elevated levels of glioma cell cAMP. Analysis of the kinetics of decay of [3H]uridine-labeled mRNALDH showed a linear rate of decay of non-induced mRNALDH with a t1/2 of 45 min. After isoproterenol stimulation mRNALDH decayed as two populations, one with a t1/2 of 50 min and the other one with a t1/2 of 2.5 h. These results indicate that both isoproterenol and dibutyrl cAMP regulate not only the rate of transcription of mRNALDH but that the stability of mRNALDH is increased during the induction phase."
https://openalex.org/W1981504177,"Mice infected with reovirus type 1 develop an autoimmune polyendocrine disease. Spleen cells from these mice were fused with myeloma cells and the culture fluids were screened by indirect immunofluorescence for autoantibodies reactive with normal mouse tissues. A large panel of cloned, stable antibody-producing hybridomas has been obtained. Fourteen of the hybridomas make autoantibodies that react with cells in the islets of Langerhans, 24 with cells in the anterior pituitary, 11 with cells in gastric mucosa, and 5 with nuclei. Except for the antibodies to nuclei, the monoclonal autoantibodies are organ-specific. Some, however, show broad cross-species reactivity, recognizing similar antigenic determinants in mouse, rat, pig, and human organs, whereas other recognize determinants only in rodent tissues. Several of the antigens recognized by these monoclonal autoantibodies have been identified as hormones (for example, glucagon, growth hormone, and insulin)."
https://openalex.org/W1978260601,"Recognition sites for the uptake of norepinephrine on adrenergic neurons in the brain and periphery were labeled with [3H]desipramine. The number of these uptake sites varied with the concentration of transmitter; depletion of norepinephrine with reserpine reduced the number of uptake sites, whereas increasing the concentration of norepinephrine induced by treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors raised the number of binding sites. These dynamic alterations in norepinephrine uptake recognition sites may regulate synaptic function homeostatically, providing less inactivation of reuptake when the synaptic concentration of the transmitter is low and increased inactivation when it is high."

https://openalex.org/W2152462912,"We show that, contrary to expectations, restriction enzyme cleavage of chicken erythrocyte nucleosome core particle DNA generates a series of distinct subnucleosome fragments. These fragments do not result from bulk nucleosome phasing in vivo, but arise from micrococcal nuclease cleavages internal to the core particle, at roughly 10-base pair intervals and at AT-rich sequences. Those 145-base pair DNA fragments remaining intact are a biased population in which the guanine content can fluctuate by as much as 10%, with a 10-base pair period. We suggest that these same considerations, when applied to a unique DNA sequence, are the true explanation for several previous claims for nucleosome phasing."

When injected intracerebrally into mice these variants infected a subset of the brain neurons that were infected by the parental virus. When injected intraperitoneally, the variants did not spread to the brain. These results indicate that minor modifications of the reovirus hemagglutinin dramatically alter the ability of the virus to spread into and injure the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2010796095,"With hemodialysis patients, a high serum ferritin before there was serological evidence of hepatitis B virus infection increased the likelihood that the infection would be persistent. This finding suggested that hepatitis B virus is likely to infect and actively replicate in liver cells with the propensity for increased ferritin synthesis. The virus itself could stimulate the synthesis of ferritin in a cyclic positive feedback mechanism that increases intracellular ferritin concentration and, eventually, intracellular iron. Transformed liver cells have low iron content, do not replicate hepatitis B virus, and require iron for growth. Infected, nonmalignant liver cells could supply iron to the transformed cells and nourish their expansion."

The chemosensitive channels were not observed when respiratory epithelium homogenates were used instead. Ionic selectivity is consistent with potassium ions as the charge carrier. These channels may be associated with the initial events of chemoreception in the rat olfactory epithelium.
https://openalex.org/W1664487761,"The responsiveness of granulosa cells to the gonadotropins and cAMP increases as ovarian follicles mature. To determine if this change in response might be related to either the content or cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of specific proteins, we labeled proteins in 30,000 X g supernatant fractions (cytosol) with [gamma-32P] ATP in the presence or absence of cAMP. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we observed that granulosa cells of preantral follicles exhibited low amounts of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of two proteins with apparent molecular weights of 54,000-56,000 and 43,000. Using [32P]8-N3cAMP and photoaffinity labeling procedures, the Mr = 54,000-56,000 protein was identified as RII, the regulatory subunit of type II protein kinase. Polychromatic silver staining, as well as the photoaffinity labeling, revealed that RII exists in three forms, each of which was also labeled by [gamma-32P] ATP. Based on the relative isoelectric points and specific silver staining of highly purified actin and phosphorylated actin, the Mr = 43,000 protein has been provisionally identified as actin. Five proteins (Mr = 37,500, 27,500, 22,500, 19,000, and 15,000), in addition to RII and actin, were phosphorylated in cytosol of granulosa cells from preovulatory follicles. By adding increasing concentrations of exogenous catalytic subunit to the cytosols, we demonstrated that the content, as well as the phosphorylation of these proteins, was increased selectively in granulosa cells of antral follicles. By using hypophysectomized rats, we demonstrated that these five proteins are induced by follitropin (FSH). Because they were not present in cytosols of thecal cells or corpora lutea, they appear to be specific markers for granulosa cells. The content and phosphorylation of RII was also dramatically increased in cytosols of granulosa cells from antral follicles, whereas that of actin remained unchanged. These observations indicate that granulosa cell differentiation involves regulation by FSH of specific proteins which are substrates for cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Thus, FSH and cAMP appear to regulate the intracellular content and phosphorylation of a cAMP response system in granulosa cells. The extent to which RII and the five specific phosphoproteins themselves regulate granulosa cell responsiveness remains to be determined."

The extraluminal segment (10 to 20 percent of the cell length) was suitable for intracellular perfusion and voltage clamp. The time and voltage dependence of the sodium current, and the responses to changes in driving force and channel blockers, illustrate the potential of these preparations as models for the study of membrane channels."
https://openalex.org/W2073140517,"Unlike many other T. brucei variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes, the IITat 1.3 gene is not duplicated when it is expressed. Analysis of the multiple copies of this gene present in all IITaR 1 trypanosome clones by restriction enzyme mapping and sequencing shows that the expressed copy may have arisen by duplication and transposition to a telomeric site, as is observed for those VSG genes whose expression is linked to duplication. The existence of a mechanism selecting between a number of complete telomeric VSG gene copies for expression is implied by these results. Comparisons of the nontelomeric copies of the IITat 1.3 gene are consistent with involvement of gene duplication and mutational drift in the evolution of new VSG genes."
https://openalex.org/W1993615003,"rDNA magnification is a heritable change in rDNA content that occurs in D. melanogaster males when chromosomes deficient in rDNA are placed together for several generations. We have examined the restriction endonuclease cleavage pattern of the rDNA from an X chromosome undergoing magnification, and find no evidence for the selective amplification of either uninterrupted rDNA units or those containing insertion sequences. In addition, we observe an amplification of rDNA in the first generation of extremely bobbed male progeny to a level exceeding that of wild-type flies, but that reduces to the wild-type level in subsequent generations. The type I rDNA insertion elements also occur as tandem arrays, independently of rDNA. Southern hybridizations indicate that the majority of these sequences are located in the heterochromatin surrounding the nucleolus organizer on the X chromosome, and we find that they, too, amplify transiently in the first generation of magnifying males."

This antigen (consisting of a doublet of 69,000 and 73,000 molecular weight) is first detected during the early hours of cell starvation and is present until cells begin slug formation. The developmental appearance of the antigen is not controlled by cAMP pulses and is distinct from that of Contact A sites.

The cloned complementary DNA insert, which contains the sequence that codes for all of the beta-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and beta-endorphin portions of proOLMC, as well as the 3' nontranslated section, is identical to the genomic sequence. Hybridization of tumor proOLMC complementary DNA to RNA subjected to electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter revealed two proOLMC messenger RNA species in the tumor polyadenylated RNA, but only one in pituitary polyadenylated RNA.

The DNA in these particles is protected from the action of pancreatic deoxyribonuclease. Transfer of genetic information by PLP has been accomplished by using a restriction fragment containing the transforming sequences of polyoma DNA as a model gene. Infection of rat F111 cells by PLP containing these sequences results in DNA-mediated cellular transformation. Gene transfer by PLP is 50 to 150 times more efficient than by the calcium phosphate precipitation method.

Alpha-adrenergic stimuli, angiotensin, vasopressin, dibutyryl adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate, and reduced phosphate concentrations in the medium increased the efflux of calcium-45 and lead-210. Glucagon and insulin had no effect, but increased phosphate concentrations decreased the efflux of both isotopes. Experiments with hepatocytes cultured in a medium free of calcium and lead demonstrated that the increased efflux of calcium-45 and lead-210 induced by hormones was the result of mobilization of the ions from intracellular stores. The data indicate that the physiological stimuli that mobilized calcium ions also mobilized lead ions, and that the mobilized lead would be available to interact with calcium-mediated cell functions."

The myeloperoxidase and acid hydrolase levels and continuous plasma membranes of these cell-like particles suggest that they are functional cellular entities. They further differ from platelets in that they contain nuclear remnants, occur in bacteria-laden pus and inflammatory exudates, are ingested by macrophages, and do not adhere to each other or aggregate.

https://openalex.org/W1599496965,"The effect of chromatin structure on the binding of a chemical carcinogen to the genomic DNA was studied. The binding in vivo of the ultimate carcinogen, benzo-pyrene 7,8,-diol,-9,10-epoxide, to various regions of the SV40 chromosome was revealed by an immunological method. Particular attention was given to restriction fragments which include the origin of replication which is non-nucleosomal in a significant fraction of the chromosomes. The distribution of (+/-) trans-7,8-dihydrobenzo[alpha]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE) adducts was studied in 1) SV40 DNA modified in vitro to a level of 20 adducts/molecule, 2) DNA from SV40 chromosomes modified in vivo to a level of less than 1 adduct, and 3) DNA from only those chromosomes with an open origin of replication. In other experiments, the binding of BPDE to the origin region was compared to the binding to nucleosome core particle DNA from the viral chromosome. The origin region bound 1.7-fold more BPDE than core DNA, while linker DNA is 3-fold more modified than core DNA. However, the origin region was only about 20% more modified than any other region of the chromosome. We conclude that while the conformation of the DNA in chromatin has a slight effect on its accessibility to the carcinogen, the SV40 chromosome does not contain a particular hot spot which is preferentially modified by BPDE."
https://openalex.org/W1599861003,"The catalytic subunit of sodium and potassium ion transport adenosine triphosphatase was isolated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and was subjected to isoelectric focussing on 3.5% acrylamide in 2% Triton X-100, 9 M urea, and 2% Bio-Lyte 3/10 from Bio-Rad Laboratories. At 20 degrees C this resolved 2 equal and closely spaced bands centered at pH 5.5 about 0.04 pH unit apart. The distribution of the polypeptide between the 2 bands came to a temperature-dependent equilibrium during focussing. At 15 degrees C predominantly the acidic band and at 25 degrees C predominantly the alkaline band appeared. Perhaps association of the nonionic detergent with the polypeptide resulted in its partitioning into bands corresponding to different physical states. A change of phase in a polypeptide-detergent complex might have altered its charge. To test functional homogeneity of the subunit in the native enzyme, the active center for ATP binding was covalently labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate, an acidic ligand. Isoelectric focussing of the derivatized subunit at 20 degrees C showed displacement of all of the alkaline band to the position of the acidic band, which was fluorescent. Isoelectric focussing at 25 degrees C showed displacement of almost half of the alkaline band to the position of the acidic band, and both bands were fluorescent. The results suggest that all of the subunit accepted the fluorescent label and that derivatization slightly raised the temperature at which the polypeptide equilibrated between the 2 states. A few experiments on the calcium-dependent ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum indicated that it responded similarly."
https://openalex.org/W1551589424,"A single chain polypeptide, termed beta-RTX, with an apparent Mr = 9600 has been isolated from the venom of Vipera russelli russelli. It was purified by cation exchange chromatography, followed by preparative isoelectric focusing and chromatofocusing. Purity was confirmed by gel filtration, high performance liquid chromatography, gel electrophoresis, and analytical ultracentrifugation. Amino acid analysis revealed the presence of eight half-cystines, one being located at the NH2 terminus, which are linked to form four intramolecular disulfide bridges. Chromatofocusing revealed some microheterogeneity yielding three isoforms with pI values of 9.3, 9.37, and 9.48, respectively. In its native configuration, beta-RTX was not susceptible to tryptic degradation but was readily digested after reduction and alkylation. beta-RTX possesses weak phospholipase A2 activity and competes with the binding of monoamines and opiate ligands to their respective receptors. No binding to histamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, benzodiazepine, or muscarinic receptors was observed. In vivo, whereas 100 micrograms/kg intravenous beta-RTX seemed to be without apparent effects in the rat, 10 ng/kg beta-RTX injected intracerebroventricularly caused marked sedation, with full recovery within 3 h."
https://openalex.org/W1585513917,"The mechanism of SV40-induced cellular transformation was investigated by two-dimensional gel analysis of 35S- and 32P-labeled proteins of various cells. These included rat and mouse cells, either transformed or abortively infected by SV40 wild type, small t deletion mutants, and a large T temperature-sensitive mutant. Synthesis, turnover, or (de)phosphorylation of multiple protein spots was found to be reproducibly and quantitatively influenced by the transformed and/or infected status. Several of these alterations were attributable to the biological activity of either large T or small t antigen. Most changes in 35S-labeled proteins corresponded to a decreased intensity of the gel spots in transformed cells, while hyperphosphorylated proteins were more common than hypophosphorylated ones. About half of the polypeptide alterations in 35S-and 32P-labeled SV40-transformed rat cells, including a set of 35S-labeled small t-dependent changes were shared by Rous sarcoma virus-transformed cells. In contrast, small t-dependent (de)phosphorylation was rarely detected. Phosphoamino acid analysis of selected phosphoprotein spots of rat cells and alkaline hydrolysis of whole two-dimensional gels did not reveal any evidence for increased tyrosine-specific phosphorylation after SV40-induced transformation. Abortively infected mouse cells showed many protein alterations, also observed in stably transformed cells. However, the latter cells contained additional changes, also affecting several phosphoproteins and possibly related to the establishment of transformation. These findings are discussed in relation to the biological functions, known or presumed, for SV40 large T and small t antigens during transformation."
