Recently, Copenhaver et al. 1 and Hagen2, studying the histamine content of different cell fractions of dog liver, verified that the major amount of this substance was present in the mitochondrial fraction."

https://openalex.org/W2047366430,"IT is a well-established fact that ionizing irradiation damages a variety of cells to a greater extent if the irradiation takes place in presence of oxygen than under anaerobic conditions. The mechanism of this ‘oxygen-effect’ is not yet fully understood. It is generally believed1–4 to be due to the deleterious effect on cells by the strongly oxidizing radical HO2 and, to some extent, by hydrogen peroxide, which are formed on X-ray irradiation in aqueous media containing oxygen, as compared with the less powerful OH radical which, in addition to reducing hydrogen atoms, is formed on irradiation in nitrogen. The exception, so far, is a bacteriophage, for which evidence has been adduced5,6 that it has a far greater sensitivity to reducing than to oxidizing radicals."

https://openalex.org/W2019175812,"THE task of testing and localizing enzymes in a protein mixture subjected to paper electrophoresis is a tedious one. This is particularly true in a fractionation study where the number of tests may be numerous. During the course of such an investigation of the various carbohydrases in an Aspergillus niger fermentation, it became necessary to employ a rapid qualitative test for the detection of these enzymes. Keilin and Hartree1 have reported that glucose oxidase (notatin) can be successfully used for the quantitative assay of various carbohydrases. Monod and Torriani2 employed notatin to determine glucose in their studies of amylomaltase. Recently, Whistler et al. 3 showed that D-glucose in corn syrups can also be quantitatively estimated by using notatin. The latter enzyme oxidizes glucose to yield two products—gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide."

https://openalex.org/W2025621364,"BETA-TRACK autoradiographs offer advantages over other methods of autoradiography, especially when small quantities of weak emitters such as carbon-14 are used1. If, in addition, the autograph and tissue can be viewed as a unit, a further advantage is gained2. Such preparations permit detection of the characteristic tracks in the presence of heavy background fog; eliminate the problem of spurious interpretation due to the reduction of the silver grains by tissue constituents3; require far less radioactivity for detection than other methods of autoradiography; permit viewing at high magnifying power with consequent localization of radioactivity to small areas; and eliminate matching of tissue and autograph. Beta tracks, due to their tortuous path, do not permit determination of a point source."
