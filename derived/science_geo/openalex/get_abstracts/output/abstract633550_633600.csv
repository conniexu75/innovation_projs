Passive radiative cooling materials are engineered to do this extremely well. Li et al. engineered a wood through delignification and re-pressing to create a mechanically strong material that also cools passively. They modeled the cooling savings of their wood for 16 different U.S. cities, which suggested savings between 20 and 50%. Cooling wood would be of particular value in hot and dry climates.

In addition, the heating of reactors through fossil-fuel burning contributes further CO 2 emissions. One problem is that the catalyst bed is heated unevenly, which renders much of the catalyst effectively inactive. Wismann et al. describe an electrical heating scheme for a metal tube reactor that improves the uniformity of heating and catalyst usage (see the Perspective by Van Geem et al. ). Adoption of this alternative approach could affect CO 2 emissions by up to approximately 1% of global emissions. Science , this issue p. 756 ; see also p. 734"

Charcot-Leyden crystals (CLCs) are formed from the eosinophil granule protein galectin-10 (Gal10) and found in severe eosinophil-associated diseases like asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis. Whether CLCs actively contribute to disease pathogenesis is unknown. Persson et al. found that lab-grown Gal10 crystals are biosimilar to CLCs (see the Perspective by Allen and Sutherland). When given to mice, the crystals acted as a type 2 adjuvant, mimicking many of the features of human asthma. In contrast, a Gal10 mutein unable to crystallize had no effect. Antibodies against epitopes crucial for Gal10 autocrystallization could dissolve both in vitro–generated Gal10 crystals and patient-derived CLCs. Furthermore, these anti-Gal10 antibodies reversed the effects of Gal10 crystals in a humanized mouse model of asthma, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for crystallopathies more broadly.

https://openalex.org/W2945018607,"Heteroplasmy incidence in mitochondrial DNA In humans, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is predominantly maternally inherited. mtDNA is under selection to prevent heteroplasmy—the transmission of multiple genetic variants into the next generation. Wei et al. explored human mtDNA sequences to determine mtDNA genome structure, selection, and transmission. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that about 45% of individuals carry heteroplasmic mtDNA sequences at levels greater than 1% of their total mtDNA. Furthermore, studies of more than 1500 mother-offspring pairs indicated that the female line selected which mtDNA variants were passed on to children. This effect was influenced by the mother's nuclear genetic background. Thus, mtDNA is under selection at specific loci in the human germ line. Science , this issue p. eaau6520"

How quickly can a resistance gene be expressed after transfer? In susceptible bacterial cells, tetracycline should inhibit protein synthesis, including from the plasmid-transferred resistance gene tetA . Unexpectedly, Nolivos et al. found that TetA can be expressed despite the presence of tetracycline (see the Perspective by Povolo and Ackermann). Immediately after plasmid transfer into a cell, TetA synthesis starts because its repressor is slow to be expressed. In addition, the ubiquitous xenobiotic efflux pump AcrAB-TolC buys time for TetA translation by keeping tetracycline concentration below toxic levels. Science , this issue p. 778 ; see also p. 737"

Such richness conjures up images of coral heads and large colorful reef fishes. Brandl et al. show, however, that one of the most striking and important parts of the reef ecosystem is almost never seen (see the Perspective by Riginos and Leis). Small cryptobenthic fish, like blennies, make up nearly 40% of reef fish biodiversity. Furthermore, the majority of cryptobenthic fish larvae settle locally, rather than being widely dispersed, and have rapid turnover rates. Such high diversity and densities could thus provide the biomass base for larger, better-known reef fish. Science , this issue p. 1189 ; see also p. 1128"

However, these reactions are limited by their tendency to leave the oxygen on the more heavily substituted carbon, in accord with the Markovnikov rule. Yao et al. now show that a pair of catalysts working cooperatively can invert this selectivity pattern. A titanium catalyst pries the ring open while a chromium catalyst activates and delivers hydrogen. In an unusual mechanistic twist, the chromium complex appears to deliver a hydrogen atom, a proton, and an electron at different stages of the cycle. Science , this issue p. 764"

SidJ prevents lysosome fusion with the vacuole, within which the bacterium resides and replicates. SidJ also modulates the toxicity of the SidE family ubiquitin ligases that catalyze phosphoribosyl-linked host protein ubiquitination. Black et al. discovered that SidJ is activated by host calmodulin. Furthermore, although SidJ has a pseudokinase fold, it does not phosphorylate SidE proteins but polyglutamylates them instead.

https://openalex.org/W2945929016,"Exploring a range of signaling Cytokines are small proteins that bind to the extracellular domains of transmembrane receptors to activate signaling pathways inside the cell. They often act by dimerizing their receptors, and changes in dimer orientation of the extracellular domains can change the signaling output. Mohan et al. systematically explored this tuning effect by designing a series of dimer ligands for the erythropoietin receptor in which they varied the distance and angle between monomers. The topology affected the strength of activation and differentially affected different pathways, which raises the potential for exploiting such ligands in medicinal chemistry.

Achieving these behaviors with synthetic receptors has usually been associated with OH and NH hydrogen bonding. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, we designed a chloride-selective receptor in the form of a cryptand-like cage using only CH hydrogen bonding. Crystallography showed chloride stabilized by six short 2.7-angstrom hydrogen bonds originating from the cage's six 1,2,3-triazoles. Attomolar affinity (1017 M-1) was determined using liquid-liquid extractions of chloride from water into nonpolar dichloromethane solvents.

https://openalex.org/W2945602729,"What inhibits the inhibitors? In the hippocampus, each memory trace is encoded by a specific subset of pyramidal cells. The other pyramidal cells must be actively excluded from the memory encoding process by inhibition, which is done by selective dendrite-targeting interneurons. Szőnyi et al. found that γ-aminobutyric acid–releasing (GABAergic) cells located in a small region in the brain stem called the nucleus incertus project to the hippocampus. The nucleus incertus again is innervated by several regions that respond to salient stimuli. Its GABAergic cells preferentially inhibit the dendrite-targeting interneurons in the hippocampus. The nucleus incertus is thus a central mediator between brain regions that are highly responsive to salient stimuli and the hippocampal circuitry involved in memory formation.

https://openalex.org/W2945944823,"We study the relative importance of the three dimensions of need-supportive teaching (NST) and students’ self-efficacy to gain new knowledge about students’ achievement in higher education. NST assumes that teachers are key to the motivation of students, providing autonomy support, structure (support of competence), and involvement (support of relatedness). In turn, self-efficacy raises students’ confidence in their ability to succeed in academic tasks. Drawing on 86,000 records of teaching evaluations by students at the University of Girona (Spain), we present evidence that teachers’ involvement and students’ self-efficacy are the two elements most strongly and positively related to achievement. Students obtain higher marks when they believe that their teachers are dependable and available to offer resources, and when they feel capable of organizing and implementing the courses of action necessary to acquire knowledge. We also find that students’ experience of autonomy support and structure are negatively (or not) correlated with achievement. Subgroup analyses also indicate that students have different needs in different knowledge areas."
https://openalex.org/W2945248317,"Influenza virus causes infected cells to generate large numbers of lipid droplets. Because the virus envelope contains substantial cholesterol, we applied atorvastatin (ATV) to Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells before infecting them. Five micromolars ATV, within physiologic range, strongly (>95%) inhibits reproduction of influenza A as measured by PCR of viral RNA, plaque assay for viable virus, and production of virus nucleoprotein (NP). Inhibition of any of the following can suppress formation of lipid droplets (>-50%) but does not interfere with the production of NP: endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy, or production of reactive oxygen substances (ROS). We conclude that, regardless of whether this widely used statin, which is generally considered to be safe, can prevent infection or minimize its severity, inhibition of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase pathway to protect against infection by influenza virus or to mitigate its severity warrants further exploration.-Episcopio, D., Aminov, S., Benjamin, S., Germain, G., Datan, E., Landazuri, J., Lockshin, R.

https://openalex.org/W2945624389,"Acute change in water temperature causes heavy economic losses in the aquaculture industry. The present study investigated the metabolic and molecular effects of acute thermal stress on black rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii). Gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS)-based metabolomics was used to investigate the global metabolic response of black rockfish at a high water temperature (27°C), low water temperature (5°C) and normal water temperature (16°C). Metabolites involved in energy metabolism and basic amino acids were significantly increased upon acute exposure to 27°C (P < 0.05), and no change in metabolite levels occurred in the low water temperature group. However, certain fatty acid levels were elevated after cold stress (P < 0.05), and this effect was not observed in the 27°C group, suggesting that acute high and low temperature exposures caused different physiological responses. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we analyzed the expression of ubiquitin (ub), hypoxia-inducible factor (hif), lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (acac). Higher expression levels of ub, hif, and ldh (P < 0.05) were observed in the high water temperature group, but no changes in these expression levels occurred in the low water temperature group. Our findings provide a potential metabolic profile for black rockfish when exposed to acute temperature stress and provide some insights into host metabolic and molecular responses to thermal stress."

In this paper, we demonstrate that by identifying topological features in very high resolution retinal images, we can construct a classifier that discriminates between healthy patients and those with diabetic retinopathy using summary statistics of these features. Topological data analysis identifies the features as connected components and holes in the images and describes the extent to which they persist across the image. These features are encoded in persistence diagrams, summaries of which can be used to discrimate between diabetic and healthy patients. The method has the potential to be an effective automated screening tool, with high sensitivity and specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2945613431,"In the re-emergence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), live bird markets have been identified to play a critical role. In this repeated cross-sectional study, we combined surveillance data collected monthly on Jakarta's live bird markets over a five-year period, with risk factors related to the structure and management of live bird markets, the trading and slaughtering of birds at these markets, and environmental and demographic conditions in the areas where the markets were located. Over the study period 36.7% (95% CI: 35.1, 38.3) of samples (N = 1315) tested HPAI H5 virus positive. Using General Estimation Equation approaches to account for repeated observations over time, we explored the association between HPAI H5 virus prevalence and potential risk factors. Markets where only live birds and carcasses were sold, but no slaughtering was conducted at or at the vicinity of the markets, had a significantly reduced chance of being positive for H5 virus (OR = 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.5). Also, markets, that used display tables for poultry carcasses made from wood, had reduced odds of being H5 virus positive (OR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-1.0), while having at least one duck sample included in the pool of samples collected at the market increased the chance of being H5 virus positive (OR = 5.7, 95% CI 3.6-9.2). Markets where parent stock was traded, were more at risk of being H5 virus positive compared to markets where broilers were traded. Finally, the human population density in the district, the average distance between markets and origins of poultry sold at markets and the total rainfall per month were all positively associated with higher H5 virus prevalence. In summary, our results highlight that a combination of factors related to trading and marketing processes and environmental pressures need to be considered to reduce H5 virus infection risk for customers at urban live bird markets. In particular, the relocation of slaughter areas to well-managed separate locations should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2946426625,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is associated with negative physical and mental health outcomes. Although maternal health services, especially antenatal care (ANC), can act as a link to IPV resources, women experiencing IPV likely have reduced uptake of ANC due to social and emotional barriers. Poor ANC uptake can also further exacerbate adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, there is limited research examining the association between IPV and ANC within the context of Mozambique. Using data from a study conducted to assess the impact of membership in savings groups on maternal health service utilization in Mozambique (N = 205), we investigated the association between IPV and uptake of ANC. Pearson chi-square and logistic regression were employed to examine the association between IPV and ANC service utilization. The mean age of the participants was 33.4 years (SD = 11.88). Overall, 47.3%, 83.4%, and 51.7% of the participants reported experiencing IPV, receiving at least one ANC, and four or more ANC, respectively. Women who reported experience of IPV had lower odds of receiving both at least one (AOR 0.31 [95% CI:0.12–0.82]) and four or more ANC (AOR 0.50 [95% CI: 0.27–0.92]). Women who reported experience of IPV also had lower odds of receiving ANC from skilled personnel (AOR 0.32 [95% CI: 0.10–0.90]). Experience of IPV showed significant association with reduced ANC service utilization among women in the study area. Further study is needed to assess whether the negative association between IPV and ANC service utilization is also a causal relationship, the evidence which will then help guide a comprehensive intervention effort to improve maternal health services use."
https://openalex.org/W2944825246,"NK cells have an important role in immunosurveillance of multiple myeloma (MM) progression, and their activity is enhanced by combination therapies able to regulate the expression of specific activating ligands. Liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors and important regulators of intracellular cholesterol and lipid homeostasis. Moreover, they have regulatory roles in both cancer and immune response. Indeed, they can regulate inflammation and innate and acquired immunity. Furthermore, LXR activation directly acts in cancer cells (e.g., prostate, breast, melanoma, colon cancer, hepatocarcinoma, glioblastoma, and MM) that show an accumulation of cholesterol and alteration of LXR-mediated metabolic pathways. Here, we investigated the role of LXR and cholesterol on the expression of the NK cell-activating ligands major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related molecule A and B (MICA and MICB) in MM cells. The results shown in this work indicate that MM cells are responsive to LXR activation, which induces changes in the intracellular cholesterol content. These changes correlate with an enhanced expression of MICA and MICB in human MM cell lines and in primary malignant plasma cells, 2 ligands of the NK group 2D receptor (NKG2D)/CD314 activating receptor expressed in cytotoxic lymphocytes, rendering MM cells more sensitive to recognition, degranulation, and killing by NK cells. Mechanistically, we observed that LXR activation regulates MICA and MICB expression at different levels: MICA at the transcriptional level, enhancing mica promoter activity, and MICB by inhibiting its degradation in lysosomes. The present study provides evidence that activation of LXR, by enhancing NKG2D ligand expression, can promote NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and suggests a novel immune-mediated mechanism involving modulation of intracellular cholesterol levels in cancer cells.-Bilotta, M. T., Abruzzese, M. P., Molfetta, R., Scarno, G., Fionda, C., Zingoni, A., Soriani, A., Garofalo, T., Petrucci, M. T., Ricciardi, M. R., Paolini, R., Santoni, A., Cippitelli, M.

https://openalex.org/W2945034092,"Disease outbreaks are limiting factors for an ethical and economically sustainable aquaculture industry. The first point of contact between a pathogen and a host occurs in the mucus, which covers the epithelial surfaces of the skin, gills and gastrointestinal tract. Increased knowledge on host-pathogen interactions at these primary barriers may contribute to development of disease prevention strategies. The mucus layer is built of highly glycosylated mucins, and mucin glycosylation differs between these epithelial sites. We have previously shown that A. salmonicida binds to Atlantic salmon mucins. Here we demonstrate binding of four additional bacteria, A. hydrophila, V. harveyi, M. viscosa and Y. ruckeri, to mucins from Atlantic salmon and Arctic char. No specific binding could be observed for V. salmonicida to any of the mucin groups. Mucin binding avidity was highest for A. hydrophila and A. salmonicida, followed by V. harveyi, M. viscosa and Y. ruckeri in decreasing order. Four of the pathogens showed highest binding to either gills or intestinal mucins, whereas none of the pathogens had preference for binding to skin mucins. Fluid velocity enhanced binding of intestinal mucins to A. hydrophila and A. salmonicida at 1.5 and 2 cm/s, whereas a velocity of 2 cm/s for skin mucins increased binding of A. salmonicida and decreased binding of A. hydrophila. Binding avidity, specificity and the effect of fluid velocity on binding thus differ between salmonid pathogens and with mucin origin. The results are in line with a model where the short skin mucin glycans contribute to contact with pathogens whereas pathogen binding to mucins with complex glycans aid the removal of pathogens from internal epithelial surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2945404676,"Previous studies have shown that the size of the leftward bias after exposure to rightward prism-deviation (the prismatic after-effect) depends on the degree of rightward prism-deviation as well as the type of visual feedback receives during exposure to prism-deviation. In this study, we tested if it was possible to obtain a leftward bias in pointing precision using two different methods of creating diverted visual input by simulating a rightward prism diversion of visual input in immersive virtual reality. We compared the results to the leftward bias in pointing precision obtained after exposure to standard prism goggles deviating visual input 10 degrees to the right. Twenty healthy participants were subjected to one session of standard prism adaptation therapy under three different conditions of deviated visual input: 1) created by imitating a 10 degree leftward rotation of the head (VRR), 2) created by imitating a 2D leftward horizontal displacement of 10 degrees (VRS) and 3) a control condition using real right-deviating prisms (PCP). The study showed that the simulated prisms in the VRR and VRS conditions produced deviations in pointing precision of a similar size. However, exposure to the VRS and VRR conditions both produced larger prismatic after-effects than the exposure to real prism goggles. This research is important for the development and use of virtual reality systems in the rehabilitation of neglect after brain injury as it emphasizes that the adjustment to deviated visual input may be affected positively by the use of immersive virtual reality technology."

https://openalex.org/W2945460381,"Heterodera glycines (soybean cyst nematode, SCN) is one of the most devastating pathogens of soybean worldwide. The compatible and in compatible interactions between soybean and SCN have well documented. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism of a nonhost resistant response in soybean against SCN infection remains obscure. Toward this end, a global transcriptional comparison was conducted between susceptible and resistant reactions of soybean roots infected by taking advantage of finding a new pathotype of SCN (SCNT). The soybean cultivar Lee, which exhibits resistant to SCNT and susceptible to HG 1.2.3.4.7 (SCNs) was utilized in the expriments. The results highlighted a nonhost resistant response of soybean. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the resistant interaction (3746) was much larger than that in the susceptible interaction (602). A great number of genes acting as intrinsic component of membrane, integral component of membrane, cell periphery and plasma membrance were remarkably enriched only in the resistant interaction, while the taurine and hypotaurine, phenylpropanoid pathway, plant-pathogen interaction and transcript factors were modulated in both interactions. This is the first study to examine genes expression patterns in a soybean genotype in response to invasion by a virulent and avirulent SCN population at the transcriptional level, which will provide insights into the complicate molecular mechanism of the nonhost resistant interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2946410127,"The study of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in the United States has identified a growing prevalence of the disorder across the country, a high economic burden for necessary treatment, and important gaps in insurance for individuals with autism. Confronting these facts, states have moved quickly in recent years to introduce mandates that insurers provide coverage for autism care. This study analyzes these autism insurance mandates and demonstrates that while states have moved swiftly to introduce them, the generosity of the benefits they mandate insurers provide varies dramatically across states. Furthermore, our research finds that controlling for policy need, interest group activity, economic circumstances, the insurance environment, and other factors, the passage of these mandates and differences in their generosity are driven by the ideology of state residents and politicians–with more generous benefits in states with more liberal citizens and increased Democratic control of state government. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for the study of health policy, politics, and autism in America."

In this study, we investigated the effect of propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker on overall survival (OS) in unresectable/metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and on recurrence-free survival (RFS) in resectable, curable HCC. Methods Data were retrieved from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between January 2000 and December 2013. Propranolol users (for >1 year) and non-propranolol users were matched using a 1:2 propensity score in both cohorts. Results The unresectable/metastatic HCC cohort comprised 1,560 propranolol users and 3,120 non-propranolol users (control group). On multivariate Cox regression analysis of HCC mortality, propranolol significantly reduced the mortality risk by 22% (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72–0.84, P <0.001). On stratified Cox regression analysis, propranolol also reduced the mortality risk in HCC patients with hepatitis B (HR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.85–0.99, P = 0.045), hepatitis C (HR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.78–0.92, P = 0.001), liver cirrhosis (HR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.72–0.85, P <0.001), and diabetes mellitus (HR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.81–0.94, P = 0.008). The resectable, curable HCC cohort comprised 289 propranolol users and 578 non-propranolol users (control group), but there was no significant difference in RFS (P = 0.762) between propranolol and non-propranolol users.

https://openalex.org/W2946710101,"Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) populations in the Gulf of Maine (GoM) are at a fraction of their historical abundance, creating economic hardships for fishermen and putting at risk the genetic diversity of the remaining populations. An understanding of the biocomplexity among GoM populations will allow for adaptive genetic diversity to be conserved to maximize the evolutionary potential and resilience of the fishery in a rapidly changing environment. We used restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) to characterize the population structure and adaptive genetic diversity of five spawning aggregations from the western GoM and Georges Bank. We also analyzed cod caught in the eastern GoM, an under-sampled area where spawning aggregations have been extirpated. Using 3,128 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we confirmed the existence of three genetically separable spawning groups: (1) winter spawning cod from the western GoM, (2) spring spawning cod, also from the western GoM, and (3) Georges Bank cod. Non-spawning cod from the eastern GoM could not be decisively linked to either of the three spawning groups and may represent a unique component of the resource, a mixed sample, or cod from other unsampled source populations. The genetic differentiation among the three major spawning groups was primarily driven by loci putatively under selection, particularly loci in regions known to contain genomic inversions on linkage groups (LG) 7 and 12. These LGs have been found to be linked to thermal regime in cod across the Atlantic, and so it is possible that variation in timing of spawning in western GoM cod has resulted in temperature-driven adaptive divergence. This complex population structure and adaptive genetic differentiation could be crucial to ensuring the long-term productivity and resilience of the cod fishery, and so it should be considered in future management plans."
https://openalex.org/W2945862984,"Background Recently, attention has been focused on the role of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels in the mechanism of and as a treatment target for neuropathic and inflammatory pain. Ivabradine, a blocker of HCN channels, was demonstrated to have an effect on neuropathic pain in an animal model. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the effect of ivabradine on inflammatory pain, and under the hypothesis that ivabradine can directly influence inflammatory responses, we investigated its effect in in vivo and in vitro studies. Methods After approval from our institution, we studied male Sprague–Dawley rats aged 8 weeks. Peripheral inflammation was induced by the subcutaneous injection of carrageenan into the hindpaw of rats. The paw-withdrawal threshold (pain threshold) was evaluated by applying mechanical stimulation to the injected site with von Frey filaments. Ivabradine was subcutaneously injected, combined with carrageenan, and its effect on the pain threshold was evaluated. In addition, we evaluated the effects of ivabradine on the accumulation of leukocytes and TNF-alpha expression in the injected area of rats. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of ivabradine on LPS-stimulated production of TNF-alpha in incubated mouse macrophage-like cells. Results The addition of ivabradine to carrageenan increased the pain threshold lowered by carrageenan injection. Both lamotrigine and forskolin, activators of HCN channels, significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of ivabradine on the pain threshold. Ivabradine inhibited the carrageenan-induced accumulation of leukocytes and TNF-alpha expression in the injected area. Furthermore, ivabradine significantly inhibited LPS-stimulated production of TNF-alpha in the incubated cells. Conclusion The results of the present study demonstrated that locally injected ivabradine is effective against carrageenan-induced inflammatory pain via HCN channels. Its effect was considered to involve not only an action on peripheral nerves but also an anti-inflammatory effect."

The naturally occurring cyclodextrin (CD) scaffold composed of 6-8 glucose units offers the possibility of expanding the valency. Here we have adapted a chemoenzymatic-click strategy for displaying heptavalent peptides and large proteins on the β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) scaffold. We demonstrate that recombinant proteins (engineered with a LPXTG pentapeptide motif at the carboxy terminus), labeled with an alkyne moiety by sortase-mediated ligation, can be easily clicked on to the azide-derivatized β-cyclodextrin through the Huisgen cycloaddition reaction yielding a well-defined heptavalent display of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2946641894,"The establishment of ungulate embryonic stem cells (ESCs) has been notoriously difficult via a conventional approach. We combined a traditional ESC culture method with reprogramming factors to assist the establishment of porcine naive-like ESCs (nESCs). Pig embryonic fibroblasts were transfected with a tetracycline-inducible vector carrying 4 classic mouse reprogramming factors, followed by somatic cell nuclear transfer and culturing to the blastocyst stage. Then, the inner cell mass was isolated and seeded in culture medium. The naive-like ESCs had characteristic verys similar to those of mouse ESCs and showed no signs of altered morphology or differentiation, even after 130 passages. They depended on leukemia inhibitory factor signals for maintenance of pluripotency, and the female cell lines had low expression of the X-inactive specific transcript gene and no histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation spot. Notably, the ESCs differentiated into 3 germ layers in vitro and could be induced to undergo directional neural and kidney precursor differentiation under defined conditions, and the ESCs could keep proliferating after doxycycline was removed. nESCs can be established, and the well-characterized ESC lines will be useful for the research of transgenic pig models for human disease.-Zhang, M., Wang, C., Jiang, H., Liu, M., Yang, N., Zhao, L., Hou, D., Jin, Y., Chen, Q., Chen, Y., Wang, J., Dai, Y., Li, R.

Over the last three decades, despite considerable advances in tobacco control policy in Brazil, gestational smoking has caused a considerable number of fetal deaths and disabilities. The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of pre-gestational and gestational smoking and to identify the factors associated with smoking cessation up to the 20th gestational week.""Birth in Brazil"" was a nationwide hospital-based study conducted from February 2011 to October 2012. Smoking prevalence and smoking cessation during pregnancy was estimated through face-to-face interviews with postpartum women during hospitalization for birth care. We performed multivariate logistic regression to verify the factors associated with smoking cessation up to the 5th month of pregnancy.prevalence of pre-gestational smoking of 16.1% (CI 95% 15.3%-16.9%); prevalence of smoking any time during pregnancy of 9.6% (CI 95% 9.0%-10.3%); and prevalence of smoking cessation up to the 5th month of pregnancy of 56.7% (CI 95% 54.0%-59.4%). The factors associated with smoking cessation were residence in the North, Northeast, and Central-West of Brazil, having received at least one prenatal consultation (OR 3.51 CI 95% 1.85-6.67), more years of schooling (15 or more vs less than 7 years of schooling OR 5.54 CI 95% 2.97-10.34), living with a partner (OR 1.35 CI 95% 1.01-1.79), no children prior to the index pregnancy (OR 2.77 CI 95% 2.13-3.61), and absence of alcohol use (1.74 CI 95% 1.39-2.18) or of suspected alcohol abuse (OR 1.62 CI 95% 1.07-2.45).The estimated smoking rate during pregnancy in Brazil is still high and is associated with factors of increased maternal social vulnerability, which may contribute to the increased occurrence of unfavorable perinatal outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2946128306,"Background In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PD-L1 expression on either tumor cells (TC) or both TC and tumor-infiltrating immune cells (IC) is currently the most used biomarker in cancer immunotherapy. However, the mechanisms involved in PD-L1 regulation are not fully understood. To provide better insight in these mechanisms, a multiangular analysis approach was used to combine protein and mRNA expression with several clinicopathological characteristics. Patients and methods Archival tissues from 640 early stage, resected NSCLC patients were analyzed with immunohistochemistry for expression of PD-L1 and CD8 infiltration. In addition, mutational status and expression of a selection of immune genes involved in the PD-L1/PD-1 axis and T-cell response was determined. Results Tumors with high PD-L1 expression on TC or on IC represent two subsets of NSCLC with minimal overlap. We observed that PD-L1 expression on IC irrespective of expression on TC is a good marker for inflammation within tumors. In the tumors with the highest IC expression and absent TC expression an association with reduced IFNγ downstream signaling in tumor cells was observed. Conclusions These results show that PD-L1 expression on TC and IC are both independent hallmarks of the inflamed phenotype in NSCLC, and TC-negative/IC-high tumors can also be categorized as inflamed. The lack of correlation between PD-L1 TC and IC expression in this subgroup may be caused by impaired IFNγ signaling in tumor cells. These findings may bring a better understanding of the tumor-immune system interaction and the clinical relevance of PD-L1 expression on IC irrespective of PD-L1 expression on TC."
https://openalex.org/W2946413615,"In many countries, such as the US, Germany, France, and the Netherlands, governments are dealing with a great shortage of organ donors. Even though people generally show positive attitudes towards organ donation, they often do not actually register as organ donors themselves. This study’s objective was to explore prevailing viewpoints among the Dutch population on deceased organ donation and the relation between aspects of the viewpoints potentially influencing the decision to register as an organ donor. Although substantive research about attitudes on organ donation has been conducted, this is the first study investigating people’s viewpoints focusing on the relation between beliefs, tastes, preferences, motives, goals and other constituents underlying people’s viewpoints on organ donation, such as the role of the media and public policies. This Q-methodology study revealed four viewpoints: “not donating your organs is a waste”, “it does not go with my religion”, “my family should decide”; and “it’s a good deed, but I’m doubtful”. These viewpoints convey information on potential reasons for the gap between people’s favourable attitudes towards organ donation and the low number of actual registrations, and opportunities for policy makers to address certain target groups more adequately."

https://openalex.org/W2945286211,"Serological assays to determine HIV incidence have contributed to estimates of HIV incidence, monitoring of HIV spread, and evaluation of prevention strategies. Two frequently used incidence assays are the Sedia HIV-1 LAg-Avidity EIA (LAg) and the Bio-Rad avidity incidence (BRAI) assays with a mean duration of recent infection (MDRI) of 130 and 240 days for subtype B infections, respectively. Little is known about how these assays perform with recombinant HIV-1 strains. We evaluated the concordance of these assays in a population infected mainly with HIV-1 CRF06_cpx.Remnant serum samples (n = 288) collected from confirmed, newly-diagnosed HIV-positive persons from Estonia in 2013 were tested. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from clinical databases. LAg was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol and BRAI testing was done using a validated protocol. Samples with LAg-pending or BRAI-invalid results were reclassified as recent if they were from persons with viral loads <1000 copies/mL or were reclassified as long-term if presenting with AIDS.In total 325 new HIV infections were diagnosed in 2013 in Estonia. Of those 276 persons were tested with both LAg and BRAI. Using assay results only, the recency rate was 44% and 70% by LAg and BRAI, respectively. The majority of samples (92%) recent by LAg were recent by BRAI. Similarly, 89% of samples long-term by BRAI were long-term by LAg. After clinical information was included in the analysis, the recency rate was 44% and 62% for LAg and BRAI, respectively. The majority of samples (86%) recent by LAg were recent by BRAI and 91% of long-term infections by BRAI were long-term by LAg.Comparison of LAg and BRAI results in this mostly CRF06_cpx-infected population showed good concordance for incidence classification. Our finding of a higher recency rate with BRAI in this population is likely related to the longer MDRI for this assay."
https://openalex.org/W2946445902,"Aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3) is known for multiple functions including its catalytic activity towards producing extra-testicular androgen. The present study is towards understanding interaction between biological, lifestyle and genetic impacts of AKR1C3 and their influence on clinical factors in a prostate cancer (PC) cohort from New Zealand (NZ).Characteristics of 516 PC patients were collected from the Auckland Regional Urology Facility, NZ. These men were genotyped for the AKR1C3 rs12529 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The leukocyte AKR1C3 activity was measured in a sub-cohort. Variability of leukocyte AKR1C3 activity between biological, lifestyle and clinical features as well as correlation between biological and clinical features were assessed with and without genetic stratification.The leukocyte AKR1C3 activity was associated with age at diagnosis (0.51 vs 0.34 μM coumberol units for >69y vs ≤69y, P = 0.03); and with anatomic stage/prognostic grouping among the AKR1C3 rs12529 CC genotype carriers (0.50 vs 28 μM coumberol units among low- and high-risk groups respectively, P = 0.02). Significant correlation between leukocyte AKR1C3 activity and age at PC diagnosis was also observed (correlation coefficient 0.20 and P = 0.02). Ever- smoking impacted both age and PSA at PC diagnosis among AKR1C3 rs12529 GG and CG genotype carriers respectively. Age at diagnosis significantly correlated with PSA at diagnosis in the main (correlation coefficient 0.29, and P<0.001) and sub-cohorts (correlation coefficient 0.24, and P = 0.01); and those carrying the AKR1C3 rs12529 CG and GG genotypes in both the main (correlation coefficient 0.30, and P<0.001 and correlation coefficient 0.35, and P<0.001 respectively) and sub-cohorts (correlation coefficient 0.43, and P<0.001 and correlation coefficient 0.39, and P = 0.06 respectively); but not with those carrying the CC genotype.Age dependent PSA thresholds in PC screening could have been valid only in men carrying the AKR1C3 rs12529 CG and GG genotypes in this NZ cohort."
https://openalex.org/W2944843020,"Local neocortical circuits play critical roles in information processing, including synaptic plasticity, circuit physiology, and learning, and GABAergic inhibitory interneurons have key roles in these circuits. Moreover, specific neurological disorders, including schizophrenia and autism, are associated with deficits in GABAergic transmission in these circuits. GABAergic synapses represent a small fraction of neocortical synapses, and are embedded in complex local circuits that contain many neuron and synapse types. Thus, it is challenging to study the physiological roles of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons and their synapses, and to develop treatments for the specific disorders caused by dysfunction at these GABAergic synapses. To these ends, we report a novel technology that can deliver different genes into pre- and post-synaptic neocortical interneurons connected by a GABAergic synapse: First, standard gene transfer into the presynaptic neurons delivers a synthetic peptide neurotransmitter, containing three domains, a dense core vesicle sorting domain, a GABAA receptor-binding domain, a single-chain variable fragment anti-GABAA ß2 or ß3, and the His tag. Second, upon release, this synthetic peptide neurotransmitter binds to GABAA receptors on the postsynaptic neurons. Third, as the synthetic peptide neurotransmitter contains the His tag, antibody-mediated, targeted gene transfer using anti-His tag antibodies is selective for these neurons. We established this technology by expressing the synthetic peptide neurotransmitter in GABAergic neurons in the middle layers of postrhinal cortex, and the delivering the postsynaptic vector into connected GABAergic neurons in the upper neocortical layers. Targeted gene transfer was 61% specific for the connected neurons, but untargeted gene transfer was only 21% specific for these neurons. This technology may support studies on the roles of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in circuit physiology and learning, and support gene therapy treatments for specific disorders associated with deficits at GABAergic synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2945242568,"It has been postulated that particular patterns of macular pigment (MP) distribution may be associated with the risk for eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This work investigates the potential of Zernike polynomials (ZP) to characterise the level and distribution of MP, and their suitability as a representation for analysis of the effects of age and AMD on MP patterns. As the case study, MP distribution maps computed using an experimental method based on fundus reflectance (MRIA) were obtained for ninety volunteers representing three groups: under-fifty without AMD, fifty and over without AMD, and fifty and over with AMD. ZP with 105 coefficients were fitted to the maps using least-squares optimisation and found to represent MP maps accurately (RMSE<10−1). One-way MANOVA analysis carried out on ZP representations showed that the three subject groups have significantly different means (Wilk’s Lambda 0.125, p<0.0001). Linear discriminant analysis with leave-one-out scheme resulted in accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of classification according to, respectively, disease status regardless of age (81% all); disease status in the age-matched groups (87%, 88%, 86%); age irrespective of disease status (81%, 83%, 73%); and age for subjects without AMD (83%, 88%, 80%). Mean MP distributions computed from ZP coefficients for the three groups showed more elevated and more peaked MP for the healthy under-fifty group; more irregular and more elevated peripheral levels in over-fifty AMD group than in over-fifty non-AMD group; and moderate radial asymmetry in non-AMD over-50 group. The results suggest that ZP coefficients are capable of accurately representing MP in a way that captures certain spatial patterns of its distribution. Using the ZP representation MP maps could be classified according to both age and disease status with accuracy significantly greater than chance, with peak elevation, pattern irregularity and radial asymmetry identified as important features."
https://openalex.org/W2945413212,"The use of agricultural resources or environments by wildlife may result in opportunities for transmission of infections amongst wild animals, livestock and humans. Targeted use of biosecurity measures may therefore reduce disease risks, although this requires practical knowledge of where such measures would be most effective, and effective means of communicating risks so that stakeholders can make informed decisions about such investment. In parts of Europe, the European badger Meles meles may act as a wildlife reservoir for Mycobacterium bovis, the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis, and badger visits to farmyards may provide potential opportunities for transmission of M. bovis to cattle. Biosecurity measures are effective in reducing badger activity in farmyards, although it is unclear which farms should be targeted with such measures. We used cameras to monitor badger activity in 155 farmyards in south west England and Wales, and related variations in the presence and frequency of badger visits to farm characteristics. Badgers were recorded on camera in 40% of farmyards monitored. However, the frequency of visits was highly variable, with badgers recorded on >50% of nights in only 10% of farms. The presence of badgers in farmyards was positively associated with the density of badger setts, the number of feed stores and the number of cattle sheds, and negatively associated with the distance to the nearest active badger sett, the presence of a house/dwelling and the number of cattle housed on the farm. The frequency of visits was negatively associated with the distance to the nearest active badger sett and the number of cattle housed. Models predicted the presence/absence of badgers in farmyards with 73% accuracy (62% sensitivity, 81% specificity, using a cut off value of 0.265). Models could not distinguish between farms with low/high frequency of visits, although farms predicted as having badgers present typically had a higher frequency of visits than those that were not. We developed and present an interactive web based application: the Badger Farm Assessment Tool (BFAT), to allow users to enter the characteristics of a farm and generate a relative risk score describing the likelihood of badger visits."
https://openalex.org/W2944818821,"Background Understanding of how cardiovascular risk information influence individuals is critical for the practice of risk assessment and the management of patients with cardiovascular disease. Objectives The objective of this study was to investigate change in mental distress among research participants after undergoing a cardiovascular risk assessment and receiving individual test results. Methods In 2017, a questionnaire measuring mental distress after taking part in a risk assessment was distributed among 615 participants in the Swedish Cardiopulmonary Bio Image Study in Uppsala, Sweden, aged 50–64 years. Outcome measures were re-assessed after three months (30% were lost to follow-up). Results There were no differences in outcomes after three months for participants with normal test results or for participants who were referred to primary health care. Mental distress increased in participants who were referred to the hospital, and were further explained by the fact that these participants were diagnosed with coronary artery stenosis. Conclusions CV risk information can be provided to individuals with lower levels of risk without concerns of inducing mental distress. However, in order to prevent unnecessary worry in contexts similar to this study, one should be prepared for different risk outcomes and plan for support for individuals with higher risk. The increased utility of powerful, yet not fully mature, imaging techniques requires careful considerations extending beyond medical risks and benefits; the clinician must also take into account the risk of mental distress and secure support when necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2946234505,"In sports leagues that use an annual draft to assign eligible players to clubs, having a value associated with a draft selection can allow clubs to anticipate future growth of players and, if a trading period exists, assist negotiations when exchanging draft selections and players. Typically, mean draft values often decline in either an exponential or geometric manner with increasing draft selection number. Aggregate mean values have been used to compare trade packages. However, clubs may also want to ensure that a trade does not increase the probability of obtaining poor players in the draft. This paper therefore considers equivalence of risk as an alternative trading strategy for club list managers. Here, risk is defined as the probability of the aggregate value of the received draft selections being below a minimum acceptable level. For risk equivalence, a premium over and above mean market value may need to be provided when trading to secure higher draft selections."

It was critical that we do well—for the center and for my job as education director. But as the panelists asked their questions, all I could think was, “I have multiple sclerosis.” I had been diagnosed a couple weeks prior and was in a state of shock. For months I had noticed my body behaving strangely, for example when my ankle stopped working after I walked a few kilometers. I had known what the symptoms might mean—my mother was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in the '90s. But I had ignored them. I was not prepared to deal with my own battle.

ILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER

When my doctor finally convinced me to see a neurologist and I got my diagnosis, I opted to compartmentalize and tried to work past it—though moments of complete distress sometimes intruded, as during the site visit. But despite my distraction, we got our funding, and for 3 years after that, I buried myself in my work. I have worked since I was 16 and always have known my next move. I didn't see why my diagnosis should get in the way of that.

My job involves working with students who are members of marginalized groups, and after my diagnosis I started to advocate for them even more passionately. In graduate school, I had realized that I cared more about diversifying science and creating an equitable culture than I did about research. I wanted to challenge assumptions about students from different backgrounds by developing programs that championed them.

It didn't occur to me that I, too, was now a member of a marginalized group, nor did I see any relation between my diagnosis and my advocacy. I did not share my diagnosis with most of my co-workers. For me, and many people with MS, the disease doesn't manifest in recognizable ways, so people only know that I have MS when I elect to tell them. And I mostly remained silent. I didn't think it was relevant for my work, and I didn't want to be perceived as less capable. I had an amazing support network in my personal life, but I preferred to keep my professional life separate.

That changed after I decided to challenge myself and look for a new job. I secured an offer after an exhaustive search. But, for the first time in my life, the thought of tackling a new path was not energizing; it sounded draining. What I needed was a break. I could only consider cutting back because I am privileged, supported by my partner both emotionally and financially. Even so, admitting that I needed to slow down was tough. But it felt right.

With the support of my boss, I began to work part time from my new home, after moving halfway across the country to be in an environment that would be better for my MS as well as satisfy personal and professional priorities for me and my husband. And I began the difficult task of truly coming to terms with my diagnosis. I also thought more deeply about what it means to advocate for scientists from marginalized groups. In my case, I realized, taking time off—and being public about it—is itself an element of advocacy. To get others to think about the variety of identities and experiences that make up the scientific community and the importance of inclusion, I need to be more vocal and honest about my disability.

The world defaults to the able-bodied. I have been at workshops where it is assumed everyone can walk a kilometer to the venue and the menu does not accommodate dietary restrictions. The onus is on the people with disabilities or needs that aren't “standard” to raise their voices for equal treatment. We need to change the default to be a culture of inclusion.

I don't know exactly what my future will hold when I return to work full time, but I'm getting better at accepting that uncertainty. I do know that, going forward, I will aim to be a better advocate not just for my students, but for myself.
